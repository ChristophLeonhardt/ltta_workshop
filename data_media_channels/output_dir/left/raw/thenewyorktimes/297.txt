1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,600
I served as a Navy
SEAL for 20 years.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,070
I deployed 13 times, and a
couple of those deployments

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,430
to Afghanistan and Iraq.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,740
I’m transgender.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,840
And as you look at
me right now you

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,990
might see a dude with long hair.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,600
You can have Kristin
with a dress on,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,020
and I can still kick ass.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,750
President Trump’s sudden and
sweeping ban using Twitter,

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,600
tweeting he will ban
transgender people

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,540
from serving in the
military in any capacity.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,170
On that, the decision is
based on a military decision.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,270
It’s not meant to be
anything more than that.

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,350
I was pretty upset.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,620
And I call fault on that.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,510
This is a political decision.

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,120
There’s many transgender
people serving right now.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,500
Thousands.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,255
They’ve had
estimates from 2,000,

20
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:55,650
all the way up to possibly
15,000 transgender people are

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,580
currently serving in uniform.

22
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,720
The United Kingdom, Israel,
Norway, Sweden, the Canadians,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,990
Australia, already have
open transgender service,

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,510
and America, the
home of the free,

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,010
we’re not going to allow
open transgender service?

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,250
Just doesn’t make sense.

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,790
President Trump tweeted it would
be tremendous medical costs

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,250
for transgender soldiers.

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,880
The costs in a RAND study were
theoretically at $8.4 million.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,730
The military spent
alone over $80 million

31
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,680
on erectile dysfunction,
$40 million on Viagra alone.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,520
$40 million.

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
Here’s the bottom line.

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,950
Transgender Americans like
myself, we are capable,

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,920
and we are worthy to
serve in the US military.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,780
I don’t need dresses and makeup.

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,200
I don’t need anything.

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,630
[gunfire]

39
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,965
If this ban is
allowed to stand,

40
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:06,030
then I challenge and I
call out every congressman

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,449
and every general officer,
retired and active,

42
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,560
to stand up.

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,970
Stand up for worthy Americans,
that we are capable,

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,620
and we want to serve.

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,000
Stand up for us.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fight for us.
