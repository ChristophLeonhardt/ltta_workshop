THE NFL HAS GONE THROUGH
MANY PUBLIC PERCEPTION CHANGES
MAINLY BECAUSE OF HAVING TO DEAL
WITH THE REAL ISSUE.
I AM SORRY
FOR SAYING SPORTS ARE NOT A REAL
ISSUE.
THEY HAVE BEEN
ADDRESSING/NOT ADDRESSING
NATIONAL ANTHEM PROTESTS,
SPECIFICALLY WITH COLIN
KAEPERNICK.
I THINK WE HAVE AN
IMAGE.
I'D LOVE TO SEE ONE OF THESE
NFL OWNERS WHEN SOMEONE
DISRESPECTS OUR FLAG SAY GET
THAT SON OF A BITCH OFF THE
FIELD RIGHT NOW, IT OUT, HE IS
FIRED.
HE IS FIRED.
TRUMP HAS
HIS OWN WAY OF HOW HE THINKS
THAT PEOPLE THAT PROCESS SHOULD
BE DEALT WITH.
IN PARTICULAR,
COLIN KAEPERNICK IS VERY FAMOUS
FOR KNEELING DURING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM AS A PROTEST AGAINST
BRUTALITY, WHICH SEEMS FAIR, BUT
IT'S REALLY GOTTEN UNDER A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S THIN SKIN, INCLUDING
OUR PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THIS,
THERE WAS A LARGE MEETING OF
ABOUT 30 PEOPLE, NFL OWNERS AND
PLAYERS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
SHOULD HAPPEN, THIS CAME ABOUT A
MONTH AFTER TRUMP STARTED ON THE
NFL THEY HAD TO ADDRESS IT
BECAUSE HE WAS RILING PEOPLE UP,
GETTING PEOPLE ANGRY AND THEY
HAD TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING.
THIS WAS RECORDED AS A
THREE-HOUR RECORDING AND THE NEW
YORK TIMES HAS A, HOWEVER IT WAS
NOT RELEASED TO US.
INSTEAD,
THERE ARE HIGHLIGHTS FROM IT.
IN PARTICULAR, SOME OF THE
OWNERS WERE A KIND OF A LOSS AS
TO WHAT TO DO AND SOME OF THE
OWNERS ACTUALLY WHO HAVE
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP
PRIVATELY DID NOT DO THAT.
MAYBE YOU CAN JUDGE FOR
YOURSELF.
ROBERT K. KRAFT THE
PATRIOTS OWNER WHO IS PUBLICLY
VERY FRIENDLY WITH TRUMP SAID:
JEFFREY LURIE, THE EAGLES OWNER
SAID:
THE BUFFALO BILLS OWNER TERRY
PEGULA SAID:
AND BOB MCNAIR, THE
HOUSTON TEXANS OWNER SAID:
EMPHASIS ADDED BY ME.
WELL, THIS IS ABOUT MONEY,
AND ASSAULT ON THEIR BUSINESS
RIGHT, THAT YOU WEAPON NICEST
ANTHEM THING TO THE POINT WHERE
IT IS AFFECTING THEIR BOTTOM
LINE SO THE NFL OWNERS ARE
CONCERNED ON THE ONE HAND ABOUT
THAT BUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT
THE DIVISIVENESS IN THE COUNTRY
AND ALL THESE THINGS, I WOULD
GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR BRINGING UP
ISSUES THAT ARE LEGITIMATE, BUT
I THINK THEY ARE MOTIVATED I
BEING IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF A
COMMERCIAL CONCERN.
THAT IS TO
SAY PEOPLE NOT GOING TO THE
GAMES OR PROTESTING THE GAMES
BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT OF AN
ANTHEM.
THEY CLEARLY HAVE
CONSPIRED AGAINST POOR COLIN
KAEPERNICK.
THIS IS AN
ASTOUNDING ATHLETE WHO DESERVES
TO BE ON ONE OF THESE TEAMS IN
SOME CAPACITY OF NOT A STARTING
QUARTERBACK, BACKUP ONE BUT MORE
TO THE POINT, THIS IS A SORT OF
ONE-DIMENSIONAL PATRIOTISM
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANTHEM, HOW
LOUD USING A, DO YOU HAVE YOUR
HAND OVER YOUR HEART, DO YOU
KNOW ALL THE WORDS, DO YOU HAVE
TO STAND AT ATTENTION.
IT IS ALL
PAPER PATRIOTISM.
HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH BEING AN ACTUAL
AMERICAN PATRIOT.
THE THINGS
THAT ARE CELEBRATED ABOUT THIS
COUNTRY, THAT REALLY MAKE YOU A
PATRIOT, FREE SPEECH AND CIVIL
RIGHTS, IT IS NOT HOW LOUD YOU
SEEING THIS GED AND THUMB SO I
JUST AND THIS IS THE STUFF THAT
TRUMP IS GREAT AT, THE PAPER
PATRIOTISM, THE FLAG THAT IS THE
BIGGEST, THE PENS THAT ALL OF
THE AMERICAN FLAG ON THEM THAT
HE HANDS OUT TO EVERYONE.
THAT
IS CRAP AND HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING A PATRIOT.
BUT THEY
HAVE WRAPPED THIS ISSUE OF
PATRIOTISM WITH RESPECT FOR THE
LITERARY AND ALL THE REST
ON THIS ANTHEM.
I THINK THE ANTHEM GETS PAID
PLAYED TOO MUCH AND
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EVEN BE
PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE SPORTING EVENTS.
I THINK THAT IT IS
INTERESTING TO BRING UP WHAT
PATRIOTISM MEANS TO PEOPLE
BECAUSE FOR ME, PATRIOTISM ISN'T
IDOLIZING OR WORSHIPING A FLAG
OR ANY INANIMATE OBJECT.
FOR
ME, PATRIOTISM IS LOOKING OUT
FOR YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS.
LOOKING AT THE COUNTRY AS A
COLLECTIVE AFTER TO TAKE CARE OF
ONE ANOTHER AS OPPOSED TO THIS
INDIVIDUALISTIC SOCIETY THAT WE
ARE NOW KIND OF LIVING AND
TAUGHT EVERYMAN OUT FOR HIMSELF,
ALWAYS LOOK DOWN AT THE LITTLE
GUY, IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WE
HAVE KIND OF LOST SIGHT ABOUT
WHAT IT MEANS TO REALLY BE AN
AMERICAN DOCTOR IT IS BECOME
KIND OF THIS UNILATERAL VIEW OF
THIS EXACT VERSION OF MODERN
UNITED STATES CONSERVATISM BUT
THERE IS A SAYING THAT DISSENT
IS PATRIOTIC AND I BELIEVE THAT
IS TRUE.
WHEN I STARTED MY
CAREER I WAS A REGULAR
JOURNALIST.
WE NEED THE FOURTH
ESTATE, WE NEED SOMEONE TO
QUESTION.
WE NEED SOMEONE TO
MAKE SURE EVERY AMERICAN IS
BEING LOOKED AFTER IN THE RIGHT
WAY, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TYRANT
OR A NARCISSIST RUNNING THINGS
POORLY.
IF THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.
ABSOLUTELY.
I GENUINELY
THINK THAT REAL PATRIOTISM IS
PUTTING YOURSELF IN AN
EMPATHETIC PLACE WHERE YOU WANT
TO HELP YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS,
WHERE YOU WANT TO CREATE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM, THE SAME
TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU
WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
GROWING UP.
THE AMERICAN DREAM
IN MY OPINION NO LONGER EXISTS
AND IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE
SHIFTED AWAY FROM A COLLECTIVIST
SOCIETY INTO THIS
INDIVIDUALISTIC EVERYMAN OUT FOR
HIMSELF KIND OF SOCIETY.
THE
AMERICAN FLAG IS ONE THING.
IF
YOU LOVE THE AMERICAN FLY, HERE
YOU.
BUT I THINK IT IS WAY MORE
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WAYS
THAT WE CAN UNITE OURSELVES AS
OPPOSED TO GIVE INTO THIS
DIVISION THAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION KEEPS
PUSHING FOR THE.
TRIBALISM IS SO EASY.
IT IS.
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
ANCIENT PART OF OUR BRAINS IS TO
JOIN A TRIBE AND BE PART OF IT.
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THAT
WAY.
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO
GRAPHIC 66.
SO WHAT WE HAVE
HERE IS COLIN KAEPERNICK AND ONE
OF HIS TEAMMATES ERIC REED.
HE
IS THE FIRST TEAMMATES NEIL WITH
HIM AND THEN YOU MAY HAVE SEEN
THE VIDEO OF THIS.
THERE ARE
OTHER TEAMMATES AND OTHER PEOPLE
ON THE OPPOSING TEAM SHOWING
THEIR SUPPORT, PUTTING UP THE
FIST, KNEELING AS WELL.
WHAT IS
INTERESTING IS WHAT CAME FROM
THE PLAYERS IN THIS MEETING.
THEY WERE IN SUPPORT OF COLIN
KAEPERNICK, IN PARTICULAR,
GRAPHIC 64 IF WE COULD GO TO
THAT.
ERIC REID SPOKE OUT ON
HIS BEHALF.
AFTER THAT, ANOTHER PLAYER
CHRIS LONG SPOKE UP FOR HIM:
TO 
THAT THEY WERE MET WITH
REALLY NONCOMMITTAL RESPONSES,
NOTHING MUCH FROM THE OWNERS
THEMSELVES, WHICH DOES SEEM
TO SHOW YOU WHERE PRIORITIES DO
LIE AT THIS POINT.
THE PRIORITIES LIE IN NOT
WANTING TO ROCK THE BOAT
WITH THE FANS.
IT IS A COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
AS I SAY, THAT IS WHAT IS
REALLY MOTIVATING THE REACTION
AND THAT IS WHY COLIN
KAEPERNICK IS NOT ON THE TEAM.
IT IS PRETTY DEVASTATING AND
I DO GIVE HIM A LOT OF CREDIT
BECAUSE I DO THINK HE WAS FULLY
AWARE OF WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS
WOULD BE AND HE STILL DID WHAT
HE BELIEVED WAS RIGHT AND KEEP
IN MIND, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
HE JUST DID WITHOUT CONSULTING
ANYONE.
HE MADE SURE THAT HE
WOULD CARRY OUT THIS PROTEST IN
THE MOST RESPECTFUL WAY POSSIBLE
AND IT STILL DID NOT MATTER.
GOING BACK TO MY POINT ABOUT THE
VISION, YOU HAVE THIS DIVISION
WITHIN THE NFL.
EVERYTHING
TRUMP TOUCHES EXPERIENCES
DIVISION, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE
THAT WAY.
I KNOW THIS IS
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I GUESS TAKE
IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT I
WOULD ARGUE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHEN
THEY GO TO SPORTING EVENTS.
I
WENT TO A DODGERS GAME WITH MY
HUSBAND RECENTLY AND WE WENT
EARLY ENOUGH TO HEAR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE JUST WALKING AROUND, AT
THE CONCESSION STANDS, IN THE
BATHROOM.
YOU HEAR TOILETS
FLUSHING, AND IT IS JUST
INCREDIBLE THAT YOU HAVE THIS
ONE PERSON WHO IS CARRYING OUT
THIS PROTEST FOR A VERY
LEGITIMATE REASON THAT IS CLOSE
TO HIS HEART AND HE HAS LOST HIS
CAREER AS A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE
AS A RESULT OF THAT AND SO WHY
DO WE NOT ALL LOOK AT A HARD
LOOK AT OURSELVES IN THE
WAY WE BEHAVE DURING THE
NATIONAL IN THE BEFORE WE
ROOT FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF
SOMEONE ELSE'S CAREER
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE
A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL POINT.
