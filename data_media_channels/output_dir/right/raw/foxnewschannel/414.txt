3
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:10,462
VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT

4
00:00:10,463 --> 00:00:12,364
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:14,600
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE 1955

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:18,637
TREATY OF AMITY.

7
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,540
THE TREATY MADE A MOCKERY OF

8
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,942
WHAT THAT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM,

9
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,310
AND MALIGNED BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT

10
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,845
THE MIDDLE EAST.

11
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:27,713
TODAY'S DECISION BY THE

12
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:28,614
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE

13
00:00:28,615 --> 00:00:34,753
WAS A DEFEAT FOR     IRAN.

14
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:36,955
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ICJ

15
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,557
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS

16
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,126
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY

17
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:42,861

00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:48,300
SECURITY UNDER THE TREATY.

21
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,635
INSTEAD, THE COURT ALLOWED IRAN

22
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:52,271
TO USE IT AS A FORM FOR

23
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:54,840
PROPAGANDA.

24
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:55,441
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS

25
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:59,545
SYSTEMATICALLY PURSUIT POLICY OF

26
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,312
HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE

CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE TREATY OF

29
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:04,616
AMITY.

30
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:14,493
THE REGIME CANNOT PRACTICE

31
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:15,227
ANIMOSITY IN ITS CONDUCT AND ASK

32
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:15,794

33
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:16,295

46
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,617
I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THE
