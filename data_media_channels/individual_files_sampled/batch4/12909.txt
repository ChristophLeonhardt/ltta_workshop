well since it's Friday I thought that it could be fun to reach into the mailbag not a literal mailbag I wish I wish I just had a bag of mail with envelopes that I could reach into but a metaphorical mailbag and tackle a subject that was suggested to me via email and by the way I always enjoy these kinds of emails so anytime there's a topic that you'd like me to hear me babble about and I haven't battled about before you could always suggest it it also does my job for me by providing me with content so I really appreciate that as well all right so here is the email it says hi Matt first of all huge fan I'm going because of my incredible humility I will skip the first paragraph that complements me and I'll go to the next one as a 23 year old Christian girl getting married and starting a family of my own is something I'm really looking forward to in life however recently I've heard and read so many things about how it's unnatural for men to be monogamous I even watched a Netflix documentary about why monogamy is not meant for humans specifically men I'd like to say that these studies don't bother me but I'd be lying like most Millennials my biggest fear is a failed marriage and this is just fuel to the fire anyway I would love to hear your take on this matter so monogamy is unnatural is the subject this obviously is is an increasingly popular idea and it's something that you know rather frequently you'll see passed around on social media you'll see an article being passed around claiming that monogamy is unnatural that monogamous relationships are doomed to failure that being polyamorous is is the more enlightened choice in fact I saw an article on Facebook recently that I guess was related to a new show on the BBC about a couple who are seeking to save their marriage by having an open relationship that is by cheating on each other consensually and the articles promoting the idea of having an open relationship so I think the attack on monogamy is often direct you have people directly saying that monogamy is unnatural implausible not feasible but then you say you have that kind of attack but then I think you have the more common sort of attack on monogamy that is implicit and sort of just cultural and environmental where people in my generation have grown up in an environment where that is just hostile to monogamy and and where where if you didn't know any better and you looked around you may reach the ink the conclusion that monogamy is somehow an impossibility there there are a lot of people in my generation who growing up as kids they really never encountered a faithful healthy monogamous relationship their own parents were divorced their friend's parents were divorced it's just divorce all over the place and so that's how a lot of people were raised and it's no surprise that a lot of them now as adults have decided that you know marriage a healthy stable marriage is impossible so there's no reason to even try now I think there are a few different aspects of this discussion that need to be tackled or a few different questions that need to be answered number one is monogamy actually unnatural number two is something like an open marriage more natural or even possible logically and number three is monogamy possible so I'll try to tackle these one at a time number one is monogamy unnatural I think the short answer is yes and no it depends on what you mean by natural and thus what you mean by unnatural now I think and and the way we talk about things being natural it's very convoluted and confused and people seem to be very inconsistent in in you know in the times when they'll use this idea of something being natural as a justification for doing it like we're very selective about that and I think part of the confusion is that is that the word natural as it pertains to humans can mean one of two things so when we say natural we could mean it in the lower sense that is it's natural because it's what we instinctively crave it's natural because it satisfies some base urghhh that we have you know so in that way being polyamorous or sleeping around being unfaithful that is a natural thing in that sense it's natural like like lying is natural like jealousy is natural like hatred and gossip and pride are all natural they're natural like it's natural to get angry and punch a wall they're natural in the sense that you could experience that urge and if you have no discipline or self-control you could easily slip into that so that's what I mean by natural a person who doesn't try to control themselves and just lets themselves sort of be that's how they're gonna be they're gonna be they're gonna be you know gossiping prideful lying unfaithful they're gonna be all those things and in that sense monogamy is unnatural in the same way that it's unnatural to suppress your anger or to exercise humility or to refrain from lying and to tell the truth even when the truth is painful or inconvenient or uncomfortable so I think natural in this sense in the sense that being non-monogamous is natural would be better called maybe bass or or even animalistic animalistic because animals are going to experience a compulsion or an instinct and then that's just how they're going to act they're not going to choose to do something else an animal is never going to say well I really have the urge to do this but I think that's wrong so I'm going to do this instead animals will never do that and so a person who who says well I can't be monogamous because it's not natural what they're saying is basically they don't want to live like a human they don't they don't aspire to be a human being they want it and they want to be they want to live like a dog like an animal but then there is natural in the other sense I think the higher sense the sense that maybe we would even call supernatural and not supernatural because it's magical but because it is above instinct it is above compulsion it is above urge when we act this way we are we are separating ourselves from nature to an extent we're standing above nature in a way because we are acting in a way that the rest of nature is not capable of acting we are making a choice that the rest of nature animals and plants cannot make monogamy lifelong devotion belongs to this category that I know that there are some examples in the animal kingdom of monogamy that is animals who have a lifelong partner but again that's very different that's that's that's instinct it's not like they have made this promise in this commitment to each other that I'm gonna stick by this person for this other creature for the rest of my life that's that's not what's going on only humans can make that calculation and make that choice so it's a higher thing it's a greater more beautiful more enriching thing but like all higher things like all greater things that requires effort and work and sacrifice and discipline fidelity goes against our baser urges but not because it perverts those urges or those instincts so it's not like it's not like someone who hurts themselves on purpose someone's that someone who's a self-mutilator and so they they go against the instinct for self-preservation and the instinct to avoid pain but in that case they go against it in that they pervert it it's not like that monogamy fidelity it goes against our instincts by reaching for something beyond instant and in that way I would argue that it is the most natural the most human because it's our ability to reach beyond instinct and to act according to a higher standard that makes us human so in pursuing this path we really become ourselves it's you know by just having sex with random people living a life of selfishness you're losing your human identity and becoming this small and pathetic little thing I don't want to get off on a side on a you know I don't I get sidetracked here but this is also why I find the argument against free will so completely stupid I mean it's the stupidest argument that you'll hear that even very smart people will make trying to deny free will I mean what are you talking about it is obviously evident that we all have free will because here's how I can prove it okay I can really really really want to do one thing and not do that thing that's free will no other an on the animal kingdom has that we are the only ones who can do that in the known universe we're the only ones we could really have an urge to do something and yet do the opposite so I think when people who argue against free will what they're really set revealing about themselves is that they are total absolute cowards and wimps and that they in their own lives have never actually resisted an urge have never exercised any self-restraint and have therefore decided that it's impossible for everyone but it's not impossible it is possible to do the fact that you haven't done it just means that you're weak but it can be done it can many billions of people do it all the time so that's you know that that's the distinction between natural and unnatural and I think you can see this I mean talk to uh talk to a couple that's been married for 50 or 60 or 70 years I think often what you'll find when you talk to some people like that is that they you know it's like they've reached a higher mode of since you know you'll find a certain piece a certain wisdom that's grown from a life of love and devotion and you can contrast that with someone who's older and is gone you know is also older like like them like the old married couple but let's take someone who's who's older and and has gone from marriage to marriage lived a life of self-seeking of self involvement never managed to have really a healthy faithful relationship and what you'll notice about that kind of person is that they've kind of caved in on themselves and they become like shells and all that was real and vital and awesomely human about them has been eaten away and that is what being natural has gotten them number two these days we have the idea of an open relationship or an open marriage and this seems to me to be a contradiction in terms you know saying open marriage is like saying dry lake or something now a lake might dry out you know of course but but once it has dried out it's not a lake anymore so there's no such thing as a dry lake it's not a lake it's just a big hole in the ground and I think something similar is the case with an open marriage now of course it's hard to make this case in modern times when people don't recognize that marriage has any particular definition or purpose and if marriage is just literally any kind of arrangement if it's just whatever you want it to be then marriage is nothing it means nothing by opening up the definition of something and including all definitions within it you haven't gained a new definition you have just lost definition that was the whole argument about that was the argument that these supporters of so-called traditional marriage have always made is it's an argument of definite it's an argument of logic saying look marriage is a certain thing serves a certain purpose if you erase those lines and say well it's not that thing anymore it doesn't serve that purpose anymore then you have to come up with a new definition that can still exclude all other definitions because if it's not a definition that excludes other definitions then it's not a definition the problem is that the people who who have advocated for this new definition of marriage they never actually came up with a new definition the old definition is very simple very straightforward the marriage is a is a lifelong commitment between a man and a woman that is a life long fruitful commitment between a man and woman that serves as the foundation for a family that's what a you know it's what marriage now you could disagree with that but at least it is a thing it make you know what that is it has definition it has purpose it has function okay well if you're coming in and saying well it doesn't need to be lifelong doesn't need to be monogamous doesn't need to be fruitful doesn't need to serve as a foundation of a family well then what is it what normal is this thing now it just went from a thing that is is a thing to a thing that's nothing unless you can come up with some new depth but no one bothered to do that and so now we just all we've done is literally gotten rid of marriage at least in the in our in you know from a cultural standpoint and from a legal standpoint but the fact still remains even if we don't recognize it as a culture even if we don't recognize it legally marriage is still marriage between a man and a woman and that part is important because one of the primary functions are set up a marriage is to serve as the basis for the family and only a man and woman can biologically create a family and the lifelong a monogamous part is important because that is why a family requires in order to be stable happy and healthy now you might say what about polygamy which obviously has plenty of historical precedent well I I think polygamy is a primitive kind of arrangement that we have grown past I think also that polygamy could have arguably been necessary in the earlier days the very early days of human civilization when human beings had to do quite a lot of reproducing in order to reach stable population numbers but that's not the case anymore and anyway polygamy in the traditional sense is not the same as this modern idea of an open marriage where spouse goes out and has sex with whoever they want just for fun for recreation and then comes home and to their to their spouse and pretends that they love them and it also isn't the same as the modern system of marrying and divorcing a whole string of people so at the end of your life you have a you know at the end of your life you can look back and see that you have four or five spouses but you just had them in succession instead of all at once I think even the polygamists of old would would have found both of those arrangements to be absurd and horrifying so but you know open marriage is is it's it's a you know it's a dry lake it's a it's a square circle it's a contradict and contradiction in charge the thing that makes if a marriage is a marriage if it means anything one of the central things that make it a marriage is that it is closed that it is a bond between two people man and woman closed off from others is a unique and special bond 3 is monogamy possible is it possible or feasible to get married and stay married and remain faithful to one person for your whole life and for that let me let me offer an emphatic yes and this is one of the most frustrating things two things to me that that people who have failed in their relationships and failed in their marriages will very often argue that essentially their experiences is universal you know nobody can be sure in their marriage nobody can rule out divorce that's sort of what they'll say that's the message that newlyweds and people who are you know discerning marriage that's the message that they hear and they'll hear that well if you're happily married right now or if you're about to get married watch out because it could happen to you anytime horse could just happen to you the end of your marriage could just happen like you could just trip into it like a puddle write your vows your promise is your plans all that really doesn't mean anything it's nice but it doesn't mean anything this is the attitude that people seem seem to want young married couples to have and I find it detestable honestly I find it too testable anytime I've talked about this publicly about the issue of divorce and you know being faithful to your spouse and so on or I've talked about myself I've said you know been married for seven years I'm never gonna divorce my wife III have had in so many cases I've been told by people who have been divorced and they've said they said well pride comes before the fall what kind of thing is that to say so you're saying it's prideful that I'm not gonna divorce my wife I'm arrogant for that because I made a vow and I plan to stick with it that makes me arrogant and prideful what a horrible awful thing that you realize how horrible that is to say to people I mean you may as well you may as well just wish to you might as well tell them you're gonna get I hope you get divorced one day it's what you're doing I and I really think that's the case I think there are a lot of people who have you know experienced a lot of misery in their life in their lives much of it self-inflicted and they really do wish it on others they want other people to experience it well let me let me say this that's all bull and if you're if you're getting married or if you're a young married couple don't listen to it don't listen to these miserable people who would try to foist their miseries on you don't listen to people who say you know I couldn't do this so nobody can don't listen to them here's an absolute fact about marriage if both of you are 100% committed to it and you remain committed to it and above all you remain totally faithful to one another your marriage will last as long as you live guaranteed all you have to do is fulfill those two things if both of you do you're committed faithful your marriage lasts I mean it's really as simple as that it's impossible that you could both do that and and complete that task on a daily base a if you're doing that every day you're not going to trip and fall and end up divorced one day and is any of that impossible or unrealistic is it impossible or unrealistic to be committed and faithful no it's not only possible but it's completely feasible it's not only feasible but it's even easy easy when you look at it objectively I mean easy when you look at it this way okay look look at this way you say to yourself I'm married okay I can be faithful and committed or not and then and then you you think so this is just you're being objective right I have two paths like faithful committed path and then the unfaithful non-committed path and then you think about where each path will take you the faithful and committed path is not only morally correct but it's also way way easier I mean it's difficult in the sense that it requires sacrifice honesty work and so on but it's easy in that it's much simpler it's much more peaceful it's much happier and you avoid all the complications and dramas and deceits that mark the lives of unfaithful and uncommitted people you know in a sense in a similar sense you could say it's it's much easier to eat healthy and get exercise and live a healthy life it's easier now little sacrifices are required to maintain such a life and in the moment like when you are choosing to have broccoli and you compare that to the choice to eat ice cream seems like a harder choice and when you're going for a jog and you compare that to the choice of sitting on the couch the jog seems like the harder choice but if you look at it in its totality objectively you see that the other option to be a lazy glutton who eats ice cream all the time and just sittin laze around on the couch that will lead to huge complications down the road all kinds of health problems and ultimately to the biggest sacrifice of all your life you're gonna die it will kill you of course we're all gonna die but that lifestyle will kill you much sooner so in that sense to eat healthy and to get exercise it really is easier it makes your life a lot easier there's a great line at the end of Graham Greene's book power and the glory I think I've mentioned before one of my favorite books and there's a line that it's a scene where a priest is in jail he's awaiting execution martyrdom and though this priest has done a heroic thing by in the end sticking to his faith even when faced with death up until that point he had lived a sinful life he was a drunk he had an illegitimate child okay and so as he was in his cell awaiting execution Green has this line to describe his state of mind the line is it seemed to him at that moment that it would have been quite easy to have been a saint it would only have needed a little self-restraint and a little courage and I've always thought I always loved that line and that whole scene because of how deeply true it seems and you can really imagine yourself in a Cell awaiting execution and having the exact same thought that really to be a saint to be a good person is actually really easy when you look at it objectively all it requires in any given situation most of the time is a little bit of self-restraint a little bit of courage a little bit of selflessness 99% of the moments in our lives only require the smallest little smidgen of saintliness 99% of time that is all that's required so that to be a bad person to live a bad life it means that you have to consistently refuse even in the pettiest situations you have to refuse to even be a little bit selfless selfless and a little bit honest and you have to consistently make that refusal where you see after a while it's almost like it requires more effort to be a bad person because you have to do it be so consistently bad at a certain point you think you just give up on it and say fine I'll just be a good prayer it's so much easier to just be a good person and I think a similar similar thing is the case with marriage marriage is most often fail because one or both people usually both refuse to stop being selfish for even two seconds that really is the truth I'm not saying the truth every time but I think in the majority of cases it is what kills a marriage is consistent unrelenting selfishness on the part of both people I think that being being you know a good spouse 99% of the time consists of of very little things that are that are really easy it consists of taking the garbage out without grumbling about it or or smiling at your spouse when they come home from work asking them how their day was it consists of you know volunteering to be the one who gets up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water for the crying kid that sort of stuff I think if if in all of these really small easy situations if we exercise a little bit of patience a little bit of selflessness our marriages will be fine now they're still gonna be that 1% there's gonna be that small minority of really difficult challenging situations those moments when doing the right thing responding the right way might require even something like heroism but the 99% won't require anything close to them and if you get into the habit of being selfless in the 99% then probably you'll react the right way or close to the right way when the 1% creeps up on you and I think that's the other thing that there may be plenty of marriages that appear to have ended because of some cataclysmic thing that occurred or some great challenge that they that the couple faced and it may seem on the outside I may even seem to them that this huge challenge is the thing that that destroyed the marriage but I think probably in most cases that's not true I think what you'll find is that it was kind of a that one or both of them had been in the habit for a long time leading up to that I've been in the habit of selfishness and pettiness and impatience and all of that and so there had been this kind of cumulative effect and then the big thing happens and it's an explosion that blows them apart because they have no stability they have no strength at all in their in their marriage and in the relationship and so they don't have the foundations to survive this big challenge and also they themselves personally because they haven't gotten into the habit of being good you know being a good husband or being a good wife when this huge challenge arises they have no idea how to approach that in the right way so I think that's that's all that's needed to be monogamous and faithful and and by the way I don't I don't say any of this as a person I've been married for going on seven years so I'm hardly a marriage expert compared to someone's been married for thirty years I think I'm still a novice and I also certainly have not mastered the art of doing what I would call the easy thing you know and and and being selfless and patient in the small situations I have not at all I have not I have not myself mastered than 99% well that's part of the reason why I know this because so many times if I you know if I am impatient or if I do the wrong thing in one of these small situations you know or there's a fight or something like that I can look back on it later and say what I mean why did I do that it would have been so much easier to simply do the you know it would have been so much easier had a little bit of patience or to be a little bit selfless so that's what I would say that email or don't don't be afraid of marriage don't be afraid of it but but be be discerning about who you altima end up with and and you do absolutely have to go into it yourself completely ruling out the possibility of divorce and knowing that your future spouse has also ruled out the possibility completely ruled it out and then at that point you you charge out into the great unknown and see what awaits you all right have a great weekend everybody Godspeed
