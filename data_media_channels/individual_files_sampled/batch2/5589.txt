number of changes have also been underway at the EPA the Environmental Protection Agency the agency is planning to eliminate the science advisors office under it's an office of research and development rolled meant to advise the administrator and to ensure that the best science is used to inform environmental policies you'd think that was important right but that's not all the Trump administration is also moving to weaken US standards for radiation exposure experts say the EPA's proposal would increase radiation exposure to medical oil and gas workers lots going on joining me now is the astrophysicist and author of accessory to war among other books but this is a new one neil degrasse tyson neil good to see you yeah thanks for having me lots is happening at the EPA they placed the by the way the universe is fine it's earth problems make that clear I just want to sort of get your impression of the relationship between government and good science and good policy well so I as a scientist and my colleagues we conduct science generally unmonitored by a government agency which is the effects of our creativity and we want to take our curiosity but it tends to be that the biggest funded science is what comes out of a government and this can move the center of mass of a field in ways that individual workers in lab because because government sometimes can do things that aren't profitable or the MEP greater good correct they have deeper pockets or they have geopolitical reasons for the we went to the moon right not for science and that's we've got some science done yeah the way it piggybacked it so so it's an it becomes an issue for the future of a nation if the government doesn't understand what science is or how and why it works it means that nation will not participate on the leading frontier of how science and technology will transform civilization other countries will by the way we were at that frontier for most of the second half of the 20th century and it's the the the the era that I grew up in you would have had some years in there noticing at your young fellow though and so that's the America that I knew and loved no one was debating the objective truths of science life the peoples have put more science in more engineering that's going to shape our future you see this now it was so on a slide yeah it's interesting though because your book does talk about how scientists and the military have worked together yes and that's what's been well-known for the traditional science feels like physics and chemistry but in my field you wouldn't think that we would have anything to do with it except we did and you go far enough back navigation was a fundamental activity of empire building but how do you know where you are on earth you get that from the sky right because we had we knew where what stars you would see in planets at different parts of the earth and so you would infer that where you were on earth from that and that's how you knew where's your enemy where's your new conquests where's the new land you're acquiring right and this is how empires were built hegemony was extended and move fast forward that to today the coordinates on earth still matter right the Air Force the US Space Command of Air Force put up GPS satellites and the Second Gulf War 2003 was a precision targeting war right we saw images where you bomb something in a black light down a chimney right down the chimney and all of this was enabled empowered by space assets that hadn't been put up so that we have common concerns the astrophysicists worries about and thinks about the universe so does the military as the next regime of high of high ground you see the universe is OK earth has some problems this week representatives from more than 130 countries are meeting in South Korea to discuss climate change there are many who think that's the most dangerous piece of the u.s. is becoming divorced from science is it's destabilizing it's so so a couple of things first I don't mind people arguing pol√≠tica on political lines what you do about climate change right ok do you put in carbon credits or tariffs on solar panels do you invest in your economy to transition those have political solutions but when I see politicians arguing over the objectively identified truths of science that you were just gonna lag behind the rest of the world that understands that by the way you're lagging behind two very important elements of modern life insurance companies know all about global warming and what its consequences are and so too does the military because if you have rising tide waters that rising storm waters that didn't use to get to those levels and you displace whole populations they become they become migrants they become refugees come refugees destabilizing the region the military knows all about this so you can have political posturing where you're ignoring it because if you get you get a vote straight for it but at the end of the day you cannot fool mother nature I thought you were a tweet response to the Trump administration tossing around the idea of a space force force was pretty remarkable you said that perhaps we should be thinking about I'm okay with a space force but what we need more most is a truth force one that defends against all enemies of accurate information both foreign and domestic it's just trying to put that out there by the way we have something such as that it's the National Academy of Sciences right they were chartered by Abraham Lincoln in 1863 clearly had other things on his plate at the time but he said we need science to help write the future governance of this nay he said liberty is dependent on science I was at the National Academy of Sciences on Monday discussing Internet security so yes there are lots of people who are still very devoted to this and you are one of them thank you so much hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our youtube
