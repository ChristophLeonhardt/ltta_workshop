SERIOUS QUESTION.

77
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:39,274

RONALD REAGAN HAD, WHERE THERE

79
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,343
ARE INSTANCES WHERE ONE OF THE

PARTIES THREATENED TO CALL IT

81
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:44,846
OFF?

82
00:02:44,846 --> 00:02:47,482
>> IN REYKJAVIK, THEY GOT UP AND

83
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,449
LEFT.

84
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,484
GENEVA, REYKJAVIK, AND

85
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:50,451
WASHINGTON, D.C., IN MOSCOW.

86
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:52,253
THE REASON THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT

87
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,889
IN MOSCOW IS IT'S THE FINAL ONE,

88
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,091
AND HE SPEAKS TO MOSCOW STATE

89
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:58,660
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ABOUT

90
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,894
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY, NOT

WORLD IN CAPITALISM.

108
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,053
>> TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

109
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:27,655
HE IS TRYING TO RECREATE THE

110
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,489
SOVIET UNION EXPANSIONISM.

111
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,458
MIKAEL GORBACHEV WAS A DIFFERENT

112
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,326
LEADER, AND REAGAN SAW THAT AND

113
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,895
THAT'S WHY HE NEGOTIATED WITH

114
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:34,862
HIM.

115
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:35,530
REAGAN AND GORBACHEV IN RED

116

SQUARE WHEN THEY ARE WALKING

117
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:38,399
AROUND.

118

MARLIN FITZWATER WHISPERS IN HIS

119
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:39,901

120
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,537
AROUND YOU, THEY ARE NOT

00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:42,904
CIVILIANS.

122
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,706
THEY ARE KGB OFFICERS.

123
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:47,175
ONE OF THEM WAS BELIEVED TO BE

124
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:51,045
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

125

00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,520
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

130
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,856

"KILLING THREE DAYS IN MOSCOW."

132

133
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,395
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT TRUMP'S

134
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:08,896
VISIT FOR THE PAGEANT.

135
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:14,836
>> Juan: WAIT A MINUTE.

136
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:15,370
[LAUGHTER]

137
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,873
KEEP IT CLEAN.

138
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:21,375

139
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,710
THRILLED WITH THIS INTERVIEW.

140
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,114

142
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:27,849
DAY.

143
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,884
WE DID A BLOCK ON THE

144
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:30,818
TRUMP TOWER MEETING WITH DON JR.

145
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,286
AND THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT CAME

146
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,488
OUT.

147
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,522
I'M CURIOUS IF SOME PEOPLE ARE

148
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:35,957
SAYING THERE IS STUFF IN HERE

149
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,125
THAT COULD CHANGE THE TIDE.

150
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,127
OTHERS SAYING IT WAS A BIG

151
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,495
NOTHING BURGER.

152
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,096
I THINK THAT WAS JESSE.

153
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:43,231
IS THERE ANYTHING NEW HERE?

154
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:46,267
>> I THINK WHAT DANA POINTED OUT

155
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,301
WITH THE MANAFORT NOTES, THE

156
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:48,469
NOTES IN THE MEETING.

157
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:49,804
I THINK DON JR., THERE'S A LOT

158
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:52,507
OF CALLS FOR HIM TO COME BACK

159
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,475
AND TESTIFY BECAUSE THERE IS

160
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,510
SOME HAZY MEMORY THERE.

161
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,880
AT THE SAME TIME, YOU LOOK AT

162
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,647
THIS "NEW YORK TIMES" PIECE

163
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,250
ABOUT OPERATION CROSS FIRE

164
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,051
HURRICANE AND DEEP IN MERITS AS

165
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:06,654
A YEAR LATER, THERE IS STILL NO

166
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,223
EVIDENCE OF THE TRUMP OFFICIALS

167
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,292
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA.

168
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:12,894
I THINK BOTH SIDES OF THIS

169
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,462
INVESTIGATION, WE HAVE A LOT TO

170
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,097
LEARN, AND WE ARE PROBABLY

171
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:19,867
MONTHS AWAY FROM THE END OF IT.

172
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:23,037
>> Greg: CAN I SAY THAT ON

173
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:25,473
BEHALF OF AMERICA, NO ONE CARES.

174
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,441
NO ONE CARES.

175
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:30,678
THE BEAR DOESN'T EVEN CARE.

176
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,846
>> Juan: A QUICK FOLLOW-UP.

177
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:34,348
SENATE INTEL COMES OUT AND SAYS

178
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:36,451
MUCH DIFFERENTLY THAN HOUSE

179
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,252
INTEL, OH, YEAH, RUSSIA

180
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:40,455
INTERFERED AND THEY FAVORED

181
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,489
TRUMP.

182
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:41,989
DOES THAT MATTER?

183
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:43,057
>> Bret: IT MATTERS THAT THEY

184
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:44,459
PUT IT OUT AND THEY WERE BACKING

185
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,896
UP THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN

186
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:49,864
A BIPARTISAN REPORT.

187
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:51,466
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE

188
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:51,999
SENATOR LANKFORD ON
