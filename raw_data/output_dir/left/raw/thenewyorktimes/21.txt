1
00:00:00,965 --> 00:00:03,860
Frogs are not known
for their beauty.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,660
But forget about the faces.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,510
Look at their leaps.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,970
They are spectacular jumpers.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,900
They leap up and across.

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,950
They can even jump in tandem.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,290
So what’s their secret?

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,450
Well, let’s look at a jump
and see the component parts.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,220
The legs, see
them pushing off?

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,130
That’s where the
power comes from.

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,210
And the spine?

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,850
It’s rigid,
straight, so the frog

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,390
doesn’t uncurl as it jumps.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,820
It unfolds, opening
at a hinge joint that

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,800
is unique to frogs.

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,190
That hinge — the
iliosacral joint,

17
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,200
to be technical — was
thought to be absolutely

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,290
necessary to the
evolution of frog jumping.

19
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,660
But a computer
simulation suggests

20
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,090
that jumping may
have evolved first

21
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,510
and the joint later to
improve their accuracy

22
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,460
and refine their jumps.

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,210
Understanding how that
works could help design

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,059
a prosthetic arm that has
both power and finesse.

25
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,350
Of course, there
are frogs that

26
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,690
take jumping to a
whole other level,

27
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,700
like the gliding tree frog.

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,290
It’s not flying, but it’s
certainly falling with style.

29
00:01:12,290 --> 00:00:00,000
