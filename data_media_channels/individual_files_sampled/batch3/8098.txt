AND GREG. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE FIVE" ." MEDIA BIAS EXPOSED. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE LEFT-WING MEDIA HATES PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT THIS NEXT STORY MIGHT BE ONE OF THEM ARE GROTESQUELY IRRESPONSIBLE EXAMPLES YET. DURING YESTERDAY'S SANCTUARY STATE ROUNDTABLE THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE DANGEROUS MS-13 GANG. WATCH. IF THEY DON'T REACH EIGHT CERTAIN THRESHOLD, I CANNOT TELL I.C.E. ABOUT THEM. WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO COME IN, OR STOPPING A LOT OF THEM. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD THESE PEOPLE ARE. THESE AREN'T PEOPLE. THESE ARE ANIMALS. WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AT A LEVEL AND RATE THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. Jesse: THE MAINSTREAM PRESS INCLUDING "THE NEW YORK TIMES," "USA TODAY," "WASHINGTON POST" AND OTHERS TOOK TRUMP OUT OF CONTEXT, SUGGESTING HE CALLED ALL OF THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ANIMALS, NOT JUST MS-13. THE MORNING PAPERS FLAT OUT MISLEADING READERS WITH HEADLINES LIKE THIS FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES." "TRUMP CALLS SOME UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRANTS ANIMALS IN RAMP." FROM "USA TODAY," "TRUMP CALLS UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE ANIMALS, RHETORIC WITH A DARK PAST." THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE OUTRAGEOUS REPORTS. YOU KNOW I AM REFERRING TO THE MS-13 GANGS THAT ARE COMING IN. I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MS-13 AND ALSO IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON THE TAPE, YOU WILL SEE WE HAVE LAWS. ONE MS-13 COMES IN AND OTHER GANG MEMBERS COMING, I REFER TO THEM AS ANIMALS. GUESS WHAT. I ALWAYS WILL. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT BY THE THOUSANDS. IT'S A BIG DANGEROUS JOB, AND THEY ARE ABLE IN SOME CASES TO COME BACK AND OR NEW GROUPS COME IN, ALSO FROM THE GANGS. Jesse: SARAH SANDERS ISSUING THIS EPIC TAKEDOWN OF THE LIBERAL TRUMP HEATING MEDIA. THE PRESIDENT WAS CLEARLY REFERRING TO MS-13 GANG MEMBERS. THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND WHOSE DEPORTATIONS ARE HAMSTRUNG BY OUR LAWS. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST VICIOUS AND DEADLY GANGS THAT OPERATE BY THE MOTTO OF "RAPE, KILL, CONTROL." I DON'T THINK THE TERM THE PRESIDENT USE WAS STRONG ENOUGH. MS-13 HAS DONE HEINOUS ACTS. IT TOOK AN ANIMAL TO STAB A MAN 100 TIMES, RIPPED HIS HEART OUT. IT TOOK AN ANIMAL TO KIDNAP, DRUGGED AND A 14-YEAR-OLD HOUSTON GIRL. I THINK THE TERM ANIMAL DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. Jesse: DAY NOW, THIS IS DEVASTATING FOR THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. THIS WASN'T A FEW OUTLETS. THESE WERE THE BIGGEST, MOST CREDIBLE MEDIA COMPANIES OUT THERE BOTCHING THING THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. Dana: IT GREW BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. I REMEMBER THERE WERE TIMES WHEN, AND EDITOR HERE IN NEW YORK WOULD WRITE A HEADLINE OR CHOOSE A PHOTO THAT WAS OUT OF CONTEXT AND YOU WOULD HAVE WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS OR LET'S CALL IT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS HYPOTHETICAL. THEY WOULD CALL UP AND SAY THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS SAYING. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS DOING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE. POSSIBLY COULD'VE HAPPENED BUT IT CAN HAPPEN SOON ENOUGH. SOME OF THE OUTLETS LIKE THE AP DELETED THE TWEET WHICH IS BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT IT DOES SHOW YOU THAT IMMEDIATELY THEY HEARD "ANIMAL" AND "IMMIGRANTS," I MAY PUT IT TOGETHER WITHOUT CONTEXT. I WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT IT, THE PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE. ED GILLESPIE WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, ONE OF HIS ISSUES WAS MS-13. "THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD SEVERAL HEADLINES. IF WE HAVE THEM, WE CAN SHOW YOU IF WE HAVE THEM, WE CAN SHOW YO YOU. BASICALLY DESCRIBING ED AS A RAPIST, POISONOUS. A MONTH LATER "THE WASHINGTON POST" ALL OF A SUDDEN HAD A CHANGE OF HEART ABOUT MS-13 IN THEIR HEADLINES. AFTER ED GILLESPIE LOSES THEY TALK ABOUT HOW I MISS 13 IS TERRIBLE. THEY ARE VIOLENCE. A COUPLE EXAMPLES. IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT THE MEDIA TENDS TO DEFEND MS-13 IN THE STRANGEST WAYS IN ORDER TO HURT A REPUBLICAN. IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE SET OF EVENTS. HERE'S THE THING. THIS HELPS TRUMP. Jesse: IT DOES. Dana: YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, HER HE CERTA END OF THE DAY, HER HE CERTN END OF THE DAY, HER HE CERTY WON. Jesse: SOME PEOPLE ON TWITTER SAYING EVEN MS-13 MEMBERS AREN'T ANIMALS. THEY ARE HUMANS. TAKING A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY. Greg: THEY HAD TO SHIFT, ONCE THE STORY FELL APART, THEY HAD TO FIND A NEW AVENUE. NOW THEY ARE DEFENDING A MURDEROUS GANG OF RAPISTS. MS-13 IS ANOTHER VICTIM CLASS. IF YOU GO AFTER THEM, YOU ARE THE BAD GUY. HOW DARE YOU JUDGE. THEY ARE JUST IT, THEY ARE LIKE A BOOK CLUB WITHOUT THE BOOKS. THIS IS THE LAUREL-YANNY EXPERIMENT WRIT LARGE. NORMAL PEOPLE HEARD WHAT THEY HEARD CORRECTLY WHICH WAS HE WAS REFERRING TO A GANG. THE MEDIA HEARD RACIST. IT IS THE LAUREL-YANNY EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE MISHEARING THIS ON PURPOSE. THIS ISN'T AN ACCIDENT. I GUESS MAYBE BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONFIRMATION BIAS THEY ARE SELECTIVELY HEARING SOMETHING. AND IN THE NECK STRATEGY IS, THEY KNOW THEY'RE WRONG, THEY KNOW THEY MADE A MISTAKE. THEY ARE GOING TO SAY IS TRUMP HAS SAID BAD THINGS BEFORE. HE WILL PROBABLY SAVE THEM AGAIN. SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT THEY ARE WRONG HERE. THAT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT THEY'VE USED DEFENDING HATE CRIMES. THE RACIST GRAFFITI WAS FAKE BUT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE COUNTRY IT IS REAL. IT'S THE LAST ARGUMENT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TWO DEFEND IT. IT'S GOING TO BE HILARIOUS. I WILL GIVE TIME TO OTHER PEOPLE I WILL GIVE TIME TO OTHER PEOPL PEOPLE. Jesse: AS SARAH SANDERS MENTIONED ENDED A VERY GOOD JOB OF MENTIONING, THE AMOUNT OF HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY MS-13, KIMBERLY. YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. I DON'T SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATS CAN EVEN GO NEAR AGAIN LIKE THAT. Kimberly: ABSOLUTELY. OVER THE YEARS, WORKING AT A GET AS A GANG CRIME SPECIALIST. THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF MEDIA BIAS EXPOSED. YOU SEE A SITUATION LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF VITRIOL THAT THEY HAVE AND THE ANGST AND UPSET TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR AND THEY TRIED TO SAY IT'S A SITUATION WHERE HE IS BEING RACIST TALKING ABOUT THIS. I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT TOOK A FAR ENOUGH SAYING ANIMALS. WHEN YOU SEE THEIR HANDIWORK AND YOU SEE THE CRIME SCENE AND YOU SEE PHOTOS OF ME TALKED THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF MS-13 AND THEY ARE COMMITTING HEINOUS ATROCITIES SHOWING NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE. USE OF THE MACHETE. THEY LOVE TO PUT NAILS ON BASEBALL MASTER BEAT PEOPLE TO DEATH. THE YOUNG GIRL, TEENAGER WHO THEY FELT DISRESPECTED COME. THAT GANG LEADERS SHRINE TO A DEMON. FAMILY MEMBERS NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THE STATE OF THEIR BODIES THAT THEY ARE LEFT IN. NOT EVEN ANIMALS. WILD ANIMALS EVEN BEHAVE LIKE THIS. WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING, HE WAS SAYING RESPECT FOR VICTIMS, RESPECT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND A FLAT OUT, SAYING I HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED, AND I LOOK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Jesse: JUAN, YOU'VE WORKED IN THE MAINSTREAM PRINT MEDIA BEFORE. ANY EXCUSE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS? IS IT SLOPPINESS OR IS IT SOMETHING MORE? Juan: YEAH, IT IS CALLED ACCURACY. Jesse: WALL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN ABOUT THAT? Juan: IT'S ACCURATE. YOU ARE FEEDING THEIR GRIEVANCES ON THE RIGHT BY SAYING THE TERRIBLE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, HOW COULD THEY SAY SOMETHING SO AWFUL. THEY MISINTERPRETED THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW WHAT, THE PRESIDENT CALLED PEOPLE ANIMALS. AND THEN YOU SAY OH, NO, NO, IT WASN'T PEOPLE. HE WAS REFERRING TO THE HANNIBAL LECTORS OF THE WORLD, MS-13 GANG. YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE AS ANIMALS. I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE OR WHO THEY ARE. YOU DO NOT BECOME A MONSTER BY DEMONIZING YOUR OPPONENT. HOLD ON. I WANT TO FINISH. I THINK THEY ARE TERRIBLE BUT Greg: YOU CALLED THEM TERRIBLE! HOW INSULTING ARE YOU! HOW DARE YOU CALL THEM TERRIBLE? IT'S HURTFUL. Juan: I CALL YOU HILARIOUS. HERE'S THE THING. YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO THIS COUNTRY WHO AREN'T WHITE ARE COMING FROM S-WHOLE COUNTRIES. YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT BOOK COMING FROM MEXICO. MURDERERS, RAPISTS. THIS IS THE KIND OF EXCUSE YOU HERE FROM THE RIGHT WING ECHO CHAMBER. I AM TELLING YOU. YOU GUYS ARE TRUMP APOLOGISTS TODAY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT. Greg: OH. Jesse: YOU ARE A FAKE NEWS APOLOGIST, JUAN. TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT? Dana: Juan: YOU LOVED TO MAKE IMMIGRANTS INTO EVIL BECAUSE IT FIRES UP TRUMP'S FACE. Jesse: WE ARE NOT CONFLATING MS-13 WITH IMMIGRANTS CONFLATING MS-13 WITH IMMIGRANT IMMIGRANTS. Kimberly: DID YOU HEAR WHAT DANA SAID? Greg: THIS LAUREL-YANNY THING WHICH YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT HERE IS JUAN HERE'S YANNY WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY LAUREL. Kimberly: I HEARD LAUREL. Greg: IT'S A VALUABLE LESSON ON THE HELP WE LEARN FROM IT. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, SOMETHING CHRIS HAYES DID FROM MSNBC WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY ADMIRABLE. TRUMP WAS TALKING TO PARALYMPIC ATHLETES AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO WATCH THEM PERFORM BUT HE FOUND IT HARD. THERE WAS A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SAID HOW DISGUSTING IT WAS THAT HE WAS SAYING HOW HARD IT WAS TO WATCH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PERFORM. ACTUALLY WHAT HE WAS SAYING IS IT'S HARD TO WATCH BECAUSE HE IS BUSY. AS THE PRESIDENT, IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS OR PARALYMPICS. CHRIS HAYES ORIGINALLY TWEETED OUT THAT THIS WAS DISGUSTING. HE WANTED AGAIN WATCHED IT AGAIN. HE SAID I WAS WRONG. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SCHEDULE. IF PEOPLE GO AND LISTEN, IT'S OBVIOUS HE IS TALKING ABOUT A HE IS CALLING THEM ANIMALS. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN THAT MAY BE THEY HAVE TO STEP OUT OF THEIR OWN DELUSIONS, THEIR OWN EMOTIONS AND RELIES THAT YOUR INITIAL RESPONSE IS INCORRECT. Juan: DO YOU THINK ANYONE WHO IS A CRIMINAL IS AN ANIMAL? Greg: I THINK THAT'S INSULTING TO ANIMALS. BY THE WAY, WE ARE ALL ANIMALS. Juan: I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUDGED GUILTY OF CRIMES LATER RETURN AND WE WANT THEM TO WE DON'T SAY THEY ARE ANIMALS. Greg: THEY ARE NOT, ARE NOT THESE ANIMALS? Juan: I LIKE WHAT GREG SAID. CHRIS HAYES. I THINK PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. REMEMBER WHEN THE DOCTOR KING STATUE THEY SAY WAS REMOVED FROM THE OVAL OFFICE AND THEY HAD TO CORRECTED. PEOPLE IN MEDIA MAKE MISTAKES BUT THIS IS NO MISTAKE. Dana: IT HAPPENS THE OTHER WAY TOO. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS BUT THE CORRESPONDENT ON CNN. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A GRAPHIC. SAYING THAT THEY PUT A TARGET OVER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SAYING NO, I DIDN'T BUT IT HAD ALREADY GONE HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD. IT HAPPENS ON BOTH SIDES. Greg: IT IS JUST WORSE ON THEIR SIDES. Jesse: THEY ARE GETTING ALL OF THESE NEWS STORIES WRONG.
