so there was a story out right before the election about how three white supremacists were going to do a bombing in which terrorist bombing in fact the FBI charged them with wanting to explode a weapon of mass destruction now some of you might have seen this story if you were watching The Young Turks or reading outlets that cared to have real coverage most of you probably haven't seen this because the three terrorists involved were white so we don't you know generally panic about that on cable news and and so you might and certainly the president doesn't talk about it no politicians generally talk about it so it just it just gets buried right well there's an update to that story today and it is an interesting one so if you don't remember this story they were going to bring in trucks filled with explosives and put them around an apartment building with Somali immigrants and that was because they're Muslim and they were going to show them you know that they can't push us around so they were gonna do terrorism against the Muslims but those particular Muslims hadn't done anything but this is how the small-minded people in America and across the world think oh me know do new US Muslim bad should I find out who the actual terrorist is no no Muslim bad must do something about Muslim so these guys thought well oh I got a night great idea Muslims must be bad so and why are they bad because of terrorism okay so they're ironic idea was let's do terrorism against them let's blow them up in the middle of Kansas not in Somalia in the middle of Kansas so they were caught thank God and the FBI did wonderful work there and there's an update to that story today so let me go to the Associated Press for that Gavin right Patrick Stein and Curtis Allen are charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy against civil rights for allegedly planning to detonate truck bombs in a meatpacking town of Garden City the day after November 2016 election right also faces a charge of lying to the FBI now these geniuses thought that Hillary Clinton gonna win and the Donald Trump was going to be robbed oh that's another conspiracy theory on the right that didn't turn out to be true we're the FEMA camps we're the fema camps there are no FEMA camps either there was all these lunatic right-wing conspiracy theories and it unfortunately led people to do some terrible things so they thought okay we'll show Hillary Clinton when she wins we'll blow up these Muslims murder them all and then as one of the conspirators said we'll get their attention with quote a bloodbath okay well well they're asking for something unique today as their trial is about to get started three men accused of plotting to bomb a mosque and an apartment complex housing Somali refugees asked a federal judge Friday to include prospective jurors from rural western Kansas because they are twice as likely to have voted for a president Donald Trump now wait a minute I thought Donald Trump was against terrorism but it is the belief of these three terrorists that Donald Trump voters don't mind terrorism if it's white terrorism against Muslims now to be fair to the Donald Trump voters in Kansas we don't know that that's true that's what these three terrorists are hoping for so but it is an interesting story that we actually do have terrorists in America and that Donald Trump has not tweeted about them has not gotten a rampage about them has not made national headlines about them it's not that big a deal to them and now those guys think well Trump voters are more likely to excuse terrorism that's their belief that's what they're arguing for please give me jurors that voted for Donald Trump because I think they're more likely to be okay with terrorism as long as it is white people right wing people doing the terrorism against innocent Muslims they think and I don't know they might have some basis for this belief they need Trump voters are going to think not so bad not guilty that's what they're hoping for they also argue the case will require jurors to weigh whether the alleged conduct constitutes a crime or whether it is constant constitutionally protected speech and assembly and the right to bear arms who knows maybe if they get those Trump voters they'll think well I mean yeah I got a right to bear trunks full of explosives now is that that's what we're stretching the Second Amendment to now trucks full of explosives does do Muslims have that right here in America do black people have that right here in America I'd hope not but now right wing saying I got to walk around with explosives ready to blow up innocent civilians and that's my right to bear arms look I don't think these are going to work okay but you never know I mean we've had a lot of insane acquittals in this country just as long as the people on that jury felt like they identified with the defendant and constitutionally protected speech yeah your speech ends at the end of a bomb okay I know the right-wing likes to say free speech free speech I'm allowed to hate everybody I'm allowed to hate blacks Muslims Latinos gays I'm on a hate damn I know you are in it's and I defend that right of yours of Adams you don't have a right to bomb them or murder them that is a different thing and oftentimes unfortunately they they don't understand that so these guys are going to go on trial soon I hope that the judge will reject their demands for hateful people that they think might excuse terrorism they should just get a jury of their peers wherever they are and be done with that they don't get to in my opinion pick a jury of their peers if they think there's enough right wing lunatics in Kansas who are gonna say that it's okay to innocent to murder innocent Muslims in the middle of Kansas they should not be allowed to do that and I hope that they face the justice that they richly deserve and whatever the consequence of that in Kansas might be if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs join
