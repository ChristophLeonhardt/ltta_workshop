are you gonna be going to speak to House Democrats absolutely not why because it's been closed down by Chairman Nunez I think that the if you look at this request that Schiff made the ranking member it's overly broad even asked me for all the documents that I gave the special counsels office he's more than special counsels more than welcome to give them to chef but if you notice the Senate didn't ask me for those the Senate's request if you compare it was extremely narrow in scope what do they want to know they want to know and I'll read it - it's right here it's very look you can read its communications or records of communications between you and Roger stone that relate to Russia a Russian persons organizations interest or WikiLeaks Julian Assange DC leaks kusa Fuhrer John Podesta between June 16 2015 and January 2017 they asked me to preserve other documents including what I gave the special counsels office I think you've already come on TV and said you're not gonna comply with the special counsel and then complied with the special counsel they have that documentation you're gonna go see the Senate why come on TV to announce that you're not gonna go talk to Adam because I think that this is I think that this issue and this shows why chairman Nunez was right to wind up the housing investigation I think that this shows that it's overly broad what Schiff asked for he wants to continue this into perpetuity and it's frankly a waste of taxpayer time to to even draft something like this what is here's a guy who says that Rosenstein shouldn't give his memo about the Muller investigation explaining the scope of it he shouldn't give that to chairman Nunez but he wants me to give all the information has a history of leaking things you say that I don't know that I think Schiff has a history of leaking things well there's more than well why is this over broad this is over broad we'll compare it to the Senate why would the Senate one talks about Russia and Russian persons which is because once again because once again sir he asked me to give him everything that I've given Muller why does he need everything I've given Muller if he can get it from Muller Walden white I don't want to give it to mother okay okay anyway something else I you don't have to until he have subpoena power again if the Democrats retake the house which I probably won't know which we don't know yet we see what happened I want to talk to you Sam about non-disclosure agreements you signed one when you join the Trump Organization right correct and I was sued why talk to me about the non-disclosure agreements who signs them in the Trump Organization well I can just go over what I had okay and how I want with me so I never had an NDA with the president when I worked for then mr. Trump from around 2011 to around late 2014 when I was brought in a permanent basis and I was the first permanent hire despite what others will say for the campaign he then gave me an NDA and I saw you generally signs NDA's who genuinely thought I believe all I would to guess all full-time employees and contractors that are devoting a 100% of their time to him but but also I don't know that for a fact all I know is in my experience in in your experience at the Trump Organization did you ever hear about NDA's being used for people who were not standard employees of the Trump Organization I didn't be but they'll tell you why because I didn't ask for things like that if I didn't need to know I wouldn't ask how they could have been I just don't know what people do you think of sign non-disclosure agreements in the Trump Organization or in the in Trump's world how many will do you think well I certainly I would certainly think that everybody that worked on the 26 on the 24th floor as full-time employees signed NDA's I couldn't give you a good estimate on how many others did I'm sure people that worked on apprenticed in I'm sure people that worked on Miss Universe did is we know I'm sure people that worked at properties could have but that's once again let me say so I'm not called back in conjecture so that would number in the hundreds of people if not more it could sure what about like the doorman at the building if they signed on to I would have no idea everybody entering into any sort of contract with Donald Trump would they be subject to a nondisclosure agreement maybe maybe not it depends on what kind it depends on what they were doing right I mean it's not a nondisclosure agreement I'm not sure because that's a pretty broad question and stuff I don't know legally legally speaking and having prosecutors view agreements like that well the grand jury power supersedes any non-disclosure agreement so they are not a bar to getting the information that that mr. number might have even if he had signed a nondisclosure agreement so it's not really relevant to much to what Bob Muller is doing or perhaps at the Southern District and Michael Cohen's investigation is anybody worried that all of the non-disclosure agreements that are out there with this organization and with with the stormy Daniel stuff that's hanging over the President's head and with the other hush money payments that could be out there that maybe this president is is open to something as serious as blackmail and on a much broader scale well I don't think he'd be open to black I mean what's a stormy Daniels came to him and said I want to tell the public about the fact that we had a one-night affair and you gave me one hundred and thirty thousand dollars big deal now blackmail in terms it could be for any politician if anything happened on foreign soil I have no reason to believe that it did so that could be what you're referencing I don't think that there is an issue if he had non-disclosures with other women it would be politically embarrassing perhaps perhaps it wouldn't but is it something to be used over him no did you ever hear the president talk about more hush money agreements or more contracts to silence other women I'm not going to talk about that one way or the other well you were asked by the grand jury about that were you I was and that's a sealed testimony so but you can you it sealed the testimony I don't say whatever you said I couldn't I'm not oh I got a lot to know that's whatever he wants he gets my fingle I can answer I don't I no longer have subpoena but I would tell you here's what I would tell you is I would tell you as I've said on record this is one reason why Adams I'm not going to give them all the information I gave Robert Muller because it's really he doesn't need it Jeff is they did discuss everything concerning and I gave testimony in the grand jury everything concerning Roger stone and what Roger told me in terms of Julian Assange once again as I have said they asked me what I knew about situations like that yeah and that's all all going and you have answered them I've 100% answered them and I would say like I'm just asking yes dude and does the president know of hush money payments to other women I guess so sure you would get so or do you know I don't know I don't know for a fact that you think I never reviewed anything so I don't know if you talked about it I don't have discussed that Sam done Berg thank you very much let us know what happens with Adam Schiff you can ask him because I'm not even going to contact him hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
