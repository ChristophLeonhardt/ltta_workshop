excited well for many people the answer

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,250
is no we're not excited because on the

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,870
one hand the prospect of a trump

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,720
presidency is somewhat terrifying but

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,240
also both candidates are despised by a

that Donald Trump was given a real

allowed Democrats to be more

or just obsessed with immigration it's

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,130
just highly irresponsible when you

categorize and label voters in

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,690
patronizing ways you only chip away at

the small amount of trust the public has

left in today's political and media

101

the much bigger waves coming over the

110

one of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> establishment candidates</font>

112

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,409
to get those people on side I probably

129
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,120
wouldn't confront them with things like

135
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,640

136

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">the answer is quite simple he honestly</font>

163
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,910
if you want the support of millions of

164
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,650
progressives you're going to have to

165
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,600
earn their vote they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font>

166
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,910
to fall in line and more importantly

167
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,670
they wanted to send a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say we</font>

168
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,230
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forget the promises you have</font>

169
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,660
made during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primaries and we will</font>

170
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,220
definitely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget the actions you</font>

171
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,380
took to hinder the Bernie Sanders

172
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,030
campaign now move it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking for</font>

173
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,530
someone to blame and there's emigrants

174
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,390

<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy generally remains me off it amazed</font>

179
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,490
me watching Colombo at my granny<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I</font>

180
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,910
was we Colombo they'd show you the mud

181
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,910
that in the pre credit sequence it

182
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't who's done it it was a bit</font>

183
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,590
Colombo proven it again at it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

184

halfway through my<font color="#CCCCCC"> granted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always go I</font>

185

think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was her name</font>

186
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,750
this show Jim do never<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking people me</font>

187
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,790
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly the same thing while</font>

188
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">staring I think it's always polish</font>

189
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,850
country in the corner thankfully we now

190
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,590
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of voters who use</font>

191
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,510
technology to broaden their worldview

192
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,450
and a percentage of whom use it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold</font>

193
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the powerful to account these are the</font>

194
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,200
kinds of people that don't buy into the

195
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,840
simplicity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tribal politics they care</font>

196
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,010
about ideas integrity and accountability

197
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,170
so saying things like I have better

198
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,180
policies and a better track record than

199
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,880
Donald<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump is just not good enough we</font>

200
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,400
are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in dangerous territory we</font>

201
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
have one candidate who preaches fear

202
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,570
about what America is and we have a

203
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,150
candidate who vocalizes fear about what

204
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,400
America could become as a climate of

205
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,890
fear generates apathy and it causes

206
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,990
people to betray their own interests

207
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,440
from both sides I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't stand</font>

208
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,660
Donald Trump but i can't stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> hillary</font>

209
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">clinton</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / but they are not the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same you</font>

210
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,550
don't win over the hearts and minds of

211
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,590
most people with fear or by telling

212
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,200
people what to do you need to inspire

213
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and be convincing which is exactly what</font>

214
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,790
the Hillary Clinton campaign need to do

215
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,190
by showing a commitment towards

216
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,830
progressive policies and values not just

217
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,930
through words but through actions as

218
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,850
well because the Democratic party

219
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:26,550
platform is non-binding and Tim Kaine

220
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Clinton's VP choice is questionable so</font>

221
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,380
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two main concerns</font>

222
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,380
about this election cycle one that there

223
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a real risk of divisions taking place</font>

224
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,890
among people who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fighting</font>

225
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">alongside each other for particular</font>

226
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,880
causes they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking for common</font>

227
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,979
ground and common purpose and working

228
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,880
together but my second concern is that

229
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,130
people are therefore afraid to be

230
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,950
intellectually honest about calling out

231
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,440
corruption or failings with political

232
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,089
candidates or institutions when they see

233
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:59,990
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and being intellectually honest and</font>

234
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,330
finding unity shouldn't be mutually

235
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,760
exclusive there is a balance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

made so thank you so much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font>
