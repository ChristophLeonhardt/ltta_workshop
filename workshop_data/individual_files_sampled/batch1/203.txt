they've come from Eastern Goethe slowly perhaps hesitantly most definitely but glad to be out and worried about those they've left behind we all know we were about 200 people living in a cellar without light or electricity and very little food it was impossible to leave because of the events many people decided to leave and head to Duma and only 40 of us stayed behind in that cellar we decided not to leave until the Syrian army entered the city usually my children would tell me dad we don't want to die whenever they tell me this I'd cry tears of blood and pray to God to make me die before them others have been bussed out of the area after the group Jaysh al-islam reached an agreement with the United Nations the Russians and others around a thousand people need to leave for medical treatment the first batch of around a hundred have no left today it has been agreed to take those who want to go to Damascus or even abroad to be treated and returned back once again to Goethe the first batch consisting of around 40 families have left to Damascus for treatment the UN and the Red Crescent were there new batches of sick people will follow for treatment outside Goethe the agreement to get injured people out of Eastern Goethe has been around for a little while the fact that the process is actually started will give encouragement to the United Nations who would obviously like to see the numbers increase in the coming days the fighting continues around the Enclave which has now been split in three by Syrian government forces backed by the Russians it may not be as fierce as recent days but that's little consolation to those still trapped inside Alan Fisher al Jazeera on the turkey-syria border
