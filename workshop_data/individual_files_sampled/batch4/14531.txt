remember how the progressives have long lecture does that making mention of someone's weight as akin to fat shaming and that's practically akin to racism well apparently there's someone you can fat shame in America with impunity can you possibly guess who it is so apparently Donald Trump is borderline obese and apparently he doesn't exercise all that much indeed check out what Tonya Basu had to say in The Daily Beast after giving her readers a detailed list of the president's physical statistics quote Trump is in crappy shape and could use a diet or he's in danger of dying from heart disease or a stroke which ever comes first end quote now is it just me or do you detect a measure of Glee and Tanya's pithy prose when it comes to the potential mortal danger Trump allegedly faces after all Trump now weighs weight for folks three whole pounds more than he did at this time last year that's right almost 1.4 kilograms for all you metric fans out there yeah Trump is 6 foot 3 and tips the scales at 239 pounds but you want to know something by American standards and I'm referencing those photos from people of walmart calm here those stats practically make Trump resemble skinny mini but that's not the point however here's the point could you possibly imagine conservatives mocking Hillary Clinton for being a bit plump I can already hear the cries of misogyny and of course the cries of fat shaming to the left has been stating for several years now one must never mock someone's weight that would be rude that would be crude it might even be culturally insensitive indeed remember the rent of Jill Andrew in this space many moons ago she's the anti body shaming Crusader who inexplicably lashed out at a very classy ad campaign for the Toronto Transit Commission that featured images of performers with the National Ballet of Canada you see Jill was actually triggered by images of physically fit dancers here's what she said in a Toronto Star article quote the body types of most ballet dancers did not adequately represent those of most Canadians and I dare say most TTC users end quote so indirectly the TTC and the National Ballet of Canada were fat shaming people like Jill and as Jill duly noted at the TED talks a while back she deplores society's ongoing thin epidemic I have come to see now just how fat and black embodiment how excessive fatness and blackness make some people uncomfortable especially those who are born and raised on the milk and honey the Western comforts of your eccentric and FinCEN tricked body and beauty ideals oh by the way why does Jill bring race into the equation why is it always about race even when it isn't about race however it should be noted that Jill does have some handy tips for combating Eurocentric fat shaming one of the tips is when I get out of the shower buck naked I just stand there and say in my best Broadway voice I'm a big bright shining star and I'm gonna shine forever he ice at any event are we now witnessing a new and not so improved 2018 leftist narrative that trump is simply too fat to govern properly if so then it's deja vu all over again I recall how the leftist lunatics comprising the toronto media party went on a journalistic jihad against Toronto Mayor Rob Ford some five years ago check out this incredible moment of gotcha journalism from the Toronto Star which published a photo of Merritt Ford exiting wait for it a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet this story actually read on page one what a scandal it was as though his honor was frequenting a house of ill repute but whether we're talking about the late great mayor Ford of the current President Trump the hatred on the left for such individuals is nothing short of visceral bottom line folks looks like the new normal is this fat shame is bad unless the target of fat shaming is someone who is right-of-center in which case fat shaming is jolly good indeed G you have to wonder how the left doesn't choke when chowing down upon such a finger lickin heap and helping of hypocrisy for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks if you like that rant why not consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel commentary you
