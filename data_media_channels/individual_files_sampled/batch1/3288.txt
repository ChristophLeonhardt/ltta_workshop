lots of excellent questions this morning starting with a very important and big win which is how do I invest and how do I think you should invest this is a longer question and I'm going to devote a special series of videos to it next week to explain really why but the answer is that I after going through Wall Street learning a ton while i was on Wall Street about stock picking and how lots of professional investors work and so forth then spending a lot of time off Wall Street thinking about the best ways for individuals to invest not professionals ultimately came to the conclusion that there is a right answer for the vast majority of individual investors and that is to own a portfolio often rebalanced of low-cost tax efficient index funds and so that's what I do it's a long answer as to why that is but the short answer is that the simple math will tell you that the majority of investors will underperform the market because the market is the average once you add the costs of investing and those costs include the cost that you're paying your mutual fund manager or the time you're spending watching Jim Cramer or the time you're spending research and so forth you include all those costs tremendously hard to be in that small percentage of investors who actually outperform the market and I think that the general mistake that most individuals make is they vastly underestimate how hard it is to do that there are some individuals who over time have outperformed the market but it is extraordinarily difficult and please never forget that your competition is the equivalent of the Super Bowl team you are playing directly against them when you try to beat the market you don't have to do that you can just say I'm going to own the market I'm going to rebalance if you do it in a discipline way you can take all the emotion out of it ultimately over the long term study after study has suggested that that's a much smarter way of investing than trying to pick a mutual fund or trying to pick stocks but these are long questions I'll get into those in detail next week is the recession really ending it certainly seems to be which is great surprise a lot of people i am still skeptical i think there is a good chance that we do go into a double-dip recession i think the stimulus is at a lot the free money has added a lot I think the Fed is going to get into a position here where they really are in a bind on whether they should pull the free money and try to kill this asset inflation that we're getting in the stock market or whether they keep it down and try to solve the unemployment problem which is obviously tremendous and I think that's going to put them in a bind so I think the best case scenario as I see it is a muddle through economy possibly a double-dip but obviously the market is telling us that we're going to have a v-shape recovery a lot of respect for what the market is telling us so hopefully the market is right that will be the case but I'm still skeptical about that does megan mcardle work here now we wish we love megan megan mcardle but megan mcardle is at the atlantic we're going to do more and more of these exchanges where we're lucky enough to have contributors from the outside putting their stuff on the site occasionally we include a lot of links back to Megan's pieces of the Atlantic and others but you will see Megan on the site and you can comment here or comment there but we're happy to have her somebody asked if Conan is the new Oprah are you the new Drudge that's a good question I've never thought about that way Drudge is still the old Drudge by the way he we had a link from drives the other day and it's just an absolutely huge traffic fire hose so one could do a lot worse than being the new Drudge so maybe I should aim for that when are you going to add a lot more cool new features to the site we in fact there were some great questions this morning about specific features and what we should be doing a lot of it came down to can we have news and opinion instead of luzon which is what we give you a lot of we have some good solutions i think in the works for that but more generally what i want to do next week is actually open up a thread in a discussion where we can really all talk about what's best for the site how we should modify it going forward what you want to see what we think we can do so we'll have a special session next week where we talk on the site and then in a video about the improvements that you would like to see us make over time but we're grateful that you like what you see so far and thrilled that you're spending your time with us so have a great weekend see you next week
