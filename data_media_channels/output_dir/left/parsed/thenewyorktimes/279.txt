Highpoint Church
at all of our locations,
Everybody watching online,
I want you to know
that we love you
in an incredible way.
And we are sincerely
sorry
for any dishonor —
As a kid growing
up in the church,
I really looked up to
the church leaders.
If you’re a guest, I’m
very sorry that you’re
having to hear about
a difficult subject.
But I do pray —
These were the
people to emulate.
Only love covers a
multitude of sins.
Andy is going to come and
share with us at this time.
The only apology, if you
can even call it that,
was when he ran out of the
truck screaming, oh my god.
Oh my god.
What have I done?
You have to take this
to the grave with you.
Love you.
I’m going to sit,
if that’s all right.
Forgive me that I’m going
to read something to you.
That is not my normal flow.
I called my mom and
asked her if it was OK
if Andy gave me a ride home.
And she said yes.
I want to read
this partly to make
sure I say what I
intended to say,
and also to help me get
through what I need to say.
He passed the turn
to go to my house.
And I honestly
thought we were going
to TCBY to get frozen yogurt.
I don’t want reading this
to minimize anything.
I’ve never wanted
to minimize anything
about what’s taken place.
Then he turned down a dark
dirt road off the main road.
As a college student
on staff at a church
in Texas more than
20 years ago —
I just remember him
unzipping his pants
and asking me if I
would suck his dick.
If I would give him a blow job.
I regretfully had
a sexual incident
with a female high school
senior in the church.
I looked up to him.
I trusted him.
So when he asked
me to do that,
I thought,
this must mean
he loves me.
This is a man of
God I look up to.
I apologized and
sought forgiveness
from her, her parents, her
discipleship group, the church
staff, and the
church leadership.
What happened was a crime.
This is not something
that the church
should handle internally.
I remember asking, well,
what’s going to happen now?
And they just said that
the church would handle it.
Andy Savage was still teaching.
In agreement with
wise counsel,
I took every step to
respond in a biblical way.
And I’m just aching
inside because nobody’s
doing anything.
Once I had told more people,
then they had to act.
I resigned from ministry and
moved back home to Memphis.
I accepted full
responsibility for my actions.
Andy was allowed to
go before the church
and basically say that
he had made a mistake
and that it was time
for him to move on.
I did not attend that
service, nor did I
attend the going-away party that
they had for him afterwards.
I was and remain very
remorseful for the incident
and deeply regret the pain
I caused her and her family,
as well as the pain I caused
the church and God’s kingdom.
People were celebrating him,
and showering him with love,
and telling him how
much they’ll miss him.
And here I am struggling.
I further disclosed this
incident to Chris Conlee
before coming on
staff at Highpoint
and have shared with key leaders
throughout my tenure here.
This incident was dealt
with in Texas 20 years ago.
He calls it an incident.
He brings up how it was 20
years ago so many times.
When this happened
20-plus years ago,
I did everything I knew to do
under the counsel I was given
to cooperate with those
involved, to repent of my sins,
take responsibility for my
actions, and seek forgiveness.
I never sought to cover this up.
Because nobody was saying the
severity of what had happened,
I was being blamed.
It was, in their eyes,
a consensual sexual sin.
In hindsight, I see that more
could have been done for Jules.
I am truly sorry
more was not done.
Until now, I did
not know there was
unfinished business with Jules.
So today, I say, Jules, I am
deeply sorry for my actions
20 years ago.
We as a church of all places
should be getting this right.
It’s unfathomable to me that
the secular world, Hollywood,
are taking a stand.
The church should have
been the first group
to stand up and say,
we will not allow this.
My repentance over
this sin 20 years ago
was done believing that
God’s forgiveness is
greater than any sin.
And I still believe that.
Amen.
I want our churches to change
how they handle sexual assault
and sexual abuse in the church.
It’s a crime, not
just a sexual sin.
For any painful
memories or fresh wounds
this has created for
anyone, I am sorry.
And I humbly ask for
your forgiveness.
I love you all very much.
