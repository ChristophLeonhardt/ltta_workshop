it's not just rowdy rally audiences who want Trump to win a Nobel Peace Prize South Korea's president moon actually said that the president deserves this award as well now according to a blue house official moon said President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize what we need is only peace now this is not the first time that president moon has talked about this in January moon said Trump deserves big credit for bringing about the inter-korean talks it could be a resulting work of the us-led sanctions and pressure he's talking about some of the sanctions that President Trump enacted to close a lot of the loopholes that North Korea uses in trade specifically ship-to-ship and registering their ships and china to exchange coal and oil now this came about when the lee hee-ho who is the widow of late South Korean president Kim dae-jung in which she said that moon deserved to win the prize following some of these peace talks with North Korea so in response when she said he deserves the prizes like no president Trump deserves the prize and so I think at first take were like oh he's being so humble but honestly I mean as we've talked about the South Korean government needs the u.s. s support and they need the US government's and military's support in order to broker this peace treaty because of the amount of troops I mean there's 40,000 troops in just in the 38th parallel right now they need that support to then move forward with this peace and so what I think he's doing is a little bit of a stroke of the ego which he knows it's gonna work with President Trump they're both kind of crediting the start of this to President Trump and if it works out it's not what I was gonna say is first of all that Hannah's right it's sort of obvious to us looking in that they're just trying to go wow you deserve the Nobel Peace Prizes you bring peace to the Korean Peninsula peace peace peace remember peace remember all the prizes you can win by getting us peace that's better than warn you mr. president remember that's really where they're coming from is so shiny it's like a reminder mr. Trump you will receive adulation on a worldwide scale if you bring about peace and bring these parties together and denuclearize this situation it was a way I thought it sort of Internet it's a way that they were clearly trying to bring Trump along to be recognized in this process because clearly that's the thing that's most important to Trump we see it as obvious but it may work the obvious does work with this guy I know when you think about the fact that they're suggesting that somebody who said he was going to enact fire and fury and called kim jeong-hoon you know little rocket man and said he had a bigger button and then they're like yeah he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize man I mean it seems a little bizarre there's no Gandhi that's for sure but I like like we were talking about like like if these sanctions have led to you know the the conversation between South Korea and North Korea and if they do lead to a peace treaty great decisions is that a journey matter so much as the destination right if it happens during his time as president and it happens and they're both kind of acknowledging him regardless of the reason why does it deserve any massive credit and yeah hey go for two and get us out of Syria no I'm there a lot of places we could it's like he doesn't know the difference in China and we could get world peace I mean it'd be pretty amazing yeah two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
