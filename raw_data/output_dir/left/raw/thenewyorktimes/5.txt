1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,075
Florida.

2
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:02,820
Singing: “Sunshine
and sea breeze,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,237
soft sand and palm trees.”

4
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:08,270
Retirement mecca,
party central, Little Haiti,

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,280
Little Havana —

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,560
a state with elections
so close, they’re legendary.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,710
And in 2018, Florida is
living up to its reputation,

8
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,510
with a tight
governor’s race catering

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,010
to political extremes.

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,950
A lefty mayor
from Tallahassee —

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,260
“Are y’all ready to flip
Florida blue —”

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,655
versus a Trump-loving
former congressman.

13
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,430
“Make America great again.”

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,990
The result could
be a litmus test

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,330
for where the state, and
maybe even the country,

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,340
are headed in 2020.

17
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,020
So, who are the candidates?

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,480
This is the Democrat,
Mayor Andrew Gillum.

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,490
He pulled off a surprise
victory in the primary,

20
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,585
beating out six
other candidates.

21
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,515
“My wife refers to
me as Seabiscuit.”

22
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:46,060
Gillum’s got that
made-for-media

23
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,810
inspiring back story.

24
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,490
He’s one of
seven kids, the first

25
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,680
to graduate from
high school and college,

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,930
and he was the youngest
person ever elected

27
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,270
to the Tallahassee
City Commission.

28
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,640
Gillum could be Florida’s
first black governor.

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
He’s become a bit
of a national star,

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,799
even securing cartoon
cameos in music videos.

31
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,755
But he’s also wrapped up
in some controversies:

32
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:10,355
“An ongoing corruption probe,
since you’ve been mayor.”

33
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,750
“We want to make sure
that any individual that

34
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,940
participated in that is
held fully accountable.”

35
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,090
The Republican, Ron DeSantis: 
He made a name for himself

36
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,920
by appearing on Fox News —

37
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,520
a lot.

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,750
“Put up or shut up.”

39
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,570
DeSantis, a self-described
conservative warrior,

40
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,325
has impressed many
Republicans, including Trump.

41
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:30,199
“A tough, brilliant cookie.”

42
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:31,490
He’s got
Ivy League credentials

43
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,170
and served in the military.

44
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,122
“JAG officer.”

45
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:36,020
DeSantis went to
Congress in 2012,

46
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,030
but recently resigned so he
could focus on his campaign.

47
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,150
He’s also had some
stumbles, like when

48
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,150
he said this about Gillum the
morning after the primaries:

49
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,130
“You know he is an
articulate spokesman

50
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,510
for those far-left views.

51
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,990
The last thing we need to
do is to monkey this up.”

52
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,650
Yeah.

53
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,530
It drew accusations of
a racist dog whistle.

54
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,140
So, what about the issues?

55
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,820
DeSantis has endorsed
almost every Trump policy,

56
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,910
from repealing the
Affordable Care Act

57
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,070
to moving the U.S. Embassy
to Jerusalem.

58
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,060
He also hates tax increases
and so-called sanctuary cities.

59
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,660
Gillum:

60
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,785
He might be the most liberal
candidate for governor

61
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:11,720
in Florida’s history.

62
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,690
He wants to overhaul I.C.E.,
raise the minimum wage

63
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,950
and fight the N.R.A.

64
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,540
Polls show that
both messages are

65
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,430
getting pretty good
reception in Florida.

66
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,130
So yeah, of course, the
race is neck and neck.

67
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,540
“This is Florida.

68
00:02:23,540 --> 00:00:00,000
The rules are different here.”
