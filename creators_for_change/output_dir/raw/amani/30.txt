thing online about how the full moon

65

right now is called the pink moon and

66
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,109
how it's supposed to illuminate a lot of

67
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,310
relations and connections that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

68

those challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

71
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,390

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,269
time that I stopped myself from doing it

74
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,329
because I was so scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failing and</font>

75
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,930
of people thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I stopped or you</font>

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,130
valuable isn't worthwhile I started

78
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,880
thinking about if it should matter if

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,599
other people like it or not right does

80
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,030

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,440
story and everyone's voice everyone saw

83
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,970
everyone's personal narrative deserves

84
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,069
to be shared<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and I want</font>

cast all those fears away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappear</font>

88
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,480
