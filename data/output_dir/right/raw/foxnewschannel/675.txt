7
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:25,715
PROTESTERS BATTLED THE

8
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:26,716

20
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:58,314
BETWEEN 1968 AND TODAY.

21
00:00:58,315 --> 00:00:59,615

00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,785
AMERICANS ARE NOT IN TO

41
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:36,185
RADICALISM.

42
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,453
THEY DON'T LIKE RADICALS.

43
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:39,288
AND WHEN YOU TURN ON THE TV

44
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,958

DONALD TRUMP DOES.

53
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,976
I MAY NOT LOVE THE WAY HE

54
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:00,409
SAYS THINGS.

55
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,677

00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:13,522
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:15,191
HAVE A PERSON HERE WHO IS

65
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:16,492
TRYING TO SOLVE THE

66
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:17,827
SITUATION TO END THE PROBLEM

67
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:18,627

68
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:19,462

69
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:20,830

00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,105
AGO.

75
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:33,342
THE OCCUPY WALL STREET FIRST

76
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:34,810

77
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:35,144
COUNTRY.

00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:37,346
POLITICAL EXPERT.

80
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,715
IT DID SEEM TO MOTIVATE

81
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:45,888
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

82
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,857
>> WHAT WE SAW IN RESPONSE

83
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:50,459

86
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:57,900
AND ULTIMATELY THE WHITE

87
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,501
HOUSE.

88
00:02:58,502 --> 00:03:01,971
AFTER THOSE PROTESTS.

89
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,140
IT IS NOT VERY SMART

90
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:04,507
POLITICS.

91
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,742
AND ANOTHER -- INTERESTING

92
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,611
SIMILARITY WE FORGET ABOUT

00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,213
1968, RICHARD NIXON WON WITH

94
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,248
43.5% OF THE VOTE.

95
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:14,717
YET, HE WON IN A LANDSLIDE.

96
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:15,785
AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE SORT

97
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:16,952
OF THING WE ARE LOOKING AT

98
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:17,787
