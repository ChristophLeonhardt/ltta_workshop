>> Reporter:  YOU ARE A BIG
SPENDER.
>> Neil: $0.75.
BY THE WAY.
AND THESE ARE NOT PROTESTORS IN
IRAN YELLING DEATH TO AMERICA.
THESE ARE HOUSE LEADERS RANTING
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES BACKING
AWAY FROM THE DEAL:
AND AMBASSADOR, WHAT DID YOU
THINK THAT REACTION.
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY?
>> THE IRANIAN LEADERSHIP HAS
BEEN BURNING FLAGS FOR 38 YEARS.
AND THEY TOOK OVER THE EMBASSY
WHEN THAT REGIME CAME IN POWER
AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
BLOWING UP OF YOUR EMBASSIES AND
BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS THEY
HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE WHO
MURDERED HUNDREDS OF AMERICANS
AND SUPPORTED HESBOLLAH IN
BLOWING UP THE MARINE BARRACKS
AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSTANT
WAR AND THAT IS REALLY NOT NEWS
FOR ME.
THE BIG NEWS IS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP CHANGED THE WHOLE
CONJECTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST.
THIS DEAL, NEIL PUT US ON CRUISE
CONTROL AND IT DOESN'T BLOCK
IRAN'S PATH TO THE BOMB.
IT PAVES IT.
AND BY REMOVING THE SANCTIONS ON
THE IRANIAN REGIME BILLIONS WERE
POURING IN THE ISRAELI COFFERS.
AND THEY WERE FUELLING IT.
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE
PRESIDENT TO STAND UP AND MAKING
THE COURAGEOUS DECISION
YESTERDAY.
>> Neil: OTHER FIVE NATIONS
INCLUDING BRITAIN, GERMANY AND
FRANCE AND RUSSIA AND CHINA,
THEY ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THE
AGREEMENT AS IT STANDS.
THAT MAY BE POSTURING, BUT WHAT
DO YOU THINK, JUST THE UNITED
STATES THAT HAS TO ACT
UNLATERALLY.
>> I TAKE NOTE YOUR ALLIES AND A
ROB WORLD WERE OPPOSED AND WE
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S DECISION AND THAT SHOULD
COUNT FOR SOMETHING.
>> Neil: YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT
THAT.
NOT A SINGLE NATION IN THE
MIDDLE EAST SIGNED ON TO THIS.
NAND WE WERE THE GUINEA PIGS.
AND IMAGINE THE JAPANESE AND
SOUTH KOREANS WERE A POSED TO
THE DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA BUT
GERMANY AND OTHERS WERE HAPPY.
WE WERE TOLD THAT THE REGION
WOULD BE SAFER AND IT MADE THE
REGION MORE DANGEROUS.
IT HAS BROUGHT WAR TO OUR BORDER
AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE NEWS
AND THE ARAB PARTIES ARE
GRATEFUL TO THE NEWS.
AND THE U.S. ECONOMIC PRESSURES,
I DON'T THINK THE GERMAN BANKS
WILL CHOOSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH
IRAN OVER IT IS AMERICAN
COMPANIES AND FRENCH WILL NOT DO
BUSINESS WITH IRAN AND NOT
UNITED STATES.
AND MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO
GO THERE.
>> RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE
UNIVERSALLY AGAINST WHAT HE'S
DOING.
THAT COULD CHANGE TO YOUR POINT.
WHAT IS GOING ON.
OIL PRICES ARE ROCKETING ON THE
BELIEF THAT IT WILL TIGHTEN THE
SUPPLY.
AND THE IRAN OIL, TWO AND HALF
MILLION A DAY X. BEERM RANG ON
EVERYONE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> YOU KNOW, PRICES ARE RISING
50 PERCENT OVER THE LAST COUPLE
OF YEARS.
THEY HAVE BEEN LOW AND HIDDEN
THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS
DEAL.
AS OIL PRICES HAVE GONE UP.
AND IF THEY ARE WHERE THEY WERE
3 OR 4 YEARS AGO, MUCH MORE
MONEY WOULD DEPUTY IN THE
IRANIAN COFFERS.
UNDER THE DEAL IRAN COULD SELL
OIM.
WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS WERE IN
PLACE THEY WERE SELLING
A MILLION BARREL.
AND NOW THEY ARE SELLING 70
BUCKS A BARREL AND 3 MILLION
A MONTH.
AND I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU ALL
OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO FOR
THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD.
BUT INSTEAD IT IS FUELLING THE
WAR MACHINE.
AS THEY INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION,
THAT WILL BE DANGEROUS FOR THE
REGION.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR POINT
AND QUESTION, THE SAUDIS AND
OTHERS CAN INCREASE THEIR
CAPACITY AND ULTIMATELY SUPPLY
AND DEMAND.
YOU CAN CONSTRICT IRAN'S OIL
SALES.
AND THAT IS GOOD FOR THE REGION
