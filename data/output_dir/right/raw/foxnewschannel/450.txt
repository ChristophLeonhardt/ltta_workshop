1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:01,769
REPEAL.

2
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:02,069
DANA?

3
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:04,271
>> Dana: PETER, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,740
LITTLE MORE THAN A MONTH BEFORE

5
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,908
THE MIDTERMS, REPUBLICANS ARE

6
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,110
HIGHLIGHTING THEIR

7
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:09,577
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

8
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:10,311
PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING A NEW

9
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,979
TRADE DEAL WITH CANADA AND

10
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,681
MEXICO AS THE GOVERNMENT AVERTS

11
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,483
A SHUTDOWN AND THE ECONOMY KEEPS

12
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,951
GETTING HIGH MARKS.

13
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,285
REPUBLICANS STILL APPEAR POISED

14
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,121
TO LOSE THE HOUSE NEXT MONTH.

15
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:23,124
I'M JOINED BY STEVE SCALISE.

16
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,892
I KNOW ON ANY OF THESE

17
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,060
OCCASIONS, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

18
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,927
THE BRIGHT SIDE.

19
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,396
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A BRIGHT

20
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:28,696
SIDE.

21
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,697
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM.

22
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,400
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE

23
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,701
FULFILLED A LOT OF THEIR

24
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,668
CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

25
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,103
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GIVEN YOU

26
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,905
ALL THE LEEWAY TO DO WHAT YOU

27
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,807
FEEL NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THE

28
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:40,141
COUNTRY.

29
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,675
SOME THINGS GET CAUGHT UP IN THE

30
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:42,009
SENATE.

31
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,677
NOW YOU HAVE THIS CAVANAUGH

32
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:44,078
NOMINATION.

33
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,247
I WONDER IF YOU THINK THAT WILL

34
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,848
BE A GOOD THING AND A HELP TO

35
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,786
HOUSE REPUBLICANS OR FIT COULD

36
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,387
TURN ENTHAOU KWRAFTIC TURNOUT

37
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,956
FOR DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

38
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,925
>> WELSH DANA, I THINK THE MOST

39
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,760
IMPORTANT THING THAT WE CAN BE

40
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,862
DOING TO FIGHT TO KEEP THE

41
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,197
MAJORITY IS TO REMIND PEOPLE HOW

42
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:04,965
WELL THE ECONOMY IS DOING AND

43
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,433
WHY.

44
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,068
OBVIOUSLY, THE TAX CUTS HAVE

45
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,903
GOTTEN THE ECONOMY GOING, TO A

46
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,171
POINT WHERE WE'VE SEEN RECORD

47
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,006
GROWTH IN OUR JOBS.

48
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,974
YOU'RE SEEING LOW UNEMPLOYMENT

49
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,043
IN EVERY SPECTRUM, BY THE WAY.

50
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,745
IT'S LITERALLY EVERY SPECTRUM OF

51
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,480
OUR ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER.

52
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,182
>> Dana: OPTIMISM BEING WAY UP

53
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:21,482
THERE.

54
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,284
YET THERE STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE

55
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,820
IS THE NRCC PULLING BACK SOME

56
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,587
MONEY.

57
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,655
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NORMAL.

58
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,123
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RACES.

59
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:31,425
YOU DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED

60
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:31,792
RESOURCES.

61
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,027
LOOK AT THIS NUMBER FROM ACT

62
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,962
BLUE TWEETING SUNDAY, THIS IS

63
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,697
THE FUND-RAISER FOR DEMOCRATS.

64
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,332
BY YESTERDAY'S MIDNIGHT DEADLINE

65
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,668
SMALL DOLLAR DONORS HAD MADE

66
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,303
300,000 INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS

67
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:44,372
ADDING UP TO OVER $16.8 MILLION

68
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,607
FOR CAMPAIGNS AND ORGANIZATIONS

69
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,276
USING ACT BLUE, MAKING IT THE

70
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,078
BIGGEST DAY EVER ON OUR

71
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:50,445
PLATFORM.

72
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:52,113
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO HAVE A

73
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,048
LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO THIS

74
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:55,516
LAST MONTH SO THAT YOU CAN SPEND

75
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,952
IT WHERE YOU NEED TO?

76
00:01:57,952 --> 00:01:59,420
>> MONEY MATTERS A LOT.

77
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,255
YOU CAN SEE THE LEFT IS

78
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,224
INCREDIBLY ENERGIZED IN RAISING

79
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,959
RECORD AMOUNTS OF MONEY.

80
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,727
THEY GOT PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL

81
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,196
BLOOMBERG PUTTING INDIVIDUALLY

82
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,264
$80 MILLION OF HIS MONEY TO FLIP

83
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,666
THE HOUSE FROM REPUBLICAN TO

84
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,033
DEMOCRAT.

85
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,368
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE

86
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:14,969
JUST WHAT THE LEFT IS DOING.

87
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,705
THEY WANT TO REVERSE THE TAX

88
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:17,005
CUTS.

89
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,707
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH ICE.

90
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:20,442
YOU'RE SEEING LITERALLY IN THESE

91
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:22,377
DEMOCRATS PRIMARIES LIBERALS

92
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,379
BEING BEATEN BY SOCIALISTS.

93
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,348
THEIR PARTY MOVEMENT SO FAR TO

94
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:27,983
THE LEFT WAY OUT OF TOUCH WITH

95
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:28,750
THE COUNTRY.

96
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,252
WE HAVE TO GROW AN ECONOMY.

97
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,020
WE NEED TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT

98
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,387
THAT.

99
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:33,889
WE DON'T NEED TO SPEND DOLLAR

100
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,390
FOR DOLLAR WITH THEM.

101
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,925
WE'VE SEEN THAT IN OTHER RACES

102
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,394
LIKE KAREN HANDLE'S RACE LAST

103
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:39,694
YEAR.

104
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:40,929
MOST EXPENSIVE RACE IN THE

105
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,063
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.

106
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,899
WE WERE HEAVILY OUTSPENT YET

107
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,100
STILL WON BECAUSE WE GOT A

108
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,834
BETTER MESSAGE.

109
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,903
THEY REALLY HAVE NO AGENDA

110
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,804
EXCEPT TO RESIST TRUMP, RESIST

111
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,573
ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT ARE

112
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:51,940
HAPPENING.

113
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,074
THEY ARE AGAINST THE TAX CUTS

114
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,709
THAT ARE GROWING OUR ECONOMY AND

115
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,547
REBILLING OUR MIDDLE CLASS.

116
00:02:58,547 --> 00:02:59,981
>> Dana: PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS

117
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,917
MORNING AT THE ROSE GARDEN

118
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:03,819
ACTUALLY EVEN WENT INTO THE

119
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,287
AFTERNOON GIVING A STATEMENT

120
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,189
ABOUT THE NEW TRADE DEAL THAT HE

121
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,824
WAS ABLE TO GET SIGNED WITH

122
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:09,658
MEXICO AND CANADA.

123
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:13,128
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID.

124
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,163
>> WE HAVE NEGOTIATED THIS NEW

125
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,332
AGREEMENT BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE

126
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,101
OF FAIRNESS AND RECIPROCITY.

127
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,368
WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WE ARE

128
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:22,804
CLOSING ALL OF THESE TERRIBLE

129
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:23,171
LOOPHOLES.

130
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,706
I DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR

131
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,441
COMPANIES LEAVE AND FIRE OUR

132
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:26,775
WORKERS.

133
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:29,244
OUR WORKERS NEVER GET JOBS TO

134
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:29,978
REPLACE THOSE JOBS.

135
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,847
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

136
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:34,850
>> Dana: CONGRESSMAN SCALISE, IF

137
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,084
REPUBLICANS DON'T KEEP THE

138
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,853
HOUSE, HOW DIFFICULT MIGHT IT BE

139
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,189
TO GET THE NEW TRADE DEAL PASSED

140
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:41,790
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP?

141
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,359
>> I DON'T THINK NANCY PELOSI

142
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,227
WANTS TO SEE THIS ECONOMY

143
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:46,428
GROWING LIKE IT IS.

144
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:47,696
SHE'S AGAINST THE TAX CUTS THAT

145
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:48,930
ARE MAKING IT GROW.

146
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,266
BUT IF YOU LOOK, THIS IS A GREAT

147
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,801
DEAL THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

148
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:53,602
NEGOTIATED.

149
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:56,104
IT'S THE FIRST TO RENEGOTIATE

150
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:56,772
WITH MEXICO.

151
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:57,673
THEN CANADA.

152
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:58,707
HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD YOU HAVE

153
00:03:58,707 --> 00:03:59,808
THOUGHT IF YOU HEARD THE

154
00:03:59,808 --> 00:04:00,909
RHETORIC OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT

155
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,311
THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO BE

156
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,845
ABLE TO GET A BETTER DEAL WITH

157
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:04,880
CANADA AND MEXICO?

158
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,248
THIS IS GOOD FOR AMERICAN

159
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:06,582
WORKERS.

160
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:08,584
YOU KNOW IN WISCONSIN, THE DAIRY

161
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:09,751
PROBLEMS THEY WERE HAVING.

162
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:12,454
THIS OPENS UP A LOT OF MARKETS.

163
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:13,789
SO I APPLAUD PRESIDENT TRUMP ON

164
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:17,392
DOING THE THINGS HE PROMISED.

165
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,994
WE'RE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY,

166
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,295
TOO, BY THE WAY.

167
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,497
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY

168
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,899
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF US KEEPING

169
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:24,533
THE HOUSE.

170
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,501
>> Dana: DO YOU THINK IT'S

171
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,869
POSSIBLE TO RUN ON THOSE

172
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,669
POSITIVE THINGS OR DO YOU HAVE

173
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,204
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SCARE

174
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,739
YOUR BASE AND SAY, IF YOU DON'T

175
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,408
TURN OUT, ALL OF THESE THINGS

176
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:35,611
COULD GO AWAY?

177
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,447
>> WELL, CLEARLY, YOU'VE GOT TO

178
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:41,083
SHOW THE CONTRAST.

179
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,184
PEOPLE SEE THAT.

180
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:43,585
THEY'RE SEEING MORE MONEY IN

181
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,853
THEIR PAY CHECKS.

182
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:49,291
NOW THEY KNOW WHY.

183
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,059
ANYWA

184
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,427
THEY KNOW NANCY PELOSI THOUGHT

185
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:52,995
IT WAS CRUMBS.

186
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:54,930
THEY'RE ENJOYING THE BONUSES

187
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,964
THEY HAVE GOTTEN.

188
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,566
THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO TALK

189
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:58,333
ABOUT HEALTH CARE.

190
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,169
THEY'RE FOR SINGLE PAYOR HEALTH

191
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:01,904
