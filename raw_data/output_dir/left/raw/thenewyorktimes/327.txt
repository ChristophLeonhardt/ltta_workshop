1
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:06,770
As soon as they laid her on
my chest, I felt the weight.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,855
From the first time I saw her,
I wanted her to have everything.

3
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:16,570
But subconsciously, I knew
I didn’t have it in me.

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,740
I peed on a stick alone
in a stall at McDonald’s.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,390
And I watched the
line turn pink.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:34,700
I loved being young and feeling
like anything was possible.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,389
And I knew in that
instant, that I was never

8
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,250
going to feel that again.

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,790
Having an abortion
was never an option.

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,870
I was 17, a minor.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,350
The laws in Ohio
made it so I had

12
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,490
to have my parents’ consent.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,660
And asking them felt a lot
harder than telling them I

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,109
was pregnant.

15
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,990
I just always did what I
felt I was supposed to do —

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,450
had the baby, took care
of her, went to college.

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,880
But inside, I didn’t feel
connected to motherhood at all.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,530
I just felt lost, and then
guilty for feeling lost.

19
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,660
I felt like I was
failing, but then,

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,330
wanted to blame it
on somebody else.

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,170
It took me a long time
to admit that I actually

22
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,635
resented Maya for existing,
because that felt so wrong.

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,300
Years from now, she could
easily tell her therapist,

24
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,310
“My mom made it clear
that I was a mistake.

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,910
My mom made it clear
that I ruined her life.”

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,598
And I couldn’t really
argue with that.

27
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,630
I always have these
three words in my head, like,

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,710
strong, and
independent, and woman.

29
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,220
I wanted those words
to be attached to her.

30
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,892
When I was pregnant, I
had found a book of poems

31
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:17,436
by Maya Angelou.

32
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:21,190
In that collection was her
poem “Phenomenal Woman."

33
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,946
That’s when I confirmed that
I would name Maya, Maya.

34
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:32,187
And I like to think
she’s phenomenal.

35
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:39,145
I look at her and, I feel like
there is some sort of balance

36
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:42,565
or fairness in the universe.

37
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:46,617
I believe again in something.

38
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:50,972
She’s everything I wasn’t —

39
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,782
the possibilities, and hopes,

40
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:57,816
and dreams that I
used to be full of.

41
00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:00,488
But I regret that I
was never the mother

42
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:04,026
my daughter deserved.

43
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:08,094
I regret that, even
though I made my peace

44
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:13,076
and can be much more present
now, that it took this long

45
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:19,498
and that so much damage
was done in the meantime.

46
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:24,869
I regret that the line between
wanting everything for her

47
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:29,893
and speaking of my life with
such resentment is a fine one.

48
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:35,527
I sometimes dream
I’m childless and free

49
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:41,954
and I regret having the dream
and loving the dream equally.

50
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:55,967
When I looked at my mother,
my grandmother,

51
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,757
and my great-grandmother,

52
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:00,937
I just saw women who 
were burdened,

53
00:04:00,937 --> 00:04:04,074
women who weren't free.

54
00:04:04,074 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just intent on having
another kind of life.
