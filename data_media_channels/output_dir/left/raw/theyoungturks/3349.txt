1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,879
>>STEPHEN WILLIFORD IS THE
GUY THAT HEARD ABOUT THE

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,750
SHOOTING AND WENT TO SHOOT HIM.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,870
REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER ACTUALLY
HAPPENED THERE, THAT MAN IS

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,690
A HERO.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,330
MAYBE THE GUY WAS GETTING IN HIS
CAR TO GO SHOOT SOMEWHERE

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,330
ELSE, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,651
REGARDLESS THIS GUY KNEW HE WAS
GOING TO A PLACE WHERE A

8
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,780
GUY WAS KILLING PEOPLE.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,039
BUT WHAT THIS EVENT DOES NOT
PROVE IS THAT ALL YOU NEED

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:31,850
IS MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE
GUNS.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:39,329
FIRST OF ALL HE DIDN'T HAVE AN
ASSAULT RIFLE.

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:41,329
MOTHER JONES CONDUCTED AN
ANALYSIS OF 62

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:51,319
MASS SHOOTINGS, AND CIVILIANS
WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP IT.

14
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:56,730
WE BROKE DOWN THE VIDEO OF A GUY
THAT CAME UPON A CAR HIJACKING.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,760
HE PULLED OUT HIS GUN, AND SHOT
THE VICTIM IN THE HEAD.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,879
THAT IS THE SORT OF SHIT THAT
HAPPENS.

17
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:09,990
IT HAS PENETRATED 
THE SCHOOL BUT

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,200
THEY JUST WILL NOT ACT ON IT.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,259
THEY ARE WELL AWARE THAT IF THEY
HAD A GUN THEY WOULD HAVE A

20
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:16,090
LOT MORE DEAD PEOPLE.

21
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:25,610
>> WHAT WOULD 
THE COPS HAVE

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,610
DONE?

23
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,610
>>EXACTLY.

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,610
COPS DON'T KNOW WHO IS DOING THE
SHOOTING.

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,060
THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT IF ONLY THE
GOOD GUYS WOULD HAVE THE

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,869
GUNS THEY CAN THEN THEY CAN TAKE
OUT THE BAD GUYS, THAT IS

27
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,590
NEVER CUT FOR ME.

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,740
IF YOU JUST THINK IT OUT
LOGICALLY IT MAKES NO SENSE.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,899
>>EVEN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,
LET'S SAY HE STOPPED MORE

30
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:47,659
VIOLENCE FROM HAPPENING?

31
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,570
AND
AGAIN REGARDLESS THE DUDE IS A

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,890
HERO BECAUSE HE WENT IN KNOWING
HE COULD DIE.

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,539
BUT LET'S GIVE YOU THAT.

34
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,420
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT THIS
GUY HAD SHOT HIM A LOT OF

35
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,939
RIGHT-WINGERS WERE TRIUMPHANT.

36
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,450
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY CARE IF MANY
PEOPLE END UP DYING.

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:17,690
THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF THEY
ARE OFF THE HOOK.

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:31,020
THERE BEST CASE SCENARIO LEAVES
26 PEOPLE MURDERED IN A CHURCH.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,600
THAT IS THE BEST WE CAN DO?

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,200
IS
THAT MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN?

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:45,560
THIS 
IS PROOF THAT THEIR

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,110
STRATEGY WORKS.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,630
>> AND YET WHEN THEIR PEOPLE
KILLED AND ISLAM IS

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,400
INVOLVED WE RUN TO SAFEGUARDS.

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,250
WHAT CAN WE DO?

46
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,590
THE TERRORIST
THREAT.

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,510
THAT IS THE FEAR WE ARE MOST
COMFORTABLE WITH.

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,250
WHEN CLEARLY DOMESTIC TERRORISM
OF THE SORT, CRAZY

49
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,330
TERRORISM IS A FAR GREATER
THREAT.

50
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,810
AND YET THERE IS NO EFFORT TO
MAKE CHANGES.

51
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,550
AS JOHN SAYS WE TALK ABOUT IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE

52
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,410
ARE AT A LOSS FOR A NEW ANGLE.

53
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,670
THE TRUTH IS IT IS OBSCENE WHAT
IS HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY.

54
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,370
I JUST CAME BACK FROM EUROPE.

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,670
IN EUROPE THE GUY WAS
SAYING GO DOWN HERE –

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,170
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A
RESTAURANT OR SOMETHING.

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,400
HE SAID IT IS KIND OF A REALLY
DARK AREA.

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,730
I SAID ISN'T IT SCARY?

59
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,390
AND HE SAID NO, WE DON'T HAVE
GUNS HERE LIKE YOU GUYS DO.

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,630
THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS, AMERICA
IS GUN LAND.

61
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,940
WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF
GUNS.

62
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,280
>> AGAIN WITH THE GUN FREE ZONE
THING.

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:03,940
THE UK IS ALMOST ENTIRELY A GUN
FREE ZONE.

64
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,670
WHY DOESN'T EVERY CRIMINAL GET
THEMSELVES A PISTOL, THEY KNOW

65
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,720
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO OUT FIRE
THE POLICE AND JUST GO TO THE UK

66
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,310
AND RUN AMOK.

67
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,690
WHY DON'T WE LEARN NOTHING FROM
THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE OTHER

68
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,130
PLACES?

69
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:26,380
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE
IS 

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,750
THE OTHER WAY.

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,680
BUT IF INSTEAD THEY JUST GOT IT
ILLEGALLY, THEN GUN CONTROL

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
WOULD NOT HAVE MATTERED ANYWAY
BECAUSE THEY BROKE THE LAW.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,910
WE SAW THAT THIS GUY WAS
ACTUALLY BANNED FROM

74
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,780
GETTING A GUN.

75
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,190
SO GUN-CONTROL ARGUMENTS DON'T
ACTUALLY APPLIED.

76
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,720
HE APPLIED TO CONCEALED CARRY
AND HAD BEEN REJECTED.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,240
APPARENTLY THE NEWEST
INFORMATION IS THAT THE AIR

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,340
FORCE DIDN'T UPDATE THE FEDERAL
DATABASE WITH HIS DOMESTIC

79
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,760
VIOLENCE CONVICTION.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,380
IN THIS ARTICLE IT THEORETICALLY
WOULD'VE STOPPED HIM FROM

81
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,230
BUYING A GUN BUT THIS PARTICULAR
CLASSIFICATION OF A

82
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,010
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THING WOULD'VE
STILL ALLOWED THEM TO BUY

83
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,630
THE GUN ANYWAY.

84
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,400
PERHAPS THIS IS JUST A FUCKING
DISTRACTION.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,160
MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU
DIDN'T GET DENIED A PERMIT AND

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,240
THEN YOU GO OUT AND BUY – LET'S
HAVE FEWER GUNS OVERALL

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:31,610
>> DISCUSSES EVERY PROFILE OF
SOMEONE WHO SHOULD NOT BE

88
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,770
ALLOWED TO BUY THESE WEAPONS.

89
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,340
HE HAS A HISTORY OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE, AND OF HIS WIFE

90
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,050
AND CHILD AND ANIMALS.

91
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,620
HE GOT A DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE.

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,460
IF EVER THERE WAS A PROFILE OF
SOMEONE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE

93
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,010
AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON – BY THE WAY
HE HAS MILITARY TRAINING AS

94
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,420
WELL SO HE KNOWS HOW TO MAXIMIZE
CASUALTIES.

95
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:59,180
THE FACT THAT HE HAD ALL THESE
GUNS AND WAS ABLE TO DO ALL

96
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,520
THIS DESTRUCTION AGAIN I THINK
IS AN OBSCENITY.

97
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,050
>>I KNOW PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE
HAS GONE THROUGH THIS A LOT

98
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,400
AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE PRETTY
STRONG FEELINGS.

99
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,440
AS A PERSON, DOESN'T IT BOTHER
YOU THAT THE OTHER SIDE,

100
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,950
WHENEVER AN EVENT HAPPENS LIKE
THIS THEY ARE JUST LOOKING TO

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,460
MINIMIZE ANY POTENTIAL ACTION
THAT THEY ARE RELIEVED THAT THEY

102
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,490
CAN SOMEHOW DISTRACT YOU TO SOME
OTHER TOPIC.

103
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,980
DOES NOT BOTHER YOU AS A HUMAN.

104
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,870
IT TAKES A PROGRESSIVE ATHEIST
TO TRY TO PROTECT SOMEONE IN A

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,620
CHURCH THESE DAYS BECAUSE THE
ACTUAL CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN SO

106
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,560
CO-OPTED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
THAT THEY THINK JESUS WOULD OF

107
00:06:43,560 --> 00:00:00,000
CARRIED AN RPG AT THE TIME.
