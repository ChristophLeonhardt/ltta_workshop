Hillary Clinton has announced she's ready to come out of the woods mrs. Clinton's remarks at a recent st. Patrick's Day rally referred to the fact that she has spent a good deal of time walking in the forests near her exurban home in Chappaqua New York ever since her surprising and humiliating and crushing and well deserved and humiliating and sort of hilarious and totally humiliating defeat by Donald Trump in her bid to become the first utterly corrupt female president of the United States in the wake of that election disappointed Democrats have reportedly been taking pilgrimages to Chappaqua in hopes of catching sight of the reclusive mrs. Clinton in the woods the Democrats who had been absolutely certain mrs. Clinton was going to win the election hiked into the forests where they were absolutely certain they would see elves fairies and unicorns as well as a socialist system that works those who have seen mrs. Clinton in the woods report that the defeated humiliated disgraced and humiliated former candidate for dishonest president spent her time in the forests pulling thorns from the hooves of wounded dear learning the art of song from the twittering Birds and teaching Hawks how to make that loud piercing screeching noise when they descend from on high to shred and devour their prey the woodland Democrats say they have returned from their Clinton pilgrimage inspired to build a wall around the forest to protect mrs. Clinton's natural habitat and ensure she can escape to re-enter politics but mrs. Clinton says she is now healed the emotional wounds he suffered during her humiliating and crushing and humiliating humiliation and also defeat which was very humiliating mrs. Clinton says she now wants to return to a life of service to the country though she's not yet certain whose life that will be and how she can get hold of it but mrs. Clinton's wounds from her unprecedented and humiliating defeat have not just been emotional and humiliating they've also been financial not to mention humiliating shortly after mrs. Clinton lost her bid to become the first soulless female communist president donations to the Clinton Foundation reportedly dried up as donors realized the early we're a longer be able to sell her political influence for cash since she had no political influence after her humiliating defeat however word that mrs. Clinton would be returning word that mrs. Clinton would be returning to public life could change all that as Democrats can be expected to rally around her calling for her to once more enter the political fray and lead them to disaster that should fill the gap until their daughter Chelsea is ready to enter political life and lead Democrats to a whole new generation of humiliation and defeat meanwhile back in the woods visitors have reported seeing squirrels deer and raccoons gathered in forest groves to drink champagne and smoke celebratory cigars as one chipmunks oath reporters quote we thought she'd never leave that screeching Hawk noise she made was absolutely hellish unquote Democrats have formed a committee to see if the chipmunk should run for president trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show so we need also sing well that was totally Cynthia's fault as Cynthia Angulo who does the illustrations to hope it's the third time that Hillary Clinton came up I just couldn't get through it ah but but believe me it would have been really funny if I all right it's mailbag day all right all your problems will be solved and your life changed possibly for the better but first we have our wonderful sponsor one of my favorites blue apron and here is cartoon Clavin to tell you all about it basically what this is it's like having a restaurant in your home not the kind of restaurants my listeners go to you know whether the food is inedible but the waitresses aren't wearing any clothes these are places like nice people go to where the food is really good what they do is they send you like it's about ten bucks a meal and they send you all the ingredients you need in exactly the right proportions and it's easy after that you just sit back and watch your wife make but every every now and again you have to get up and chase her around the room maybe that's just in my house I'm not sure you just go on blue apron dot-com slash Andrew and they will give you the first meals for free no delivery charge nothing so you can taste him yourself really was terrific I mean I'm not not choking up his great great food blue apron calm slash Andrew it's a better way to cook good stuff I like that cartoon Clavin you should do the whole show so you may have noticed the stock market kind of plummeted yesterday and I think the reason that it kind of plummeted is because our president is having a little bit of trouble and what they're afraid of I think is that conservatives are going to tank Trump care they're going to attack a tank the Ryan fix to Obama care and that means that all the other stuff the tax reform and the you know relief from certain kinds of regulations and some that all that stuff's going to get backed up and it's not all gonna come together that's why the stock market has been climbing because of all the optimism so Trump Trump has put his credibility on the line he with conservatives who are not happy with this health care bill he apparently joked with some of them that he was going to crush them crush them in primaries but he basically told the people he had that rally in Kentucky a few a few days ago and he told the people that this is gonna happen here's here's that cut Thursday is our chance to end Obamacare and the Obamacare catastrophe and begin delivering the reforms our people deserve big thing that we get to tax cuts big thing and remember we're going to negotiate and it's going to go to the Senate and back and forth the end result is going to be wonderful and it's going to work great and it's going up its supposed to go up for a vote Thursday Ryan Paul Ryan can always pull it but right now the conservatives in the house are saying they have the votes to block this and they will and my concern about this is not I don't think this is a great bill I think it's a mess you know you I think my personal opinion is they package they should pass it you know make some changes pass it then the Senate will pass their version which will be totally different they'll sit down though we're on it out they'll have a chance to build something that might be close to to decent you know I think that that's important I think it's important because of trumps credibility you know here's let's just take a look here's Joe Scarborough and Jim Jordan and Scarborough is saying oh well they always threaten you that you'll lose your majority if you don't do what we say and Jordan refer uh responding to that the trick they always tried on us was if you don't pass this bill that leadership crafted in the dead of night and jammed all of these things into and if you don't pass it tomorrow the Republican majority is at risk do you want it that argument never worked then and I find it hard to believe that it's going to work now is it no it's not gonna work now because they roll this bill out three weeks ago they didn't allow any witnesses to testify in the hearings no amendments were allowed to be offered except the managers amendment which is a leadership amendment and makes technical changes and they said it's a binary choice which is not how the legislative process is supposed to work so you're exactly right our job is to do just what Mark Meadows said to do what we told the American people we were going to do when they gave us the privilege to serve and this bill doesn't do that this bill does not repeal Obamacare and that fundamentally is why we're opposed to it and unless it changes I do not see the votes there to pass this legislation and just to be fair to Paul Ryan he said that when he said it was a binary choice he meant when it came up for a vote if you turn it down then you're stuck with Obamacare which is just pure that's just the facts now Ryan can pull the bill he can pull it back you know and maybe maybe avoid disgrace come back you know relatively quickly with another replacement I think it is unwise and here's here's the thing Trump is under fire he is under unprecedented fire I've never seen a president denied any kind of honeymoon before at all and part of it is his own fault he's got a big mouth this stuff you know you know when he said that Obama wiretapped him I think that's closer to the truth and people are granting their obviously Comey says he's been under investigation their campaign has been under investigation since July so clearly there's been surveillance from the New York Times reports in the Washington Post reports it all mentioned that stuff and it seems obvious to me well it's a fact that someone unmasked unmasked Michael Flynn's name you know illegally that's a that's a felony from surveillance on the Russian ambassador when Flynn was caught up in that surveillance you're not supposed to reveal any American caught up in surveillance clearly Obama misused this information the Obama administration abused the information so it's more to the there's more to what Trump says then people will grant him doesn't matter it doesn't matter guys the president United States when you accuse the last president of wiretapping you you've got to be exact you got to be right he has hurt himself The Wall Street Journal has a devastating attack on him in there and they've been fairly supportive on their editorial page they said if President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within a hundred miles of Hawaii would most Americans believe him with the rest of the world we're not sure which speaks to the damage that mr. Trump is doing to his presidency with his seeming endless stream of exaggerations evidence-free accusations implausible denials and other falsehoods the latest example is mr. Trump's refusal to back off his Saturday morning tweet of three weeks ago that he had found out that Obama had wiretap Trump Tower he has offered no evidence for his claim and the president clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle we rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims you know so so I understand I understand that Obamacare repeal is important but I just I just want to show you how damaged I think this president will be and this president look I've detailed my troubles with Trump endlessly but this president's agenda right now is a not just a conservative agenda it's almost a conservative dream agenda you know even even that you know the stuff about you know infrastructure may bother some people but some of this stuff about rolling back regulation obviously Neil Gorsuch the Supreme Court pick this is great stuff I just want to show you just for a few minutes how the press is working so hard to damage this guy and stop him dead and of course the press when I say the press I mean the Democrats because that's who the press is I want you to remember Cleveland's first rule of mainstream media coverage I've said this again and again but it's always worth repeating whenever the prejudices and illusions of left wingers are confirmed by an individual incident the incident is treated as representative when left-wing prejudices and allusions are contradicted the incident is considered an aberration and treating it as representative is deemed hateful and that brings us to this horrifying horrifying rape in a Rockville Maryland high school and I not gonna go into the details but a 14 year old girl was forced into the boys boys room by two illegals right two students who were here illegally they were 18 one of those 18 and one 17 and all of them the 14 year old girl the 18 year old and the 17 year old were all in the ninth grade because these illegals couldn't speak English so they couldn't move up they forced her into the boys room they raped her as brutally as you know you only have to use your imagination Sean Spicer well so this as far as I know I may not be exactly right about it but the networks have hardly touched this it just doesn't exist it doesn't exist because of the first rule of mainstream media coverage it can't be representative of the problem with letting people unvetted into the country because then you would have to stop letting people unvetted into the country and we're with the Democrats get their voters from you know so these kids got in one of them was busted by ice and released under Barack Obama's catch and release program right I mean and even people on Univision right the please allow all illegals in station even one of them said under Trump this would not under Trump's rules this would not have happened so there's basically an embargo on this news at a press conference we have to give props to w to the local Fox 5's ronica Cleary who gets the going off the reservation award because she actually asked Sean Spicer about this and here's Spicer's response this is a tragic event in its horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through I can't possibly imagine so first of all let's remember the human side of this that this is a tragic event that no child no person no parent should ever have to deal with school should be a place where a parent puts their child on a bus or drops them off or sees them off it knows that they're safe I think it is troubling and III think further to your question the president recognizes that education is a state run and a local run issue but I think it is it is pause for concern what happened there so I hear you about it being a state issue let's talk about something though that the president has implemented and introduced voice these voice victims of immigration crime enforcement is that enough not to support no no it's the one piece the president understands that victims need a voice which is why you brought it in there to help them when they're specifically targeted or victims of a crime by people here illegally but I think part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crack down such a big deal is because of tragedies like that so again ronica clear he gets the going off the reservation award but you know you say well why isn't the illegal dreamer who is an honor student why isn't he representative of all the legal dreamers all I'm saying is is just as fair it's just as fair to take one example as another example and the thing is how many little girls have to get raped before it's a problem because you guess what if it doesn't happen in a public school which is where it's gonna happen and it happens in a private school and it happens to somebody's daughter in power if somebody's daughter in the media if it's somebody's daughter in the media and it only takes one that's all it takes is one but because this person is not a famous person because she's not in government because she's not working for CBS or NBC or ABC they don't have to cover the story and this look it's on Obama this rape is on Obama I'm sorry but it is and it is representative of the problem that one of the problems the Trump is trying to fix and is being thwarted at every turn are they got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come on over to
