HOWIE: WE DON'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT OF PRAISE FOR FOX NEWS FROM THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA. THEY LOOK AT THE CARICATURE OF FOX. HERE IS A "WASHINGTON POST" STORY. ON FOX NEWS OF ALL PLACES TRUMP'S SPY CLAIM IS DEBUNKED BY TREY GOWDY AND JUDGE NAPOLITANO. HE CHALLENGED THE ALLEGATION THAT THE FBIED ON HIS CAMPAIGN. THE ALLEGATIONS BY MAYOR GIULIANI OVER THE WEEKEND WOULD LEAD GIULIANI OVER THE WEEKEND WOULD LEAD ONE. HOWIE: THAT'S THE JUDGE'S VIEW. SHEPARD SMITH SOMETIMES TRIES TO DEBUNK THE PRESIDENT'S CLAIMS. SHEP SMITH SUPERSTAR. LOVE HIM. PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCUSE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL AND HIS TEAM OF A WHOLE NEW SET OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES. UNFOUND NOT BASED ON FACT OR REASON WITH NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM. JUDGE NAP WHERE, FOX NEWS' NEWS GATHERING FORCE. AGAIN, SPECIFICALLY DOING WHAT REPUBLICANS ALWAYS DID, THAT IS STAND UP AND DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW. STAND UP AND DEFEND THE FBI. HOWIE: THERE IS NO SURPRISE THAT JOE AND MIKA WILL DEFEND THOSE WHO SUPPORT THEIR VIEWS. IT WAS COMEY LEAKS BECAUSE HE WANTED A SPECIAL COUNSEL BASED ON A PHONEY DOSSIER. THEN HE SPIES ON DEMOCRATS. MUELLER'S OUT OF CONTROL RUSSIA PROBE HAS LOST ANY LEGITIMACY.
