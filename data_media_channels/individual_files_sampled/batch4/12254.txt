is your four-year-old gender-fluid well now you can send him or her or Zim Orser to transgender summer camp for kids in where else the San Francisco Bay Area plus we'll have roaming millennial Amanda presto Giacomo and Jacob Airy during the panel of deplorable z to discuss speaking of the youths social media depression among kids president Trump's tough talk on North Korea and the urgent need for the government to regulate sex robots I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show later too because we're going to have a final thought that is identifying as stuff I like because today is book lovers day so I'll be giving out some book reviews as a best-selling non writing author I think it's my place to tell you all what you should be reading for the next over the rest of the summer rather so we have to talk about rainbow day camp it is a camp in the San Francisco Bay Area for transgender toddlers the ages of the people who go are four to twelve the parents of the people who go are obviously abusive and very confused so this camp is not new this game has been around for three years it just made big headlines recently because the enrollment has increased by three times just this year so obviously transgenderism is in the air we're talking about it all the time in the culture and apparently this has been good business for transgender youth camp one of the directors said it has been a sea change maybe we can even call it a tsunami in the number of little kids showing up with their families and so when their kids show up even when they're four years old they are asked when they register which pronoun they would prefer to be called by and it's either she or he or Z or whatever and for the record Marshall I would only like to be referred to with the pronouns sir sir or master in the accusative certainement well make a note and we'll talk about it later luckily we have obtained a letter from one of the attendees of this camp we have access to great stuff at this show we have obtained a letter can we play it not a holiday oh I hate Ramada don't leave me out in the forest where I might get eaten by a bear take me home I promise I will not make noise so trans camp is apparently like band camp you know it's just like any it's much more socially isolating obviously and confusing but it's just like any other camp you go to basketball camp you go to baseball camp whatever there it is a little interesting in that most summer camps that we think of our camps to do something so I had to go to basketball camp when I was a kid one time it turned out about as you would expect I think but this is a camp about who you are imagining yourself to be who you deeply think yourself to be and obviously adolescence is a very confusing time we take on a lot of different identities that we try out no joke when I was when I was four years old I did identify as Batman for about a month I had people call me Batman seriously and that's just a very imaginative time these parents are obviously taking it to be some deep profound immutable fact of their child's existence and sending this to their camp it can't possibly be good but you know even the founder of this camp sander Collins admits quote a decade ago the camp wouldn't have existed eventually I do believe it won't be so innovative she's probably right she said I didn't know you could be transgender at a very young age but my daughter knew for sure at - I don't know if that's exactly right what could go wrong with allowing your two-year-old to deny the facts of their biology into denial reality to their parents well there are a lot of scientific data on this that I think the mainstream media are ignoring and I'm sorry I know these scientific data are that that is called hate speech if you're at Google or we work for the mainstream journalists outlets but we know there are high rates of post-op regret people who transition from one gender to another they undergo surgery to look more like the the other sex and they regret it later some of these studies put the number at 20% so one in five people who undergo this process and the surge is according to some studies regret it ultimately go back or they are just upset that they made that decision most children who identify as transsexual or as the other sex the vast majority of those kids will change their mind by the time they become adults they go on to lead perfectly normal lives as a one study put the numbers high to eighty percent eighty percent of kids who identify they're a boy but they think they're a girl will change their mind by the time they pass through puberty and enter into adulthood now there was a review of more than 100 international medical studies so this is a meta-analysis of all these studies that found quote no robust scientific evidence the gender reassignment surgery is clinically effective and this is why Paul McHugh who was a pioneer of this surgery at Johns Hopkins he was chair of psychology at Johns Hopkins he stopped doing the surgery because quote there's little scientific evidence for the therapeutic value of interventions that delay puberty or modify the secondary sex characteristics of adolescents there is no evidence that all children who express gender atypical thoughts or behavior should be encouraged to become transgender and that's what you know trans is in the news all the time you can't escape it for some reason an issue that effects a vanishingly small percentage of the population is all anybody wants to talk about anymore especially on the left but what is really worth talking about here is that we're talking about kids so if you put a kid on this road you tell a four-year-old boy that he's really a girl that's going to lead to a lot of confusion but if you tell a prepubescent kid that that you indulge in these delusions and that the boy is really a girl and you suppress their puberty hormones you're mutilating them for life I mean that damage is not easily undone if it's possible to fix it at all and you know there are people who have gone through this when they were children who have come to regret it we have their testimonies they talk about it here is one example hi my name is Carrie and my 22 year old D transition woman I was a pediatric transition ER so I started medical transition when I was underage and I stopped transitioning nearly a year ago and for me he transition involved you know a lot of thought and a lot of unlearning of what I understood about myself when I was transitioning I felt a lot of intent the very intense body dysphoria that felt very innate and very integral at the time to to the way I perceived myself in the world and when I came to realize eventually was that this was not the case that there were all these factors that played into my dysphoria dissociation and feelings of inferiority for being female and depression and body dysmorphia you know all of these things contributing to this kind of general sense of alienation sense of otherness from-from the people around me and specifically from other women and there are there are these conditions that go along with gender dysphoria there is a 2 to 3 times increase in likelihood if you're if you have gender dysphoria that you'll suffer from some other mental affliction including anxiety or depression or so on and so forth obviously we know that the suicide rates according to most studies are identical pre and post-op and the left and people who support the transgender transgenderism movement would say well that's social stress the kids are bullied at school if we just stop bullying them those rates go away there's there's very little evidence of this there's that might be a factor but there's no reason to believe that that's the main factor or or the you know the sole factor when it comes to all of these other conditions that accompany gender dysphoria let's look like Cara keep going on so when I was transitioning every every step of transition really really felt like this huge hi of relief from this foria but sooner or later you know they would come back in another form so you know once I was on testosterone I I wanted to change my name and once they take my name I wanted a mastectomy once I had a mastectomy I wanted a hysterectomy a lot of surgeries so on and so forth this is a really common topic in trance circles you know shifting dysphoria and at some point I realized that that wasn't going to stop transition didn't really make my dysphoria better it just kind of kept moving the goalposts so moving the goalposts is exactly the point the issue here is that carry this girl was treating the symptoms of her psychological condition she wasn't treating the root cause of it if there is a even as a way to treat the root cause of it and so it just kept moving the more she transitioned the more she did the more she had to do the more she felt that she had to do and carry started transitioning going through this process at 17 she was underage it meant now you know how crazy 17 year olds are you not crazy you were at 17 have different you were at 17 in your as an adult oh my god exactly well this kid marshals exactly the same marshal hasn't matured physically or emotionally since he was seven but for most people they do change over time and imagine if she wasn't seventeen imagine she were seven imagine if she were four years old which is what's going on at this camp in San Francisco cannot be good there's another example of not just people who went through this as kids but also people who went through the transition and changed their their gender when they were adults regretting it not long after and here's an example he he's pretty prominent he's talked about this in written books about it Walt hire who went through the surgery and experienced regret years later do we have them here with us now by Skype is speaker and author of several books addressing sex change regret Walt hire Walt thanks for joining us today yeah thanks for having me on first of all not only have you done extensive research on sex change surgery you've been through the process yourself but you say it fix nothing what can you share with us about that yeah you know when people go through this gender change there's very high expectations that you know their life is just going to be wonderful and everything's going to be great now I can tell you the way it starts that was true for me but then there's a time what I call when you kind of begin to sober up and realize that gender reassignment surgery really doesn't make you a female it's much more to being a woman than just having some cosmetic surgery and hormones so it didn't fix the problem for Walt he and he lived for eight years as a woman appearing to be a woman and wearing women's clothing but it didn't it didn't fix the problem and this surgery that he's now reversed or tried to fix by other surgical means has really damaged his life he talks openly about that and he was encouraged by others to do it and that's what we're seeing a lot in the culture now Bruce Jenner was encouraged by a lot of people to transform into Caitlyn Jenner these kids are being encouraged by their parents at age four to indulge in this delusion and it is it pulls on the heartstrings a little bit because it's a real affliction and also because men and women don't look that different especially like someone like Marshall you know I mean if you put Noor Marshall next to a woman it would be very good well I'll use another example if I put on these glasses I am indistinguishable from Rachel Maddow but and so obviously men and women are the same species they share a lot of physical traits just just ask Google about that but the the psychological problems and and therefore the philosophical problems they come up with it are a little clear when you look at other forms of body dysmorphia and delusion here there is an extreme example a guy whose name is stalking cat Dennis Abner do we have it that is never considered self human in tennis his eyes his transformation is only a formality everything I see and do I relate to as a cat I'm told i purr in my sleep so but there's this guy a stalking cat he he is a man who I think was in the Navy and then he decided to get $200,000 worth of surgery to tattoo his face pull up his cheeks have whiskers sticking out cut off parts of his ears and all so that he could appear more like a cat because he was under the impression that he really deep down inside somewhere is a cat he has cat-like abilities and what-have-you and it is a funny story obviously it is out there it looks kind of ridiculous but it's really sad because this is a real human being and the we can see much more clearly what happens when we indulge delusion when it's not just a boy becoming like a girl when boys and girls can look like each other but when it's a boy trying to look like an animal or something to that effect that this is ultimately I think what brings up the central flaw in the left's embrace of transgenders in the central contradiction which is that the left on the one hand says men and women are exactly the same they're indiscernible that just talked to Google fired a guy for contradicting this yesterday men can do everything the women can do and vice versa there are no categorical differences on the other hand they're saying that the sexes are so totally different that if you feel that you are a certain way metaphysically or you really want to be a different way metaphysically you should undergo costly painful and extensive surgery just to have the cosmetic appearance of looking like that other six they've never been able to resolve this conflict and I think that's why I think it has shown one of the major paradoxes at the heart of leftist intersectional hierarchies but now that we've talked about the transgender camp now that we've talked about leftist hierarchies we have to get to the exciting part of the show our panel of deplorable z we have with us again roaming millennial you know her from all the youtubes The Daily wires favorite Amanda presto Giacomo and for some reason Jacob areas back roaming are we being unfair here these children can suffer intensely they get bullied why shouldn't we ship them off to transgender camp well I think you know to answer the first question that you posed at the beginning of the show is your child gender fluid regardless of how you feel about the transgender issue I think we could all agree that nobody is gender fluid look at all just not a real thing I always try not to talk about gender fluids I find it very impolite but I agree with you probably that's right and you know what I mentioned this the last time as all with you guys but when it comes to children I think trying to impose these sort of gender ideologies it is child abuse and you know a lot of people say no you know it's just thing we've always benched for the kids this isn't you know a sort of indoctrination they're actually they're one of documented instances any time you hear about these you know these transgendered child children activism eat or not you know what I mean a lot of them are added up selves trans or have been trans activists before there report and you got to think to yourself okay wait only a fraction of a percent of people in the general population is actually trans what is the likelihood of a trans person or someone who is already a trans activist then having a trans child is like no I think there's definitely a case where as a parent these people are inflicting their ideologies and their their views on gender on to their children and it's something that I think a lot of children are going to have issues dealing with as they curl up it has become very ideological I mean that is why yeah just as you said there are not a lot of these people in the world if there are a handful of these people around and yet it's all we hear about it's all we're talking about there TV shows about it it's always in the news but there doesn't appear to be a cure so Amanda if there isn't a cure for this at the moment if there's really doesn't seem to be an effective way to reduce suicide rates or depression surgically then why shouldn't we just tell these people to call themselves whatever name they want and pretend to be whatever sex they want yeah I mean it's particularly we shouldn't and it's because you know this is really tied to depression this is a psychological disorder so like mutilating your body I mean it's like getting a knee surgery when you puff out your shoulders not not addressing the issue at all we should not be encouraging this especially me particularly with children who as you said grow out of this confusion I mean we're just basically indoctrinating you know Tommy the two-year-old associated I know sore on Wednesday and then on Thursdays a girl yeah maybe carrying yourself right you'd actually parent your child and you know I think I mean 80% of these kids that's a left alone number grow out you know do studies grew out of this confusion we should not be pushing this on them I mean kids are being utilized there oughta victims of this it's it's really vile stuff and anyone who speaks out against it this is the worst part you're labeled as transphobic that you hate you know people suffer from this mental disorder no I mean there's actual real damage to this and this is a political movement you know they hate the nuclear family they hate you know they kind of are contradicting feminism because they want sameness but then all of a sudden you know men and women are so different you can transition it's just it's a hot mess and it's a really nasty political movement that is hurting people and creating on a victim's stunning bigotry from Amanda press to Giacomo but that is unreal you both bring up this interesting point which is that it's child abuse it looks like child abuse it is parents mutilating their children before now but not only before they can consent but before they go through puberty and they're making a decision that will impact the rest of their lives Jacob we conservatives are very skeptical of government interference should the government step in here should the government come in and stop parents from encouraging this in their children I think it depends on the situation and in some cases where the parent is just like oh you think you're a girl go along with it but maybe in the circumstances whereas Amanda points out that they're actually causing physical harm to their kids then then yes I think that is where the DAR means to step in is like hey is your child actually feeling this way or is this just a phase they're going through I had a friend who was a skater girl she she wore t-shirts and blue jeans and skateboard all the time but she was about as girly girl as you could get could you imagine if she had these trans activist parents like oh my gosh you must be a boy as you imagine what that would have done to her but it's instead they just let her go and she grew out of her skateboarding phase what I would literally like a boy growing up like my dad was a wrestling castleball so much like I went all the practices like if I wasn't being born like you know five years ago they would have told me I was a boy like it's I mean it one of the signs of a tomboy is that not allowed it's like gender stereotypes are amplified on the left people who condemn them it doesn't make any sense yeah it's mind-blowing that's true too like that one one point gender is nothing but also gender is everything like at one point gender is a social contract but it's also something biologically that we are and we can tell through our different brains like you have to pick one I mean you could go for either one but just be consistent that's right I also have a very hard time believing Amanda was ever a tomboy but I will take your word for it okay we need to move on now we need to get to the news which means that all of you dirty cheapskates who don't for the daily wire you don't get to hear the rest you don't get to see the panel you don't get to engage with us on the news unless you go to daily wire comm and pay $10 per month $100 a year and you will get also the leftist here's tumblr keeps your leftist tears hot or cold always salty and delicious not only do you get my show and the wonderful panel of deplorable but you get the Ben Shapiro show which is I think right now the number two highest ranked podcast in the country what number are we Michael I well we're a number ten news and politics I think 10 or 11 but Ben is one spot behind Oprah so you've got to go help and push him over and you get the Andrew Klavan show which is also ranked very high I think all three of the shows are ranked in the top 25 so it what a deal what at ten dollars a month unbelievable go to daily wire calm right now subscribe we'll be right back now we have important news to get to president Trump warned yesterday quote I love him so much he warned North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen this may be the greatest international threat since the Gipper I just want to pull this out this is my favorite one do we have it my fellow Americans I'm pretty to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever we've been bombing in five minutes almost as good as the Gipper himself he was kidding Ronald Reagan was or was he he did outlaw Russia forever roaming was Trump's threat reckless and rash or was it pitch perfect and very enjoyable well something that I I think it's great that you included was the fact that he prefaced that phrase with a you know if you if North Korea could use to make threats against the United States right because I feel like a lot of the reporting about this quote has a forgotten to mention that conveniently and sort of try to paint Trump as the aggressor in the situation and look I'm not sure I would ever use phrases like you know fire and power just from a I don't know hyperbolic this is real life not over the rings I'm approached I'm not convinced it is anymore but sure go ahead I think if there's ever a time to have a strong hand when it comes to international relations North Korea and the possibility of you know nuclear escalation is one of them and I think that people who are trying to paint this as a necessary instance of aggression from prompt they're they're like like I said not looking at the entire quote in context and they're also not realizing just how bad things have gotten over the past eight years and look you know regardless of how you think Trump is handling this at the moment you can't you definitely can't say that he is the one who created a situation right this this ongoing hostility between North Korea the United States is something that's been happening for a long time since Clinton absolutely yeah Bill Clinton ignored it George W Bush was otherwise occupied Barack Obama obviously did nothing about it I think Ben Rhodes was he tweeted at something the other day to the effect of you know this all started before us even though we had time to fix it because no one in the Abama administration can take responsibility for any single thing at all now Romo here over there in Asia and Amanda you are up in Canada New York safely ensconced in the woods but we are in LA thank you yeah what what is going to happen are we about to be incinerated what's the threat level from them actually shooting some missiles over um while I'm in New York so I can't ask you know but you're in you're in Canada New York you're up in like you know you're uh still oh okay I get it I get it elegant land they can't all be winners folks you know but um no I don't think I don't think we're any so couple things like I don't I don't think Trump's rhetoric or anything like that is put at that you know heightened danger or anything like that I think that Kim little Kim is is crazy yes but he's not stupid and he knows that he will be you know annihilate I think I think people who study this have the consensus that basically she just doesn't want regime change and he's flexing his muscle he knows that he will be annihilated if he does something I think that's kind of the consensus around us but at the same time we don't want him to keep making advances so we need to find a way to make this China's problem because you know they don't want refugees coming in there I mean they have they do some sake enough so I think Trump saying that he's going to continue work with China to you know kind of stop their funding and not let them keep advancing their you know their nuke and then you know we can we can just kind of handle that and fill them but I don't think the danger is heightened I think that I think they kind of know that there they will get annihilated by America and her allies I have to disagree with your analysis not in the take of the threat level but in your pronunciation of China it is a hardship China Jacob why hasn't Dennis Rodman straighten this out yet hmm well because he was an overrated basketball player and he's an overrated ambassador but in all seriousness I am on but in all seriousness I actually I actually think that President Trump was totally appropriate appropriate and fire and fury because not moments I think hours before even Kim Jong specifically said we're going to bomb I believe it was Guam so yes yeah of course I if I was president I would absolutely say hey we are going to meet this with fire fury in power and also you know what if President Obama or Hillary Clinton was still Hillary Clinton god forbid was president what would she say oh that naughty little Kim I mean you know what is she going to do she gonna you know I hear she's going to pursue a career in ministry obviously you know this is not foreign policy right yes I think those rhymes wawas after was after okay yeah okay baby there's like a lot flow story that said that they were like you know they had a warhead akka miniature warhead or whatever and then they were making stress could be sanctioned them and then Trump made those comments and then I said we were going to attack wow man I never they won't of course they won't because he's a coward I mean like it's just like that he's just going to flesh this know what you'll get annihilate it yeah absolutely my main takeaway from this whole discussion is the phrase a little Kim Roman boy well I just in any case it's not as if you know Kim German administration with a rational actor before this right I me they're actually in North Korean state-run propaganda pieces of I don't know if you guys have seen this but the piece where the little kid is dreaming of a news being sent over to the US right I mean this is one country that is obviously an aggressor absolutely well that makes me unhappy you know what else might be making people unhappy smartphones the Atlantic just ran a feature article titled have smartphones destroyed a generation quote more comfortable online than out partying post Millennials are safer physically than adolescents have ever been but they're on the brink of a mental health crisis they don't go out they don't go on dates they stay in the house my question why would a thirteen-year-old go on dates when he can interact with roaming millennial on YouTube from the comfort of his own smartphone is intro me is interacting behind a digital wall so different from interacting a person well you know this is something that I I feel complete to talking about because you know on the one hand I love ragging on Millennials as much as anyone right they're awful but on the other hand I'm also this massive introvert who loves the fact that you can kind of be interacted with people and be social online while at the same time you know being at home not wearing any pen it's an amazing mix we're roaming millennial now wearing any pain you heard it on the Michael show this is by the way I remember 10 all these kind of cheap tricks like that sorry to interrupt go ahead well that what my cameras always from like but you know I think I think it's the fact that you know not only are we seeing an increase in technological advances but we're also seeing sort of I feel a more hands-off approach to parenting that we haven't seen before so I wouldn't necessarily say that this is technology technology's fault I just think it's the fact that you know when I was younger I used to get kicked out of the house and get told to play outside I could have still been playing you know well at home on TV right I mean the fact that outside is still there I think is like being ignored by a lot of parents who are probably also on their own smartphones and a tronic device fair enough that's true there's a lot of candy crush to play jacob is it just promotionally old people who don't understand the youths or is there a real threat of social isolation here I think it's a mixture of both and we have to be very careful about how we categorize this because there are just truly introverted people who prefer interaction online and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but again we also need to monitor how that is done because we want I mean by we I mean whoever parents siblings guardians they need to be modern these kids like okay is this person really an introvert or are they getting are they getting trapped into this big web they only identify as an introvert yeah exactly because you know there are there are predators online who take advantage of some of these people who have social anxieties I want to know a lot about this Jacob well you know what can I say you know I read the I read the mainstream media this is what they're telling me but you know we do have to we do have to be careful that about this because there I believe that there's a game going around called the blue well challenge where they manipulate people with social anxiety who are online and then they ask them to commit suicide and it's a growing problem in Europe and it's even reached the United State so yes parents guardians should definitely be monitoring their kids online activity that the I'd read about that about these Russian girls who were killing themselves because of some lunatic that they just arrested that now that's not good Amanda should we be blaming the social media here is it the social media that causes the isolation or is that just an instrument like a telephone or you know a two cans and a string is it just a medium and an instrument or is it really the cause of the problem I mean I think with any technology you're going to have pros and cons and I mean it is a lot to do with parenting as roaming and and Jacob we're talking about I mean you've gotta let any social interaction basics interaction is valuable I mean we have a lot of kids don't have these skills just on that level and then also I mean if you looked at that Atlantic piece even just with Millennials in the generation you know right after us it's a huge discrepancy and inputs depression based on just the screen time I mean it does really affect these kids you know I get to break it in more screentime I have with Jacob Airy the more depressed I guess I should write a study about it sorry go ahead yes but I mean like even I mean even as a millennial like I'm really addicted to you know being on for my job of course but I'm always on social media and you can kind of get no suppressed you can get you know caught up in that and not interact with with people and that's that's not that's not helpful so we have to just learn how to use these things in moderation parents didn't really be aware of this sign your kids up for sports just dance whatever like they need to actually interact it's just it's not it's not healthy doesn't teach them any skills that are actually valuable for future employment and things like that so yeah sign them up for a sport or buy them a sex robot there is this prehistoric extra tree there is a professor at GW law who insists that the time has come for the government to regulate that gigantic problem sex robots now if you're unfamiliar I think a lot of people are probably unfamiliar with sex robots we have a clip from one of the factories you can't resist us mr. powers Oh contraire baby I think you can't resist me hi well maybe that should be regulated that's a pretty good case maybe should regulate them Amanda what are so dangerous about sex robots other than the guns that are shooting out of their bosom yeah I mean it's really sad that we're at this point like this going to be kind of ties into technology too and how we're so isolated that we're going to you know people are delaying Mayer marriage they're not getting married so we need sex robots now it's really sad but the whole regulation argument was really interesting to me so that we could you could possibly rape a robot and like yeah I'm right a lot of fun so it was a great hobby just because they're not winning no doesn't mean they're saying yet a robot consent like if that's the case like I'm not going to you know be profane here but isn't there a lot of rape going on insect toy industry like it's I don't understand here well you know a four-year-old kid can consent to radically changing his body forever but a doll can't consent to sex can't you just read a blog everyone so alemana yeah why professor was trying to give rights to a robot I'm like can we focus on maybe rights of the unborn first and then chapel rolled awful big as you are rubbing there is a legitimate question here I mean you could have I don't know if you can rape a robot but you could make a sex doll that looks like a little kid or we're like a rape victim or something is there is there any legitimate reason to regulate this industry similar to say child pornography or something like that or are we just talking about absolutely nothing well I think there like when you mentioned anything to do with children I think there definitely is a reason for this to be regulated I know I've heard the argument be made that like child dolls might be helpful as a way of sort of releasing any urges that actually bring a real challenge to it but I think you if you are someone who is suffering from that affliction therapy is what you need not in context also definitely yes yeah when it comes to I know which is more every day right that's IRAs or health and public office you regulate it good blah you know on a larger scale I think the whole idea of regulating sex robots it kind of begs the question like what exactly qualifies as a sex robot versus just you know our run-of-the-mill sex toy that has mechanical operations I can't believe I'm talking to you run-of-the-mill containers you know I mean yeah I mean room but with like some I don't know alluring eyes painted on right like where would they draw the line if you wanna be a Harley I'm not throw sex robot I'm just you know anti-government intervention at a half subside with that in this case fair enough Jacob the essential question here though is why would anyone want to have sex with a robot when there are people you can all you can also not just robot you can also have sex with people what what is what is the basis for the why are people trending toward this I think it's it's a way of just disconnecting from reality so everyone goes in because of left-wing propaganda you're told oh you can have this you can have that and there won't be any consequences and then they go out into the real world and say oh man there are real consequences so then they turn to robots which are complete frauds and so I think that's what it has to do with it it's just a way to escape from real-world consequences when you make a mistake or when you do or when you find out that life is tougher then you're then your lesbian dance therapy professor tells you it is that's interesting there's also no there's no social skills nobody has any social skills like I even go on a date they can't even hit on a girl like so in the sense that for about the next thing because you know this is this has to do with all the new technology - people are so isolated and secluded it's a good point and interesting how so many of these sex robot things are coming out of Japan culture that is well documented for the fact that there are people fewer and fewer people are getting married going on date I definitely think there's an element you know I mean know just be here but there is an element of people not being able to interact with each other like we used to be able and there was a study that came out of Japan a little while ago that a number of teenage boys would prefer to look at pornography than to have sex with a woman they actually preferred sitting in their rooms a lot crazy oh my gosh it does play into that this culture hack took what a great man said it does play into this culture of objectification though it does play into this materialist culture where believe it or not there are spiritual and emotional aspects to sex it's not just all playing with a doll or something but for a materialist culture the materialist generation maybe the physical is all that is being considered well into the ironing here is one of the biggest criticisms the homeschooling is the children don't get interaction right well in public schools they get plenty of interaction and they're buying sex robots so you know I don't think that's just kind of a ridiculous narrative yeah how about that all right on action and sex robots I have to say goodbye to you get out of here because we have a trans final thought that we need to talk about now do we have the do we have the trans final thought montage this is a final thought but it's because it's book lovers day is we're going to turn it into a sort of stuff I like I'll tell you about the books that I've been reading over the last couple years and I highly recommend them the first one is poetic diction by Owen Barfield he was an inkling friend of CS Lewis and all of those other guys he it's a great book it's a theory of knowledge and a theory of language this was recommended to me by Andrew Clavin who actually reads books I read like two books a decade and he's read all of the books so he's we've been evangelical about recommending this book to people it's really good I think especially conservatives and people who prefer traditional culture and have an interest in history and philosophy would really like it so run out there and get poetic diction the next book I have to recommend is of course speaking of Andrew Clavin the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ I read this book right when it came out I got an advance copy of it it's an amazing story of Andrew Klein conversion from a secular intellectual Jew in New York to a Christian and and talks about his politics as well and the literature that brought him along that journey it's really a profound book I myself am a revert to Christianity I it was very edifying to read that and then when you go to the beach this book we got to give a little love to ben shapiro you all know that ben can type about 120 words per minute he also as you know speaks about 190 words per minute and this book flies by it is such a page-turner true allegiance it is a fever dream of armageddon from the conservative standpoint it's really entertaining it's terrific so when you're going to the beach i recommend reading that i promise you you won't be able to read it as fast as been typed it and speaking of typing books really fast the final recommendation i have to make a little self-serving the reasons to vote for democrats the comprehensive guide the most exhaustive democratic party apologize out is really good i can even the president endorsed it he said it's a great book for your reading enjoyment even Ben Shapiro endorsed it II called it thorough I really think as you gear up for the school year as you gear up for the fall you want to edify yourself you want to learn more about our political systems and American history and American political philosophy go out there you also have to get reasons to vote for Democrats happy book lovers day I'm glad that we had this lovely trans final thought segment I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael no Leo come back tomorrow we'll do it again
