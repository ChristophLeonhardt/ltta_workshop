1
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:03,025
WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE OUT

2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:04,026
PROTESTING, THEY ARE GOING TO

3
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:06,862
PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION

4
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:08,664
WHERE THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO

5
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:08,964
FAIL.

6
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:11,400
THE ECONOMY IN IRAN IS WORSE

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,234
THAN VENEZUELA.

8
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:12,968
>> WOW!

9
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:15,771
>> WE KNOW IRAN IS IN A BAD

10
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:16,071
SPOT.

11
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,607
THE POLITICS HERE AT HOME, IT'S

12
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:20,509
INTERESTING TO WATCH CHUCK

13
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:22,144
SCHUMER CONDEMN THE PRESIDENT

14
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:24,746
WHEN HE WAS ONE OF FOUR

15
00:00:24,746 --> 00:00:26,348
DEMOCRATS AGAINST THE IRAN DEAL

16
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:28,083
FROM THE BEGINNING.

17
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,251
REPUBLICANS WERE AGAINST THE

18
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,252
IRAN DEAL.

19
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:32,587
THIS WAS VOTED ON NOT AS A

20
00:00:32,587 --> 00:00:33,755
TREATY, BUT THERE WAS A VOTE

21
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:36,792
ABOUT WHETHER TO APPROVE OR

22
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:37,826
DISPROVE OF THE DEAL.

23
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:39,928
AND MAJORITY CONGRESS VOTED

24
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:41,229
AGAINST IT.

25
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,964
SO THAT THIS IS ANY DIFFERENT

26
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:45,167
THAN WHAT CONGRESS ASKED FOR IS

27
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:45,500
ABSURD.

28
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,871
>> ALSO THE SAME THING WITH

29
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:51,873
MOVING THE EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM.

30
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:53,508
HOW MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR THAT

31
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,910
AND CAME OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT

32
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,746
TRUMP MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

33
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:00,415
>> ONE OTHER THING THAT IRAN HAS

34
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:02,150
BEEN DOING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON,

35
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,652
THEY ARE TAKING OVER PARTS OF

36
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:04,486
THE MIDDLE EAST.

37
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:07,355
THEY COMPLETED THROUGH

38
00:01:07,355 --> 00:00:00,000
HEZBOLLAH, THE TAKEOVER OF
