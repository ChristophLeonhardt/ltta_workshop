under Donald Trump our environment is screwed and the EPA is every day getting swampy ER and swampy ER in this video we're going to break down two recent hires that have to do with our environment that make clear who this administration is going to serve so first I want to talk about Patrick trailer apparently his actual name partner at Hogan levels was recently hired as the EPA's deputy assistant administrator in the office of enforcement and compliance assurance with both sounds like the most boring job in the world but also represents a very powerful position we're talking about one of the main investigative lawyers that's intended to protect the environment in the EPA so let's talk about who this person is and where his loyalties might lie back when he was working at Hogan Lovells his clients included all of these different corporations that you're going to see in this list you know debt Daimler AG Dominion energy Edison mission energy Flint Hills Resources Invista the Koch brothers NRG Energy which by the way is a terrible name for Energy Corporation is redundant Southern California Edison TransCanada by the way you've heard them in the news for their pipelines and venture Global LNG so I don't doubt that you need an experienced lawyer in this position but a guy who for literally decades has been defending the interests of some of the biggest polluters and environmental aggressors in our country is not the person who should be investing in them especially when you consider that the day he leaves that position at the EPA he's going to go back to an incredibly profitable position probably for one of those corporations you'd have to try and make it up and I hate to not hate the term but you know it's too harsh the murderous row murderers row of people you appoint to be parts of in the head already you know Scott Pruett already but then also people underneath just make sure that it's chocked full of people with the exact opposite interest in mind for what the department is supposed to do so instead of the proposed policies of getting rid of the Department of Education getting rid of the a abolishing IRS is Ted Cruz like to say um instead we'll just chalk it full of people that will virtually destroy it from the inside out anyway and say we're staffing it but actually just eating it a lot exactly to get your interest it's I don't know how we keep accepting it it's such this blatant is blatant is blatant and we've got another name for you perhaps even worse than a trailer let's talk about Jeffrey Bossert Clark nominated by President Donald Trump ah is in a graphic they got me to say it I feel dirty on Tuesday to serve as the Justice Department's top environmental lawyer so this isn't EPA but it still has to do with those who abuse the environment Clark previously represented BP after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture that killed 11 workers and was as you probably remember the largest offshore environmental disaster in US history he was there fighting for veep for BP at that point but it's not just a financial thing there's the financial component is also an ideological component to where his loyalties lie so use a partner in the Washington office of Kirkland and Ellis previously has represented the US Chamber of Commerce in lawsuits challenging the federal government's authority to regulate carbon emissions in court has repeatedly argued that is inappropriate to base government policymaking on the scientific consensus presented by the IPCC so there he's making money but he also had a blog by the way were for a long time he's talked about how we shouldn't be listening to scientists when it comes to the environment he said when did America risk coming to be ruled by foreign scientists and the apparatchiks at the United Nations and has made clear by the NRDC air clean air program director has a long history of opposing climate action for corporate and ideological clients because you know foreign scientists or all the ones that are saying there's something going on with our climate American scientists they're on board it's another like America Green forget the reality of science let's just go ahead and say that we're the best and we can do whatever you want not gonna hurt that bad yeah and look so they're staffing up the EPA this is the EPA it's also Department of Justice as well and all those people who are supposed to be watchdogs making sure that we don't sell off the environment or mineral rights and and and and all the public lands that we don't pollute that we don't ruin our streams that are our water our air or coastlines that we don't drill every drop of oil out of our land while we still can those people man they're all hacks for for industry now there are all people who seem like true believers that don't believe that climate changes is happening and they have been paid to hold that position in the past and then after they do and they say that it's for the benefit of America and the wealth of America let's refer back to a previous story we just did the wealth of America is not going back to the people who they need you to continue to vote for people are going to put you in place to be like look at the wealth of America that you don't get any part of exactly what's the benefit yeah I don't know maybe you get to drive through a nice neighborhood look at the fancy houses you can't afford I guess that's the silver lining you don't like hats well I hear your brother did you know that you can become a
