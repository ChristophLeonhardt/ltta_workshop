Gabe Sherman who's also an MSNBC contributor he joins me now as our network's foremost expert on all things bill shine mr. Sherman welcome back to the show sir thanks Chuck so let's start with why didn't bill Shine get a job after Fox and before the White House well you know he Sean Hannity has been lobbying the president to bring shine into the White House it has been something that Hannity has pushed for shine was reluctant according to my sources close to to shine his family was reluctant about him stepping into the public eye after so publicly leaving Fox News under a cloud of scandal but the president remained determined and courted him and ultimately of course was successful in bringing it in this week this is a relatively new relationship though the president's relationship was with Rupert and Roger how and how didn't I mean so this was a Sean Hannity sort of connection here yeah when did they connect when you get the sense that the president said yeah I did to borrow a pun took a shine to Bill Sean yeah well you know going back to the campaign of course Trump had a relationship with shine it wasn't close his primary relationship was with Roger Ailes but through the Fox orbit Donald Trump was aware of bill shine and then after the inauguration as Sean Hannity emerged as Trump's biggest booster and de facto spokesperson in the media that relationship developed Sean Hannity brought bill shine down to the White House they had a private dinner several months ago in that relationship developed I think what this is emblematic of though Chuck is something you touched on earlier in the last block Donald Trump is doubling down on his base he's making no effort to broaden the message sean hannity is speaking almost exclusively for the most die-hard of Trump supporters and bill shine who four years at fox with sean hannity's producer before ascending into the executive ranks really has an eighth understanding of that die-hard base and so by him becoming deputy chief of staff and communications director is a signal that Whitehouse is going to laser in on that base and try to bring them out in the midterms so this was what you're saying essentially an optics higher almost more than it is anything else so let me ask this then about Bill shine first of all what's he hireable outside of this White House I mean with all the how he was essentially escorted out of Jack's news you know he was he wasn't invited to leave I mean you could say he was truly forced out no one else was hiring him I assume he became unhireable in the corporate world of course I mean he was basically in retirement out on Long Island where he lives with his family and you know really my reporting indicates he did not have any career prospects and we should point out he's entirely new to politics I mean you could argue that Roger Ailes ran Fox as a communications shop but yeah this was really a case where Donald Trump was the lilypad for bill shine to land on all right so bill shine is rumored to potentially be the the next chief of staff although I by the theory that there will be no official yeah new chief that it will be just sort of the president is his own chief of staff was shine having an important place at the table yeah is he I take it he has a reputation that he got fired for this he arguably for being too much of an enabler yeah too much of a yes person of course is that what we should expect that he's been hired to basically say yes to the president's instincts I think that's right Chuck you know I think that the parallels between Donald Trump and Roger Ailes are striking when they're both bombastic sort of megalomaniacal personalities who surround themselves with basically the people who thrive around them are yes people and so it's not as on some level surprising that bill shine is going to be working for someone that is very much like his previous boss and he thrived at Fox because he was the one person around Roger Ailes who indulged his impulses who encouraged him who baited him and that's really with the kind of surrogates that Donald Trump likes as well you know I've been pondering through us any scenario with which I would find myself at NBC in a situation where the boss boss or somehow ended up in a situation dedup in a situation like this I have a feeling there would be a lot of people appalled a lot of people concerned what's the attitude over it at at the Fox organization you know I think it's split from the people I talked to obviously the the opinion side such that our is I mean obviously the network has a point of view but the sean hannity's Laura engrams I mean those people obviously are happy with this development the news people you know Shepard Smith and others I think are more gassed at this and you saw I think a very telling quote in a BuzzFeed article this week that was very critical of an anonymous Fox executive being very critical of shine so I think there is you know mixed feelings at Fox and for those at Fox who are trying to do somewhat of real journalism this is just further proof that Fox's state TV you have the former Network head now running communications for the White House I was surprised maybe I missed it was there anything from Fox News executives that came out and tried to reassert their independence that they weren't some sort of arm now the White House since basically most of Fox News is you know I guess most of them that still there at one time reported to shine right yeah no I have not seen sort of any messaging out of Fox News or Murdoch's orbit more broadly about sort of drawing a line between the White House and the network I think we should also point out that it was Fox News itself that broke the news of shine shines hiring John Roberts the network's White House correspondent broke the news obviously those relationships were helpful in breaking that story it'll be a fascinating experiment mostly I am very curious to see how the Fox of broadcast organization handles this I think you know in some ways presidents hiring people with media portfolios isn't new but it is pretty new for an executive this high up to be there without question I think obviously it's going to make a lot of uncomfortable moments if shine actually becomes the story but we've seen Fox in the past have no trouble basically ignoring news whether it's the robert muller investigation or other scandals and basically coming up with their own storylines so you know i think they'll have no trouble talking about Hillary Clinton if if bill shine becomes the story Jeb Sherman I will leave it there okay thank you much appreciate it hello youtubers if you're
