SEE WHAT IT IS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD TO TALK TO YOU TONIGHT.
HAVE A GREAT TRIP HOME.
GREAT JOB OVER THERE, AWESOME
REPORTING.
>> I APPRECIATE IT.
>> Martha: JOINED ME NOW ON
SKYPE ON THE ANDREW McCABE
ISSUE IS ALAN DERSHOWITZ.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE SUIT THAT
WAS JUST BROUGHT BY ANDREW
McCABE AGAINST DOJ AND FBI IN
HIS FIRING?
>> I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK SO
LONG.
OF COURSE HE WAS RIGHT TO BRING
THE LAWSUIT.
NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, BUT NO
ONE IS BENEATH THE LAW.
HE'S ENTITLED TO SEE THE
DOCUMENTATION THAT RESULTED IN
HIS REPUTATION BEING DESTROYED.
HE IS ENTITLED TO SEE WHAT
EVIDENCE THEY REALLY HAVE
AGAINST HIM.
HE'S ENTITLED TO CHALLENGE THE
REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.
HE'S ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS
ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS.
IN A HYPERPARTISAN AGE IN WHICH
WE LIVE, PEOPLE WANT TO GET DUE
PROCESS ONLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PO
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PL
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PE
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PI
ON THEIR SIDE AND     AND NOT PN
THE OTHER SIDE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT SIZE.
I ONLY CARE ABOUT DUE PROCESS
AND THE CONSTITUTION.
HE'S ENTITLED TO A MATTER OF DUE
PROCESS TO SEE THE EVIDENCE
AGAINST HIM, TO CONFRONT
WITNESSES AGAINST HIM AND TO BE
TREATED FAIRLY.
>> Martha: FASCINATING.
IN TERMS OF THIS OTHER ROD
ROSENSTEIN ISSUE THAT WE WERE
JUST DISCUSSING AND THE FACT
THAT HE APPEARS TO BE BULLYING
THE LEADERSHIP ON THAT HOUSE
INTEL COMMITTEE AND THREATENING
THEM WITH SUBPOENAS ITSELF OR HE
WOULD LIKE THEM TO PRODUCE, WHAT
DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?
>> THIS IS A CLASSIC DISPUTE
BETWEEN SEPARATION OF POWERS.
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER,
OBVIOUSLY, TO OVERSEE AND
INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTIVE BRANC
BRANCH, AND A MEMBER OF THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, WHICH ROD
ROSENSTEIN'S, SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO BULLY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.
HE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT.
HE SHOULD TURN OVER THE
DOCUMENTS.
HE SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE AND
CONGRESS SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE
WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
WE HAVE SO MUCH DISPUTE TODAY,
PARTISAN DISPUTE.
DISPUTE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE
AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.
THEY ARE ALL REPUBLICANS.
THEY SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING WITH
EACH OTHER.
IT'S ONE THING WHEN YOU HAVE THE
HOUSE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE
DEMOCRATS, WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN
THE END OF THIS YEAR, OR THE
SENATE IN CONTROL OF THE OTHER
PARTY.
HERE WE HAVE EVERYBODY AND THEY
