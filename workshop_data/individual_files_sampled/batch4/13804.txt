here here is what I want to say if you have to censor speech we don't have to censor speech on the show I can have a Nazi I can have a communist on this show he can say whatever he wants I know it's gonna be alright why because my ideas are better than his I know that my ideas are better than his or her and I'm gonna win that argument by the time you finish listen to what he has to say fully and listening to it I have to say I know I will win why because I believe that all people are children of God because I believe they're all made in God's image I can't lose that argument I cannot lose that argument why are they losing the argument in Britain because of identity politics why are they losing it on college campuses because of identity politics if you believe in identity politics you are a racist and if you are a racist you can't win an argument against other racists if you say black lives matter and somebody comes in says white lives matter if you say black black should be given you know the best jobs and somebody comes in so why should be given the best jobs you have no argument you have lost the argument because you have given away the basic tenets the basic principle that made racism untenable in the West we fought the civil war because we believed that all men were created equal we believe that all men were created equal because we were shaped and formed by biblical logic that's how that happened it didn't happen outside of history it happened in history that's how those ideas developed once you give away those basic ideas of equality of true equality equality before God not equality of income not equality of achievement just equality before God and the law once you give away those you have got no argument and you've got to start shutting people down so once you abandon the first principle that we are all created equal not better not worse once you've been in the first principle all the other principles fall like dominoes and that's why the identity politics equals racism racism equals censorship because racism is just about power right it's just about power it's who wins
