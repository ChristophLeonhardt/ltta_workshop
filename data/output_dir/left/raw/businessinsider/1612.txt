00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040

hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> fees you're probably in a</font>

relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the wrong financial</font>

advisor<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there shouldn't be any</font>

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,610
hidden fees so the first thing a client

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,379
or a prospective client should ask their

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,920
financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor is is the fee that I'm</font>

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,189
paying you the 60 80 100 basis points

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,320
fee that I'm paying you to give me

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,310
service is that the only way you or your

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,399
firm are making money from me now the

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,140
financial advisor if they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,420
a large brokerage firm may try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> parse</font>

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,770
their answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the only</font>

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,050
fee that I get and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,850
sufficient answer you have to dig in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,320
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I understand that you're</font>

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,440
getting 70 or 80 basis points but are

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,899
the products that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> being sold is</font>

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">their money that's going from me back to</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> firm someplace that I need to</font>

22
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,469
understand and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is an</font>

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,600
unequivocal know then you're probably

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
working with the fiduciary if the answer

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,340
is a hedge or a hesitation or a shucking

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,989
and jiving then there's probably

27
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,700
something there that's hidden and you

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,710

on to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> their rules and the duties</font>

probably on the right track and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

50
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,500
should ask them for the documentation or

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,320
a contract that puts in writing the

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,610
things that they're saying to you

53
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,649
verbally to simply confirm that what
