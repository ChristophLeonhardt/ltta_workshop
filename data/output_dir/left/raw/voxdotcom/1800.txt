1
00:00:00,909 --> 00:00:06,240
These mosquito larvae in a lab at Imperial
College in London have been genetically engineered

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,690
to glow red under a laser.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,500
But that red fluorescence is just a marker
-- It’s there to tell the researchers that

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,719
something profound has happened.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,420
I ran out and I grabbed my supervisor
... I was like Tony but you know you've got

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,430
to look at this.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,740
So we started going through and I read them
off one by one and I was like red, red, red,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,060
red and we just...

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,200
It was a very crazy time.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,400
We just started screaming and getting
super excited.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,920
Since only one of their parents had a copy
of the red gene, you’d expect around 50%

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,210
of the larvae to be red.

13
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,340
But nearly 100% of them were glowing.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,309
The researchers had hacked the rules of inheritance
with what’s called a gene drive.

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:47,199
But the red gene isn’t the point - it’s
been linked to a genetic tool that renders

16
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,650
female mosquitoes infertile.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,989
And that’s a huge deal because this isn’t
just any old mosquito species.

18
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,559
This is anopheles gambiae,
one of the mosquitos that carries the parasite

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,940
that causes malaria.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,910
So malaria is mostly a sub-saharan African
disease.

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:13,680
It affects people in the Indian subcontinent,
Southeast Asia, but it’s primarily a disease

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,130
of Sub-Saharan Africa.

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,480
And the majority of malaria deaths in any
given year in the world, hundreds of thousands

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,740
of deaths, are kids under 5 in Africa.

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,980
Over the past 15 years, there’s been a big
investment in bed nets, insecticides, and

26
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:28,981
better treatment.

27
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:33,160
And I think the result has been a lot of steady
progress on malaria.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:39,100
That being said, it’s progress against a
really, really high death rate.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,020
Most African countries really want to try
to eliminate it and WHO is really in support

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,050
of this, they’ve set some targets to achieve
in 2030.

31
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,150
And where we stand now, we don’t seem to
be on course for achieving those.

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,620
While researchers continue to work on a vaccine,
genetic approaches to malaria look increasingly

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,960
promising.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Genetically modified mosquitoes aren’t new
- a company called Oxitec has released mosquitoes

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,260
in Brazil that are designed to have nonviable
offspring.

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,590
But those don’t contain a gene drive, which
biases inheritance so that the modification

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,030
continues to be passed through a population,
though they can also be designed to have a

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
more local reach.

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,080
The idea of driving desirable genes into insect
populations dates back decades,

40
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,720
but progress toward that goal jumped ahead
after the invention of the CRISPR gene editing

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,220
tool in 2012.

42
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,340
CRISPR allows scientists make precise changes
to DNA in the lab.

43
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,450
A CRISPR gene drive could let them push those
changes through a wild population of insects.

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,340
It works by inserting the gene editing tool
itself into a chosen segment of the mosquito’s

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,000
DNA.

46
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,780
From there, CRISPR induces the cell to copy
the package onto the matching chromosome.

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,400
Like us, mosquitoes have 2 copies of each
gene, one from each parent.

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,819
And now that the gene drive is on both chromosomes,
it will get passed on to all the offspring,

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,790
where it will copy onto their other chromosome,
and so on.

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,470
So depending on what biologists attach to
that package, like the red fluorescent gene,

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,780
they can make some drastic changes to wild
populations.

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,440
There are two broad approaches to malaria
mosquitoes.

53
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,370
The team at Imperial College is part of an
international group called Target Malaria,

54
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,100
funded mostly by the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation.

55
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,560
And they’re aiming to use gene drives to
suppress mosquito populations.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,450
Their drives are designed to spread female
infertility or to prevent females from being

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,750
born, with the effect of shrinking a population
of mosquitoes.

58
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,370
Then there’s a team of researchers at the
University of California institutions

59
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,150
who have been developing a gene drive that
alters, rather than shrinks, the mosquito population.

60
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,990
It spreads genes that make mosquitoes resistant
to the malaria parasite, so they don’t transmit

61
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,280
it between humans.

62
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,180
The World Health Organization has outlined
the steps that G.M. mosquitoes should go through

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,820
before being deployed. Gene drive research
is in phase 1 now,

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,540
but to find out if it could really work, they
need to test it outside of a lab.

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,390
And the researchers say their mosquitoes should
be ready for phase 2 soon.

66
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm hoping the science is well within five
years.

67
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,160
Maybe even half that.

68
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,620
Maybe in one or two years.

69
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,230
A couple of years.

70
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,269
But then that's in the lab in London.

71
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,790
After something’s ready in the lab in London
you'd really want to go through very rigorous

72
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,290
testing.

73
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,560
So with every health intervention or technology
there’s kind of a spectrum of how much testing

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,030
and how much certainty people require before
they just try it.

75
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,810
This is always a trade-off in any medical
trial, if you develop a drug and it’s a

76
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,190
miracle and it helps everyone, when do you
stop the trial and just start giving that to everyone?

77
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:48,101
Once we have a gene drive that we can release
in the wild that could wipe out malaria, every

78
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:53,880
year we don’t do that is 500,000 to 700,000,
mostly kids, dying.

79
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,540
Kevin Esvelt the MIT scientist who’s working
on gene drives,

80
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,160
was talking to me and he said
Malaria is a case where there are really strong

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,410
ethical argument of doing something now today
because so many children have died just in

82
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,950
the time that we've been speaking.

83
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,900
I would say at least 20.

84
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,080
And his takeaway from that wasn’t let’s
do this as fast as possible.

85
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,900
It’s let’s do this right, because if we
don’t do this right, then there’s going

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,150
to be a massive backlash and we’re never
going to be able to do anything like this

87
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,860
ever again.

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,260
Yeah if you move forwards with a unilateral
“we are going to save the kids whether you

89
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,040
like it or not,” really does imperil
the broader malaria eradication effort.

90
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,600
Target Malaria has begun a lengthy process
of building facilities and staff in 4 African

91
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,669
countries, where they’ll be working with
non-gene-drive mosquitoes before importing the

92
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,880
gene drive mosquitoes.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,970
And even then, there’s more lab work to
do before an actual release.

94
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,640
So the modified one is modified using a laboratory
strain.

95
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,640
So you have to do experiments to make
sure you incorporate the natural genetic background

96
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,510
of the mosquitoes in the area where you want
to work.

97
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,250
At each stage, they’re consulting with local
communities and with governments about this

98
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,700
genetic technology that’s designed to spread
across borders.

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,280
There are no regulators that have handled
this before.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,140
Not only just in Africa, but anywhere.

101
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,240
I think i’m curious about you know this
notion that we have a public conversation,

102
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:26,169
we need to get people on board, this notion
that that would somehow lead to some clear

103
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,960
consensus or some clear green light.

104
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,770
At some point someone has to decide.

105
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,920
And I’m curious if you have a sense of who
that is.

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,730
Yeah, that’s the million dollar question
and no one I talked to even pretended to have

107
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,460
the answer.

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,000
The end game that got alluded to by a lot
of people was some kind of agreement by the

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
African Union about releasing a self-propagating
drive.

110
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,479
One tricky thing is malaria does not solely

111
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,020
infect people in democratic countries like
Ghana or Senegal.

112
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,660
It also affects people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

113
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,060
which despite
the name is a dictatorship. Countries with

114
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,509
really unstable and in many cases really awful
governance.

115
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:12,850
So one tricky question is, if the African Union
comes together and says yeah we’re ok with

116
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,300
this, is that legitimate?

117
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,640
Are they speaking for people in Africa?

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,100
And I think a lot the work that scientists
are doing is trying to reach out before that

119
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,280
and trying to start a conversation before that to make
sure it’s legitimate.

120
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,080
As the public debate begins, there’s a risk
that the politics of genetically modified

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,730
crops could spill over to the mosquito issue.

122
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,870
Anti-GMO groups like Friends of the Earth
have already called for a moratorium on gene

123
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,979
drive research. They fear it will be misused
by agribusiness and militaries and cause unintended

124
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,440
damage to ecosystems.

125
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,280
No one in this is as big of a son of a bitch
as nature.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,740
Like, nature is so awful in every conceivable way.

127
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,580
It is completely indifferent to suffering.

128
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,240
But I think many of the things we look back
on as humans as our greatest achievements:

129
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,160
getting rid of small pox, penicillin, insulin
for diabetics, mass vaccinations.

130
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,680
Those are all things that involved messing
with nature and either repurposing or tweaking

131
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,330
things that nature created, for our own uses.

132
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,750
Some of the worst things we’ve made have
also done that.

133
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,669
But I look at the earth as something
we've  got to keep going for us and other

134
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,880
animals but I don’t look at it as this morally
benevolent place.

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:54,079
It’s a horror show that we’re trying to
manage as best we can and this is an ambitious

136
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,860
but really interesting way to manage it.

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,260
For a bunch more information about this fascinating topic,

138
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,440
go read Dylan's feature article on Vox.com.

139
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll put a link in

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
the comments. And if you're interested in genetic engineering more broadly,

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
we have an episode on our Netflix show

142
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,600
called "Designer DNA," and it's about genetic engineering in human beings.

143
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,240
That's on Netflix, go check it out. Check out all the other episodes too,

144
00:09:18,240 --> 00:00:00,000
we're publishing them weekly on Wednesdays.
