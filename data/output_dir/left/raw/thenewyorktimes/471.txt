1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,705
It could take anywhere between two and 
a half to four weeks to weave a wig.

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,276
That's working eight hours a day until
your eyeballs

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,379
contract and you can't see anymore.

4
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,621
The easiest weaves is when you
grab as much hair as you can

5
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,123
and you knot it.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,358
If I go overboard,

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,093
a hundred pounds of hair,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,362
It's like feeding a baby a steak.

9
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,931
That's an overkill.

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,302
A nondescript head of hair is the 
most difficult thing to accomplish.

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,244
This was made for you, 
even before I met you.

12
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,715
So I've been doing this 
now for about 45 years,

13
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,052
and I started in 19...

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,321
'69, ’70.  I can’t even remember when.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:02,162
Wigs and hair pieces and hair ornaments
were the standard with people of wealth.

16
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,931
All the wigs were constructed.

17
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,132
They were like, embalmed.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,803
Synthetic hair came in the late sixties.

19
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,007
It allowed everybody to be able to 
afford a wig that was like a joke.

20
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,475
This is just hair,

21
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,177
and water.

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,245
Just like what you do with your hair.

23
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,749
Take the top back, and then

24
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,452
a little to the side.
She likes a little height.

25
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,989
So, what I do in the morning:

26
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,825
I wet it and I just bend 
down and I go like this.

27
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,663
It's like it's my hair. 
And I just go crazy over it.

28
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,599
I'm wearing a wig because I'm alopecia.

29
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,636
The more successful I am,

30
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:47,373
the more  the lady just looks 
like she's got a head of hair.

31
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:54,481
Some of the wigs are made for 
people undergoing chemotherapy,

32
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,316
male pattern baldness.

33
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,952
Some of the wigs are made 
for religious clients,

34
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,321
which would be an orthodox 
Jewish person.

35
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,690
Some of the wigs are made
for theatrical people.

36
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,394
We did a wig recently for the 
cover of New York Magazine.

37
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,662
>The hardest hair to get,

38
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,798
and the most expensive,

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,001
Is your natural light colors from Europe.

40
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,538
My wigs are 99 percent European hair

41
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,007
because that's what my clientele requests.

42
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,710
A lace front wig like this 
in my shop could go from,

43
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,179
$5,500 to about

44
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,414
$8000.

45
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,718
I need to weave the 
hair one strand at a time

46
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,687
>to create that godly effect

47
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,724
It's tremendous labor,

48
00:02:37,757 --> 00:00:00,000
and all the labor is art.
