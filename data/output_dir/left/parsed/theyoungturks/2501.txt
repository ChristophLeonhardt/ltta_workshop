PERHAPS THE MOST COMMONLY
USED ARGUMENT AGAINST RAISING
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS THAT
SUPPOSEDLY IF YOU DO THAT IT
WILL LEAD TO JOB ELIMINATION.
THE IDEA IS YOU ARE TRYING TO
HELP PEOPLE BUT YOU ARE IN FACT
GETTING THEM FIRED.
I HEAR THAT
ALL THE TIME, AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL CHANGE
THEIR MIND ON THAT BASED ON DATA
BEING PRESENTED TO THEM BUT I
WILL TRY ANYWAY, BECAUSE WE HAVE
A NEW STUDY THAT ANALYZED THE
EFFECT ON JOBS OF NOT JUST ONE
TIME THAT THEY RAISED THE
MINIMUM WAGE, IT WAS 137
DIFFERENT CASES WHERE THE
MINIMUM WAGE WAS RAISED, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART, WHAT
YOU ARE SEEING THERE IS RIGHT ON
THE SIDE OF ZERO TO ONE DOLLARS
AROUND THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE, YOU
HAVE JOBS THAT PAY SLIGHTLY LESS
GOING DOWN BY BETWEEN 1 AND
1.5%, IT LOOKS BIG BECAUSE OF
THE SCALE OF THE CHART BUT IT IS
1.5%, AND JOBS THAT PAY MORE
THAN THE NEW MINIMUM WAGE GO UP
BY 1.5%.
THE REST OF THOSE BARS
ARE BASICALLY NOTHING, THEY
AREN'T STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT.
SO WHAT YOU HAVE
THERE 
IS --
>>THIS IS 137 DIFFERENT
INSTANCES WHERE THEY RAISE THE
MINIMUM WAGE, GIVING US
EXPERIENCES IN BOTH CITIES AND
NON-CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
OVER TIME, MANY DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS.
IT DOESN'T KILL
JOBS, POLITICIANS AND
CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS WILL
CONTINUE TO USE THAT AS AN
EXCUSE TO NOT SET THE MINIMUM
WAGE AT A LIVABLE, HUMANE LEVEL,
BUT THE DATA IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
THERE.
TAKE IT UP WITH SCIENCE.
>>THE ONE CASE THEY LOVE TO
REFER TO IS THE SEATTLE CASE.
THE PERSON WHO PUSHED THROUGH
THE HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE IN
SEATTLE, I HAD HER ON REBEL
HEADQUARTERS FAIRLY RECENTLY,
YOU CAN CHECK OUT THAT INTERVIEW
AT TYT POLITICS, MINIMUM WAGE
WENT UP TO $15.
AND THAT ONE
STUDY THEY FOUND OUT THAT IT DID
HURT EMPLOYMENT A LITTLE IN
SEATTLE.
NOW, THE PERSONAL
ANALYZED THAT STUDY, THE OUTSIDE
PERSON WHO ANALYZED IT, AT THE
TIME SAID THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT
THE STUDY INDICATES AND IT'S
FAIR TO POINT THAT OUT.
THEN,
HAVING LOOKED AT THE 137 STUDIES
JOHN IS REFERRING TO, HE WAS
LIKE, NEVERMIND.
BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS, AND
SCIENTISTS KNOW THIS, THEY ARE
GOOD AT MATH, 137 IS LARGER THAN
ONE.
EVEN SO, SCIENTISTS LOOK AT
THIS AND SAY I KNOW IT'S EASY TO
JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS AND HOW IT'S
COVERED IN THE NEWS, PEOPLE WILL
USE IT FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL
BENEFITS, BUT EVEN THESE HAVEN'T
BEEN PEER-REVIEWED ENOUGH.
YOU
HAVE TO DO PEER-REVIEWED, AND
THEN YOU CAN REACH CONCLUSIONS.
AND THEN ONE OF THE FOLKS
INVOLVED IN THE FIRST STUDY, I
BELIEVE, WENT ON TO MAKE AN
INTERESTING POINT, WE WILL HAVE
TO SEE IF IT'S BORNE OUT, IT'S
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TO OUR
POLITICAL ADVANTAGE, BUT WE TRY
AS HARD AS WE CAN TO NOT COLOR
THE FACTS FOR YOU GUYS, GIVE YOU
THE FACTS AND THEN GIVE YOU OUR
OPINIONS.
SO HE SAYS THE REASON
WHY SEATTLE EMPLOYMENT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN HURT A LITTLE BIT
BASED ON THAT ONE STUDY IS
BECAUSE THE JUMP IN MINIMUM WAGE
WAS SO SIGNIFICANT.
HE SAYS THAT
JUMP WAS ABOUT 37% FROM THE
PREVIOUS MINIMUM WAGE, AND FOR
THE META STUDY OF 137 CASES
WHERE THE MINIMUM WAGE WENT UP,
THE OVERALL JUMP WAS 10%.
MINIMUM WAGE WAS ONLY INCREASED
BY 10% ON AVERAGE, SO WITH THAT
INCREASE IT USUALLY DOESN'T LEAD
TO LESS EMPLOYMENT, IN FACT IT
LEADS TO SLIGHTLY MORE
EMPLOYMENT AND AT HIGHER WAGES.
AND AGAIN, LET THAT GET
PEER-REVIEWED, ETC., SO IF YOU
WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THAT
BEFORE THE PEER REVIEWS, MAYBE
WE MIGHT NOT WANT A 37% JUMP IN
THE MINIMUM WAGE --
>>ABRUPTLY.
>>AND YOU ARE IRONICALLY
PUNISHING THE PLACES THAT HAVE
THE LOWEST MINIMUM WAGE BY NOT
INCREASING THEM HIGHER, BUT I
GET IT, IT'S RELEVANT DATA YOU
COULD LOOK AT.
SO DON'T GET
COLORED BY YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE,
LOOK AT THE FACTS FIRST.
AND IF
IT TURNS OUT THEY LOOKED AT 137
CASES, AND THE MINIMUM NATIONAL
WAGE IS SO LOW THAT LOCATIONS
MIGHT CHANGE IT BY 
DIFFERENT
AMOUNTS, IT CREATES ALL THESE
EXPERIMENTS AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO
COME UP WITH A LOT MORE STUDIES,
THEN PEER-REVIEW THEM, THAT WE
WILL HAVE MORE DEFINITIVE
ANSWERS.
WHETHER YOU LIKE THOSE
ANSWERS OR YOU DON'T I THINK
THEY ARE INTERESTING AND WILL BE
INDICATIVE OF SOMETHING.
AND I
WILL LOOK AT IT AND IF THEY TELL
ME IT TURNS OUT IF YOU JUMP
MINIMUM WAGE MORE THAN 25% AT
ONE TIME IT COSTS JOBS, I WILL
GO THEN THAT'S WHAT IT DOES SO
LET'S THINK ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS
RIGHT.
BECAUSE THE CORRECT
ANSWER ISN'T THE ONE YOU HAD
BEFORE THE FACTS, IT'S THE ONE
YOU HAVE AFTER THE FACTS.
>>IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE
GRADUAL RAISING OF THE WAGE, AS
OPPOSED TO THE SUDDEN INCREASE
-- AND THERE HAS TO BE A
THRESHOLD, THAT IS WHAT CENK IS
SAYING, AT SOME POINT WE WILL
KNOW WHAT THAT THRESHOLD IS AT
LEAST FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE
TIME, IT APPEARS THAT THAT IS
THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO RAISE
THE MINIMUM WAGE.
BUT THE
MINIMUM WAGE CRITICISMS HAVE
BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH FEWER JOBS,
AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO SHOOT
THAT OUT OF THE WATER, AND ALSO
A DRAG ON THE ECONOMY.
IT COSTS
BUSINESSES MORE, THEY WILL
EMPLOY FEWER PEOPLE, AND THAT
HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL DISPROVEN.
IT BECOMES AN ENGINE OF THE
ECONOMY ONCE PEOPLE HAVE MORE
MONEY.
THAT GETS MORE MONEY INTO
THE SYSTEM.
SO THERE ARE A FEW
CONCLUSIONS TO BE MADE, AND IT'S
TOUGH TO GET THESE PEER-REVIEWED
STUDIES NOW BECAUSE THERE IS
SUCH A DEMAND ON INFORMATION.
WHAT IS YOUR STUDY ON MINIMUM
WAGE, WE NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW,
I NEED TO PUBLISH IT.
SO IT'S
HARDER AND HARDER TO GET THAT
RESEARCH OUT THERE, BUT IT
APPEARS AS THOUGH THESE RISES
AND INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM
WAGE REALLY DO HELP THE OVERALL
ECONOMY AND DO HELP THE
JOBLESSNESS PROBLEM.
>>AND IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING,
BUT HELPS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUDDENLY MAKING SLIGHTLY MORE
MONEY.
>>AN ACTUAL LIVING WAGE.
>>I HOPE THIS IS WIDELY
PUBLISHED AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
THIS, BUT WILL IT CONVINCE PAUL
RYAN AND A LOT OF PEOPLE?
NO,
BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY ALL THEY
WANT THAT THEY ARE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT JOB LOSSES BUT THEY DON'T
CARE AT ALL ABOUT THAT.
HERE IS
WHAT YOU DON'T NEED A STUDY TO
KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECT OF RAISING
THE MINIMUM WAGE, IS YOU HAVE TO
PAY PEOPLE MORE.
THAT I KNOW
HAPPENS, AND THEY DON'T WANT
THAT.
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY
OF THE CONSEQUENCES, THEY
DON'T WANT TO PAY YOU.
THEY WOULD PAY YOU ZERO IF THEY
COULD.
>>ALL THAT RHETORIC ABOUT THE
MIDDLE CLASS AND THE WORKING MAN
AND BEING THE PARTY OF WORKING
PEOPLE, IT'S TOTAL B.S. AS JOHN
SAYS IT'S INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST, THEY JUST DON'T WANT
MORE MONEY GOING TO THOSE PEOPLE
MAKING MINIMUM WAGE.
>>AND ONE MORE THING ABOUT
LOGIC AND FACTS -- CORPORATIONS
ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CARE ABOUT
YOUR FEELINGS, THEY HAVE TO
MAXIMIZE PROFITS.
SO WHAT IS ONE
WAY LOGICALLY THEY WOULD
MAXIMIZE PROFIT?
IT'S TO
SUPPRESS YOUR WAGES, SO EVERY
PENNY YOU MAKE IS UP PENNY OF
PROFIT THEY DON'T MAKE.
SO THEY
WILL BRING DOWN YOUR WAGES TO
THE LOWEST POSSIBLE POINT UNTIL
THEY REACH A BREAKING POINT AND
PEOPLE WON'T WORK FOR THEM
ANYMORE.
THEY HAVE A FIDUCIARY
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT.
SO
THE SECOND WAY YOU MAKE MONEY IS
BUY POLITICIANS ON THE OPEN
MARKET, BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM
THAT ALLOWS FOR LEGALIZED
BRIBERY IN AMERICA, BECAUSE THE
POLITICIANS WILL THEN MAKE SURE
THE MINIMUM WAGE DOESN'T
INCREASE, SO THAT ALL THOSE
EXTRA PENNIES AND DOLLARS STAY
IN THE CORPORATIONS AS PROFIT
AND AREN'T PAID TO THE
EMPLOYEES.
ALL THIS IS VERY
LOGICAL.
THAT IS WHY WHEN YOU
HAVE A STUDY LIKE THE SEATTLE
STUDY, ONE OUT OF THE 137, AND I
LOOKED AT THE WASHINGTON POST
STORY, WHO DID THE STUDY?
WAS AT
THE KOCH BROTHERS, ETC., IT
WASN'T, IT WAS LEGITIMATE ACTORS
AND PROFESSORS, ETC. -- AND BY
ACTORS I DON'T MEAN TV ACTORS --
HONEST ACTORS AND PROFESSIONALS
WHO DID THIS STUDY, SO IT'S A
LEGITIMATE STUDY YOU SHOULD LOOK
AT.
BUT TO JOHN'S POINT, THEN
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A VESTED
INTEREST IN KEEPING YOUR WAGES
LOW TOOK THAT STUDY AND DID
PROPAGANDA TO NO END, NONSTOP
TALKING ABOUT IT, AS IF IT'S THE
ONLY STUDY DONE ON MINIMUM
WAGES.
>>AND AS IF IT HAS ANYTHING TO
SAY ABOUT GRADUAL, SMALLER
CHANGES HAPPENING IN PLACES
OTHER THAN SEATTLE.
>>SO IT'S LIKELY THE ONLY STUDY
YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT OUTSIDE THIS
SHOW IS THE SEATTLE STUDY, BUT
IN REALITY THERE ARE 137 STUDIES
AND THEY SAY THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT THE SEATTLE STUDY SAYS.
OVERALL IT NOT ONLY INCREASES
THE NUMBER OF JOBS, BUT DON'T
FORGET, IT ALSO INCREASES YOUR
WAGES.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO
INCREASE YOUR WAGES THAT ARE NOW
PUBLICIZING THE ONE INSTEAD OF
THE 137 STUDIES.
