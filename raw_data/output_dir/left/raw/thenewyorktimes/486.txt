1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,210
I'm Thomas Fuller, and I need cash.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,780
I've reported here in Myanmar dozens
of times, and know that converting

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,220
to kyat the local currency,
can be a journey in itself.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,500
This one you can't change?

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,970
>> No change.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,030
>> You can't change this for me?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,470
>> No.
>> The problem with this bill

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,880
appears to be this little tear.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,970
In the top.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,150
They weren't as bothered
with the writing, but

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,590
there's also a crease in the bill.

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,730
>> Basically,
the bills need to look brand new.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,090
And in Myanmar, they take that
requirement very literally.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,520
If you can't get your hands
on these kinds of bills,

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,070
you could be in trouble.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,710
>> This one is new, perfect.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,200
But because it was
folded they said no.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,050
>> Yes.
>> Seven pounds [INAUDIBLE] jacket.

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,040
>> When I left Australia I
bought perfect $100 bills.

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,770
But when I went to the bank they
refused to take it because it had

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,200
a tiny little fold on the corner.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,140
>> After I gave them
my perfect money,

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,489
they gave me back a wadded up brown
piece of money I couldn't even read.

24
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,390
It looked like they got it off
the floor or out of the trash or

25
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,050
something.

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,830
It was.

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,900
I didn't even really wanna touch it.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,740
>> A bit of a double standard.

29
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,100
But as Myanmar struggles
to join the global economy,

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,170
I think the fussiness may
hinder more than help.

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,550
Ask whose media company
generates a lot of cash.

32
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,220
>> We have 18 people just
to count the cash, go and

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,590
pick up cash, go and
pay cash to someone somewhere.

34
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,730
In our previous office building,
which was not open like this,

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:41,070
it was a closed room,
all this mold, fungus,

36
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,310
odor, that was just coming out,
just was making them sick.

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,730
So we had to put in super powerful
exhaust fans, move them into

38
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,100
a bigger room so that there
wouldn't be this congested smell,

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,930
dampening the whole room.

40
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,740
>> Right.
>> This is the smell of money.

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,800
>> Smell of money.

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,190
Yes.

43
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,030
>> So why do the Burmese care so
much about perfect bills.

44
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,050
I tried calling the central bank,
but

45
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,580
they said no one could
answer our questions.

46
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,889
I wonder if Uton Lewin,

47
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,920
the deputy chairman of Myanmar's
largest commercial bank has an idea.

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,000
>> When we ship this
currency abroad,

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,280
to deposit at these foreign banks,
particularly in Singapore.

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,180
They always examine,

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,770
and sometimes it's oh no you're
this poor, you need to discern.

52
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,550
We won't give you the 100% now.

53
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,760
So it's not an American bank,
because we under sanction.

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,870
So the government banks said oh,

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,010
we can only accept buffet bill,
buffet bill.

56
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,860
No more, because otherwise
we are going to lose.

57
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,190
>> Okay, but I still need a place
to exchange my dirty money.

58
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,210
At this point, it seems like
Bogyoke Market is my best bet.

59
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,300
It's a rabbit warren of
checkers games, tea stalls, and

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,790
money changers.

61
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,750
Someone might be willing
to take a chance.

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,660
>> No change.

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,490
>> You can't change this for me?

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,800
Because of the rip.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,410
Oh.

66
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,170
Strike one.

67
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,130
This one you can't change?

68
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,270
Strike two.

69
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, well, nevermind.

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,870
Okay.

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,740
Finally, someone bites.

72
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,630
[INAUDIBLE]
>> That's a different rate for

73
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,240
smaller notes.

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,020
So I give you new notes and
you give me.

75
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,670
It's like stained with blood or
something.

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,720
Thanks.

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,650
Back in Bogyoke Market, a freelance
money exchanger approaches me to

78
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,050
take the last of my cash.

79
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you got?
What's your rate?

80
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,240
>> 1,050.

81
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,300
>> So it's about a 15%-
>> Yeah.

82
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,460
>> Cut that I have to take.

83
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,160
>> Yeah.

84
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,780
I give you.

85
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,240
>> Because, but why,
what's the problem?

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,510
>> This is not right.

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
>> It's the writing on this bill.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,820
>> Yeah.

89
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,370
>> So I gave you that bill, so
these bills are kind of old?

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,980
>> But no problem!

91
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,670
>> No problem, right.

92
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,209
>> [INAUDIBLE] no problem!

93
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,759
Okay, this one is ripped here.

94
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,980
That's okay?

95
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,270
>> [INAUDIBLE]
no problem.

96
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,730
>> All right, thanks.

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,190
It's a bum deal but
at this point, I'll take it.

98
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,660
So there you have it.

99
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,540
If you're traveling to Myanmar make
sure to bring along a pristine stack

100
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,630
of US dollar bills.

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,720
Tell us what you think about it.

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,410
We'd love to see your comments.

103
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,810
There's also an underground
market for chat notes.

104
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,700
Freshly minted,
which you can obtain for a price.

105
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,360
Follow the link to that story.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,560
There's also a New York Times
investigation into the heroin

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,820
heartland in Myanmar.

108
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,250
Opium country in
Southern Shan State.

109
00:04:57,250 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a link for that, too.
