00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
hey everyone hope all is well 2016 is

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,779
almost over and what a remarkable year

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,700
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been I actually wasn't planning</font>

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,559
on making a video this week because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,269
currently working on an end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,860
review which for anyone who's been

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching my videos for many years will</font>

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,029
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with this format that i'm</font>

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,250
resurrecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm very much looking</font>

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,900
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it even though it's going to</font>

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,420
be such a hellish task to complete and

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,220
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought this would actually be a</font>

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,070
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer a question</font>

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,689
I've been asked quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

15
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,450
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past two years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is</font>

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,790
regarding many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t shirts that I</font>

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,010
wear in my videos and when I'm out and

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,550
about back in 2014 my band<font color="#CCCCCC"> squamata</font>

19
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,440
theory was planning a music video shoot

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,530
for our single courage is contagious

21
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,670
which is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surveillance state</font>

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,100
and whistleblowers like Edward Snowden

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,590
and so I was looking online for a

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,480
t-shirt to wear that would fit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,820
the theme of that video which I'm

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,430
wearing now better and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

27
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,199
called all riots so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ordered their</font>

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,090
shirt wore it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> music video and</font>

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,640
kept going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back because I loved so many</font>

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,060
of their designs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I emailed them to show</font>

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,790
my appreciation and as a result I became

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good friends with the designer</font>

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,900
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a really interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> backstory</font>

34
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,340
she actually worked in the mainstream

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,619
fashion industry for many years so she

36
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,689
has a lot of experience when it comes to

37
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,150
designing clothing but she got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,770
point where she wasn't enjoying it as

39
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,020
much she had several disagreements with

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,729
the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she was working in and</font>

41
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,340
she wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start making clothing that</font>

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,520
sent out positive messages and promoted

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,540
social change thus creating all riot but

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,189
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two main questions I get asked</font>

45
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,409
about the shirts number one does<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

46
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,840
pay me to wear their shirts the short

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,540
and simple answer is no the slightly

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,000
longer answer is we've become really

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,520
good friends I really respect the work

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,950
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she does and I really hope that she</font>

51
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,930
succeeds in the activism she conducts

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,600
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avenue and she feels the</font>

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">same way about me in the work that I do</font>

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,350
and so we sparked off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font>

55
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,780
relationship where if I'm creating a

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,610
video on a particular topic and she has

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,770
a design that fits in with that she'll

58
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,930
send me a free shirt to wear and I

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,269
happily<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on my videos and the</font>

60
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,010
second question I get asked a lot is

61
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,319
what does your shirt say because I

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,299
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it most of my videos when I'm</font>

63
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,310
sat down like this you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

64
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,439
get to see the full shirt when I used to

65
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,180
do them standing up it was a lot clearer

66
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,290
but this is the current format<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use and</font>

67
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,959
maybe one day oh no it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

68
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so in this video i thought i'd show</font>

69
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,579
you just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the shirts that I</font>

70
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,220
really love

[Applause]

74
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,550
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love wearing these shirts</font>

75
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,050
when I'm out and about because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

76
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,150
proven to be such a great conversation

77
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,730
starter with members of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public my</font>

78
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,980
band was playing a show in Brighton a

79
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,680
year ago and when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying some</font>

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,569
krispy kremes the guy behind the counter

81
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,940
looks at my shirts which was the no

82
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,580
fracking way one and he said we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,230
real problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with fracking round here</font>

84
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that connection in that</font>

85
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,239
moment is always a powerful exchange

86
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,830
because when you are fighting for

87
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,810
particular causes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you believe in</font>

88
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,000
making those connections makes you

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,709
realize there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

90
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve those common goals</font>

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,299
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> every year they organize a photo</font>

92
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,549
shoot<font color="#E5E5E5"> where fans of their brand can come</font>

93
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,040
down and get professional photos taken

94
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,329
of them wearing the different shirts

95
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:45,250
never saw myself as been much of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

96
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">before but there you go it was really</font>

97
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">good fun and yeah as I've said already</font>

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,099
the thing I love most about all riot is

99
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,079
it's allowed me to make so many new

100
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,660
connections with people went out and

101
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,120
about on really important issues and

102
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,170
obviously I've made a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

103
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,660
with the designer behind this company

104
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,269
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone who's seen last week's</font>

105
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,720

joining the dots and if you don't know
