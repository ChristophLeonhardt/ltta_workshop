so with us Republican congressman Brian mast of Florida congressman mast is out with a new op-ed for the New York Times entitled I'm Republican I appreciate assault weapons and I support a ban and he writes in part this the most important and Unruh Greta bull time of my life was the twelve years I spent in the army I became a bomb technician because I wanted to save lives I nearly gave my own life for that I lost both my legs and a finger when a roadside bomb detonated beneath me and I have known more heroes than I can count who died defending others when I was with others on the battlefield and we saw a chance to save a life we didn't have a meeting about it we acted immediately I never worried about becoming a casualty myself now as a Republican congressman from Florida I don't fear becoming a political casualty either if we act now by changing laws surrounding firearms and mental illness we too can save lives congressman thank you so much for being with us what's the reaction been to your op-ed I think it's been exactly what you could expect I've had a lot of people come up to me and maybe moreso whisper in my ear you know they're proud of me for saying it and you know they back me some people that starkly disagree with me and some people that are just beside themselves never expected me to say something like this pretty pretty mixed bag across the board and there was a part of what you what you wrote that echoes what James Fallows wrote in the Atlantic in 1981 when he said that the Pentagon concluded that an ar-15 would have been more lethal than the weapons our soldiers used in Vietnam because it was lighter less of a kickback they could carry more ammo you you also talked about the weapons that you use that were like the ar-15 and you use them because they were the most lethal and they they were made to kill people explain that to our viewers look I carried an m4 carbine on the battlefield the set up of mine was about a 14 and a half inch barrel I had an ACOG on it that's a more of a law distant side I had a tragic on for close quarters combat normally carried 10 magazines of 20 rounds of peace extended charging handle a lot of different things about it that I could describe and all that is actually what really makes it difficult to actually define what a tactical weapon or an assault weapon is because is it the length of the barrel the color of it the magazine capacity all these different things there's not a great definition out there but what I can say is that the army put this weapon in my hands because it was the best weapon to go out there and kill on the battlefield in the most dangerous country on earth that's why they put it in my hands they didn't say hey here take this we hope you're gonna be ok with it they put it in my hands with confidence knowing that I could go out there and do that job and you know that's been my take is that that my community my country is not safer with this unfettered access of anybody that's 18 years or older having access to this platform which is basically the weapon you carries basically like the ar-15 right very similar there's some differences mine had a three round burst and you know a few other things but very similar weapon yeah I think so congressman I have a question for you you know there are obviously a lot of Americans you buy the ar-15 for fun because they like it and want to shoot it and how do you talk to those people in America and say look it's time for that fund and you can't have these weapons anymore so what's the case you can make to them for why they should not be having these weapons one said number one I'm not a proponent for going into anybody's home and confiscating people out of people's homes we're not Russia under Stalin or China under Mao that your sales a humidor yes that's not who we are we're talking about future sales here but you know what I tell them look I'm almost a lifelong NRA member I know the pride of owning a weapon of collecting of going out there and hunting you know shooting with family doing clays going out there and putting rounds onto steel with my kids I do it all the time but we got to look at keeping our community safe and protecting our children and protecting our schools and you know I heard your last segment about you know is there common ground can Republicans and Democrats get together I think this is one of the most important points that I could make to you haven't heard one Republicans say that they have confidence in stopping the next Nicholas Cruz from getting a firearm I haven't heard one Democrats say they have confidence in stopping the next Omar Mateen I haven't heard one independent say they have confidence in stopping the net in screening out the next Steven paddock there is common ground here and the president agrees as well he agrees that there's not confidence at the the federal level with the FBI or at the state level with the various agencies so we need to look at that we need to take that as a jumping-off point to come together and not retreat to our own corners but come together and say let's move forward here from here let's look let's look at this in a common-sense way and who has access what they have access to what are the screening procedures and how do we keep people safe in places like schools especially but also at a movie theater or at a park where we play with our children or at any other public gathering place and that has to be the approach to this Mike Bryan in the midst of all this trauma and tragedy there's big money big money yeah but I think we're also in the middle of a very important inflection point here we're starting to see companies take a social stand I think a lot of companies are frustrated by the inaction of Congress not just on this issue on a lot of issues and I think that this is a very important point in our time because those are companies that have cut their ties discount programs partnerships with the NRA we're starting to see corporate America come out and maybe fill that gap where they're saying okay we can't maybe do anything but at least we're gonna make a stand on this issue this is a multi-billion dollar industry there are three publicly traded companies that make ar-15 style weapons because remember that's a style of gun not a specific gun but there are hundreds of smaller privately held companies I visit in fact one of the biggest shooting ranges is about five or six miles directly west where the congressman was just sitting you look at Blackrock there we heard that Blackrock this weekend was going to start seeing what they held it appears that Blackrock actually is more invested in these companies and so this an important point because a lot of viewers out there who owned some stocks may say well I would never own a gun stock they probably do probably all of us in some ways own gun stocks indirectly the reason Blackrock is the biggest holder is they're the biggest creator of many of these index funds and ETFs which just mirror an index so they buy all the stocks that an index of a gun stock is they're teachers of California Florida Kentucky Texas New York they own gun stocks in their pension plans Blackrock came out kind of a mealy-mouthed comma this we could say weren't engage the gun companies and talk to him talk about the movement of stocks though Donald Trump gets elected gun stocks go down because gun owners feel relieved we're okay now tragedies happen gun stocks go up because Pete they used to dissident this this is again an important point you're bringing up Mike which is this when we've had these kinds of things in the past there have been far too many as a Virginia Tech graduate trust me it hurts still we saw gun stocks go up the idea being mica that people would go out whenever we hear calls for bands or bigger people rush out they buy more guns and the guns that just didn't happen this time guys the gun stocks actually fell and I wonder if we're reaching that social moment where the just the the sick of it nature of American corporate America coming out the gun stocks have actually fallen it's one of the first time that has actually happened by the way it should be noted that 20 years ago I think you're in office Smith & Wesson tried to come out with a smart gun they got a three million dollar grant from the US government they said we'll help develop this technology we're only the owner of the gun can fire it it's got a fingerprint sensor or whatever the industry basically ate its own Smith & Wesson stock fell 85% they cancelled the program the industry itself went after Smith & Wesson which is now called American Outdoor brand congressman math just finally with great respect to your piece in the new york times what was it now that was different for you I always have to look at the opportunity to save life that's what my life has always been about that's what it was about in the military you opened up with saying that I've never regretted a moment when I had an opportunity to save a life and nobody is going to regret a moment in if they say they're doing everything that they can to protect their country to protect their community to protect the kids in their area let's do that let's not retreat to our corners in the way that so often happens let's come together and have the real conversation and I think will make all of Americans proud if we can do that that doesn't mean that we all get on the exact same page and that we all come together you and I are definitely not on the same pages as it pertains to every bit of this conversation but we come together and we have the conversation and we get to real solutions and we'll make Americans well I mean it's so important again congressman I don't know your your entire background as far as as far as guns go but that's the thing we have to start talking in shades of gray instead of black and white I mean my views on guns are far more conservative than most of my viewers views on gun there are a couple of areas I disagree with with the NRA I'm sure you're the same way we've got to be able though to have these sort of conversations and and talk in shades of grey if we're gonna move that move the debate forward do you think you think the debate moves forward I think the debate does move forward you know look I'm a firm believer there aren't evil weapons there are evil people there are good people the the firearm is going to be used in the way that that person does it that's the truth about it I'm a die-hard Second Amendment supporter but I look at it and say we can't go out there and purchase the squad automatic weapon that some of the people would carry you know a fully automatic weapon we can't go out there and purchase hand grenades we can't go out there and purchase an 84 rocket there are limits and we need to evaluate those limits and look at what they are that's a real conversation that we can have that doesn't infringe upon the Second Amendment it's looking at what are those boundaries what are the left and right limits of that that's an account that's a conversation that we should have congressman Brian masse thank you very much and thank you for your service and sacrifice for this country Brian thank you as well and still I had an interview with a student who survived the Parkland
