as Levante here at CPAC well you see so many great people like I say it's my Twitter feed come alive everyone I follow and I'm a fan of I get to see them in person including Candace owns who is the urban engagement officer for Turning Point USA again Canada it's so great to see you I'm so excited to be here well tell me you were an official speaker what was your message to CPAC I was so I was on the piano we were talking about fake news which was so fun and everyone up there was talking about the pitfalls of fake news but I largely optimistic about it I think fake news is amazing and it's the reason that the conservative movement is growing what happens when the media starts to lie on the American people or the Canadian people right is that you get a bunch of disenfranchised refugees that are looking for a new part they believe in and that's where we swoop in and conservatives are winning because of that well this is a funny thing because what I regard as fake news the mainstream media says no this is the story and vice versa isn't fake news just sort of shorthand for I don't like your opinion right that's exactly what it's become Charlie Kirk coined the phrase destination journalism so they've already got the headlines written and then they try to make the facts match the headlines they're already trying to sell it's just propaganda at this point you don't want to ask you a question I mean one of the reasons I love America is it's love for freedom and your First Amendment is so strong it protects journalists we don't have that in Canada and so a couple of weeks ago our prime minister said that he wants Facebook to crack down on fake news and if they don't he will and I thought that would never fly in America are you worried though that Facebook on its own and YouTube on its own and Twitter on their own will do things that really restricts our ability to have conversations amongst ourselves right sunny we will do they are actively doing that they are picking who they're giving check marks to and I don't know if you guys know how the check mark system works but if you have a check mark your ideas are put to the top of everybody speed validation exactly when they check official people right it goes up so I have a hundred and forty K followers on Twitter no check mark there are people that were in the parkland shooting that are now advocating for democratic policies and they were gave me a check mark check marks immediately so that's already going on to wrap it up I just want to apologize to the Canadian people for having just you know I don't know how you guys are dealing with that we call that a female president over here yeah absolutely awful embarrassing and and by the way it's mankind that is great to see I'm so pleased that you fight the fight you've got that happy warrior spirit give us a word of encouragement in Canada you've got Donald Trump you're shaking things up down here turning point USA is doing amazing work in Canada sometimes it feels like we're behind enemy lines if you had one thing to say the Canadians who love freedom what would it be just to find your voice at for people that don't know I started making videos six months ago and I I just spoke on the main stage at CPAC it's all about coming together and understand the power will always be in the hands of the people if people are willing to come together and fight corruption so that's not one messages get involved and fight the good fight all right words to live by Candice great to meet you again we see a keep up the fight Cheers we're at CPAC it's a giant conservative conference in Washington DC I got to say I've seen some Canadians here though hey if you want to see all our videos from CPAC go to the rebel dot media slash rebel CPAC you
