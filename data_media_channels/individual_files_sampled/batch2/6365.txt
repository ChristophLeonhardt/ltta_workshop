TAYLOR SWIFT, SHE IS IN THE NEWS. SHE'S IN THE NEWS BECAUSE THE ACLU REACHED OUT TO HER LAWYER AND SOME PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING THAT HER LEGAL TEAM IS TRYING TO CONTAIN OR STRICT FREEDOM OF SPEECH. HERE IS WHAT HAPPENED. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS HONESTLY UNTIL WE START TALKING ABOUT IT BUT APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE ON THE ALL RIGHTS HAVE FOUND SOME SYMBOLISM THEY LIKE WITHIN HER LYRICS, ESPECIALLY IN THE SONG AND THE VIDEO FOR LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO. THERE WAS A BLOGGER FROM POP FRONT WHO WROTE THIS ABOUT THAT SINGLE: SAYING THEY FOUND SOME NAZI IMAGERY IN THE VIDEO, WE HAVE AN IMAGE OF IT ACTUALLY, TAYLOR LOOKING OUT OVER THIS ROOM FULL OF MODELS FROM A PODIUM AND THIS WRITER, THIS BLOGGER SAYS THAT THAT IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT HITLER DID. HER LAWYERS RESPONDED TO POP FRONT. YOU CAN SEE, THAT IS WHAT THE MODELS LOOK LIKE IN THE AUDIENCE THERE. HER LAWYER SENT A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER TO THIS WRITER, MEGAN HURTING AND HER LAWYER SAID: SO THAT PROMPTED THE WRITER, MEGAN HURTING TO CONTACT ACLU AND THE LAWYERS FROM THE ACLU HAVE SENT A LAWYER TO TAYLOR SWIFT'S LAWYER SAYING: THERE YOU SEE THE ACLU DEFENDING THIS BLOGGER'S FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND NOW THERE ARE SOME ARTICLES OUT THERE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT HER LAWYERS ARE TRYING TO SILENCE THIS WRITER. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT THIS? IT'S THE STREISAND EFFECT AGAIN. YOU SAY DON'T TALK ABOUT THIS ARTICLE THAT TAYLOR SWIFT DIDN'T LIKE. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE AND NOW WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I THINK THIS IS REALLY COLD ON THE PART OF TAYLOR SWIFT. I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WENT ON BEHIND THE SCENES HERE. DID SHE ASK HER LAWYER, SANCTION THIS? WAS THIS LAWYER, MAYBE THERE'S A PROTOCOL IN THE TEAM OF SWIFT AND IT IS LIKE IF YOU SEE THE FOLLOWING THINGS THEN YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THEM AND HIT THEM WITH A CEASE AND DESIST. I JUST DO NOT UNDERSTAND. TAYLOR IS A PERSON. SHE IS NOT AN ENTITY. I KNOW WE SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE SHE IS BECAUSE SHE IS A HUGE POPSTAR BUT SHE IS A PERSON. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY, ENGAGE WITH THEM. WHEN BREITBART WAS RETREATING THE LYRICS TO LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY TAYLOR SWIFT DIDN'T REPLY AND SAY, HEY, I DON'T LIKE THIS. I DON'T SUPPORT YOU GUYS RETWEETING MY LYRICS. BUT SHE DOESN'T, THE PERSON WHO WROTE THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS OPINION WHO IS SUBSTANTIATED BY THINGS, TAYLOR SWIFT IS A PERSON, ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE INSERTING THEIR CRITICISM OF YOUR ART. BE A PERSON ABOUT IT. LIKE YOU SAID, THIS IS POP FRONT. WHATEVER THAT IS, IT'S NOT THE OUTLET TO DRAW THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN ALL RIGHTS PROPAGANDA AND TAYLOR SWIFT SONGS. OTHER MAJOR OUTLETS DID, I THINK BY STATE AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS. I'M THINKING THAT THE LAWYERS TARGETED THIS ONE BECAUSE IT MIGHT HAVE SEEN LIKE A MORE ATTAINABLE TARGET, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? A LITTLE GUY. A POWERFUL PERSON ATTACKING LITTLE GUY. IF IT WAS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, THEY WOULD NOT DARE. I THINK, THE ACTUAL TAKE ITSELF THAT THE BLOGGER HAD I FEEL IS PROBABLY LOOKING WAY TOO DEEP INTO SOMETHING. IT'S A BIT OF A REACH. TAYLOR SWIFT IS A FRIVOLOUS POPSTAR IN THE SONG IS A TOTALLY FRIVOLOUS SONG. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ ANYTHING DEEPER AND IT OTHER THAN THE TOP SURFACE LEVEL THING BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE SHOULD CONDONE A MORE POWERFUL PERSON FROM SILENCING A LESS POWERFUL PERSON JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE WITH THE PERSON SAID. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE A GROWING TREND IN AMERICA OF RICH PEOPLE BASICALLY SHUTTING DOWN JOURNALISM THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE. THERE WAS THE PETER THIEL SHUTDOWN OF GAWKER. THE WAR THE HE WAGED FOR YEARS AND ENDED UP WINNING. IT SET A HUGE PRECEDENT. I THINK THAT IS VERY CONCERNING FOR THOSE OF US THAT WORK IN THE MEDIA, AND WE ARE PAID TO SAY STUFF ABOUT PEOPLE AND SAY WE ATTACK SOMEONE FOR WHATEVER REASON AND IT WASN'T TAYLOR SWIFT, IT WAS ACTUALLY A MORE SINISTER PERSON OR WHATEVER AND THEN WE WERE APPROACHED WITH ONE OF THE CEASE AND DESIST LETTERS. OUR ABILITY TO FIGHT BACK IS MUCH MORE LIMITED THAN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTACK US. AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THERE IS A THROUGH LINE BETWEEN SEVERAL OF THE STORIES THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY, LIKE YOU BROUGHT UP, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DRAWING COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE WAY THAT DISNEY, WEINSTEIN, AND TAYLOR SWIFT'S LEGAL TEAMS HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH THE PRESS AS OF LATE.
