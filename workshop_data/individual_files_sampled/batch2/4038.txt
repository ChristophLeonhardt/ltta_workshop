thing one tonight ten months ago congressman Katherine Clark wanted to know if Trump's Education Department would block federal funding to a private school that openly discriminates based on race religion gender sexual orientation a question that education secretary Betsy DeVos really did not want to answer would you save Indiana that school cannot discriminate against LGBT students if you want to receive federal dollars or would you say the state has the flexibility in this situation I believe yes or no teen you to have flexibility incentive there's programs if I understand your testimony I want to make sure I get this right there is no situation of discrimination or exclusion that if a state approved it for its voucher program that you would step in and say that's not how we're going to use our federal dollars there's no situation if the state approved it that you would put the state flexibility over our students is that your testimony I think a hypothetical in this case it's not a hypothetical this is a real school applying for that respired okay so ten months later congressman Clark finally got an answer in that exchange which is satisfying is thing to in 60 seconds so the question on the table does the Secretary of Education support or oppose funding private schools that openly discriminate that's it right pretty simple question as you were looking at federal dollars under your program going to private schools will you put in protections of non-discrimination for all students whether on sexual orientation race religion or gender congresswoman as I've said before where federal dollars flow federal law must be adhered to will you guarantee as Secretary of Education that that money is included with non-discrimination policies for those private schools as I said federal dollars at yes dollars going to pro any program required what is your interpretation of federal law I think I've made this clean just say yes or no federal dollars going anywhere for education federal laws are adhered to so so you would not be able to send federal dollars to a private school that did not adhere to the full panoply of civil rights laws in this country federal law must be that a yellowed or no yes or no yes or no federal law must be followed when federal money is involved is there some problem yes or no would you guarantee I think I've been clear then beats say yes or no yes okay great thank you took a year hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
