1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
you have now is the founder editor in
chief and chief creative officer of

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,809
Playboy he's the subject of a new
documentary it opens July 30th wide

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,440
called Hugh Hefner playboy activist
rebel is this noir documentary or was it

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,800
some group producing it about you well
it's produced by a young lady named

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,340
Bridget Berman in Canada and she who
trade show career and follow you around

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,780
as well not really the I think that what
it she wanted Academy Awards some years

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,640
ago for a documentary on already Shaw
and that's how we originally met and

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,960
what she was interested in doing was the
part of my life that most people don't

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,160
know about are you happy with it more
than happy yes let's take a look at a

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,289
clip from the new documentary about
Hefner we published the last piece they

11
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,160
were written by Martin Luther King and
we publish it shortly after his death is

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,170
his widow actually edited there is no
gracious incongruity of it all of course

13
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,770
that we should be sitting there in the
heft pad listening to Martin Luther

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,290
King's dream
yes well people don't recognize or

15
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,650
realize the extent to which it was part
of my dream to how'd you first become

16
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,509
involved in this we call it
anti-segregation movement well I don't

17
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,340
know college right yes well in a small
way but I you know I was never really

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,649
part of a major a movement as such I
think there were a couple of occasions I

19
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,320
went University of Illinois and I feel a
couple of occasions where there were

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,750
some segregated restaurants and I was
there with the students protesting that

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,619
but you know it just comes from family I
think that you know bigotry comes from

22
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,869
family I was raised you know a very
consistent conservative Midwestern

23
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:14,069
Methodist family but there was no racism
and I think that you know my part in

24
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,550
terms of all of this really was related
to the fact that when I did the

25
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,560
television show it was a social setting
appeared to be a party in my apartment

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,950
sure and you know black and white
segments you know mixed as they did in

27
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,220
my home and back in 1959 1960 that was
unusual for network television and the

28
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,200
same thing when we opened the clubs Dick
Gregory was the first black performers a

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,480
period of in a club that wasn't a black
Club and when we when there were clubs

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,230
opened franchise clubs in in Miami and
New Orleans we expect there are black

31
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,819
members to be accepted there and when
they weren't we bought back the

32
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,690
franchises even though it cost us a
little a little money did you ever

33
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,409
understand why people would not like
people because there's something like

34
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:16,709
skin pigment well it's that crazy notion
of you know the birds of a feather flock

35
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,489
together the notion is somehow or other
that if the person is a little different

36
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,390
than somebody they're suspicious open
and you know it's one of the sad things

37
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,560
for me on this planet whether it's race
or religion or whatever it is we live on

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,280
one very small planet and we ought to
learn together learn to live together

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,610
now some say yes have you supported
blacks but you set back the woman's

40
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,680
movement well it takes a very curious
attitude towards Playboy to come up with

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,080
that conclusion in other words the
notion that our sexuality the fact that

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,879
we are attracted to the opposite sex
that there are two sexes on the planet

43
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,750
is a blessing and it's something I think
we ought to celebrate the fact that

44
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,870
there are hang-ups related to what I
think is reflective of the fact that we

45
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,980
are and still remain essentially a
Puritan people but you don't think that

46
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,620
playboy at all made women objects rather
than hi equals I think that women in the

47
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,120
best sense and not in a negative sense
our object of desire that is a

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,490
celebration of one's own sexuality and
the fact that we are two sexes and what

49
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,030
playboy tried to do quite frankly is
elevated to a to another kind of level

50
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,410
you know that did celebrate that and and
prior to playboy there were lots of

51
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,220
connections with sexuality in magazines
but they were connected to sin and

52
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,650
sensationalism playboy tried to give it
a little style and and I think you need

53
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,070
to talk quite frankly to the women who
posed for Playboy and see how they feel

54
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,760
about it
most of them continue to be friends over

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:57,720
more than half a century and they I get
wonderful cards that after the Christmas

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,910
and birthdays
they still want to pose right they still

57
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:07,669
want to pose was it tough to speak out
no no no never difficult no I think that

58
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,250
privileged to be in a position to be
able to speak out to be able to make

59
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,820
some difference I think of all the many
things that I'm grateful for in my life

60
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,960
is the fact that I've been able to make
some difference and in the process have

61
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,740
a lot of fun doing it and you use the
magazine frankly as a tool that has a

62
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,500
look at the Playboy forum yeah well to
begin with the magazine started in 1953

63
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,780
and it was really a lifestyle magazine
but in the early 60s the magazine was so

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,290
successful I knew I could do the other
half of what I'm really all about which

65
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,970
is you know the does the social justice
in there and it wasn't simply race it

66
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,540
had to do with with sexual prejudice and
had to do with drug prejudice

67
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:56,729
had to do with gays very much with
related to gays we did a a a piece that

68
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,960
had been turned down by Esquire called
the crooked man we published it in the

69
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,419
middle of 1950s and it was about a
future society in which normal was

70
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:11,990
homosexual and the aberrations worth's
was heterosexual it simply turned

71
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,860
anything over that was a very
controversial of the time and some in

72
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,820
some quarters considered homophobic at
the time and it was attempted to be

73
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,680
exactly the opposite I had the honor of
being a Playboy interviewee in the mid

74
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,300
90s how important was that interview do
you come up with that and it was Q&A in

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,490
the first issue no no when I talked
about that you know the other half of

76
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,279
what I was all about in other words that
part the Playboy philosophy

77
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,799
playboy interview and the nonfiction on
controversial subject began really in

78
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:52,059
the early 1960s and the first one we did
was conducted by Alex Haley who did a

79
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:57,999
whole bunch of them for us and it was
with Miles Davis and he didn't really

80
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,949
talk about jazz he talked about race and
that was the beginning of it and Alex

81
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:11,769
Haley did Martin Luther King for us and
and Malcolm X and there did the American

82
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:23,069
neo-nazi oh yeah not Norman quite a
difference you think we'll ever see a

83
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:28,809
day when it's not an issue
when we will be colorblind really

84
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:35,099
colorblind I can't answer that it
certainly won't happen in our lifetime

85
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,389
you know look at how separated we are by
religions I mean religion is supposed to

86
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,399
bring us together but religion becomes
one of the major sources of conflict on

87
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:52,809
the planet how crazy is that
you know the thing that concerns me

88
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:58,929
quite frankly is that we live on a
planet in which our technology and our

89
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:02,979
science has gotten to such a level in
which we can destroy the planet and

90
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:09,119
destroy one another and we have not yet
learned to live together crazy

91
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:12,509
technologies where at a human kind yes
absolutely

92
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,589
it boggles the mind yes
where's jewel superstitious savages in

93
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:22,929
the jungle on that level however there's
another side though we're still better

94
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:27,819
than most don't we yes country I
certainly think that you know if one

95
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,599
looks back over over the centuries we're
certainly making progress we're moving

96
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,578
in the right direction yeah hope for
mankind I feel like you've lived through

97
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:42,218
it all well we have certainly lived
through very interesting times yes I

98
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,670
think that the you know the 20th century
in the beginning of the 21st century is

99
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,620
a fascinating time were you against the
Vietnam War early yes yeah and and

100
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,920
central in the magazine
did you ever envision the success

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,769
playboy what best become no how could i
I started the magazine on 600 borrowed

102
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,949
dollars a total investment from friends
and relatives of $8,000 just enough to

103
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:11,660
start the first published the first
issue with no notion of what what lay

104
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,079
ahead what year was that 1953 was the
cover the Marilyn Monroe good choice

105
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,930
pose picture it was a pickup for the
first most of the first year was pickup

106
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,019
material you bought her from photography
photographer right was the first issue a

107
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,860
success
yes hugely successful or I wouldn't be

108
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,029
around for the second issue but the
second issue didn't have Marilyn and

109
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,690
sold more than the first there was what
caught the attention of the people there

110
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,649
was it was it was the Monroe nude in
that first issue that got the initial

111
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,790
attention but what made the magazine
successful was the message it was a

112
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,079
lifestyle magazine for single guys and
back in the 1950s that was a revolution

113
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,589
was there a centerfold in the first
issue yes well what was a single page

114
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,740
yeah then it was a centerfold in the
second issue single page yeah we didn't

115
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,670
get we didn't get to the old out yeah we
didn't get that till about the second or

116
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:12,170
third year magazine in the season
trouble oh and that now the world has

117
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,240
changed yes you're big arrived the
internet right yes can you make money

118
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,560
off the internet is anybody well I guess
no I don't think we're making anything

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,170
significant out of it yet but at the
same time you know it's a very nice way

120
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,490
to interconnect with your audience I
mean you get a playback immediately I I

121
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:41,449
became I got a gift from my girlfriend
Crystal Harris they gave me an iPad from

122
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:47,690
whether you like it I like it very much
and I'm now a Twitter bug I was when I

123
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,130
was a kid I was a jitterbug and I'm a
Twitter bug I'm speaking of girlfriends

124
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,850
how how many of you had how many
girlfriends you counted up the number I

125
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:04,500
haven't been counting how many do you
have now just one

126
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:13,360
we are settling down laughs no more the
threesomes huh no no I found a very nice

127
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,850
lady you just celebrated your 84 84th
birthday trying to buy back the magazine

128
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,610
do you ever think of just as that Elise
Stevenson once said go out on the beach

129
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:29,889
and eat some strawberries and watch the
dances I think that that you know if you

130
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:35,500
stop doing what you love I think it is
the first step towards the grave I think

131
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,459
that it is the combination of the
workingplayer that keeps you alive keeps

132
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,329
your Bible keeps you connected yeah
health deteriorates if you're

133
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,949
permanently I think so what do you want
your legacy to be do you wanna go you

134
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:53,500
have no business man civil rights
activists philanthropist somebody who

135
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,329
played some positive part in the
changing social sexual values of my time

136
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,250
and I think I'm pretty secure in that do
you still read every page of every issue

137
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,250
no no the man that used to the very
beginning but the magazine the major

138
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,899
headquarters are in Chicago what I still
do is pick the covers pick the playmates

139
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,839
pick the pictorials oversee the total
package and see that it's together and

140
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,350
making sense
continue to get healthy thank you you're
