so sinclair broadcasting is an enormous television and media empire they have stations at 72% of the United States which is gigantic previous rules used to prohibit that but now we let monopolies run wild throughout the country and now their thing you're buying Tribune which would make them even larger they happen to be very conservative and their owners are Trump supporters and so they force the local TV stations to do propaganda from our conservative perspective and they put it into the so-called news of those stations now you probably have no idea if you have a Sinclair station in your market because they it might be a complete you don't know it is Sinclair it could be an affiliate for NBC ABC CBS or whatever other station it's not necessarily labeled Sinclair and so they and they tell their anchors and they didn't and this newly discovered memo by CNN appeared to be neutral don't even wear red or blue or purple ties or outfits because you want to have to give the appearance of neutral journalism not the reality of it but the appearance of it okay so the new memo the CNN found because the local anchors gave it to them is titled an anchor delivered journalistic responsibility message and how is that for or well in no no this is not talking points about conservative point of view that you should do propaganda on it it is anchored delivered journalistic responsibility message okay interesting as brian Stelter explains that CNN as scripted the promos decry fake stories from national news outlets echoing president Trump's Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about fake news it turns out there the memo happens to support Donald Trump just like the owners of Sinclair what a wonderful coincidence so instructions to the local station said this please produce the attached scripts exactly as they are written this copy has been thorough tested SP saw our journalistic responsibility as advocates to seek the truth on behalf of the audience how is that for our welly and political correctness you must not vary from the politically correct script that we give you it is on the behalf of the truth and journalistic responsibility that we tell you to read this partisan message oh okay thank you appreciate it the promos begin with one or two anchors introducing themselves and saying I'm or we are extremely proud of the quality balanced journalism that I love this proper news brand name of local station produces but I'm or we are concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible one side of news stories plaguing our country look that also goes to a a general point that I make outside of the context of the story which is that a lot of these anchors god bless them are not news anchors they're news actors they just read the scripts anyway the producers write the scripts and the anchors read them in a funny anchor voice today long five there's a fire raging by the way Donald Trump is awesome if they work in st. Claire right so but look some of the anchors there we're journalists enough to be outraged by this and make sure that the word gets out on it so bless their hearts on that so they tell them to read this script and don't veer away from the script and pretend as if it's you like I Bob Johnson working in you know make up a station wer T here are in Missouri think that this is a great idea okay I get it so as Stelter then explains then the medium a she bashing begins the sharing of bias and false news has become all too common on social media the script says continuing to quote the script more alarming national media outlets are publishing these same fake stories without checking facts first unfortunately some members of the national media are using their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think is extremely dangerous to our democracy so now the national media they're referring to of course CNN and MSNBC or Times Washington Post the people that Donald Trump calls fake news so and they do it under the guise of caring about the fact that they are saying those outlets are trying to control what they think people think as they're doing a memo about how you should control what people think unbelievable all right so they have been doing this for quite some time now this is not the first time that Sinclair has been in the news for pushing Trump and conservative propaganda and so Stelter gives you background on that most noticeably pro-trump commentaries by former Trump aide Boris Epstein have come in to local news time and Epstein by the ways guy famously as the campaign was winding down and they thought they were gonna lose they were doing what they thought was going to be Trump TV afterwards and he's the one that said see if I got it yep they took Sir abs and put them on TV pretending that he's neutral preposterous local journalists have also bristled at the so-called must run package about subjects that aren't relevant to local audiences but that our hot-button stories for conservatives the terrorism alert desk is a regular segment about security threats around the world so one piece of propaganda after now not as ads but as part of the local news the promos are supposed to start airing these new promos are supposed to start airing on local stations later this month the instructions sent to station news directors say that the 60 and 75 second spots should run frequently to create maximum reach and frequency as george w bush used to say you gotta kind of catapult the propaganda for it to work instructions to local stations say that the promos should play using news time not commercial time like the epstein commentaries this takes away from local news time okay for those of you who didn't say that was just an amusing episode where Epstein was just yelling that through the office and and getting people psyched about Trump TV well we didn't get Trump TV instead what we've got was Sinclair broadcasting so well how do the local anchors feel about it here are some quotes at my station everyone was uncomfortable doing it that's an anonymous anchor to Sinclair own TV station here's another quote this is so manipulative and then one more here a different anchor said I felt like a pow2 cording a message so that's what's going on at Sinclair while they're pretending to be neutral they're basically making their anchors to hostage videos supporting Donald Trump if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
