pleasure of visiting a World Cup legend it not only built an academy from scratch but also a team that went from nothing to Romanian champions within eight years an incredible story I visited Romanian World Cup legend one of my heroes Georgie aji in his hometown of Constanza to see how he did it absolute miracle ball good scale he gave them the chance to dream big yes - Georgie tell us about the Academy I've heard a lot about it it's a world-class facility why did you decide to to want to start an academy you could have gone and carried on coaching or become an ambassador or a million things why did you want to have an academy first of all it was my mind told to give to the kids big opportunity to became became his dream what's the philosophy behind the Academy the strategy is simple try to be the best and the philosophy starts with personality the personality and then technical but of our football it's possession and pressure when you want to became bigger you need to have personality take decision play in front not back look in front have courage and with personality we start in 2009 and in eight years we became the best in Romania first of all you have to put in the Academy this concept to invest to the young in the future normal if the youngest champion becaming the senior also became champions and after eight years last year the the our senior allow our team became champion also feel like to be champions of Romania with your club the winter time we are first I put in the mind of the player you can win it can be the best and try to we do this with the talents with good football and what I said in Romania like we did a miracle some serious clubs that you're competing against very good compete but we are our target is to promote the players to give the players to build the players it's not to compete with them to beat them we operate we operate in it because we have a good good talent okay all the time I said to the kids in our team first things we have sure is talent and then if you have also personality you can win in this moment we we have 35 players a hundred players for national teams we have a 35 so one third of the whole version is one in three players comes from your Academy yeah that must make you very very rich we have three six five players that was make you very proud each day I think to build the I hope Romania will the other next generation better than us this is the bigger target for me and our Academy we have 200 kids start to server till 18 years old 7 to 12 we select around Constanza the city 13 to 18 we select the Romania look at this Academy a Hajji so here we are the fruits of your work yeah visceral means future future future the future invested a young neither will the future now let's get to get our kids on it let's do I want Georgie had you to pass the ball to him for me to score a goal please we became champion circle GBP under-17 under-19 champions and the 13 champions and the 15 champions under 11 champions that neither the good the good job we did fantastic where's the boss how does this sit in Romanian football is this a surprise is this is this a miracle how do you write about this story of visceral it's an absolute miracle it's the biggest miracle I've seen in the past 20 years maybe in past 30 years in Romanian football to create a club from scratch there were sheep here before this Academy was built Haji took everything from ground zero from scratch he built this he built a lot of pitches he gave the kids in this region and in the entire country the chance to plane in a professional environment and most of all it wasn't just this he gave them the chance to dream big first touch first touch his baton he start the world the project seven years ago he believed in what he did and after seven years he won the championship with with the team we do it basically with with kids he's the legend hey high five is an inspiration for these kids and I think he should be an inspiration for the entire world of Romanian football because he's doing the right thing and I think that he's the only one who understands who fully understands the mission he should have so your kids when I play story Bucharest big Club famous club do you look at them and say put inside 99 97 98 so explain I'd say knowing senior players 17 18 19 play 19 so you have to impose good our PCB you have to be you confidence and go and be like you you might you make this game sound very very easy just like way and for the young you have to support we'd have to give configure the the kids the young need to head back to him somebody could take this risk this pressure give confidence I believe in you you go and play I'm open HR McKee liberal when I channel pistache each others in England we have that problem good kids good technically nobody says I believe in you which is a shame I told you my opinion yes each Academy in each place you need to do target to promote one player minimum each year to the first team if you know what to have Academy what is the reason do you think that George energy will at some stage either be the national team manager or head of the Football Association because whether or not is being embraced at the moment by the Romanian Football Federation they can't ignore this no it's kind of impossible to ignore what he did here an entire man from his own money risking everything and putting it to the youth and promoting youth and making Romania look better abroad playing Champions League football for the Football Academy which is but she has to show signal of intent and I would say that it would be impossible to refuse his help either as a football manager for the Romanian national team or as a very important decision maker in the Football Association he always you know said that the the the philosophy of masala is the best he found in the football and that's why he tried to improve the Barcelona Stein know she worked he started working suddenly one hour before and he did the same everyday she believed in the system 14% of the players in national teams now young optional teams are coming from his academy that's quite incredible 40% 4-0 yeah from the all the players for the main national teams that can be from his are getting what do you think about your your statistics he happened 94 passing 94 dribbling 43 for defense football king of romania georgie ha ji-won the king for assimilation darling the definition of Champions from one Romanian legend to another after the break we'll visit Dan Petrescu to discuss these World Cups in 94-98 his memories and managerial career don't go anywhere a very warm welcome back to the Stan Collymore show we're going to stay in Romania if we may we traveled from Constanza in the seclusion the north to visit Dan Petrescu a former teammate of mine at Bradford City in the Premier League to discuss his 1994 and 98 World Cup memories we were teammates for a very short period of time at Bradford of all places but we want to talk to you about your World Cup experiences a true World Cup legend and let's go back to 1990 you were injured for that squad so how disappointing was it to miss the 1990 World Cup in Italy yeah I was really disappointed I was getting injured just before the World Cup I had my debut in just before the World Cup in ideaa against Italy and I was looking forward to playing that World Cup especially I play in the last official game against Denmark where we beat than 5-2 and I was very very happy to play in the World Cup but just one month before the World Cup I get an injury and in my opinion I was fit enough to play but the coach didn't risk to take me in the in the squad it's the first World Cup in the United States yes what did you feel because obviously the previous World Cup in 1990 was in Italy a football country a country that you know well I've been played in it was the general feeling amongst the Romanian players about playing in the United States you know in a sport that was then perhaps the fourth or fifth most popular not even the most popular sport in the country correct first of all I was very happy to go to the United States for me as a Romanian I was something new I never been there and I was excited to go there to see what's going to happen and I was really surprised every training we made a lot of people come to our trainings and I see a lot of girls playing football it's unbelievable how many girls so that was the first time you saw the kind of like the explosion of women's soccer in in the United States I didn't expect that I didn't expect they like football I thought they liked only American football and basketball and baseball I never believed they'd all come so many people in my first official match in LA was like 100,000 people in the Rose Bowl yes I could not believe I swear and I thought Romania against Colombia I thought nobody maybe only Colombian is some Romanian when I see 100,000 people there is going to be serious here unbelievable very nice for me was the best ever World Cup how did he fail scoring the winning goal against the house nation was a very important match for us we just lost one game against Switzerland for one and was our target was to qualify to win that game and four same for United States but if I remember well even if we won 1-0 I think when I tested it still qualified because to the teams will go through plus one third who is the best for me was a fantastic feeling because was my first ball every in the World Cup and in that action I was looking in the box there was no one player from our team that and their goalkeeper made a mistake to go out and I I should and I scored a very important goal I was a dream for me to play the Cup final in that year we thought that we can go all the way we are so good and they're so confident that after beating Argentina we are confident again go away voided so many good players end up in in that team in 1994 won all the players playing good teams real madrid barcelona chelsea by Leverkusen the players they play in big clubs I think in that time we were also lucky that not only in the pitch outside of the pitch you are good friends we are making a good family together it gets to penalties against the Swedish national team to essentially go on to the very very latter stages of the tournament you missed a penalty a goalscoring fall back you mister penalty how did you feel and in 2017 do you ever think about that still yes why I don't know because he's the biggest regret in my life we don't play in the semi-final against Brazil not only me all my friends all my ex players together we thought that was the biggest regret for that generation and I thought that we should have finished the game before the penalties was to 1 for us 11 against them and we didn't know what to do with the world 1998 in France Romania again lots of senior players that already had a very good experience at the 1994 World Cup closer to home on European soil we confident of perhaps going a step or two further yeah we wanted to do better than 94 the problem start with the Romanian press 94 the press was very good 2000 then before the 98 was the only negatives stories that's why we make our hair blond so what was the story behind that because for people that aren't big football fans every single player the remaining national team walked out and 1990 I woke up with blonde hair why yeah we try to do something because the press in Romania kill us they sing all the time we are not a family we are not together we have too many problems we are not playing good all negatives and then we didn't know what to do then we decide let's show everywhere every with buddy not one in Romania in the world that we are a team together maybe I was not the best idea but we try to do it like this and in that game I think we drove and after the game are still the press still kill us and this and Hadj after the game said to them listen you'll cry after us you will see in 20-30 years you will say we need a generation ladies you're a fantastic career England with Chelsea winning trophies what did it feel like to play against guys I mean Gramlich so you you famously went past when you when you scored to play almost like a personal derby game for you was there any extra motivation there first of all was very difficult to play against Glenn Hoddle he bring me to Chelsea he was the one who believed in me that I'm the best right back winger in the world he gave me all the confidence and was relieved for me very strange to play against him I didn't want to play him I did a lot to win against the reco poverty before the game inside pay easy honest guy pal no he came off to the game in the bus and say congratulations really even now I remember even the players say how is possible because no one in Romania will do this especially you scored the goal against him he come in the bus and congratulate me I was I I say sorry sorry what I have to sorry yes I did by Jove I was one against one with less so I just protect the ball and then I scored for the legs of C but even for me was big surprise that in the last minute I was going that even the coach told me after the watch what are you doing then after winning scoring that was unbelievable feeling we knew that we play Croatia very good and we should be in top but we didn't play so good and then again penalties was crucial for us and I was sorry to leave the World Cup like this because we wanted to go further I thought that that generation could go all the way to the final rifle but you know in football sometimes small things change the difference between me somebody and nobody so small then that difference didn't come to our generation but I still think that will be very hard for somebody in Romania to achieve three World Cups and to arrive with their birthday final great to see you thank you for doing this down thank you a month ago in Moscow Liverpool and Manchester United played Champions League games against CSKA and Spartak Moscow and now the fixtures are reversed Spartak unfortunately didn't make it to the last 16 but our own
