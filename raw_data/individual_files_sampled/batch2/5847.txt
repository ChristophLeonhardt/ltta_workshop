she says he served four tours with the US Marines in Iraq and it was among the first Americans to reach Baghdad in 2003 recently he's been campaigning in Pennsylvania with another Marine veteran Connor lamb and Kathy K I suspect that he despite supporting Connor Lam somehow would be seen as loving his country and his God you might think so right Joe you've often spoken about this in congressman I wanted to ask you this question to what extent is this that Connor Lam is a good candidate for this district Joe's often spoken about how the Democrats have a tendency to put up candidates for their districts that aren't suited to those districts Connor Lam seems to be a really good choice for this district but I'm also interested in something else he's made a point during the campaign of not campaigning on Trump anger not using anger at Trump is his kind of modus operandi perhaps something that some Democrats on the Left might have advised him to actually do go hard on Trump go that route but he hasn't done that and I'm wondering how much you think that is part of why he's doing so well in the district I think it's a huge part I think that Connor Lam stands for things not just against things and he is a great candidate because he represents the people of this district he's clearly respected by them there he's also just a good guy I mean that's one of the things that really comes out when you spend time with him and given the number of doors that he's knocked I think a lot of people have come to meet him and said this is a man that I respect this is someone that I would trust with my kids futures this is someone that I want representing my interests in Washington but why did he make that choice not to go after Trump harder do you feel it would be counterproductive in Virginia we saw in a way Northam doing the same sort of thing he didn't mention Trump the whole time but you are hearing from the left of the Democratic Party that they feel they can run on Trump angry on in opposition to Trump because I think it's time for the Democratic Party to stand for something not just against something and I think that what Connor is hearing from the people in this district is that a lot of people are hurting a lot of people were so frustrated that they may have been Democrats their entire lives but they voted for Trump just because they wanted some sort of change well Connor is going to bring real change to Washington but he's going do it by standing for things by talking about what the Democratic Party can do for the country not just talking about how terrible Trump is a congressman it's Sam Stein here I'm curious what are those things he's for what is the actual proactive Democratic agenda that people should be running and I will note one thing not everyone has been able to go into that district to campaign with Connolly you're among a few people in the Democratic Party who stepped foot in there he's obviously been conned that is has been opposed to Nancy Pelosi as a future speaker so can you talk a little bit about both what the Democratic Party stands for in terms of specifics and whether there is any tensions within the party over how this has played out absolutely so we are on the ground one of the things I heard Connor talk about all the time is the opioid crisis and how it's affecting every part of this country and how we're not doing anything about it in Washington we talked about it a lot we're not funding any solutions a Connor represents a new generation of leadership that's gonna come to actually fix that problem to help people get help that's the first thing he talks a lot about infrastructure about how the trumps plan is is you know it's a lot of talk well but it hasn't done anything and I think the Democrats need to have a future focused plan that really talks about how we can build an infrastructure that will allow America to compete in the future for the new generation of jobs and that's part of what Connor stands for he's also talking about how we have to preserve Social Security and Medicare you know the Republican Congress wants to cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for their massive tax cut for the rich Conner Lam is there to preserve them for today's generation of seniors and for our generation we want Social Security and Medicare to be there for us as well so these are the kinds of things that Connor is standing for rather than just going around and complaining about Trump or the Republicans over the weekend Hillary Clinton created a little bit of a stir when she said she won all of the forward-looking optimistic sections of the country and that and then sort of suggested that people were not voting for her or backward-looking and and if you go back into the quote even sort of suggested there's a dimension of racism to it does that help the party when you're trying to win these swing districts where there's a lot of people who are uncertain about the direction the country no and in fact look I think of my job is helping the people who need help I mean my job is to be a representative for my district in Massachusetts but but not just for the people who are doing well I mean the people who come into my office every day who need help because they're not getting their veterans benefits or they're not getting their Social Security or they feel like they've just been left behind mitogen rapid economic change sweeping the country they're not the people who were already happy and optimistic they're the people who need folks in Washington to actually change things to actually get things done to make this a better country to make it better than it's ever been and that's what we're we should be expected to do in Washington all right Congressman Seth Moulton thank you so much really do appreciate it and thanks for bringing our show as always and and you know those Hillary Clinton comments say everything that I said about Rick Ciccone you could apply to what Hillary Clinton said in that speech suggesting that people that didn't vote for her somehow were backward-looking people that didn't vote for her there was a suggestion that they were racially insensitive that they didn't want this country moving forward no people that didn't vote for her in large part didn't get her message you know Mika was saying it from day one Hillary Clinton had no message that reached out to middle America regardless of their race regardless of whether they were looking forward or backward and said this is how I'm going to change things I mean the entire Democratic Party establishment was was trying to get her to move in a direction that was that was more forceful move in a direction that was more inclusive of all Americans and she didn't do it and they didn't do it how ironic that Hillary Clinton is now saying that when I was critical of a lot of people on cable news back in 2008 that would say if Kentucky went for Hillary Clinton or West Virginia went for Hillary Clinton those states were immediately accused of of being racist and so now it's Hillary Clinton that seems to be and I will say seems to be suggesting the same thing not the way to win friends and influence others still ad on Morning Joe we've got this coming so I'm reading peg and she's a nice woman I like her she doesn't like me much but and she's
