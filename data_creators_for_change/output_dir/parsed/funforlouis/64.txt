right we have just sat down for our
first Moroccan meal this is Moroccan

explore a local market they're going to
a souk
I'm really tired and need to relax so
I've managed to sneak into a Hilton
Hotel and come up to the swimming pool
floor where there's a hot tub I think
I'm gonna jump in the hot tub for a
little bit and yeah just see my muscles
thinking Hadleys gonna join me who's
that he's on his way we have come up to
the restaurant got some lunch
vegetable tagine overlooking a pretty
amazing view of Tunisia
how you feelin and they did you know
refreshed yeah it's a relaxing day yeah
it hasn't been a day of sightseeing it's
been a day of recovering for me we just
touch the bikes way here really cheekily
as we came in and there nicely put a big
cordon around them just to keep them
safe thank you for looking after the
bikes thank you head back to the report
everyone else right over there
yeah this is it then they're gonna go on
the van and then we just gonna chill
this is our last now probably have to
say it will probably have to cycling
from the ferry to the van yet they'll be
our last little cycle
heading back from ferry or at passport
control it's been a lovely afternoon the
Sun is out it's gonna be a nice ride
back
the wheel went down Oh came my train
came off a night night look at it
the chain yeah
this is it this is exactly how I fit in
right now
in Spain I think that's the shortest
trip to Africa I've ever done
ah I think and they had the right idea
on the ferry he's having a nap I am
really struggling to keep my eyes open
I think after weeks of just relentless
all-day exercise when you stop like this
suddenly I think my body's just freaking
out and it's just and it's a weird
sleeping mode I'm hoping I'm hoping that
after yeah I'm hoping that after a bit
of a rest I feel all right it might take
a week might take a week or so to
recover I still can't believe we've done
it
alright hey you should have done the
hallway like that hey guys this is the
last time this is the last time I'm
gonna be on this point bike for well
maybe when I get back to the UK but
we're loading them up and for the we're
loading them up onto the mini bus now

I really like this bike but I'm happy to
know not be on this bike now for a
little while chris has been an amazing
part of the trip

reckon he'll be good no miss your sister
like us think about it nothing every
every single person has been absolutely
amazing whether you've been riding
you've written like 500 miles of
thousand miles 1,400 miles
where have you been in the van whether
you've been cooking food for us every
day
we've been driving common stuff where
we've been like just cheering people on
and I think everyone has been a mess
I feel so I feel like a change averse
but I feel like this experience
and I want to thank you
together we've raised loads of money
which is gonna change people's lives
we've been changed by this trip I think
man we should all be really proud of
ourselves it's been an adventure and
it's been it's been great having the
thunderstorms the lightning that
when the hot Road I think it's in part
like life in it let's go its challenges
