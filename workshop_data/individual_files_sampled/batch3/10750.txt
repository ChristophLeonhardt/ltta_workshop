self-styled Amato German a journalist in the UK is claiming that police are not doing enough over the death threats she's received for her controversial comments a Jennifer NASA English even claims she's felt threatened by officers themselves over her opinions on sensitive subjects particularly Islam now the first time I reported these stress nothing happened and the second time I reported these death threats I was no more successful than the first I said the second time was actually worse because I spoke directly to a superintendent who straight-up refused to do anything because she said and she used this phrase inciting racial hatred and she essentially threatened me in the very first message and said what do you want us to be because you're committing an offense also well this is an email allegedly received by Jan aya from Greater Manchester Police in issues one of consequences resulting from comments she's made online Jenai I was also told to consider the freedom of expression of others and without any details of those said to her harassing her there'd been no investigation in the end she was advised not to post anything likely to cause offence we asked our Greater Manchester Police to comment it said an investigation is under review and hopes to contact janea shortly also we put the issuer of whether Internet users have become too sensitive to debate certain topics or here it is well actually I know Jan aya personally and I see are asked questions sometimes they're uncomfortable questions sometimes they're questions people don't particularly want to answer I don't I'm an atheist like criticise Christianity a critized Judaism I criticize Islam I criticize any faith but it's only when it's almost criticized that suddenly it's hate speech we have rules about freedom of expression freedom of belief and freedom of conscience however there are limits to those rules it's very dangerous to draw some kind of moral equivalence between people who are fascists or neo-nazis and our spreading and inciting violence or hate preaching when people behave like that they should be prosecuted to the maximum extent of the law so everybody has to suffer the consequences freedom of speech means that yes sometimes somebody might say something that could offend you she has a right to an opinion nobody and I mean nobody has the right to put a death ray on anybody for any reason because unaffected because they were offended by an opinion free do you agree if somebody's speech tone you bear with me if you agree that do you agree that if somebody's speech crosses the line into hatred inciting hatred or harassment or is racist do or sexist or anti-semitic do you agree that these people should be do you agree that these people should be prosecuted to the absolute maximum extent of the law and it's against British and English values I believe in free speech including yours even though I don't agree with your opinion do I think you cross the line yes I do do I think you should be prosecuted because of your opinion no I don't those threats are never acceptable never excused or and our far worse than any mean words because words don't kill actions do and DEF phrase can be carried out
