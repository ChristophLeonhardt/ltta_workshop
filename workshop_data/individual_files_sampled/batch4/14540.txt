so was it good for you you know the Winter Olympic Games or something I like to call white privilege in spandex we all know who won the gold the silver and the bronze medals but here are my six picks for the Winter Olympic dubious Achievement Awards oh sure we'd like to honor the fastest the strongest etc.etc with shiny medals but surely those who screwed up at the games deserve a little recognition too so without further ado I tip my hat to the following half-dozen also-rans for example the league of their own award for unnecessary weeping goes to the Canadian women's hockey team okay girls we get it it was heartbreaking to lose to your arch rivals the Americans especially in that garbage shootout but standing at center ice after the game weeping come on didn't we learn anything from Tom Hanks back in 1992 by the way since only two nations in the entire world have a shot at winning gold and women's hockey until the rest of the world catches up can we just make the women's Olympic ice hockey tournament a best out of seven playoff series between the Americans and the Canadians because watching these two juggernaut teams play any other nation brings forth tears as well tears of boredom that is now the Janet Jackson award for best wardrobe malfunction goes to French figure skater Gabriela Papadakis for going semi topless during her ice dance routine I'm sorry but a sport has not a real sport unless it is decided by a clock or total points scored when a discipline like figure skating is decided by judges then there's no objectivity in fact it's all subjective so it is that people like yours truly only get interested in figure skating when there's some sort of a circus sideshow going on 24 years ago we the Tonya Harding Nancy Kerrigan scandal but if 1994 served up violence well this year we got sex when Gabriella's left breasts popped out during her routine to the tune of Ed Sheeran's hit shape of you know I'm not making that up hey I don't know anything about figure skating folks but I know what I like they're real and they're spectacular the Tom Brady deflategate award goes to the Russians or the Olympic athletes from Russia as they were officially known as this year not being able to compete under their own flag was punishment for being caught cheating too often and you know what we learned about the Russians folks it's this when they aren't gulping down steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs there well there's just not that good actually they're pretty crappy as evidenced by their 13th place finish the worst showing at a Winter Olympics in Russian Soviet history everything special about using the damn you all the hell award goes to the IOC puck heads who at one point suggested that two goalies on Team USA whose mass featured the Statue of Liberty would have to cover up that artwork because Lady Liberty was deemed to be a political symbol the grand theft auto award goes to Canadian ski cross racer Dave Duncan for getting hammered and then stealing a Hummer what the hell was he thinking I mean if you're gonna steal any vehicle at the Winter Olympics it's got to be a bobsled who doesn't dream of going for a bobsled ride Karsh Mars bobsleds are the stuff a bucket list and they were right there bobsleds galore that oh so rarefied toboggan indeed for non Olympians who want to go downhill fast we've been reduced to putting teflon on aluminum saucers kind of like Clark Griswold in National Lampoon's Christmas vacation and we all know how well that worked out and finally the sergeant Schultz memorial dummkopf award goes to Willy Desjardins the coach of the Canadian men's hockey team who seemed to think he was coaching the Thornhill selects as opposed to Canada's national hockey team getting behind early to the Germans Willy couldn't be bothered to shake things up he never changed the lines he didn't try a new strategy to counter the Germans style of trap hockey Willy didn't even shorten his bench in the dying minutes presumably not to hurt the feelings of ineffectual players on the third and fourth lines you know that sort of approach would be jolly good if Willy was a house league coach but he was the coach for the Olympic team in a single game knockout tournament and his approach was toxic and please spare me any crap that losing to Germany just shows how the rest of the world is catching up to the traditional powerhouse Hockey Nations Canada losing to Germany in hockey is like Germany losing to Canada in soccer unthinkable and inexcusable and proof that Willy Desjardin is a gold medal klutz for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks have you heard the news the rebel has a brand new app please download it and take the rebel wherever you go you
