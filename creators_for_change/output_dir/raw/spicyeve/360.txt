11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,590
cream no oil no conditioner no

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,149
detangling nothing naked hair dripping

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,350
wet you know the whole business I'm one

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,879
of those people who washes their here

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,410
whatever they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,710
schedule um whenever my hair feels dirty

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,250
and I have enough time to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,760
wash<font color="#CCCCCC"> it condition it and detangle then I</font>

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,099
will I'll you shampoo for people like me

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,010
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you shampoo pretty frequently it's</font>

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,340
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find products that um don't</font>

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,520
strip your hair of its natural oils now

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,210
your scalp makes its own oil the body

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,630
makes its own oil um it's called sebum

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,430
when this builds up it can get gross but

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,740
depending on the texture of your hair

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,619
and how much your hair curls you won't

28
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,650
necessarily feel it that is why people

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,990
with a bone straight hair can't get away

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">with not washing their hair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every day</font>

31
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,340
because the oil<font color="#E5E5E5"> can travel down that</font>

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,250
straight strand of hair in Turkey you

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,070
can see the coil on their hair not cute

34
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,460
but for people like me whose hair is so

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,390
curly that at you know first glance you

36
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,000
can't even see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the curl like it just</font>

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,770
looks like mass of hair the oil<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

38
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,780
defy gravity and travel down the spiral

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,929
you know so my hair doesn't get oily as

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,540
fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is that oil from</font>

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,050
my sky

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,980
never reaches my actual hair because my

43
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,210
curls are so small in diameter I'll have

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,280
an oily scalp that needs to be washed

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
but dry hair to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remedy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this you use a</font>

46
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,080
shampoo that does not have sulfates so

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,300
it doesn't strip your hair of any oil

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,710
that it did have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chance to receive</font>

49
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,630
but you need a shampoo that also cleans

50
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,790
your scalp of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the product build-up</font>

51
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,120
of all your natural oils let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off</font>

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,410
the shampoo that you wouldn't use suave

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,540
and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking well Evelyn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

54
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,640
wouldn't use it why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it it's</font>

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I am foolish if it's any</font>

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,660
consolation I haven't used it at all I

57
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,320
think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used it once and I've had it for</font>

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,570
a while I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give it to somebody</font>

59
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's a waste and I'm ashamed</font>

60
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does leave your hair squeaky clean um</font>

61
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,800
and when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeaky clean I literally</font>

62
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,000
do mean I mean I mean it that's the

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,760
sound that my hair makes if I use

64
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,540
something like that um in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my hair feels</font>

65
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,830
dry it feels like hey like straw you

66
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,410
know um it's it's it's not a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,440
this makes my naked hair feel horrible

68
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,660
what I did use during my transition

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,160
which is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,010
ingredients but not that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> better in</font>

71
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,140
terms of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it made my naked hair field</font>

72

is kinky curly come clean natural

73

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did you</font>

87
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,700

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,160
transition and I had it washed my hair

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,230
