00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:22,546

OF MERRICK GARLAND THE

12
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,085
LEGITIMACY OF THE SUPREME

13
00:00:28,086 --> 00:00:29,653
COURT CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE

14
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,053
QUESTIONED.

15
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,588
THE COURT MUST NOW PROVE,

16
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,856
THROUGH ITS WORKS, THAT IT

17
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:34,024
IS BOTH OF THE NATION'S

18
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:34,358

JOINING US NOW IS CHIEF

20
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:37,161
COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR

21
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,262
AT THE JUDICIAL CRISIS

22
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,930
NETWORK AND FORMER LAW CLERK

23
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,733
TO JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS

24
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:43,467
CARRIE SEVERINO.

25
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:44,368
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

26
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,503
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

27
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,337
AINSLEY: WHAT DID YOU THINK

28
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,472
OF ERIC HOLDER'S TWEET.

29
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:50,607
>> THAT HAS BEEN THEIR

30
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:51,508
STRATEGY.

31
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,442
THEY WANTED IT DENY

32
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:53,377
CONFIRMATION IF THEY COULD.

33
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:56,547
DELAY IT IF THEY COULDN'T

34
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:57,714
DELEGITIMIZE IT.

35
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,816
HOPING TO FIND SOME WAY TO

36
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,886
PUSH BACK AGAINST WHO IS NOW

37
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:03,921
A CONSTITUTIONALIST

38
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:04,288
MAJORITY.

39
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,123
SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

40
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:06,957
GIVE THEM EVERY DECISION

41
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,524
THEY WANT.

42
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,926
THEY WILL TRY TO UNDERCUT

43
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:10,260
THE LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT.

44
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,429
I THINK IT'S IRONIC WHEN YOU

45
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,363
HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE

46
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,999
COMPLAINING OH THIS IS GOING

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,800
TO DELEGITIMIZE THE COURT.

48
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,168
THEY ARE DOING IT BY THEIR

49
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:18,835
OWN RHETORIC.

50
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:20,470
THEY KNOW THIS IS A FAIR AND

51
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,239
LEGITIMATE CONFIRMATION

52
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,573
PROCESS.

53
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:23,674
AS FAIR AS IT COULD BE UNDER

54
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:24,541
THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

55
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,309
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE

56
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,276
DOING WAS VERY UNFAIR.

57
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:28,212
I SAW FROM MY OWN BOSS, I

58
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,746
WORKED FOR JUSTICE THOMAS,

59
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,981
YOU KNOW, HE HAD OBVIOUSLY A

60
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:31,715
BRUISING CONFIRMATION

61
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,382
PROCESS AS WELL.

62
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,418
HE HAS SERVED 27 YEARS NOW

63
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:35,085
WITH DISTINCTION.

64
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:36,119
SO MANY PEOPLE RECOGNIZED

65
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,788
HIM AS ONE OF THE MOST

66
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,422
PRINCIPLED MEMBERS OF THE

67
00:01:38,423 --> 00:01:38,755
COURT.

68
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,357
HE GETS ALONG GREAT WITH HIS

69
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:40,757
COLLEAGUES.

70
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,593
SO, YOU KNOW, THEIR WISHFUL

71
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,528
THINKING THAT SOMEHOW

72
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,662
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WILL HAVE

73
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:50,867
AN ASTERISK I THINK IS JUST

74
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:51,401
THAT.

75
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:51,935
AINSLEY: WITH YOUR

76
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,203
EXPERIENCE WHAT DID YOU

77
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:53,904
THINK JUDGE KAVANAUGH MAKING

78
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,506
GOOD ON PROMISE HIRING ALL

79
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:59,009
FOUR OF HIS CLERKS ARE GOING

80
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,576
TO BE WOMEN.

81
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,744
>> SOMEONE WHO HAS

82
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,712
FREQUENTLY HAD A LOT OF

83
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,180
WOMEN CLERKS.

84
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,448
HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT

85
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:05,816
ENCOURAGING WOMEN THIS THEIR

86
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:06,783
CAREERS FIRST TIME IN

87
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:07,884
HISTORY THAT A SUPREME COURT

88
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:09,152
JUSTICE WILL HAVE HAD ALL

89
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,152
FEMALE CLERKS.

90
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,589
TAKE THAT JUSTICE GINSBURG.

91
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,057
AINSLEY: A LOT OF WOMEN

92
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:15,459
LOOKING AT ONE POLL, A LOT

93
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,593
OF WOMEN SAYING REPUBLICAN

94
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,694
WOMEN THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

95
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:18,729
GO TO THE POLLS VERY

96
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,763
IMPORTANT FOR THE MIDTERM

97
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,031
ELECTION TO GO TO THE POLLS

98
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,499
AND DEMOCRATS, IT'S ACTUALLY

99
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,866
GONE DOWN.

100
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:24,768
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS POLL.

101
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,170
IT'S NPR AND PBS MARIST

102
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:27,604
POLL.

103
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,139
IN JULY 81% OF DEMOCRATIC

104
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,073
WOMEN SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT

105
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,975
FOR THEM TO GO TO THE POLLS.

106
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:33,644
NOW, LOOK AT OCTOBER.

107
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:33,977
79%.

108
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,612
SLIGHTLY DOWN.

109
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,747
FOR REPUBLICAN WOMEN

110
00:02:36,748 --> 00:02:38,115
71 PERCENT SAID IT WAS

111
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,082
IMPORTANT?

112
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:39,383
JULY.

113
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:40,550
NOW 83% SAY OCTOBER.

114
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,618
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

115
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,286
DO YOU THINK THAT'S

116
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:42,653
ACCURATE?

117
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,054
>> YEAH.

118
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,022
I MEAN, WHEN I HAVE BEEN

119
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:45,822
WATCHING THIS CONFIRMATION

120
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:48,458
PROCESS IN PARTICULAR, IS

121
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,459
SEEING HOW CONCERNED WOMEN

122
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,427
HAVE BEEN ABOUT THIS

123
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:50,761
PROCESS.

124
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:51,495
THE DEMOCRATS WILL TELL THAT

125
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:53,130
YOU THERE IS A MONOLITHIC

126
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,631
VOICE FOR WOMEN.

127
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,866
HONESTLY I'M A CONSERVATIVE

128
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:56,166
WOMAN.

129
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:56,833
I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

130
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:57,968
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,

131
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,235
TOO.

132
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,970
WHEN WE HAVE DONE POLLING IN

133
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,538
RED STATES LIKE WEST

134
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,840
VIRGINIA, OR ARIZONA, OR

135
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:04,274
NORTH DAKOTA.

136
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,576
WE SAW IT WASN'T JUST STRONG

137
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:07,844
MAJORITIES THAT WANT

138
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:08,945
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED IN

139
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:09,346
GENERAL.

140
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:10,614
STRONG FEMALE MAJORITIES.

141
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:11,915
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO SUSAN

142
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:13,083
COLLINS' SPEECH LAST WEEK, I

143
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:15,052
THINK IT LINED UP VERY

144
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,053
CAREFULLY AND THOUGHTFULLY,

145
00:03:16,054 --> 00:03:17,621
WHAT A LOT OF WOMEN WERE

146
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:18,989
THINKING WHICH IS WE CARE

147
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,790
ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT.

148
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,091
WE WANT WOMEN TO BE HEARD,

149
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:22,059
BUT WE DON'T THINK THERE

150
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,261
SHOULD BE UNTHINKING SHUT UP

151
00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:25,862
MEN LINE LIKE SENATOR HIRONO

152
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,163
SAID.

153
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,531
WE THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT

154
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:28,031
BOTH SIDES.

155
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:29,299
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

156
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,801
I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF

157
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:31,668
AMERICAN WOMEN ARE DOING.

158
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,669
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

159
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,904
LOCALS OF DUE PROCESS.

160
00:03:33,905 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY WANT TO SEE THAT
