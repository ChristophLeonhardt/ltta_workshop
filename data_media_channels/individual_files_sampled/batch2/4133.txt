right now there are more than 100,000 North Koreans being held as political prisoners give us a look into these labor camps because for those of us who don't know who listened to the president and the picture he's painting about these North Koreans and their loyalty to Kim jong-un and how happy they'll be at the end of this tell us what their lives look like well I I've been to North Korea eight times and I have to admit that whenever I go I'm closely watched and not given much access but I've been to the rural areas I know about some of these very very bad reports about human conditions there are gulags there are prison camps many of the American prisoners that we've been able to get out and others have been in these prison camps in these labor camps a lot of it though is because of the extreme poverty in North Korea it's one of the poorest nations if not the poorest on earth especially in the rural areas Pyongyang has mainly the military the intelligence people those that work for the government their food is rationed they have minimal salaries but they survive I think the first step Stephane is full and fettered access by the United Nations into North Korea to document some of these abuses some of the prison conditions secondly allowing groups like Amnesty International Human Rights Watch to really look at the statistical situation regarding human rights I think those reports that we've gotten have been from defectors they're not direct human rights investigations by the UN because North Korea doesn't allow access to anybody of these types so I think this is very important that if we are going to have for instance investments in North Korea economic assistance that that assistance like the Congress has mandated be contingent on human rights be contingent on proper treatment of individuals an absence of torture ways that you know we conditioned our assistance to countries around the world otherwise the encouraging part is the President did say that Kim jong-un wanted to change things well you know there there's got to be pressure on that and you know I'm disturbed that we didn't talk about human rights more the president kind of glanced at it and said well we talked about it but very briefly we mainly were talking about denuclearization North Koreans get those signals when you don't raise an issue and this is very important for the international community and for the Korean people too then do you think the president doesn't understand how important the human rights issue is you know his perspective could be while those are the North Korean people I'm not responsible for them I'm responsible for the American people and the American people care about denuclearization could that be his perspective well yeah I worry about the president he seems to like dictators that are not very strong on human rights like duterte in the Philippines like Putin in Russia like many others now kim jeong-hoon you know i worry about that you know for some reason we shun some of the democracies our allies like what happened in this debacle and in Quebec with the European Union with with the Canadians you know you kind of wonder why is the president more comfortable with authoritarian figures and that's potterson because these authoritarian figures have very little regard for democracy for human rights treatments of their own people and and my hope is that with North Korea the situation is so bad it can't get any worse but so there's room dramatic room for progress so well it's still very very early to tell how would you grade this summit in terms of progress because we're coming off to your point an absolutely awful trip with our closest Democratic allies in Canada well I would say on the normalization front on the tone of the personal connection of the two leaders on defusing tensions in the peninsula I think that was a positive it was a historic summit on the denuclearization missile issue negotiations very vague this is typical of the North Koreans they they always want you to go first and we went first by suspending the military exercises then they say now then we'll do something well that's where they get you so I think a peace treaty negotiation hang it up there don't give it to them find ways that they denuclearize that they destroy weapons that they freeze the technology on the missile so it doesn't hurt Japan and South Korea and and the American mainland and in Hawaii and Guam and Alaska but you know the meat on the bones wasn't there on the important substantive issues and again human rights I just wish we had pushed harder I'm pleased about the issue of the servicemen there's five thousand remains of our soldiers from the Korean War I brought seven back in 2007 there are a lot of families around the country these are 17 18 year old kids that were killed in the Korean War and and the remains have to come back to give closure to their families it seems that progress was made on that issue but the the issue of human rights in the region in Asia is critically important especially since South Korea is such a thriving democracy and there is respect for democratic institutions and elections and human rights there hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to watch the latest
