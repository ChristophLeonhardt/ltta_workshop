withered away to three people but it

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,610
just it's like it's the people who just

39
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,040
intensely want to stand outside on a

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,580
cold december night and go wait to buy a

41
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,820
book we went to starbucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get some</font>

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,020
hot chocolate to warm us up and

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,310
starbucks is cheaper now by the way

44
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">because UK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has decreased vit from 17.5</font>

45
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,170
percent to fifteen percent which means

46
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,549
everything pretty much is cheaper but

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,810

48
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,280

50
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,250
sort of disgustingly materialistic but

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,799
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great when you want starbucks and</font>

52
