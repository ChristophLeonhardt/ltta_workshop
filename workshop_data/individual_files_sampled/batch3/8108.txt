FOR ERIC SCHNEIRDERMAN TO RESIGN AFTER NEW YORKER PUBLISHED DEVASTATING ACCUSATIONS FROM FOUR FORMER GIRLFRIENDS ACCUSING HIM OF BEATING THEM AND THREATENING TO KILL THEM. THEY DESCRIBED SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE, SLAPPING, HITTING, CHOKING. BEAR IN MIND THIS WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS PUBLIC CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS WHO, IN FACT, INTRODUCED ANTICHOKING LEGISLATION. BECAUSE SCHNEIRDERMAN HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING AND SUING DONALD TRUMP, SOME COMMENTATORS WROTE ABOUT STORY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE PEOPLE IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S GLOATING ABOUT THIS GIVEN THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF CHARGES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL. BUT INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER SCHNEIRDERMAN FOR HIS MISDEEDS AND ABUSE OF OFFICE, TODAY'S NEVER TRUMP MEDIA MERELY USED THE SCANDAL, IT'S JUST ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR TRASHING CONSERVATIVES. JOINING US TO ANALYZE GAIL TROTTER AND IN NEW YORK, KATHY, PUBLISHER OF CATALINA MAGAZINE. GAIL, REPORTING TERRIBLE ALLEGATIONS AND ERIC SCHNEIRDERMAN QUITTING ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, POWERFUL CRITICISM. SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COMMENDED O. KATHY, A LOT OF LEFT-LEANING JOURNALISTS, PEOPLE WHO HAD HIM AS GUEST, FELT BETRAYED BECAUSE HE WAS A DEMOCRAT WHO DID PUT HIMSELF FORWARD AS CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHT AND SUED HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND THERE WAS SENSE ON THE LEFT. HE BETRAYED WOMEN AND HUMANITY. THE STORY IS AWFUL BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL JOURNALISM. THIS IS A FREE PRESS AND THIS IS WHAT THE SUPPRESS SUPPOSED TO DO. THEY UNCOVERED SOMETHING TERRIFIC AND HORRIBLE, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AS IT RESULT, THIS IS JOURNALISM AT ITS BEST. I THINK WE HAVE A CONSENSUS, WHAT ABOUT SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM, WHAT DO YOU MAKE THE WAY THE STORY STARTED TO TURN? CLASSIC CASE ABOUT WHAT ABOUTISM AND THESE ARE SHOCKING AND APPALLING ALLEGATIONS AND QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED ESPECIALLY WHO KNEW WHAT AND WHEN THEY KNEW IT AND WE SEE THIS SHIFT TO WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE THAT HEADLINE IS TRUMP, SCHNEIRDERMAN, CHANGING SHAPE OF SEX SCANDAL, COMPLETELY CHANGED FROM IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT NEEDED TO BE CONTINUED AND FOLLOWED UP ONTO TIE REPUBLICANS AND PARTICULARLY PRESIDENT TRUMP. HOWIE: KATHY, THIS WAS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND KELLYANNE CONWAY SEEMED TO ENJOY DOWNFALL. STILL, THIS IS THE WAY JOURNALISM WORKS NOW. WE HAD THE STORY COME OUT AND NOW COMES THE ANALYSIS AND YOU DO HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT HAS HIS OWN ALLEGATIONS GOING ON, SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS FROM DIFFERENT EVERY DAY IN THE NEWS, SO WE HEAR NOW THAT THIS MAN, DEMOCRAT RESIGNED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T LEAD BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, SO PEOPLE ARE TURNING AROUND AND SAY, CAN OUR PRESIDENT LEAD AT THIS CRITICAL TIME GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE ALLEGATIONS. SO IT ONLY MAKES SENSE THAT THE NEWS CYCLE CAN START TURNING. THIS IS THE WAY JOURNALISM IS. HOWIE: AND ALSO REFLECTS, SOME PARTISANSHIP IN THE MEDIA, SO TWO VERY DIFFERENT. MAYBE, MAYBE. HOWIE: NBC HAS CONDUCTED, COMPLETED INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE MATT LAUER FIRING AND DECIDED THAT SENIOR MANAGEMENT WAS UNAWARE OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FORMER TODAY ANCHOR. THAT PROBE GOT CRITICISM, IT WAS CONDUCTED IN-HOUSE, NO OUTSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAUER'S FORMER COHOST, SHE WENT TO MANAGEMENT A COUPLE OF TIMES ABOUT WOMEN WHO CAME TO HER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT LAUER. LET ME GET YOU TWO ON ONE OTHER THING, THE PRESIDENT TWEETING AFTER STUDY BY CONSERVATIVE MEDIA GROUP REFLECTS OTHER STUDIES THAT NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE OF THE PRESIDENT IS 90% NEGATIVE, BUT THE PRESIDENT ATTACKED ONTO THAT TWEET, WHY DO WE WORK SO HARD IN WORKING WITH THE MEDIA WHEN IT'S CORRUPT? TAKE AWAY CREDENTIALS QUESTION MARK, GAIL, DOES THAT GO TOO FAR? NO EQUIVALENT OF TRUMP'S BIGGER BUTTON TWEET TO KIM JONG UN. HOWIE: HE'S GOING NUCLEAR WITH THE PRESS. HE'S TELLING THEM HE HAS THE CAPACITY AND THE MEDIA DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT TIED TO PLAYBOOK. THE MEDIA THINK THAT IS THE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CRITICIZE THE PRESS AND SHOULD NOT SUGGEST FAKE NEWS AND BAD REPORTING, PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST WANTS THE PRESS TO PLAY FAIR. HOWIE: WHEN YOU BRING UP CREDENTIALS, ONE THING TO DO IT AS CANDIDATE IN SOME CASES, IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN YOU DO IT WHITE HOUSE, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP WOULD DO THIS, IT'S TAKING A SLAP AT THE PRESS, DOES IT GIVE AMMUNITION THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD TRAMPLE ON FIRST AMENDMENT. THIS IS HORRIBLE. IS THIS A DICTATOR, ARE WE IN CUBA, RUSSIA, CHINA. THIS IS NOT STATE-RUNED NEWSPAPERS. HOWIE: IT'S JUST A TWEET. JUST A TWEET, I HAD MY WHITE HOUSE PRESS CREDENTIALS AND YOU WORK HARD TO GET CREDENTIALS, THEY DON'T HAND OUT TO ANYONE. TO SAKE THEY WILL TAKE AWAY CREDENTIALS, WE NEED THE MEDIA, EVERY MAN TO SIT INSIDE AND ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS. THEY NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE WITH THEM? IT'S NOT EASY TO GET CREDENTIALS, WE WORKED HARD TO GET THEM, JUST ANYONE FROM THE STREET CANNOT JUST WALK IN, YEAH. HOWIE: THEY DO NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN COVERAGE BUT I DON'T THINK THE PENALTY SHOULD BE PULL GET AWAY PRED CREDENTIALS.
