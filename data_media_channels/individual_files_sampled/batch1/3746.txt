growing up my father used to ask my brother and me what we had failed at at the dinner table which was so interesting and he'd celebrated and you'd actually be disappointed if I didn't have something that I failed at that week so I can remember saying dad dad I tried out for this and I was horrible and he would actually high-five me and say congratulations way to go and what it did was just reframe my definition of failure failure for me became not trying versus the outcome so so many people don't take risks for fear of failure they don't start the business they don't go create the art they want to create or they don't go try out to be in the play or whatever it is for the fear of failure and once you redefine that for yourself and realize the failure is just not trying then life opens up to in many ways and I would also my dad would encourage me anytime something didn't go the way I expected it to or maybe I got embarrassed by a situation to write down where the hidden gifts were and what I got out of it and I started realizing and everything there was some amazing nugget that I wouldn't have wanted to pass up it's thanks to encourage people to fail I'm bringing up my failures in front of the team often so I will stand up and I called them the oops of Spanx some of them are the ups throughout the history of Spanx some of them can be a recent oops that I did but I'm always openly talking about it if you're going to have a oops part of the beauty of it is twofold if there's a failure quote or an oops in your life if you learn from it and if you can laugh about it and it's all worth it
