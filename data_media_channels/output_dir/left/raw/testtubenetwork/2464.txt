00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,470
Riots and protests broke out during July and
August 2014 over the killings of Eric Garner

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,470
and Michael Brown.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,470
2.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,179
Then, in late November and early December,
a grand jury decided not to criminally charge

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:16,720
the police officers who were responsible for
the two deaths and protests erupted again.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,429
So, what are grand juries and how important
are they?

7
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,890
Well, a grand jury is like a test-run for
the prosecution

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,390
It’ a way for the prosecution to see if
there’s enough evidence to pursue criminal

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,960
charges, like murder.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,360
A grand jury differs from a trial jury mainly
because it’s entirely run by the prosecution

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,610
and it is just determining whether or not
criminal charges should be levied.

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,530
There is also no judge and no defense attorney.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,870
The prosecutor basically just throws all possible
evidence, witness accounts, and even hearsay

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,850
testimony at a jury -- to see if, in the right
conditions, a jury might decide there was

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,260
probable cause.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,600
The jury usually numbers between 16 and 23
people called at random just like criminal

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
juries.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,110
Although a grand jury’s decision is independent
of a trial jury’s verdict, it’s often

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,570
a good indicator of the direction that the
official trial will take.

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,170
In this case, the prosecutor found that there
was not enough evidence to bring these cases

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:18,720
to trial even though Garner’s case was officially
ruled a homicide and both men were unarmed.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,820
These decisions are also controversial because
grand juries usually choose to indict.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,400
Reports have said that 99 percent of all cases
that go before a federal grand jury end with

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,420
the the prosecution taking the case to criminal
trial and so do a majority of state grand

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,420
juries 3.

26
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,930
There’s a famous quote from Sol Wachtler,
a former chief judge of New York, that grand

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,280
juries will “indict a ham sandwich” if
the prosecution wants them to.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,570
However - the statistics also show that grand
juries rarely indict a police officer.4

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,910
An investigation by the Houston Chronicle
found that “police have been nearly immune

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,520
from criminal charges in shootings” in large
cities.

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,960
For example, grand juries in Dallas, Texas,
reviewed 81 officer-related-shootings between

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,619
2008 and 2012, and indicted only one person.

33
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:03,860
Grand juries can be useful.

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,590
If they choose to indict, a judge will see
that there’s enough evidence to move forward,

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,459
and a trial will be expedited

36
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,269
The problem here is that most grand juries
involving police action chose not to indict

37
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:21,909
and the victims of that police action have
no one fighting for them in front of the grand

38
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:26,340
jury, because the state and not the victim
chooses the prosecutor.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:40,799
