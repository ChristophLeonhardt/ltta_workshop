yesterday I did a video about young Earth Creationism and I explained why in my opinion based on what the text says and based on what we know from science we should not interpret day to mean a 24-hour period and I explained that that even if we are if we are taking it literally I think that in the context of Genesis the literal interpretation of day would not be 24 hours that would actually be a non literal interpretation because the literal interpretation of day all has to do not with with with how many hours but with the rotation of the earth and there's absolutely no reason to believe that in the first three first three days of creation as its told that you would have an earth that is rotating on a 24 hour cycle anyway you can go to iTunes or you can go back and watch that video to hear my whole argument needless to say everyone agreed with me there was there was really no debate at all there was no dissension and unanimous consensus was formed everybody went home went home happy just kidding of course people told me I was a heretic and that I would burn in hell well not everyone some people told me that many people though were very thoughtful and respectful in their disagreements that it was an interesting conversation now during that conversation one thing that I heard from atheist that I want to use as the springboard for today one thing I heard from atheists quite a bit is is this they said well if you're saying that it's scientifically impossible for God to create the universe in six days then why won't you accept that it's scientifically impossible for a person to be resurrected from the dead and young earthers actually make kind of the same argument but they frame at the opposite way where they say well if you if you think it's scientifically possible for a person be raised from the dead why don't you think it's possible for God to make the world in six days so I'd like to talk about the resurrection and whether or not science disproves it whether or not it's rational to believe in it but first before we get into that just to clarify I do not believe and did not say that it's impossible for God to make the world in six days God can do whatever he wants God is all-powerful God could make the world in 6 seconds God could make the world in any amount of time that he chooses god that's what it means to be all-powerful but my position is not that he can't do it in six days it's just that he didn't do it in six days from my reading of the text and looking at science I think that he did not do it though it's not a it's not a statement of what he can and can't do it's a statement about what he apparently did do just like if you believe that God could God did make the world in six days you're not saying I don't think you're saying they couldn't have or he Corps he couldn't make it in six billion years or ten or ten billion years or whatever you're just saying that he didn't do it that way so this is a discussion not of what he can do but of what he did do I think it's possible for God to make you know babies in in in the sky and then drop them down into our arms like he could do that but he doesn't do that he follows a process for making babies and in learning about that process we are by no means limiting God we are by no means setting parameters for God he sets the parameters we're just learning the parameters and trying to understand them so that we can understand more about this wonderful world that he's given us so since we're on the subject let's deal with the atheist contention that science disproves God and disproves the resurrection let's ask ourselves whether whether we must choose between science or the central doctrines of the faith or more perhaps more to the point is it reasonable is it rational to believe in the resurrection must we leave our reason behind if we're going to venture down that road and become Christians so let's start here let's start with one basic principle here science cannot disprove God okay it cannot disprove the supernatural by definition science is a thing for the natural realm the claim of a Christian or of any theist is that there is also a supernatural realm which science can't tell you anything about and I think intelligent atheists atheists who are careful and measured in their arguments they know this to be the case they understand this so if you listen to Dawkins or if you you know if you read or go and watch a YouTube video of Christopher Hitchens you'll find that this this is the way that they phrase it you know they'll say something like well science doesn't need God or science works without God they don't say that science disproves God because they know they can't say that they know that that would be a sloppy thing to say that they can't possibly support now of course I disagree with their contention that science doesn't need God or works without him but it's instructive that they do phrase the contention that way rather than saying that science offers positive proof that God does not exist that's more something that like a sloppy kind of atheist in a youtube comment section would say but smart ones know better they're not going to say that naturalism ok naturalism is the belief that there is nothing but the natural there's nothing but the physical world what you see is what you get basically that is a philosophical position it is not a scientific position and if you go into a study of scripture with that presupposition in mind then you're going to of course rule out all of the miraculous claims that you come across immediately because it contradicts your philosophy not because it contradicts science now Christians and Jews believe in a God who transcends the physical world and is not subject to its rules so you cannot disprove God by applying the rules of the physical world to him he sets those rules and in the fact the fact that the rules are so orderly the fact that you can do mathematics and you can do physics and you can work out equations and calculations and learn about the world and it all makes so much sense that is evidence for God not against him you know there's that famous Einstein quote where he said the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible so he was speaking about the incredible order and discern ability of the universe which is not what you would expect if we're talking about a random universe that was just that came out of nothing and came out of chaos you would not expect a universe that has ordered itself like this a universe that can be understood a universe that follows certain firm laws in a random and chaotic universe why should we be able to know or understand anything much less why should we even be here in the first place as as as living beings and especially as conscious beings how could these random forces assemble themselves in such an orderly way and then create out of nothing out of the void intelligent beings who can grasp these concepts and talk about them and argue about them how could that happen again this is evidence for God not against him the fact that you can do science at all would seem to give credence to the idea that the universe was constructed by an intelligent designer who had a purpose and a plan in mind so we can deduce I think from the intelligibility of the universe that there must be a God behind it that's a deduction we can make now of course we cannot perform some kind of equation and then or or work out some kind of like you know do some some kind of calculus and then and then say aha well there's God he's right there you can't do that any more than you can perform an equation and conjure up love right God is transcendent non-physical all-powerful not subject to the laws that he makes we cannot say therefore that anything is scientifically impossible for God now we can say that certain things are logically impossible for God or for anyone scientific impossibilities are different from logical and possibilities God can create a universe out of nothing that is not a scientific impossibility for him he cannot create a round square or a rectangular triangle because those are logical and possibilities in that they are nonsense and God does not cannot engage in nonsense nonsense as nonsense so it's like if you were if you were to ask God the question what's the color of the number seven that's a question God can't answer because it is a death by definition an unanswerable nonsense question so when confronted with claims when we you know when we are confronted with claims that God did this or that we can analyze those claims on two levels to try and figure out if the claims might be true number one we can ask is this claim consistent with the nature of God number two we can ask is it logically possible we can't ask is it scientifically possible we can ask is it logically possible when someone says that God instructed them to blow up a school bus full of children we can say definitively that that claim is false because it is not consistent with God's nature when someone says that 2+2 equals 16 because God told them so we could say definitively that is false because it is not logical the resurrection though does not contradict God's nature and it is not illogical therefore we have no rational or scientific reason to disbelieve it but of course that's not enough to say that there's that that there's necessarily reason to disbelieve it that's not enough that's not the same thing as saying that there is there are positive reasons to believe it but I do think there are positive reasons to believe it and and I'll give you two first history okay what's so incredible about Christianity is that it makes historical claims even I would say you know in the grand scheme of things you might you might even say recent historical claims recent in comparison to the whole history of the world it says that a historical event occurred 2,000 years ago and it's very specific about what that historical event entailed now if it made that historical claim and provided no evidence to support it then I think we'd have every reason to dismiss it if a religion is going to claim that God himself entered into human history at a particular point did a bunch of stuff and then died and was raised and appeared to people after his resurrection we should be able to provide documentation to prove it I mean you can't very well go and say that and expect someone to believe it and just take you at your word because there's this is this is supposed to be a historical event something that actually physically happened and that people witnessed and documented so then we can say well where is the proof and we have indeed I think quite a bit of historical proof what is the historical proof well we have the epistles of Paul first of all and I say the epistles first of all because they were even though the Gospels come before the epistles in in the Bible chronologically the epistles were written first they're written before the Gospels and though Paul was not one of the original twelve apostles he does testify to what the what the twelve reported and he also gives us you know Paul I think gives us maybe the best evidence in the entire New Testament if you look specifically at first Corinthians 15 and this letter was written probably in AD 54 55 so only twenty years or so after Christ and this letter is also among the seven letter the seven of the epistles of Paul that nobody no scholar disputes was authentically written by him and that's important because there are secular and atheist scholars who attempt to argue that certain of Paul's epistles were not written by him the pastoral epistles especially first and second Timothy and and Titus they'll say you know many secular atheist scholars will say those well those probably weren't written by Paul because it's a different style of writing and he appears to have you know changed his perspective on certain things now I think that's that's a bad argument those those letters were clearly written by Paul as well so the secular scholars are wrong on point but the point is that first Corinthians with first Corinthians you have a text that even the most skeptical will admit was written by Paul himself which i think is is pretty compelling and what does it say well you go to chapter 15 it says for what I received I passed on to you as a first important that importance that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to Cephas and then to the twelve and that he appeared to more than 500 of the bothers and sisters at the same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep then he appeared to James than all the Apostles and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born so here we have the significance of this is um you know most scholars that have looking at that looked at this text say that this is not just Paul freestyling here this is a very early Creed this is a statement of faith that he says was given to him and which he is passing on which means that by the time of this writing in fact by the time of his first visit visit to Corinth so a few earlier a few years earlier than that this Creed had already taken taken shape it had taken shape very quickly remarkably fast actually and it tells us some basic facts about Jesus including that he was crucified they died he was buried he rose from the dead and he appeared to 500 witnesses and then to the Apostles so I think that this along with Paul's other letters where he speaks about Jesus's death and resurrection frequently they all offer I think very good evidence for the resurrection but I think even more than that Paul himself his story what he did his his own biography is is even more compelling evidence because we know that he was a very strict Jew who originally considered the Christians to be to be heretics he helped to round them up and execute them but something happened something quite sudden occurred and then he changed there was a change in him and he went from a persecutor of the followers of Christ to persecute it in the name of Christ now how do we account for that as a skeptic if you're a skeptic how do you account for that I haven't really heard an even half away convincing argument the best you can do to try to explain you've got this guy persecutor of Christians strict observant Jew who comes to believe that Jesus rose from the dead and then goes and travels around the region preaching this putting his life in jeopardy writing these letters how do you explain that if if the resurrection never occurred the best you can do I think your only recourse really is is to claim that Paul was just a madman that he was a lunatic that he had a hallucination on the road to Damascus and and then he went insane and he decided to travel all around the region preaching gibberish now the problem with that is that we have the epistles we have what he preached we know what he preached we can see it for ourselves we're not getting at secondhand we're getting it from him and it's not gibberish it's not the ravings of a madman it's very dense very beautiful theology and philosophy this is obviously a deep thinker this is this is a very intelligent lucid human being you can tell that if you simply read his letters so that that explanation doesn't work you know you've uh you've probably heard the the the trilemma argument the three L's popular popularized by CS lewis liar lunatic or lord and the way that that argument goes what CS lewis said is well when it comes to Jesus although a lot of modern people will like to say that you know he was just a great moral he wasn't the Son of God he was just a great moral teacher who said a bunch of great stuff and then he died and that was it but CS Lewis's point famously is that well you you can't really do that you have to either accept him as the Lord or condemn him as a liar or a lunatic because a great moral teacher who is merely mortal wouldn't go around claiming that he was the son of God so either he was the son of God or he was an evil person or he was crazy now I used to like that argument use to think it was a very good argument and with all due respect to CS Lewis who is one of my favorite humans to ever walk the earth I think that actually I've come to realize that that argument is is not very good in fact it's not a great argument because it's kind of a straw man in that it leaves out the l word that almost every skeptic will actually choose which is legend so actually it's liar lunatic lord or legend most skeptics most most atheist most non-christians even those who are theists but are non-christians most of them what they'll say is yeah well well Jesus was you know he wasn't lying attic or Lord he was a legend either he didn't exist at all or he did exist but he never said the things that were attributed to him they'll try to say you know for instance well most of his claims of divinity happened in the Gospel of John which is the last one written so John made that up and blah blah blah you know these are the arguments they try to make obviously I think that argument is absurd but if you aren't going to accept Christ as Lord then legend is really the only option you have to go with and so that is the option that most atheists and so forth will go with which is why the trilemma thing just kind of breaks down but I think a version of this trilemma argument works much better for Paul than it does for Jesus because with Paul you have to believe that either he was telling the truth about Jesus or he was a pathological liar or he was a lunatic there really isn't a fourth option there is no tenable fourth option for Paul because we have his writings Jesus as far as we know never wrote anything at least we have no we have no we have no writings of Jesus aside from what he wrote in the sand when the adulterous woman was going to be stoned to death but with Paul you know we do have his writings and so even the most radical skeptics you know they can't deny his existence and they can't claim that he didn't say the things that we claim he said because we have his own words so then what's it gonna be we know Paul's not a legend so read through the epistles what's it gonna be is this a lunatic speaking when you read the epistles do you think this is a crazy man no I think clearly not is it a liar well he certainly appears to be a man of great integrity and sound ethics what's more he's given his life over to preaching this news around the world he's risking his life in the process why would he do that for a lie so that seems to leave only the first option that he's telling the truth he's telling the truth not only about what was reported to him but also about his own conversion experience and his own encounter with the risen Lord so I think that's you know Paul Paul gives us great evidence what other evidence do we have well obviously we have the gospel we have four canonical Gospels we don't know exactly for sure when they were written we don't know for sure which order they were written in a theist will try to say that we don't even know who wrote them that they were anonymous writings but I think that's completely ridiculous it's ridiculous because we do know who wrote them their names are on the documents and you and and and their names have always been on the documents you go back and look at the ancient manuscripts and their names have always been attached to them so these are not anonymous writings and you know these days in terms of when they were written these days marking priority is popular that is that many scholars especially secular ones say that mark was written first and then Matthew and Luke and then John last of all there does seem to be unanimous consensus across the centuries starting very early on that John went last and that he wrote his gospel when he was an old man so everyone seems to agree on that but for a long time it was thought that Matthew wrote his gospel first the Church Fathers thought that you know and it doesn't really matter that much although you can see why secular scholars want mark to have gone first so they are going to try to work the evidence in such a way so that mark can go first and why do they want mark to go first of all because mark was not an eyewitness neither was Luke so it's convenient for mark to go first in the mind of a skeptic because the Synoptics Matthew Mark and Luke are called Synoptics because they're so very similar and it's clear that somebody went first and then the others use that first one as a source though not their only source so if Matthew used mark as a source of though Matthew was an eyewitness and Mark wasn't then the Atheist thinks he can argue well Matthew must not have been eyewitness because what kind of eyewitness would use a non eyewitness as a source well this isn't really a problem at all first of all there's a very good chance that Matthew did go first you know that he was the first gospel the earliest traditions say so which is pretty strong reason to believe it these are the people that were you know around within a century or so of the gospel being written they all believe that Matthew went first but um but anyway Mark was a companion of Peter Peter was in a privileged position as an apostle and we know that he saw things and he was likely told things that the others weren't he was he was he was closer to Jesus than Matthew was so if Mark did go first and he got his information from Peter that make sense that Matthew though he was a disciple of Jesus as well would refer back to Peter through mark in any case whatever the order we have within a few decades of Christ's death death for Gospels that attest to Christ's life and work and death and resurrection these Gospels are written clearly they are written in biographical fashion according to how biographies were written back in those days they weren't written like modern biographies but they are written like ancient biographies and they also lack the kind of dramatic detail and embellishment that you would expect if these were made-up stories in fact in fact we do also have very ancient made-up stories about Jesus so we know what those look like if you go to the apocryphal Gospels the so-called Gospels of Peter Judas Thomas Mary which which are made up fabric fabricated forgeries and these do contain wild and obviously fabricated stories I think the Gospel of Thomas has a story about for instance about the Child Jesus murdering another child in the village when he was a boy I'm not sure why you would want to have Jesus doing that but that's that's that's in the I believe it's the Gospel of Thomas has that but the church uniformly rejected the apocryphal Gospels and that's important the church did not just accept any Jesus material could get its hands on it's not like it it had no discerning process it subjected these writings to rigorous analysis and would only accept the ones that were authentic even if the authentic ones were frankly a bit more boring than the fake ones so the Gospels are are very compelling evidence and we should also note here that although we don't have the originals of any of these documents we do have a ton of early manuscripts thousands of them and what's really incredible I think is that these early manuscripts written over the course of many years by many scribes match up extremely extraordinarily well now you'll sometimes hear from atheists you know you'll you'll hear sometimes hear them say that well there are hundreds of thousands of variants in the biblical manuscripts differences in other words between the manuscripts and then they'll say that well it was like it's like the game of telephone you know the story of Jesus started in the you know around the year thirty ad and then it was passed down it's like the game of telephone and it was morphed and changed and so on and so forth but that's actually not what you see when you look at the manuscripts that the vast majority of the differences in the manuscripts are irrelevant to they're just typos basically they're you know ancient typos when it comes to the substance when it comes to the significant information they're they they're identical there is no evidence at all that anything was added or taken out that would change the fundamental meaning of the Gospels so that's very significant now some people demand that we you know have evidence outside the Bible and I think that's kind of silly personally the best eyewitness accounts of Jesus were included in the Bible because they were the best accounts so what you're saying is oh I want another eyewitness account well if there were other eyewitness accounts of that same veracity they would have been in the Bible the ones that are that are really good are in the Bible for a reason so to ask for other accounts I think it's kind of disingenuous or in other words what I'm saying is to discount all of the eyewitness accounts that are in the Bible because there in the Bible is extremely disingenuous but um we do have other accounts as it happens we do have other mentions of Jesus there are some Roman historians who lived in the apostille ik age who provide independent non biblical non-christian even anti-christian attestation of Christ's life and death Josephus is one I'm sure you've heard of Josephus Jewish Roman historian and now he you know he he his reference to Jesus is disputed it's clear that there was some embellishment later on some Christians added to it but it's also clear that he did at least mention Jesus and then even more interesting Tacitus another historian around the same time as Josephus first century and this is a guy who didn't like Christians he had this is what he says in one of his writings he says Christ the founder of the name had undergone the death penalty in the reign of tiberius by sentence of Pontius Pilate and a pernicious superstition was checked for the moment only to break out once more not merely in Judea the home of the disease but in the capital itself where all things horrible and shameful in the world collect and find a vogue so this is extremely significant because they detest not just to Christ's existence but to his death under Pontius Pilate and to the belief the superstition he calls it that Jesus rose from the dead and this is obviously someone who hates Christians and is very insulting towards them so he has no reason to make this up at all but even he attest to this so you'll notice you don't have there are plenty early critics of Christianity none of them claim that Jesus didn't exist that the Christians you know are making all this up he's a mythical figure the early critics of Christianity who would have been in a position to know if this stuff was completely made-up they don't claim that so a ton of evidence very good evidence and then the final category of evidence we have is the church itself how it was formed under what circumstances you know we know that something happened something happened to cause the early Christians starting with the Apostles to believe that Jesus was the son of God and then to give their whole lives over to this belief and even to give their lives up to this belief you know tradition tells us that that the Apostles were all martyred I believe that to be the case we don't have documented proof for all of them but we do for some it's generally accepted by pretty much everyone that Peter was martyred so we have very early writings that attest to the fact that Peter and Paul were martyred well something happened that made Peter decide that he was willing to die for this man Jesus who he knew and if the resurrection of Jesus was alive then Peter would have known it he would have participated in the lie and would be dying for something that he knew to be a lie and that's very difficult to believe and we know that Christianity spread somehow against all odds this obscure cult of Jews running around claiming that a criminal who had been crucified actually come back from the dead and was the Son of God this strange collection of illiterate peasants somehow they managed to start a movement that eventually and rather quickly took over the entire world you know see skeptics will want to compare Christianity to n22 other religions and they'll make this kind of plurality of religion argument well where they say well there are so many religions out there and they're all basically the same I mean how can you claim that one is true and the others aren't well except the Christianity is not like the others that's just that that's that's that's a frank ly stupid thing to say even if you don't believe in Christianity you have to admit that it's different it is unique you can't deny that you can only try and explain away the uniqueness but you can't deny its uniqueness no other religion in history has done what Christianity did especially in that context under those conditions and so quickly that in and of itself doesn't prove that Christianity is true but it does mean that you can't go around saying well it's just like every other religion you do have to admit that it's unique and once you've admitted that and then you will you allow then you allow for all the other evidence and you look at all the other other evidence I think it starts to pile up and it becomes rather overwhelming so these are all really good reasons to believe in Christianity rational reasons historical reasons scientifically plausible reasons are they sufficient though is this all you need well there is a strand of Christian apologetics that that would say yes this is enough this is all you need you can prove Christianity historically you can prove that it's true and then you can accept it entirely based on the evidence so if you go you know you look up guys like Mike Lee Kona Gary Habermas Lee Strobel with the case for Christ I never saw the movie I did read the book finally recently actually and that's the approach that they take you know they'll say that well you you know you believe in Christianity surely because of the history you can prove it historically habermas is fond of saying that he believes Christianity because of the data well I do think the data is good I think the history is good I think the evidence is very strong I think the evidence is enough to make you stop and take this seriously and pay attention but if you're really intent on disbelieving you can always explain everything away so the evidence is good it would even say it's overwhelming it is not sufficient in and of itself you still need faith so that is the second reason why I believe in Christianity you have the evidence you can't completely discard faith you can't get around it nor should you try because there's no shame in it it's not irrational I'm not embarrassed to say that I have faith in Christ's atoning death and resurrection now the evidence can lead me down a path towards the truth and get me pretty darn close to it but eventually I'm going to come to a chasm with the truth on the other other side and I'm going to have to make a leap a leap of faith you know that you are gonna have to make that leap of faith but you have to take a leap either way so either you make the leap toward Christ or you make it away from him either way you're making a leap I make that leap towards him God gave us a historical event that we could learn about explore come to understand study and he also gives us faith through the Holy Spirit which speaks to us in our hearts and convicts us but the point is and it's important it is faith yet it is a rational faith it's a reasonable faith as William Lane Craig would say it's a faith that does not ask you to take leave of your senses or deny your reason or put your rationality on hold or to never you know to never think logically about things it is a faith that is grounded in an actual physical historical event it's a faith that says yes this thing happened go go learn about it for yourself go look at the evidence you know where this is not some like secret cult where we're not going to reveal the truth to you until you've been fully indoctrinated you know that's not what this is this is here's the evidence go look for it yourself so to be a Christian it may mean appearing like a fool to the world but it doesn't mean actually being a fool we can keep our wits we can be intelligent realistic rational people and yet still have faith because ours is a God of light of truth who says Here I am here's the truth now enter into it and learn and that I think is a really amazing thing have a great weekend everybody Godspeed you
