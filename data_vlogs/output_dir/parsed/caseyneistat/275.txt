all right
so nice in here
for a run you know my running is really
really been slacking lately can this
reminds me daily that I'm getting fat so
this morning serious run : this is the
Manhattan Bridge I'm meeting one of my
homies on this bridge he's a great
runner here which is gotta be like eight
seven there's a lot of miles
solid run this morning I did 13 points
13.1 miles at a 748
this is a fig the name of this episode
is I got a Learjet or something like
that I haven't upload our made it yet so
I don't but you get then I guess let's
talk about clickbait clickbait is a
beautiful term and what it means is when
the title serves one purpose that's to
get you to click and it can be like two
horribly misleading but as long as you
clicked the bait has succeeded okay I
don't I don't I don't believe in click
there's like a lot of caveats here
clickbait at times can be just egregious
and horribly misleading and the rule
that I try to follow is to intrigue but
not mislead I want you to see the title
day hmm wonder what's going on there
click playing like oh this is great
that's intriguing
but if you click on the title you're
like this guy's foolish then I've misled
you sometimes you do a really good job
of this like the $21,000 first-class
seat great title totally intriguing and
perfectly accurate and then sometimes I
just totally screwed up and you guys
give me a hell for in the comments today
hey somewhere in the middle okay hey you
doing get the border Teterboro Airport
that's right
I'm on my way to Teterboro Airport right
now which is like a small airport in New
Jersey not far from the city but here's
what's going on I hear all kinds of
weird emails to my website all the time
every once in a while I get awesome
emails like this ready hi case you have
a professional pilot on a Learjet
we are flying in to Teterboro today and
then we are repositioning to
Philadelphia in the next couple of days
with an empty plane I know it's not a
lot of flight but I wanted to offer a
free ride if you're interested in going
to Philadelphia maybe you're thinking
like why would you fly someplace you
don't need to go but a private jet is
like this is like this is an empty
plenty to be like it's my plane this is
a Perry I'm in my lights this is a very
special opportunity so yes I am getting
my own private jet but I only get it for
like a half an hour flight or something
and I'm more like cargo than like the
actual like guests on the plane but
still what an opportunity I never fly
never had but I was in the airport but
you seen them before
yeah I see many time okay
this is it this was the coolest I'm back
at the airport ever okay wait these are
the dudes that invited me Adam
