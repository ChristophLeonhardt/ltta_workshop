people think that the internet is dividing the country that liberals are just hanging out with liberals and conservatives or just hanging out with conservatives and nobody's hearing the opposing points of view this is just dead wrong in the data sets Stevens video it's a writer for The New York Times former Google data scientist and I'm the author of the book everybody lies it is true that online you're more likely to come across people who share your political views than people who will have opposing political views liberals go to new sites that are more visited by liberals and they have Facebook friends who are more likely to be liberal and queer conservatives is exactly reversed but what people forget is this is also true offline that people's friends family members neighbors coworkers are all far more likely than average to share their political views so actually the you're more likely to come across some of the opposing political views online than you are offline one of the reasons for this is if you think of your Facebook friends some of them are not your closest friends there may be a third cousin who you barely sorta kind of know or high school acquaintances that you've mostly lost touch with and these people you're not going to necessarily go to a bar going to drink with you're not going to invite to a dinner party you're not going to go to attend yoga class together but you do see their Facebook post and they frequently have the opposite political views as future
