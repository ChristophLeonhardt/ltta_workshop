following the United Nations announcement that the UN Security Council would roll out a new set of sanctions against North Korea and its missiles program of course kim jeong-hoon had some strong words against the united states and those who have pushed for the sanctions so a Korean Central News Agency which is the state-owned news agency in North Korea released a statement in regard to the sanctions and said the following packs of wolves are coming in attack to strangle a nation they should be mindful that the DPRK strategic steps accompanied by physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength to summarize we're gonna go after the people who have pushed for the sanctions we want retaliation now this isn't any different from what North Korea typically does they have released a number of statements that have been threatening and violent against the United States however what is different about this story is the way leadership in the United States has responded to it and we'll get to that in just a second one quick note it is slightly different slightly in that North Korea is in that statement threatening quote-unquote physical action now the things about the wolves are coming and wolf dash pack.com get money out of polymer salos against us that kind of word the top statements are very normal for North Korean leadership we like to think that our leadership is a little bit more stable but oh well but the reference to physical action is a little bit more aggressive but I would hope that we would be measured in our response so we don't accidentally trigger a cataclysmic war but that leads us to Donald Trump exactly so Donald Trump was asked about the statement released by North Korea and his reaction to it was not measured take a look for yourselves North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen he has been very threatening beyond a normal statement and as I said they will be met with fire fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before thank you that's what are you doing man Jesus Christ so if you had a smart guy in power even a guy that I massively disagree with like Dick Cheney okay and he was making threats well I'd be concerned because he's carried out his threats before but you know that he put some thought into it and that he has a strategy and maybe the strategy used to push you in a war maybe it's to get some sort of you know a bargaining chip but the guy's got a strategy with Trump you don't know so you don't know if he's just being a clown and being like oh well sure you or is he actually threatening nuclear war because fire and fury like the world has never seen before well we've seen nuclear bombs and are nuclear bombs today are much more forceful and and more powerful so if you're taking him literally and I know the White House always says remember the president's an idiot and you should never take him literally but if you're taking him literally that means using our new modern nukes against North Korea and that's insane so that could push us into a war again that I've been warning about from day one I said the number one threat with Trump in office is the the conflict in North Korea his incompetence could accidentally trigger a war that could cost hundreds of thousand wives possibly millions of lives right we're talking about you know innocent civilians who are unfortunately under dictatorial government and we're in a North Korea there but not the u.s. but almost that's a good point but yes so so I mean obviously one the reasons why we haven't engaged in that type of war with North Korea is because of a number of different ramifications it's not just the fact that all sorts of innocent civilians will die as a result of you know military action nuclear action against the country but then there's the issue of South Korea there's the issue of Japan how is it going to impact those countries as well I mean this is obviously a very complicated issue that requires foreign policy strategy that someone like Donald Trump doesn't seem to be educated on and so for those who listen to his statements and think oh yeah it sounds great on the surface level yeah I guess tough talk sounds great but we're talking about you know what I would argue is an irrational actor with kim jeong-hoon we're talking about you know them developing missiles that could certainly already hurt kill innocent individuals I just think he's Donald Trump is not measured he refuses intelligence briefings he's not even an intellectually curious person who would want to learn about all the nuances of this issue and he just speaks off-the-cuff and maybe that's okay during a presidential campaign but it's not okay when we're talking about nuclear war and we're talking about you know people's lives at risk okay so there are only a couple possibilities as to why he would say this okay well one is as an opponent out there to sound tough maybe it sounded like somebody told him to say those exact words that's why you repeat it a couple of times it could be a Steve banning thing where he's like oh this will appeal to your base you'll seem so tough and strong if you use the words fire and fury and power that the world has never seen before so but if you're doing that you're doing that for internal political reasons maybe to improve your poll numbers but remember there's a madman on also on the other side and you don't know what that's gonna trigger in him and now there are reports which probably Donald Trump has never seen because he's doesn't care to find out facts that North Korean leadership is scared to death of what happened to Qaddafi and they think if we don't have nuclear weapons Qaddafi gave up his nuclear weapons and that left him defenseless and so at some point the u.s. in the West turned on him and he wound up being lynched in the streets so they have that fear when you say we are going to strike you well then you stoke that fear up and God knows what shit kim jeong-hoon and his generals will do so it might be for political reasons which is you're playing with fire literally in this case it might be because you think oh well just Newcombe what's the big deal oh my god I mean even if North Korea did not retaliate somehow our nukes wiped him out completely and none of them could launch any of their missiles and kill the people in South Korea with great ease I mean and then Lindsey Graham that monster is the Republican senator from South Carolina says no we'd be taking the fight over there these people wouldn't die here so flippant with the lives of South Korean and Japanese civilians that it's grotesque it's inhumane but even if that didn't happen what we would nuke innocent North Korean citizens what how many of them hundreds of thousands would die millions would die and they're basically held captive by the dictators who run North Korea it's almost the almost the entire country is a concentration camp and you're gonna nuke the camp you know you go what you're gonna destroy the village to save the village you're gonna destroy the country to save the country so there are no good responses here and look North Korea isn't incredibly I know Trump didn't know this and recently discovered it but it's a complicated issue and yes you have to apply pressure to China and Russia yes the recent sanctions I think are our good idea and boy that's a tough call because yes they also have a destabilizing effect I understand that and it also punishes the civilians but you can tell from the reaction of the government that they are deeply concerned about those sanctions and so at least that is a lever we can use and to actually get them to comply without going to war so let the sanctions do their work put more pressure on trying to put more pressure on Russia because that has a chance of working but if you go in they're telling you about weapons the world has never seen before and fire and fury you're going to start a war and to all of you look who voted against Hillary Clinton during the general election cuz you're afraid that she was gonna lead us to war what happened now okay so look I was for Bernie Sanders I didn't want any of the war mongers I didn't want any of the establishment guys whether they're deep state or whatever the hell you want to call them but you thought no Trump won't start a war what kind of a sorry but you were dead wrong I'm worried that might be literal now this is a press conference or a photo-op about the opioid fight and he sat back that's why I clue that first part he sat back in the reporters shouting out questions all she asked asked him was what do you think about the latest about the North Korea's nuclear our so on what they said they can do so it had nothing to do with what he was sitting down there for this wasn't a plan it wasn't a political scheme to be like let's use fire and fury and an overwhelming power today they may have said that in meetings before so definitely the words were said to him to hype him up because this is we're gonna talk about he asked get hyped up every day and he's like oh I'll answer that question cuz I just heard I'm supposed to I'm so hyped up now I'm a badass and he answered it off-the-cuff cuz that's just what he thinks the limit of the world is that hold that hold the descriptions you went through Jake without where I can go and what it could be in this effect and that effect and that push in that pool none of that ever crossed his mind he's just going room United States of America we have overwhelming force and power and fire and fury that's all I have to say and they're gonna respect me it's all he thinks and yet and that's exactly what I'm worried about it is a combination of incompetent incompetence and hubris now take all go back to the election for a second kind of like Hillary Clinton's campaign incompetence matched only by their hubris and so and here's Trump's they keep said man I keep getting bankrupt that I can get bailed out and I you know and then I ran a disastrous campaign and I got bailed out by someone who was even worse than me so I'm untouchable I'm a genius this has all worked out for me so what am I gonna do ah what do we have the nukes for he had says he said that in the past he said what do we have the nukes or we're not gonna use him he doesn't think through the consequences of anything and he thinks we're America they're North Korea we're to win what does win mean I mean look at what happened in Iraq we won by deposing Saddam Hussein and then invited a gigantic colossal nightmare that then killed so many of our troops so many Iraqi civilians destabilize the Middle East created Isis and Iraq does not have as many weapons as North Korea does and the other day were not as entrenched and they were not as near civilian populations like Seoul South Korea Tokyo Japan etc this guy we got to get him off out of office immediately immediately look if look this resistance and all that stuff it's not a lot of patty-cakes okay lots of just playing around no no we gotta act right now this guy is a danger to the whole world he's gonna get all of these people killed if you were worried about World War three you were worried about the deep state you should be doubly worried about Trump you got to get him out right now it's time to end this nonsense with like oh but we'll help him on tax reform and but you know but we'll kind of fight him on health no get him out get him out get him out because this guy's gonna start a war help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
