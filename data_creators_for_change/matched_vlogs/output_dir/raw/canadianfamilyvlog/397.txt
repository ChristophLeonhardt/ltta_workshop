budget savvy in the next week's and

101
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,560
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> too as well last week it was</font>

102
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,990
really tough because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we needed household</font>

103
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,730
items which added up you know like

104
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,090
bathroom cleaner

105
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,250
paper and Kleenex and dishwasher

<font color="#CCCCCC">needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> added up oh and</font>

108
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,050
diapers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wipes and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really awful</font>

109
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,210
to right now because Levi's on homo milk

110
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,350
and then my<font color="#E5E5E5"> family drinks a lot of milk</font>

111
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,260
so it's like thirteen dollars on milk

112
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,380
alone but yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy five dollars</font>

113
00:07:35,380 --> 00:00:00,000
six dollars cash not too bad
