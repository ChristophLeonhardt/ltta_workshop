1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,511
FARMERS ARE FEELING IT RIGHT

00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:03,012
NOW.

3
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,414
CONNELL McSHANE AT A SOW BEAN

4
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,849
FARM IN IOWA.

5
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:07,183
CONNELL?

6
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:08,484
>> HI, NEIL.

7
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:09,819
YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IT IN

8
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:12,522
STOCKS BUT WE SAW A BIT OF A

9
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,023
DROP IN SOY BEAN PRICES.

10
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,258
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE ON

11
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:18,628
THIS BEAUTIFUL FARM IN IOWA,

12
00:00:18,628 --> 00:00:19,829
THERE'S SOY BEAN PLANTED FOR THE

13
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,030
FALL HARVEST.

14
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,598
THE HOPE IS THAT MANY OF THOSE

15
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:25,768
SOY BEANS WILL END UP IN CHINA.

16
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,204
WE'LL TALK TO RON HECK WHO IS

17
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:29,906
KIND ENOUGH TO HAVE US ON HIS

18
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:30,206
FARM.

19
00:00:30,206 --> 00:00:32,141
IT'S A $12 BILLION A YEAR

20
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:32,542
BUSINESS.

21
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,377
WITH ALL OF THIS TALK OF TRADE

22
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:35,812
TENSIONS WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON

23
00:00:35,812 --> 00:00:36,813
YOUR BUSINESS SO FAR?

24
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,548
>> SO FAR SO GOOD.

25
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:40,550
IT'S ALL TALK.

26
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,085
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET.

27
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:45,254
ONE OUT OF THREE ROYS OF SOY

28
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,356
BEANS GOES TO CHINA.

29
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,124
IT'S NERVE RACKING WHEN YOUR

30
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:50,159
COMMODITY IS BEING NEGOTIATED.

31
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,260
>> WHAT IS THE BIG CONCERN?

32
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,763
THE CHINESE ARE BUYING OTHER

33
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,097
PLACES.

34
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,064
THEY'RE BUYING FROM SOUTH

35
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:55,398
AMERICA.

36
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:57,100
WHAT IS THE CONCERN FOR YOU AS

37
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,267
THE TALKS CONTINUE?

38
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,504
>> CHINA IS A SEASONAL BUYER.

39
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:03,006
THEY BOTH OF THEIR BEANS FROM

40
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,706
SOUTH AMERICA AND MOST OF THE US

41
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,342
IS FOR SIX MONTHS.

42
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:09,245
AT THE START OF OUR HARVEST.

43
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,781
SO IN SEPTEMBER, THE CHINESE

44
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:13,082
NEED SOY BEANS HERE.

45
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,318
IF THEY DON'T, OUR PRICES WILL

46
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:15,818
GO DOWN.

47
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:17,920
>> AND THEY THREATENED MORE

48
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,287
TARIFFS.

49
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,822
DO YOU SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S

50
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:20,256
APPROACH?

51
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:22,058
>> SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE.

52
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:25,094
WE WERE CONTINUALLY LOSING

53
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,195
CHINESE MARKET CHAIR.

54
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,364
CHINA ALREADY CHARGES IMPORT

55
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:28,698
TARIFFS.

56
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:31,834
SO IT WAS TIME FOR A DISCUSSION.

57
00:01:31,834 --> 00:01:33,102
HOPEFULLY TO GET BETTER TERMS

58
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,171
FOR FUTURE SALES AND GET OUR

59
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,139
MARKET SHARE BACK UP TO WHERE IT

60
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,273
WAS A FEW YEARS AGO.

61
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,708
>> RON, THANKS SO MUCH.

62
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,309
YOU HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE

63
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,411
STORY A LOT TODAY.

64
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,145
THAT'S THE THING.

65
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,913
A GUY LIKE RON DOESN'T CHANGE

66
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:45,915
THE WAY HE DOES BUSINESS, BUT AS

67
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:47,517
YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT, HE'S

68
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:48,785
BRACING FOR THE FUTURE AND

69
00:01:48,785 --> 00:00:00,000
HOPING FOR THE BEST.
