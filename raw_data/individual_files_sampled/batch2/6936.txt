my regulation is that Kris Kobach is the current secretary city's current Secretary's right so he is determining his own election as to whether he's going to win let alone Brent's election yes he's sir since 2011 Secretary of State Oh Kansas so under Kobach reign the guy who's so-called worried about voter fraud oh by the way it's almost always projection right has something go dramatically wrong in one of the counties and under his purview yes so now and it's a county that is as of right now with 11 percent reporting going for Coulier but it's frozen it's frozen with Coulier at 13 and a half thousand votes Kris Kobach at nine point seven thousand votes so it's swinging a good bit to Collier it's so listen guys I don't sound crazy but yeah no no look the Kris Kobach is literally the least trustworthy person in politics in America yeah I agree with John even more so than Donald Trump so that's why I was wondering earlier like why if something was nefarious which I doubted a great majority of time the answer's incompetence right why would they care about a Democratic primary I was saying right like who do they even know who would they would be better off being up against but they would care about the Kris Kobach race yeah Kris Kobach would care about the Kris Kobach race he's secretary of state that's the one County he's losing in and all of a sudden they stopped counting and there's a computer error we'll see whores and being Brent is we see a shot of his victory party and he's pouring champagne no but we don't know we don't know yeah so look that's exactly my point which is you must be really careful in verifying the vote otherwise we have things like this where we have questions that I mean how could you not have a question about that only a like a person there's a couple of different camps here there's a historian camp that immediately will jump of a conclusion that there was a conspiracy hold on we don't have any of the facts yet yeah you know okay and then there's a camp unfortunately which is the great majority of the media it's fine it's fine what do you mean it's fine it's fine oh that's crazy because they think that it's not fine well hold on we don't have the facts yet you're sound just as crazy as the conspiracy guys how would you know it's fine if you don't know what the facts are I agree right and but nine out of ten times the media is always jumps to oh come on don't be conspiratorial that's crazy no it's fun but hold on how would you know it's fine like can you alright well number one right now obviously you can't double to be fair to the media and anybody else covering in no one here no one cares other than us right because we care about the Kansas third district is it's a super important race for progressives in the country and yes some people care about the Kobach race and they might be animated etc but in my experience the minute there is an official story ninety percent of the media media immediately goes to there's an official story there's a it's done there's an official story no no your job is to go investigate the official story and try to figure out if it's true or not your job is not to say oh I dictated a thing that says official story and we're done Oh Kris Kobach says Kris Kobach one and that computer glitch in the middle of the county he was losing in a race that is razor thin it's nothing to worry about okay we're done with it we're done with it right so I don't know I don't know unlikely it's a computer problem because there are computer problems this can be can it be sorted out well we're in the middle of it so there's no way of knowing right have you ever seen computer problems not sorted out yeah me a million times right and my second monitor hasn't worked for a couple days I cannot figure out how to get back on so how many times can I say it we need to spend whatever money it takes to make sure that every single vote can be verified and not a BS oh it's fine it'll be fine an official person at some point said it was official no there's got to be a system in place and right now it's in tatters it's it's it gives us no confidence at all so at the end of the day when Johnson County presumably in a couple hours says yeah we fixed it that's the ticket this anybody and if they declare Kris Kobach the winner are we're just gonna move on with our lives is that what's gonna happen even though he's losing in that County and that would probably be enough to swing the election and it what is he he's now up by 0.3 not by 0.3 right but he's losing in that County pretty significantly yeah yeah so look we're alive okay so I don't you might be watching this live you might be watching it later so and it could turn out later hey no the county came in and it's fine and Kovac it turns out that county went as it was supposed to and Kobach lost okay great hey you know what that gives me a little bit more confidence because you're not gonna review my election against yourself right okay presumable 3-dimensional to write it or it might come in where they go have the county switched after the computer problem it then started voting for it turns out people actually had voted for Kovac and now he's won the election and I guarantee you guys and so since we're live we don't know what's gonna happen so I'm telling you if they come back and that if that County magically switches to being proko back they win he wins the election and they print it and they say it's official ninety two ninety nine percent of the media will immediately lie down they'll lie down immediately it's official it's official what can we do right I'm not telling you afterwards I'm telling you ahead of time I hope I'm wrong because again we're live right now as we do this right we do cover election nights every time there's an election like this right so it might turn out that it's not an issue that's by the way the most likely scenario it's most likely there was some level of incompetence time took a little bit of time they count it and it comes in as it was supposed to as all the previous indicators indicated Kovacs losing right now in that county is Brent welder winning in that County in that County I don't have access to okay that area so Brent welders winning overall in his race and the Democratic side in Kansas third District and it might come back and it might be totally fine or it might be that I'm wrong it comes back really irregular and the media goes no way we're on this we're flying to Kansas we're not gonna accept the official results we need real answers but John was the last time that ever happened approximately you have a 2000 election I know approximately never right so if they might so they got all the opportunity in the world and they might even see this video right of us covering it live say I bet you lie down I bet the minute somebody says it's official you stop doing your job and go to sleep okay because that's what's happened every time so I'm looking everywhere and by the way there's another scenario the scenario is they look into it and the press I'm wrong and the press it is our lions and they go no you have to verify this Chris Kobach is not a trustworthy guy and you can't tell me that you had an irregularity in an election that you supervise and then trust me I won the election and maybe the press do their job and then they go and look into the computer and it turns out it was that Kovac actually did win right and and it was a real glitch and they can absolutely verify it that's also possible but I we regular citizens cannot rest until you have some verification it doesn't mean that there's a conspiracy but the job of the media is not to go to one side or another without facts the job of the media is to try to ascertain the facts so if that irregularity persists and Kovacs is declared the winner because that is the more the welder campaign we care more about but the Kobach campaign is the one that is more questionable here he's the Secretary of State how can you maintain that position and be running he's running it's a razor-thin margin all of a sudden the computer stops working in a county he's losing that is a giant giant question mark and the only County that is not fully reported if it were allowed to continue it would appear that he would fall behind it lose yeah I'll tell give you one more thing okay if that giant question mark gets resolved in a way in an unverified way toward in favor of Kris Kobach every reporter who takes that story as real without demanding absolute public verification is a terrible reporter and you should never trust them again by the way you should also not trust them if they just come out and go I'm sure that it was a conspiracy and it's Kovaks fault yeah how would you know right so I don't know how many times you I can see you need actual facts do we have reporters in this country
