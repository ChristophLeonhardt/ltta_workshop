1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
one follow-up on Tom's remarks he said
that the White House will be putting

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,919
together a supplemental do you have a
sense of when you'll submit that to

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,540
Congress and then secondly can you
confirm reports that the president has

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,580
leaning towards or deciding to end daca
and what other ramifications of that for

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,600
the treatment I'll take your the first
question in terms of supplemental

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,980
funding as tom said we're working with
Congress we're not going to get ahead of

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,109
director Mulvaney he is working with
them around the clock to make sure that

8
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,630
process moves forward quickly and
effectively in terms of daca echoing

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,680
again on what Tom said earlier final
decision on that front has not been made

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,280
and when it is we will certainly inform
everybody in this room

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,700
Cecilia's I think in January the
president said the dreamers shouldn't be

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,300
worried so can you stand here today and
say dreamers should not be worried once

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,079
again we have a final decision this is
under review there are a lot of

14
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,800
components that need to be looked at and
once a decision is made we will

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,579
certainly let you guys know Glenn sure
that there's a specific report out by

16
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,250
Fox that talks about that since
essentially a decision is made to

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,850
roll back the program by the end of this
week and that there will be provisions

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,750
allowing dreamers were in the country
right now to stay until their work

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,610
authorization expired are you
specifically denying that report no

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,289
offense to your colleague from Fox News
but I think I'm a little bit better

21
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,979
informed than they are in terms of when
the White House has made a decision and

22
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,390
as I just said a moment ago it has not
been finalized and when it is we will

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,939
certainly let you know palette few
questions

24
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,700
I'm glad can you at least talk about the
timeline there you've got these dates

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,599
and set September 5th is when they will
begin to do this court action that's

26
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,319
obviously Tuesday after Labor Day
so does that mean that some decision

27
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,170
will be coming down tomorrow before the
holiday weekend can you at least talk

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,379
about the timeline for this those folks
who are wondering what their status is

29
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,379
going to be here again I'm not going to
get ahead of something and be

30
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,489
presumptuous when a decision hasn't been
made we don't know when the final review

31
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,840
is going to be completed so it would be
disingenuous for me to create a false

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,250
timeline that simply just is workable
and is not you guys there are a lot of

33
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,359
conversations around the timeline and
when that has to be made and again that

34
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:18,900
hasn't been fully reviewed and vetted
and decided it's Mark Harvey Sarah

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,660
there's obviously been a huge outpouring
of support for people all around the

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,500
country the victims Harvey you see
people lining up volunteer you've seen

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,010
people donating tens of millions of
dollars can you speak to the president

38
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,290
his family have done regarding donation
for RT relief personally yes I can I had

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,680
a chance to speak directly with the
president earlier and I'm happy to tell

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,780
you that he is would like to join in the
efforts that a lot of the people that

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,530
we've seen across this country do and
he's pledging a million dollars of

42
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,480
personal money to the fund and he's
actually asked that I check with the

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,329
folks in this room since you are very
good at research and have been doing a

44
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,489
lot of reporting in to the groups and
organizations that have best and most

45
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,510
effective in helping and providing aid
and he'd love some suggestions from the

46
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,349
folks here and I'd be happy to take
those if any of you have them that as I

47
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,519
said he'll pledge proudly a million
dollars of his own personal money to

48
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,140
help the people at both Texas and
Louisiana

49
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,040
the president said that he may return
detective and may also go to Louisiana

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,630
over the weekend do you have an update
on the president's travel schedule we

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,170
know that vice president Mike Pence is
there today if the president is going

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,180
where my ego and will he meet with the
back of these lodges there the president

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,140
and the first lady will be traveling
both to Texas and Louisiana on Saturday

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,150
the specific cities and locations are
being finalized hopefully we'll have

55
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,890
that information for you later today I
believe as of right now tentatively he

56
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,590
plans to be in the Houston area of Texas
and possibly Lake Charles Louisiana but

57
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,880
again you know varying on conditions
that may change a little bit that was

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,360
that's a tentative plan makes point on
taxes before a move on a phone yesterday

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,070
the president went to Missouri to push
for tax reform he has said the

60
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,010
administration has said that they'd like
to see a bill before the House of

61
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,100
Representatives in September but there's
differences between where the

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,010
administration is and where House GOP
leaders are do you still expect that to

63
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:28,060
happen in September as we as we said
before this is going to be a big

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,320
priority for the administration
certainly moving through the fall the

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,100
biggest part is that we make sure that
we get it right and that we provide tax

66
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,000
relief to middle-class America and that
we help Americans across the board

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,240
that's the goal and if we can do that by
September that would be great like

68
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,570
president hitting the road yesterday he
made it seem as if this should be a

69
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,130
simple bipartisan fixed however
Democrats are saying that there should

70
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,700
not be tax relief for those who are the
wealthiest 1%

71
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,580
garners does the president believe you
that the wealthiest 1% deserve taxes the

72
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,780
president laid out clearly what his big
priorities were yesterday I'll be glad

73
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,580
to repeat those permanently reducing tax
rates encouraging entrepreneurs to

74
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,290
invest simplifying the process
incentivizing American companies to

75
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,920
bring back jobs and profits the
president is focused on helping all

76
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,670
Americans across the board the biggest
priority he has is on helping

77
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,540
middle-class Americans and making sure
more of those people keep more of their

78
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,950
money the White House think working with
Democrats on this is reasonable or

79
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,030
likely I mean they're already laying
down the marker for where they stand you

80
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,810
just said for all Americans presumably
that includes the top one I would love

81
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,140
for Democrats to want to help all
Americans I don't know why they would

82
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,560
ever want to be against that certainly
helping more Americans have more money

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
that they worked hard to earn in their
pocket I don't know anybody that would

84
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,520
want to be against that so hopefully
they they will be reasonable and want to

85
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,860
come to the table I have a tax reform
question but first just quickly about

86
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,790
that charitable donation will that be
coming from Trump personally as opposed

87
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,410
to the from Foundation or the Trump
Organization I know that the president

88
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:15,260
he said he was personally going to give
I don't know the legal part of exactly

89
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,980
that but he said his personal money sort
of assuming that comes directly from tax

90
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,730
reform if I'm a secretary venetians said
earlier that the administration is going

91
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,020
to release a blueprint on tax reform
that will then go to Congress when can

92
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,190
we expect that how much detail will that
go into and how is that is that a change

93
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,110
from letting Congress take the lead on
actually drafting legislation as both

94
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,920
members of the administration the
president said our job is to lay out the

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,120
core principles the primary pillars that
we want to see in tax reform its

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,380
Congress's job to legislate so we want
to work through that process and allow

97
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,160
them to actually do their jobs we're
going to do our jobs and lead the

98
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,660
conversation set the table set the
priorities and let them do their job and

99
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,729
legislate get it passed so the president
can sign it John Decker see

100
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,689
I think we've already been laying out a
lot of those principles that's the

101
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,370
foundation and we'll continue to add to
that

102
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,809
Johnson is this push for tax reform the
priority for the president and the

103
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,099
administration right now have you put
the repeal and replace effort to the

104
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:24,339
side for the moment the focus
exclusively on your tax reform proposals

105
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:28,120
as the white house I don't think you
ever get to exclusively focus on only

106
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,439
one issue it's certainly one of the top
priorities for the administration moving

107
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:36,249
into the fall but as we've said many
times before we can walk and chew gum at

108
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:40,120
the same time and we plan to push
through a lot of different things

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,719
throughout the fall
John the one thing again Sarah if I may

110
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:49,629
on the qilin replace as you know you
receive no Democratic support in either

111
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:55,779
the house or the Senate as far as tax
reform is concerned are you expecting a

112
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:01,120
different result do you think you can
get Democrats to support some sort of

113
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,069
legislation that comes more from both
houses of Congress as I said a minute

114
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,999
ago I would certainly hope so I don't
know why any Democrat would be against

115
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:14,409
wanting to provide tax relief for
hardworking Americans particularly those

116
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:20,259
in the middle class I think it would be
very sad in a big mistake son Gizzi and

117
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:28,959
thank you Sarah just one question
just one just one politics the president

118
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,568
gave a very strong endorsement through
Twitter of Senator Luther strange in his

119
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:39,789
bid for nomination
in the special election the runoff is

120
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,340
coming up in September 26 if there have
been published reports that the

121
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,490
president is backing away from that
endorsement and not taking sides which

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,070
would make him the first Republican
president in 47 years not to back an

123
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:06,370
incumbent senator for another term is he
as committed to Senator strange or has

124
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:13,810
his position changed since the original
primary due to the legal restrictions

125
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,370
that I have I cannot answer anything
political from the podium so I have to

126
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:26,890
leave that to outside folks and the
president himself to answer that today

127
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,170
in an interview said fast about plants
books at Tubman and tomato

128
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:38,290
he's big answer during the campaign the
president called this few liberal

129
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,300
correctness in the administration
reversing the science to change I'm not

130
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,420
aware of any policy change certainly
have to check into that Peter sorry I

131
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,709
promised I'd come back spent on daca in
February the president said he would

132
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,329
treat dreamers with heart the president
stand by his statement to treat dreamers

133
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:04,029
with heart absolutely the president
stands by his statement right now this

134
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,769
is currently under review both from a
legal standpoint primarily and until

135
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,160
that review is complete again as I
answered before we don't have anything

136
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,519
to add further on that would run
anything daca be treating dreamers with

137
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,459
again I'm not going to get into a back
and forth until a decisions been made

138
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,970
electronically to reach out let me kind
of take a minute I probably right after

139
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,899
right after chat that I shifting to
Russia for a moment the decision to

140
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:31,240
announce tempting there for you the
alien alkmaar they by the State

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,350
Department on closing for you facilities
in this long tit for tat that has been

142
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,190
going on with Russia a lot of analysts
now say that relations between the US

143
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,120
and Russia are at the lowest point since
the Cold War do you agree with that and

144
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,100
if so whose fault is it look right now
we're requiring the Russian government

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,990
to close its Consulate General in San
Francisco a trade annex in Washington DC

146
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,430
in a trade annex in New York City these
closures have to be completed by the

147
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,480
September 2nd we've taken a firm and
measured action in response to Russia's

148
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,680
unfortunate decision earlier this year
we want to hop the downward spiral

149
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,610
spiral and we want to move forward to
towards better relations

150
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,890
we'll look for opportunities to do that
but we also want to have equity in the

151
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,160
decisions and anything beyond that
anything beyond that I would refer you

152
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,900
to the State Department which is where
solutions

153
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,779
/ or at least in decades I don't think
so human determined to improve relations

154
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,720
with Russia
we're going to look for opportunities to

155
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,500
do that but we're also going to make
sure that we make decisions that are

156
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,920
best for our country my god Sarah Thanks
senators Grassley and Grande revealed

157
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,010
today that they have evidence suggesting
that former FBI director Comey made a

158
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,980
decision to not charge Hillary Clinton
several months before the investigation

159
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,930
actually wrapped up and before they
interviewed Hillary Clinton does

160
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,410
president know about this and does he
believe that that adds weight to his

161
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:07,550
decision to fire from I'm not sure if he
is aware of that revelation but if it is

162
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,350
as accurate as they say it is I think
that would certainly give calls and

163
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,940
reason that Jim Comey was not the right
person to lead the FBI and hopefully all

164
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,370
of your colleagues will follow suit and
covering that story Zeke correctamundo

165
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,790
Frick mr. president to play that imagine
court press was one of those

166
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,920
specifically the effects of whatever the
tax plan is on the budget has the White

167
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,000
House statement along position on
whether the tax plan needs to be revenue

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,519
neutral or is the White House willing to
accept attack fund that would

169
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,459
that would essentially raise the deficit
the president talked a lot about the

170
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:46,609
deficits over the course of this
campaign the White House so is he laying

171
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:50,299
down the market and not at this time I
don't have any further announcement on

172
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:57,739
that front Fred oh thanks sir a couple
questions on Obamacare that there some

173
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:02,689
some governor's today came out in favor
of sustainability approach been talked

174
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:06,919
about of money and some folks in the
Senate would ask you a wooded

175
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,229
ministration outright opposed to the
type of Obamacare bailout for insurance

176
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:16,489
companies I can't imagine that it would
be something we would want to be

177
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:20,179
involved in but I would have to refer
you to HHS specifically on that on that

178
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:28,279
question and secondly the president
tweeted reliably but uh talk about

179
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,399
taking away the Obamacare exception
remember the Congress staff is there

180
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,519
anything to stop them from taking an
action now something that could be done

181
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,639
executive Li is that I cannot I think
that's something he is certainly still

182
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:54,499
considering out policy he went said on
that last week saudi-led coalition and

183
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:59,179
gammon killed 42 civilians as the
Predators the president concerned about

184
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:04,220
the humanitarian situation yet something
that we're certainly keeping an eye on

185
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,409
and I would refer you back to them for
anything further at this point the

186
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:13,159
kalidahs are saying today that the Emir
will be here next week to meet in Fresno

187
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:17,720
just wanting to confirm that and then on
the Russia diplomatic move did president

188
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,600
initiate this this was a decision made
by the president yes and on the quiz I'm

189
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,259
not ready to make an announcement on
that I'll have to check on the specifics

190
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,409
of that

191
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,990
individual interaction is certainly
among them but it's in goshi ating still

192
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:44,190
opportunist absolutely all includes all
so I think that would certainly include

193
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:49,120
diplomatic economic and military options
ones they follow up just as we are

194
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,450
getting closer to Friday can you tell us
whether the presidential in confidence

195
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,820
in Yuriko yes the president is working
hand-in-hand with Gary and the rest of

196
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,680
his team on tax reform as I've said
several times earlier today that's a big

197
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,510
priority for the administration moving
into the fall and Gary is an integral

198
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:13,540
member of the team leading that effort
April yellow replaces this president is

199
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,420
so dead set on trying to make sure that
people place his own fields Obama care

200
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,230
what's happening with the website is
there still active enrollment you on

201
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,450
that website as far as I know I'm not
aware of any reason that it's not but

202
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,560
I'd have to certainly check into that
I'm not checking into the Obama care

203
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,130
website daily so I'd have to look into
that you're not actively encouraging

204
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,630
people you're moreso saying repealing
the place I think that everybody in the

205
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,530
country knows that Obamacare is
collapsing and that something still

206
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,330
needs to be done and the administration
is still very much committed to putting

207
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,050
a health care system in place that
actually works because we know Obamacare

208
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,710
doesn't it's not sustainable so yes
we're continuing to move forward and

209
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,750
look for ways to help all Americans
receive better care HBCU conference on

210
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,020
is it possible I asked
hi mom can you give us the list because

211
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,800
we're still hearing more and more from
other colleges and universities in the

212
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,700
HBCU community we're standing there
absolutely not coming and you say it's

213
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,540
at capacity and you have a waiting list
is there any way that you can share some

214
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,470
of those names yeah I think this the
Department of Education is housing that

215
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,060
again I will try to look into that I
meant to do that last week thanks so

216
00:16:26,060 --> 00:00:00,000
much guys happy ok great
