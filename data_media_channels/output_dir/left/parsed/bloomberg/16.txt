I'm Kim Bhasin, Luxury
Reporter at Bloomberg,
here to invite you into
the most exclusive realms
of luxury retail.
This is Invitation Only.
Today, I'm on 5th Avenue,
smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.
This place is a luxury playground.
You got Bergdorf Goodman,
Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada,
Omega, Dolce & Gabbana,
Armani, Harry Winston.
And the reason I'm here today
to see the most famous
jewelry store in the world:
Tiffany.
The main floor of
Tiffany is great and all,
but that's not why I'm here.
I've come to check out
their super secret salon.
A private area for their
fanciest clientele.
Hi, Kim.
Hello!
Welcome to the Tiffany
salon. Good to see you.
So, here we are, up on the
mezzanine of the New York store.
We developed this area really
for our very best customers
to show wonderful jewelry.
We can work with them on
incredible custom designs.
Are there items available
up here that you can't get
down on the main floor?
Yes, there are.
We have a specifically
curated assortment up here.
This is a brand new
collection we've just launched
called Paper Flowers.
And this is a combination
of using platinum, diamonds,
and tanzanites.
But the tanzanites are
all gradated colors.
So, it gives this lovely
three-dimensionality to it.
These are rare
fancy-colored diamonds, Kim.
A lot of people think that
diamonds, it's all to do with
colorless or lack of color.
But this is at the other
end of the spectrum.
You have a rainbow of colors
that are the rarest of the rare.
Oh my goodness.
That diamond is enormous!
It's incredible.
This is a 28-carat.
28?
28.
That's hefty.
It's a hefty diamond.
It's a D color. The very, very top grade.
And internally flawless.
Absolutely no inclusions, incredibly pure.
How much would something
like that run for?
This one is a little over
four million dollars.
Eh, alright.
Can I try that on?
Oh, absolutely!
You have to try it on.
It's quite incredible.
It fits you perfectly.
Yeah, right.
And look at the beauty of the cut.
The sparkle, the radiance, the brilliance,
the purity of it, the transparency of it.
For a nice affordable
four million dollars.
Exactly.
Great.
Why do you like gemstones so much?
It's awesome and shiny?
Or, like, what's the deal?
Oh no, I mean, gemstones are incredible.
There's so many varieties.
There's so many differentials.
To this day, I find things and see things
that really blow my mind,
because you can't imagine
that mother nature can make
such extraordinary things.
We have a wonderful Tiffany
workshop here on the 10th floor,
which many people don't realize.
There, our finest high jewelry is made.
These are all completely handmade pieces
from beginning to end.
Many of the pieces you
see in the salon here
will be made at the Tiffany workshop.
There are various
experiences in this store
that aren't just going up to a counter
and picking something out and buying it.
Yeah.
Why is that important for a retailer?
Incredibly important these days.
I mean, as we all know, so
much shopping is done online.
Customers can come in here
and they can walk around
and they can experience many things.
They can buy something, they
can dream about something.
But while they're here,
there's places to relax.
The Blue Box Cafe to
have something to eat.
So, you can really spend the day here.
That's really important,
because it's a wonderful experience.
