00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:29,159
ERDOGAN, WE HAVE BEEN DEALING

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,828
AND UNTIL THIS WE HAD A GOOD

42
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:31,762
RELATIONSHIP, I WAS SURPRISED

43
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,931
THAT WE DIDN'T WORK THIS OUT A

44
00:01:33,932 --> 00:01:36,667
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, BUT IT

45
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:37,434
STARTED IN A DIFFERENT

46
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:38,335
ADMINISTRATION AND THEY WERE NOT

47
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:41,071
GOING TO WORK OUT ANYTHING AND

00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:44,908
WE TOOK IT OVER AND INHERIT IT

49
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:46,276

CHAIRMAN KIM WAS REALLY GREAT TO

00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,055

55
00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,356
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE NOW IN

56
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:03,093

00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:08,699

THE PRESIDENT, THE SPIRIT OF

00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:25,883
WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING, THE

200
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:30,321

>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

204
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:37,328
COULD I ASK YOU ONE QUESTION?

205
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:38,529
>> YEAH.

206
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,965
>> WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?

207
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:41,398
[LAUGHTER]

208
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,733
>> I KNEW THE ANSWER.

209
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,568
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I

210
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:50,007
SENT ABSENTEE BALLOT FROM

211
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:50,341
PRISON.

212
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:51,408
[LAUGHTER]

213
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,409
>> IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR.

214
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,445
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO MYSELF.

215
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:55,846
THAT COULD BE TOO TOUGH.

216
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:57,281
LISTEN, CONGRATULATIONS.

217
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,482

FANTASTIC CHILDREN THAT ARE

00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,467
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP, WE HAVE HAD

230
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,636
A VERY HARSH RELATIONSHIP OVER

00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:19,837
THE PAST NUMBER OF MONTHS

232
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:22,306
BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

233
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:23,507
AND I'M NOT GOING TO BLAME

234
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,042

ANYTHING, I'M SAYING THIS IS A

00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,546
TREMENDOUS STEP TOWARD HAVING

00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,463
QUESTIONS?

00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:47,531
WOULD YOU LIKE --

WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING ON DOING

250
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,669
NOW THAT YOU ARE BACK SAFELY?

251
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,403
>> WE WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH

252
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:53,838
OUR CHILDREN ESPECIALLY AND THAT

253
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,874
TAKES SOME TIME TO PRAY AND SEE

254
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,376
WHAT GOD WANTS FOR THE NEXT PART

255
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:03,814
OF OUR LIVES.

258
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:08,586
WHILE YOU WERE DETAINED?

259
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:09,320
>> I THINK WE WILL DO THAT IN

260
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,021
THE FUTURE, WE WILL PROBABLY BE

261
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:13,090
DOING INTERVIEWS.

262
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:14,859

GRATEFULLNESS TO SAY WE LOVE THE

COUNTRY.

269
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:33,110
WE ARRIVED IN GERMANY ON A PLANE

270
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,011
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT TO

271
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:36,614
TAKE US TO TURKEY, AMBASSADOR

272
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:38,883
MET US THERE AT 1:30 IN THE

273
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,417
MORNING AND HE HAD AN AMERICAN

274
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:42,453
FLAG TO GIVE US THAT HAD FLOWN

275
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:46,157
IN BERLIN AND I TOOK IT AND VERY

276
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:49,994
NATURALLY KISSED IT.

277
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:50,728
I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND WE PRAY

278
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:56,333
FOR THIS COUNTRY.

[INAUDIBLE]

280
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,105

281
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,640
DISAPPEARANCE AND POSSIBLE

282
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,008
MURDER OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI HAD

283
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:06,377
ANYTHING --

284
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:08,546
>> TIMING IS COINCIDENCE.

285
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,280
I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF PEOPLE

286
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:11,348
SAY, WELL, IT'S PRETTY TRICKY,

287
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,984
COULD THERE BE ANYTHING TO IT,

288
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:16,954
NO, IT'S A TOTAL COINCIDENCE.

289
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:18,389
IT'S INTERESTING, A LOT OF

290
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,090
THINGS HAPPENING IN A CERTAIN

291
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:21,625
PART OF THE WORLD, YOU KNOW

292
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:22,760
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS

293
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:24,361
GOING ON BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY

294
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,497
THINGS BEYOND THAT BUT NO, IT'S

295
00:10:26,498 --> 00:10:29,733
STRICT COINCIDENCE, BILL.

296
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,935
[INAUDIBLE]

297
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,137
>> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP --

298
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,638
>> I HAVE A FEELING I KNOW WHAT

299
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,274
HE'S GOING TO BE.

300
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,144
WAIT, WAIT.

301
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,078
[INAUDIBLE]

302
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,546
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

303
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:46,016
THAT'S RIGHT.

304
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:49,620
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

305
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,988
>> WE WILL BE SITTING TOGETHER

306
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,290
WITH FOLKS HERE AND MAKE A

307
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,425
DETERMINATION.

308
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:55,759
I WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THE

309
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,329
ORDER FOR THE MILITARY

310
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,296
$110 BILLION, I BELIEVE IT'S THE

311
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:03,267
LARGEST ORDER EVER MADE.

312
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,702
IT'S 450,000 JOBS.

313
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:05,869
IT'S THE BEST EQUIPMENT IN THE

314
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,838
WORLD, BUT IF THEY DON'T BUY IT

315
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,373
FROM US, THEY ARE GOING TO BUY

316
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:10,908
IT FROM RUSSIA OR THEY WILL BUY

317
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,443
IT FROM CHINA OR THEY ARE GOING

318
00:11:12,444 --> 00:11:14,311
TO BUY IT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

319
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,680
BUT RUSSIA AND CHINA WANTED IT

320
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,950
VERY BADLY, I GOT 10%, ALMOST

321
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:21,619
10% OF THE ORDER AND I WOULD

322
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,221
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF JOBS,

323
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,723
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, A LOT OF

324
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,458
OTHER REASONS, I WOULD LIKE TO

325
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,695
DO SOMETHING WHERE WE COULD

326
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,264
MAYBE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS, I

327
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,866
WILL TELL THE SENATORS,

328
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,067
TREMENDOUS ORDER FOR THE

329
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:39,970
COMPANIES, IT'S A TREMENDOUS

330
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:43,173
ORDER FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

331
00:11:43,174 --> 00:11:45,009
STANDPOINT, YOU LOOK AT TEXAS,

332
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,744
HAS BIG CHUNK OF IT, ALMOST ALL

333
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:48,312
OF OUR STATES ARE INVOLVED IN

334
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:49,680
THAT ORDER.

335
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,115
I ACTUALLY THINK WE WOULD BE

336
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,650
PUNISHING OURSELVES IF WE DID

337
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:53,550
THAT.

338
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,351
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE COULD

339
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,487
DO THAT ARE POWERFUL AND STRONG

340
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,422
AND WE WILL DO IT.

341
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:00,391
AS OF THIS MOMENT NOBODY KNOWS

342
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:01,925
WHAT HAPPENED.

343
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:02,626
AS OF THIS MOMENT, WE ARE

344
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:10,835
LOOKING INTOJamieCmcs5195

345
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:14,405
THEY WILL GET BACK AND I KNOW

346
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:15,439
MIKE HAS BEEN DEALING WITH

347
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,941
THEM, JOHN HAS BEEN DEALING

348
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:18,942
WITH THEM.

349
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:23,881
IN TERMS OF THE ORDER OF 110

350
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,182
BILLION DOLLARS, ALL THEY WILL

351
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:25,783
DO IS GIVE IT TO OTHER

352
00:12:25,784 --> 00:12:29,286
COUNTRIES AND I THINK THAT

353
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,021
WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH OF OUR

354
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:31,855
COUNTRY BUT THERE ARE OTHER

355
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:32,589
THINGS WE CAN DO THAT WILL BE

356
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,929
--

357
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,100
>> THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE CAN

358
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:43,367
DO.

359
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,537
THERE ARE MANY THINGS.

360
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:51,008
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL THEM

361
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:51,742
SOME OF THE MANY THINGS WE

362
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:54,211
COULD DO THERE IS A BIG LIST.

363
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:57,281
>> YES THERE IS A LONG LIST WE

364
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,016
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SAUDI

365
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,552
ARABIA BUT MY PREFERENCE IS NOT

366
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:03,020
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO LET'S

367
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:07,024
FIND OUT WHAT DID HAPPEN FIRST.

368
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,158
AND HIS FIANCCE STILL WAITING

369
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,792
TO FIND WHAT HAPPENS AND

370
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:09,760
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION

371
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,028
BUT UNTIL WE KNOW I HATE TO

372
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:19,036
TAKE THE NEXT STEP --

373
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:19,803
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

374
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:23,006
