1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,590
A FEDERAL COURT HAS RULED
AGAINST AN OBAMA ERA REGULATION

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,050
THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY KEEP A
CLOSE EYE ON FINANCIAL ANALYSTS

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,889
AND ENSURE THAT THEY SELL
PRODUCTS THAT KEEP THE BEST

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:15,870
INTERESTS OF THE CONSUMER IN
MIND.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,589
THESE ARE NONFIDUCIARIES,

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,179
INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY
PARTICULAR CREDENTIALS TO BE

7
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:26,640
SELLING THESE PRODUCTS, BUT THEY
ARE SALESPEOPLE WHO HAVE TITLES

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,009
SUCH AS FINANCIAL ANALYST,
FINANCIAL ADVISOR, FINANCIAL

9
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,740
CONSULTANT, FINANCIAL PLANNER,
INVESTMENT CONSULTANT, AND THEY

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,710
PREVIOUSLY, PRIOR TO THESE OBAMA
ERA REGULATIONS, HAD NO

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,250
OBLIGATION, NO LEGAL OBLIGATION,
TO SELL YOU PRODUCTS WITH YOUR

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,500
BEST INTERESTS IN MIND.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,510
IN FACT
OFTEN TIMES THEY WOULD SELL

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,970
RETIREMENT PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS
THAT WOULD NOT HELP THEM, BUT

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,470
WOULD GIVE THEM COMMISSION AND
ALSO GIVE THEM OTHER FINANCIAL

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,670
INCENTIVES TO SELL THOSE
PRODUCTS.

17
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,400
NOW IN 2016 OBAMA'S

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,339
ADMINISTRATION DID IMPLEMENT
SOME REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT

19
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,399
THESE INDIVIDUALS WORKED IN YOUR
BEST INTERESTS, AND TODAY, I'M

20
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,670
SORRY, YESTERDAY, A FEDERAL
COURT DECIDED TO RULE AGAINST

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,670
THOSE REGULATIONS.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,819
NOW LET ME
GIVE YOU THOSE DETAILS --

23
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:39,250
I JUST WANT TO PAUSE, ANA,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS SO

24
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,609
IMPORTANT.

25
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,219
THAT GOES TO THE
HEART OF NOT JUST THIS CASE AND

26
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,869
THIS ISSUE BUT THE HEART OF THE
PROBLEM IN OUR GOVERNMENT.

27
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:46,869
IT

28
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,310
WAS TWO JUDGES APPOINTED BY
REPUBLICANS, AND HENCE THE

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,570
CORRUPTING OF THE JUDICIARY.

30
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,619
IT'S NOT THAT REPUBLICANS CAN'T

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,670
APPOINT JUDGES, OF COURSE THEY
CAN, BUT THEY ARE SELECTING

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,149
JUDGES THAT ARE ONLY
PRO-CORPORATE.

33
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,149
IN FACT NEIL

34
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,719
GORSUCH GOT THE SUPREME COURT
NOMINATION BECAUSE HE WAS THE

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,780
ONLY JUDGE IN THE COUNTRY THAT
RULED THAT A CORPORATION HAS THE

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,130
RIGHT TO ORDER ONE OF THEIR
WORKERS TO FREEZE TO DEATH, AND

37
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,880
THEN FIRE HIM IF HE DISREGARDS
THAT ORDER.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,220
THAT'S AN AMAZING

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,220
RULING.

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,960
EVERY OTHER JUDGE WHO
LOOKED AT THAT CASE SAID NO, BUT

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,120
THAT WAS GORSUCH'S WAY OF SAYING
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,990
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND
THAT GAVE HIM THE SUPREME COURT

43
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,990
SEAT.

44
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,600
SO WE PRESELECTED JUDGES
TO MAKE RULINGS LIKE THIS.

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
SO

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,390
THEY RULED IT IS UNREASONABLE TO
EXPECT THAT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

47
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,220
WOULD HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS
IN MIND.

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,280
THE REASONABLE POSITION

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,060
WOULD BE FOR THEM TO ROB YOU
BLIND.

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,860
SO FOR THEM TO CARE ABOUT

51
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,910
YOU, THEIR CUSTOMER OR THEIR
CLIENT, AND FOR THE GOVERNMENT

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,130
TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS, IS
TOTALLY UNREASONABLE.

53
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,130
AND THAT

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,290
IS THE CORPORATE POSITION, IT'S
UNREASONABLE FOR US TO SACRIFICE

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,300
EVEN A PENNY OF OUR PROFITS TO
LOOK OUT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,830
OR CLIENTS.

57
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,130
LET'S HEAR FROM THE JUDGES WHO
RULED AGAINST THE REGULATIONS,

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,050
ONE OF THEM WAS JUDGE EDITH
JONES, WHO WAS NOMINATED BY

59
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:31,950
RONALD REAGAN, HERE IS WHAT
JUDGE JONES HAD TO SAY --

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,040
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT
ATTEMPT AT LOGIC BECAUSE THERE

61
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
WAS NO LOGIC THERE.

62
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,910
THESE ARE
PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY, PRIOR TO

63
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,290
THESE REGULATIONS, DIDN'T HAVE
TO DISCLOSE CONFLICT OF INTEREST

64
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,070
WHEN SELLING CERTAIN RETIREMENT
PRODUCTS, AND PUSHING FOR

65
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,420
CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, WHICH BY
THE WAY IN A LOT OF CASES THESE

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,950
INVESTMENTS WOULD WORK AGAINST
THEIR CLIENT, IT WOULD ACTUALLY

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,350
DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY
THEY WOULD HAVE IN THE LONG RUN

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,740
FOR THEIR RETIREMENT, BUT THEY
DIDN'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE THE

69
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,530
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR THE
INCENTIVES THEY WERE GIVEN TO

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,170
SELL THOSE TERRIBLE PRODUCTS TO
THESE CONSUMERS.

71
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,170
AND ALSO THEY

72
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,250
WOULD CHARGE FEES, AND THE
REGULATION ESSENTIALLY TOOK CARE

73
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,880
OF, OR PREVENTED THEM, FROM
CHARGING CERTAIN FEES THAT AGAIN

74
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,279
IN THE LONG RUN WOULD AMOUNT TO
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT, THAT YOU

75
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,160
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH
AS MUCH AS YOU COULD HAD YOU

76
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,820
KNOWN WHAT WAS AT PLAY BEHIND
THE SCENES.

77
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,600
SO IT WAS PROVIDING

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,670
OVERSIGHT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY
IT WAS PROVIDING INFORMATION TO

79
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,810
THE CONSUMER SO YOU KNEW WHAT
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WERE AT

80
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,480
PLAY AND THE TYPES OF FEES
YOU WERE BEING CHARGED.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,130
SO THIS IS CRAZY.

82
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,380
I KEEP THINKING THE WHOLE
POINT OF GOVERNMENT IS TO

83
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,760
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE
DUPLICITOUS -- THIS ISN'T JUST

84
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,139
DUPLICITOUS, IT'S CRIMINAL, IT'S
THE POTENTIAL TO SORT OF GRIFT

85
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,139
--

86
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,139
BUT EVEN IF IT'S JUST
DUPLICITOUS --

87
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:05,030
MY PARENTS WERE BOTH DOCTORS,
IF A DOCTOR COULD BE LIKE I'M

88
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,500
GOING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT KILL YOU AND NOT TELL YOU

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,710
THAT IF IT WILL MAKE THE
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY A LOT OF

90
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,050
PROFIT -- WELL, THAT'S KIND OF
HAPPENING.

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,320
WE USED TO HAVE A LOT OF LAWS
PERTAINING TO CONSUMERS, LIKE A

92
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,610
LEMON LAW, A CAR SALESMAN
COULDN'T SELL YOU A CAR THAT HE

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,260
KNEW DIDN'T FUNCTION.

94
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,550
AND THAT'S
JUST A CAR.

95
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,550
BUT YOU COULD LOSE

96
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,530
YOUR WHOLE SAVINGS AND CORPORATE
JUDGES VIEW IT AS WHOLLY

97
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,440
UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THEY
TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT IT.

98
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
ONE

99
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,780
OF THE THINGS THEY DO THAT ANA
WAS REFERRING TO IS EXCESSIVE

100
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:45,000
TRADING, THEY TAKE COMMISSION ON
EACH TRADE, FOREIGN SAMPLE, AND

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,260
EVERY TIME YOU LOSE THAT MONEY
AND THEY GAIN THAT MONEY.

102
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
SO

103
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,170
THEY HAVE RIGGED THAT SYSTEM SO
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

104
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,940
THANK YOU FOR INVESTING FOR US,
WE NOW HAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOU

105
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,699
DON'T. NOT THE WHOLE PRINCIPAL,
A OBVIOUSLY, BUT IT'S A WAY OF

106
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,100
MILKING YOU FOR THEIR PROFIT
WITHOUT TELLING YOU. AND IF WE

107
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,810
CAN HAVE A LEMON LAW ABOUT CARS
YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE IT ABOUT

108
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,430
YOUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND
YOUR ENTIRE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

109
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,340
THING ABOUT WHO THEY PREY ON.

110
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,940
THEY PREY ON RETIREES.

111
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,210
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,390
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST
VULNERABLE, IN SOME CASES MOST

113
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,440
GULLIBLE BECAUSE THEY AREN'T AS
COMFORTABLE WITH THESE THINGS,

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,750
I'M GENERALIZING BUT THAT'S
TRUE, ONE THING TO POINT OUT,

115
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,810
ANA, BEFORE YOU GO ON, IS THIS
IS THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, IT'S A 2-1

116
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,090
DECISION, EARLIER THIS WEEK THEY
GAVE ANOTHER 2-1 DECISION IN

117
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,870
FAVOR OF TEXAS AGAINST SANCTUARY
CITIES.

118
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,120
SO YOU AREN'T IN THE

119
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,770
NINTH DISTRICT ANYMORE, YOU
AREN'T IN THIS FAVORABLE COURT,

120
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,180
BUT THESE ARE BOTH 2-1
DECISIONS.

121
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
IN THE SANCTUARY

122
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,580
CITIES CASE IN TEXAS THEY WILL
APPEAL FOR A HEARING WITH ALL

123
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,389
SEVEN MEMBERS, OR NINE MEMBERS,
OF AN APPEALS COURT AND THEY

124
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,820
PROBABLY WILL WANT TO DO THAT IN
THIS CASE AS WELL BECAUSE THIS

125
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,040
IS WHAT YOU HAVE WITH THE
CIRCUIT APPEALS COURTS, WHEN

126
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,550
THEY KNOW THEY CAN GET A GOOD
DECISION THEY GET A SMALLER

127
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,600
NUMBER, THEY GO TO A 2-1.

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,449
TWO THINGS I WANT TO POINT
OUT, ONE IN REGARD TO WHAT CENK

129
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,560
MENTIONED, THE CONSTANT TRADING
IS SOME THING THAT IS PUSHED

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,240
TOWARDS CONSUMERS, THEY ARE
REFERRED TO AS ACTIVE MANAGEMENT

131
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,240
OR ACTIVE FUNDS OR ANNUITIES,
AND THE WHOLE POINT IS SO THEY

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,130
DO CONSTANT TRADING, AND AGAIN
THAT'S WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS

133
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,880
DOING THE TRAINING ON YOUR
BEHALF MAKE MONEY BUT IT DOESN'T

134
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,750
NECESSARILY WORK TOWARD YOUR
BEST INTERESTS, OR IN YOUR BEST

135
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,030
INTERESTS, BECAUSE YOU WILL
LIKELY LOSE MONEY WHEN THERE IS

136
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,330
THAT MUCH ACTIVITY GOING ON.

137
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,060
TO
YOUR POINT, MICHAEL, SOMETHING

138
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,630
INTERESTING DID HAPPEN.

139
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,940
NOW EVEN
THOUGH THIS COURT RULED AGAINST

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,620
THE REGULATIONS, ANOTHER CIRCUIT
COURT ALSO MADE A DECISION ON

141
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,610
THIS REGULATION THAT WAS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, SO THIS IS

142
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,040
LIKELY TO GO TO THE SUPREME
COURT, WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,030
GOOD NEWS CONSIDERING WE HAVE A
CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT

144
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
CURRENTLY.

145
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,340
ANOTHER CIRCUIT COURT
DECISION HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSITE

146
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,060
TRACK, MEANING THE CONTINUING
FIGHT COULD BE HEADED TO THE

147
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,740
SUPREME COURT.

148
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,230
ANOTHER PIECE OF
INFO YOU SHOULD KNOW IS THAT THE

149
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,500
SEC IS TRYING TO DRAFT ITS OWN
VERSION OF REGULATION IN

150
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:36,479
RESPONSE TO THIS --

151
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,219
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE A
VERSION OF THAT REGULATION AT

152
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,020
THE MOMENT, BUT WE'LL SEE HOW
THAT TURNS OUT.

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,560
IN FULL DISCLOSURE, EDITH
JONES, THE JUDGE, NO RELATION.

154
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,040
SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO RECUSE
YOURSELF.

155
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,540
BECAUSE WE TAKE OUR

156
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,990
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES VERY
SERIOUSLY.

157
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,170
ONE LAST THING, THOSE

158
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,120
WORDS SHE USED, EDITH JONES
USED, REALLY STRUCK ME. AND

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,560
AGAIN IT GOES TO THE HEART OF
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM.

160
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,100
SHE DEEMED THE ATTEMPT TO
PROTECT CONSUMERS AS ARBITRARY

161
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,640
AND CAPRICIOUS.

162
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,760
LIKE, ALMOST A
SLAP IN THE FACE, SAYING HOW

163
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,430
DARE YOU TRY TO STAND UP FOR THE
CITIZENS?

164
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,750
NO, THE CORPORATIONS

165
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,170
RULE US ALL AND THEY CAN DO
ANYTHING THEY LIKE, THEY CAN

166
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,190
TRICK YOU, TAKE YOUR MONEY, LIE
