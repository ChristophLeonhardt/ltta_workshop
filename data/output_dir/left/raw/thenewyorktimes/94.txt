1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
This is Buenos Aires.
Hundreds of thousands

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,040
took to the streets
as the Senate prepared

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,490
to vote on a proposed law
to legalize abortion.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,890
Argentines are
starkly divided.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,470
Supporters of the bill wear
green scarves, the color

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,650
of the feminist movement.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,289
Opponents wear blue, the
color of the national flag.

8
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,960
After 16 hours of
deliberations in the Senate,

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,300
the bill was
narrowly rejected.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,860
Still, the fact
that the discussion

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,580
came this far signals a real
shift in public opinion.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,390
Activists like Marta Dillon
say it’s progress that

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,005
cannot be undone.

14
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:10,310
Marta is a leader of
“Ni una menos,”

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,380
a feminist campaign that

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,380
started three years
ago and has grown

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,160
into a nationwide movement.

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,090
Feminist organizations
pushed to legalize abortion,

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,035
and against all odds,
nearly succeeded.

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,770
But Argentina’s overwhelmingly
Catholic and conservative.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,690
Even among people
who are not religious,

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,780
many reject abortion
on moral grounds.

23
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,680
The persistence of the
abortion rights movement

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,340
has forced its opponents,
including church officials,

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,860
to confront an
uncomfortable reality:

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,570
Criminalizing the issue
does not make it disappear.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,760
In the slums of
Buenos Aires,

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Hernan Martín is
helping to start

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,749
maternity houses
for pregnant women

30
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,222
to curb the number
number of abortions

31
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,942
in poor neighborhoods.

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,520
Abortion is illegal here,
except in cases of rape

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,120
or when a pregnancy
threatens a woman’s health.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
According to the government,

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,067
there are nearly 350,000
clandestine abortions per year.

36
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,580
And they are the
principal cause

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,460
of maternal death
in Argentina.

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,210
But many women
still take the risk.

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,370
We met this patient at
a clinic in Buenos Aires.

40
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,130
She was unemployed
with two children when

41
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,110
she got pregnant and
started looking for a way

42
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,790
to have an abortion.

43
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,040
It took her 20 weeks.

44
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,550
The go-to method
for abortion in Argentina

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,580
is misoprostol,
a drug that was

46
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,450
originally developed
to treat stomach ulcers.

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,380
Helping women
access this drug are

48
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,780
so-called socorristas,

49
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,260
or first responders,
like Diana.

50
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,100
Diana is part of
an expansive network

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
of doctors, hospitals
and activists —

52
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,700
some working covertly —

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,500
to help women get around
legal obstacles.

54
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,740
But outside of
metropolitan areas,

55
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,785
it becomes more difficult for
women to access these groups.

56
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,620
We went to Salta, a region
in the northwestern corner

57
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,260
of Argentina, where life
is more traditional.

58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,650
Monica Gelsi worked for
30 years as a gynecologist here

59
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,330
and never once considered
performing an abortion.

60
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,910
Abortion laws
in Latin America

61
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,820
remain some of the most
restrictive in the world.

62
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,830
But the drama
of the vote here

63
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,940
reveals a broader
cultural struggle

64
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,560
unfolding in Argentina

65
00:05:31,560 --> 00:00:00,000
and across the region.
