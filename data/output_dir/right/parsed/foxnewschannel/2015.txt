WITHDRAWS.
IF THE OTHER COUNTRIES PART OF
THIS AGREEMENT REMAIN COMMITTED.
SHANNON.
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM
CALIFORNIA JOHN GARAMENDI MET
WITH JOHN KERRY LAST WEEK TO
DISCUSS THE IRAN DEAL.
HE JOINS US NOW.
THE CONGRESSMAN SITS ON THE ON
SERVICES COMMITTEE.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
>> Shannon: WHAT YOU MAKE OF
THIS CHARACTERIZATION, SAYING
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE -- FORMER
SENATOR AND FORMER SECRETARY
GARY IS DOING NOW, WHAT YOU
THINK YOU MIGHT >> I DON'T THINK
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE ALL.
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE
DEAL AND HOW IT WORKS, WHY IT'S
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S IMPORTANT
NOT ONLY FOR THE OTHER NATIONS
TO KNOW, BUT CERTAINLY FOR US TO
KNOW HERE.
IT'S REALLY A DIVERSION.
THE PRESIDENT IN ABOUT 15 HOURS
FROM NOW IS GOING TO MAKE AN
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DECISION AND
AS IT WAS REPORTED EARLIER HERE
ON YOUR SHOW IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
THAT DECISION CAN JUST TORPEDO
ALL OF THE EFFORTS TO STOP IRAN
FROM BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON,
THAT THEY WILL JUST GO FORWARD.
>> Shannon: OBVIOUSLY THE
ADMINISTRATION SEES IT
DIFFERENTLY.
YOU ACTUALLY SAID IT DOES NEED
SOME CHANGES.
>> THE ACTUAL DEAL IT WAS ABOUT
THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THAT'S WORKING.
THE INTERNATIONAL REVIEW, WHAT
IS GOING ON IN IRAN, THAT'S
TAKING PLACE.
WE ARE QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY
ARE DOING NOTHING RIGHT NOW.
ISRAEL SAID THEY WERE DOING
SOMETHING IN THE PAST YEARS.
THAT'S TRUE.
BUT SINCE THIS DEAL HAS BEEN IN
PLACE, THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER
EFFORT AND IN FACT THEY HAVE
ROLLED BACK -- THEY PUT CONCRETE
INTO THE NUCLEAR REACTOR SO IT
COULDN'T BE USED.
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PIECES
TO THIS.
THE REST OF THE STORY DEALS WITH
WHAT IRAN IS DOING IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
CLEARLY THEY ARE BAD ACTORS.
CLEARLY THEY DO HAVE A BALLISTIC
MISSILE EFFORT UNDERWAY, SO WHY
DON'T WE DO THIS, WHY DON'T WE
KEEP THE DEAL IN PLACE AS IT
EXISTS TODAY AND THEN BUILD ON
IT, USE IT AS A FOUNDATION.
THE NUCLEAR ISSUE, IN PLACE.
NOW THEY CAN BUILD ON THE OTHER
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.
THAT WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE THE
WAY TO GO FORWARD.
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU GET
ADDITIONAL BRIEFINGS ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IRAN BUT
ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT
EVERYBODY HAS FROM ISRAEL TO
PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH THE
DEAL HERE IN THE U.S. IS THE
VERIFICATION PROCESS, THIS IDEA
THAT THEY HAVE 21-24 DAYS --
WHEN THEY WERE APPROACHED ABOUT
AN INSPECTION TO MOVE ON WITH
THAT.
FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE
IAEA, THE AGENCY THAT WATCHES
OVER, SAID THIS, A 24 DAY
ADJUDICATED TIMELINE REDUCES
DETECTION PROBABILITIES EXACTLY
WHERE THE SYSTEM IS WEAKEST,
DETECTING UNDECLARED FACILITIES
AND MATERIALS.
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE A
REAL PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON
IN IRAN?
>> I'M VERY, VERY CONFIDENT.
I'M CONFIDENT FOR SEVERAL
REASONS.
FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU ARE
MESSING AROUND WITH NUCLEAR
MATERIAL YOU LEAVE BEHIND TRACE
ELEMENTS AND THOSE ARE
DETECTABLE.
YOU CAN GET RID OF THEM.
THEY ARE THERE AND THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE HIDDEN.
IF SOMEBODY IS DOING SOMETHING
IN SOME FACILITY WHICH WE HAVE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE IAEA
HAS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT EVERY
FACILITY THAT THEY SUSPECT
SOMETHING IS GOING ON, THAT'S
WHERE THE 25 DAYS.
IF THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING
THERE THEY HAVE LEFT BEHIND
CRITICAL ISOTOPE MARKERS THAT
CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY.
YOU SIMPLY SCAN THOSE.
YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING HERE.
NOW THEY ARE IN VIOLATION.
AND ALL OF THE SANCTIONS HAVE
WHAT ARE KNOWN AS A SNAP BACK.
IF THEY ARE NOT BEING OBEYED, IF
THE -- IF IRAN IS ENGAGED IN
SOME SORT OF NEFARIOUS ACTIVITY,
THE SANCTIONS IMMEDIATELY SNAP
BACK.
LET'S BUILD OFF WHAT WE HAVE.
WE'VE GOT A GOOD START ON A
MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
IRAN WITH A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
THEY WILL NOT HAVE ONE FOR A
LONG, LONG TIME TO COME, AT
LEAST A DECADE, PROBABLY EVEN
LONGER THAN THAT.
>> Shannon: THERE ARE MANY
CRITICS WHO DON'T AGREE WITH
THAT AND ARE VERY SKEPTICAL.
I WANT TO FINISH BY CIRCLING
BACK ON SECRETARY GARY.
IF SPECIAL COUNSEL BOB MUELLER
IS TRULY INTERESTED IN
INVESTIGATING PEOPLE COLLUDING
WITH FOREIGN POWERS, JOHN KERRY
SHOULD BE TARGET NUMBER ONE FOR
SECRETLY MEETING WITH IRAN -- WE
KNOW NOW THAT'S MORE THAN ONE
AND OTHER FOREIGN OFFICIALS IN
RECENT WEEKS TO USURP U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY.
IT GOES ON TO SAY WHAT OTHER
DEEP STATE OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN
WORKING WITH HIM TO SABOTAGE
U.S. FOREIGN INTEREST?
CONGRESS MUST OPEN AN
INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT.
A FAILURE TO DO SO WILL REVEAL
JUST HOW PARTISAN AND CORRUPT
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS
BECOME.
>> THAT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEBODY
THAT HAD AN AGENDA.
I EXPECTED THAT WAS NOT
"THE BOSTON GLOBE" EDITORIAL
BOARD.
IT'S A COLONIST THAT HAS AN
AGENDA.
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
AB THERE IS SOMETHING THERE.
INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALWAYS
APPROPRIATE IF THEY ARE BALANCED
AND IF THEY ARE JUST AND THEY
REALLY GO AFTER THE TRUTH.
THE QUESTION HERE HAPPENS TO BE
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
