I am Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report yeah you know what the secret of good television is never sleep never sleep Stacy apparently the secret to keeping the population happy with the situation at hand the economic situation at hand that is rigged as the Atlantic said as we covered in the last episode is to have Potemkin villages essentially you have a Potemkin regulator in the United Kingdom and you have Potemkin money operating around the world which is called the US dollar standard if we are to believe these headlines today so actually this is from last week and remember we're doing the summer solutions series where we're looking at the big picture items because it is the summer and we're sitting back and relaxing and looking at the bigger stories some guys some black flack jackets with ar-15s coming this way so I just gotta keep keeping note of that okay continue but here's a tweet from last week with Sky News and they said the financial conduct authority says Royal Bank of Scotland senior managers will not be disciplined for misconduct over the treatment of small firms and the banks global restructuring group as the City regulators powers do not apply so apparently the United Kingdom has this regulator called the financial conduct authority and that was established after the financial crisis and they made you know while they were having all those inquiries to distract the population they said oh population voters all those who have basically your taxes have financed the rescue of all these banks and we're gonna keep on looking forward not back about their crimes but we've set up this financial conduct authority to make sure it never happens again well now that it emerged that the taxpayer owned Royal Bank of Scotland grg group did indeed smash-and-grab the assets of a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises across the United Kingdom well now the financial conduct authority says oops are bad we can't do anything we don't have the authority to write this is my love-hate relationship with the United Kingdom on one hand you'll love it because it's so symbolic and fraudulent yeah but you gotta hate it because thousands tens of thousands of people had their lives destroyed by RBS now just to just to review RBS 60,000 businesses were destroyed so that they could run in there grab the assets and sell them to a separate division of the bank at a knockdown smashdown price to have buddies friends of theirs who then marked it up and made quick profits and so this at first was dismissed as a conspiracy theory and the lunatic fringe was they're just not good business people they just don't know how to run a business but dogged pursuit by people like Neil Mitchell on this show many times Kent digging and digging and digging and and to get more and more proof so then it became incontrovertible undeniable mass financial terrorism by Royal Bank of Scotland on its own people in the UK hold on oh yeah yeah yeah and the FCA at that moment presented with overwhelming irrefutable proof says we actually don't cover that that's not in our purview we don't know we we don't see anything go go we don't know so this is what sub is so beautiful this is how this monarchy and the system has stayed in place for a thousand years is they all well my god I'm coming coming unravel on this but this is needs to be put into my pocket so in the FCA what they'll change their name see what happens in the UK is that every time the regulator is caught committing massive fraud they take to cleanse themselves they change their name so actually a bit gone within three months I bet you a million dollars in Bitcoin that the FCA will change the same within three months to try to cover their tracks of this massive okay I'll take that bet okay so you lose I win that money okay but okay the point is that the FCA they were created by the political authorities the people we elect into office they gave them no authority they just establish potemkin regulator to appease the people the the population the voters the taxpayers that bailed out these banks were the equivalent of Kathryn the second they were trying they're these lackeys these bureaucrats these government officials were trying to impress us that they were doing today here in the second yes Empress Catherin so that was the original Potemkin village but here I'm also gonna turn to you mentioned Bitcoin because I'm gonna turn to something that Paul Krugman said here is some shocking stuff that he wrote about why he's against cryptocurrency because he he says like he keeps on being forced to talk about this but he's now joining the fray and he's talking about why he believes that bitcoin is bad transaction costs and tethers why I'm a crypto skeptic because he says if you look at the broad sweep of monetary history there's been a clear direction of change over time namely one of reducing the frictions of doing business and the amount of real resources required to deal with those frictions first they were gold and silver coins which are heavy required lots of security and consumed a lot of resources to produce and then he said ultimately we then adopted fractional reserve banking and then the central banks held the gold and silver and then we got rid of that and we have pure fiat and it's all been frictionless and perfect and that this has been the that is just natural evolution that we wanted a more frictionless sort of money right here comes the money rip this money but so Paul Krugman is saying that this is frictionless money he then goes on to say in that piece that the money is backed by men with guns yes that's what I was going to get into that so here he's saying that the evolution of money and we're gonna get back to that because I don't believe his evolution of money but he also says that you know the reason why bitcoin is a bubble and a real burst is because it's backed by nothing whereas the dollar he says a normal life people don't worry about where the value of green pieces of paper bearing portraits of dead presidents come from we accept dollar notes because of other people will accept dollar no yet the value of a dollar does not come entirely from self-fulfilling expectations ultimately it is backed by the fact that the US government will accept dollars as payment of tax liabilities liabilities is able to enforce because it's a government if you like fiat currencies have underlying value because men with guns say they do and this means he says that their value isn't a bubble that can collapse if people lose faith so on out of control state that is charging you know illegal taxes that came around since in 1913 they're completely dumb taxes were introduced into the 1913 for that with sin taxes obligation okay if you don't use this paper money that's backed by said state a guy with a gun will come and blow your head off and so Paul Krugman describes that is having no friction so yeah I guess of Paul Krugman if a guy showed up at his apartment with a machete and could I set off then it'd be like I was frictionless that that only took two seconds and then okay his head's missing it only took two seconds there's no friction there we got our $20 we got our worthless piece of paper now from Paul Krugman meanwhile bitcoin is an exchange of currency that does not require men with guns that's its primary use case you don't need violence to exchange in Bitcoin like the New York Times columnist is suggesting that only the money is violence this is underwriting all the wars it's just underwriting the Pentagon they take half of our taxes this is terrorism okay so Paul Krugman is saying oh if you're able to exchange back and forth without violence oh I'm against that why is it because that's where your money comes from Paul Krugman are you just a lackey for the war industry oh what a surprise Paul Krugman your kids must be really proud of all the blood that you have on your hands you disgusting Pig anyway what else well I mean I'm gonna tie this together with that first story that we talked about which is the financial conduct authority says that they were created by politicians to create an illusion that there was somehow regulation of the banking sector going on and none of these crimes would happen again but had Paul Krugman what you're seeing there as well is him trying to deny any of the theories of Austrian school so in Austrian school they would say all value is subjective it all comes from the human mind and he's saying no a gun in your face by a SWAT team or the FBI will force you to believe in the dollar again if you lose faith in the US dollar they will knock down your door hold the gun to your head and demand you have believed in the value of the US oh that's what he's saying but if you also read David Graeber history of debt he would have found that it's humans it's people because they have their own minds and thoughts and they and that includes trust and not trusting so what happens when we go to gold it wasn't about friction it was about trust so we would have credit based systems for very long periods of time when things were harmonious and the soldiers and the people believed in the government and they had faith in the government during times of war and conflict it was the mercenaries and the soldiers who didn't believe that their government would be basically good for the credit for them to go across to the Middle East from Rome and go down to Jerusalem and start fighting some other people around the world they wanted gold right so these gold fenders and stuff like that were based on the trust of the people obviously our governments are having it very good with a pure fiat system they love it our government doesn't have to do anything but the people are the ones that chose Bitcoin they're the ones that created Bitcoin the Genesis block of Bitcoin in January 3rd 2009 said Chancellor on brink of second bailout that was referring to the bailout of RBS and these other UK banks so these all go hand in hand that it's all about they have created these Potemkin currencies Potemkin regulators to back their fiat fake system and now it's it's basically they're exposed all all the population sees that it's a fake village they see it there and they're like dudes you're trying to make me believe I'm gonna use Bitcoin and said because I have more faith in that than I have in Paul Krugman's fiat currency we mentioned gold and silver and it relates to war and particularly Roman times are played and silver and that I couldn't pay them silver for they keep the vampire attack the Empire collapsed and they've got into coin clipping and all this other stuff and you mentioned Austrian economics just came after Keynesian economics it was kind of like okay where's the economics going but Paul Krugman is a legacy guy holding on to the Keynesian economics and you know or currency and the dollar intersects nicely in the Iraq war experience here's an illegal war the US and Britain went in they slaughtered half a million innocent Iraqis including children women and to try to extricate themselves from that problem they flew in on a huge cargo plane seven billion dollars paul krugman paper money on pallets to try to pay people off so they wouldn't show that dead bodies don't tell it the American people that we just slaughtered half a million people will put on our own guy in place here and we're gonna try to keep this all hush-hush and while we go to Libya and we depose Gaddafi and turn that into a massive terrorist State we stole this gold right Tony Blair was there like Qaddafi here a goal what you have to do is crooked I'm Teddy Blair I'm foot I'm with the core what's the quartet anyway stay tuned for the second half a whole lot more welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser hey if I say liberty blitzkrieg what do you think of Oh Michel Krieger of course out there in Colorado former Wall Street guy now blogger slash analyst slash all-around good guy Michael welcome back yeah thanks for the intro max great to be back we're kind of pulling apart all the recent themes out there and Jeff Bezos died worth 150 billion after gaining 50 billion in just this year alone the Atlantic magazine recently said that this forced improves the system is rigged now they are finally conceding what we've been saying for a long long time hear your thoughts on this rigged system and are any politicians but Bernie Sanders even talking about this Michael Krieger ok first let's start with Bezos so so as far as Amazon I think one of things people are missing is that it's not just this you know cutesy company where you get free shipping and you know get to stream movies it's it's actually pretty nefarious what they're trying to do they're trying to control the highway for commerce in America and then they can use that leverage to push their own products push other products out it's actually very bad for free markets ultimately if Bezos and Amazon are able to do what they want moreover when you talk about as wealth look I don't care how much money someone has but my issue is Bezos is earning this money on the backs of exploited employees and this these stories are starting to come out more and more lately you know they don't have health care a lot of their employees they they they're urinating in bottles plastic bottles because they don't get long enough time for bathroom breaks the other thing recently this was a great expose in the inter and intercept talking about how Amazon employees so many of them are on food stamps if you look at states where food stamp usage is high Amazon is in the top ten in a lot of places they are so Amazon Works post both ways then you know they're based and soon you're gonna be allowed to use a you know food stamps to buy stuff from Amazon and so it's you know Amazon's taking advantage of the public purse in a big way and its employees so I'm not a big fan of Bezos and I'm not a big fan of Amazon I think they're they're essentially modern-day robber barons which is to what you said about the rigged economy and yeah that's the sad part you know we're not even talking about this that much you know we're talking about Russia gate and the that's intentional right I mean I remember wasn't too long ago and people were there was Hugh and outcry over the Nets that Foxconn was erecting around the Apple factories in China because people were jumping to their death and they needed them back in the factory to assemble iPhones but this is similar he made base Bezos work conditions are now bordering on that kind of exploitation and and again nobody is saying anything at this time I guess because most of Congress actually own stock and a lot of them own Amazon stock so they're completely conflicted now we're talking about the system being rigged how can it be unmade you know it's Bitcoin the answer Michael Krieger yeah so I think I think um first of all you know human beings and Americans talking to one another and and explaining to each other how things are and how people are struggling and suffering and real journalism is key and so again this is why Facebook is trying to you know crackdown on alternative opinions and keep everything we're like really nice tidy and cozy to like Fox News and MSNBC talking points that's one thing so we got to talk to each other we got to continue to talk to each other Bitcoin is absolutely an open source I think a huge as we've discussed before a huge part of the solution trust lists systems genuine platforms this is something we've discussed I know Stacey tweeted about the other day which I agree she said where's the Satoshi of social media that's right if you're gonna have platforms genuine platforms for a free speech that will operate like the public square you do need them to be truly neutral and if you have human beings deciding you know what can be said what can't be said what is civil dialogue what isn't civil dialogue you're gonna ruin the whole thing so we need real platforms and so those are two things the the other is and this is something I know you've talked about before I even was on your show and this has been the most disappointing thing people are lazy when it comes to thinking about how they spend their own money how many people complain about Bezos and the Washington Post and then go buy everything from Amazon or go spend $300 on groceries at Whole Foods um people are not taking personal responsibility you know as we discussed last time you get mad at Facebook but you're not deleting Facebook and you're still using Facebook you know we need to start to build actual movements where large groups of people are protesting companies and their policies with their pocketbook and you know you even saw this what it respect above what you think of BDS you know boycott divest what's the one sanction I think against Israeli government the Israeli government that's the that's the only thing that really scared them in the last 10 years and so I do believe that we as American citizens have a lot of power and the money we spend and we're not using that at all right you mentioned people need to talk to each other and you know reminds me back pre American Revolution days Americans were being spied on by the colonial overlords and so in the Constitution and other documents they put in something called the right to assemble that's right you can get together and talk to people it you have a right to do that so we fought a whole Revolutionary War for these rights and now they've been assessed you know destroyed over time now talking about we talk about Bitcoin for a second there so Paul Krugman was out again spouting nonsense about Bitcoin he claimed that Bitcoin is in a bubble and that even if the dollar were a bubble that nobody can lose face in it or else they would be met with men with guns your thoughts yeah I mean I just it's so frustrating people send me this link of Krugman intentionally avoid reading anything from him he's a painful writer he's a terrible thinker I mean the guy shorted the internet in the late 90s I I don't even know why I have to read this guy but I did read it and it was horrible again and you know he says in the piece he says please someone tell me you know one thing that Bitcoin does he pretends that he doesn't get it but I'll tell you one thing that Bitcoin does it's very important he assumes in the piece based on no evidence that central banks are trustworthy he also says Believe It or Not he says big banks are trustworthy so he's making these ridiculous assumptions which are clearly false based on recent history and if you look back at the creation of Bitcoin right I think it was the white paper was in January 29 2009 I personally believe that if we didn't have the financial crisis Bitcoin probably wouldn't be as big as it would just sort of be a curiosity so Bitcoin is inherently popular and has a big valuation because there is a huge demand for what it offers which is many things but one of which is trustless money digital money so you could say gold is trustless money and that would be true if you have it in your possession but bitcoin is trustless digital money and that is a huge difference cuz Krugman is saying you should trust the Fed you should trust governments and guys with guns and you should trust big banks and the public a lot of the public and certainly bitcoiners are saying no you shouldn't you should not have to trust anybody or any centralized entity with your money and that's precisely what bitcoin solves and Krugman just doesn't want to deal with that because he trusts all these crazy oligarchic corrupt institutions right so Toshi white paper by the way was written in 2008 and then the Genesis block was January 3rd 2009 but you know I think my Krugman and part of the thrust of his piece is that we've moved from friction based money to frictionless money gold had friction and what came before gold was an even more friction but paper and fiat money it's there's no friction in that and then he says that and anyway if people don't like it we can make it come with men with guns so as if to suggest that a man pointing a gun in your face does not represent friction the man is he is has mental deficiencies on a huge scale and the rest of the piece goes on with similarly misplaced misguided rhetorical gobbledygook and poppycock but again you know who's he working for the the opposition now internationally we've seen nations at least smaller ones get met by our boys with guns if they threaten to dump the dollar so here you know Krugman is pointing out that hey take our dollars oh well if you're in Iraq we'll kill half a million of you but do you see that Gary cone recently said a global cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin is emerging out of the current sanctions writ in Swift access denying Fiat grid so here you have Gary Cohen saying yeah a cryptocurrency will become the global currency won't be a Bitcoin but we will see a cryptocurrency what do you think okay well yeah I mean that just seems like typical human nature and people that are very invested in you know that the current system of course they when you miss Bitcoin most people are obsessed with denying Bitcoin because they missed it and they might feel a little embarrassed or silly that they didn't make a lot of money on it which again is just back to human nature but to your point about friction it's very interesting because as you say it's high it's about how you define friction I can think of all sorts of friction in the current system I mean you get you travel internationally and they'll go after you if you take more than ten thousand dollars in cash with you how is that not friction of course that's friction what about trying to wire money in the u.s. like wire from bank to bank is that really so easy know if there's friction and and and the fact that your your transactions can and we've seen this happen be blocked that's friction Bitcoin yeah the fact that you are allowed to send any amount of money globally in a reasonably quick period of time for relatively low fees is extremely is demonstrates extremely less friction than the current system so it doesn't even make sense to what he's saying at all what about this Gary cone idea that there will be a global cryptocurrency but it's not Bitcoin of course Bitcoin you know the blockchain without Bitcoin is just a spreadsheet you know that's what these guys are hoping for they have blockchain kind of crypto transactions but they don't like the fact that it's trustless and you don't need a central authority I think that's what he's getting at but do you think that he's just this is a gateway into understanding Bitcoin like this is how he's gonna get to the point where oh you know what I was wrong I understand Bitcoin now so he's just on a learning curve or do you think that he's right that there will be a competing global crypto point okay so I guess you have to sort of define what what a crypto coin is in the first place like first so for example the dollar is as you know mostly digital at this point and the dollar is the global reserve currency so you could argue that we already have a global digital reserve currency that exists right now and bitcoin is a an attack essentially on the current system so I when people say stuff like that they're usually intentionally vague but if you actually press them it'd be interesting to see what he has to say my guess let me jump to the final question there Trump's trade wars your thoughts going here a good idea to destroy the trade relationship with China which many unemployed voters see is a cause of their poverty Michael Krieger we got about a minute yeah sure so you know I think it's pretty obvious Ross Perot warned about it in the early 90s with NAFTA but the trade has been rigged with China with other countries so that wealthy people in the US and manufacturers could go engage in a labor cost arbitrage and make huge amounts of money manufacturing overseas and then selling it back here so to me it's pretty you know the results of the last few decades are clear a few people benefited a lot and most people really did and you can see that with wealth inequality you can see that with income inequality and so look I don't know it what Trump's strategy makes any sense or not but I say hey you know what let's let's switch things up let's just try stuff what you know cuz because what we had in the past is not working so at least he's trying to switch it up right exactly I mean I used to change agent you know of it try some new stuff try something it works clearly the system in place was not working all right Michael Krieger of Liberty blitzkrieg I guess the website is Liberty blitzkrieg calm is where you find Michael Krieger and all this excellent work thanks so much bring on the Khans report thanks max was great that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaza report with me nice guys are ass easier like thank our guest Michael Krieger of Liberty blitzkrieg if you want to catch us on Twitter skies report until next time bye y'all
