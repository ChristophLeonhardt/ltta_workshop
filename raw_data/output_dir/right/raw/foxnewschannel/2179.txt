1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:02,169
DID HE EXECUTE?

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,070
HE DID.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,073
>> Sean: I SAW YOU AFTER EVERY

4
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:06,407
DEBATE.

5
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:09,176
>> AND HE GOT BETTER AND BETTER.

6
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,311
>> Sean: I'VE GOT TO TALK

7
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:11,045
ABOUT SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT

8
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,047
I WOULD TALK ABOUT, THIS IS

9
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,484
GOING TO BE A LONG-WINDED LEAD

10
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:16,984
UP TO A QUESTION.

11
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:21,489
I'VE BEEN POINTING OUT ON THIS

12
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,591
PROGRAM, 1873, MISHANDLING OF

13
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:24,358
INFORMATION, IT WOULD APPLY TO A

14
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,195
LOT OF PEOPLE.

15
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,597
IF I WAS SUBPOENAED FOR ALL OF

16
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:32,533
MY EMAILS AND I DELETED 33,000

17
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,970
AND I ASKED TO WASH MY HARD

18
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,972
DRIVE, NO ONE HEARD OF BLEACH

19
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,574
UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY

20
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:41,676
BUSTED UP ALL MY DEVICES THE WAY

21
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,178
SHE HAD HAPPENED.

22
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,780
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF AN

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,981
EXONERATION BEING WRITTEN IN MAY

24
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:48,449
BEFORE YOU INTERVIEW SEVEN KEY

25
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,885
WITNESSES AND THE MAIN PERSON

26
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:51,986
HILLARY CLINTON IN JULY, THE

27
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:53,921
PERSON THAT DOES THE INTERVIEW

28
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,357
HATES THE OPPONENT OF

29
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,358
HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY

30
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:58,025
EXONERATE HER FOR I BELIEVE

31
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:03,597
OBVIOUS FELONIES.

32
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,566
THEN THEY TALK ABOUT RUSSIA

33
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,267
COLLUSION, HILLARY CLINTON AND

34
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,836
THE DNC FUNNELED MONEY THROUGH A

35
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:14,175
LAW FIRM, PERKINS COIE, A

36
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:14,942
FOREIGN NATIONAL WE HEARD WASN'T

37
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,878
SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN OUR

38
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:18,579
ELECTIONS, CHRISTOPHER STEELE

39
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,582
GETS RUSSIAN SOURCES.

40
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,985
THE FBI NEVER VERIFIES IT, THEY

41
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:25,720
PRESENTED TO A FISA COURT TO SPY

42
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,989
ON AMERICAN CITIZENS, A DRUM

43
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:29,190
CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE WEEKS BEFORE

44
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,224
AN ELECTION.

45
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,792
THEY NEVER VERIFIED, THEY NEVER

46
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,427
CORROBORATED TO, THEY NEVER TOLD

47
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,396
THE JUDGE IN THE ORIGINAL

48
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,097
APPLICATION, THREE SUBSEQUENT

49
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,565
APPLICATIONS THAT HILLARY PAID

50
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,567
FOR IT AND THEY NEVER VERIFIED

51
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,167
IT.

52
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,436
MR. MAYOR, WERE LOST BROKEN?

53
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:47,441
LET'S START WITH HILLARY.

54
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,378
>> YES.

55
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,712
13 CRIMES SHE COMMITTED, THEN WE

56
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,448
GOT UP TO ABOUT 18.

57
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,884
I'M SORRY, HILLARY, I KNOW

58
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,585
YOU'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED YOU

59
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,052
DIDN'T WIN.

60
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:01,555
BUT YOU'RE A CRIMINAL.

61
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,757
EQUAL JUSTICE WOULD MEAN YOU

62
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:06,394
SHOULD GO TO JAIL.

63
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,261
I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE JUSTICE

64
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,729
DEPARTMENT IS NOT INVESTIGATING.

65
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,602
>> Sean: THE JAMES COMEY?

66
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,771
>> JAMES COMEY FIXED THE WHOLE

67
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,773
CASE.

68
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:19,440
YOU CAN'T READ THAT STUPID

69
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,575
REPORT THAT HE WROTE THAT SAID

70
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,511
WERE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE --

71
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,211
NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD

72
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,515
INDICT HER.

73
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:28,249
NO HONEST REASONABLE PROSECUTOR

74
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,751
WOULD INDICT HER.

75
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,753
>> Sean: HE SAID YESTERDAY,

76
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,821
HILLARY DEEPLY RESPECTS THE RULE

77
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,657
OF LAW, JIM COMEY SAID THAT.

78
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,660
>> WHILE.

79
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,265
THIS IS A VERY PERVERTED MAN.

80
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,934
>> Sean: DO WE HAVE A TWO TO

81
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:50,004
YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IN?

82
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,073
>> WE HAVE ONE FOR HILLARY AND

83
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:54,108
ALL OF THOSE DEMOCRATS,

84
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:57,978
BILL CLINTON.

85
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,747
>> YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT

86
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,383
THIS, NOT JUST FOR PRESIDENT,

87
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,150
BUT OUR COUNTRY, THERE'S GOING

88
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,785
TO BE A WITCH HUNT AGAINST

89
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,186
REPUBLICANS.

90
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,954
YOU HAVE A MAN ON WHO LOST ALL

91
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,255
HIS MONEY, FOR WHAT REASON, HE

92
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,358
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

93
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,259
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

94
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,961
UNITED STATES DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

95
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,762
WRONG.

96
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,363
WE ARE LUCKY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT

97
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,698
WHO CAN FOCUS, IN A WAY IT

98
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,766
ALMOST HURTS HIM BECAUSE THEY

99
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:19,967
FEEL THEY CAN DO ANYTHING TO HIM

100
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,769
AND HE'S GOING TO REMAIN FOCUSED

101
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,639
ON NORTH KOREA, IRAN, HOW DO WE

102
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,309
HELP ISRAEL, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT

103
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:29,176
TAXES?

104
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,377
SPEW ON THE ECONOMY HAS AN

105
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,112
INCREDIBLE STORY THE MEDIA NEVER

106
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:34,482
FOCUSES ON.

107
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:38,319
IF WE HAD THE HILLARY STANDARD,

108
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,387
IT WOULD NEVER BE UNDER OATH,

109
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:45,359
NEVER BE TRANSCRIBED, --

110
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,962
>> ALL THE WITNESSES THAT WOULD

111
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:50,698
BE FAVORABLE IN THE ROOM,

112
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,967
IMMUNIZED.

113
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,568
>> Sean: WE WRITE TO THE

114
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,402
EXONERATION BEFORE THE INTERVIEW

115
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,539
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         A

116
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:58,572
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         R

117
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,306
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         E

118
00:03:59,306 --> 00:03:59,340
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         T

119
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,373
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         O

120
00:03:59,373 --> 00:03:59,406
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         D

121
00:03:59,406 --> 00:03:59,440
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         S

122
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,473
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         R

123
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,509
THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE         Y

124
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,277
INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE, THEN

125
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:03,944
EITHER YOU OR RUSH LIMBAUGH

126
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,947
WOULD DO THE INTERVIEW.

127
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:14,355
>> RUSH AND I WOULD NOT OBJECT.

128
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,557
>> Sean: IS A POLITICAL REPORT

129
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:20,261
SUGGESTING THAT MUELLER WOULD

130
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,365
CONSIDER IVANKA TRUMP A TARGET.

131
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,500
LOOK AT HOPE HICKS AS ONE

132
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,568
EXAMPLE.

133
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:28,669
SHE PAID MORE IN LAWYERS AND SHE

134
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,338
WAS EVER PAID.

135
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,240
>> I WISH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

136
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,675
COULD GET TO KNOW HER, SHE'S ONE

137
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,377
OF THE NICEST HUMAN BEINGS

138
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,946
YOU'RE EVER GOING TO MEET.

139
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,081
SHE IS VERY LOYAL TO

140
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,149
DONALD TRUMP.

141
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,584
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY

142
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:44,685
THIS, SHE COULD STAND UP TO HIM

143
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,954
WHEN SHE HAD TO.

144
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,656
WHAT THEY DID TO HER IS

145
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,691
OUTRAGEOUS.

146
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,360
IVANKA TRUMP?

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,966
I WOULD GET ON MY CHARGER AND GO

148
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,800
INTO THE WRITERS ROOM WITH A

149
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,071
LANCE IF GO AFTER HIM.

150
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,174
HER.

151
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:09,843
IF THE GO AFTER HER, THE WHOLE

152
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:14,348
COUNTRY WILL TURN ON THEM.

153
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,517
GERRIT IS A FINE MAN, YOU KNOW

154
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,986
THAT.

155
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:19,520
MEN ARE DISPOSABLE.

156
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,691
A FINE WOMAN LIKE IVANKA?

157
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,160
COME ON.

158
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,529
>> Sean: LET'S BRING UP THE

159
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,330
ISSUES WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ALMOST

160
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,733
EXCLUSIVELY ON THIS SHOW.

161
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,367
HILLARY CLINTON OBVIOUSLY

162
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,034
COMMITTED FELONIES, YOU'VE

163
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,069
IDENTIFIED THEM.

164
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,037
I BELIEVE AS YOU DO, JAMES COMEY

165
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:41,175
RINGS THAT.

166
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,343
THEY HATE THE PRESIDENT, THEY

167
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:43,544
HATED THE CANDIDATE, THEY TALK

168
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:49,550
ABOUT AN INSURANCE POLICY.

169
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,951
ANDREW McCABE LYING UNDER

170
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,019
OATH, JAMES COMEY LEAKING FOR

171
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,221
THE PURPOSE OF GETTING A SPECIAL

172
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,056
COUNSEL.

173
00:05:56,056 --> 00:06:00,261
>> ALSO COMEY AND McCABE

174
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,162
CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER.

175
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,331
ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE LYING.

176
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:10,671
I THINK COMEY IS LYING.

177
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,573
McCABE ISN'T A SITUATIONAL

178
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:12,973
LIAR.

179
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,575
IF THIS WERE AN EQUAL SYSTEM OF

180
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,577
JUSTICE, THEY WOULD ALL BE

181
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:16,977
PROSECUTED.

182
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,079
IT'S MY BIGGEST REGRET, I'M

183
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,818
SORRY TO SAY THIS, IN NOT HAVING

184
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,955
TAKEN THAT JOB.

185
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,556
>> Sean: MY BIGGEST REGRET AND

186
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,257
I LIKE JEFF SESSIONS, BUT HE

187
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,126
NEVER SHOULD HAVE RECUSED

188
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,328
HIMSELF.

189
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,498
>> HE NEVER SHOULD'VE APPOINTED

190
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,732
ROSENSTEIN.

191
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,301
>> Sean: I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

192
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,303
SOMEBODY BEING APPOINTED OR

193
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:42,703
CONFIRMED.

194
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,738
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT ROSENSTEIN

195
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,940
WAS WITH MUELLER THE DAY HE WAS

196
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,641
INTERVIEWED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

197
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,844
TO BE FBI DIRECTOR, KNEW THAT HE

198
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:51,478
WAS TURNED DOWN AND THEN

199
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,214
APPOINTED IN THE NEXT DAY?

200
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,582
>> Sean: DID YOU KNOW ROD

201
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,284
ROSENSTEIN ACCORDING TO REPORTS

202
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,152
THAT WE HAVE ON THIS PROGRAM

203
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:01,288
SIGNED OFF ON ONE OF THE FISA

204
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,791
EXTENSIONS?

205
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,692
THE ONE WITH THE UNVERIFIED

206
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,761
DOSSIER, THE BULK OF INFORMATION

207
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,032
AS THE GRASSLEY-GRAHAM MEMO?

208
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,467
HE SIGNED OFF, DOES THAT NOT

209
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,369
CONFLICT WITH ALL OF THIS?

210
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,105
>> IS ALSO A WITNESS TO CRITICAL

211
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,943
INFORMATION.

212
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,911
FOR A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT

213
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,147
PONTIFICATES -- I TOLD YOU.

214
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:27,915
THE ONLY CRIMES COMMITTED ARE BY

215
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,951
THE GOVERNMENT.

216
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:31,952
>> Sean: ANDREW McCABE IT

217
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,087
SAID WITHOUT THE DOSSIER, THERE

218
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:35,255
WOULD'VE BEEN A FISA APPLICATION

219
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,190
WOULD'VE BEEN A FISA APPLICATIO

220
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,590
APPLICATION.

221
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,329
I WOULD ASK YOU, DOESN'T THE FBI

222
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:42,796
I WOULD ASK YOU, DOESN'T THE FB

223
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,264
FBI, AND FBI PROTOCOL MANDATED

224
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,900
THAT THEY VERIFY, CORROBORATE

225
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,938
WHAT THEY PRESENT TO A FISA

226
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:51,472
JUDGE.

227
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,441
WOULDN'T IT BE MANDATORY TO

228
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,143
IDENTIFY THE DOSSIER WAS CREATED

229
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:56,777
BY AN OPPOSITION PARTY'S

230
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:00,080
CANDIDATE AND NOT AS A POLITICAL

231
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,549
ACTOR.

232
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:02,983
>> ABSOLUTELY.

233
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,353
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

234
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,554
INVASION OF PRIVACY ON NO BASIS

235
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,555
AT ALL.

236
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,690
IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION.

237
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,391
>> Sean: UNREASONABLE SEARCH

238
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:13,127
AND SEIZURE.

239
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,628
>> IF THEY SEARCHED YOU OR ME

240
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:27,574
BASED ON THAT WE WOULD SUE THEM.

241
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,710
I WORK WITH GREAT ATTORNEYS

242
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,682
GENERAL, MY FRIEND -- GREAT

243
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,152
ADMIRATION FOR MICHAEL.

244
00:08:38,152 --> 00:08:38,885
TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN UNDER A MAN

245
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,554
THAT I LOVE, JEFF SESSIONS, I

246
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,525
FEEL BAD.

247
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,926
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS

248
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,261
HEARTBROKEN OVER THIS, HE ISN'T

249
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:55,302
ANGRY, HE'S HEARTBROKEN.

250
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,705
THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED R

251
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:58,739
THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED D

252
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:58,772
THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED E

253
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,874
THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED M

254
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:05,679
THEMSELVES, SESSIONS AND

255
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,515
ROSENSTEIN.

256
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,517
WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET

257
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,353
CONVICTIONS, WERE SUPPOSED TO DO

258
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:13,754
JUSTICE.

259
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,889
>> Sean: LET ME STAY FOCUSED

260
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,758
ON THE ISA ISSUE COME UP ROD

261
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,525
ROSENSTEIN AFTER THEY SUBPOENAED

262
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,527
THE DOCUMENTS WANTED TO

263
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,728
PULVERIZE OFFICE BEGGING HIM NOT

264
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,729
TO RELEASE IT.

265
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,932
WE NEVER WOULD'VE HAD THE DEVIN

266
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,900
NUNES MEMO THAT SAID THE BULK OF

267
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,939
THE APPLICATION WAS THAT THE

268
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:32,706
DOSSIER HILLARY PAID FOR -- MY

269
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,374
QUESTION IS THIS.

270
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,944
NOT ONLY THAT, THERE WERE THREE

271
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:37,644
SUBSEQUENT RENEWALS WITH THE

272
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,948
SAME FALSE INFORMATION, THE SAME

273
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:44,117
LYING BY ADMISSION IF YOU WILL

274
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,588
BY NOT TELLING THE FISA JUDGES

275
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,223
THAT HILLARY PAID FOR IT.

276
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,024
>> Sean: IF I STAND UP IN

277
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,059
COURT AT SOMETIME IN THE NEXT

278
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,262
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND I RECIT

279
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:55,496
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND I RECIE

280
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,397
THESE BACK, I THINK THE JUDGES

281
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,131
ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ME AND SAY

282
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:01,935
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE.

283
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,070
HOW COULD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

284
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,739
HAVE GONE SO FAR AWAY FROM THE

285
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,208
FAIR AND HONEST ADMINISTRATION

286
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,344
OF JUSTICE UNDER DECENT PEOPLE?

287
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,112
I THINK THE PRESSURE ON THEM WAS

288
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,548
SO GREAT, THEY JUST CAVED IN.

289
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,083
THERE IS ONE WAY TO REDEEM

290
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,720
THEMSELVES, GET CONTROL OF

291
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,055
THIS -- REMEMBER SENATOR STEVENS

292
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,524
CASE?

293
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:25,092
>> Sean: HE LOST AN ELECTION,

294
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,294
THEN THE JUDGE OVERTURNED AT ALL

295
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:27,861
BECAUSE THEY WITHHELD

296
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,931
EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

297
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,733
>> BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT

298
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,433
MISCONDUCT, THERE'S BEEN MORE

299
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,301
GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT IN THIS

300
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,337
CASE AND THERE BEEN CONDUCT.

301
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,739
>> Sean: THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO

302
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,573
BE ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,

303
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:42,709
BRUSH AND COLLUSION.

304
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,878
>> GONE, HE'S BEEN CLEARED OF

305
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:45,746
THAT.

306
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,347
>> Sean: MY QUESTION IS ARE

307
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:48,582
YOU CONCERNED IN THE PROCESS OF

308
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,250
THIS WE DID DISCOVER THAT A

309
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,686
FOREIGN NATIONAL, CHRISTOPHER

310
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,688
STEELE WAS PAID THROUGH

311
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,591
FUSION GPS, USED RUSSIAN SOURCES

312
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,626
THAT NOT ONLY WEREN'T

313
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,329
VERIFIED -- ARE YOU CONCERNED

314
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,132
THAT WAS PAID FOR, TO MANIPULATE

315
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:05,899
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE LEAD

316
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,168
UP TO THE ELECTION?

317
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,337
>> ISN'T THAT CLOSER TO THE

318
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:17,277
MANDATE THAN MICHAEL:          M

THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN

327
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,154
MONEY, SORRY.

328
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,155
I'M GIVING YOU A FACT THAT YOU

329
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:28,555
DON'T KNOW.

330
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:32,926
IT'S NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY.

331
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,730
NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE.

332
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,764
>> Sean: THEY FUNNELED IT

333
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,732
THROUGH A LAW FIRM.

334
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,167
>> THEY FUNNELED THROUGH A LAW

335
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,436
FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT

336
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:42,769
FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID I

337
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,171
IT.

338
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,138
>> Sean: THERE'S NO

339
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:45,706
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW.

340
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:51,445
>> ZERO.

341
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,846
EVERYBODY WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS

342
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,315
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

343
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,050
I KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE PUT

344
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,153
INTO THAT CAMPAIGN AND I SAID

345
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,655
130,000, THEY COULD DO A COUPLE

346
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,358
OF CHECKS FOR 130,000.

347
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:06,827
WHEN I HEARD HIS RETAINER OF

348
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:07,561
130,000 HE WAS DOING THE WORK

349
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,331
FOR THE PRESIDENT.

350
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,799
THAT'S HOW HE'S REPAYING IT WITH

351
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,639
A LITTLE PROFIT IN THE LITTLE

352
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,506
MARGIN.

353
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,341
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT WHAT

354
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,044
ABOUT

355
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:29,383
STOMACH DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS?

356
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,185
>> HE KNEW HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF

357
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,121
THINGS LIKE THIS, LIKE I TAKE

358
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,722
CARE OF THIS WITH MY CLIENTS, I

359
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,490
DON'T BURDEN THEM WITH EVERY

360
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,725
SINGLE THING THAT COMES ALONG.

361
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,428
>> Sean: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

362
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,131
THE RAID ON HIS OFFICE.

363
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,034
>> ONE OF THE REASONS WE WOULD

364
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,337
HESITATE TO COOPERATE ANY

365
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,505
FURTHER, AND I THINK THIS IS THE

366
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:55,909
BREAKDOWN WITH DOWD BACK IN

367
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,311
JANUARY THAT TOOK THEM BY

368
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,446
SURPRISE, THAT COULD BE BEYOND

369
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,747
ANYTHING -- THAT IS AN

370
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,716
OUTRAGEOUS VIOLATION OF

371
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:03,617
ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE BEYOND
