Men have always been
obsessed with the fantasy
that they could actually
give life to a woman instead
of the other way around —
Adam’s rib,
Pygmalion’s statue
and Andrew McCarthy’s
“Mannequin.”
The point is not
just to create women
but to control them.
It’s literal
objectification —
a dream girl who
is less a person
than a personal plaything.
And for the past hundred 
years or so,
this fantasy has taken
the form of the “fembot,” a
woman who can be programmed
to do as her creator pleases.
“Did I do bad, Dad?”
“No, sweetie, you didn’t.”
Masculine robots
in pop culture
get to do a lot of
things like help people
make friends, do science,
hang out with cats, murder.
“Send in the fembots!”
But more often than not,
fembots exist to please men.
And these days, feminized
tech is all around us.
“And welcome to 
Newark Liberty
International Airport.”
Digital helpmates
like Siri and Alexa
are fitted with
feminine voices.
“Make me a sandwich.”
“I can’t.
I have no condiments.”
Men can engineer
their fantasies
with hyperrealistic
sex robots.
And on social media, 
a new breed of
fembot has emerged.
Meet Lil Miquela.
One million people follow
her on Instagram.
She reps streetwear
brands, speaks out
on social issues like trans
rights and Black Lives
Matter, and now she’s making
the inevitable transition
to a pop music career.
Oh, and she’s not real.
She’s an entirely
computer-generated
online influencer.
Her look is an exaggerated
version of the beauty
standards that have
swept Instagram, making
its most followed women
look oddly similar
and a little bit unreal.
“If I was a celebrity,
I’d be famous.”
And then there’s Poppy,
a real human woman
who acts like an android, a
digital star wholly molded
by internet trends.
“Havana, oh na na, ay.”
Her videos have nearly 300
million views on YouTube.
“Only sweet robots
get whipped cream.”
In 1984, Donna Haraway
wrote “A Cyborg
Manifesto,” in which she
imagined a world where
embracing the cyborg 
allowed women to escape
the confines of traditional 
gender roles.
But today, it seems
that the cyborgification
of women online has just
created new standards
to adhere to, ones
that are increasingly
costly and time-consuming
to fulfill.
Take Kylie Jenner.
It’s so typical
for her to appear
with her phone in
the shot that she
starts to look like a cyborg,
device permanently attached
to her hand.
Clicking through
Kylie’s changing looks
over time gives the
impression of software
upgrading to a new version.
She changes her hair
color so frequently
that it recalls the ease
of a Photoshop click.
Representations
of fembots tend
to track along with our
current cultural anxieties,
from women’s suffrage to
the housewives’ revolt
to the third-wave feminist
campaign for women
to take control over
their sexuality.
These social media fembots
play on the anxiety
that women are fake, that
they’re somehow deceiving men
through makeup or plastic
surgery or Spanx or
Instagram filters.
But they also point out
how real human women are
being molded by technology.
These fembots no longer 
need villainous male creators
to tell them what to do.
Their followers do that
for them, collectively
molding their behavior by
dispensing and withholding
likes.
“I don’t like this video.
Trash it.”
Their creator is us.
Hey, I’m Amanda.
I’m Shane.
He edits the videos.
She writes the videos.
And you watch the videos.

We are very thirsty.
Very.
