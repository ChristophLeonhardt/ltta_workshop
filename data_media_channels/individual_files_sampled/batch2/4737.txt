in an editorial today entitled all the president's thugs the New York Times said we live at a time when a porn star displays more credibility and class than a president now if you're old enough to remember Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon lying about the Vietnam War the idea of porn stars having more credibility than presidents is not new everyone can point to presidents Democrat and Republican who they think have less credibility than a porn star not to mention the fact that we have no widespread societal agreement on the credibility rating of porn stars so The Times editorial is inherently if unintentionally condescending to porn stars the editorial presumes a porn stars credibility level is low or supposed to be low and that presidential credibility is usually higher than porn stars we have no evidence of that we some we sometimes have polling on the credibility of trustworthiness of various occupations gallops last poll on honesty and ethical standards and professions had as usual nurses in the well-deserved number-one spot as the most honest occupation and members of Congress were as usual down at the bottom of the list one notch above car salespeople and at the very bottom of the list were of course lobbyists which is to say former members of Congress porn star was not one of the occupations in the Gallup poll about credibility president wasn't either but now for the first time in history thanks to Donald Trump president and a porn star are in a poll together and it's a poll about credibility and in the one and only poll in history that balances of porn stars credibility against the president's credibility the porn star wins big sixty-three percent believe stormy Downs is telling the truth about Donald Trump and 21 percent believe Donald Trump whatever that means because Donald Trump has not personally denied anything that storming Daniels has said now I for one have not used the turn poin start to describe stormy Daniels because the term has a condescending ring to it whenever it's used outside of the porn business so I've been using it now tonight here simply because I've been quoting the New York Times use of it but for the record stormy journalist herself doesn't seem as sensitive as I am about describing her occupation in a recent tweet she said she's had a quote long career in front of behind the camera in point John Dowd has had a long career as a criminal lawyer and since his most recent client was Donald Trump John Dowd now has less credibility than most lawyers an occupation which by the way scores very low on the Gallup poll about honesty and occupations The Times editorial today about all the president's thugs did not include John Dowd it was an article about lawyers and private detectives around Donald Trump for the last few decades who have used threats and intimidation to try to silence people about Donald Trump tonight John Dowd is well on his way to earning his own editorial in the New York Times as one of the president's thugs and possibly something much worse tonight John Dowd has shifted categories from criminal lawyer to possible criminal suspect the New York Times reported today that John Dowd discussed the possibility of presidential pardons last summer with the attorneys representing former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn that's according to three people with knowledge of the discussions the discussions came as the special counsel was building cases against both men and they raised questions about whether the lawyer John Dowd who resigned last week was offering pardons to influence their decisions about whether to plead guilty and cooperate in the investigation The Times reports that John Dodds conversation with Michael Flynn's attorney Robert Kellner occurred last summer quote at a time when a grand jury was hearing evidence against mr. Flynn on a range of potential crimes if John Dodd was acting as a co-conspirator with the President of the United States in an attempt to obstruct justice by dangling the possibility of pardons then he could be charged in an obstruction of justice case along with the president his conversations with the president about those pardons would not be protected by attorney-client privilege if those conversations were part of a conspiracy to obstruct justice the New York Times reports mr. Dowd has said privately that he did not know why mr. Flynn had accepted a plea according to one of the people he said he had told mr. Kellner that the president had long believed that the case against mr. Flynn was flimsy and was prepared to pardon him the person said was prepared to pardon him The Times reports that John Dodds discussion with Paul Manafort lawyer came before manna fort was indicted in October on charges of money laundering and other financial crimes John Dowd denies to the New York Times that he discussed pardons with Flynn and manna forts lawyers there were no discussions period mr. Dodd said as far as I know no discussions the New York Times confirms earlier earlier reports that the president discussed pardons with White House staff in one meeting with lawyers from the White House counsel's office last year mr. Trump asked about the extent of his pardon power according to a person briefed on the conversation the lawyers explained but the president's powers were broad the person said and in other meetings with senior advisors the president raised the prospect of pardoning mr. Flynn according to two people present in December the president was asked about pardoning Michael Flynn without Michael Flynn would you consider a pardons and Michael Flynn I don't want to talk about parties so Michael Flynn yet we'll see what happened hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
