NEW DATA PULLED FROM MILLIONS OF
CHILDREN AROUND AMERICA OVER
DECADES REVEALS A BLEAK FUTURE
FOR BLACK BOYS REGARDLESS
OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS.
THIS STUDY IS OUT OF STANFORD,
HARVARD AND THE CENSUS BUREAU
AND THEY FOUND THAT:
WHAT IS 
INTERESTING IS THAT:
FOR POOR CHILDREN ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF 
THE
SPECTRUM, THE PATTERN IS
REVERSED.
FURTHER, A LOT OF 
ARGUMENT THAT
POST-RACIAL LIBERALS LIKE
TO USE IS THE FACT THAT MAYBE
THERE IS SOME SORT OF CLASS
DIFFERENCE AND CLEARLY BY SOME
OF THE INFORMATION I JUST
STATED, THAT IS NOT THE CASE
EITHER.
THEY DID SOMETHING THAT IS
REALLY INTERESTING THAT I
WANT TO GET INTO.
WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT BOYS WHO
GREW UP, BLACK BOYS WHO GREW IN
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH PRESENT
FATHERS ACTUALLY FARED A LOT
BETTER, BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING
THOUGH, IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY
HAVE TO BE THEIR FATHER, IT IS
JUST FATHERS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
FATHERS AROUND THEM.
THAT IS WHEN IT 
GETS INTO THE
NITTY-GRITTY IN THE STUDY AND
THIS INFORMATION, IS TALKING
ABOUT INCARCERATION AND THE FACT
THAT BLACK BOYS ARE TREATED
DIFFERENTLY, AND THAT EXPLAINS
SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
BLACK MEN AND BLACK WOMEN, IS
THAT BLACK BOYS ARE TREATED AS
MORE DANGEROUS AND THEY ARE AND
DISCIPLINED AT EARLIER AGES AND
THEY REALLY SOMETIMES SHOWED
THAT
SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE
BECAUSE THEY ARE VIEWED IN THE
STEREOTYPICAL WAY THAT HAS AN
EFFECT BOTH IN TERMS OF
THEIR INCOME AND IN TERMS OF
INCARCERATION RATE.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS:
THAT STATISTIC IS REALLY
ASTOUNDING.
YEAH, AND THE LAST ONE THERE
IS ALSO ASTOUNDING.
LET'S DO THAT ONE, AND THEN I
WANT TO GET INTO WHY, AND
THAT 
IS THE INTERESTING PART.
LOOK, THERE ARE NUMBER OF
POSSIBILITIES AS TO WHY WE
HAVE DIFFERENT RESULTS HERE AND
THE RESULTS THAT HANNAH
JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU.
THE RIGHT WING WOULD SOMETIMES,
SOME OF THE RIGHT WING WAS
SAY RACE.
WE TOLD YOU, IT IS NOT
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS.
EVEN IF THEY ARE RAISED IN
WEALTHY FAMILIES, A LOT OF
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WOUND UP IN
PRISON.
AND THEN A LOT OF LIBERALS,
INCLUDING MYSELF, THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS MAINLY SOCIOECONOMIC
SITUATION, BUT THIS STUDY SHOWS
THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE FACTORS,
IT IS NOT TO SAY IT IS NOT A
FACTOR, YOU ARE STILL IN WAY
BETTER SHAPE IF YOU GROW UP IN A
WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLD, BUT IT IS
NOT THE DETERMINATE FACTOR
APPARENTLY, OR THE MAJORITY
FACTOR DEPENDING ON I WANT TO
PHRASE IT.
TO YOUR POINT, AND THEN
THERE'S CULTURE.
I WANT TO GET INTO CULTURE, I
THINK IT IS THE HARDEST
THING AND I THINK CULTURE IS
NOT JUST BLACK CULTURE, BUT
ALSO AMERICAN CULTURE.
A COUPLE OF THINGS.
IF IT WAS JUST ABOUT RACE, THEN
BLACK WOMEN WOULD BE JUST
AS AFFECTED, BUT THEY ARE NOT.
THEY MAKE THE SAME AS WHITE
WOMEN IN THE SAME SOCIOECONOMIC
GROUP.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYONE EVEN
CLAIMS THAT THERE IS SOME
SORT OF GENDER DISPARITY WITHIN
A RACE, THAT ASIAN WOMEN
COULD BE BRILLIANT BUT ASIAN MEN
COULD BE BAD.
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.
I DON'T EVEN THINK THE CRAZY
RIGHT WING MAKE THAT CASE
SO IT IS NOT ABOUT RACE BECAUSE
BLACK WOMEN OVERALL DO OKAY.
IT IS NOT GENETIC, THAT IS WHAT
I MEAN BY THAT.
IT IS NOT A MATTER OF ETHNIC OR
RACIAL TRAITS.
ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATION,
IT PARTLY IS DEFINITELY
THAT BECAUSE BLACK WOMEN DO
OKAY.
IF YOU'RE RICHER AND YOU'RE A
BLACK WOMAN YOU STAY RICHER AND
YOU STAY AS RICH AS WHITE WOMEN
IN THE SAME CATEGORY, BUT
THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING
THAT IF YOU ARE A BLACK
MALE, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE
CASE.
TO ME, AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK
THE INTERESTING PART OF THE
CONVERSATION IS, DIVING INTO
CULTURE AND FINDING OUT WHAT WE
THINK IS THE REALITY ON BOTH
SIDES, WHETHER IT IS CULTURE
WHERE THE FATHERS ARE NOT
PRESENT, BUT ALSO THE
AMERICAN CULTURE OVERALL THAT
STIGMATIZES AND STEREOTYPES
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALES MORE THAN
ALMOST ANY OTHER GROUP AND
IN FACT, SEEMS DEFINITIVELY MORE
THAN ANY OTHER GROUP.
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE
TALKED ABOUT IS THE
FACT OF THE WAY CHILDREN ARE
TREATED IN PRESCHOOL
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THIS IS
ACROSS BOARDS, THEIR
GENDERS BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
DETERMINED THAT WAY TOO.
THE WAY TEACHERS AND CARETAKERS
JUST SAW MINORITY CHILDREN AS
MORE DANGEROUS OR AS OLDER THAN
THEY WERE, SO A FIVE-YEAR-OLD
KID, THEY WOULD BE LIKE HE'S
ACTING UP, HE IS LIKE A 10 YEAR
OLD
ACTING UP, SO PUNISH HIM IN
A DIFFERENT WAY AND IT ALSO
LEADS TO THE PRESENCE
OF POLICE OFFICERS IN
SCHOOLS, YOU'VE SEEN POLICE
OFFICERS ASKED TO COME IN
AND ATTACK A CHILD BECAUSE
THEY'RE ACTING ON THE
TEACHER CANNOT HANDLE IT
ANYMORE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING WHICH WE DID
NOT GET TO SEE IN A LOT OF
CASES AS THEY FEEL LIKE THERE
NEEDS TO BE LAW ENFORCEMENT
BROUGHT IN RIGHT AWAY.
THAT IS INGRAINED SO OF ALL
THESE FACTORS, I WENT THROUGH
THE SEVERAL PAGE ARTICLE IN THE
NEW YORK TIMES, THE ONE THING
THAT IS THE CONSISTANT IS THAT
OUR SOCIETY GETS THINGS WRONG
AND WE
DO NOT LEARN FROM SOME OF OUR
MISTAKES, SO WE CAN BLAME OTHER
FACTORS, WHICH WE ALREADY WENT
THROUGH, I'M NOT GOING TO GO
THROUGH THE DETAILS, BUT
WHAT WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSES IS OUR
PERCEPTION AND HOW THE ENTIRE
SOCIETY SEES CERTAIN FOLKS AND
THAT INCLUDES BLACK PEOPLE
SO WHENEVER PEOPLE SAY, YOU
THINK BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T BE
RACIST?
NOT REALLY, BUT WHAT DOES
HAPPEN IS THE SAME ASSUMPTIONS
THAT THE REST OF SOCIETY MAKES
ABOUT BLACK FOLKS, SO DO
BLACK PEOPLE BECAUSE WE LIVE IN
A SOCIETY.
SO THIS CULTURE OF DIFFERENT
CULTURES IS THE AMERICAN
CULTURE AND THE MAIN ONE THAT WE
DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE IS WE
REFUSE TO ADMIT WHEN WE ARE
WRONG, AS A COMPLETE COUNTRY.
WE ARE AMERICANS, WE ARE RIGHT,
WE'RE THE BEST EVER AND IF
YOU TELL SOME THING DIFFERENT,
YOU'RE THE WRONG ONE.
WHICH WHEN WE TRY TO ADDRESS OUR
PROBLEMS WHICH IS INGRAINED
IN OUR SOCIETY, WE REJECT IT AND
TRY TO PUT IT UP ON
SOMETHING ELSE SO NEVER CHANGES.
I THINK YOU BRING UP AN
INTERESTING ISSUE.
ADDRESSING OUR PROBLEMS, AND
THAT IS WHAT OBAMA'S
ANTIDISCRIMINATION GUIDELINE FOR
SCHOOLS ACTUALLY TRIED TO COMBAT
AND ADDRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE
RECOGNIZING THAT BLACK CHILDREN
AND BLACK BOYS IN PARTICULAR
WERE BEING DISCIPLINED MORE
SEVERELY AND MORE OFTEN THAN THE
OTHER STUDENTS AND THAT IS
AN ISSUE THAT CARRIES ON THROUGH
PRESCHOOL AND BEYOND.
EVEN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCHOOL
SAFETY MEASURES, WHEN THEY
ARE SEARCHING BACKPACKS AND
DOING, HAVING KIDS WANDED
AT SCHOOLS, THAT DOES NOT SHOW
ANY SORT OF BENEFIT TO THE
KIDS, TO THE COMMUNITY, ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.
IT IS NOT A MORE DANGEROUS
COMMUNITIES, THE KIDS DON'T SHOW
MORE DANGEROUS THINGS ABOUT WHAT
IT DOES IS IT CREATES A SELF
FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR
THE STUDENTS AND KIDS WHO
ARE TREATED AS PRISONERS AND
CRIMINALS AND THEN THEY END UP
AS CRIMINALS AND INCARCERATED.
WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT
INCACERATION AND MORE BLACK MEN
WHO ARE INCARCERATED, I'M
NOT SAYING MORE BLACK MEN ARE
COMMITTING CRIME AND I WANT
TO MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE
THEN THAT GOES MORE INTO
THE SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS AND
THE WAY THAT WE TREAT BLACK
MEN IN THE COMMUNITY WHEN THEY
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE
INCARCERATED FOR A CRIME THAT A
WHITE MAN COMMIT.
I WANT TO GO OVER SOME STATS
THAT WE TOUCHED ON THE SHOW
BEFORE
BECAUSE THEIR RELEVANCE OF THIS
CONVERSATION.
BLACKS AND WHITES DO MARIJUANA
AT ABOUT THE SAME RATE.
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE ARRESTED
AT FOUR TIMES THE RATE.
WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ARRESTED THE MOST?
BLACK MEN.
SO THAT AFFECTS THEM A LOT MORE
SO IT'S A LITTLE HARDER FOR
THEM TO RECOVER IF YOU HAVE BEEN
PUT IN JAIL.
THERE'S A LAWYER THAT THEY
TALK TO HERE IN ONE OF THE
SUBURBS OF WASHINGTON, AND
MARILYN, THAT'S ACTUALLY
ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE BLACK MEN
DO JUST AS WELL AS WHITE
MEN BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF
FATHERS AROUND AND HE SAID LOOK,
EVEN ME, EVERY TIME I GO TO THE
MALL I HAVE TO THINK THROUGH,
SHOULD I PUT ON SWEATPANTS OR
SHOULD I PUT ON MY SPORTS COAT?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO
PUT ON A SPORTS COAT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEKEND TO
GO TO THE MALL, BUT HE IS LIKE
IF I GO IN THE WRONG OUTFIT, GOD
KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,
AND THAT IS REAL AND THAT IS
WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS AS WELL.
THAT DISPARITY AND HOW THEY ARE
TREATED IS EVIDENT THROUGHOUT.
THE OTHER PART IS, IT'S STILL A
SOCIOECONOMIC SITUATION,
IT MATTERS A LOT.
THE AVERAGE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
BORN INTO A TWO-PARENT FAMILY
IS BORN INTO A FAMILY THAT HAS
ABOUT $16,000 IN WEALTH.
THE AVERAGE WHITE AMERICAN BORN
INTO A TWO-PARENT FAMILIES BORN
INTO A FAMILY THAT HAS $161,000
IN WEALTH AND HERE THEY SHOW
AFRICAN-AMERICANS MADE UP 35% OF
ALL CHILDREN RAISED IN THE
BOTTOM 1% OF THE INCOME
DISTRIBUTION, SO THAT IS A HUGE
PERCENTAGE, AND THEY MADE UP
LESS THAN 1% OF THE CHILDREN AT
THE VERY TOP SO THEY START AT A
DISADVANTAGE TO BEGIN WITH AND
THEN YOU ADD IN THE RACE ISSUES,
THE LET'S TALK ABOUT CULTURE
OVERALL, BECAUSE ONE OF THE
OTHER THINGS IT WAS IN THE STUDY
THAT I THINK WAS REALLY
ILLUSTRATIVE WAS WHAT HAPPENS TO
ASIANS BECAUSE ASIAN AMERICANS
ACTUALLY OUTPERFORM WHY
AMERICANS ON INCOME WITH A HUGE
BUTT, AND THE BUT IS WHAT I
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE
IN THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED.
ONLY IF THEY ARE
FIRST-GENERATION IMMIGRANTS
OR IF THEIR PARENTS ARE.
ONCE THEIR PARENTS ARE BORN
HERE, THEN BEING ASIAN
AMERICAN DOES NOT HELP AT ALL.
SO TO ME WHAT THAT SAYS IS,
CULTURE MATTERS.
CULTURE MATTERING IS BOTH
IMPORTANT AND UNCOMFORTABLE
IN A LOT OF WAYS, BUT IMMIGRANTS
COME IN, HARD-WORKING,
YEAH, IT IS A STEREOTYPE BUT
ALSO TRUE, AND THEY WIND UP
OUTPERFORMING EVERYONE ELSE IN
THE COUNTRY BUT THE MINUTE
THEY GET USED TO AMERICAN
CULTURE, THEY ARE DONE FOR.
THE EFFECT OF THE MEAN, TO THE
AVERAGE.
DOES IT MATTER THAT, TO HAVE
MORE FATHERS PRESIDENT IN
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITIES?
APPARENTLY DOES MATTER BECAUSE
IN QUEENS, THE BRONX, AND
MARYLAND WHERE THERE MORE
FATHER'S OVERALL IN THE
COMMUNITY, THEY DO BETTER.
THEY DO JUST AS WELL AS WHITE
DUDE ON THE OTHER HAND,
DOESN'T MATTER THAT AMERICAN
CULTURE HAS THIS DEEPLY
INGRAINED INSTITUTIONAL RACISM
AND TO JAYAR'S POINT, IT IS
ALSO BLACK COPS WHO THINK THE
SAME WAY.
THERE ARE ALSO BLACK LEADERS WHO
THINK THE SAME WAY.
THEY DO NOT MEAN TO AND THAT IS
WHY WE SAY IT IS NOT ALWAYS
DONE OUT OF MALICE IN SOME CASES
IT IS BUT IN A LOT OF CASES
IT IS NOT THAT IS WHY IT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO UPROOT THAT
UGLY THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF HER
HEAD WHICH LEAD TO THESE
UGLY RESULTS.
IT IS A SYMPTOM OF OUR
SOCIETY AS I ALREADY MENTIONED
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE
THING.
SENATOR TIM SCOTT SPOKE
OUT ABOUT WHEN THINGS ARE
HAPPENING WITH POLICE BRUTALITY,
HIM BEING PULLED OVER SEVEN
TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T
BELIEVE THAT AND HE HAD A
SENATOR PEN, HE CAN'T GET INTO
THE MEETING, I RECOGNIZE THE PEN
BUT
I DO NOT RECOGNIZE YOU.
ON THE
OTHER HAND, BROCK TURNER, A
COLLEGE KID WAS CONVICTED OF
RAPE GOT SIX MONTHS AND GOT OUT
THREE MONTHS INTO THE SENTENCE
AND IS NOW CURRENTLY APPEALING
THE
SENTENCE BECAUSE THIS IS SO
UNFAIR.
THERE IS A MINDSET THAT YOU
BEGIN YOUR LIFE WITH AND YOU
APPROACH SOCIETY THAT WAY AND
SOCIETY TREATS YOU ACCORDINGLY.
TO THAT POINT, I WANT TO READ
JUST ONE LINE FROM THIS ARTICLE
THAT IS SO WELL DONE.
IT SAYS
THE WORST PLACES FOR WHITES
PRODUCE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ABOUT
AS GOOD AS THE BEST PLACES
BLACKS AND I THINK THAT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY
FROM THE STORY.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHITE
PRIVILEGE OR ANYBODY DOES, FOR
THE 18TH TIME, OR PROBABLY
ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT, IT DOES
NOT MEAN IF YOU ARE BORN IN A
HOLLOW IN WEST VIRGINIA YOU'RE
PRIVILEGED AND IN GREAT SHAPE
BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT EVEN IF
YOU
ARE BORN INTO THAT SITUATION AND
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE IS BORN
INTO A MUCH HIGHER ECONOMIC
UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS, EVEN THE
RICH, THEY SHOULD HAVE A MUCH
GREATER ADVANTAGE OVER UB BUT
THEY DON'T, THEY GET BROUGHT
DOWN BY THE FACTORS THAT WE
MENTIONED HERE AND IF YOU ARE ON
THE SAME PLANE ECONOMICALLY, THE
BLACK GUYS A LOT MORE SCREWED
THAN YOU ARE AND SO YOU MIGHT
NOT SEE THAT IN YOUR LIFE
BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK, IT IS
NOT LIKE I AM LIVING HIGH ON THE
HOG, BUT WHAT THIS STUDY IS
SHOWING YOU IS THAT THEY ARE
EVEN WORSE OFF AND IT IS
NOT TO MALIGN YOU OR CRITICIZE
YOU.
IT IS SO WE CAN GET THOSE
THOUGHTS OUT OF OUR HEADS.
BLESSING IS YOU REMEMBER THE
FAMOUS KANSAS STUDY WHERE
THE TEACHERS HAD THE BROWN ITEM
BLUE-EYED KIDS UNTIL THE BRAN
I KIDS THEY WERE SCARY AND THE
BLUE-EYED KIDS WERE INFERIOR.
NOT ONLY DID THE BROWN EYED
KIDS IMMEDIATELY START DOING
BETTER IN SCHOOL, SOME PROXY FOR
WEALTH HERE IN THE STUDY, BUT
THE BLUE-EYED KIDS IMMEDIATELY
INTERNALIZED IT AND STARTED
DOING WORSE AND THEN SHE FLIPPED
IT AND THEN AGAIN, NOW THE
BLUE-EYED KIDS THOUGHT THEY WERE
SUPERIOR AND THE BROWN EYED KIDS
THAT THEY WERE INFERIOR AND THE
RESULTS IMMEDIATELY SHOWED IT.
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO FIGHT
AGAINST THE STEREOTYPES SO
THAT WE CAN FIX OUR CULTURE.
