SIGNS MIGHT BE YET TO COME.
MELISSA?
>> Melissa: TRACE GALLAGHER,
THANK YOU.
MY NEXT GUEST,
UNFORTUNATELY, KNOW ALL TOO
WELL WHAT THE VICTIMS OF
THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
ANDREW POLLACK'S DAUGHTER
MEADOW WAS KILLED IN THE
PARKLAND, FLORIDA MASS
SHOOTING AT STONEMAN DOUGLAS
HIGH SCHOOL ON FEBRUARY 14TH
AND HE JOINS ME NOW.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE
TIME TO BE WITH US TONIGHT.
WHAT WAS.
>> THANKS, MELISSA.
>> Melissa: WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU
SAW THIS TODAY?
>> WELL, MY HEART SANK TO MY
STOMACH WHEN I FOUND OUT,
WHEN I STARTED THE -- THE
TEXT MESSAGES STARTED TO
COME IN.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
AS THE DAY GO WENT ON I'M
GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER
HOW THIS HAPPENED AGAIN.
HOW MANY KIDS IN THIS
COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO LET
GET MURDERED IN A SCHOOL.
LIKE WHEN IS SNUFF?
WHEN IS ENOUGH KIDS GOING TO
GET SHOT IN A SCHOOL WHERE
WE ACTUALLY -- WE ACTUALLY
SET UP A PERIMETER WITH
ENTRY POINTS AND METTLED
DETECTORS?
>> Melissa: YEAH.
IT'S RIDICULOUS ALREADY.
>> Melissa: I KNOW YOU ARE
AND ADVOCATE FOR SCHOOL
SAFETY.
IS THE PERIMETER AT THE TOP
OF YOUR LIST OF THINGS THAT
YOU THINK WE NEED?
>> WELL, LISTEN.
THIS IS OUR SOCIETY WHAT IS
DEALT TO US.
SO WE NEED TO HAVE SINGLE
POINT ENTRIES AND THERE
NEEDS TO BE METAL DETECTORS.
LOOK, YOU CAN'T GET ON A
PLANE WITH YOUR SHOES ON.
YOU HAVE GOT TO TAKE YOUR
SHOES OFF TO GET OFF A
PLANE.
YOU CAN'T GET IN A
COURTHOUSE.
YOU CAN'T GO INTO A FOOTBALL
STADIUM.
SO WHY IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO
KEEP LETTING OUR KIDS GET
SHOT IN A SCHOOL?
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.
WE NEED METAL DETECTORS AT
OUR SCHOOLS AND THAT WILL
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
OUR KIDS SHOULDN'T GO TO
SCHOOL AND FEEL THAT THEY'RE
NOT SAFE AND OUR TEACHERS,
TOO.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE GOT TO FIX
IT.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO
DO THAT WE COULD DO THIS
WEEK.
>> Melissa: YEAH.
A LOT OF PARENTS AT HOME
WATCHING THIS FEEL LIKE IT'S
A SITUATION THAT'S OUT OF
CONTROL AND THEY ARE
FRUSTRATED THE SAME WAY YOU
ARE ABOUT NOTHING GETTING
DONE.
HELP THEM TAKE SOME ACTION.
WHAT SHOULD THEY DO IF THEY
GO TO THEIR KID'S SCHOOL ON
MONDAY, WHAT QUESTIONS
SHOULD THEY ASK?
WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK FOR TO
TRY TO KEEP THEIR KIDS SAFE?
IT'S A FIRST STEP TO GO TO
THAT SCHOOL.
WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK FOR?
>> THEY SHOULD GO THERE AND
SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET IN
THE SCHOOL IN THE MORNING.
CAN ANYBODY WALK IN?
HOW MANY ENTRY POINTS ARE
THERE?
DO THEY HAVE A SCHOOL
RESOURCE OFFICER?
THIS SCHOOL IN TEXAS, THEY
ACTUALLY THERE COULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT MORE FATALITIES.
I THINK HE HAD HAD TWO SRO
OFFICERS AT THAT SCHOOL.
SO YOU HAVE GOT TO LOOK AT
THE SCHOOL.
GO BACK AN HOUR LATER.
MAKE SURE THE GATES ARE
LOCKED.
SEE, YOU KNOW, GET INVOLVED
WITH YOUR SCHOOL BOARDS.
>> Melissa: YEAH.
>> ALSO PEOPLE ASK ME, I
JUST WANT TO MAKE A POINT,
WHAT COULD YOU SAY TO THESE
FAMILIES THAT LOST THEIR
CHILDREN?
>> Melissa: UM-HUH.
>> THERE IS NOTHING THAT
ANYONE COULD SAY TO A PARENT
THAT LOST A KID IN A SCHOOL
SHOOTING THAT'S GOING TO
MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER.
YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT THE
WORLD TO KNOW THAT, THAT WE
HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUS AND
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH WITH
LETTING OUR KIDS GET SHOT.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NEVER
GOING TO BE THE SAME, THESE
PEOPLE.
AND IT ANGERS ME THAT THESE
PARENTS NOW ARE GOING TO
FEEL LIKE I DO AND, BELIEVE
ME, IT'S NOT FUN.
I HAVEN'T FELT ANY BETTER
SINCE FEBRUARY 14TH.
IT'S 90 DAYS LATER.
AND I FEEL THE SAME PAIN AS
THE 14TH.
SO THERE'S NOTHING NOW --
NOW THESE PARENTS LICE ARE
CHANGED FOREVER.
>> Melissa: I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE SUING A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE.
INCLUDING NIKOLAS CRUZ'S
PARENTS FOR WRONGFUL DEATH
OR MOTHER, PARDON ME FOR
WRONGFUL DEATH.
IN THIS CASE WE ARE HEARING
AS WE ARE HEARING IN EARLY
REPORTS, THE GUN BELONGED TO
THE SHOOTER'S PARENTS MAY
NOT HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP.
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THESE
DETAILS.
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT AND DO YOU THINK THAT
IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE
PARENTS NEED TO BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE?
>> I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD
REALLY LOOK INTO IT AND
BEING A RESPONSIBLE GUN
OWNER, YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR
GUNS LOCKED UP.
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM WHERE A
MINOR HAS ACCESSIBILITY TO
BE ABLE TO GO GET YOUR GUN.
SO, I'M ALL FOR THAT I THINK
THE PARENTS SHOULD BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE.
YOU WILL SEE SOME THINGS
CHANGE IF YOU START HOLDING
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.
AND THEY SHOULD LOOK INTO
THAT I REALLY THINK THEY
SHOULD HAVE HAD THOSE GUNS
LOCKED UP.
BEYOND THAT WALKED INTO A
SCHOOL WITH A SHOTGUN.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T WALK
INTO THE COURTHOUSE SO WHY
IS IT ACCEPTABLE THAT THIS
KID TOOK A SHOTGUN AND
WALKED IN TO A SCHOOL AND
SHOT THESE KIDS?
IT'S ENOUGH.
YOU KNOW, I KEEP GETTING
ANGRIER AS I THINK ABOUT
THIS.
AND I LOOK AT THE PICTURES
WHILE I'M WAITING TO GET
INTERVIEWED, I'M LOOKING AT
PICTURES OF MY DAUGHTER AND
I'M SAYING NOW THERE IS 10
MORE FAMILIES THAT HAVE TO
LIVE LIKE I DO.
>> Melissa: DO YOU HAVE ANY
WORD FOR THEM TO GET THROUGH
YOU?
SAY THERE IS NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN SAY TO MAKE THEM
FEEL BETTER BECAUSE THEY
WON'T FEEL BETTER.
BUT PERHAPS IT'S ABOUT
JOINING THE FIGHT?
>> YES.
I WELCOME THEM TO REACH OUT
TO ME.
I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO
CALL ME.
I WILL BE THERE FOR THEM.
THAT'S ALL I COULD DO FOR A
PARENT THAT LOST A KID IS
JUST BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN
THEY NEED YOU.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU COULD
SAY THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
AWAY THE PAIN.
BUT LET'S MAKE SURE IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU
KNOW.
I'M GOING TO GO -- I THINK
I'M GOING TO GO TO TEXAS.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE
NOW AND I WANT TO GO SEE
SOME OF THESE FAMILIES AND
JUST GIVE THEM A HUG AND LET
THEM KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, I
KNOW HOW THEY FEEL BECAUSE
NO ONE ELSE KNOWS HOW YOU
FEEL UNTIL YOU LOSE A KID.
AND IT'S A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE FEELING, MELISSA.
>> Melissa: YEAH, I HAVE NO
DOUBT.
OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON
