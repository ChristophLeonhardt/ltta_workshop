it's September 11th so we commemorate 9/11 we also talk about Hillary Clinton who just can't let go plus I'm headed to Berkeley and apparently it's just like a hurricane or something I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so I am ready to give you the update on Berkeley because it is hilarious hilarious let me tell you and I will tell you all of the things about that I'll also give you some notes on 9/11 plus I want to talk about Hillary Clinton's in an interview Steve Bennett in an interview so a lot to get to today but before we do any of that first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so let's say that you're watching TV and you saw that there are some natural disasters on the TV and you thought yourself hmm I wonder what those people would do if they were stuck in their house without access to let's say a grocery store or electricity what would they do the answer is if they had my Patriot supply they'd be in good shape you would be - okay anywhere you live in the country there are natural disasters that can hit you there's also the possibility of course that Kim jong-un decides to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at the west coast of the United States in which case you would be wise to have something in your house that you can eat so you don't have to wander outside and be turned into a frog human so that is why it is necessary to go over to my Patriot supply right now and get some supplies okay get their survival food supply for just $99 it includes a hundred and two servings of breakfast lunch and dinner for less than a dollar per serving order now eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen that's eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or online and prepare with been calm that's prepare with been calm my Patriot supply they believe in old-fashioned values and you can join me in their mission to build a more prepared and self-reliant country 888 803 1413 888 803 1413 prepare with Ben comm it's prepared with Ben's out comm again for 99 bucks you're making sure your family is safe this seems like a no-brainer to me prepare with Ben calm you look at the disasters right now there's no question you should be prepared prepare with Ben calm okay so here is the update on Brooke Lee so at Berkeley okay Berkeley has decided that I am I'm a real threat okay this is a headline from the LA Times quote Berkeley braces for right-wing talk-show host Ben Shapiro's visit braces for it like it's a hurricane like oh my god I'm coming and I'm talking on Thursday what are they ever going to do now the reason they're really upset is because the antifa has threatened violence over the weekend we saw an Tifa rioting in Portland again this time attacking police officers I can safely say it's all my fault I guess or something okay the fact is that Berkeley is I would say going above and beyond in terms of its security Garrity said we couldn't bring a thousand people because they were afraid people were gonna go in the upper deck of the stadium and start throwing chairs down on people which is just totally insane then they've apparently created a security perimeter they're creating a hard security perimeter when I go on Thursday that means that they're going to have police cordons basically around six buildings they've shut down the building's completely so people have to have classes and other buildings listen this is not my fault folks it's not something I wanted I just would like to be able to go there and talk about the things that I talked about and I was unaware that I was such a controversial figure I mean I sort of knew but I didn't realize it was to this extent but it's really because of Berkeley but don't worry it's really cuz of me according to the LA Times it's because Berkeley is bracing for me they're not bracing for an tifa's reaction to a conservative visiting no they're bracing for me if only I didn't descend with my 130 mile per hour winds on Berkeley then they wouldn't have to worry about this so much Berkeley is also freaking out because they've also suggested that they want to provide counseling for students who are hurt by my words seriously this is what they're actually saying they want counseling so according to Newsweek okay a head of a talk from conservative political commentator ben shapiro at UC berkeley a letter has been sent by the university to students faculty and staff stating that counseling services will be made available to those who quote feel threatened or harassed by certain speakers what we are deeply concerned about the impact some speakers may have on individual sense of safety and belonging hey I'll agree with this much if you feel so insulted by my speech that you feel that your safety has been assaulted you definitely need mental help if you really feel that way then you can certainly use some counseling because you're a sad sack pathetic piece of crap like seriously if this is what you worry about all day is that I'm gonna come to your University and I'm gonna say oh conservative things no God forbid no and you need counseling then let me suggest that you actually do need counseling I do love what the left does here that they so overstep their boundaries it's insane and Tifa is suggesting that I am a white supremacist now which is hysterically funny refused says I'm a fascist thug and a white supremacist which is really amusing considering I was literally the number one recipient of hatred from the alt-right on Twitter last year according to the anti-defamation league so that's pretty awesome refused fascism issued a statement clearing campuses must become fascist free zones how through fascism of course we have to make sure that no one can get on campus that's how you make sure it's a fascist free zone by establishing your own fascist zone that's obviously wid that you have to do this so you know we're all prepped we're ready to go we are coming it should be interesting the tickets sold out in 45 minutes we're still trying to figure out how to deal with the situation the eventualities we're a bunch of antifoam members come in the stadium into the into the venue and then get up and leave and leave a bunch of empty seats can people come in after that we're working that out with young America's Foundation so you can contact them at young America's Foundation at yah org but we are coming and I will say that I think this whole thing is wildly overblown and I'm not sure whether to be flattered or insulted it's it's pretty incredible actually okay in other news obviously it's pretty somber anniversary today's the 16th anniversary of 9/11 amazing how fast time moves and remember that you know everybody has their where were you when 9/11 happened story for me I was let's see 17 years old and my dad and I were actually supposed to go golfing that morning and we dropped off my sister's at school and as we pulled into the parking lot one of the security guards came running out and said that planes had hit the World Trade Centers and they had collapsed and we rushed it inside the school and I remember that the school which is an Orthodox Jewish day school had told all the students there was gonna be extra security they did not in fact have extra security my father and I standing there with golf clubs were actually the extra security so that was not probably planned but obviously a horrific horrific day and everybody remembers the images so it gives you a pit in your stomach if you're not old enough to remember if you're one of my younger listeners then you should go back and watch the tape because it's important to know what happened in our country on September 11th 2001 and it's important to remember because there are certain lessons that we learned after 9/11 that I think we have sort of been in the process of unlearning all of history tends to be a process of learning lessons and then forgetting them as fast as possible so that you can repeat the history again so I want to go through a couple of lessons I think that it is worth remembering from 9/11 so that we don't repeat 9/11 again even though I think that you know that's the chances that there will be another major first attack sometime in the next ten years I think I'm pretty high and I don't just mean you know truck style attacks from Isis I mean like an actual spectacular attack that takes out thousands of people and I'm not saying that obviously I'm saying that with tremendous with tremendous hope that I'm wrong but it seems to me that the more we go down this road of forgetting what we learned on 9/11 the more we're getting closer to that so number one global retreat is not a strategy if you remember the Clinton era you remember that Clinton's basic foreign policy strategy was retreat from the world except when he did sort of these pinprick strikes in particular areas sometimes we'd intervene on humanitarian grounds but we never intervened with regard to preserving our own security we never took preemptive strikes to preserve preserve our own security and bin Laden noticed in 1998 he bombs the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that sovereign American territory and the United States basically did nothing when bin Laden bombed the USS Cole the United States did basically nothing and bin Laden I mean this is in his writings said he thought that we were a paper tiger at that point it was only because of George W Bush really like a George W Bush gets a very bad historical rap but if you talk to the people at al-qaeda from al-qaeda they openly acknowledge that they were not expecting the kind of response that received from george w bush they've prepared a second wave of attacks and because bush was so aggressive had finished that so james mitchell who is the man who questioned al-qaeda mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who's the planner of 9/11 Qasim said quote how was I supposed to know that cowboy George Bush would announce that he wanted us dead or alive and then invade Afghanistan to hunt us down according to Mitchell Qasim explained that if the US had treated 9/11 like a law enforcement matter he would have had time to launch a second wave of attacks but now it seems like we are very reticent about pre-emptive attacks it seems like we are reticent about looking at the threats that face us I am fighting Isis now which is great but what about the next threat what about Iran what about Hezbollah doesn't mean that we have to take out the regime and Iran does mean we have to go to war with them but the fact is that unless we are willing to consider measures to stamp out terrorist groups across the planet we are setting ourselves up for a fall okay second lesson that we should have learned on 9/11 money and friendliness do not buy off Islamist there's this weird idea from both the Ron Paul right and from the Barack Obama left that if we just give enough money if we just show the Muslim world that caring and wonderful that we will be left alone by terrorists this is absolute nonsense there's not an argument by the way for being mean to Muslims worldwide it's not an argument for not having relationships with countries like Saudi Arabia where we have an actual intelligence relationship it is an argument suggesting that if we think that's enough if we think that being friendly that being a human rights proactive that this is going to be enough to prevent terrorism we are wildly mistaken and stupid the fact is for a decade the Clinton administration reached out to the Palestinian government for example with cash with concessions from the Israelis and you remember the tape you do you remember the tape on 9/11 of Palestinians handing out candy in the streets to their children as the towers fell we were pretty humanitarian toward the Muslim world in the 1990s right we saved a bunch of Bosnian and and Croatian Muslims in former Yugoslavia we prevented the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein we gave tons of money in foreign aid to various Muslim countries around the world in an attempt to prevent humanitarian catastrophes we we sacrificed American soldiers in far-off places like Somalia just because we didn't want to see the disaster of Muslims dying for no reason we did all of these things and that obviously was not enough to turn off the terrorists this is not to say we shouldn't have done any of those things what it is to say is that if you think that that in and of itself is gonna buy off terrorists you are sadly mistaken the Obama administration took to heart this idea that's why they back the so-called Arab Spring oh if we backed amok recei in Muslim places then certainly these people will turn out to be pro America not the way that it works okay third lesson we should have learned on 9/11 this is one I think President Trump did take to heart that is immigration matters okay immigration matters 59 the nineteen hijackers were Saudi all of them were here on visas all of them were here on visas one was on a student visa the other were here on travel visas or business visas and virtually all of them I believe overstayed their visas not student visas but other visas you know President Trump has focused laser-like on a couple of different areas of immigration he's focused on deportation of people who crossed the border illegally on the southern border illegally he's focused on building a border wall he's focused on travel bans from seven specific Muslim countries but what he has not focused on so much is how we deport people who are overstaying their visas illegally okay half of all illegal immigration in the country forty to 50 percent is people who are overstaying their visas illegally we left them in the country and then we let them wander around and we don't check up on them the fact is that the government ought to be deeply concerned about people who are entering the country from Islamist rich areas of the world no question but we also should be careful about the people who are already here we should be checking up on them that's something that I hope the Sessions DOJ does in the fourth point that we recognized on 9/11 that we need to recap here is that major terrorist attacks do require sponsor states if you look at terror in Western Europe in the United States what you will see is that there was a giant spike obviously in terror deaths in 2001 there are a few more terror deaths in 2002 and then you see a pretty big gap in terms of terror against Americans and Western Europeans from about 2003 2002 2003 all the way until about 2010 2011 what happened during that period well the invasion of Afghanistan the invasion of Iraq everybody hates the invasion of Iraq the fact is major terrorist attacks war 4 stalled because we were fighting terrorists over there and we weren't fighting them over here the minute that Isis began to regain territory that gave them the capacity to sponsor terror attacks all over the world in a way they had not been able to before al-qaeda required a terrorist safe haven in Afghanistan it's one of the reasons why I think President Trump is correct not to give up on the war in Afghanistan I think that simply surrendering it back to the Taliban is a recipe for another state-sponsored terrorist attack this is why the Iran deal is so devastating you have a major wealthy power in Iran that is willing to sponsor terror groups all over the planet state sponsors of terror can do things that simple terrorist groups cannot you're always going to have what they call lone-wolf terrorism or small-cell terrorism that's not quite the same thing as these major spectacular terrorist attacks killing hundreds of people that requires a base like Isis to train people provide them services provide them guns provide them ammo provide them bombs provide them all the things they need finally final point on 9/11 and then I'll move on to Hillary Clinton here America has real enemies we're so busy in the United States tearing each other apart were the freest most wealthy power in the history of the world and that means that we tend to look at each other and say well look al Qaeda isn't really a threat to us Isis isn't a threat to us it's not an existential threat anyway Obama used to say this all the time he used to say that this isn't an existential threat ok it's not just the government's job to protect you from existential threats it is also the government's job to protect you from being murdered in your bed it doesn't have to be an existential threat for it to be an existential threat for you 9/11 was done an existential threat to the United States it was an existential threat to the 3,000 Americans were murdered on 9/11 it is the government's job to protect us from those things and when people say things like well how many soldiers died in order to protect us from the next one number one we don't know how many people were saved by that we don't know the counterfactual and number two it is very different to use our military people who have volunteered for our military go to fight the bad guys that's why they join up and it is a it is sort of a slander on their patriotism to suggest they join the military just for the benefits but they don't join up in order to fight the bad guys the vast majority of people I've talked to in the military they joined up to fight the bad guys and so long as the government is deploying them properly and they are more than happy to go and kill the bad guys it's their job it's what they're here to do okay so before I go any further I'm gonna talk about Hillary and Steve bannon's in an interview on 60 minutes that's getting a lot of play before I do any of that first I want to ask you have you

interviews on her new book what happened and the answer is you did hillary a lot of people saying trump happened hillary happened to hillary hey this is one thing i did get right during the election cycle I asked myself during the election cycle is this thing a referendum on Trump or is this thing a referendum on Hillary Clinton and I said over and over and over again this is a referendum on Hillary Clinton it is not a referendum on Trump Hillary Clinton is the third term for Obama you looked at her poll numbers she was bouncing around between 39 and 50% Trump was very stable at between 41 and 44 percent that meant Hillary could lose to him but she could lose to him right it wouldn't be him winning it would be her losing and that's actually what happened well now Hillary is doing the rounds and it is amazing I mean the reason that she lost is the reason why she's doing the rounds John McCain's in write a book after he lost Mitt Romney didn't write a book after he lost hey John Kerry didn't really write a book after he lost all these people sort of disappeared they sort of went away they went away because they knew that they were doing more damage to their party by sticking around than they would by by actually than by just disappearing Hillary is sticking around because she cannot get over the fact that she lost she has to wake up in the morning and look at the mirror and say to herself what in the hell just happened here and that's of course the name of her book so she does this interview and she starts off by saying she's not gonna run for office again like yeah we know you lost is your political career over yes as an active politician it's over you will never be a cannibal I'm for I am done with being a candidate but I am not done with politics because I literally believe that our country's future is at stake you represent me so she says that she's not gonna run for office again in any case that is not a giant shock that not gonna run for office because again she lost then she admits that she hadn't drafted a concession speech this shows you why Donald Trump won and it shows why Republicans can continue to win no matter how incompetent they are Democrats are so confident that the world is just gonna fall into their labs that they don't even seem to be making an effort Hillary was a good example of this here she is explaining that she hadn't even drafted a concession speech you know I just kind of went in the bedroom laid down on the bed just thought okay I just have to wait this out but then midnight I decided well you know looks like it's not going to work I had not drafted a concession speech a victory speech our best days are still ahead of us you remember it but she never thought that she was gonna lose and then what becomes clear is that she has never given up on her line the line is that everyone who voted against her was a white nationalist supremacist piece of garbage this is her line and this is what Democrats still believe so long as Democrats believe this they're going to lose the fact is a lot of people who did not vote for her people like me right a lot of us were just appalled by the alt-right a lot of us were appalled by white supremacism a lot of people who voted for Donald Trump are appalled by white supremacism they just didn't like her but Hillary continues to double down on this line and it's one of the reasons why there is this backlash that has been soft toward the all right because the more that Hillary Clinton says that everybody's a white supremacist the more that people say well I'm not a white supremacist maybe those actual white supremacists over there aren't white supremacist either here's Hillary Clinton doubling down on the deplorable and pretend you remember she have a speech in the middle of the campaign in which she suggested that everyone who is supporting Donald Trump was a deplorable white supremacist she read a bunch of headlines from Breitbart she talked about the all right and then she linked everybody on the right with the alt-right and everybody on the right picked up on that and they said well I'm not a deplorable and if she's gonna call me a deplorable then I'll call myself a deplorable and she still doesn't understand that was a galvanizing moment for the opposition to her why do you think that word deplorable had been circulating in your mind well I thought Trump was behaving in a deplorable manner I thought a lot of his appeals to voters were deplorable I thought his behavior as we saw on the Access Hollywood tape what deplorable and there were a large number of people who didn't care it did not matter to them okay maybe it mattered to them then they looked at you and they said well I'm not voting for that lady right that that seems to me more likely but again she can't get over herself she still think she was wildly popular except for the sneaking Nazis right those thieving sneaking Nazis and Russians it was the new Molotov Ribbentrop pact and they decided that Ribbentrop pact and they they put together this alliance against Hillary Clinton personally and then she continues along these lines right she still can't get over and she says that Trump's inauguration speech was a cry from the white nationalist good on the platform you know feeling just like an out-of-body experience and then his speech which was a cry from the white nationalist gut okay it was not a speech that was a cry from the white nationalist got his speech his inauguration speech was I thought quite well written I thought it was very dark but I thought that it was effective I don't think was about white nationalism so much as it was about the idea that America had fallen on hard times and now Trump was gonna raise us up again right Trump was going to be the guy who dragged us out of that crevasse the reason all of this matters the reason Hillary Clinton still matters is because her spirit still infuses the Democratic Party her cackling spirit still infuses the Democratic Party they don't understand why they lost they think that they are just going to kind of sweep in to victory again on the basis of confusion and ire and anger and hatred for the other side and I don't think that that's right and you can see that what what's happened here is is we now have reactionaries on both sides so Hillary Clinton is a reactionary of the left she thinks that everybody on the right is white nationalist then you have reactionaries on the right who people like Steve Ben and I think who have turns Hillary Clinton said okay well if you're gonna react that way then I'm gonna look at the all right and I'm not gonna consider these people the worst things in the world I'm gonna make room for them you know maybe they'll they'll come out in the wash eventually I'm gonna talk about Steve ban in 60 minutes interview in a minute I don't think Steve is a white nationalist by any means I mean I noticed II pretty well I was on a phone call with him for basically two hours a day for two years of my life so I know Steve pretty well but I do think that Steve fell into a trap that a lot of the right is for into but again the left is pushing the right into this trap and the right should be careful not to fall into it another example of this it's not just Hillary Clinton who believes this Stephen Colbert he was on his show the other night and he actually gave a Nazi salute because his suggestion was that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon were actual Nazis and then he throws up a Nazi salute after the Charlottesville situation I said well told John Kelly I was the only guy that came out and tried to defend him I was only a guy that said he's talking about something taking it up to a higher level he's definitely taking it to a higher level I'd say his support is about about up there right around here okay and say there he is giving the Nazi salute is though Dannan and Trump are Nazis and then the right goes well we're gonna call them Nazis I mean then everybody's a Nazi Nazism must not exist this is the mistake the left makes and it's really stupid it's really stupid but the right has to be careful not to fall into the same mistake now I want to talk about Bannon because I think the bannon's interview on 60 minutes was less important for who Bannon is and it was more important for what Bannon hopes to represent and why the Trump movement is I think a Trebek ibly split and I don't think it's likely to cohere I'm gonna explain why in just a second for that I'm gonna have to go over to Daley

minutes now as I say I know Steve pretty well I'm not a fan of Steve bannon's I think personally he is he's not a nice guy or the person but Steve's an interesting figure he for sure an interesting figure and Steve's appearance on 60 minutes is less interesting for who he is and for what he was in the Trump administration than for what he represents which is a sort of attempt to meld the it of the Trump with the super-ego of the Trump it's an attempt to create a Trump movement the biggest problem with Trump so far and the biggest problem with Trump overall is that Trump actually is just an empty vessel Trump does not have an ideology Trump does not have a philosophy it's why he's happy to make deals with Democrats he's a quote/unquote pragmatic deal maker just a guy who will go out and make deals with anyone and you see people like Steve trying to give him a patina of intellectual coherence as though there's a natural philosophy behind what Trump does rather than a series of impulses this doesn't mean all his impulses are bad President Trump it just means that trying to create a philosophy around Trump is sort of like trying to tap water to the wall it's just not going to work you know Trump does not have any substance to him that you can actually tack to the wall and you can see bannon's difficulty in doing this so first I want to say that you know all of the media's attention on Bandhan is wildly overblown and an attempt by the media to pretend that Trump isn't president that's really what's going on here with Steve okay Steve joined the campaign he was not by any stretch of the imagination the key figure in the Trump campaign Trump was always the key figure in the Trump campaign I think he was able to impose a little bit of discipline on Trump during the campaign and did a good job with that in a way that some other people couldn't he was kind of the Trump Whisperer for a little while but the fact is that that Bannon himself was never particularly important either to the Trump campaign or to the Trump administration right by the end of the administration by the time end of his time in the administration he basically been marginalized to a small office where he had a white board full of Trump's promises that hadn't been kept where he would obsessively read the newspapers in the Internet and then call presumably Matthew Boyle over a Breitbart to talk about it the fact is Steve was not a major figure by the end of the Trump administration his time the Trump administration he'd been marginalized every report says this he did not leave because he was so vital in fact he was so non vital that there's still his slots has not been filled they literally made up a position for him gave him the position and then didn't fill the position when he was gone he also happens to be the money connection for Trump he's very much connected to the Mercer's who are a very wealthy family down in Florida who funded Trump and are funding a trump super PAC the reason that Bannon is sort of important as a general mood is because now Bannon is saying that he's going to attempt to lead a bunch of primaries against sitting Republican senators who don't back Trump now the only reason that he can get away with this is because of this split inside the mentality with regard to Trump one people really like Trump and they want to back from two Trump doesn't really have an agenda so even people who voted with Trump on key issues like Jeff Flake in Arizona right Jeff Blake could be primary why because he said nasty things about Trump and then you see people on the Democrat side who didn't vote with Trump like Heidi Heitkamp and you're not seeing a lot of talk from the Republicans about how they're gonna take down Heitkamp Trump just went out and praised her so it's very incoherent it's very discombobulated the reason I say that that Bannon is not such an important figure in that the media are making him an important figure is because the media do not want to it's another way for the media not to accept that Trump is president right Trump isn't president an ins president i Trump isn't president John Kelly's President Trump isn't president Reince Priebus is president some people on the right used to do this with Obama some of us on the right used to do this oh it's really Valerie Jarrett whispering into his ear it's really Rahm Emmanuel whispering into his ear the left dinner with Karl Rove Karl Rove is whispering into bushes ear the fact is the president is the president he's one who makes the calls it was Trump who decided that he did not trust Bandhan enough it was Trump who marginalised and this is why Bandhan giving this excuse here about seer Bandon give an excuse for why he's no longer at the White House and it just doesn't fly here he says he was not cut out to be a staffer to be this strong a defender why aren't you there why and with the president of the states who you applauded so loudly have allowed you to leave if he didn't want you out Knossos act opposite I was a I was a standing look I'm not cut out to be a staffer and the one in the one in the White House in the way your title was not Stafford that was your title was chief strategist staffer I was a federal government employee there's certain things you can't do I cannot take the fight do we have to take the fight too when I'm an adviser to the president for government boy you can't do it okay that's that's a that's not really why he left okay he's already achieved the height of his power you have to understand something about Steve personally to understand why he's not super an important figure and that is that Steve basically lucked into every job that he's held for the last ten years he sort of latched on to various figures he latched on to Michelle Bachmann and then he latched on to Dick Morris and then he latched on to Sarah Palin and then he latched on to Andrew Breitbart he was there when Andrew died that allowed him to get his foot in the door in terms of using editorial a Breitbart to push for Trump and then he latched on to Trump and Trump won right that's wrote Bannon is not a force in his own right he's not a mover and shaker Bannon is more of a barnacle on whatever powerful figure he happens to follow but here's the part that I want to talk about Bannon right like why am I wasting the time if I really think he's not that important why am I wasting the time on him I do think that he is important as a window into the mentality of what some members of the media are trying to do with Trump or Trump supporters and that is they're trying to fuse the in with the super-ego so in the Freudian analysis your personality is made up of three parts okay this is this is basic Freud you're it which is your series of instincts right you want to have sex you want to have it you want to eat steak right you're it is driving you to do these emotional things then there's your super-ego your super-ego is the Apollonian part of you and then the sort of Nietzsche and construct it's the part of your brain that that says I will use rationality and logic to check the it and make deals with the aid that's the super-ego and then there's the ego that militates between them right then there's the ego that decides okay that's you right the ego is you and the and the ego is what two sides have I gotta follow the the it or am I gonna follow the super-ego and a little too basic to that sort of the breakdown so what's happened with Trump film is that Trump is largely driven by his in there's been an attempt to intellectualize Trump right there was something called the Journal of American greatness which attempts to intellectualize Trump there are some intellectuals like Victor Davis Hanson who have tried to create a philosophy around Trump benen sort of tried to create a philosophy around Trump but Bannon is posing himself as the ego of trumpism that he is going to do the hard work of trying to bring together the philosophical strain of trumpism and of Trump and so in order to do that sometimes he has to be the it and sometimes he has to be the super-ego he thinks this is what Breitbart is going to be he thinks this is what all of these candidates that he's going to use two primary all these other Republican figures are going to be the new movement is going to be a merger it's going to be a philosophy of trumpism that Trump may not at all times believe but the soul of Trump that a fighting soul of Trump right this is sort of what he wants to create beautiful vision except that Trump will not be bound by a philosophy Trump is militantly anti philosophy from his militantly anti ideology he doesn't like any of these things any boundaries on him make him angry okay Trump is unbridled it in politics so you'll see Bandhan trying to do this right it was almost a dichotomous interview with 60 minutes and you see this from a lot of Trump supporters that half the time it's Trump's the edge fight fight fight and then half the time it's well he's playing 40 chess it's not really that he's not fighting it's not knee-jerk it's not angry he's just he's playing super sophisticated chess and I've suggested all along that most of what he does cannot be explained by strategy it's more explained by by the in your naseeb Anand do this routine here and I think that it's telling so here is Bannon going after Charlie Rose with regard to Ryan and McConnell so he says we're gonna go after Paul Ryan we're gonna go after Mitch McConnell this is the it'd part of the Trump world the Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election that's a brutal fact we have to face the Republican establishment like an establishment wants to nullify the 2016 trying to nullify the 2016 election absolutely okay so it's Ryan McConnell Franken albeit Rakhal onto the 2016 election we have to fight them at every turn fight fight fight fight fight fight fight right this is the in part of it first of all from what I've seen Paul Ryan is not trying to nullify the effects of the 2016 election he's been basically walking around with his lips puckered to Trump's ass since the election started or since the at least since the election was completed so the the idea that Ryan and McConnell are desperately trying to undermine Trump you know I don't think that's right I think that Bannon is mad because their agenda is not his agenda and sometimes Trump seemed to follow their agenda but the idea here is that Trump is the it and Bandhan is the it - he's the fighter in the trenches don't you understand and then at the same time you'll see ban and say things like you know I wish the Trump had used more strategy when I came - for example daca right he Benin openly said that he he opposed Trump getting rid of daca actually which is an amazing thing Breitbart I was there okay Breitbart was the most anti daca outlet that was that was present in American politics I'm worried about losing the house now because this up because of daca in my fear is that with this six months downrange if we have another huge if this goes all the way down to its logical conclusion in February and March it will be a civil war inside the Republican Party that will be every bit as vitriolic as 2013 and to me his fear is the civil war but he just said he wanted a civil war wrecked he just said once that gonna go I want a civil war with Ryan and with McConnell but my great fear is a civil war that will bleed down into 2018 over daca so which is it is he the it or is he the super-ego and the answer is these two things cannot coexist because again they don't exist in a single person okay the it'd the super-ego they don't exist in movements they don't exist in movements okay the movement either has to be driven by the it or it has to be driven by the super-ego or that you have to work hand in hand but you cannot have a movement that is split between it and super-ego and the it pays no attention to the super ego and the super ego pay no pays no attention to the it'd unless the central figure is Trump right unless Trump is the ego Bannen cannot be Trump's ego Bannen cannot be the guy who stands there and militates between the in and super-ego if Trump is the it'd and Paul Ryan is the super-ego Bannen cannot be the eagle because baman is not that important and herein lies the problem for Bannon and for the movement generally for trumpism Trump is not a guy who is pulling from the ID's sometimes and from the super-ego sometimes he is pulling only from the in the it'd is this administration the super-ego doesn't even exist again you as a person have all three of these qualities a movement can only have all three of these qualities its super-ego and ego if the ego is the guy at the center of it Ronald Reagan could be the ego he could militate between the the rabid part of his base and the super-ego highly intellectualized portion of his base right George W Bush could do that because he was more of a judgement guy Trump is not a judgement guy and Bannon can't be that for him and Bannon trying to be the ego inevitably is going to put him at odds with Trump he's going to try his best not to do that but that's what it's going to be or he's just gonna have to give in to Trump's head right or he's just gonna have to give in to Trump's head and surrender the super-ego part of this entire argument and that'll be fascinating and remember for all this talk about how much power abandoned in Breitbart wield in these election cycles I mean I was there when they tried to basically primary Paul Ryan with Paul endale and and Nalin got killed by 70 points so you know the only race I'm aware Breitbart had any impact in at all which again I think Breitbart when I was working there was a very powerful sight and did some good things but and and I think they still do some good things but I think that the idea that that Breitbart had a market impact on election cycles outside of you know Trump which is a huge one obviously and the primaries which were enormous and Dave brat I think is a mistake they're gonna go around primary and all these candidates and be successful in that I think that's probably a little bit a little bit much okay so again you can sort of see this split between the the it and the super-ego when you look at people like for example Jeanine Pirro and Jim Jordan so Jeanine Pirro is definitely a representative of the trumpian ed and she is obviously an foxnews she'll says a radio show and here she was talking about how Trump making in the old Democrats last week was a great great great thing right this is the in portion of the movement the establishment is out to get Donald Trump they say nice things because they don't want to really be outed but when I saw Donald Trump this week decide that he was going to cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer certainly you know not people that die admire for sure but I can't blame him and I said good for him not only is he gonna shake up the establishment these he's gonna change the paradigm you know good for him good for him why why good for him because I can't blame him this is the words that you hear out of people's mouths when they're defending the trumpian it I can't blame him he doesn't deserve blame sort of like you're dealing with a small child or a dog I can't blame him sure he bit me but I mean I did smell like bacon you know the this this notion is is not really it doesn't indicate the strength of a movement again it's it indicates that this split Trump because he's such an adjuvant candidate he has opened up this gap between it and super-ego in the movement that I'm not sure can be rectified again unless there's a new leader of the movement which may come along sometime in the future but until then we're just gonna have to suffer through the split okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I'm in the middle of this book that is really fantastically written I really am enjoying it Edward feasor the book is the last superstition a refutation of the New Atheism so he takes on Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and he talks about how a lot of the arguments in favor of atheism are basically taking arguments made by Aristotle and Plato and Thomas Aquinas and dumbing them down and then refuting the dumbed down right then creating a straw man and then burning it and this is a much more sophisticated defense of the Aristotelian defense of God right that the first cause the unmoved mover it's it's it's really quite fascinating it makes a very rational case for the notion of an unmoved mover in the universe and explains why that is not easily refuted simply by saying well why can't there be a mover of the unmoved mover that the whole book is about why that's not true and it's it's quite good it's colorfully written and rare for a philosophy book it's really readable and lucid you know there there's a lot of lot I mentioned this last couple weeks when I've been talking a lot of philosophy there's a lot of philosophy that is really poorly written I mean try to read a page of can't it's just it's written in gobbledygook it's it's almost impossible to understand some like Aristotle and Plato are actually pretty readable the the John Locke is is pretty readable but a lot of philosophers are really not readable and they read like garbage and that is not the case with ever and feasor the book is the last superstition or refutation of the New Atheism and I think it has a lot of important insights and interesting things to say okay however other things that I like so I'm Betsy DeVos as I mentioned the Secretary of Education last week she came out and she got rid of the what they called Dear Colleague letter put out by the Obama administration in 2011 and this was a letter that basically said that colleges were no longer allowed to kick over sexual harassment sexual abuse allegations to the police instead they had to create up these kangaroo courts she says this is nonsense and she's exactly right any perceived offense can become a full-blown title 9 investigation but if everything is harassment then nothing is punishing speech protected by the First Amendment trivializes actual harassment it teaches students the wrong lesson about the importance of free speech in our democracy harassment codes which trample speech rights derail the primary mission of a school to pursue truth good for her okay what she is saying here is exactly right and I understand that there are a lot of people who are wary that that schools are gonna quash allegations of sexual harassment well that's why we have a police force I'm sorry to say that we don't we can't do any better than that we can't we can't do any better than if something bad happens you have to go report it to the authorities and the authorities have to have some sort of evidentiary showing in order to prosecute people otherwise this turns very quickly into Stalinist show trials and that's not just accusations of even if something bad happened if you don't have evidence to prove that it happened or a country where innocence is still required before we call somebody guilty okay time for one more you know let's do one more thing that I like this is really funny so Michael Moore demanded that mar-a-lago be used as a as a hurricane shelter he said has he opened up mar-a-lago as a shelter he had 56,000 likes okay and then Donald Trump jr. shellacked him because Donald Trump jr. pointed out um dude we're actually in the hurricane zone we had to evacuate it so it's amazing how the left will jump on any talking point that's anti Trump in order to push against him without looking at you know actual logic or facts okay time for some things I hate let's do it all righty so a couple of things that I hate first of all the media have been making complete fools of themselves they go out in the middle of the hurricane and they stand out there like getting blown over by wind and I understand that this is like I'm using to all of us I understand that we are all sort of hoping that that eventually Chris Cuomo be standing out there and then he'll just go flying 100 feet now that'll get hurt but that he'll like go flying 100 feet ago disappear into the waves for just a second before a helicopter picks him up for the same reason we watched the Wallendas try to walk across the Grand Canyon ie you want to be there in case they fall you sort of want to watch the coverage of these hurricanes here's some more on getting out of his car and then trying to demonstrate how strong the winds are hurricane Irma and there the city goes he's standing there trying to stand up to the title of his hurricane and he's and he's full-on pushing against the hurricane and you got to admit when you watch this you're sort of hoping that he just sort of go sailing off the screen because when people do stupid things then you sort of hope that they they pay a particular penalty not a harsh physical penalty you wouldn't want anything terrible to happen of the guy but I would like to see him get knocked on his butt a little bit because it is it is ridiculous like don't be a moron people please please okay other things that I hate so President Trump was praising the coast guard and he was talking about what a great job they did wonderful I wish that President Trump his first instinct were not always to to deal with things in terms of fame and fortune but that's just how he deals with stuff here's President Trump praising the coast guard if you talk about branding no brand has improved more than the United States goes okay no no improved its brand was the Coast Guard having serious branding problems yeah what were they being boycotted like I'm just wondering how that work was look we're like Philip Morris they're putting out commercials for children and then they were banned by the federal government mr. president please get the marketing side of yourself under control it's not a big thing like really the small ask but can you please stop seeing things in terms of how you see them I understand that Trump thinks of himself as a brand because he is he's one of the world's great he's he is I think probably the greatest Brander in history I mean the guy branded himself to the presidency of the United States but the Coast Guard really did not need to improve its brand like let's just cut that out if we can okay so we will be back here tomorrow I'll give you the update on Berkeley I will talk about an TFI ante people went nuts in Portland yesterday they attacked a bunch of cops obviously my fault and we'll bring you the latest on the political situation as we always do I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you
