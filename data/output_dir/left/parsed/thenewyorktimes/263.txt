“Ain’t no justice.”
“Ain't no justice.”
“We are the change.”
“We are the change.”
“I am exasperated
by what the Parkland
students had to endure.
I am agitated that this is what
had to be done to unite us.“
“I think you should
arm us with books,
instead of arming us
with weapons.“
“I’m angry that I have to worry
about losing another brother
to gun violence.
I’m angry that as we
walk down the street,
we talk about it as if
it’s a regular thing,
but it’s not.“
"Every one of
us in here has experienced
violence in our community.
So how has this affected
us and our goals
and our hopes and our dreams."
"I lost my brother to a
shootout.
And I’ve been in countless
occasions of just violence
about trying to be robbed.
Or just trying to get away 
from a dangerous situation."
"I know it’s different for me.
I come in here as
your teacher, but I’ve
lost three students
over the past years."
"You can go outside one day
and not know what's going to
happen to you.
Like you could be innocent
and all that other stuff.
You could be in the
middle of something
and just get shot."
"Thank you for engaging it.
This is a hard conversation.
I'm really proud of you."
He’s just 15 years old,
but Ke'Shon Newman has
had to grow up fast.
Two years ago, his brother
was shot and killed
around the corner
from his house.
"He was walking back from taking
his girlfriend to the bus stop.
And he was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.
And there was a shootout down the block.
And he was shot.
He was shot nine times,
and was killed
at the hospital."
His brother
Randall was 16 years
old when he was killed.
"He didn’t even deserve to have
his life taken away.
I thought I would have had enough
time to still hang out
with him, still just
have fun, just grow up
with him. To have it cut
so short is a 
tragic thing."
The South Side
of Chicago
is a world away from
Parkland, Fla.,
where 17 people were killed
in a mass school shooting.
But young people here say
that the country is finally
waking up to a reality
they face every day:
Gun violence.
"In my school,
I don’t really think of it as
a place for a mass shooting
cause most — most stuff,
that happens outside of school.
But what I have in common
with the kids in Parkland
is that I know how
it feels to lose someone
that’s close to you."
Ke'Shon lives in the Auburn
Gresham neighborhood
of Chicago’s South Side.
It’s one of the city’s
most dangerous areas,
but there’s a strong
sense of community here.
The homicide rate in this
area is 10 times that
of the national average.
And gun violence
in this community
is mostly gang related.
"You will not hear about a kid
going into a Chicago high school
and shooting up a school.
That’s not our reality
of gun violence.
But they can leave school and 
on the block where they live,
and they can get caught in the crossfire
between rival gangs."
Lamar Johnson mentors Ke'Shon
and other kids at a violence
prevention program
he runs at St. Sabina,
a church in the area.
"It’s a jungle.
You have to be alert.
You have to be aware,
because there's a lot going on.
It’s a lot of good people here.
But at the same time,
it’s a lot of dangers as well."
"I have to make sure that
I’m not in the wrong place
at the wrong time because
a situation can come out
of nowhere just from
the wrong person, having
the — a terrible mindset to
actually want to kill someone
or to shoot down a block."
Lamar took some kids from
the South Side of Chicago
to Florida to meet with
the Parkland survivors.
They went to share their stories
and their collective grief.
"We was talking about
the differences
between how gun violence
has affected them
that day versus the
everyday reality.
So I was sitting there
with a smirk on my face
like, well, I was — I basically told them
I said, 'Well, no disrespect.
Welcome to our world.
And I mean this 
with true sincerity.'
And when I said that one of
the students was like, 'Well,
I want to apologize to
you because I understand
the reason why we
have this platform
is because we're privileged.'"
"So y'all, I can tell y'all alright,
y'all good?"
Ever since the Florida shooting,
he’s led his youth group through
some difficult conversations.
"First of all, let’s name
some of the similarities
and differences, we have apart.
Yeah."
"To the Parkland kids this
happened one time.
But to the people of
Chicago, here, this happens a lot."
"So if somebody you know 
got shot, and somebody they know
got shot, the feeling's going
to be the same."
"Regardless of how many
times you experience it,
if they experienced it one,
two times
they still going to feel
traumatized
because that was a
moment that happened."
"So let me ask,
do you feel we get the same
attention?"
"No. Not at all."
"So you think
Chicago doesn't get attention
for its gun violence?"
"That area was nice and
had, like, wealthy —
it was nice. It was
suburban."
"You wouldn't have
expected it."
"You’re not — you're not angry
at Parkland.
You want to know why?
Parkland is with us."
Young people like
Rie'onna
Holmon say that the threat
of violence is always around them.
"What happened in Florida
happens here every day
17, more than 17 people
die a year here.
More than 17 people
die a week here.
And I think now they understand
that connection is going on."
She’s 15 years old and says the
dangers in her community marked
her entire childhood.
"Growing up on the South Side of Chicago
is really fearful.
We can't go outside and just
sit on our porch, or just
ride around our
neighborhoods on our bikes
like they can in
different neighborhoods."
Rie'onna, Ke'Shon and others
are all heading to Washington
to take part in the national
march against gun violence.
"It's probably going to choke
me up.
I'm probably going to cry mostly
because it's a bunch of youth
all working together to
achieve one goal.
And that's never happened before."
Just a week
before the march,
a conversation born out of
tragedy between young people
more than a thousand miles
apart came to life.
Survivors from the
Parkland shooting
traveled to Chicago for a
chance to see firsthand what
life is like on the
South Side.
"When I’m with these other students
and people from Chicago,
I feel their pain."
"This isn’t just in schools.
This is anywhere and everywhere."
"There shouldn’t be no fear
inside someone's heart
just for them to live their
life every day."
"Pain is pain.
It doesn’t matter
what ethnicity you
are, where you come
from, where you live,
how much money you make.
What happened in Parkland,
was injustice, and injustice
there is injustice here."
