- Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to my channel.
I have been getting a
lot of requests asking me
to do different things with my voice,
because I have such a nice voice,
so this is an attempt at ASMR.
I did a little bit of research,
and learned that it's all about sounds,
and just having a very
relaxing environment.
But to make this a little different,
a little fun for you all, I've pulled
in my friend Diego here.
- Hey.
- Who is gonna provide me with the content
that I will then read
for this ASMR session.
And we're just gonna have a good time.
Before we get going though,
gonna have some tea.
Here.
(teapot dragging across table)
and we're just gonna...
-  Actually, it's empty.
- Oh, just kidding, it's empty.
(tea pouring)
Yeah.
That's, that's beautiful.
(teapot dragging across table)
We'll let that brew for a minute.
So while that's brewing,
let's go ahead and get going.
Diego, what content do you
have for us to do that?
- All right, uh, well, I've
brought my sketchbook here.
And of course I also brought
different pencils and pens.
(zipper opening)
Let's see what we got here.
I've got Sharpies.
Pens.
My favorite is always gonna
be number two graphite.
So it's already fairly sharp.
But, uh, I think for the
purpose of this demo,
I'm gonna sharpen it a little bit.
- All right.
- My lovely wife has made this
beautiful pencil shavings
receptacle for me to use.
- That's great.
- When I need to sharpen my pencil.
So this out of the way.
- How interesting, so you use a knife
to sharpen your pencil, do you?
- Yeah, I like my knives,
and I use whatever excuse
I could come up with to
use them for more things.
(knife scraping on pencil)
Also, uh, you kind of lose a little bit
less graphite by doing it this way,
than by using a standard sharpener.
There you go.
(paper rustling)
(slurping tea)
- So Diego, what will you
be drawing for us today?
- Uh, so I'm not actually
gonna be drawing,
I'm gonna be writing
down a series of jokes,
maybe some puns.
- Okay.
- Um, I get a lot of comments
for saying dad jokes, typically.
Though I'm not a dad of a person,
I'm only, you could call
me a dad of a small dog.
- Yeah.
- Who's amazing.
I mean, I like to think it's witty humor.
Um, but yeah, this'll be interesting.
I'm not typically a type of person
to just memorize jokes.
- Yeah, yeah, I know
you're very off the cuff.
- I am very off the cuff.
- With your jokes.
So hopefully, we could, we could develop
some kind of groove here, it'd be nice.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- So, get started.
Kind of riff on something we said earlier.
- Okay.
- Let's see, uh...
- I believe good writing sounds
are always important for an ASMR video.
Let us know in the comments below
how we're doing, you know?
I mean, as you all know, I enjoy
constructive criticism of all kinds,
so in the comments below, let us know
how I can improve the ASMR video.
We'll go from there.
I am being told to eat a cracker.
(plastic crinkling)
Oh, it's a graham cracker.
-  I feel like I need to cover it
so you can't see what I'm writing.
(laughing)
(eating graham cracker)
- Oh, these are good, I haven't had
a graham cracker in a long time.
So this is actually quite nice.
(laughing)
(eating graham cracker)
(brushing table rhythmically)
- Maybe I'll come back to this.
Good practice, okay.
(tearing paper)
- Sometimes it takes a minute
for inspiration to come.
- It does.
- Writing a quality dad joke is like
any work of art, you know?
It takes time.
Commitment to your writing style.
Delivery is very important.
I am concerned that, in my
delivery of Diego's dad joke,
I may not give you the
true essence of the humor
in my voice, so, you know.
We'll see how this goes.
- That's good.
(paper crumpling)
All right.
(paper crumpling)
Okay.
(laughing)
Okay, sorry, okay.
I had, okay, here we go, here we go,
we're gonna do it, here's the joke.
Scene.
I had an idea for an
international garment store
that sells things like robes and gowns
from all sorts of places.
I'd call it Sari, Not Sari.
(paper crumpling)
Sari is spelled S-A-R-I.
That's why it's funny.
- Okay.
At least I know how you get that.
- I appreciate it.
(laughing)
Okay.
We definitely bit off
more than we could chew
with this idea, but, you know,
I'm happy to go through
it with y'all together.
So, this is Diego and Tiffany's kitchen.
Uh, yeah.
(laughing)
This is your kitchen.
- It's the back part, we don't cook here.
- Yeah, this is the
back part of the kitchen
that they don't cook at.
This is the part where they eat.
(laughing)
Oh God.
You might call it a dining room.
- Dining nook, maybe.
- Dining nook.
And this table is from IKEA.
It's a really cool table, actually.
I really want one.
And on this table I am
having some lovely...
(cup scraping across table)
Tea that Tiffany brewed
for me for this video.
(slurping tea)
It's very nice.
It's a beautiful Sunday
here in Austin, Texas.
We actually used to live,
they were our neighbors
when we lived here in Austin.
And as you all know, we now live
in San Antonio, but we
come up to visit them,
and they come down to visit us
whenever they can, when there's time.
So it's a lovely relationship.
We have a long-distance friendship.
But it's great.
- A classic Diego special.
(paper tearing)
(cup scraping across table)
(paper crumpling)
- Thank you, sir.
(paper crumpling)
(laughing)
Okay, okay.
This is so bad.
Why is Go-Gurt not
popular as a health food?
It's a little off-pudding.
Pudding, like P-U-D-D-I-N-G,
pudding that way.
Pudding.
(paper tearing)
Do you wanna?
(paper crumpling)
Thank you.
(paper crumpling)
All right.
All right.
Okay.
So these are all, like,
before we tell this dad joke.
These are all restaurant
ideas, essentially,
that you have?
- We do think of restaurants a lot.
- Okay.
- Me and Tiffany.
- Yeah.
- We like food.
- Okay, yeah.
- I think more than other people do.
- I don't know, that might not be true.
- No, but it's interesting
to see just, like,
what motivates you, you know?
- It does.
- To have a good dad joke.
And these are all very restaurant-themed.
I like it, okay.
So here we go.
I like the idea of a sandwich shop
whose mission is to set the standard
by which sandwiches are made.
Best sauces, best meats, best baguettes.
I would it call it The Sub Standard.
(paper crumpling)
I like that one.
I like it.
- It's the standard.
- I like that there's--
- The Sub Standard
- Yeah, I like that there's a back story
- You get a true essence of, you know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(cup scraping across table)
(slurping tea)
Uh, in the comments below.
Let me know if you are an ASMR enthusiast,
if you dabble in creating ASMR content.
Let me know what audio situation,
what your setup is looking like for ASMR.
I have taken a very film approach
to this setup.
As you all know, I studied film at UT.
And I took some audio engineering classes
based around mixing for film,
but so much of this is auditory that
I feel like there's an aspect to this
I may be missing, so you know,
lemme know what microphones systems
you're using, you know,
are you using mixers
when you do this?
Just lemme know, in the comments below.
I'd be curious to see, you know,
let's talk tech, you know?
Let's talk tech for ASMR, you know?
Damn.
(tea pouring)
Thank you.
This, I just wanna say this video
is definitely a family affair production.
We have Mr. Hallease in the back
helping run the cameras.
We also have Tiffany, Diego's wife,
helping run the cameras,
and pouring tea as well.
So, you know.
This is a labor of love, definitely.
The four of us coming together.
Like, share, and subscribe.
If you haven't already.
(laughing)
Like, share, and, I never say that.
In any of my videos.
Like, share, and subscribe.
For more.
- This one's a hard one because
there's already one pun in it
that I think is really good.
- Okay.
- But I feel like
to make it really work, the second half
has to also be a pun.
- Okay.
So it sounds--
- It's just, ah man.
- Yeah, it sounds like
you're actually trying
to up your own ante a
little bit, you know?
- Maybe.
- Yeah.
I appreciate that, you know.
It's always good to strive for more.
(slurping tea)
- Yeah, I think with humor,
as in anything creative,
it's important to explore
the possibilities.
You might start with something small.
- Mm-hmm.
- And, you know, when you
first kind of put it out there
in a form, sometimes, like it sparks.
Something creative that
says, like, oh man, like.
And you see people do this a lot.
Somebody says something, and
everybody else just kind of...
- Yeah.
- Kind of building into it.
- Definitely, definitely.
- But yeah, part of it, too, is just.
It's the best I can make this joke.
- Yeah, I know it.
I totally get that, yeah.
All right, good.
(crumpling paper)
While Diego is meditating
on his dad joke--
- Yeah, could, it might help me focus.
- Okay.
(crumpling paper)
-  I just realized
I've been advertising
Buckethead IPA this whole time.
(crumpling paper)
Oh, it's not as nice a sound as I thought.
Do you mind if I rip your dad joke?
(laughing)
You do, you do, I won't
do it, I won't do it.
- That was a dad joke!
- What was he?
-  Don't rip your dad joke.
- Ripping my jokes!
(laughing)
- Oh, that's terrible.
An unforeseen, like,
really hard thing to do,
is laugh quietly.
This is really hard to laugh quietly.
I'm just gonna throw that over here.
-  I don't even know if
we're necessarily being quiet.
- I don't think we are.
In the comments below...
(laughing)
It's all about engagement on YouTube.
In the comments below, let us know
if we're being quiet enough.
(laughing)
(scratching paper)
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh, we got one?
- I think I have to pinch this one off.
- Okay, go ahead.
(tearing paper)
- This one rips differently.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
It ripped the wrong way.
(laughing)
(crumpling paper)
We'll call this one a work in progress.
- Okay.
I think after this one we'll do one more,
and I feel like we'll have a video.
- Oh, that's not bad.
- It's attached, my bad.
(crumpling paper)
I notice some of the new cars these days
don't sell quite as well
as the outgoing models.
I think it's because they
still haven't gotten out much.
(crumpling paper)
- Maybe someone will get it.
(laughing)
- I think somebody's gonna get it.
I think a car enthusiast
will love that joke.
- Yeah, we'll let that one sit for awhile.
- Yeah.
(scraping pencil)
- Just so I can write
nice tiny, tiny letters.
- There's nothing more, you know,
important than a nice,
sharp pencil, I find.
Whenever I decide to use a pencil.
(laughing)
It's been awhile since I've
used a pencil, actually.
I just realized that.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
(cup scraping across table)
(ice clinking)
So we're on our last
dad joke for the video.
And, uh, you know, creative
tensions are high over here.
I'm just gonna say that, because...
- Yeah, this is true.
- I feel like we've had some
pretty great ones so far,
and so you wanna end it on a good note.
But, I'm not gonna lie, I feel
a little creatively drained, actually.
(laughing)
While you're doing that,
I'm gonna experiment
with moving this cup
across the table a lot.
(cup scraping across table)
In the comments below, let me know
if that's working for y'all.
(laughing)
And there you go.
Also, if you're a dad joke enthusiast,
and you would like your
dad joke maybe featured
on the next video, in the comments below,
hit us with your best dad joke.
We'd love to read it and
possibly incorporate it.
- Doesn't even have to be the best,
as long as it's entertaining.
- You know, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's a good point.
I mean, obviously you're working through
a creative process over there.
Um, when you're trying
to think of a dad joke,
from scratch, I mean, it's
easy to riff off people, right?
- Yeah.
I think the thing about really good humor
is that it has to come
from life, you know?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- The more relatable it is for somebody,
you know, the more kind of
inviting and friendly it becomes.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Sometimes people joke about
things nobody knows about.
It's easy for that to get lost.
- Yeah, yeah.
- So that's why I'm really
glad you enjoyed the sari joke.
(laughing)
Not that we wear saris on a regular basis.
- Right.
- Or at all.
- Right.
- But we have friends who do.
- Yeah.
No, I totally get that.
So were you concerned that I, like,
would not understand
that part of the joke?
The sari?
- Um.
Less with you.
- Oh, okay.
- I think I've tried it with other people,
and it was a little bit lost on 'em.
- Yeah, okay, yeah.
Expand your world view.
- So if you don't know
what a sari is, look it up.
- Yeah.
It was a good joke.
It was, it might have been my favorite.
It might have been, actually.
- This one's pretty classically dumb.
(laughing)
- Okay.
(bouncing paper)
(tearing paper)
(crumpling paper)
You done?
Oh.
You packed this one
pretty tight, actually.
- Oh.
(laughing)
- So simple.
How do you make a burger too stale?
Use old buns.
Went out on a pin with that one.
- That's our second sandwich joke.
- That is our second sandwich joke.
(laughing)
All right.
Well, ladies and gentlemen.
This has been an attempt at ASMR by me.
Thank you so much, Diego, for providing
the content for this ASMR video.
Like we said, in the comments below,
let us know how you felt about this.
(laughing)
In general.
Constructive criticism
is always appreciated
on this channel, and let
me know if you would like
to see more ASMR videos.
With or without Diego.
Preferably with, I think preferably with.
- I enjoyed being here.
- Yeah, I hope you did.
And, uh, I'll see you when I see you.
Diego, would you like to?
- Uh.
- Say your goodbyes.
- I don't know if I have much to add.
I appreciate being on the video.
I enjoyed my time here, and I
hope you all enjoyed it, too.
- All right, see you when we see you.
Bye.
