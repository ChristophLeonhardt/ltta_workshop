look at this here's a couple of tweets about a forum let me just read the full tweet this is by Melissa Chen who runs sort of a think-tank let's call it she says please join us today at Harvard University for an ideas Beyond Borders campus events on free speech titled dissent from minorities within minorities okay and then she adds at least a few words she says you might have noticed the unnecessarily convoluted topic reminiscent of 4d chess this is deliberate and she has one more tweet and let me just read it she says because we were warned not to have the phrase free speech in naming our event lest the Student Union disapprove it the rationale free speech is now a dog whistle to the far right by the way this is a visible minority young woman I mean she's checking all the boxes in terms of politically correct racial and gender theory she was told at Harvard the highest heights of learning if you say free speech you'll be banned because we all know the only free speech is out there you all right Nazis who happen to be young Chinese students I mean it's crazy it is crazy and it also doesn't seem like a very good strategy to me because ultimately if you say that you know far-right people are the people who believe in free speech then people are going to start to say well gee that sounds like a good idea to me I may have to join the far-right I think you know this is the they have gotten themselves in a bind but it is not on it's widespread it really is widespread you shouldn't forget that Hillary Clinton who came very very close to winning the presidency of this country was fervently anti-free speech fervently anti the First Amendment she crusaded and crusaded against the Citizens United decision which allowed corporations to speak freely during an election during election time and if that that case had been overturned which was defended by one of our famous liberal free speech attorneys if it overturn this first amendment would have been seriously compromised you know when I lived in England they used to make fun of us for have and make fun of Americans to me for having a written constitution why do you need a written constitution but in England now if you criticize Islam they come in car to away that's why that's why we wrote our our rules down and that's why free speech is the First Amendment because it really doesn't need protection all the time that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
