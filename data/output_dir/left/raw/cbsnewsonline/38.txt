WE'RE SPEAKING UP LIKE NOBODY

191
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:16,295

192
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:21,667
THEY WANT TO GET THE THAT

193
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,236

00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:27,073

AWAY FROM THEM.

197
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,813
ALL THE DEMOCRATS KNOW, AND ALL

00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,049
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IS DESTRUCT,

199
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,150
DEMOLISH, DESTROY, AND DELAY.

THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY

201
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,558
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SINCE THE VERY

202
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,795
FIRST SECOND HE WAS ANNOUNCED.

203
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,998
BECAUSE THEY KNOW JUDGE

204
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,600
KAVANAUGH WILL FOLLOW THE

205
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:16,354

COURT.

217
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,254
I'VE HEARD THAT FOR A LONG TIME.

218
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,956
AND LOT OF SMART PEOPLE.

219
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:54,360

HE'S LED A LIFE THAT'S

223
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,103
UNBELIEVABLE.

224
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,470
HE'S HAD NO PROBLEMS.

225
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,772
THEY'VE NEVER TAKEN HIM OUT OF

226
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,072
RESTAURANTS.

227
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,507
THIS IS LIKE A PERSON THAT

228
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,343
EVERYBODY THOUGHT AT THE HIGHEST

229
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:14,012

HE WILL BE A JUSTICE OF THE

233
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,855
SUPREME COURT.

234
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,691
AND ALL MY LIFE I'VE HEARD THAT

235
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,094
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT A

236
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,962
PRESIDENT HAS TO DO AS PRESIDENT

237
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:35,968
IS THE APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME

238
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,534
COURT JUSTICE.

239
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:38,336
AND I DISAGREE.

240
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,840
I THINK WAR, I THINK OUR

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,908
MILITARY, I THINK PEACE, I THINK

242
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,444
THOSE THINGS ARE, YOU KNOW,

243
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,948
THOSE THINGS ARE PRETTY

244
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,583
IMPORTANT.

245
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,083
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

246
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,251
THEY DON'T SAY THAT.

247
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,886
BUT I SAY THOSE THINGS ARE

248
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:54,319
PRETTY IMPORTANT.

249
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,288
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE

250
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:03,362
APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT

251
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,033
JUSTICE AND I LOOK AT HIM, AND I

252
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,635
LOOK AT THE MAN I APPOINTED JUST

253
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:15,307
BEFORE HIM, JUSTICE NEIL

254
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:15,574
GORSUCH.

255
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,208
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

256
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:16,909
>> WHO WAS PUT THROUGH THE

257
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,179
PACES, BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT'S

258
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,512
HAPPENING NOW.

259
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,149
IT'S JUST CRAZED.

260
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:23,883
IT'S CRAZY.

261
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:28,654
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

262
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,356
GANG RAPE, A GANG RAPE.

263
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:30,822
MANY TIMES.

264
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,091
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE.

265
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:36,328
SO MANY DIFFERENT CHARGES.

266
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,963
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT

267
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,499
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR

268
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:40,732
COUNTRY.

269
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:44,069
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR

270
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,737
COUNTRY.

271
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,438
AND I HAVE IT MYSELF ALL THE

272
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:46,638
TIME.

273
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,375
BUT FOR ME IT'S LIKE A PART OF

274
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,676
THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

275
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,245
LET IT HAPPEN TO ME.

276
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,680
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM.

277
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,548
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM.

278
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:59,185
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH, 36

279
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,187
YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED.

280
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,956
I HAD ONE BEER, RIGHT?

281
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:08,761
I HAD ONE BEER.

282
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,329
WELL -- NOPE, IT WAS ONE BEER.

283
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,831
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?

284
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,797
I DON'T REMEMBER.

285
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,199
WHERE IS THE PLACE?

286
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,367
I DON'T REMEMBER.

287
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,469
HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS IT?

288
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,204
I DON'T KNOW.

289
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,573
I DON'T KNOW.

290
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,109
I DON'T KNOW.

291
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,578
WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IT AND I

292
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,848
DON'T KNOW, WHERE'S THE HOUSE, I

293
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,148
DON'T KNOW.

294
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,549
UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, WHERE WAS

295
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:30,850
IT?

296
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,517
I DON'T KNOW.

297
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,518
BUT I HAD ONE BEER.

298
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:36,255
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I

299
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:36,655
REMEMBER.

300
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,124
AND A MAN'S LIFE IS IN TATTERS.

301
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,859
A MAN'S LIFE IS SHATTERED.

302
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:43,128
HIS WIFE IS SHATTERED.

303
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,633
HIS DAUGHTERS WHO ARE BEAUTIFUL,

304
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,601
INCREDIBLE YOUNG KIDS THEY

305
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,167
DESTROY PEOPLE.

306
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,204
THEY WANT TO DESTROY PEOPLE.

307
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,705
THESE ARE REALLY EVIL PEOPLE.

308
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:58,844
AND THEN YOU SEE THE PEOPLE THAT

309
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,112
ARE DOING IT.

310
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,549
I KNOW EVERY ONE.

311
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,885
I COULD TELL YOU THINGS ABOUT

312
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,754
EVERY ONE OF THEM.

313
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,990
DA NANG, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL.

314
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,993
THIS GUY LIED ABOUT HIS SERVICE.

315
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,229
HE DIDN'T JUST SAY, GEE, I WAS

316
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,363
IN THE SERVICE.

317
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:18,530
NO.

318
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,334
HE SAID I WAS IN THE MARINES.

319
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,502
DA NANG PROVINCE.

320
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:24,603
SOLDIERS DYING LEFT AND RIGHT AS

321
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:25,938
WE BATTLED UP THE HILL.

322
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,506
THIS WENT ON FOR 15 YEARS WHEN

323
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,009
HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

324
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,309
CONNECTICUT.

325
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,144
I THOUGHT HE WAS A GREAT WAR

326
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:32,845
HERO.

327
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,881
AND THEN IT TURNED OUT HE WAS

328
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,984
NEVER IN VIETNAM.

329
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,687
HE WAS IN THE RESERVES.

330
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,924
AND I WATCHED HIM TWO DAYS AGO,

331
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:49,929
I WATCHED HIM SAYING WE NEED THE

332
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,129
TRUTH.

333
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,230
IF WE DON'T HAVE -- AND HERE'S A

334
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,899
GUY WHO IS SAYING PEOPLE WERE

335
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,035
DYING ALL AROUND HIM AND HE WAS

336
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,903
NEVER THERE.

337
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,405
AND THEN HE CRIED WHEN THEY

338
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,105
CAUGHT HIM.

339
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:08,981
HE CRIED LIKE A BABY, LIKE A

340
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,117
BABY.

341
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,854
WHEN JIMMY SWAGGER TRIED, IT WAS

342
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:19,124
NOTHING COMPARED TO DA NANG

343
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:19,524
RICHARD, NOTHING.

344
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:25,798
JIMMY SWAGGERT WAS NOTHING.

345
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,900
HE ONLY LIED FOR 15 YEARS AND

346
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
NOW HE GETS UP.

347
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,403
AND NOW HE TALKS ABOUT LYING.

348
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,273
AND THIS MAN'S NOT LYING.

349
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:37,609
SO BLUMENTHAL IS A FRAUD.

350
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,378
HE'S A FRAUD.

351
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:43,282
AND THE REASON HE GOT ELECTED IS

352
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,384
BECAUSE IN CONNECTICUT IT'S

353
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,887
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A REPUBLICAN TO

354
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,386
GET ELECTED.

355
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,488
AND I DID WELL THERE.

356
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,522
BUT YOU CAN'T.

357
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,524
HE ACTUALLY GAVE UP THE RACE.

358
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,159
YOU THOUGHT HE LOST.

359
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,661
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

360
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,228
HE STOPPED CAMPAIGNING.

361
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:56,862
IT WAS OVER.

362
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,031
AND THEN HE WON BY THREE POINTS.

363
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,867
AND WE HAVE HIM IN THE SENATE.

364
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,537
AND NOW HE'S THIS GREAT,

365
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:05,870
HONORABLE GUY.

366
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,072
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

367
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,306
THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T EVER WANT

368
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:09,474
TO PUT THAT STUFF ON.

369
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:14,146
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

370
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:14,380
IT.

371
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,682
THEY DON'T EVER WANT TO PUT IT

372
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:16,848
ON.

373
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:18,250
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF FAKERS.

374
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,490
AND THEN YOU HAVE CORY BOOKER,

375
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:24,857
RIGHT?

376
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,724
CORY BOOKER.

377
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:30,129
HERE'S A GUY WHO DESTROYED

378
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,732
PRACTICALLY BY HIMSELF THE CITY

379
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:34,733
OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY.

380
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,134
HE WAS SUCH A BAD MAYOR.

381
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,537
AND SEE WHAT HE WROTE HIMSELF

382
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:38,937
ABOUT WOMEN.

383
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,939
CHECK IT OUT, FOLKS.

384
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,907
CHECK IT OUT.

385
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,542
THAT HE TALKS HOW DARE YOU TREAT

386
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,843
A WOMAN LIKE THAT.

387
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,812
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS GUY

388
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,012
WROTE.

389
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,680
AND I KNOW ABOUT EVERY ONE OF

390
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:48,880
THEM.

391
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,950
I COULD GO ON AND ON.

392
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,318
HOW ABOUT FEINSTEIN?

393
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,723
HOW ABOUT HER?

394
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:01,126
WE NEED MORE TIME FOR THE FBI.

395
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,163
THE FBI HAS TO DO A MORE

396
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,163
THOROUGH SEARCH.

397
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:08,300
WE HAD ANOTHER WOMAN JUST

398
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,837
REPORTED BY A SLEAZE BAG LAWYER

399
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:20,846
NAMED AVENUE NATTY -- AVENUE --

400
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:24,016
AVENUE NAT

401
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,652
NATTY -- EVEN NBC COULDN'T

402
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,387
SHIELD HER WITH THAT INTERVIEW.

403
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,322
THIS WOMAN HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS

404
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,022
GOING ON.

405
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:31,423
NO CLUE.

406
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,861
AND YET SHE MADE THE MOST

407
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,363
HORRIBLE CHARGES AGAINST A

408
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,332
NUMBER ONE IN HIS CLASS AT YALE,

409
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,433
PERFECT HUMAN BEING.

410
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,867
GREAT FATHER, GREAT HUSBAND.

411
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,571
THIS IS A GREAT PERSON.

412
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,840
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL MAYBE

413
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,106
IT'S TRUE.

414
00:16:48,106 --> 00:16:49,975
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

415
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,378
MAYBE IT'S TRUE HE SHOULD NOT

416
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,814
BECOME A UNITED STATES SUPREME

417
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,147
COURT JUSTICE.

418
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,449
HOW HORRIBLE IS THIS?

419
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:02,287
HOW HORRIBLE IS THIS?

420
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,323
SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR

421
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:04,922
OUR COUNTRY.

422
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:08,292
THIS IS A TIME WHEN YOUR FATHER,

423
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,462
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND, WHEN YOUR

424
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,565
BROTHER, WHEN YOUR SON COULD DO

425
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:13,866
GREAT.

426
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,433
MOM, I DID GREAT IN SCHOOL.

427
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:17,102
I'VE WORKED SO HARD.

428
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,104
MOM, I'M SO PLEASED TO TELL YOU

429
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,406
I JUST GOT A FANTASTIC JOB WITH

430
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:22,574
IBM.

431
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,978
I JUST GOT A FANTASTIC JOB WITH

432
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:26,578
GENERAL MOTORS.

433
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,481
I JUST GOT, I'M SO PROUD.

434
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,518
MOM, A TERRIBLE THING JUST

435
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:32,784
HAPPENED.

436
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:34,486
A PERSON WHO I'VE NEVER MET SAID

437
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,322
THAT I DID THINGS THAT WERE

438
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:37,589
HORRIBLE.

439
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,891
AND THEY'RE FIRING ME FROM MY

440
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,558
JOB, MOM.

441
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,359
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

442
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,493
MOM, WHAT DO I DO?

443
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:46,798
WHAT DO I DO, MOM?

444
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:52,104
WHAT DO I DO, MOM?

445
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:57,476
IT'S A SAD SITUATION, OKAY?

446
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,212
AND WE BETTER START AS A CO

447
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,282
GETTING SMART AND GETTING TOUGH

448
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,217
AND NOT LETTING THAT STUFF RIGHT

449
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,985
BACK THERE ALL THOSE CAMERAS

450
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:14,426
TELL US HOW TO LIVE OUR LIVES.

451
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,427
BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY

452
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,027
DISHONEST PEOPLE.

453
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:18,129
NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT WELL

454
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:18,964
MOST OF THEM.

455
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:23,402
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.

456
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:23,669
FAKE NEWS.

457
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,205
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK

458
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,205
ABOUT, RIGHT?

459
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:27,605
THAT'S SOMETHING.

460
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:28,907
THINK OF YOUR SON.

461
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,242
THINK OF YOUR HUSBAND.

462
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:33,878
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

463
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,580
I'VE HAD IT -- I'VE HAD SO MANY.

464
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,051
AND WHEN I SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN,

465
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:39,684
NOBODY BELIEVES ME.

466
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,252
BUT IT'S ME.

467
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:42,987
IT'S MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

468
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:43,855
IT'S TRUMP, IT'S OKAY.

469
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,390
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

470
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,259
THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT

471
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,161
ABOUT ME, IT'S FINE.

472
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,697
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WORST LIABLE

473
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,634
LAWS ANYWHERE IN THE -- LIBEL

474
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,936
LAWS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

475
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,439
IF YOU'RE FAMOUS YOU CAN'T SUE.

476
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,007
FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

477
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,409
BUT TAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST

478
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,912
OUTSTANDING HAVE JUST HAD GREAT

479
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,079
LIVES, AND THAT LIFE DOESN'T

<font color="#FF00FF"><u>EAN A THING.</u></font>

481
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,883
AND YOU NOTICE WITH THE JUDGE

482
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,720
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT HIS LAST

483
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,854
35 YEARS.

484
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,990
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT --

485
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,957
EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM.

486
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,293
HE'S A WELL KNOWN, HIGHLY

487
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:21,693
RESPECTED PERSON.

488
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,562
UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS

489
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,997
BECAUSE THEY'RE DESTROYING HIM

490
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,131
AND THEY'RE DESTROYING HIS

491
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,533
REPUTATION AND WE CAN'T LET THAT

492
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:28,867
HAPPEN.

493
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,834
WE CAN'T.

494
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:33,571
CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

495
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:34,205
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

496
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,241
>> AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM,

497
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:36,441
FOLKS.

498
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,442
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

499
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,911
I MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME A

500
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:40,579
FEW WEEKS AGO.

501
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,447
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

502
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,483
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO PROTECT

503
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:44,750
MY FRIEND.

504
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,452
I WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR

505
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:47,919
THIS COUNTRY.

506
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,023
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR

507
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,723
COUNTRY.

508
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,290
VERY IMPORTANT THING.

509
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,128
VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR

510
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:56,695
COUNTRY.

511
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,263
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BECOME

512
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:58,696
TOO EXTREME.

513
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,164
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF IT.

514
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:04,903
AND TOO DANGEROUS TO BE TRUSTED

515
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:05,336
WITH POWER.

516
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,339
THAT IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE

517
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,440
REPUBLICAN ON ELECTION DAY.

518
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:22,321
AND YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE.

519
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,821
I'M LISTENING TO COMMENTATORS.

520
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,157
THEY'RE SAYING IF TRUMP IS

521
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,758
RUNNING HE'S GOING TO BEAT

522
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:27,125
EVERYBODY.

523
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:27,959
THEY'RE SAYING THAT.

524
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:30,696
AND I DREAM ABOUT ALL THESE

525
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,130
PEOPLE, BIDEN, THE GUY WHO NEVER

526
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,499
HAD MORE THAN 1% IN A POLL WHEN

527
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,401
HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND

528
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,270
THEN OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE

529
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,870
TRASH HEAP.

530
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,472
I HEAR BIDEN WANTS TO TAKE ME TO

531
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:41,573
THE BACK OF A BARN.

532
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,508
HE WOULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE, I

533
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,309
WILL TELL YOU.

534
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,577
REMEMBER HE SAID THAT?

535
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:51,650
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM.

536
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,753
YOU KNOW, WITH BIDEN YOU GO LIKE

537
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:54,953
THIS.

538
00:20:54,953 --> 00:21:00,926
AND HE GOES DOWN.

539
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:08,033
BIDEN AND THE OTHER ONES.

540
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,368
BUT THEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP

541
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,236
ISN'T RUNNING, SO WILL THE

542
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,704
PEOPLE GO OUT AND VOTE?

543
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,740
YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE.

544
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,242
AND THEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP

545
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:17,975
DOESN'T LIKE CONGRESS.

546
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:18,810
I REALLY DO.

547
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,314
I LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

548
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:22,581
CONGRESS.

549
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,149
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN SOME OF

550
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,349
THEM.

551
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,751
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU

552
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,852
SOMETHING, WE HAVE THE RIGHT

553
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,587
IDEAS, WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT

554
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:28,787
THING.

555
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,988
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES.

556
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,324
THEY SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY.

557
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,724
WE BARELY HAVE -- IF SOMEBODY

558
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:35,694
HAS A COLD AND STAYS HOME, WE

559
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,694
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY.

560
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:42,133
THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS.

561
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:43,668
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GO OUT AND

562
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:43,868
VOTE.

563
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,604
THEY SAY IF I WAS ON THE TICKET

564
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,370
EVERYBODY WOULD GO.

565
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,206
IT WOULD BE A LANDSLIDE.

566
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,775
EVEN THE FAKERS BACK THERE, THEY

567
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,175
SAY THAT.

568
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,610
AND I'M NOT ON THE TICKET, BUT I

569
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,478
AM ON THE TICKET.

570
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,180
BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A

571
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,149
REFERENDUM ABOUT ME AND THE

572
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,717
DISGUSTING GRIDLOCK THAT THEY'LL

573
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,617
PUT THIS COUNTRY THROUGH.

574
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:00,218
THINK OF IT.

575
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:04,122
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN

576
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:04,355
HISTORY.

577
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,825
WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT WILL

578
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:15,701
SOON BE THE STRONGEST WE'VE EVER

579
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:15,867
HAD.

580
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,469
OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL.

581
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,170
AND THEN WE HAVE A MAXINE WATERS

582
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,873

583
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:22,073
HIM.

584
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:24,709
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM.

585
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,910
MAXINE WATERS.

586
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,046
AND NANCY PELOSI.

587
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,013
SHE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.

588
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:29,814
GET OUT AND VOTE.

589
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,983

BELIEVE.

595
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,799
A COUPLE OF THE REPORTERS I SEE

596
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,802
BACK THERE, THEY SAID, OH, TRUMP

597
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,370

598
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,172
I MUST SAY, ONE OF THEM SAID,

599
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:58,176
RIGHT AFTER I ANNOUNCED, JUNE

600
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:58,376
16TH.

601
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,644
IT WAS A SUNDAY MORNING SHOW,

602
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,113
AND ONE OF THEM SAID, YOU KNOW,

603
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:05,517
HE'S GOING TO WIN, DON'T YOU?

604
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,852
AND ANOTHER ONE THAT'S BACK

605
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,686

00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:11,056
WELL, SAID ALONG WITH THE HOST

00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,124
OH OH OH, YOU'RE ONLY KIDDING.

608
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:14,359
HE'S DOING THIS FOR FUN.

609
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,994
YOU THINK THIS IS FUN ?

610
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,897
YEAH, ACTUALLY IT'S SORT -- FUN?

611
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,766
YEAH, ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF FUN.

612
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,133
YES, IT IS.

613
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,468
FOR ME IT'S FUN.

614
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,869
FOR ME IT'S FUN.

615
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,738
YOU KNOW WHY IT'S FUN?

616
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,306
BECAUSE WE'RE ACHIEVING OUR

617
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,875
GOALS BETTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT

618
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,141
POSSIBLE.

619
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,543
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUN.

620
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:36,114
IF I WASN'T IT WOULDN'T BE FUN.

621
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,549
BUT THIS ONE PARTICULAR

622
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:37,816
REPORTER.

623
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,685
SHE SAID OH OH OH, YOU'RE ONLY

624
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:41,052
KIDDING, RIGHT?

625
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,253
HA HA, THAT'S SO FUNNY.

626
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,389
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET ON

627
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:44,756
ELECTION NIGHT.

628
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:51,463
DONALD TRUMP IS YOUR NEXT

629
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,099
PRESIDENT, FOLKS.

630
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,168
AND IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY.

631
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,570
SO WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE

632
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:58,803
TONIGHT.

633
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,238
AND I AM HAVING A LOT OF FUN.

634
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:04,442
BUT IT IS TRUE, I'M HAVING FUN

635
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,343
BECAUSE NOBODY EVER WOULD HAVE

636
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,612
BELIEVED IN A MILLION YEARS THAT

637
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:12,417
WE WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT

638
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,484
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

639
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:14,986
NOBODY HAS ACCOMPLISHED MORE IN

640
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,555
TWO YEARS.

641
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,090
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST TWO

642
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,525
YEARS OF ANY -- NOBODY HAS EVEN

643
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,062
COME CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISHING WHAT

644
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:24,595
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

645
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:26,064
AND I'M DOING IT FOR YOU, AND

646
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,198
WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE

647
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:28,767
THIS IS A WHOLE THING THAT HAS

648
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,635
NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY

649
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,169
BEFORE.

650
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,537
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.

651
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,005
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THERE WERE

652
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,707
A LOT OF PEOPLE ALWAYS SHOWING

653
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:35,907
UP.

654
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,275
AND BY THE WAY, YOU THINK THIS

655
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,843
IS A BIG CROWD IN HERE.

656
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,713
THIS PLACE IS PACKED, RIGHT?

657
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,115
AND IF THERE WAS ONE EMPTY SEAT,

658
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,650
THEY WOULD SAY, AS "THE

659
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,386
WASHINGTON POST" DID SAY, "THE

660
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,790

661
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,356
THAT, RIGHT?

662
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:56,494
CAME TO AN ARENA SOMEPLACE, FOUR

663
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,263
HOURS EARLY, AND THEY HBT

664
00:24:59,263 --> 00:25:00,064
STARTED LETTING -- HADN'T

665
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:01,766
STARTED LETTING THE PEOPLE IN

666
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:01,932
YET.

667
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,902
AND HE PUT A PICTURE OF AN

668
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:05,136
ARENA.

669
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,705
THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

670
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,373
PEOPLE OUTSIDE WAITING TO COME

671
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:08,540
IN.

672
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,474
"THE WASHINGTON POST" PUT A

673
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,177
PICTURE OF AN EMPTY ARENA AND

674
00:25:13,177 --> 00:25:16,982
THEY PUT A CAPTION TO THE EFFECT

675
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,284
MR. PRESIDENT, NOT A VERY GOOD

676
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,885
CROWD, IS IT?

677
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:23,254
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

678
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:28,226
AND THEY HAD A PICTURE UP OF AN

679
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,060
EMPTY ARENA.

680
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,261
I DIDN'T EVEN LAND FOR FOUR AND

681
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,329
A HALF HOURS LATER.

682
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,465
AND WHEN I LANDED THAT PLACE WAS

683
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,299
JUST LIKE THIS.

684
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,270
IT WAS PACKED WITH THOUSANDS OF

685
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,037
PEOPLE OUTSIDE.

686
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:43,007
NOW, DID THEY FIRE THAT

687
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:43,274
REPORTER?

688
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:43,441
NO.

689
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:49,847
DID THEY FIRE THAT REPORTER?

690
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:50,014
NO.

691
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:50,214
RIGHT?

692
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,749
THEY -- ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

693
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,184
ISN'T IT SAD?

694
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,555
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO

695
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:56,821
ROSEANNE.

696
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,990
DID THEY FIRE ROSEANNE, YES.

697
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,124
NO, BUT THINK OF IT.

698
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,693
PUTS A PICTURE OF AN EMPTY, 5%.

699
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,062
PEOPLE WERE JUST STARTING 20

700
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:04,528
TRICKLE IN.

701
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,065
AND SAID NOT A VERY GOOD CROWD

702
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,532
MR. PRESIDENT.

703
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,600
THERE WAS NO GAMES.

704
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,002
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT

705
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:11,870
NIGHT?

706
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,471
PEOPLE THAT WERE SITTING ON

707
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,507
STAIRWELLS, PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T

708
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,841
GET A SEAT, PEOPLE THAT WERE

709
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,411
HERE ONLY BECAUSE THE

710
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,878
MARSHALS WERE SO INCREDIBLE,

711
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:23,415
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO

712
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,181
COME IN.

713
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:24,715
THOUSANDS OUTSIDE.

714
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,150
THEY SAID THIS IS A FRAUD BY

715
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,684
"THE WASHINGTON POST."

716
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,252
I WAS

717
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:27,686
THERE.

718
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,254
THERE WERE NO EMPTY SEATS.

719
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,490
WE SET A RECORD THAT EVENING FOR

720
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,424
CROWD ATTENDANCE.

721
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:36,661
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED MUCH OF A

722
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:36,861
STAGE.

723
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,463
BASKETBALL THEY NEED A BIG --

724
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,630
YOU'RE FILLED UP WITH PEOPLE

725
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,098
LIKE IT IS TONIGHT.

726
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,334
AND WE BARELY GOT AN APOLOGY.

727
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,435
HE ADMITTED HE WAS WRONG.

728
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,705
YOU KNOW WHERE HE DID IT?

729
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,306
ON HIS LITTLE TWITTER ACCOUNT.

730
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,308
AND THAT KIND OF DISHONESTY

731
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,344
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

732
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,378
HAPPENED AT THE INAUGURATION.

733
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:58,182
IT HAPPENED AT THE INAUGURATION.

734
00:26:58,182 --> 00:26:59,050
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

735
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,785
THESE ARE VERY VERY DISHONEST

736
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,018
PEOPLE.

737
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:03,922
WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED

738
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,625
TONIGHT BY SEVERAL GREAT

739
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,058
REPUBLICAN LEADERS.

740
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,195
AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A

741
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,030
FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A VERY

742
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,831
SPECIAL MAN.

743
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,332
VERY SPECIAL.

744
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,735
HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR, DONE A

745
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,769
FANTASTIC JOB.

746
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,503
HE CALLED ME.

747
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:21,605

MUSEUM, CALLED ME.

749
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:23,407
WE WENT THERE.

750
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,742

YOU KNOW WE HAD A GREAT FRIEND

940
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,888
IN THE SENATE.

941
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,857
AND DID A FANTASTIC JOB.

942
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,159
AND IT WAS JUST HIS TIME.

943
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,860
HE CALLED ME.

944
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,028
IT WAS HIS TIME.

945
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,197
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT,

946
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,332
WONDERFUL MAN.

947
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,767
AND HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

948
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,368
TO APPOINT SOMEBODY.

949
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,403
AND I WENT TO PHIL.

950
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,806
I SAID PHIL, WHO'S THE BEST?

951
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,742
AND PHIL HAD NO DOUBT IN HIS

952
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,877
MIND THAT'S WHO HE RECOMMENDED.

953
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:48,746
AND SINCE THEN CINDY HAS VOTED

954
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:55,653
WITH ME 100% OF THE TIME.

955
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,221
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.

956
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,623
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK.

957
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:01,959
AND A VOTE FOR CINDY IS A VOTE

958
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:08,899
FOR ME AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT

959
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:13,037
AGAIN.

960
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,574
AND A VOTE FOR CINDY'S OPPONENT,

961
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:20,544
MIKE ESPY, IS A VOTE FOR CHUCK

962
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:27,118
SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI, AND THE

963
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:31,656
LEGENDARY LOW IQ PERSON, MAXINE

964
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,657
WATERS.

965
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:38,429
THAT'S WHY SCHUMER'S PACK IS

966
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,899
FUNDING MIKE ESPY WITH A LOT OF

967
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,099
MONEY.

968
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,169
A VOTE FOR ESP XRSHGS IS A VOTE

969
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,573
FOR THE DEM -- ESPY IS A VOTE

970
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:52,843
FOR DEMOCRATS TO OPEN BORDERS

971
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,745
AND RADICAL SOCIALISM.

972
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,682
WHEN ESPY WAS IN CONGRESS HE

973
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,687
SPONSORED LEGISLATION ALONGSIDE

974
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,387
NANCY PELOSI.

975
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,122
THAT'S JUST WHAT MISSISSIPPI

976
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:05,322
WANTS.

977
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,091
I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS IN

978
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:07,491
MISSISSIPPI.

979
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:07,891
DOES THAT WORK?

980
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:08,859
I DON'T THINK SO.

981
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:10,260
I DON'T THINK SO.

982
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,233
YOUR VOTE IN THIS ELECTION WILL

983
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,533
DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE

984
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:17,902
UNITED STATES SENATE.

985
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:23,908
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

986
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,275
VERY IMPORTANT.

987
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,275
THAT'S A GREAT WOMAN.

988
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,677
THAT'S A GREAT WOMAN.

989
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,111
GOTTEN TO KNOW HER VERY WELL

990
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:31,248
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS.

991
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,150
IF DEMOCRAS GET CONTROL, THEY

992
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,385
WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES, FLOOD

993
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,654
YOUR STREETS WITH CRIMINAL

994
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,090
ALIENS, WEAKEN OUR MILITARY,

AND REPLACE FREEDOM WITH

997
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:48,866
SOCIALISM.

IN RA SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,

999
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,703

00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,538

00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,708
LOTS, SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH,

1002
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,411
THEY WILL TURN AMERICA INTO

1003
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:00,911
VENEZUELA.

1004
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,581
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT?

1005
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:06,250
AND OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE

1006
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:06,517
VENEZUELA.

1007
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,218
WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

1008
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:12,656
IF DEMOCRATS GET 51 SEATS, THE

1009
00:38:12,656 --> 00:38:14,659
KEY SENATE COMMITTEES WILL BE

1010
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,928
RUN BY THE FAR LEFT.

1011
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,765
BERNIE SANDERS.

1012
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:21,465
CRAZY BERNIE.

1013
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,033
IT'S AMAZING THAT HE WASN'T MORE

1014
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,435
ANGRY THAT THE ELECTION GOT

1015
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,536
STOLEN FROM HIM.

1016
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,736
I DON'T GET IT.

1017
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:29,106
HE'S ALWAYS LIKE COMPLAINING,

1018
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,574
COMPLAINING, HE'S JUMPING

1019
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:30,807
AROUND.

1020
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,310
THE HAIR'S GOING CRAZY.

1021
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,312
THE HAIR'S GOING CRAZY.

1022
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,882
HE'S JUMPING LIKE A LUNATIC.

1023
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,949
BUT HE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT

1024
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,651
THE FACT THAT CROOKED HILLARY

1025
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,788
CHEATED HIM OUT OF THE ELECTION.

1026
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:49,826
IT'S AMAZING.

1027
00:38:49,826 --> 00:39:04,742
IT'S AMAZING.

1028
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,411
YOU KNOW, BERNIE WAS ON

1029
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:07,844
TELEVISION RECENTLY.

1030
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,246
AND HE WAS SCREAMING AND RANTING

1031
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:09,813
AND RAVING.

1032
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:12,115
AND I SAID TO MY WIFE, MELANIA,

1033
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:15,319
WHO'S NOW IN AFRICA REPRESENTING

1034
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,856
US, FIRST LADY.

1035
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,159
I WATCHED HER GET OFF THAT PLANE

1036
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:24,762
THIS MORNING IN AFRICA AND SO

1037
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:25,029
BEAUTIFUL.

1038
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,897
AND SHE WAS HUGGING AND KISSING

1039
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:27,164
CHILDREN.

1040
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,298
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE.

1041
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:30,434
SHE'S DOING A GREAT JOB AS FIRST

1042
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:36,473

00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:36,907

AND YOU THINK THAT'S AN EASY

1045
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,243
JOB.

1046
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:40,778
THAT'S NOT AN EASY JOB.

1047
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,746
THAT'S A TOUGH JOB.

1048
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,014
SHE'S FANTASTIC.

1049
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,950
BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS RAPTING

1050
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,518

1054
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:53,591
WHAT'S HE GOING TO STOP?

1055
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,759
A STRONG MILITARY?

1056
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,027
LOW TAXES?

1057
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:57,460

1058
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,596
WHAT AM I DOING?

1059
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,831
WHAT IS HE GOING TO STOP?

1060
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,632
HAVING LESS REGULATION?

1061
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,266
BUT HE'S GOING TO STOP TRUMP.

1062
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:06,237
HE'S GOING TO STOP US LEFT AND

1063
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:06,437
RIGHT.

1064
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,071
HE'S RANTING AND RAVING.

1065
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:10,274
AND THE COMMENTATOR LOOKS AT HIM

1066
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,844
AND GOES, YOU KNOW HE'S WINNING

1067
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:14,311

1068
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,480
AND BERNIE JUST LOOKED AT HIM

1069
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,880
LIKE THIS.

1070
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,785
IT WAS LIKE -- YOU GOT TO HAND

00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,856
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

1074
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,992
YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM.

1075
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,894
A GUY LIKE BERNIE WOULD BE IN

1076
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,931

1077
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,431

00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:38,135
HE'S NEVER HAD A DRINK IN HIS

00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:38,702

WASN'T THAT GREAT?

1102
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:27,751
WASN'T THAT GREAT?

1103
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,053

THAT WAS THE WORST BODY LANGUAGE

1123
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,123
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

1124
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,758
OH WHAT A GROUP.

1125
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:11,228
WHAT A GROUP.

1126
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,664
HOLIER THAN THOU, AREN'T THEY?

1127
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,100
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION, RIGHT?

1128
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,566
WHAT A GROUP.

1129
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:20,004
ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION

1130
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:20,304
IS MEDICARE.

1131
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,673
DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO

1132
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,242
RAID MEDICARE TO PAY FOR THEIR

1133
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:25,942
SOCIALIST AGENDA.

1134
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,577
THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY IT.

1135
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:29,480
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

1136
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,914
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS

1137
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:37,054
WHO EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT,

1138
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:37,287
RIGHT?

1139
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:37,487
RIGHT?

1140
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:40,157
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT

1141
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,427
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING

1142
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:43,694
LOCATION.

1143
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:46,230
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.

1144
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,897
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

1145
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,433
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF

1146
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,402
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE

1147
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,070
ITS JUST THE WAY LIFE IS,

1148
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,337
FOLKS.

1149
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:59,309
WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

1150
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,778
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING

1151
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,113
ABOUT IT AND THEY CAN'T DO IT.

1152
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,848
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PLAN.

1153
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,317
SO JUST PUT IT DOWN AND SOME

1154
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,753
REPUBLICANS SAY IS THAT A

1155
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,153
REPUBLICAN THING?

1156
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:12,289
WHETHER IT IS OR NOT, AND TO ME

1157
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:17,160
IT IS, AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.

1158
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,996
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS WILL

1159
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:24,167
ALWAYS BE TAKEN CARE OF BY US.

1160
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,001
HAVE TO DO IT.

1161
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,436
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

1162
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:27,837
WE HAVE TO DO IT.

1163
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,539
AND WE WANT TO DO ET.

1164
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:30,740
I WANT TO -- DO IT.

1165
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,841
I WANT TO DO IT.

1166
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:33,543
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO IT.

1167
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:34,578
WE'RE DOING WELL.

1168
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,313
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM CHINA.

1169
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,781
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THE EUROPEAN

1170
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:40,718
UNION WHO HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF

1171
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,518
US FOR YEARS.

1172
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:46,022
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM JAPAN.

1173
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:49,426
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM OUR NEW

1174
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,162
BEAUTIFUL TRANSACTION WHICH IS A

1175
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:52,562
FAIR TRANSACTION.

1176
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:54,832
AND GOOD FOR THEM TOO, MEXICO,

1177
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:55,065
CANADA.

1178
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,100
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF

1179
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,068
MONEY COMING IN FOLKS WHEN WE

1180
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,670
FIX UP THESE HORRIBLE TRADE

1181
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,870
DEALS.

1182
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,607
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

1183
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,140
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

1184
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,509
PEOPLE THAT HAVE A PROBLEM ARE

1185
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,945
GOING BE HELPED BY THE

1186
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:10,347
REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM THE TIME I

1187
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,448
GOT ELECTED REALLY.

1188
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,484
YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH

1189
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,185
OBAMACARE, IT'S A DISASTER.

1190
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,286
WE HAD IT BEATEN.

1191
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,855
BUT I'LL SAY IT A DIFFERENT WAY

1192
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,622
THAN I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT.

1193
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:21,658
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.

1194
00:44:21,658 --> 00:44:24,427
WE HAD IT REPEALED AND REPLACED.

1195
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:26,563
A LITTLE SHOCKER TOOK PLACE

1196
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,830
EARLY IN THE MORNING.

1197
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,533
BUT THE FACT IS WE DIDN'T GET

1198
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,467
ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.

1199
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,803
WE WOULD HAVE SAVED A TRILLION

1200
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,805
DOLLARS, THINK OF IT.

1201
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,208
OUR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE SAVED $1

1202
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,043
TRILLION HAD WE GOTTEN THAT

1203
00:44:40,043 --> 00:44:40,343
EXTRA VOTE.

1204
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:42,746
WE DIDN'T GET ONE VOTE FROM ONE

1205
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,013
DEMOCRAT.

1206
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,082
BUT WE'VE PRETTY MUCH DISMANTLED

1207
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,017
IT AND HERE'S THE NICE STORY.

1208
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,518
WE'VE MANAGED IT WELL.

1209
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:51,288
AND YOUR PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP

1210
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:55,925
VERY LITTLE BY COMPARE.

1211
00:44:55,925 --> 00:45:01,665
156%, 187%, 116%, NOW WE GET IT

1212
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:01,965
DOWN.

1213
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,335
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT HEALTH

1214
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:05,569
CARE.

1215
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:06,203
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]

1216
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:07,471
>> THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE

1217
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,174
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH

1218
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,910
I.C.E., THE RITA BRAVER PEOPLE

1219
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:13,877
OF I.C.E.

1220
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,645
-- THE BRAVE

1221
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:15,779
BRAVE PEOPLE OF I.C.E.

1222
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,315
IN OTHER WORDS THEY WANT TO

1223
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,284
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

1224
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:20,551
ENTIRELY.

1225
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,052
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

1226
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:26,156
DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT STRONGLY

1227
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,927
SANCTUARY CITIES OF DEATH.

1228
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,661
SANCTUARY SANCTUARY CITIES.

1229
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:35,132
EVERY DAY SANCTUARY CITIES ARE

1230
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,934
UNLEASHING VICIOUS PREDATORS AND

1231
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,069
BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS LIKE MS-13

1232
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,136
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

1233
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:42,573
THEY GO OUT AND THEY HIDE OUT IN

1234
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,139
SANCTUARY CITIES.

1235
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,075
THEN THEY COME INTO OUR CITIES

1236
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,409
AND OUR TOWNS.

1237
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,477
AND THEN WE SEND I.C.E.

1238
00:45:47,477 --> 00:45:49,746
IN AND

1239
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,314
I.C.E.

1240
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,215
HAS NO PROBLEM.

1241
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,015
YOU KNOW WHY?

1242
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:52,583
BECAUSE I.C.E.

1243
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,283
IS MUCH TOUGHER

1244
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,220
AND MUCH SMAFRTER THAN THEM --

1245
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,321
SMARTER THAN THEM.

1246
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:57,688
AND I.C.E.

1247
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,756
HAS DONE AN

1248
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:00,223
INCREDIBLE JOB.

1249
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:01,725
AND THEY GRAB THEM BY THE NECK

1250
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,227
AND THEY THROW THEM THE HECK OUT

1251
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:10,701
OF OUR COUNTRY OR THEY THROW

1252
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:29,386
THEM

1253
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:30,887
>> THAT GOES FOR I.C.E.

1254
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:32,089
WE'RE SETTING RECORDS ON THE

1255
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,056
BORDER ON ARRESTS.

1256
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,392
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

1257
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,729
WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL.

1258
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,730
IT'S GOING UP.

1259
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:46,803
BUT GETTING MONEY IS BRUTAL.

1260
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:58,081
BRUTAL SO WE'VE STARTED THE WALL

1261
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,650
AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN

1262
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,886
CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE.

1263
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,186
SAN DIEGO.

1264
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,521
WE'RE MOVING EASTWARD AND WE'RE

1265
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:08,725
COVERING A LOT OF TERRITORY.

1266
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:12,596
THEY GAVE US $1.6 BILLION, $1.6

1267
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:12,863
BILLION.

1268
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,766
I WANT THE WHOLE THING SO WE CAN

1269
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,566
BUILD THE WALL.

1270
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:19,970
AND WE CAN DO A GREAT ONE IN ONE

1271
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,170
YEAR.

1272
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,106
BUT GETTING MONEY FROM THE

1273
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,207
DEMOCRATS IS TOUGH BECAUSE THEY

1274
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,908
KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR US.

1275
00:47:25,908 --> 00:47:27,577
AND THEY KNOW WE NEED IT.

1276
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:30,414
MOST OF THEM VOTED FOR IT

1277
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:30,647
IN 2006.

1278
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,349
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT.

1279
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,451
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

1280
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,552
WALL.

1281
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,319
YOU HAVE PEOPLE POURING ACROSS.

1282
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,187
THEY'RE TACKLING PEOPLE.

1283
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,690
THEN OF COURSE THEY HAVE CATCH

1284
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:39,990
AND RELEASE.

1285
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,326
YOU CATCH SOMEBODY, WHO IS THIS

1286
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:42,559
PERSON?

1287
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,893
IT'S A CRIMINAL.

1288
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,695
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

1289
00:47:45,695 --> 00:47:46,930
CATCH, TAKE HIS NAME, AND

1290
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:47,397
RELEASE THE PERSON.

1291
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,999
AND THE PERSON THEY THINK WILL

1292
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,300
COME BACK TO COURT.

1293
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,802
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION

1294
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,637
LAWS MANY THE WHOLE WORLD.

1295
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,005
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT

1296
00:47:55,005 --> 00:48:02,378
COUPLE OF WEEKS FOLKS, WATCH.

1297
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:02,846
WATCH.

1298
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,615
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE

1299
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:06,182
DEMOCRATS, EVERY REPUBLICAN

1300
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:07,084
WANTS SOME CHANGE.

1301
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:08,585
BUT THEY STOP YOU.

1302
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,788
THE ONLY THING THEY'RE GOOD AT

1303
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,157
-- THEY'RE LOUSY POLITICIANS,

1304
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:14,891
HORRIBLE IN POLICY.

1305
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,994
THEY'RE ONLY GOOD AT ONE THING,

1306
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:17,260
RESISTING.

1307
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,729
THEY'RE GOOD AT STICKING

1308
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:18,996
TOGETHER.

1309
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,198
YOU RARELY SEE THEM BREAK UP.

1310
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,967
THEY STICK LIKE GLUE THEY STICK.

1311
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,836
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY'RE

1312
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:26,069
GOOD AT.

1313
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,271
DELAY AND RESIST, REPUBLICANS

1314
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:31,875
BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD BE A

1315
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:33,777
SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING

1316
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,213
AMERICANS NOT FOR CRIMINAL

1317
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:36,446
ALIENS.

1318
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,783
IF YOU WANT SECURITY, IF YOU

1319
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,452
WANT A STRONG BORDER, IF YOU

1320
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:46,356
WANT TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS A

1321
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,324
GREAT GREAT SAFE COUNTRY THEN

1322
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:51,795
YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND YOU NEED

1323
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:52,729
TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.

1324
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:59,903
HAVE TO DO IT.

1325
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,638
AND EVERYBODY THIS ELECTION IN

1326
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,807
NOVEMBER IS ABOUT SAFETY AND

1327
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,242
IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY.

1328
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,276
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR

1329
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,477
WEALTH AWAY FROM YOU.

1330
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,179
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR

1331
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:09,713
WEALTH AWAY.

1332
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:10,547
ALL OF THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE

1333
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,349
JOBS AND THE SALARIES AND THE

1334
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,850
WAGES THAT ARE RISING FOR THE

1335
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:15,785
FIRST TIME IN 21 YEARS, THEY'RE

1336
00:49:15,785 --> 00:49:19,022
DOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU

1337
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,156
SO FAST.

1338
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:22,793
SINCE THE ELECTION WE HAVE

1339
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:27,898
CREATED OVER 4 MILLION NEW JOBS.

1340
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,932
UNHEARD OF.

1341
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:31,301
UNHEARD OF.

1342
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,335
UNHEARD OF.

1343
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:33,804
AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 MILLION

1344
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,872
AMERICAS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.

1345
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:39,776
THAT'S A BIG THING.

1346
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,379
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000 NEW

1347
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,013
MANUFACTURING JOBS.

1348
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,082
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE PREVIOUS

1349
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,784
ADMINISTRATION SAID, OH, YOU

1350
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,419
CAN'T DO MANUFACTURING.

1351
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,353
I SAID, REALLY?

1352
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:51,988
WHO'S GOING TO BUILD THINGS?

1353
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,557
THEY SAID YOU WON'T ADD ANY.

1354
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,492
THEY SAID YOU NEEDED 5 MAGIC

1355
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,894
WAND, REMEMBER -- A MAGIC WAND,

1356
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,595
REMEMBER?

1357
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,564
WE DON'T HAVE A MAGIC WAND.

1358
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,432
WE HAVE GOOD POLICY.

1359
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,200
WE HAVE GOOD LEADERSHIP.

1360
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,103
AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES

1361
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:10,607
OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

1362
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:11,608
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT

1363
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:15,812
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER

1364
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:16,079
RECORDED.

1365
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,047
EVER RECORDED.

1366
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:18,248
EVER.

1367
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:18,448
EVER.

1368
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,783
REMEMBER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO

1369
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:19,983
LOSE?

1370
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,119
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE, I

1371
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:22,352
SAID.

1372
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,221
AND PEOPLE SAID, OH, THAT'S NOT

1373
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:24,421
NICE.

1374
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,356
BUT I SAID, WAIT, THEY HAVE THE

1375
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,258
WORST CRIME RATE.

1376
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,825
THEY HAVE THE WORST SCHOOLS.

1377
00:50:29,825 --> 00:50:32,996
THEY HAVE THE WORST

1378
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:33,529
HOMEOWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES.

1379
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:34,865
THEY HAVE THE WORST -- I WENT

1380
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,967
THROUGH A LIST OF TEN DIFFERENT

1381
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,234
THINGS.

1382
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,969
AND I LOOKED UP.

1383
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,172
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS VOTED FOR

1384
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,375
DEMOCRATS, THE

1385
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,775
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

1386
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:46,209
95 MORE PERCENT.

1387
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,844
I LOOKED UP AND SAID WHAT THE

1388
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:51,881
DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

1389
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:52,148
REMEMBER?

1390
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:55,552
AND NOW NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE

1391
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,388
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN

1392
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,656
HISTORY BUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN

1393
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,392
POVERTY HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST

1394
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,727
RATE ALSO EVER RECORDED.

1395
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:08,131
IT'S A GREAT THING, RIGHT?

1396
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:11,902
SO -- AND WE'VE JUST STARTED.

1397
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,771
WE'VE JUST STARTED.

1398
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,841
REMEMBER, SAME TRUE FOR HISPANIC

1399
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,208
AMERICANS.

1400
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,944
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

1401
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:21,945
EVER RECORDED.

1402
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,981
SAME FOR ASIAN AMERICANS.

1403
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:27,551
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EVER

1404
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:27,818
RECORDED.

1405
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,854
WOMEN LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

1406
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:37,894
IN 65 YEARS.

1407
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:42,132
AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF WORKING

1408
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:46,403
SO HARD WE FINALLY PUT OURSELVES

1409
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,438
IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN DO

1410
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,307
THINGS AND WE CAN REALLY DO

1411
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:50,574
THEM.

1412
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,909
BUT WE CAN DO THEM AN AWFULLY

1413
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,579
LOT BETTER IF WE HAD MORE -- A

1414
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,078
REAL MAJORITY.

1415
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,881
NOT A MAJORITY OF ONE.

1416
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:06,022
NOT A MAJORITY OF LITERALLY LY

1417
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:06,289
--

1418
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,824
LITERALLY IF SOMEBODY IS SICK WE

1419
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:12,562
HAVE TO POSTPONE VOTES.

1420
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,697
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'VE DONE

1421
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:14,230
SO MUCH.

1422
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:17,334
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH.

1423
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,536
WE'VE JUST FINALIZED THE

1424
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,336
TREMENDOUS NEW TRADE AGREEMENT

1425
00:52:20,336 --> 00:52:22,772
WITH SOUTH KOREA WHERE IT WAS A

1426
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,039
DISASTER.

1427
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,841
THAT WAS A HILLARY CLINTON

1428
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,141
CATASTROPHE.

1429
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:28,178
REMEMBER SHE SAID WE ARE GOING

1430
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:31,114
TO CREATE 250,000 NEW JOBS.

1431
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,950
AND SHE WAS RIGHT FOR SOUTH

1432
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,284
KOREA.

1433
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,218
IT WAS GOOD.

1434
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,420
AND WE'VE JUST TOTALLY

1435
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,787
RENEGOTIATED IT.

1436
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,989
WE'VE MADE IT GOOD.

1437
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,925
AND WE'VE OPENED UP NEW

1438
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,059
NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN WHO

1439
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,529
WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE

1440
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:46,029
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.

1441
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,897
YOU KNOW WHY?

1442
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:51,635
BECAUSE THEY SAID WE'RE HAPPY,

1443
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,536
WHY SHOULD WE NEGOTIATE?

1444
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,305
WELL, WE SAID WE WANT TO

1445
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,207
NEGOTIATE, AND WITH THE EUROPEAN

1446
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,842
UNION WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE.

1447
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,178
AND THEY SAID -- I LOVE YOU TOO,

1448
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:08,918
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE BUT I LOVE

1449
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:10,520
YOU.

1450
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,224
THAT WAS A STRONG GUY, BY THE

1451
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:14,390
WAY.

1452
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,624
IN CASE.

1453
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:16,326
BECAUSE IF THAT WAS A WOMAN I'M

1454
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:17,159
IN BIG TROUBLE.

1455
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:18,495
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

1456
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:25,001
I HOPE YOU'RE A GUY, ARE YOU?

1457
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,138
SO, SO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND

1458
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:33,076
JAPAN I SAID, LISTEN, WE LOST

1459
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,211
$151 BILLION, WITH A B, WITH

1460
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:35,879
YOU.

1461
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,750
WE LOST $151 BILLION.

1462
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,218
JEAN CLAUDE, HE'S THE HEAD OF

1463
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,486
THE EUROPEAN UNION.

1464
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:48,992
I SAID JEAN CLAUDE, HE'S TOUGH

1465
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:49,259
AND SMART.

1466
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,394
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES OUR

1467
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,362
COUNTRY MUCH, BUT I'VE TOLD HIM

1468
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,630
THAT MANY TIMES.

1469
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,564
WELL, THEY WERE FORMED IN ORDER

1470
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,433
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.

1471
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,636
SO JEAN CLAUDE FOR YEARS THE

1472
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,603
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO

1473
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,706
NEGOTIATE AND YOU SAID NO, WE'RE

1474
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,773
NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE.

1475
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,443
I'M TELLING YOU I WANT TO

1476
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:06,876
NEGOTIATE.

1477
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:09,012
WE LOST $151 BILLION WITH THE

1478
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:09,379
EUROPEAN UNION.

1479
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:11,581
MANY OF US COME FROM THE

1480
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:11,948
EUROPEAN UNION.

1481
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:12,148
I DO.

1482
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,619
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

1483
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,653
SOUND SO NICE EUROPEAN UNION.

1484
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:19,021
AND THEY'RE JUST KILLING US.

1485
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,190
SO I SAID WE HAD TO NEGOTIATE.

1486
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,225
OH, YES YES.

1487
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,427
TWO WEEKS GO BY, WE DON'T GET A

1488
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:24,627
CALL.

1489

THEY'RE REBUILDING THEMSELVES.

00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:18,241
THEY'RE BUILDING A JET A DAY.

SO, THEY SAID NO. 

1574
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:15,999

TWO HANG ON TO HIS EVERY WORD, 

2159
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,800

2160

THOUGHT THAT ENERGY, HE WENT 

2161
01:17:52,634 --> 01:17:53,135

2163

AND YOU COULD TELL AND THE WITH 

2164
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,873
HE WAS SPEAKING, AND THE WAY 

2165
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,374
THAT HE WAS ENERGIZING THE 

2166
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:00,542

2167
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,177

MENTIONED BRETT KAVANAUGH,  

2172
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,620
TONIGHT FELT DIFFERENT, BECAUSE 

2173
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,955

2174
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:14,555
WAS ATTACKING DR. CHRISTINE 

2175

2176
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:20,762

2177
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:21,863

MORE THE -- MORE TIME PASSES, 

2180
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,737
IT BEGINS TO QUESTION HER MORE 

2181
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:29,738
AND MORE, BECAUSE INITIALLY, 

2182
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:30,572
WHEN HE FIRST MADE PUBLIC 

2183
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:31,773
REMARKS ABOUT IT, HE TALKED 

2184
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:33,441
ABOUT HOW CREDIBLE AND MOVING 

2185
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:38,713
HER STORY WAS, AND THEN HE 

2186
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:39,548
CALLED FOR THE INVESTIGATION 

2187
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,449
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE 

2188
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:41,349
IMPORTANCE OF GETTING ANSWERS. 

2189
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:43,018

2190
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:43,885

2192
01:18:45,453 --> 01:18:50,058
MOCKED HER. EVEN AS HIS FBI 

2193
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:55,263
CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE. 

2194
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:55,797
>> THAT IS RIGHT. 

2195
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,599

2197
01:18:58,633 --> 01:18:59,334

2198
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,270

2202
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:08,743

2203

POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS OR 

2204
01:19:10,811 --> 01:19:12,681
CALCULATIONS THAT THE WHITE 

2205
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:15,684
HOUSE AND HIS AIDES ARE MAKING 

2206
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:16,584
REGARDING THIS ISSUE? 

2207
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:18,687
BECAUSE, AS WE SAW THERE, 

2208
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,990
PRESIDENT TRUMP  CLEARLY ENJOYS 

2209
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,826
THE SUPPORT FROM HIS DAYS. 

2210
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,060
IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF 

2211
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,332
DIMINISHING. 

2212
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:31,533
>> THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT 

2213
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:33,368
PART, BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT 

2214
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,136
HIS AIDES, AND THOSE VERY CLOSE 

2215
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:37,772
TO HIM PERHAPS WARNED HIM TO BE 

2216
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:40,475
VERY CAUTIOUS OF TREADING INTO 

2217
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:41,676
THIS TERRITORY WHEN HE IS 

2218
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:42,711
TALKING ABOUT THE BRETT 

2219
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:46,248
KAVANAUGH  NOMINATION AND IN 

2220
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,817
FACT, I HAVE TALKED TO SOURCES 

2221
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,952
THAT SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS 

2222
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:53,488
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRUMP  AND 

2223
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,657
HE IS GOING TO BE HIMSELF 

2224
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:57,158
REGARDLESS OF WHAT ADVICE HE 

2225
01:19:57,158 --> 01:20:01,796
GETS, THE TONE HE TAKES THEM IN 

2226
01:20:01,796 --> 01:20:02,931
TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE HE USES, 

2227
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,299
IS GOING TO SAY WHAT HE WANTS 

2228
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:08,670
TO, AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE 

2229
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:09,671
THIRD TIME OR PERHAPS THE 

2230
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:10,705
FOURTH TIME I HAVE HEARD IN 

2231
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,774
PUBLIC THAT HE IS VERY STRONG 

2232
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:16,211
ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID, THAT 

2233
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,546
HE HAS A WARNING FOR YOUNG MEN 

2234
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:18,613
IN THIS COUNTRY. 

2235
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:21,783
YOU KNOW, THAT THE COUNTRY IS 

2236
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,752
SOMEHOW OUT TO GET THEM, WARNING

2237
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:25,153
THAT THEIR JOBS COULD BE AT 

2238
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:25,386
STAKE. 

2239
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:27,789
WARNING MOTHERS AND WIVES AND 

2240
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:29,624
SISTERS THAT THEIR LOVED ONES 

2241
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:30,659
COULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A 

2242
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,094
PLACE, AND BE FALSELY ACCUSED. 

2243
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:35,964
WHAT HE DOES NOT ADDRESS IS 

2244
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:36,531
VALID ALLEGATIONS. 

2245
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:40,301
HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW,

2246
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,403
ALL THOSE CREDIBLE ACCUSATIONS 

2247
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,504
THAT LEAD TO CRIMINAL CHARGES. 

2248
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,905
AND HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE 

2249
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,108
WOMAN WHO COME FORWARD, WHO 

2250
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:51,179
MAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS, AND 

2251
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,180
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING 

2252
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:52,447
THROUGH. 

2253
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:53,815
INSTEAD, HE FOCUSES, AS HE DID 

2254
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,649
TODAY, HEADING DOWN HERE TO 

2255
01:20:55,649 --> 01:20:59,287
MISSISSIPPI, I'M SORRY -- I 

2256
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:02,123
THINK IT WAS IN PHILADELPHIA, 

2257
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,426
BUT THE POINT IS HE DOUBLES 

2258
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:09,030
DOWN ON HIS WARNING TO MEN THAT 

2259
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,332
IT IS REALLY THEIR BURDEN TO 

2260
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,266
CARRY, BECAUSE THEY COULD 

2261
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,500
FACE'S FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND IT 

2262
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,705
COULD PUT THE MONEY TO AFFECT 

2263
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,239
USE -- SITUATION. 

2264
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,274
THAT IS WHAT WE HEARD AGAIN. 

2265
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:20,408
AS YOU POINTED OUT HERE, HE HAS 

2266
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,343
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THAT 

2267
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:23,078
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE 

2268
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:24,245
VICTIMS HERE. 

2269
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:26,047
>> IT HAS BEEN A BUSY NEWSDAY 

2270
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:29,150
AND HAS -- CONTINUES TO BE. 

2271
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:31,486
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE 

2272
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:32,087
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT WAS 

2273
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:32,821
RELEASED TUESDAY THAT ALLEGES 

2274
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,923
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED  IN TAX 

2275
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,892
FRAUD, CAN YOU REMIND US ABOUT 

2276
01:21:37,892 --> 01:21:39,661
THE BASIC OUTLINES OF WHAT WAS 

2277
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,129
IN THAT REPORT, AND HOW IS IT 

2278
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,597
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 

2279
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,566
RESPONDED? 

2280
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,034
>> JUST MINUTES BEFORE THIS 

2281
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,369
RALLY STARTED, WHITE HOUSE 

2282
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,437
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS 

2283
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:53,508
SENT A VERY DEFIANT STATEMENT 

2284
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:54,943
SAYING THAT THE STORY WAS 

2285
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:55,910
COMPLETELY FALSE, AND THAT 

2286
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:58,613
THESE WERE NOT NEW PIECES OF 

2287
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,015
INFORMATION THAT IN FACT, THE 

2288
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,149
IRIS HAD THIS INFORMATION IN 

2289
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:06,121
THE PAST, AND THEY SIGNED OFF 

2290
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,889
ON IT, AND THERE WAS NO 

2291
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,357
CRIMINAL FINDING HERE. 

2292
01:22:09,357 --> 01:22:10,925
SO, BASICALLY HERE IS WHAT WE 

2293
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,828
HAVE -- A PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT 

2294
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,331
EVEN BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE,  HE 

2295
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:17,365
REALLY SOLD HIMSELF AND 

2296
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,734
CONTINUES TO SELL HIMSELF AS A 

2297
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,002
SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE, SOMEONE 

2298
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:24,372
WHO ONLY TO $1 MILLION FROM HIS 

2299
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,573
FATHER, AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO 

2300
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:27,375
GROW THAT BY SO MUCH. 

2301
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:31,546
SO, THE ARTICLE -- AND, THIS IS 

2302
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:32,514
BASED ON -- ACCORDING TO THE 

2303
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,849
NEW YORK TIMES, EXTENSIVE 

2304
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:35,583
INTERVIEWS AND OVER 100,000 

2305
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,917
PAGES OF OTHER FINANCIAL 

2306
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:39,120
DOCUMENTS, THE ARTICLE CLAIMS 

2307
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,655
THAT IN FACT IT WAS A LOAN OF 

2308
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,290
ABOUT $61 MILLION THAT HE HAS 

2309
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:45,093
YET TO PAY BACK IN FULL, AND 

2310
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,827
THAT OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL 

2311
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,597
YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 

2312
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:50,799
SIBLINGS WORKED OUT SEVERAL 

2313
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,667
SCHEMES  TO RAKE IN MONEY FROM 

2314
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:56,037
THEIR PARENTS.  

2315
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,839
TO HIDE DIFFERENT POCKETS OF 

2316
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:01,309
MONEY AS GIFTS, AND TO WORK OUT 

2317
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:07,048
A STRATEGY TO UNDERVALUE THEIR 

2318
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:07,949
REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS ON TAX 

2319
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,284
RETURNS, SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO 

2320
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:10,718
PAY LESS IN TAXES. 

2321
01:23:10,718 --> 01:23:11,519
AND, SPINNER TIMES REALLY 

2322
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,753
SPELLS OUT HOW THIS:FOR THE 

2323
01:23:12,753 --> 01:23:17,225
KNOW, I SHOULD SAY THAT AN 

2324
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,026
ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2325
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:18,927
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING 

2326
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,429
THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE 100%  ALSO

2327
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,497
THE INTERESTING PART OF THAT 

2328
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,332
STATEMENT WAS THAT HE ACTUALLY 

2329
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,667
CALLED OUT THE PRESIDENTS OTHER 

2330
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,769
FAMILY MEMBERS AND SAID THEY 

2331
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:28,937
MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, BUT THE 

2332
01:23:28,937 --> 01:23:30,772
PRESIDENT HIMSELF WAS NOT. 

2333
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,075
BUT, WE SHOULD ALSO MENTION 

2334
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,076
THAT THE NEW YORK STATE 

2335
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:38,013
DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION 

2336
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:38,947
RESPONDED TODAY SAYING THAT 

2337
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:41,583
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THESE NEW

2338
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,151
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE JUST COME 

2339
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,053
TO LIGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS 

2340
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,287
INVESTIGATION BY THE NEW YORK 

2341
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:50,325
TIMES SO THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 

2342
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:51,526
DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS, BUT HE 

2343
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:56,831
CONTINUED TO SLAM THE MEDIAS 

2344
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:57,632
FAKE NEWS PUTTING OUT FAKE 

2345
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:58,233
INFORMATION ABOUT HIM. 

2346
01:23:58,233 --> 01:23:59,868
BY THE WAY, IT CALLS INTO 

2347
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,468
QUESTION THIS ONGOING REFUSAL 

2348
01:24:00,468 --> 01:24:05,874
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO RELEASE 

2349
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:06,307
HIS TAX RETURNS. 

2350
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:08,810
HE COULD PUT ALL THIS TO BED 

2351
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,011
EARLY SEEN HIS TAX RETURNS BUT 

2352
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,045
HE CITES AN ONGOING AUDIT IS 

2353
01:24:11,045 --> 01:24:12,647
THE REASON WHY HE REFUSES TO DO 

2354
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:17,352
THAT, WHICH BREAKS FROM DECADES 

2355
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:18,552
OF PRECEDENT SET BY HIS 

2356
01:24:18,552 --> 01:24:19,888
PREDECESSORS AS WE HAVE SEEN 

2357
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:22,223
FORMER PRESIDENTS PUT IT OUT 

2358
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,392
THERE SO IT IS NOT A BIG 

2359
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:28,263
QUESTION LOOMING. 

2360
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:29,330
WHICH IT CONTINUES TO BE OVER 

2361
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:33,601
PRESIDENT TRUMP.  

2362
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,070
>> WE WILL SEE IF HE RESPONDS 

2363
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,271
FURTHER IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE 

2364
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:37,105
SAW FROM SARAH SANDERS. 

2365
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:43,278
ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH. 

2366
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,780
>>> COMING UP, DEMOCRATS SEE 

2367
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,348
THE DELAY IN THE BRETT 

2368
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:47,948
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION AS A 

2369
01:24:47,948 --> 01:24:49,217
WINNING ISSUE IN NOVEMBER.  

2370
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:50,385
SO TO REPUBLICANS. 

2371
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,220
YOU ARE STREAMING RED AND BLUE 

2372
01:24:52,220 --> 00:00:00,000
ON CBSN.
