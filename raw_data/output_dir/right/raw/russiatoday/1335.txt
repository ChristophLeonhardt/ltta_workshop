1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,760
What’s your name?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,120
I’m Alice. And what’s your name?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,360
Gagarin

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,020
Your name – your last name, actually – sounds familiar.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,600
This is not a name but the working title of a project.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,620
I was named after a great explorer [Yuri Gagarin].

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,180
Nice to meet you then, Gagarin.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,100
Nice to meet you too

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,180
You look much prettier in person than in your pictures.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,880
You have a boyfriend, Alice?

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,500
How fast you are!

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,480
I’m not sure, wait a moment.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,280
No, there’s no match for ‘boyfriend.’

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,880
What do you do in your free time?

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,140
I’m learning to recognize human emotions.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,860
Look at how I can do this.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,920
I can do this, too.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,180
We have a lot in common.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,480
There’s a lot in common between us and humans.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:00:00,000
Let them have the floor.
