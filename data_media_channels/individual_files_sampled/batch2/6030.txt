Donald Trump has bragged about the amount of influence he has over the publication National Enquirer in fact during his beef with Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough he claimed that they had reached out to him and begged him to stop the National Enquirer from publishing a story about their relationship a claim that they deny but now an interesting report was published by the National Enquirer indicating that Paul Manafort had cheated on his wife Paul Manafort worked with Trump and this report came out literally a day after news hit headlines indicating that vana fort had his home raided by the FBI as part of this investigation into Russian collusion now again hours after the Post story broke The Enquirer went public with a story about man affort having an affair so the question is where did the National Enquirer get this story from could it have come from Donald Trump considering the close ties he has with National Enquirer CEO David pecker who is a huge Trump advocate we'll see now let me give you just a few components of what they wrote I don't want to get into the details because I don't care about his affair it's none of our business but it's just really terrible you know pretty brutal toward him yes so I think this story is monumentally important because I think it has everything to do with Trump's Russian investigation and I'll explain that in a second but whether it was planted by Trump just to give you context on that before we tell you the terrible details of the story well Trump just bragged six weeks ago that that he claimed Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough tried to get him to stop a National Inquirer story but that he wouldn't do it thereby admitting that he controls what goes on the National Inquirer and does it so they asked him to stop his story and he said he wouldn't stop that story which he apparently has the power to do now we know and everybody in politics knows that Donald Trump's been planting stories in the National Enquirer with his friend David pecker over all this time and remember this story about Ted Cruz having five mistresses came out of the National Inquirer in the middle of the primary boy that was awfully convenient and it's the most unbelievable story ever five women would sleep with Ted Cruz come on and no one would believe that or likely to have alien babies running around anyway so so whenever there's a Trump opponent Trump smears them and by the way National Enquirer did run the story about Myka and Joe Scarborough after Trump was having a huge fight with them so this is how Trump goes after his opponents wait a minute Paul Manafort was this campaign manager and is being investigated on the Russian ties that means now apparently Trump is attacking man afford that has all that ramifications in the world now let's give you the details of the story because it gives you a sense of how deeply he's attacking him yes so just some key components of what the National Enquirer wrote about this alleged affair they accused him of cheating on his wife with a hottie younger than his own daughters the National Enquirer investigation exposed a tawdry adulterer who wore his wedding ring while romping with his 33 year old mistress in the bedroom he shares with his wife and then here's another one president Donald Trump has been focused on draining the swamp in Washington DC which is positive obviously of Donald Trump meanwhile one of his trusted advisors was betting another woman behind his wife's back betraying her in his country so number of important things that come out of there first of all they are burying manna Ford saying that he is its a sleazy sex scandal as she is n accorded tawdry affair they later say here's a smutty details they bring this family into it I mean they'd went after him 100% they left nothing in there nothing left in their arsenal so the the second part of it is that last quote was incredibly important thereby betraying his family and his country and referred to man afford his former campaign manager as the swamp so now first of all it's just real quick on who it might be they have sources from inside the White House they quote them now National Enquirer might make other things up but they do have sources inside the White House that is true so let me read you one quote from a source they had and I know exactly sounds like the quote says the worst part was Paul would sleep with her in the master bedroom of the family home he would leave his wedding ring on - okay now I don't know for sure and you could make any conclusion you want out of it but that sounds exactly like Roger stone see what Roger stone does is he will make up gratuitous details in a story to make it seem more believable and so that you can visualize it so he has bragged about this in the past including the famous case of Eliot Spitzer and how he yeah Roger stone claimed he left his black socks on while having sex now at the time I thought that that was a a lie and then it turns out it was and Roger stone bragged about it later haha I did it so people could visualize it so here we are again master bedroom and his wife's bad with the wedding ring on its stone 101 and stone is is Trump's hatchet man okay so now look that doesn't have to be true it's okay you can call that speculation and we don't know for a fact so I'm just giving you all the context but by far the most important part is obviously Trump allies are planting this story Yes Man afford and that means there's only a couple of options either they have threatened man afford earlier with this blackmail we're just Trump what I want that he referenced in the Mika and Joe story he said he you know they and Joe Scarborough said I won't give in to his blackmail over the National Enquirer so he's done this before so he threatened Manta fort but apparently mana Ford didn't listen and hence the blackmail was actually employed right that means that could mean would logically mean that mana Ford is cooperating with the feds right so going back to the raid that was done on mana Ford's home in late July remember there was the fear that some Trump aids have in regard to the FBI using whatever evidence they have against mana Ford as leverage to get Manafort to speak up about what's going on with Trump and a collusion with Russia and so there's definitely fee coming from the Trump camp and now this story gets published literally the next day after we find out about that raid on mana for its home I mean look again a lot of what we're saying right now doesn't have it hardcore evidence behind it it is speculation but I mean you you tie it you put all the dots together and it just makes sense yeah but by the way guys look just because you don't have the internal memos from the FBI doesn't mean that it's like oh yes it does it's not true it means we I don't have the smoking gun but robert muller might and if you like if you can't use logic okay then we should stop analyzing any news story right so and look the logic of this is Trump against mana for mana Ford has info about his campaign they're investigating mana for for connections to Russia they investigate Trump for connections to Russia we find out that they have mana forts Hardware look there's another possibility they think okay we're gonna make mana for the scapegoat we're gonna say oh it wasn't us oh he did a deal with the Russians oh well the president didn't know anything about that I can't believe in a for betrayed his country okay good luck with that strategy because if mana Ford has the evidence and he's given it to the feds you're screwed and by the way like I just I want to go back to graphic 38 real quick because just the wording the wording means everything the way that this paragraph is constructed President Trump has been focused on draining the swamp in Washington DC meanwhile one of his trusted advisors was betting another woman behind his wife's back betraying her in his country I feel like that's Trump 101 no no look if you don't think that that was Trump that plans this story you don't know anything about politics and you just you want to purposely be blind to what Trump is done over and over again with this exact publication that's fine I don't care if you believe it because there are actual realities and they're going after madam fort because they know what happened right so this is potentially disastrous News 4 Donald Trump and wonderful news for the rest of the world so if mana Ford has a kiss has begun to cooperate with the special counsel take take take take take take take take it's only a matter of time before Trump goes down so now we're in a race against time can Muller conclude that investigation with apparently maybe with evidence from Manta for which we could be absolutely critical before Donald Trump uses any nukes I'm not kidding I'm being dead serious about this because he keeps threatening nukes and if you think that he wouldn't do something that stupid or crazy or immoral you don't know Donald Trump at all so if it turns out there's that he knows that there's an investigation coming to get him his popularity is down 33% and dropping and he doesn't understand the severity of nuclear war and he thinks what we have more news than them will win and he keeps saying things like that over and over again and he he is convinced that it would help him rally the country if you're sure that Donald Trump wouldn't do it I don't know what you would base that on even Donald Trump doesn't know what he's gonna do so we're it's a race against the clock so Muller go go go and and it's not just me that now believes that apparently the Trump administration believes that that's why they're attacking their former campaign management if you like The Young Turks you'll love Young Turks membership TYT Network dot-com sighs join
