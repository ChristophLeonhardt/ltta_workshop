5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,740
positive and healthy ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with</font>

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,300
these feelings and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,059
proceed to probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not take my own</font>

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,770
advice so no matter what your brain is

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,210
doing you've gotta remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

10
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,600
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human body it needs sleep it also</font>

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,970
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fed preferably healthy</font>

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,699
things because as much as eating cheese

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,050
and crackers for four days straight

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,869
feels good for your soul probably not so

15
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,759
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your body also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably little</font>

16
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,890
exercise might help you out because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,890
you don't take care of your body

18
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,660
everything's gonna get worse second

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,899
thing panic nope please don't panic I

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,160
mean you're probably going to panic a

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,870
little right because your heart starts

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670
racing and your brain feels a little

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,500
heavy and that's just the natural

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,260
response but try to remind yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,960
that feeling is helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,140
from bears not so much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your</font>

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,940
work done<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you feel overwhelmed</font>

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,770

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,979
from in that case freak the frak out but

30
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,150
yeah whatever you're stressed about is

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,740
only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become more difficult if</font>

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,990
you're panicking so take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down a</font>

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,930
little and proceed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to step three make a</font>

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,860
list step 4 cross out most of your list

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,409
like find out which three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of it is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen</font>

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,240
forgive yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry on step 5 do the</font>

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on the list I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually try to</font>

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,890
make that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> tidying up whatever area</font>

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,530
I'm in because I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> stressed cleaner and</font>

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,960
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> me feel more sane but you do</font>

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,090
you step 6 take a

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,789
you're a human you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> brains but try</font>

45
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,890
to keep it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes or so</font>

46
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">because otherwise you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never end up</font>

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,159
working again step 7 do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work step 8</font>

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,710
and this is the bonus<font color="#E5E5E5"> round complete the</font>

49
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,719
third thing on your list even when I try

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,310
to narrow my list down to three things

51
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,140
sometimes I still don't get those three

52
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,209
things done and that's okay there's

53
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">always going to be more work for you to</font>

54
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,079
do every day for the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your life</font>

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
