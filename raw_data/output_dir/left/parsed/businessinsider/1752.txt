so what's important in mouthwash it's
really important that it's alcohol free
when there's alcohol and mouthwash it
dries out the mouth lowers that pH in
the mouth which is the acid-base balance
and creates an environment for the bad
bacteria because it's all about this
good bacteria versus bad bacteria
balance for this bad bacteria that
causes bad breath to thrive
now the manufacturers of mouthwash are
taking the alcohol out it's alcohol free
it has active ingredients that have
fluoride that is anti cavity keeps the
plaque off the teeth and mouthwash is a
great adjunctive therapy - brushing and
flossing to remove the debris between
the teeth
