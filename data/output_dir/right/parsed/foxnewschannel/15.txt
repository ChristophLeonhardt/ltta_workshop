>> Sandra: BACK NOW TO THE
BREAKING NEWS ON THOSE MAIL
BOMBS CAUSING A SCARE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
LET'S WELCOME AND JOHN KENNEDY
HERE AT OUR NEW YORK STUDIOS.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU RIGHT IN FRONT
OF US, SENATOR.
WHAT A COUPLE OF DAYS THIS HAS
BEEN.
I CAN'T EVEN SAY A COUPLE OF
DAYS.
24 HOURS AGO THIS ALL BEGAN.
WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR THOUGHTS AS
WE NOW LEARN ACCORDING TO THE
AP, THAT THEY ARE CONFIRMING
THAT THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF
THESE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES, IT
WAS MAILED TO JOE BIDEN.
DISCOVERED AT THE DELAWARE
POSTAL FACILITY.
ANOTHER ONE, SENATOR.
>> I THINK IT IS THE RESPONSIBLE
THING TO SAY FOR LEADERSHIP.
IT IS HOW I FEEL.
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE CLINTONS AND THE OBAMA'S,
AND MR. GEORGE SOROS, AND NOW
APPARENTLY VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.
I AM SORRY FOR AMERICA.
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THIS.
THE FBI IS THE PREMIER
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.
THEY WILL CATCH THIS PERSON.
MAYBE SOMEONE WHO IS MENTALLY
ILL.
MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT
MENTALLY ILL BUT IS JUST A WHACK
JOB.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT IS TOO EARLY TO ASSESS.
I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
POLITICAL RHETORIC IN THIS
COUNTRY, IT HAS BEEN HOT ON BOTH
SIDES.
ON BOTH SIDES.
AS I CONTRIBUTE TO IT?
I DON'T THINK IT HAS HELPED.
PROBABLY WE ALL OUGHT TO DIAL IT
DOWN A NOTCH.
WHEN YOU ARE CIVIL, IT DOESN'T
MEAN YOU AGREE WITH YOUR
COLLEAGUES.
IT MEANS YOU RESPECT THEM.
AND I'M JUST SORRY THIS
HAPPENED.
THERE'S NOT MUCH ELSE YOU CAN
SAY, BUT I DO THINK WE WILL
CATCH THIS PERSON.
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF JOHN BRENNAN FOR EXAMPLE?
>> I WOULD SAY OF HIS INTERVIEW,
IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLACE BLAME
ON THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN THIS
COUNTRY IN MY JUDGMENT, THERE IS
ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HOT
POLITICAL RHETORIC, YES, BUT SO
DOES -- WHAT'S, A MONTH AGO,
SECRETARY CLINTON SAID WE
SHOULDN'T BE CIVIL TO THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I CAN REMEMBER A FAMOUS COMEDIAN
ON TELEVISION HOLDING THE FAKE
SEVERED HEAD OF PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I HAVE HEARD SOME OF MY
COLLEAGUES ON CAPITOL HILL
SCIENCE WHEN YOU SEE A
REPUBLICAN IN A RESTAURANT,
HARASS HIM OR HER.
>> Sandra: AND ALL OF THIS
HAPPENING TO MITCH McCONNELL
AND HIS WIFE.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS
TIT-FOR-TAT.
THERE RHETORIC IN OUR COUNTRY IS
HOT.
ALL SIDES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
IT.
EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF
CIRCUMSTANCES --
>> Sandra: WE STILL DON'T KNOW
THE MOTIVE.
>> IT MAY WELL BE SOME WHACK
JOB.
IT COULD BE SOMEBODY WHO IS JUST
ANGRY AT OPPONENTS OF THE
PRESIDENT.
>> Sandra: BECAUSE WE ARE JUST
GETTING THAT IN HERE, THIS QUICK
CLIP OF JEFF SESSIONS.
SPOKE JUST A MOMENT AT THE
NATIONAL OPIOID SUMMIT AT THE
DOJ.
HE MADE SOME COMMENTS ON THE
NEWS.
LISTEN.
>> WE CONDEMNED THE ACCIDENT,
THESE ACTIVITIES.
IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERM.
WE ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT
AND JUSTICE IS DONE.
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET YOUR
QUICK RESPONSE TO THAT.
>> WE WILL FIND THIS PERSON.
