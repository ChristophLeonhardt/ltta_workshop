ROBERTS AND TALK THAT THE HISTORIC SUMMIT COULD STILL HAPPEN. GOOD EVENING, JOHN. GOOD EVENING TO YOU, MIKE. LAST WEEK A TEAM FROM THE WHITE HOUSE WENT TO SINGAPORE TO MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREANS TO SET UP THE WHOLE SUMMIT. THAT TEAM SAT ON THE GROUND FOR THREE DAYS. THE NORTH KOREANS NEVER SHOWED THERE WAS WORD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO GO BACK AGAIN TONIGHT. THAT WAS OFF AND BACK ON. NOW THERE IS TALK SWIRLING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE THAT, IN FACT, THAT TEAM MAY BE HEADED BACK TO SINGAPORE TO MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREANS TO GET THIS SUMMIT BACK ON TRACK SOME TIME THIS WEEKEND. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES. 24 HOURS AFTER HE SENT A LETTER TO KIM JONG UN CANCELING THEIR SUMMIT. PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY SAID IT MIGHT BE BACK ON. WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE'RE TALKING TO THEM NOW. IT WAS A VERY NICE STATEMENT THEY PUT OUT. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT COULD EVEN BE THE 12TH. WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW. THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO DO IT. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. TURN AROUND HAPPENED AFTER UNCHARACTERISTICALLY DIPLOMATIC RESPONSE FROM NORTH KOREA TO THE LETTER. NORTH KOREA SAYING IT IS STILL WILLING TO MEET THE U.S. AT ANY TIME IN ANY FORMAT ADDING WE REMAIN UNCHANGED IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR THE PEACE AND STABILITY OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA. WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE THE UNITED STATES TIME AND OPPORTUNITY. PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDING IN KIND ON TWITTER, QUOTE: VERY GOOD NEWS TO RECEIVE THE WARM AND PRODUCTIVE STATEMENT FROM NORTH KOREA. WE WILL SOON SEE WHERE IT WILL LEAD. HOPEFULLY TO LONG AND ENDURING PROSPERITY AND PEACE. ONLY TIME AND TALENT WILL TELL. AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AIDES RUSHED TO CONTACT THEIR COURT PARTS IN NORTH KOREA TO TRY TO PUT THINGS BACK TOGETHER FOR JUNE 129. WITH THE CAVEAT THAT NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT COMING TO THE TABLE. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS MORNING, CERTAINLY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MEETING, BUT THE PRESIDENT IS NOT JUST LOOKING TO HAVE A MEETING, HE IS NOT LOOKING FOR JUST A CHEAP POLITICAL STUNT, HE WANTS TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S A LONG-LASTING AND ACTUAL REAL SOLUTION. AS THE WHITE HOUSE PREPARED TO SEND BACK TO SINGAPORE AN ADVANCE TEAM THE NORTH KOREANS STOOD UP LAST WEEKEND, DEMOCRATS SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE USED THAT AS THE REASON FOR POSTPONING THE SUMMIT RATHER THAN THE WHITE HOUSE STATED RATIONALE FOR CANCELING IT THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MEETING WITH NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO THREATEN NUCLEAR CONFRONTATION. WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE IS SIMPLY ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE DELAYING THE SUMMIT TO A DATE NOT DESIGNATED AND SAY OUT REASON FOR IT WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP TO THE PLANNING MEETING. IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP TO THE PLANNING MEETING IT'S HARD TO PLAN AND GET THINGS DONE BY JUNE 129. BUT, BY CANCELING IT, IT MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PEACE THAN WE ARE. THAT'S A MISTAKE. PRESIDENT TRUMP TELLS FOX NEWS HE HAS REACHED A DEAL TO SAVE CHINESE TELECOM GIANT ZTE. AFTER THE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SHUTTERED ZTE FOR SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS IN NORTH KOREA AND IRAN. XI CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP TO. XI INITIALLY OFFERED A FINE OF $500 MILLION AND CHANGE OUT THE MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF ZTE. PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTED THE FINE BE HIGHER, 1.5 BILLION IN ADDITION TO MANAGEMENT AND BOARD CHANGES, PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WANTED SECURITY GUARANTEES AND A PROMISE THAT ZTE WILL BUY MOST OF ITS COMPONENTS FROM U.S. COMPANIES. XI COUNTERED WITH A BILLION-DOLLAR FINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD FOX NEWS THEY EVENTUALLY SETTLED ON 1.3 BILLION. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DEAL DREW FIRE FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO TWEETING: YES, THEY HAVE A DEAL IN MIND. IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR ZTE AND CHINA. CHINA CRUSHES U.S. COMPANIES WITH NO MERCY AND THEY USE THESE TELECOM COMPANIES TO SPY AND STEAL FROM US. MANY HOPES THIS TIME WOULD BE DIFFERENT. NOW CONGRESS WILL NEED TO ACT. NOT SURPRISINGLY DEMOCRATS WERE CRITICAL OF THE DEAL AS WELL THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI CALLING IT, QUOTE, STAGGERING BETRAYAL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTED TO FOX NEWS THAT HE HAS BEEN FAR TOUGHER ON ZTE THAN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EVER WAS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY CONSIDERED SANCTIONS AGAINST ZTE AND THEN BACKED OFF.
