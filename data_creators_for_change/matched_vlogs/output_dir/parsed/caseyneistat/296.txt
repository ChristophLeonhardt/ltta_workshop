wanna see the coolest thing I've ever
seen in an airplane seat
when I think of the greatest days in my
entire life I think of when my children
were born or perhaps when my son
graduated high school or today when I
was upgraded from business to first
thought Emirates
I don't know what I did to deserve this
I really don't snack writing kit or in
the air just left Dubai
we have outdoors
it's like my own little house over here
total privacy
the TV here is enormous it's like a
movie theater
it's touchscreen
but you can also control it with this
thing
it's like a mini iPad remote now if I
want a drink and I don't have to call
them
and that the fact that that's motorized
is just ridiculous completely
unnecessary
Mercer told me that I just order
whatever I want whatever I want
there's no mealtime you just tell him to
cook you something and they cook him
like being at a real restaurant
this this is caviar
if you don't know caviar is efficient
salty
in addition to the amenities kit this
lovely thing which has all kinds of
great surprises in it like shaving cream
and D / and all kinds of like
gimme this big bag see
and in here
slippers
I shade
in pajamas very nice I brought my own
pajamas but I appreciate the gesture all
right this is what it looks like when it
goes from a seat from the chair to a
band
this is more comfortable than my bed at
home
so cozy
the moment has arrived she just told me
my shower is ready so you have to
reserve the shower like make a
reservation I reserved it for as close
to landing as possible he'll and in an
hour and 45 minutes so it's shower time
so
once you're inside yeah you close the
door and you adjust the temperature
you find you press that button the water
account you press again to stop
this is it
the dream showering on an airplane I've
got 30 minutes in here to do whatever I
want I got five minutes of running water
in the shower I get 25 other minutes to
fill
that's a real working
dreams do come true I am showering on
their friends
this is amazing it's everything I hope
you would do
I am 43,000 feet in the air right now I
feel fresh and clayman thus concludes my
airplane shower spots experience
thank you
truly truly extraordinary experience did
you shower how was it incredible right
see you later thank you it really does
change your whole relationship with
travel when you take what was the most
painful part of traveling and instead of
that being a terrible experience it goes
from pain
like a meatball
dish
