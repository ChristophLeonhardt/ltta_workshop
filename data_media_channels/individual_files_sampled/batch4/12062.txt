the Trump administration has withdrawn an Obama policy directing local schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice the move has caused progressive men to twist their panties into a bunch while progressive women are tearing at their beards in rage at issue is whether boys under the mistaken impression their girls can use bathrooms meant for girls under the mistaken impression there are no boys in the girl's room girls under the mistaken impression their boys may also wish to use the boys room so that they can be bullied mercilessly and have psychological problems for the rest of their lives the Obama administration felt these rights were enshrined in the Constitution in James Madison's immortal phrase at slay eBay's e cray although the phrase appears only in Obama's copy the transgender issue has absolutely galvanized the left who took time off from running through the streets shrieking obscenities vandalizing businesses and assaulting bystanders in order to take to the streets screaming obscenities vandalizing businesses and assaulting bystanders in the name of transgender bathroom rights as one leftist reporter as one leftist protester put it quote if the Trump administration can stop boys who think they're girls from using the girls bathroom soon it will be able to stop men who think their Eagles from throwing themselves off cliffs to catch sparrows in their teeth in midair that's not the America I know and love unquote at the New York Times a former newspaper nearly half of the op-ed page was dedicated to the transgender issue because it affects so many times journalists who are both men and women under the mistaken impression they're men Times op-ed columnist Clarion irrelevant wrote in his or her column quote for years we progressives have been changing the inherent nature of reality by describing things falsely and shouting down conservatives who tried to tell the truth until at last the world became full of unicorns crapping leftist rainbows if you were sin transgender bathroom writes these unicorns will have nowhere to go and we'll be forced to live in a world without leftist rainbow crap unquote The Times later issued a correction saying the columnist medication had been too to the wrong address this Cuomo Chris Cuomo as a physician at CNN is a blithering knucklehead was asked what he would tell a twelve-year-old girl who didn't wish to see a boy's penis in her bathroom Cuomo tweeted in response and I grieve to tell you I'm not making this up quote I wonder if she's the problem or her overprotective and intolerant dad teach tolerance unquote coworkers say Cuomo has changed since he met Milo you Napoles on the website kid love calm the simple truth of the matter is that this is not an attack on transgenders at all Obama's federal intrusion into local schools was deemed illegal by a US District Court and the Trump administration simply decided to rescind the policy rather than spend tax dollars defending it on appeal no true American would actually abuse transgender people after all this country was founded by men wearing long white wings trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan

look like the Oscars looked last night all right we will bring on the honorary black gay cultural correspondent Michael Knowles in a little while but first I want to talk just a little bit about what happens at CPAC and why I think it's actually kind of important and interesting and it's going to unfold probably this very week some of the results are going to fold this very week so what happened was CPAC obviously is where conservatives especially young conservatives gathering it's always they always take a straw poll at the end and the most Conservative candidate usually wins it's like last year Ted Cruz was the big guy and now Donald Trump who a lot of conservatives have questions about right shows up and he takes the place over and Kellyanne Conway made this kind of offhand joke CPAC is gonna turn it into tea pack and a lot of conservatives got upset because they thought no you know we're not gonna just follow Donald Trump to whatever he wants to do you know we're gonna keep our conservative principles all that turned out to be completely untrue SC PAC went nuts for Trump so Trump gets up and he gives a you know kind of his usual stump speech really and CPAC goes crazy here he is talking about Obama and what he inherited this is number two we inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years think of it 20 trillion dollars it's doubled and we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another we don't win anymore what was the last time we won do we win a war do we win anything do we win anything we're gonna win we're gonna win big folks we're gonna start winning again believe me but we're taking a firm bold and decisive vision we have to to turn things around the era of empty talk is over it's over so you could hear the protester being carried out seat back on USA USA they just they just totally plunked for Trump and Trump it did one really good thing that I really like he went along he started out with a long rant on the media and pointed out that even they're reporting on his attacks of fake news turned out to be fake news that they said said he had called the press enemies of the people and that's not quite what he said according to Trump here he goes and I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news it's fake phony fake a few days ago I called the fake dues the enemy of the people and they are they are the enemy of the people because they have no sources they just make them up when there were none I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed there are no nine people I don't believe there was one or two people nine people and I said give me a break because I know the people I know who they talk to there were no nine people but they say nine people and somebody reads it they think oh nine people they have nine sources they make up sources they're very dishonest people in fact in covering my comments the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people the fakeness they dropped off the word think so even these what they're reporting on fake news is fake news and he did reiterate his allegiance to the First Amendment which we all like to hear that's always good because he is at war with the press and he's rightly at war with the press he cancelled he said he's not going to the White House Correspondents Dinner and he sent out a tweet saying have a great evening you know because the whole point of the White House correspondent is you know what did what happens to that cat that Correspondents Dinner is they show up and they allow Barack Obama to do a great comic routine and he's very charming and he does it really well but if a Republican shows up then he has to sit there with a forced smile on his face while some hack comedian rips into pieces and Trump just said no you know I mean it's same thing about the n-double a-c-p you know they always go he didn't go to the n-double-a-cp it's a civil rights group it was a civil rights group it's now a Democrat front group and the same thing is true with a White House Correspondents Dinner because the same thing is true of the press so Donald Trump is handling this really well and CPAC backs him but the most important thing that happened to CPAC and the thing that made a lot of news was that Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus sat down together now this is there's all this theoretically fake news about the fact that they hate each other and they're struggling with each other and all this and Bannen just came out and said it's it's ridiculous but Priebus made the point the two of them together represent a coming together of conservatism and the Republican Party because the Republican Party has been a vehicle for conservative but it's never it hasn't really been a conservative party since Reagan who remember took over the Republican Party they didn't want to give it to him you know he took over the Republican Party in the same way in a similar way to Trump so here is Priebus talking about why the Priebus Bannen coalition is a good thing it's Donald Trump President Trump brought together the party and the conservative movement and I've got to tell you if the party in the conservative movement are together similar to Steve and I it can't be stopped and President Trump was the one guy he was the one person and I can say it after overseeing 16 people kill each other it was Donald Trump that was able to bring this this party in this movement together and Steven I know that and we live it every day our job is to get the agenda of President Trump through the door and on pen and paper you know the the New York Times a former newspaper did a story about this transgender thing and I wasn't kidding in that opening when I said half their op-ed page was dedicated to this train you know this is a this is a policy that has been ruled illegal by a US District Court it affects maybe 17 people in the entire country it's an absurd overreach of federal government into local schools right so they get rid of it in the new york times has this sourced anonymous source story telling how it happened and the story is that jeff sessions said look we're not going to spend taxpayer dollars appealing this there's no reason in law for us there's no excuse in the law for us to be reaching into local schools and Betsy DeVos the education secretary she came in and said no I you know I I think we should leave this in place because we don't want to give the impression that we want transgender kids to be bullied and so there were two sides that were arguing it out and Trump made the decision to go with sessions and The Times ran this as if it was some kind of sinister thing of like cast I thought that's exactly how I want the White House to run that's exactly how I want the White House to run I want people with diverse used to come in and make their case on the president to make a decision between them sound sounds good to me so Priebus is saying that Trump has around himself United these two poles of the party then Bannon really did himself a favor because Bannon is being demonized he doesn't like to put his face in front of the press he likes to be the guy behind the power behind this scene and he came out and just showed himself to be an intellectual engine for the ideas of the Trump administration play the number-5 this is him explaining that you know economic nationalism and cutting down on the administrative state what he called deconstructing the administrative state all these regulatory agencies that act extra legally this is part of their agenda the mainstream media don't get this but we're already working in consultation with the hill people are starting to think through a whole raft of amazing and innovative bilateral relationships bilateral trading relationships with people that will reposition America in the world as a fair trading nation and start to bring jobs high value-added manufacturing jobs back to the United States of America on the on the on the national security part it was certainly the first I think the first to EOS that you started seeing implemented here of the last couple of days under general Kelly and that is the rule of law is going to exist when you talk about our sovereignty and you talk about immigration General Kelly and attorney general sessions are adamantly you know that and you're going to start to see I think with the defense budget we're going to talk about next week when we took bring the budget out and also with certain things about the plan on Isis and what general Madison these guys think you I think you're starting to see the other part of that but the third this regulation you know every business leader we've had in is saying not just taxes but it is it is also the regulation I think the consistent if you look at these cabinet appointees they were selected for a reason and that is the deconstruction the way the progressive left runs is if they can't get it passed they're just going to put in some sort of regulation in a in an agency that's all going to be deconstructed and I think that that's why this regulatory thing is home you know so he shows up as Krauthammer says he shows that he doesn't have horns he shows he's not in an evil guy here's why I think this matters and I understand the Conservatives are that the party is going to go over you know follow Trump away from conservatism because Trump has certain instincts that are not conservative and I have those concerns too and recent polls show that Donald Trump's popularity which is lower than any president at this point hinges on people like me it hinges on people who voted really against Hillary Clinton who don't really you know have some suspicions against him but so far so far I'm really happy with what he's doing but there are three things going on at once one is we've got the press which has gone insane so the press isn't saying is Russian spies under the bed and you know everything's a scandal and every word Donald Trump says is stupid and they've gone absolutely nuts they made complete clowns of themselves they're absurd but it does create this aspect of hysteria and panic and what you notice they'll do is they'll they'll then start to say in their leads they'll just say the scandal ract beginning of the Trump administration you think let's kill Mike Flynn that's the scandal right really but they just assume that this the fake stuff they've said is all true and that's how it becomes part of the culture it gets into the narrative so that's one thing and another thing the other thing is the president who keeps saying stuff that isn't so and some of it I've got to be honest I don't care about I don't care if he you know says the crowds at my inauguration were bigger than the crowds leaving you know Egypt in back of Moses I don't care if he says that stuff but I do care when he says we're gonna take Iraqi oil and the Iraqis think wait are we being invaded are they coming to rob our oil you know we can't make friends with the people on the ground that we need to make for that the military needs to make friends with so I care when he went I care when his loose lips you know cause him to say stuff that matters but then there's the stuff that's being done the appointments and the excellent appointments excellent Supreme Court justice pick excellent meeting with Netanyahu reestablishing our ties to Israel all this stuff that's really that really has been going extremely well so there's a lot of confusion because the press is throwing up the smoke screen because Trump is such an outrageous character and at the same time the government seems to be working pretty well now it's time for Congress to step up I've been calling them the waldo congress because where are they right so the waldo Congress now has to step up and there's now kind of word from sources that they're going to just throw a repeal and replace Obamacare bill out there so that people have to vote for it or else really these guys will be voted out of office if they don't repeal Obamacare they're gonna start to do the stuff that they have been promising to do and let's see them get it done and the reason it matters that Trump and and Bannon gin up the base is they have to know their support if his popularity is so low they're gonna lie low they're cowards they're gonna lie low until they know that Trump has enough support to make their jobs difficult okay when he comes in there with support and when people say hey we are not voting for you unless you repeal Obamacare and reform taxes and do all this stuff then they'll act and that's why CPAC I think was largely a good thing largely Trump and Bannon and previous did the right thing and got the conservative base behind them all right we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but if you want to hear the great and powerful what is your name again Michael Knowles but here talking about the Oscars come over to the daily wire.com and if you subscribe you can actually throw a beanbag a belief Michaels chair and he will sink into the water
