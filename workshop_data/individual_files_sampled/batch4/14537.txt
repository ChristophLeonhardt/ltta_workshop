bashing President Trump is the activity of choice here in Hollywood I can't go anywhere in this town without hearing how this administration is going to be the end of the world and in the next few months you will be subjected to that idiotic rhetoric too as a word season is upon us we are going to talk about that and more today in this week's rebel buzz this week late-night talk show hosts are jumping at the chance to praise the diversity of this year's Oscar nominations it's the trendy thing to do right so the shape of water haven't seen it is at the top of the stack with 13 nominations including Best Picture now I'm positive you've all been feverishly awaiting this year's Oscar nominations to be announced or maybe not yeah me neither so what's the reason for my lack of enthusiasm well because even though I'm the Hollywood conservative I recognize the ludicrous farcical self-aggrandizing nature of award season it's like senior superlatives in high school where all the cool kids Pat each other on their varsity jacket and backs and America's collective response is all together now we don't care nonetheless social media bombards us with celebrity theses promising that this this will be the best award show ever so watch guys please please okay so Hollywood might think that flyover America is as dumb as a bag of hair but fortunately unlike celebrities we learned from our mistakes and we are not glutton for punishment after years of watching the Oscars we know it's more like the movie Groundhog Day the formula is clear opening monologue that shames normal Americans and the president presume he's a Republican speeches that describe Hollywood stars and starlets as martyrs more speeches fawning over craft and brilliance of other Hollywood insiders and then the closing monologue prompting a call for action to hash tag resist our Republican president so I think I'll make sure that I have other plans on Oscar night like maybe cleaning out my fridge vacuuming getting a dental cleaning yeah pretty much anything also in this week's news Republicans won the government shutdown with new Democrats know that they're in trouble when they can't Eve get the lefts paper of record the New York Times to sign on with their agenda to shut down the government over a small percentage of the population who are here illegally on Friday Chuck Schumer was willing to jeopardize veterans active military members and children covered under chip which is children's health insurance program as you all know which aids parents in seeking and obtaining medical treatment for their kids but lo and behold on Monday his change of heart signaled a realization that Democrats really couldn't win this political game of chicken numerous polls have shown that in fact we Americans we do have heart and we do care about the lives of the daka population by the way I refuse to call them dreamers we all have dreams I will go into what mine are you probably don't want to know what they're but according to a recent Harvard Cape's Harris Poll 58% of Americans oppose shutting down the government over daca negotiations the findings of the poll also revealed that most Americans are naturally in agreement with the conservative platform that compassion and benevolence are important but within reason also this week was another disturbing event the second annual women's March aka anti Trump rally that's really what it is rape you may recall the first one it was led by anti-semite Linda Sarsour and her terrorist pal resmio day to refresh your memory Sarsour is the same human rights activist who said that ayaan Hirsi Ali a victim of female genital mutilation deserves an ass-whooping and that she'd like to take her vagina away now there's a real feminist for you and again this year it wouldn't have been the place to take your non adult children handwritten signs with vulgar language sprinkled the crowds as well as lewd costumes and varying forms of partial nudity and shocker of shockers inclusion again is not part of the program as a trump supporter even though I'm a woman yes biologically I don't just feel like a woman cue the Shania Twain song here I wouldn't have been welcome there now during the first women's March I was in DC for the president generation and as I boarded my flight from Los Angeles to Reagan International heading back to my seat in the nosebleed section of coach I bypassed first-class we're like half the travels travelers were women in those ridiculous pink hats I thought to myself gosh what brand of oppression allows you to pay a thousand dollars or more for a first-class seat whatever it is I want some bet anyway then I realized that I'd rather sit and coach any day than be one of those screeching maniacal unhinged women in rows one through eight their cause might have celebrities like Eva Longoria Natalie Portman and scarlet johansson but my cause supports limited government and maximum freedom we support low taxation and oppose government corruption my cause we marched for veterans military and unborn babies if I have to give up a lifetime of first-class seats to see success in my cause I'll do it any day of the year every day of the year I'm Amanda Head the Hollywood conservative board the row if you like this content and are eager to hear more please subscribe to our premium service at WWWE forward slash
