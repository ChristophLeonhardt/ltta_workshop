welcome back well the Senate race here in Arizona is getting a lot of national attention there's also a governor's race going on right now in fact you talk to people you say what's the number-one issue they all say even when talking about the center is to say education and that's because of what's going on here in the governor's race the incumbent Republican Doug Ducey is facing Democrat David Garcia is a college professor former Army infantryman no previous elected political experience but he has been endorsed by former President Obama and as well as Bernie Sanders who will be campaigning with him next week now oddly enough he has not been endorsed by the Democratic nominee for the US Senate congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema something that is unusual if you will in as competitive a state as this david garcia joins me now welcome to the show thank you very much let me start with that and I know we were talking off-camera and you said congresswoman Sinema has endorsed any other Democrat that everybody runs their own race this is more of an Arizona Democratic thing but it just seems odd that were 20 days before the election have you endorsed Kyrsten Sinema no and she hasn't endorsed anybody to our knowledge you know one of the things that Democrats have done each each of us is we're each running our own race and I'm not sure that if you can stand back collectively and say should we working together but in my opinion I believe that what I bring out in terms of turnout with cinema brings out with respect to turnout or any other Democrat is a net positive for everybody else on the ticket it's just unusual because you look at the Florida candidates and both the Republicans and the Democrats are sort of hand-in-hand I'd look at the Republican side in this state it feels like there's a at least some coordination here doesn't this hurt you more than it helps you the lack of coordination again it is not just cinema and myself what you're gonna see in Arizona is we have people running for races all the way down the bottom of the ticket in my neighborhood in the primary we had four people running for Justice of the Peace for example and when that kind of energy is happening I believe that the turnout that every single candidate is going to bring out is going to be like I said a net positive for everybody else on the ticket as I indicated you ask any voter and it has been any age group what's the number-one issue and frankly come in Arizona professionally covering politics here however good 15 years and I would say the issue of public education has just been a it's very similar to where I grew up in Florida the populations growing faster than the resources that you have and then it becomes a fight over resources and you guys are having this debate over resources for education what is the one what do you think is the biggest issue in public education for the state right now so the reason it's an issue this time around is because of our teachers we got to be clear Arizona is one of the red four red states where our teachers took it upon themselves out of people instead of not be honest with you there was a lot of people surprised out east when places like Oklahoma and Arizona saw teacher protests and governors react and governor's respond well and you're looking at consistency these are all states that have taken very deep cuts in public education the number one issue is funding now some people would say they just everybody's for increased funding just not as much as what others would say that it isn't a full-fledged cut but one person's smaller increases another person's cut but let me just get that cap I'm trying to put my head around the Mac here I found like you work in our legislature I'm aware I'm aware everybody you know who will increase 10% who will increase 5% oh that's a cut the legislature and they said we were about to cut you 5% you're not cut so you're now I per se it is you're right about funny math yes stuff and budget math but what is that what is that big issue the big issue is funding our funding is that low in Arizona we have teachers working two three jobs in order to stay in the classroom and as long as our teachers have to work two or three jobs to stay in the classroom it isn't a profession and so what our teacher said and just to be clear here they also said it's about improving schools not just teacher pay but everybody who makes schools work first person my daughter sees in the morning is Miss Melanie our bus driver she's got an important job they're being cut as well our community colleges have been zeroed out at the state level and our universities have essentially been abandoned so education is the issue that is on everybody's mind every time we go to the door out there these days and politics you get pegged for who you associate yourself with and sometimes that's good sometimes it's bad Bernie Sanders is coming paying for you does that make you a Bernie Sanders Democrat let me tell you what it makes me it's gonna make us a turnout machine come next week it is unbelievable the amount of energy it is unbelievable amount of energy what bernie brings though is medicare for all and the talk of democratic socialism where do you fall in that i will tell you what we need to bring in arizona first inform our first and foremost and that is turnout turnout turnout turnout it when our demographic population of this state looks like when the voting population looks like the demographic population will have an idea of what the true voice of arizona is and bernie sanders is gonna join us at both of our university campuses and doing a phenomenal job bringing young people out to vote so their voices are you at all concerned that maybe sanders turns off that independent voter says you know what not a big fan of President Trump but oh well that's too far left for me I'm not what do you say to that voter I say that that that voter and everyone else out there is going to look at our campaign and what we stand for with a set of values and what Bernie Sanders is gonna bring what the college campuses are gonna bring is a focus on education we just started this you know with a clear understanding that education is the number one issue and the more people we can get to understand that and get to the polls the better off Arizona's gonna be let's talk about Latino turnout nationally we have seen it is Latino engagement this cycle is lagged behind where they where they were for the Democrats in 2006 for instance the last time Democrats did a big midterm wave there's a lot of theories going around as to why Latino engagement has been less so this cycle then I think a lot of people thought I think a lot of people thought the reaction to president Trump would actually in there would be a surge of the Latino engagement what what are we missing well I'll tell you what you're missing I'm from Arizona born born and raised I'm a fourth generation Arizona and Latinos have been asked to play defense over and over and over again including coming out and voting against Trump Arizona outside of our state is known for a lot of anti Latino anti-immigrant policies and the Latino community has been asked to play defense vote against this vote against that what we haven't had in a very long time is something to vote for and I believe that's what our campaign represents now I understand what's going on out there there's still a lot of negativity and what Nega does is it suppresses the vote it gets people to walk turn away from the electoral process what we need is enthusiasm and to give our Latino community something positive that they can vote for it's been a long time so I talked to a few Latinos Arizonans around here who feared raising their head on sure that's negative that's that's that's and I was just taken aback by it they know we are a state that has had a very negative approach with respect to immigration and the contributions of our Latino community and the way to get through that is not to say go out and vote against something else negative in my opinion the way to get away from that is to give our folks something positive to vote for this flag was bugging both it was if it you know maybe there's maybe it's a drone for all we know David ever CEO thanks for coming on sharing your views be safe on the
