foreign minister Lavrov today said it was a fabulous the talks were fabulous and better than super is that an understatement for bottom in Putin well better than super there's a phrase in Russian that mr. Lavrov used and he's not usually a giddy guy he's not a smiling guy and he was today they got everything I wanted I think they even got more than they wanted none of the past behavior that the greediest behavior that they've done over the last several years was brought up no mention of annexation no mention in Crimea in 2014 no mention of his support for a horrible dictator in Syria and the worst of it all as you just were describing when teed up to hit it out of the park for President Trump to push back on Vladimir Putin for what he did during our 2016 presidential election he chose not to push back it would have been so easy for him just to say a few words of you know we don't want you to do that or we think this is wrong he chose not to do it complete victory for Vladimir Putin Michael I don't speak Russian but can you translate essentially what Donald Trump said today did he just say to the President of Russia go ahead do it again you know what I really want to know is what he said in that private meeting for two hours we know what he said on the record which was pretty outrageous as far as I'm concerned no US president let's just be clear about this it's fine to meet with adversaries we did it during the Cold War it's fine to have summits but it generally throughout the last 70 or 80 years our presidents have pushed back on our adversaries they don't make jokes about him like they're nice competitors as the president did and again the president of the United States his job is to advance the American national interest that was not done today here in Helsinki hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about we're from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
