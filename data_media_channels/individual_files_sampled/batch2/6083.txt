very recently Corinthian Colleges which was one of the big corporations that had operated a number of for-profit colleges essentially dissolved because of the fact that it was defrauding so many students and the federal government went after them now that Corinthian Colleges doesn't exist any type of so-called degree or diploma that students were pursuing were null and void and so there was an agreement by the federal government under the Obama administration to provide debt relief to these students because they essentially ended up taking out loans after being defrauded and they didn't get a good education or even any type of degree as a result of that now in comes Betsy DeVos and things are a little different even though the federal government under Obama agreed to a debt relief program Betsy DeVos is essentially ignoring that program so let's give you some info on that the US Education Department has stopped cancelling the student loan debt of people defrauded by failed for-profit schools and those borrowers faced mounting interest and other burdens so let's focus on the second portion of that because that's honestly one of the more relevant parts so these people applied to get their you know their loans forgiven their debt forgiven and as they're waiting to hear back from the Department of Education interest is piling on to that outstanding loan and they went to Corinthian Colleges they were told by the government that they're gonna get those loans forgiven and then all of a sudden they're getting denied or they're not even hearing back from the Department of Education so now they're stuck owing more than they originally would have and it's because Betsy DeVos loves the for-profit colleges does not want to relieve this debt so according to this report by the inspector general DeVos also brought the existing cancellation process to a crawl so to give you specific numbers since Trump's inauguration in January on January 20th the department has received twenty five thousand nine hundred ninety one claims for discharging loans it has denied two requests and approved nun that's it that's all they've done with all of those claims just completely ignoring them or denying two of them that's it so it to give you some context in the about the last half a year of Obama's administration they got forty six thousand two hundred seventy four claims so more than that under Trump they didn't unlike Trump they denied none of them okay now they couldn't approve all of them because it goes through a process and and they could only do so much that last half a year but they approved so Trump approved none Obama approved twenty seven thousand nine hundred and eighty six so if you have student loans it is crystal clear who's on your side and who's against you so the Trump administration is on the side of the banks hey you got a crap education from this for-profit college it was worthless you got rooked you got robbed obama came in and said for the people who were robbed you know what we don't want to help you robbers okay we want to make sure that you're not burden with that because you're not you can't even do anything with that right you can and it went under so there's all the money that you that you spent on that is now totally useless you can't even get a job with it it's even worse than this right because look they did defraud these students so they inflated job gainful employment numbers for instance let's say you were going to one of these schools to become a chef I always give this example because it's easy to understand if you're a student and you know maybe inquiring about the the program you want to know what is the likelihood of me getting a job if I take out all these loans and get an education here and the recruiters who were incredibly aggressive would tell the students well ninety five percent of our student body go on to become chefs but in reality they would use numbers from former students who were employed at McDonald's as examples of people who got gainful employment as chefs so they were that's just one example they would do all sorts of tricky things to convince these students to take out these loans and the reason why the Obama administration regulated these for-profit colleges was because the taxpayers in America we're on the hook for a lot of these loans ninety-five percent or more of the revenue that would go into these for-profit colleges were because of federal student loans and so Obama's like no we're not gonna do this this is not okay you know who is okay with that Betsy DeVos she hates those regulations the gainful employment regulations that apply to for-profit colleges hates them she was very clear about that during her confirmation hearings so she wants to further deregulate these for-profit colleges who will in turn obviously because they have a profit motive continue to defraud these students okay and then when they can't pay back these loans who do you think is on the hook yeah the students are on the hook but that's taxpayer money so yeah so if if you are a big bank you're gonna love the Trump administration because you're gonna get to make more loans than they and they're gonna be forced to pay back whether it makes sense or not also of course that affects the US taxpayers because a lot of it is backed up by US but but if you're a student they're not looking out for you at all you don't care about you look at the tax proposals they want to tax your stipend the measly stipend you get is a graduate student they want to tax tuition that's been waived the GOP and the Trump administration does not care about the little guy they've never cared about the little guy and if you ever bought into it you were conned it's time to wake up they're gonna tax your stipend that you're barely surviving on but they made a new loophole for private jets in that same tax cut plan Betsy DeVos was not put in to be to the become a Secretary of Education to get you more educated she was brought into the to do the opposite funnel as much of the taxpayer money into private organizations that are going to get rich off of it as possible okay and to make sure that the public schools are starved and and and that the students at this point even the ones that were defrauded are going to have to suffer and try to pay back those loans anyway well to us this looks like the problem to them it looks like mission accomplished if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network calm /join and
