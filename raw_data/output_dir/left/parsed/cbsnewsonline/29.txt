HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF 
PROTESTERS, SINCE THE 
NOMINATION WAS ANNOUNCED. 
APART FROM HER, THE ONLY OTHER 
SENATOR WHO HAS NOT INDICATED 
WHICH WAY HE WILL VOTE IS 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, 
THEY VOTED YES FOR CLOTURE, IT 
PASSED 51-49, ALONG PARTY 
LINES, THE ONLY ONE TO GO 
AGAINST HIS CONFIRMATION WAS 
LISA MURKOWSKI. 
A CBSN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR 
AND A CAPITOL HILL  REPORTER 
FOR THE HILL, MOLLY, THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US, I WANT TO START 
WITH MURKOWSKI, I KNOW SHE 
VOTED NO TO MOVE IT FORWARD, I 
KNOW PEOPLE USUALLY SAY THAT'S 
AN INDICATION OF WHERE SHE WILL 
VOTE, DOES IT MEAN, AND HAVE WE 
HEARD ANYTHING FURTHER, THAT 
HER ACTUAL VOTE WILL BE NO? 
>> IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT, 
BUT GOING INTO THE CHAMBER, SHE 
TOLD REPORTERS THAT ESSENTIALLY 
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A GOOD MAN, 
BUT HE'S NOT THE RIGHT MAN FOR 
THE COURT AT THIS TIME, AND 
EARLIER THURSDAY, THE DAYS SEEM 
TO BE RUNNING TOGETHER, SHE MET 
WITH SEXUAL SURVIVORS FROM 
ALASKA IN HER OFFICE, THAT 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT ON 
WHETHER OR NOT SHE WANTED TO 
MOVE THE NOMINATION FORWARDOR 
NOT, KEEP IN MIND, IF THE SENATE
DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD, AND IN 
THIS WAY, THE SENATE WILL MAKE 
THE POST AND THE DECISION ON 
WHETHER TO CONFIRM OR NOT, ON 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AS LATE AS 
5:30 PM SATURDAY, AND AGAIN, A 
LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND 
THEN, TALKING TO SEVERAL 
SENATORS AFTER THIS MORNING'S 
VOTE, I ASKED, ARE YOU TALKING 
TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, 
AND FOR THE MOST PART, I'VE 
HEARD IT SAYING THAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO LET THEM KEEP IT TO 
THEIR OWN COUNSEL, NOT TRYING TO
PUSH THEM EITHER WAY, A NUMBER 
PROTESTERS, BUT THEY WERE SOON 
CLEARED OUT, IT'S A LOT MORE 
QUITE UP HERE THAN IT HAS BEEN 
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.>> I WAS 
STRUCK BY SENATOR FLAKE, HE 
WOULD VOTE YES, SOMETHING BIG 
HAPPENS, IS HE HUDDLING WITH 
OTHER SENATORS, WHO HAS HE BEEN 
TALKING TO RECENTLY?>> IN THIS 
PROCESS, EACH DAY SEEMS LIKE A 
LIFETIME, AND YOU NEVER KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR 
UNFOLD, AFTER ESSENTIALLY TWO 
WEEKS AGO, OR THREE WEEKS, 
SEPTEMBER 14, WHEN THE 
REVELATION, THE ALLEGATION THAT 
HE HAD COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT 
WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, 
MOST SENATORS HAVE A COVENANT 
WITH THEIR ANSWERS, BARRING 
ANYTHING UNFORESEEN. 
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT, MANY OF 
THEM, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,
DID NOT SEE THAT LETTER COMING 
OUT, OR THE ALLEGATIONS COMING 
OUT, UNTIL THE 11th HOUR, THAT 
IS SOMETHING, A REAR END 
APPEAR, UNTIL THE FINAL VOTE 
HAPPENS. 
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COLLINS 
HERE, WHICH IS THE VOTE WE ARE 
WATCHING, EAGER TO HEAR WHAT 
SHE HAS TO SAY, WHAT IS SHE 
FACING WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL 
POLITICS BACK HOME?>> SHE 
DOESN'T HAVE REELECTION UNTIL 
20-22 -- 2022, ALREADY ONE OF 
THE HOUSE MEMBERS WHO COULD BE 
THERE, SUSAN COLLINS, FOR 
KAVANAUGH, SHE WOULD GET INTO 
THE RACE, FACING A LOT OF 
PRESSURE FROM THE FOLKS WHO ARE 
AGAINST KAVANAUGH, THEY'VE BEEN 
SENDING WIRE COAT HANGERS, TO 
HER OFFICE, THREATENING MEMBERS,
OF HER FEMALE STAFFERS, REPORTS 
THAT ONE FEMALE STAFFER, ONE 
ANTI-KAVANAUGH PROTESTER 
THREATENED TO RAPE ONE OF 
COLLINS FEMALE STAFFERS, AND 
REALLY, I THINK WHEN IT COMES 
TO COLLINS, THERE HAVE BEEN VERY
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS, TO FORCE 
COLLINS TO VOTE AGAINST 
KAVANAUGH, AND SHE IS ONE OF 
THOSE PEOPLE, NOT BOWING TO 
EITHER SIDE, IF YOU LOOK AT HER 
RECORD, SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN 
ONE OF THE QUOTE UNQUOTE GANGS 
ON CAPITOL HILL, WHEN THERE IS 
A DIVISIVE ISSUE, AND YOU NEED 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, 
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THOSE 
BROKERS, SHE IS NOT SWAYED 
NECESSARILY BY THIS.
>>> I APOLOGIZE, WE HAVE SUSAN 
COLLINS RIGHT NOW, WE ARE GOING 
TO ALLOW HER TO SPEAK AND HEAR 
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY ON THIS 
VOTE ON KAVANAUGH.
>>> SERGEANT! 
VOTE NO STAND UP FOR RAPED 
WOMEN!
>> AS A REMINDER TO OUR GUESTS 
IN THE GALLERIES, EXPRESSIONS 
OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL ARE 
NOT PERMITTED IN THE SENATE 
GALLERIES, THE SENATOR FOR 
MAINE.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE FIVE 
PREVIOUS TIMES THAT I HAVE COME 
TO THE FLOOR TO EXPLAIN MY VOTE 
ON THE NOMINATION OF A JUSTICE 
TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT, I HAVE BEGUN MY FLOOR 
REMARKS EXPLAINING MY DECISION 
WITH A RECOGNITION OF THE 
SOLEMN NATURE AND THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE OCCASION. 
BUT TODAY, WE HAVE COME TO THE 
CONCLUSION, OF A CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS THAT HAS BECOME SO 
DYSFUNCTIONAL IT LOOKS MORE LIKE
A CARICATURE OF A GUTTER LEVEL 
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN. 
THEN A SOLEMN OCCASION. 
-- THAN A SOLEMN OCCASION. 
THE PRESIDENT NOMINATED BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WITHIN -- ON JULY 9, 
WITHIN MOMENTS, SPECIAL 
INTEREST GROUPS RAISED TO BE 
THE FIRST TO OPPOSE THEM, 
INCLUDING ONE ORGANIZATION THAT 
DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FILL IN 
THE JUDGE'S NAME ON ITS 
PREWRITTEN PRESS RELEASE. 
THEY SIMPLY WROTE THAT THEY 
OPPOSED DONALD TRUMP'S 
NOMINATION OF X TO THE SUPREME 
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
A NUMBER OF SENATORS JOINED THE 
RACE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR 
OPPOSITION, BUT THEY WERE 
BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY ONE OF 
OUR COLLEAGUES, WHO ACTUALLY 
ANNOUNCED OPPOSITION BEFORE THE 
NOMINEES -- NOMINEE'S IDENTITY 
WAS EVEN KNOWN. 
SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE SEEN 
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS WITH 
THEIR FOLLOWERS -- WHIP THEIR 
FOLLOWERS INTO A FRENZY, BY 
SPREADING MISREPRESENTATIONS 
AND OUTRIGHT FALSEHOODS ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S JUDICIAL 
RECORD. 
OVER-THE-TOP RHETORIC, AND 
DISTORTIONS OF HIS RECORD AND 
TESTIMONY AT HIS FIRST HEARING, 
PRODUCED SHORT-LIVED HEADLINES, 
WHICH ALTHOUGH DEBUNKED HOURS 
LATER, CONTINUED TO LIVE ON AND 
BE SPREAD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. 
INTEREST GROUPS HAVE ALSO SPENT 
AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF DARK 
MONEY OPPOSING THIS NOMINATION. 
OUR SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS HAS BEEN IN STEADY 
DECLINE FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 
ONE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE 
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION IS WHERE 
THE PROCESS HAS FINALLY HIT 
ROCK BOTTOM. 
AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, IT IS UP 
TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR TO 
DECIDE WHAT THE CONSTITUTION'S 
ADVICE AND CONSENT DUTY MEANS. 
INFORMED BY ALEXANDER HAMILTON
THIS -- HAMILTON'S, IN 1776, I 
HAVE INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BROAD 
DISCRETION TO CONSIDER A 
NOMINEES PHILOSOPHY, WHEREAS MY 
DUTY AS A SENATOR IS TO FOCUS 
ON THE NOMINEES QUALIFICATIONS, 
AS LONG AS THAT NOMINEES 
PHILOSOPHY IS WITHIN THE 
MAINSTREAM OF JUDICIAL THOUGHT. 
I HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED LITMUS 
TESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOMINEES 
WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PERSONAL 
VIEWS OR POLITICS. 
BUT I FULLY EXPECT THEM TO BE 
ABLE TO PUT ASIDE ANY AND ALL 
PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN 
DECIDING THE CASES THAT COME 
BEFORE THEM. 
I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THE 
PRESIDENT'S IDENTITY OR PARTY 
WHEN EVALUATING SUPREME COURT 
NOMINATIONS. 
AS A RESULT, I VOTED IN FAVOR 
OF JUSTICES ROBERTS AND ALITO, 
WHO WERE NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT 
BUSH, JUSTICES SOTOMAYOR AND 
KAGAN, WHO WERE NOMINATED BY 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND JUSTICE 
NEIL GORSUCH, WHO WAS NOMINATED 
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.
>>> SO I BEGAN MY EVALUATION OF 
HIS NOMINATION BY REVIEWING HIS 
12 YEAR RECORD ON THE DC 
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. 
INCLUDING HIS MORE THAN 300 
OPINIONS AND HIS MANY SPEECHES 
AND LOG REVIEW ARTICLES. 
19 ATTORNEYS, INCLUDING LAWYERS 
FROM THE NONPARTISAN 
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE, 
BRIEFED ME MANY TIMES EACH WEEK,
AND ASSISTED ME IN EVALUATING 
THE JUDGES EXTENSIVE RECORD. 
I MET WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOR 
MORE THAN TWO HOURS, AND MY 
OFFICE. 
I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THE 
TESTIMONY AT THE COMMITTEE 
HEARINGS, I SPOKE WITH PEOPLE 
WHO KNEW HIM PERSONALLY, SUCH 
AS CONDOLEEZZA RICE, AND MANY 
OTHERS. 
AND I TALKED WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH A SECOND TIME BY PHONE
FOR ANOTHER HOUR, TO ASK HIM A 
VERY SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL 
QUESTIONS. 
I ALSO HAVE MET WITH THOUSANDS 
OF MY CONSTITUENTS, BOTH 
ADVOCATES AND MANY OPPONENTS, 
REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
ONE CONCERN THAT I FREQUENTLY 
HEARD WAS THAT THE JUDGE WOULD 
BE LIKELY TO ELIMINATE THE 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S VITAL 
PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-
EXISTIN CONDITIONS. 
I DISAGREE WITH THIS CONTENTION.
AND A DISSENT IN 7 SKY VS HOLDER
, JUDGE KAVANAUGH REJECTED A 
CHALLENGE ON NARROW PROCEDURAL 
GROUNDS, PRESERVING THE LAW IN 
FULL. 
MANY EXPERTS HAVE SAID THAT HIS 
DISSENT INFORMED JUSTICE 
ROBERTS OPINION UPHOLDING THE 
ACA AT THE SUPREME COURT. 
FURTHERMORE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
APPROACH TOWARD THE DOCTRINE OF 
SEVERABILITY IS NARROW, WHEN A 
PART OF A STATUTE IS CHALLENGED 
ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS, HE 
HAS ARGUED FOR SEVERING THE 
INVALID CLAUSE, AS SURGICALLY 
AS POSSIBLE. 
WHILE ALLOWING THE OVERALL LAW 
TO REMAIN INTACT. 
THIS WAS HIS APPROACH AND HIS 
DISSENT IN THE CASE INVOLVED A 
CHALLENGE TO THE STRUCTURE OF 
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL 
PROTECTION BUREAU. 
IN HIS DISSENT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
ARGUED FOR QUOTE, SEVERING ANY 
PROBLEMATIC PORTIONS WHILE 
LEAVING THE REMAINDER INTACT.
". GIVEN THE CURRENT CHALLENGES 
TO THE ACA, PROPONENTS, 
INCLUDING MYSELF, OF 
PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH 
EXISTING CONDITIONS, SHOULD 
WANTED JUSTICE WHO WOULD TAKE 
JUST THIS KIND OF APPROACH.
>>> ANOTHER ASSERTION THAT I 
HAVE HEARD OFTEN IS THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH CANNOT BE TRUSTED IF 
A CASE INVOLVING ALLEGED 
WRONGDOING BY THE PRESIDENT 
WERE TO COME BEFORE THE COURT. 
THE BASIS FOR THIS ARGUMENT 
SEEMS TO BE TWOFOLD, FIRST, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS WRITTEN 
THAT HE BELIEVES THAT CONGRESS 
SHOULD ENACT LEGISLATION TO 
PROTECT PRESIDENTS FROM 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, OR CIVIL 
LIABILITY WHILE IN OFFICE. 
MR. PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE 
OPPONENTS MISS THE MARK ON THIS 
ISSUE. 
THE FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
OFFERED THIS LEGISLATIVE 
PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT HE 
BELIEVES THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DOES NOT HAVE SUCH PROTECTION 
CURRENTLY.
>>> SECOND, THERE ARE SOME WHO 
ARGUE THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT 
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD NOT EVEN 
BE ALLOWED TO NOMINATE A 
JUSTICE. 
THAT ARGUMENT IGNORES OUR 
RECENT HISTORY. 
PRESIDENT CLINTON IN 1993 
NOMINATED JUSTICE GINSBURG 
AFTER THE WHITEWATER 
INVESTIGATION WAS ALREADY 
UNDERWAY. 
AND SHE WAS CONFIRMED 96-3. THE 
NEXT YEAR, JUST THREE MONTHS 
AFTER AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, 
ROBERT FISK, WAS NAMED TO LEAD 
THE WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION, 
PRESIDENT CLINTON NOMINATED 
JUSTICE BREYER, HE WAS 
CONFIRMED 87-9.
>>> SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE 
NOT HESITATED TO RULE AGAINST 
THE PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE 
NOMINATED THEM. 
PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY, IN THE 
UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON, 3 
NIXON APPOINTEES WHO HEARD THE 
CASE JOINED THE UNANIMOUS 
OPINION AGAINST HIM. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 
UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS BELIEF THAT 
NO PRESIDENT IS ABOVE THE LAW. 
HE HAS STATED THAT MARYBURY VS 
MADISON, YOUNGSTOWN STEELE 
VERSUS SAWYER, AND THE UNITED 
STATES VERSUS NIXON, R 3 OF THE 
4 GREATEST SUPREME COURT CASES 
IN HISTORY. 
WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON? 
EACH OF THEM IS A CASE WHERE 
CONGRESS SERVED AS A CHECK ON 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER. 
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE 
FOURTH CASE THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS POINTED TO AS THE 
GREATEST IN HISTORY WAS BROWN 
VERSUS THE BOARD OF 
EDUCATION.>>> ONE KAVANAUGH 
DECISION ILLUSTRATES THE POINT 
ABOUT THE CHECK ON PRESIDENTIAL 
POWER DIRECTLY, HE WROTE THE 
OPINION IN HAMDAN VS THE UNITED 
STATES, A CASE THAT CHALLENGES 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S 
MILITARY PROSECUTION OF AN 
ASSOCIATE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, 
THIS CONVICTION WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, BUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, WHO HAD BEEN 
APPOINTED TO THE DC CIRCUIT BY 
PRESIDENT BUSH, AND HAD WORKED 
IN PRESIDENT BUSH'S WHITE HOUSE,
RULED THAT THE CONVICTION WAS 
UNLAWFUL. 
AS HE EXPLAINED DURING THE 
HEARING, QUOTE, WE DON'T MAKE 
DECISIONS BASED ON WHO PEOPLE 
ARE OR THEIR POLICY PREFERENCES,
OR THE MOMENT, WE BASE 
DECISIONS ON THE LAW.
".>>> OTHERS I HAVE MET WITH 
HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT 
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT 
THREATENS THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX 
COUPLES TO MARRY. 
YET JUDGE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBE THE
DECISION, WHICH LEGALIZED SAME 
GENDER MARRIAGES, AS AN 
IMPORTANT LANDMARK PRECEDENT. 
HE ALSO CITED JUSTICE KENNEDY'S 
RECENT MASTERPIECE CAKE SHOP 
OPINION FOR THE COURT'S 
MAJORITY, STATING THAT, QUOTE, 
-- "THE DAYS OF TREATING GAY 
AMERICANS OR GAY LESBIAN 
COUPLES AS SECOND-CLASS 
CITIZENS WHO ARE INFERIOR IN 
DIGNITY AND WORTH ARE OVER IN 
THE SUPREME COURT." 
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE 
JUDGE HOLDS EXTREME VIEWS ON 
BIRTH CONTROL, IN ONE CASE, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH INCURRED THE 
DISFAVOR OF BOTH SIDES OF THE 
POLITICAL SPECTRUM FOR SEEKING 
TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES FOR 
WOMEN, WHILE MINIMIZING THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF EMPLOYERS WITH 
RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS. 
ALTHOUGH HIS CRITICS FREQUENTLY 
OVERLOOKED THIS POINT, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S DISSENT REJECTED 
ARGUMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
DID NOT HAVE A COMPELLING 
INTEREST IN FACILITATING ACCESS 
TO CONTRACEPTION. 
IN FACT, HE WROTE THAT THE 
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 
STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THERE 
WAS A COMPELLING INTEREST IN 
FACILITATING ACCESS TO BIRTH 
CONTROL.
>>> THERE HAS ALSO BEEN 
CONSIDERABLE FOCUS ON THE 
FUTURE OF ABORTION RIGHTS, 
BASED ON THE CONCERN THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WOULD SEEK TO OVERTURN
ROE VERSUS WADE, PROTECTING 
THIS RIGHT IS IMPORTANT TO ME. 
TO MY KNOWLEDGE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH
IS THE FIRST SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE TO EXPRESS THE VIEW THAT
PRECEDENT IS NOT MERELY A 
PRACTICE AND TRADITION, BUT 
ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3 OF OUR 
CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 
HE BELIEVES THAT PRECEDENT IS 
NOT JUST A JUDICIAL POLICY, IT 
IS CONSTITUTIONALLY DICTATED TO 
PAY ATTENTION AND PAY HEED TO 
RULES OF PRECEDENT. 
IN OTHER WORDS, PRECEDENT IS 
NOT A GOAL OR ASPIRATION, IT IS 
A CONSTITUTIONAL TENANT -- 10 
THAT -- TENET THAT HAS TO BE 
FOLLOWED EXCEPT IN THE MOST 
EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES. 
AND PRECEDENT SUPPLIES 
PREDICTABILITY, RELIANCE AND 
FAIRNESS. 
THERE ARE OF COURSE RARE AND 
EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WHERE THE 
SUPREME COURT WOULD RIGHTLY 
OVERTURN A PRECEDENT, THE MOST 
FAMOUS EXAMPLE WAS WHEN THE 
SUPREME COURT IN BROWN VERSUS 
THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OVERRULED
PLESSEY VS FERGUSON, CORRECTING 
A GRIEVOUSLY WRONG DECISION, TO 
USE THE JUDGE'S TERM, ALLOWING 
RACIAL INEQUALITY.
>>> BUT SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES 
THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PRECEDENT HAS BEEN ROOTED IN 
THE CONSTITUTION WOULD FOLLOW 
LONG-ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT, 
EXCEPT IN THOSE RARE 
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A DECISION 
IS PREVIOUSLY WRONG OR DEEPLY 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAW, 
THOSE ARE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
PHRASES. 
AS THE JUDGE ASSERTED TO ME, A 
LONG-ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IS 
NOT SOMETHING TO BE TRIMMED, 
NARROWED, DISCARDED, OR 
OVERLOOKED. 
ITS ROOTS IN THE CONSTITUTION 
GIVE THE CONCEPT OF STARE 
DECISIS, PRECLUDING ATTEMPTS TO 
DO BY STEALTH THAT WHICH ONE 
HAS COMMITTED NOT TO DO OVERLY. 
-- OVERTLY. 
NOTING THAT ROE VERSUS WADE WAS 
DECIDED 45 YEARS AGO, AND 
REAFFIRMED 19 YEARS LATER, IN 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS 
CASEY, I ASKED JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
WHETHER THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS 
RELEVANT TO FOLLOWING PRECEDENT.
E SAID DECISIONS BECOME PART 
OF OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF TIME, AND THAT 
HONORING PRECEDENT IS ESSENTIAL 
TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC 
CONFIDENCE. 
OUR DISCUSSION THEN TURNED TO 
THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY ON WHICH 
THE SUPREME COURT RELIED IN 
GRISWALD VS CONNECTICUT, A CASE 
THAT STRUCK DOWN A LAW BANNING 
THE USE OF CONTRACEPTION. 
IT ESTABLISHED THE LEGAL 
FOUNDATION THAT LED TO ROE 
VERSUS WADE EIGHT YEARS LATER. 
IN DESCRIBING GRISWOLD AS 
SETTLED LAW, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE 
CORRECT APPLICATION OF TWO 
FAMOUS CASES FROM THE 1920S. 
MEYER AND PIERCE, THAT ARE NOT 
SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED BY ANYONE 
TODAY.
>>> FINALLY, IN HIS TESTIMONY 
HE NOTED REPEATEDLY THAT ROE 
VERSUS WADE HAD BEEN UPHELD BY 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS 
CASEY, DESCRIBING IT AS 
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT. 
WHEN I ASKED HIM, WOULD IT BE 
SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN A LONG-
ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IF 5 
CURRENT JUSTICES BELIEVED THAT 
IT WAS WRONGLY DECIDED, HE 
EMPHATICALLY SAID NO.
>>> OPPONENTS FREQUENTLY CITE 
THEN CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP'S 
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE TO NOMINATE 
ONLY JUDGES WHO WOULD OVERTURN 
ROE VERSUS WADE. 
THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM FOR ALL 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS HAS 
INCLUDED THIS PLEDGE SINCE AT 
LEAST 1980. 
DURING THIS TIME, PRESIDENTS, 
REPUBLICAN, HAVE APPOINTED 
JUSTICES O'CONNOR, SUTER AND 
KENNEDY TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
THESE ARE THE VERY THREE 
JUSTICES, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT 
APPOINTED JUSTICES, WHO OFFERED 
-- AUTHORED THE KC DECISION 
WHICH REAFFIRMED ROE VERSUS 
WADE. 
AND THEY VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE THESE
NOMINATIONS, INCREDIBLY, THEY 
EVEN CIRCULATED BUTTONS WITH 
THE SLOGAN, STOP SUTER OR WOMEN 
WILL DIE. 
JUST TWO YEARS LATER, JUSTICE 
SUTER CO-AUTHORED THE KC 
DECISION REAFFIRMING A WOMAN'S 
RIGHT TO CHOOSE, SUFFICE IT TO 
SAY, PROMINENT ADVOCACY 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN WRONG.
>>> THE SAME INTEREST GROUPS 
HAVE SPECULATED THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WAS SELECTED TO DO 
THE BIDDING OF CONSERVATIVE 
IDEOLOGUES, DESPITE HIS RECORD 
OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE. 
I ASKED THE JUDGE POINT BLANK, 
WHETHER HE HAD MADE ANY 
COMMITMENTS, OR PLEDGES, TO 
ANYONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, TO 
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY, TO ANY 
OUTSIDE GROUP. 
ON HOW HE WOULD DECIDE CASES. 
HE UNEQUIVOCALLY ASSURED ME, 
THAT HE HAD NOT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS RECEIVED 
RAVE REVIEWS FOR HIS 12 YEAR 
>>> RECORD AS A JUDGE, INCLUDING
FOR HIS JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. 
THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
GAVE HIM ITS HIGHEST POSSIBLE 
RATING. 
IT'S STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE 
FEDERAL JUDICIARY CONDUCTED AN 
EXTRAORDINARY THOROUGH 
ASSESSMENT, SOLICITING INPUT 
FROM ALMOST 500 PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING HIS JUDICIAL 
COLLEAGUES. 
THE APA CONCLUDED THAT HIS 
INTEGRITY, JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT 
AND PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCE MET 
THE HIGH STANDARDS. 
LISA BLACK, WHO HAS ARGUED MORE 
CASES BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT 
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN, IN 
HISTORY, TESTIFIED QUOTE -- "BY 
ANY EFFECTIVE MEASURE, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS CLEARLY QUALIFIED 
TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
HIS OPINIONS ARE INVARIABLY 
THOUGHTFUL AND FAIR." 
SHE CLERKED FOR HIM AS AN ARDENT
ADMIRER OF GINSBERG, IS 
UNAPOLOGETICALLY A DEFENDER OF 
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, SAYS 
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH FITS 
WITHIN THE MAINSTREAM OF LEGAL 
THOUGHT. 
SHE ALSO OBSERVED THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS REMARKABLY 
COMMITTED TO PROMOTING WOMEN IN 
THE LEGAL PROFESSION. 
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS MORE OF 
A CENTRIST THAN SOME OF HIS 
CRITICS MAINTAIN IS REFLECTED 
IN THE FACT THAT HE AND CHIEF 
JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND VOTED THE 
SAME WAY IN 93% OF THE CASES 
THAT THEY HEARD TOGETHER. 
INDEED, CHIEF JUDGE GARLAND 
JOINED IN MORE THAN 96, 
PRESENTING THE MAJORITY 
OPINIONS PRESENTED BY JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, DISSENTING ONLY ONCE.
>>> DESPITE ALL THIS, AFTER 
WEEKS OF REVIEWING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S RECORD AND 
LISTENING TO 32 HOURS OF HIS 
TESTIMONY, THE SENATE'S ADVICE 
AND CONSENT ROLE WAS THROWN 
INTO A TAILSPIN FOLLOWING THE 
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
BY PROFESSOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD. 
THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS NOW 
INVOLVES EVALUATING WHETHER OR 
NOT JUDGE KAVANAUGH COMMITTED 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND LIED ABOUT IT
TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
SOME ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, TO OUR 
HIGHEST COURTS, THE REQUIREMENT 
IS TO RESOLVE AGAINST THE 
NOMINEE. 
OTHERS SEE THE PUBLIC INTEREST 
AS EMBODIED IN OUR LONG-
ESTABLISHED TRADITION OF 
AFFORDING TO THOSE ACCUSED OF 
MISCONDUCT A PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE. 
IN CASES IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE 
UNCLEAR, THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT 
THE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE 
RESOLVED IN FAVOR OF THE 
NOMINEE. 
MR. PRESIDENT, I UNDERSTAND 
BOTH VIEWPOINTS, THIS DEBATE IS 
COMPLICATED FURTHER BY THE FACT 
THAT THE SENATE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS IS NOT A TRIAL, BUT 
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL 
PRINCIPLES ABOUT DUE PROCESS, 
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, 
AND FAIRNESS, DO BEAR ON MY 
THINKING, AND I CANNOT ABANDON 
THEM. 
IN EVALUATING ANY GIVEN CLAIM 
OF MISCONDUCT, WE WILL BE EEL 
SERVED IN THE LONG RUN IF WE 
ABANDON THE PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE AND FAIRNESS, 
TEMPTING THOUGH IT MAY BE. 
WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IT 
IS WHEN PASSIONS ARE MOST 
INFLAMED, THAT FAIRNESS IS MOST 
IN JEOPARDY.
>>> THE PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE IS RELEVANT TO THE 
ADVICE AND CONSENT FUNCTION 
WHEN AN ACCUSATION DEPARTS FROM 
A NOMINEES OTHERWISE EXEMPLARY 
RECORD. 
I WORRY THAT DEPARTING FROM 
THIS PRESUMPTION COULD LEAD TO 
A LACK OF PUBLIC FAITH IN THE 
JUDICIARY, AND WOULD BE HUGELY 
DAMAGING TO THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. 
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS LEVIED 
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
ILLUSTRATE WHY THE PRESUMPTION 
OF INNOCENCE IS SO IMPORTANT. 
I AM THINKING IN PARTICULAR NOT 
AT THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY 
PROFESSOR FORD, BUT OF THE 
ALLEGATION THAT WHEN HE WAS A 
TEENAGER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
DRUGGED MULTIPLE GIRLS, AND 
USED THEIR WEEKEND ESTATE TO 
FACILITATE GANG RAPE. 
-- WEAKENED STATE TO FACILITATE 
GANG RAPE. 
THIS OUTLANDISH ASSERTION CAME 
WITHOUT EVIDENCE, AND SIMPLY 
PARROTED PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF 
OTHERS. 
THAT SUCH AN ALLEGATION CAN 
FIND ITS WAY INTO THE SUPREME 
COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS A 
STARK REMINDER ABOUT WHY THE 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS SO 
INGRAINED IN OUR AMERICAN 
CONSCIOUSNESS.
>>> ESTHER PRESIDENT, I 
LISTENED CAREFULLY TO CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY BEFORE 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
I FOUND HER TESTIMONY TO BE 
SINCERE, PAINFUL, AND 
COMPELLING. 
I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS A SURVIVOR
OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND THAT 
THIS TRAUMA HAS UPENDED HER 
LIFE. 
NEVERTHELESS, THE FOUR 
WITNESSES SHE NAMED COULD NOT 
CORROBORATE ANY OF THE EVENTS 
OF THAT EVENING GATHERING WHERE 
SHE SAYS THE ASSAULT OCCURRED. 
NONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS 
PROFESSOR FORD SAYS WERE AT THE 
PARTY HAS ANY RECOLLECTION AT 
ALL OF THAT NIGHT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FORCEFULLY 
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS UNDER 
PENALTY OF PERJURY. 
MARK JUDGE DENIED UNDER PENALTY 
OF FELONY THAT HE HAD WITNESSED 
AN ASSAULT. 
PJ SMITH, ANOTHER PERSON 
ALLEGEDLY AT THE PARTY, DENIED 
THAT HE WAS THERE. 
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY. 
PROFESSOR FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND
, LELAND KAISER, INDICATED THAT 
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, SHE 
DOES NOT REMEMBER THAT PARTY. 
AND SHE WENT FURTHER, SHE 
INDICATED THAT NOT ONLY DOES 
SHE NOT REMEMBER A NIGHT LIKE 
THAT, BUT ALSO THAT SHE DOES 
NOT EVEN KNOW BRETT KAVANAUGH.
>>> IN ADDITION TO THE LACK OF 
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, WE ALSO 
LEARNED SOME FACTS THAT RAISE 
MORE QUESTIONS, FOR INSTANCE, 
SINCE THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE 
BECOME PUBLIC, PROFESSOR FORD 
TESTIFIED THAT NOT A SINGLE 
PERSON HAS CONTACTED HER TO SAY 
I WAS AT THE PARTY THAT NIGHT. 
FURTHERMORE, THE PROFESSOR 
TESTIFIED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE 
DOES NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT 
HOME THAT EVENING, SHE KNEW THAT
BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE, SHE 
WOULD HAVE NEEDED A RIDE, YET 
NOT A SINGLE PERSON HAS COME 
FORWARD TO SAY THAT THEY WERE 
THE ONE WHO DROVE HER HOME, OR 
WERE IN THE CAR WITH HER THAT 
NIGHT. 
AND PROFESSOR FORD ALSO 
INDICATED THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE 
LEFT THAT SMALL GATHERING OF 
SIX OR SO PEOPLE ABRUPTLY AND 
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE, AND 
DISTRAUGHT, NONE OF THEM CALLED 
HER THE NEXT DAY, OR EVER, TO 
ASK WHY SHE LEFT, IS SHE OKAY. 
NOT EVEN HER CLOSEST FRIEND, 
MS. KAISER. 
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE 
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT PROVIDE 
GUIDANCE ON HOW WE ARE SUPPOSED 
TO EVALUATE THESE COMPETING 
CLAIMS, IT LEAVES THAT DECISION 
UP TO EACH SENATOR. THIS IS NOT 
A CRIMINAL TRIAL, AND I DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT THE CRIMINAL TRIAL
, AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE 
CLAIMS NEED TO BE PROVED BEYOND 
A REASONABLE DOUBT, 
NEVERTHELESS, FAIRNESS WOULD 
DICTATE THAT THE CLAIMS AT 
LEAST SHOULD MEET A THRESHOLD 
OF MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. 
AS OUR STANDARD. 
THE FACTS PRESENTED DO NOT MEAN 
THAT PROFESSOR FORD WAS NOT 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THAT NIGHT, 
OR AT SOME OTHER TIME. 
BUT THEY DO LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE 
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS FAILED TO 
MEET THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT 
STANDARD. THEREFORE, I DO NOT 
BELIEVE THAT THESE CHARGES CAN 
FAIRLY PREVENT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
FROM SERVING ON THE COURT.
>>> LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT MY 
APPROACH TO THIS QUESTION 
SHOULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED AS 
SUGGESTING THAT UNWANTED SEXUAL 
CONTACT OF ANY NATURE IS NOT A 
SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.
TO THE CONTRARY, IF ANY GOOD AT 
ALL HAS COME FROM THIS UGLY 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, IT HAS 
BEEN TO CREATE AN AWARENESS 
THAT WE HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE 
PERVASIVENESS OF THIS TERRIBLE 
PROBLEM. 
I HAVE BEEN ALARMED AND 
DISTURBED, HOWEVER, BY SOME WHO 
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT UNLESS 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION IS 
REJECTED, THE SENATE IS SOMEHOW 
CONDONING SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 
THE TRUTH. 
EVERY PERSON, MAN OR WOMAN, WHO 
MAKES A CHARGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
DESERVES TO BE HEARD AND 
TREATED WITH RESPECT. 
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IS REAL. 
IT MATTERS. 
IT IS NEEDED, AND IT IS LONG 
OVERDUE. 
WE KNOW THAT RAPE AND SEXUAL 
ASSAULT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE 
REPORTED TO THE POLICE, AN 
ESTIMATED 211,000 RAPES AND 
SEXUAL ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED 
EVERY YEAR. 
WE MUST LISTEN TO SURVIVORS, 
AND EVERY DAY WE MUST SEEK TO 
STOP THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT 
HAS HURT SO MANY. 
WE OWE THIS TO OURSELVES, OUR 
CHILDREN, AND GENERATIONS TO 
COME.
>>> SINCE THE HEARING, I HAVE 
LISTENED TO MANY SURVIVORS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
MANY WERE TOTAL STRANGERS, WHO 
TOLD ME THEIR HEART WRENCHING 
STORIES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
SOME WERE FRIENDS THAT I HAVE 
KNOWN, AND I HAD NO IDEA, THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ATTACKS. 
I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR COURAGE,
AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO COME 
FORWARD, AND I HOPE THAT IN 
HEIGHTENING PUBLIC AWARENESS, 
THEY HAVE ALSO LIGHTENED THE 
BURDEN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
QUIETLY BEARING FOR SO MANY 
YEARS. 
TO THEM, I PLEDGE TO DO ALL 
THAT I CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEIR 
DAUGHTERS, AND GRANDDAUGHTERS, 
NEVER SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES.
>>> OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I 
HAVE BEEN EMPHATIC THAT THE 
SENATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO 
INVESTIGATE AND EVALUATE THE 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, I CALLED FOR AND 
SUPPORTED THE ADDITIONAL 
HEARING TO HEAR FROM BOTH 
PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. I ALSO PUSHED 
FORWARD AND SUPPORTED THE FBI'S 
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION. 
THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD NEVER 
SOUGHT THE SPOTLIGHT, SHE 
INDICATED THAT SHE WAS 
TERRIFIED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 
SHE HAS SHUNNED ATTENTION SINCE 
THEN. 
SHE SEEMED UNAWARE OF CHAIRMAN 
GRASSLEY'S OFFER TO ALLOW HER 
TO TESTIFY CONFIDENTIALITY -- 
CONFIDENTIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. 
WATCHING HER, MR. PRESIDENT, I 
COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL THAT 
SOME PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO 
ENGINEER THE DEFEAT OF THIS 
NOMINATION CARED LITTLE, IF AT 
ALL, ABOUT HER WELL-BEING. 
PROFESSOR FORD TESTIFIED THAT A 
VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE 
HAD ACCESS TO HER LETTER. 
YET THAT LETTER FOUND ITS WAY 
INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. 
SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE NEVER 
GAVE PERMISSION FOR THAT VERY 
PRIVATE LETTER, TO BE RELEASED. 
AND YET, HERE WE ARE. 
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT 
THAT SHE NEVER SOUGHT, ARGUING 
ABOUT CLAIMS THAT SHE WANTED TO 
RAISE CONFIDENTIALLY. 
NOW ONE THEORY I HAVE HEARD 
ESPOUSED REPEATEDLY IS THAT OUR 
COLLEAGUE, SENATOR DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN, LEAKED PROFESSOR 
FORD'S LETTER AT THE 11th HOUR 
TO DERAIL THIS PROCESS. 
I WANT TO STATE THIS VERY 
CLEARLY, I KNOW SENATOR DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN EXTREMELY WELL. 
AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD 
NEVER DO THAT. 
I KNEW THAT TO BE THE CASE 
BEFORE SHE EVEN STATED IT AT 
THE HEARING, A PERSON OF 
INTEGRITY, AND I STAND BY HER. 
I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME ARGUE 
THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COMMITTEE SOMEHOW TREATED 
PROFESSOR FORD UNFAIRLY. 
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 
THE TRUTH. 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, ALONG WITH 
HIS EXCELLENT STAFF, TREATED 
PROFESSOR FORD WITH COMPASSION 
AND RESPECT THROUGHOUT THE 
ENTIRE PROCESS. 
AND THAT IS THE WAY THE SENATOR 
FROM IOWA HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF 
THROUGHOUT A LIFETIME DEDICATED 
TO PUBLIC SERVICE.
>>> BUT THE FACT REMAINS, MR. 
PRESIDENT, SOMEONE LEAKED THIS 
LETTER AGAINST PROFESSOR FORD'S 
EXPRESSED WISHES. 
I SUSPECT, REGRETTABLY, THAT WE 
WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHO 
DID IT. 
TO THAT LEAKER, WHO I HOPE IS 
LISTENING NOW, LET ME SAY THAT 
WHAT YOU DID WAS UNCONSCIONABLE.
YOU HAVE TAKEN A SURVIVOR, WHO 
WAS NOT ONLY ENTITLED TO YOUR 
RESPECT, BUT WHO ALSO TRUSTED 
YOU TO PROTECT HER, AND YOU 
HAVE SACRIFICED HER WELL-BEING 
IN A MISGUIDED ATTEMPT TO WIN 
WHATEVER POLITICAL CRUSADE YOU 
THINK YOU ARE FIGHTING. 
MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT YOUR 
CALLOUS ACT HAS TURNED THIS 
PROCESS INTO SUCH A 
DYSFUNCTIONAL CIRCUS THAT IT 
WILL CAUSE THE SENATE, AND 
INDEED ALL AMERICANS, TO 
RECONSIDER HOW WE EVALUATE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 
IF THAT HAPPENS, THEN THE 
APPALLING LACK OF COMPASSION 
YOU AFFORDED PROFESSOR FORD, 
WILL AT LEAST HAVE SOME 
UNINTENDED POSITIVE 
CONSEQUENCES.
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE 
POLITICALLY CHARGED ATMOSPHERE 
SURROUNDING THIS NOMINATION HAS 
REACHED THE FEVER PITCH EVEN 
BEFORE THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 
KNOWN, AND IT HAS BEEN 
CHALLENGING, EVEN THEN, TWO 
SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION. 
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF SUCH GREAT 
DISUNITY, AS THE BITTER FIGHT 
OVER THIS NOMINATION, BOTH IN 
THE SENATE AND AMONG THE PUBLIC
, CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES. 
IT IS NOT MERELY A CASE OF 
DIFFERING GROUPS HAVING 
DIFFERENT OPINIONS, IT IS A 
CASE OF PEOPLE BEARING EXTREME 
ILL WILL TOWARD THOSE WHO 
DISAGREE WITH THEM. 
IN OUR INTENSE FOCUS ON OUR 
DIFFERENCES, WE HAVE FORGOTTEN 
THE COMMON VALUES THAT BIND US 
TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. 
WHEN SOME OF OUR BEST MINDS, 
ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP EVEN 
MORE SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHMS 
DESIGNED TO LINK US TO WEBSITES 
THAT ONLY REINFORCE AND CATER 
TO OUR VIEWS, WE CAN ONLY EXPECT
OUR DIFFERENCES TO INTENSIFY.
>>> THIS WOULD HAVE ALARMED THE 
DRAFTERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION, 
WHO WERE ACUTELY AWARE THAT 
IFFERENT VALUES AND INTERESTS, 
COULD PREVENT AMERICANS FROM 
BECOMING AN REMAINING -- AND 
REMAINING THE PEOPLE, THE SIX 
OBJECTIVES IN THE PREAMBLE TO 
THE CONSTITUTION, THE ONE THAT 
THEY PUT FIRST, WAS THE 
FORMATION OF A MORE PERFECT 
UNION. 
THEIR VISION OF A MORE PERFECT 
UNION DOES NOT EXIST TODAY. 
AND IF ANYTHING, WE APPEAR TO 
BE MOVING FARTHER AWAY FROM 
THAT. 
IT IS PARTICULARLY WORRISOME 
THAT THE SUPREME COURT, THE 
INSTITUTION THAT MOST AMERICANS 
SEE AS THE PRINCIPAL GUARDIAN 
OF OUR SHARED CONSTITUTIONAL 
HERITAGE, IS VIEWED AS PART OF 
THE PROBLEM THROUGH A POLITICAL 
LENS. 
MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE HEARD A 
LOT OF CHARGES AND COUNTER 
CHARGES ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
BUT AS THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM 
BEST HAVE ATTESTED, HE HAS BEEN 
AN EXEMPLARY PUBLIC SERVANT, 
JUDGE, TEACHER, COACH, HUSBAND, 
AND FATHER. 
DESPITE THE TURBULENT, BITTER 
FIGHTS SURROUNDING HIS 
NOMINATION, MY FERVENT HOPE IS 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH WILL WORK 
TO LESSEN THE DIVISIONS IN THE 
SUPREME COURT, SO THAT WE HAVE 
FAR FEWER 5-4 DECISIONS, AND SO 
THAT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR 
JUDICIARY AND OUR HIGHEST COURT 
IS RESTORED. 
MR. PRESIDENT, I WILL VOTE TO 
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> 
>> MR. PRESIDENT. 
IS TENNESSEE.
>>> 22 YEARS IN THE U.S. SENATE,
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS ANNOUNCES 
SHE WILL VOTE YES ON BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION, MAKING 
IT VERY LIKELY THAT HE WILL 
MAKE IT TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
I WANT TO BRING IN MOLLY HOOPER,
OUR CBSN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR, 
AND WILL CONTRIBUTE FOR THE 
HILL, SHE SAID SHE LOOKED AT 
HIS 12 YEAR RECORD, AND THE 
SENATE PROCESS IS NOT A TRIAL, 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT SHE HAD 
TO SAY, AND WHAT WAS ALMOST AN 
HOUR LAST>> -- HOUR-LONG 
SPEECH? 
>> IS A FILIBUSTER, SO TO SPEAK 
UP SHE LAID OUT HER ARGUMENTS 
IN FAVOR OF KAVANAUGH IN THE 
LEAD UP TO DISCUSSION, BEFORE 
SHE GOT TO THE TAILSPIN OF THE 
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS, 
GOING THROUGH THE CASES THAT 
DEMOCRATS IN PARTICULAR, AND 
OPPONENTS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
POINTED TO AS POSSIBLY 
APPOINTING SOMEBODY TO THE BENCH
WHO WOULD OVERTURN KEY ISSUES 
LIKE ROE VERSUS WADE, SHE WENT 
THROUGH A WHOLE LITANY OF CASES 
THAT IS DECIDED ON, IN WHICH HE 
ESSENTIALLY UPHELD THOSE ITEMS, 
TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF 
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY, AND 
WHAT SOME DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING 
THE IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY, WITH 
DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE COULD BE 
INDICTED, A SITTING PRESIDENT 
DOESN'T HAVE TO RESPOND TO 
SUBPOENA REQUESTS FOR 
INTERVIEWS, SUSAN COLLINS 
LISTED CASES IN JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S BACKGROUND, IN HIS 
12 YEARS AS A JUDGE ON THE DC 
APPELLATE COURT, WHERE THEY 
DIFFERING OPINIONS THAT. 
AND SHE GOT TO THE ALLEGATIONS 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, IT IS ONE OF 
THOSE THINGS WHERE SHE -- I WAS 
TALKING TO FOR THE FDI VISION, 
HIS OWN INVESTIGATION, SHE WAS 
SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATS, THE 
OPPONENTS OF KAVANAUGH, HAVE 
OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND, ON 
TUESDAY, THE MOMENTUM IS AT THE 
BACK OF KAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION, BECAUSE PROTESTER 
TACTICS, GOING AFTER SENATORS 
AND QUESTIONING THEM WITHOUT 
ALLOWING THE SENATORS TO 
RESPOND, THAT TURNS SENATORS 
OFF, IN ADDITION TO WHICH, YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT SUSAN COLLINS DID 
SAY ABOUT THE LACK OF 
CORROBORATION SHE SAID, ON THE 
PART OF NAMED INDIVIDUALS, WHO 
WOULD HAVE THERE AT THE PARTY, 
THAT DOCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD MENTIONED WOULD HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE, THERE WAS NO 
CORROBORATION, AND SUSAN 
COLLINS SAID IT'S NOT A COURT, 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING OF THIS 
COUNTRY, WE ARE ABOUT FAIRNESS, 
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BACK 
SOMETHING UP, AND BASED ON HER 
VERY THOROUGH CASE WHY SHE WAS 
VOTING THIS WAY. 
BUT AGAIN, SHE DID AND HER 
REMARKS, THREE QUARTERS OF THE 
WAY THROUGH, THE ONE GOOD THING 
THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS, 
THESE ALLEGATIONS, THE NUMBER 
OF WOMEN WHO FELT EMPOWERED 
FORWARD AND SAY THIS HAS 
HAPPENED TO ME AS WELL, AND TO 
TELL THEIR TALE HAVE NOT BEEN 
THAT TO THIS POINT, AND 
COLLINS, SHE MADE A COMMITMENT 
TO DO WHATEVER SHE CAN TO HELP 
MAKE THE FUTURE SAFE FOR YOUNG 
WOMEN. 
SO THAT THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
WILL TAKE PLACE. 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT UP 
HERE ON CAPITOL HILL WILL 
HOLDER TO. 
>> SHE IS UP FOR REELECTION IN 
2020, I AM SEEING PEOPLE IN THE 
LEFT CALLING FOR SOMEONE STRONG 
TO REPLACE OR. 
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE 
MOMENT AT HAND, CAN YOU WALK US 
THROUGH THE MATH RIGHT NOW? 
IS IT CERTAIN THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WILL MAKE IT THROUGH, 
OR ARE WE STILL WAITING ON 
OTHER PEOPLE?>> IT IS LOOKING 
PRETTY GOOD FOR HIM, SHE WAS 
THAT KEY VOTE, 51 REPUBLICANS, 
49 DEMOCRATS, OR 47 DEMOCRATS OR
-- AND 2 INDEPENDENTS WHO OFTEN 
SIDE WITH THEM, SHE VOTED FOR --
MURKOWSKI VOTED AGAINST 
CLOTURE, THEY FIGURE IT IS 50-
50, JEFF FLAKE SAYING HE WILL 
VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH, BARRING 
ANYTHING IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS, 
THAT PUTS THE VOTE AT 50-50, AND
MIKE PENCE IS ON HAND TO BREAK 
A TIE. 
AT THIS POINT, IT LOOKS LIKE 
KAVANAUGH HAS THE VOTES, THE 
CAVEAT FROM FLAKE, WE STILL 
DON'T KNOW WHAT JOE MANCHIN IS 
GOING TO DO, HE COULD VOTE FOR 
IT,  AND EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE 
SEVERAL DEMOCRATS LIKE HEIDKAMP,
DONNELLY, AND OTHER DEMOCRATS 
IN SO-CALLED RED STATES THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY DOUBLE 
DIGITS, THEY VOTED AGAINST 
CLOTURE, BUT THEY STILL HAVE A 
CHANCE TO VOTE ON CONFIRMATION, 
IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THEY WILL 
VOTE.
>> WAITING TO HEAR FROM SENATOR 
JOE MANCHIN, WE ARE EXPECTING 
HIM TO SPEAK POSSIBLY ANYTIME.  
WE ARE HEARING REPORTS THAT HE 
IS EXPECTED TO VOTE YES, CBS 
NEWS HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT, IF 
THAT IS TRUE, WHAT YOU MAKE OF 
THAT?>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT, 
ALL SIGNS POINTED TO HIM VOTING 
FORWARD, AND THE FACT THAT HE 
CROSSED THE LINE, ACCORDING TO 
HIS DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, 
CROSSING THE ISLAND VOTING FOR 
CLOTURE, THAT'S A BIG DEAL.>> 
CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT 
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN WILL VOTE 
YES ON  JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
>> OKAY, I ACTUALLY KIND OF 
FIGURED THAT IS WHERE HE WAS 
GOING, AGAIN, THESE MEMBERS 
HAVE TO GET REELECTED, UP FOR 
REELECTION IN A STATE THAT 
VOTED HEAVILY FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, AND JOE MANCHIN, IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE ISSUES , THE 
ARGUMENTS THAT SUSAN COLLINS 
LAID OUT, COMPREHENSIVELY, FOR 
THE PAST 45 MINUTES, THOSE 
COULD ALSO APPLY TO JOE 
MANCHIN'S -- JOE MANCHIN'S 
ARGUMENTS. 
>> DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 
DELIBERATION? 
HOW CLOSELY, MURKOWSKI, MEANT --
JOE MANCHIN, WERE THEY EXPECTED 
TO VOTE SIMILARLY?>> HERE IS 
KIND OF WAS INTERESTING, 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE HEARING, 
ALL MEETING TO HAVE A confab -- 
CONFAB, BEFORE THE SENATE 
REPUBLICANS HELD THEIR LARGER 
ONE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE 
EVERYBODY WAS. 
THE NEXT DAY, THAT IS WHEN JEFF 
FLAKE MADE THIS BIPARTISAN 
MOVED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF 
MOVING THE CONFIRMATION TO THE 
SENATE FLOOR WITH A FAVORITE 
RECOMMENDATION. 
CALLING THE FBI SUPPLEMENTAL, 
BASED ON WHAT HE SAID SINCE 
THEN, AND WHAT SUSAN COLLINS 
WAS SAYING, THEY WANTED THAT 
GROUP IN PARTICULAR, THEY 
WANTED AN ADDITIONAL FBI 
INVESTIGATION, AT LEAST HAVE 
THEM TALK TO THE KEY 
INDIVIDUALS MENTIONED BY 
PROFESSOR FORD, MARCH JUDGE, PJ 
SMITH, AND LELAND KAISER, HAVE A
CONVERSATION WITH THE FBI, FIND 
OUT WHAT WAS SAID AND MOVE FROM 
THERE. 
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER TALKING 
AT THIS POINT, BUT AFTER THE 
VOTE, IT IS EASIER TO TELL.
>>> WE HAVE SENATOR JOE 
MANCHIN. 
>>> WE WANTED TO  
>> GREAT CONCERN FOR THE PEOPLE 
HERE? 
>> SURE. 
I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE 
SEXUAL ABUSE THAT PEOPLE HAD TO 
ENDURE, AND VERY MUCH CONCERNED 
THAT WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING AS 
A COUNTRY. 
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO BE 
THE -- VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH?
>> I JUST, YOU KNOW, I NEVER 
THOUGHT OF IT BASED ON 50-50, 
50-52, WHATEVER IT WAS. 
IF I'D HAVE BEEN IN THAT 
POSITION, I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 
SEE THE PROCEDURE. 
>> BUT, WHY DID YOU WAIT FOR 
COLLINS TO MAKE HER 
ANNOUNCEMENT BEFORE YOU MADE 
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT? 
>> I THINK THAT WAS BASICALLY 
WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY. 
>> BUT DID YOU -- DECIDE TO GO 
THAT WAY? 
>> OH, NO. 
I THINK EVERYONE LABORED WITH 
IT. 
I THINK EVERYBODY LABORED WITH 
IT. 
AND, WE HAD BEEN -- ALL MORNING 
LONG. 
EVERYTHING. 
>> HOW DOES SENATOR MURKOWSKI 
VOTING  CHANGE YOUR DECISIO? 
>> SENATOR MURKOWSKI  IS A 
VERY, VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. 
VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. 
AND, SHE DID EVERYTHING, 
CROSSED A VERY -- CROSSED EVERY 
"T," DOTTED EVERY "I." 
ALL OF US WENT THROUGH THE SAME 
PROCESS AND CAME TO DIFFERENT 
CONCLUSIONS. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE DR. FORD? 
>> I BELIEVE DR. FORD. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED. 
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FACTS 
SHOW THAT IT WAS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, BUT I BELIEVE 
SOMETHING HAPPENED. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE SOMEBODY ELSE 
DID IT? 
>> I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED 
TO HER. 
>> WHAT YOU SAY TO WOMEN WHO 
WATCH THIS PROCESS UNFOLD? 
HEARD DR. FORD'S STORY? 
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE STEPPED 
FORWARD? 
AND THAT, THE SENATE IS 
ESSENTIALLY -- 
>> I'VE HAD PEOPLE ALL OVER 
WEST VIRGINIA COME FORWARD. 
JUST BASICALLY, THE HURT THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE, THE TRAUMA THEY 
HAVE GONE THROUGH. 
AND, I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE HEARD. 
>> IS THIS AN ADEQUATE FBI 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> I CAN ONLY HAVE WHAT'S IN 
FRONT OF ME. 
THAT'S ALL I HAVE IN FRONT OF 
ME. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT -- FOR 
THE FBI? 
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT? 
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THERE 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE 
WITNESSES? 
>> I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS MORE 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. 
I LOOKED AT WHAT WAS IN FRONT 
OF ME AND I HAD TO MAKE THE 
DECISION. 
>> BASED ON THAT, WAS IT AN 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> FROM WHAT I SAW, THE PEOPLE 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT 
THEY SAID WHAT THEY SAID. 
>> DO YOU THINK THERE IS STILL 
PLACE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
AFTER THIS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M JUST A GOOD OLD WEST 
VIRGINIAN. 
>> BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
DEBATES -- 
>> I DID NOT LOOK AT THIS FROM 
A POLITICAL STANDPOINT. 
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED WITH 
KAVANAUGH'S TEMPERAMENT AT ALL? 
I KNOW SOME ARE CONCERNED. 
>> THURSDAY BOTHERED ME. 
THURSDAY BOTHERED ME A LOT. 
BUT, I SAW BASICALLY A 
DIFFERENT SIDE. 
>> 
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, EXPLAINING 
WHY HE CHOSE TO CROSS PARTY 
LINES, AND WILL BE VOTING "YES" 
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE SAID, WHEN ASKED IF YOU 
BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD 
VOTE FOR HIM,  HE SAID, I'M 
JUST A WEST VIRGINIAN. 
MOLLY, I'M SURE YOU COULD HEAR 
THAT, IT WAS HARD TO HEAR 
MANCHIN BECAUSE YOU COULD HEAR 
PROTESTERS  SAYING "SHAME, 
SHAME, SHAME," COMPLETELY 
OVERPOWERING MOST OF WHAT WE 
COULD HEAR. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CAPITAL 
REPORTER FOR "THE HILL," MOLLY 
HOOPER. 
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE COULD 
HEAR FROM SENATOR MANCHIN? 
>> A FEW THINGS WERE GOING ON 
HERE. 
NUMBER ONE,  HEARING THOSE 
PROTESTERS IN THE BACKGROUND, 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SENATORS 
HAVE BEEN FACING FOR THE PAST 
TWO WEEKS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN 
FACING A DAILY. 
IN FACT, I'VE COVERED CAPITOL 
HILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. 
AS YOU KNOW. 
AND, I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT QUITE 
SO -- THE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF 
THE PROTESTERS, REALLY GETTING 
IN THE FACE OF SENATORS AND 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, TO THE 
POINT WHERE CAPITOL POLICE ARE 
AROUND ON HAND SO THAT A 
SENATOR CAN SAY, YES, THIS 
PERSON IS IMPEDING THE ABILITY 
FOR ME TO DO MY JOB. 
THAT'S ONE THING. 
NUMBER TWO, TALKING TO OTHER 
SENATORS, SOMEBODY ASKED HIM, 
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THE 
SURVIVORS? 
TO WHICH JOE MANCHIN 
ESSENTIALLY SAID, I'VE HEARD A 
LOT OF HEARTFELT STORIES BUT 
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT 
THIS IS ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T 
HAVE THE CORROBORATING -- IN 
FACT, HE SAID THAT. 
THERE IS AN CORROBORATING 
EVIDENCE THAT WHAT DR. FORD IS 
ALLEGING HAPPENED TO HER BY 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY DID IN 
FACT HAPPEN. 
THAT FACTORS INTO THE DECISION 
THAT THESE MEMBERS ARE GOING TO 
BE MAKING. 
AND NUMBER THREE, EARLIER 
TODAY, WHEN SENATOR MANCHIN 
CROSSED PARTY LINES AND VOTED 
FOR THAT PROCEDURAL VOTE  TO 
CLOTURE, TO END DEBATE, THAT'S 
A BIG DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO 
CAPITOL HILL. 
USUALLY, THOSE VOTES ARE 
PARTYLINE VOTES BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PROCEDURAL  AND YOU WANT TO 
STICK WITH YOUR PARTY. 
ESSENTIALLY, HIS VOTE WAS TO 
GIVE CONTROL OF THE FLOOR BACK 
TO THE REPUBLICANS AND TO LET 
THAT MOVE FORWARD. 
THAT WAS A BIG MOVE EARLIER 
TODAY AND SORT OF PROJECTED HOW 
HE WOULD VOTE FOR THE FINAL 
CONFIRMATION. 
BUT AGAIN, THIS HAS JUST BEEN A 
VERY TOUGH ISSUE, AS SUSAN 
COLLINS WAS SAYING, IN THAT, 
YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE UP HERE ON 
CAPITOL HILL, AS BOB CORKER WAS 
SAYING TO ME, PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
TAKEN THE DAY OFF OF THEIR JOBS 
COME UP BECAUSE THIS ISSUE, 
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THEIR 
PAST. 
THIS ISSUE HAS DREDGED IT ALL 
UP AGAIN AND THEY HAD TO COME 
UP AND TALK TO A SENATOR AND 
TELL THEM WHY THEY OPPOSE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 
BUT AGAIN HE ALSO SAID SOME OF 
THESE OF THE PROTESTERS UP HERE 
WHO ARE JUST GETTING IN YOUR 
FACE AND PREVENTING US FROM 
DOING OUR JOB, THAT'S NOT WHAT 
THIS IS. 
AND SO, I THINK THAT'S 
PARTIALLY IN THE BACK OF SOME 
OF THESE SENATORS MINDS. 
BUT, MORE SO, THEY HAVE TO 
REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS. 
>> MOLLY, WE ARE GETTING SOME 
REACTION FROM CAPITOL HILL, 
FROM FELLOW REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
INCLUDING SENATOR CORNYN WHO 
SAYS I'M PROUD OF SENATOR 
COLLINS FOR RESISTING THE 
INTIMIDATION. 
FOLKS ON THE RIGHT REALLY 
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS AN  
INNOCENT MAN, A MAN WHO HAD 
GREAT JUDICIA REVIEW, SOMEONE 
WHO HAD JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT, 
WHO HAD WORKED HARD TO GET TO 
THIS LEVEL. 
AND, NOT EVERYONE BELIEVED DR. 
FORD'S TESTIMONY. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
EVEN THOUGH SUSAN COLLINS HAS 
SAYS THAT SHE BELIEVES IN THE 
ME TOO MOVEMENT AND CASTING 
THIS VOTE  DOES NOT MEAN SHE IS 
AGAINST THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. 
IT'S REALLY HARD, AS YOU'RE 
WATCHING REACTION ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA RIGHT NOW, SEEING WOMEN 
SAY, IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED IN 
 
NOT HOW YOU WOULD CAST YOUR 
VOTE. 
>> Reporter: WELL AGAIN, YOU 
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THOSE 
SENATORS. 
I GO BACK TO BOB CORKER, 
BECAUSE HE IS REALLY A MIDDLE-
OF-THE-ROAD GUY. 
HE SAID HE HAS SPOKEN OUT MORE 
TIMES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP 
THAN SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE. 
BUT AGAIN, WHEN IT COMES DOWN 
TO THIS ISSUE, AND AGAIN, HE 
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 
REPUBLICANS TO CALL FOR,  YOU 
KNOW, A DELAY IN KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION IN ORDER TO HAVE A 
HEARING TO HEAR FROM DR. FORD,  
OR A PRIVATE MEETING, WHATEVER 
IT WAS. 
BUT, TO HAVE DR. FORD TELL HER 
STORY TO THE SENATORS AND THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO WOULD 
BE VOTING AND ULTIMATELY TO THE 
SENATE AS A BODY WHO WOULD BE 
VOTING. 
HE SAID, THERE ARE THESE 
INTIMIDATION TACTICS GOING ON 
HERE. 
AND, REALLY DIFFERENTIATED 
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, THE 
PROTESTERS WHO ARE UP HERE 
EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR 
FACE, AND EXPOSING PEOPLE'S 
HOME ADDRESSES AND WHATNOT. 
AND, THOSE PEOPLE WHO COME UP 
AND ARE TALKING ONE-ON-ONE WITH 
SENATORS AND SAYING, PLEASE, 
THIS IS WHY I OPPOSE HIM. 
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH, YOU DO 
HEAR FROM SENATORS LIKE SUSAN 
COLLINS, LIKE BOB CORKER, WHO 
SAY THERE ISN'T CORROBORATING 
EVIDENCE THAT THIS HAPPENED. 
AND IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE 
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL COURT. 
BUT, IN DENYING SOMEBODY A JOB 
BASED ON ALLEGATIONS FROM 40 
YEARS AGO THAT CAN'T BE 
CORROBORATED, IT SETS A 
DIFFICULT PRECEDENT FOR 
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD WANT TO 
COME FORWARD AND BE NOMINEES IN 
THE FUTURE. 
WHY PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THAT 
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S 
GOING TO COME AT YOU? 
TRUE OR NOT. 
AND AGAIN, IT'S UNCLEAR IF 
THESE ARE TRUE OR NOT. 
AT THIS POINT, I THINK THAT'S 
WHAT I'M HEARING SENATORS SAY. 
YOU WILL HEAR VARYING DEGREES 
OF THAT. 
BUT FOR FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE 
LIKE SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 
MURKOWSKI TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, 
LIKE JOE MANCHIN, IT'S REALLY 
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 
AND, THE WAY THAT CERTAIN 
DEMOCRATS HANDLED THE HEARING 
AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS. 
>> MOLLY HOOPER, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR BREAKING THIS DOWN AND 
JOINING US IN THIS VERY BIG 
MOMENT.
