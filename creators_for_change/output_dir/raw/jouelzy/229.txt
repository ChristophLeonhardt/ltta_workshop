try something new<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my channel but</font>

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,490
pretty basic for any youtuber who

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,759
considers himself a beauty girl even

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,950
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't consider myself a beauty</font>

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,490
guru whatever I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> since um this is</font>

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,699

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,410
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should get this up in the first</font>

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,719
week but Graham jigging organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,390

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,289
to walk on my go complain about what god

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,589
bless me with but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also hate shoe</font>

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,250
shopping and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I find JustFab shoes</font>

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,500
because I tend to wear my shoes into the

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,659
ground and for the most part they stay

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,010
in are cute and they're stylish it's

28
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">just always hard to find Q affordable</font>

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,240
shoes in the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 or either always</font>

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,830
sold out and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I do want to</font>

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,210
spend more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money like there was a pair</font>

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,580
of Jimmy Choos and I want it and I was

33
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,350
going to pay the seven or not get them

34
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,460
they didn't come on my shoes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,439
these heels that I love from just do I

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,650
have the right on the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is</font>

37
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right way these just fab heels</font>

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,520
they're cute they're not that

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,799
comfortable because they have a pointy

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,020
heel the trick with JustFab is to stay

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,899
get shoes that have under a four-inch

42
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,390
heel anything over<font color="#E5E5E5"> four inch and JustFab</font>

43
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,640
shoes is hella uncomfortable they just

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,119
don't the bend the curve in the foot in

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,430

black community from small business

95
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,310
owners is that we don't pay attention to

96
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,470
our branding and packaging less is more

97
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,660
girls even while guarding colors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow</font>

98
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">fons like real simple just gorgeous</font>

99
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">packaging it has a wrapper around it</font>

100
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,300
then the box every bit of this packaging

101
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,770
is labeled branded with the name of the

102
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,600
company on it then you open it up and

103
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,190
you know they have the fold-out envelope

104
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,220
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the necklace was actually done</font>

105
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,780
to this but each piece of it says elk

106
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,020
