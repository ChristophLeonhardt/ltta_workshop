1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,440
What does Heath Ledger terrorizing Gotham,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,600
Daniel Day-Lewis ill-advisedly bragging,

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,600
"I've abandoned my child."

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,060
and Leonardo DiCaprio getting mauled by
bear,

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,880
all have in common? They each used

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,820
method acting to prepare for their role.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,540
Heath Ledger isolated himself for weeks

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,760
to portray the Joker's chilling
psychosis.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,109
Daniel Day-Lewis spent months

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:21,120
in character before filming even began.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,220
If I say I'm an oil man, you will agree.

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,840
And Leonardo DiCaprio really went into the
woods and got mauled by a bear.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,780
He ate raw bison liver instead.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,600
Each of these performances received an Oscar but

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,870
unless we're actually told about the
extreme lengths these actors went to,

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,380
there's no way for us to know.

17
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,469
Which begs the question: if Leonardo DiCaprio

18
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,720
really eats raw bison liver and nobody
is around to see it,

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,600
does he still get the Oscar?

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,680
Needed to be done because
we were striving for authenticity.

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,040
Modern method acting is based on a
system developed in the Soviet Union as

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,980
a way to structure training for actors.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,530
The system provides a framework for

24
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,460
actors to understand their characters, by
drawing on their own experiences and imagination.

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,520
Many method actors take this
to an extreme, pushing themselves to live

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
as if they really were their character.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,160
But are intense method acting performances really better?

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,920
If you just look at the numbers, the Academy seems to

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,600
think they are.

30
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:22,420
Since 1951 there have been 132 Oscars awarded for

31
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,510
Best Actor and Best Actress and 59 have
gone to actors with some training in

32
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,560
method acting. And 33 of these Oscars
specifically went to actors who used

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,860
method acting techniques to prepare for
the role.

34
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,480
But there's more to method acting than just winning Oscars.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,060
There's been this kind of evolutionary dynamic

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,600
between watching an actor just for who
they are, their screen presence, their persona,

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,120
versus how they inhabit or
interpret a character.

38
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,840
Take Tom Cruise, for example.

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,440
Whether he's fighting a
mummy,

40
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,140
fighting Morgan Freeman,

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,040
or fighting the shogunate,

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,120
it's impossible to see Tom Cruise as anyone but himself.

43
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,460
Does Tom Cruise even know the names of
the characters he's playing anymore?

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,780
What is your name?

45
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,080
This creates a problem for
actors. They become captives to their star personas.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Look at Leonardo DiCaprio
for another example.

47
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,860
Despite being nominated five times as an
actor,

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,440
Jamie Foxx in Ray.

49
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,900
He didn't actually win

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,920
an Oscar until 2016. And he won for what
happened to be his most intensive method acting role.

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,960
I don't know who goes
through the stronger emotional roller

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,600
coaster really, and physically: your
character or the audience.

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Me.

54
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,840
So taking on ambitious method acting
performances can help actors be taken

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
more seriously. But there might be a more
cynical reason behind method acting's popularity.

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,600
Really have seen method
acting become a marketing tool. It doesn't

57
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,020
matter how good your performance is
unless you have a really good

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,340
behind-the-scenes story to accompany it.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,000
Hollywood is a business and businesses need marketing.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,580
When Daniel Day-Lewis
goes on Oprah, he gets to promote his

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,180
movie while also highlighting his own
work as an actor.

62
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,660
I've begin to hear a voice.

63
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,560
Kind of a fingerprint of the soul.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,940
"Fingerprint of the soul", very good.

65
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,620
There's no way for actors to show us all

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,500
the work that goes into a role, so they
have to tell us instead.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,440
My reaction to

68
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,960
eating that piece of meat is right up on
screen.

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
But that doesn't mean method acting

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,860
is all about marketing, either.

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,900
After all, it helped Leonardo DiCaprio go

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,540
from this

73
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,020
"Open your eyes."

74
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,740
to this.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,960
It really caught on in terms of

76
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,830
transforming the appreciation of an
actor, from being someone we just enjoy

77
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,170
watching on screen, to being someone who
really is consummate in their craft, who

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,540
works tirelessly to do justice to their
character and serve the role as best as

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,300
they can.

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,270
Actors that have pursued intense method

81
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,300
acting routines have created some of the
most memorable performances ever.

82
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,960
And to be fair to Leo, if I ate raw bison liver,

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:00:00,000
I would tell people too.
