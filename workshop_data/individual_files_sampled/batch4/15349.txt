imagine being a post mates delivery person you've gone to a vendor or a restaurant or something and you've picked up a takeout order you load up your wares and take off on your bike to deliver to the recipient then some shady looking dudes decide that whatever you have on you which is probably a twenty dollar food order and maybe ten bucks and change whatever you have on you these guys want oh and by the way you are not in Mayberry middle America crime free zone you're in Harlem oh but worse than Harlem London I know you're thinking what how is London worse than Harlem an article published by the Daily Mail reports that you are 25% more likely to be mugged in London than Harlem New York so let's put things in perspective Harlem as in crack cocaine Harlem where the leading cause of death is homicide home of the notorious organized crime gang East Harlem purple hitmen and heroin dealers that Harlem it is now officially safer for you to live there than London but getting back to my story he probably already figured out that your delivery job is in London so you are out delivering an order these guys come up on you and jump you there are more of them than you specifically for so you're kind of starting to fear for your life a little bit and then out of the blue someone hops out of a car and runs to your side and to your defense the perpetrators seem to be shocked at the sight of this man unreasonably so like he's the Hulk or something but he's not the Hulk upon further inspection you realized that it is Benedict Cumberbatch Benedict freaking Cumberbatch Doctor Strange Sherlock Holmes famous and highly regarded actor Benedict Cumberbatch is your savior pretty amazing right like maybe I wouldn't really mind getting mugged if it was Captain America coming to my rescue and I know a lot of you guys out there wouldn't mind getting mugged if it was going to be gal gadot aka Wonder Woman saving her fanny but yes this actually happened in London over the weekend the uber driver Manuel Diaz told the Sun I was taking Benedict and his wife to a club but I didn't know it was him at first I went to turn down into merrill apone High Street and we saw four guys were pushing around delivery cyclist my passenger jumped out ran over and pulled them in a way they turned towards him and things look like getting worse so I joined in he stood there instructing them in the street shouting leave him alone Diaz said that it wasn't actually until later that evening that here I realized who his famous superhero passenger was now people call it luck that Cumberbatch who is now a real-life superhero was near but considering there are 7.4 attacks per 1000 people in London it's actually pretty likely that some heroic film figure will be nearby with that many muggings and attacks your chances are getting higher and higher because it's happening so frequently so yeah there's more crime in London than in notoriously crime-infested Harlem New York but hey maybe a super hero will come to your defense yippee thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we have an unlimited supply of them here at the rebels so subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
