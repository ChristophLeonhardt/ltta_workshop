1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,400
This is satellite imagery
of a practice area

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,010
for military parades
in Pyongyang, North Korea.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,100
The show of force from
the country’s dictatorship

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,420
is nothing new.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,190
But this particular
parade happens to come

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,220
just one day before the
Olympic opening ceremonies

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,239
in neighboring South Korea.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,210
North Korea knows
it’s being watched.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,370
So whatever we’re seeing
is what the country

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,050
is O.K. with showing.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,420
The official parade ground
is actually here,

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,930
in the city center.

13
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,720
There’s a large
permanent viewing stand

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,550
for the country’s leadership.

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,740
This is what past parades
at this location

16
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,840
have looked like
from the ground.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
The nearby practice area is
actually a replica of the official site,

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,050
and even has a viewing stand.

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,330
Here we see
troop formations,

20
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,570
what appears to be
a military band

21
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,000
and columns
of military vehicles.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,700
Joseph Bermudez, an analyst
writing for Johns Hopkins's

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,680
38 North website, thinks
there might actually

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,820
be 13,000 troops
practicing in these images.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
What we don’t see are the
latest missile launchers.

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,350
Analysts suspect
they might actually

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,500
be stored here, in this
nearby camouflaged facility.

28
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,190
These ground marks
may be tracks created

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,330
by heavy military vehicles
kept in these shelters.

30
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,320
Some parade activities are
practiced back in the city center.

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,260
This shot shows an image
of an empty square.

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,870
Here is the same square the
day after, with scores of people

33
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,470
holding red pompoms that
spell out a slogan saying,

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,390
“One against 100.”

35
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,550
It’s a message to
its citizens, but also

36
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,410
to those watching from above,
that North Korea sees itself

37
00:01:32,410 --> 00:00:00,000
as a nation constantly under
threat from the outside world.
