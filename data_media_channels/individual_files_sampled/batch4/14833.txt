Nigel Farage is considering running for mayor of London but could he really win the news today is that Nigel Farage is considering running for mayor of London in 2020 so Sadiq Khan who replaced Boris Johnson the Labour Mayor of London of course has not exactly been great he's not hugely popular with a lot of people but also there's a lot of people that would vote labour regardless of who the candidate is we always say up north you could stick a red rose out on a pig and people north would still vote for it and it seems true in London Sadiq Khan is the Labour candidate and therefore he gets the Labour vote but you know the crime has skyrocketed knife crime has skyrocketed the prioritization of police resources has been called into question under his leadership he's a nightmare and this really there is room for someone to take his place now the Financial Times reports today mr. Faraj who lives in Bromley in South London quit as leader of the UK Independence Party in July 2016 weeks after the UK voted to leave the EU he is still a member of European Parliament but will lose his position when the UK leaves the EU next March mr. Faraj who were stood unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times but has been elected three times as an MEP said the London mayoral election in May 2020 would be an opportunity to make arguments on a high-profile platform quote I have been encouraged to stand by a group of people but that doesn't mean I'm going to he said I haven't said no to it I'm thinking about it the Tory party are very actively aware that if I did stand they would probably come third and they are afraid of that he added they also reported that a senior Conservative official had said that Downing Street was braced for electoral embarrassment if Nigel did stand for mayor because well they think maybe maybe the Tories would come second and you know what I think I think it's the case that the Tories could be embarrassed by this I'm not sure however if you would actually beat the Tories I'm not sure if Nigel Faraj would actually come second I think he'd do very well there are Tories in London and there are breaks or tears in London they minority but they're there but I don't think that most of these people would vote for Nigel I guess what I have to wait and see cuz the Tories aren't popular right now but neither is you Kip and it's certainly not as popular as it was in its heyday and frankly nor is Nigel Faraj and there's another question here would Nigel stand as an independent or would he stand for you Kip because there's been some bad blood between Nigel Farage and Gerald batten they've never really been good friends I think that's pretty public knowledge and they are quite different on policy battens gone down this route of talking about Islam a little bit more and Faraj doesn't like that so you know what would for us really stand behind batten on this one I'm not sure and also there's two years to go this is 20/20 we're talking about batten actually even publicly attacked leave means leave which is the organization that Faraj is involved with it's campaigning for a proper Bragg's it's like the brexit referendum all over again because batten said that you need more than just a a pro brexit campaign group that's going around the country you need to do something that's actually going to change things which he thinks you can so if Nigel ran what do you think do you think he'd stand as you kick would he stand as an independent and do you think that he could beat the Tories or could he beat labour it's my personal opinion that London won't see a Conservative mayor ever again the demographics are completely against that the city is less British than ever in' so a party that defends british values is not going to succeed it might have a a large minority supporting it but it's never gonna reach the majority of her again I don't think unless somehow the Tories have some amazing candidate maybe Boris Johnson could still do it I don't know actually maybe not after breaks it I think people voted for Boris not because he was a Tory but because he was a bumbling buffoon that people just seem to like for some reason the Tories don't have any great candidates have you seen this guy Andrew Boff that was running for the Tories with his hashtag I'm backing both I mean apart from the fact that his name means fart the gut is boring he actually held a a Youth Q&A now is there anything less off-putting to young people than an event with the word youth in it who goes to those who goes to those events and it was funny actually on his Facebook event page for that event it a picture of him with a bicycle helmet on with his bicycle like looking cool you know is it come on the Tories have got nobody nobody inspiring at all and I think Nigel knows this and he's probably just using it as a way of pressuring the Tories they've got nobody very good the backtracking on drags it with the checkers deal so maybe Faraj is using this at pressuring the Tories this is something that he's done excellently for many years if he puts the fear of God into the Tories that they might be embarrassed in the mayoral election then they might shift and combine that with the fact that he's doing this work would leave means leave it could be just what the Tories need to be pushed in the right direction if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to Like and subscribe you
