I think that guy's right he sad about Toronto sad about what's happening he's worried either he doesn't know if it was Isis or not how would he know and member that was recorded before Isis publicly claimed responsibility this morning so the CBC and the government are telling him one thing but his gut is telling him another and now Isis is telling him something else that claim of mental illness really if you're depressed and many people are depressed does that make you take a gun and mow down people on the street The Globe and Mail reports distance is interesting they say that a Sikh man walked by the murderer on the street and the murderer said to him don't worry I won't kill you what did he mean by that why why did he say that to the Sikh man was the only killing Christians or white people who knows but it's out there it's a fact that here's a criminal lawyer who actually managed to speak some truth about this on live TV in Toronto they didn't know who's gonna say this so they couldn't cut him off could they here take a listen most press release that comes out from the family that says there's nothing to see here mental health issues comes out at the very moment that the young man's name is released I have questions about that sure there might be mental health issues sure the police might have come before but to end this conversation and be to be told by certain very prolific people in this country that we should ask no questions about his background no questions about his belief system no questions about what he's reading or viewing online or what his thoughts might be to me is the most elite anti intellectual project I've ever seen when this isn't some random act of violence that resulted in nobody being hurt 15 16 people were mowed down and as the police are doing their job we need to find out what the evidence is but the mental health aspect which is constantly used for these kinds of shootings and attacks is way overplayed and I can tell you if he was still alive he would not be getting a get-out-of-jail-free card access of the mental health issue yeah look there's enough truth poking through the fog of Lies here I mean let's be honest this was this was terrorism we all know it we all know it I think the reason why that crazy teacher was so crazy is because she knew it but she didn't like in fact someone was saying it I don't think she would have been that revved up if she didn't know it was true and she was just trying fighting against her own disillusionment all the irregularities here delaying publishing the terrorist name publishing a PR document as if it's a real letter from the family running with that mental health excuse without any corroboration or any proof or any reasonableness downplaying the ISIS claim even as every single major newspaper in the world reported that I tell you what I don't think I don't think they're getting away with it I think normal people notice what's going on they know this was a terrorist attack don't think people don't see the five P professionals politicians the press police prosecutors and professors don't think we don't notice that they're all obscuring the truth together not clarifying things but they're all telling us to mind our own business not to worry our pretty little heads about things a teacher enraged that someone would dare ask a question a prime minister in hiding a state broadcaster colluding with in the Islamic activists we notice it we see it at least those of us paying attention they want to shut us up there what to shut us down but it's moments like this for an independent media like the rebel is most valuable that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
