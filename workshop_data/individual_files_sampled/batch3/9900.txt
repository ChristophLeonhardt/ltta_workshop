COMPETITION IS SET TO BE THE FINAL RACE OF DANICA PATRICK'S HISTORIC CAREER HISTORIC CAREER. ABBY: WHAT A CAREER SHE HAS HAD. IS IT TIME TO REINSTATE THE DRAFT THE BE THAT AS IT MAY NEW YORK POST OP-ED ARGUES THAT AMERICAN STUDENTS GRADUATE SCHOOL WITH A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT AND THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT THAT IS WITH MANDATORY MILITARY SERVICE. GRIFF: OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS STUDENTS, QUOTE, NEED TO BE TAUGHT THAT THE WORLD OWES THEM NOTHING, THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR LIVES, AND I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY OF DOING THIS THAT COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE. PETE: THE AUTHOR OF THAT OP-ED IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "THE REPUBLICAN WORKERS PARTY." FRANK BUCKLEY JOINS US NOW TO EXPLAIN. FRANK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE YOUR PREMISE. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM ON THIS, BUT THEN THE LOGISTICS OF A COUNTRY OF 300 MILLION PEOPLE GIVING ONE YEAR OF COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE, WE SEE IT IN COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL THAT HAVE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT. HOW WOULD YOU STOP IT FROM BALLOONING INTO A BEHEMOTH? IT'S NOT JUST ISRAEL. IT'S A LOT OF OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL, COUNTRIES THAT ARE FAIRLY PACIFIC, AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WAR. IT'S ABOUT REALLY ADDING AN EXTRA YEAR OF EDUCATION. I MEAN, RIGHT NOW IT'S COMPULSORY EDUCATION, K TO 12, K TO AGE 16, AND I'M SAYING, OKAY, WHAT IF WE ADDED ONE EXTRA YEAR? BECAUSE WHAT THAT WOULD DO WOULD BE TO TEACH OUR STUDENTS SOMETHING THEY DON'T GET FROM THEIR K-12 EDUCATION, WHICH IS A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY, A LOVE OF THE COUNTRY, AND ALSO THE IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL PART OF ONE AMERICAN FAMILY, RIGHT? I MEAN, ON MEMORIAL DAY, MAYBE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE ONE THING WHICH REALLY SERVES TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN SERVICE IN THE MILITARY. PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY ARE HAVE BETTER VALUES AND A STRONGER SENSE OF IDENTIFICATION WITH THE COUNTRY. AND ONE EXTRA YEAR OF EFFECTIVELY SCHOOLING IN THE MILITARY WOULD NOT BE A BAD IDEA THEN THEN. ABBY: LET'S GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND WHY YOU WANTED TO WRITE THIS PIECE BECAUSE YOU SAY OTHER THAN EDUCATION BEING THERE TO INFORM PEOPLE AND EDUCATE THEM YOU SAY IT WAS SUPPOSED INSTILL A LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, YOU TALKED ABOUT UNITE US TO BRING PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE AND EVERY CLASS TOGETHER. YOU SAY EDUCATION IS NOT DOING THAT SO TALK TO US ABOUT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM AND IF IT ISN'T A DRAFT, BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WE DON'T HAVE A DRAFT WHAT IS THE ANSWER TO THAT PROBLEM? PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO A COUPLE THINGS. ONE IS EDUCATE OR KIDS. THEY DON'T DO THAT VERY WELL. I MEAN, WE'RE AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE THIRD WORLD AS FAR AS THAT GOES, BUT THE OTHER STUFF IS THE STUFF THAT THEY USED TO DO. PUBLIC SCHOOL USED TO BE THE MOST AMERICAN THING ABOUT AMERICA. AND YOU'D GET OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL LEARNING SOME PRETTY GOOD VALUES. AND NOW, THE TEACHING CORPS HAS COMPLETELY ABANDONED THAT MISSION. WHERE YOU WOULD FIND IT WOULD BE IN THE MILITARY. SO I'M SAYING ONE EXTRA YEAR, YOU KNOW, UP TO NOW IT'S AGE, YOU KNOW, TO AGE 16, ADD ANOTHER NEAR. GRIFF: FRANK, IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND, YOU KNOW, TO REALLY TEACH THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN THE SERVICE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT WOULD BE GREAT. BUT DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE WITH THE CULTURE OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TODAY, THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE TEACHERS, PARTICULARLY IN THE LATTER YEARS ENCOURAGING THEIR STUDENTS TO REALLY GET FIRED UP TO GO SERVE THEIR NATION IN THE HISTORY IN THIS CULTURE? NO, NOT AT ALL. AND THAT'S THE POINT. THE TEACHER CORPS, YOU KNOW, THE NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION WILL BE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO THAT. WHY? BECAUSE IT WOULD TEACH A LOVE OF AMERICA, IT WOULD TEACH PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, ALL THE THINGS THEY HATE. SO, YEAH, ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE SHOULD DO IT. THE ONLY PEOPLE I FEEL SORRY ABOUT FOR IN ALL OF THIS WOULD BE THE DRILL INSTRUCTORS. PETE: YOU AND ME BOTH. GO TO BASIC TRAINING, BASIC MILITARY SERVICE NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE, IS THAT THE CONCEPT? THAT'S DREADED BASICALLY, ONE EXTRA YEAR EXTRA YEAR. PETE: ONE X-RAY YEAR, INFUSE VALUES THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT DOING NOW. ABBY: IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO JOIN THE MILITARY, GET TO KNOW THESE MEN AND WOMEN, BECAUSE AS YOU SAID THEY ARE OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUALS AND THEY ARE WHAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT. FRANK BUCKLEY, INTERESTING PIECE
