5
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:07,213
ONE OF THE STRANGER QUESTS IN

6
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:10,116
THIS SAGA, ONE OF THE KEY G.O.P.

7
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:12,418
SENATORS COULD MISS PART OF THIS

8
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:13,553
HISTORIC CONCLUSION ON SATURDAY

9
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,154
BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER IS GETTING

00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:15,555

00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:18,758
JOINING US NOW LIVE, MONTANA

12
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:19,225
REPUBLICAN, WOW.

IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

14
00:00:21,762 --> 00:00:22,562
EVERYONE HAD A LITTLE FREAK OUT

15
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,729
TODAY WHEN THEY REALIZE HER

16
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,764
DAUGHTERS GETTING MARRIED ON

17
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,498
SATURDAY, DID THEY THINK THEY

18
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:26,499
WANT TO VOTE.

19
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,234
WHAT IS THE PLAN?

20
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,002
>> A MONTH AGO I WOULDN'T EXPECT

21
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,306
THIS TO BE HERE.

22
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:34,540
I JUST SPOKE WITH JUDGE

23
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,641
KAVANAUGH, GAVE HIM A CALL

24
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:36,108
TONIGHT.

25
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,311
THE NEWS WAS OUT THERE ABOUT THE

26
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:38,911
WEDDING.

27
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,546
I SAID JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WANT TO

28
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:41,881
BE CLEAR, MY SUPPORT FOR YOU HAS

29
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:46,319
BEEN UNWAVERING IN FACT AFTER

30
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,321
SPENDING THREE HOURS WITHOUT FBI

31
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,824
REPORT TODAY, NOT THAT IT WAS

32
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:53,125
EVER WANING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT

33
00:00:53,126 --> 00:00:55,127
THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PRESENTED

34
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:56,729
TODAY.

35
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,699
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO, ZERO

36
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,466
COOPERATING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

37
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,702
THESE ALLEGATIONS.

38
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:03,803
I SAID JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I'M

39
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:05,304
GOING TO BE THERE TO VOTE FOR

40
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:09,275
YOU AS NEEDED.

41
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,744
>> Shannon: D OF MACHINE?

42
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:12,279
>> HERE'S HOW

43
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:12,746
IT

44
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,714
IS GOING TO WORK.

45
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,749
THE NEXT IMPORTANT VOTE IS

46
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,350
TOMORROW AT 10:30 A.M.

47
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:20,519
WE HAVE TO GET PAST THAT VOTE.

48
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,456
THAT WILL SET THE CLOCK HERE FOR

49
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,490
SATURDAY.

50
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:25,791
I HAVE A WEDDING ON SATURDAY.

51
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:26,993
MY GOAL THIS WEEKEND IS TO WALK

52
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:29,862
MY DAUGHTER DOWN THE AISLE AND

53
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:31,364
TO SEE A NEW UNITED

54
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,399
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

55
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,268
>> Shannon: SO YOU HAVE SOME

56
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:35,701
KIND OF PLAN?

57
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:37,637
>> Laura: I DO.

58
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:40,306
THERE'S NOTHING SECRET ABOUT IT.

59
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,508
BOTH ARE HELD OPEN ALL THE TIME

60
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,309
BEFORE THE U.S. SENATE.

61
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,845
ONCE A VOTE IS CALLED, THERE

62
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:47,113
BEEN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

63
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:48,381
GOING BACK IN HISTORY AND SEEING

64
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:50,283
WHERE THEY HAVE HAPPENED FOR A

65
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:53,919
MEMBER TO COME BACK.

66
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,887
I WILL BE THERE.

67
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:56,622
THE MAGIC NUMBER IS 50.

68
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,658
WE NEED TO GET TO THAT TOMORROW

69
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,160
AND THAT WE NEED TO GET TO 50 ON

70
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:01,527
SATURDAY.

71
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,929
>> Shannon: OTHERWISE, IT WILL

72
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,764
BE WATCHING FOR YOU RUNNING IN

73
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:06,132
THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NIGHT, MAY BE

74
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:09,802
YOUR TUXEDO?

75
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:12,338
>> AS NEEDED.

76
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,040
WE WILL FIND OUT A LOT TOMORROW

77
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,541
AT 10:30 ON THAT VOTE.

78
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:16,575
WE HAVE A PLAN READY TO GO.

79
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,478
I SURE THE JUDGE, I'VE BEEN

80
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,246
BEHIND JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM THE

81
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:23,482
FIRST TIME BUT I SAW.

82
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:24,717
WE MET IN EARLY JULY AND HAD A

83
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:25,484
CHANCE TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH HIM

84
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,720
IN MY OFFICE.

85
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,722
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS,

86
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,524
SPENDING THREE HOURS TODAY AND

87
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,158
CONTINUING TO DO MIGHT DO

88
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,292
DILIGENCE OF THE SENATOR.

89
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,727
I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION

90
00:02:34,728 --> 00:02:35,594
THAT I AM SOLIDLY VOTING FOR

91
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:35,961
HIM.

92
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:37,963
I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE YES.

93
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:41,500
>> Shannon: REALLY QUICKLY,

94
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:42,668
SOME OF YOUR SENATORS ACROSS THE

95
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,305
AISLE ARE NOT AS CONVINCED.

96
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:47,640
SENATOR KAINE CALLING IT A

97
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:48,307
COMPLETE SHAM.

98
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,109
OTHER SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT

99
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,409
LEGIT.

100
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,844
>> THEY ARE OUT OF ARGUMENTS.

101
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,513
THEY ARE.

102
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:55,681
IT IS JUST DESPERATION.

103
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:56,782
IF YOU ARE FAIR-MINDED, TAKE A

104
00:02:56,783 --> 00:03:00,319
LOOK AT WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS.

105
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,121
YOU WILL SAY THAT THESE

106
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:02,722
ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE.

107
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,924
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.

108
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,126
IT IS A VERY CLEAR-CUT VOTE FOR

109
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:07,393
ME.

110
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,327
>> Shannon: YOU ARE YES AND WE

111
00:03:08,328 --> 00:00:00,000
WILL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.
