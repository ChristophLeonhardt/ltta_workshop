00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
if you go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the woods today I'm</font>

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,220
not entirely sure who you would find but

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,799
if you went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Epping Forest a few</font>

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago you may have found four girls</font>

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,349
on a stroll into the woods singing into

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,969
the woods singing out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the woods</font>

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">sinning every woodland song imaginable</font>

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it was such a lovely little retreat</font>

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,600
I don't really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe it</font>

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,470
as a place it just takes you out of the

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,119
city<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously because you're in a</font>

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,189
woodland obvious statement but it

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,360
reminds me<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
walking through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Central Park in New York</font>

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,090
and you can't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cards anymore the</font>

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,300
trees actors total soundproof and you're

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,700
in somewhere else for a little bit and

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,870
that's what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like I've never</font>

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,360
been one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for countryside I don't fancy</font>

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,700
it very much which is why sometimes when

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,070
I tell people you've known me<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long</font>

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,870
time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've moved Indianapolis which</font>

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,070
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I felt embarrassed or</font>

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,909
shy or like it was self-serving or what

34
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,850
I don't know what the hesitation was

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,369
sometimes before asking my friends to do

36
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,799
fun things and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,869
now we're more independent we have more

38
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:41,340
stability I suppose most of us work

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,460
weekdays and have similar days off or at

40
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,810
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to it and it's possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,720
us to put time aside and do things like

42
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,210
swing on random ropes in the middle of

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the forest and stroll around and go for</font>

44
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,790

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,130

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,440

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,269
do that you know like wait why are my

56

friends why we why do we just netflix so

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,730
much at the time but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually</font>

58
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,170
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the stuff that we do do</font>

59
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,739
do do do do we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to football matches</font>

60
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,459
and the forest we go to museums we look

61
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,340
at book shops and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i stopped selling</font>

62
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,220
myself short you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that there</font>

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,170
are so many ways in which we try and

64
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,110
find ourselves and adequate but it's not

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,940
until I document them that I realized

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,360
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> how often I do it it's just every</font>

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,299
moment it's trying to find places in

68
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,739
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing better and part</font>

69
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,150
of that is checking yourself part of

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,069
that space to grow part of that space to

71
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,290
learn and discover new things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Geney</font>

72
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,110
things but sometimes it's just pure

73
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,930
judgment so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like being</font>

74
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,840
around my friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it takes you</font>

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,859
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that headspace and just puts you</font>

76
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:22,560
there with one another in this fun

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
environment having a good time being

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,389
with the people who matter the most to

79
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:34,950
you I'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tomorrow fun fact I</font>
