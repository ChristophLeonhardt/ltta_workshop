Axios has obtained some leaked audio from the g7 summit that happened recently now that summit was a complete and utter disaster took place in Canada and it essentially ended with Trump showering his relations with some of our longest standing allies and we've now learned some more about those interactions through this leaked audio now I'm gonna list some of those things for you right now Trump apparently told the other leaders that NATO is as bad as NAFTA okay so that is something to keep in mind because the NATO summit is going to happen next month in July July 11th through the 12th in Brussels and so right now the g7 leaders are under the impression that the NATO summit is gonna be very similar where Trump is going to be combative he's gonna accuse them of not spending enough money or paying their fair share of NATO and remember NATO is the type of alliance that Russia is not in favor of so that could be problematic Trump made the comment after being after telling the g7 leaders that Crimea probably should belong to Russia because everyone there speaks Russian okay two things here first NATO is as bad as NAFTA took me a while to decipher like what is he talking about because one's a trade agreement the others and military alliance I don't know what that means it and NATO was from decades ago after World War two and is like the very basis for our foreign policy and our military strategy in the world which is that the Western world and and democracies stand together and if you attack one you attack us all now it's work for all this time because of NATO none of those countries have ever been attacked right so that is why a lot of the Eastern European countries want to be in NATO so NAFTA is a trade agreement that's a totally different thing and and and so I finally figured out what's going on in the mind because he says oh as an appointed out NATO is not the European countries are not paying their bills into NATO enough so everything is financial right right and so if it turns out that Estonia is a little behind in their bills well there's so what if Russia takes Estonia I hear a lot of people there talk Russian anyway I mean that would be the logic based on what he just said about Crimea second point is I think he's controlled by Putin you might disagree there's a good disagreement on that issue and it's a fair disagreement but if you're Vladimir Putin whether Trump is working for you or not this is exactly what you would want Trump to say why would he out of nowhere feel the need to mention Crimea weaksauce argument in favor of Russia annexing Crimea oh they speak they speak Russian so okay so should I don't know if if some other country speaks English should they be able to come and overtake the United States because we speak English is welding that is such a stupid argument it's such a weak sauce argument come on parts of Brooklyn speak Russian should we give it to the Russians by the way sorry I shouldn't give them any ideas doesn't make any sense and by the way so like as always this is a very nuanced issue because Trump is actually right some of our NATO allies could be spending more money in funding it right they are not paying their fair share but here's the thing that's fascinating he has no interest in negotiating it right so instead of trying to negotiate it he just attacks them NATO's terrible and he's kind of messaging or signaling that he's planning on pulling out of this agreement there's literally nothing else an American president could have said that would have made Putin happier so if it's a coincidence it's a hell of a coincidence and Putin's gotta be thinking how did I get this lucky right so I get an American president to try attack his own alliance that alliance that I hate he the American president broke within attacks NATO and says he doesn't believe in it like because to be clear Trump says he's totally against NAFTA and that NAFTA is a terrible idea so if NATO is like NAFTA that means NATO is terrible and Trump is totally against it Putin's got to be going yes hey da da and then but he's like wait I'm not done plus I think you should keep Crimea if it's not anything that's untoward foods we gotta be looking around going how did I get this lucky how could I have an American president that does more for me and and for my the oligarchs that run Russia so of course you know what I think I don't think it's a coincidence and as we know from the public record so plot please please stop saying there's no evidence okay there there is mountains of public evidence that Trump has deal done and financial deals with Russia and with Russian oligarchs throughout his life for decades and they appeared to have every trapping of money laundering in public and his own idiot sons have admitted oh where do we get the money for the golf courses from the Russians one of the idiots said apparently they really like golf okay another amazing coincidence okay hey a guy who got all this money after he went bankrupt for the sixth time from Russian oligarchs when he's president those things that don't white the Russian oligarchs amazing coincidence so after this NATO summit he will be going to a different country Finland to meet with Vladimir Putin which is fine I don't have a problem with him having a meeting with Vladimir Putin I have a problem with it in the context of everything that's going on because while he's being incredibly combative with our allies he's also simultaneously being very friendly with Vladimir Putin according to the reports Trump will meet with Putin on July 16th Helsinki Finland the two leaders will discuss relations between the United States and Russia and a range of national security issues now keep in mind that Trump also recently tweeted that Russia's you know Russia says something so we should all believe it Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election where is the DNC server okay yeah I know but what about something I'm gonna get into that right but Russia continues to say so I'm gonna go ahead and believe Russia that's it yeah I got news for you and I know some of you just don't want to believe it and I don't know why you don't want to believe it but he's the Serbian candidate ok sorry not Serbian that might be true too but the Siberian candidate Serbs are allies with Russians anyway look no one in their right mind that's the President of the United States writes that tweet after not only every single intelligence agency says yes they meddle in elections and yes they were favoring Donald Trump it doesn't mean that Trump worked with them but they were favoring Donald Trump and and and against Hillary Clinton but not only that even the incredibly biased House Republicans led by Devin Nunez who was part of his transition team said yeah the Russians meddled in the wash yeah okay and Trump comes and goes no I'd like to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin after I destroy NATO and I know that says he says it he must not have meddled with our elections at a bare minimum if you're in the crowd that says there's no evidence of collusion which I cannot believe you say that but that's okay we disagree at a bare minimum he's monstrously stupid he thinks oh we should take Vladimir Putin's word for it our intelligence community what do they know everybody else in America what do they know for Putin told me he didn't meddle so like a moron I will just take him at face value and say okay I guess Putin didn't meddle come on that's all right look if you think that's the it shows you that he's not biased in favor of Putin I got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you but be careful some of them speak Russian around there so Trump might give it away two easy ways
