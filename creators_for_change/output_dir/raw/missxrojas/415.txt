important those are the skills that we

30
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,230
should be valuing today so yeah skype

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,390
thumbs<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to there's often this idea</font>

32
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,890
that watching the film version is a

33
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,510
cheating easy way out when you're

34
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to be writing about the book</font>

35
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,420
but i would say that watching the film

36
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,980
version is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way of getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

37
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,899
the but even if you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it before after</font>

38
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">your reading of a book but of expanding</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're supposed to be studying has</font>

42
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,409
been interpreted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be or not to be</font>

43
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,060
watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> interviews with the actors that</font>

44
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,740
starred in this film that also has

45
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,509
tremendous academic value that helps you

46
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,770
get an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at when</font>

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,070
consider their characters how they

49
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,960
basically interpret the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves</font>

50
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,700
and what it is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take from the text</font>

51
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,170
and what assumptions they make about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

see which<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inc films</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a feel for</font>

doing an SEO and Julius Caesar you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

61
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,140
have a look at films like Elizabeth the

context based approach to the text it's

65
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,170
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth noting that anything would</font>

automatically an academic felt well

69
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,119
respected hyper degree genius number 31

70
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach I really like to take is using</font>

71
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,050
tumblr as a really valuable research

72
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,670
resource let's say I wanted to look at

73
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,600
fate in Julius Caesar if I type

74
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,010
werd fated to tumblr<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would imagine</font>

75
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it would immediately generate</font>

76
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,250
image-heavy interpretations of a text

77
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,450
not only is this a great research

78
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,310
results because who needs references

79
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,660
anyway it's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great way of</font>

80
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,520
investigating the extent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we</font>

81
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,090
prioritize images and site in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vigil</font>

82
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,890
economies within which we operate I

83
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,180
actually make those probably take no

84
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,830
more than two years the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university's to</font>

85
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,000
wake up to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's at that point</font>

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
that we can expect tumblr to be listed

87
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,960
under project news and JSTOR number<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

88
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,070
now one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've really noticed</font>

89
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,110
there's a huge pattern of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

90
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,430
people say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to turn off</font>

91
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">your internet or use one of those</font>

92

program blocking applications when you

93
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,430
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and do some work I</font>

94
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,270
would say that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very good</font>

95
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,590
approach because if you turn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">turning off the internet is actually</font>

103
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,270
very damaging to your personal work
