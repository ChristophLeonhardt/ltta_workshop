I got butterflies now.

Yeah speed limit's 35 buddy.

How am I going to fit these balloons in the

00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,698

them?

17
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:59,438
Do you wanna see what I'm saying?

18
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:00,658
>> Yeah, I hope you don't let them go.

19
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:02,528

23
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:11,318
>> For nearly 30 years, Lori Sousa worked
at a sheltered workshop in

24
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:15,848
North Providence Rhode Island called Training
Through Placement, or TTP.

25
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:21,958
It was a place where people with intellectual
disability did basic repetitive jobs.

26
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:28,448
One day about five years a new guy showed up,
Peter Maxmean.

27
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,838
>> I saw him and I don't know this might
sound a little funny.

28
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:34,808
Not to me it doesn't.

29
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,208
I looked at him I said I'm gonna marry that
guy.

30
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,028
That's my soul mate.

31
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:42,393
They worked next to each other as they tested
and cleaned used remote controls.

32
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,358
Sheltered workshops like theirs were once
seen as

33
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,648
a progressive alternative to institutions.

34
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,948
A place where people could be trained for
employment.

35
00:01:54,178 --> 00:02:00,088
But most of the workers at TTP including
Laurie, rarely got jobs on the outside.

36
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:04,616
The remained in the workshop, sometimes for

37
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:10,106
decades earning pay that average $1.57 an
hour.

38
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:14,693
>> I always used to say to the bosses I'd be
like I wanna go out, I wanna go out and

39
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:17,158
get a job I want to get trained for a job.

40
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:18,858
Put me out there I can do it.

41
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,028
In my opinion they never listened.

42
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,288
Laurie was sitting at the front desk one day
last year,

43
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:26,048
when federal investigators showed up.

44
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:31,228
The sheltered workshop was ultimately accused
of underpaying it's clients, and

45
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:34,298
of violating their civil rights by keeping
them segregated.

46
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,618
Now the State of Rhode Island is developing a
new approach to help people with

47
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,528
disability thrive in the workplace and in
society.

48
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:46,328
An approach that could become the model for
the rest of the country.

49
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:53,748
As a result, Peter and Lori are finding their
place in the outside world together.

50
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:56,018
>> I think I asked for the blue bow tie,
right?

51
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:57,268
I believe so.

52
00:02:57,268 --> 00:02:58,048
>> Correct.

53
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:02,076
>> Okay.
I was living in a group home in Smithfield.

54
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:06,208
Wow, this is probably the best I've looked in
a long time.

55
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,988
I was taken away from my biological mom when
I was like three years old.

56
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:12,676
I went to special needs school.

57
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:16,008
[CROSSTALK] And you look at me now, you'd
never think.

58
00:03:17,638 --> 00:03:22,298
So it was just back and forth between
different agencies and into a group home.

59
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:26,578
To now being independent in my own apartment,
for the last four years.

60
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,888
I know how to dance.

61
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:29,412
What?

62
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:31,151

>> In the gift thing first, cuz I've spent
everything else on the wedding.

175
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:29,438
Can you see if they've put anything into that
the gift box yet?

176
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:32,018
>> Had to go out to one table to a next table
to a next table.

[SOUND]

187
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:16,717
>> We have all come here today not only to
join two people together.

188
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:22,428
But to recognize that such a joining has
already taken place in their hearts.

189
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,038
This is your marriage, not something created
by the state or church.

190
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:28,688
It's yours to define.

191
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:29,844
Yours to live.

this on.

[SOUND]
The couple will take a one day honeymoon.

195
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:49,499
Then Tuesday morning Peter will be back at
work.

196
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:53,322
All I wanna do, is grow old with you.

197
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:55,448
Sorry.

198
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:59,745
I'll miss you, kiss you, 

199
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:10,118
Give you my coat when you are cold,
I wanna grow old with you.

200
00:10:10,118 --> 00:10:11,855
>> Sorry about the mic though.

201
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:14,020
