1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,729
Hackers today aren't like they were in those
80’s and 90’s movies.

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,899
“You want me to hack the planet?”

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:13,509
Now, cybercriminals can be state-sponsored,
breaking into servers and disrupting national

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:14,509
elections.

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,550
James Comey: One of the lessons they may draw
from this is that they were successful, because

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,570
they introduced chaos and division.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,730
They can be a nefarious collective, blackmailing
a multinational billion-dollar corporation

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,650
by threatening to release piles of its sensitive
data.

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,430
Or they can be agents looking to expose the
C.I.A.'s own hacking capabilities.

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,550
These elite professionals are always finding
new ways to gain entry to government, industrial

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,140
and financial networks.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,920
Luckily, as hackers get more sophisticated,
so are the safeguards protecting sensitive

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
data.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,469
So here’s the situation…

15
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,960
Since 2005, more than 5,400 data breaches
in the U.S. have been disclosed, the biggest

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,359
being the Adobe hack in 2013 with 152 million
records being compromised.

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,680
Individuals aren’t the only ones at risk.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,820
The U.S. has been battling an escalating cyber-war
with countries like China and Russia for years.

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,170
In 2016 multiple U.S. agencies concluded Russia
was behind the hacks of 20,000 Democratic

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,030
National Committee emails that were then posted
online, hoping to influence the election in

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,539
Donald Trump’s favor.

22
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:22,360
A conclusion Russian President Vladimir Putin
denies.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,979
If proper precautions are taken, not all hack
attacks have unhappy endings.

24
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,789
In May, 2014, 110 million payment card numbers
were stolen from Target, but those numbers

25
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:38,330
were useless because the PIN codes were encrypted,
and the banks immediately canceled all the

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,330
compromised accounts.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,399
Now Here’s the argument...

28
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,719
Cybersecurity is both worse and better than
it’s ever been.

29
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,940
The sheer size, scope, and frequency of attacks
from hackers is skyrocketing.

30
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,540
But the safeguards protecting individuals
and corporations are always being improved.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,649
The massive 2014 hack of JP Morgan didn't
result in financial losses for its customers,

32
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:02,179
who were covered by consumer-protection laws.

33
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:08,250
But it did spur JPMorgan to build a vast cyber
security operation staffed with former military

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,250
officers.

35
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,950
And the U.S. eventually identified and indicted
the hackers.

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,360
However, keeping data secure requires constantly
updating technology, and expensive human monitors

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,819
watching for any sign of trouble.

38
00:02:21,819 --> 00:00:00,000
High security comes with a high price tag.
