SAID WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE END OF
THIS BY ANY STRETCH.
IT'S AN INTERESTING COUNTRY TO
DEAL WITH.
>> Martha: THANK YOU WITH.
HERE NOW IS A NORTH KOREA IN THE
AND AUTHOR OF "GOOD LEADER."
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE WHOLE
THING?
>> THE TALKS HAVE BEEN BREAKING
DOWN A FEW DAYS NOW AS YOU
MENTIONED.
THE EARLY SENT AN ADVANCE TEAM
TO SINGAPORE AND TURNED OUT THE
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS WERE
REFUSING TO TAKE THEIR CALLS SO
THIS IS NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE THIS IS
RESPONDING TO NOT HAVING
NEGOTIATIONS AND THIS IS CLASSIC
NEGOTIATION.
YOU PUNISH BAD BEHAVIOR AND IF
THEY DON'T RETURN CALLS YOU HAVE
TO DRAW THE LINE.
>> Martha: WHAT POTENTIALLY
WOULD THEY AGREE TO?
YOU HAVE THE LIBYA MODEL WHICH
IS A COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION
WHICH GETS TO THEM AND THEN THE
IRAN DEAL MODEL.
YOU HAVE AN OVER TIME AGREEMENT.
>> THE MORE THE LIBYA MODEL IS
USED IS SCARY TO THEM AND GA  --
MOE
AND THEY'RE ACUTELY AWARE OF
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE
DICTATORSHIPS COLLAPSE.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IRAN AND
LIBYA THE PARTNER COUNTRY IS
CHINA.
THERE'S NO CHINA VIS A VIS IRAN
BUT THERE IS WITH NORTH KOREA
AND WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH
WHAT CHINA WANTS AND WILL ALLOW.
>> Martha: DO YOU AGREE WITH THE
PRESIDENT SAYING THE SECOND
MEETING KIM JONG-UN WENT WITH
PRESIDENT XI SOMETHING HAPPENED.
>> CHINA HAS A STRONG PART TO
PLAY AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE SO
MUCH IS ALLOWING KIM JONG-UN TO
SAFE FACE IF ONLY TO ALLOW HIM
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
>> Martha: WOULDN'T CHINA WANT
THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH
KOREA?
>> BUT THEY DON'T WANT REFUGEES
CROSSING THE RIVER THAT DON'T
KNOW HOW TO USE COMPUTERS.
>> Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE
MOUNTAIN THAT COLLAPSED MONTHS
AGO.
WAS WHAT THEY BLEW UP TODAY EVEN
USABLE?
>> AND REPORTS ARE RADIATION'S
COMING OUT AND THEY DO NOT LET A
GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE.
SOMETHING'S GOING TO BE
DESTROYED, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
