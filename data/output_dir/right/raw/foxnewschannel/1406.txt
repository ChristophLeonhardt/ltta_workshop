1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:08,387
JESSE: WELCOME TO "WATTERS

2
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:08,954
WORLD."

3
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,590
GETTING PLAYED FOR A CHUMP BY

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,226
DONALD TRUMP.

5
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:18,063
AFTER LITTLE ROCKET MAN BAD

6
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,165
MOUTHED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND

7
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:23,702
FAILED TO PREPARE FOR THE SUMMIT

8
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:25,270
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WITH JOHN

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,972
KERRY SHOULD HAVE DONE.

10
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:29,441
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

11
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,777
PRESIDENT TRUMP: I DECIDED TO

12
00:00:31,777 --> 00:00:33,812
TERMINATE THE PLANNED SUMMIT ON

13
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:34,980
JUNE 12.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,749
MANY THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND A

15
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:40,919
GREAT OPPORTUNITY LIES AHEAD

16
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:41,320
POTENTIALLY.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,155
I BELIEVE THIS IS A TREMENDOUS

18
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,157
SETBACK FOR NORTH KOREA AND

19
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,659
INDEED A SETBACK FOR THE WORLD.

20
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,962
FAN WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES TO

21
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:53,165
ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE

22
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,969
AND ACTIONS, I AM WAITING.

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,172
JESSE: POTUS SENT THE NORTH

24
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:01,640
KOREAN LEADER A LETTER WHICH

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,642
READ, YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR

26
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:04,409
NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES.

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:06,678
BUT OURS ARE SO MASSIVE AND

28
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:08,881
POWERFUL I PRAY TO GOD THEY WILL

29
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,050
NEVER HAVE TO BE USED.

30
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,753
I FELT A WONDERFUL DIALOGUE WAS

31
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:17,022
BUILDING UP BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

32
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,924
AND ULTIMATELY IT'S ONLY THAT

33
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:21,026
DIALOGUE THAT MATTERS.

34
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:25,397
SOME DAY I LOOK HAVE MUCH FORD

35
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,799
TO MEETING YOU.

36
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,801
IN THE MEANTIME I WANT TO THANK

37
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,971
YOU FOR THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.

38
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,807
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE.

39
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,376
INCREDIBLE LETTER AND CLASSIC

40
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,011
ART OF THE DEAL.

41
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:40,746
TRUMP NEVER LOCKED IN.

42
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:42,514
PRESIDENT TRUMP: IF THE MEETING

43
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,982
HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS.

44
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:46,818
IF IT DOESN'T, WE GO ON TO THE

45
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:47,486
NEXT STEP.

46
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:48,954
THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS

47
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:50,155
THAT WE WANT.

48
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:52,157
AND I THINK WE'LL GET THOSE

49
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:52,958
CONDITIONS.

50
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,894
IF WE DON'T, WE'LL HAVE A

51
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:56,228
MEETING.

52
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,898
>> SO THE PRESIDENT GAVE UP

53
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:02,668
NOTHING WHILE THE NORTH KOREANS

54
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,202
DESTROYED THEIR NUCLEAR TESTING

55
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:07,172
FAT SILT, COMMITTED TO END THE

56
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:13,078
KOREAN WAR AND RELEASED AMERICAN

57
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:13,979
HOSTAGES.

58
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:19,351
TRUMP PULLS OUT AND KIM IS PUT

59
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:21,954
IN HIS PLACE.

60
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:25,958
BUT THE LEFT SEES ONLY A WIN FOR

61
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:26,258
KIM.

62
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,961
>> I THINK IT'S WIN FOR KIM

63
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:29,595
JONG-UN.

64
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:31,597
WHEN HE GOT THIS LETTER FROM THE

65
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:34,399
PRESIDENT SAYING NEVER MIND, HE

66
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,501
MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE FIT.

67
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,972
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS REHEARSING

68
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:46,278
THE END ZONE DANCE AND WE ARE

69
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:53,952
NOT EVEN AT THE 50 YARD LINE.

70
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:58,657
JESSE: WHEN THE PRESIDENT

71
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,593
SCHEDULED THE SUMMIT THE LEFT

72
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,695
SAID KIM WON.

73
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,764
WHEN THE PRESIDENT PULLED OUT,

74
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:11,570
THE LEFT SAID KIM WON.

75
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,040
THEY SAY KIM JONG-UN'S SISTER

76
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,510
WAS A BETTER DIP MATTED THAN

77
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,844
IVANKA.

78
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:21,179
IN THE COURSE OF THIS

79
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,481
PRESIDENCY, DEMOCRATS HAVE

80
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,886
DEFENDED HAMAS, MS-13, IRANIAN

81
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,922
MULLAHS, WATERBOARD TERRORISTS,

82
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:33,325
RISKY SYRIAN REFUGEES AND

83
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,960
ANTIFA.

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,795
TRUMP'S SUCCESS HAS BOXED

85
00:03:36,795 --> 00:03:38,664
DEMOCRATS INTO SUCH RADICAL

86
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,666
POSITIONS THEY ARE BECOMING

87
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,770
POLITICALLY IRRATIONAL.

88
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,572
NOW THE KOREANS SIGNALING THEY

89
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:50,142
WANT THE MEETING BACK ON.

90
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,176
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WE'LL SEE WHAT

91
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:51,643
HAPPENS.

92
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,512
IT WAS A NICE STATEMENT THEY PUT

93
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:53,979
OUT.

94
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,447
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

95
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,882
IT COULD BE THE 12th.

96
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,517
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW.

97
00:03:58,517 --> 00:04:00,952
WE ARE GOING SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

98
00:04:00,952 --> 00:00:00,000
JESSE: CLEARLY THE NORTH KOREANS
