last week about this time we did the how divided is America America is so divided that the House of Representatives can't agree on a chaplain right it was like one of these like in two years before the second American Civil War they fought about this right like this you can't believe well guess what the House chaplain has rescinded his resignation let me read from the letter this is what he writes to Speaker Ryan I've never been disciplined nor reprimanded nor have I ever heard a complaint about my ministry during my time as House chaplain he goes on to say this is father Pat Conroy he's a Catholic he also claims that Ryan's chief of staff told him when asked why he was being let go it's he said something like maybe it's time that we had a chaplain that wasn't a Catholic that's hopeful for the midterms Chuck when this story first broke a Democratic lawmaker pulled me aside and said they're doing this because they want to replace him with an evangelical and I kind of dismissed it I said they wouldn't be so that wouldn't be so blatant that way they'd just do that and you know whether it was the prayer or something else recently that he had done that kind of like underscored that underneath it all was they wanted to replace him with an evangelical but when I saw that today that's gonna really hurt having a priest say it he believes he was asked to resign because he's Catholic that's via Catholic by a Catholic that's what makes that's the only I guess Ryan has cover on one hand but there was a lot of it and now I write we had one I believe there was one anonymous source that said House a House member who said well now we can't name anybody by the Catholic well this is a an object lesson why a nation with a pluralist religious tradition shouldn't have chaplains well what part of separation of church and state allows the chaplain the author the author of the First Amendment mr. Madison was in to the Congress that the first Congress established the chaplain and he said this was done without my approbation meaning he believed it was a mistake yes you know Madison had a point there Cornell yeah Madison's of vision Eric all I know Catholic voters aren't gonna like this and they're a sportin part of the midterm election well a lot of Republicans who are upset too this happened republican catholic you finally we do finally have a response from speaker Ryan this is all broken in the last hour he has put out this Center I have accepted father Conroy's letter and decided that he will remain in his position his job in the house my original decision was made in what I believe to be the best interest of this institution to be clear that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the house has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves it is my job as Speaker to do what is best for this body and I know that this body is not well served by a protracted fight over such an important post I intend to sit down with father Conroy early next week so that we can move forward for the good of the whole house probably a necessary statement by the speaker there mister well okay optional fight and I mean this is this is going out the door mr. Ryan indicates why he should've been there in the first place that's not his strength we were never told why he was asked for his resignation and we still don't have an answer and now he stays they are not very good at politics right now which is shocking like Republicans have always been better at they horrible at governing I would argue but barrett politics this is not good politics hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more be two press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
