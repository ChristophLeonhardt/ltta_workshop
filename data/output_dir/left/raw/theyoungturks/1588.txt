00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,719
A SELF-DESCRIBED YOUTUBE
INFLUENCER BY THE NAME OF

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:08,560
CHLOE FELDMAN POSTED A LITTLE
PIECE OF AUDIO THAT PEOPLE

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,880
HAVE BEEN DEBATING ABOUT AND
THE REASON WHY THEY ARE

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,410
DEBATING IS BECAUSE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE HERE SOMETHING

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,610
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER
PEOPLE.

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:20,240
IT IS THE WHOLE LAUREL OR JOHNNY
DEBATE AND WE ARE GOING TO

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,680
LET YOU LISTEN TO IT NOW AND
THEN YOU DECIDE FOR

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,779
YOURSELVES WHAT YOU HEAR AND
THEN WE WILL DISCUSS THE

9
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,659
POTENTIAL REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE
HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS.

10
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:34,330
TAKE A LOOK.

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,890
LAUREL.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,820
SO I PERSONALLY HEARD LAUREL.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,860
I HEARD LAUREL.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,490
I HEARD LONNIE.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:58,300
HE IS THE ONLY ONE HEARING
LONNIE.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,140
THAT IS PROBABLY WHY I HEARD
LAUREL, KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING?

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,960
I ALSO HEARD LAUREL, BUT
THERE ARE EXPERTS WHO STUDY

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,960
THINGS LIKE THIS AND HAVE SOME
POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS WHY

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:20,060
PEOPLE HEAR DIFFERENT THINGS.

20
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,469
THAT IS ACCORDING TO A
LINGUISTICS PROFESSOR

21
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:28,840
AND APPARENTLY I DIDN'T KNOW
THIS,

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,429
FREQUENCY, YOUR ABILITY TO HEAR
FREQUENCY CHANGES AS YOU AGE SO

23
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,350
AS YOU GET OLDER, YOU ARE LESS
LIKELY TO HEAR HIGHER

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,470
FREQUENCIES.

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,130
THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE
STORY.

26
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,189
IT IS TRIPPY THAT YOU COULD BE
IN THE ROOM WITH THE SAME

27
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,510
PERSON AND YOU HEAR SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM

28
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,530
WHAT THEY ARE HEARING THAT IS
THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY.

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,670
THIS IS JUST A STARKER EXAMPLE,
BUT WE ALL ACTUALLY HEAR AND SEE

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,740
AND SENSE THINGS SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENTLY.

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,969
THIS JUST HAPPENS TO BE STARK
ENOUGH THEY HAS CAUGHT OUR

32
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:06,000
ATTENTION AND OF COURSE THE GOLD
DRESS BLUE DRESS AS WELL BUT WE

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,799
ALL SEE AND HAVE DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE ON THE WORLD AND

34
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:16,239
THERE IS A WEIRD THING ABOUT ME
IN PARTICULAR, BECAUSE IT IS SO

35
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,989
HARD TO UNDERSTAND OTHER
PERSPECTIVES AND I TRY HARD AND

36
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,659
THIS IS A GOOFY EXAMPLE OF IT,
BUT THE EAGLE CAN SEE WAY

37
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,069
FURTHER THAN HUMAN BEINGS CAN.

38
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,709
OBVIOUSLY ALL ANIMALS ARE
DIFFERENT ANIMALS ARE INNOCENT.

39
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,819
I ALWAYS THINK WHAT DOES THE
EAGLE SEE?

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,640
I GET IT THAT YOU HAVE BETTER
EYESIGHT THAN I DO, YOU CAN

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
READ

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,569
FURTHER OUT BUT HOW DO YOU SEE
FURTHER?

43
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,630
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THAT, I DON'T HAVE THAT

44
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,840
PERSPECTIVE, IT IS HARD FOR ME
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,470
SEEING SO A STORY LIKE THIS IS
GREAT BECAUSE IT GETS US TO

46
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,010
REALIZE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES AND THAT THOSE

47
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,969
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AREN'T
NECESSARILY WRONG, THEY ARE JUST

48
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,299
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND THAT
WE ALL HAVE ONE THAT IS SLIGHTLY

49
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,250
DIFFERENT AND THAT IS WHY I AM
AN ADVOCATE OF AND IF ANYTHING

50
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,510
OVER COMMUNICATION, WHICH
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I'M A

51
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,470
TALKSHOW HOST.

52
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,490
THIS HAPPENS IN MARRIAGES AND
IN BUSINESSES, EVERYWHERE

53
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,290
WHERE EVERYBODY THINKS, MY
PERSPECTIVE NOT ONLY IS THE

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,910
RIGHT ONE BUT THEY THINK, ALMOST
EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THE

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,409
PERSPECTIVE THEY HAVE IS THE ONE
SHARED BY EVERYONE.

56
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,920
SO WHY ARE YOU REACTING THAT WAY
WHEN I DON'T REACT THAT WAY?

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,250
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE EVEN
PERCEIVED IN ANY WAY THE

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,469
WAY THAT YOU DID.

59
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,270
IF TWO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT
THE EXACT SAME THING OR

60
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,049
LISTENING TO THE EXACT SAME
AUDIO BUT THEY HEAR OR SEE TWO

61
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,110
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS,
THINK ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION THAT

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,030
THOSE TWO PEOPLE HAVE AS THEY
ARE COMMUNICATING ABOUT WHAT

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,859
THEY JUST SAW OR HEARD AND I
FEEL LIKE WE KEEP SEEING THAT

64
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,939
OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN IT
COMES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL

65
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:59,290
FACTS OF STORIES, FOR INSTANCE.

66
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,430
YOU WILL HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO SEE THE

67
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,549
SAME FACTS, BUT THEY INTERPRET
THOSE FACTS DIFFERENTLY.

68
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,249
THEY HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
WORLDVIEW.

69
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,680
I DO NOT KNOW, I JUST THINK THAT
IS FASCINATING AND IT MAKES

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,879
ME FEEL LIKE THERE IS NO HOPE.

71
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,629
LET ME GIVE A SMALL AND A BIG
EXAMPLE.

72
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:22,150
IF YOU GO AND SAY WHERE IS THE
GAP AND SOMEBODY WILL LOOK

73
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,990
AT YOU LIKE ARGUE STUPID, YOU GO
RIGHT AND LEFT, THEN RIGHT

74
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,990
AND LEFT.

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,650
OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BEEN TO THE MALL EVERY DAY

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,400
AND KNOW YOU KNOW WERE THE GAP
IS THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN

77
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,210
THERE BUT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THERE.

78
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,020
THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BUT ON
A GLOBAL SCALE, RIGHT NOW

79
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,220
ESPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY WE
HAVE SEPARATED INTO OUR

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,840
DIFFERENT CAMPS AND WE CANNOT
HEAR THE SAME THING AND WE

81
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,699
CANNOT SEE THE SAME THING AND WE
DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT

82
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,680
WE ARE NOT HEARING AND SEEING
THE SAME THING.

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,620
WE HAVE GOT TO GET PAST THAT
AND I BELIEVE THAT YANNY

84
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,270
VERSUS LAUREL WILL FIX ALL OF
THIS.

85
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,370
PERHAPS NOT, BUT IT IS BEGINNING
OF HOPEFULLY A LITTLE

86
00:05:02,370 --> 00:00:00,000
BETTER UNDERSTANDING.
