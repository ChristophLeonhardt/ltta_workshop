00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:50,002
ANYBODY WHO DID THIS, IS GOING

205
00:05:50,003 --> 00:05:52,705
TO PAY A PRICE.

206
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:53,240

BUT IT DIDN’T WORK.

211
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,047
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO

THEY HELPED US WIN THIS VOTE.

UNIFY OUR PEOPLE AND WIN THIS

223
00:06:16,664 --> 00:06:17,997

230
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:25,672
THIS UNDERSCORES HOW IMPORTANT

231
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,107
IT IS.

232
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,308
WE HAVE A CLOSE MARGIN.

233
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,577
VERY CLOSE MARGIN.

THEIR WEAKENED STATE TO

251
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,646
FACILITATE GANG RAPE.

NONSENSE WITH NO CORROBORATION.

264
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:32,106
THAT EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM.

KNOW, COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU

299
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,533
HAVE HAD AN INCREDIBLE RUN OF

300
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:32,834
CONFIRMING CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES,

301
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:33,402
DISTRICT JUDGES.

302
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:34,770
BUT THIS EXPERIENCE, LESSONS

303
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,438
LEARNED FOR THE REPUBLICAN

304
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,107
PARTY, THE SENATE, MAYBE THE

305
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:41,275
PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD.

THIS COUNTRY YOU’RE PRESUMED

308
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,817
INNOCENT, THE PRESUMPTION IS IN

309
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:50,419
FAVOR OF INNOCENCE.

310
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,954
WE ALSO RELEARNED THAT YOU

311
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:54,089
CAN’T -- YOU SHOULD NOT ALLOW

312
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,926
MOBS TO INTIM DATE YOU.

313
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,328
AND I THINK A GOOD LESSON FOR

314
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,696
US EXCITED ABOUT THE NOVEMBER

315
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:02,465
US, UNIFIED THE CONFERENCE, MADE

316
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,632
ELECTION, WAS GOOD FOR THE

317
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,967
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THAT

318
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,135
THESE PEOPLE WERE STOOD UP TO

319
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:06,869
AND THEY DIDN’T GET AWAY WITH

320
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,403
IT.

321
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,337
THEY DID NOT WIN.

322
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,439
THAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

323
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,274
>> Laura: HOW RADICAL HAS THE

324
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,876
DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF TODAY

325
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:14,210
BECOME?

326
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:15,611
>> PRETTY WILD BUNCH.

327
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:17,280
PRETTY CLEAR THEY WERE WILLING

328
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,148
TO DO ANYTHING, SAY ANYTHING, TO

329
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,017
TRY AND WIN.

330
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,619
NO BOUNDARIES.

331
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,654
>> Laura: YOU STILL HAVE CLOSE

332
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:25,855
FRIENDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

333
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,290
AFTER THIS OR EMOTIONS RAW?

334
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,691
>> I THINK WE’LL GET PAST IT IN

335
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:31,828
TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS.

336
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:33,129
BUT IT WAS A TOUGH PERIOD.

337
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,797
A TOUGH PERIOD.

338
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,699
I HOPE THEY LEARNED A LESSON.

339
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,134
THAT YOU CAN DO THIS KIND OF

340
00:09:38,135 --> 00:00:00,000
THING BUT IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY
