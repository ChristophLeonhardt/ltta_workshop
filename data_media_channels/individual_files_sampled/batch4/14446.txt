many give us an update on canada-us trade negotiations thank you that's right and I will I have been studying this issue for about two years even before Donald Trump became president I was part of an international legal association that was productive predominantly with American law firms and American PR firms and I was saying what Trump is saying today I was questioning so I has been on this issue for years and it's become it's coming to fruition with what Trump is doing and here let me give you an update since my last video our last video we now have Mexico with a new president who is working and appears there very close to a deal you might recall the Prime Minister Trudeau said that he was not interested in a bilateral deal he needs to have Mexico in with them and that was to me a complete and utter either a a staged event a lie or he had a different purpose if you're acting in Canada's interest you act for Canada and that is do a trade deal as quickly as possible and here's why trade is not a right I mean people have got to understand that no one has a right to trade with any other country it's done by way of agreement we don't have the right to put a McDonald's in North Korea we don't have a right to so we we need an agreement and that's what we have and it's worked very well for Canada how well Candice has in its trade its GDP is 26% we create 26% of our gross national product through trade and 20% of it is with the United States of America that's a huge deal our prosperity is linked to that great GDP number whereas in the United States they only have about 8 percent of their GDP to trade that supports what Trump is saying we export a lot less than Pete we import and only 2 percent of their GDP is R if Canada so they see it differently than we do I look at both sides and when I look at both sides I see where Trump is coming from and if you look at you know what would you do if you're an investor you'd say well I could set up anywhere in Canada or anywhere in the United States and I can access both markets that's what has been the position so Canada has benefited because we do have some advantages over United States on setting up businesses while we're losing that you've seen that we've lost those advantages certainly in the oil in the pipelines and this government is making money flee away from Canada now this trade discussion is in a uncertainty every month that goes by Ezra billions of dollars leave Canada because it's uncertain are we gonna do a deal why is the Prime Minister not interested why is he always on vacation not cementing this deal why is he not working for the interests of Canada and and this deal could have been done months ago but it's not and I know why it's not my theory and it's becoming fact is that there is a reason why the deals not done it is to promote this this this Liberal government strategy to create a war with Trump and unify under the flag and have people support Justin Trudeau and Canada that's what's going on and it's very clear and I have if you go through my Mike Twitter account I've pin and there are now 14 factual examples under that pin so there's a thread that shows evidentiary fact of why it was done this trade is done to delay intentionally for political purposes well we'll put underneath this video a link if people to help people find your Twitter account yeah and by the way I know exactly what you mean about the Liberals wanting to fight with Trump for their political benefit and both Gerald Butz the principal's secretary to Justin Trudeau and more recently Minister hi do the abilities the Labor Minister have made public statements to that effect will put their tweets on the screen right now right Gerald buts saying remember this when we're in election who's team who's for cabbing Bay basically demonizing anyone who would affiliate with Trump and minister Hyde you saying the same thing I think they want they actually want a fight so they can run against Donald Trump who they think domestically is unpopular they're willing to sack the deal to have Trump as an enemy I think that's voil√° reckless I read that tweet from Gerald Butz and I was so alarmed and to me it was a smoking gun of an admission that they want this trade the the data and that's that's also and you're gonna show it that's wonderful but the day that he tweeted that was when the NAFTA negotiations were at the worst and I asked I asked you and I asked every viewer who spikes the ball as Gerald dot buts did when the NAFTA Nagori negotiations were at its absolute worst he basically said look at us we wouldn't fold like a cheap tent like the Conservatives and then he says remember this in 2019 I mean if I had butts on the stand that would be a clear admission that the purpose of delaying NAFTA and trade and put in Canada and possible recession is for political advantage all right now I'm not the prime minister in the Prime Minister sorry Prime Minister Harper who may have said it sotto voce or may have said it suddenly I would say clearly it is my clear opinion that it's done intentionally right yeah that's what Stephen Harper said and I think he's right let me talk about an interesting development you mentioned and we all know that Justin Trudeau was insistent that NAFTA be a three-way deal and he was sort of trying to triangulate against Trump by a lying with his buddy the former President of Mexico but as you mentioned Mexico is a new leader and that new leader is quite hard left-wing yes according to media reports he's not quite Hugo Chavez left-wing but his very rambunctious left-wing so and and Trump for decades has been railing against Mexico and trade so you would think that between a hard left-wing Mexican president and Trump in and his history of poking back at Mexico those two guys would be a disaster to get but if Press reports are to be believed actually I think Trump tweeted this himself he's actually closer to a deal with this new Mexican president than he is with Canada and he's never had a quarrel with Canada before but Canada wants a court with him wouldn't it be shocking wouldn't it be terrifying mani if nafta evaporated but Trump actually did an art of the deal move with this Mexican leftist Trump does deals with anyone and everyone he's trying to do a deal with Kim jong-un in Korea he's trying to do deals with countries around the world wouldn't it be something if he got a deal with Mexico on his own and Trudeau in Canada were left hanging outside the tent we got a window into that Ezra we got it there was a brief report and again I tweeted it in part of my 14 tweet thread but I think like like steamer the trade negotiator for USA he actually said he was dumbfounded he was shocked because he thought he would have Canada at his side to demand that Mexico in the three-way trade deal have a minimum wage because they wanted to raise the minimum wage in Mexico in order to make a trade deal more equitable Canada was not at his side he couldn't understand he couldn't understand why is Canada not asking that Mexico have a minimum wage yet they're demanding United States to have unionized workers it didn't make sense to him it makes sense to be and that is to delay trade to to put monkey wrenches in every part of the negotiations in order to get the Trump hate boats in Canada I mean like how can Canada not stand for a higher minimum wage in Mexico that's who we are America is advancing that and Trudeau is not and there's a simple answer to that and that is more evidence in my view as to what this government's intent is with respect to trade deal and it's a it's a very frightening proposition and as I said before we have a lot more to lose than America and and and and Trudeau and I we think the Prime Minister Trudeau and others are taking advantage of that for political reasons we're talking with Manny Montenegrin no he's the president and CEO of think sharp and a long time lawyer as you can tell he's got the cross-examination skills many I want you ask you one last question I see a flicker of hope I saw a report that Canada is trying to get back into the negotiations so they say because they're concerned about Trump's public threats of tariffs on our auto sector 20% tariff apparently we selling a million cars more into the States than they sell you slap a 20% tariff on a on a Canadian car no Americans gonna buy that's just gonna kill the auto industry right there do you think that that the liberal members of parliament that represents those ridings in Ontario and I think there's a couple in Quebec that rely on the auto industry do you think those panicing local MPs who've got to be hearing from their auto worker constituencies do you think that's enough to push geryl butts away from the cliff to make almond Louise car veer off course are they gonna take us right off the clip Auto Workers be damned sure absolutely Auto Workers be damned and everything I've examined of this government and and yeah as well I can list it it all has to do with optics there is nothing of substance our government is walking into the NAFTA negotiations protecting seven industries we talked about the Milk Marketing Board in the agriculture industry let's put that aside there are there two other industries that I want to identify telecom now the telecom industry that's your cell phone Canada's cellphone bills are twice what they are in America and we're protecting that industry why and and if you circle around part of the telecom industry are the people that feed you the news it's in their financial interests to make Trump look by these senior financial interest it's in their financial interest never to mention that telecom is protected why is it protected and and so Trump sees seven industries Trump sees Canadian banks in America Royal Bank I mean the Royal Bank of Canada is answering many golf tournaments the Royal Bank of Canada is in America the all our banks are in America there are no banks in American banks in Canada Trump seizes Jaime I mean I traveled the Florida and I'm actually very proud to see our Canadian banks doing business there TD & TD Scotiabank their their that they're grabbing the consumers and grabbing the market share American banks are not allowed to do that Trump sees and says wait a minute why are telecoms why are your your agriculture industries your banks why are they allowed to be protected and he truly wants a free deal but we're not telling the story and that's the frustrating part Wow you know what I you're so right about they we don't we don't think about that in Canada we don't have access to American Mason and it would be good to have the competition I mean I'm sure there's some patriotic loyalty Canadians have but if we can get our you know better deal cheaper mortgages whatever better service why not that's very you know Manny you're always ahead of the curve here it's great to have an update with you I I just hope I mean you're rarely wrong Manny but I hope you're wrong on Jarrell I hope that Canadian interest will prevail because anyone who wants a trade war with America I'm sorry they're reckless and I think that's geryl butts and I I think he's running the show I don't even think Trudeau's running the show I think it's about flat without humanity yeah well III agree I am fearful that they will not and why say that when this trade war was when we retaliate and when Canada retaliated we retaliated with tariffs on Canada Day I mean that was such a again if I was cross-examining these people again why would you put tariffs two months late on Canada Day because it's for patriotic reasons so yeah and then what happened there's a couple of polls that came out that Trudeau got a bump he's got a bump in polls because of our patriotism for Canada and these we call the Canadian Canada Day tariffs it's working for them and because it's working for them they will not do what's in the best interest of Canada so Ezra sadly although I wish and pray and hope that they that they would wake up and smell the company coffee and save Canada they've now got enough enabling messages to continue to go on this path of economic destruction amazing well many it's a pleasure to talk with you underneath this video we're gonna have links not only to your Twitter
