12
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,092
BECAUSE IT IS NAMED AFTER HIM.

13
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,493
GOVERNOR, GREAT TO BE BACK.

00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:21,794

PROMISED TO PULL OFF, THIS ONE

20
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,336
DOES AND MOST OF THE COVERAGE

21
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:32,305
HOW COLD-HEARTED HAMAS WAS

22
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,173
TREATED AND PALESTINIANS WERE

23
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:35,174
TREATED IN GAZA?

24
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:38,278
>> HAMAS IS MASTERS OF

25
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:38,678
PROPAGANDA.

26
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,712
TOO BAD THEY'RE NOT REALLY

27
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:41,014
MASTERS OF TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE

28
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:42,282
OUT OF POVERTY.

29
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:43,816
IN FACT THEIR ACTIONS KEEP

30
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:44,684
PEOPLE IN POVERTY.

31
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:47,387
THAT IS THEIR GOAL, KEEP THEM

32
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,522
UNEDUCATED IMPOVERISHED AND

33
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:49,923
SUBSERVIENT.

34
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:50,957
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

35
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:52,926
I'VE BEEN TO THE GAZA BORDER

36
00:00:52,926 --> 00:00:53,626
MANY TIMES.

37
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:55,495
THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO BUILD

38
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:57,030
TUNNELS, GO UNDERGROUND, GET

39
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,465
INTO ISRAEL TO KILL ISRAELIS.

40
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,167
EVERY TIME THEY BUILD A TUNNEL

41
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,603
ON AVERAGE COST $3 MILLION.

42
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:04,771
ISRAELIS BLOW IT UP AND BLOCK

43
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,038
IT.

44
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:06,306
THAT IS THREE MILLION DOLLARS

45
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,473
COULD HAVE BEEN BUILT FOR

46
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:09,175
HOUSING PROVIDE, FOOD,

47
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:09,642
INFRASTRUCTURE.

48
00:01:09,642 --> 00:01:12,445
BUT IN GAZA IT'S AN ABSOLUTE

49
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:13,680
DISASTER AND THESE POOR PEOPLE,

50
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,847
AND IT IS HORRIFIC WHAT IS

51
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,283
HAPPENING TO THEM BUT HAPPENING

52
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,952
A THE HANDS OF HAMAS, BECAUSE

53
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,520
THEY ARE USING THEM AS HUMAN

54
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,853
SHIELDS.

55
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,488
THEY ARE EXPLOITING THEIR

56
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:23,823
POVERTY AND THEIR COMPLETE LACK

57
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:25,291
OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE

58
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,094
BEING USED FOR.

59
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:29,629
ABBY: WHAT WAS IT LIKE FOR YOU

60
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:30,196
TOCK THERE?

61
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:32,465
>> ONE OF THE MOSIEUR REAL

62
00:01:32,465 --> 00:01:32,799
MOMENTS.

63
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,735
I WAS GOING TO ISRAEL, THIS

64
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,036
MARKS 45th YEAR.

65
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:42,875
MY FIRST TRIP IN 1973 WHEN I WAS

66
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:43,276
17.

67
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:45,144
SEEING CEREMONY AND CURTAIN COME

68
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,246
DOWN AND LOOKING AT WORD EMBASSY

69
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:50,750
IN JERUSALEM, IT SENT CHILLS UP

70
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,684
MY SPINE.

71
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:53,886
IT WAS SOMETHING MANY OF US WERE

72
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:56,356
HOPING FOR, PRAYING FOR, WORKING

73
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:56,656
FOR.

74
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:59,058
THIS IS NOT SYMBOLIC.

75
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:00,226
THIS PRESIDENT DESERVES ALL THE

76
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:01,327
CREDIT, ALL THE CREDIT FOR

77
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,629
HAVING THE COURAGE TO DO WHAT

78
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,597
OTHER PRESIDENTS PROMISED BUT

79
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:05,465
DID NOT DELIVER.

80
00:02:05,465 --> 00:02:06,599
STEVE: MEANWHILE AS WE'RE

81
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,868
WRAPPING UP OUR SEGMENT WHAT WAS

82
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,536
GOING ON DURING YOUR VISIT, TALK

83
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:12,238
A LITTLE BIT WHAT IS COMING UP

84
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,907
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE.

85
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:16,409
SOUNDS LIKE THE 12th, THE

86
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,977
SUMMIT IS STILL ON BETWEEN THE

87
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:18,978
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

88
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,246
AND KIM JONG-UN ALTHOUGH

89
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:21,381
SUDDENLY HE IS KIND OF STIRRING

90
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,215
THE POT.

91
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,350
HE IS SAYING YOU KNOW, THESE

92
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,386
MILITARY EXERCISES, I DON'T LIKE

93
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:26,686
THOSE.

94
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:28,221
I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THEY'RE

95
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,355
SUGGESTING THAT I HAVE TO PULL

96
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,057
THE PLUG ON ALL THE NUKES.

97
00:02:31,057 --> 00:02:32,659
WHAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE

98
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,760
SCENES DO YOU THINK?

99
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,495
IS HE JUST TRYING TO CONTINUE TO

100
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:37,597
SAY, HEY, I'M OVER HERE, I'M

101
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:38,898
OVER HERE, LOOK AT ME?

102
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:42,568
>> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF IT IS

103
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,737
BRAVADO AND SABRE-RATTLING

104
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:46,139
NECESSARY FOR HIM TO ASSURE HIS

105
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,774
PEOPLE HE IS NOT SURRENDERING,

106
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,308
HE IS NOT GIVING UP EVERYTHING.

107
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:50,810
THAT HE IS GOING INTO IT WITH A

108
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,278
SENSE OF STRENGTH BUT ALL THAT

109
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,246
POSTURING DOESN'T CHANGE THE

110
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:55,014
FACT HE HAS BEEN WILLING AND

111
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:57,350
SAID PUBLICLY TO COMPLETELY GET

112
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,818
RID OF NUCLEAR ARMS.

113
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:02,088
IF THAT INDEED HAPPENS, IT IS AN

114
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:04,390
AMAZING RESET OF ALL OF ASIA.

115
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,459
AND THERE IS NO GUARRANTY AND

116
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,761
NOBODY IS BEING SO POLLYANNISH

117
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,030
ABOUT IT OH, TO SAY IT IS ALL

118
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,765
GOING TO BE FINE, BECAUSE IT MAY

119
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:13,032
NOT.

120
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:16,169
IT MAY FALL APART, AGAIN GIVE

121
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,270
DONALD TRUMP CREDIT FOR GETTING

122
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,571
US CLOSER THAN ANY PRESIDENT

123
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:19,972
EVER HAS IN DEALING WITH THE

124
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,841
SITUATION ON THE PENINSULA.

125
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:23,142
WHEN EVERYBODY WAS CONDEMNING

126
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,611
HIM FOR HIS TOUGH TALK, TURNS

127
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:26,679
OUT IT WORKED.

128
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,281
HE HAD THE RIGHT INSTINCTS.

129
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,816
HE HAS GOT THE RIGHT POLICIES.

130
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:32,218
ABBY: GOVERNOR, NOT ONLY IS THE

131
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:33,853
PRESIDENT NOT GIVEN CREDIT BY

132
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:36,189
CERTAIN FOLKS IN THE MEDIA, SOME

133
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,490
ARE ALREADY ASKING THE QUESTION

134
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,758
IF THE MEETING DOESN'T TAKE

135
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,760
PLACE, IS THAT A FAILURE ON THE

136
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,461
PRESIDENT'S PART.

137
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,895
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU AS WHERE

138
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,598
WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, WE CAN'T AT

139
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:46,733
LEAST COME TOGETHER WANTING

140
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:47,700
SUCCESS FOR NORTH KOREA?

141
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,869
THAT IS NOT JUST GOOD FOR US AND

142
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:51,337
PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA, IT IS

143
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:52,672
GOOD FOR THE WORLD.

144
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:54,373
>> IT IS INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR THE

145
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,007
WORLD.

146
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,109
ABBY, ONE OF THE THINGS

147
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,410
FRUSTRATING TO THE WATCH PEOPLE

148
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,378
ON THE LEFT SEEM TO HATE

149
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:00,480
DONALD TRUMP MORE THAN THEY LOVE

150
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,248
THE COUNTRY AND LOVE PEACE THAT

151
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,649
THIS WORLD DESPERATELY NEEDS.

152
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,518
THEY SHOULD BE GRATEFUL IF

153
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:06,519
DONALD TRUMP CAN BRING SOME TYPE

154
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,321
OF A RESOLUTION, THEY NEED TO BE

155
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,489
GLAD THAT HE DID IT.

156
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,758
IF THEY DON'T LIKE HIM THAT'S

157
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:12,058
FINE.

158
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,459
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HIM BUT

159
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:14,994
NEED TO APPRECIATE WHAT HE IS

160
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,661
GETTING DONE WHICH BY THE WAY IS

161
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:17,196
QUITE A BIT.

162
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,898
BRIAN: IT IS.

163
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:20,833
ALSO A ARE A COUPLE DOZEN JUDGES

164
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,568

22 OVERALL.

167
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:27,140
HE IS PRESSURING THE REPUBLICAN

168
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,541
SENATORS TO DO MORE BEFORE THEY

169
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,408
GO ON BREAK.

170
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:31,110
WE'RE BEGINNING TO REALIZE IT IS

171
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,812
UP TO MITCH McCONNELL TO START

172
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:36,749
GETTING THESE PEOPLE NOMINATED

173
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:37,216

174
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,584
SOME WITHOUT ANY CONTROVERSY.

175
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,052
THEY'RE BEING HELD UP BY

176
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:40,419
DEMOCRATS.

177
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,621
DO YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS,

178
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,356
YOU KNOW POLITICIANS, DO YOU

179
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:44,724
THINK THEY'RE GETTING THE

180
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:45,057
MESSAGE?

181
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,292
>> WELL IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL

182
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:47,160
BE GOING HOME.

183
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,029
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS GO AHEAD

184
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,131
ROLL THE NOMINATIONS THROUGH,

185
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:56,869
GET APPOINTMENTS FILLED, NOT

00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:58,504
AGENCIES.

188
00:04:58,504 --> 00:04:59,705
THERE ARE SO MANY UNPLUGGED

189
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:00,540
HOLES RIGHT NOW.

190
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,941
I HEARD SOME SENATORS SAY THEY

191
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:03,676
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM WORK ON

192
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:04,677
THE WEEKEND AND WORK OVERTIME.

193
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:05,378
BRIAN: WHY NOT?

194
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,513
>> THAT IS WHAT EVERY ONE ELSE

195
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:08,915
DOES WHEN THEIR JOB ISN'T DONE

196
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,850
ON TIME AND ON SCHEDULE AND

197
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,217
DEADLINE.

198
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,553
WHY NOT SENATORS DO WHAT EVERY

199
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,154
OTHER AMERICAN HAS TO DO, GET

200
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:16,689
THE JOB DONE BEFORE THEY GO HOME

201
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:17,890
TO TAKE A VACATION.

202
00:05:17,890 --> 00:00:00,000
STEVE: WE'LL SEE WHAT THEY DO.
