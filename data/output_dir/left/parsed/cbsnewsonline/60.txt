.
17 YEARS AGO, YOUR LOVED ONES
WERE AMONG THE 40 OF FLIGHT 93,
THE 40 PASSENGERS ANDREW MEMBERS
ON BOARD 8:00 A.M.
UNITED FLIGHT
FROM NEWARK TO SAN FRANCISCO.
THERE WERE MEN AND WOMEN FROM
EVERY BACKGROUND.
THEY WERE YOUNG PEOPLE RETURNING
FROM VISITING FAMILY.
MOMS AND DADS ON BUSINESS TRIPS
AND FRIENDS GOING AND COMING
FROM BIRTHDAYS AND WEDDINGS.
THEY BOARDED THE PLANE AS
STRANGERS AND THEY ENTERED
ETERNITY LINKED FOREVER AS TRUE
HEROES.
.
SOON AFTER TAKE OFF, FLIGHT 93
WAS HIGH JACKED BY EVIL MEN BENT
ON TERROR AND CONQUEST.
PASSENGERS AND CREW MEMBERS
BEGAN USING THEIR PHONES TO CALL
HOME.
THEY LEARNED THAT TWO PLANES HAD
ALREADY CRASHED INTO THE WORLD
TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY.
IMMEDIATELY, THOSE ON BOARD
FLIGHT 93 STARTED PLANNING A
RESPONSE.
SANDY BRADSHAW, A FLIGHT
ATTENDANT CALLED HER HUSBAND AND
TOLD HIM THEY WERE IN THE BACK
OF THE PLANE PREPARING HOT WATER
TO THROW ON TO THE HIJACKERS.
PASSENGER JEREMY GLICH EXPLAINED
THE PAN PLAN TO HIS WIFE AND
SAID
STAY ON THE LINE, I'LL BE BACK.
THE PASSENGERS AND CREW MEMBERS
CAME TOGETHER, TOOK A VOTE, AND
THEY DECIDED TO ACT.
AT THAT MOMENT, THEY TOOK THEIR
FATE AND AMERICA'S FATE BACK
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS IN THE LAST
20 MINUTES, MANY PLACED THEIR
FINAL CALLS HOME.
WE'RE SPREADING THOSE ETERNAL
WORDS, I LOVE YOU.
SOME SAID THE LORD'S PRAYER AND
THEN THEY BRAVELY CHARGED THE
COP.
THEY ATTACKED THE ENEMY.
THEY FOUGHT UNTIL THE VERY END
AND THEY STOPPED THE FORCES OF
TERROR AND DEFEATED THIS WICKED,
HORRIBLE, EVIL PLAN.
FLIGHT 93 CRASHED YARDS FROM
WHERE WE STAND JUST 20 MINUTES
FLYING TIME FROM THE UNITED
STATES CAPITAL THROUGH THEIR
SACRIFICE, THE 40 SAVED THE
LIVES OF COUNTLESS AMERICANS AND
THEY SAVED OUR CAPTAIN FROM A
DEVASTATING STRIKE.
IN THE DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK,
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE OFFICERS,
AND RECOVERY WORKERS TRAVELED TO
NEW YORK AND ARLINGTON TO CRAWL
THROUGH THE RUBBLE AND SEARCH
FOR SURVIVORS.
THERE WERE PRAYER VIGILS,
MEMORIALS, AND CHARITY DRIVES
ALL ACROSS OUR NATION.
HERE IN SHANKSVILLE, MANY OF YOU
RAISED UP THE FIRST MEMORIAL, A
WOODEN CROSS, A CHAIN-LINKED
FENCE, MEMENTOES AND TRIBUTES
POURING IN AND DOZENS AND DOZENS
OF AMERICAN FLAGS, A PIECE OF
AMERICA'S HEART IS BURIED ON
THESE GROUNDS BUT HAS GROWN A
NEW RESOLVE TO LIVE OUR LIVES
WITH THE SAME GRACE AND COURAGE
AS THE HEROES OF FLIGHT 93.
THIS FIELD IS A MONUMENT TO
AMERICAN DEFIANCE.
THIS MEMORIAL IS NOW A MESSAGE
TO THE WORLD.
AMERICA WILL NEVER, EVER SUBMIT
TIRENY.
.
SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th, NEARLY
5.5 MILLION OF AMERICANS
ENLISTED IN THE ARMED FORCES AND
7,000 SERVICE MEMBERS DIED
FACING DOWN THOSE OF ISLAMIC
TERRORISM.
TODAY WE THINK OF THE MORE THAN
200,000 SERVICE MEMBERS NOW
SERVING OVERSEAS AND WE THINK OF
EVERY CITIZEN WHO PROTECTS OUR
NATION AT HOME, INCLUDING OUR
STATE, LOCAL, AND FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
THESE ARE GREAT AMERICNS.
THESE ARE GREAT HEROES.
WE HONOR AND THANK THEM ALL.
.
.
AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I WILL
ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER
TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM
STRIKING AMERICAN SOIL.
HERE WITH US TODAY IS DOROTHY
GARCIA BLOCKNER.
HER HUSBAND, SONNY, WAS ONE OF
THE PASSENGERS ON FLIGHT 93.
ON SEPTEMBER 11th, 2001, MONTHS
AFTER THEIR 32nd WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY, SONNY WAS ON HIS
WAY BACK FROM A BUSINESS
MEETING.
HE CALLED DOROTHY, WHO HE LOVES
SO MUCH, CALLED HER ON THE PLANE
AND UTTERED HER NAME BEFORE THE
LINE WENT DEAD SILENT.
IN THE DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK,
DOROTHY TOLD THE INVESTIGATORS
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING SHE
WANTED FROM THIS FIELD, HER
HUSBAND'S WEDDING RING.
THEY WOULD KNOW IT BY THE
INSCRIPTION ETCHED INSIDE.
"ALL MY LOVE" FOLLOWED BY THE
NUMBER 8/2/69, THE DATE OF THEIR
ANNIVERSARY.
THE OFFICERS, GREAT PEOPLE,
PROMISED TO TRY BUT IN THIS
FIELD OF WRECKAGE, IT SEEMED
CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE.
DOROTHY BEGAN TO PRAY AND SHE
ASKED HER FRIENDS TO DO THE
SAME.
DAYS WENT BY, THEN MONTHS.
STILL NO RING.
A WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS, ON
DECEMBER 19th, SHE HEARD A KNOCK
AT THE DOOR.
TWO OFFICERS WERE STANDING WITH
A REALLY BEAUTIFUL -- TO HER SHE
THOUGHT IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL SHE
KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
A BEAUTIFUL, SMALL, WHITE BOX.
INSIDE IT WAS A WALLET, A
LUGGAGE TAG, A DRIVER'S LICENSE,
A SMALL BAG WITH THE WEDDING
RING INSCRIBED WITH THOSE THREE
PRECIOUS WORDS "ALL MY LOVE."
THOSE WORDS ECHO ACROSS THIS
FIELD AND THOSE WORDS TELL THE
STORY OF 40 MEN AND WOMEN WHO
GAVE ALL THEIR LOVE FOR THEIR
FAMILIES, THEIR COUNTRY, AND OUR
FREEDOM.
TO DOROTHY AND TO EVERY FAMILY
HERE TODAY, AMERICA WILL NEVER
FORGET WHAT YOUR LOVED ONES DID
FOR ALL OF US.
.
THANK YOU EARLIER THIS WEEK, YOU
DEDICATED THE FINAL PART OF THIS
MEMORIAL, THE TOWER OF VOICES.
STANDING AT 93 FEET TALL, THE
TOWER OF VOICES IS NOW THE FIRST
STRUCTURE VISITORS SEE WHEN THEY
COME TO THIS NOW-SACRED GROUND.
IT WILL HOLD 40 BEAUTIFUL CHIMES
THAT RING THROUGHOUT THESE
FIELDS, EACH A UNIQUE NOTE BUT
ALL IN PERFECT HARMONY.
EACH TIME WE HEAR THOSE CHIMES
PLAYING IN THE WIND, WE WILL
REMEMBER THE 40.
WE WILL REMEMBER THEIR FACES,
THEIR VOICES, THEIR STORIES,
THEIR COURAGE, AND THEIR LOVE.
AND WE WILL REMEMBER THAT FREE
PEOPLE ARE NEVER AT THE MERCY OF
EVIL, BECAUSE OUR DESTINY IS
ALWAYS IN OUR HANDS.
.
AMERICA'S FUTURE IS NOT WRITTEN
BY OUR ENEMIES.
AMERICA'S FUTURE IS WRITTEN BY
OUR HEROES.
.
AS LONG AS THIS MONUMENT STANDS,
AS LONG AS THIS MEMORIAL
ENDURES, BRAVE PATRIOTS WILL
RISE UP IN AMERICA'S HOURS OF
NEED AND THEY, TOO, WILL FIGHT
BACK.
.
>> 17 YEARS AGO, 40 INCREDIBLE
MEN AND WOMEN SHOWED THE WHOLE
WORLD THAT NO FORCE ON EARTH
WILL EVER CONQUER THE AMERICAN
SPIRIT.
WE TREASURE THEIR MEMORY, WE
CHERISH THEIR LEGACY, AND WE ASK
GOD TO FOREVER BLESS THE
IMMORTAL HEROES OF FLIGHT 93.
THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU, GOD
BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
.
