swamp captain Mitch McConnell has created millions of jobs for China people while doing so Mitch has gotten rich in fact this China family has given them tens of millions of dollars Mitch's swamp people are now running false negative ads against me they are also childishly calling me despicable and mentally ill the war to drain the swamp and create jobs for West Virginia people has begun that will meet Joe Manchin and ditch cocaine Mitch for the sake of the kids well what the former coal bird after serving prison time for his role in a mine disaster that killed 29 people well if you're Don Blankenship you're running for US Senate and you do it by attacking your own party Senate Leader Mitch McConnell by accusing him of getting rich by helping his quote China family a reference to McConnell's wife transportation secretary Layne chat who is Chinese American and that cocaine Mitch line refers to the time a cargo ship owned by Chows family's company was reportedly caught transporting ninety pounds of cocaine but there's no evidence of any connection between that incident and McConnell or his wife McConnell has refused to comment directly but his office pointed NBC News to a comment by his former chief of staff quote this clown is a walking talking case for the study of the limitations of a person's a bit of prisons ability to rehabilitate he's a walking talking case study for prisons and ability to rehabilitate Joe Karina Maher back King John Dawson now join Republican strategist for mercury public affairs we always like to give Kate in the challenging cases to talk about Kate let me play the China person thing was weird and and it's one of those things where he could have maybe just misspoken and he didn't he just said it and it just tumbled out wrong but he's actually doubled down on it our our own ally Vitale and he sees Ali beat Ali asked him about China person and here is what he said I'm a West Virginia person during the NBC person in order to have a racist statement you have to mention a race or derogatory comment about a racial and then he tells roll call this is his quote - roll call why they add the China personally isn't racist we're confused on our staff as to how it can be racist when there's no mention of a race there's no race races are negro a grow white caucasian that sounds like double white caucasian hispanic asian there's no mention of a race I've never used a race word I don't understand this candidacy Caitlyn I don't understand any of that why is he still viable he's viable because he has a lot of money this is a guy who this ago funded 40 candidates Republican candidates trying to win Statehouse seats in West Virginia so it's a little reminiscence of the Alabama spectacle what I'll tell you is I mean where the guys made a tactical mistake is at first getting in the race second of all is going after Mitch McConnell who probably has 2% name ID in a Republican primary in West Virginia so you have to educate people who he really is right and second of all anybody that wants to punch Mitch McConnell in the gut is making a mistake that guy is tactically smart good at what he does and understands how to to take somebody down out of a race the best he can so I have all the respect for Majority Leader McConnell and at the end of the day I looked and called into western Virginia yesterday joy and got a sense of the race and Joe Manchin has been in the Statehouse the state Senate has been the Secretary of State has been governor most of those all won by double digits is one of the last of a dying breed of what I would call a moderate to conservative Democrat in Washington so thinking that that's a race where we're going to spend a lot of money is probably not tactically smart this is a guy that worries me if he decides to run on the Democratic ticket for president that's how serious I take Joe Manchin Wow then you know and Katy would know I mean he understands these races a lot but Kareem you know it's interesting to me so this is a poll from a few weeks ago that showed Evan Jenkins who's a congressman from West Virginia and Patrick Morrissey who is the current Attorney General sort of neck-and-neck within the margin of error about four points Parton Joe Manchin behind you know and this may be really cynical of me to ask this question but all the China persons stuff and all that I mean despite the fact that he was he owned the mine where those 29 men died so I don't know that I'm not convinced I hate to say it that this gambit doesn't bring him up in the polls is that too cynical no I don't think that's that's cynical at all I mean we have Donald Trump I mean that tells you everything that you need to know and the reason why Blankenship exists is because we have Donald Trump right right Trump has changed the political spectrum on who can run and not run and and the folks that we thought could not run it's not running I mean the reason why you have Aurora more the reason why you have a Trump is because of Trump's comments and policies and what he's turned the Republican Party into and so now they feel really comfortable to come out these races bigoted people and be like yeah I want to run for the nomination from the GOP because look at Donald Trump and one more thing it is very difficult to make Mitch McConnell to a sympathetic figure and Blankenship is clearly making that happen because that is just insane right he's going in for the man's wife you know Joe and you you've studied southern politics you obviously studied Bill Clinton it there are tactics that work you know whether we like it or not right Donald Trump just double down today on Mexicans or rapist then these countries are not sending they're worse because at a certain part of sort of the limbic brain people are tribal and it kind of works right but the other thing we know works is Obama it used to be Clinton it used to be Clinton Clinton Clinton ounce Obama Don Blankenship put out an ad literally saying that President Obama is who put him in prison let's take a listen did you know Don Blankenship style was not about the mine explosion really you sure oh yeah the Obama judge wouldn't even let Don mention the explosion and the Obama prosecutors knew Don had nothing to do with the explosion Obama prosecutors tried to put Blankenship in prison for life over a letter he didn't even write the Obama team couldn't get one Virginia juror to find Don guilty of any of the felony charges 36 votes for Don zero for Obama and can you put up this in February producers put up this manifesto it's a pamphlet like 25 pages of Don Blankenship calling himself an American political prisoner yeah basically you the political prisoner it's really hard to know what to say about this joy listen the it's absolutely correct that Trump has lowered the bar for Republican candidates so far in terms of the ability to express bigotry you know what they say as well we are politically incorrect we're speaking our minds there's a reason why in this country we spent decades making it difficult for people to say the worst things they could possibly say about each other and making them pay a political price for that and the fact that now somebody like Don Blankenship a convicted criminal who was responsible for those mine deaths thinks that he can use an anti Asian slurring that that will get him votes is a very bad thing no and I think I mean I actually think that he's a he's low he's a low energy Trump but I from just listening to the panel and witnessing what he just said not only about Chinese Americans but also what he's talking about our government and court institutions he's actually really going in and taking a page from the Trump playbook he's basically really talking about trade for these folks he's talking about coal he's talking about trade when he saw that and that and that is what people are hearing when they say when he hears China man they're saying oh these are people that basically want to come in and take away my jobs yeah when he starts talking about Obama and government and courts he is feeding into the right idea that you can't get a fair fair a fair day in court that all of a sudden our court systems our prosecuting systems are completely tainted when it comes to a fair trial and that is a slippery but dangerous and there is a section of Americans that are increasingly believing in that because that they are in an echo chamber a media echo chamber where that is all they're hearing and he is reinforcing that so while I think he's definitely goofy as he racist yes but the narrative that he's playing is actually something that we have to be very cautious about because we're going to start seeing it more and more and that's you know III have to say I agree with it I think that Democrats who are high fiving and hoping that Don Blankenship is the nominee well I agree with you Kaden that I think Joe Manchin is one of the strongest incumbents the Democrats have in terms of you knows that state and he knows his voters and he knows how to win but you know Don Blankenship in a sense I mean this is I'll actually you'll mashup up some voters and these are voters talking about Don Blankenship one of them is related to one of the coal miners who died in that mine disaster for which Blankenship ultimately wound up spending some jail time one of the 29 coal miners that died in the explosion was my brother and I'm one of quite a few family members that support him the other of the fake news that we don't support him that is not true I'm definitely supporting Don Blankenship right now one of the major reasons is because as coal background you know this coal country explain this to us for please Katyn because you have people even people who are related to some of those miners who died in that tragic accident saying you know what Don Blankenship is a coal man that's all we care about well it makes sense to me about when they're totally I see the interview and your heart goes out to the lady whose brother died if you've ever worked in West Virginia it's a beautiful state it's it's coal driven the economies especially in rural West Virginia or colon and Blankenship is one of the largest coal companies and CEOs and he's also been a tremendous supporter of the Republican Party in West Virginia so they knowing that in turn he hadn't been on the ballot you got the Attorney General who's pretty popular you're gonna come up against another guy who's won our percent for cold Joe Manchin so that will inoculate that but I understand some that remember in Republican primaries and both Democratic primaries eleven to fourteen percent of the available voters is who's going to pick your nominees that is a small universe in a turn out season that we're going to have because there's no presidential contest on the ballot so anything can happen but I'm gonna lay my odds on the Attorney General winning that primary I'm gonna also lay odds on a lot of money between now and Election Day is gonna be spent trying to help Don Blankenship win because that is another gift to the Democratic Party in November but again I'm Elaine mods and the representative is well-liked in his district so we'll see stranger stranger things have happened say Alabama there we go again strange things just happening they just keep happening Kate and make it stop Joe cada Centurion Joe fear Maria Teresa Kumar Kate and Dawson great panel thank you guys very much and up next Trump's former
