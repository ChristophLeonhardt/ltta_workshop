♪ ♪ Laura: IMMIGRATION CRISIS MIGHT BE BREWING FOR HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN AND HIS HEADERSHIP TEAM. THE HOUSE IS JUST 5 GOP VOTES AWAY FROM BRINGING SEVERAL DIFFERENT DACA BILLS TO THE FLOOR TO GO AROUND HOUSE LEADERSHIP. GOP LEADERS FEAR THIS COULD COST THE PARTY CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. HERE IS REPUBLICAN JEFF DENHAM WHO SUPPORTS THE MANEUVER AND REPUBLICAN SEAN DUFFY WHO OPPOSES IT. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. WE WILL GET INTO THE TRICKS, QUEEN OF THE HILL AND DISCHARGE PETITION, WE WILL LOSE THE AUDIENCE. CONGRESSMAN YOU ARE IN FAVOR OF TURNING THE HOUSE FLOOR OVER TO NANCY PELOSI TO DEBATE THIS? NO, NOT AT ALL. Laura: BUT TURN THE DEBATE OVER TO THE DEMOCRATS? NO, NOT AT ALL. WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. WE CONTROL ALL OF THE RULES. PAUL RYAN HAS HIS OWN BILL. THE PRESIDENT HAS A BILL. YES, THE DEMOCRATS GET A BILL TOO. WE WILL DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM BORDER SECURITY. WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER EVERY YEAR THAT GOES BY, ANOTHER HALF MILLION PEOPLE COME ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER. THE 8 YEARS SEAN AND I HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE TOGETHER THAT'S 4 MILLION PEOPLE FROM DOING NOTHING. Laura: LOOK AT SEAN DUFFY, HE IS PRACTICALLY BUILDING THE WALL HIMSELF. WHAT IS GOING ON? I DON'T LIKE THE TACTIC. JEFF KNOWS THAT. I THINK THIS TURNS THE FLOOR OVER TO WHAT IS CALLED THE QUEEN OF THE HILL. YOU PUT UP FOUR BILLS, THE ONE THAT GETS THE MAJORITY PASSES. WE HAVE A WIDE AGREEMENT ON TRUMP'S 4 PILLARS. THAT WILL PASS. JEFF WILL VOTE FOR THAT. THE FREEMEN FREEDOM CAUCUS WILL VOTE FOR THAT. Laura: YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE FARMERS AND THE WORKERS. YOU HAVE TO STOP CHAIN MIGRATION. THAT'S A MASS MULTIPLIER OF IMMIGRATION INTO THE UNITED STATES WITH DISTANT RELATIVES COMING INTO THE COUNTRY WITHOUT MERIT. CHAIN MIGRATION AND BUILD THE WALL AND REFORM THE ASYLUM PROCESS. THAT'S ALL IN THE BILL. YOU DON'T NEED FOUR BILLS. WE DON'T HAVE THE BALLS FOR THAT BILL. DONALD TRUMP SAID I WANT TO BUILD A WALL. LET'S COME TOGETHER FOR 25 BILLION DOLLARS AND BUILD THE WALL AND MAKE OTHER TWEAKS. WE WILL DEAL WITH DACA. THAT'S A PACKAGE THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS. IT'S GENEROUS FOR THE DACA KIDS BUT GIVES US BORDER SECURITY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE SENATE. I CAN'T SUPPORT THE GOOD LAT BILL. Laura: WHY? I DIDN'T SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. I THOUGHT IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. JUST DOING AN EXTENSION OF OBAMA'S POLICY 3 YEARS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WE NEED TO FIX THE WALL AND FIX SOME PROBLEMS AND HAVE A PERMANENT FIX. Laura: YOU DON'T WANT TO BUILD THE WALL? ABSOLUTELY I DO. Laura: THE WHOLE WALL? YES, OF COURSE. Laura: THE ONLY PROBLEM YOU HAVE IS WITH THE AMNESTY OF 800,000? PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. Laura: OBAMA DIDN'T DEAL WITH CHAIN MIGRATION. CHAIN MIGRATION YOU CHANGE THE GAME WITH IMMIGRATION. BUT HE CHANGED THE DYNAMIC FOR KIDS THAT GO TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL UNCONSTITUTIONAL HE. IF WE ARE GOING TO FIX THIS. IT'S AN AMERICAN PEOPLE. Laura: THIS WILL DIVIDE THE PARTY BEFORE THE MID-TERM ELECTION. THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING FOR. Laura: HE WANTS THE END OF CHAIN MIGRATION AND WANTS THE WALL BUILD AND TO END THE VISA LOTTERY. HE SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS DONE, HE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THE CR. THE PROBLEM WITH THE DACA KIDS, IF YOU DON'T END CHAIN MIGRATION, THE KIDS AND THE PARENTS WHO BROUGHT THEM IN GET LEGAL STATUS. Laura: THE PARENTS ARE ALL STAYING. LET'S BE HONEST. WE HAVE TO FIX THAT PART WITH DACA. Laura: DONALD TRUMP DID NOT WIN ON GIVING AMNESTY TO THE DACA KIDS. HE WON ON BORDER SECURITY. BUILDING A WALL AND EVEN CALIFORNIA THE MAJORITY WANT DEPORTATION TO GO ON. THE BERKELEY POLL IS DEVASTATING. 59% SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO START DEPORTING THESE PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT PUT THE DEMOCRATS ON NOTICE. THE DEMOCRATS HAD 42 BILLION OUT OF EVERY DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE. PUT THEM TO THE TEST ON THIS ISSUE. AS WE REPUBLICANS WE DON'T WANT TO TURN THIS OVER TO THE NANCY PELOSI. I DON'T THINK WE WILL LOSE IN THE HOUSE. LET'S GET A FAMILY SOLUTION. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PROCESS.
