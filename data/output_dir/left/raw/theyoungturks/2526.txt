00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,070
keep in mind this was over a suspended

lose their life<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a suspended license</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there's that part of</font>

58
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,090
the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have more damning evidence</font>

59
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,830
against the sheriff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in just a moment but</font>

60
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,600
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to open it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the panel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,950
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna make one point I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

62
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,810
it's an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you that</font>

63
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
you hint at here which is that

64
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes when cops address the issue</font>

65
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,760
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> using deadly force its if this person</font>

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're pursuing is a</font>

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,150
threat to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community I mean if it</font>

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,100
were like a heavily populated area<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,050
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving recklessly and very fast</font>

70
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,240
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it would still be something</font>

71
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they would likely be quite hesitant</font>

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do but at least then they could wrap</font>

73
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,700
their head around the logic of using

74
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,220
deadly force<font color="#CCCCCC"> but as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna says slow speed</font>

76
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">road it amounts to an execution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he</font>

77
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,209
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent any threat to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

78
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">community and keep in mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the</font>

79
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,680
sheriff<font color="#E5E5E5"> ordered the cops to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

out by any means necessary

81
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what you're about to hear is even</font>

82
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,730
worse because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sheriff apparently</font>

83
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,380
thinks hey you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

84

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the kind of</font>

stuff I live for okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's take a look</font>

86
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:19,350
at the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> video the cop by the way is</font>

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,899
distraught<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shooting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> occurred</font>

88
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,850
and the sheriff basically tries to calm

89
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,680
him down<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close attention to what he</font>
