>> Shannon: EDWARD LAWRENCE,

6
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,858
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:09,761
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, BUT

8
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,062
BIG-TIME DEMOCRATS SAY THEY'RE

9
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:13,364
OPEN TO BACKING ELIZABETH WARREN

10
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,233
WHO SAID THE PRESIDENT'S

11
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,436
ECONOMIC STRATEGY IS ALL WRONG.

12
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,137
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" RUNNING

13
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:21,072
HEADLINES LIKE THIS, YES, I'M A

SOCIALIST, WHY CANDIDATES ARE

15
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:27,111
EMBRACING THE LABEL IN 2018.

00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:30,448
SOME CALL IT THE TRUMP ECONOMIC

17
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:30,882
BUMP.

DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST DAVE BROWN

19

PRESIDENT TRUMP MARK LAUDER.

21
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:38,790
LET'S GO OVER A LITTLE BIT OF

22
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,558
WHAT WE HEARD THIS MORNING IN

23
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,560
THE JOBS REPORT.

24
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,896
223,000 JOBS ADDED, 3.8% IS

25
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,464
WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS, LOWEST

26
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,499
SINCE 1969.

27
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,169
THERE WAS ONE IN APRIL OF 2000.

28
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:52,336
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, UNEMPLOYMENT

29
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,871
IS DOWN TO 5.9%, THE LOWEST IN

30
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:57,708
HISTORY.

31
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,243
WHAT DO DEMOCRATS DO WITH THAT?

32
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:01,279
>> THIS IS THE ECONOMY THAT

33
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:01,813
BARACK OBAMA BUILT.

34
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,215
WE'RE IN OUR NINTH YEAR OF

35
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,452
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXPANSION.

36
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:08,419
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW HE'S NOT

37
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,353
GOING TO --

38
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:11,089
>> LET ME FINISH MY POINT.

39
00:01:11,089 --> 00:01:12,657
THIS IS OBAMA'S LEGACY.

40
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:15,226
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS

41
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,227
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT

42
00:01:16,227 --> 00:01:18,096
THESE JOB NUMBERS ARE FANTASTIC,

43
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:18,930
REPUBLICAN POLL NUMBERS ARE

44
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,064
STILL IN THE MUD.

45
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,400
DEMOCRATS ARE LEADING ON THE

46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,201
GENERIC BALLOT.

47
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:24,502
>> Shannon: BUT THAT'S REALLY

48
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:24,969
TIGHTENED UP.

49
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,205
>> BUT LOOK AT THE SPECIAL

50
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,139
ELECTIONS, SINCE TRUMP TOOK

51
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:29,307
OFFICE, DEMOCRATS HAVE

52
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:30,775
OUTPERFORMED ON AN AVERAGE OF

53
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,910
NINE POINTS ACROSS THE SPECIAL

54
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,277
ELECTIONS.

55
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,479
IF THAT IS OUR PERFORMANCE IN

56
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,347
THE MIDTERMS, WE RETAKE THE

57
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:39,083
HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

58
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,618
>> IT WAS 13 POINTS AT THE

59
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,153
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, NOW THREE

60
00:01:42,153 --> 00:01:43,654
POINTS ACCORDING TO THE CLEAR

61
00:01:43,654 --> 00:01:44,222
POLITICS AVERAGE.

62
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:45,256
THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF THE

63
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:49,660
COUNTRY NUMBER IS NOW EIGHT

64
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,628
POINTS HIGHER WHEN PRESIDENT

65
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:51,829
OBAMA LEFT OFFICE, AND SIMILAR

66
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,664
TO THE NUMBERS IN 2012.

67
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,099
REPUBLICANS ARE SITTING WELL.

68
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,834
AND THIS COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE

69
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:57,668
HAVE MORE JOBS.

70
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:59,103
THEY HAVE MORE MONEY IN THEIR

71
00:01:59,103 --> 00:01:59,604
POCKETS.

72
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:01,405
AND DEMOCRATS OPPOSED THE THINGS

73
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:02,907
THAT HAVE JUMP STARTED THIS

74
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:03,241
ECONOMY.

75
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,575
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

76
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,845
JOBS CREATED THIS YEAR, ON

77
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:08,679
AVERAGE, WE ARE OUTPACING JOB

78
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,615
GROWTH FROM 2016, AND 2017.

79
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,450
THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT

80
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,951
CALLED ROCKET FUEL, PUTTING IT

81
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,685
IN THE ECONOMY.

82
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,187
>> Shannon: "THE NEW YORK

83
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:17,155
TIMES," YOU READ WHAT THEY HAD

84
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:19,257
TO SAY TODAY, THEY WERE USING

85
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,459
WORDS LIKE SPLENDID AND

86
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:21,826
EXCELLENT.

87
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:22,527
EMPLOYERS ARE LEADING MORE

88
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:24,028
PEOPLE TO WORK, AND FEWER PEOPLE

89
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:29,567
TO BE UNEMPLOYED AND LEADING

90
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,235
WAGES TO RISE.

91
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,770
>> THEY HAD A GOOD TIME AT THE

92
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,905
SOURCE THIS MORNING.

93
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,506
MARK MADE A POINT THAT IS VERY

94
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:36,007
IMPORTANT.

95
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,408
HE SAID PEOPLE FEEL BETTER WHEN

96
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,709
THEY HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKET.

97
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,311
THE REALITY IS VOTERS AREN'T

98
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,980
GOING TO VOTE ON THE BASIS OF

99
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,282
WHAT A JOBS REPORT SAYS.

100
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:45,616
IT'S JUST NUMBER.

101
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,951
THEY'LL VOTE BASED ON THEIR

102
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,519
ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, AND HOW

103
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,088
THEY FEEL FOR THEIR FAMILY.

104
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,458
40% OF AMERICANS TODAY COULDN'T

105
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,693
AFFORD AN EMERGENCY THAT COST

106
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:56,527
THEM $400.

107
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,795
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CASH.

108
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:02,099
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE

109
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,134
MEDIAN SAVINGS PER WORKING

110
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,036
FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY, IT'S

111
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:05,369
$5,000.

112
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,838
SO THERE'S A LOT OF INCREDIBLE

113
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:08,706
ECONOMIC INSECURITY.

114
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,409
IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN -- TAKE WAGE

115
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:11,742
GROWTH.

116
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:12,410
WE SAW A SLIGHT BUMP IN THE

117
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,013
NUMBERS TODAY.

118
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,316
>> Shannon: BUT IT'S UP 3% OVER

119
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,116
THE PAST 12 MONTHS.

120
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:19,584
>> SURE.

121
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,186
BUT WORKERS HAVE SEEN STAGNANT

122
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:25,523
WAGES ALL THE WHILE CEO PAY

ASTRONOMICAL, 300%, 400% HIGHER

124
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,426
THAN --

125
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,860

126
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,462
INCREASES NOW, MORE MONEY BEING

127
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,997
IN THEIR POCKETS BECAUSE OF TAX

128
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:35,600
CUTS, THAT DEMOCRATS OPPOSED,

129
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,335
THE PRESIDENT'S REPUBLICANS

130
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:39,070
PASSED, LOOK AT THE BONUSES

131
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,371
HANDED OUT TO MILLIONS OF

132
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,339
WORKERS AND THE FACT THAT WE

133
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,640
HAVE MORE JOBS IN OUR ECONOMY,

134
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,308
WHICH IS GOING TO PUT EVEN MORE

135
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,010
PRESSURE ON WAGES TO GO UP --

136
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,111
>> EXCEPT --

137
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,246
>> COMPANIES HAVE TO FIGHT TO

138
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:49,747
KEEP THE WORKERS THEY HAVE.

139
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,048

THE POCKET, UNTIL THE GAS PRICES

141
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:53,884
JUMPED.

142
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,519
THE GAS PRICES HAVE ALREADY

143
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,022
EATEN THE TAX BREAK THAT THE

144
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:58,990
POOREST AMERICANS RECEIVED.

145
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,759
WHO BY THE WAY ARE

146
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,060
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

147
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,295
HIGHER GAS PRICES.

1% OF AMERICANS RECEIVED 84% OF

149
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,298
THE BENEFIT OF THE TAX CUTS.

150

NONPARTISAN.

153
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:12,069
IF ANYTHING, PEOPLE THINKS IT

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,437
LEANS TO THE LEFT.

155
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,839
85% OF AMERICANS WERE GETTING A

ARE GETTING A CUT.

OF AMERICAN TAXPAYERS, GETTING

161
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,150
ABOUT 83% OF THE TAX CUT --

CUT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, WHY

168
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:35,926
DIDN'T HE GIVE A MEANINGFUL TAX

ON THE ECONOMY ONE TWO MANY

TIMES.

178
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:49,707
HILLARY CLINTON SAID THE ECONOMY

179
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,708
WOULD TANK BECAUSE OF THE

180
