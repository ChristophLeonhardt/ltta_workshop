1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,419
THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE RALLY IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,450
ARE NOW FACING THE CONFERENCES
OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,040
NEO-NAZIS, OR WHITE
NATIONALISTS.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,469
ONE OF THOSE IS ACTUALLY FORMER
EMPLOYEE OF TOP DOG, WHICH

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:18,960
IS A HOTDOG CHAIN.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,599
NOW, HE WORKED AT THIS HOTDOG
CHAIN IN BERKELEY, AND

7
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,859
APPARENTLY THE TWITTER ACCOUNT
@YESYOURERACIST

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,260
IDENTIFIED HIM, BUT UP HIS
PHOTO, AND THEN HIS

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,000
EMPLOYER WAS NOTIFIED THAT HE
TOOK PART IN THIS HATE RALLY.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,480
AS A RESULT, HE WAS FIRED.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,660
HIS NAME IS COLE WHITE; NO
LONGER WORKS FOR THE COMPANY.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,980
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT
OF THESE GUYS ARE SUPER YOUNG.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,370
COLLEGE AGED, EARLY 20S,

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,930
LATE TEENS, AND LOOK, YOU PUT
YOURSELF OUT THERE IN THIS

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,870
WAY, YOU ARE IN A PUBLIC
PLACE, YOU HAVE NO REASONABLE

16
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,440
EXPEDITION OF PRIVACY, THERE ARE
CONFERENCES FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,750
YEAH, AND SO, YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,420
NOBODY IS STOPPING YOU FROM
GOING TO THE RALLY.

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,920
YOU WENT TO THE RALLY, YOU WERE
PROUD OF IT.

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,800
AND YOU DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO
HIDE YOUR IDENTITY.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,250
I'VE BEEN TO RALLIES, POLITICAL
RALLIES, PEOPLE TAKE PICTURES

22
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,520
OF ME, THAT MAKES SENSE, I'M AT
THAT RALLY, I'M IN PUBLIC.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,500
NOW, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
CONTACTING THEIR EMPLOYER;

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,280
I WOULDN'T DO IT, THAT'S NOT THE
DIRECTION I WOULD GO, BUT

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,740
IF THE EMPLOYER FINDS OUT AND
DOESN'T WANT THAT PERSON IN

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,390
THEIR ESTABLISHMENT BECAUSE THEY
THINK IT WILL DRIVE DOWN

27
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,130
BUSINESS, I BELIEVE THAT'S
CALLED A FREE MARKET.

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,290
AND ALSO, EVERYONE, REGARDLESS
OF WHAT YOU GET INVOLVED IN

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,670
PUBLICLY, RISKS LOSING THEIR JOB
IF THEY ARE IDENTIFIED.

30
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,220
AND SO, IF I WAS AT THIS
RALLY, AND SOMEWHAT PHOTO AND

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,620
POSTED IT ALL OVER THE INTERNET,
AND YOU FIRED ME, CAN I CRY

32
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,940
ABOUT YOU FIRING ME?

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,660
THAT'S THEIR EXPERTISE, SO THEY
WILL CRY AND CRY AND CRY.

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
THEY ARE LIKE, WHAT?

35
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,020
I JUST WANTED TO HATE BLACK
PEOPLE, AND GAYS, AND JEWS IN

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,440
PEACE.

37
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,310
YOU ARE MISSING IT, WE ARE GOING
TO ALLOW YOU TO DO IT, IT'S

38
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,310
A FREE COUNTRY.

39
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,230
YEAH, THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWS YOU
TO DO IT.

40
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,160
BUT PRETTY SURE THAT TOP DOG
ISN'T PART OF THE UNITED

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,180
STATES GOVERNMENT.

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,940
YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF
SPEECH.

43
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,400
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE
POPULAR; YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
TO A PARTICULAR JOB; YOU HAVE A
RIGHT TO FORCE A PRIVATE

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,209
COMPANY TO DO YOUR BIDDING.

46
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,820
YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT
AGAINST CRITICISM.

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,420
PEOPLE CAN CRITICIZE YOU, THAT
IS NOT YOUR FREEDOM OF

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,030
SPEECH BEING TAKEN AWAY.

49
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,690
THAT IS PRIVATE CITIZENS
EXERCISING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT

50
00:02:38,690 --> 00:00:00,000
RIGHT BY CRITICIZING YOUR
SPEECH.
