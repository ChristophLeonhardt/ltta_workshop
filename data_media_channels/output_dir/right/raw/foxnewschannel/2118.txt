KANYE WEST MUST HAVE POWER.

18
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:53,595
I DOUBLED MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,163
POLL NUMBERS.

20
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:57,899
IT WENT FROM 11 TO 22 IN ONE

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,233
WEEK.

22
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:02,203

HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WITH BAD

26
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:13,147
PUBLICITY.

27
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,984
DEMOCRATIC LAW MAKERS VOTED

28
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:18,987
AGAINST LEGISLATION TO CLOSE

29
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,556
DEADLY IMMIGRATION LOOP HOLES.

30
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:23,725
HOW ABOUT CATCH AND RELEASE.

31
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:25,693
WEIGH CAUGHT THEM AND RELEASE

00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:28,229
BYE-BYE.

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,767
WE WILL KEEP VIOLENT CRIMINALS

35

00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,603
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED THERE.

37
00:01:35,603 --> 00:01:37,972
WHAT HE DID TO ONE OF THE FINEST

38
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,207
PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY.

39
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,977
AND WHAT HE DID TO THE ADMIRAL

40
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,412
IS A DISGRACE.

41
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,915
>> Dana: HE WENT ON TO EXPOUND

42
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:50,351
ON THE ISSUE MUCH GUN RIGHT AND

43
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:52,987
BEFORE THE SUPPORTERS AND

THANKED THEM.

45
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:57,225

LIBERTY AND OUR GREAT AMERICAN

48
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:02,697
FLAG.

49
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,999
YOU HAVE NEVER STOPPED FIGHTING

50
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,502
FOR OUR BELOVED CONSTITUTION.

51
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,539
THEY SAID GOING TO THE NRA

52
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,975
CONVENTION AND SPEAKING IS

53
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:14,442
CONTROVERSIAL.

54
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,244
IT MAY NOT BE POPULAR.

55
00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:18,813
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY, BYE-BYE,

56
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:21,082
GOT TO GET ON THE PLANE.

57
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:23,585
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT

58
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:24,052
THING.

59
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:25,420
>> Dana: WE'LL TAKE IT AROUND

60
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,287
THE TABLE.

61
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,656
HE WAS HAVING FUN TODAY.

62
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:31,492
>> Greg: YEAH, LIKE A CLASSIC

63
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:34,262
ROCK BAND WHO DOES HITS IN FRONT

64
00:02:34,262 --> 00:02:35,763
OF THE LOVING CROWD.

65
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:38,266
AND LIKE THE WALL IS THE

66
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,134
STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.

67
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:43,037
KANYE WAS A NEW SONG AND JOHN

68
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,473
KERRY MATERIAL HE INTRODUCED,

69
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:47,675
WHICH WAS STELLAR COMEDY ROAST.

70
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,178
WHEN YOU ARE 73, YOU SHOULDN'T

71
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:52,647
BE RIDING A BIKE AND PERFECT

72
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:52,981
STUFF.

73
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:54,916
AND I ALWAYS FIND IT.

74
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,851
THIS TO HIM IS ENTERTAINMENT FOR

75
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,955
HIMSELF AND ENTERTAINMENT FOR

76
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:03,157
OTHER AND AN ANTIDOTE TO THE

77
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:03,558
NEWS.

78
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,560
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE NEWS, ALL

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,596
YOU GET IS THE BAD NEWS, STORMY

80
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,999
STUFF AND COLLUSION ACCUSATIONS.

81
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:13,468
AND WHAT HE DOES HE TALKS ABOUT

82
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,269
THE JOB NUMBER AND TALKS ABOUT

83
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,939
NORTH KOREA AND THE GOOD NEWS

84
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,441
WHICH IS THE ANTIDOTE TO THE BAD

85
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,243
NEWS AND SO IT IS HEALTHY FOR

86
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,212
HIM AND HIS SUPPORTER AND

87
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:25,980
HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE WATCHING AT

88
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,983
HOME TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE.

89
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:30,151
>> Dana: I DON'T KNOW IF THE

90
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,320
OTHER NETWORKS TOOK IT LIVE BUT

91
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,187
WE DID.

92
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,490
THE BULLY PULPIT IS VERY

93
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:35,890
POWERFUL.

94
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,458
IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE

95
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,961
A SPEECH IN FRONT OF A BIG

96
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:41,963
CROWD, IT MEANS MORE THAN

97
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,631
A NEWSCAST.

98
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,333
>> Kimberly: IT WAS A GOOD PLUG

99
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,502
FOR THE BOOK AND THIS IS WHAT

100
00:03:47,502 --> 00:03:52,674
THE GOOD NEWS IS CHANGING THE

101
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:54,776
DIALOGUE AND NARRATIVE AND SO HE

102
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,544
WILL TAKE CHANGE.

103
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,346
HE'S GOOD WITH THE CAMPAIGN

104
00:03:58,346 --> 00:03:59,814
RALLY AND IN FRONT OF

105
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:02,083
A RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE AND PICKING

106
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,285
UP WHAT HE'S DROPPING.

107
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,821
HE FEELS AT HOME IN A SITUATION

108
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,556
LIKE THAT AS WELL.

109
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,692
>> Jesse: I WATCHED IN A ROOM

110
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:15,863
THAT IT MSNBC AND ONLY TIME WITH

111
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:17,031
UTFETTERED ACCESSES TO

112
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,466
COMMUNICATE HIS MESSAGE.

113
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,668
THERE WERE CUT AWAY AND TIMES

114
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,604
WHEN THE AUDIENCE WAS APPLAUDING

115
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:25,640
AND HE WOULD STOP SPEAKING FOR

116
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,208
15 OR 20 SECONDS.

117
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,444
AND FOX NEWS WENT TO CUT AWAYS

118
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:32,246
TO THE AUDIENCE AND SHOWED WHAT

119
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:35,083
HAPPENED IN THE ROOM.

120
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:39,620
CNN NO WAY TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE.

121
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,289
GOING INTO 2018.

122
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,590
IT IS IT THE BASE.

123
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,627
AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE

124
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:48,396
ENTHUSIASM LEVEL.

125
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,831
YOU BETTER GET UP.

126
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,199
>> Dana: THAT IS A GOOD POINT

127
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,735
ABOUT THE MIDTERMS THAT IS NOT

128
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:55,670
NECESSARILY EASY FOR THE

129
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,070
PRESIDENT.

130
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,107
THEY USUALLY LOSE SEATS EVEN

131
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,242
THOUGH HIS APPROVAL WITH

132
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,845
REPUBLICANS IS HIGHEST.

133
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,346
88 OR 90 PERCENT.

134
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,615
THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS TRANSLATE TO

135
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,550
ENTHUSIASM AND GETTING OUT TO

136
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,585
VOTE.

137
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:17,158
YOU THINK THAT WAS THE PLOY.

138
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,826
>> Juan: IF YOU CONSIDER THE

139
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,895
MID- TERM AND POLL NUMBERS.

140
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:23,564
THEY HAVE TURNED IN FAVOR OF GUN

141
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,166
CONTROL VERY STRONGLY.

142
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,834
AND AFTER PARKLAND, REMEMBER THE

143
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:29,837
PRESIDENT WAS IN THE WHITE

144
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:30,238
HOUSE.

145
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:31,672
WE CARRIED HERE ON FOX HAVING

146
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,142
A MEETING AND SAY I THINK WE

147
00:05:34,142 --> 00:05:36,611
NEED STRONGER GUN CONTROL TO YOU

148
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,247
GUYS AND YOU GUYS ARE AFRAID OF

149
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:44,285
THE NRAN AND FIVE DAYS HE FLIP-

150
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:44,685
FLOPPED.

151
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:47,688
NONE THELESS, HE IS TRYING TO

152
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:51,058
MAKE THE CASE HE IS THE MAN THE

153
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:53,427
NRA POURED 32 MILLION IN THE

154
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,730
CAMPAIGN AND AFTER HE WAS

155
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,097
ELECTED.

156
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:57,832
YOU WERE WITH ME AND I WILL

157
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,567
ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

158
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,537
>> Dana: WERE YOU SURPRISED HE

159
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,038
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

160
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:06,908
HE WAS WILLING TO CHALLENGE THE

161
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,709
NRA, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

162
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,711
THE PRESIDENT DOES, THAT MAKES

163
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,480
SENSE.

164
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,316
NOW, I UNDERSTAND WHY IT ENERGY

165
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:18,719
ARMY SCHOOL TEACHERS IS NOT DONE

166
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:19,153
NATIONALLY.

167
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,490
THAT WOULD BE A CASE BY CASE IN

168
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,092
THE DISTRICT.

169
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,494
>> Greg: THE BLESSING AND

170
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,596
CHALLENGE OF DONALD TRUMP.

171
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,365
HE IS THE CONVERSATIONAL

172
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:31,799
PRESIDENT.

173
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:33,167
HE WILL TALK ABOUT.

174
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,204
YOU KNOW THAT UPSETS ME AND B

175
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:39,373
HAPPENS, WELL, WAIT A SECOND.

176
00:06:39,373 --> 00:00:00,000
HE WENT ON A LONG TEAR OF IF ONE
