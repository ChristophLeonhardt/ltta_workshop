>> WELCOME TO "BLOOMBERG MARKETS
" SPECIAL REPORT, THE FED
DECIDES ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION
AND RADIO.
FROM BLOOMBERG HEADQUARTERS IN
NEW YORK, I AM SCARLET FU WITH
TOM KING AND MICHAEL MCKEE.
WE ARE ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE FM
OC'S JUNE DECISION.
YOU HAVE BEEN UP SINCE 4:00 A.M.
WHAT IS YOUR FIRST THOUGHT?
TOM: MICROSOFT IS AM I GOING TO
DO THIS JULY 27, NOVEMBER 21?
>> TWO WEEKS AGO, THIS WAS A
LIVE MEETING AND BREXIT WAS
DEAD.
TOM: WE HAVE A GREAT SET OF
GUESTS.
SCARLET: WE DO.
ALL OF THAT COMING UP.
MY FIRST THOUGHT IS THAT GOES
WAY BEYOND THE FEDERAL RESERVE
BECAUSE OVERNIGHT, THE SWISS
NATIONAL BANK.
TOMORROW MORNING, THE BANK OF
ENGLAND THERE WAITING IN THE
WINGS.
MICHAEL: MY FIRST THOUGHT IS IT
IS NOT ABOUT THAT WHAT BECAUSE
WE KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO IS
BASICALLY NOTHING.
IT IS ABOUT THE WHY, HOW DO THEY
EXPLAIN IT.
DO THEY SAY THAT THEY DO THEY
HAVE SEEN, AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME
DISAPPOINTING DATA LATELY, MEAN
THE ECONOMY IS GOING INTO A
SLOWDOWN, OR IS IT A BLIP?
HOW THEY EXPLAIN THAT AND GOING
FORWARD ON MATTER A LOT.
TOM: MINE IS SIMPLY THE WORLD
WILL BE WATCHING.
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT EVERYBODY
WILL BE WATCHING AROUND THE
WORLD.
SHE IS CENTRAL BANKER TO THE
WORLD.
MICHAEL: SHE IS CENTRAL BANKER
AND A MAN WHO WAS IN COMPETITION
TO HER TO BE THE CENTRAL BANK OF
THE WORLD, LARRY SUMMERS,
PUBLISHED A NEW ARTICLE CALLING
ON THE FED TO KEEP RATES THE
SAME AND TO RAISE THEIR
INFLATION TARGET.
HE SAYS THAT THAT IS MAKING THE
SAME MISTAKE THEY MAKE OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
HE SAYS IF YOU ARE RAISING RATES
TO HELP THE ECONOMY --
TOM: YES.
MY COMMENT, IT IS SO IMPORTANT
THAT LARRY SUMMERS IS ON THE
SAME PAGE WITH ZETNER
SAYING WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE
GROWTH, WHICH IS WHAT WE HEAR.
SCARLET: RAISING INFLATION
EXPECTATION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT
ENOUGH WITH COMMODITY PRICES
TAKING.
RAISING INFLATION IS A CHALLENGE
NONE OF THE CENTRAL BANKS CAN'T
SEEM TO GET RIGHT.
MICHAEL: A HIGHER INFLATION
TARGET GETS SET, THAT WILL PULL
INFLATION UP BECAUSE IT RAISES
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.
TOM: LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS.
MAYBE NOT ALL THAT MUCH WITHIN
THE STATEMENT, BUT THE PRESS
CONFERENCE YOU MAY SEE MARKETS
MOVE THE TWO YEAR YIELD AT A .69
AND THEN UP WE WENT, DOWN WE
WENT.
A HIGHER YIELD IN THE LAST TWO
HOURS.
OIL HAS BEEN SOGGY.
I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT
IS RELATED.
ON TO THE NEXT SCREEN.
THIS IS A SCREEN THAT IS A
LITTLE MORE MALLEABLE.
THIS IS STUFF THAT WILL.
THE DOLLAR INDEX.
THE EURO, 94.7.
THIS IS THE BENCHMARK.
THE ONE I WOULD REALLY WATCH
WITHIN THE NEW WANTS HIS --
NUANCES IS THE SPREAD.
87 IS NOT A RECESSION INDICATOR,
BUT THE VECTOR IS IN THAT
DIRECTION.
SCARLET: I WILL KEEP MY EYE ON
THE DOLLAR YEN.
JAPAN IS WAITING IN THE WINGS
READY TO DO SOMETHING IF
NECESSARY.
TOM: WHAT DO WE SEE FROM CHINA
OVERNIGHT?
MICHAEL: NOTHING.
THEY ARE DATA DEPENDENT ON THEIR
OWN DATA AND NOT AS DEPENDENT ON
THE FED.
THEY HAVE MOVED IN ANTICIPATION
OF THE FED, BUT IF THEY WILL BE
ON HOLD, THERE IS NO NEED.
TOM: IS THERE AN EMERGING MARKET
PROXY, THE DOLLAR AND MEXICO HAS
REALLY WEAKENED NEAR RECORD
WEAKNESS.I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT
MEANS
.
WILL IN MOVE UP THE
ANNOUNCEMENT?
I AM NOT SURE.
SCARLET: IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S
GET A CHECK ON THE BLOOMBERG
FIRST WORD NEWS.
>> THANK YOU.

POWERED BY OUR 2400 JOURNALISTS
IN MORE THAN 150 NEWS BUREAUS
AROUND THE WORLD.
TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.
GOOD AFTERNOON, RATHER.
WELCOME TO OUR COVERAGE ON
BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO
WORLDWIDE OF THIS FED MEETING.
WE HAVEN'T ESTEEMED SET OF
GUESTS FOR CONVERSATION AS WE GO
TO THE MEETING.
WHAT TIME IS THE PRESS
CONFERENCE?
MICHAEL: 2:30.
TOM: 2:30 WALL STREET TIME AND
THEN WE MOVE ON FROM THERE.
HOW DO WE GET STARTED?
LET'S GET STARTED WITH SOMEONE
WHO MAY BE MARKET CALL OF THE
YEAR AMONG MAJOR HOUSES.
IT IS THE MAJOR AT HSBC.
HOW ABOUT ALLEN'S IN YOUR --
ELLEN ZENTNER.
SHE HAS BEEN ALMOST PERFECT.
FABULOUS IN SAYING THIS IS A
THREAD THAT WILL WAIT
.
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CALL AND
LET ME SAY WHEN WILL WE SEE THE
RATE INCREASE THAT YOU SAID WE
WILL WAIT FOR?
DO WE SEE THIS YEAR?
ELLEN: WE ARE STILL STICKING TO
A CALL THAT THE FED DOES GET A
RATE HIKE IN THIS YEAR.
IN AN EERY REPEAT OF LAST YEAR,
THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IN
DECEMBER.
THESE ARE MONETARY POLICYMAKERS
NOT READY TO THROW IN THE TOWEL
YET.
TODAY IN THE STATEMENT AND THE
ACCOMPANYING DOT PLOT, THEY ARE
DETERMINED TO GET RIGHT HEIGHT
IN THIS -- RATE HIKES IN THIS
YEAR.
WE DON'T THINK THEY CAN, BUT
THEY WANT TO.
THERE IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE
OPTIMISM IN THE SECOND HALF OF
THE YEAR IF YOU ARE A POLICY
MAKER, AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO
HOLD ON TO THE HOPE THAT GROWTH
CONTINUES IN THE SECOND HALF.
TOM: HERE IS A QUOTE THAT I
LIKE.
LET'S BRING UP THE QUOTE IF YOU
WOULD.
THE BASIC IDEA IS THE LONGER RUN
DYNAMICS, YOU THINK OF
SHORT-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM, AND
LONGER RUN.
THE DISPERSION OF THE DOTS WILL
SHIFT SOMEWHAT MORE DOVISH.
WE EXPECT NEW ASSESSMENTS IN
SWEEPING CHANGES TO POTENTIAL
GROWTH THE LONGER RUN AND DOWN
EQUILIBRIA RATES.
THE WORD SWEEPING
CATCHES ME.
MICHAEL: THERE HAS BEEN A BIG
CHANGE IN THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT
HOW FAST ECONOMY CAN GROW.
RIGHT NOW, JANET YELLEN HAS SAID
SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY WE
CAN GROW FASTER BECAUSE IT
REVOLVES AROUND PRODUCTIVITY AND
THE FACT THAT PRODUCTIVITY HAS
GONE AWAY.
WE KNOW THE LABOR MARKET IS
SHRIEKING BINDS UNTIL YOU GET
SOME INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY,
HOW DO YOU GET A HIGHER NUMBER?
ELLEN: EXACTLY.
IT IS PRODUCTIVITY THAT THEY
OFTEN WANT TO WHAT THEY TALK
ABOUT WE DON'T KNOW IF
EQUILIBRIUM BREAKS WILL PICK UP.
THESE PERSISTENT HEADWINDS WERE
EXPECTED TO FADE AND THEY HAVE
NOT.
IF YOU ARE A POLICY MAKER, YOU
HAVE TO START QUESTIONING YOUR
ENDGAME.
THE POINT YOU CAN RAISE RATES TO
AND HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET
THERE.
WE HAVE SEEN IN A POLICYMAKERS
GIVE THESE REMARKS PUBLICLY THAT
WE ARE EXPECTING THAT TO SHOW UP
IN THOSE DOTS IN THE OUT YEARS.
WHILE WE DON'T THINK THE STORY
OF TODAY'S STATEMENT WILL BE
THE. COMING DOWN FOR 2016, WE
THINK THE STORY WILL BE WHAT
THEY DO IN THE OUT YEARS
PROVIDING A SOMEWHAT MORE
REALISTIC PATH ALTHOUGH IT WAS
STILL NOT BE SEEN BY THE MARKETS
AS REALISTIC.
MICHAEL: I GUESS TO SUPPORT HR,
THE QUESTION WILL BE, WIRE WE
SEEING THE DECLINE THAT WE HAVE
IN LABOR MARKETS AND THE
INFLATION EXPECTATION?
AS YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHART
OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE LAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS, A DATA
DEPENDENT AT HAS NO PARTICULAR
-- FED HAS HAD NO PARTICULAR
REASON TO RAISE RATES AT THIS
POINT.
ELLEN: I WOULD AGREE.
JOBS GROWTH HAS SLOWED.
THERE IS A BIG QUESTION MARK
AROUND THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT AND
WE NEED MORE DATA POINTS TO BE
SURE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST JOB
GROWTH MOVING INTO A SLOWER
PANEL, WITH WOULD BE TYPICAL IN
THE LATE CYCLE, LATE PHASE OF
THE BUSINESS CYCLE, OR IS IT THE
BEGINNING OF A PRECIPITOUS DROP
THAT WE SEE LEADING UP TO
RECESSIONS?
ANYTIME THERE IS A QUESTION MARK
AROUND THE DATA, THE FED SITS ON
HIS HANDS.IT NEEDS MORE DATA
POINTS
.
THIS IS WHY WE DON'T THINK IT
MOVES ON RATES THIS SUMMER.
THE PROBABILITY OF A JULY RATE
HIKE IS EXTREMELY LOW.
I WOULD NEVER SAY ZERO.
THEY HAVE SURPRISED AS BEFORE.
I WOULD PUT IT EXTREMELY LOW.
WHY IS JOB GROWTH SLOWING?
JANET YELLEN IS WORRIED ABOUT
PROFITS.
WE HAVE COME THROUGH FIVE
STRAIGHT QUARTERS OF COMPANIES
REPORTING DECLINING EARNINGS.
THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE.
IF YOU ARE BLEEDING MONEY, YOU
DON'T HIRE MORE.
THAT IS WHY WE THINK WE ARE
SEEING THE SLOWDOWN IN JOBS, BUT
HOW BIG OF A SLOWDOWN IS THE
QUESTION, AND WE NEED MORE DATA.
SCARLET: ARE WE AT FULL
EMPLOYMENT?
IF SO, DOES THE FED ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT ORTON SAID THAT -- OR HINT
AT THAT?
ELLEN: IT IS A GREAT QUESTION
BECAUSE MANY POLICYMAKERS ARE
SHOWING US THEY THINK WE ARE AT
THE EMPLOYMENT, BUT IF THAT IS
SO, WHY ARE WE NOT SEEING BIGGER
ACCELERATION IN WHICH GROWTH
THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING TO
SEE.INSET
JANET YELLEN HAS SAID PERHAPS
THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT
IS LOWER THAN WHERE WE THINK IT
IS.
IN FACT, IF I THINK BACK 10, 15
YEARS AGO SITTING AT A VENUE
WHERE SHE GAVE A SPEECH, SHE
SAID I BUY INTO THE IDEA OF THIS
NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT,
BUT I ALSO ADMIT THAT WE DON'T
KNOW WHERE IT IS.
IN REAL TIME, LET'S JUST GAUGE
WAGE GROWTH.
IF IT IS ACCELERATING, WE MUST
BE CLOSE.
I HEAR HER.
POTENTIAL GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY,
NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT,
WERE THE EQUILIBRIUM RATE OF
INTEREST RATES ARE, THOSE ARE
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MEASURES TO
GET AT, ESPECIALLY IN REAL-TIME.
EVERY FOLLOW MAKER DIFFERS ON
WHERE THEY THINK THOSE ARE.
TOM: ELLEN ZENTNER WITH US HERE
FROM MORGAN STANLEY.
LOOKING AT THE MARKET, IT IS A
CHURN HERE WITH A 16010 YEAR.
-- 160 10 YEAR.
SCARLET: NEXT UP, THE DOT PLO
T.
WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE HEADED.
MORE OF THE FED DECIDES ON
BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO
COMING UP.
♪
MICHAEL: THIS IS A SPECIAL
REPORT "THE FED DECIDES" ON
BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO.
IT IS PERHAPS THE CENTERPIECE OF
THE FED'S DECISION TODAY, THE
DOT CHART.
WE WANT TO GO OVER WHAT THAT
ACTUALLY IS AND WHY IT IS SO
IMPORTANT.
THE FED A COUPLE YEARS AGO
STARTED PUTTING OUT WITH ITS
FORECAST THE LEVEL OF THE FUNDS
RATE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE
OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE THOUGHT
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE
ECONOMIC FORECAST.
FORTUNATELY, WALL STREET HAS
TAKEN THAT AS A PREDICTION.
IT IS THE LAW OF UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES SO YOU END UP WITH
IS DOTS THAT REPRESENTS WHAT
THE FED IT SHOULD BE TWO OF THE
MARKET THINKS.
TO THE TERMINAL RATE, THE
HIGHEST THE WILL GO IS MUCH
STEEPER THAN WHAT THE MARKET
THINKS.
THEY ARE STILL EXPECTING TWO
RATE INCREASES.
THIS IS PRICED IN FOR THE END OF
2016.
THIS IS WHAT THE MARKET THINKS
IS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHICH
BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT.
THE FED THINKS THEY WILL GET
3.5%.
THE MARKET THINKS HE WILL GET 75
BASIS POINTS.
FOR JANET YELLEN TODAY
INTRODUCED CONFERENCE, IT IS
GOING TO BE ABOUT THIS GAP.
EXPLAIN THIS.
WHITE AS THE EVENTS STILL MORE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHERE INTEREST
RATES WILL GO THAN THE MARKET
IS.
SCARLET: YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THAT
ON BLOOMBERG.
STILL WITH US IS ELLEN ZENTNER.
MIKE DID A FANTASTIC JOB GIVING
US THE OUTLOOK FOR THE DOT CHART
.
THE DOT PLOT HAS COME UNDER A
LOT OF CRITICISM.
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE DOTS TO
YOU?
ELLEN: I THINK IT WAS VERY
VALUABLE WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED
BECAUSE IT CONVINCED MARKETS OR
PUT THE MONEY WHERE THE AMOUNT
IS OF THE FED, SAYING WE WILL
NOT RAISE RATES FOR A LONG TIME.
IT WAS VERY NECESSARY AT THAT
TIME.
THE UNFORTUNATE THING FOR THE
FED IS THE WAY THIS WORKS AS A
BODY IS WHAT SOMETHING IS
INTRODUCED, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT
TO TAKE IT AWAY.
ONCE THEY STARTED ON THE PATH OF
HIKING RATES, IT BECOMES NEARLY
USELESS.
MANY POLICYMAKERS HAVE ADMITTED
THAT, NOT JUST JAMES BULLARD.
NEVERTHELESS, IT IS HERE, SO
WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT?
THE FED CAN NOW USE IT AS A
COMMUNICATION COOL AROUND
ANCHORING THE LONG END OR
EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE EVENTUAL
PATH OF POLICY.
WE THINK THAT IS WHERE WE CAN BE
MOST EFFICACIOUS IN TODAY'S
MEETING BY BRINGING THE DOTS
DOWN IN 2017 AND 2018.
THAT IS WHERE THEY CAN BRIDGE
THE GAP.
MIKE MENTIONED THE EXPECTATIONS
CAP THAT THE MARKET IS PRICING
ONE RATE HIKE IN EVERY YEAR FOR
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, WHICH IS
UNREALISTIC, BUT THE FED SHOWING
THEY WILL HIKE UNREALISTICALLY.
THEY CAN CLOSE THAT GAP SO THE
FED CAN SEE MORE I TO I WITH THE
MARKET.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DOT PLOT IS
HERE TO STAY.
JANET YELLEN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY
WITH A Q&A.
MICHAEL: IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR YOU
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRADING, THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO BRING
THE TERMINAL RATE DOWN, THE ONE
THAT IS ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT
HAND SIDE OF THE DOT PLOT
BECAUSE THAT WOULD SUGGEST HOW
FAST THEY WILL MOVE RATES UP,
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW
MANY TIMES IT TAKES THEM TO GET
THERE.
ELLEN: EXACTLY.
THE FED WOULD BE PROVIDING THAT
ALL THE BRANCH TO THE MARKET,
SAYING WE ARE NOT TONE DEAF.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO MOSE THROUGH
THE RIGHT HEIGHT UNTIL WE GET TO
THE END GAME -- HIKES UNTIL WE
GET TO THE END GAME.
THERE IS A LOT MORE ROOM FOR THE
FED TO DO THEIR.
-- THERE.
I THINK PEOPLE WILL STILL WATCH
THE PATH FOR THIS YEAR.
I WANT TO SAY IT WILL BE
UNEXCITING BECAUSE THE MEDIAN
WILL STAY AT TWO RATE HIKES, BUT
WE GOT THE ONE RATE HIKE.
WHO JOINS HER?
I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME
INTERESTING DISCUSSION THERE
EVEN IF THE MEDIAN STAYS AT 2
FOR THIS YEAR.
TOM: I THINK YOU ARE DOT PLOTS
ARE LIKE SMOKE SIGNALS.
ONE-PERSON PUBLISHING SAYS THEY
ARE NUTS TO RAISE.
BUSINESS LOAN DELINQUENCIES ARE
ON THE UPSWING.
LET ME COMBINED THAT WITH
SOMETHING YOU KNOW QUITE WELL
OVER IN A BLOOMBERG TERMINAL.
WITH RECESSES SHOWING CAPACITY
TO UTILIZATION IS ROLLING OVER
WAY OFF THE 45TH YEAR TREND.
FOR THOSE ON BLOOMBERG RADIO,
ALL YOU HAVE TO KNOW IS CAPU IS
THE PULSE OF MANUFACTURING.
ELLEN, IT IS ROLLING
OVER.
ELLEN: GUESS WHAT TOM.
EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE WERE
POINTING TO THE FACT THAT A LOT
OF THIS WEEK HIS IN THE
MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS LED BY
ENERGY.
GUESS WHAT.
IT TURNS OUT YOU CANNOT HAVE A
20% RISE IN YOUR DOLLAR AND
ESCAPE THAT.
HERE IT IS SHOWING THAT IN THE
DATA.
EVEN IF WE SET ASIDE THE EFFECT
OF ENERGY INVESTMENT AND THE
DRAGNET LOWER OIL PRICES HAVE
HAD ON THAT, WE HAVE SEEN
BUSINESS INVESTMENT, PROFITS
EARNINGS WEEK AND MORE BROADLY
ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT IS
WHAT IS COMING UP IN THE
MANUFACTURING DATA NOW.
THAT IS A WORRISOME TREND.
THERE ARE OTHER BROUGHT
INDICATORS IN THE ECONOMY THAT
ARE STILL GROWING THAT HAVE
SHOWN NO SIGNS OF A PEAK.
WHEN THE OFFICIAL ARBITER OF
RECESSIONS TAKES A LOOK TO SEE
IF WE ARE APPROACHING RECESSION,
BUT CERTAINLY, THE MANUFACTURING
DATA IS NOT GOOD.
THAT WOULD TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE
A NICE REBOUND GOING ON IN Q2
LED BY THE CONSUMER, BUT THE
POOR INVESTMENT OVERS HAVE NOT
CHANGED. -- NUMBERS HAVE NOT
CHANGED.
TOM: SCARLET, I PUT THIS CHART
AS WE PUT ALL OUR CHARTS ON
BLOOMBERG RADIO PLUS.
IT IS WORLDWIDE.
SCARLET: YOU ARE STAYING WITH
US.
WE HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP ON
BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO.
WE ARE LESS THAN 40 MINUTES AWAY
FROM THE FED'S JUNE DECISION.
YOU CAN TUNE INTO BLOOMBERG
RADIO ANYWHERE AROUND THE
WORLD.ALSO ON SIRIUS AND XM
.
♪
SCARLET: THIS IS A SPECIAL
REPORT "THE FED DECIDES" ON
BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND RADIO.
I AM TAKING A LOOK AT STRESS AND
HOW IT RETURNED TO THE GLOBAL
MARKET IN THE PAST WEEK.
WHAT WE HAVE IS THE BANK OF
AMERICA GLOBAL FINANCIAL STRESS
INDEX AND HOW IT HAS REALLY
ROCKETED HIGHER.
UP 126% IN FOUR DAYS.
THE EVENTS AND MOVE INDEX WHICH
MEASURES VOLATILITY IN
TREASURIES HAS CLIMBED, BUT THEY
HAVE BOTH EASED.
THERE IS A LOT MORE STRESS AND
MARKETS.
ELLEN, TO WHAT EXTENT
DOES THE FEDERAL RESERVE
ACKNOWLEDGED THIS?
ELLEN: IS A GOOD QUESTION
BECAUSE THE FED IN GENERAL DOES
NOT REACT WELL TO LATE
BREAKING NEWS.
WHAT WE EXPECT OUT OF THE
STATEMENT OR THE TONE OF THE
STATEMENT, WE CAN USE JANET
YELLEN'S JUNE 6 SPEECH AS A
GUIDE WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED
FINANCIAL DIVISIONS HAVE EAST
AND YOU COMPARE THEM TO THE
PRIOR MEETINGS THIS YEAR.
WE HAVE A REBOUND IN ECONOMIC
GROWTH THAT IS UNDERWAY DRIVEN
BY THE CONSUMER, BUT THERE ARE
LINGERING WORRIES LIKE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND
SLOWER JOB GROWTH.
I DON'T THINK THAT IN THE
STATEMENT WE GET SOMETHING THAT
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE FINANCIAL
CONDITIONS HAVE REALLY RATCHETED
HIGHER BECAUSE THAT HAS ONLY
BEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF
MARKETS HAVE OPENED UP AND SAID
RUNS IT IS A REAL POSSIBILITY --
BREXIT IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.
SHE SHAVES IT MORE ON THE
WORRIED SIDE AND THE Q&A,
SLIPPING UP MORE LATEBREAKING
NEWS THERE.
THE FED LIKES TO WAIT AND SEE
HOW THESE EVENTUALLY SEEP
THROUGH TO THE ECONOMY AND
OUTLOOK.
MICHAEL: WE ARE SEEING
GLOBAL FINANCIAL STRESS GO UP.
A LOT OF THAT IS BREXIT.
IN THE U.S., THE STRESS INDEX
HAS COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
PEOPLE ARE SAYING BECAUSE WE
DON'T THINK THE FED WILL RAISE
RATES.
IF THAT COMES OUT WITH A HAWKISH
STATEMENT, WE CAN SEE THAT
CHANGE.
SCARLET: EXACTLY.
ELLEN ZENTNER STAYS WITH US.
THIS IS OUR SPECIAL REPORT "THE
FED DECIDES."
♪
>> THIS IS A SPECIAL REPORT.
I AM SCARLET FU ALONG WITH TOM
KEENE AND MICHAEL MCKEE.
LET'S GET YOU STARTED WITH A
CHECK OF WHAT IS GOING ON THE
MARKETS RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE THE DOW AND S&P SLIGHTLY
HIGHER.
MASTEC UP BY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF
1%.
TOM, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
TWO-YEAR.
TOM: WHAT IS INTERESTING IS I
KNOW WE ARE DOING A FOREIGN
SECTION HERE AND THAT IS
APPROPRIATE.
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW, MAYBE IT
HAS TO DO WITH TWO CHANCELLORS
ON THE STAGE TODAY, BUT THE FACT
IS, THE DATA SCREEN THIS TIME
AROUND IS TYPICAL OF MOST FED
MEETINGS.
>> THE PRIME MINISTER DID NOT
CONSULT THE CENTRAL BANK
CALENDAR AROUND THE WORLD.
IT WOULD HELP IF WE KNEW WHAT
THEY WOULD DO.
SCARLET: A BIG CLOUD IS HANGING
OVER THE MARKETS.
TWO INVESTORS ARE WAITING.
JIM CHANOS TELLS US YESTERDAY IN
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW THAT THE
HE DOES NOT BOTHER TRYING TO
PREDICT THE OUTCOME BUT WHERE
BETS HAVE BEEN PLACED.
RIGHT NOW IN THE BETTING MARKET,
65 TO 35, HE HAD BEEN AS HIGH,
AND IF YOU ARE A BETTING PERSON
IT IS TO-ONE TO SAY AND NOT
50-50.
SCARLET: MEANWHILE, "I BELIEVE
IT IS OVER HOLDING.
TOM: IN ON THIS, IF YOU WORD.
-- IF YOU WOULD.
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS ON THE Z
AXIS, HERE IN COLUMBIA BLUE OF
40.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT.
FRANCINE IS BRILLIANTLY SHOWING
THE VOLATILITY THIS MORNING.
FORMALLY THE DEAN OF ECONOMICS
IN COLUMBIA, AND NOW OF COURSE
GLOBAL STRATEGIC ADVISOR PIMCO
AND WE CONTINUE WITH ALAN OF
MORGAN STANLEY, WHO HAS AN DEAD
ON.
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
WE SHOULD IGNORE GREXIT.
JANET YELLEN IS NOT GOING TO
IGNORE GREXIT.
HOW DOES SHE FOR THAT INTO HER
FEDERAL RESERVE MANDATE?
>> IT IS A GREAT POINT.
OBVIOUSLY THE FED TAKES INTO
ACCOUNT GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT
SPIRIT WHEN WE HAVE GLOBAL
UNCERTAINTY, INTENDS TO
STRENGTHEN THE DOLLAR YOUR --
DOLLAR.
BUT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE
PRESS CONFERENCE IS THE EXTENT
TO WHICH -- REALLY A MORE
FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN ABOUT THE
U.S. ECONOMY.
WE HAVE HAD ONE SOFT DATA POINT
ON THE LABOR MARKET, WHICH DOES
NOT SEEM LIKE ENOUGH OF A REASON
TO CHANGE COURSE.
I WILL LOOK AT THAT TODAY.
>> WE COULD SEE A PROBLEM WITH
EQUITY MARKETS.
THE FED WILL WATCH THE FEEDBACK
INTO THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY.
EVEN WITH THE GROUP GAINING
GROUND, WE ARE NOT SEEING THIS
IN THE UNITED STATES.
>> AGAIN, I THINK IT IS A
REPRICING.
IF WE DO GET TO A CONCERN, OTHER
COUNTRIES IN THE UNION,
CERTAINLY WE DO SEE CREDIT
SPREADS AND THE U.S. HAS WIDENED
OUT.
THERE IS AN IMPACT OUT BEYOND
WHAT YOU SEE ON THE DOLLAR.
SCARLET: IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE
ARE SEEING IN THE U.K. WITH THE
POUND ALL OVER THE PLACE AND A
SLOWDOWN THERE, DOES THE FED PUT
MORE WEIGHT ON WHAT IS GOING ON
IN CHINA WITH THE U.K.?
>> THEY CAN WRAP IT UP IN A
GENERAL FASHION AND SAY
INTERNATIONAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT ABROAD THAT AFFECT
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE U.S.
ENCOMPASSES EVERYTHING, SIMILAR
TO WATCHING WHAT ENCOMPASSES
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LABOR
MARKET.
THERE ARE EVILS IN THE WORLD
THAT LURK BEHIND EVERY CORNER.
IT WILL BE CHINA TODAY AND SIX
MONTHS FROM NOW AND THEN YOU
WILL HAVE BIG EVENTS THAT ARE
MORE IMMEDIATE LIKE GREXIT.
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ENCOMPASSES
ALL OF IT.
WHAT I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE --
UNFORTUNATE IS THE TIMING OF
GREXIT, IT ALSO TAKES AWAY SOME
OF THE IMPACT WE WOULD GET FROM
JENNA -- JANET YELLEN'S'S
TESTIMONY.
TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF A GOOD
TESTIMONY.
WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN REALLY
NUGGETS FROM THAT EXCEPT THERE
IS A LOOMING GUERRILLA TWO LATER
--
>> TIME AND TIME AND TIME AND
TIME AGAIN, WE CANNOT GET IT
GOING.
WE ROLL OVER BECAUSE OF WEAK
ECONOMIC GROWTH.
WE ARE WAITING.
ALLEN, WHEN DO WE DO IT?
>> YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE HORSE'S
MOUTH.
IF I WANT GREAT IF I SCUM I CAN
CALL DIRECTLY.
I WAITED TO SEE ON BLOOMBERG
INSTEAD.
ONE OF THE THINGS IN THIS SHOW
AS WELL IS THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK
LOOP.
THE FED TIGHT -- GOES, NEGATIVE
FEEDBACK, SO THEY HAVE TO PAUSE
OR TAKE CARE.
GROWTH HAS BEEN VERY STRONG AND
WE DO NOT HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF
ACT DROP TODAY.
TOM: WOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN
WHEN WE GET BACK TO THESE
ECONOMICS?
>> I THINK THE FED HAS EMBRACED
THE NOTION WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT
FOR A FEW YEARS.
THE REASON FOR A GRADUAL RATE
HIKE CYCLE IS THE POLICY RATE IS
LOW AND RISING GRADUALLY OVER
TIME.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET,
AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS RUNNING
AT 3%. WE ARE APPROACHING FULL
EMPLOYMENT.
WE SEE SOME KICKOFF.
I DO NOT THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO
DISMISSIVE OF THE BASIC HOLDING
BLOCKS.
THE KEY INSIGHT IS THERE IS A
NEW NEUTRAL AND THEY NEED A
GRADUAL LIFT OFF TO A LOW DEATH
AND NATION HERE THAT IS WHY I AM
LOOK AT LONGER TODAY.
SCARLET: WE DO HAVE ANOTHER
CHART AND YOU WILL PULL THAT UP
FOR US AS WELL.
>> IT IS WHAT RICH WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT, THE IDEA THAT
INFLATION EXPECTATION HAS GONE
DOWN.
WE CAN PUT THIS OUT ON BLOOMBERG
RADIO AS WELL.
THE BLUE LINE IS CONSUMER
EXPECTATIONS ARE AT A RECORD LOW
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
SURVEY FOR INFLATION.
THE MARKETS HAVE BEEN
PESSIMISTIC FOR INFLATION FOR
YEARS.
THE ECONOMY IS MUDDLING ALONG.
WE ARE NOT SEEING MAJOR
DISINFLATION ANYMORE.
>> THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A
NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT TENDS TO
INVOLVE -- EVOLVE SLOWLY.
SHE MENTIONED IN PHILADELPHIA,
IF I WERE FED CHAIR, I WOULD PAY
ATTENTION TO IT AS WELL.
SURVEY MEASURES GET OVERLY
INFLUENCED BY ENERGY OR GASOLINE
PRICES.
THERE DOES NEED TO BE.
UNDERLYING INFLATION IN THE
ECONOMY, THE FED TARGET IS
MOVING UP.
WE NEED TO KNOWLEDGE THAT IS
WELL.
SCARLET: AS WE WRAP UP
EVERYTHING, AT A TIME OF
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY RISING,
ARE WE SEEING THE LIMITS OF
MONETARY POLICY AND CENTRAL-BANK
POLICY NOT JUST IN THE U.S. BUT
AROUND THE WORLD?
>> WITH POLICY NEAR ZERO OR EVEN
NEGATIVE IN SOME AREAS OF THE
WORLD, MONETARY POLICY HAS RUN
ITS COURSE.
WE DO NOT HAVE US MUCH IN THE
TOOLBOX AS WE USED TO.
THIS IS SOMETHING JANET YELLEN
AND COMPANY HAVE EMBRACED AND
WHY THEY STILL FEEL THAT IF YOU
ARE THIS CLOSE TO ZERO, YOU HAVE
TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY CAUTIOUS
IN THE INITIAL STEPS YOU TAKE TO
TIGHTEN POLICY P ARE YOU
MAINTAIN THAT TIGHTENING BIAS,
AND TIGHTER WAGE MARKETS,
TIGHTER WAGE GROWTH, BUT YOU
ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU NEED TO
TREAD LIGHTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY.
TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
GOOD OF YOU TO JOIN US.
WE WILL CONTINUE AT GLOBAL
MARKET STRATEGIST.
WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU AROUND THE
WORLD.

SCARLET: THIS IS A SPECIAL
REPORT.
I AM SCARLET FU.
DUE OUT IN JUST UNDER 20
MINUTES.
MICHAEL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT
IS GOING ON HERE, AND THE FED
NEEDS TO KEEP IN MIND ALL THESE
DIFFERENT HEADWINDS COME ALONG
WITH THE WEEK JOBS REPORT, IT
HAS GOT TO WALK A FINE LINE WHEN
IT COMES OUT WITH THE STATEMENT.
>> THEY WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY
THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY ARE
DOING TO IT IS NOT JUST WHAT
THEY ARE DOING BUT WHY.
LET'S LOOK AT THE MARKETS VIEW.
THIS IS WHERE THE FED INFLUENCE
WHAT IS GOING ON PARITY LOOK AT
RATE SWAPS GOING FORWARD FIVE
YEARS.
BASICALLY, THE 10 YEAR TREASURY
YIELD UP TOP IS SHOWING YOU
WHERE THE MARKET THINKS THE 10
YEAR YIELD WILL BE HALFWAY OUT
IN A FIVE-YEAR TIME.
YOU TAKE OUT THE 10 YEAR YIELD
AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE MARKET
THINKS THE INTEREST RATE IN THE
MARKET IS.
IT IS BELOW ZERO AT ALMOST A
RECORD LOW.
THE MARKET SEES NO REASON.
>> IS THERE A REASON IT IS IN
DENVER BRONCOS COLORS?
>> UNTIL SEPTEMBER, THEY ARE
STILL THE CHAMPIONS.
THE MARKETS DO NOT THINK THERE
IS ANY REASON TO TIGHTEN RATES
OUT FIVE OR 10 YEARS PAIRED IF I
DREW THE LINE LONGER, IF YOU
COULD GET SWAPS THAT FAR OUT IN
PERPETUITY.
WHAT I WOULD SAY, THE MARKETS
ARE SAYING THEY DO NOT ASK THAT
THERE TO BE MUCH OF A RATE HIKE.
THOSE NUMBERS ARE WEIGHING
SEVERAL SCENARIOS.
A 60% CHANCE OF A HIKE BUT THEN
A 40% CHANCE OF ZERO.
YOU GET AN AVERAGE SOMEWHAT
BELOW, BUT YOU ARE RIGHT THAT
WHAT YOU SEE CONSISTENTLY IS A
GAP BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND IT
IS THE DOCK THAT SHIFT DOWN.
THAT IS JUST A REALITY OF THE
WAY THE MARKETS HAVE USED THIS.
>> WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO CHANGE
THE MARKET VIEW AT THIS POINT?
WE HAVE INFLATION LOT -- RISING
LOWER.
WHICH IS ARE GOING UP AND
EQUITIES ARE NOT FALLING OF THEY
ARE HAVING TROUBLE BUT BASICALLY
THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION.
>> THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.
I THINK PART OF WHAT IS GOING ON
HERE IS JANET YELLEN HAS A
DIFFICULT COMMUNICATIONS
CHALLENGE.
THIS GOES BACK A NUMBER OF
DECADES, IN MY LIFETIME, IT IS
THE FIRST RATE HIKE CYCLE WHERE
INFLATION IS TOO LOW.
WE ARE HIKING BUT WE WANT HIGHER
INFLATION.
IT IS A TOUGH MESSAGE TO CONVEY
AND THEY ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE
CONVEYING IT.
SHE USED TO THE WORD UNCERTAIN
13 TIMES IN A SIX PAGE SPEECH.
EVERYWHERE, LOOK, A LOT OF
UNCERTAINTY AND I GUESS THE
MARKETS EMBRACED THAT NOTION AND
I DO NOT SEE ANY RATE HIKE IN
THE PIPELINE.
SCARLET: UNCERTAINTY AND CAUTION
AND ALSO ON THE ONE HAND AND THE
OTHER HAND.
TOM: I WENT TO WRITE WHERE
RICHARD WAS.
I LOVE THE HUMOR ON THE OTHER
END, UNLIKE MR. TRUMP.
IN KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION,
I WILL TURN TO THE LESS
POSITIVE.
SHE TALKED ABOUT IN
UNDERSHOOTING OF THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONSIDERED TO
BE NORMAL IN THE LONGER RUN AND
WOULD LEAD YOU INTO THE IDEA OF
WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH TIMING.
HELP US WITH THIS.
HOW ORTHODOX IS THE MEETING
TODAY?
OR IS THIS NOT UNDER THE
TEXTBOOKS WE USED WITH COLUMBIA?
>> IT IS BUT THE REASON WHY IS
WE HAD THE FED HIKED RATES.
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND FISHER
HAS MADE THE POINT WELL, POLICY
ACCOMMODATION IS MEASURED BY THE
REAL INTEREST RATES.
THE FUND RATE IS BELOW
INFLATION.
IT IS STILL VERY ACCOMMODATED.
THEY VIEW IT AS A GRADUAL MOVE
-- REMOVAL OF ACCOMMODATION.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT LATE -- RATE
BELOW, BANKS DO NOT LIKE TO THEY
WANT A TIGHT LABOR MARKET TO
PUSH UP INFLATION AND PUSH UP
WAGES.
THIS IS NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
OR YOUR UNCLE.
TOM: A LOT OF THE UNCLES AND
GRANDMOTHERS IN THOSE CANDIDATES
HAVE A GREAT LOSS OF CREDIBILITY
WITH INSTITUTIONS.
IT 12 MINUTE BEFORE THIS
DECISION, HOW DOES THIS
INSTITUTION, YOUR FED, HOW DO
THEY GET BACK CREDIBILITY WITH
MR. TRUMP, WITH DR. PAUL, AND
THE OTHERS?
HOW DO THEY PULL THEM BACK INTO
THE CENTRAL BANK FOLD?
>> I WILL NOT GET INTO SPECIFIC
CANDIDATES, BUT BROADLY, THE
BANK OF JAPAN AND THE ECB,
CERTAINLY, BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY
FELT IT WAS NECESSARY TO DO IN
THE CRISIS, THEY WANDERED INTO
THE SANDBOX OF FISCAL POLICY AND
TRADITIONALLY, THAT IS DONE BY
CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT AND
THE TREASURY AND IT IS NOT DONE
BY THE FED.
I THINK IT IS INEVITABLE.
I THINK THERE WILL BE POLITICAL
PRESSURE ON THE BANKS IN THE
FUTURE.
TOM: WE WILL CONTINUE AND AGAIN
MY, VICE CHAIRMAN.
MICHAEL: STILL AHEAD, BEFORE
JANET YELLEN'S NEWS CONFERENCE,
BRIEFINGS THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE
OUT FOR.
THAT IS NEXT ON BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION.
♪
MICHAEL: WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY
FROM THE FED DECISION.
THEY ARE GOING TO PUT A
STATEMENT OUT AT THE TOP OF THE
HOUR, GIVING THEIR REASONS FOR
WHAT THEY DO, EVEN IF THEY DO
NOT DO ANYTHING.
TO WATCH FOR IN THE STATEMENT,
WE WILL RING IN RICH FROM PIMCO
AND PLAY A LITTLE GAME.
HERE ARE THE THINGS THEY WILL
HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR THE LABOR
MARKET INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
AND GLOBAL OUTLOOK.
LET'S LOOK AT LABOR MARKET
EXPECTATIONS HERE IT IN THE LAST
STATEMENT, THE FED SAID THAT
LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE
IMPROVED FURTHER, EVEN AS GROWTH
IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY APPEARS TO
HAVE SLOWED.
KEEP IT OR CHANGE IT?
>> CHANGE IT.
>> WHAT DO THEY SAY?
>> THEY MAY REVERSE IT AND THEY
MAY SAY THE ECONOMY HAS PICKED
UP FROM Q1 BUT THE LABOR MARKET
APPEARS TO HAVE SOFTENED.
>> DO YOU THINK THE MARKET
PANICS AT THAT IF THEY DO THAT?
>> NO, I THINK JANET YELLEN GAVE
A STRONG HINT OF THAT IN HER
SPEECH.
SHE COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO SAY IT
IS ONE DATA POINT.
I THINK THEY WILL DOWNGRADED.
>> INFLATION CONFERENCE --
CONVERSATION REMAIN LOW.
LITTLE CHANGED ON BALANCE IN
RECENT MONTHS.
THE MICHIGAN NUMBER, ENOUGH TO
CHANGE IT OR KEEP IT?
>> YELLEN INDICATED SHE IS
FOLLOWING THAT CLOSELY.
I THINK THE TRICK WITH CHANGING
IT IS, IT IS A CLOSE CALL.
THEY WILL CHANGE IT THOUGH.
THE LAST THING IS THE BIG CHANGE
THEY MADE.
THEY TOOK OUT THE EXTENSIVE LINE
ABOUT THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS.
THE COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO
CLOSELY MONITOR INDICATORS AND A
GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS.
DO THEY JUST LEAVE IT AT THIS
POINT?
>> I THINK THEY LEAVE IT
UNCHANGED.
TOM: DO YOU REALIZE IT IS AT THE
DINING ROOM TABLE.
>> THAT IS FRIGHTENING.
>> IT IS PLANNED.
>> DOES THE FETTIG KNOWLEDGE
THAT HOUSEHOLD SPENDING HISTORY
OK?
RETAIL SALES TO BETTER THAN
EXPECTED.
IT HAS IT -- IT HAS BEEN HOLDING
UP.
>> Q1 WAS VERY SOFT AND Q2 IS
SHAPING UP TO BE GROWTH AROUND
2.5%.
POSSIBLY, CONSUMER NUMBERS HAVE
BEEN GOOD.
THEY WANT TO KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE
HAD A PICK UP.
THEY NEED A PICKUP FOR A YEAR TO
PLAY OUT.
TOM: MIKE, WHEN WAS YOUR FIRST
FED MEETING WITH BURNS?
HOW DID WE GET TO THESE
STATEMENTS?
PUT UP ONE OF THOSE QUOTES
AGAIN.
YOU REMEMBER YES OR NO.
>> THE FIRST STATEMENT, WE
CHANGE RATES.
WE MIGHT DO IT AGAIN.
WE NOW HAVE THESE STATEMENTS.
>> IS IT WORSE FOR THE MARKETS,
ADDED CLARITY, OR IS IT BETTER
FOR THE MARKET TO HAVE MORE
INFORMATION?
>> I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR THE
FED IS NOT TO HAVE TOO MUCH
INFORMATION, BUT THEY HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REACTION IS.
IT PROMISES THE COMMITTEE
ITSELF.
A DIFFERENT MIX ON THE
COMMITTEE, WE WOULD HAVE
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS.
THAT IS THE CHALLENGE.
>> DOES THAT GET CONVEYED THE
WAY THEY VOTE?
MOST OF THOSE VOTES HAVE BEEN
UNANIMOUS.
>> IT DOES NOT SHOW UP IN THE
VOTING BUT IT DOES SHOW UP
BETWEEN THE MEETINGS.
THE RATIO NOISE IS TOUGH TO THIS
IN TANGLE.
>> WE ARE LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES
AWAY FROM THE FED DECISION.
THE FORMER PHILADELPHIA FED
PRESIDENT, HE SAYS THE DOWNSIDE
TO A CONSENSUS VOTE IS LANGUAGE.
IF YOU CANNOT VOTE WHAT YOU WANT
TO VOTE, YOU HAVE TO CATCH
EVERYTHING IN THOSE TERMS WITH
TOM WAS CONFUSED.
>> THE REAL INNOVATION HERE, IS
TO HAVE THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED
PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE THE CHAIR
CAN USE THE BULLY PULPIT TO GIVE
HER READ OF THE SITUATION.
BEN BERNANKE USED THAT WELL AND
I THINK JANET YELLEN HAS USED
THAT EFFECTIVELY AS WELL.
>> RIGHT NOW ON OVERSHOOT, IT
SHOWED UP A LOT.
MAYBE OVERSHOOT IS THE NEW
SLACK.
I HAVE PUT THE CHART OUT ON
BLOOMBERG RADIO PLUS, BUT IT IS
TO MEASURES OF CPI GOING UP, A
PHRASE FROM RUDY WHO TRAGICALLY
DIED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.
CAN A CENTRAL BANK MANAGE AND
OVER SHOOT OR ARE THEY DREAMING?
>> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK THEY WANT TO OVERSHOOT.
THEY WILL NOT BE HAPPY WITH AN
INFLATION TARGET.
ON THE ONE HAND, ON THE OTHER
HAND, THEY HAVE BEEN BELOW
AVERAGE FOR FIVE YEARS.
THEY MAY NEED TO ENGINEER A
MODEST OVERSHOOT.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO OVERDO IT
AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE GETTING
TOO COY FOR MY SHOOT.
TOM: EQUITIES, BONDS,
CURRENCIES, I WILL ADD A
BALANCING IN THE EQUITIES
MARKETS.
THE TWO-YEAR YIELDS LOWER AND
LOWER.
1.61 IN OIL.
A CHART TO HELP OUT.
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR
YIELD.
MOST EFFECTED BY WHAT THE FED
DOES TODAY.
IT HAS BEEN VOLATILE.
GOING INTO THE MORNING, THEY
COME BACK AGAIN.
SCARLET: WHAT TYPE OF REACTION
DID WE SEE TO THE NUMBERS THAT
CAME OUT THIS MORNING THAT SHOW
A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN
ANTICIPATED BY ECONOMIST'S?
>> NOT A WHOLE LOT.
IT FEEDS INTO THE IDEA THAT
THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE
BETTER OUT THERE.
IN GENERAL, THE NUMBERS ARE NOT
THAT BAD.
>> WAY MORE INTERNATIONAL THAN I
EVER HAVE DONE.
THE 105 IS STILL STUNNING.
105 AND 92.
IT IS A BIG DEAL.
NOTED IN OUR AGO, AGAIN NOTICING
KILLING ONE SEES UP, A TWO YEAR
YIELD.
VERY QUICKLY, THE GERMAN
TWO-YEAR NEGATIVE 0.60, GERMAN
10 YEAR, ALL YOU HAVE GOT TO
KNOW IS THIS MAY BE THE MOST
INTERNATIONAL MEETING I'VE SEEN
THAT THE CHAIR HAS TO FACE.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
IT IS NOT JUST GERMANY.
U.K. FALLING AS WELL.
I AM FOCUSED ON DOLLAR YEN'S
HERE.
IT IS IN OUR SOMETHING THE BANK
OF JAPAN CANNOT LIKE IT ALL.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE STANDARD
DEVIATION MOVE IN THE DOLLAR YEN
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.
THE BANK OF JAPAN NEEDS TO STEP
IN AS WELL.
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT VERY -- HAS
TO FOLLOW UP WITH HIS MEETING
LATER ON.
>>'S FOLLOW-UP IS THE SAME AS
THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL
HAPPEN IN THE GREXIT VOTE.
THE FEELING IS MAYBE THEY HAVE
TO WAIT AS WELL.
>> THEY WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW
THE BRICKS WILL VOTE.
>> TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT IS
TRADING AT THE MOMENT.
OPEN ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE
LEAD UP TO THE GREXIT.
CURRENTLY AT 14160 WE WANT TO
CHECK IN WITH ERIK SCHATZKER,
WHO IS LIVE.
>> NO CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES.
THE FED IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION
IS HOLDING AT A QUARTER
PERCENTAGE POINT.
WHAT IS HOLDING IS THE OUTLOOK,
THE OUTLOOK FOR RATE INCREASES.
ANOTHER BIG SHIP BY THE FED,
LOWER FOR LONGER, I REPEAT,
LOWER FOR LONGER, EVERYBODY.
A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE
FEDERAL MARKET COMMITTEE STILL
ANTICIPATE INCREASES BY THE END
OF THE YEAR.
SIX NOW FAVOR ONLY A SINGLE 25
RACIST POINTS HIKE.
YOU RECALL ONLY ONE MEMBER WAS
THAT DOVISH.
PLUS THE COMMITTEE NOW EXPECTS
TO RAISE RATES AT A SLOWER PACE
IN 2017 IN 2018 TO NOT ONLY IS
THE FED MORE DOVISH, BUT IT HAS
GROWN MORE DOVISH SINCE THE LAST
MEETING IN APRIL AND REMEMBER
FROM THE MINUTES THAT MOST OF
VOTING MEMBERS WERE READY TO
RAISE RATES IN JUNE AS INFLATION
CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN.
>> OF COURSE WE HAVE THE
DISASTROUS JOBS REPORT AND HERE
IS WHAT THE FED SAID.
THE PACE OF IMPROVEMENT AND
LABOR MARKET HAS SLOWED.
INFLATION COMPENSATION DECLINED.
IN OTHER WORDS, NOT ENOUGH TO
JUSTIFY A RATE HIKE THE ARE
NOTABLY, NO MENTION IN THE
POLICY STATEMENT OF THE GREXIT
RISK.
THE FED IS ON HOLD AND GIVING NO
SIGN HOW SOON IT MAY MOVE OFF OF
THE QUARTER-POINT P ARE WE HOPE
TO IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH
JANET YELLEN.
THAT BEGINS AT 2:30.
>> WE HAVE SEEN A MAJOR MARKET
MOVE.
GIVEN ME THE DATA SCREENS IF YOU
WOULD.
I WANT TO SHOW HERE AT THE
MOMENT ON THE SCREEN.
THE MARKET IS UP 84 AND THE VIX
PLUNGERS.
THAT IS A COMPLACENCY THAT WILL
SUPPORT THE FED.
MICHAEL MCKEE REVERSAL.
IT GOES RIGHT BACK.
BRING ON THE SECOND DATA SCREEN
AS WELL.
I WILL SHOW IT IN THE MOMENT.
A STRONG END.
MICHAEL, VERY QUICKLY.
I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT AN
IMPORTANT, IT.
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS DOWN WE
GO.
THIS IS CRUSHING.
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.
ARE YOU READY?
>> IT IS ALREADY UPDATED.
YOU CAN SEE WHAT. IS JUST
TALKING ABOUT.
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE MOVED
THE FORECASTED DOWN AND NOW THE
CONSENSUS IS BASICALLY, IF YOU
ARE LOOKING AT THE MEDIAN, ONE
MORE MOVE WILL TAKE US TO A
RANGE OF 50 OR 75 BASIS POINTS.
WE ARE NOT EXPECTING TO MORE
MOVES THIS YEAR.
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO THINK WE SHOULD HAVE
JUST WENT ALL THE WAY OVER AT
THE LEFT-HAND SIDE.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE PRICING IN
FOUR MOVES JUST OVER 1.6% AND
THEN YOU GO ALL THE WAY OUT TO
THE LONGER-TERM AND YOU ARE
LOOKING AT 2.95.
YOU CAN SEE THE PURPLE LINE.
YOU CAN SEE THE MARKET
EXPECTATION HAS MOVED UP A
LITTLE BIT AS WELL AS THEY
DIGEST WHAT THE FED HAS SEEN.
THEY WANT TO MOVE CLOSER
TOGETHER AND THE MARKET WANTS
THEM TO MOVE DOWN MAYBE NOT AS
MUCH AS THEY HAVE.
>> IT WAS THE FED THAT CAME DOWN
IN THAT MARKET WENT UP.
>> THE MARKETS WENT UP A LITTLE
BIT IN THE OUT YEARS OF 2018,
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FED HAD.
SCARLET: THE FUNCTION MEASURES
PROBABILITY.
AND 8.6% CHANCE, JULY 27
MEETING.
COMPARE THAT WITH 15.8%.
IN TERMS OF GOING OUT FURTHER,
THE MARKET DOES NOT REALLY SEE
THE RATE HIKE INCREASE TO MORE
THAN 30%.
IT IS VERSAILLES WE HAVE SEEN
40% INCREASE.
TOM: WHEN I READ YOUR PAPER, ALL
OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS DID NOT
EXIST.
TO OUR ELITE ECONOMISTS KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE
THIS?
>> SURE.
THE BIG CHANGE COMPARED TO THE
CRISIS OF UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
CENTRAL BANKS NEED TO TAKE A
STAND OR A FOLK US AND GET A
SENSE OF WHERE NATURAL IS.
IT IS ALSO A RISK MANAGEMENT
APPROACH CLOSE TO ZERO.
I THINK THIS IS A HARDER PROBLEM
THEY ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.
>> A QUESTION.
THIS IS NOT POPULAR.
>> THAT IS THE TRAITOR SITTING
ON 46TH STREET.
COME ON, THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY
PLANNED.
MASSIVE OUTLIERS.
SCARLET: ERIK SCHATZKER HAS BEEN
COMING THROUGH AND YOU NOTED A
COUPLE OF CHANGES IN CHAIR
YELLEN'S STANCE, HER LANGUAGE
FROM DECEMBER UNTIL NOW.
>> I AM LOOKING MORE AT THE
DOTS.
REMEMBER IN DECEMBER WHEN THE
FED GOT OFF ZERO AND RAISE RATES
, IT ANTICIPATED RAISING RATES
FOUR MORE TIMES OVER THE COURSE
OF 2016.
HOW MUCH MORE DOVISH THIS FED
HAS GROWN IN THAT SIX MONTHS, IN
DECEMBER, 14 OF THE 17 VOTING
MEMBERS SOUGHT #RATES AT 1% OR
ABOVE BY THE END OF 2016.
IN DECEMBER, 12 OF THOSE ARE 2%
OR ABOVE BY THE END OF 2017.
IT IS TRULY INCREDIBLE.
I WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OTHER
THING.
THE FED IS STICKING TO A GRADUAL
RATE INCREASE OVER TIME.
GETTING THE FOMC AND THE ECONOMY
BACK TO A NORMALIZATION.
WE WILL HEAR WHAT JANET YELLEN
SAYS IN THE FACE OF THE FED
STICKING TO THE IDEA THAT
GRADUAL IS EVEN WANTED AT THIS
POINT.
THAT WORD NEEDS TO BE IN THE
STATEMENT AND WHETHER THE FED
CAN CONTEMPLATE NORMALIZATION AT
THIS TIME.
>> THEY ARE GRADUAL IN THE
FORECAST TO NEXT YEAR AND ONLY
1.5%.
PRETTY BLAND ABOUT WHAT IS GOING
ON.
WHY THEY HAVE COMING DOWN SO
MUCH.
>> IT IS VERY SHORT ON DETAILS.
GRADUAL WAS THE WERE USING BACK
IN DECEMBER.
IF YOU DEFINE GRADUAL IN
DECEMBER, IT WAS MORE OR LESS A
RATE HIKE ONE OF EVERY TWO
MEETINGS.
WE HAVE HAD THE FED ON HOLD AND
IT JANET YELLEN AND COMPANY ARE
GIVING US NO CLUE AND WE MAY GET
ANOTHER CLUE WHEN WE GET IN THE
ROOM, BUT GIVING US NOTE LOU
WHEN WE EXPECT THE NEXT RATE
HIKE TO COME.
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
CREDIBILITY.
THAT WORD CREPT INTO THE
MINUTES.
IT HAS TO BE CONCERNED OF THE
USE OF THE WORD GRADUAL GIVEN
WHERE WE ARE TODAY RELATIVE TO
WHERE WE WERE IN DECEMBER WHEN
THEY WERE USING THE SAME LINE
WHICH.
SCARLET: THAT MEANS THE CONTRAST
IS PRETTY DRAMATIC.
RICH IS STILL WITH US.
THE INTEREST RATE WAS CUT 3%.
THE BUSINESS CYCLE WE ARE IN NOW
IS DIFFERENT OVERALL.
>> THAT IS THE CASE.
2012, THAT WAS AT 4.25.
IT IS NOW AT THREE.
IT HAS FALLEN SUBSTANTIALLY.
THAT AS WELL.
THIS -- THIS IS WHAT WE CALL FOR
MONETARY POLICY.
IT WILL NOT ONLY BE GRADUAL, BUT
IT IS TO A MUCH LOWER
DESTINATION.
THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE
FED THAT THIS IS THE WORLD THEY
ARE NAVIGATING RIGHT NOW
ABSOLUTELY.
TOM: WHERE IS THE TERMINAL RATE.
JOHN PUBLISHED A NOTE THREE DAYS
AGO OF 2% TERMINAL RATE, WHICH I
FIND SOCIALLY AND POLITICALLY
UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE NATION.
IN YOUR ESTIMATION, WHERE IS THE
TERMINAL RATE, ALL THE USERS IN
ALL OF THE PEOPLE WATCHING WHO
WOULD GO HIT THEM OVER THE HEAD,
WHERE ARE WE GOING IN THREE OR
FIVE OR EVEN 10 YEARS?
>> THERE IS A NEW NEUTRAL, WHICH
WE HAVE DEFINED AS A FED FUNDS
RATE OF TWO OR 3% AND GIVEN
WHERE THE FED IS NOW, IT IS
PROBABLY THE LOWER END OF THE
RANGE AND WITH A 2% INFLATION,
THAT MEANS A REAL RETURN ON CASH
20 COMPARED WITH 200 BASIS
POINTS ON THAT CRISIS.
IN FIVE OR 10 YEARS, WE WILL
PROBABLY HAVE A RECESSION.
IF WE DO, THE FED WILL BE HIKING
.
THAT IS THE OTHER FACTOR TO TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL.
>> WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE
FED'S ECONOMIC FORECAST.
THEY MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
THIS YEAR.
BRINGING DOWN THE FORECAST GOING
OUT TO 2018, THEY SEE THE
ECONOMY GROWING 1.9-2 PERCENT
THIS YEAR.
IN MARCH, THEY HAD SEEN 2.1-2.3.
SO THEY SEE SLOWER GROWTH BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, THEY SEE RICH AND
FASTER INFLATION.
THEY'RE CALLING FOR THE PRICE
INDEX OF 1.7 THIS YEAR.
IN MARCH, THE ONLY SAW 1% TO
1.6%.
>> I THINK THIS RECOGNIZES THE
POTENTIAL GROWTH RATE IN THE
ECONOMY HAS REALLY SLOWED
GLOBALLY AND I THINK IN THEIR
VIEW, THEY HAVE GOT A SLOW RATE
OF POTENTIAL GROWTH AND MICEX
ARE CLOSING AND THEIR MODELS ARE
TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD GET
GIVE A PICKUP IN INFLATION, AS I
SAID.
THIS IS A FED THAT ONE TIRE
INFLATION.
THIS IS A FED THAT IS HIKING
RATES AND WANTS HIGHER
INFLATION.
THAT IS WHEN -- THE WAY THE
MODEL INSTRUCTS THEM.
TOM: RICHARD WILL CONTINUE WITH
US.
LET ME DO A DATA CHECK.
A MAJOR MOVE IN THE FIXED INCOME
MARKET NOW.
THE TWO YEAR YIELD THOSE
ROUNDTRIPPER OVER THE LAST 48
HOURS.
WE WENT FROM .67 AND WE GO RIGHT
BACK DOWN IN THE LOW END OF A
RECENTA MAJOR MOVE IN THE FIXEDE
MARKET NOW.
 RANGE.
THE 158 LEVEL, GOOD MORNING.
HSBC ON THE EARLIER CALL OF 1.50
PERCENT.
AS SCARLET STATED, THE NFL ON A
577, YOU REALLY WONDER HOW JAPAN
WILL WAKE UP ON THURSDAY
MORNING.
SCARLET: THIS IS THE WEAKEST
LEVEL OF THE DOLLAR AGAINST THE
ANSYS SEPTEMBER 2014.
I WANT TO BRING IN THE COHEAD OF
THE GLOBAL FIXED PORTFOLIO
MANAGEMENT GOAL ASSET
MANAGEMENT.
ARE YOU CHANGING HOW YOU ARE
ALLOCATING YOUR FUNDS AND ARE
YOU CHANGING HOW YOU ARE PUTTING
YOUR MONEY RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT
YOU HAVE JUST LEARNED?
>> THE STATEMENT WILL NOT COST
-- WILL NOT CAUSE US TO CHANGE
PORTFOLIOS.
WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHERE THE
NEWS WAS.
THE NEWS WAS IN THE JOBS REPORT
IN THE NEWS WAS IN THE LOWER
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN THE
MARKETPLACE AND IN SLOWER
CORPORATE EARNINGS.
THERE ARE FUNDAMENTALS CAUSING
US TO CHANGE OUR POSITION IN THE
PORTFOLIOS.
>> IT IS ALSO IN THE WAY THE FED
INTERPRETED AND FRAMED THE DATA
WE'VE ALL BEEN REACTING TO.
>> AS ALL OF YOU AND SOME OF
YOUR SPEAKERS HAVE SAID, THE FED
IS JUST CATCHING UP WITH THE
MARKET HERE WITH THE FED IS
DOING IS REPORTING THE NEWS AND
FOLLOWING THE MARKET IN OUR
VIEW.
>> ONE MORE RATE INCREASE THIS
YEAR, LOWERING GROWTH FORECAST,
AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO GO ON VACATION IN
JULY AND JUST FORGET THAT
EATING?
>> THERE IS A LOT GOING ON
ACROSS THE MARKETS.
YOU THINK ABOUT GREXIT AND CHINA
RISK AND THE SLOWER ECONOMY IN
THE U.S. 
THOSE KEEP US UP AT NIGHT MORE
THAN A SINGLE FED MEETING.
THE RISK OF RATES, I WOULD SAY
THE OPPOSITE IS THE RISK.
THE RISK IS THAT THE SESSION
RISK IS HIGHER NOW.
THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE
CONCERN.
>> YOUR TRADE BACKGROUND, WHAT
WILL BE THE STABILITY WHEN YOU
HAVE A JUMP CONDITION?
28 YEARS OLD, THEY JUST TOOK
LEVEL TWO AND LEVEL THREE, DO
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE ANSWERS?
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED LIKE
YOU HAVE HERE WHEN YOU GET THE
JUMP CONDITION, HOW WILL THE
MARKETS REACT?
>> WE HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
WITH GRAY HAIR.
WE HAVE A TON OF BLOOMBERG.
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY COACHING THEM
BUT THEY ARE STUDENTS OF
HISTORY.
WE ARE VERY MUCH FOCUSED AND
MUCH MORE CONCERN ABOUT WHERE
THINGS GO IN TERMS OF THE RISK
OF A SLOWDOWN AND THE ECONOMY.
WE ARE TRYING TO COACH HIM
PEOPLE.
>> WHAT I WANT TO KNOW FROM YOU
IS THE JULY MEETING AND THE
SEPTEMBER MEETING, IT IS NOT
COMMERCIAL PAPER.
IN THE TRENCHES AT GOLDMAN SACHS
ASSET MANAGEMENT?
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, THE THING THE FED IS
WATCHING MOST CLOSELY AS
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.
WE WATCHED INDEX VERY CLOSELY.
GOLDMAN SACHS HAPPENED TO HAVE
ONE AS WELL.
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE NOW,
THEY ARE AT ABOUT THE SAME PLACE
THEY WERE IN DECEMBER WHEN THE
FED TIGHTENED FOR THE FIRST
TIME.
THAT IS NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO, WE'RE LOOKING FOR AN
INCREASE IN NATION AT
DICTATIONS.
WE WATCHING WAGE DATA VERY
CLOSELY.
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF
SURVEYS RECENTLY IS INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS.
>> HISTORY HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE
BEST START IN THE BEST START IN
THEY GO TOO MUCH AND TOO FAST.
WITH THE WAY THEY BROUGHT IT
DOWN, HE FINALLY WILLING -- ARE
YOU FINALLY GOING TO ACCEPT THE
GRADUALLY QUESTION >>
ABSOLUTELY.
-- GRADUALLY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE
WORLD WILL OPERATE.
THE OTHER THING WAS A
PRESUMPTION OF ALL STUDENTS OF
THE CENTRAL BANK POLICY WAS THAT
THE EUROPE -- THE U.S. WAS AN
ECONOMY.
WHAT HAPPENS IN GENERAL DOES NOT
MATTER.
>> THAT IS NOT SURE ANYMORE.
CAPITAL FLOWS ARE SIGNIFICANT
AND HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE
MARKET.
TOM: ON THE ACTUAL TRADING AND
DOING OF THINGS IN THE MARKET, I
HAVE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU.
I REMEMBER DAVID WAS TALKING
ABOUT FOUR STANDARD DEVIATION
MOVES AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT
OIS FOR THAT.
HOW CLOSE -- THAT IS THE WRONG
QUESTION.
HOW DEEP IS THE MARKET NOW TO
WITHSTAND STANDARD DEVIATION
SHOCK?
>> LIQUIDITY IS INCREDIBLY
CHALLENGED ACROSS THE MARKETS.
I WOULD SAY THOUGH THAT YOU
WOULD HAVE MORE AND MORE
SHORT-TERM BLIPS IN MARKETS
BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY.
IN THE END, REAL MONEY MATTERS
AND ECONOMICS MATTER.
IN THE EVENT WE HAVE A MODERATE
LEVEL OF GROWTH AND A MODERATE
LEVEL OF INFLATION, SOMETHING
LIKE GREXIT AND A CREDIT CONCERN
IN CHINA WILL NOT BLOW UP THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
IN THE LONG RUN, IT WILL BE THE
FUNDAMENTALS THAT MATTER.
STARLET: VOLATILITY AND
LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMICS.
THERE IS TALK THAT TALKS ARE
HIGHER, CLOSE TO MILLENNIAL
HIGHS.
HOW DO YOU REACH THAT?
IS AN INDICATION INVESTORS ARE
PRICING IN?
>> I DO NOT THINK IT IS
NECESSARILY A RECESSION BUT IT
IS PRUDENT IN MARKETS WHERE YOU
HAVE HAD SOME SPREAD
COMPRESSION, TWO OR THREE WEEKS
AGO, THE VIX WAS AT 13 AND YOU
HAD 21 THE OTHER DAY.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE CASH LEVELS
REFLECTING LIQUIDITY BUT YOU
THINK PRICING EVALUATION MAKES
GOOD SENSE TO BE RUNNING HIGHER
THAN AVERAGE CASH LEVELS IN
THESE MARKETS, ABSOLUTELY.
>> I WOULD AGREE 100% PURITY IF
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN
THE CREDIT MARKETS, THEY ARE
PERFORMED INCREDIBLY WELL
BECAUSE RATES ARE NEGATIVE
EVERYWHERE ELSE AND RATES IN THE
U.S. ARE POSITIVE.
OUR VIEW IS THAT THERE IS RISK
IN THE ECONOMY.
AND YOU LOOK AT THE PERSPECTIVE.
>> THE FED SEEMS TO BE ON A HOLD
FOR QUITE SOME TIME HERE AND I
WILL ASK YOU AND I WILL AT --
ASK RICH, ARE YOU GETTING TO THE
POINT WHERE CACHES UNACCEPTABLE
SUBSTITUTES?
IS THE FED DISTORTED THE MARKET
SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE DO NOT NEED
TO BUY ASSETS?
>> THE DEBATE AROUND GENERATING
POSITIVE RETURNS FOR INVESTORS
WILL BECOME A BIGGER AND A
BIGGER ISSUE HERE AT A BIG ISSUE
IN EUROPE AND JAPAN, AND WITH
RATES SO LOW IN THE U.S., IT HAS
BECOME BIG HERE.
IN THE EVENT THE FED IS MORE
DOVISH AND WE WILL BE IN A
SLOWER GROWTH ENVIRONMENT BUT A
LOW RISK OF RECESSION, YOU WILL
SEE MORE AND MORE MONEY COME TO
THE MARKET TO GENERATE POSITIVE
YIELDS.
YOU DO NOT WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH
DIRECT ECONOMIC RISK BUT STILL
TRY TO FIND HIGH-QUALITY WAYS TO
GENERATE RETURNS.
>> ARE WE GETTING TO A POINT NOW
WHERE MARKETS ARE STILL
DISTORTED AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO
BUY A NEGATIVE RATE INSTRUMENT
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT TO PAY TO
GET IT, IS THE SAFETY NOT WORTH
IT?
>> EXACTLY.
NEGATIVE RATES, WE HAVE
THANKFULLY AVOIDED THAT IN THE
U.S. 
NEGATIVE RATES ARE A DISTORTION
AND WE REFERRED TO THIS OF THE
WORLD OF INSECURE STABILITY.
THE WORLD APPEARS TO BE STABLE
BUT THAT IS DECEPTIVE.
IN THAT WORLD, IT MAKES SENSE TO
FOCUS AS MUCH ON PRESERVING
CAPITAL AS IT DOES TO DESERVING
ON CAPITAL.
TO RETURN UNDER CAPITAL IN THIS
WORLD, I THINK THAT SHOULD GUIDE
INVESTING.
>> AS WE GO TO ASIA, IF I LOOK
AT EUROPEAN BANKS, THEY ARE
PERFORMING MISERABLY.
DO YOU SEE LIQUIDITY IN THE
EUROPEAN MARKET OFF OF THIS
MEETING -- ECONOMIC MUMBO-JUMBO
THAT WILL ALLOW THESE BANKS TO
TRY TO SHIELD THEMSELVES AS
GOLDMAN SACHS AND AMERICAN BANKS
SHIELD THEMSELVES YEARS AGO?
IS THERE A TRADING STABILITY
WHEN YOU LOOK OUT OF NEW YORK
AND OUT OF LONDON?
>> THERE IS VERY LIMITED CREDIT
CREATION GOING ON IN EUROPE
BECAUSE OF THE CAPITAL
CHALLENGES OF THE BANKS.
UNLESS THE BANKS IN THE
COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT A LOT OF
THESE BANKS BY THE BULLET AND
DECIDE TO RECAPITALIZE THE
BANKS, WE ARE IN A SITUATION
WHERE WE CONTINUE TO SEE LOW
LEVELS OF GROWTH AND POTENTIALLY
DEFLATION IN EUROPE.
TOM: I GO BACK TO YOUR SKILL SET
IN THE TRENCHES HERE.
THE BASIC IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO
COMPETE WITH MARIO DRAGHI FOR
PAPER, AM I RIGHT THAT THAT IS
WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?
>> YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY PRICING
THE BANKS OUT OF A HIGH-QUALITY
MARKET HERE WHEN THE BANKS
GENERATE EARNINGS, THEY WILL
RELY ON MORE RISK HERE THE
PROBLEM IS IT IS A VICIOUS CYCLE
GOING ON IN EUROPE.
WITH CONTINUED SLOW GROWTH,
THERE'S TOO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT
REGULATION AND POLITICAL RISK IN
EUROPE.
YOU'RE FINDING COMPANIES ARE NOT
EXTENDING.
TOM: IT IS GREAT TO SEE MIKE IN
THE TRENCHES.
VERSUS FIRST-CLASS FLYING AT
50,000 FEET.
SCARLET: NOT A BAD PLACE TO BE.
LET'S LOOK AT DOLLAR YEN.
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON IT.
AS LOW AS 105 643 AGAINST THE
JAPANESE YEN.
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN FOR THE DOLLAR
VERSUS THE YEN.
THE DOLLAR YEN WAS WET -- WAS AT
187 AND BEFORE APRIL, 11131.
>> WE ARE ALL FRIENDS HERE.
I WILL CALL AN AUDIBLE.
>> THAT IS TRICKY.
PROBABLY BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY
HAVE LEARNED IN THE PAST AND ARE
NOT INTERVENING.
OBVIOUSLY, THEY WILL WEAKEN THE
NP OR MY GUT TELLS ME IF WE ARE
AT 100 OR THROUGH IT, THAT WOULD
BE A MAGIC NUMBER THAT WOULD
PROBABLY TRIGGER SOME
INTERVENTION.
IT WOULD BE THE MINISTER OF
FINANCE.
>> SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND IS
THE U.S. TREASURY HAS BEEN TERM
IN SAYING DO NOT DO THAT.
HOW FAR WILL THEY LET THEM GO?
IN THE PAST, WE HAVE COOPERATED.
DOES THE REST OF G7 LET JAPAN
JUST GO DOWN THE TUBES?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIPLOMATIC
LANGUAGE, THERE IS ALWAYS
VOLATILITY AND UNSTABLE MARKETS.
NOBODY KNOWS THAT.
IF YOU MOVE AT 122 NOT TOO LONG
AGO, IT IS A BRUTAL MOVE.
AGAIN, IT WOULD NOT SHOCK ME.
UNDERSTAND WE SEE THAT LEVEL BUT
IF WE DO, IT WILL NOT CHECK ME
IF WE SAW SOME INTERVENTION.
TOM: IDENTIFYING THE YEN TO ONE
OF 561.
IT IS REMARKABLE.
IT IS A TWO YEAR YIELD.
WHILE OUTSIDE TWO STANDARD
DEVIATIONS, IS JANET YELLEN
LOSING CONTROL OF HER MANAGEMENT
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU?
>> I DO NOT THINK SO.
IF I HAD TO LOOK AT A SINGLE
PIECE OF NEWS AND DID NOT HAVE
THE BENEFIT OF READING THE
REPORT, THE KEY POINT IS SIX
MEMBERS OF THE FED DECIDED TO
MOVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF TWO
INCREASES IN 2016 21.
WE THINK ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS
CHAIR YELLEN.
WE ACTUALLY THINK THE
PROBABILITY OF TWO HIKES,
ALTHOUGH -- IT HAS GONE DOWN.
IT WILL IMPACT THE TWO YEAR.
THE 10 YEAR WILL BE MUCH MORE
RELEVANT TO THE FUTURE PATH FOR
RATES.
SCARLET: BEFORE WE LET YOU GO,
WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU
WANT TO HEAR FROM JANET YELLEN
IN HER NEWS CONFERENCE?
>> IT IS VERY MUCH A GLASS IS
HALF-EMPTY STATEMENT.
I WILL LOOK FOR JANET YELLEN TO
INDICATE SOME POSITIVE.
IT IS A VERY DOVISH STATEMENT.
WE WILL SEE IF SHE TRIES TO
CREATE A TWO-WAY READ OF HER
INTENTIONS OR IF SHE TRIES TO
REINFORCE THE DOVISH STATEMENT?
>> I FIGURE YOU WILL SEE A
LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFYING BALLOTS
TO OFFSET A LITTLE BIT OF
DOVISH.
>> THE MARKET IS REALLY TAKING
IT AS A DOVISH MOVE.
>> IT WILL BE RELIANT UPON THE
DATA.
WE ARE SPENDING A LITTLE BIT TOO
MUCH TIME.
>> WE WANT TO THANK RICHARD OF
PIMCO.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
LET'S GET A DATA CHECK.
WE NEED TO BE REMINDED TO CHECK
THE 10 YEAR YIELD AS WELL.
MOVING DRAMATICALLY AFTER THIS
STATEMENT.
TOM: MICHAEL MCKEE NOW THE
VOLATILITY HERE AND WHAT IT
WOULD MEAN FOR THE MARKETS.
I SUGGEST THE PRESS CONFERENCE
WOULD BE THE MOST INTERESTING.
I THINK YOU CAN SAY IT.
MICHAEL: THIS IS NOT THE FED
FUNDS.
HE CAN SEE THE TWO-YEAR TAKING
OUT.
TWO MOVES THIS YEAR, 56 BASIS
POINTS, ROUNDUP TO 57.
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE TRADING AROUND
37 BASIS POINTS.
YOU ARE NOT EVEN IN THE
MID-POINT OF A MOVE UP.
TOM COLE AND BLOOMBERG RADIO AS
WELL, WORLDWIDE.
OF COURSE ACROSS OUR MANY
CHANNELS.
INTERESTING AND SURPRISING
ANNOUNCEMENT.
YOU SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THESE
DOVISH -- JANET YELLEN.
>> YOU THINK THERE IS A SHIFT IN
THE FORECAST, AND THAT IS THE
NEWS HERE.
>> IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO
MARKDOWN HIS VIEW OF GDP OFF OF
WHAT WE HEARD TODAY?
>> YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASK HIM
THAT QUESTION.
>> WE DID NOT HAVE A DISSENT
THIS TIME.
GEORGE FROM THE KANSAS CITY FED
WENT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY.
SHE IS PROBABLY HIGHER ON THE
LIST.
HAS BEEN ARGUING THE FED WOULD
RACE RATE.
SCARLET: DOES IT MATTER AMONG
FED OFFICIALS?
>> NOT AT ALL.
THE FED IS NOT THE NEWS HERE.
>> WHAT IS THE NEWS?
>> THE NEWS IS THE JOB NUMBER,
IS IT REAL OR NOT.
WE LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
>> DECADES WORKING IN FIXED
INCOME, IS THE NEWS THAT WE ARE
IN A GREAT DISTORTION, NEAR
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES, WHERE
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT TO DO, IS IT
TRUE?
>> IT IS A RISK THAT THE ISSUES
OCCURRING IN JAPAN AND OCCURRING
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE HAVING
A SIGNIFICANT AND
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT.
THAT OUR ECONOMIC MODEL HAS EVER
FULL US.
TOM: CAN I ASK YOU A DUMB
QUESTION?
DO YOU MAKE MONEY WHEN YOU TRADE
NEGATIVE INTEREST RATE PAPER?
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION YOU CAN.
YOU CAN MAKE MONEY IN THE EVENT
THAT RATES WILL RISE.
TOM: HE LIGHTS UP.
THAT IS AMAZING.
>> WE LIKE TO MAKE MONEY.
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE THAT MAKING
MONEY OWNING GERMAN BONDS.
WE ACTUALLY OWN THEM.
THERE HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE RATES
AND I THINK IT WILL BE A
TERRIBLE EVENT BUT IN THE NEAR
TERM, YOU SEE INFLATION.
>> MY QUESTION THEN, CAN YOU
TRADE OUT FAST ENOUGH TO KNOCK A
KILLED?
OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRAITS THAT
ARE BASED ON THIS?
>> OF COURSE WE CAN.
THE QUESTION IS PRICE.
>> HAPPEN YOU HEDGE WHAT IT IS
ON STERLING?
>> THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
CHALLENGED AND VERY RAPID MOVE
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW
DAYS AND CHANGING EXPECTATIONS.
VERY DIFFICULT.
YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE
MOST OF THE DIRECT WRIST -- RISK
IS PRICED.
ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE AT SUCH
LOW REASONS WE
ARE AT SUCH LOW LEVELS DESPITE
THE NEWS TODAY IS YOU HAVE SEEN
A LOT OF CAPITAL COMING OUT
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OF BREXIT
BUYING TREASURIES.
IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO MOVE,
PEOPLE TO SOME DEGREE OVER STATE
THE CHALLENGES IN THE MARKET.
SCARLET: JANET YELLEN COMING UP
TO THE PODIUM.
THIS IS HER NEWS CONFERENCE
FOLLOWING THE FED RATE DECISION.
LET'S GO TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
WERE CHERRY YELLEN IS BEGINNING
HER PREPARED REMARKS.
CHAIR YELLEN: TODAY, THE FEDERAL
OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE MAINTAIN
THE FEDERAL RANGE AT 1.25 TO
1.5%.
THIS ACCOMMODATIVE POLICY SHOULD
SUPPORT FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARD
OUR STATUTORY OBJECTIVES OF
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE
STABILITY.
BASED ON ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, THE
COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO
ANTICIPATE A GRADUAL INCREASES
IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OVER
TIME ARE LIKELY TO BE CONSISTENT
WITH THE ACHIEVING AND
MAINTAINING OUR OBJECTIVES.
HOWEVER, RECENT ECONOMIC
INDICATORS HAVE BEEN MIXED,
SUGGESTING OUR CAUTIOUS APPROACH
TO ADJUSTING MONETARY POLICY
REMAINS APPROPRIATE.
AS ALWAYS, OUR POLICY IS NOT ON
A PRESET COURSE, AND IF THE
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SHIPS, THE
APPROPRIATE PATH OF POLICY WILL
SHIFT CORRESPONDINGLY.
I WILL COME BACK TO OUR POLICY
DECISION, BUT FIRST, I WILL
REVIEW RECENT ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OUTLOOK.
ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY
WEAK LATE LAST YEAR AND EARLY
THIS YEAR.
SOME OF THE FACTORS WEIGHING ON
THIS WERE EXPECTED.
FOR EXAMPLE, EXPORTS HAVE BEEN
SOFT REFLECTING SOME DUDE
FOREIGN DEMAND, AND THE EARLIER
APPRECIATION OF THE DOLLAR.
ACTIVITY IN THE ENERGY SECTOR
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN HIT BY THIS
DEEP DROP IN OIL PRICES SINCE
MID-2014.
THE SLOWDOWN IN OTHER PARTS OF
THE ECONOMY WAS NOT EXPECTED.
IN PARTICULAR, BUSINESS
INVESTMENT OUTSIDE OF ENERGY WAS
PARTICULARLY WEEK DURING THE
WINTER, AND APPEARS TO HAVE
REMAINED SO INTO THE SPRING.
IN ADDITION, GROWTH IN HOUSEHOLD
SPENDING SLOWED NOTICEABLY EARLY
IN THE YEAR, DESPITE SOLID
INCREASES IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME,
AS WELL AS RELATIVELY HIGH
LEVELS OF CONSUMER SENTIMENT AND
WEALTH.
FORTUNATELY, THE FIRST QUARTER
SLOWDOWN IN HOUSEHOLD SPENDING
APPEARS TO BE TEMPORARY,
INDICATORS THAT THE SECOND
QUARTER HAVE SO FAR POINTED TO A
SIZABLE REBOUND.
THIS RECOVERY IS A KEY FACTOR
SUPPORTING THE COMMITTEE'S
EXPECTATIONS THAT OVERALL
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WILL EXPAND AT
A MODERATE PACE OVER THE NEXT
FEW YEARS.
DESPITE LACKLUSTER ECONOMIC
GROWTH, THE JOB MARKET CONTINUED
TO IMPROVE EARLY IN THE YEAR.
DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, JOB
GAINS AVERAGED NEARLY 200,000
PER MONTH, JUST A BIT SLOWER
THAN LAST YEAR'S PACE.
AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HELD
NEAR 5%, EVEN THOUGH NOTABLY
MORE PEOPLE WERE ACTIVELY
LOOKING FOR WORK.
HOWEVER, MORE RECENTLY, THE PACE
OF IMPROVEMENT IN THE LABOR
MARKET APPEARS TO HAVE SLOWED
MARKEDLY.
JOB GAINS IN APRIL AND THEY ARE
ESTIMATED TO HAVE AVERAGED ONLY
ABOUT 80,000 PER MONTH.
WHILE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL
TO 4.7% IN MAY, THAT DECLINE
OCCURRED BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE
REPORTED THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY
SEEKING WORK.
A BROADER MEASURE OF
UNEMPLOYMENT THAT INCLUDES
INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT AND ARE
AVAILABLE TO WORK BUT HAVE NOT
SEARCHED RECENTLY, AS WELL AS
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING PART-TIME
BUT WOULD RATHER WORK FULL-TIME,
HAS FLATTENED OUT.
ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE, AVERAGE
HOURLY EARNINGS INCREASED 2.5%
OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, A BIT
FASTER THAN IN EARLIER YEARS,
AND A WELCOME INDICATION THAT
WAGE GROWTH MAY FINALLY BE
PICKING UP.
ALTHOUGH RECENT LABOR MARKET
DATA HAVE ON BALANCE BEEN
DISAPPOINTING, IT IS IMPORTANT
NOT TO OVERREACT TO ONE OR TWO
MONTHLY READINGS.
THE COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO
EXPECT THAT THE LABOR MARKET
WILL STRENGTHEN FURTHER OVER THE
NEXT FEW YEARS.
THAT SAID, WE WILL BE WATCHING
THE JOB MARKET CAREFULLY.
ONGOING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND AN
IMPROVING LABOR MARKET UNDERPIN
OUR INFLATION OUTLOOK.
OVERALL, CONSUMER PRICE
INFLATION, AS MEASURED BY THE
PRICE INDEX FOR PERSONAL
CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES, WAS
ABOUT 1% OF THE 12 MONTHS ENDING
IN APRIL, STILL SHORT OF OUR 2%
OBJECTIVE.
MUCH OF THIS SHORTFALL CONTINUES
TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF
EARLIER DECLINES IN ENERGY
PRICES AND LOWER PRICES FOR
IMPORTS.
CORE INFLATION, WHICH EXCLUDES
ENERGY AND FOOD PRICES, HAS BEEN
RUNNING CLOSE TO 1.5%.
AS THE TRANSITORY INFLUENCES
HOLDING DOWN INCLUDE --
INFLATION FADE, AND AS THE LABOR
MARKET STRENGTHENS FURTHER, THE
COMMITTEE EXPECTS INFLATION TO
RISE TO 2% OVER THE NEXT TWO TO
THREE YEARS.
OUR INFLATION OUTLOOK ALSO RESTS
IMPORTANTLY ON OUR JUDGMENT THAT
LONGER RUN INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS REMAIN REASONABLY
WELL ANCHORED.
HOWEVER, WE CANNOT TAKE THIS
ABILITY OF LONGER RAIN INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS FOR GRANTED.
WHILE MOST MEASURES OF INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE
ON BALANCE IN RECENT MONTHS,
FINANCIAL MARKET MEASURES OF
INFLATION COMPENSATION HAVE
DECLINED.
MOVEMENTS IN THESE INDICATORS
REFLECT MANY FACTORS, AND
THEREFORE, MAY NOT PROVIDE AN
ACCURATE READING ON CHANGES IN
THE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS THAT
ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR WAGES AND
PRICES.
NONETHELESS, IN CONSIDERING
FUTURE POLICY DECISIONS, WE WILL
CONTINUE TO CAREFULLY MONITOR
ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PROGRESS
TOWARD OUR INFLATION GOAL.
LET ME NOW TURN TO THE
INDIVIDUAL ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS
SUBMITTED TO THIS MEETING BY
FOMC PARTICIPANTS.
AS ALWAYS, EACH PARTICIPANT'S
PROJECTIONS ARE CONDITIONED ON
HIS OR HER OWN VIEW OF
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY,
WHICH IN TURN, DEPENDS ON EACH
PERSONS ASSESSMENT OF THE
MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT SHAPE
THE OUTLOOK.
PARTICIPANTS PROJECTIONS FOR
GROWTH OF INFLATION ADJUSTED
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ARE
SLIGHTLY LOWER IN THE NEAR TERM
THEN IN THE PROJECTIONS MADE FOR
THE MARCH FOMC MEETING.
THE MEDIAN GROWTH PROJECTION NOW
REMAINS AT 2% THROUGH 2018, IN
LINE WITH ITS ESTIMATED LONGER
RUN RATE.
THE MEDIAN PROJECTION FOR THE ON
A PLUMMET RATE EDGES DOWN FROM
4.7% AT THE END OF THIS YEAR TO
4.6% IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS,
SOMEWHAT BELOW THE MEDIAN
ASSESSMENT OF THE LONGER RUN
NORMAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.
THE MEDIAN PATH OF THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS LITTLE
CHANGED FROM MARCH.
FINALLY, THE MEDIAN INFLATION
PROJECTION STANDS AT 1.4% THIS
YEAR, A BIT FIRMER THAN IN
MARCH, AND THEN RISES TO 1.9%
NEXT YEAR, AND 2% IN 2018.
RETURNING TO MONETARY POLICY, AS
I SAID, THE COMMITTEE MAINTAINS
ITS TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE.
THIS DECISION REFLECTS THE
COMMITTEE'S CAREFUL APPROACH IN
SETTING MONETARY POLICY,
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE
MIXED READINGS ON THE LABOR
MARKET AND ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT
I HAVE DISCUSSED, AS WELL AS
CONTINUING BELOW TARGET
INFLATION.
PROCEEDING CAUTIOUSLY IN RAISING
OUR INTEREST-RATE TARGET WILL
ALLOW US TO VERIFY THAT ECONOMIC
GROWTH WILL RETURN TO A MODERATE
PACE, THAT THE LABOR MARKET WILL
STRENGTHEN FURTHER, AND
INFLATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE
PROGRESS TOWARD OUR 2% OBJECTIVE
.
CAUTION IS ALL THE MORE
APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE SHORT-TERM
INTEREST RATES ARE STILL NEAR
ZERO, WHICH MEANS MONETARY
POLICY CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY
RESPOND TO SURPRISINGLY STRONG
INFLATION PRESSURES IN THE
FUTURE THAN TO A WEAKENING LABOR
MARKET AND FALLING INFLATION.
ALTHOUGH THE FINANCIAL MARKET
STRESSES THAT EMANATED ABROAD
THAT STARTED THIS YEAR HAVE
EASED, VULNERABILITIES IN THE
GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAIN.
IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF
SLUGGISH GLOBAL GROWTH, LOW
INFLATION, AND ALREADY VERY
ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICY IN
MANY ADVANCED ECONOMIES,
INVESTOR PERCEPTIONS OF AND
APPETITE FOR RISK, CAN CHANGE
ABRUPTLY.
AS OUR STATEMENT NOTES, WE WILL
CONTINUE TO CLOSELY -- MONITOR
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS.
WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT THE
EVOLUTION OF THE ECONOMY WILL
WARRANT ONLY GRADUAL INCREASES
IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.
WE EXPECT THE RATE TO REMAIN FOR
SOME TIME BELOW LEVELS THAT ARE
ANTICIPATED TO PREVAIL IN THE
LONGER RUN BECAUSE HEADWINDS
WEIGHING ON THE ECONOMY MEAN THE
INTEREST RATE NEEDED TO KEEP THE
ECONOMY OPERATING NEAR ITS
POTENTIAL IS LOW BY HISTORICAL
STANDARDS.
THESE HEADWINDS, WHICH INCLUDE
DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD, SUBDUED
HOUSEHOLD FORMATION, AND MEAGER
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH COULD
PERSIST FOR SOME TIME.
BUT IF THEY GRADUALLY FADE OVER
THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AS WE EXPECT
, THEN THE INTEREST RATE
REQUIRED TO KEEP THE ECONOMY
OPERATING AT AN EVEN KEEL SHOULD
MOVE HIGHER AS WELL.
THIS VIEW IS CONSISTENT WITH
PARTICIPANTS PROJECTIONS OF
APPROPRIATE MONETARY POLICY.
THE MEDIAN PROJECTION FOR THE
FEDERAL FUNDS RATE RISES ONLY
GRADUALLY TO 1.5% AT THE END OF
NEXT YEAR, AND 2.5% BY THE END
OF 2018, SOMEWHAT BELOW ITS
ESTIMATED LONGER RUN NORMAL
LEVEL.
ALTHOUGH THE MEDIAN FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE AT THE END OF THIS
YEAR IS UNCHANGED FROM MARCH,
THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS
REVISED DOWN THEIR PROJECTIONS.
42017 AND 2018, THE MEDIAN
PROJECTION IS 1.25% TO 1.5
PERCENTAGE POINTS BELOW MARCH,
ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH THE 1.25
PERCENTAGE POINT DOWNWARD
REVISION MADE TO THE ESTIMATED
LONGER RUN LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL
FUNDRAISER.
AS I HAVE NOTED ON.
OCCASIONS, PARTICIPANTS
PROJECTIONS FOR THE FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE, INCLUDING THE MEDIAN
PATH, ARE NOT A FIXED PLAN FOR
FUTURE POLICY.
POLICY IS NOT AN A PRESET CORE
-- COURSE.
THESE FORECASTS REPRESENT
PARTICIPANTS INDIVIDUAL
ASSESSMENTS OF APPROPRIATE
POLICY, GIVEN THEIR PROJECTIONS
OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, EMPLOYMENT,
INFLATION, AND OTHER FACTORS.
HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS
INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, SO EACH
PARTICIPANT'S ASSESSMENT OF
APPROPRIATE POLICY IS ALSO
NECESSARILY UNCERTAIN,
ESPECIALLY AT LONGER TIME
HORIZONS, AND WILL CHANGE IN
RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND ASSOCIATED
RISKS.
FINALLY, THE COMMITTEE WILL
CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF
REINVESTING PROCEEDS FROM
MATURING TREASURY SECURITIES AND
PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY
DEBT AND MORTGAGE BACKED
SECURITIES.
AS HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR POLICY
STATEMENT, WE ANTICIPATE
CONTINUING THIS POLICY UNTIL
NORMALIZATION OF THE LEVEL OF
THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IS WELL
UNDERWAY.
MAINTAINING OUR SIZABLE HOLDINGS
LONGER-TERM SECURITIES SHOULD
HELP TO MAINTAIN ACCOMMODATIVE
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND SHOULD
REDUCE THE RISK THAT WE MAY HAVE
TO LOWER THE FEDERAL FUND RATE
20, IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE
LARGE, ADVERSE SHOCK.
THANK YOU.
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR
QUESTIONS.
>> ONE OF THE BIG UNCERTAINTIES
HANGING OVER MARKETS IS THE VOTE
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM NEXT WEEK.
HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR WAS THAT IN
TODAY'S DECISION, RELATIVE TO
THE QUESTIONS YOU ELUCIDATED
ABOUT THE JOBS AND INFLATION
DATA, AND COULD YOU TALK ABOUT
THE CHANNELS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF A BREXIT
ON THE U.S. ECONOMY?
CHAIR YELLEN: WELL, BREXIT, THE
UPCOMING DECISION ON WHETHER TO
LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION, IS
SOMETHING WE DISCUSSED.
I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY IT IS
ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT FACTORED
INTO TODAY'S DECISIONS.
CLEARLY, THIS IS A VERY
IMPORTANT DECISION FOR THE
UNITED KINGDOM AND FOR EUROPE.
IT IS A DECISION THAT COULD HAVE
CONSEQUENCES FOR ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN GLOBAL
FINANCIAL MARKETS.
IF IT DOES SO, IT COULD HAVE
CONSEQUENCES IN TURN FOR THE
U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK THAT WOULD
BE A FACTOR IN DECIDING ON THE
APPROPRIATE PATH OF POLICY.
IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE
UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE DISCUSSED
AND THAT FACTORED INTO TODAY'S
DECISION.
>> THE FED'S OUTLOOK FOR RATES
HAS BEEN COMING DOWN SHARPLY,
BUT HAS BEEN COMING DOWN OVER
TIME, ALMOST A FULL PERCENTAGE
POINT IN SOME CASES, COMPARED TO
A YEAR AGO.
YET THE GDP OUTLOOK REMAINS THE
SAME.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST
QUARTER TO THE COMMITTEE'S
OUTLOOK TO BRING DOWN RATE SO
MUCH, NOW JUST 2.4%, AND FURTHER
FROM THE LONG RUN THAN IT WAS IN
THE PRIOR ESTIMATE THAT WAS OUT
THERE.
HAS THERE BEEN A DRAMATIC CHANGE
IN THE COMMITTEE'S VIEW ON THE
RELATIONSHIP OF GDP TO RATES,
AND MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHY
THE FED KEEPS HAVING TO LOWER
THE RATE AND GETTING THE
FORECAST WRONG.
CHAIR YELLEN: AS I MENTIONED IN
MY OPENING REMARKS, THERE IS
REALLY A GREAT DEAL OF
UNCERTAINTY AROUND EACH
INDIVIDUAL'S ASSESSMENT OF THE
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RATES,
PARTICULARLY AS WE GO FURTHER
OUT IN THE FORECAST HORIZON, AND
WHEN WE COME TO THE LONG-TERM.
I THINK WHAT WE CAN SEE, WHAT
MANY STUDIES SHOW, IS THE
SO-CALLED NEUTRAL RATE, MAINLY,
THE LEVEL OF THE FED FUNDS RATE
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
ECONOMY GROWING ROUGHLY AT
TRENDS AND OPERATING AT FULL
EMPLOYMENT.
THAT RATE IS QUITE DEPRESSED BY
HISTORICAL STANDARDS.
MANY ESTIMATES WOULD PUT IT IN
REAL OR INFLATION-ADJUSTED TERMS
NEAR ZERO.
THE PATH THAT YOU SEE IN THE DOT
PLOT FOR RATES OVER TIME IS
IMPORTANTLY INFLUENCED.
THERE IS A ACCOMMODATION.
AS WE ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES, I
THINK, MOST PARTICIPANTS FEEL
THE ACCOMMODATION IN THE CURRENT
STANCE OF POLICY NEEDS TO BE
GRADUALLY REMOVED.
BUT A VERY IMPORTANT INFLUENCE
IN THE OUT YEARS IS WHAT WILL
HAPPEN TO THAT NEUTRAL RATE THAT
WILL JUST KEEP THE ECONOMY
OPERATING ON AN EVEN KEEL.
I HAVE OFTEN COME IN MY
STATEMENTS AND REMARKS, TALKED
ABOUT HEADWINDS THAT REFLECT THE
LINGERING AFFECTS OF THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS.
TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE
HEADWINDS, I THINK, MANY OF US
EXPECT THESE HEADWINDS WOULD
GRADUALLY DIMINISH OVER TIME.
THAT IS A REASON WHY YOU SEE THE
UPWARD PATH FOR RATES.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO MORE
LONG-LASTING OR PERSISTENT
FACTORS THAT MAY BE AT WORK THAT
ARE HOLDING DOWN THE LONGER RUN
LEVEL OF NEUTRAL RATES.
FOR EXAMPLE, SLOW PRODUCTIVITY
GROWTH, WHICH IS NOT JUST A U.S.
PHENOMENON, BUT A GLOBAL
PHENOMENON.
OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A LOT OF
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT WILL
HAPPEN TO PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH,
BUT PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH COULD
STAY ALONG FOR SOME TIME.
WE HAVE AN AGING SOCIETY IN MANY
PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT COULD
DEPRESS THIS NEUTRAL RATE.
I THINK ALL OF US ARE INVOLVED
IN A PROCESS OF CONSTANTLY
REEVALUATING WHERE IS THAT
NEUTRAL RATE GOING.
WHAT YOU SEE IS A DOWNWARD SHIFT
IN THE ASSESSMENT OVERTIME IN
THE SENSE THAT MAYBE MORE OF
WHAT IS CAUSING THIS NEUTRAL
RICK TO BE LOW, ARE FACTORS THAT
WILL NOT BE DISAPPEARING, BUT
WILL BE PART OF THE NEW NORMAL.
YOU STILL SEE AN ASSESSMENT THAT
THE NEUTRAL RATE WILL MOVE UP
SOMEWHAT, BUT IT HAS BEEN COMING
DOWN, AND I THINK IT CONTINUES
TO BE MARKED LOWER.
AND IT IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN.
>> THE MEDIAN PARTICIPANT
FORECAST FOR THE FED FUNDS ARE
FOR 2017, 2018 CAME DOWN QUITE
DRAMATICALLY.
THIS STANDS IN CONTRAST WITH THE
2016 MEETING FORECAST.
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE WERE SIX
PARTICIPANTS WHO SAW ONLY ONE
RATE HIKE THIS YEAR.
CAN YOU COMMENT ON WHAT IT WOULD
TAKE FOR TWO RATE INCREASES TO
BE THE LIKELY OR APPROPRIATE
POLICY PATH?
ABOUT THIS DISCONNECT BETWEEN
THE MEDIAN VIEW AND THE VIEW OF,
SAY, THE VOTING MEMBERS OF THE
COMMITTEE -- IF THERE IS ONE, I
SHOULD ADD.
CHAIR YELLEN: I AM NOT GOING TO
COMMENT ON PARTICIPANTS VERSUS
VOTERS.
YOU KNOW, MONETARY POLICY, THE
COMMITTEE FEELS MONETARY POLICY,
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVERAL
YEARS, WE SHOULD SHOW THE PUBLIC
OF THE VIEWS ARE OF ALL THE
PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMMITTEE,
ESPECIALLY GIVEN VOTING ROTATES
EVERY YEAR.
THAT IS A DECISION WE MADE.
BUT YOU ASKED ME WHAT IT WOULD
TAKE TO HAVE TWO INCREASES.
THE COMMITTEE, AS A WHOLE, NEVER
DISCUSSES HOW MANY INCREASES WE
SHOULD HAVE THIS YEAR OR NEXT
YEAR.
THAT IS NOT A DECISION WE ARE
MAKING AS A COMMITTEE.
WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON A
MEETING BY MEETING BASIS AND
TRYING TO GIVE A SENSE TO THE
PUBLIC OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING
FOR AND WHAT THE BASIS OF A
DECISION WILL BE.
AS I INDICATED, FIRST OF ALL,
INTERNATIONAL UNCERTAINTIES LOOM
LARGE HERE.
WE MENTIONED BREXIT, THE U.K.
DECISION, OBVIOUSLY, HOW THAT
TURNS OUT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL
FACTOR INTO FUTURE DECISIONS.
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE
PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
AND CONTINUED PROGRESS IN THE
LABOR MARKET.
THE FORECAST THAT YOU SEE IN THE
SCP AND STATEMENT INDICATES THE
COMMITTEE EXPECTS TO HAVE
MODERATE GROWTH, 2% GROWTH
SUGGESTS HEALTHY GROWTH FOR THE
REST OF THE YEAR AND A PICKUP IN
GROWTH FOR THE SECOND QUARTER.
WE EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUING
PROGRESS IN THE LABOR MARKET.
WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
GROWTH OUTLOOK, BECAUSE WE DID
SEE SLOWER GROWTH IN THE FOURTH
QUARTER AND IN THE FIRST
QUARTER.
WITH RESPECT TO THE SLOWDOWN,
THAT SEEMED TO BE OUT OF LINE
WITH FUNDAMENTALS.
WE EXPECTED IT TO PICK UP AND WE
HAVE SEEN GOOD EVIDENCE THAT IT
HAS PICKED UP.
BUT NOW THE LABOR MARKET APPEARS
TO HAVE SLOWED DOWN.
WE NEED TO ASSURE OURSELVES THAT
THE UNDERLYING MOMENTUM IN THE
ECONOMY HAS NOT DIMINISHED.
AS I SAID, WE WILL BE CAREFULLY
ASSESSING DATA ON THE LABOR
MARKET TO MAKE SURE JOB GAINS
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH A
PACE SUFFICIENT TO RESULT IN
FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF THE LABOR
MARKET.
WE WILL BE WATCHING THE SPENDING
DATA TO MAKE SURE GROWTH IS
PICKING UP IN LINE WITH OUR
EXPECTATIONS.
OF COURSE, WITH RESPECT TO
INFLATION, WE ARE CONSTANTLY
EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT
INCOMING INFORMATION IS ROUGHLY
IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS.
SO WE WILL BE EVALUATING THAT AT
EVERY MEETING.
EVERY MEETING IS LIVE.
WE COULD MAKE A DECISION AT ANY
MEETING TO ADJUST THE FUNDS RATE
.
THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
WE WILL WANT TO SEE TO MAKE SUCH
DECISIONS.
>> THE FED CREATED A LABOR
MARKET CONDITIONS INDEX FOR
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT WAS
DESIGNED TO BRING TOGETHER A LOT
OF THESE FACTORS.
I AM SURE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT
HAS BEEN FALLING SINCE JANUARY.
THAT SUGGEST TO SOME PEOPLE THAT
IT WAS YOUR DECISION TO RAISE
RATES IN DECEMBER THAT HAS
CAUSED THIS WEAKENING IN THE
LABOR MARKET.
COULD YOU ADDRESS WHAT ROLE, IF
ANY, THE FES DECISION TO RAISE
RATES PLAYED IN THE SNOW AND WE
ARE NOW SEEING?
CHAIR YELLEN: LET ME SAY, THE
LABOR MARKETS INDEX IS KIND OF
AN EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT THAT IS
A SUMMARY MEASURE OF MANY
DIFFERENT INDICATORS.
ESSENTIALLY, THAT MEASURE TRIES
TO ASSESS THE CHANGE IN LABOR
MARKET CONDITIONS.
AS I LOOK AT IT, AS THE INDEX
LOOKS AT THINGS, THE STATE OF
THE LABOR MARKET IS STILL
HEALTHY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN
SOMETHING OF A LOSS OF MOMENTUM.
THE 200,000 JOBS A MONTH WE SAW
IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR
, THAT SLOWED IN RECENT MONTHS.
EXACTLY WHAT THE REASONS ARE FOR
THAT SLOWING, IT IS DIFFICULT TO
SAY.
AGAIN, WE SHOULD NEVER PAY TOO
MUCH ATTENTION, FOR EXAMPLE, TO
ONE JOB MARKET REPORT.
WE OFTEN SEE LARGE REVISIONS.
WE SHOULD NOT OVERLOAD THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF ONE DATA POINT.
ESPECIALLY WHEN OTHER INDICATORS
IN THE MARKET ARE STILL FLASHING
GREEN.
INITIAL CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT
INSURANCE REMAIN LOW.
PERCEPTIONS OF THE LABOR MARKET
REMAIN FINE.
DATA FROM THE JOB OPENINGS
CONTINUES TO REACH NEW HIGHS.
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF INCOMING
DATA THAT DOES SIGNAL CONTINUED
PROGRESS AND STRENGTH IN THE
LABOR MARKET.
BUT AS I SAID, IT DOES BEAR
WATCHING.
THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT FEEL AND
DOES NOT EXPECT, I DO NOT EXPECT
THAT LABOR MARKET PROGRESS HAS
COME TO AN END.
WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE CLEAR TO
THE PUBLIC, AND THROUGH OUR
ACTIONS, AND THROUGH THE
REVISIONS YOU SEE OVER TIME IN
THE DOT PLOTS, WE DO NOT HAVE A
FIXED PLAN FOR RAISING RATES
OVER TIME.
WE LOOK AT INCOMING DATA AND ARE
PREPARED TO ADJUST OUR VIEWS TO
KEEP THE ECONOMY ON TRACK.
IN LIGHT OF THAT DATA DEPENDENCE
OF OUR POLICY, I REALLY DO NOT
THINK A SINGLE RATE INCREASE OF
25 BASIS POINTS IN DECEMBER HAS
HAD MUCH SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE
OUTLOOK, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO
ADJUST OUR THINKING IN LIGHT OF
INCOMING DATA IN WHATEVER
DIRECTION IS APPROPRIATE.
>> I WANT TO COME BACK TO THESE
LONGER RUN RATE REDUCTIONS YOU
HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT.
YIELDS ON 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTES
HAVE FALLEN BELOW 1.6%.
5-YEAR NOTE'S, NEAR 1%.
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD, IN
GERMANY AND JAPAN, LONG-TERM
BOND YIELDS ARE NEGATIVE.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS LOW
LEVEL OF LONG-TERM BOND YIELDS,
AND DOESN'T GIVE YOU ANY PAUSE
IN LOOKING AT YOUR OWN
PROJECTIONS, COMING TO A
CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THOSE
PROJECTIONS ARE POSSIBLY STILL
WAY TOO HIGH, AND THE BOND
MARKET IS AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL?
CHAIR YELLEN: I THINK THE LEVELS
OF LONGER-TERM RATES REFLECT
ESSENTIALLY TWO THINGS.
ONE IS MARKET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM RATES, IF
WE ARE CONSIDERING A 10-YEAR
TREASURY SECURITY, WHAT WOULD BE
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM RATES
OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS?
THE SECOND FACTOR IS THE
SO-CALLED TERM PREMIUM, OR THE
EXTRA YIELD THAT INVESTORS
DEMAND IN ORDER TO HOLD A
LONGER-TERM SECURITY, INSTEAD OF
TO INVEST SHORT-TERM.
CLEARLY, MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR
THE PATH OF SHORT-TERM INTEREST
RATES OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS
REMAIN LOW.
THAT IS A FACTOR, THAT IS AN
IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT, I THINK,
HOLDING DOWN THE LEVEL OF
LONGER-TERM YIELDS.
PERHAPS AS IMPORTANT, OR MAYBE
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, THE TERM
PREMIUM IS ALSO LOW AND HAS ALSO
PROBABLY COME DOWN.
WHEN WE ENGAGED IN LONGER-TERM
ASSET PURCHASES, OUR VERY
PURPOSE IN DOING THAT WAS TO
DRIVE DOWN LONGER-TERM YIELDS BY
MAKING THESE ASSETS SCARCER,
MORE VALUABLE TO THE PUBLIC THAT
WANTS TO INVEST IN LONGER-TERM
SECURITIES.
WE WERE CONSCIOUSLY ATTEMPTING
TO DRIVE DOWN THAT PREMIUM.
WE CONTINUE TO HOLD A LARGE
QUANTITY OF THOSE SECURITIES,
BUT WE ARE NOT ADDING TO THEM.
IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE
ECB, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BANK OF
JAPAN, ARE ALSO ENGAGING IN
QUANTITATIVE EASING, BUYING
LONGER-TERM ASSETS, AND PUSHING
DOWN THOSE TERM PREMIUM.
I THINK THOSE ARE VERY LOW, AS
WELL AS THE EXPECTED PATH OF
SHORT RATES.
>> 
>> I WANT TO SAY AGAIN, WE ARE
QUITE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHERE
RATES ARE HEADING IN THE
LONGER-TERM.
WE WRITE DOWN OUR BEST
ESTIMATES.
AT THIS TIME, OF WHAT IS A
LONGER THAN NORMAL RUN OF THE
FEDERAL UNDERRATE -- FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE.
THERE IS GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN
THAT NUMBER.
AS I SAID, WE HAVE GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE THIS SO-CALLED
NEUTRAL RATE, RATE COMPATIBLE
WITH THE ECONOMY OPERATING AT
FULL EMPLOYMENT IS LOW AT THE
PRESENT TIME.
MANY OF US BELIEVE AS A BASE
CASE IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME
THOSE RATES WILL MOVE UP OVER
TIME, BUT WE ARE NOT CERTAIN OF
THAT.
IT IS ONE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES.
THERE COULD BE REVISIONS IN
EITHER DIRECTION.
THUS FAR, IN RECENT TIMES,
REVISIONS HAVE MAINLY BEEN IN A
DOWNWARD DIRECTION.
THE IDEA THAT A LOAN NEUTRAL
RATE MAY BE CLOSER TO THE NEW
NORMAL.
BUT YOU DO STILL SEE SOME
REVERSIONS.
SO WE ARE REALLY QUITE UNCERTAIN
ABOUT THAT.
>> IN YOUR SPEECH IN
PHILADELPHIA, YOU CALL THE
SLOWDOWN IN JOB GROWTH LAST
MONTH CONCERNING.
YOU MENTIONED TODAY THAT YOU
WANT TO VERIFY THE UNDERLYING
MOMENTUM IN THE ECONOMY AND
LABOR MARKET IS CONTINUING.
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO SEE TO
CONVINCE YOU THAT THE LABOR
MARKET IS STILL MOVING TOWARD
FULL EMPLOYMENT, AND HOW LONG DO
YOU SEE IT?
CHAIR YELLEN: I CANNOT GIVE YOU
A FORMULA, I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE A NUMBER THAT IS A
CUT OFF FOR WHAT WE NEED TO SEE
IN A PARTICULAR REPORT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
INDICATORS OF THE LABOR MARKET.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE LABOR MARKET
CONDITIONS INDEX HAS 19
DIFFERENT INDICATORS.
CLEARLY, WE WILL BE LOOKING AT
THE NEXT JOBS REPORT.
IF WE WERE TO SEE A HEALTHY PACE
OF JOB GROWTH, ABOVE THAT NEEDED
TO KIND OF MAINTAIN THE STATUS
QUO IN THE LABOR MARKET.
I SHOULD SAY, OVER TIME, WE
SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE, AS THE
ECONOMY COMES CLOSER TO MAXIMUM
EMPLOYMENT, THE LIKELY PACE OF
JOB GAINS IS PROBABLY GOING TO
SLOW DOWN SOMEWHAT.
WE HAVE SEEN SOME SLOWING.
BUT THE RECENT COUPLE OF MONTHS
WAS VERY LOW, AND ARGUABLY NOT
EVEN AT THE PACE WE NEED TO SEE
TO MAINTAIN STABLE LABOR MARKET
CONDITIONS.
WE WANT TO SEE AN ADEQUATE PACE
OF JOB CREATION.
THERE MIGHT BE REVISIONS TO
PREVIOUS MONTHS IF WE CHANGE OUR
VIEWS, BUT THERE WILL BE OTHER
SURVEYS OF EMPLOYMENT INTENTIONS
, OTHER INDICATORS OF THE LABOR
MARKET THAT WE WILL BE FOCUSING
ON.
THERE IS NO FORMULA FOR WHAT IT
TAKES, BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT
THE LABOR MARKET.
>> ALSO IN PHILADELPHIA, YOU DID
NOT SAY THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY
BE APPROPRIATE FOR A RATE HIKE
TO OCCUR IN THE COMING MONTHS.
DID YOU INTENTIONALLY LEAVE THAT
OUT?
CHAIR YELLEN: YOU KNOW, WE DO
NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS
SUFFICIENT MOMENTUM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TIMETABLE
WILL BE TO GAIN THAT ASSURANCE.
EVERY MEETING IS LIVE.
THERE IS NO MEETING THAT IS OFF
THE TABLE, THAT NO MEETING IS
OUT, IN TERMS OF A POSSIBLE RATE
INCREASE.
BUT WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT
THE DATA.
I CANNOT PRE-SPECIFY A
TIMETABLE.
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE TO SAY IT
IS IN THE NEXT MEETING OR TWO,
BUT IT COULD BE.
NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT BY
JULY, FOR EXAMPLE, WE WOULD SEE
DATA THAT LEAD US TO BELIEVE
THAT WE ARE IN A PERFECTLY FINE
COURSE, AND THAT DATA WAS AN
ABERRATION AND OTHER CONCERNS IN
THE PAST.
>> WE ARE IN ELECTION SEASON.
IN THE PAST, THE FED HAS BEEN
SENSITIVE TO MAKING POLICY
CHANGES IN ELECTION YEARS.
YOU HAVE THREE MORE MEETING
BEFORE THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION.
COULD YOU COMMENT ON WHETHER OR
NOT THE ELECTION WILL COME INTO
PLAY, AND ANY CONCERN THAT IF
YOU CHANGE POLICY AHEAD OF THE
ELECTION -- BASED ON YOUR
FORECAST TODAY, YOU COULD -- ARE
YOU CONCERNED THAT THAT COULD
LEAD TO CHARGES THAT THE FED IS
TRYING TO CHANGE POLICY TO
INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF THE
ELECTION?
BECAUSE IF IT HAS BEEN SENSITIVE
TO THAT IN THE PAST.
CHAIR YELLEN: WE ARE VERY
FOCUSED ON ASSESSING THE
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND MAKING
CHANGES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE
WITHOUT TAKING POLITICS INTO
ACCOUNT.
LOOK, IF THE INCOMING DATA WERE,
IN THE COMING MONTHS, TO JUSTIFY
THE KIND OF GRADUAL INCREASES
THAT WE HAVE LONG DISCUSSED,
THAT WE SEE IS APPROPRIATE IN
LIGHT OF THE OUTLOOK, I THINK
MARKETS SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
BY SUCH A DECISION, IF WE MAKE
IT.
IT IS OBVIOUSLY CONSISTENT WITH
THE DATA WE HAVE SEEN AND THE
COMPANY WILL FEEL APPROVED --
FREE TO MOVE IN THE COMING
MONTHS IF APPROPRIATE.
>> YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR REMARKS
THAT WE ARE GETTING A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT SIGNAL WHEN YOU LOOK
AT INFLATION VERSUS INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS.
COULD YOU DETAIL WHICH YOU LOOK
AT AND WEIGHT MORE?
ARE YOU FOCUSING ON THE PICKUP
IN INFLATION?
CHAIR YELLEN: WE ARE LOOKING AT
BOTH.
WITH RESPECT TO THE BEHAVIOR OF
INFLATION, INFLATION IS BEHAVING
ROUGHLY IN THE MANNER I WOULD
HAVE EXPECTED.
I WAS REALLY NOT SEEING
SIGNIFICANT SURPRISES THERE.
WE HAVE LONG SAID, AN IMPORTANT
REASON INFLATION IS AS LOW AS IT
HAS BEEN, IS BECAUSE OF PAST
DECLINES IN ENERGY PRICES,
INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE
DOLLAR.
AS THOSE FACTORS BEGIN TO
DISSIPATE, WE WOULD SEE
INFLATION MOVING UP.
NOW THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE
SEEING.
THAT IS IN LINE WITH OUR
THINKING AND WITH THE DATA.
THOSE THINGS HAVE STABILIZED.
THEIR INFLUENCE IS DISSIPATING.
WITH RESPECT TO CORE INFLATION,
WHICH IS PARTLY INFLUENCED ALSO
BY THE DOLLAR, MUCH WRONG TO
PULL OUT THE DOLLAR IN IMPORT
RICE INFLUENCE, CORE INFLATION
SEEMS TO BE BEHAVING ROUGHLY AS
ONE WOULD EXPECT WITH WELL
ANCHORED INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
AND AN IMPROVING LABOR MARKET.
SO I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING,
INFLATION, EVEN CORE INFLATION
IS RUNNING UNDER 2%.
I CONTINUE TO THINK THE EVIDENCE
SUPPORTS A PROJECTION THAT IT
WILL MOVE UP OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF YEARS BACK TOWARD OUR
2% OBJECTIVE.
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, AND
ECONOMIC THEORIES SUGGEST,
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE
RELEVANT TO PRICE AND WAGE
SETTING DECISIONS.
SO WE DO MONITOR INDICATORS OF
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
CAREFULLY.
NOW, IT IS VERY HARD TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS ARE RELEVANT TO
ACTUAL PRICE AND WAGE DECISIONS.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE SEEN THE
MICHIGAN SURVEY, A MEASURE OF
HOUSEHOLD INFLATION,
EXPECTATIONS MOVE DOWN.
THAT IS A PRELIMINARY NUMBER.
IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO MAKE
OF IT.
WE HAVE CERTAINLY TAKEN NOTE OF
IT.
BUT SURVEY-BASED MEASURES, WHERE
FORECASTERS WERE QUERIED, HAVE
ALL BEEN STABLE.
MEASURES OF INFLATION
COMPENSATION -- I ALWAYS BEEN
CAREFUL TO CALL IT COMPENSATION
RATHER THAN EXPECTATIONS --
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS.
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS INFLUENCE
THOSE MARKET ENSURES, BUT THERE
IS ALSO AN INFLATION RISK
REVIEW.
-- PREMIUM.
THERE IS GOOD REASON TO THINK
THE INFLATION RISK PREMIUM COULD
HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AND
MAYBE DEPRESSING THOSE NUMBERS.
SO WE WATCH THEM, WE HAVE TAKEN
NOTE IN THE STATEMENT THAT THEY
HAVE MOVED DOWN.
ACTUAL INFLATION IS BEHAVING
MORE OR LESS AS WE EXPECTED.
>> WENDY APRIL MINUTES WERE
RELEASED, THEY CAUGHT MARKETS BY
SURPRISE.
THEY SEEM TO SHOW THERE WAS AN
ACTIVE DISCUSSION OF A POSSIBLE
JUNE RATE INCREASE, SOMETHING WE
HAD NOT GONE FROM THE POLICY
STATEMENT THAT WAS ISSUED RIGHT
AFTER THE MEETING.
WAS THAT A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO
HOLD BACK AND TELL US WHEN THE
MINUTES CAME OUT ABOUT THE JUNE
DISCUSSION?
IF SO, COULD YOU TELL US WHAT
SURPRISES WE COULD SEE IN THE
JUNE MINUTES?
CHAIR YELLEN: SO, THE MINUTES
ALWAYS HAVE TO BE AN ACCURATE
DISCUSSION OF WHAT HAPPENED AT
THE MEETING.
THEY ARE NOT CHANGED AFTER THE
FACT IN ORDER TO CORRECT
POSSIBLE MISCONCEPTIONS.
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF
DISCUSSIONS THAT MEETING OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING IN JUNE.
THAT APPEARED IN THE MINUTES.
I SUPPOSE, IN THE APRIL
STATEMENT, WE GAVE NO OBVIOUS H
INT OR CALENDAR-BASED SIGNAL
THAT JUNE WAS A POSSIBILITY.
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE
STATEMENT, WE POINTED TO SLOWER
GROWTH, BUT THERE WAS NO
FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR GROWTH TO
HAVE SLOWED.
WE POINTED TO FUNDAMENTALS
UNDERLYING HOUSEHOLD SPENDING
DECISIONS THAT REMAINED ON SOLID
GROUND, SUGGESTING MAYBE THIS
WAS SOMETHING TRANSITORY THAT
WOULD DISAPPEAR.
WE NOTED LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IN LINE WITH
OUR EXPECTATIONS.
WE DID DOWNGRADE SOMEWHAT OUR
EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN ABOUT THE
GLOBAL RISK ENVIRONMENT.
I DO THINK THERE WERE HINTS IN
THE APRIL STATEMENT THAT THE
COMMITTEE WAS CHANGING
INTERVIEWS OF WHAT IT WAS SEEING
.
WE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT IF WE
THINK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
INVOLVED IN LINE WITH OUR
EXPECTATIONS, THE GRADUAL AND
CAUTIOUS FURTHER INCREASES WE
EXPECT TO BE APPROPRIATE.
I SUPPOSE I WAS SOMEWHAT
SURPRISED WITH THE MARKET
INTERPRETATION OF IT.
BUT THE MINUTES OF THE APRIL
MEETING WERE AN ACCURATE SUMMARY
OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
>> THE FED HAS REPEATEDLY VOICED
ITS CONCERN OVER THE SLOW BASE
OF WAGE GROWTH.
I WAS WONDERING, DO YOU THINK
INCREASING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM
WAGE COULD BE OF ANY HELP, COULD
IT BOOST HIGHER WAGES AND
EVENTUALLY DRIVE UP INFLATION?
CHAIR YELLEN: I THINK THE
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES THAT HAVE
GONE INTO EFFECT, ESTIMATES THAT
I HAVE SEEN SUGGEST IT IS A
RELATIVELY MINOR INFLUENCE ON
THE AGGREGATE LEVEL OF WAGE
INFLATION.
I WOULD TAKE SOMEWHAT FASTER
WAGE INCREASES TO BE A SIGN THAT
LABOR MARKET SLACK IS
DIMINISHING THAN THAT THE LABOR
MARKET IS APPROACHING CONDITIONS
THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH MAXIMUM
EMPLOYMENT.
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN SOME HINTS,
PERHAPS PULMONARY INDICATIONS,
THAT WEIGHT GROWTH IS PICKING
UP.
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, I THINK IT
IS A SIGN OF A GENERALLY HEALTHY
LABOR MARKET, WHICH IS WHAT OUR
MANDATED OBJECTIVE IS, TO
ACHIEVE MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT.
SO IT WOULD BE A SYMPTOM OF IT.
>> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
DISCUSSION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
MONTHS ABOUT THE SLOW PACE OF
THE MAN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
SOME ECONOMISTS THINK CENTRAL
BANKS SHOULD YOU CAN ABOUT USING
HELICOPTER MONEY.
THEY BE IN JAPAN OR YOUR FIRST.
-- EUROPE FIRST.
THEN FORMER CHAIR BEN BERNANKE
WEIGHED IN AND SAID IT WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA TO PUT HELICOPTER
MONEY IN ITS TOOL KIT, IN THE
UNITED STATES.
I LIKE TO GET YOUR COMMENTS ON
THAT.
CHAIR YELLEN: IN NORMAL TIMES,
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE A
SEPARATION BETWEEN MONETARY AND
FISCAL POLICY.
IT IS A PRIMARY REASON FOR
INDEPENDENCE OF THE CENTRAL BANK
.
WE HAVE SEEN ALL TOO MANY
EXAMPLES OF COUNTRIES THAT END
UP WITH HIGH OR EVEN
HYPERINFLATION BECAUSE THOSE IN
CHARGE OF FISCAL POLICY,
DIRECTORS, CENTRAL-BANK, TO HELP
THEM FINANCE IT BY PRINTING
MONEY AND MAINTAINING PRICE
STABILITY AND LOW AND STABLE
INFLATION IS VERY MUCH AIDED BY
HAVING CENTRAL BANK
INDEPENDENCE.
THAT SAID, IN UNUSUAL TIMES,
WHERE THE CONCERN IS WITH VERY
WEAK GROWTH AND POSSIBLY
DEFLATION, RATHER RARE
CIRCUMSTANCES.
FIRST OF ALL, FISCAL POLICY CAN
BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL.
IT IS NATURAL THAT IF IT CAN BE
EMPLOYED, JUST AS MONETARY
POLICY IS DOING A LOT TO TRY TO
STIMULATE GROWTH, THE FISCAL
POLICY SHOULD PLAY A ROLE.
NORMALLY, YOU WOULD HOPE AN
ECONOMY WITH NO SEVERE DOWNSIDE
RISKS, MONETARY AND FISCAL
POLICY, WOULD NOT BE WORKING
ACROSS PURPOSES, BUT TOGETHER.
WHETHER OR NOT IN SUCH EXTREME
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE MIGHT BE A
CASE FOR, LET'S SAY," NATION --
CLOSE COORDINATION, WHERE THE
CENTRAL BANK PLAYS A ROLE IN
FINANCING POLICY, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT ACADEMICS ARE
DEBATING.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT ONE MAY
LEGITIMATELY CONSIDER.
I WOULD SEE THIS AS VERY
ABNORMAL, EXTREME SITUATION,
WHERE ONE NEEDS AN ALL-OUT
ATTEMPT.
EVEN THEN, IT IS A MATTER THAT
ACADEMICS ARE DEBATING, BUT ONLY
IN AN UNUSUAL SITUATION.
>> NOW THAT THE FED HAS STARTED
THE PROCESS OF RAISING RATES,
VARIOUS FED OFFICIALS HAVE SAID,
INCLUDING BEN BERNANKE, THAT THE
FED COULD GO CASH FLOW NEGATIVE
IN THIS SITUATION AS CAPITAL
LOSSES ARE TAKEN ON THE
PORTFOLIO BOND.
DO YOU SEE THIS HAPPENING, AND
WHEN MIGHT THIS HAPPEN?
CHAIR YELLEN: TALKING ABOUT OUR
INCOME GOING NEGATIVE?
IT IS CONCEIVABLE, IN A SCENARIO
WHERE GROWTH AND INFLATION
REALLY SURPRISES US TO THE
UPSIDE, THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO
RAISE SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES
SO RAPIDLY THAT THE RATES WE
WOULD BE PAYING ON RESERVES
WOULD EXCEED WHAT WE ARE EARNING
ON OUR PORTFOLIO.
EVEN THEN WE HAVE ABOUT $2
TRILLION OF LIABILITIES, MAINLY
CURRENCY, ON WHICH WE PAY NO
INTEREST.
SO THIS DOES REQUIRE AN EXTREME
SCENARIO WITH VERY RAPID
INCREASES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST
RATES.
SO IT IS CONCEIVABLE BUT QUITE
UNLIKELY THAT IT COULD HAPPEN.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF IT WERE TO
HAPPEN, WE WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMY
THAT WOULD BE DOING VERY WELL.
THIS IS PROBABLY AN ECONOMY THAT
EVERYBODY WOULD FEEL VERY
PLEASED WAS PERFORMING WELL AND
BETTER THAN EXPECTED, AND OUR
GOAL IS PRICE STABILITY AND
MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT.
WE WOULD, WE FEEL GOOD THAT WE
HAD DONE WELL IN ACHIEVING THAT.
WE USUALLY MAKE MONEY.
WE HAVE BEEN MAKING A LOT OF
MONEY IN RECENT YEARS, BUT THE
GOAL OF MONETARY POLICY IS NOT
TO MAXIMIZE OUR INCOME.
IN A VERY STRONG ECONOMY LIKE
THAT, THE TREASURY WOULD BE
SEEING A LOT OF INFLOWS IN THE
FORM OF TAX REVENUES, TOO.
>> TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU FEEL
CONSTRAINED IN RAISING INTEREST
RATES BY THE LOW OR EVEN
NEGATIVE RATES THAT FOREIGN
CENTRAL BANKS ARE PURSUING,
POSSIBLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR WHAT
IT MIGHT MEAN FOR THE DOLLAR
EXCHANGE RATE?
IF THAT IS A CONSTRAINT, TO WHAT
EXTENT MIGHT YOU ALSO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT
LONG-RANGE OF LOW DOMESTIC RATES
ON POSSIBLY DISTORTING DOMESTIC
MARKETS?
CHAIR YELLEN: THE STATE OF
FOREIGN ECONOMIES, BOTH THEIR
GROWTH OUTLOOKS AND THEIR STANCE
OF MONETARY POLICY, THOSE ARE
FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE U.S.
OUTLOOK AND INFLUENCE THE
APPROPRIATE STANCE OF MONETARY
POLICY.
SO OF COURSE, WE DO LOOK AT
FOREIGN RATES, THE PROSPECTS,
AND THE PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH IN
THOSE ECONOMIES IN CONSIDERING
THE STANCE OF POLICY.
DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN COUNTRIES
IN THE LIKELY POLICY PADS DO
TEND TO SPILLOVER INTO EXCHANGE
RATES.
THAT IS A STANDARD PART OF HOW
MONETARY POLICY WORKS.
A STRONGER DOLLAR DOES HAVE BOTH
A DEPRESSING EFFECT, THEY CREATE
CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH DOMESTIC
DEMAND IS DEPRESSED.
AT THE MOMENT, FOR QUITE SOME
TIME, AND PROBABLY GOING
FORWARD, NET EXPORTS WILL
PROBABLY BE A DRAG ON U.S.
GROWTH.
SO THAT IS A FACTOR WE TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT.
INCREASES IN THE DOLLAR THAT WE
HAVE SEEN SINCE MID-2014 HAVE
SERVED TO PUSH INFLATION DOWN AS
WELL, CAN ALSO HAVE IMPACTS ON
COMMODITY PRICES THAT ARE
RELEVANT.
IT IS CERTAINLY RELEVANT TO THE
STANCE OF U.S. MONETARY POLICY,
AND A FACTOR, BUT ONE SAYS A
CONSTRAINT, I WOULD NOT GO AS
FAR TO SAY THAT IT IS A
CONSTRAINT ON MONETARY POLICY.
WHEN WE HAVE AN OUTLOOK OR
CONTINUING ABOVE TREND GROWTH,
HOLDING RATES ABSOLUTELY FLAT,
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
INFLATION WOULD OVERSHOOT OUR
TARGET, WE WOULD SEE A CASE TO
GRADUALLY RAISE RATES OVER TIME.
AT THE MOMENT, I THINK, MARKETS
EXPECT -- AND THIS IS FACTORED
INTO MARKET PRICES -- A GRADUAL
PATH TO RATE INCREASES OVER
TIME.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WERE TO SEE
UPSIDE SURPRISES TO GROWTH AND
INFLATION, AND HAD TO RAISE
SHORT-TERM RATES FASTER THAN WE
THOUGHT WE SHOULD, ONE OF THE
CHANNELS BY WHICH THAT WOULD
WORK WOULD BE THE ASSOCIATED
IMPACT ON THE DOLLAR.
THAT IS A STANDARD CHANNEL
THROUGH WHICH THE MONETARY
POLICY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM
WORKS, AND WE WOULD TAKE THAT
INTO ACCOUNT, AND WOULD NOT FEEL
CONSTRAINED.
THAT WOULD BE PART OF HOW IT
WOULD WORK.
>> HOW MUCH ARE YOU WATCHING OIL
PRICES AND THEIR IMPACT ON
INFLATION, AND HOW THAT COULD
AFFECT THE TIMING OF FUTURE RATE
INCREASES, AND HOW MUCH YOU
MIGHT INCREASE RATE?
CHAIR YELLEN: OIL PRICES HAVE
HAD MANY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON
THE ECONOMY.
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING OIL PRICES
CLOSELY.
AS YOU SAID, FALLING OIL PRICES
HOLD DOWN INFLATION -- PULL DOWN
INFLATION.
IT TAKES FALLING OIL PRICES TO
LOWER INFLATION ON A SUSTAINED
BASIS.
ONCE THEY STABILIZE, AT WHATEVER
LEVEL, THEIR IMPACT ON INFLATION
DISSIPATE OVER TIME.
SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THAT
HAPPENING.
NOT ONLY HAVE THEY STABILIZE,
THEY HAVE MOVED UP SOME.
THEIR IMPACT ON INFLATION IS
WANING OVER TIME.
BUT OIL PRICES HAVE ALSO HAD A
VERY SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE AFFECT
ON DRILLING AND MINING ACTIVITY
THAT HAS LED TO WEAKNESS IN
INVESTMENT SPENDING AND JOB LOSS
AND MANUFACTURING, OBVIOUSLY, IN
THE ENERGY OR.
-- SECTOR.
IT HAS DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR DIFFERENT
SECT HERS.
FOR AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS, IT HAS
BEEN A BOON.
WE HAVE ESTIMATED SINCE 2014,
THE DECLINE IN ENERGY PRICES,
OIL PRICES, HAS PROBABLY
RESULTED IN GAINS OF ABOUT $1400
PER U.S. HOUSEHOLD.
THAT HAS HAD AN OUTSTANDING
POSITIVE IMPACT ON SPENDING.
BUT IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE
WORLD THAT ARE IMPORTANT
COMMODITY EXPORTERS, THE DECLINE
WE HAVE SEEN IN OIL PRICES HAS
HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT ON THEIR
GROWTH, THEIR TRADE WITH US, AND
OTHER TRADE PARTNERS, AND CAUSED
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE HAD
SPILLOVERS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AS WELL.
SO IT IS A COMPLICATED PICTURE.
TOM: THE CHAIR GETTING MORE
PRACTICE AT HER PRESS
CONFERENCE.
MICHAEL MCKEE HAS ATTENDED 432
OF THESE BACK TO ALEXANDER
HAMILTON.
YOU ARE NOT IN A BROADWAY PLAY.
MIKE: YOU DID NOT HAVE TO PAY
THAT KIND OF MONEY TO GET IN
THAT.
TOM: HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM
MARIO DRAGHI'S PRESS CONFERENCE?
MIKE: VERY MUCH THE SAME.
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO ASK A
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION BUT PEOPLE
ARE FOCUSING ON THE IMPLICATIONS
OF IT.
THAT BECOMES AN ISSUE WHEN A
MEETING WITH JULY IS ON THE
TABLE.
SHE TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE,
PROBABLY NOT FOR ECONOMIC
REASONS TODAY, BUT THERE ARE
PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY SHOULD
HAVE THESE EVERY DAY.
TOM: LET'S WELCOME BACK OUR
AUDIENCE.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IN ASIA,
CERTAINLY LISTENING IN A VERY
INTERESTING EUROPE AS WELL.
YOU ARE WATCHING AND LISTENING
TO BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND
BLOOMBERG RADIO.
I AM TALKING WITH MICHAEL MCKEE.
LET'S DO A QUICK DATA CHECK
BEFORE WE GET TO OUR ESTEEMED
GUEST.
VICE CHAIRMAN BLINDER IS
SCHEDULED TO JOIN US.
THE DATA, THE USUAL SETBACK BACK
FROM THE SHOCK AND ALL OF THE
MEETING, BUT NEVERTHELESS, THESE
ARE CHANGED SCREENS FROM ONE
POINT -- 1:45 THIS AFTERNOON.
WE WILL COME TO YEN IN A MOMENT.
105.06, STEEPENING OUT OVER THE
LAST HOUR.
THERE IS THE TWO-YEAR YIELD
AGAIN.
FULL THIS TOGETHER, ECONOMICS,
FINANCE AND INVESTMENT, WITH THE
GLOBAL LITMUS PAPER, WHICH IS
FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
WORKING WITH JAMES SWEENEY IS
SHABAB JALINOOS.
I WANT TO GO RIGHT TO THE CHART
AND THE LOOK ON DOLLAR YEN.
FOR THOSE OF YOU ON BLOOMBERG
RADIO, I WILL PUT THIS OUT.
THIS IS A CHART THAT MANY OF OUR
VIEWERS AND LISTENERS KNOW.
JAPAN WANTS A WEAKER YEN.
A GOOD PART OF A STRONGER YEN IS
CHAIR YELLEN.
IS CHAIR YELLEN THE CENTRAL
BANKER TO THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN?
>> WE GET TO SEE TONIGHT, I
GUESS, WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE
BOJ'S OWN INTEREST-RATE READING
-- MEETING.
MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT IS
THE POINT OF EASING NOW AHEAD OF
THE POTENTIAL BREXIT RISKS THAT
THE MARKETS ARE FACING?
POTENTIALLY SEEING A LACK OF
RESPONSE IN THE MARKETS.
AND THEN POTENTIALLY HAVING TO
EASE AGAIN.
IT IS DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT.
MIKE: JANET YELLEN DID NOTE IN
HER NEWS CONFERENCE THAT BREXIT
WAS A FACTOR IN HER
DECISION-MAKING.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL
HAPPEN.
IT IS A FACTOR IN THE TRADE
RIGHT NOW, THE UNCERTAINTY
SURROUNDING THIS?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT FX OPTIONS
MARKETS, CURRENCIES COULD BE FAR
AWAY FROM THE U.K., THEY ARE
ALSO PRICING IN QUITE A LOT OF
IMPLIED VOLATILITY OVER THE
BREXIT.
THAT IS REALLY THE ONLY ISSUE
RIGHT NOW THAT IS AFFECTING
MARKETS.
NONE OF THE FED IS OUT OF THE
WAY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
BANK OF JAPAN MEETING.
MIKE: THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES,
SUPPOSE THEY WILL TO STAY IN THE
EUROPEAN UNION.
ON JUNE 24, DOES EVERYBODY HAD
FOR THE SAME DOOR?
>> POTENTIALLY, YES.
A LOT OF INABILITY IN THE MARKET
AT THIS POINT TO PROVIDE AN, IN
TERMS OF HEDGES FOR THOSE
WORRIED ABOUT BREXIT RISK.
PRESUMABLY, MARKETS ARE
UNDERWEIGHT STERLING ASSETS,
MATERIAL WAY, EUROPEAN ASSETS
GENERALLY MORE.
IT COULD LEAD TO A RISK ON
ENVIRONMENT.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW CONCLUSIVE THE
OUTCOME IS AS WELL.
SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT A TIE VOTE
LEAD TO SOME RISK AVERSION IN
THE U.K.
BUT A CLEARER WHEN WOULD BE A
NARROW ENTRY.
TOM: WITH THE UNCERTAINTY THAT
BOB NARDELLI AND THE BUSINESS
WORLD TALK ABOUT, IS YOUR WORLD
BUSY, OR ARE YOU ALL AT THE
BEACH AND THE HAMPTONS?
MIKE: YOU HAVE TO STAY THROUGH
THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK.
>> EXACTLY.
WE DO HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE
MARKETS.
TOM: ARE PEOPLE TAKING BET
S?
>> IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY.
INVESTORS HAVE CERTAINLY TRY TO
COVER THE RISK, BUT ACTIVELY
BETTING -- IT IS HARD.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO BET
ON BREXIT RIGHT NOW, IT IS
EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT.
THE RISK PREMIUMS ARE HIGH.
NOT VERY APPEALING AT THIS POINT
TO DO ANYTHING ON THAT FRONT.
WHEN WE ARE SEEING OUR MARKET
PARTICIPANTS LOOKING AT AREAS
WHERE THEY STILL MIGHT BE CHEAP
WAYS TO PUT BETS ON BREXIT.
WE BELIEVE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN
THE CANADIAN DOLLAR IS TOO LOW.
IF YOU GET A GENERAL MARKET
DYSFUNCTION, EVEN A CURRENCY
THAT IS COMPLETELY UNRELATED
COULD SEE A LOT OF VOLATILITY.
THERE ARE STILL THESE
POSSIBILITIES ON THE SIDELINES,
BUT NOT THAT MANY.
MIKE: ERIK SCHATZKER TRADED HIS
TICKET TO "HAMILTON" TO A SEAT
AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE.
HE HAS COME OUT OF THE MEETING
NOW.
WHAT DID YOU SEE AS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING THAT SHE SAID?
ERIK: A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT
THINGS, WE CAN CERTAINLY GO
THROUGH A BUNCH OF THEM.
IT TOOK A WHILE FOR HER TO
ANSWER OR ADDRESS THE QUESTION
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE
INEVITABLY ASKING AFTER READING
THIS PIGMENT AND LOOKING AT THE
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS
AND IMPORTANTLY, THE DOT PLOT.
COULD THE FED ACTUALLY MOVE ANY
TIME DURING THE NEXT THREE
SHE WAS ADAMANT THE BAND WILL
FEEL FREE TO MOVE THE DATA
COORDINATE.
SHE SAID IT COULD BE AT THE NEXT
MEETING OR TWO AND SHE SAID, AND
I QUOTE HER, JULY IS NOT
IMPOSSIBLE.
SHE HAS BEEN SAYING THIS
CONSISTENTLY BUT IT IS CLEAR
THAT SHE WANTS TO LEAVE THE
WORLD WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT
THE BED IS A DEPENDENT, IT WILL
NOT BE SWAYED BY POLITICS, EVEN
IF THERE IS A DISORDERLY MARKET
REACTION TO A POORLY HANDLED
DEAD RIGHT LIKE -- FED RATE
HIKE.
THAT CONTINUED ALL THE WAY
THROUGH FEBRUARY 11.
ENERGY GUYS TALKING ABOUT
BREXIT.
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
SHE SAID THE BREXIT LOOMS VERY
LARGE FOR THE BED.
-- THE FED.
MIKE: HOW DID SHE SWEAR THE IDEA
--
INFLATION RISING AND
UNEMPLOYMENT STAYING ABOVE WHERE
IT IS CLOSE TO FULL EMPLOYMENT,
YET THE FED BE ON HOLD AND
LOWERING ITS FORECAST FOR RATE
INCREASES?
ERIK: JEWS ASKED THAT QUESTION A
COUPLE OF WAYS AND I DO NOT
THINK YOU COULD FIND ANYBODY IN
THAT ROOM WHO THOUGHT THE
EXPLANATION FOR THAT WAS
SATISFACTORY.
WHETHER WE ARE GOING BACK EVEN
FURTHER TO SEE HOW THE FED HAS
RATCHETED DOWN WHAT THE
EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT THE NORMAL
RATE SHOULD BE AT THE ECONOMY IS
OPERATING AT FULL EMPLOYMENT
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CRANKING
DOWN, RATCHETING DOWN ITS
EXPECTATIONS FOR INFLATION FOR
UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE SAME TIME
BUT MOST IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC
GROWTH.
I DO NOT THINK I'M ALONE AND
COMING OUT OF THAT ROOM FEELING
LIKE THAT QUESTION WAS WELL
ANSWERED.
MIKE: THE MARKET HAD TO LIKE THE
FACT THAT THE FED CAME DOWN
TOWARDS WHERE THE MARKET IS, BUT
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF
WHAT THE REACTION FUNCTION IS?
SHAHAB: WHAT THE SHOWS OF THE
IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL EVENTS.
WE HAVE WEAK GROWTH OUTSIDE OF
THE U.S. 
ALL OF THIS IS LEADING TO
INFLOWS INTO U.S. DEBT MARKETS.
AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE A
SITUATION WHERE NET TRADE HAS A
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GDP AND IF
THE DOLLAR WERE TO SURGE, THAT
YOU HAVE A FEEDBACK LOOP BACK
INTO INFLATION.
IN MY VIEW COME AT IT IS
DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW FOR THE FED
TO BE DOING ANYTHING APPROACHING
A SEQUENTIAL SERIES OF HIKES.
TOM: STARTING IN THE JAPAN
THURSDAY, TODAY IS WEDNESDAY,
RIGHT?
FOR YOU AND ME, WE ARE NOT SURE.
BUT SERIOUSLY, THIS IS A REALLY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.
WE HAVE TO OPEN IN JAPAN THAT WE
HAVE TO GO TO EUROPE.
EUROPE NEGATIVE RATES CLOSED
UGLY.
HOW WILL THEY ADAPT TO THIS
MOMENT AS THEY RECALIBRATE LESS
TO BREXIT AND MORE TO THE NEXT
MOMENT?
SHAHAB: AT THE TIME BEING IT IS
HARD TO LOOK BEYOND BREXIT, TO
BE HONEST.
THERE'S SO MUCH REQUIREMENT
RIGHT NOW TO NOT LOSE MONEY.
TOM: BRILLIANTLY SAID.
SHAHAB: IT MAKES IT HARD TO LOOK
THAT FAR OUT.
MIKE: THAT IS A BIG CHANGE FOR
PEOPLE IN THE MARKETS BECAUSE IT
WAS EASY TO MAKE MONEY, GENTLE
BANKS WERE PUMPING MONEY INTO
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
THE GOAL IS, JUST DO NOT LOSE?
SHAHAB: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
CALIBRATE JUST WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO MARKETS IN A BREXIT OUTCOME.
BUT MARKETS ARE DEFENSIVE.
YOU ARE NOT PAID A TREMENDOUS
AMOUNT OF YIELD TO TAKE RISK AT
THIS POINT IN TIME.
SO WHY DO IT?
WHY LOOK TO TAKE ON AGGRESSIVE
POSITIONS AHEAD OF AN EVENT
WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
ANALYZE?
THAT IS WHAT HAS PUT THE MARKET
IN THIS DEFENSIVE MODE WE HAVE
RIGHT NOW.
THE CURRENT STATUS IS TELLING
BANKS THINGS ARE NOT GOOD, --
TOM: I WAS SURPRISED AT THE
AMOUNT OF TALK ON THE LABOR
ECONOMY IN 60 DAYS OF LOUSY
LABOR NUMBERS.
WHAT WAS THE ENERGY IN THE PRESS
CONFERENCE BY THE BLUNT
INSTRUMENT OF PAYROLLS?
ERIK: THERE WERE A LOT OF
QUESTIONS.
WE WILL SEE TO JUSTIFY A RATE
INCREASE.
THE QUESTION MIGHT BE -- SHE
SAID ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND 18 A
POINT.
-- ONE DATA POINT.
YOU HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND A SINGLE
DATA POINT.
IF YOU HAD TO ISOLATE ONE THING
THAT JANET YELLEN SEEMS MOST
CONCERNED ABOUT, IT IS THE LABOR
MARKET, MORE SO THAN INFLATION.
SHE KEPT DOWN THESE CONCERNS
ABOUT DETERIORATING INFLATION
COMPENSATION, WHICH IS HOW SHE
DESCRIBES THINGS LIKE TIPS OR
BREAK EVENS.
SHE ALSO DID GIVE US A COUPLE
OTHER CLUES ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD
TAKE FOR THE FED TO WANT TO
RAISE RATES.
WE HAVE GOT INTO A BUNCH
DETAILED ABOUT ONE OF THEM WHICH
IS INTERNATIONAL OR EXTERNAL
DEVELOPMENTS.
BUT THE OTHER TWO WERE WORTH
POINTING OUT, WHICH WERE SUBDUED
HOUSEHOLD FORMATION AND THIRDLY,
MEAGER PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.
THOSE ARE THINGS THE FED
CONSIDER HEADWINDS.
IF THERE WAS PROGRESS ON EITHER
OF THOSE TWO FRONTS, SHE
BELIEVES WILL BLOW THROUGH RIGHT
TO JOB CREATION AND ULTIMATELY
WE WOULD SEE IT IN THE FORM OF
HIGHER INFLATION.
TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
FOCUSED ON MOVING TO JULY.
I THINK I'M GOING TO DO A DATA
CHECK HERE QUICKLY ON THE YIELD
MARKET IN WHAT WE SAW IN THE
GYRATIONS AND WONDERING WHERE
RUVELL BE TOMORROW MORNING.
THE TENURE, UNDER 160, BOBBING
AROUND BUT STILL A LOWER YIELD
ON THIS CALL.
THE DOLLAR YEN IS 106 A MOMENT
AGO.
MIKE: LET'S LOOK AT THE TWO-YEAR
YIELD.
THE YIELD CURVE IS STEEPENING A
BIT.
THE TWO-YEAR PROBABLY MORE THAN
THE 10 YEAR.
AS PEOPLE TAKE THE FED OUT OF
THE MARKET FOR AT LEAST THREE TO
SIX MONTHS OR SO.
TOM: A MUST READ BOOK.
OVER A DECADE AGO, I WAS THE
WORK OF ALAN BLINDER AT
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.
HE IS THE FORMER FED VICE
CHAIRMAN.
YOU KNOW HIM FROM HIS RECENT
BOOK ON THE CRISIS, BUT WHEN I
REMEMBER WAS A QUIET RESOLUTION
TALKING ABOUT BANKING GOING
MODERN.
ARE THEY WORKING OUT OF YOUR
CORTEX WORK OR AS EVERYTHING WE
HEARD TODAY ABSOLUTELY ORIGINAL
IN A VERY LOUD REVOLUTION?
>> I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS
COMPLETELY ORIGINAL BUT IT IS
VERY MODERN.
WHERE THE GREAT HALLMARKS OF
MODERN CENTRAL BANKING AS
OPPOSED TO OLDER -- AND I DO NOT
MEAN ARCHAIC, JUST A FEW DECADES
AGO -- IS CENTRAL TALK WITH
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.
AS ALAN GREENSPAN NEVER WAS,
DOING A PRESS CONFERENCE TO
EXPLAIN THE FED'S BANKING.
ALAN GREENSPAN WAS BED -- FED
CHAIRMAN NOT TOO LONG AGO AND
NOW WAS UNTHINKABLE AND NOW IT
IS JUST NORMAL.
MIKE: WHAT DID YOU LEARN TODAY
ABOUT THE FED'S REACTION?
WHY WOULD THEY CONSIDER GIVING
THEIR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK?
ALAN: IT IS A FURTHER TIGHTENING
OF THE LABOR MARKET STARTS TO
SHOW EVIDENCE OF INFLATIONARY
PRESSURES.
WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME THAT
ESTHER GEORGE DID NOT DISSENT
FROM THIS DECISION BECAUSE IF
YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IN A
CERTAIN WAY YOU CAN SEE SIGNS OF
THAT.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE SEE THAT THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS JUST
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE FED'S
ESTIMATE, AND WE SEE BOTH WAGES
AND PRICES ACCELERATING, THOUGH
FROM VERY LOW LEVELS, NOT LEVELS
THAT SCARE ANYBODY RIGHT NOW.
BUT THEY ARE MOVING UP, NOT
DOWN.
IF YOU ARE SUFFICIENTLY HAWKISH,
THAT WOULD BE -- THOSE WOULD BE
POWERFUL FIGURES -- SIGNALS TO
START GETTING ONTO NORMAL
INTEREST RATES BUT THE FED DID
NOT THINK THAT WAY TODAY.
MIKE: YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC
PROJECTIONS THEY PUT OUT AND
THEY SEE INFLATION RISING BUT
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OVER THE
NEXT TWO YEARS FALLING EVEN
FURTHER THAN THEY HAVE BEFORE.
ALAN: THAT IS THE KIND OF THING
I MEAN.
THEY ARE FORECASTING INFLATION
BELOW NEHRU WHICH IS CONSISTENT
WITH LYSING -- RISING INFLATION.
THEY HAVEN'T SIGNED US A LONG
TIME TO THEY HAD GOING TO
TOLERATE AN OVERSHOOT OF
INFLATION.
THEY DID NOT LET A NUMBER ON
THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ESTIMATED THAT MEANT 2.5%
INSTEAD OF 2%.
THE PRINCIPLE IS THE IMPORTANT
THING, THEY HAVE BEEN VERY
FORTHRIGHT ABOUT SOME
WILLINGNESS TO OVERSHOOT
INFLATION.
MIKE: DO YOU THINK THEY CAN GET
THEIR?
ALAN: I DO THINK THEY CAN GET
THERE.
VERY RECENTLY, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS,
INFLATION IS BASICALLY THE FED'S
TARGET.
THEY ARE BASICALLY THERE NOW BUT
IT IS RISING.
IT LOOKS TO ME WE'RE GOING TO
GET AN OVERSHOOT IN THE
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.
NOT A GIANT OVERSHOOT THEM ABOUT
AN OVERSHOOT.
TOM: WE WILL GET AN OVERSHOOT,
BUT THIS LINKS IN WITH YOUR WORK
OF LINKING FINANCE INTO
ECONOMICS, WE DO IT WITH A
MASSIVE DISTORTION OF INTEREST
RATES.
IF THE FED EXTENDS IT, THEY
LENGTHEN AND STRENGTHEN -- MAYBE
IT IS LOWER LONGER -- DO THE
BANKS OF THE WORLD, CAN THEY HAD
THE PATIENCE AND THE TIME TO
WAIT FOR THE HEAD TO MOVE -- FED
TO MOVE OR ARE THEY GOING TO RUN
OUT OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM?
IS DEUTSCHE BANK GOING TO RUN
OUT OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM?
ALAN: I DO NOT THINK SO.
TO YOUR QUESTION, THEY DO NOT
HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO WAIT.
THEY MAY WISH FOR A HIGHER
INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, BUT
THEY ARE NOT GETTING IT QUICKLY.
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT CAN I DO
ABOUT IT, CAN THEY HOLD OUT?
THIS IS SQUEEZING BANK PROFITS,
MORE SO IN EUROPE THAN THE
UNITED STATES.
BUT BUSINESSES HAVE FLUSH TIMES
AND LEAN TIMES AND THEY ARE
GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH
THE LEAN TIMES.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT U.S. BANKS, YOU
RAISED DEUTSCHE BANK AND ARE
OTHERS, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT
U.S. BANKS, THEY ARE DOING
PRETTY NICELY RIGHT NOW IN TERMS
OF PROFITABILITY.
THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING VERY
MUCH.
THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF
INTEREST RATE WERE HIGHER, BUT
THEY ARE NOT SUFFERING SEVERELY
FROM A LOW INTEREST RATE
ENVIRONMENT.
TOM: YOU AND YOUR STAFF COUPLE
ELUDED A TERMINAL VALUE FOR THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY.
MITSUBISHI IS WAY BELOW 2%.
TERMINAL GROWTH, POTENTIAL GDP,
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
THE BASIC IDEA, IS THIS A NEW
AMERICA, A SUB 2% AMERICA?
ALAN: I NOTED WITH INTEREST THAT
THE FED HAS STUCK TO ITS 2% GDP
GROWTH RATE IN THE LONGER RUN
COLUMN ON THE PROJECTIONS.
THEY HAVE COME DOWN A BIT OVER
THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT I DO NOT
THINK ENOUGH.
THE MAIN PART OF THAT GROWTH
RATE IS PRODUCTIVITY.
IT IS NOT POPULATION GROWTH.
LABOR FORCE GROWING SLOWLY AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
THAT KIND OF A NUMBER IS
CONSISTENT WITH ROUGHLY EIGHT
1.7% ANNUAL PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
RATE.
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE
BEEN DOING ONE HALF OF 1%
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH RATE.
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE
WILL BRING, NEITHER DOES JANET
YELLEN, BUT TO ME, AN ASSUMPTION
THAT RELATIVELY SOON WE'RE GOING
TO SEE PRODUCTIVITY GROWING AT
1.7% LOOKS QUITE AGGRESSIVE TO
ME.
I WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN THAT.
MIKE: THE FED IS ABOUT THERE,
BUT THAT YOU LOOK AT INFLATION
EXPECTATIONS.
WE HAVE A CHART THAT SHOWS
CONSUMERS AND WALL STREET VIEW.
THEY ARE NOT GOING IN THIS
DIRECTION.
WE WILL THIS OUT FOR EVERYONE TO
LOOK AT, BUT THE MARKET STILL
DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT.
>> THE MARKET I THINK IS MORE
WILLING TO LOOK AT GLOBAL
DEVELOPMENTS AND TAKE SIGNALS
FROM WHAT IS GOING ON IN JAPAN,
WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR AREA,
POTENTIAL RISKS FROM CHINA.
DOCTORS ALSO NEED TO BE
CONSIDERED ONLY LOOK AT THE U.S.
ECONOMY.
IN MY VIEW, WHEN WE LOOK AT THE
U.S. ECONOMY WE DO IT FROM A
U.S.-CENTRIC PERSPECTIVE, WHICH
HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN THE RIGHT
WAY.
BUT THE WAY BECOME HIS ARE
UNFOLDING MORE BROADLY, THAT IS
CHANGING.
I THINK MARKETS MAY BE
INDICATORS OF WHERE THE
ECONOMICS LOOKS AT THE U.S.
ECONOMY WILL BE GOING FOR IT.
MIKE: YOU SEE THEM STILL BURNING
DISINFLATION INTO THE UNITED
STATES?
SHAHAB: THAT IS THE SIGNAL THE
MARKETS ARE GIVING RIGHT NOW.
THERE IS DIFFICULTY FOR MARKET
OBSERVERS TO SEE WHAT IS REALLY
GOING ON IN CHINA, WHAT IS
REALLY GOING ON IN EUROPE.
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS VERY
TRANSPARENT BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW
IS THAT THE MARKET PERIODICALLY
AS LARGE PICKUPS IN RELATION TO
THOSE ISSUES AND MANY OF THE
PROBLEMS THEY POSE HAVE NOT GONE
AWAY AT ALL.
LET'S IMAGINE YOU GET A BREXIT
OUTCOME AND U.K., WHAT THEN
HAPPENS TO YOUR ECONOMY?
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE NO
MEANS ASSAULT AND IT IS
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE THEY
WILL BECOME INCONSEQUENTIAL
GOING FORWARD.
TOM: YOU HAVE BEEN A SUPPORTER
OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY POLITICS,
YOU ARE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF
JOHN KERRY.
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO SECRETARY
CLINTON AND SPECIFICALLY, HAVE
YOU SPOKEN TO SECRETARY CLINTON
ABOUT A RENEWED FISCAL POLICY?
ALAN: I HAVE NOT COME I AM NOT
SPOKEN TO HER AT ALL RECENTLY,
SHE HAS BEEN A VERY BUSY PERSON.
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
YOU TALK ABOUT AFTER A CAMPAIGN
IS OVER.
WE MIGHT NEED IT, IT IS
POSSIBLE.
MY BEST GUESS NOW IS THAT WE
WON'T, BUT I DO NOT HOLD THAT
GUESTS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF
CONFIDENCE.
THAT COULD BE WRONG AND WE COULD
NEED A FISCAL STIMULUS DOWN THE
ROAD.
WHETHER WE CAN GET ONE THROUGH
CONGRESS IS ANOTHER QUESTION
ENTIRELY AND WILL DEPEND ON
OTHER THINGS, ON THE OUTCOME OF
THE ELECTION.
MIKE: I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD TO
THE LAST POINT.
I THINK THE MARKETS OF GOTTEN A
LITTLE TOO MODERN.
YES, WE ARE INFLUENCED BY JAPAN
AND CHINA IN EUROPE, AND SO ON,
BUT EXCHANGE RATES ARE GLOATING
AND THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM
FOR DIVERGES AND INFLATION RATES
IN THE U.S. VERSUS EUROPE.
I DO NOT PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT IN
PROJECTING U.S. INFLATION ON THE
INFLATION RATE IN EUROPE OR
JAPAN, FOR EXAMPLE.
TOM: VICE CHAIRMAN BLINDER, IS
HE CRATERING THE MARKET RIGHT
NOW?
MIKE: HE WAS TRYING TO BE
OPTIMISTIC, I THINK.
ALAN: I DO NOT THINK I HAVE THAT
POWER ANYMORE.
TOM: PUSH AGAINST VICE CHAIRMAN
BLINDER, IF YOU WOULD, AS YOU DO
WITH GREAT RESPECT, THE
ECONOMICS OF SAY ALAN MELZER OF
CARNEGIE MELLON AND OTHERS WHO
SAY THAT THE MARKET TAKE CARE OF
ITSELF.
THE BASIC IDEA IS, LEAVE THE
MARKETS ALONE, EVERYTHING WILL
BE FINE.
WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT METER
RIGHT NOW?
DO WE NEED TO BE INTRUSIVE OR
NOT?
ALAN: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MONETARY POLICY.
I THINK WE NEED, OR AT LEAST
SHOULD BE INFORMATIVE.
THAT IS, MARKETS IN THE PAST
OFTEN FLEW OFF ON TANGENTS
MAKING EXTRAPOLATIONS ABOUT WHAT
THEY THOUGHT THE FED WAS GOING
TO DO THAT WERE VERY POORLY MORE
IN REALITY.
-- MOORED IN REALITY.
IT IS MUCH HARDER TO DO THAT
NOW.
THE MARKETS CANNOT GET EXACTLY
WHERE THE FED'S RATES WILL BE
RIGHT NOW.
THE FED DOESN'T KNOW THAT
EITHER.
BUT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT
BELIEVE IN THE MARKETS BECOME
TOTALLY UNHINGED FROM FEDERAL
RESERVE REALITY ARE SEVERELY
DIMINISHED BY THE GREATER
COMMUNICATIVE THIS --I WILL GIVE
YOU AN EXAMPLE, BACK IN THE DAY
WHEN I WAS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE
FED, AND THIS IS WHEN THE FED
WAS VERY QUIET AND SAID NOTHING
ABOUT ITS BOARD INTENTIONS.
I WAS AGGRAVATED THAT THE MARKET
BUT THE FED RATE WAS GOING TO 8%
AND MOST OF US INSIDE THE
BUILDING THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY
TO GO HIGHER THAN 6%, BUT WE
SAID NOTHING OFFICIALLY TO BRING
THE MARKETS EXPECTATIONS DOWN.
EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME DOWN
AND THE RATE TOPPED OUT AT 6%,
BUT WE LET THAT MISCONCEPTION
SIT THERE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS.
THE FED DOESN'T DO THAT
ANYMORE.
MIKE: THEY GIVE US REASONABLY
EXPLICIT GUIDANCE.
I WILL ASK YOU BOTH, THIS --
DOES FORWARD GUIDANCE WORK AT
THIS POINT?
IS IT USEFUL IF THE FED CANNOT
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, AND WE DO NOT
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
WITH ALL THESE GLOBAL
DEVELOPMENTS THAT KEEP POPPING
UP?
ALAN: I THINK IT IS VERY USEFUL.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
CONTROLLING.
THE MARKET HAS LOOK AT PAST
HISTORY, CORRECTLY SEEN THAT THE
FED HAS OVERESTIMATED THE
STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY,
CONCLUSIVELY OVERESTIMATING AND
EXPRESSING THIS BELIEF IN THAT
FORECAST.
THAT IS FINE.
WHAT YOU LIKE THE MARKETS TO DO
IS PROCESSING A LOT OF
INFORMATION, INCLUDING WHAT
COMES OUT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE
, AND MAKE ITS OWN JUDGMENTS.
THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE GET PAID TO
DO, AND THAT IS FINE.
I THINK IT IS GOOD.
SHAHAB: IT IS CERTAINLY USEFUL
IN TERMS OF SETTING A FRAMEWORK
FOR THE MARKET TO LOOK AT
EVENTS.
HAVING SAID THAT, IT IS
INTERESTING ME TO TALK ABOUT
ISSUES LIKE CHINA, LIKE BREXIT,
ISSUES THAT CLEARLY NOBODY HAS A
HANDLE ON IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND
OF REACTION THEY WILL ELICIT AN
THE MARKET OR THE ECONOMY.
BUT STILL HAVE FORECAST SO MUCH
HIGHER THAN WHERE THE MARKET IS.
THE MARKET IS GIVING INFORMATION
TO POLICYMAKERS AS WELL AS MUCH
AT HIS TELLING POLICYMAKERS --
THOSE TELL RISKS HAS SEVERE
AFFECTS.
THIS GAP BETWEEN THE MARKETS AND
THE POLICYMAKERS DOES RAISE SOME
QUESTIONS.
TOM: WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND
BLOOMBERG RADIO.
PROFESSOR BLINDER, WE SHOW THIS
CHART EARLIER OF COLUMBIA AND
NOW PIMCO AND WE DID THIS AND --
THE BASIC IDEA OF THEM LOOKING
AT THE OVERSHOOT -- YOU
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, THE IDEA
OF A FED THAT WILL OVERSHOOT.
I'M GOING TO SAY SIX YEARS AGO,
WE NEED TO REFLATE.
IN YOUR READING OF ECONOMICS,
CAN YOU REFLATE A SOCIETY?
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT
BERNANKE -- CAN THEY REFLATE AN
ECONOMY?
ALAN: THERE IS LOTS OF EVIDENCE
FROM THE PAST BUT IN THOSE PAST
EPISODES, THE CENTRAL BANKS
RARELY, IF EVER, FACED THE --WE
USED TO CALL IT THE ZERO LOWER
BOUND, NOW WE KNOW WE CAN GO
NEGATIVE.
IN THESE PAST EPISODES OF
REFLATION, THE EFFECT OF LOWER
BOUND WAS ALMOST NEVER A FACTOR.
WE JUST WERE NEVER ANYWHERE NEAR
IT, THEREFORE IT WAS NEVER AN
EFFECTIVE CONSTRAINT.
WITH THE EFFECT OF LOWER BOUND,
THE CENTRAL BANK IS CONSTRAINED
TO WEAKER INSTRUMENTS, AS WE NOW
KNOW.
AND WE ALSO NOW KNOW THAT IT
TAKES, TO USE A TECHNICAL TERM,
A HELL OF A LOT OF QUANTITATIVE
EASING FOR 1% CHANGE OF INTEREST
RATES.
THAT IS WHERE THE FED WOUND UP,
AND THAT MEANS THEY HAVE LESS
POWER IN THE CURRENT
CIRCUMSTANCES TO REFLATE AN
ECONOMY THAN THEY ARE USED TO
AND HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED,
HISTORICALLY, TO HAVE.
MIKE: WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
OBVIOUSLY, IF THE SKY FALLS, THE
BRITISH MOVE OUT ANY MARKET
FALLS APART, THAT IS ONE THING.
THE FED IS NOW ON HOLD FROM HERE
UNTIL PROBABLY DECEMBER, WHAT IS
THE TRADE, WHERE DO WE GO?
SHAHAB: THIS MIGHT BE NEGATIVE
VIEWS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD IN
TERMS OF HOW THE BROADER GLOBAL
ECONOMY IS GOING, ON A TECHNICAL
BASIS, AT THAT POINT I SUGGEST
GETTING BACK INTO RISK,
ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE, THE U.K.
DECIDES TO REMAIN.
BUT THE MARKET COULD MOVE AFTER
THINKING THE FED WILL TALK UP
AGAIN THE POSSIBILITY --
MIKE: YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THEM
WHEN IT NEVER A STATEMENT LIKE
THIS?
SHAHAB: WHAT YOU FIND IS THE FED
DOESN'T APPEAR TO LIKE THE
MARKET PRICING.
IT DOES LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF TIMES IT CAN TO LIFT
EXPECTATION.
TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
OUR BLINDER, A SPECIAL THANKS TO
YOU, GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR
PERSPECTIVE.
HE IS FORMER VICE CHAIR OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE.
I THINK WE SHOULD DO A QUICK
CHECK HERE.
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE ON
BLOOMBERG RADIO AND BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON.
-42 ON THE DOW.
I DO NOT WANT TO OVERPLAY THAT
BUT IT IS UNIQUE TO STOCKS.
MIKE: UTILITIES -- I WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE CHART IS BELIEVED
HERE.
THE FUN GAME TO PLAY IS WHO IS
DEBBIE DOWNER?
THERE IS ONE MEMBER WHO THINKS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY RATE
INCREASES.
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE PARLOR
GAME FOR EVERYBODY.
WHO IS THE REAL PESSIMISTS OUT
THERE?
TOM: THE REAL PESSIMISTS -- IT
WAS A JOKE --
MIKE: HE BELIEVED THAT WOULD BE
THE POLICY.
TOM: WOULD YOU SUGGEST THE
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE FED WAS
OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY ELSE?
MAYBE THAT IS THE HEADLINE
TODAY.
MIKE: IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO
SEE WHO THAT WAS.
TOM: I WANT IS A QUICKLY,
BLOOMBERG RADIO AND BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION WILL BE MOST
INTERESTING.
MIKE: WE WILL WRAP UP OUR
SPECIAL PROGRAM, NEXT, WOULD YOU
MISS COMING UP ON BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION.
