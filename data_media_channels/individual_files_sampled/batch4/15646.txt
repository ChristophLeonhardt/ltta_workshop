how low and lurid can those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome go well apparently it's now open season to mark the president's penis well it's presidential penis joke time folks be it on the news or as part of a Saturday Night Live sketch and really folks it's getting increasingly difficult to figure out what's what when it comes to a supposed serious news broadcast or a suppose that funny comedy program anyways one of the distraction topics of the day is the president's wedding tackle if you can believe it it all stems from stormy Daniels lurid description of what the president's penis allegedly looks like here's what stormy says in a new tell-all book I'm not going to read it aloud as it's too vulgar for words so here it is on the printed page you know I'm amazed to see this woman get a free pass on being such a blabbermouth about her encounters with the president given that she did sign a nondisclosure deal and was paid six figures to zip that mouth nevertheless her revelations have created a new cottage industry in the late-night talk show circuit in which the likes of Myers and Fallon and Kimmel are now seemingly obsessed with making Trump penis jokes is this not a double standard even when it comes to the realm of late-night shows if we were dealing with a female president would there be any jokes in which the punchline centers on how flat-chested or how arse challenge she is I mean I thought such pundit tree at least for elected officials was kind of off limits on the grounds of civility and good taste and in the event the left going after right-of-center candidates based on physical characteristics is something I first noted back in 2011 check out this ghastly Photoshop garbage that was the cover and a two-page spread in Toronto's Now magazine about mayor Rob Ford some seven years ago it depicts mayor Ford is being naked but why was Rob Ford discovered at a nudist camp or something at the time I reached out to an editor at Now magazine Susan G Cole seeking an explanation for this juvenile depiction Cole told me they'd chosen to pick Ford in the buff because he self described himself as 300 pounds of fun but hang on a second what does weight have to do with nudity miss Cole could not answer that question and little wonder the left used to rightfully promote the message that we should not be judgmental regarding people based on their physical appearance as well as race religion nationality etc but these days the left has chucked this idealism aside now they are out to deliberately embarrass their ideological opponents what's even more laughable as the explanations the left and the media party provide for breaking their own rules on the matter of the Trump penis coverage check out Hayley Freeman here's what she had to say quote is it right that the world is now laughing at Trump's penis he made a fortune from Miss Universe which is all about reducing women to their anatomical parts end quote wait a minute Miss Universe is a celebration of feminine beauty it is a pageant in which every contestant is there willingly and wants to win the thing do you think just maybe that's a wee bit different than a panel discussion involving pundants mocking a man's private parts in the final analysis this latest lurid dissent in discourse just shows how we on the right are on the winning side i harken back to the late great Margaret Thatcher who had this to say regarding ad hominem attacks on her a quote I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think well if they attack one personally it means they have not a single political argument left end quote Bravo for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
