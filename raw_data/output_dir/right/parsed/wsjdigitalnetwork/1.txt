Our experience with the automobile is
as mass-produced object.
Identical machines, endlessly replicated.
But some cars are different.
Some cars are built
in small numbers.
Not thousands, but dozens.
Or even just one.
 
These objects are more than cars, they are  artifacts.
And the people who make them,
artisans.
 
 
 
 
Horacio Pagani builds what are called Hypercars:
200-mile-per-hour sports machines
that cost millions and look like they belong in an art gallery.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yet, in a technical milieu,
requiring aerospace precision, Sig. Pagani
prefers pencils over CAD drawings,
people over robots. I wanted to know why.
I want you to imagine two objects.
Why is the handmade object
more valuable than the machine-made?
