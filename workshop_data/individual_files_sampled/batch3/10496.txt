Rush's black dolphin prison houses some of the country's toughest most violent criminals this facility first mentioned in history books way back in the 18th century today it holds hundreds of inmates and it's known for its brutal rules artists Murud gazetteer was given exclusive access to this site in this provincial town at the edge of Siberia is a prison but it's no ordinary prison this facility has spawned legends myths scandals and investigations the mere sight of this statue has broken the most soulless butchers the black dolphin Russia's highest security prison it is here that some of the country's worst maniacs serial killers terrorists and even cannibals held in this cell a man who raped 44 miners and killed five children aged 7 to 11 some of the people in this prison will never be allowed out so dreadful and the things that they've done another man in a drunken killing frenzy killed six of his friends in this cell a murderer killed 11 people 700 inmates sentenced to life between them they've killed almost 4,000 people everything is procedural everything intended to minimise risk from sleeping schedules to how inmates are escorted bent over at the waist and blindfolded so they can't memorize the prison's layout it may seem excessive humiliating even but don't forget what these people did to be here to that end every cell door has a description of the inmates crimes any sympathy the guards might feel disappears immediately you ask me if I do it again I've thought about it it would have been better if I'd died with them I probably wouldn't have done it it is better to die than sack fight others Eagle was just over 20 when he and his father took on a rival gang after killing their enemies they attempted to get rid of witnesses ordinary civilians in a restaurant seven dead eight injured both he and his father incarcerated here do you see each other sometimes when he fell ill they transferred me to help him for a while the most important thing is to avoid becoming embittered it is so easy to turn into an animal here but staying human that's harder that's why we try both with each other and with the administration to stay human some say a life sentence is worse than the death penalty I've been here for 17 years and I've never heard anyone say they don't regret it or they'd kill more I'm sorry but that's nonsense I regret it everything is lost the years go by your health worsens everything passes by I think there are a few people left in here who think they did the right thing the years show you that you were wrong totally wrong you can't do that Dmitry slaughtered his family his father his mother and his brother he was 20 now he's 45 we watch TV we see people who've committed two or three murders get sentenced to 17 or 19 years that isn't so terrible yes we are guilty before the law yes we are guilty before the public but if they're left out after 20 years why are they afraid of letting us out who in their 50s could be bothered to do anything all they would want is a normal life the difference is that life sentences and mostly reserved the crimes of such brutality that they escape reason the individuals deemed a permanent danger to society one inmate released early from the black dolphin committed a murder on the very train that was taking him home most will never see release inmates can pick where to work in the woodshop or on the sewing machines they earn money with which they can buy extra food or personal items make calls and pay compensation to their victims they even have visits four times a year with one lasting after three days if you take the period when we came here into solvent and compare it to now the conditions are entirely different now we have work opportunity for self improvement access to the media prisoners now have special terminals where they could review their cases complain about abuse or apply for work they have a library a small church which was built and painted by the inmates themselves even the walls have to be painted in light colors so that they lessen the psychological stress on inmates and staff they can also take walks sort of the exercise yard isn't anything to write home about but every prisoner has the right to spend an hour and a half here every day walking around exercising or just sitting still so long as they don't mind being watched a far cry from the infamous hellhole described a decade ago but control is total God's check on everyone every 15 minutes in cell cameras and monitored 24/7 and there's three doors to every cell this is a cell for those sentenced to life it's locked with a full metal door a cage door and another one for complete security we essentially have a cell within a cell it's easy to see why no one has ever escaped from the black dolphin and foremost the only sure way out is in a coffin or at gas D of our tea from Sola let's
