have we hit the ultimate Newspeak moment in the interior election campaign you see apparently NDP leader Andrea Horwath wants to embrace an energy strategy that means taking power off the grid and vaporizing thousands of full-time jobs in the process and this is all being done in order to create temporary jobs huh fans of George Orwell's prophetic 1984 know that one characteristic of new speak the language of Oceania is the definition of a word can mean the precise opposite of what the word seems to convey thus the Ministry of Truth is actually the government's propaganda department the Ministry of love is where hideous acts of torture take place and on and on it goes because Newspeak is in reality double-talk I was thinking of this Orwellian construct upon hearing the news at NDP leader Andrea Horwath once the mothball the Pickering nuclear plant as soon as possible while the NDP are being vague on Pickering Durham Region comm reports that the interior clean air Alliance confirmed in a press release that the NDP and the Green Party have committed to closing the Pickering Nuclear Station when its license expires this August indeed even though there's a request before the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission to renew the Pickering operating license for ten years past its expiration date of this coming August 31st Horwath apparently can't wait to see the wrecking ball come to Pickering being a hardcore leftist Andrea undoubtedly has a no nukes bumper sticker right next to save the whales on her Volvo station wagon okay I don't know where Horvath actually drives a Volvo station wagon but it always seems to be a Volvo station wagon brandishing those sorts of bumper stickers and should this socialist form the next government and puts Pickering out to pasture then what well PC leader Doug Ford notes the Pickering facility is responsible for 4,500 jobs across Durham Region and contributes to 600 million in savings to Ontario Hydro bills in a Toronto Sun story the interior chamber of commerce further calculates that 7,500 jobs across Ontario depend on the continued operation of the Pickering station as well says Ford closing the Pickering power plant will cost Ontario families another 600 million dollars on their hydro bills and in the Department of the enemy of my enemy is my friend the Liberals are on board would dug in opposing the NDP's harebrained scheme Premier Kathleen Wynne suddenly playing the role of a fiscal conservative says the NDP plan has quote implications for people's lives it has implications for the integrity of the electricity system end quote Wow and they said Jesus walking on water was a miracle well the NDP election platform does not specifically mention plans to shut down nuclear power it does state that a key part of addressing oversupply will include quote an independent fact-based evaluation of when to take Pickering off line and begin creating jobs for the decommissioning of the plant end quote you see eradicating a power plant and the electricity it generates is good according to the NDP because of all those temporary demolition jobs that will be created yep why do I get this terrible feeling in my gut that if this crew actually gets elected things are going to get very dark in Ontario in more ways than one for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's oil NZ hey folks Saturday June the second is fast approaching that's the date of the annual rebel live event in Toronto Katie Hopkins Sheila Gunn read John Cardillo the big bossman is relevant we'll all be there go to the rebel live.com and buy your tickets today you
