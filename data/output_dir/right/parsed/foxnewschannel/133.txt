>> WELCOME BACK TO "FOX AND
FRIENDS FIRST," 13 MINUTES AFTER
THE TOP OF THE HOUR, ROBERT
MUELLER SET TO RELEASE KEY
DETAILS ON THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
COLLUSION BUT THESE FINDINGS
WILL COME UNTIL AFTER THE
MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND MAY NOT
SIGNAL THE END TO HIS PROBE.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THIS
RELEASE?
HERE IS TOM FITTON.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US,
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
A COUPLE THINGS EXPECTED TO COME
OUT OF THIS, WHETHER THERE WERE
CLEAR INCIDENTS OF COLLUSION
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN AND WHETHER THE
PRESIDENT TOOK ANY ACTION
CONSTITUTING OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE BUT AS WE SAID IT MAY
NOT END AND THE FINDINGS MAY NOT
BE PUBLIC.
>> THEY MAY NOT BE PUBLIC IN THE
SENSE THAT IF HE GIVES ANYTHING
TO ROD ROSENSTEIN AS REGULATIONS
REQUIRE, CERTAINLY HAVE TO MAKE
THEM PUBLIC BUT THERE WILL BE
PUBLIC PRESSURE TO MAKE THEM
PUBLIC FROM THE PUBLIC AND
CONGRESS, MAY BE VERY HOSTILE TO
THE PRESIDENT.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING NEW AFTER
THE ELECTION THAT WE ALREADY
DON'T KNOW.
THERE IS NO COLLUSION, NO
OBSTRUCTION BUT THERE IS A
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION,
IMPEDING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE
PRESIDENCY AND SOMETHING WE HAVE
BEEN SAYING AT JUDICIAL WATCH,
IT NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN.
IT WAS CORRECTLY FORMED,
SIMPSON, A KEY FIGURE IN SETTING
UP THE MUELLER OPERATION
RESULTED IN HIS GETTING A
DOSSIER INTO THE FBI'S HANDED
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
COORDINATING TO TARGET TRUMP,
TAKING THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY WITNESSES
HAVE TO BE COMPROMISED, HOW MANY
ETHICAL COMPROMISES HAVE TO TAKE
PLACE IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
AND FBI IN THE APPOINTMENT OF
MUELLER BEFORE WE START
QUESTIONING THE BASIS OF THIS
OPERATION.
>> LET'S LOOK AT THOSE
INSTANCES, WE PUT IT IN WRITING
AND LET THE GRAPHIC OF ALL THOSE
THAT WERE COMPROMISED AND THE
REASONS IT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN,
YOU HAVE JIM COMEY WHO WAS
FIRED, ANDREW MCCABE UNDER GRAND
JURY INVESTIGATION, PETER
STZROK, BRUCE KIM JONG UN 6 WHO
WILL PLEAD THE SIXTH - PLEAD THE
FIFTH AS WELL.
THERE ARE REASONS FOR WHY THIS
SHOULD JUST BE STOPPED
ALTOGETHER.
>> JUST YESTERDAY WE HAD TWO
TREASURY OFFICIALS IMPLICATED IN
CRIMINAL LEAKS OF INFORMATION.
THESE GUYS WERE HELPING MUELLER
IN HIS OPERATION, THEY ARE
LEAKING FINANCIAL INFORMATION
FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY IS GOING
BACK TO COMEY HE WAS NOT ONLY
FIRED BUT DOCUMENTS IN THE FBI
FILES, LEAKED THEM AND THAT LED
TO THE APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER SO
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LEADING TO THE
APPOINTMENT AND ROD ROSENSTEIN
IS COMPROMISED AS WELL IN THE
SENSE HE IS A WITNESS TO THE
INVESTIGATION HE APPOINTED
MUELLER TO CONDUCT.
>> NOT UNBELIEVABLE, YOU ARE
LOOKING AT SITUATIONS LIKE THIS
GOING BACK TO THE CLINTON EMAIL
INVESTIGATION AND THE STATE
DEPARTMENT PROVIDING CLEARLY
FALSE STATEMENTS TO DELEON
REQUESTS FOR CLINTON DOCUMENTS,
THAT IS A QUOTE FROM A SHOCKED
FEDERAL JUDGE YESTERDAY.
>> THERE WAS A COURT HEARING
FRIDAY, WE WERE ASKING JUDGE
LAMBERT FOR DISCOVERY IN OUR
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT CASE
ABOUT THE BENGHAZI SCANDAL, THAT
CASE HAD BEEN COMPROMISED BY THE
FACT THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
WAS MISLEADING TO US IN THE
COURTS ABOUT THIS EMAIL ISSUE
AND THE COURT WAS UPSET,
CONCERNED ABOUT FALSE STATEMENTS
GIVEN BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT
AND EXCORIATED THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT FOR FILING FALSE
AFFIDAVITS OF THE HEARING WHERE
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S EXPLAIN
WHY IT WASN'T LYING TO THE
COURTS IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY
BUT EVEN WORSE, THIS STATE
DEPARTMENT IS OPPOSING OUR
EFFORTS TO BRING HER IN AND
QUESTION HER UNDER OATH AND
ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS
ON THE CLINTON EMAIL ISSUE.
>> THEY MOVED TO DISMISS IT IN
2014 AND THE JUDGE SAID HE WAS
GLAD HE DID NOT DO THAT BECAUSE
NOW HE HAS THIS INFORMATION THAT
THEY LIED AND WITHHELD
