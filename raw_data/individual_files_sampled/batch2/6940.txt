so there's a Muslim preacher apparently in Turkey that has decided that beards are necessary now according to the Quran they are not necessary it is not in the text depending on the different cultures and different regions that practice Islam some say like in Afghanistan for the Taliban they say it is necessary wide swaths of the Muslim world don't think it's necessary and like I said it's not in the Quran but this guy thinks that there's a very good reason why men should have beards all right let's hear him out he says this is from Newsweek men without beards quote cannot be distinguished from women and can provoke quote indecent thoughts an Islamic preacher in Turkey told the religious television station Fatih may they say later his name is more out to buy an off and he went on to explain he said men should grow beards beards are one of the two body parts that separate men from women is the beard I would argue there's a couple other separations to men and women but I like how he's like well look there are two things okay one thing and then the other thing and anyway you see my point not exactly quite see but it's about the yet worse he says for example if you see a man with a long hair from far away you may think he's a woman if he does not have a beard because nowadays women and men dress similarly god forbid you could be possessed by intese and thoughts all right wait hold on let me that's right so if a guy doesn't have a beard you might accidentally get turned on by him so you want to make sure everybody's got a beard you know sometimes people say something and they probably think that everybody thinks the same way but once it's out there they realize who knew other people didn't think that way he was like this guy's like I mean you're with me right I mean if a guy doesn't have a beard he looks good right you have Ravin god forbid but you have indecent thoughts as a guy it looks good right a beard or not as it should attractive not nothing you sit anymore okay here with me with me right you're with me Oh nobody's with me Oh Oh No okay I think I'm allowed to do a Turkish accent I mean I can get away with that one anyway Magdalena Kircher works the Istanbul Policy Center she's a fellow there and here's what she wrote about overall context for this she said era Diwan who's the president now of Turkey declared in 2012 his intent to raise quote devout generations and former Deputy Prime Minister brilliant orange stated in 2014 that women should not laugh out loud in public I think that they should have had a whole hashtag lol movement there but obviously they're trying to change the culture and this is part of how they tried to change the culture because Turkey used to be deeply secular was one of the most secular countries in the world being secular was written into the Turkish and is still in the Turkish Constitution but the right-wingers in Turkey would don't want that they want religion to overtake government that is why I happen to think they're dangerous on top of being clownish as this particular preacher is and and Newsweek explains by it all the the preacher in this case is a marginal figure in Turkey and is not wield much influence so they give a proper context there but kerchner says that statements like byeol's demonstrate efforts by the government and their societal base to create quote a bottom-up pressure against the secular way of life without having to impose legal constraints look I believe that culture is monumentally important and and it can affect the country overall and what people think and it is done in these ways so I think it's incumbent upon Turks and all over the world including Americans here in the US as well - yes engage in those culture conflicts if you will and so if you're a secular be proud of it you should be that is the right way to do the government you don't want any one particular religion taking over the government or one interpretation of the same religion to take over the government because everybody has a different interpretation of their religions and that's how you get to a thorium form of government that I think is opposite of democracy now I just I also like to note one last thing for the record here's a picture of President Naruto on does not appear to have a beard I'm not saying anything we'll have to ask the preacher what he thinks about that you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member tea white tea network.com slash join
