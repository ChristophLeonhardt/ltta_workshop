the man who invented Christmas no I'm not talking about President Trump making good on his promise to protect Christmas his record stock booms and 3% plus GDP growth whoo so much winning no I'm talking about the movie adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol this movie is it a fun unique and refreshing take on the old classic maybe yeah it is do they still manage to make some interesting political statements yes and did he actually invent Christmas no but I'll get into it I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood all right the man who invented Christmas was released nationwide November 22nd it grossed three million dollars the box office opening weekend they didn't actually mention what the budget was for this movie but we'll see how it goes over the holiday season and it is nice to see an independent movie get out there and do pretty well the movie was directed by Britt NOLA read it's really hard to pronounce that name let's get into it my viewer review I'm gonna give this movie a four out of five all right let's just dive right in of some of the reasons why this is a good movie and particularly it is the performances by some terrific actors Dan Stevens brings a merry performance to Charles Dickens he is fun he is captivating he is interesting every character that he interacts with is unique he does a great job of putting on not just himself but also the other characters around him the way he interacts different people and you can really feel his stress and joy throughout it by stressing him yeah he's really stressed most the time the rest of the cast was also fun pleasant enjoyable you get to interact with real human characters around them from his family to his friends as well as the characters in his mind as he's piecing together this classic story particularly Christopher Plummer who played a wonderful Grinch as ebony xur Scrooge let's see what I did there this incredible actor really puts on a show and this iconic role he is interesting to watch throughout it fun hilarious and entertaining director I'm just gonna say his last name Hillary did a great job of taking an old classic and putting a fresh new take on it the scenes were fast the imaginary characters were fun and you really got to feel the stress and tension of Charles Dickens back in the mid 1800s it was really cool watch and for my critic review I'm gonna give the man who invented Christmas a four out of five now the best part about this movie is the way that he told these imaginary characters one of the hardest thing to do especially when you're trying to believe one character and follow him is to also follow a separate story that he's writing and he's struggling with but it was a brilliant way to do this when you get to see this creative writer imagine the characters and then communicate with him trying to figure it out what would you do in the situation you get to see these real conversations not with this world busting supernatural spirit busting through but a legitimate character in his mind and he's talking to trying to grapple with these situations of Christmas and stray and love and redemption so you get to see all of them in real life at his head it was a great unique way to tell this story the mood was colorful it was well shot I will see the makeup was a bit odd in some places but the music in the settings and the lights were fun it was a very Christmas family-friendly movie to watch as well as the messages that were being talked about are perfect for the holiday season including redemption love and what the season is all about what was also timed very well was the history they included in it if you go back and look at the history of Charles Dickens writing this it pretty much follows his historical life almost beat for beat during this movie which is really cool when you get to see it on screen to know that this is pretty close to what actually happened to Charles during this incredible time in his life now for my faith in values I'm gonna give this a four out of five quick history Charles Dickens did not invent Christmas in 1843 the first recorded count of Christ's mass sale works their Christmas Christ Mass Christ huge celebration service was actually first recorded by the first Christian emperor of Rome Constantine in 336 ad even though a Christmas carol is a wonderful classic Christmas story that was wildly successful with millions of copies in circulation it doesn't really hold a candle to the original Christmas story recorded in the Bible with about 5 billion copies in circulation but I digress the themes are wonderful being discussed in the movie including an obsession with worldly wealth and greed how that can leave you penniless eternally stripping you broke of love friendship and family around you because you're so obsessed with what you can't have in the movie Charles really wants to bring the love and compassion back to the season because he sees the people around them being so wrapped up in material selfish things which I also think distracts us from the greatest gift of the season and that is salvation through Jesus Christ John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son and whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life great good politically this is also sneakily complex what is going on you see Charles complaining about people just hoarding and focusing on material things there's also a few offhanded jokes that are people talking about capitalism the free market there's also a guy who basically is the reason for Scrooge who talks about all is I picked myself up by my bootstraps and then his wife was like no you made all your money basically cuz your father gave you a cotton mill kind of like poking at Donald Trump's upbringing maybe it was kind of odd while also showing the incredible danger and stress of people leeching off of others without any hope of working for their own benefits living with their hands out taking both people down with them this happens to a lot of people around Charles even though he wants to be able to give to the poor he has people just leeching off him and stressing his life and everyone else is out as well probably nice comparison to socialism where people are just living with their hands outs they're producing for themselves and being responsible it really is a cool situation to watch him kind of be in the middle of this storm these two different things going on around him if you want to look at it through a political lens that's a great way you can do it or you just enjoy it for a great Christmas fun movie and in the end Charles is pretty much fed up with both sides and just chooses to love and appreciate those right in front of them as individuals for his family and friends so I hope you guys enjoyed the review as well as getting to go see the movie on Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood Merry Christmas and
