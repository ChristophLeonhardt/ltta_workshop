00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,067
YOUR TIME WITH THE DOCTOR

20
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,468
CHRISITINE BLASEY FORD, THE

21
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:29,802
ACCUSER?

22
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:31,804
>> WE HAVE A LADY WHO IS A

23
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:33,539
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR WHO WILL

24
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,108
ASK QUESTIONS OF DR. FORD AND I

25
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:37,309
MAY ASK SOME QUESTIONS OF JUDGE

26
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:37,910
KAVANAUGH.

27
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,277
WE'LL SEE.

28
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:39,645
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU SAY --

29
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,213
I BELIEVED IT WAS SENATOR COONS,

30
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:42,514
DEMOCRAT, WHO SAID THAT YOU ALL

31
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,516
ARE TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND THIS

32
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:45,951
PROSECUTOR AND DOCK YOUR

33
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,952
RESPONSIBILITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.

34
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:48,387
>> NUMBER ONE, SENATOR COONS IS

35
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:50,255
A GOOD FRIEND BUT HE ALSO SAID

36
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:51,790
THAT BURDEN WAS ON KAVANAUGH TO

37
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,126
PROVE THAT HE WASN'T AT A PARTY

38
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:54,560
35 YEARS AGO.

39
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,029
NOBODY WILL TELL HIM THE DATE OF

40
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:59,131
THE PARTY OR THE LOCATION OF THE

41
00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,465
PARTY.

42
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:01,300
JOE BIDEN FROM DELAWARE HAD THE

43
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,302
RIGHT APPROACH.

44
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:04,036
EVERYBODY IS PRESUMED INNOCENT

45
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:06,505
WHEN THEY ACCUSE THE MIC ARE

46
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,107
ACCUSED OF RAPE ARE

47
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,008
SEXUAL ASSAULT EXCEPT FOR

48
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:09,375
KAVANAUGH.

49
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,509
I WILL TELL SENATOR COONS THAT

50
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,510
THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING

51
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,279
THING I HAVE SEEN IN OVER 20

52
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:15,181
YEARS IN POLITICS.

53
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:19,285
I VOTED FOR SO TO MY LAWYER

54
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,320
AND -- SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND

55
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,888
ELENA KAGAN.

56
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,056
I'M MORE COMMITTED TO VOTING FOR

57
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,291
KAVANAUGH THAN EVER.

58
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,393
THESE ALLEGATIONS TO ME JUST ARE

59
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:29,228
FALLING APART AND I'LL BE GLAD

60
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:30,429
TO GO THROUGH ALL FIVE OF THEM.

61
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,664
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

62
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:32,298
THE FIFTH ONE.

63
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,532
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE CHAIN

64
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,101
OF COMMAND OF REPORTING THIS.

65
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:35,868
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE, DEMOCRAT OF

66
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:37,370
THE COMMITTEE, CAN BE WITH THIS

67
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,105
ALLEGATION.

68
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:39,538
WHAT HAPPENED?

69
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:40,306
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE GIVE HIM A

70
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:42,241
COUPLE OF DAYS AGO IS THAT A

71
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,509
CONSTITUENT FROM RHODE ISLAND

72
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,211
TOLD HIM ABOUT AN INCIDENT BACK

73
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,314
IN THE '80s WERE KAVANAUGH AND

74
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,181
MARK JUDGE SUPPOSEDLY TOOK A

75
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:52,118
YOUNG WOMAN OUT ON A BOAT AND

76
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,619
MISTREATED HER AND THIS WOMAN

77
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,253
TOLD HIM ABOUT IT.

78
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:55,354
HE WENT TO THE BOAT AND BEAT

79
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:56,389
THEM BOTH UP.

80
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:59,559
I SAID, I'LL MAKE SURE THE FBI

81
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,493
TAKES IT SERIOUSLY.

82
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:02,295
HE DID IT THE RIGHT WAY, HE CAME

83
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:05,765
TO ME, WE WENT TO THE FBI, IT'S

84
00:02:05,765 --> 00:02:06,466
FALLING APART.

85
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,667
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE TO THE RIGHT

86
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,467
THING.

87
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,202
YOU NEED TO RUN THESE THINGS

88
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:11,037
DOWN.

89
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:13,873
NUMBER FOUR, THE ALLEGATION IS

90
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:15,608
THAT AN ANONYMOUS PERSON WROTE A

91
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:16,242
LETTER TO CORY GARDNER --

92
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:17,277
>> Shannon: WE HAVE A LETTER,

00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,679
WE CAN PUT UP AND SEE HOW THIS

94
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,114
REPORT CAME IN.

95
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:21,714
SENATOR CORY GARDNER, A

96
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:25,652
REPUBLICAN HEAD OF COLORADO, NO

>> WE KNOW BECAUSE OF    IT BECF

102
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:30,924
NBC.

103
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:31,858
WE DISTRUST YOU BECAUSE OF

104
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:32,692
THINGS LIKE THIS.

105
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,160
YOU WOULD NEVER PRINT AN

106
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,196
ANONYMOUS LETTER ACCUSING A

107
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,264
LIBERAL NOMINEE OF WRONGDOING.

108
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,265
THERE IS NO JOURNALISTIC

109
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:40,166
INTEGRITY LEFT WHEN IT COMES TO

110
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:43,269
TRUMP AND NOMINEES.

111
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:44,504
THE IDEA OF AN A REPORT ON AN

112
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:48,908
ANONYMOUS ACCUSATION AND GIVING

113
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:49,676
IT CREDIBILITY SAYS ALL YOU NEED

114
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,044
TO KNOW ABOUT WHERE MEDIA IS

115
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,479
WHEN IT COMES TO KAVANAUGH AND

116
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:52,779
TRUMP.

117
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,880
>> Shannon: YOU ARE A

118
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,714
PROSECUTOR FOR MANY YEARS.

119
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,083
HOW DO YOU TRAVERSE THIS?

120
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,651
ALREADY GO THROUGH IT?

121
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,854
A SITUATION WHERE WE WILL HEAR

122
00:03:00,854 --> 00:03:01,054
FROM DR. FORD

123
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:05,658
WHAT I THINK IS EVERY GOOD GOOD

124
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:08,027
FOR EVERYBODY TO ASSESS HER

125
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,230
CREDIBILITY, TO ASSESS THE

126
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,630
ALLEGATIONS.

127
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,564
WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE

128
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,866
ANONYMOUS LETTERS AND TIPS ARE

129
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,300
CALLED A VENTRICLE AGAIN WITH NO

130
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,101
NAMES ATTACHED?

131
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,469
HOW DOES THE JUDGE DEFEND

132
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:16,803
HIMSELF?

133
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:18,872
>> NUMBER ONE, I WILL LOOK AT

134
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:20,340
THIS FROM THE JUDGE'S POINT OF

135
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,640
VIEW.

136
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,909
I USED TO BE A JOKE, BY THE WAY.

137
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,210
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER GOES NOWHERE

138
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,712
BECAUSE IT IT'S ANONYMOUS.

139
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,080
HOW DO YOU DEFEND YOURSELF?

140
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,516
IT'S ABOUT NBC, NOT JUDGE

141
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:29,883
KAVANAUGH.

142
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:34,854
THE THIRD ACCUSATION, I AM

143
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:35,588
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE

144
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,289
WAS A SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR IN

145
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:37,057
HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL,

146
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:40,860
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH RAN A

147
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,695
GANG-RAPE RING AROUND

148
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,897
WASHINGTON, D.C., DRUG WOMEN

149
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:46,266
ROUTINELY, AND WAS INVOLVED IN

150
00:03:46,266 --> 00:03:46,900
GANG-RAPES AND THE PERSON

151
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,070
ACCUSING HIM OF THIS WENT TO TEN

152
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,071
DIFFERENT PARTIES --

153
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,671
>> Shannon: AT LEAST.

154
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,239
>> NEVER TOLD ANYONE ABOUT IT,

155
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,241
NEVER WORN HER FRIENDS, CALL THE

156
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,277
COPS, IT COMES FROM THE AVENATTI

157
00:03:57,277 --> 00:03:58,478
WORLD, IT MAKES $0.00.

158
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,046
I DON'T BELIEVE A REASONABLE

159
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,014
PERSON WOULD KEEP GOING TO

160
00:04:01,014 --> 00:04:05,485
PARTIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE

161
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:10,657
DRUGGED AND RAPE RAPED.

162
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,092
I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED TO

163
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:12,859
MISS FORD BUT SHE CANNOT TELL US

164
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,196
WHERE AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

165
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:19,099
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW MS. FORD

166
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,132
AND ELLA PEOPLE NAMED HAVING

167
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,034
BEEN AT THIS UNKNOWN LOCATION

168
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,270
SAY IT DID NOT HAPPEN.

169
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,738
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

170
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,140
YOU COULDN'T GET A WARRANT IN A

171
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,542
CRIMINAL SETTING, PROBABLE CAUSE

172
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,242
REQUIRES YOU TO DETERMINE THE

173
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:32,379
LOCATION AND TIME AND HAVE SOME

174
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:32,813
CORROBORATION.

175
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,416
THERE IS FIVE ALLEGATIONS,

176
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:38,285
VARYING DEGREES OF RELIABILITY,

177
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:39,720
ALL OF THEM -- HERE IS THE ONLY

178
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,054
THING I KNOW THAT'S CONSISTENT.

179
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:42,422
WHEN IT COMES TO JUDGE

180
00:04:42,422 --> 00:04:44,424
KAVANAUGH, THERE ARE NO RULES OR

181
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:44,825
BOUNDARIES.

182
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,093
IF THE LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO

183
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:46,760
DESTROY THIS GUY AND TO MY

184
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,996
CONSERVATIVE FRIENDS, WHERE HAVE

185
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,864
YOU BEEN?

186
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:53,267
DO YOU NOT SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING

187
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:54,067
HERE?

188
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,402
YOU CANNOT FIGURE THIS OUT?

189
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,036
DO YOU REALLY THINK BRETT

190
00:04:56,036 --> 00:05:01,375
KAVANAUGH IS A GANG RAPIST WHEN

191
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,476
HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND NOBODY

192
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:04,645
KNOWS ABOUT IT UNTIL 2018?

193
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:06,280
>> Shannon: THE FBI DIDN'T DO

194
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,081
A VERY GOOD JOB, IF THEY MUST

195
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:08,282
ALL OF HIS COMMAND'S BEEN OUT

196
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:08,882
THERE FOR 30 YEARS.

197
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,351
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

198
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,319
YOU MENTIONED MICHAEL AVENATTI.

199
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,690
MICHAEL AVENATTI SAYS, WHY ARE

200
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,391
DONALD TRUMP, CHUCK GRASSLEY,

201
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,058
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, AND

202
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,793
LINDSEY GRAHAM AFRAID TO GET THE

203
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,061
FBI INVOLVED AND CALL MARK JUDGE

204
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,462
TO TESTIFY?

205
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,663
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HIDE THE

206
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:23,864
TRUTH FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

207
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,432
AND THEY KNOW KAVANAUGH IS

208
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,901
GUILTY."

209
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,936
WHY NOT PERSUADE THE WHITE HOUSE

210
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:30,104
TO ASK THE FBI INVESTIGATION,

211
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,272
CLEAR HIM COMICALLY HERS NAME,

212
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:33,140
AND THEN HE CAN GET ONTO THE

213
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,475
BENCH?

214
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:39,080
>> IF YOU REALLY WANTED AN FBI

215
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,914
INVESTIGATION, THIS MAN IS

216
00:05:39,914 --> 00:05:42,683
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS A

217
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,051
DEMOCRAT, HE HAD THE ALLEGATION

218
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,053
BY MY FORD IN JULY.

219
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,055
SHE HIRED A LAWYER, SHE TOOK A

220
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,757
POLYGRAPH, SHE TALKED WITH

221
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:50,491
"THE WASHINGTON POST," SHE LIED

222
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,325
TO.

223
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:53,561
YOU HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO BRING

224
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,529
MS. FORD, WHY DID YOU HIDE IT

225
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,230
FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?

226
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,598
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL US ABOUT IT

227
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:00,234
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

228
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:02,203
LIKE SENATOR WHITEHOUSE?

229
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,305
THIS IS A COORDINATED EFFORT AT

230
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,307
THE LAST MINUTE TO STOP THE

231
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:08,275
NOMINATION AND THEY SAY OPENLY,

232
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,177
THE GOAL IS TO KEEP HIM OFF THE

233
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:13,314
COURT, GET THE SENATE BACK IN

234
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,149
2018, AND DENY PRESIDENT TRUMP A

235
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,284
SECOND NOMINATION.

236
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:18,285
I VOTED FOR SONIA SOTOMAYOR AND

237
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:18,986
ELENA KAGAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT

238
00:06:18,986 --> 00:06:19,654
THEY WERE QUALIFIED.

239
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,256
WHEN I SEE HERE IS A COORDINATED

240
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,858
EFFORT TO DESTROY A GOOD MAN'S

241
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:26,260
LIFE BY ALLEGATIONS THAT DO NOT

242
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,094
HOLD WATER, THAT YOU COULD NOT

243
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:29,096
GET A WARRANT FOR, AND I AM

244
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:30,031
FIGHTING BACK.

245
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:32,333
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

246
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,035
WE ABANDON JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I

247
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:34,969
HOPE PEOPLE ABANDON US BECAUSE

248
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,471
WE WOULD DESERVE IT.

249
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:38,305
>> Shannon: A LOT OF MY

250
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:39,440
TWITTER FOLLOWERS SAY THAT IS

251
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,574
HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT IT.

252
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,276
>> THEY SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY.

253
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,077
>> Shannon: I DON'T KNOW IF

254
00:06:43,077 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RESIST YOUR
