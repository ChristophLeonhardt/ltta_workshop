AFTERNOON ON THE LAWN AT THE
WHITE HOUSE AFTER THE PRESIDENT
WALKED THE NORTH KOREAN
VICE-CHAIRMAN BACK TO HIS CAR.
WE DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY.
>> 8112th WE'LL BE IN
SINGAPORE.
I NEVER SAYS IT GOES IN ONE
MEETING.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A
PROCESS, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS
BUILDING.
I LOOK FORWARD TAKING THE
SANCTIONS OFF SOME DAY.
I DON'T WANT TO USE MAXIMUM
PRESSURE.
WE DID DISCUSS THE ENDING OF THE
KOREAN WAR.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
A LETTER WAS GIVEN TO ME BY KIM
JONG-UN, A VERY NICE LETTER.
OH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT
WAS IN THE LETTER?
I HAVEN'T OPENED IT.
I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN THE FRONT OF
THE DIRECTOR.
I SAID, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO
OPEN IT?
HE SAID, YOU CAN READ IT LATER.
I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE,
FOLKS.
>> LET'S GET REACTION.
THERE WAS A LOT IN THAT SOUND
BITE THAT WE JUST PUT TOGETHER
FROM TODAY, THE POTENTIAL END OF
THE KOREAN WAR, THE POTENTIAL
FOR DENUCLEARIZATION, A THAW
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.
A LOT HAPPENED IN THAT MEETING
THIS AFTERNOON.
>> IT DID.
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT CANCELLATION
THAT YOU REFERENCED, WHERE IT
WAS OFF FOR A COUPLE DAYS, WAS
MAYBE A GOOD, HEALTHY REALITY
CHECK FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED,
INCLUDING AT THE WHITE HOUSE,
BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME
TRIUMPHANTISM AND A BIT TOO MUCH
EXCITEMENT AND OPTIMISM FLYING
AROUND, AND THEN THERE WAS A
REMINDER THIS IS A DIFFICULT
PROCESS WITH A TERRIBLE REGIME
WITH A HORRIBLE HISTORY, AND THE
TONE THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE
EVER SINCE HAS BEEN MORE
MEASURED IN MY VIEW, MORE
REALISTIC, AND IT SEEMS LIKE
SOME OF THE ACTUAL DIPLOMATIC
GROUNDWORK IS STARTING TO HAPPEN
FOR THIS JUNE THE 12th
MEETING.
SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A PIVOT
POINT IN THIS PROCESS, AND ONE
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE GOOD.
>> WE WILL SEE, AS THE PRESIDENT
LIKES TO SAY.
ZACH, A LOT OF SNICKERING, THAT
NANCY PELOSI SOUND BITE WAS JUST
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES.
WHAT ARE FOLKS ON THE DEMOCRATIC
SIDE SAYING ABOUT IT NOW?
>> LOOK, I THINK THIS IS GREAT.
I THINK THAT DIPLOMACY IS FAR
SUPERIOR TO WAR.
IC I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD SOUND
A NOTE OF CAUTION EXPRESSED BY
THE REPUBLICAN LEADER TODAY, YOU
KNOW.
DONALD TRUMP SEEMS VERY EAGER TO
GET A DEAL.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN HIS
EAGERNESS HE'S NOT ACCEPTING
SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT MEET THE
STANDARD THAT HE HIMSELF AND HIS
ADMINISTRATION HAVE LAID OUT,
WHICH IS VERIFIABLE, COMPLETE,
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION,
ALONG WITH A REGIME THAT'S
STRONGER THAN THE IRAN DEAL AND
GOES LONG INTO THE FUTURE.
IF HE COMES BACK FROM JUNE
12th SUMMIT AND DOES NOT HAVE
AN AGREEMENT LIKE THAT, HE JUST
COMES BACK WITH MORE EXCUSES, A
SYMBOLIC END TO THE KOREAN WAR
OR --
>> HE SAID TODAY, TO BE FAIR, HE
EXPECTS SEVERAL MEETINGS.
WE REMEMBER REAGAN AND
GORBACHEV, IT TOOK SEVERAL
MEETINGS.
>> NO.
HE'S ALREADY MAKING EXCUSES.
>> DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR,
ZACH?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
LOOK, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SOMEBODY WHO SAID HE'S THE GREAT
DEAL-MAKER.
>> HOLD ON.
ZACH, DO YOU HOPE THAT HE COMES
HOME WITH A DEAL THAT PROMISES
THE THINGS THAT YOU --
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.
>> WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR
BOTH SIDES TO BE POSITIVE AND
SORT OF CHEERING THIS PROCESS ON
IN THE HOPE THAT IT'S A VERY
GOOD THING FOR THE PEOPLE OF
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA AND
JAPAN RATHER THAN KNOCKING IT
DOWN EVERY CHANCE YOU GET?
>> NO.
WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT IT, BUT
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE
MEETING ITSELF IS SOME SORT OF
ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN THE REGIME
HAS BEEN ASKING FOR A MEETING AT
THIS LEVEL FOR YEARS.
EXCEPTING THIS MEETING, IT'S NOT
AN ACHIEVEMENT, IT'S A
CONCESSION TO THE KIM REGIME.
>> YEAH, BUT, LOOK, THERE'S A
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU JUST
SAID, WHICH IS EXCUSE-MAKING,
AND EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT.
I THINK THIS IS MORE THE LATTER.
THAT'S APPROPRIATE.
>> YEAH.
HOWIE?
>> YEAH.
WE CAN'T CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT
FOR MAKING EXCUSES FOR A MEETING
THAT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN.
BY THE WAY, DONALD TRUMP IS A
MASTER SHOWMAN.
SO YOU HAD CAMERAS TRAINED ON
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR HOURS TODAY.
THE LETTER BEING DELIVERED, WHAT
WAS IN THE LETTER.
WHEN HE DID CANCEL THE MEETING,
THERE WAS ALL THIS CRITICISM
ABOUT, OH, HE'S JUST THROWING A
TEMPER TANTRUM, THIS WAS
IMPULSIVE.
HE GOT KIM BACK TO THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE.
EVEN IN THAT BREAKUP LETTER, HE
DID SAY, CALL ME, WRITE ME, TEXT
ME.
>> YEAH.
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, WE SHOULD
POINT OUT, THEY WERE SAYING,
ACTUALLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO COME
TALK TO YOU, WE DO WANT A
MEETING.
>> YEAH.
ALL THE CRITICISM ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT WANTED THIS SUMMIT SO
BADLY HE WAS GOING TO MAKE
SWEEPING CONCESSIONS, ACTUALLY
WHAT WE LEARNED THROUGH THE
NEGOTIATING TACTICS IS THAT KIM
NEEDS THE MEETING MORE.
HE'S THE ONE THAT SEEMED TO COME
BACK.
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEAL.
>> YEAH.
IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO
WATCH THIS PLAY OUT.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ENJOYING THE
BACK AND FORTH TODAY WITH THE
PRESS AS HE OFTEN DOES, AND AS
HE WAS WALKING AWAY HE GOT ASKED
ABOUT NAFTA, AND HERE'S WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT THAT.
>> ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES,
INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION,
THEY CHARGE FIVE TIMES WHAT WE
CHARGE FOR TARIFFS.
I BELIEVE IN THE WORD
RECIPROCAL.
YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE FIVE
TIMES, WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE
FIVE TIMES.
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE.
NO OTHER PRESIDENT EVER BROUGHT
IT UP.
IT'S GOING TO BE DONE NOW.
>> THIS IS FASCINATING.
IT GOT A LOT OF RESPONSE FROM
OUR PARTNERS.
THIS FROM EMANUEL McCRAWN,
THAT MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
WITH, HIS RESPONSE WAS FROSTY.
IN FACT, HE SAID ECONOMIC
NATIONALISM LEADS TO WAR.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN
THE 1930s, AND THEN THIS FROM
OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR JUSTIN
TRUDEAU.
WATCH.
>> THE IDEA THAT SOLDIERS WHO
FOUGHT TOGETHER IN WORLD WAR II,
ON THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN,
STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN
DIFFICULT PLACES IN THE WORLD,
ALWAYS THERE FOR EACH OTHER,
SOMEHOW THIS IS INSULTING TO
THEM, THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE
ARE A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT
TO THE UNITED STATES IS QUITE
FRANKLY INSULTING AND
UNACCEPTABLE.
>> GUY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> THE EXCUSE THAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING IS
USING THIS NATIONAL SECURITY
EXCEPTION TO JUSTIFY THE TARIFFS
THEY'RE SLAPPING ON THE
CANADIANS.
LOOK, THIS IS A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE IDEA.
TRADE WARS ARE BAD FOR EVERYONE
INVOLVED.
THEY ARE LOSE-LOSE PROPOSITIONS,
AS I'VE SAID ON THIS SHOW
BEFORE, BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE
TRUE.
I HOPE PEOPLE GO HOME AND WATCH
MILTON FREE WATER, BECAUSE HE'S
SO SMART.
WE HAD SUCH AN AMAZING JOBS
REPORT TODAY.
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING UNDER
TRUMP POLICY --
>> BUT, GUY, THE MARKET DIDN'T
EVEN BLINK.
>> THE MARKET IS DIFFERENT THAN
THE BROADER ECONOMY.
AND WHEN YOU COST AMERICAN JOBS
THROUGH RETALIATION, BECAUSE
WE'RE GOING TO SEE RETALIATION,
OUR ALLIES HAVE PROMISED IT,
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO GRANT THAT,
LET'S SAY, CHINA IS A CURRENCY
MANIPULATOR AND A BAD TRADE
PARTNER, WE'RE IN PROCESS OF
NEGOTIATING WITH THE CHINESE,
WHY WOULD YOU TARGET OUR ALLIES
IN THE EU AND CANADA AND MEXICO?
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SAY
BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES CHARGE
FIVE TIMES TO US WHAT WE CHARGE
TO BRING THEIR GOODS INTO OUR
COUNTRY.
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS,
ZACH, AND LET ME GET YOUR
THOUGHTS ON THIS, WHAT HE'S
TRYING TO DO IS PUSH THE BALL A
LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW, JUST A
LITTLE BIT DOWN THE LANE, IF HE
GETS A LITTLE BIT BACK, THAT'S A
STARTING POINT.
>> WE STARTED THE SEGMENT
TALKING ABOUT THIS MAY START A
WAR.
THE WAR DONALD TRUMP MAY NEED TO
WORRY ABOUT IS WITHIN HIS OWN
PARTY.
REPUBLICANS ARE SCREAMING ABOUT
THIS, LIKE PAUL RYAN, KEVIN
BRADY, SENATOR ALEXANDER,
SENATOR TOOMEY, COMING OUT AND
SAYING THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
THE REASON IS THAT THESE
POLICIES ARE GOING TO HURT TRUMP
VOTERS.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AUTO JOBS,
FARM JOBS, TEXTILE JOBS.
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
GOING TO GET HURT BY THE
POLICIES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS
PUSHING THROUGH.
>> SO HOWIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WISE MOVE OR BIG MISTAKE?
>> WHAT THE WASHINGTON
ESTABLISHMENT FAILS TO
UNDERSTAND, WHEN HE MAKES
AGGRESSIVE MOVES, EVEN AGAINST
HIS ALLIES, IT'S HIS NEGOTIATING
STYLE.
IT'S PART OF AN OPENING BID.
HE DID IT IN REAL ESTATE.
GRANTED, IT'S HARDER TO DO IT ON
THE WORLD STAGE.
IN THE END, I PREDICT HE'LL BACK
OFF TO SOME DEGREE, HE'LL
PREDICT VICTORY, THERE WON'T BE
A TRADE WAR, BUT MEANWHILE HE'S
MOVING THE BALL BECAUSE IF YOU
TAKE A ROUGH POSITION, EVEN WITH
YOUR FRIENDS, THAT GIVES YOU
ROOM TO ULTIMATELY MAKE A DEAL.
>> IT'S AN ARGUMENT AMONG FAMILY
