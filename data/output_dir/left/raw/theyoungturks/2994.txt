1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,859
>>APPARENTLY THE PENTAGON HAD A
FASCINATING ARGENT CALLED

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,990
ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT
IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,990
IF YOU

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,950
ARE THE PENTAGON YOU WANT TO
IDENTIFY THREATS IN THE AIR,

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,790
THAT MAKES SENSE.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,000
WERE THEY
TRYING TO IDENTIFY CHINESE OR

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,730
RUSSIAN THREATS?

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,740
NO.

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,740
INDIAN,
PAKISTANI?

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
NO.

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,080
UFOS, ALIEN

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,130
THREATS.

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,190
AWESOME.

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,240
THIS WHOLE
STORY IS MADE OF AWESOME.

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
AT THE

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,490
END I WILL SHOW YOU A VIDEO OF A
UFO.

17
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,539
I THINK.

18
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,109
AND APPARENTLY THE

19
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,100
U.S. GOVERNMENT THINKS.

20
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,550
HOLD FOR
IT BECAUSE YOU WANT ALL THE

21
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,649
DETAILS OF THIS STORY.

22
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:48,739
THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE THIS,
THEY EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A

23
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,120
GROUP, AND --

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,530
>>ALREADY IT'S COOL.

25
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,609
FROM NO
ONE, ANYTHING THAT IS SECRETIVE

26
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,230
I WILL SAY THAT'S ON THE FIFTH
FLOOR OF THE C RING, WHICH IS

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,050
GREAT.

28
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,350
THEY EXPLAIN THAT THIS
PROGRAM RAN FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

29
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,370
IT MIGHT STILL BE RUNNING, AND
THE PENTAGON LOOKED INTO THIS IN

30
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,370
THE PAST.

31
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,370
LET ME GIVE YOU
DETAILS --

32
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:38,050
>>[LASER SOUND EFECT] THAT'S OUR
OLD ALIEN BEEP.

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,850
OKAY --

34
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:51,270
>>YOUR UNCLE HARRY WHO'S HALFWAY
THERE AND HALFWAY NOT THERE

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,490
MENTALLY, HE COMES OVER AT
THANKSGIVING AND COMES OVER AND

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,240
TELLS YOU ABOUT UFOS THAT DID X
AND Y AND Z TO HIM, YOU SAY

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,840
BUT MOST OF
THIS DATA IS COLLECTED FROM U.S.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,580
SERVICEMEMBERS.

40
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,490
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT A GUY BECAUSE HE'S IN THE

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,480
MILITARY IS BY DEFINITION MORE
TRUSTWORTHY?

42
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
NOT NECESSARILY OF

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,629
COURSE, BUT WHEN BOB COMES IN
AND TELLS ME LOOK MAN, I KNOW

44
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:19,849
HOW AIRCRAFT ACT, THEY DON'T ACT
THAT WAY, I GIVE THAT'S ZERO

45
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,849
CREDIBILITY.

46
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:25,129
WHEN A NAVY PILOT
IS IN THE AIR AND HE SEES A UFO

47
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:29,659
AND SAYS AN AIRCRAFT DOESN'T ACT
THAT WAY, I GIVE IT A LOT MORE

48
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,629
CREDIBILITY.

49
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,819
IT'S NOT THE END
ALL BE ALL, BUT PRETTY

50
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:34,819
INTERESTING.

51
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,799
LET'S GO BACK FROM
WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY STARTED

52
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:40,790
DOING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AND
FIND OUT WHAT THEY FOUND OUT

53
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,989
BACK THEN, WHEN WE HAD A LOT
LESS TECHNOLOGY AT OUR DISPOSAL

54
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:44,989
--

55
00:02:44,989 --> 00:03:18,480
>>[LASER SOUND EFFECT] BUT THAT
WAS BACK THEN, AND WE JUST

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH
TECHNOLOGY, AND PEOPLE BELIEVED

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,360
IN MORE KOOKY STUFF BACK THEN.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,861
SO MORE GRAIN OF SALT, OKAY.

59
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:26,861
NOW

60
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,299
LET'S COME BACK TO WHAT WAS
HAPPENING RECENTLY --

61
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:40,469
>>HEY, HARRY REID DID SOMETHING
IN THE SENATE.

62
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:41,739
BLESS HIS HEART.

63
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:52,819
AND IF HE FOUND ALIENS, OKAY,
MAYBE HE RESCUED HIS LEGACY A

64
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,230
LITTLE BIT.

65
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,810
BY THE WAY, I LIKE
PROJECT BLUE BOOK.

66
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,810
IF SOMEBODY

67
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,359
COMES TO ME AND SAYS DO YOU WANT
TO BE INVOLVED IN PROJECT BLUE

68
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,139
BOOK, MY ANSWER IS A DEFINITIVE
YES OR A DEFINITIVE NO.

69
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,139
BECAUSE

70
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,029
IT EITHER INVOLVES MURDERING
SOMEBODY OR FINDING ALIENS.

71
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:09,029
I'M

72
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,870
IN FOR THE ALIEN PART, NOT FOR
THE MURDER.

73
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,870
YOU CAN TELL I FIND

74
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,309
THE STORY COOL BUT THEY HAVE
REAL EVIDENCE WE WILL GET TO IN

75
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:16,309
A SECOND.

76
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:21,599
WHERE DID THE MONEY
COME FROM?

77
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,530
WELL --

78
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:36,819
>>NOW, THE MONEY THAT WAS
ALLOCATED TO IT WAS TINY, ONLY

79
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:43,889
$22 MILLION OUT OF AT THE TIME A
$600 BILLION PENTAGON BUDGET.

80
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:44,889
22

81
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,099
MILLION, NOT BILLION, A VERY
SMALL NUMBER FOR THE PENTAGON.

82
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:50,099
I

83
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,090
DON'T LIKE THAT IT WENT TO HARRY
REID'S FRIEND, YOU CAN'T

84
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,389
APPARENTLY DO ANYTHING IN THE
SENATE WITHOUT AT LEAST A LITTLE

85
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,210
CORRUPTION SPRINKLED IN, THEY
WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT, BUT I WISH

86
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,310
IT WENT TO SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT A
FRIEND OF THE GUY WHO FINANCED

87
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,419
IT THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT.

88
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,229
BUT
ANYWAY, EVEN HARRY REID SAYS --

89
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:16,060
>>IT WAS THOSE THREE SENATORS
THAT OKAYED IT.

90
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
ALSO THE FIRST

91
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,520
TIME BLACK MONEY HAS EVER BEEN
USED IN A POSITIVE CONNOTATION,

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,130
USUALLY BLACK MONEY IS, OH, THAT
THING WHERE WE SENT A LOT OF

93
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,090
MONEY AND WEAPONS DOWN TO
NICARAGUA AND 22,000 CIVILIANS

94
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,610
DIED, THAT WAS BLACK MONEY.

95
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,300
OR
OH, A BUNCH OF BILLIONAIRE

96
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,060
DONORS GOT TOGETHER AND GOT
THEMSELVES $1 TRILLION TAX CUT.

97
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,210
THAT WAS BLACK MONEY.

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,639
THIS IS
BLACK MONEY OR DARK MONEY THAT

99
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,669
WENT TO SOMETHING INTERESTING,
TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS UFOS.

100
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,669
BUT

101
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:45,240
NOTICE, BY THE WAY, THOSE TWO
SENATORS WHO APPROVED IT BACK

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,400
THEN APPARENTLY IN A SECURED
ROOM IN THE CAPITAL WHICH IS

103
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:56,470
THOSE THREE SENATORS, RIED IS
NOW RETIRED, INOUYE HAS PASSED

104
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,130
AWAY, AND SO HAS STEVENS.

105
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,520
THEY
WERE BOTH REALLY OLD.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,699
NOW BACK

107
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,349
TO BIGELOW, THE ONE DOING THE
RESEARCH.

108
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,349
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN

109
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,199
HIM ON 60 MINUTES, HE'S VERY
WEALTHY, AND HE'S CERTAINLY VERY

110
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,090
POSITIVE ABOUT WHETHER THERE ARE
ALIEN FORCES ON THIS PLANET AND

111
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,580
WHETHER THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO
US.

112
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,590
HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS --

113
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:32,439
>>LET ME BREAK DOWN THAT
SENTENCE BECAUSE DO ALIENS

114
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,830
EXIST?

115
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,919
ALMOST CERTAINLY,
99.999% CHANCE, AND YOU CAN KEEP

116
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,220
GOING WITH THOSE NINES.

117
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,970
WE ARE
THE ONLY THING IN THE WHOLE

118
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:48,169
UNIVERSE WITH BILLIONS OF STARS
AND GALAXIES AND PLANETS, WE ARE

119
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:50,780
THE ONLY SENTIMENT LIFE FORMS IN
THE UNIVERSE?

120
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
THAT'S

121
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,639
PREPOSTEROUS, ALMOST CERTAINLY
NOT THE CASE, IT'S EGOTISTICAL

122
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,389
TO ARGUE IT WOULD BE THE CASE
AND I WOULD ARGUE BORDERLINE

123
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,520
IGNORANT.

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,129
WHETHER THEY HAVE
VISITED EARTH, THE SECOND PART,

125
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,300
IS A DIFFERENT MATTER AND THAT
REQUIRES EVIDENCE, AND

126
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,330
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD NOT HAD IT.

127
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,290
SO
LET'S DIVE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE.

128
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,470
WE ARE WORKING OUR WAY TOWARDS
THE VIDEO HERE --

129
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:21,780
>>INTERESTING.

130
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:33,060
THIS 

131
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,919
GUY IS
CONVINCED ALIENS EXIST, I DON'T

132
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,210
KNOW IF HE BECAME CONVINCED
BECAUSE OF THE PROJECT OR HE WAS

133
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,919
CONVINCED BEFORE THE PROJECT,
THAT WOULD AFFECT HIS

134
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,180
CREDIBILITY A LITTLE BUT
REMEMBER THEY ARE GATHERING THE

135
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,979
EVIDENCE LARGELY FROM U.S.
MILITARY MEMBERS AND OTHER

136
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:47,310
CREDIBLE SOURCES.

137
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,310
OKAY --

138
00:07:48,310 --> 00:08:14,280
>>THAT STUFF IS REAL, MAN.

139
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,660
DO
WITH THAT INFORMATION WHATEVER

140
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,349
YOU LIKE, LET ME GIVE YOU A
COUPLE MORE FACTS BEFORE THE

141
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,349
VIDEO.

142
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:22,349
THEY SAID THEY COLLECTED
--

143
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:36,729
>>I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNOW
THAT IT WAS RECOVERED FROM THOSE

144
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,750
UFOS, IF THEY KNOW THAT, BUT
BOY, THAT'S INTERESTING.

145
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,750
ALSO --

146
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:52,590
>>BUT REMEMBER, A LOT OF THIS
IS STILL CLASSIFIED SO WE DON'T

147
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,050
KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY
PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AND WHAT

148
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,700
RESULTS THERE WERE.

149
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,830
ALSO --

150
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:18,180
>>AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BUCKLE UP, BRACE FOR IMPACT,

151
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,360
THIS APPEARS TO BE A U.S.
MILITARY PLANE AND ITS CREW

152
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:39,950
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH AN
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT.

153
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:52,810
WATCH.

154
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:07,470
>>THEY DIDN'T HAVE ME UNTIL IT
ROTATED.

155
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,029
THEN WHEN IT ROTATED I

156
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,590
WAS LIKE, OH, THAT'S
INTERESTING.

157
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,590
BECAUSE AN

158
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,500
UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT,
COULD IT BE THAT THE CHINESE

159
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,020
HAVE COME UP WITH A DRONE THAT
IS AMAZING AND COULD DO THAT

160
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
STUFF?

161
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
MAY BE.

162
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,930
BUT IF IT'S NOT
MAYBE THE CHINESE, I DON'T KNOW

163
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,970
WHAT THE OTHER MAYBE IS.

164
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,100
SO
MIND BLOWN.

165
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,149
HOLD.

166
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:33,250
HERE COMES

167
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:39,279
ELIZONDO, HE WAS IN CHARGE OF
THE PROGRAM, HE RAN IT UNTIL THE

168
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,600
FINANCING RAN OUT IN 2012,
HE CONTINUED TO RUN IT WHEN IT

169
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,850
WASN'T TECHNICALLY FINANCED,
THEN IN OCTOBER HE RESIGNED

170
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,300
AND NOW HAS COME PUBLIC, LET'S
LISTEN.

171
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,399
>>LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION,
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT LIFE FROM

172
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,010
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHILE YOU WERE IN
THIS PROGRAM CAME HERE, VISITED,

173
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,010
OBSERVED?

174
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,740
>>I WILL TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT THROUGH THE OBSERVATION,

175
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,529
SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES THAT
WERE APPLIED TO LOOK AT THIS

176
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,649
PHENOMENA, THAT THESE AIRCRAFT,
WE WILL CALL THEM AIRCRAFT, OR

177
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,329
DISPLAYING CHARACTERISTICS THAT
ARE NOT CURRENTLY WITHIN THE

178
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:24,510
U.S. INVENTORY, NOR IN ANY
FOREIGN INVENTORY THAT WE ARE

179
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,540
AWARE OF.

180
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,830
>>I LOVE HOW MILITARY GUYS
TALK.

181
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,360
IT IS NOT CURRENTLY IN THE

182
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,529
U.S. MILITARY INVENTORY, NOR IN
ANY INVENTORY WE ARE AWARE OF.

183
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,730
ALREADY SOUNDS BADASS.

184
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,510
BURNETT DOING A GOOD JOB WITH
THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION,

185
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,290
LET'S WATCH.

186
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,100
>>YOU ARE BEING CLEAR, BUT THE
ANSWER IS YES?

187
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,480
>>I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF
THE GOVERNMENT, OBVIOUSLY, I'M

188
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,440
NOT IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
ANYMORE, MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS

189
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,240
THAT THERE IS COMPELLING
EVIDENCE THAT WE MAY NOT BE

190
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,550
ALONE.

191
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,630
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

192
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,889
>>HERE'S WHAT IT MEANS, [LASER
SOUND EFFECT].

193
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,389
THEY'RE HERE.

194
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,480
LOOK, GUYS, I DON'T KNOW.

195
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,670
OF
COURSE I DON'T KNOW.

196
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,670
IT REQUIRES

197
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,029
EVIDENCE.

198
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,400
BEFORE THERE WAS NO
EVIDENCE THAT WE KNEW OF

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,910
PUBLICLY, NOW THERE IS SOME.

200
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,920
MAKE OF IT WHAT YOU WILL.

201
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
AND I

202
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,880
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.
AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT

203
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,509
THEY ARE UNIDENTIFIED AND WILL
LATER BE IDENTIFIED AND WE WILL

204
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,170
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON.

205
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,259
I NEED AN ALIEN BAN

206
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,670
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
HELL IS GOING ON.

207
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,709
WE HAVE TO BAN

208
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,589
PEOPLE COMING IN FROM OTHER
GALAXIES.

209
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,630
IT'S EXCITING TIMES.

210
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,269
AND THE OTHER THING THAT TRIPPED
ME OUT FROM THAT VIDEO IS WHEN

211
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:47,209
THE PILOT SAID, QUOTE, THERE'S A
WHOLE FLEET OF THEM.

212
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,290
[LASER

213
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,519
SOUND EFFECT] WOW.

214
00:12:55,519 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S ALL
I'VE GOT TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
