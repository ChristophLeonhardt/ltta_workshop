so I'm here at CPAC 2018 and ben shapiro spoke today and would you believe it there weren't riots nobody in the audience died from fright people didn't go screaming from the building everything was fine there was an exchange of ideas but that isn't so on campuses like UC Berkeley where groups like yaf young America's Foundation have set up speeches for ben shapiro that have devolved into insanity from the left joining me now is spencer brown spokesman why yeah thanks for being here thank you for having me so like i said we were here ben shapiro spoke interesting speech we're fine yeah you know it's it's amazing you know when people actually are open to hearing different ideas everybody survives every time I mean clearly these people on college campuses were not really afraid of Benjamin they're really afraid of young very foundation they just like to act like whiny babies claim they are to get attention I've watched how you produce your events I've watched you guys go through all of the proper channels spend big money on security and still your shot absolutely it's ridiculous the lengths that schools will go to today in order to shut down a conservative you know sometimes they shove people like ben shapiro to remote parts of campus sometimes they put a curfew on them and say they can't speak you know after 3:00 p.m. or something like that and it's really ridiculous sometimes the school will offer counseling and safe spaces and coloring pages and bring in outside counselors to try to help them and it's basically just all to the end of trying to prevent conservatives from having a voice on their campus now i'm glad you here because i've always wanted to know the inside baseball so we don't go through the intricacies of exactly what their emails or communication say but you know what we read what we're told was that they'll tell you okay hey why if you've got Ben Shapiro ranked culture Gavin McGinnis or anybody's controversial they're coming to speak great I find all these people very interesting we want to hear them and apparently what we're told is they communicate with you and they tell you we're good to go and then at the eleventh hour it seems to me anyway they pull the rug out from under you and make up some ridiculous excuse as to why you can't be there when we all know that it's because you're bucking conservative guests know that's exactly right and what we see them continually do is come up with excuses that just sort of compound themselves but are continually disproved by their actions I think the best way to look at this is at UC Berkeley when ben shapiro spoke there you know we're suing UC berkeley now because of their actions but they initially said they had no room available for ben then magically after we announced to the press that berkeley somehow and all of its campus has no room they found a room just like that it's amazing and that using and then they gave us this venue and then they said oh we're gonna limit it to only the lower level so the top two floors you can't use because somebody might throw a chair for themselves from the balcony because of conservative speech then literally at the eleventh hour they announced that tickets we're gonna have to be picked up the day before somewhere on the other side of campus and then they wouldn't release tickets that were unclaimed to standby line so basically they did everything they could to prevent people from actually getting to here but it's like it's like hosting the Daytona 500 then putting speed bombs everything exactly and then just taking the first car out and saying ass over part are they really throwing you this did they tell you you can beat it and that they're really throwing yeah exactly we see this ben shapiro is scheduled to speak at the University of Minnesota this Monday and it's the same thing with that school where they're putting all these security restrictions on it saying you can't speak on the main part of our campus because they're skyways and tunnels but then just recently they went ahead and approved at a counter event to bench top Rios lecture in the middle of campus just steps from where the Conservatives were told it's not safe for plastic guns and shoot images President Trump video screaming kill kill kill and that's apparently okay because that's exactly it's been crazy to see actually just our events before and after Trump's election the opposition to our events as far as administrators trying to shut it down or protesters trying to silence our speakers that number tripled after the election and so you see this trumped arrangement system has a lot of people call it where they're just saying they can't handle it so what they do is they just flash out they get violent they try to shut it down anyway the university seem to be buying into this and it all amounts to basically unconstitutional hecklers vetoes on conservative speech I love about this though we've got to learn how to make lemonade out of lemons on the right let's stick all these people on those mental health watch avoid buying guns we've seen a lot of you know a lot of unhinged I think it's a good word leftist on these campuses it is you know what it's a fake that's not hyperbole that's a fair choice of war absolutely behavior it really is there really any way Spencer thank you so much for
