NOBODY WANTS TO SHARE THE RISK

28
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,735
IN CALLING OUT ABSURDITY BECAUSE

29
00:00:56,736 --> 00:01:00,171

58
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:57,362

00:02:23,722 --> 00:02:25,390
CLAPPING TO KNOW IF MY JOKES ARE

76
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:27,625

AUDIENCE ON MY SIDE.

78
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,294

HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE.

86
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,572
WHEN YOU HAVE A LOUD CROWD, IT

87
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:42,640
FORCES THE OPPOSING TEAM INTO

88
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:44,175

89
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:44,576

TO YOUR POINT ABOUT AUTISM, THIS

91
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:49,114
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST BLIND

THEY DID A JOB AND GOT PAID FOR

129
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:46,905
IT.

130
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,907

166
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,748
IN ACADEMIA, THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

175
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,996
HE GOT ALL THE ATTENTION AND

176
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:23,401
