1
00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:01,740
PROCESS.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,910
>> YEAH, ALSO ONE OF THE MOST

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,244
ELUSIVE.

4
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:06,578
SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN KEEPING

5
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:08,213
A VERY LOW PROFILE THIS WEEK.

6
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:10,149
SHE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A

7
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,017
VERY INTENSE PRESSURE CAMPAIGN.

8
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:13,352
THERE HAVE BEEN HUGE PROTESTS

9
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,720
OUTSIDE HER SENATE OFFICE.

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,455
SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING MOST OF

11
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:18,557
HER TIME IN HER HIDEAWAY OFFICE

12
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:20,125
AND A PLACE WHERE THE PRESS

13
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,061
CAN'T REACH HER AND WHY YOU SEE

14
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:23,662
ALL OF THESE CAMERAS LINED UP

15
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,364
OUTSIDE THIS HEARING ROOM.

16
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:27,233
WE ALL KNOW THAT SENATOR

17
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,768
COLLINS IS THE CHAIRWOMAN OF

18
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:29,235
THIS COMMITTEE.

19
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,671
THERE WILL BE A HEARING AT 9:30.

20
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:33,339
EVERYBODY IS LINED UP HOPING TO

21
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:34,974
GRAB HER AND ASK HER QUESTIONS

22
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:36,910
WHEN SHE WALKS IN THIS ROOM IN

23
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,044
JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

24
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:40,847
SHE IS GOING TO BE ASKED ABOUT

25
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,982
WHERE SHE STANDS ON THE JUDGE

26
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:43,917
KAVANAUGH VOTE AND ALSO LIKELY

27
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:46,019
GOING TO BE ASKED ABOUT WHAT

28
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,187
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT

29
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,289
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AT THAT

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:50,223
RALLY LAST NIGHT.

31
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,092
ANOTHER CRITICAL SWING VOTE

32
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,194
HERE, REPUBLICAN SENATOR JEFF

33
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,061
FLAKE CALLED THOSE COMMENTS

34
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:55,428
APPALLING.

35
00:00:55,428 --> 00:00:57,997
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

36
00:00:57,997 --> 00:00:59,399
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, IF WHAT

37
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,100
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID LAST

38
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,734
NIGHT, IF THAT COULD HAVE A

39
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:05,038
REAL IMPACT ON HOW THESE THREE

40
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:05,772
CRITICAL REPUBLICAN SENATORS

41
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,607
FLAKE, COLLINS AND MURCOWSKI,

42
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,042
COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW

43
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:09,476
THEY VOTE.

44
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,344
NOW, IN TERMS OF TIMING, OF

45
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:14,180
COURSE, ALL OF THIS HINGES ON

46
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,983
WHEN THE SENATE MAJORITY

47
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,818
LEADER, MITCH MCCONNELL, FILES

48
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:19,152
CLOTURE.

49
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,286
SO FAR HE HASN'T DONE IT.

50
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:21,387
HE SAID HE WANTS TO HAVE THIS

51
00:01:21,387 --> 00:01:23,723
VOTE BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

52
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:24,791
THE EARLIEST HE COULD FILE

53
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,559
CLOTURE WOULD BE TODAY.

54
00:01:26,559 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WOULD PUSH THE
