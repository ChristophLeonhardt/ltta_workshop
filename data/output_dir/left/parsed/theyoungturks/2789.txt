EARLIER THIS WEEK, A STORY WENT
VIRAL INVOLVING A TEACHER
IN LOUISIANA WHO CALLED INTO
QUESTION ARRAYS AT THE
SUPERINTENDENT WAS GOING TO GET
TO THE TUNE OF $38,000.
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TEACHERS
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE NOT
RECEIVED A RAISE IN YEARS AND SO
DURING THIS PUBLIC MEETING, SHE
DECIDED TO VOICE HER CONCERNS
AND THE BOARD PRESIDENTS, NOT
ONLY KICKED HER OUT BUT GAVE A
NOD TO THE MARSHALL IN THE
ROOM AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE GOT
ARRESTED.
THE SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT HAS
DECIDED TO DEFEND THE
MARSHALL'S DECISION TO ARREST
HER.
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU HIS
STATEMENTS IN JUST A
SECOND, BUT I JUST WANT TO SHOW
YOU THE VIDEO AGAIN TO GIVE
YOU AN IDEA OF HOW RIDICULOUS
THIS WAS.
TAKE A LOOK.
SHE SPOKE UP DURING PUBLIC
COMMENTS.
IT'S BASICALLY TAKING IT OUT OF
OUR POCKETS.
HER ISSUE, THE
SUPERINTENDENT'S NEW CONTRACT.
ANY PERSON IN A POSITION OF
LEADERSHIP GETTING ANY TYPE OF
RAISE, I FEEL LIKE IT IS A SLAP
IN THE FACE ALL THE TEACHERS,
CAFETERIA WORKERS, ANY OTHER
SUPPORT STAFF THAT WE HAVE.
SHE RECEIVED A WARNING DIET WAS
PUBLIC COMMENTS ONLY, NOT A
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
ALTHOUGH BOARD OFFICIALS
WERE ANSWERING HER QUESTIONS.
AFTER BEING CALLED ON THE SECOND
TIME, THAT'S WHEN THE CITY
MARSHALL STEPPED IN.
EXCUSE ME.
IS IT AGAINST POLICY TO STAND?
SIR, DO NOT.
THIS IS THE MOST IS GRATEFUL.
SHE LEFT THE MEETING, BUT IN THE
HALLWAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CAN YOU EXPLAIN?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?
STOP RESISTING.
I AM NOT, YOU JUST PUSHED ME TO
THE FLOOR.
SIR, HOLD ON I AM WAY SMALLER
THAN YOU.
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
OUTRAGED AFTER SEEING THE
VIDEO BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
SCHOOL BOARD IS DEFENDING
THE DECISION TO GET HER
ARRESTED.
ANTHONY FONTANA SAID:
CHOICES 
LIKE 
ASKING A QUESTION.
I LOVE AMERICA.
I DEFEND IT.
I WANT TO GET BACK TO AN AMERICA
THAT BELIEVED IN FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND BELIEVES IN ITS
CITIZENS.
FOR US TO TREAT OUR CITIZENS
THAT WAY, YOU EITHER AGREE
OR DISAGREE ON WHETHER THE
SUPERINTENDENT HAS SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN THE RAZOR WHETHER THE
TEACHER SHOULD GET THE RACE, BUT
DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK THAT
THE TEACHER SHOULD BE ARRESTED.
A TEACHER ARRESTED FOR ASKING A
QUESTION OR SPEAKING OUT ON
HER POSITION ON THE ISSUE.
IT IS A POLICE STATE EVERYWHERE
AND ALL OF COURSE THE GUY
DEFENDS IT.
HE IS THE ONE YOU SAW ON TAPE
NODDING TO THE MARSHALL
LIKE TAKE HER OUT.
IT IS A TERRIBLE ABUSE OF POWER.
