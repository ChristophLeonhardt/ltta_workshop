Steve Bannon is out at bright Park so we've been talking for about five days about a book which again shocked Smee as a reader in America but fire and fury the tell-all about the the Trump White House with all of its many revealing quotes about Steve Bannon and what he thinks about the president what he thinks about the president's inner circle and family led to Bannon apologizing for those quotes perhaps most memorably where he called the Trump Tower meeting treasonous and bad shit and unpatriotic so he apologized and he apologized but it was not good enough for now and he has been forced out of Breitbart we've got a little statement that's good news too so good double good news there you go I don't know how good it is but it is good news now they they put out a statement from the company's chief executives saying mr. Bannon and Breitbart will work together on a smooth transition and Bannon added that he was proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform yes it is amazing how much racism they've been able to stoke in such a short period of times but yeah don't find a new Grand Dragon soon enough I think they'll be okay I think that under his leadership and the team he has assembled I think that they can stoke racial animus and all of that on their own now I don't think I think he can let them go now and flourish on their own but for Bannon what's interesting about this is that he apparently did not see this coming just days before he stepped down he insisted to friends and others that he wasn't going anywhere according to two different sources that have spoken with him he said he expected to remain at Breitbart helm and believes he would remain an influential figure in conservative politics and he's also said in recent days that he was keeping his plans alive to build up a public nonprofit citizens of the American Republic insisting that he would have funding from other GOP donors even if the Mercer's had cut ties with him after Trump fired him and after he left the White House the appeal for Steve Bannon was and Breitbart was look we've got this guy who's a conduit to the White House and can come and and rally our people and then when it turned out that he was cut off from the White House he was no good to Breitbart anymore after what he'd done so it was inevitable that this was going to happen he'll land but he land with the same influence and he won't be side by side with candidates who think that his presence will be helpful anymore even the worst of the candidates as Roy Moore was who has not conceded yet Roy Moore was in Alabama thought that Oh having been in here was having a de facto opponent of the president has supported Luther strange the same thing that dynamic is gone for Steve Bannon so I think it's good news because a voice has been quiet and not the way we wanted a quieter but that's a good thing yeah I think it could be that this is this is game over I mean the guys on the older side but I don't know that it necessarily is not necessarily because although everyone loves to say how smart he is and all that well I mean we've learned a lot about what he did in the White House I would question those intellectual credentials but he is I guess adaptive and he's certainly vicious and I think an opportunity is being presented to him right now so he's been cast out and at least in the short term it looks like most of trumps backers and also the base are staying with Trump but will they forever I don't know he's becoming much less popular he might be pushing for a pathway to citizenship for illegals he's gonna be going to Davos which is like the den of globalists internationally and he gave a bunch of money to the rich I mean some of his base is gonna figure that out eventually and their health insurance is gonna go up thanks to the changes that came in the tax bill and so if Bannon can position himself as not the person who lost the favor of Trump but the person who Trump lost the way from this true trumpism this ethno-nationalism or whatever you want to call white supremacy these days then it could be that if his base does grow disaffected with Trump they need to go with someone and maybe they'll remember the glory days with banding in the past right well that's what do you think happens to Breitbart I think I think that Bannon is just one example of a group of monsters to be quite honest with you but I mean Breitbart will still exist they'll still do what they're doing he's not the only person who spouts this type of vicious rhetoric that rooms - you know minorities and you know certain policies in the US so I I do I'm not really that I'm not celebrating it as much as other people are because I don't see this as much of a victory you know there's still a huge portion of crazy right-wing conspiracy theory type people that get taken seriously that so fear and hatred in in America and it's it's a problem that I see growing not you know dwindling down I think it needs to be addressed in a different way I do but I what I think is so good about it is I think that it really instead because of Benin and so I feel like they're not I think people equated Bannen with Breitbart that they didn't know what Breitbart was many people before they knew who Bannon was and then they started looking and noticing it so I think that the it's it it hurts that organization not forever like you said but I do think that it's it's an important thing they have to start again and people are not going to be looking at them as influencer makers right away without Banat so I think that's important that's something yeah maybe I guess a lot to see anyway I just would not be surprised to find him finding some sort of wealthy back or some crazy billionaire feels entirely possible and suspiciously it'll be raising them a lot of money really fast yeah weird that sometimes works out what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it and you get a completely ad free if you could become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm /join
