enemy now right here in Arizona's Bram Resnick he's a political reporter and anchor at KPIX our NBC station right here in Phoenix RN Claudia Maria paletas the state government and politics reporter at the arizona republic' chief moderated the one and only debate of the Senate race and in Washington my good friends Howard Fineman and NBC News contributor and Danny pluck of the American Enterprise Institute also an NBC News contributor you guys get to be the cat callers and the actual hecklers of all of us here in Phoenix Danny and Howard but no offense I'm going to start local then we're gonna go to you guys for national ram I want to play for you some chats I had with some voters about this race because it does seem as if Arizona's a bit shell-shocked that they're in the battleground take a listen is this Senate race that we're seeing this year in this state do you think that's emblematic of what politics is going to be like in the next four or five years I am afraid to say yes because I hope not but it was very rough you said bran I would say and I have three or four more other voters that have said similar things to me they're just burned out and the negativity and it dawned on me Oh Arizona's not experienced what a Floridian or Ohio and has experienced over the years Arizona now knows how Cleveland feels yes every to two to four years we're seeing record spending not just in the Senate race but in ballot initiatives congressional races the governor's race one hundred million dollars which blows away any kind of spending we've seen before the negative ads on the mcsalley side started to think the day after she won the primary here's some cinema and I saw this in the Senate race Kyrsten Sinema was up with positive ads back in April right so this has been going on a long time and right now it is really really intense Maria you moderated this to the one and only debate and trust me Bram and I wish there were more than that no no offense we were hoping to get our hands at least on a debate here the amazing report from our reporter in the field bond Hilliard was the two candidates sat there five minutes for the debate started and didn't even acknowledge each other it's personal for these two is it not it absolutely is and I think Bram alluded to that with the tone of some of the ads that we've seen which both of them have criticized but yet they're still on the airwaves of course it was not very warm between them before the debate wasn't anything nasty but the the photographers videographers who are in there we're trying to get them to engage and they just were not play involved so one thing that's also come through and talking with voters even ones that I think have already decided who they're going to vote for even the candidate they may vote for they don't feel like they know either candidate no they don't look at Kyrsten Sinema right now this is Kyrsten Sinema circa 2018 running against Kyrsten Sinema 2002 to 2010 is that to mix a least right now I have a run against right and Kyrsten Sinema congressman cinema has not really put herself out there for people like me reporters we get maybe four minute bursts of interviews and events so they're not doing that you saw this debate where people saw a very controlled measured Kyrsten Sinema to those of us who've known her for many years as I have I thought the Kyrsten Sinema we met say 15 years ago martha mcsalley representing tucson is a newcomer to most folks represents a tucson area district in southern Arizona she's brand-new and at least until now hasn't done much to introduce herself to the state as a whole you talked to some people Murray and they say I did she's attached herself more to President Trump than they ever thought she would right absolutely earlier on 2016 was not a huge not a not a big vocal Trump supporter during her primary which was of course against Kelly Ward and the famous infamous former sheriff joe arpaio we saw her move take a hard right there becoming more Pro Trump more vocal about that so now the question is is that a good thing or bad thing because she's sort of defending on both sides for those who want to see her move closer to transfer she's playing that up for moderates where maybe that's a turn-off she's trying to say that she's been consistent the whole time all right let's pull the lens back I'll go 30,000 feet Howard Fineman Danny pluck Howard I want to play a quick montage Beto O'Rourke the Bobby Kennedy of Millennials just to go negative let me play a mash-up of his of these of these hits on crews that they've unveiled today Ted Cruz has voted to take away health care from millions of American families he's tried repeatedly to roll back protections for pre-existing conditions at a time when nearly half of the school teachers in Texas are working a second job just to make ends meet Ted Cruz wants to take our public tax dollars out of their classrooms turn him into vouchers he's vowed to deport every single dreamer he's selling paranoia and fear instead of solutions so Howard I was checking the calendar one more time it's October 17 boy that seems awfully late to decide to go to try to go contrast now yeah I think so I think Benoit Roark may be excited by the his own charisma there in the response to his anti political campaign decided little late to do this but listen in the big picture here the Democrats got to pick up one of these places Mitch McConnell you're in Arizona Mitch McConnell sees Arizona is key he's focused really his money and his attention almost more in Arizona than any other single state Danny pluck I got to play for you another piece of the Phil Bredesen interview with Leanne because and I want to remind people Phil Bredesen said he would have voted yes on Cavanaugh now take a listen to what now he thinks has impacted him in this Senate race Danny I think what's happening is with with the way in which the Cavanaugh hearings proceeded and sort of how much and how partisan they became and how bitter at the end it tends to bring people to the back to their party oh yeah I remember I'm a Republican I remember I'm a Democrat and I think that's that's happened all over the country and it certainly has happened here and here in Tennessee Danny he's basically hinting that him publicly saying yes and we heard some reports that some volunteers quit over that that even though he's from a red state that actually it might have cost him more votes on the Left than in the middle honestly I can't I can't say you know what we talked about in the wake of Kavanagh was everybody kind of returning home and I think that for a lot of Republicans who didn't like Donald Trump and were offended by Donald Trump they were they were even more offended by the Cavanaugh hearings the same is probably true on the left for the Democrats and that's what great ascent is is going to pay the price for you know you it is not the time to triangulate unfortunately elections aren't about nuance and and frankly they aren't about how you're going to act in Washington they're about playing to your home team and I'm playing to your base that he didn't do that speaking of the base Howard Fineman would you rather be Ted Cruz or Bob Menendez on election day I'm gonna say Ted Cruz for now I think I think Menendez was a distant star on their on the screen a few weeks ago but people in the know in New Jersey we're telling me that that was going to be a tough race and it is about the people it is about the the individual and who best represents the and can excite the base Bob Menendez is gonna have trouble I think exciting the base in New Jersey and New Jersey likes moderate Republicans and he's up against somebody who could at least style himself as a moderate Republican I think he's in real trouble and Danny pleco we heard the president in an interview say that if Republicans lose control the house it's not on him is it number one or is he right that you know his presence is rescuing some candidates I can tell you this martha mcsalley if she wins is probably gonna owe owe it to Trump you know I'm always wondering how Donald Trump earned that middle name mr. helpful that's just such an incredible statement for the president to make it suggests that that he believes that the outcome is that were you know that his party is going to lose is gonna lose the House of Representatives but I agree with you I think that actually he's been pretty helpful to people like mcsalley and to others where he's gone out he's rallied the base he's rallied the crowds and there's a reason why people like her are in fact standing with him despite the fact that nationally he's just not that popular let me bring it back to Arizona with with Braman Murray here for him you just gave me a stunning stat here that may give heartburn everybody here how many Senate races is the state of Arizona going to be home to in the next five in the next six years including this year we have eight Senate races through 2024 eight US Senate races so TV stations congratulations you're gonna make a boatload of money because you got the McCain seat twice twenty and twenty two this seat up again at twenty four four are you a swing state I think by then we will be I think demographics will take hold at some time Maria does this does the state's political class sort of accept the idea that hey I guess we're becoming Florida and Ohio we better get used to it in terms of the demographic shifts or in terms of the tone of well I would say more of the tone I think the demographic shifts everybody's been watching for a while but in tone you know that that there in the national stage now I think they are as we were I know we were chatting a little bit earlier these political attack ads are just ubiquitous right now and we've heard a lot of complaints from people but as a reporter when I talk to voters that's what they remember best even if they've outraged them they know that it's it's part of the game they're paying attention to what they say whether they're stopping at that point or fact-checking I know after the debate there were a lot of requests for for a fact checks they're paying attention I was talking earlier about how Cavanaugh in Tennessee that that may have backfired and Bredesen to say he was a YES on Cavanaugh may have alienated he didn't need to cast a vote he did feed to say anything was Kavanagh one of those where this was a red-blue divide here and you couldn't cross the didn't cross the swords here's something very interesting that came out in the debate the other night Kyrsten Sinema as soon as it was it was as sure that Cavanaugh was going to be on the bench she issued a statement immediately saying she would have voted no but she does not want to say that on TV she remembered the debate yes yes I would have voted no I interviewed her a week or two before the now long after he was elevated would not say no hmm it's uh she's also focused when she sort of defends that on him her impression that he lied under oath and less about the sexual assault allegations I'll tell you this we think Arizona's a swing state but the two candidates are acting like it's a light red station that's the that's the message I've received from the two of you and we pray man Brant thanks for coming on great work I know
