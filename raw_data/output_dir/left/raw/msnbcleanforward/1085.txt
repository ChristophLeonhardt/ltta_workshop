122
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:45,294
SO THE MEMO YOU REFERRED TO IS FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC

123
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:45,661
FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER.

124
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,163
HOLDER. AND WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT

125
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,665
AND WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT PROSECUTORS SHOULD AVOID ACTIONS

126
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,867
PROSECUTORS SHOULD AVOID ACTIONS THAT MIGHT IMPACT AN ELECTION.

127
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:53,535
THAT MIGHT IMPACT AN ELECTION. SO IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY HAVE

128
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,771
SO IT DOESN’T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE TARGETED AGAINST A

129
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:56,138
TO BE TARGETED AGAINST A CANDIDATE.

130
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,073
CANDIDATE. I THINK THAT MUELLER WILL

131
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,042
I THINK THAT MUELLER WILL RESPECT THE SPIRIT OF THAT

132
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:00,842
RESPECT THE SPIRIT OF THAT GUIDELINE.

133
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:02,277
GUIDELINE. BUT I DON’T THINK HE’S COUNTING

134
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,746
BUT I DON’T THINK HE’S COUNTING OFF THE DAYS UNTIL SEPTEMBER

135
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:08,850
OFF THE DAYS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 7th, AS GIULIANI FANTASIZES.

00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:12,488
WE’VE GOT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST GIULIANI’S HYPE AND SPIN THAT

138
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:14,423
GIULIANI’S HYPE AND SPIN THAT MUELLER IS DRAGGING HIS FEET.

139
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,091
MUELLER IS DRAGGING HIS FEET. FAR FROM IT.
