get prices down now Donald Trump steps up the pressure on major oil producers will obey appease the US president and what about Iranian oil exports being blocked by US sanctions this is inside story hello and welcome to the program alfred abdel hamid OPIC leaders and their allies are due to meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss something which affects us all the price of oil the price of Brent crude oil is close to a four-year high trading at just under $80 a barrel that's still well short of the 2008 peak of a hundred and forty seven dollars all prices have risen by around forty percent in the past year and President Donald Trump is demanding prices fall before midterm elections in November which will also be a critical test of his popularity he also wants oil producers to make up for the fall in Iranian exports because of the real position of US sanctions Trump tweeted we protect the countries of the Middle East they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices we will remember the OPEC monopoly must get prices down now Trump's call poses a dilemma for Saudi Arabia if it tows his line some OPEC members may perceive Riyadh as doing Washington's bidding at their expense on the other hand the kingdom can hardly displease its strongest ally to discuss this and the OPEC meeting in Algeria we are joined from London minutiae Rita Keene an independent oil and energy consultant and former OPEC official in Moscow Mihal crew Tajin and oil and gas analyst and partner at ruse energy consulting agency and also the SME Hamdi a Middle East analyst and editor of the magazine international interests gentlemen welcome to the program Sami let me start with you does Trump have a point when he says that Middle Eastern countries are pushing the prices higher and higher I think we have to remember what caused a lot of the chaos in recent years in the Middle East in terms of economic diversification some of the grand moves that Saudi Arabia the UAE and other Arab countries have taken it was the low oil prices low oil prices Saudi Arabia so no need to engage in economic diversification or indeed to pursue vision 2030 or the neon cities or the like what's even more ironic is that the low oil prices was caused by the US shale industry which seemed to put more and more oil in the market driving the prices down and Saudi Arabia actually started fighting the u.s. trying to outdo the US by flooding the market with oil to bring the price so low that shale couldn't could would not be feasible so I think with regards to a Donald Trump about whether they want to bring the prices up this is very true the OPEC countries all of them they benefit from a high price let's remember why Venezuela is a failed state today it's a failed state because the low oil price has sent the economy crashing a higher oil price gives reprieve for a lot of these countries these OPEC countries who are suffering from the economic difficulties as a result of years of relying on oil so in other words when the oil prices start going back up these OPEC countries find that they have more revenue they have more money in order to enact infrastructure projects or the like within their particular countries so it might in short what's particularly ironic is that the u.s. which forced a lot of these countries to bend over backwards as a result of the low oil prices as a result of the shale oil industry is now demanding that the OPEC countries bring the oil prices back down once more and to suffer further as a result of Donald Trump being scared of what might happen in the midterm elections so Manu share now OPEC countries and non-opec countries are meeting tomorrow in Algeria what do you think is gonna happen here what will be the focus of the conversation well let me say that tomorrow is the joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting is not the whole all the ministers or OPEC countries and then uh Norfolk which have joined together in the last two years the I think it's Russia and a northern on OPEC countries and then Saudi Arabia Venezuela and Kuwait and and so on important ones out there really is there yes they are their job as I'm saying that they are not supposed to decide on what to do they are a technical group what has the same market monitoring committee to look at the information that the technical analysts and technical group within OPEC and non-opec have given them and look at it examine it consult with each others look at the supply demand balance in the world oil market they are really business people and then also for see what the in the next five six months would be the performance of the global economy is going to be a boom bust a recession which of course would affect the demand for oil and then the supply of oil from United States and others that technical people have tried to estimate for the next few months and out of that they will see how much is the demand for OPEC as a whole and for open on OPEC group that are part of this joint operation which have limited their supply that is their job of course having done all this and discussed with each other consulted their excellencies with each other then of course they have to look at the political aspects the one that you made an introduction already so I want to say they don't make a decision they try to summarize and brief the full ministerial conference of OPEC wishes to meet in on the third of December but of course their ideas and commet comments would influence what the other ministers would do and so we can now discuss what these people might inside or might prefer might recommend but let's say it is not they would not decide and on an actual policy that OPEC would follow okay and what's Russia's role in all of this I mean over the past few years relationship between Moscow and Riyadh have got grown closer there is talk that maybe these two countries together trying to fill the gap that will be left because of the Iran sanctions well Reza's role is very specific basically when the reza agreed to decrease oil production it was against the benchmark of october 2016 when the resin oil production fee for some domestic reason and after that it fell down to the irregular level again absolutely naturally and the Russian Minister of Energy said it was carrying out the promise it gave to OPEC basically a Russian oil companies are producing at the maximum of their capacity and they are not prepared to increase production to accommodate the wishes of Saudi Arabia or President Trump or anyone else in essentially next year or maybe a year from now rational production is going to start declining it has already peaked the decline will be caused by the deterioration of oil reserves which the majority of oil which remains still in Russia 70 percent of that is hard to recover and it is difficult to produce this oil at the current level of prices so please do not expect that Russia is going to increase oil production on the contrary it is going to decrease it so Asami rather envy of that it seems that the owners will fall again on the Gulf countries Saudi Arabia the UAE now what will be their mood considering this tweet of Donald Trump who basically said you guys are safe because we keep you safe I'm sure they're not very happy about that we have to remember that Saudi Arabia and the UAE don't actually want to increase production Saudi Arabia has been giving lip service to Donald Trump until now this is not the first time that Donald Trump has asked Saudi Arabia to increase production there was a tweet a few months ago where he said that Saudi Arabia had promised and in that tweet was removed later oh no he went back on that particular tweet Saudi Arabia does not want the prices to go down why because the investment that they expected envision 2030 the Aramco valuation that they had was not what they expected the amount of money that they expected to come in to Saudi Arabia from these various economic projects has not matched expectations so in other words the higher the oil price comes the more of a buffer the more of a cushion that they have in order to come up with a new plan in order to assess this situation how to come up with a better solution the problem is that Trump is applying very heavy pressure on Saudi Arabia although the south it is this view that Saudi Arabia and Trump are very very close allies we need to remember that Trump flip-flops based on how much money comes into the US so for example initially he supported the Qatar blockade and then in April this year he invited the Emir of Qatar to Washington and then sent his advisors to Riyadh to put pressure on them to stop the blockade so in other words Trump is flip-flopping and the Saudis know that when Trump threatens them and threats threatens to lift the support that he's been giving them they know that he's particularly serious Saudi Arabia will go to the OPEC countries but the OPEC countries know that Saudi Arabia deep down does not want the oil prices to go down either so it'd be very interesting because now it's a matter of sovereignty is Saudi Arabia really a puppet state to the extent that they will have the nerve to go to the other OPEC countries after them guys look we need trump so you guys need to increase production and bring the low oil prices down it would be absolutely incredible by all standards for side arabia to sit and look these opec countries in the face and tell them that trump told me to bring the prices down so we have to bring the prices down even though that is a saudi arabia that will be taking the hit so I think it's quite profound the way in which Trump has caused this scurry in the OPEC countries all because he is suffering or potentially suffering from the midterm elections whereby his base are the ones who are becoming very much affected by increased oil prices they can't manage share you know OPEC from the inside very well now we have a situation where at the heart of all of this is obviously the illumines on Iran and they will kick in just two days before the midterm elections now so when everybody is in the room or even at the moment you can hear statements coming out from all sides Saudi Arabia according to Jews Sami is in a difficult position doesn't want to be seen as the puppet of the Trump administration Iran on the other side has a lot of veto power within OPEC and his say is actually putting Saudi Arabia on the spot isn't it well I wouldn't put it that way you see there is so much being said as to political differences recent months between Iran and Saudi Arabia there have been greater political differences between these different countries within OPEC Iran and Iraq we're at war with each other in 1980s but I want to emphasize that these ministers when they get together looking at the oil market they are really more concentrating as business leaders and trying to understand the market and see for what is good for all of them to do of course there are priorities short term long term but those are all I would say technical decision-making and this is what would happen here as well but when the Iranian Ministry of Oil Minister says I will block any OPEC decision that poses the slightest threat to Iran how are we supposed to see this or understand this well these are statements which are made by ministers before they actually meet in an OPEC full official conference which would be on the 3rd of December whenever there are levels of prices being high to low the different ministers make statement they usually less obviously but on occasions in the past they have made a statement so there is naturally the wish of Iranian Minister and Iranian government is that when Iran is put in a corner and the United States and President Trump and the US Department of Treasury are blatantly and in a bullying way they tell all the Iranian oil customers those who buy oil from Iran they threatened them that they should stop buying oil from Iran otherwise they will put this and that if they are operating in America they wouldn't do this or the banking limitations etc this is a bullying tactic so obviously Iranian people Iranian government who are upset that the big power as such is trying to act in this way very open-minded using force and so the reactions are that look we expect our other members of OPEC that we are in this joint Club we have been together for since 1960 and so on to not to give in and try to also accommodate Iran and this is an obvious demand but I'm sure even the Iranian ministers and others they do agree as we had done in the past that Oh big asshole doesn't want the prices to go too high and not obviously too low they don't want the price to go down because they want to have good revenue as mr. Hamdi you just just mentioned they don't want to lose revenue but I want to say that it is not only one way in the past in the history of warfare there have been occasions that Omegas a group increased production they agreed an increase production to get the prices down and they might they have known it in the past but on this occasion in fortunately it is mixed with these rhetorical statements and political pressure from the United States and so on and so forth Moscow you said earlier that Russia cannot increase by its production by very much so there is supposedly going to be a gap of 2 million barrels how do you think it's going to be filled well basically I do not think it will be Russell that that is going to fill in this gap Russia for Russia cooperation with the PEC is very important in well for several reasons first Despres because of the russian virtual contribution to the joint effort not material contribution in the form of holding production down or increase in production but in the form of oral interventions the various declaration of solidarity and sometimes Russia that it is changing the level of production to accommodate to production to the wishes of OPEC but basically it is not doing anything of the kind because the it is the companies that determine how much oil they are producing but it is very important even orally because the level of cooperation is a factor to push the prices up and higher prices are very unnecessary for the Russian government because basically the oil companies in Russia get very very little from high oil prices we have a sliding scale of taxes and if the oil price goes up it is the government that takes this profit this incremental profit but not the companies they get just a very small portion of the incremental value okay and Sammy what other country could step up is production is Iraq able to do that for example I think Iraq is mired in its own issues besar eyes is full of protests and that's the main oil city in Iraq I think Trump the reason he puts pressure on Saudi Arabia is because he wants the Saudis to do it he wants the Saudis to be the ones who flood the market and from his perspective he says look I took a run out of the game I want you guy you guys now can take the market share the Saudis are not seeing it that way with regards to Donald Trump I think the oil is there that there is the capacity to fill those 2 million barrels if OPEC genuinely decided to do so however the problem is OPEC are not necessarily happy with the treatment of Iran they're not do the American treatment of Iran they're not necessarily happy with the situation that they've been made in whereby the usual diplomatic channels have not been respected so for example when Donald Trump takes to Twitter and tells them OPEC I'm telling you before you meet you have to bring the prices down this has made it a bit sort of a humiliation for OPEC if it decides to go with what Donald Trump has said Donald Trump could have done what US has done in the past send some diplomatic back channels to the various different governments let rumors spread here and there that maybe US is applying pressure but the way the reason way which Trump has done it has evoked a lot of sympathy one for Iran and its loss of its share of the market in terms of loss of its particular exports and also has made OPEC quite jittery it's not a United Block anymore and there's a lot of antagonism between the various different countries particularly as they wrestle with one of the leading OPEC nations Saudi Arabia having to sit in front of them and tell them guys Donald Trump told me to bring the oil prices down we have to do so I think with regards to filling the two million barrels to summarize I think they'll find a way to do so if they have to but I don't think OPEC countries are at the stage yet where bar they want to follow the orders of Donald Trump so it's basically you're saying it's payback time for the Saudi government there now mana share is it if we look at OPEC you have you okay we have big Iran that is not going to produce oil anymore at least it's not going to be traded internationally you have Saudi Arabia that's under pressure but then you have also a lot of problems Venezuela's not able to produce as much anymore Libya it can produce one day years when they know depending of what's happening the same is situation with Nigeria so it's also there's a lot of problems within OPEC itself and when I don't know but from the outside you get a feeling that the there's a lot of fragility within OPEC at the moment because of geopolitical situations well I again say that there is in spite of all the politics that you are mentioning and the media portray within OPEC countries the member countries they sit together and discuss things as in a business way and out of these political issues I come back to the question you asked me before I want to if you allow me two things one is that the agreement in OPEC as a group and now together with non-opec is voluntary so they're all I agreed to do this because it is good for all of them it is no enforcement this is this is one thing and then coming back to the question of what countries can produce assuming that OPEC as a group the side to increased and agree with each other to increase supply the nominal figure which is in the press is 2 million barrels per day spare production capacity of Saudi Arabia there is a smaller extent a smaller quantity apparently available spare capacity in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait but one doesn't know that much and doesn't know so much it is small the main key player in that scenario would be Saudi Arabia which nominally has about 2 million everyone is talking about I want to mention this point that this if it comes to the crunch that Saudi Arabia would like to decide to increase it is not guaranteed that technically this is very capacity can be brought on the stream quickly and on a stream line without any problems to go up 2 million barrels per day of supply from next week or next month into the world market without problem there is great possibility that it may not be actually 2 million barrels per day a spare capacity available to put the key under with it on and off and I'd tell you if you allow me one experience between 1980 in 1979-80 Saudi Arabia did produce almost 10 million barrels per day in those years and for the following 10 years the nominal figured everyone accepted in the press was that Saudi Arabia is oil production capacity was 10 million barrels per day and in 1990 in August when Saddam Hussein forces entered Kuwait the world put an embargo and decided not to buy oil from Kuwait and Iraq so 5 million barrels per day of oil was lost from the world market and Saudi Arabia decided in a crash very interesting program put all the experts engineers to try to increase production within the next six months or so and they did the best they could the best technology the best engineering planning and so on and yet six months later in early 1991 they reached a point five million barrels per day so the nominal capacity which was 10 at the time they were producing but five five-and-a-half they thought our or there will be five million barrels per day coming out of Saudi Arabia to compensate for the loss of oil from Kuwait and Iraq and yet it was eight point five and not ten million barrels per day so I've my view is that the extra sphere capacity of nominally two may not actually be available may be 1.5 or as such and it will take some time to bring them the mothball them and get all these wells which have been closed starting producing all the surface facilities to get together and working it is not a black a search to put on and off this is not a technical issue that we have which we can't just assume it will come but on the policy issue as we have discussed already among the three of us here there is is a question it seems to be that the Saudis would not be observant and obeying what the Americans are saying and most probably they will go along with the rest of the OPEC and not push for a higher production but again I said this decision will be on the third of December when they all meet not now well and McHale briefly because we're reaching the end of the show ten second answer what do you think is going to happen with Iran's oil I mean it has all the surplus right on it well Reza said on several occasions that it is ready to buy Iranian oil and to resell it on the global market but I do not believe it can be practical okay well this is certainly as men who share said the tomorrow's meeting is one step but the big decisions will be take taken in Vienna at the end of the year so I just want to thank my guests for this show and we'll talk again very soon we help routine a man who shot Akeem and Sammy Hamdi thank you very much and thank you too for
