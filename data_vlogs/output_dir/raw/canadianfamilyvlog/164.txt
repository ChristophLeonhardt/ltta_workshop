try and transform this room into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,280
workout room so I need to somehow find

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,770
space to remove this table everything

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,920
under it and put it like in this area or

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,900
something reorganize this little spot a

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">little better so that I can fit my</font>

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,420
it's not the nicest room to work at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,520
but I'm going for that Rocky<font color="#E5E5E5"> Balboa look</font>
