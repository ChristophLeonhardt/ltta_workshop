and the Ministry of Defence Minister of the Russian Federation with the special envoy of the United Nations on Syria mr. de Mistura as part of the irregular context they will continue exchanging their opinions on all aspects of Syrian detail of Congress to take place mass media Sergey Lavrov Staffan de Mistura statements part of mass media invite you to participate the 22nd of December Moscow will see negotiations and to form its Russian formalist of Great Britain on weighted knees piece the framework of these talks as per the working wizard where is Johnson they will be talking about the current state of relations and the future relations ways to normalize them and step up cooperation between states also changing the views on the current agenda regional international agenda the format will be very much traditional Stokes after that press conferences D and I do hope that the UK side will not introduce any will let's say adjustments to that visit now we pass over to remain part of the press conference tradition we call it the main key issues on the international agenda bout Syria first and foremost as you know the decisive role of no space forces help to take is helping to take the last steps on the way to eliminate any traces of terrorism Syria is a sovereign independent state we've dealt a decisive blow and defeat to the Isis terrorist group that is not existent today on the territory of Syria upon the destruction of the supreme leader of Russian forces certain operations regarding the withdrawal of troops are taking place to the place of their firm in this position some forces will be left staying in Syria to support Syrian forces in order to prevent any possible out brace of terrorist activity living normal portunity to them to crawl onto the terraces of other states and then of the regions of the world despite the defeat I other terrorist opposing the threat to the international peace and security in Syria also we see you say he will speak about the whole territory of Syria there is still a high alert for hostages of hostage cases and terrorist acts in Damascus major terrorist act was prevented as a column they had my bill mobile vehicle was neutralized son of Syrian Minister was killed in during the operation many terrorists in Homs and there is no provinces or hide in the desert dog attacked a station point of Syrian forces on the 17th of December terrorists from the news were assaulted and expectedly Syrian forces in Hama but they were stopped in their tracks with the help of Russian aerospace forces government of Syria continued to advance on the positions of terrorists Damascus the forces are now nearly the strategical settlement of material male the control was a number of hills and up ground around solving the terrorist threat Sein authorities continue working on promoting local ceasefires and overall national reconciliation on the East kalamoon we had the regular meeting between Russian military and Syrian forces and members of the minute Municipal Council of j-rod and they talked about renewing the work of state agencies and evacuating the impassive Meza fired fighters and of course if the effective functioning of the distillation zones in eastern gutte is being obstructed by the Nutri terrorists the mediation of Russian military helped Syrian authorities to achieve for the conditions for withdrawing 1.3 thousand new trust with members of the families from Damascus to ellipse but part of them refused this shameful capitulation which undermined the effort will also strengthen the transient humanitarian sphere more and more serious Syrians and IDPs come back to their homes and authorities actually work on restoring over the years of the conflict the social economic infrastructure and try to do everything to recreate restore the peaceful life for the citizens unfortunately not everyone is willing to achieve the settlement of the Syrian crisis we see attempts to undermine what we have achieved and attempts to prevent the political settlement despite reformatting the opposition delegation in Geneva first old let's say ailment of the those opposing acid still have not been cute and we are sorry to note that the special envoy of the Secretary General of the UN mr. de Mistura did not give the proper evaluation to us provocative declarations by a position during the December rounds of inter-syrian hostages which they intended to and failed to and by this complicated the realization of initiative or for putting together the serious nation Syrian national dialogue Congress and Moscow is disappointed with the contact in inter-syrian contacts in Geneva we see it as an attempt to shift the blame to the part which definitely was not to be blamed for the failing of this talks at the same time we prepared to continue working with a special envoy in Geneva style and such and do it in the interest of the political settlement in Syria based on the Security Council of the United Nations resolution 2254 and I reiterate today we expect in detailed dialogue and exchange of opinions on all issues and outcomes and the Russian side will share them during the press conference on December 21st 22nd in a stand there will be an international meeting on Syria and we have great hopes for this event and as part of it we propose analyzing and signing documents and humanitarian demining in Syria and freeing the hostages our detainees and special focus we propose to make on organizing and conducting Syrian National Dialogue Congress which we see as a platform aimed at giving the necessary impulse to the negotiation process under the auspices of the United Nations in Geneva and achieving agreements with Syrians and without any preconditions as stated in the Security Council resolution 2254 another issue connected to Syria and Syrian settlement I just wanted to say a few words on the adoption of the resolution a Security Council extending the transporter humanitarian aid regime as you know on December 19th Security Council adopted the resolution which extends by a year up to January 2019 the transport the humanitarian aid provisions regime to Syria Russian Federation as well as China and believer abstain during the vote we made this decision because the draft document not fully taken to consideration Russian proposals aimed at increasing the transparency of the regime as well as the development of gradual cancellations of it at the moment we refrain from hindering the extension of the regime based on the interests of the Syrians in needs and in the interests of these people precisely the aid is being provided we pay close attention to the way human aid is being transported to Syria and how it has been distributed within the extended mandate and we expect that the Secretary General of the intonations in due time will conduct a considerate thoughtful and targeted review of this regime with a focus on dismantling it because inevitably it's which is inevitable based in the context of the recovery of the Syrian government of the territory and we propose reorienting and themselves to the traditional means of working in Syria and interacting with its authorities based on the principles of providing emergency humanitarian aid and respect for the state sovereignty another country of the region the situation in which is far from normalized and I'm talking about the situation in Yemen the military political and military situation in Yemen is still quite tense according to United Nations between 6 and 16th of December there were airstrikes conducted by Arab coalition which supports President Haji conduct against the Houthi movement answer Allah in San asada codata entice led to deaths of 115 civilians and over 80 persons were wounded on the part of the who seeds carried out in the December 19th a launch of yet another ballistic missile in the in the direction of Ariat and promising to continue such actions the target of which would be the sword Saudi territory this can provoke a further escalation of the conflict and may can make it grow to the region size and Moscow is deeply concerned with the continuous military fights in Yemen and military confrontation in Yemen and we sorry to note that this might extend and grow to the churches of our neighboring states and might hinder the negotiations which we believe are the only way the only reasonable way the only reasonable possibility to settle the differences between the confronting parties and the sooner the member the participants of the conflict understand the that it will be for the people of Yemen and for the region and as a whole and we continue receiving solicitations for our evaluations or comments with regard to the situation in the Middle Eastern settlement as you know the Palestinian territory is still characterized with a tense situation they still see ongoing Pro protests because of the decision made by the President of the United States on recognizing in Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and hesitation in Gaza is very serious and the number for deceased and wounded is increasing by a day the voting in the Security Council of unit nation on 18 December you know the outcomes of those the United States use the veto power there and all of this based according to our evaluations can only deteriorate the situation and we believe that this the unfavorable situation which we see there now it can be deteriorated and can actually all of this can stay in the way of settling the conflict based on the decision made by the international community at the same time we have to avoid additional escalation of conflict on the ground and prevent acts which can affect the life of for civilians and can hinder the hinder the long term peace in the in the region moving on to the issues connected to new anti Russian actions on the part of Washington I am prepared to share my evaluations on that just recently in December 19th for Russian Foreign Ministry commented on various American actions connected to unfounded accusations that Russia is in the bridge of the INF treaty and yet again we have to talk about new anti-russian steps taken by Washington this time in relation to the American so-called Magnitsky law based on which already for five years they're trying to make accusations against us some kind of legal nature and yesterday said several Russian citizens including the head of the Chechen Republic of Russia inclusion in the sanctions list and now the number of our compatriots included in this list amounts to almost 195 persons and over four hundred and two Russian legal persons are in the same situation 402 Russian legal persons are in this situation all of this is grotesque because it is not based on any real situation unfortunately once again we have to reiterate our stance which comes to the fact that these steps will be reciprocated by our steps this is what we have always been doing and when we have always underscored that this is not the choice we made we am forests strategic interactions where the United States of America we are prepared for it and we believe that it's the way to go but it is sad to see that certain groups political groups and a political establishment groups still obviously have this desire to destroy our bilateral relations officially declare in Russia the opposition the threat for national security we have the Russian side has already commented on this - and they continue all of their those sanction games all of this looks ridiculous in the context of the common threats and challenges that our two countries and the world general are facing and these groups blow before this specific approach of developing some negative scenario in our bilateral relations it seems like it's already at the time to understand that it's dangerous for international stability and will have no positive results for the American people and now coming back to the topic which I have already mentioned in passing and comments on it every time we should do it again I would like to respond to you accusations of the Washington against Russian sides on supposed violations of INF treaty we note that the United States continue exploiting this topic we are talking about stovepiping comments declarations statements that Russia supposedly violates the INF treaty at the moment they have moved on to a QC accusing Russia of it following that the cruise me style 9m seven to nine which is being supplied to the forces does not correspond to the provisions of the treaty at the same time the united states mentioned no proof no evidence and we believe that the only reason for that is that they have no proof no evidence whatsoever and the me style they mentioned and I'm talking about the cruise missile ground-based cruise missile nine m79 fully corresponds to the requirements of the treaty it has not been developed or tested on the range prohibits by INF treaty and its deployment is carried out in full accordance with our international obligations and we call upon the United States to stop exploiting speculating on the topic of the Russian so-called breaches violations and constructively participates in the dialogue on settling the non Russia's concerns regarding the compliance with the treaty by the Americans in themselves I remind you that we are talking about the facts of developing technologies for misses of it's me tree and shorter-range used by Pentagon in anti-missile settlements and use of UAVs as well and as well as the use of it just assured systems and launch systems which are capable of launching such missiles at the same time the announced Washington plan of the program which is aimed at developing the missile missile units prohibited by INF is the way to break the treaty and we retreat our commitment to the treaty and we hope the United States reviews its counterproductive flying affection and comes back to do politicizing the dialogue making it professional with regard to do the existing issues I reiterate that this is our stance and we try to communicate it to our American colleagues by various means public and through talks yet another topic which opens a whole block of issues Greymon of they are connected to Ukraine that they have a direct link with the United States particularly we are disappointed by the information that Washington issued license to their producer whose unnamed this company could supply large caliber sniper rifles Barrett m107 a1 for the first time Washington officially announced supplies of weapons to Ukraine but quite recently we have found it out that the American company air electronic us a supply since April hand grenades the fact that the weapons are supplied not through state contracts but through commercial contracts does not change anything this is just camouflage that's another attempt to change the the effect how the idea would be viewed and the fact that Washington gave the go-ahead for such supplies will have tragic consequences I'm talking about those people Ukrainian people who might be killed from as a result of the use of the American weapons the position of the keifa sergey's is well known for us I think it's evident for us as well as for a number of experts arming kiev authorities the United States provoked further escalation and bloodshed and done best where the station is tense because of the fights going on there and the fact of Washington is become is becoming a participant in killing of people who rebel against the mill the coup d'etat in Kiev who have the right to uphold their right stop hold their interest to speak the Russian language this have the right to uphold their interests and values I think of course that the history will make order but we would like to see it not in several years we would like to see that all the participants will understand the consequences and it will help to prevent rent losses and another topic that we have commented many times we have published information on the official website but we received many questions on that issue particularly I'm talking about the withdrawal of Russian officers from the joint center on control and coordination of issues related to the ceasefire regime and distribution of the situation in Ukraine we have made our statement on that issue it was published on the official website but bearing in mind a number of all the questions and comments that were made by Kiev and other Western partners we would like to address this issue once again as it was mentioned earlier on the 18th of December Russian soldiers from the Joint Center on control and coordination of issues related to the ceasefire regime and coordination of situations in Ukraine left the Ukrainian territory this was a step that the Russian side had to do we have already told you about all the reasons of that action I would like to tell you that the actions taken by officers as part of their GC CC has become impossible because of the Kiev position who prefers to use force to addressed on this issue and doesn't want to implement Minsk agreements in such in this environment this the work of the center is impossible in this center is quite impossible in its record recognized by many international partners and at the same time the president of Ukraine poroshenko signed the decree to strengthen since the first of January twenty-eighth in the control of entry and exit of all their foreign nationals and their residents in Ukraine they procedure of the implementation of this law particularly excessive demand of personal data and their metric data particular fingerprints are inappropriate for the Russian Defense Ministry because it goes against the requirements of the Russian legislation on the status of servicemen today despite all the comments clear comment explaining the action taken by Russia we see the attempts of Ukraine to distort the essence of the situation they try to blame Russia on everything they try to use the effect or withdrawal of Russian troops for us everything is evident we understand what Gulf they are pursuing by doing so because they want to provide information about a station in Ukraine they want to present information about aggressor they want to provide excuse for their actions for everything they do there that's why they are taking this section we call the Kiev authorities not to lay the blame on somebody else please take unconditional full and consistent implementation of Minsk agreement and we hope that all the international partners particularly Normandy format and the United States will not stand aside and will use all the leverage to encourage Kiev to do the same mostly sports a new Crimea which after the station in Ukraine we would like to turn to the station in Honduras we closely follow the developments in complicated political situation in Honduras it has resulted from the general elections that were organized on the 26th of December the Supreme Electoral Tribunal declared that the incumbent Honduras president Juan Orlando Hernandez had won the elections by one point 53% of words I would like to say that Honduras is our important partner in sin to America we develop political dialogue and we have established with a free regime for Russian and Honduran travelers we signed an interstate agreement on our relations where there's great importance to cooperation with Honduras then the framework of the Russian dialogue with a Central American integration system and another topic I would like to mention we have commented many times but we need to talk about it again I'm talking about the fact that the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution called combating glorification of Nazis known as another practices that contribute to fueling contemporary forms of racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance it was adopted on the 18th of December by the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly earlier the text was approved by the 3rd Committee of the UN GA this year the this resolution was co-sponsored by 57 States a great majority of states 133 to be exact voted for the draft resolution as in previous years the United States and Ukraine voted against and 98 49 states including EU Member States abstained from the world and we see that this resolution raises issues about the states which glorify the Nazi movement and former members of FN SS the organization that was recognized criminal by the Nuremberg trials and these countries glorify those who collaborated with Nazis as national heroes so the text was published on the 20th of December and you can read it and enough this is the topic that is actively discussed these weeks and this months it's actively discussed by Polish media we're talking about the air crash that happened on the 10th of April 2010 it's a regret that the Polish authorities prevent a conspiracy theories about this tragic event which resulted in the death of leg coach in ski his spouse and members of the representative delegation this tragic event has become a result of tragic combination of factors and it's presented as a result of planned action of previous bully for Polish authorities who colluded with Russia we don't think that we need to comment this statement because we have provided all the necessary information to the Polish authorities this information is accessible to the journalists we have organized many joint events particularly briefings interviews press conferences where we provided all the comprehensive comments on all the questions so I don't think that it's necessary to give detailed comments to this fake news we don't think that it's necessary to react to all the speculations that Russia hides important people who can provide all the details about the catastrophe so this is a material that's presented in the media it's evidence that such claims are unfounded I would like to see that interstate aeration committee and polish Commission have organized investigation each one our organizer of their investigation their outcomes and their conclusions are critical is the same so there is no cream criminal intent in this event law-enforcement agencies of Russia and Poland continue their assistance they provide legal sit-ins to share the information we received from the fact that we need to respect all the victims of their question we urge what so not to explore the tragedy in political goals and I would like to draw outcomes I have already done this but I would like to tell you about it again I went to tell it to those who don't know about it I'm talking about the EF cultural tourism organised between Russia and France on the 7th and 8th of December the Russian Orthodox spiritual and cultural center in Paris has seen the closing ceremony of the year of cultural tourism between Russia and France 2016 2017 in France and ferries and many other cities many events were organized particularly I'm talking about the 300th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Russia and France international theater the Great Congress Europe roots of Peter the Great and forum Russian France cultural roots this villa truly has strengthened relations between Russia and France cultural establishments and it facilitated the emergence of new tourist destinations and it provided impetus to into regional cooperation an important event was the opening of the exhibition and Versailles Peter the Great's are in France 1717 it was opened on the 29th of May to mark the visit of a President Putin and his meeting with the French president McCrone they see a demonstrated that but despite all the differences in all the difficult situation and the relations Russia and France are ready to cooperate with each other that's part of the good news as for the lateral agenda I should talk about the issues we have on the 18th of December employees of the president executive officers refused the journalists of free and always see Victoria Ivanova who has the necessary education to visit the protocol event as a journalist it was organized in the Elysee Palace I would like to explain the nature of this event the Russian journalists couldn't complete its task particularly to write an article about the Russian ambassador in France Alexei Meshkov who was going to present the credentials so this is the event that was linked to Russia so this is not the first time when the Russian journalists faced obstacles that were created by the French side sometimes they we see that we see the hostile attitude towards Russia when Russia Today TV channels received license to show its channel in France a group of civil activists addressed the High Council on audio-visual devices Olivia schmuck well they they asked him to revoke the license before that we've seen nothing use to read to not let our teach TV channel and Sputnik to spread their information we clearly know the source of the signal it was sent by the government particularly by the president of France all the explanations that are given on that matter particularly through diplomatic channels go to the one thing they the result in one phrase given by M&L macron when he was talking about the Russia Today TV channel and Sputnik and he when he was talking about journalists working in this media once again I would like to say about the opposition of the head of the executive branch about journalists who legally work in France doesn't it shouldn't it be viewed as an example when the state intervenes in the work of the media and the second matter that I need to say is their letters written by social activists with a demand to close this media it seems like these letters were written by an order the style of this letter the essence of this letter they all go around the quote given by the French president you know and also the OSC if french delegation said that the presence of accredited accreditation of foreign journalists does not mean that this journalist will receive access to official events they need person they need personal invitation so this is the event that was attended by the Russian ambassador so the Russian ambassador who attended the official ceremony and didn't have an opportunity to share his assessments or comments with the Russian media also they communicate that was talking about the communique given by the French delegation in OSCE this invitation shouldn't be issued by it shouldn't be given to Russian media particularly Russia today TV channel and Sputnik and once again they quote the French president Emmanuel macron who said that this mass media don't I shouldn't be viewed as mass-media they should be viewed as means of propaganda foreign propaganda and couldn't please explain me how they made this conclusion we've answered that we asked this question many times and we discussed the situation with mr. dis desire and here we asked him if there is a mechanism well not in the world but in the OSCE in the european space that could provide an expert opinion if mass media shouldn't be it shouldn't be viewed as a mass media or should it be view as the source of propaganda and he said that there is no such mechanism there is no such criteria so once again my question is what's the how did they make this conclusion so we see that they that the French Republic doesn't want to comply with their obligations to uphold the freedom of mass media it doesn't mean if this decision was unilaterally taken by the French Republic or it was decision as part of in framework of the European Union such action shouldn't be left without our reaction I would like to answer one question to my French colleagues if we show this attitude to French journalists what's the reaction of Paris would be and of the international community well we hope to receive answer to that question we hope that all the politically motivated restrictions imposed against mass media and we qualify action taken by French authorities like this so we think that such action should be reviewed by the International Institutes we call the OSCE the president of the Special Committee on mass media they OSCE to a common this situation and I really hope that he as a citizen of the French Republic will will comply with all his obligations he has an s and now the topic related to the mass media freedom you mentioned the campaign to tighten the controls on social networks that is aimed for financial elites and these Committee on the ethics ethics standards in the society which issued a report condemning such administrators like company administrators of Google Facebook and Twitter for the not enabling us to protect the users and as an argument for the OVW changes the side the fact that the internet is used to by extremist terrorists and other mentally handicapped people are for affecting and negatively the users including by the means of distributing a disseminated fake news other world is actually changing and recently their representatives of these states that the United States Great Britain and other Western democracies they have approved the total Internet freedom of national and of social networks underlying their transparency their accessibility everything suited them and when we met during the negotiations and we talked about that the same materials of these net and social networking that works disseminated by extremist terrorism and other mental handicapped people were cited as a testimony as of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other humanitarian clean raids conducted by Russia and Syria are the same materials when we talked about the fact that we were provided some extremist kind of information we were told that it is freedom of media freedom of speech we didn't forget the fact that they were great deal of fake news during the winter olympic games of in Sochi and they were fake news relating to Russia's invasion alleged Russia's invasion in Ukraine Victoria Nuland mr. Kerry they said that all the evidence could be found in the social networks and everything regarding the situation in Syria like we have this story of girl wanna of boy Imran and we saw all these pictures in social networks and this was presented as actual evidence and when we faced the situation we didn't bring about accusations against Twitter Google or other networks we had a great deal of questions and in the first place regarding Facebook we raised those questions but we didn't demand such such a things we think that it is against the freedom of the media in the internet and we should think with our partners on how can we really protect this area and the users are for these space protect them against the threats of terrorists by then we were marked but now we see that this is a new initiative to change the legislation and in Great Britain particular now we do not say that anything news any context relating to terrorism that it should be fought against but this should be done for the sake of freedom of speech and for the users themselves and the first thing that we should determine the double standards and we should get rid of them because everything we see is an information apocalypses when we met delegations in some capitals of the world these materials that Great Britain proposes to fight it was presented as an evidence without substantiating Edgeworth and effects and at the time proposals to work out common approach to protect the users from all the fake news disseminated by extremists were not just only denied but we were blamed for propaganda we were accused of propaganda now we have different situation but now he's not a chance to really protect the users from the least harmful effect but just to control some segments of the internet this was partly replied to the question partly a separate topic and it was a question posed by commerce and these question was relating to the Georgian signing of the contract with a Swiss manager in comic company as gs working on the territory of Georgia and we deem it that it's a very positive step that is meant for a full-scale implementation of agreements between Russia and Georgia of 9th of November 2011 on the customs administrate administration and monitoring our booths and we were ready to sign our part of the documents and the bilateral contacts which took place on the 19th of December and burn we we discussed that topic and the Russian society is interested in practical implementation of the agreement of 2011 and we are in favor of the procedure of the release of the goods through the customs border with children that we think are with open and you are 20th ruse but the regional trade is so much needs I'm ready to answer your questions yes please good afternoon yippie ganga aarti to the channel and the parish johnson will be with us tomorrow he will fly to Russia today and we can recall the comparison with Sparta and we can see we called the revival of the Russian intervention again regarding the brac sake and you heard the comments presented by Boris Johnson how did you react in that case my question is about the attitude of the foreign ministry whether you look at like some topic that you can close your eyes to you can dim it as official stance of the of Great Britain I think that whether are those statements of re Johnson are official this question should be answered by Great Britain by London and by all the official authorities and we dim it like statements made by Boris Johnson and we cannot be offended by the about those statements as pleased principal Tina recently you made the concert on Honduras and how do you think weather organization of the America of American states is different from the regarding the situation in Venezuela and the thing that happens in Honduras so you're speaking about the UN reaction the response to the situation yes we think speak about the criticism regarding the Venezuela situations and this omission regarding these Honduras situations I can say like commenting the foreign ministry stance and we try to convey this position promptly and we deem that while assessing the situation in this or that region of the world our colleagues and our partners from different regions and countries and of course the end representatives should not occur too double standards and they should use objective criteria for assessing the situation in different countries and that is our stance yes please good day maria vladimirovna i would like to return to Boris Johnson I would not like to just one question taken into account his statements many statements against Russia should we hold a dialogue with him why do you regard them on to Russian regarding as part of the Athens I think that they are not directed against Russia but rather the British educational system and I think that the blow was delivered against the image of the British educational system Russia was not affected by his statement it was just a joke for us let us ask another question I like raising a question and before the visit there were comments made by tourism a said that Russia is a hostile a state that conducts or subversive activities and this stance of Great Britain is formulated in a very distinct way and what is the attitude of foreign ministry and what do you expect to see from this visit and we've commanded the statement of Theresa May and we it is our comment is available on the website do not hold our position in any secret and it is quite transparent and once again I boosted although I had posted the briefing that we had before and we say about speak about the improvement of bilateral ties and we can speak about the original agenda and all the questions of mutual concern and we can do it on equal basis and contract in different areas and we have regularly stated that and I don't think that we should speak about that before some remarkable visits we were speaking about that regularly and we told you that the wrapping of the dialogue by our bilateral dialogue was a choice of London it was not a prom choice because wrapping up our counterterrorism activity is of it's not useful at all and the terrorist acts happening in all regions of our planet and those powers that are permanent representatives in the u.s. security UN Security Council they of course should talk about those topics and we should speak about the mutual benefit and the mutual benefit is the prevention of terrorist acts and we wrapped up all the activities on that track at the initiative of Great Britain let alone contacts on different data levels and our position is very clear it is coherent and we do not hold it in an e-cigarette yes please good afternoon caution Mohammed Collison 224 are to be channel there were about collisions between that and what is the role of the Russian Federation to settle the conflict between our bill and backed up and whether Russia is willing to help Erbil and Baghdad for the peace to achieve the peace settlement of the problem as we answered regularly on the topic and why does any comment comments and we believe that those problems that can lead to open conflict should be resolved in a peaceful way and a basis of internal dialogue in Iraq and we urged Baghdad to proceed in such a way and we believe that such dialogue should be conducted and it's for sure yes please good afternoon the Turkish TV channel haaaah some days ago we marked the deplorable day of the demise of Russian ambassador Karloff and the investigation of this crime shows that it was committed by the terrorist organization thought and Russian delegations that visited Ankara they mentioned these facts also and at the same time the terrorists are still at large in Russia and the feeling quite comfortable what measures are planning to take in that regard yes the cause of the investigation should be documented by the competent authorities and the investigation is underway we cannot be very a transparent in this regard due to reasons you understand and I would like to draw your attention to the fact I've read material on some new news agency website and it was regarding this tragic date and after right after the death demise about the Russian ambassador Russian side advantage as a terrorist attack so in such a way these information was presented as Dow as doubting whether it was a terrorist act and like sometimes how transforming they've been enough the Russian side but we can say that that our opinion remains unchanged of course it is a terrorist attack and I'll try to inform you in more detail if I am able to if I have all the pertinent information provided by experts in the investigation and I'll try to clarify if we can provide some more details to you and then to answer your question yes please see Afghan News Agency some time ago the Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov proposed renewing the international interaction in the format's 6+1 in order to stabilize the situation around Afghanistan good please comment have you received any reaction of the Washington to this proposal thank you I will double-check I don't have this information at the moment but after the briefing I will double-check if there's been any reaction on the part of the United States and we reiterate once again that we are prepared to cooperate with our American colleagues on this issue and this intention is still exist to see and I will double-check as far as the reaction is concerned but you know I think it would be logical to ask the American side maybe American Embassy in Moscow or maybe contact them through the Department of State and we would be happy to hear their public statement on this issue because we are prepared as you know use all of the means available to discuss the issue of Afghanistan in international formats and through bilateral channels and as far as American position is concerned I will double-check the recent offensive what so far information portal vesti russia has converted terrorist threat in Syria how do you evaluate the role turkey played in this process and do you plan any joint steps joint steps with Syria to establish peace in the region and my second question the new year is coming and your birthday is coming up too what events made you have the happiest throughout this year thank you well the first question the aspect of participation of certain countries in any highlighting the year combatants you should probably contact our experts on that but their role in the political process is concerned we have been actively cooperating with our Turkish contacts on this issue they astern a platform and in this respect we are conducting work and we have we don't coincide on all aspects sometimes we have our differences but we sold them and this difference is asked possible to solve but we reiterate that the rotor cue played in this in facilitating the political settlement in Syria in the region is to be noted and as far as the most notable event of this year is concerned can you give me a minute to think about that just second horrible and foolishness with channel RTS as always great part of your briefing is devoted to the relations with the West bilateral issues situation with the United States Ukraine and so on and I would like to ask a more general question what is your take on the contemporary confrontation between Russia and the West who's to blame is it always the West to blame and do you have any sort of self-criticism in Russia and that's not all of the problems arise from the actions of others well you know the greater part of my written was devoted to Syria and the Middle Eastern region and northern Africa if we look at it objectively I think this was the major part I think we should recognize that that's the one thing and the second thing is it's interesting how you phrase the question is everything that the West says about Russia does not correspond to the reality or do we have any a self-criticism why do you ask the questions in this way what does self-criticism on the part of Russia or the part of West has to do with it why do I have to look at the issue from this perspective when have we not be self-critical I think there is no more self-critical nation than us I think if you have a people that is prepared to criticize themselves from day till night it's Russia actually when we deal with foreign journalists and I'll talk about Asia Caucasus and the Middle East and they tell me that they ask me why do you allow to criticize yourself in that way and why do you criticize yourself so much more than anyone ever does you can look at talk shows statements that are being made all the time we dig into ourselves and we always dig into our own history and now present and always have this critical outlook on ourselves I don't think there is any I don't know any other country which would constantly criticize itself more than anyone else would and as far as our responses to criticism are concerned for example criticism on a part of our Western colleagues it's not that we don't have the opportunity don't recognize the problems that we have that's not the issue the thing is that with job that we say that we will deal with our problems themselves ourselves thank you that you draw our attention to those issues but first of all we have that you have your own issues which you ignore while criticizing our problems but the second thing is that we can deal with our issues ourselves and it is true that we're quite often more capable to solve our own issues without any help from the outside than with them intervening in those issues and as far as the confrontation you've mentioned is concerned I don't think it's confrontation but rather the attempts on one part to counter this huge information campaign those attempts to isolate and actually open attempts to isolate and deter which no one is trying to hide either and on the other side on the other hand attempt to call upon our colleagues to cooperate and to be honest it's quite a difficult objective to achieve standing up to those attempts to realize this isolationist approach and at the same time even hold out this helping hand that's another thing to mention can you find any other state in the country which would be so ready to call for cooperation and point out that we actually have a great number of common issues to solve at this at the same time trying to duck those attempts to hurt us to sting us and the part the major part to which my briefing was devoted to I and I'm talking about Syria is obvious why it was devoted to this issue that's just one example why we encountered why we had tried to stand up to those factual attempts to destabilize the situation in the region on the part of our Western colleagues as providing the competence with armaments and providing them with financial technical informational approach in the same support and it's the same time calling for cooperation can you can you remember that we suffered this huge criticism after we began the airspace operations what preceded this the statement on the General Assembly made by the Russian president who proposed fighting the region's terrorists by joining our ranks and this was backed by our commitment to our preparedness to practical steps to establish legal base for this and this proposals stayed unanswered and just only after that when we went through all of the technicalities all the formalities and a follow through with all of them possible proposals after not receiving any positive reaction to our proposals only after all of this we began the aerospace operation because it was just necessary to solve the operation to save the operation to settle situation and prevent this terrorist movement from flowing outside of the region and just coming to us that's just one specific example and we have numerous examples like that maybe you should remember other cases just look through the materials from the Munich conference on security and you should look who dealt with confrontations they dealt with confrontations before the 2014 during 2014 and after it throughout all of this time before 2014 during it and after it Russia has been calling for joint action and it has been the case all of the time and why is that because well that answer satisfy you and once again this is not the question you should ask us it's the question regarding the motivation of our Western partners they opened a for example for several years the entire world left I heard about this innovative approach on the part of the United States towards the external policy they promoted their exclusivity at the same time there was different kind of motivation maybe this possible attempt to really conducted policy of deterring Russia containing its development grades which nobody expected and which didn't fit into their plans this is a very long uncomplicated talk but it's not a question you should ask us it's not our actions that called for questioning and as far as criticism is concerned you can look through our newspapers you can watch our TV channels took out politician pollito lodgest there is there are tons of self-criticism concerning both internal and external policy yes please cushion-cut today's poland this will be a question which has nothing to do with Smolensk more about internal policy of a year as you know yesterday your Commission began activated the seventh article against Poland and at the end there was a set of sanctions what do you like it that's actually the question I want to ask you well I want to ask you that question what is your opinion I hear voices in Moscow saying that this can influence the relations between Poland and well I think this more concerns the relationship between process and war so we are just neighbors we don't intervene in the family affairs I know that this does not concern Russia directly but I hear voices fact maybe you could comment on this I think these are the relations between Wars oh and Brussels I don't think there is any reason to comment this I think in your new family you have to solve the issues and problems you have yourselves and we hope that you will solve them and that you will overcome those different abilities the important thing is that you don't have double standards that's our permanent stance so you think that bolin can follow the path which hungary has followed for example and what path has Congress followed please show your cards tell tell us about it their relation well relations with Russia different so you think that this turbulence on certain issues between Moscow and Brussels can lead to some greater closeness between the Russian horse oh no that's not the game we play I reiterate that internal family affairs should be soft within the huge family and as far as Russia's relations with Hungary are concerned for example they are not based on some contradictions between the various countries just like our relations with who also in other countries of the EU we develop our relations understanding that your Poland or other country is part of the EU but we also establish our relationships based on the bilateral approach just like the policy of sanctions sanctions pressure against Russia and the attempts of various EU countries to join and not just attempts to join or some kind of support those isolationist trends which stand from the United States is not something that's accepted by all countries of the EU it's not a question that just one country sees this new policy strange or hurtful or at least not bringing any benefits to the EU in general and its independent members that's what we hear from various European politicians and those who are leadership and those who are just part of the political establishment they all say that the numbers and the economic growth rates and just internal statistics demonstrate that sanctions policy has not yielded any benefits for the EU and it actually is damaging its relations with Moscow and but it actually damages the countries of the European Union themselves and I don't think you have to try to find it in differences long term or short term that you can't just have with the Brussels try to find in those differences some benefits for Moscow nobody's going to do that definitely we are open to cooperate both on the line of contexts between Moscow and the EU and between Moscow and given States we are ready to deal with all the issues which we had before the sanctions were introduced we're talking about the benefits which the EU is missing and the benefits which we are missing we're saying that we have achieved a very high level of cooperation with process and determined European states in economic and others and commercial levels and we had prospects very good prospects for increasing them and unfortunately since they followed the influence coming from the US the EU actually hurt itself and it's obvious that they didn't actually win from this but actually lost quite a bit we are open and sincere in this respect we're not using this differences these contradictions that exist we openly stated we are ready to cooperate to interact we don't have to wait for someone to have difficulties with someone we have been saying this for quite a long time in our negotiations with Poland with madam a greenie we say that we are ready to cooperate on a wide range of issues and so waiting for trouble sometimes to come in it's just pointless moreover corporations despite sanctions with a range of where two countries demonstrates that even despite our differences on various issues we still can find some mutual benefits in interacting I interact I reiterate we don't wait for someone to have issues and just feel happy about it we are clearly and openly state our interests and welcome everyone to cooperate and interact yes please Russia next year Kuwait will be part of the Security Council part of the 15 states in the Security Council of United Nations what are your expectations your plans for cooperation cooperation between Russian and Kuwait on in terms of middle eastern and northern Africa and poor with all the who are the members so the UN Security Council are elected there on a non permanent basis Russian delegation and Russia they will maintain dialogue with them and we discussed with them all the matters of the agenda its normal process as for the dialogue with between Russia and Kuwait I'm going to provide you detailed information next time let's do it like this Greece are you having a go going to organize performance for us or installation well I hope it will be like this the 2018 we will mark the liberation of Bulgaria from the Turkish invasion and we on behalf of Bulgaria we invite President Putin to visit our country would like to draw your attention to the memorial of heroes of clavinet this Memorial requires all the reconstruction well as for the first question I will find the date sets for second one I need to think about it yes please miss dahara quite recently the US has published the new version of its strategy of national security Russia is viewed there as the main advisory what's the position of the Russian Federation and this can can I please answer your first question well you think that our position is quite mild well our position was direct just to read the commentary made by the ribcor for Deputy Foreign Minister it's published on the official website I has commented today and our position is direct I just wanted to repeat that we see that the parties are tired of this this similar grotesque action that are taken by Washington these actions a little bit by certain groups so I think even in our statements there this our statements reflect our burden of those approaches because this action taken by people these people think that their action will they will impede our relations so we start to comment this statement this action there is no sense to you know to express that Russia is advisory that Russia influence the presidential action Russian hackers Russian hackers you know that it's used so much time so many times that no one is surprised by the statements because everyone understand that there is a number of arguments that could be used over and over again they have no sense before they wanted to frighten us but now they see that they can do this they see that people who are in their sanction list they are not saddened by this facts we see that there is pressure from this policy and we're bored from it and we understand that this doesn't benefit us and in our turn we offer our cooperation and partnership but our position remains clear and direct this concept should be examined and we will provide comment on it because it's a huge document comprehensive document it has many sectors and we our experts are working in it and I can say that we provide more detailed assessments on this matter and you have another question speak to the microphone please push the button since 2014 the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem has more than hundred schools and many other sites properties is Russia going to defend them Russia is doing it on the on a regular basis if you want to know the status of property and this site's controlled by the Russian Orthodox Church then I can forgive you the next briefing it's an interesting topic and I will give you a detailed information on this issue do you have any more questions now yes I understand your task the most important event or the expiring year look at his procedure do you want to ask me if we celebrated it yes we celebrated it thank you very much bye
