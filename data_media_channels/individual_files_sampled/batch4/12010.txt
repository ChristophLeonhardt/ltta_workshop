some people have said that awarding Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize for Literature represents the baby-boomers final triumph over a once magnificent Western culture that so dwarfed their own artistic achievements that they had to destroy it in order to feel any respect for themselves some say giving a major Literature Prize to a folk song writer was the baby-boomers way of saying yes the geniuses of ages past created the plays of Shakespeare the poems of Keats and the novels of Dickens and Tolstoy but we listen to simplistic protest songs sung by a guy with a harmonica and a voice like an alarm clock buzzer and so we're going to celebrate ourselves because by golly that's how much we suck but the Nobel Prize Committee says Dylan is a great poet and that means we should now study Dylan's words as we've studied the words of the great poets of the past for instance John Milton was a great poet of the past and here he is describing how classical cultures created distorted myths about the fall of Lucifer from heaven how he fell from heaven they fabled thrown by angry Jove shear or the crystal battlements from morn to noon he fell from noon to do Eve a summers day and with the Setting Sun dropped from the zenith like a falling star on Lemnos the aegean isle note the subtle blending of classical and christian allusions which suggests that the mythology of the ancients gracefully foretold the form into which christ would live out his world altering truth thus the verse expresses an entire underlying philosophy of religions relationship to culture likewise with Bob Dylan we find the verse it ain't me babe no no no it ain't me babe it ain't me you're lookin for babe note the repeated use of the word babe suggesting that the person the songwriter is addressing is a babe or an attractive woman or possibly just an annoying woman whose ami can't remember in any case it's clear the person the babe is looking for is not him otherwise he wouldn't keep saying over and over and over again it ain't me babe likewise when Dylan writes lay lady lay lay across my big brass bed stay lady stay stay with your man a while many readers have come to believe that the lady is probably also a babe because the word lady keeps repeating as did the word babe and if she weren't a babe why would he want her in his bed which interestingly is made of brass suggesting that it's a brass bed with a lady in it who's a babe thus when we look at the literature of the past we see a towering monument to the imagination of man while when we look at the literature of the baby boomers we see that towering monument lying broken in the cultural desert and in the immortal words of the poet Shelley round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away babe trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show you missed you missed the singing the Canada chorusing that was that was brutal to Bob Dylan who has had the

hysterical because Donald Trump is destroying they think Donald Trump is going to destroy the GOP by his claims that this election is rigged in various ways now the left has says he's going to destroy the entire democracy he's thinking the whole Republic down with him it's like just long you know here's our President Barack Obama soon-to-be former President Barack Obama Zain why Trump Trump's key well let's play Trump for us here's what Trump is saying he's saying the election is rigged Erie is talking to who is he talking to he's talking to Mike Gallagher my old pal here he's talking about the Reid election when I talk about the election being rigged it was just reported they're almost 2 million dead people right and a registered to vote right right and Inbal ryan gets up and issues a memo that he disagrees that the elections rigged why does he walk over to Philadelphia and st. Louis and Chicago these cities and and how how could he say the election is look nothing's perfect but this process is unbelievable and it's certainly rigged with the press so why would he issue a memo that the election said is he naive because that's naivete or maybe something worse than lack of street smarts as you said last night and what's gonna let it is but you know when you go to Philadelphia where Romney gets zero votes well McCain got zero votes but so they're very disappointed so first of all that's Donald Trump taking his precious time to attack his own party but on top of that let's just let's just be clear on the one hand there are millions of dead people on the rolls that doesn't mean they're voting on the other hand the Democrats go out of their way to make sure the rolls don't get cleaned up and that people don't have to use ID so there's perfectly perfectly good reason to be suspicious of it on that side here is Obama saying our very democracy is under threat for buddies charges one of the great things about America's democracy is we have a vigorous sometimes bitter political contest and when it's done historically regardless of party the person who loses the election congratulate the winner reaffirms our democracy and we move forward that's how democracy survives because we recognize that there's something more important than any individual campaign and that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself because democracy by definition works by consent not by force I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place it's unprecedented and then he goes on with that graciousness and loftiness that we've come to expect from this president to attack Trump personally this is the guy standing on the outside the White House right acting as our president so this he's not campaigning now going into campaign mode and calling Trump a whiner here he goes every expert regardless of political party regardless of ideology conservative or liberal who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found that keep in mind elections are run by state and local officials which means that there are places like Florida for example where you've got a Republican governor who's a Republican appointees are going to be running and monitoring a whole bunch of these election sites the notion that somehow if mr. Trump loses Florida it's because of those people that you have to watch out for that is both irresponsible and by the way doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you'd want out of a president he started whining before the game is even over if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else then you don't have what it takes to be in this job all right so let's take this apart for a minute because Obama you know it is funny when you go back and listen to Obama sometimes there's always like this kind of truth interwoven into the baloney and it's true Trump lines it is also true that Democrats commit voter fraud in a much much much higher rate of Rudy Giuliani was talking about this he said maybe it's because they control the inner cities but as Rudy had the great he had the great line dead people tend to vote Democrat that's that was his lies a great line and it would it would also help it would also help if this particular president had not undermined our institutions to the degree that he had I mean if if he hadn't taken the IRS and used it to suppress Republican organizations if he hadn't corrupted let's remember the just right after the the first election Attorney General Eric Holder refused to prosecute Black Panthers who were standing who had cried out how deeply they hated white people and were standing outside election stations in Philadelphia holding batons looking very threatening and Holder refused to prosecute and when somebody said this is this is terrible he said well you can't compare it to what happened to black people here's holder refusing telling Congress he's not gonna prosecute compare what people endured in the South in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia producing appropriate things and there's certainly that but to call that to put it described in those those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line who risk all for for my people for my people see that's the Attorney General of the United States I am his people I am his people so even he's talking about he's talking about people with the same color skin he's got he's the Attorney General this is Obama has done this straight through all our most cherished organizations government organizations he has eaten out the credibility of these organizations they are now the rotted Hulk and the FBI is on top of the reason the FBI the FBI is releasing all this stuff all of a sudden about their investigation into Hillary Clinton and I believe that James Comey is doing this for the same reason that he stood up and gave that original press conference where he basically dammed her basically said she had committed crimes but we shouldn't prosecute and I think that Comey is caught in a vise I think he was told that he basically couldn't prosecute and and so he didn't but he wanted to get out all the information that he could get out and so he did but you know now we have this whole thing that has been put out of Patrick Kennedy the Undersecretary of State negotiating with the FBI to keep them from classifying documents so that Hillary Clinton wouldn't look bad again again Patrick Kennedy works for you he works for me he has used the betweenness on your time on your money he is negotiating to protect Hillary Clinton's election chances and her reputation okay and now Project Veritas let's get back to Project Veritas James O'Keefe has released the second in his big investigation and you know yesterday I said that I felt that James O'Keefe gets a kind of a bad rap and here's what I mean by that James O'Keefe is a guerrilla journalist and by the way he describes himself as a radical progressive so he's not think he's one of us I mean I've sat and chatted with him and you know I don't I don't know what his politics are but that's how he describes himself and so O'Keefe gets this bad rap and they they just throw it off in a couple of lines all the time they say well he's been convicted of phone tampering and he had to pay $100,000 to somebody at a corner and all that stuff but you know when you're looking into it a little deeper it's really it's really a little bit it's much much much more gray the hundred thousand dollars he paid was to an eight-core guy he went in and did that scam on a corne where he tried to get them essentially to bring in sex slaves the sex trafficking and a lot of agreed to it okay one person who agreed to it the minute he walked out called the police so in other words he was milking him for information and then he called the authorities and said this guy was just in trying to do this stuff and he felt he got burned he lost his job after the video came out and he felt he got burned and he sued and O'Keefe paid him a hundred thousand dollars to get him to go away we will continue this and have the mailbag and our discussion about porn but first I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube and we will see you over at the Daily wire
