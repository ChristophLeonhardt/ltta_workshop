MOST ADMIRED DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BUT GROW OLD AND IRRELEVANT? NEXT THING YOU KNOW THEY WILL BE ASKING YOU NASTY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR IMPEACHMENT. BEST-SELLING AUTHOR MARK STEYN HAS NEVER BEEN IMPEACHED AND AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS FRANKLY UNLIKELY THAT HE WILL BE BUT HE JOINS US ANYWAY TONIGHT. GREAT TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU TUCKER. Tucker: SO ALL OF A SUDDEN BILL CLINTON FOR MANY YEARS PROTECTED BY THE PRESS IS UP FOR GRABS. WHAT IS THIS? I THINK THERE'S A SENSE, AS YOU SAID THAT HE IS NOW DISPOSABLE, BUT ALSO AT HIS CURRENT LEVEL I DO THINK THERE IS A GREAT SHAME AT WHAT THE RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS IN T RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS IN E RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS IN ' RATIONALE FOR CLINTON IS IN '90s. THE MOST INTERESTING MOMENT TO ME, THE MOST HORRIFYING MOMENT ACTUALLY AND THE MOST PATHETIC AND SELF-SERVING MOMENT IN THIS TODAY SHOW INTERVIEW COMES WHEN HE PLEADS IN MITIGATION AND IT'S INTERESTING TO LOOK AT HIS FACIAL EXPRESSION AS HE SAYS THIS THAT I HAD A SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AS GOVERNOR IN THE 1980s. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S THE LESSON THE DEMOCRATS TOOK FROM THIS, THAT AS LONG AS YOU STRUCK THE RIGHT ATTITUDES IN PUBLIC, YOU COULD DO TRY THIS IN ANY OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE. HEY, BUD, YOU ARE DOUBLE PARKED. IT'S OKAY, OFFICER. I VOTED FOR THE MUNICIPAL PARKING LOT EXPANSION BILL IN 1973. THAT'S BASICALLY THE ARGUMENT THAT CLINTON IS MAKING HERE BECAUSE HE PASSED THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT BILL IN THE 1980s, BECAUSE HE SIGNED ONE AS GOVERNOR HE IS ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY ASSAULT WOMEN OR ENTER INTO THE GRADING RELATIONSHIPS, SUPPOSEDLY CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT RUINED IN THE CASE OF MONICA LEWINSKY A YOUNG WOMAN'S LIFE. AND THAT'S THE RATIONALE THAT HARVEY WEINSTEIN AND SCHNEIDERMAN, THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ALL THESE OTHERS AND JOHN CONYERS, THE BIG DEMOCRAT BIGSHOT WHO WAS HOSTING TROUSER LIST MEETINGS IN HIS CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE. THEY ARE ALL ACTUALLY FOLLOWING THAT CLINTON RATIONALE BUT BECAUSE I HAVE THE RIGHT ATTITUDES IN PUBLIC I CAN DO WHAT I LIKE IN PRIVATE. Tucker: HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S DEFENSE WAS I LOVE ABORTION, SO BACK OFF, LEAVE ME ALONE. SO QUENTIN, I CONFESS I FEEL A LITTLE SORRY FOR BILL CLINTON BECAUSE IN MY VIEW OF THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHANGING AND REJECTING ITS PAST. BUT I ALSO WONDER AS LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RECKONING WITH CLINTON OVER HIS BEHAVIOR, WHEN DID WE GET THE RECKONING WITH ALL OF HIS DEFENDERS IN THE MEDIA? "THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER WHO SAID THAT SHE WOULD GET ON HER KNEES FOR HIM FOR KEEPING ABORTION LEGAL. THE FEMINIST LEADERS WHO ATTACKED MONICA LEWINSKY IN EFFECT AND DISMISSED THE ALLEGATIONS. WHEN DO THEY GET THEIR TIME UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT FOR WHAT THEY DID? AND I THINK THERE'S ALSO OTHER ONES TOO. THERE WERE ONES WHO DIDN'T ATTACK MONICA BUT I REMEMBER FOR EXAMPLE BEING ATTACKED IN CANADA BY A FEMINIST COLUMNIST WHO SAYS YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT MONICA ISN'T THE VICTIM HERE. IF SHE'S GOING TO MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SHE HAS HAD A MISERABLE 20 YEARS. SHE WAS ESSENTIALLY RUINED AND TOSSED ASIDE BY BILL CLINTON AND AS WE SAW IN THIS INTERVIEW HE THINKS THAT HE IS THE VICTIM HERE AND HE'S OUT, BY THE WAY. HE'S ON A BOOK TOUR PEDDLING THIS NOVEL HE SUPPOSEDLY WITH JAMES PATTERSON AND SUPPOSEDLY IS MOST AMBITIOUS WORK OF FICTION SINCE HIS DEPOSITION IN THE PAULA JONES CASE. CLINTON IS GETTING A BAZILLION DOLLARS TO PUT HIS NAME TO THIS LUDICROUS NOVEL AND MONICA LEWINSKY IS SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER HAD A FULFILLED CAREER, NEVER HAD A FULFILLED FAMILY LIFE AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE CLINTONS JUST DISCARD PEOPLE AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BIT OF HUMAN DEBRIS. Tucker: AND THE MEDIA GOES
