1
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,687
>> Tucker: WELL, THAT CREEPY

2
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:11,922
PORN LAWYER WORKING FOR STORMY

3
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,624
DANIELS HAD ANOTHER BUSY

4
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:14,759
WEEKEND ON CABLE TELEVISION

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,528
WHERE HE VOWED TO INVADE MORE

6
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:18,562
PEOPLE'S PRIVATE LIVES.

7
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:22,166
FOR ME, IT'S TIME HE, HIMSELF,

8
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:22,967
WAS GIVEN A CLOSER LOOK.

9
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,268
HERE IS WHAT THE FEDERALIST

10
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:25,903
MOLLY HEMINGWAY SUGGESTED THE

11
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:26,337
OTHER DAY.

12
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,005
>> HE IS THE FRONT MAN FOR A

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,574
WELL-FUND AND A

14
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:30,208
WELL-COORDINATED OPERATION

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,709
THAT RECEIVED NEXT TO NO

16
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:32,910
CRITICISM OR REFLECTION BY

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,178
MANY PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA.

18
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:35,847
I THINK IT IS WORTH ASKING WHO

19
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:36,848
IS THIS GUY?

20
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:39,383
HOW DOES HE HAVE ACCESS TO

21
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:42,587
SPECIAL COUNSEL DOCUMENTS?

22
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:45,189
WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS?

23
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,390
IT'S WORTH FINDING OUT THIS

24
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,159
THING THAT IS DRIVING SO MUCH

25
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,395
OF THE COVERAGE.

26
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:52,964
>> Tucker: WHO IS THE CREEPY

27
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:53,364
PORN LAWYER?

28
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:55,433
WE DON'T ASK THE QUESTIONS

29
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,234
ENOUGH.

30
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,935
BUT MARK STEYN JOINS US.

31
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,103
WHO IS THIS GUY?

32
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,771
>> HE IS A WACKY GUY.

33
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:06,811
HE USED TO RUN TULL'S COFFEE

34
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:07,178
COMPANY.

35
00:01:07,178 --> 00:01:08,646
FOR MOST OF US NORTH OF THE

36
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:09,647
BORDER SOUNDS LIKE A BACK

37
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:09,981
JOKE.

38
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:15,153
HE HAD A COMPANY, IF YOU'RE A

39
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,587
SUCCESSFUL LAWYER YOU'D HAVE

40
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:17,989
GLOBAL BARRISTERS BUT HE HAD

41
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,492
ONE THAT WAS GLOBAL BARISTAS

42
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:23,261
AND GOT SUED NOT PAYING FOR

43
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:24,596
$160,000 WORTH OF COFFEE,

44
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,998
WHICH IS LITERALLY GROUNDS FOR

45
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:27,665
A LAWSUIT.

46
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,335
I MEAN, I DON'T QUITE

47
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:30,735
UNDERSTAND.

48
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:33,104
THIS GUY, THIS GUY NOT ONLY

49
00:01:33,104 --> 00:01:34,606
DOESN'T HE APPEAR TO HAVE EVER

50
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:36,307
MADE ANY MONEY FOR HIS

51
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:39,511
CLIENTS, HIS OWN LAW FIRM WENT

52
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:39,878
BANKRUPT.

53
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,547
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF --

54
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:45,417
BECAUSE AMERICA EMPLOYS AS

55
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,451
MANY LAWYERS AS THE REST OF

56
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,153
THE PLANET COMBINED.

57
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:50,455
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A LAWYER

58
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:53,391
SO INCOMPETENT HIS OWN FIRM

59
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:53,825
GOES BANKRUPT.

60
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:57,395
THIS GUY IS A VERY ECCENTRIC

61
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:57,729
FIGURE.

62
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,297
AS MOLLY SAID THERE IS A LOT

63
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,633
MORE TO BE FOUND OUT ABOUT

64
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,133
HIM.

65
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,602
>> Tucker: WHAT DOES IT SAY

66
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:04,903
ABOUT CABLE TELEVISION OR THE

67
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:06,204
OTHER TWO NETWORKS THAT THIS

68
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,607
GUY HAS BEEN THE SINGLE MOST

69
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:10,908
FREQUENT GUEST MAYBE EVER?

70
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,077
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT IT SAYS

71
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:13,311
IS ACTUALLY THAT HE IS MUCH

72
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,980
BETTER AT BEING A CABLE GUEST

73
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,747
THAN A LAWYER.

74
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:18,217
I MEAN THE TRAGEDY HERE --

75
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:19,451
>> Tucker: GOOD POINT.

76
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:24,156
>>  -- IS THAT STORMY -- I BET

77
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:26,959
YOU, POOR OLD STORMY WON'T SEE

78
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,060
$70 -- SHE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH

79
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,097
MONEY TO BUY A DECAF AVENATTI

80
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:34,766
AT THE TULLY'S COFFEE STORE BY

81
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,536
THE TIME IT'S ALL THROUGH.

82
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,404
BUT HE WILL GET PUBLICITY OUT

83
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:39,771
OF IT.

84
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:40,439
THAT IS IT.

85
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,641
>> Tucker: THAT IS A REALLY

86
00:02:42,641 --> 00:00:00,000
GOOD POINT.
