1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,540
Why is the triple axel such a big deal?

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,540
This is 1991,

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,940
the last year of the 
Cold War,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,120
the year Street Fighter II hit arcades

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,300
“Mr. Gorbachev Hadouken this wall.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,660
and the year Tonya Harding became the first
American woman to perform a triple axel in competition.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,260
The famous rivalry that bloomed is the one
between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,950
And in 1991 at the Target Center in Minneapolis,
MN, that meant:

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,760
“Nancy Kerrigan.”

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,600
“Very elegant.”

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,720
“Here comes Tonya Harding.”

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,510
“Very powerful skater.”

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,510
Kerrigan had this music.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,510
(elegant music)

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,510
Tonya Harding had Batman.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,500
“I’m Batman.”

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,440
And the triple axel is the 58 frames at the
heart of that elegant/powerful split.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,940
Mirai Nagasu’s the only other America woman
to land a triple axel in competition,

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,329
and when you ask her to define it in one word:

20
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,829
“Triple axel?”

21
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:10,491
She has to think about it.

22
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:15,680
And the thing is, the more you know about
the triple axel, the more impressive it gets.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
"Jump. Jump to it, to it, you know you want to do it do it.”

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,000
"Jump to it, to it, you know you want to-

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,749
The triple axel really starts with the approach.

26
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,340
The triple axel has a forward takeoff where
the skater pushes off the outside edge of

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,020
the skate, unlike say, a toe loop, where the
jumper relies on the toe of their skate to

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,569
thrust up and turn.

29
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,200
The approach is also forward instead of backwards.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,779
Axels are forward-edge jumps, landing backwards
on the opposite foot.

31
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:59,280
Because they turn from facing front to facing
backwards, it’s an extra half rotation,

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,340
without the help of a toe pick.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,800
All that makes the approach...

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,598
Deborah King’s studied figure skating and
the biomechanics of single, double, and triple

35
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,599
axels.

36
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,040
“They need to generate the vertical velocity,
but they also need to generate their angular

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,129
momentum, or their rotational momentum for
the jump, and that’s all gotta happen during

38
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,430
the approach up to the takeoff.”

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,379
You’ll see skaters with a slight skid on
the ice that helps, but most of the twist

40
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,230
comes from their bodies, not the ice.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Once you’re in the air, you have to deal
with what you generated on the ice.

42
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,400
So great skaters have big jumps.

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,280
But rotation speed makes or breaks a triple
axel.

44
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,890
This chart shows a small sample of single,
double, and triple axel jumps.

45
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,599
You can see the triple axel jump length is
often shorter than the double axel length.

46
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,480
That’s because that extra energy is going
into extra rotation.

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,689
Harding needed to snap into a tight rotation
as quickly as possible.

48
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,989
The triple axel is a physics problem.

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,110
“But in terms of body position, you don’t
want your elbows sticking out, you don’t

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,750
want your arms right out in front of you,
you don’t want your knees sticking out,

51
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,879
you should look sort of as close as you can
to a pencil.”

52
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,780
Skaters have to use a lot of upper body strength
to keep their arms tucked in so it won’t

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,870
slow down their spin.

54
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,031
It’s only once they’ve spun three and
a half times in the air that they can start

55
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,019
figuring out how to land.

56
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,760
And then, their big obstacle is slowing down.

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,159
Skaters try to land on the ball of their opposite
foot to absorb the speed of the rotation and

58
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,420
the big weight of their descent.

59
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,490
Midori Ito was the first woman to do a triple
axel in world competition in the late ‘80s.

60
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,269
When she wobbles like this
or Tonya Harding nearly falls over,

61
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,939
they’re compensating for a huge rotational
velocity, all the while trying to look good.

62
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:11,560
A triple axel turns physics into poetry, and
that’s probably the reason it’s hard to

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,320
describe, for anybody, in just one word.

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,400
“Triple axel?”

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,920
In the triple axel, power and elegance are
complements, not contradictions.

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,310
Bruce Wayne and Batman?

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,210
They’re the same person.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,070
A lot happened after 1991.

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,480
But in the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota?

70
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
Tonya Harding landed.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,760
“Oh the zamboni’s coming out, it’s gonna
be loud.”

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:00:00,000
“Oh the zamboni’s coming, it’s gonna
be loud.”
