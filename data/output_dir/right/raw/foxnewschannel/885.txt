1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:01,830
ADMINISTRATION IS BEYOND

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,164
BELIEF.

3
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:03,332
IT HAS TO STOP.

4
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:07,135
>> HERE NOW DALLAS, MOVIE

5
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:10,405
PRODUCER AND CEO OF CENTER

6
00:00:10,405 --> 00:00:10,706
STATE.

7
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,640
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,875
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

9
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:14,476
>> Martha: INTERESTING

10
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:15,711
READING ABOUT YOUR HISTORY.

11
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,812
YOU HAVE HAD A LOT OF

12
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:17,913
SUCCESS IN HOLLYWOOD AND

13
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:18,647
DOING INDEPENDENT FILMS

14
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,282
INVOLVED IN A LOT OF WORK

15
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:21,817
THAT PEOPLE THERE WOULD

16
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:23,452
RESPECT AND ADMIRE.

17
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:24,853
SO WHAT STARTED TO HAPPEN IN

18
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,388
YOUR LIFE THAT YOU THOUGHT,

19
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:27,055
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:30,625
I'M TIRED OF THIS WHOLE RAP?

21
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,828
>> YEAH, IT WAS TWO THINGS.

22
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:33,662
FIRST OF ALL, IN MY

23
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:35,564
HOLLYWOOD LIFE AND CAREER, I

24
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:38,033
NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A

25
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:39,568
STUDIO SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE

26
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:40,702
THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR

27
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:42,537
WOULD BRING THEIR PRODUCT TO

28
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:43,939
THE EXECUTIVES AND THE

29
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,307
STUDIOS AND ASK FOR

30
00:00:45,307 --> 00:00:46,942
FINANCING AND THE SCRIPTS

31
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:48,477
WOULD BE PUT THROUGH A

32
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:50,178
DIFFICULT FUSION PROCESS,

33
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:52,114
THE CREATIVE EXECUTIVES

34
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:54,850
WOULD PUT THEIR, YOU KNOW,

35
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,017
DERIVATIVE NOTES ONTO THE

36
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:56,451
SCRIPT.

37
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,719
AND WHAT WOULD COME OUT THE

38
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,920
OTHER SIDE WOULD BE

39
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,821
SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T

40
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,490
REALLY RESPOND TO VERY MUCH,

41
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,025
I THINK AS FILM PRODUCERS,

42
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,261
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE

43
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:08,697
CREATIVE VISION OF THE

44
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:14,770
WRITER AND DIRECTOR

45
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,137
AFUSIVELY.

46
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,805
OTHERWISE DON'T MAKE THE

47
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:17,773
MOVIE END OF STORY.

48
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,775
THE OTHER THING WAS I LOST

49
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,576
BOTH OF MY PARENTS IN

50
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,478
TERRIBLE SITUATIONS OF

51
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:24,613
DOMESTIC GUN VIOLENCE.

52
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:26,415
AND AFTER THAT HAPPENS TO

53
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,984
ONE PERSON, YOU DON'T HAVE A

54
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:32,154
LOT OF TIME FOR B.S.

55
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:32,888
>> Martha: I'M SURE YOU

56
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:33,188
DON'T.

57
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:37,292
I'M SURE YOU DON'T.

58
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:38,427
AND WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

59
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:39,928
THE WAY THINGS ARE BEING

60
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:41,096
DONE IN HOLLYWOOD.

61
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:42,063
YOU PICKED UP AND BROUGHT

62
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,131
YOUR FAMILY TO TEXAS WHERE

63
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:43,932
YOU GROUP.

64
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,567
YOU SAY NOW YOU HAVE

65
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:46,368
SOMETHING -- IS IT CALLED

66
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:48,403
THE TENNESSEE'S COUSIN'S

67
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:49,905
ROLE OR TEXAS COUSIN'S ROLE

68
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:51,072
HOW YOU FIGURE OUT WHETHER

69
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:51,973
OR NOT SOMETHING IS GOING TO

70
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:53,041
WORK IN THE REST OF AMERICA.

71
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:55,410
>> YEAH, WHAT I DO, MY --

72
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,412
BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY IS

73
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,747
FROM LOUISIANA.

74
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:00,949
AND WHAT I HAVE IS THE

75
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:01,850
LOUISIANA COUSIN TEST.

76
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,752
AND WHAT I'LL DO IS I WILL

77
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:05,787
TEXT MY COUSIN THE NAME OF

78
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,789
THE ACTOR THAT I'M ABOUT TO

79
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,056
CAST IN THE MOVIE AND IF

80
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:11,593
THEY KNOW WHO THAT ACTOR IS.

81
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:13,094
IT TENDS TO GIVE ME A GOOD

82
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,163
SENSE OF WHETHER THE MOVIE

83
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,665
WILL DO WELL IN AUDIENCES

84
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:17,699
OUTSIDE OF L.A. AND NEW

85
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:18,233
YORK.

86
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,502
SO LOUISIANA COUSIN TEST HAS

87
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:20,902
PROVEN.

88
00:02:20,902 --> 00:02:21,503
>> Martha: GIVE ME AN

89
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,471
EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY THAT

90
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:24,372
THEY WOULD GO NO, THAT

91
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:25,140
DOESN'T NOTHING FOR ME?

92
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,142
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE EXAMPLE

93
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:29,411
I HAVE GIVEN IN THE PAST,

94
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:32,714
TIMOTHY SHALAMAY FOR

95
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:33,148
EXAMPLE.

96
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:34,749
ALTHOUGH IS HE VERY TALENTED

97
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:36,117
ACTOR AND NOMINATED.

98
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:37,786
HE JUST DOESN'T.

99
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:38,954
>> Martha: HE IS NOT

100
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:39,621
RESONATING WITH THE COUSINS

101
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,055
IN TENNESSEE.

102
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:41,857
>> IS HE NOT RESONATING WITH

103
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,058
THAT CROWD.

104
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:43,725
>> Martha: MAKING MONEY OFF

105
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:44,192
THESE MOVIES.

106
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,560
YOU SAY IF YOU DO A MOVIE

107
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,862
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO, YOU KNOW,

108
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,330
HAD A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WAS

109
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,865
INJURED OR WRONGED AND THEN

110
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:50,932
THEY UNJUSTLY GO TO PRISON

111
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,300
AND THEN THEY COME OUT

112
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,935
AGAIN, AND THEY GO BACK AND,

113
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:54,903
YOU KNOW, SHOOT THE PEOPLE

114
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,438
WHO DID THIS TO THEM, YOU'RE

115
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:58,373
GOING TO MAKE MONEY ON YOUR

116
00:02:58,373 --> 00:02:58,740
MOVIE.

117
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,674
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

118
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:00,108
DISTRIBUTE IT?

119
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:00,742
>> YEAH.

120
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:01,076
YEAH.

121
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,445
THAT WAS -- THOSE WERE

122
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:04,679
PREDOMINANTLY MY PREVIOUS

123
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,582
FILMS WITH STONE COLD STEVE

124
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:07,916
AUSTIN.

125
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,485
IF YOU JUST MAKE A MOVIE

126
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:12,754
WHERE IT IS -- IT'S

127
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,489
UNCOMPROMISING AND

128
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,124
UNFORGIVING, AND DOESN'T

129
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:17,325
REALLY WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT

130
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:20,161
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OR

131
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,196
FILTERING YOUR OWN PERSONAL

132
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:22,564
POLITICS THROUGH THE FILM, I

133
00:03:22,564 --> 00:03:24,099
THINK WHAT YOU ARE FIND IS

134
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,667
THAT TRUE MOVIE BECOMES MORE

135
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,469
AUTHENTIC AND I THINK THAT

136
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,671
AUDIENCES CRAVE AUTHENTIC

137
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:30,939
EXPERIENCES AND ENTERTAINING

138
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:31,339
EXPERIENCES.

139
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,541
SO THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AND

140
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,042
IT'S PROVEN TO BE VERY

141
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:34,676
SUCCESSFUL FINANCIAL MODEL

142
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,644
FOR US.

143
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:36,444
>> Martha: I'M ALMOST OUT OF

144
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:36,745
TIME.

145
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,079
I NEED TO SQUEEZE THIS IN.

146
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,147
YOU HAVE A MOVIE YOU ARE

147
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,649
WORKING ON ABOUT A GIRL IN A

148
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:41,383
SCHOOL SHOOTING INCIDENT WHO

149
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:42,884
TURNS THE GUN ON THE SHOOTER

150
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:43,919
AND KILLS HIM.

151
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,420
AND YOU SAID YOU MIGHT HAVE

152
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,521
DIFFICULTY CASTING THAT

153
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:46,888
ROLE.

154
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:47,822
HOW IS THAT GOING?

155
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,024
>> YEAH.

156
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,026
IT'S CALLED RUN, HIDE,

157
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:51,326
FIGHT.

158
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,460
IT'S A TERRIFIC SCRIPT ABOUT

159
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,030
A YOUNG GIRL WHO DECIDES TO

160
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,498
FIGHT BACK INSTEAD OF RUN

161
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:58,500
AWAY FROM A TERRIBLE

162
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:58,867
SITUATION.

163
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,636
AND SHE LEANS ON HER

164
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:02,837
EXPERIENCES OF HUNTING WITH

165
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,339
HER FATHER OVER THE SEVERAL

166
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,075
YEARS THAT SHE WAS A

167
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:07,442
TEENAGER.

168
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,144
AND, I FOUND THAT THE SCRIPT

169
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:10,412
IS INCREDIBLE.

170
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,580
PEOPLE REALLY LOVE IT, BUT

171
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,782
THE ACTORS HAVE GIVEN PAUSE

172
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:15,684
AND THEIR MANAGERS HAVE SORT

173
00:04:15,684 --> 00:04:17,052
OF AT TIMES TALKED THEM OUT

174
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,519
OF STARRING IN THE MOVIE OUT

175
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,221
OF FEAR OF BACKLASH.

176
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:21,923
>> Martha: BECAUSE THEY WILL

177
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:24,726
BE HOLD GO AHEAD A

178
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:24,759

GOOD PERSON WITH A GUN

00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:28,930
ENDING A BAD SITUATION FOR

189
00:04:28,930 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMEBODY ELSE HOLDING ONE ON
