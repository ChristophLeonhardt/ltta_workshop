OTHER THAN THAT WE HAD EIGHT
PRIMARY IN ILLINOIS.
EVERY PRIMARY I COME TO TYT AND
WE WORK ON IT LIVE.
WE HAD UNCORRUPTED DEMOCRATS
THAT DON'T TAKE ANY
CORPORATE MONEY.
OF THE SEVEN,
310 RIGHT AND THEY WILL BE UP
AGAINST REPUBLICANS IN THE
GENERAL ELECTION, TWO WENT TO
THE RUNOFF, TO LOST SO FIVE OUT
OF SEVEN, NOT BAD AT ALL THAT IT
WAS A GOOD AND EXCITING NIGHT.
SOME OF THE CANDIDATES MOVED
INTO SECOND PLACE IN FIRST
PLACE AS THE NIGHT WORE ON DIED
IN ILLINOIS EARLIER THIS
WEEK IT DID NOT GO AS WELL.
THEY WERE FOR JUSTICE DEMOCRATS
UP INCLUDING THE MOST FAMOUS
Ã± IT WAS CLOSE.
DAN LIPINSKI IS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRAT.
HE IS ANTI-CHOICE AND WANTED TO
DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.
NEWMAN GOT THE BACKING OF A SLEW
OF GROUPS THAT CARED ABOUT
PROGRESSIVES, BUT UNFORTUNATELY
SHE COULD NOT PULL IT OUT.
ALL FOUR OF THE JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS LOST.
DANIEL WAS A VERY STRONG
PROGRESSIVE.
HE ALSO LOST TO JAMIE PRITZKER.
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THE TIMES
ESPECIALLY IN THE BIGGER
ELECTIONS THEY ARE NOT
ELECTIONS, THEY ARE AUCTIONS.
HE WILL BE GOING UP AGAINST
ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE WHO IS THE
CURRENT GOVERNOR.
IT WILL BE BILLIONAIRE ON
BILLIONAIRE CRIME IN THE GENERAL
ELECTION BUT PROGRESSIVES ARE
BLINKING THOSE CASES.
THERE BUT THERE IS GOOD NEWS
THAT CAME OUT OF ILLINOIS
FOR PROGRESSIVES.
YOU MIGHT THINK COME ON DUDE
YOU ARE STRETCHING THE
GOVERNOR'S RACE.
AND FIND OUT WHY THAT RACE IS SO
IMPORTANT.
THAT ONE STINGS.
WHEN YOU TOUCH THE MONEY PART OF
THE MACHINE THAT IS WHERE THEY
GET ANIMATED AND THAT IS WHY
THEY SPEND GOOD MONEY AND EFFORT
TRYING TO DEFEAT THE PROGRESSIVE
IN THAT CASE BUT THEY COULDN'T.
WHAT ARE 
THE RAMIFICATIONS
OF THAT?
WE HAVE SEEN WITH PEOPLE LIKE
LARRY KRASNER, THE DA IN
PHILADELPHIA SOMETIMES WHEN YOU
ELECT A PROGRESSIVE TO A
POSITION LIKE THAT IT MAKES ALL
THE DIFFERENCE.
IF THEY ACTUALLY CORRECTLY
ASSIST TAXES AND MAKE THE
RICH PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE IN
COOK COUNTY THAT CAN AFFECT
THEIR DONATIONS TO THOSE MACHINE
POLITICIANS.
BUT THE OTHER THING IS YOU WILL
ACTUALLY HAVE JUSTICE SERVE THE
POOR RESIDENTS IN THE MINORITY
RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY
ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES BEARING
ALL OF THE BURDEN WHICH MAKES
NO SENSE AT ALL ESPECIALLY IN AN
AREA CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS.
IF YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS LOOKING
OUT FOR DONORS, THEY ARE
NOT GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.
YOU HAVE PROGRESSIVES, THEY DO
LOOK OUT FOR YOU.
OUR REVOLUTION WAS A BIG PART OF
THE START.
THEY DID MAKE IT A
TOP
PRIORITY AND IT MADE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE.
LET ME GIVE YOU MORE CONTEXT
HERE.
THAT IS HOW THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE
SET THE STORY UP.
IT IS NOT MONDAY MORNING
QUARTERBACK IN GOD BEFORE THE
ELECTION PROGRESSIVE GROUPS THAT
IT WAS A TAX PRIORITY.
THE ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS
WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO
PROTECT THAT MONEY.
IN THAT CASE THE PROGRESSIVE WON
THE TEST SO THAT IS INDEED
VERY GOOD NEWS.
BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY GOOD
NEWS.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE REST.
INDEED VERY GOOD NEWS COMING OUT
OF ILLINOIS AS WELL.
WE WILL PUT THE LINK TO THE
INTERCEPT STORY DOWN BELOW
IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX.
READ IT FOR YOURSELF.
ILLINOIS, MIXED RESULTS
ADMITTEDLY, SOME
DISAPPOINTING LOSSES BUT SOME
SIGNIFICANT WINS AS WELL.
ONTO THE NEXT PRIMARY WE GO.
