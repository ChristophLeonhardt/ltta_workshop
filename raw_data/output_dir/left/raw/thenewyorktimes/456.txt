1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,376
Are these hard-boiled eggs?

2
00:00:01,376 --> 00:00:03,211
Oh, thank God.

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,462
Hi, this is Danny DeVito,

4
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:05,714
and this is how
you eat an egg,

5
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,133
and still say your lines,
on Broadway —

6
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,968
without choking.

7
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,636
That's not true.

8
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:16,140
Solomon takes 
hard-boiled egg

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,893
out of the portfolio 
and cracks it on his knuckles.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,105
I use my cane.

11
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,690
It's kind of funny, I think.

12
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,986
What's this now, lunch?

13
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,363
You give me such an argument,
I got hungry.

14
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,991
I'm not supposed to get 
too hungry.

15
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,368
We've had some difficult
nights,

16
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,786
you know where the
peel doesn't come off.

17
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,496
Some of the egg comes with it.

18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,956
I got a thumb movement

19
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,167
and I've developed a this —
you know, this thing,

20
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,252
kind of, like, "tadadit,
tadadit, tadadit."

21
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,295
Aiming toward the bag,

22
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,421
always aiming toward
the bag,

23
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,382
because Solomon doesn't clean.

24
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,092
That's the way it is.

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,187
What, you want me 
to starve to death?

26
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,105
I try to, like, take a nice
hefty amount

27
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,150
in the very beginning.

28
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,778
It's really good to dig into
the yellow,

29
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:14,616
because that's where
the kind of masticating conflict is.

30
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,493
I'll be very quick here.

31
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,036
I'm going to give you a good
price.

32
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,454
Don't worry.

33
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,415
I'm gonna knock you off your
feet with the price.

34
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,835
It is very difficult to eat
just a dry, hard-boiled egg.

35
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,754
So, you know, it really 
motivates,

36
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,172
if you get enough in there,</b>

37
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,674
it motivates the next line,
which is:

38
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:35,637
There wouldn't be a little
salt, I suppose?

39
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,431
Because you really would like
a little salt.

40
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,558
You need some saliva,
you know.

41
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,853
I mean, right now I'm spitting
all over the place.

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,732
Don't chew with your mouth
full!

43
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:50,527
Why? It's funny.

44
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,238
I'm not going running for salt
now.

45
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,531
Don't be blue.

46
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,033
I'm going to knock you off your
feet with the price.

47
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,409
You'll see.

48
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,870
It's fun every night.

49
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,122
It's different every night.

50
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,414
When you're up there,
it's like skiing.

51
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,874
It's like you're going
down the mountain.

52
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,876
Yeah there's rocks and things,
and things happen —

53
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,253
all kinds of stuff.

54
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,503
The audience gets into it

55
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:11,339
and we do stretch it out
a little bit.

56
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,091
It's very difficult for me
to go on stage

57
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,094
and have — just eat the egg
and, like, let it go.

58
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,346
Not to stop the play, not to
stop the play,

59
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,014
because the play
is like the thing, so —

60
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,724
But the idea is that
you gotta —

61
00:02:21,724 --> 00:00:00,000
you have a little fun
in the middle.
