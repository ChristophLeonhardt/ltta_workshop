1
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,389
>>> WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR 

2
00:00:23,389 --> 00:00:24,190
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE DEPUTY 

3
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,857
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 

4
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:27,694

00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,595
RELATED TO THE MUELLER

00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:28,928

00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,098
BUT THERE YOU SEE PRESIDENT

ALSO IN GREAT BRITAIN.

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,982
THIS IS, OF COURSE, AHEAD OF HIS

16
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:55,288
MEETING ON MONDAY IN HWITH VLAD 

17
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:55,488

00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,428
THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS 

21
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,263
FOR THE TRIP FOR THE PRESIDENT 

22
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:15,141
AND THE FIRST LADY.

23
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,176
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE 

24
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:20,046
HEADLINES IN GREAT BRITAIN WITH 

25
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,582
HIS CRITICISM OF THERESA MAY, 

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,351
HIS PRAISE OF ONE OF HER 

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,921
OPPONENTS WHO JUST LEFT THE 

28
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,290
GOVERNMENT, THE FOREIGN MINISTER

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,994
BORIS JOHNSON, AND PROTESTS 

30
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,263
ACROSS GREAT BRITAIN.

31
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,266
THE PRESIDENT BEING MET THERE BY

32
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:46,739
QUEEN ELIZABETH.

33
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,075
PRESIDENT IS EXAMINED TO SPEND 

34
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,178
THE WEEKEND AT ONE OF HIS GOLF 

35
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:56,382
RESORTS IN SCOTLAND, TURN BERRY.

36
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,419
MIGHT GET A LITTLE GOLF IN, 

37
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,053
PREPARING FOR THE MEETING WITH 

38
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:07,093
PRESIDENT PUTIN.

39
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,294
THE PRESIDENT LIKES THE POMP OF 

40
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,029
THESE TRIPS.

41
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,131
REMEMBER THE BIG MILITARY PARADE

42
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,666
HE HAD IN PARIS, LIKED IT SO 

43
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,335
MUCH THAT HE'S ASKED OUR 

44
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:20,240
MILITARY TO REPLICATE IT.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,807
THAT'S GOING TO COME UP IN 

46
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,377
NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR.

47
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,281
ON THE BUSINESS SIDE, IT HAS 

48
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,485
BEEN A CONTROVERSIAL TRIP.

49
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,388
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS 

50
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,823
MEETING WITH THE NATO LEADERS HE

51
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,893
IS WILLING TO GO IT ALONG IF 

52
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,462
THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW UP ON THEIR 

53
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:44,297
PLEDGE TO INCREASE DEFENSE 

54
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:53,273
SPENDING.

55
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,241
THE HEADLINES SURPRISED THE 

56
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,810
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA 

57
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,077
MAY.

58
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,412
THEY'RE TRYING TO CLEAN THAT UP 

59
00:02:59,412 --> 00:02:59,879
AS WELL.

60
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,284
THIS PART OF THE TRIP IS 

61
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:10,122
CEREMONIAL.

62
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,258
AS WE SEE THAT NOW WE HAVE 

63
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,194
LEARNED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

64
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,029
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN WILL BE 

65
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,397
ANNOUNCING AN DIE.

66
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:23,403
RUSSIAN NATIONALS RELATED TO THE

67
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,505
HACK OF THE DNC. 

68
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,808
>> THE INDICTMENT COMES AS THE 

69
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:29,475
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO MEET WITH 

70
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,177
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

71
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,277
IT CHARGES THAT RUSSIAN 

72
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,813
NATIONALS ASSOCIATED WITH 

73
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,182
RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 

74
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,618
HACKED THE DNC AND THEN GOT THAT

75
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,087
INFORMATION OUT TO HARM THE 

76
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,955
CAMPAIGN OF HILLARY CLINTON.

77
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,290
SO THEY'RE CHARGING NOW 

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,525
INDICTMENTS TODAY AGAINST 

79
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,261
RUSSIAN NATIONALS IN CONNECTION 

80
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,797
WITH THE HACK OF THE DNC, 

81
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,030
GEORGE. 

82
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,364
>> ALL OF THEM ARE MEMBERS OF 

83
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:56,269
THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE 

84
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,637
SERVICES ON TOP OF THE THREE 

85
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,871
ENTITIES INDICTED BACK IN 

86
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,572
FEBRUARY.

87
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,273
I WANT TO BRING IN CHRIS 

88
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,075
CHRISTIE AS WELL, FORMER 

89
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:06,545
GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, ADVISER 

90
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,081
TO THE PRESIDENT FOR A LONG 

91
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,281
TIME.

92
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,749
CHRIS, THE TIMING HERE 

93
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,250
UNMISTAKABLE, JUST A FEW DAYS 

94
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,285
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S SUMMIT 

95
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:12,718
WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN?

96
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:17,390
>> THAT'S A VERY AGGRESSIVE MOVE

97
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,326
BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE 

98
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:25,832
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF SOME OF 

99
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,466
THE ANSWERS THE PRESIDENT GAVE 

100
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,768
TO QUESTIONS HOW MUCH HE WOULD 

101
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,170
CHALLENGE PRESIDENT PUTIN ON THE

102
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,138
IDEA THEY WERE MEDDLING IN THE 

103
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,174
U.S. ELECTION.

104
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:38,845
IT'S UNMISTAKABLE TO CONCLUDE 

105
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,279
THAT BOB MUELLER WANTED TO MAKE 

106
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,515
SURE THAT WAS NOT A DEBATABLE 

107
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,015
POINT ON THIS ISSUE. 

108
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,385
>> YOU NOW HAVE UNANIMOUS 

109
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,085
FINDINGS OF THE AMERICAN 

110
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,320
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, AND NOW 

111
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,524
25 RUSSIAN NATIONALS INDICTED BY

112
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:51,924
ROBERT MUELLER. 

113
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,761
>> LISTEN, GEORGE, I'VE SAID 

114
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,531
THERE'S NO DEBATE WHETHER 

115
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,599
RUSSIANS TRIED TO MEDDLE IN THE 

116
00:04:59,599 --> 00:04:59,866
ELECTION.

117
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:05,405
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY DID.

118
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:11,411
AND NOW YOU'RE FINDING THAT A 

119
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,714
SPECIAL COUNSEL WITH GRAND JURY 

120
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,881
SUBPOENA AUTHORITY HAS COME TO 

121
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,285
THE CONCLUSION AND MORE 

122
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,052
IMPORTANTLY, GEORGE, A GRAND 

123
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:23,489
JURY OF ORDER AMERICANS HAS 

124
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,557
FOUND PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE 

125
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,827
THAT THEY MEDDLED.

126
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,532
THAT MAKES IT MORE POWERFUL.

127
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,200
NORMAL AMERICANS HAVE REACHED 

128
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,404
THE SAME CONCLUSION. 

129
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,474
>> WE HAVE A CONSPIRACY OF 

130
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,277
RUSSIAN NATIONALS AND HE IS 

131
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,545
CHARGED PAUL MANAFORT, THE 

132
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:47,513
FORMER CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN WITH 

133
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:53,553
TAX FRAUD AND OTHER VIOLATIONS.

134
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,321
HE'S REACHED GUILTY PLEAS WITH 

135
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,189
RICK GATES AND MICHAEL FLYNN, 

136
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,526
THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY 

137
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:08,868
ADVISER, PAPADOPOULOS AS WELL. 

138
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,271
>> THERE'S NO INDICATION, BUT 

139
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,973
IT'S NOTABLE AT THE PRESS 

140
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,773
CONFERENCE THE PRESIDENT HAD 

141
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:18,511
TODAY WITH THERESA MAY, THE 

142
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,012
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER, HE 

143
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,280
REFERRED ONCE AGAIN TO THE 

144
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,083
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AS A 

145
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,754
WITCH-HUNT AND ADDED A NEW 

146
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,957
ADJECTIVE, A RI"RIGGED" 

147
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,024
WITCH-HUNT.

148
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,659
NOW WE SEE MUELLER COMING OUT 

149
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,660
WITH THESE INDICTMENTS.

150
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,264
I THINK THE TIMING IS INCREDIBLY

151
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,265
SIGNIFICANT HERE, GEORGE, THE 

152
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:41,567
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT

153
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,970
TO SIT DOWN WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN 

154
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,974
AT A SUMMIT MEETING.

155
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,609
MUELLER CAN DO THESE INDICTMENTS

156
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,109
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

157
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,778
HE'S DECIDED TO DO IT ON THE EVE

158
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:59,685
OF THAT SUMMIT ON MONDAY.

159
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,188
AS GOVERNOR CHRISTIE POINTS OUT,

160
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,290
IT POINTS OUT THIS WILL BE A 

161
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,093
SUBJECT OF THAT SUMMIT MEETING.

162
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,594
>> IT COMES AT A TIME WHERE WE 

163
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,961
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A BIG BACK AND

164
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,564
FORTH BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT'S 

165
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,966
LEGAL TEAM AND ROBERT MUELLER 

166
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,735
OVER WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE THE 

167
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,868
PRESIDENT SIT DOWN WITH ROBERT 

168
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,971
MUELLER FOR AN INTERVIEW ON SOME

169
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,873
OF THESE QUESTIONS, AND IT'S 

170
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:26,345
BECOME UNMISTAKABLE THERE THAT 

171
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,280
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY UNLIKELY 

172
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,416
TO SIT DOWN FOR THE INTERVIEW. 

173
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,920
>> I WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT A 

174
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,555
LITTLE BIT NORTH OF A ZERO 

175
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,823
PERCENT CHANCE THAT INTERVIEW 

176
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:38,957
TAKE PLACE, DESPITE THE FACT THE

177
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,060
PRESIDENT HAS SAID OVER AND OVER

178
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,662
AGAIN AT LEAST TWO TIMES 

179
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,096
DIRECTLY TO ME THAT HE WOULD 

180
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,799
100% SIT DOWN FOR AN INTERVIEW.

181
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,967
IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE HAS NOW 

182
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,638
TAKEN THE ADVICE OF HIS LAWYERS,

183
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,071
AD

184
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:53,739
ADVICE THAT'S BEEN CONSISTENT 

185
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,275
NOT TO DO THAT INTERVIEW.

186
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,444
THE LIST OF INDICTMENTS IS 

187
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,212

374
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,285
MEANS THAT WE FOLLOW PROCEDURES,

375
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,655
AND WE RESERVE JUDGMENT.

376
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,957
WE COMPLETE OUR INVESTIGATIONS 

377
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:28,227
AND WE EVALUATE ALL OF THE 

378
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,695
RELEVANT EVIDENCE BEFORE WE 

379
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,797
REACH ANY CONCLUSION.

380
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,699
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

381
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,434
EXPECT THEIR DEPARTMENT OF 

382
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:40,272
JUSTICE TO OPERATE, AND THAT IS 

383
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:40,906
HOW OUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO 

384
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:41,139
OPERATE.

385
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,175
IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM EVERYONE 

386
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,378
WHO'S CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS 

387
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,679
PRESUMED INNOCENT UNLESS AND 

388
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,383
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

389
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,085
IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING THE 

390
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,154
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHARGED WITH 

391
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,856
A CRIME ALSO ARE PRESUMED 

392
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,323
INNOCENT.

393
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,859
THE INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED 

394
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,593
TODAY BECAUSE INCORPORATES 

395
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,629
DETERMINED THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS

396
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,230
SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THESE 

397
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,634
ALLEGATIONS TO A FEDERAL GRAND 

398
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:08,901
JURY.

399
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,536
OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON 

400
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:15,974
THE FACTS, THE LAW, AND 

401
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,211
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICIES.

402
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,445
I BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT 

403
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,348
THESE ALLEGATIONS YEARLY THIS 

404
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:23,548
WEEK.

405
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,182
THE PRESIDENT IS FULLY AWARE OF 

406
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:29,221
THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS TODAY.

407
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:35,761
I HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED THE 

408
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,629
VICTIMS.

409
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,062
WE

410
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:39,865
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO VOID 

411
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,767
THINKING POLITICALLY AS 

412
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,635
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, 

413
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,603
INSTEAD THINKING PATRIOTLY AS 

414
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,941
AMERICANS.

415
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,142
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON 

416
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,745
WHICH SIDE WAS VICTIMIZED.

417
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:56,781
THE INTERNET ALLOWS FOREIGN 

418
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,083
ADVERSARY TOSS ATTACK AMERICA IN

419
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,919
MY AND UNEXPECTED WAYS, FREE AND

420
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,555
FAIR ELECTIONS ARE ALWAYS HARD 

421
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,058
FOUGHT AND CONTENTIOUS.

422
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,659
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ADD VER 

423
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,928
SAYERS TO SEEK TO EXACERBATE OUR

424
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,799
DIVISIONS AND TRY TO CONFUSE, 

425
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,136
DIVIDE, AND CONQUER US.

426
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,837
SO LONG AS WE ARE UNITED IN OUR 

427
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,507
COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES 

428
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,742
ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION, 

429
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,746
THEY WILL NOT SUCCEED.

430
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,848
A PARTISAN WARFARE FUELED BY 

431
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,650
MODERN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT 

432
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,624
FAIRLY REFLECT THE GRACE, 

433
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:43,162
DIGNITY, AND UNITY OF THE 

434
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,129
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

435
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:49,601
THE BLAME BELONGS ON THE 

436
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:49,868
CRIMINALS.

437
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,970
WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD 

438
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,275
TO PRESERVE OUR VALUES, PROTECT 

439
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:56,909
AGAINST FUTURE INTERFERENCE AND 

440
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,778
DEFEND AMERICA.

441
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:00,311
I HAVE TIME TO TAKE A FEW 

442
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,013
QUESTIONS.

443
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,047
>> GENERAL ROSENSTEIN, A 

444
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,850
QUESTION FOR YOU, SIR.

445
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,087
NUMBER ONE, THE TIMING ON THE 

446
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:13,258
EVE OF THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING, 

447
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,059
CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT?

448
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,061
>> THE TIMING, AS I MENTIONED, 

449
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,130
IS A FUNCTION OF THE COLLECTION 

450
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,697
OF THE FACTS, THE EVIDENCE AND 

451
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:22,134
THE LAW AND A DETERMINATION THAT

452
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,535
IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT THE

453
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,303
INDICTMENT AT THIS TIME.

454
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,338
AS I MENTIONED, I BRIEFED THE 

455
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:26,605
PRESIDENT.

456
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,041
WITH REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THE

457
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,176
INVESTIGATION, I ONLY COMMENT ON

458
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,679
THE EVIDENCE.

459
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,313
THE EVIDENCE THAT IS REFLECTED 

460
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:39,384
IN OUR INDICTMENTS AND CHARGES 

461
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,287
REPRESENTS A DETERMINATION BY 

462
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,289
PROSECUTORS AND AGENT WITHOUT 

463
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,591
REGARD TO APPLICATIONS THAT THE 

464
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,693
EVIDENCE IS SUFFICIENT TO 

465
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,160
JUSTIFY THE CHARGES. 

466
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,927
>> DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, I 

467
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,797
KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT 

468
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,964
IN A THAT IN YOUR VIEW THE 

469
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,766
EVIDENCE DOESN'T SHOW ANY VOTES 

470
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,301
WERE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS

471
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,137
HACKING, BUT YOU DID SAY THAT A 

472
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,073
COMPANY USED AS A PASS-THROUGH 

473
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,141
COORDINATED WITH THESE 

474
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,911
DEFENDANTS TO ENHANCE THE TIMING

475
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,545
OF THE RELEASE AND THE IMPACT ON

476
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,080
THE ELECTION.

477
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,515
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE 

478
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:12,050
EVIDENCE SHOWS IN THAT RESPECT?

479
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,385
>> WHAT I HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS 

480
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:16,288
WHAT THE ALLEGED IN THE 

481
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:16,588
INDICTMENT.

482
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,222
WE KNOW ACCORDING TO THE 

483
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:17,856
ALLEGATIONS IN THE INDICTMENT 

484
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,292
THE GOAL OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS

485
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,895
TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE 

486
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:26,631
ELECTIONS AND WHAT THEIR 

487
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,066
MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN TO 

488
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,134
PROVE THIS OFFENSE IS A MATTER 

489
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:29,735
OF SPECULATION.

490
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,136
THAT'S NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

491
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:35,807
THERE'S NO ALLEGATIONS IN THE 

492
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,441
INDICTMENT ABOUT IT, AND THAT'S 

493
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:36,808
NOT OUR CHARGE.

494
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,443
>> IN TERMS OF THE STATE 

495
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,046

500
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,620
EVIDENCE OF OTHER STATES BEING 

501

SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATED BY THE 

502
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:50,556
RUSSIANS?

503
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,723
>> IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO 

504
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,158
UNDERSTAND WHAT I TOLD YOU THE 

505
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:56,061
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

506

THE INDICTMENT.

507

THE FBI AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE 

508
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,900
COMMUNITY AGENCIES ARE WORKING 

509
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,934
CONSTANTLY TO DEFEND AGAINST 

510
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:03,534
CYBERATTACKS IN THE UNITED 

511
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:03,801
STATES.

512
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:07,139
THIS CASE IS JUST ABOUT ONE 

513
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,273
PARTICULAR EFFORT THAT WAS MADE 

514
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,540
DURING THE 2016 ELECTION.

515
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,179
THE EFFORTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT, 

516
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,046
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 

517
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,682

AND THEY'RE GOING TO POST-DATE 

522
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:23,955
THIS INDICTMENT.

523
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:27,426
SO WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SHIRE 

524
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,861
RELEVANT INTELLIGENCE WITH OUR 

525
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,362
PARTNERS.

526
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,196
THERE IS A CONCERTED AND 

527
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,565
ORGANIZED EFFORT BY THE FEDERAL 

528
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,166
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

529
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,803
DO DETER AND PREVENT ANY SORT OF

530
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:46,411
CYBERATTACKS ON OUR ELECTIONS. 

531
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,147
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU 

532
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:49,814
BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER 

533
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:51,883
THIS WEEK.

534
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:55,220
DID HE INDICATE HIS SUPPORT FOR 

535
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,589
THIS ACTION AND WHAT WAS HIS 

536
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:57,856
REACTION?

537
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,324
>> I'LL LET THE PRESIDENT SPEAK 

538
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,560
FOR HIMSELF.

539
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,594
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO KNOW

540
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,762
BECAUSE HE'S GOT TO MAKE 

541
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,263
IMPORTANT DECISIONS FOR THE 

542
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:05,496
COUNTRY.

543
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:06,998
SO HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 

544
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:10,302
EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR ELECTION 

545
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:10,635
INTERFERENCE.

546
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:11,102
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

RUSSIAN NATIONALS FOR 

552

CONSPIRACYING TO INTERFERE IN 

553
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:27,719

EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NAMED IN 

559
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:34,459
THE INDICTMENT.

560
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,360
AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE CHIEF 

561
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,064
TARGETS ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW, 

562
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,366
JOHN PODESTA WHOSE E-MAIL WAS 

563
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,669
HACKED BACK IN APRIL OF 2016 AND

564
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,506
RELEASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 

565
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:47,773
CAMPAIGN.

566
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,107
YOUR REACTION TO THESE 

567
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,108
INDICTMENTS, JOHN?

568
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,843
>> GEORGE, I THINK AT THE HEART 

569
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,079
OF ALL OF THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

570
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,081
THE FACT THAT CRIMES THAT WERE 

571
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,282
COMMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUAL 

572
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,283
AMERICANS INCLUDING MYSELF, BUT 

573
00:21:59,283 --> 00:22:00,718
ALSO CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST 

574
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:01,218
THE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.

575
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:05,823
AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 

576
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:06,658
DONALD TRUMP LIKES TO DESCRIBE 

577
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,294
THIS AS A WITCH-HUNT.

578
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,630
WELL, WE JUST FOUND SOME WITCHES

579
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,263
AND THEY WERE INDICTED.

580
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:14,666
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

581
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,335
PEOPLE KNEW HAD HAPPENED ALL 

582
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:20,806
ALONG, THAT UNDERLYING ALL THIS 

583
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,176
CRIMES WERE COMMITTED AND THAT'S

584
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:24,776
WHY THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION 

585
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,545
HAS BEEN SO IMPORTANT AND WHY IT

586
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,381
NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED IN AN 

587
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:29,814
UNFETTERED MANNER. 

588
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,449
>> ROD ROSENSTEIN ISN'T MAKING 

589
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:32,818
THE ALLEGATION IN THIS 

590
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,452
INDICTMENT THESE HACKS CHANGED 

591
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,753
THE COURSE OF THE ELECTION.

592
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,288
YOUR VIEW ON THAT?

593
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,389
>> YOU KNOW, LOOK, I THINK WHEN 

594
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:41,393
AN ELECTION IS SO CLOSE IT'S 

595
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,627
HARD TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON ANY 

596
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,262
ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE, BUT 

597
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:53,305
CLEARLY THIS HAD SOME IMPACT.

598
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,573
I'M SORRY, I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF

599
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,341
NOISE ON THE CALL, GEORGE.

600
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,143
BUT WITH I THINK THE DECISION TO

601
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,944
DRIBBLE THESE OUT OVER THE 

602
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,215
COURSE OF A MONTH WHICH INTENDED

603
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,317
TO HURT OUR CAMPAIGN AND TO WHAT

604
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:08,820
EXTENT IT WAS USED IN ORDER TO 

605
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,621
FUEL, AGAIN, OTHER ACTIVITIES 

606
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,856
THAT WERE DONE BY BOTH THE 

607
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:14,759
RUSSIANS AND AMERICAN SOURCES 

608
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,294
WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE FOR HISTORY 

609
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:16,628
TO JUDGE. 

610
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,630
>> THE INDICTMENT LAYING THIS 

611
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,265
RIGHT AT THE FEET OF VLADIMIR 

612
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,034
PUTIN, HIS MILITARY 

613
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:23,367
INTELLIGENCE.

614
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:23,734
>> ABSOLUTELY.

615
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:27,839
YOU KNOW, THESE WERE OPERATIONS 

616
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,008
CONDUCTED BY RUSSIAN MILITARY 

617
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,278
INTELLIGENCE, BY THE GRU, 

618
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,013
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE MEETING 

619
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:36,013
PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE NEXT 

620
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:38,950
COUPLE DAYS.

621
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,252
YOU KNOW, ONE WOULD HOPE THAT HE

622
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:47,058
WOULD PUSH BACK ON THE RUSSIAN 

623
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:51,496
PRESIDENT IN THAT REGARD WHO HAS

624
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,732
CLEARLY, I THINK, AUTHORIZED 

625
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,200
THESE INVESTIGATIONS, BUT I 

626
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,903
DON'T HOLD OUT MUCH HOPE THAT HE

627
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,872
WILL TAKE THIS ANY MORE 

628
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:05,644
SERIOUSLY THAN HE HAS IN HIS 

629
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:05,944
PRESIDENT. 

630
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,544
>> CHRIS CHRISTIE, YOU JUST 

631
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,246
HEARD THAT LAST POINT FROM JOHN 

632
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,948
PODESTA RIGHT THERE.

633
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,050
THE PRESIDENT BRIEFED ON THIS 

634
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,917
ACCORDING TO ROD ROSENSTEIN 

635
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:14,719
EARLIER IN THE WEEK.

636
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,319
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WILL OR 

637
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,389
SHOULD CHANGE THE PRESIDENT'S 

638
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,556
STANCE TOWARD VLADIMIR PUTIN IN 

639
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:22,894
THIS SUMMIT COMING UP ON MONDAY?

640
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:29,134
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S GOING

641
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,337
TO SAY WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF 

642
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,005
RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO 

643
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,207
WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE 

644
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,976
HACKING OF THE TOWNS PEOPLE WHO 

645
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,077
WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE 

646
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,046
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2016.

647
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,282
SO I DO THINK THIS IS AN 

648
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,550
IMPORTANT BIT OF INFORMATION TO 

649
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,018
HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE 

650
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:47,452
PRESIDENT.

651
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,322
I'M GLAD THAT DEPUTY ATTORNEY 

652
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:50,922
GENERAL ROSENSTEIN SHARED IT 

653
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,357
WITH THE PRESIDENT PRIOR TO ITS 

654
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,459
RELEASE AND PRIOR TO HIS 

655
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,727
DEPARTURE FROM THE UNITED STATES

656
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,796
SO HE COULD HAVE THAT 

657
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,430
INFORMATION BEFORE HE GOES TO 

658
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,434
SEE PRESIDENT PUTIN.

659
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,068
THERE'S NO QUESTION, GEORGE, 

660
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,902
THAT THIS IS POWER INFORMATION 

661
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:06,805
THAT ADDS TO THE NARRATIVE THAT 

662
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,606
THE RUSSIANS WERE ATTEMPTING IN 

663
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,008
SOME WAY TO INTERFERE IN THE 

664
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,310
ELECTION IN THE UNITED STATES.

665
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,279
THIS IS SOMETHING I AM CONFIDENT

666
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,615
THE PRESIDENT IS NOW GOING TO 

667
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,882
RAISE WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN ON 

668
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:18,115
MOUND. 

669
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,317
>> WE HEARD FROM ROD ROSENSTEIN 

670
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,354
DURING THE COURSE OF HIS PRESS 

671
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,088
CONFERENCE THAT SEVERAL 

672
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,423
AMERICANS DID CORRESPOND WITH 

673
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,524
THESE INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS OVER

674
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,726
THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN, OVER

675
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,561
THE COURSE OF THE HACKING.

676
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,962
THOUGH HE SAYS THEY DIDN'T 

677
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,264
NECESSARILY KNOW OR THERE'S 

678
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:35,533
ALLEGATION KNEW THEY WERE 

679
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,201
CORRESPONDING WITH RUSSIAN 

680
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,237
MILITARY INFORMATION, NO 

681
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:44,275
INFORMATION THAT ANY AMERICAN 

682
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:48,747
CITIZENS WERE COOPERATING. 

683
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,181
>> NO AMERICANS, CERTAINLY 

684
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,250
NOBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUMP

685
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,419
CAMPAIGN KNOWINGLY PART OF THIS,

686
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,154
AND NOTHING TO AFFECT THE ACTUAL

687
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,155
VOTE COUNT.

688
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,458
BUT GEORGE, AS YOU REMEMBER, THE

689
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,660
PRESIDENT DURING THE CAMPAIGN 

690
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,228
SAID THE HACKING COULD HAVE BEEN

691
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,197
DONE BY A 400-POUND GUY SITTING 

692
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,365
ON HIS BED.

693
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,866
HE HAS DOWNPLAYED THE RUSSIAN 

694
00:26:08,866 --> 00:26:10,101
INVOLVEMENT ON THIS CONTINUOUSLY

695
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,403
EVEN AS PRESIDENT, EVEN AS HE'S 

696
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,538
HAD ACCESS TO THE INTELLIGENCE.

697
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,941
NOW HE IS LOOKING AT AN 

698
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,708
INDICTMENT THAT GOES RIGHT TO 

699
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,744
THE GRU, THAT IS RUSSIAN 

700
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,779
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, THE 

701
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:22,947
LARGEST FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE 

702
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,918
AGENCY IN RUSSIA DIRECTLY AT 

703
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,454
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S FEET JUST AS 

704
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,822
HE'S GOING TO BE SITTING DOWN 

705
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,089
WITH HIM. 

706
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,092
>> FINAL POINT FOR PIERRE 

707
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,325
THOMAS.

708
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:35,359
NO ALLEGATIONS IN THIS 

709
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,262
INDICTMENT ABOUT AMERICAN 

710
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,530
CITIZENS, BUT THAT LEAVES OPEN 

711
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,498
THE BIG QUESTIONS, WHAT IS NEXT 

712
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,065
FOR ROBERT MUELLER?

713
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:42,133
>> THAT'S RIGHT, GEORGE.

714
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:46,237
THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING, 

715
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,271
BUT THE DOMINANT POINT IS THE 

716
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,140
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS 

717
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,040
SAYING WE KNOW PRECISELY WHO IN 

718
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,613
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS 

719
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,213
INVOLVED IN THIS HACK, AND WE 

720
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:56,680
KNOW HOW THEY DID IT.

721
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,149
THEY'RE NAMING AND SHAMING.

722
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,951
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE TODAY, 

723
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:00,184
GEORGE. 

724
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:00,918
>> 12 RUSSIAN NATIONALS 

725
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:02,987
CONNECTED TO RUSSIAN MILITARY 

726
00:27:02,987 --> 00:27:03,755
INTELLIGENCE, THAT MEANS 

727
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:04,856
CONNECTED TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

728
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,857
