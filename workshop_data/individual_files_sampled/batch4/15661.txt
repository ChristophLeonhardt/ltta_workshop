esra levan for the rebel media I'm in London England where I was reporting on Tommy Robinson's legal appeal the appeal went one day so I took the next day to go around London to some of the places that Tommy Robinson himself reported on when he was working with the rebel and one of them is here in wood a suburb of London where in 2013 Lee Rigby a 25 year old British soldier was murdered right on this spot by two Muslim terrorists they were born Christians of Nigerian descent they converted to Islam and were radicalized Michael adda Balay Joe and Michael audible wali Solly Rigby come out of the nearby barracks ran him down with their car hopped out of the car with butcher knives and a gun and proceeded to hack him to bits trying to behead him right there on the street citizens were shocked no one intervenes someone filmed the attackers on video take a look at Michael audible a Joe literally covered in Lee Rigby's blood brandishing his machete telling people exactly what he was doing and why Muslims are dying daily by the soldier a new soldier is one he's an eye for eye and a tooth for tooth by Allah we swear by the Almighty Allah will never stop writing you until you leave us alone there you have it he was doing it for Allah he was doing it in his Islamic holy war bringing terrorism to the country well here we are five years later and where's the memorial where's the statue where's the plaque where's the story where's some sort of consecration of this ground you have nothing you have this what's this some sort of power transformer what what what on earth is is this all there is like an unmarked tombstone what all there is is some flowers and a tiny brass plaque on the ground covered in dirt and more to the point without any meaning in loving memory and a tribute to a true hero Lee Rigby his date of birth in the day he was murdered in our hearts forever but with no explanation who was he there's no mention even that he was a soldier is his military title is not them no mention of how he died was it just a car accident sometimes along the side of a highway you see flowers and a little cross in remembrance remembrance of what's you say you want to remember but what are you remembering no one knows if someone were to walk by here they would not understand what's going on if they came to inspect the notes they might have a clue by reading this absolutely heart-rending one I'm gonna try and read it without choking up it says to dad I miss you a lot I love you from Jack is that all we have but look across the street what's this building built between 1776 and 1802 it's almost 250 years old really it's the barracks for British soldiers that's where Lee Rigby was coming from for more than 200 years British soldiers have lived here it's the old artillery you can if you look at the sign there you'll see Royal Arsenal there's tremendous military and patriotic tradition here even the corner store the convenience store it's called the Queen Victoria it probably was operating I mean given history and this place it was probably called that when Queen Victoria herself was the monarch what would she say Queen Victoria if she were around and saw this nondescript disgrace what would the men who built this and who have loyalty manned it for more than two centuries what would the people who started this 200 years ago say about the United Kingdom of 2018 for the rebel dawn media I'm as for lavance if there was ever a proof that the British government was reluctant to recognize Islamic terrorism this is the proof for the rebel media I'm as relevance you
