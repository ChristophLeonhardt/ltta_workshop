he bought the Washington Post to have political influence he wants political influence so that Amazon will benefit from it that's not right and believe me if I become president oh do they have problems they're gonna have such fun welcome back to am joy well Donald Trump is apparently making good on the threat he made to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos back in 2016 according to the Washington Post sighting three people familiar with the conversations Trump has tried on multiple occasions to pressure the u.s. Postmaster General to double the shipping rates on Amazon this year a move that could potentially cost the company billions Trump's beef with Bezos goes way back Trump claims Amazon's low shipping rates come at the expense of the Postal Service but the Postmaster General says Amazon is actually helping the Postal Service accounting for up to a quarter of the revenue from the part of the Postal Service business that falls outside of delivering your daily mail in a short version the delivering your mail part of the Postal Service is seeing its revenue slowly declining while the competitive products part like Express Mail and package delivery you know the stuff Amazon uses is going up so Amazon is not what's hurting the post office perhaps the real problem could be that in addition to Amazon Jeff Bezos also happens to open happens to own a certain publication that frequently gets under Trump's skin by reporting accurate news about him that he likes to tell his supporters his fake namely the Washington Post join me now to discuss Gabe Sherman correspondent at Vanity Fair Tiffany Kraus co-founder and managing editor of the beat DC Michelle Bernard of the Barnard Center for Women politics and public policy and Curt bard Ella president of the media company endeavor strategies thank you all for being here so Gabe Donald Trump according to the Washington Post his friends at the Washington Post personally personally push the Postmaster General to double the rates on Amazon here's a little quote from Ed Brennan who's the Postmaster General and so far resisted Trump's demand explaining on numerous occasions occurring this year that these arrangements are bound by contracts that must be reviewed by regulatory commission that's Brayman Megan Brennan who's the Postmaster General John Dean who's a former Nixon White House Counsel tweeted the following he's at Trump's effort to get the USPS to right hip to hike rates on Amazon because Vagos Bezos owns the Washington Post is Nixon and his worst Nixon had his aides undertake such a dirty work to have deniability regarding such abuse of power Trump panels he's impeachable abuse himself there's so much going on here I mean this post piece confirms what other people had reported and myself included back in April that Trump wanted to go to war with Jeff Bezos this is now the most concrete evidence that he tried to but I find striking is that we see time and again this is a president who has authoritarian instincts but so far in most cases institutions have constrained him in this case the Postmaster General says that Trump couldn't do that but the instinct is there and as the Dean quote points out this is troubling because not it's not the the sort of lower-level people in the White House this is coming from the president when he wants to use the levers of the state to punish his enemies and you have already tifany Donald Trump potentially intervening in the Time Warner merger because he doesn't like CNN he doesn't like the way CNN reports on him threatening companies using his Twitter handle levering their stock price up and down depending on what he says about them we reported last week that you had CEOs scrambling after the election to figure out how to deal with him because they were afraid that he could hurt them from the White House this is not normal American presidential behavior it's not the only thing I find surprising about it is the surprise of everybody I think this is somebody who has consistently used his position of privilege and power to attack his enemies as Gabe said in the 80s when he wanted to expand his own casino empire he attempted to mount a hostile takeover against the two competing casino companies in 2000 he was fined two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for stopping an Indian casino from opening because he thought they would be a competitor it's also worth noting that same year he was fine two hundred thousand dollars for keeping black employees away from a mafioso at least to visit his casino we all know what he did to people who lived in the rent control building he employed every dirty trick he turned off their heat their water took out ads and these newspapers he hate so much to offer newspapers or homeless people rather to live in the building's just to intimidate people who live there so none of this is surprising this is very consistent I think the challenge with home in the Washington Post why he doesn't understand the separation between Jeff Bezos and the news operation is because he's so used to dealing with the National Enquirer then these are people who catch and kill stories to protect their friend Washington Post is not like that they're I would say they're a paper of record I mean it's fine if you think they skew one way or another but you can't argue with the facts and consistently if somebody gives bad press to him he considers it fake news but also at the end of the day Donald Trump is just a hater I mean Jeff Bezos is a successful businessman and Donald Trump you know despite what he says we haven't seen his tax returns we don't know how successful he is and so I think a part of this is just being jealous about Jeff Bezos having this record success that he's experiencing right now and you know Kurt it's one thing you know the in a lot of ways and I've talked a lot of people about this that Donald Trump's presidency is sort of the Donald Trump of New York that New Yorkers got used to dealing with the things that Tiffany is talking about sort of pushing around local officials thinking he can buy off officials to get what he wants you know being part of the group of businessmen who lobby to not have to put sprinklers above the you know 25th floor so that you know lo and behold when there's a fire in the building there were no sprinklers on that floor because he successfully lava these lobby to get his way and taking that to Washington it is interesting to me that the base of the Republican Party which claims to detest New York values remember when Donald ROM defended New York values during the campaign have really accepted these really fundamentally authoritarian kleptocratic ideas which are not typically the way an American president operates but the base of the Republican Party seems to have no problem with this kind of behavior I'd like you to imagine if a Democratic president was declaring war on a major private enterprise that creates countless of jobs contributes to our economy what Republicans in the base would be saying about that about that political person it's amazing to me that Republicans have completely once again flipped on their own orthodoxy and are sitting by and okay with the president clearing open warfare on a private company that creates jobs this is a party that says all the time we're about jobs we're about the economy here is the President of the United States a Republican the leader of their party using his office abusing his office to try to seek retribution against a job creator it defies logic defies the orthodoxy the Republicans have spent the last two decades saying that they stood for and I'm waiting to see where Republicans are going to stand up and finally say hey this is insane because if it's Jeff Bezos and Amazon today it could be anybody else tomorrow yeah well keep waiting there Kirk that's not gonna fight oh I don't think the standing up is gonna happen I think Republicans I made it pretty clear they ain't doing that this is why I'm a Democrat now yeah there you go you know Michelle to that very point let's just go through a little bit of the timeline of Donald Trump or the history of him attacking this is Donald Trump to Sean Hannity his besties in 2016 talking about Amazon Taylor this is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon Amazon is getting away with murder tax wise he's using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed he's getting absolutely away he's worried about me and he I think he said that to somebody was in some article we're not sure Donald Trump pays taxes because we haven't seen his tax returns but it's interesting what he thought okay so then you have in March 29th he tweets I've stated my concerns of Amazon long before the election I'm like others they pay little or no taxes again Donald Trump we're not show pays taxes the state and local governments to use our postal system as a delivery boy they pay for that causing tremendous loss to the US blah blah blah putting thousands retails out of business and then in April 30 goes again the post office is losing billions of dollars the taxpayers are paying for that money because it delivers packages for Amazon for very below cost etc I mean this is a contract that actually benefits the post office because the third or the post offices business that is package delivery Amazon's like a quarter of their business so they don't hurting the post office they're helping keep it afloat but but you know the idea that Donald Trump is potentially would hurt the post office he's president states he took an oath to defend the Constitution and all of the auspices of it both of services is a constitutionally required part of our government well not only would he hurt that potentially hurt the post office but he would hurt the citizens of the United States that would end up reimbursing the government for probably millions of dollars in attorneys fees for all of the lawsuits that would come out of it you know if you think back to bridge gate in New Jersey joy you know one of the things that the Postmaster General has to be thinking about is that when two employees of the state government quote decided to close down lanes in New Jersey as retaliation against the mayor who did not endorse Chris Christie those two people got sentenced to serious prison time for conspiracy to break the law and I just want to quote the one of the assistant US attorneys in that case literally said of the state action there that these are the actions of out of the PlayBook of some dictator of a Banana Republic that's exactly what we're seeing here with Donald Trump you know it's interesting because this is not a Republican principle it is not a conservative principle I would I would you know tell the viewers to look for example at a paper written and published by the Heritage Foundation called the actions against the against the corporation and one of the people that they really found huge fault with for doing exactly what Donald Trump doing is Ralph Nader so we could now put Ralph Nader and Donald Trump under the same umbrella in terms of attacking corporations the Republican Party is supposed to stand for a party that believes in small government this is not small government this is big government it is what the Republicans have always said that are their greatest fear and we've got the greatest threat to the Republican notion of small government sitting at the head of the White House today well I have to go back to curtain deconstructing the administrators feat was what honesty Bannon used to say that what the goal was right the goal was to sort of break government but Donald Trump is using government to try to break individual businesses yeah he's he's using government to wield and settle personal scores and personal agendas which is the exact opposite become party even stands for in the first place the idea that we have a smaller government decentralized government along with less power and less of an ability to do these type of things and again it speaks volumes that while all of this is unfolding the paul ryan and mitch mcconnell's of the world who spent years lambasted barack obama for his quote unquote alleged abuses of executive authority are mute on all of this yeah and Tiffani you cover Capitol Hill there is no sound coming out of the Republican Party as a member of their party the leader of their party attempts to use big big big big government to break individual businesses that he's mad at the silence yet again is deafening but I do have to say Jeff Bezos has done a cut of a brilliant job of skirting Capitol Hill and he's gone directly to the state and local government where he has created all these jobs and talked directly to governor's and talked directly to some of the local of the elected officials there because at some point the way the rest of the panel has pointed out Donald Trump used to have checks and balances and now with the entire US government in his disposal the checks and balances aren't working yet though what the Republicans a republican-controlled Congress clearing the way for him the private sector has still found a way it's a skirt that ridiculous hurdles that they put in his way and talk directly to consumers and directly to lawmakers at the local level which i think is brilliant it just really quickly gave up so sorry one more thing the fact that Donald Trump is trying to say that he cares about letter carriers yeah I mean okay this is what we can call BS on this argument to quote the Parkland students if you're so concerned about the working-class Americans where are you on the educators people who are spending their own money and uber and lyft drivers working 13 hours a day where his silence is deafening on that and where are you on the postal service if the 2.7 billion dollar net loss in fiscal year 2017 65 point 1 billion over the last seven years that's a lot down to federal the Congress by messing with their so they're there at health care and pension system and not allowing the Postal Service to be as profitable as it could be because they don't believe it should be a government service they want to turn it all over to UPS and FedEx so you have this Republican desire to break the post office anyway anyway I want to come back to you on this game because I wonder how media companies are responding to this because you do this is also an attack on the press oh without questioning I think the post is handled this well Marty Baron the editor there has just said we're gonna keep our heads down and doing our job Jeff Bezos the owner of the paper I think has also done a good job of not getting into a back-and-forth I think Donald Trump wants to make this a clash of personalities you know him versus Bezos fundamentally yes Jeff Bezos is in the story Donald Trump is the president of the United States and I think you know it's incumbent on media companies to both stick up for their work but not to get down in the muck and picking you know personal fights going on Twitter engaging with Trump because we need to keep the focus on him not on us as the reporters yeah and so Michele at the same time you know the media is not necessarily all that popular with the public either so it's not as if the media you know can you know sort of cry out for support from the public but it is I think that people maybe don't take seriously enough the threat of authoritarian government and how quickly it can slide because people aren't familiar with this form of government but Donald Trump is really pushing the boundaries about as far as a president ever has absolutely joy I don't know if you're a fan of the television program the handmaidens tale but early on in in that show they start saying there's the the the protagonist of the TV program is sort of amusing to herself like where were we when all this was happening why weren't we paying attention where when you know women's rights were being eroded and that's what's happening here this is just not a story of of what's happening to Jeff Bezos to Amazon the attacks on CNN and the Time Warner merger this is an attack on the fundamentals of our democracy when somebody can go in and use their governess Tate power to decide that they're going to pick losers and winners that is anathema to what the United States stands for America promises all of us equal opportunity and Donald Trump is slowly eroding that yeah absolutely thank you very much to the panel Gabe Sherman Thank You Tiffany
