Trump is calling for the release of classified documents pertaining to the Russia investigation and he wants them to be unredacted so this is crazy and there are members of the FBI who are also saying that this is crazy we'll get to that in just a minute but to give you the details the White House announced that Trump had directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice to provide for the immediate declassification of parts of the FBI's June 2017 application to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter page as well as FBI reports of interviews connected to Paige and DOJ official Bruce or he also asked the FBI and the Justice Department to release without redaction all text messages pertaining to the Russia investigation from former FBI director James Comey former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe former FBI agent Peter struck FBI lawyer Lisa Paige and Bruce or so two relevant parts of this first when I first saw it I thought it was Trump doing strike back oh yeah I'll release these things that'll help me politically whether it actually would is a different question because he of course doesn't know how to assess anything but I thought okay it's classic Trump II and move but I didn't over sweat it but it turns out no it's worse than that it's unredacted so when I read that I was like wait what do you mean US unredacted what if there is a portion where are the head of our FBI is talking about how we got information about the Russians well that's crazy so he's obviously got to be partly redacted know Trump is saying not redacted at all that makes no sense at all and in fact that is why the current FBI director appointed by Trump the current Deputy Attorney General appointed by Trump are saying this might cross a red line because he compromises our sources and our methods what are you doing and then I had the Epiphany what if that's the actual point so it's look it's possible that Trump is just doing this because he thinks those things are gonna help him on the rush investigation and politically and he doesn't understand the consequences of his actions that is entirely possible it's also possible that he in this case he does understand then the Russians will know how we collect intelligence on them for any normal president that would be outrageous in fact if a reporter did that they would probably use the Espionage Act on them and to try to put him in present for a long long time Obama would have done that and Trump would do that yeah but Trump is now saying I'm gonna do it as president which makes you wonder does he does he have another motive does he want the Russians to know our sources and our methods yeah I mean that's a possibility I do think that you know based on who he's targeting in these classified documents he's thinking that this is going to be information that could possibly help him in his attempt to smear the special counsel and the investigation but the timing is also really important remember Paul Manafort just agreed to cooperate with Muller so I feel like Trump is now you know panicking he's been panicking but man afford agreeing to cooperate I think is making him panic even more and the documents that he's specifically looking for would play into he thinks would play into his narrative that this is a witch-hunt no no there's something wrong with this story so if he was just releasing memos of Peter struck the guy that they hate that said in the text messages to Lisa page hey you know I don't want Donald Trump to win etcetera and or memos written by at least a page but he said yeah you can redact the other stuff I say okay I get it I don't agree but that's he's doing it to help himself but why are you insisting that all of the documents including from an FBI director are completely unredacted what a bizarre request but by the way Devon Nunez and and and other Republicans were like yes oh well of course sir you'd like to compromise national security according to even your own Justice Department well let's go help you do that I mean just think about how vicious they would have been to any whistleblower or journalists who exposed the same things and now the just threatening to do it himself it's it's an absolute outrage yeah so according to reports a source who's familiar with this situation feels that it's possible that the White House could release the information on its own as early as next week on Monday so I look I do I wouldn't put that past Trump so look that I I'm I'm a person who's not overly trustful of the authorities so I don't take FBI's word of just Department's word CIA's word as gospel as a lot of people in the media do and I would question if they were trying to put away a whistleblower or a reporter and I would say well okay what do they actually reveal for example Chelsea Manning revealed one of the things she revealed was that we were killing journalists and then first responders who tried to rescue the journalists and an Apache helicopter video in Iraq well that's very relevant information that American people should know and then we were hiding from them the government was hiding from their own people in a democracy we also hid the actual number of people killed in Iraq so the super relevant information I know it embarrasses the government but it doesn't actually reveal any strategy that we have it doesn't say hey is searches in Iraq here's the routes that we're using go attack our soldiers there if they she did that I would be outraged there's a difference in what you reveal so even if he's doing this for political purposes I don't agree with but he releases some stupid texts that are about Donald Trump I don't really care that much you can disagree about that but as a political disagreement but if he goes and I mean these guys are going it's a red line it's a red line don't cross that line you're gonna tell are the Russians exactly how we collect information and who we collect it from and he said yeah what do you mean it's a win-win for me now he's a guy I can't people look at that and go I don't know any connection the rush I don't know what you're talking about wit yeah it's frustrating it is like what you see click the subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
