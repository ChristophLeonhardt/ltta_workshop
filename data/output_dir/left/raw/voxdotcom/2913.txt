1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,810
“Good afternoon”

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,770
We might be watching the death of the White House press briefing.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,590
Or at least, its credibility.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,820
This week, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee scrambled to explain why Trump

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,500
fired FBI director James Comey -- who was in the middle of overseeing multiple investigations

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
into the Trump White House’s ties to Russia.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,859
“The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey.”

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,929
The official White House explanation was – and bear with me – that Trump fired Comey after

9
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,300
hearing from the Deputy Attorney General who raised concerns about Comey’s handling of

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,270
the Clinton emails during the campaign.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,270
Got it?

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,270
No?

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,200
It’s okay, this whole story is a complete
s***show.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,130
Reporters were super skeptical of the White
House’s explanation because it made no sense.

15
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,990
Trump repeatedly praised Comey’s handling
of Clinton’s emails during the campaign.

16
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,240
“I have great respect for the FBI for righting
this wrong.”

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,140
And he’s been president since January.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,960
Why would he wait three months to fire Comey – in the middle of an investigation?

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
“What changed?”

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,070
But Huckabee was adamant:

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,890
“Isn’t it true that the President had
already decided to fire James Comey, and he

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,679
asked the Justice Department to put together
the rationale for that firing?

23
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:12,679
“No.”

24
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:16,280
She stood in front of reporters and insisted
Trump fired Comey because of how he handled

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,990
Clinton’s emails.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,069
“The basic… uh, atrocities, in circumventing
the chain of command in the Department of

27
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,069
Justice.”

28
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,460
And he was only doing it now because he was convinced by the Deputy Attorney General.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,149
“I think that was the final catalyst.”

30
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,649
And then, Trump ruined everything.

31
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,649
“What I did is – I was going to fire Comey.

32
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:38,649
My decision.”

33
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,659
Holt, NBC News: “You had made the decision before they came in the room.”

34
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,249
“I was going to fire Comey.”

35
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:46,659
And he fired him because he wasn’t happy
with the FBI’s investigation into his Russia

36
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,659
ties.

37
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,200
“When I decided to just – I said to myself,
you know,

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,569
this Russia thing with Trump and Russia
is a made up story, it’s an excuse for Democrats

39
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,299
for having lost an election that they should have won.”

40
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,969
The whole saga reveals a basic problem with Trump spokespeople like Huckabee, Kellyanne

41
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,550
Conway and Sean Spicer -- they don’t actually speak for the president.

42
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,720
Conway says Trump has confidence in Michael Flynn:

43
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,870
“Yes, General Flynn does enjoy the full
confidence of the president.”

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,010
Trump asks for his resignation.

45
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,970
Spicer says Trump has confidence in Comey:

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,350
“The president has confidence in the director.”

47
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,900
Trump says he’s wanted to fire him for a
while:

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,970
“There’s no good time to do it, by the
way.”

49
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,950
This is all really unusual -- the whole point
of having a White House press shop is that

50
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,650
these spokespeople are expected to accurately reflect the views of the president.

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,930
But Huckabee admitted she didn’t even talk to Trump before speaking on his behalf about

52
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,720
Comey.

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,370
Even Trump admits reporters shouldn’t trust his spokespeople.

54
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,189
The day after his NBC interview he tweeted that we should cancel the White House press

55
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,189
briefing

56
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,010
and that no one should expect his spokespeople to be perfectly accurate because he’s very

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,010
busy.

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,069
And he’s not wrong – there is no credible White House press shop anymore.

59
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,750
The only person who speaks for Trump is Trump.

60
00:02:59,750 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything else is damage control.
