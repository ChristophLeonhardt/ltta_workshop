1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:02,408
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

2
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:03,009
ADMINISTRATION BUT TRUMP

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:04,310
SUPPORTERS AS WELL AS WE

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,646
REVEALED IN THIS TEXT MESSAGES.

5
00:00:06,646 --> 00:00:09,082
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE

6
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:09,682
PROGRAM.

7
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:11,351
THE BAD NEWS FOR THE FBI DOES

8
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,119
NOT END THERE.

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,320
THE AGENCY WAS ARRESTED BY

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,923
LAWMAKERS, AND AT TIMES BY THE

11
00:00:16,923 --> 00:00:19,325
DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DURING A

12
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:20,126
FIERY SENATE HEARING EARLIER

13
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:20,426
TODAY.

14
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:22,295
>> THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM

15
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:25,498
WITH THE CULTURE AT FBI

16
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:25,932
HEADQUARTERS.

17
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:28,668
>> IT JUST SEEMED TO BE A

18
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:30,770
CULTURE OF IMPUNITY, WHERE THE

19
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,905
RULES DID NOT APPLY.

20
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:34,807
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

21
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:35,408
HAPPENED TO MY FBI.

22
00:00:35,408 --> 00:00:36,843
>> I CAN'T THINK OF SOMETHING

23
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:41,781
MORE CONCERNING WHEN A

24
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,484
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

25
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:47,120
SUGGESTING OR THEY WERE GOING TO

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,321
USE THEIR POWERS TO AFFECT AN

27
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:50,490
ELECTION.

28
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:58,898
>> JOHN SUMMERS, COMMUNICATION

29
00:00:58,898 --> 00:00:59,899
DIRECTORS FOR

30
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,700
SENATOR HARRY REID.

31
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,701
BYRON, YOU AND I HAVE SPOKEN A

32
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,336
LOT LEADING UP TO THAT HEARING

33
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:04,804
TODAY, WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT

34
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:07,707
CULTURE OF THE FBI?

35
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,942
>> NOW YOU HAD REPUBLICANS

36
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:16,649
MAKING THEIR CASE THAT AND THAT

37
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:19,118
YOU ARE DISCUSSING THAT WITH

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:20,320
CONGRESSMAN RADCLIFFE.

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,088
CLINGING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT

40
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,690
MICHAEL HOROWITZ DID SAY THAT HE

41
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,391
DID NOT SEE ANY DOCUMENTARY OR

42
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,726
TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE OF BIAS IN

43
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:30,330
THE SPECIFIC DECISION, WHETHER

44
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,899
OR NOT TO PROSECUTE

45
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,534
HILLARY CLINTON.

46
00:01:34,534 --> 00:01:36,135
BUT BASICALLY, HOROWITZ DID SAY

47
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,904
THERE WERE TONS OF TONS OF BIAS

48
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:41,140
HERE AND REPUBLICANS TOOK IT

49
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,541
FROM THERE.

50
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,110
>> Sandra: JOHN, THIS IS THE

51
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,377
FBI.

52
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:45,311
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOOK ON FROM

53
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,447
THIS AND IF THEY WANT TO HAVE

54
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:49,115
FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE FBI.

55
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:50,783
THAT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED TO

56
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:52,185
COME UP WILL IT?

57
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,120
>> I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

58
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,154
FIRST WE HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT

59
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:56,990
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, IT'S A

60
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,158
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE NOT THE ENTIRE

61
00:01:59,158 --> 00:02:00,960
AGENCY OF 37000.

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,028
IT'S SAD TO SEE THIS DEPARTMENT

63
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,763
HAVING THE BABY THROWN OUT WITH

64
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,999
THE BATHWATER ON THIS ONE

65
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,567
BECAUSE, AS BYRON JUST SAID,

66
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,368
MOST PEOPLE ARE HARDWORKING

67
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:10,336
PEOPLE WHO WORK TO KEEP THE

68
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:11,204
AMERICAN PEOPLE SAFE.

69
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:13,273
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD

70
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:20,613
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLISH

71
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:20,647
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLISE

72
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:20,880
CONSIDER THE FBI A   AND ABOLIST

73
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,314
OF LIBERALISM.

74
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,516
IN FACT IF YOU ASK ANYONE AROUND

75
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:25,318
WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR, THEY

76
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:26,519
WILL TELL YOU IT'S TRUMP.

77
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:27,787
SO WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A

78
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,722
CULTURE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE

79
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:30,523
INVESTIGATED, THAT'S NOT

80
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:32,125
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE APPLIED

81
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,326
TO THE ENTIRE FBI.

82
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:34,627
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT CAME

83
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:36,963
OUT OF THIS HEARING, IT IS THAT

84
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:38,331
THERE WAS NO DEEP STATE

85
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,967
CONSPIRACY ORTH PLOT AGAINST THE

86
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,101
PRESIDENT OR HIS CAMPAIGN.

87
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,904
AND I'M SORRY THAT REPUBLICANS

88
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:46,906
DON'T LIKE IT.

89
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:47,907
BUT CONCLUSIONS DO MATTER.

90
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:50,610
IF WE ARE GOING TO TRUST THE

91
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,111
INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO IS

92
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,279
SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS NONBIASED

93
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:55,648
APPROACH, THEN WHO DO WE TRUST?

94
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:57,617
>> Sandra: I WANT TO GET BYRON

95
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,484
TO RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I

96
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,953
KNOW WHEN I SPOKE TO YOU

97
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,121
EARLIER.

98
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:02,955
EARLIER, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

99
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:06,225
PETER STRZOK AND WHETHER OR NOT

100
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:09,362
HE WAS OFFICIALLY GOING TO

101
00:03:09,362 --> 00:03:09,962
TESTIFY.

102
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,130
NOW NOT ONLY TO SEE PETER STRZOK

103
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,566
UP THERE AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS

104
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:14,934
TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, BUT

105
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:15,968
FINALLY HEAR THE STORIES.

106
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:19,972
I MEAN THIS COULD BE VERY

107
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:20,573
REVEALING TESTIMONY.

108
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:21,574
>> EXACTLY.

109
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,609
FIRST ON THE ISSUE OF IT BEING A

110
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,612
HANDFUL TO THE PEOPLE IN

111
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:28,114
EVOLVED, MAYBE THERE WAS A

112
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:28,748
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BUT

113
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:30,383
UNFORTUNATELY THEY INCLUDED THE

114
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,518
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI, AND THAT

115
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:36,622
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDT

116
00:03:36,622 --> 00:03:36,656
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDE

117
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:36,689
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDL

118
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:36,723
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDA

119
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:38,758
THE DIRECTOR OF THE     FBI ANDD

120
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:39,959
INVESTIGATOR.

121
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,695
VERY IMPORTANT HANDFUL.

122
00:03:42,695 --> 00:03:43,996
NOW LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN TRYING

123
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:46,099
FOR MONTHS TO GET THIS TO

124
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:46,432
HAPPEN.

125
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,668
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT

126
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:52,839
MORE THAN JUST BIASED QUESTIONS

127
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:55,108
ABOUT PETER STRZOK.

128
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:58,678
REMEMBER, HE ACTUALLY LED THE

129
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,779
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WHEN

130
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:03,049
IT WAS IN JULY OF 2016 ALL THE

131
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,420
WAY THROUGH MAY 2017, WHEN HE

132
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:14,260
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION

133
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,293
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION M

134
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:14,327
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION E

135
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:14,360
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION L

136
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,927
JOINED THE MOLAR INVESTIGATION R

137
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:15,728
INVESTIGATION.

138
00:04:15,728 --> 00:04:17,497
SOME LAWMAKERS WILL SAY, WE KNOW

139
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,065
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE TRUMP.

140
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:20,733
HOW DID THIS INVESTIGATIONS

141
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,534
START?

142
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:26,105
TRIAL, I CAN TELL ABOUT GEORGE

143
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,106
PAPADOPOULOS.

144
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:29,375
TELL US ABOUT THE TRUMP EMPLOYEE

145
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:29,942
SEEKING INFORMATION.

146
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:33,112
TELL US ABOUT SEEKING

147
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:33,713
INFORMANTS.

148
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:36,949
THERE'S A LOT THAT LAWMAKERS

149
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,785
WANT TO KNOW THEM.

150
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:39,919
>> Sandra: HIS LAWYER SAID HE

151
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,421
IS WILLING TO TESTIFY, HE WILL

152
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,122
NOT PLEAD THE FIFTH.

153
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:44,524
DO YOU EXPECT HIS FINAL WORD TO

154
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:48,694
YOU, JOHN COME TO BE REVEALING?

155
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,363
>> I HOPE THE ONE OF THE FIRST

156
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:51,564
THINGS HE DOES WHEN HE GETS UP

157
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,366
THERE IS PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION

158
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,500
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND AN

159
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,469
APOLOGY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE

160
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:58,604
ABOUT CRACK CASTING THE SHADOW

161
00:04:58,604 --> 00:04:59,572
ON THE FBI.

162
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,607
THE REALITY IS, YOU CAN TALK

163
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:05,478
ABOUT BIAS AND WHAT LED UP TO

164
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:16,222
THE INVESTIGATION STARTING, AND,

165
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:17,924
YOU HAVE TO TRUST THAT HE'S

166
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:18,491
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

167
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:21,527
AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVIDENCE

168
00:05:21,527 --> 00:05:21,861
MATTERS.

169
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:24,130
LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT

170
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,031
THAT 13 RUSSIANS WERE INDICTED

171
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,567
AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS SO

172
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:28,768
THIS INVESTIGATION MATTERS, IT'S

173
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:30,770
IMPORTANT AND WE SHOULD LET IT

174
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,170
GO ON.

175
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,473
>> I THINK THAT EVIDENCE IS WHAT

176
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:34,173
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TALKED

177
00:05:34,173 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT TODAY.
