00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks a long time one cable this</font>

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,710
is last month's bill from time warner

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,309
cable 171 dollars and two cents I didn't

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">even order any movies on demand I'm</font>

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,670
tempted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut the cord but I've heard</font>

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get your monthly bill</font>

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,219
reduced just by calling and threatening

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,130
to cancel service in 2013 time warner

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,550
cable lost 850,000 cable TV subscribers

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,130
the company employs retention specialist

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,410
whose job it is to retain customers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,400
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one on the phone hi I'm</font>

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,949
calling about my cable bill it's getting

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,200
too expensive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking about</font>

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">canceling Time Warner altogether that</font>

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,039
sounds great sir well that was pretty

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy all I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was suggest that I might</font>

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,000
cancel my cable subscription in 20

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,410
minutes later I got twenty dollars

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,600
knocked off my monthly bill and faster

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,550
internet but this is America<font color="#E5E5E5"> after all</font>

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,230
so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if I</font>

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,059
could get even more shaved off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill</font>

24
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:06,689
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about canceling because</font>

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,409
it's too high but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work the</font>

26
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,000
representative I spoke to reference my

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,799
previous call and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get</font>

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,930
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> additional discounts or services but</font>

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,549
I did learn something about how Time

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,409
Warner Cable sets its prices our

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,600
packages majority of them are customized

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
what one customer has may not be

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,100
available in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same bundle package at</font>

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,110
what another customer has because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,759
depends on what is available for the

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,009
representative to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to customize</font>

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for you in other words everything is</font>

38
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,119
negotiable the FCC<font color="#CCCCCC"> is aware of this</font>

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,100
practice but doesn't regulate it I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

40
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,689
time warner cable to explain their

41
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,310
retention policy but they wouldn't go

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,990
into too much detail for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call</font>

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,750
competitive reasons bottom line is if

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,369
you spend 20 minutes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone you</font>

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably knock a few hundred bucks</font>

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,790
off your yearly cable bill and now I've

47
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,890
got 20 extra dollars a month I can spend

48
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,750
on movies on demand from time warner

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:00:00,000
