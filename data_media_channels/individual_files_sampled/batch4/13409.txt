witches will be gathering in Brooklyn New York this weekend to attempt to cast a spell on Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh I could not possibly have made that up the witches will gather at catland books which says it is Brooklyn's premier occult bookshop and spiritual community space so if you find yourself in one of Brooklyn's lesser occult book shops and spiritual community spaces then you've come to the wrong spiritual community space the invitation on catlins Facebook page reads quote and this is a real quote please join us for a public hex on Brett Kavanaugh upon all rapists and the patriarchy at large which emboldened rewards and protects them Kavanagh will be the focal point but by no means the only target so bring your rage and all of the axes you've got to grind unquote now clearly witches casting spells on a conservative justice is very politically appropriate since nothing says leftism like bizarre superstition mixed with rage and hideous looking green skinned women with warty noses grinding their axes in fact I think the actual dictionary definition of leftism might be superstition rage and hideous looking women grinding axes according to the invitation the hexing will feature a ceremony in which Nancy Pelosi and two other hideous Crone's dance around a boiling brew in a huge black kettle singing double double we're in trouble Obama's policies or rubble I of Newt and toe of mich I can't think of a rhyme for mich that fits Pelosi so I'll leave it there anyway the invitation says they'll also be a second ritual afterward called again this is real the rights of the scorned one so I guess Hillary Clinton will be on hand as well the witches say they're hoping a ceremony of malevolent females and toning useless nonsense and service to the evil one will attract everyone who still believes in the Democrat Party namely malevolent females and toning useless nonsense in service to the evil one trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this

smarter way to hire do not let what happens here happened to you alright you know one of the things that I've been just fascinated by in the trumpet I'm always I'm always fascinated by the press obviously I'm always fascinated by the media because I'm a storyteller and I'm watching them tell stories and I'm watching the way those stories do set the agenda for what we're talking about and one of the things that's been so fascinating about Donald Trump is that he manipulates the media he under because he's a media guy he manipulates them so expertly not always in ways that I like but he forces them to cover the things that they would bury so you know they made fun of him for attacking or making fun of Kristine Ford but he spent out there and talked about the fact that she didn't remember things very conveniently and remembered things conveniently and they said he's mocking her but in order to attack him they also had to report what was true was that she didn't remember a lot of details that would have been able would have made the story possible to check but she did remember a lot of details that condemn Brett Kavanaugh so it was kind of suspicious and he brought that he forced them to cover that yesterday or the day before when he called stormy Daniels horse face he forced them to cover the fact that he had won the lawsuit Michael avenatti for all his big talk and all his swaggering around and all CNN made him a big you know made him a big hero he's not he's obviously not very good at what he does you know he actually put her in a situation where she was humiliated and he by being Rooter just forced them to do that because they hate him so much you can actually watch the news process go wrong this is the thing that fascinates me you can actually watch the news you know how they say you don't like to see the sausage being made you can actually watch the news go into the grinder and come out crap you know like you see act like you know this this Jamal khashoggi thing is so interesting it's interesting because it's a developing story it's interesting because it's an interesting story interesting why because we have so many ties to Saudi Arabia the area is such a you know I a hotbed of violence and and there's nobody there except Israel that we can turn to who's a good you know they always say why did you back this evil strongman in the Middle East it's like cuz Lincoln wasn't there you know I mean we do what we can do you know and so we have this very complex relationship with the Saudi a lot of money involved weapons sales oil all this stuff and now they've done something they've got this new Crown Prince MBS they call him Mohammed bin Salman and and and he's obviously not very good at being a an evil dictator you know he's an evil dictator but he's just not very good at it he keeps making these stupid evil dictator mistake he I don't think he probably didn't finish evil dictator school you know I think he probably got through maybe a year of evil dictator schooling thing thought I have this you know when you're a crown prince who's gonna say to you know my friend you do not you do not yet know how to be an evil no no I finished you know the first year of evil yeah you want a few more years of evil dictator he's just not very good at it you know he just kept and keeps bumbling around kidnapping and killing people and making the country look ridiculous and of course we are very gullible so like he lets women drive when we go oh he's a reformer you know not noticing like the 17 journalists who suddenly vanished from different countries as he carries them away so the New York Times a former newspaper runs a story today and I a lot of people are running the story a Turkish official says he's got an audio tape of Khashoggi being killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by the evil Saudi Arabian hit gang that was supposed to have arrived there now you'll notice no one I don't believe at least as of the last time I was looking that which is a few minutes ago nobody has heard this audiotape and that we have every reason not to trust the Turks in this situation they don't like that they have plenty of motives to get between us and the Saudis they themselves are you know vying for power in the region but it's a good story it's a good story you want to put it for what's interesting about the times as they write it as if they had heard the audio they they say they tell you that they haven't but they write it as if the story is true as Saudi agents were waiting when Jamal khashoggi walked into their country's consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago mr. Khashoggi was dead within minutes beheaded dismembered his fingers severed and within two hours that killers were gone according to details from audio recordings and then like a Henry James ends where you only get to the sense of it at the end described by a senior Turkish official on Wednesday okay so this is still the Turks telling us what's going on is not somebody hearing it the government of Turkey let out these and other leaks about the recordings on Wednesday a Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Ankara and an escalation of pressure on both Saudi Arabia and the United States for answers now here's the interesting thing about this The Times is actually doing the right thing part of the journalists job in a situation like this is to bring the pressure why because doing the moral right thing is always it kind of always works against real politic what is real politic want us to do it wants us to work with the Saudis get the money get the ally against Iran get somebody who can work with the Israelis behind the scenes all that is good stuff and we don't want to lose that because this crown prince is a drop out of evil dictator school we do not want to lose all those things so it's complex it's an interesting complex story the role of the press in this in this story is to bring pressure on the government to do something to make sure they do something because it would be easy for the government to pass to pass it let it pass by morality always comes in second place you know I mean oh wait the I was talking I was on a did an interview in Chicago today on you know in Chicago radio and I was talking about a Hollywood and how I never really cared about losing Hollywood work because of the things I said because I'm a writer and the things I say or what I do I wake up what makes me wake up in the morning he's looking to see get as close to the truth as I can and then communicate it in ways that will mean something to people so when Hollywood said yeah if you do that we're not gonna hire you anymore my feeling is that don't hire me anymore you know I then didn't make me a martyr make me a writer make me do the thing that I do but but when I had little kids at home I picked my fights I mean I was still a loudmouth I mean I was still somebody would say the thing I probably shouldn't have said and I would risk money and I gave up jobs and I did all that stuff and I tried to be a moral guy but but when you have kids you play the little careful more careful right you don't want those kids to go hungry because they are everything to you and they're your responsibility when it's just me and my wife if my you know my wife starves like you no no I mean you know it's different when you don't have kids so when you have when you are dealing with the world and you wanted politics to go right and morality gets in the way you got to play it you know not immoral but you've got to play it cautiously you got to balance everything because it's not moral for us to let the Middle East explode because crown prince MBs dropped out of an evil dictator school it's just not you know so Trump is doing the right thing - he's waiting Pompeo is coming back he's gonna talk to Pompeo today he says by the end of the week he thinks he'll know what went on but he's still playing it very cool so here he is this cut number five talking about the situation with khashoggi a very important ally of ours in the Middle East and we are stopping Iran we're not trying to stop we're stopping Iran we want a big step where we took away that ridiculous deal that was made by the previous administration the Iran deal which was 150 billion dollars a 1.8 billion in cash what was that all about and they are an ally we have other very good allies in the Middle East but if you look at Saudi Arabia they're an ally and there were tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment but other things when I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of military those are the biggest orders in the history of this country probably the history of the world I don't think there's ever been any order of four hundred and fifty billion dollars and you remember that day in Saudi Arabia where that commitment was made so they're an important ally but I want to find out what happened where is the fault and we will probably know that by the end of the week but Mike Pompeo is coming back and have a long talk so so that's Trump Trump is actually being the grown-up in the room Trump is not always the grown-up in the room he's been but in his trumpian way he's being the grown-up in the room it is the job of the New York Times and I'm here I'm giving credit to the New York Times a former newspaper the newspaper that I think has really become leftist trash but that is doing the right thing bring the pressure make sure the government knows that we expect them to do the moral thing there's Donald Trump doing the right thing saying what he's supposed to say that wait wait this is a complicated situation we got a lot of stuff going on let's get get the facts first we're not gonna do the Brett Kavanaugh and just you say people are guilty because somebody accuses them we know there's a lot of mystery and deception going on in the Middle East let's wait so two folks doing the right thing who else is doing the right thing I think the Senators are doing the right thing I think when Lindsey Graham came out and said this will not stand I'm not gonna deal with these people I think he was doing the right thing Marco Rubio talking about it - he's just making sure that they know that the government because the government is not just Trump the government is the legislature as well making sure that they know here's so here's Rubio doing the right thing luring someone into a consulate where they're thereby murdered dismembered and disposed of is a big deal and by the way this happens to be a green card holder of the United States and who have been a journalist but he could have been you know a maintenance worker and at the Washington Post it wouldn't have mattered it's a human being who's life was taken by a direct act of a foreign government by luring them into a diplomatic facility in a third country I mean any one of those factors is bad put them all together and it's catastrophic and as far as arms sales are concerned it's not the money you know there are other countries we could sell that to import so it's just not the money the arms sales does give us leverage over a country when they have our weapons systems they need our maintenance they need our replacement equipment and the like and it gives us leverage over their behavior you know that's why we're talking about arms sales now because it's leverage but they'll buy those weapons from someone else but I don't know I don't care how much money it is there isn't enough money in the world to purchase back our credibility on human rights and and the way nations should conduct themselves and we lose our credibility in our moral standing to criticize Putin for murdering people Assad for murdering people Maduro and Venezuela for murdering people we can't say anything about that if we allow Saudi Arabia to do it and all we do is a diplomatic slap on the wrist Marco Rubio do you know I talk so much about the lies and the dishonesty and the leftism and the bias of the press the idiot bias of the press I just wanted to point out that this is the way things should work all right Trump should be the grown-up in the room Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham should bring some pressure then New York Times should bring some pressure this is the way things should work this is how we this is the negotiation in in motion this is the way we get to a place we're finally in the end we say well this is how we're gonna punish Saudi Arabia but this is how we're not gonna blow up the relationship altogether that's where we're trying that's what we're trying to get to everybody's got to play as part now let's watch this turn to garbage because of our media okay let's watch that's that's how it should work and that's how does work a little bit and now let's watch a turn to garbage first of all we have the detectives of the press the Sherlock Holmes you know of the press they found the murderer of Donal of Jamaal khashoggi they have found out who did is responsible for this crime there's a cut number 10 we've got a president that has already named journalists as being the enemy of the people so don't be surprised from other countries take on a journalist murder lamb chop him into pieces and dispose of did Donald Trump who has always been critic The Washington Post always been critical of his ownership did anybody in the administration - Jared Kushner did they give MBS sort of not in a wing to say it's okay the president expressing concern that Jamaal khashoggi is a is a reporter he's a columnist really and a critic of the Saudi government that stands in contrast with a message that the president has frequently sent to the American people and to his supporters that the media are the enemy of the people how do you square those two I wonder if you look at what's happened in the last 12 days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric not just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with this anything at all brian Stelter and Joe Scarborough and the rest of it they should put their heads in a bucket just to wash the crap out of their brains okay because this is like you know put your petty bias if you want to sit around a dinner and say it's all Trump's fault but don't go on TV don't go in front of a camera and take your petty stupid biased point of view and blame some the american president for killing a man which is essentially what they did that's that is the news turning to crap you saw what it should look like when it works right there's nothing wrong with taking a stand and saying something must be done there's nothing wrong with bringing pressure that's what the press should do it should bring moral pressure on the government because the government wants to act always in terms of realpolitik but the pressure should be there is a moral voice it didn't do this Donald Trump thing you know they keep saying well all he cares about is the monies now all he cares about you know he didn't do this he didn't kill anybody the they are the enemy of the people because they do this garbage this you know this is an actual serious situation a delicate you know foreign policy incident a an international incident and it has to be dealt with unbelievable and then just to make sure just to make sure that they hadn't quite destroyed every vestige of responsibility every vestige of like trust we a would ever have in them they have to make it about their little their little game that they play identity politics it has to be about race so Jason Johnson is on MSNBC and I don't usually pick on MSNBC because I know they're just leftist clowns and then they denounce it it's not like they lie about it like the New York Times but you just have to listen to this cut for he basically said I don't care it was a brown journalist he's not an American and I'm perfectly happy with our relationship with Turkey and I'm perfectly happy with our relationship with Saudi Arabia you think I just want to be clear about what you're saying you think it might have been different if it was a different person oh yes yes I think there is a possibility look I'm not going to name any particular news networks but I suspect that if this was someone who was a an American who was born here of a different color and perhaps representing a news outlet that the president was more happy with he may have a very different opinion about how serious this is and whether or not Saudi Arabia should be held accountable you know when I hear this when I hear that he doesn't care that Trump doesn't care about this guy cause he's brown a brown journalist which he barely is the words that come to mind are the immortal words of Chris Cuomo you are not a banana the worst insult that Chris can throw you you are not a banana you know this is the way you get guys like there is a video going around you may have seen it because it's practically gone viral a video going around of this guy tearing up signs in Texas for Ted Cruz like what makes this guy think that his point of view is so precious that he has the right to commit these acts of vandalism but he's tearing up signs and the guy who put the signs there goes after him with the video cam and gets him on tape and this is how you get this guy it's this constant barrage of bias and stupidity twisting every story to their left-wing purposes every single story creating this cloud this atmosphere is something is terribly wrong when nothing is wrong except in Saudi Arabia here look at this video of this guy tearing up the Ted Cruz signs and being challenged by the guy who put them there a hundred of these um but more out well I'll feel better about it's The Exorcist thing I've been possessed by the spirit of CNN or they're gonna bring in a priest and they're gonna do a service over him and Don Lemon is gonna spew out of his mouth it's great green slime of Don Lemon I mean this is well how you get these guys this is how you get these guys who are screaming at people in the street or vandalizing buildings this is how you get these college students who think their rage is the same thing as righteousness you know this is how you get you get them I mean really I really feel like you know I I can't remember who it was who play the X or the priest and the Exorcist but it you know they should just bring him in and just like see if like he just vomits up Chris Cuomo he just vomits up MSNBC unbelievable unbelievable and the only thing I can tell you is the only thing that really struck me is they have kept such watch over the culture to make sure that they can do this you know how remember how they they canceled Last Man Standing the Tim Allen show because he plays a conservative in the show and they finally they brought it back because audiences were angry about it it has just come back and it's doing great in the ratings it is doing great in the ratings and you know what's doing badly in the ratings the connors the show that they revamped after they fired Roseanne Barr which I really feel they never should have done that they never should have done it everything they do is to protect this voice that they have this power that they have to set the narrative to make it seem as if you know everything is about Trump the Trump is going over and killing journalists because they're brown I mean that was basically the story that you were hearing from all those people BAE you know Trump is letting journalists die because they're not the same color you know it's like what what on earth what on earth and that's how you get these crazy guys and you wonder like why is everybody angry it's it's not because of the politics it's really not things are going really well in this country we keep hearing there's a crisis in this country crisis of insanity induced insanity because these guys have control of the narrative and they will not share they will not let it go they're pulling down Facebook pages like crazy and conservative they knocked they knocked my friend gay patriot Twitter well meanwhile louis farrakhan is calling jews termites on twitter not a word absolute silence from the Twitter folks about this why because those frakkin isn't it he's a right winger that's why they're just there in the run-up in the run-up to the midterms they are just trying to silence conservatives they are so desperate to hold on to this narrative and they don't understand or maybe they do and they don't care they don't understand that this is what's causing the division if you let people talk they will talk it out if you let people say that what they want to say we will fuck we Americans

leftist tears tumblr which God willing you're gonna need as the midterms come closer alright let us talk about Eric Metaxas he is a great guy and one of the truly entertaining thoughtful people in the world he's a New York Times number-one best-selling author for his biography of Martin Luther for and of Bonhoeffer which I thought was a terrific book a really good book he hosts the Eric Metaxas show which is nationally syndicated and his new book is Donald drains the swamp which is a kids book which we'll talk about about guess who draining the swamp pretty hilarious here is Eric Metaxas Eric Metaxas is good to see you thank you for coming on it's good to see you like this technology is scary to me some believe it's amazing Mel you almost smell you really a lot of lot of people say that I don't know what that it so so you are now you have gone from writing your your best-selling books for adults you're now trying to poison the minds of little children by by teaching them about Donald Trump what on earth would cause you to sink to that level well a lot of things could cause me to sink to that level but I will tell you specifically what caused me to sink to that level specifically first of all it's it's an interesting being ID have you shown the book has the audience seen the book or should I hold up my copy so they know we won't we will through the magic of Technology we will have the book show no the reason I ask because when you look at it of course it looks like a children's book but I didn't conceive of it as a children's book I conceived of it as a humor book for adults some people know that I joke around written humor even when I was back at Yale I was the editor of the humor magazine I've written humor for the New York Times and whatever but now the whole magazine the whole paper is humor so I no longer write humor for them but I said I want to write something that celebrates this president in a fun way and they kind of you know poke some fun at the swamp and the bipartisan members of the swamp and I I thought of this kind of fable and I said wouldn't it be fun to do a humor book that's like a children's book the problem Andrew is that the humor is so sweet it's not mean political humor that it works also as a children's book so lots of people are buying the book for their kids and really it works as a children's book it's a cute book about a caveman named Donald who goes up against the swamp creatures and drains this well it's it's very cute so adults will find the humor in it because there's a lot of adult kind of humor but at the same time it's it's sweet it's not meant to be mean that you you were in an early Donald adapt adopter you really sort of saw what was coming pretty pretty early am I right about that well I would say the genuine answer to that would have to be yes and no because there were people who saw it far earlier than I did I'm a New Yorker so I have mixed feelings in other words I I have been in a world that's it's like we know Trump we know how he thinks and I thought of him as a Vulgarian as somebody who when it came the culture he did he bothered me - something about the way he came across and things but during the primaries a friend of mine the guy who actually is my co-author on this wonderful book and he's the illustrator of the book Tim Raglan I was talking to him on the phone we're old friends and he said Eric you're missing it this guy's a folk hero and I said what do you mean any stressing have you seen these rallies watch him he's a folk hero there's nobody like him so I started watching him and I thought to myself you know what I'm buying what this guy's selling this guy's hilarious he's unbelievably funny he connects with it with the common man like no one I've ever seen and what he says actually makes sense frankly I was shocked and I was I sort of fell in love with him I actually I mean if you can believe it I wrote a humor piece for The New Yorker kind of making fun of Trump right and they published it was called a few more Trump Bible verses kind of making fun of his biblical illiteracy I remember the idea I but in the course of making fun and writing in the voice of Trump I I found myself having an affection for him and I sort of said this is really this is a folk hero my friend is right so I pretty quickly I mean depending on when people jumped in but it was still in the primaries I wasn't able to announce it um you know publicly I have a radio program I have a lot of people that might disagree but I said when he finally won the nomination I'm gonna have to you know go with him because obviously the the antithesis are the antithesis his enemy his opponent is uh you know Hillary Clinton I don't think we have much of a choice but I was astounded how many people still said I will never vote for him and I thought I don't think you understand there's actually not a third candidate and and I kept thinking am I missing something is there three is Ross Perot running what did I miss Donna Anderson who's who's running and the fact of the matter is to this day there are people who they seem not to like Hillary but they would never pull the lever for Donnell and I look I think at the end of the day those people are wrong but I try to be friendly about it because there's so much bitterness and the reason I wrote this because I frankly thought we need humor we need to have some fun you can even give this book to your liberal friends to kind of tweak them in a way that's not nasty it's not a nasty book it's meant to be yeah I don't think I don't think actually non nasty political humor is is legal anymore I think that that you may may find the police at your door so you know you're you've been a powerful Christian voice and I'm gonna talk about that more in a minute but one of the attacks that we hear from the nevertrump pers has been how can Christians support this man who is clearly not himself a Christian and has you know lived a life that is not what we would call Christian life what's your response to that well there's a hundred responses to that first of all let's say that you agree with that right well then how can you support Hillary Clinton by not voting for Trump because we can't say that she is a Christian in fact you know you'll know them by their fruits right I don't know where Donald Trump is in faith but one thing I know is that his policies generally speaking are very very favorable to people who have a traditional historical pro-american view of things Hillary Clinton was very clearly the antithesis for that so the idea that I could say you know what I'm so religious and so holy I'm not gonna vote for any of these thirty people well if you do that you let the bad guy win there were plenty now you know this is a Jew and I know this is the author of Bonhoeffer there were plenty Christians in Germany in the 1930s who did not stand up to Adler because they were too holy take their hand pretty politics you want to talk about having blood on your hands when you sit on your hands you can get blood on your let me put it that way and and these people sat on their hands and a lot of people sat on their hands when when Romney was running because I said I'm not gonna vote for a Mormon I'm a Christian and he's not a guy this is not how you make political decisions and I think that if people cannot live in the real world and understand that sometimes you have to get political I mean if the Germans had gotten political and stood up to a Dolf Hitler um we never would have had the Holocaust I hate to put it that bluntly but when religious people start saying that politics is too dirty for me to get involved let me tell you something the people who hate you and who hate your God and who hate everything you stand for there afraid to get involved in politics and we need to get involved and so I really think that when people say this about Trump that he's this or he's that Donald Trump just got into very pro-constitution pro-life historical Connell is excuse me on the Supreme Court now what do we think Hillary Clinton would have done I don't even think somebody like George W Bush would have the guts to put in people the way Trump did and so you have to give him credit for that where he's not our pastor in chief he's meant to be a politician and a president and so I find most of these arguments really to be beside the point but people are very emotional and I don't know what to say so that's why I wrote a goofy humor book you know there's there's a piece I think you and I are on the same page that one of the biggest questions of our time is whether that Christianity is going to continue as a major force in in the West and I think that this is something that people have been talking about in Europe for a long time today there was I believe it ran today was an article in The New York Times that has gotten harder and harder to speak about God that he says that you know he once he moved to New York he found that the language that he would use to speak about God had actually deserted him it that seems to me like a real thing do you believe that that is actually something that's happening do you find that to be a problem in New York essentially I do and the authors a friend Jonathan Merritt we disagree strongly politically but I think he's quite right on that he's a Christian but here's the thing I think that Christians often are guilty of marginalizing themselves for example they say well I can't vote for Donald Trump because that would that would Mar my witness as a Christian and I think what kind of witness do you think you have today Tim Tebow who really never did anything wrong ever he was vilified by the angry secular atheist left when he did everything right so the idea that you can just avoid this and avoid that and don't vote for a Vulgarian like Donald Trump and people will like you and accept your crucified Savior that's a joke anybody who's paid attention to to the to the culture I mean look at look at Billy Graham Billy Graham was just a champion with movie star looks and many people vilified him people of faith will always be vilified so the question is not does that mean we change our tactics so that we become something we're not I mean the question is do we do the best we can do we pray for our enemies do we love our enemies I really think that people can worry about this so much that we marginalize ourselves I think that we need robust voices for faith in New York I live in New York as you know we need robust voices for the Christian faith and for God all through the culture and to the extent that I can do that I will but I think there's a reason most of my fellow evangelicals voted for Trump and when people make that sort of a dirty political calculation that's not fair that's wrong and I I have to say that if you care about the unborn which I do you're gonna vote for the person you think's gonna protect the unborn William Wilberforce one of the greatest men in the history of the world was vilified for bringing his faith into politics why did he bring his faith into politics because he actually cared about the suffering African slaves if you care about those who are suffering and being murdered and so on and so forth you have to get political I think there's no way around it and I think people who say there is our missing something wait what do you make of voices there seem to me a lot of voices out there that want the meaning that Christianity supplies but literally cannot bring themselves to believe and I'm thinking of it the Italian philosopher marchello Parra wrote a book why we should call ourselves Christians not like we should be Christians he's an atheist but Jordan Peterson is another one I love Jordan II but you know it's almost a sport here whenever we see Jordan Peterson we ask him if he believes in God it's like shooting in a man's feet to watch him dance because he won't quite answer the question yeah and he said he has said you know I don't want to be pinned down I act as if there was a god which is the the fray exact phrase that Peres uses as well what do you make of these voices of people who want the meaning but don't want the conviction well I think they can get away with it what I mean by that is nobody's putting a gun to their head said look you can't have it both ways pal choose now the reality is you can't have it both ways in other words in this culture you can have it both way and you can understand that you know it's kind of like saying I'm gonna commit adultery but I believe it's wrong if you really really believed it was wrong maybe you wouldn't commit adultery I think that there are plenty of people that let's put it this way people like Jordan peterson and marchello is it para para para para folks like that I think if a gun were put to their head and they said listen you need to choose they might choose and they might choose God but the point is nothing's forcing them to choose so they can have it both ways but here's the reality and you know this Andrew either there is meaning in the world either there is good and evil or there's not if there's good and evil in the world you need to tell me where you get it from when somebody says to me hey racism is wrong I go oh really well I agree with you but I know why it's wrong why do you say it's wrong go if you take that out of the equation you tell me why racism is wrong people will sputter and say what but I just know it is it just is it's like no no I know it is but I know why it is and the same thing with why was Hitler wrong or was he just wrong for him there are people that they can't be intellectually honest and in this country nobody forces you to be intellectually honest in the West nobody forces you to be intellectually honest but if you lived in the gulag you know with soles and eatin if you were in Kim Jong Un's Korea today you're gonna be forced to figure out what you believe you want to believe that good and evil stands apart from what the dictator says well at that point you better be a Christian because you're not gonna have that right so I think people are just being intellectually dishonest because they're allowed to be that's a great point about the West there's a great point about the West you run this thing in New York well I would have been fascinated by when I'm in New York I'm usually there for such a short period of time and I have a lot of family so I've never gotten to go to it but you've done this thing called Socrates in the city what what is that about and why did you start that well people can go online we posted videos we film everything in HD so many more people watch it online as a TV program then actually or at the events but Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living and then he blew his brains out in an hour I remember reading about that yeah because Greek I kind of thought okay in New York City you know speaking as a Christian a person of faith conservative I thought a lot of people don't think about the deeper things we don't think of it we don't examine our lives because at cocktail parties you don't want to talk about the meaning of good and evil or whatever you know you stop doing that as an undergraduate and when you when you when you enter real were in the real world places like New York you avoid those conversations I thought that's not healthy a Socrates was right the unexamined life's not worth living let's examine the big questions so I said I will interview people who have something to say and it doesn't always need to be on the big questions but it always touches on the big questions the other day we had Mark Helprin the brilliant novelist and conservative writer we've had all kinds of people from from all across the spectrum frankly I interviewed my friend Dick Cavett about celebrity and he interviewed me about miracles um Socrates in the city is just meant to be kind of a long form it's kind of like the Dick Cavett show except not on ABC or PBS but it's something that I feel we need so if people want to go to Socrates in city.com you can watch I interviewed John Lennox one of the most brilliant minds of our time he's a professor of mathematics at Oxford but he's written on science and faith just brilliant so there's a there's a lot of wonderful stuff but we're gonna be doing a lot more of them in the future Eric Metaxas when we first met you told me we were living proof that in Christ there is no Jew or Greek it's great to see you thank you very much the new book is Donald drains the swamp I'll talk to you again soon oh thank you all right stuff I like this is that's that's a redo rather we rerun from Brandon toy I like that we got to choose one of these you think okay it's a fair enough uh Halloween you know I've been watching the haunting of Hill House on Netflix and I'm really conflicted about it I watched the first two episodes and I decided to stop and I'll tell you what first let's talk about this the honey of Hill House is one of the most famous haunted house novels ever written and certainly probably the most famous written by an American unless you count Henry James as an American he kind of became a British subject after a while and he wrote the turn of the screw which is one of the most famous ones but the haunting of Hill House is just hugely famous a wonderful book and if you haven't read it as surely Jackson she was just a tremendous writer she wrote a famous short story called the lottery which everybody used to read in junior high school and off they do anymore and she wrote we have always lived in the castle one of my favorite gothic novels but the haunting of Hill House I guess is her masterpiece listen to the opening of this they they every time they make a movie of this they said this is the third filmed version of it every time they make a movie they always put this in because it's so brilliant this is the opening of the not first paragraph no live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality even larks and katydids are supposed by some to dream Hill House not sane stood by itself against its hills holding darkness within it had stood so for 80 years and might stand for 80 more within walls continued upright bricks met neatly floors were firm and doors were sensibly shut silence laced steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House and whatever walked there walked alone what I love about this is you forget where it starts by the time you get to that powerful last line of the paragraph you forget that it starts no live organism continued for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality so what she's saying is this haunted house is in a condition absolute reality so the rest of us are actually not seeing ghosts we're living in this fantasy world there which is just a brilliant kind of mind-bending concept so they made this into one of my favorite and ghost movies I have two favorite ghost movies one is the innocence which is the turn of the screw with Deborah Carr and it's written by Truman Capote and it's just so subtle and so quiet and all about the characters and all about what is happening within the people not about any boost stairs not about anybody jumping up and the other is the haunting which is the haunting of Hill House 1963 now they remade it with Liam Neeson and it was awful they remade it in the 90s Liam Neeson was just awful but this is a wonderful wonderful film I put it on stuff I liked before produced and directed by Robert Wise and starring the wonderful Julie Harris and Claire Bloom and here is a story Julie Harris and Claire Bloom were sharing a room together and it's dark and she Julie Harris starts to hear voices through the walls and she grabs hold of Claire blooms hand because she's in the bed right next to her and they're holding hands in the dark and what you hear is Julie Harris's internal monologue whose head was a she wakes up she thinks she's holding Claire blooms hand she thinks she's in the bed next door she wakes up and the bed is moved across the room and she says whose hand was i holding that to me is brilliant that's like the scene in paranormal activity where they spread flour on the floor and they wake up in their footsteps in the flour you don't have to show people anything it's just scary it is scary to think of that so what is driving me crazy about the Netflix version of the haunting of Hill House is that they do scenes like that and then they ruin them with some big boo scare and it or some act of disgusting something you know some bug crawling out her or not not that it's just the twisted faces and jumping out at you all they do it so brilliantly and then they ruin it with that with a jump scare and I stopped watching it after - cuz it was driving me nuts you know but Stephen King tweeted that he thinks it's a work of genius he loves it people are loving it so I'm gonna go back and try it again here is the brilliant the the trailer is brilliant because they show you a lot of the subtle stuff they do they do all the subtle stuff that I love I mean they do stuff where like for instance something will just be in the corner of the room and they won't even focus on it which I just love that stuff and then they'll blow it with some big jump you know and so I guess they're serving younger people who love that stuff and don't like subtlety but here's the trailer for the haunting of Hill House when a in any case read the book because it's one of the great books as a wonderful American novel Shirley Jackson wonderful American writer here's the trailer for the Netflix version now I want you to to get good rest what if they have a bad dream I'm sure we can handle any dream you have what if I dream that you sent us away into the dark and me get hurt really hurt I'm so sad is scared of the dark out there then I put poison in me for years and years until my blood turns into poison and my heart breaks right in half and I can't feel anything I can't stand anywhere tonight they have to die and time on a silver cable it's my job I excite so it's got some spooky stuff in it I'll go back and look at it again if Stephen King Stephen King has great taste in this stuff I mean he's the one who pointed me there's a little stranger one of the best ghost stories I've read recently and so but read the book Shirley Jackson is haunting of Hill House is a wonderful short novel for Halloween that you'll really like it's interesting to me that both the haunting of Hill House and the turn of the screw are about sexually repressed women and a lot of ghost stories are about women it's really interesting I mean if you think of horror stories The Exorcist is about a girl basically becoming a woman it's basically about menarche or first period is really what that movie is about and Rosemary's Baby is about a woman giving birth and all women are just scary you know their bodies change and it's all kind of weird it's like you're just a scary bunch of
