68
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,060

sold in China across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire platform</font>

73
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,540
what is your top investment pick a TJX

74
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,940
corporation<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it passes the</font>

growth type of group<font color="#CCCCCC"> type strategies</font>

77
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,380
given the run-up of the market if we're

78
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going into the first quarter earnings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

79
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,470
know you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a longer-term</font>

80
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">view and you're not necessarily macro</font>

81
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,700
but what are your thoughts on the market

82
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,700
right now well as a matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fact my</font>

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,680
expertise is not in forecasting the

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,380
market but what I feel about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market</font>

85
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,720
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is certain ratios about the market</font>

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,340
such as the price to earnings ratio of

87
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,830
the S&P 500 compared to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tenure bond</font>

88
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,150
at about three point eight percent

89
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,010
that's still showing the stock market

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,160
has room to expand and grow so well

91
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
that's not the absolute cat's meow

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,540
indicators it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

93
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,720
indicates that we can expect average to

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,519
above average performance over the next

95
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,560
five to ten years in the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,090
that's just for the market as an average

97
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,310
when you pick particular stocks within

98
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop methodologies you should</font>
