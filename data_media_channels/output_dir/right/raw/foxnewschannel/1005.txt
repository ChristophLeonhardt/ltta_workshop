1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,042
OPPORTUNITY FOR NORTH KOREA, AND

2
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,443
IF THEY DON'T TAKE IT, THE

3
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:04,712
OPPORTUNITY WILL NEVER BE THERE

4
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:05,313
AGAIN.

5
00:00:05,313 --> 00:00:08,215
IT RAISES THE STAKES BIG TIME.

6
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:11,085
>> Laura: THANK YOU.

7
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:12,520
AMERICA HAS STUNNING,

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,120
BREATHTAKING HISTORY OF

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,722
DIPLOMATIC FAILURE WHEN IT COMES

10
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:15,456
TO CURBING NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE

11
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,725
PROGRAM.

12
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:18,492
SINCE 1985, U.S. ADMINISTRATIONS

13
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,461
HAVE TRIED AND BAR GOES,

14
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:23,698
SANCTIONS, TREATIES,

15
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:24,298
APPEASEMENT.

16
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:24,999
NO COMBINATION OF STICKS AND

17
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,134
CARROTS HAS EVER WORKED.

18
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:28,970
WHY COULD IT BE DIFFERENT THIS

19
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,303
TIME?

20
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:30,504
LET'S GO BACK TO THE PANEL HERE

21
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:37,411
TO DISCUSS IT.

22
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,548
MIKE, YOU WANT TO ADDRESS A

23
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,216
POINT HOW THINGS GO BEHIND

24
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,784
CLOSED DOORS AND HOW WE TALK

25
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,186
ABOUT THEM AS MEMBERS OF THE

26
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:45,486
MEDIA.

27
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:47,588
I WANT YOU TO TOUCH IMAP BUT I

28
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,490
WANT YOU TO TOUCH ON THE ONE END

29
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,125
ON POINT THAT TRUMP MADE.

30
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,493
HE BASICALLY SAID YOU HAVE ONE

31
00:00:52,493 --> 00:00:56,097
SHOT AT THIS.

32
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:56,564
AND THIS IS IT.

33
00:00:56,564 --> 00:00:59,734
IS IT BLUSTER OR IS AT THE WAY

34
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:00,134
HE FEELS?

35
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:03,104
>> IT'S IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

36
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,672
MILITARY EXERCISES, MILITARY

37
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:07,508
THREATS LAST YEAR, THE EXTREME

38
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,242
SANCTIONS, PERHAPS OTHER THINGS.

39
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,545
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YET.

40
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:15,516
THERE'S A KIND OF INTIMIDATION

41
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:16,317
OF CHAIRMAN KIM.

42
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:17,451
HE IS 34 YEARS OLD.

43
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:21,956
HE IS VERY POISED.

44
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,724
HE IS CALM, TOUCHING

45
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,159
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ARM THE WAY

46
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,926
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUCHES HIS ARM.

47
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:28,229
ON THE SERVICE, THERE IS THIS

48
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,497
MILD CAMARADERIE.

49
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:31,599
AS A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, I LOOK

50
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,434
AT THIS IN TERMS OF THE MEDIA

51
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:33,768
OUTSIDE.

52
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:34,702
CHRIS WALLACE AND THE OTHERS,

53
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:37,338
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING

54
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:37,805
ON IN THAT ROOM.

55
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:42,009
FOR ALL WE KNOW THERE IS CLOSE

56
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,712
TO A WALK OUT AND BACK TO THE

57
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:45,479
TABLES AND EVEN MILITARY

58
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:45,946
THREATS.

59
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,716
OR IT'S THE OPPOSITE, THAT THEY

60
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:50,985
HAVE A SCHEDULE FOR DISMANTLING,

61
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,122
THEY HAVE SPECIFIC THINGS.

62
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:57,825
FIRST STOP THE PLUTONIUM

63
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:58,259
REPROCESSING.

64
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,527
THEN THE UNDERGROUND URANIUM

65
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:00,294
ENRICHMENT FACILITIES.

66
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:05,466
IN THE CASE OF NIXON AND MAO AND

67
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:08,301
LATER WITH GORBACHEV AND

68
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:08,902
REYKJAVIK.

69
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:09,637
THE DOCUMENTS WERE KEPT SECRET

70
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:13,107
FOR 30 YEARS.

71
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,008
SCHOLARS ONLY FOUND OUT, THIS

72
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:19,213
WAS THE DEAL.

73
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,916
IT'S NOT A PREMATURE COMMENTARY,

74
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,918
GOING OUT ON A LIMB, THESE

75
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,685
JOURNALISTS WHO THINK THEY KNOW

76
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,920
IT'S GOING ON.

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,921
THEY REALLY DON'T.

78
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,788
I HAVE A HUNCH WE'RE GOING TO

79
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:29,957
LEARN MORE AT THE PRESS

80
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:30,624
CONFERENCE.

81
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:36,263
BUT ONLY AS WE BEGIN TO SEE WHEN

82
00:02:36,263 --> 00:02:36,764
WE'LL BE THE FIRST

83
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:37,198
DISMANTLEMENT.

84
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,299
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO SMALL STEPS

85
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,500
ALREADY.

86
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,302
BLOWING UP OF THE TUNNELS WITH

87
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:42,336
THE PRESS NEARBY.

88
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:46,107
IT WASN'T A HOAX.

89
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:48,542
>> Laura: IT WAS ALREADY KIND

90
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:48,976
OF COLLAPSED?

91
00:02:48,976 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT STRANGE STORY ABOUT THE
