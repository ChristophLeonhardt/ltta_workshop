one hour from now the Senate Judiciary Committee will gather in room 226 of the Dirksen Senate office building for a once-in-a-generation type of hearing Christine glossy Ford will testify under oath that she was sexually assaulted by Judge Brett Kavanaugh who a week ago seemed to be on the verge of becoming the next Supreme Court justice this morning it is far far far from a sure thing and make no mistake what we will see today will change the trajectory of both of their lives and potentially the Supreme Court as well that should matter to every single one of us so what are we gonna hear this morning well we have the opening statements here is part of Ford's recounting what she says happened at a party in the summer of 1982 it reads quote threat groped me and tried to take off my clothes he had a hard time because he was so drunk and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes I believed he was going to rape me I tried to yell for help when I did Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming this was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that Brett was accidentally gonna kill me both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack he both seemed to be having a good time mark was urging Brett on although at times he did tell Brett to stop a couple of times I made eye contact with mark and thought he might try to help me but he did not Cavanaugh has denied the allegations going so far as to say he has never been at a party like that and wasn't friends with dr. Ford but in his statement this morning he admits to some less than stellar behavior quote I was not perfect in those days just as I'm not perfect today I drank beer with my friends usually on weekends sometimes I had too many in retrospect I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now but that is not why we are here today what I have been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior I never did anything remotely resembling what dr. four describes in fact senator Grassley now says two men have come forward and each has told committee staff he believes he was the one who assaulted dr. Ford back in 82 not Brett Kavanaugh but Cavanaugh is facing sexual misconduct allegations from at least two other women as well Deborah Ramirez and Julie sweat neck Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself while the two were classmates at Yale sweat net came forward just yesterday alleging she went to house parties with Kavanaugh in the early 80s she says she saw him drink excessively and fondle girls without their consent she also says she witnessed Kavanaugh and others trying to get girls so drunk so they could be gang-raped sweat Knicks spoke to John Heilemann for showtimes the circus and described the behavior she says she witnessed of the things that are in your sworn statement or other particular things you regard as disqualifying for a Supreme Court nominee I think all of the above I mean that's not the type of behavior that anybody at any age should do I don't think women should be treated that way and I don't think that any human being should treat people that way we should make it clear that while sweat mnek alleges Kavanaugh was sexually aggressive and inappropriate she has not accused him of rape the Judiciary Committee has attempted to look into all of those allegations ahead of today's hearing and late yesterday we learned the committee asked Kavanaugh about a fourth allegation that he physically assaulted a woman while drunk in 1998 according to transcripts released by the Senate yesterday Kavanaugh said quote we're dealing with an anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend it is ridiculous total Twilight Zone and no I have never done anything like that he has denied all of the allegations so let's get back to the hearing the focus will initially be on dr. Ford after opening statements from the Senators she will testify and then answer questions Cavanaugh will go second several Republican senators have said their decision on Kavanagh s confirmation will hinge on what happens in that hearing room today even President Trump said he could change his mind hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos you
