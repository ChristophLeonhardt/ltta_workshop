00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:07,860
>> Shepard: CONTINUING COVERAGE

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,294
ON FOX'S TOP STORY.

3
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:11,163
DEADLY PROTESTS IN GAZA AS

4
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,064
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOLLOWING

5
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:14,099
THROUGH ON HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISE

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,302
TO MOVE THE U.S. EMBASSY TO

7
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:17,669
JERUSALEM.

8
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:22,141
LET'S GO TO JOHN ALTERMAN FROM A

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,075
BIPARTISAN RESEARCH

10
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:23,509
ORGANIZATION.

11
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,577
HE SERVED AT THE STATE

12
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:26,245
DEPARTMENT UNDER PRESIDENT

13
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:27,579
GEORGE W. BUSH AS A MEMBER OF

14
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,647
THE POLICY PLANNING STAFF.

15
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:29,848
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:30,382
THANK YOU.

17
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,683
>> GOOD TO BE BACK.

18
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:32,518
THANK YOU, SHEP.

19
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:35,020
>> Shepard: YOUR THOUGHTS ON

20
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,054
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT.

21
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,223
>> YOU KNOW, I GUESS THE BIGGEST

22
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,525
QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE TRUMP

23
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,093
ADMINISTRATION REALLY TRYING TO

24
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:41,627
DO?

25
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:45,564
A BIG POLITICAL GIFT FOR PRIME

26
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,567
MINISTER FOR NETANYAHU.

27
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:49,501
>> Shepard: WHICH IT IS.

28
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,170
>> SETS BACK THE

29
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,304
ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ENGAGE

30
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,273
ON PEACE MAKING.

31
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:56,108
EUROPEANS HAVE BECOME MORE

32
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:56,475
ALIENATED.

33
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:57,976
YOU CAN ARGUE IT DOESN'T MATTER,

34
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:58,744
MAYBE IT DOES.

35
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,279
I'M NOT SURE WHERE THIS FITS

36
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,281
INTO A BROADER SCHEME OF THINGS

37
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:05,384
EXCEPT TO SAY THIS IS A VERY

38
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:06,118
UNCONVENTIONAL ADMINISTRATION.

39
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:07,419
>> Shepard: HISTORICALLY THIS

40
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,921
HAS BEEN SEEN AS THE KIND OF

41
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:11,890
THING YOU DO IN EXCHANGE FOR

42
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,092
SOMETHING ELSE.

43
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:14,827
IS THAT RIGHT?

44
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:16,061
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

45
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:17,863
THIS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST

46
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,199
PRIZE, THE ONE WHERE PEOPLE

47
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:23,735
COULD SLICE AND DICE IT ANY

48
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:24,736
NUMBER OF WAYS.

49
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,438
YOU WANT IT TO BE A CLOSER, NOT

50
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:27,539
YOUR OPENING BID.

51
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,308
IF IT'S YOUR OPENING BID, IT

52
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,710
ENDS UP NOT BEING VERY VALUABLE

53
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,078
UNLESS YOU REALLY CHANGE THE

54
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:33,979
ENVIRONMENT.

55
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,914
EVERYTHING I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST

56
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:38,584
SEVERAL MONTHS SUGGESTS IT

57
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:41,053
HASN'T CHANGED THE ENVIRONMENT.

58
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:45,357
YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS BREAK DOWN

59
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,191
IN POLITICS.

60
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,260
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE

61
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,862
GALVANIZED A MOVEMENT TO CHANGE

62
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:50,195
THINGS.

63
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,864
IT SEEMS TO HAVE GIVEN THE PRIME

64
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:53,532
MINISTER A BOOST AND FRANKLY

65
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:54,833
GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP A LITTLE

66
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,802
BIT OF A POLITICAL BOOST IN THE

67
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:57,269
UNITED STATES.

68
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,439
>> Shepard: BY WAY OF EXAMPLE,

69
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,342
600,000 OR SO ISRAELIS NOW LIVE

70
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:07,346
IN SETTLEMENTS IN THE OCCUPIED

71
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:09,281
TERRITORIES IN PALESTINIAN

72
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:09,580
LANDS.

73
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,383
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT

74
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:15,354
IF FOR INSTANCE THE IT'S RAIL

75
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:15,888
IF FOR INSTANCE THE IT'S RAI

76
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:15,921
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRS RAI

77
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:15,954
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAERAI

78
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:15,988
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAELII

79
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:19,525
IF FOR INSTANCE THE ISRAELIS

80
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:21,393
ABANDON THE SETTLEMENTS, THIS

81
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:24,563
WAS LIKE THE KIND OF THING YOU'D

82
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:27,599
GIVE IN RETURN, RIGHT?

83
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,335
>> EVERYBODY BELIEVES THERE WILL

84
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:33,238
BE LAND SWAPS.

85
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,607
SOME WILL LEAVE THE WEST BANK

86
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,310
WHEN YOU GET TO A DEAL.

87
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,912
SEEMS ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE THAT

88
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,580
WE GO TO HEAR FROM GETTING A

89
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,748
DEAL WITHOUT REAL CHANGE IN THE

90
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:45,584
SITUATION ON THE GROUND, WHICH

91
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:47,286
UNFORTUNATELY MAY BE SOME SORT

92
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:50,622
OF VIOLENCE PERPETRATED ONE WAY

93
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:52,691
OR THE OTHER.

94
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,493
I'M NOT SURE HOW WE GET THERE

95
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,827
FROM HERE BECAUSE OF A SENSE

96
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:56,995
THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS GIVEN

97
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,698
UP THE IDEA OF BEING BETWEEN THE

98
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:01,567
PARTIES AND INSTEAD HAS ADOPTED

99
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,502
A THEORY THAT THE PROBLEM THAT

100
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:04,937
ISRAEL IS TOO WEAK AND BE SIEGED

101
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:08,807
AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE TOO

102
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,141
STRONG.

103
00:03:09,141 --> 00:00:00,000
MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT'S NOT THE
