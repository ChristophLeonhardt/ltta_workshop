day 452 of the Trump administration and we learned today beyond a doubt that the case involving his personal lawyer Michael Cohen is indeed shaping up to be a big problem for this president lawyers for Trump and Cohen have been trying to protect records that were swept up and seized in that FBI raid exactly one week ago today a federal judge rejected that request but ruled prosecutors would have to share findings of the raid with Cohen's and Trump's lawyers on a quote rolling basis while the judge decides on the next steps here the proceedings also brought this unexplained revel unexpected revelation Fox News host sean hannity was outed as a client of michael Cohen's something Cohen's lawyers had taken great pains to keep secret hannity has been a fierce defender of the president and his policies and a harsh critic of this FBI rate it is clear as I have been warning Muller is out to get the president and it appears at any cost here's what happened upon referral from special counselor Robert Muller the FBI has raided the office the home and the hotel room of Michael Cohen Cohen was never part of the Trump administration or the Trump campaign this is now officially an all-hands-on-deck effort to totally malign and if possible impeach the President of the United States on his radio program today sean hannity made a point of denying that michael cohen represented him i have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which i wanted his input and perspective not one of any issue i ever dealt with Michael Kohn on ever ever involved a matter between me and any third party I never gave him a retainer never received an invoice never paid any any fees you know I might have handed him ten bucks I definitely want you attorney-client privilege on this something like that and just a few hours ago on his show on Fox News he added this Michael called never represent in any legal matter my discussions with Michael Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone I never asked Michael Kohn to bring this proceeding on my behalf I have no personal interest in this legal matter court filings confirm Michael Cohen is under federal criminal investigation and has been for months he has not been charged with any crime but agents have been scrutinizing his email accounts his banking travel and business records his communications with media organizations and with the Trump campaign as well as any information about payments he made two women who alleged relationships with Donald Trump including but not limited to porn star stormy Daniels just for good measure as we said she and her attorney Michael avenatti were in federal court for today's hearing on the Cohen case both spoke with reporters afterwards mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as mr. Trump's fixer he is played by a different set of rules or should we say no rules at all I said last Friday and this weekend that Michael Cohen was radioactive and that anybody that was associated with him in the last 20 to 30 years should be very very concerned what we witnessed earlier in the hearing with the disclosure relating the sean hannity proved my point depending on what is contained within those documents I think there is significant danger to the president the president trusted the president trusted mr. Cohen as his fixer for years he trusted in with his innermost secrets and I think that the chickens are about to come home to roost let's bring in our leadoff panel for another very busy Monday night Phillip Rucker Whitehouse bureau chief for the Washington Post and as of a few hours ago he is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Ashley Parker White House reporter for The Washington Post and as of a few hours ago she is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and both we are pleased to say our MSNBC political analysts also with us tonight chuck rosenberg former US attorney for our senior FBI official and an MSNBC contributor and Jennifer Rogers former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York now executive director for Columbia Law School Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity good evening to you all congratulations to some of you and Jennifer I'm going to begin with you as you are for the purposes of our New York studios our lead counsel here tonight what did today mean for two men for Donald Trump and Michael Cohen well what's interesting is it's the first time that Donald Trump has appeared in any of these court proceedings he actually had a lawyer show up and argue in one of these cases so that's a key thing the other important thing of course is that they lost their arguments today Cohen and Trump lost their argument that they should be able to actually sift through all of these materials and hold back what they think is privileged the government made a compelling case that they had appropriate procedures in place that the crimes that they had suspected that Michael Cohen committed involved dishonesty that he's been shown that he can't be trusted to respond in a comprehensive way to subpoenas and so a search warrant was the appropriate way to go here and they need to be able to go through this material without it being basically picked apart by Trump and by Cohen in advance and isn't the argument to that in English kind of if we thought you guys could be trusted with all you have we wouldn't have blown in your doors with with search warrants exactly and in fact it became clear through the papers that they had issued subpoenas to Michael Cohen previously and had reason to believe from the return on those subpoenas that Cohen was holding things back so you know they actually have kind of done this been there done that and say listen you know we had to do a search warrant this time so we can go through it ourselves hey Chuck explained to our good viewers how it is that the president's lawyers were in effect today arguing against the president's Justice Department and in in your lifetime have we ever seen anything like that well it's a little bit odd Brian you're right so judge Kimball would the federal judge in the Southern District of New York presiding here permitted the Trump attorneys to appear on behalf of the President to articulate his interests I don't think she had to do that because he's not technically a party the party was by the United States Department of Justice on one side and the person who got searched Michael Cohen on the other but judge wood is a and Jennifer knows this much better than me a very thoughtful judge a very deliberate judge and so to make a full record and to hear everybody out she permitted the president's attorneys to appear and to articulate his position now to your point Brian it was adverse to the Department of Justice but I imagine he's appearing at his personal capacity and not as the chief executive of our land speaking of strange bedfellows next question goes to a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Ashley Parker Ashley there were audible gasps apparently in the courtroom today when Sean Hannity's name came out is this just part and parcel of the confusing spectacular world and orbit of Michael Cohen I think that's a good way of viewing it it's sort of you know his name coming out sort of feels like the bar scene in Star Wars it's sort of a fun quirk and a fun twist and a sort of but of course but at the same time among the things that you know the president's team and West Wing aides are concerned about as of now at least it's it's not Sean Hannity being one of Michael Cohen's three clients in 2017 Phil Rucker Pulitzer Prize winner did I mention I want to read you something from our friends at The Associated Press this is dual byline Lemire and Lucy president Donald Trump and his allies have hit a new level of anxiety after the raid on his personal Attorney's Office fearful of deeper exposure for Trump his inner circle and his adult children the more than concerned and and more than concerned that they don't know exactly what is in those records and electronic devices seized last week there is also some worry that Michael Cohen may strike a deal with prosecutors out of concern about his own prospects Phil as far as your reporting and as far as you're concerned does that get it about right that's exactly right the story by John and Catherine spot-on there's been this growing anxiety in the White House among the president's advisors about this Cohen situation ever since the moment those rates happened on Monday because they just simply don't know what those records are they have very little visibility into anything pertaining to these investigations but especially with the Cohen matter they don't know what sort of documents may have been seized at the house or the office they don't know what sort of electronic recordings there might be that's important because Cohen as the Washington Post reported a few days ago has been known to record a lot of his private conversations including possibly with Donald Trump and they also don't know where the federal investigators are headed with all of this they sort of vaguely understand that there are some tax issues and and bank fraud involved but it's unclear exactly what the investigation investigators are after in terms of sifting through Cohen's records hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over
