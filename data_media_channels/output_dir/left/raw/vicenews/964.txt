1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,640
(Chanting) Whose streets? Our streets!

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,840
(HATE)

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:11,115
If you've seen footage from the Charlottesville protests,

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,055
you might have noticed something a little strange:

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,925
Chris Cantwell, who's a white supremacist, has an Asian tattoo.

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:20,295
The tattoo's a little sloppy, but it's supposed to be the Japanese character

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,900
for "truth".

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,560
And it's actually not that strange. White supremacists love Asia, especially Japan,

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,225
and every well-known white supremacist in recent memory

10
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,220
seems to have some kind of weird Asia fetish.

11
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:36,035
Everyone from former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke,

12
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,375
to far right Norwegian extremist and mass murderer Anders Breivik,

13
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:41,955
to Charleston shooter Dylann Roof

14
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:44,885
have all raved about the virtues of East Asian countries, and praised Japan

15
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,545
as a model to follow.

16
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,585
So what gives? Why do racists like Japan so much?

17
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,440
Well, the shorter answer is

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,840
they view Japan as a mono-ethnic utopia, which is exactly

19
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,420
what they wish the U.S. was.

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,420
Here's how Richard Spencer puts it.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,880
"It's wonderful being in Japan; it is an ethno-state.

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,400
Japan, whatever problems it might have, does not have

23
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,475
the problem of diversity, and therefore

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
Japan can truly be a homeland. It can be a

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,240
home!"

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,500
But it's a little more complicated than that.

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,220
It's not just that White Supremacists love Japan;

28
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,940
it's that they have to love Japan.

29
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,620
There's a precedent for this--

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,820
in Nazi Germany.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,525
By the early 1900s, Japan had become powerful

32
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:29,820
enough to pose a military threat to some European countries,

33
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:32,815
which, in turn, poses a threat to the idea that White people are

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,600
inherently superior.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,620
So even though Adolf Hitler personally didn't like Japan very much,

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
publicly, he had to say that he respected the Japanese.

37
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,555
Fast forward to today.

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,660
The economic success of some Asian countries

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,140
poses an intellectual quandary for even the most sophisticated Reddit troll.

40
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:53,395
Even things like college acceptance rates for Asian Americans

41
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:56,285
kinda throw a wrench in the whole "white superiority" idea.

42
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:59,265
So some modern White Supremacists have gone even further

43
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:01,955
than Hitler did and don't just tolerate Asians;

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,940
they actually idolize them.

45
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,835
That's why White Supremacist Jared Taylor told a Japanese news crew

46
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,794
in fluent Japanese (because he grew up there)

47
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:12,725
that Blacks and Latinos are inherently inferior to Whites.

48
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,945
But he also said that Asians have higher IQs than White people.

49
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:19,435
When he was asked for details, he just said "that's biology."

50
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:20,075
(Japanese for Biology)

51
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:23,065
Now, the quote-unquote "science" behind studies that support this sort of thing

52
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,955
has been pretty roundly debunked,

53
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:28,825
and there's no evidence that homogeneity equals success,

54
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:30,500
whether that's in Japan or elsewhere.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,180
But White Supremacists keep blindly worshipping Asians because if they don't account for them somehow,

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,180
then the whole ideology starts to fall apart.

57
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,920
It's also pretty convenient,

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,195
and pointing to successful Asian people allows you to argue that racism doesn't exist

59
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:47,135
and that any socioeconomic problems that Blacks and Latinos face are

60
00:02:47,135 --> 00:02:49,775
because their culture or their DNA is inferior.

61
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,225
But really, it all comes down to what people do when the way they look at the world

62
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,455
is challenged. Some people take a step back and say

63
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:59,205
"Hey, maybe something else is going on here, like, maybe racism

64
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:02,335
or structural inequality. And some people just get

65
00:03:02,335 --> 00:00:00,000
a Japanese tattoo.
