When that tornado
warning goes off,
it’s like a drug to
take away your pain.
It’s coming across the road.
Bring it!
Whoo!
Let’s fucking go!
All done.
Hand.
You got it?
Oh buddy.
I get the test
results in a few days.
Maybe — maybe nothing happened.
You know, maybe I got lucky.
I don’t know.
Fourteen, fifteen… 
alcohol came into my life,
and that pretty
much destroyed it.
Went all the way
through high school,
then I got in a little
bit of trouble drinking
and I went in the service.
And then my mental
illness hit.
And then I spent the
next 20 years
in and out
of institutions.
I had 10 years sobriety,
basically ended up here
because I relapsed.
I got six years now.
Under cloudy skies.
Hibbing reported 57.
International
Falls reported 62.
Alexandria reported —
You know, I’m not the only
one who has ever had cancer,
and I won’t be the last.
But you’ve just got to get
up every day and battle.
Storm chasing was
on my bucket list.
And … I’ve definitely got to
see a tornado this summer,
before it’s over with.
Because if it’s
bad news
I might die in a week or two
weeks, or a month.
There’s only a few
short months in there
that you can really chase.
Once that’s over
with, it’s over.
So if you got the
opportunity, you got to go.
So … we got to go.
Don’t want to forget anything.
We’re good.
Hey, Mike. Mark.
I’m flooring it.
I’ll do my best.
Ha-ha, O.K.
See you then, bud.
The chase is on.
Bye.
Yee-haw.
Getting pumped up.
Could be the last
chase of the year.
I told a friend I was going to
get in one of those van tours
down south and
chase tornadoes.
And he said, I think I
can do you one better.
He has a nephew that does it.
He hooked Mike and I up and we
hit it off, right off the bat.
Smell the tornadoes
in the air.
[MUSIC - STEVE EARL,
“COPPERHEAD ROAD”]
“… the D.E.A.’s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like
I'm back over there.
I learned a thing or two from
Charlie don't you know.
You better stay away
from Copperhead Road.”
This is cool,
watching it come over.
And that wall
cloud is just huge.
This thing is moving
in fast, though.
It’s pretty sweet.
— Yeah, really fast.
I’m going to get in the car
because there’s lightning.
Lightning is dangerous.
This is where you got to
make the right decision.
If we go for the
northern one, if we
go for the southern one.
Yeah, all we can do now is hope 
this storm produces a tornado.
We’re in perfect position.
It’s going to get really,
really, really loud.
Look at the — it’s trying
to be a tornado right there.
You see that rapid rising
motion in the clouds there?
There’s rotation
right above us.
Check it out.
Look at that.
They certainly tried for us.
Some awesome supercells, but
their bases were so high up.
Every time they would
wrap the RFD around
and try to produce, it was
just … never going to happen.
We had that awesome
rotation, though.
That was pretty sweet.
My demons are … smoking,
depression, alcohol, cancer.
There’s a few!
I haven’t thrown anything
since sober softball.
And that’s been a while.
It’s the way it is.
Sometimes you
get away in life,
and you don’t have anything,
and some people got a lot.
And that’s the way it is.
I guess that’s who
made me me today.
We didn’t get a tornado today.
But they’re singing.
The clouds are singing.
We’ll probably
get one tomorrow.
Look forward to getting up.
Yee-haw.
Do you think the cancer
has made you braver, maybe?
Not afraid?
Yeah.
That helped.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Want to hear an
interesting story?
Mm-hmm.
This morning, we took off
and I didn’t tell work.
And I’m just like, fuck it.
This forecast is too good.
We’re going to do this.
And I was just like,
well, they’re either going
to fire me or they’re not.
And then —
Holy shit.
So that was the biggest
gamble, like, in the world.
Wow.
So I’m either getting fired
and we’re seeing no tornado,
or I’m getting fired and
we’re getting a tornado.
Or I’m not getting fired
and we’re getting a tornado.
We’re getting a tornado.
Well, you got a few
hairs raised on my head.
I ain’t got many,
but they’re raised.
Wow.
Yeah.
This — this could be it.
It’s important.
I’ll settle down in
a couple of years
maybe, but … never
stop chasing, right?
You know that couple that
got married and chased.
Yeah, that would be —
There’s a couple couples
that got married and chased.
That would be a dream
scenario, is to find a —
find a girl that’s
into the weather
and wants to hit the road
with me whenever it’s time.
And that would be awesome.
Yeah.
And if she was hot.
Yeah.
Get these lights off.
All right.
Try to sleep good.
Hit it hard tomorrow.
So right now, we are sitting
in southeast Wyoming.
It’s 1:21 PM local time.
And I couldn’t be
any more excited
and nervous at the same time.
I’m nervous because,
like, failing today
would be just an
absolute stab to the heart.
So it’s like, if I were
to play in the Super Bowl,
I can imagine this
is kind of what
it feels like before
that game takes off.
Not sure what
it’s going to do.
We got one sort of
lame storm there.
It’s still only 4:30
and we have time left.
But at the moment, I
am a little worried.
So I think I’m going
to stop
and see what Tony
wants to do.
I really wish I had …
But there’s next year. I hope.
Hopefully, I’ll be alive,
kicking and chasing and —
When they do the PET scan,
you know, what do you
want the results to —
how does that dictate
what you do this winter?
Well, they could tell me that —
it’s from my head to the toe.
Yeah.
And it tells, from the
last one to this one,
if the cancer is gone or
little pebbles formed up
and made new cancer.
What if that’s the case?
Fuck it.
You’re not going
to do anything?
Nope.
I’m going to say, ”How long do
I got if I don’t do anything?”
Are you saying Wednesday,
they could tell you,
like, something bad?
Yeah.
Really?
And then you just
wouldn’t even have to —
you wouldn’t work?
You wouldn’t —
I don’t want to go
through that shit again.
Hey, Mom.
We’re out in Bumfuck
South Dakota chasing,
and we probably won’t
know until 2:00 or 3:00.
So if you try to call me
later, you might not get me.
Yup. Well, we’re on —
Holy shit.
That place exploded.
I go for a test tomorrow.
Yep.
Look at the bomb
in front of us.
O.K. I got to go.
It’s already got
a hook on radar.
9:45.
We got initiation here.
So we got a storm
we’re following.
Woo.
It’s firing up,
so I got to go.
O.K.
You have a good night.
Bye.
You can see, Mark,
what’s happened
in the last few minutes.
Yeah.
Wow.
See it there?
Yep.
We’re going to core
punch like we always do.
It’s just a baby.
Pretty soon, there’ll be bolts
of lightning going crazy.
This is where you get excited.
This is amazing radar, guys.
Like, 15 minutes.
We just got to go.
We got to go.
We got to go.
Oh, it’s the
last one of the year.
Let him be.
Yee-haw.
We got hail and wind and
heavy rain straight ahead.
Got to punch through it.
Moonroof’s going to blow.
Should be all right.
They re-issued the tornado
warning, so look around.
 “If you’re in a
vehicle, do not attempt
to outrun the tornado.
Tornadoes tend to move
in erratic paths —”
It’s going to be a big one.
“— oftentimes outpacing cars.”
Mark, can you see it?
“— to the path of
the oncoming storm.”
Shit.
“The best choice is to get into
a nearby shelter or building.”
What are we going to do?
How does that happen?
How does the road end?
The road’s not
supposed to end.
I need to go back through
this, and I need to go south.
Yep.
Son of a bitch!
Here it is.
Here it is.
Strong, strong tornado!
Strong tornado in progress.
It’s happening!
It’s happening!
Film the fuck out of that!
It’s happening, now.
Oh, my God.
There it is.
Do you see it?
It’s happening.
Woo!
There it is!
Let’s go get it.
Come on!
Let’s go get it.
Get in the car, get in
the car, get in the car.
Come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
Oh, you’re so beautiful.
Oh, ho, ho, my God.
Oh, my God.
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Get the fuck out of here.
Bring it!
Woo!
Let’s fucking go!
You’re good, you’re
good, you’re good.
Ohhh, boy!
These guys got to get
the fuck out of my way.
Mark! Mark, we did it!
At times, our fear and
pain may seem unbearable.
Our instinct may be to run.
To retreat and avoid
the fear and the pain.
We need a vision that
begins within us.
A vision feeds the soul.
Good job, buddy.
That’s the way I like to live.
Hey, I just got home
from the hospital.
Want to give me a call?
Bye.
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, it’s me.
Hey, how you doing?
Did you get the
results back yet?
Great.
Negative.
Oh, my God.
Mark, that’s amazing.
Isn’t it though?
That’s what I thought.
Yeah.
Cancer free.
You’re going to be
stuck with me chasing.
Sorry.
Yep.
Got it.
O.K.
Have a good nap.
Bye.
Chase Friday.
