WE HAVE THE ANNUAL TRADITION HERE IN AMERICA WHERE THE PRESIDENT PARDONS A TURKEY, IT'S PREPOSTEROUS. WE SLAUGHTER MILLIONS OF THEM FOR THIS HOLIDAY OF OURS, LET'S KEEP IT REAL, BUT WE PARDON ONE ARE WE NOT MAGNANIMOUS? ANYWAY, IT'S OKAY, IT HAPPENS. TRUMP HAS NOT DONE IT PARTICULARLY WORSE NECESSARILY THAN ANYONE ELSE. WELL, BE THE JUDGE FOR YOURSELF I WANT TO SHOW YOU TRUMP THINKING HE'S PARDONING A TURKEY AND HOW IT TURNS OUT. LET'S WATCH. WE WON'T SHOW THE ASPIRIN OVER HERE. HIS ASPIRIN. AFTER THAT HE SAID I WILL NOT PARDON YOU, YOU ARE TERRIBLE, YOU ARE A FAKE TURKEY. IN THAT CASE THAT WOULD BE TRUE. THAT WAS FROM THE CAMPAIGN WHEN HE HAD A GOOFY SHOOT WITH AN EAGLE. ARE YOU READY, DRUMSTICK? OKAY? DRUMSTICK, YOU ARE HEREBY PARDONED. PEOPLE TRY TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH EVERY SINGLE THING DONALD TRUMP DOES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK THAT HARD. BUT IN THIS CASE, SOME FOLKS HAVE LOOKED TOO HARD. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS GUY IS JOKING OR NOT, BUT DAVE BROWN WRITES TRUMP MAY HAVE PARDONED THE WRONG BIRD. OH MY GOD, WE HAVE A CONSPIRACY AFOOT. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE WRONG BIRD. WE ARE KILLING 99.999% OF THEM, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANOTHER BIRD AND WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE? I HOPE HE WAS JOKING THERE'S NO REAL CONSPIRACY HERE. IN FACT, I PARDON DONALD TRUMP'S PARDON. IT WAS PERFECTLY FINE, THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FUN BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BACK THE LEGENDARY SARAH PALIN PARDONING OF A TURKEY THAT WENT DISASTROUSLY WRONG, AND AFTERWARDS I WILL READ YOU SOME GREAT TWEETS ON THE TRUMP PARDON OF THE TURKEY. BUT REMEMBER THIS MOMENT? SHE GOES TO PARDON A TURKEY AND DOESN'T NOTICE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH IS DECIDEDLY NOT PARDONING A TURKEY, WATCH. THANKFULLY WE ARE IN A GOOD POSITION STILL FISCALLY SPEAKING. ACCOUNTING FOR THAT, ALL THAT COMES INTO PLAY NOW AT $50 A BARREL OIL. ESPECIALLY WITH SO MUCH THAT HAS GONE ON IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT HAS BEEN SO POLITICAL, OBVIOUSLY HEAVY-HANDED POLITICS THAT INVITES CRITICISM, CERTAINLY WILL PROBABLY INVITE CRITICISM FOR EVEN DOING THIS TOO BUT AT LEAST THIS WAS FUN. I'LL BE IN CHARGE OF THE TURKEY. I'M WHERE I NEED TO BE TODAY TO PREPARE FOR THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT PART OF THAT VIDEO I LOVE MOST. IS IT THE TURKEY GOING THROUGH THE GRINDER IN THE BACKGROUND? AND I'M SORRY, FOR ALL YOU VEGANS, SHE'S LIKE I'M HERE TO PARDON A TURKEY, I WILL PROBABLY EVEN GET CRITICIZED FOR THIS. MEANWHILE THE TURKEY IS TWITCHING IN THE BACKGROUND YOU PROBABLY WILL GET CRITICIZED FOR THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE A KNUCKLEHEAD. OR THE GUY WHO KEEPS LOOKING BACK YES, DUDE, YOU ARE IN THE VIDEO. NOW BACK TO TRUMP, MATT FULLER WITH A GREAT TWEET, IMITATING TRUMP AFTER THE PARDON ELON GALE WITH ANOTHER GREAT ONE, WRITING IN I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T NAME IT LAVAR. AND FINALLY THIS ONE NICE TRY, MIKE FLYNN. AH, THIS IS TOO MUCH FUN. NOT IMPORTANT, JUST FUN, WE'RE MOVING ON.
