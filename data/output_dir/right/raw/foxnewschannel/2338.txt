00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,034
>> Bret: IT IS FRIDAY, YOU

3
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,369
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,

4
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,770
NOTABLE QUOTABLES.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,706
>> I MANAGED TO GET HIM WITH

6
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:18,774
ONE HAND ON THE GUN AND THEN

7
00:00:18,774 --> 00:00:20,442
I GRABBED IT FROM HIM, AND I

8
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,011
THREW IT OVER THE COUNTER

9
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:22,277
TOP.

10
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,179
>> IT WAS A GRUESOME SCENE.

11
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,614
REALLY BAD OUT THERE.

12
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:26,448
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I

13
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:27,049
SEEN, MAN.

14
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,151
OH, MAN, EVERYBODY ALL THESE

15
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,019
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

16
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:31,353
GETTING HIT ONE BY ONE.

17
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:34,723
>> TO BE IN THAT DUGOUT

18
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,191
WHERE THEY STILL MARKED THE

19
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:36,859
BULLET HOLES THERE.

20
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,627
>> WE ARE VINDICATED.

21
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:39,528
WE'RE VALIDATED.

22
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,596
WE'RE NOT SHUTTING UP.

23
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:41,663
AND WE ARE NOT GOING AWAY.

24
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:43,065
>> I'M GOING TO BE ON

25
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:44,666
ANOTHER NETWORK TOMORROW

26
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,634
THAT THINKS I SHOULD BE IN

27
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:45,934
JAIL.

28
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,236
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR

29
00:00:47,236 --> 00:00:47,603
QUESTIONS.

30
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:51,040
>> KIM JONG UN WAS -- HE

31
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,708
REALLY HAS BEEN VERY OPEN,

32
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:53,175
VERY HONORABLE.

33
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,376
>> FACTS ARE FACTS AND

34
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:55,744
FICTION IS FICTION.

35
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:56,879
AND A LIE DOESN'T BECOME

36
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,880
TRUTH JUST BECAUSE IT

37
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,680
APPEARS ON THE FRONT PAGE OF

38
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,214
THE NEWSPAPER.

39
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:01,717
>> IT'S PRETTY HISTORIC

40
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:02,384
SENDING SECRETARY OF STATE

41
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:04,420
TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT A

42
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,019
POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION.

43
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,321
>> I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND.

44
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:07,156
>> IN THE WHITE HOUSE THEY

45
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:08,223
CALL HIM THE CANDY MAN.

46
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,692
>> I SAID TO DR. JACKSON

47
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:11,760
WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR?

48
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,462
I SAID WHAT DO YOU NEED THIS

49
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:13,729
FOR?

50
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:14,630
BUT I SAID WHAT DO YOU NEED

51
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,130
IT FOR.

52
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,298
I SAID TO HIM WHAT DO YOU

53
00:01:16,298 --> 00:01:18,767
NEED IT FOR?

54
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:23,105
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

55
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:24,807
>> I LIKE HIM A LOT.

56
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:29,578
WE DO HAVE A VERY SPECIAL

57
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:30,012
RELATIONSHIP.

58
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:31,680
WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM PERFECT.

59
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,381
HE IS PERFECT.

60
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,950
>> LOOK HOW NICE YOUR

61
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,284
PARENTS.

62
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:36,318
THEY ARE NOT SCREAMING AND

63
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:36,785
GOING WILD.

64
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,387
>> I HAVE KNOWN KANYE A

65
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:39,121
LITTLE BIT.

66
00:01:39,121 --> 00:00:00,000
I GET ALONG WITH KANYE.
