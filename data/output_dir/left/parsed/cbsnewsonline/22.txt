CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, A VERY TOUGH COOKIE,
CHUCK GRASSLEY.
THANK YOU, CHUCK.
THANK YOU.
GREAT MAN, GREAT PERSON.
FROM THE VERY FIRST MINUTE BRETT
KAVANAUGH WAS NOMINATED RADICAL
DEMOCRATS WERE ON A MISSION TO
RESIST, OBSTRUCT, DELAY,
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY.
THEY WANT TO DESTROY THAT MAN
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY ME
TOO BUT THAT'S OKAY.
ME WE UNDERSTAND.
HIM, HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?
THEY WANT TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.
THAT'S ALL THEY'RE GOOD AT.
RESISTING.
THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS RESIST.
OURS IS TO CREATE.
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID TO BRETT
AND HIS BEAUTIFUL FAMILY IS A
NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT, A
NATIONAL DISGRACE.
YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND YOU
SEE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM.
YOU SEE.
INCLUDING THE PHONY PROTESTERS
THAT GOT PAID, AND NOW THEY WANT
TO PROTEST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
GET PAID YET AND THEY WANT THEIR
MONEY.
SO NOW THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY
PROTEST.
YOU SEE, THAT'S A REAL PROTEST.
BUT IN JUST FOUR WEEKS YOU WILL
HAVE THE CHANCE TO RENDER YOUR
VEFSHTH ON THE DEMOCRATS --
VERDICT ON THE DEMOCRAT'S
OUTRAGEOUS CONDUCT.
ON NOVEMBER 6TH, AND YOU CAN DO
EARLY VOTING IN IOWA.
GO.
JUST VOTE.
GET IT OVER WITH.
VOTE.
GO VOTE.
EARLY VOTING STARTED TODAY,
RIGHT?
TODAY.
EARLY VOTE.
GO DO IT IMMEDIATELY.
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO
ME ANYMORE TONIGHT.
IN FACT, IF YOU DID EARLY VOTING
ALREADY, GO HOME, HAVE A GOOD
TIME.
THANK YOU.
WE'LL LET SOME ADDITIONAL PEOPLE
FROM OUTSIDE IN, RIGHT?
NO, THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT NEVER CHANGES.
COULD I ASK THE CAMERAS TO JUST
TAKE A SWOOP OF THIS ROOM
PLEASE?
THEY DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT.
THEY DON'T LIKE TO -- THEY LIKE
TO KEEP THAT CAMERA DEAD SET ON
ME AND ABOUT SIX PEOPLE IN THE
BACKGROUND.
ALL WEARING HATS SAYING MAKE
FARMERS GREAT AGAIN AND WE'RE
DOING IT -- WE'RE A LITTLE BIT
EARLY, SO I SHOULDN'T BE SAYING
IT NOW.
WE'RE GOING WITH 515 YEAR ROUND,
OKAY -- E15 YEAR ROUND, OKAY?
I MADE THAT PROMISE TO YOU
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
I MADE THAT PROMISE TO YOU
DURING THE PRIMARIES, REMEMBER?
I MADE THAT PROMISE.
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.
RIGHT?
ON NOVEMBER 6TH, YOU HAVE THE
CHANCE TO STOP THE RADICAL
DEMOCRATS BY ELECTING A
REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A
REPUBLICAN SENATE.
SO WE NEED THE VOTES.
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT IF ONE
PERSON HAS A COLD WE HAVE TO
HOLD THE VOTE.
WE DON'T HAVE -- IT'S LIKE WE
HARDLY HAVE A MAJORITY.
WE NEED VOTES.
EARLY VOTING IS NOW UNDERWAY.
AND YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT EARLY VOTING.
GO OUT NOW AND VOTE.
LEAVE HERE NOW IMMEDIATELY.
IS IT STILL OPEN?
YES.
GET THE OUT OF HERE.
EARLY VOTING.
AND IN THEIR LUST FOR POWER, THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOTALLY
UNHINGED.
THEY'VE GONE CRAZY.
NO, THEY'VE GONE CRAZY.
NOW THE DEMOCRATS, OR AS SOME
PEOPLE WOULD SAY, THE DIMS, THE
DIMS.
WHO SAYS THAT?
LOU TO BEBS, THE -- LOU DOBBS,
THE GREAT LOU DOBBS.
SEAN HANNITY SAYS THAT.
THE DIMS.
JUDGE JANINE SAYS THAT, DOESN'T
SHE?
LAURA, LAURA, HOW COULD HAS
LAURA BEEN, RIGHT?
WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE.
DO WE LIKE TUCKER?
I LIKE TUCKER.
HE SAYS IT.
HOW ABOUT STEVE DUCEY?
HOW ABOUT BRIAN?
WE GOT A LOT OF GREAT FRIENDS.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN TALKING
ABOUT DOING REALLY BAD THINGS
NOW TO JUSTICE KAVANAUGH.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT?
AND PACKING THE COURTS WITH
RADICAL JUDGES TO OVERRULE THE
WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, FOLKS.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
LAST WEEK THEY'R SAYING WE'LL
IMPEACH HIM.
IMPEACH HIM FOR WHAT?
FOR WHAT?
BESIDES THAT I HAVE TO GO FIRST,
RIGHT?
DON'T I HAVE TO GO?
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE DONE NOTHING
WRONG OTHER THAN CREATE ONE OF
THE GREATEST ECONOMIES IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
THAT'LL BE INTERESTING.
YOU GET IMPEACHED FOR HAVING
CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
THE BEST JOB NUMBERS IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, JUST
ABOUT.
RIGHT?
THE GREATEST TRADE DEALS WHICH
WE'VE JUST FINISHED IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
THE BIGGEST REGULATORY CUTS, BY
FAR, ALREADY IN LESS THAN TWO
CLEARS.
BIGGER THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT
DURING THEIR ENTIRE TERM OR
TERMS.
THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN REFORMS.
YOU GOT A LOT OF MONEY BACK IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME
TOO EXTREME, AND THEY'VE BECOME,
FRANKLY, TOO DANGEROUS TO
GOVERN.
THEY'VE GONE WHACKO.
THEY'VE GONE SO FAR LEFT THAT
THEY CONSIDER POCAHONTAS TO BE A
RATIONAL PERSON.
IT'S CRAZY.
ELIZABETH WARREN.
OH, I HOPE SHE RUNS.
I HOPE SHE RUNS.
THEN WE CAN FINALLY GET DOWN TO
THE FACT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
SHE HAS INDIAN BLOOD.
BECAUSE SO FAR SHE'S NOT DOING
TOO WELL.
HER MOTHER SAYS SHE HAS HIGH
CHEEKBONES.
THAT'S WHY.
AND SHE'S GOTTEN A LOT OF
ADVANTAGES BY FALSELY CLAIMING
WHAT SHE'S CLAIMED.
SO I HOPE SHE'S ONE OF THE
FINALISTS.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOCK TOO
MANY OF THEM, BECAUSE MAYBE BY
DOING I'LL KNOCK THEM ALL OUT
EARLY.
AND I'LL ACTUALLY END UP
SOMEBODY THAT'S GOT SOME TALENT.
THEY WOULDN'T BE GOOD.
SO WE HAVE TO BE NICE AND QUIET.
I SHOULD BE REALLY QUIET.
REALLY REALLY QUIET ON THE BAD
ONES.
ON THE BAD ONES.
LIKE WE WON'T TALK ABOUT CORY
BOOKER WHO RAN NEWARK INTO THE
GROUND.
WE WON'T TALK ABOUT DA NANG DICK
WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE PEOPLE FOR
15 YEARS THAT HE WAS A GREAT WAR
HERO.
THEY WERE GOING DOWN LEFT, THEY
WERE GOING DOWN RIGHT.
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS.
BLUMENTHAL.
HE SAID THEY WERE GOING DOWN ON
MY LEFT.
THEY WERE GOING DOWN.
HE WAS IN DA NANG PROVINCE,
EXCEPT THE ONE PROBLEM, IT'S
HARD TO BE THERE BECAUSE HE WAS
NEVER IN VEET NAMG.
BUT THESE -- VIETNAM.
BUT THESE ARE MINOR DETAILS.
THEN HE GETS UP AND SAYS I
DEMAND TOTAL HONESTY AND
TRANSPARENCY.
HE WANTS HONESTY.
GREAT WAR HERO.
HE'S A GREAT HERO.
YEAH.
RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT SENATE TOR FEINSTEIN?
-- SENATOR FEINSTEIN?
THAT'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.
THAT'S A BEAUTY.
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENTS?
WHAT?
NO, I DIDN'T DO IT.
DID WE LEAK THEM?
DID WE LEAK?
NO, NO.
NO WE DIDN'T.
DID YOU EVER SEE, NO.
HE JUST SAID NO WE DIDN'T LEAK.
AND I THINK THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT FEINSTEIN.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
NOW, WAS THAT THE WORST BODY
LANGUAGE HONESTLY.
IN OTHER WORDS, DID SHE LEAK IT?
100%.
NO, NO.
I DON'T WANT TO GET SUED.
99%.
SEE, NOW I CAN'T GET SUED.
YOU DON'T HAND MATCHES TO AN
ARSONIST.
AND YOU DON'T GIVE POWER TO AN
ANGRY LEFT WING MOB.
AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE BECOME.
THEY WOULD TURN OUR COUNTRY SO
FAST INTO VENEZUELA.
AND VENEZUELA'S NOT DOING TOO
WELL, FOLKS.
IF YOU WANT TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,
YOU MUST DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS OR
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE OF
A SWAMP.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,
AMERICA IS BOOMING.
AMERICA IS THRIVING.
AND AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN
LIKE NEVER BEFORE BECAUSE WE ARE
FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.
THE NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
HAS FALLEN TO 3.7%.
YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?
3.7%.
THE LOWEST IN 50 YEARS.
5-0, 50.
AND IT'S GOING BETTER.
IT'S GOING BETTER.
IOWA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 2.5%
AMONG THE LOWEST IN ITS HISTORY.
AND BY THE WAY, WE NEED PEOPLE
HELPING YOU.
WE NEED PEOPLE COMING IN.
WE NEED PEOPLE TO RUN THE FARMS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE
COMING IN.
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN
LEGALLY.
AND THEY'RE GOING TO COME IN
THROUGH MERIT.
IT'S CALLED THE MERIT SYSTEM.
AND WE BUILT THE WALL.
WE STARTED.
A LOT OF IT IS GETTING DONE NOW.
WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION AND ANOTHER
$1.6 BILLION.
AND ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION.
I WANT THEM TO GIVE US THE MONEY
SO WE CAN -- WE CAN BUILD IT IN
A YEAR.
A LOT OF IT, IT'S GOING UP RIGHT
NOW.
BUT YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS FEEL
THAT THAT'S ONE THING WE REALLY
WANT.
WE GOT OUR MONEY FOR THE
MILITARY, $700 BILLION.
WE GOT OUR MONEY TO HELP US OUT
WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS, $6
BILLION.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE WALL,
THEY FEEL WE WANT IT SO BADLY.
BUT WE KEEP GETTING BIG CHUNKS,
AND IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
WE'RE GOING TO GET IT FINISHED
SOONER THAN ANYONE CAN BELIEVE.
AND IF YOU CAN GET ME SOME
REPUBLICANS, WE'LL GET IT DONE
QUICKLY, QUICKLY.
I MEAN WHEN I HAVE TO ASK NANCY
PELOSI AND MAXINE WATERS, MAXINE
WATERS.
CAN WE BUILD A WALL, MAXINE?
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT WALL
BUILT.
SHE DOESN'T WANT A WALL BUILT.
CAN WE BUILD IT?
HOW ABOUT PELOSI?
WE WANT TO BUILD A WALL.
NO, I DON'T WANT THAT WALL
BUILT.
LOOK.
IOWA MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE
GROWING AT THE FASTEST RATE AT
MORE THAN -- IN MORE THAN 20
YEARS.
AND IF YOU REMEMBER, THE LAST
ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT
MENTIONING NAMES, THE LAST
ADMINISTRATION SAID
MANUFACTURING JOBS, THEY'RE
DEAD.
THEY'RE GONE.
WE HAVE 600,000 HAVE COME BACK
SINCE THE ELECTION.
600,000.
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW WORKING
THAN EVER BEFORE.
THINK OF THAT.
AT THIS POINT TODAY, THIS DAY,
WE HAVE MORE AMERICANS BY FAR
WORKING RIGHT NOW WORKING THAN
HAVE EVER WORKED IN OUR COUNTRY
BEFORE.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
TEED I KEPT ANOTHER -- TODAY I
KEPT ANOTHER MAJOR PROMISE, AS I
SAID, TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA AND
NEBRASKA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I GOT TO DO THAT AGAIN.
I GOT TO DO THAT AGAIN.
I LOVE NEBRASKA.
YOU KNOW, WE WON IOWA.
WE WON NEBRASKA.
BUT THEY SAID, SIR, YOU'RE
SPEAKING IN IOWA, BUT WE'LL HAVE
PEOPLE FROM NEBRASKA.
LIKE I SAID, NEBRASKA.
OKAY, SO WE HAVE BOTH.
BY THE WAY, WE HAVE BOTH GREAT
GOVERNORS HERE.
AND I DID THAT JUST IN CASE.
SO READY?
I'M GOING TO GO IOWA FIRST.
THEN I'M GOING TO GO NEBRASKA.
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHO THE
I'M SPEAKING TO, OKAY?
BECAUSE THAT WAS A LITTLE
SHOCKING WHAT I JUST HEARD.
SO I'M GOING TO GO -- I'M JUST
CURIOUS, OKAY.
IOWA.
NEBRASKA.
UNBELIEVABLE.
SO THEY SAID, SIR, YOU'RE
SPEAKING IN IOWA, THERE MAY BE A
FEW PEOPLE COMING IN FROM
NEBRASKA.
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
GREAT GOING FELLOWS.
GREAT GOING.
I'LL TELL MY STAFF, GREAT GOING
FELLOWS.
DOESN'T MATTER.
WE LOVE BOTH.
WHO CARES?
RIGHT?
WHO CARES?
WE LOVE THEM.
ALL I KNOW IS YOU'VE GOT A LOT
OF FARMERS IN BOTH, RIGHT?
AND MY ADMINISTRATION IS
PROTECTING ETHANOL.
ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
TODAY WE ARE UNLEASHING THE
POWER OF E15 TO FUEL OUR COUNTRY
ALL YEAR LONG.
NOEIGHT MONTHS.
ALL YEAR LONG.
THE DEMS WILL END ETHANOL.
YOU KNOW THAT.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO APPROVE
ETHANOL.
THEY WILL TAKE IT AWAY.
WILL TRY TO MAKE IT LIKE THEY
CAN'T DO IT.
BUT THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO TAKE
IT AWAY IF YOU GIVE THEM THE --
SO YOU BETTER GET OUT THERE AND
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.
WE'VE ALSO ACHIEVED ANOTHER
HISTORIC VICTORY FOR IOWA
FARMERS AND RANCHERS BY
REPLACING THE JOB-KILLING NAFTA
WITH AN INCREDIBLE, BRAND NEW,
U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT.
THE USMCA.
BUT IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL,
THEY WILL TRY TO REVERSE OUR
AMAZING PROGRESS AND PLUNGE OUR
COUNTRY INTO GRIDLOCK, FRANKLY,
INTO POVERTY, ULTIMATELY INTO
CHAOS.
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD IT LIKE IT'S
BEEN NOW.
WE HAVE NEVER HAD IT LIKE IT IS
NOW.
LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY YOU PEOPLE
ARE MAKING.
WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING TO DO
WITH IT?
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR
TAXES, IMPOSE SOCIALISM,
DISMANTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT,
ELIMINATE I.C.E., AND GET RID OF
AMERICAN BORDERS.
YOU WANT TO GET RID OF THE
BORDERS, RIGHT?
YOU WON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.
AND I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS, AND I
MEAN IT, DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY
OF CRIME.
THEY ARE.
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF
SAFETY.
WE ARE ALSO THE PARTY OF JOBS,
JOBS, JOBS.
NOW, WE ARE THRILLED TO BE
JOINED TONIGHT BY A NUMBER OF
TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS.
IOWA CONGRESSMAN STEVE KING.
WHERE'S STEVE?
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS STEVE?
WHERE IS HE?
I WISH YOU COULD GET A LITTLE
BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?
HE MAY BE, WE'RE ALL -- HE MAY
BE THE WORLD'S MOST CONSERVATIVE
HUMAN BEING.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
AND I SUPPORTED HIM LONG BEFORE
I BECAME A POLITICIAN.
DO I HAVE TO USE THAT TERM?
AM I A POLITICIAN?
THANK YOU, STEVE.

GENTLEMAN, SO MUCH HELP TO ME,

HE HELPED, BUT I DID EVEN BETTER
THAN HIM.
YOU STILL NEED A PRODUCT, RIGHT?
BUT WE DID GREAT.
AND WE LOVE THE PEOPLE OF IOWA.
WE TOOK NEBRASKA EQUALLY.
BY A LOT.
BY A LOT.
THAT WASN'T CLOSE.
IOWA GOP CHAIR, FRIEND OF MINE,
JEFF CALFMAN.
THANK YOU, JEFF, THANK YOU.
GREAT JOB, JEFF.
GET READY, JEFF.
WE'RE COMING BACK SOON, JEFF.
AND FROM NEBRASKA, WHERE'S TOM
OSBOURNE?
WHERE IS HE?
I DON'T KNOW TOM OSBOURNE.
ALL I KNOW, IT'S TOM OSBOURNE,
RIGHT?
ALL I KNOW IS FOR YEARS ALL HE
KNEW HOW TO DO IS WIN, WIN.
JUST WIN.
I MEAN HOW GOOD A COACH WAS THAT
GUY?
AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW HIM, NEVER
MET HIM.
BUT IT'S CALLED NO TALK, ALL
ACTION.
ISN'T THAT NICE?
EVERY YEAR YOU WON.
YOU BETTER GET GOING NEBRASKA
BUT WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO'S
DONE A FANTASTIC JOB.
HE'S SO INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS INCLUDING CUTTING YOUR
TAXES.

OF WORDS BECAUSE SHE HAS BECOME
A REAL STAR IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY AND IN POLITICS.

THE MIDWEST HAS A PARTNER IN THE
WHITE HOUSE WITH PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP.
WOOOO.
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE HONOR TO
SERVE AS THE 43RD GOVERNOR OF
THIS GREAT STATE.
AND MY STORY IS THE IOWA STORY.
IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST HERE.
WHERE A SMALL TOWN GIRL,
DAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER AND
FARMER WHO WAITED TABLES,
CHECKED GROCERIES, NEVER GAVE UP
ON HER DREAM OF GETTING A
COLLEGE DEGREE IS STANDING
BEFORE YOU TODAY AS THE FIRST
FEMALE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
IOWA.
I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT
EVERYDAY IOWANS HAVE FACED
BECAUSE I FACED THEM MYSELF.
I'M PROUD WE FOCUSED ON CUTTING
TAXES, EXPANDING AND GROWING
JOBS AND WAGES AND
OPPORTUNITIES, ADDRESSING IOWA'S
HEALTH CARE NEEDS, AND CREATING
STRONG AND SAFE COMMUNITIES.

LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT, THIRD BEST
MANAGED, WAGES ARE GOING UP,

BORDERS.
DOESN'T WANT ANY.
ONLY WANTS TO MASSIVELY RAISE
YOUR TAXES, HE WANTS TO TAKE
AWAY YOUR ETHANOL.

THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR
PROMISE, MR. PRESIDENT.
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY, 4.2%
GROWTH, 3.7% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HERE.
INCREDIBLE THINGS ARE HAPPENING
FOLKS.
ALLOWING HARDWORKING IOWANS TO
KEEP THEIR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS.

AND MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ARE

THANK YOU FOR THAT.
HEY FOLKS, ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT
CHOICES, RIGHT?
WE CAN KEEP MOVING FORWARD OR WE
CAN ALLOW NANCY PELOSI AND HER
HAND-PICKED CANDIDATES TO TAKE
US BACKWARDS.
WE CANNOT GO BACKWARDS TO HIGHER
TAXES, MORE GOVERNMENT, A WEAKER
MILITARY, AND THE FAILED
POLICIES OF THE PAST.
I NEED YOUR SUPPORT.
WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT.
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS.
NOVEMBER 6TH, VOTE.
GO TO DAVIDYOUNGFORIOWA.COM TO
VOLUNTEER.
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS THIS
GREAT COUNTRY, GOD BLESS IOWA.
GOD BLESS YOU.
>> THANK YOU, DAVID.
A VOTE FOR DAVID'S FAR LEFT
OPPONENT, CINDY TAX ME.
REMEMBER THAT NAME, CINDY TAX
ME.
IT'S A VERY GOOD NAME FOR HER.
I GUESS IT'S ACTUALLY AXNE.
BUT WE CALL HER TAX ME.
THAT WAS SO EASY.
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT ONE, BUT I
DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S THOUGHT
OF IT.
BUT THAT'S LIKE A NATURAL.
IS A VOTE FOR THE RADICAL AGENDA
OF PELOSI AND SCHUMER, AND OF
COURSE MAXINE WATERS.
TAX ME OPPOSED OUR MASSIVE TAX
CUTS.
THAT'S WHY HER NAME.
SHE WAS BORN WITH THE RIGHT
NAME.
AND SHE WANTS A SOCIALIST
TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE WHICH IS
GOING TO DESTROY OUR ENTIRE
CITY.
CINDY AXNE IS TOTALLY CONTROLLED
BY PELOSI AND THE EXTREME
WASHINGTON LIBERALS WHO ARE
BANKROLLING HER CAMPAIGN.
TOTALLY BANKROLLING HER
CAMPAIGN.
IF YOU WANT TO STOP NANCY PELOSI
FROM BECOMING -- CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS -- THE SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE, THEN YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR
DAVID YOUNG WHO IS A TERRIFIC,
TERRIFIC GUY.
TERRIFIC GUY.
AND YOU ALSO NEED TO VOTE FOR A
GREAT FRIEND OF MINE WHO REALLY
THROUGH JUST FORCE OF WILL GOT
US TO PUT UP MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO BUILD A DAM TO STOP YOUR
FLOODING IN A VERY IMPORTANT
PART OF IOWA, CONGRESSMAN ROD
BLUM.
GREAT GUY.
AND I HAVE TO SAY, ROD IS
FIGHTING TO REFORM WELFARE,
REDUCE CRIME, AND CONTINUOUSLY
CUT YOUR TAXES.
ROD'S OPPONENT, ABBY
FINKENHAUER.
WHO THE IS THAT?
WHO IS THAT?
IS AN EXTREME LIBERAL WHO
SUPPORTS MASS AM NETSTY.
ANYBODY -- AMNESTY.
ANYBODY LIKE AMNESTY?
FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS.
WANTS TO RAISE YOUR TAXES
THROUGH THE ROOF.
AND WANTS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR
HEALTH CARE.
SO YOU GOT TO VOTE FOR ROD BLUM.
GOT TO VOTE FOR DAVID YOUNG.
YOU GOT TO VOTE FOR THESE TWO
CHARACTERS OVER HERE WHO HAVE
BEEN -- WE DON'T EVEN BRING THEM
UP BECAUSE THEY'RE LEADING BY SO
MUCH.
I SAID I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE
THE TIME.
BUT GET OUT AND VOTE ANYWAY,
JUST IN CASE.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
YOU NEVER KNOW.
A MAJORITY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS
HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR A
SOCIALIST HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT
WOULD OBLITERATE HEALTH CARE AND
ELIMINATE MEDICARE ADVANTAGE FOR
20 MILLION SENIORS.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE.
WE'RE PROTECTING IT FOR OUR
GREAT SENIORS WHO HAVE EARNED IT
AND PAID FOR IT ALL OF THEIR
LIVES.
RIGHT?
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS.
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS.
THE DEMOCRAT AGENDA IS RADICAL
SOCIALISM AND OPEN BORDERS.
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY IS TO ABOLISH I.C.E.
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR
I.C.E., THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY,
BUT THEY'RE VERY TOUGH PEOPLE.
GUESS WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF MS-13, ALL THE GANGS.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
EVEN YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT EITHER.
THEY ARE FANTASTIC PEOPLE.
THEY LOVE OUR COUNTRY.
AND TO THEM IT'S A DAY IN THE
OFFICE.
FOR OTHER PEOPLE THEY WANT NO
PART OF IT.
THEY WANT TO TURN AMERICA, THESE
DEMOCRATS, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY
WANT INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY FOR
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND THE MS-13
KILLERS.
THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE
COUNTRY, BY THE WAY, BY THE
THOUSANDS.
THOUSANDS.
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER TOWNS IN LONG
ISLAND.
I MEAN LITERALLY.
COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR COMMUNITY.
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER TOWNS IN LONG
ISLAND.
AND WE GO IN AND LIKE LIBERATE
THE TOWNS.
CAN YOU BELIEVE?
TOWNS THAT I GREW UP RIGHT NEXT
TO.
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY GO IN
AND THEY HAVE NO FEAR.
AND THEY TAKE CARE OF THE
SITUATION.
THEY GET THEM THE OUT OF
THERE OR THEY PUT THEM IN JAIL.
THEY EITHER SEND THEM BACK WHERE
THEY CAME FROM OR THEY PUT THEM
IN JAIL.
AND THEY LIBERATE -- CAN YOU
IMAGINE WE'RE SAYING THIS ABOUT
MRAESS IN OUR KUN -- PLACES IN
OUR COUNTRY?
THEY LIBERATE TOWNS AND SMALL
CITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES OF
LONG ISLAND AND OTHERS.
THEY LIBERATE THEM LIKE WE'RE
TAKING OVER IN A WAR, AND WE GET
LIBERATED.
HOW SAD, HOW PATHETIC.
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE I.C.E.
IT
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
SO WE HAVE TO CHERISH OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
THE DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION
POLICIES RESPECT JUST WRONG,
THEY'RE LETHAL.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR
CRIMINAL AMERICANS THAT SNEAK
INTO OUR COUNTRY.
AND REPUBLICANS STAND PROUDLY
WITH THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF
I.C.E.
AND BORDER PATROL AND OUR
GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT, INCLUDING
YOUR GREAT LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SAFE
COMMUNITIES, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
A BORDER, THEN YOU MUST
ORGANIZE, REMEMBER THIS, YOU
DON'T HAVE A BORDER YOU DON'T
HAVE A COUNTRY FOLKS, OKAY?
LET'S FACE IT.
LET'S FACE IT.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING THINGS
THAT ARE INCREDIBLE OUTSIDE, BUT
THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH NORTH KOREA.
THEY WERE READY TO GO TO WAR
WITH NORTH KOREA.
NOW WE'RE GETTING ALONG VERY
NICELY.
IT'S WORKING OUT VERY WELL.
LOOK AT IRAN.
BEFORE I GOT THERE, IRAN WAS
GOING TO TAKE OVER THE MIDDLE
EAST IN LIKE 12 MINUTES, RIGHT?
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SURVIVE.
THEY GOT RIOTS IN EVERY CITY.
SO IF YOU WANT TO REALLY JUST
KEEP UP WHAT WE'RE DOING AND
KEEP THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE DOING WELL, BUT
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO
.
WHEN WE GET RID OF THESE
HORRIBLE, DISGUSTING TRADE DEALS
WITH CHINA.
OVER THE LAST FIVE, SIX YEARS
WE'VE BEEN LOSING $300 BILLION
TO $5 00 BILLION A YEAR -- $500
BILLION A YEAR, NOBODY EVEN
KNOWS WHAT THE IT IS IT'S
SO MUCH.
IT'S ENDING.
IT'S ENDING.
IT'S ENDING.
AND IT'S NOT JUST CHINA.
IT'S NOT JUST CHINA.
AND WHAT WE DO IS WE PROTECT
WEALTHY COUNTRIES FOR NOTHING.
FOR NOTHING.
WOULD YOU SAY SAUDI ARABIA IS
WEALTHY?
YEAH.
RIGHT?
AND I SAID TO THE KING, YOU GOT
TO PAY.
I'M SORRY, YOU GOT TO PAY.
WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT YOU, YOU
GOT TO PAY.
GET THE MONEY.
YOU GOT TO PAY.
I HAVE FRIENDS IN THE AUDIENCE,
GOOD BUSINESSMEN, THEY'RE
LOOKING ABSOLUTELY.
BUT YOU'RE NOT A POLITICIAN, YOU
GOT TO PAY.
JAPAN IS AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY
COUNTRY.
GREAT PEOPLE.
PRIME MINISTER ABE IS A FRIEND
OF MINE, BUT I SAID LOOK, WE'RE
PROTECTING JAPAN.
THEY'RE SENDING US MILLIONS OF
CARS.
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SEND THEM.
THEY HAVE BARRIERS.
WE AN'T SEND THEM CARS, BUT
THEY SEND MILLIONS OF CARS INTO
HERE.
THEY PAY ESSENTIALLY NO TAX.
AND WE SUBSIDIZE THEIR MILITARY.
WHEN I SAY SUBSIDIZE, I DON'T
MEAN 2%.
WE PAY FOR 70% OF THEIR
MILITARY.
NOBODY KNOWS THIS.
AND I SAID TO THE PRIME MINISTER
WHO'S A GREAT GUY, I SAID, HOW
COME?
AND HE HONESTLY SAYS, NOBODY
EVER ASKED.
WHEN WE STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS, WE
HAVE SO MUCH POTENTIAL.
AND THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES
LIKE THAT.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT JUST THOSE
TWO.
THERE ARE MANY MANY COUNTRIES
LIKE THAT.
AND WE SHOULD PROTECT PEOPLE
THAT CAN'T PROTECT THEMSELVES
AND THEY'RE GETTING SLAUGHTERED.
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.
AND WE'RE NOW BUILDING BY FAR
THE STRONGEST MILITARY THAT
WE'VE EVER HAD.
AND THE REASON IS -- AND THE
REASON IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE
STRONGEST MILITARY EVER IN THE
HISTORY OF THIS WORLD, NOBODY'S
GOING TO MESS WITH YOU.
THESE BIG GUYS KNOW IT OVER
HERE.
THESE PEOPLE KNOW IT.
I DON'T WANT TO USE MY MILITARY,
BUT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS
WORLD.
THIS IS A SICK WORLD IN MANY
WAYS, OKAY?
IT'S A VERY VERY -- I MEAN I SEE
THINGS AS PRESIDENT THAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.
THE THINGS THAT I SEE, YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.
WE HAVE TO BE ON GUARD FOR SOME
REALLY TREACHEROUS PEOPLE THAT
ARE RUNNING SOME PLACES AND WE
ARE SO PREPARED YOU HAVE NO
IDEA.
WE ARE SO PREPARED.
WE ARE SO PREPARED.
BECAUSE THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT
SECURITY AND IT'S ALSO ABOUT
PROSPERITY.
SINCE THE ELECTION, SEAL TEAM IS
RIGHT.
WHO'S SEAL TEAM?
GOOD LOOKING GUY OVER THERE.
THAT'S GOOD.
SEAL TEAM, THEY'RE GREAT.
BUT SINCE THE ELECTION, WE'VE
CREATED -- NOBODY BELIEVES THIS
-- IF I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THIS
WHEN I CAME TO IOWA MANY TIMES,
OR WHEN I CAME TO NEBRASKA MANY
TIMES WITH YOUR GOVERNOR, WITH
YOUR GOVERNOR, IF I WOULD HAVE
SAID WE WOULD CREATE 4.2 MILLION
NEW JOBS, THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,
LOOK AT THIS LIKE THE ACADEMY
AWARDS BACK THERE.
LOOK.
THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID,
OH, WHAT HE'S SAYING, OH, IT'S
-- WELL, GUESS WHAT?
WE CREATED 4.2 MILLION JOBS JUST
SINCE THE ELECTION.
AND WE LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION
PEOPLE OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.
HOW GOOD IS THAT?
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY HALF A
MILLION MANUFACTURING JOBS.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER
RECORDED IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY.
AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER
RECORDED.
AND KANYE WEST, WHO GETS IT, AND
BIG JIM BROWN.
HOW DO YOU THINK HE'D DO IN THE
NFL TODAY?
THE GREATEST.
BUT THEY'RE COMING OVER TO THE
WHITE HOUSE VERY SHORTLY.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE
LUNCH AND TALK ABOUT IT.
BUT THEY GET IT.
HOW DO YOU WIN WHEN YOU HEAR
THOSE NUMBERS?
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS FOR 100
YEARS HAVE BEEN PROMISING
AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
HISPANIC-AMERICANS, ASIANS,
THEY'VE BEEN PROMISING
EVERYTHING.
NOTHING HAPPENS.
HERE WE ARE LESS THAN TWO YEARS,
THE BEST EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS.
THE BEST NUMBERS THEY'VE EVER
HAD IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY.
EVERY CATEGORY.
HISPANIC-AMERICAN AND
ASIAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
RATES HAVE ALSO REACHED ALL TIME
LOWS.
HOW DO YOU BEAT US IN 2020?
GOVERNOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
WE'RE GOING TO DO A GREAT JOB.
BUT WE HAVE THE BEST NUMBERS
EVER RECORDED.
THOSE DEBATES I LOOK FORWARD TO.
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO THAT.
REMEMBER?
WHAT THE DO YOU HAVE TO
LOSE, REMEMBER THAT?
RIGHT?
I SAID WE WERE GOING TO DO IT.
BUT NOW WE'VE DONE IT.
SO HOW'S SOMEBODY GOING TO DO
BETTER?
BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO MUCH
BETTER THAN EVEN THAT.
WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST
FELL TO 3.6%.
WHICH IS THE LOWEST IN MORE THAN
65 YEARS.
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING.
WE HAVE FINALIZED A NEW FAIR
TRADE DEAL FOR SOUTH KOREA.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
WE JUST DID A DEAL,
MANUFACTURERS, FARMERS, THE DEAL
WAS SO BAD.
THAT WAS A HILLARY CLINTON DEAL.
SHE SAID, NO NO, SHE WAS
SECRETARY OF STATE.
SHE MADE A STATEMENT TODAY.
SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE DOING A
TOUR OR SOMETHING.
AND SHE MADE A STATEMENT, SOME
RIDICULOUS.
I SAID THAT'S WHY SHE LOST THE
ELECTION.
SHE DOESN'T GET IT.
SHE NEVER GOT IT.
SHE SAID WE WILL CREATE 250,000
JOBS.
AND EVERYBODY WAS EXCITED.
UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WAS RIGHT,
BUT IT WAS CREATED IN SOUTH
KOREA, NOT IN OUR COUNTRIES.
JUST ANOTHER DEAL, CHECK IT OFF.
JUST ANOTHER HORRIBLE DEAL.
WE WILL CREATE 250,000 -- YOU
KNOW IF SHE SAID FOR SOUTH
KOREA?
AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
HONEST, RIGHT?
BUT WE'VE TOTALLY RENEGOTIATED
IT.
UNDER THE GUISE OF MASSIVE
TARIFFS.
THEY SAID LET'S DO IT, COME ON.
LET'S DO IT, LET'S MAKE A DECENT
DEAL.
AND WE'VE OPENED IT UP FOR YOUR
FARMERS, FOR YOUR MANUFACTURERS.
WE'VE TAKEN A HORRIBLE DEAL AND
MADE IT A GOOD DEAL.
MADE IT A GOOD DEAL.
AND NOW WE'RE OPENING UP, OR
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING
WHERE WE DO EVEN BETTER, BUT
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP JAPAN FOR
TRADE AND THE EUROPEAN UNION
WHICH IS BRUTAL.
THEY ARE BRUTAL.
SOUNDS SO NICE, SO NICE.
THE EUROPEAN UNION.
SOUNDS SO NICE, RIGHT?
THEY ARE BRUTAL.
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD
THEIR WAY.
THEY FORMED IN ORDER TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF US ON TRADE.
NOW, WE PROTECT MOST OF THOSE
COUNTRY, EUROPEAN UNION, NATO,
WE PROTECT MOST.
SO GERMANY IS PAYING 1%.
WE ARE PAYING 4.3% TO PROTECT
EUROPE.
EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME, PLEASE.
THE NUMBERS ARE HORRIFIC.
BUT I'VE GOTTEN $44 BILLION LAST
YEAR MORE PAID INTO NATO BY
OTHER COUNTRIES.
AND THIS YEAR WILL BE MORE THAN
THAT.
THAT'S WHY I SAY OUR COUNTRY HAS
SUCH INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL.
THERE'S SO MANY -- I MEAN I
COULD GO THROUGH DEAL -- I COULD
GO THROUGH SO MANY THINGS, JUST
THE SAME THING.
THEY WERE GOING TO BUILD THE
EMBASSY IN ISRAEL.
AS YOU KNOW, WE GOT APPROVED.
RIGHT?
ON MY DESK WAS A DOCUMENT TO GET
READY TO SPEND OVER $1 BILLION
TO BUILD A BUILDING.
I SAID HOW DO YOU SPEND A
BILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND A
BUILDING?
I DIDN'T LOOK, BUT PROBABLY ONE
STORY, IT'S AN EMBASSY, TWO
STORIES, A BILLION DOLLARS.
AND I SAID MAYBE WE CAN GET A
BUILDING AND RENOVATE IT AND FIX
IT UP REAL FAST AND WHO KNOWS.
AND OUR GREAT AMBASSADOR TO
ISRAEL, DAVID FREEDMAN CALLED.
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE
BEST SITE IN JERUSALEM AND
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING ON
IT.
AND WE CAN TAKE JUST A BIG
CORNER OF THAT BUILDING, FIKTS
IT UP, AND INSTEAD OF -- FIX IT
UP, AND INSTEAD OF WAITING 15 OR
20 YEARS, WE CAN HAVE IT IN
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS, SIR.
I SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S THE
BEST?
THE BUILDING IS GOOD, BUT WE
HAVE TO RENOVATE.
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A BILLION
AND PROBABLY NEVER GET IT OPEN.
IT WOULD END UP COSTING THREE OR
FOUR BILLION.
PROBABLY ONE-THIRD THE SIZE OF
THIS ROOM.
THEY'LL SPEND $2 BILLION.
I SAID DAVID, HOW MUCH IS IT
GOING TO COST AND HOW GOOD IS
THE SITE?
THE SITE'S GREAT.
AND THE BUILDING IS SET WAY BACK
FOR PURPOSES OF SECURITY.
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE
SIDEWALK, CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.
HE SAID SIR, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
AND IT'S A BIG SITE.
I SAID HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO
COST?
HE SAID, SIR, IT'S GOING TO COST
ABOUT $18,000.
I TOLD -- $180,000.
I TOLD HIM -- THINK OF IT.
TRUE.
$108,000.
FIRST TIME -- $180,000.
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I'VE EVER
DONE THIS.
DON'T GET ANGRY AT ME.
I SAID DAVID, IT'S TOO CHEAP, IT
DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
I NEVER DID THAT BEFORE.
I NEVER DID IT BEFORE.
LIKE I LIKE TO SAY, LIKE AIR
FORCE ONE, WE GAVE OUT THE
CONTRACT.
THEY WERE GOING TO GIVE IT OUT
FOR $1.6 BILLION MORE THAN I
GAVE IT OUT FOR.
I SAID TO BOEING, I'M NOT GOING
TO PAY THAT PRICE.
AND I SAID I'M NOT PAYING IT.
CANCEL THE CONTRACT.
I'M NOT PAYING IT.
AND I HELD A LINE.
I SAID YOU GOT TO TAKE OFF $1.8
BILLION.
SUPPOSEDLY WE TOOK OFF $1.6
BILLION.
WE HAVE A DEAL.
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T.
I SAID CUT IT IN HALF.
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE WHOLE DEAL.
BUT WITH THE EMBASSY, I SAID
DAVID, DAVID, $180,000 IS TOO
CHEAP.
WE GOT TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT.
IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
BUT SIR, I CAN DO A REALLY GOOD
-- I KNOW YOU CAN, IT'S NOT
GOING TO PLAY WELL.
WE TOOK IT FROM $1 BILLION TO
$180,000.
I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVID,
MAKE IT $400,000.
AND USE JERUSALEM STONE.
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STONE.
AND YOU'RE IN JERUSALEM, IT'S
PROBABLY INEXPENSIVE.
MOST EXPENSIVE STONE WHEN YOU
BRING IT HERE.
BUT YOU'RE IN JERUSALEM.
THEY SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF IT,
RIGHT?
I SAID, DAVID, USE BEAUTIFUL
JERUSALEM STONE AND LET'S DO IT.
WE OPENED IT UP FOUR MONTHS
LATER FOR $400,000.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT'S OPEN.
IT'S OPEN.
I COULD TELL YOU MANY OF THESE
STORIES.
I COULD TELL YOU MANY.
I COULD TELL YOU SO MANY OF
THESE STORIES.
THAT STORY AND I GOT 30 MORE WE
COULD TALK ABOUT.
THE WAY WE SPENT.
HE SAYS I WANT TO HEAR MORE.
SHOULD I GIVE YOU ONE MORE OF
THOSE STORIES?
ONE STORY.
SO WE LIKE SOUTH KOREA.
WE'VE GOT 32,000 SOLDIERS OVER
THERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNITED
STATES.
THEY DON'T PAY.
THEY DON'T PAY US.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
THEY ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL.
AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
GAVE THIS INCREDIBLE -- IT'S ALL
RIGHT, DON'T WORRY, IT'S BEING
MOSTLY DISMANTLED.
MOSTLY DISMANTLED.
SO MY FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE I GET
THERE AND I NOTICE THERE'S THIS
INCREDIBLE THAD SYSTEM.
THAD SYSTEM TO KNOCK DOWN
ROCKETS.
SHOOTS DOWN ROCKETS, MISSIMS,
MOST INCRED -- MISSILES, MOST
INCREDIBLE THING YOU'VE EVER
SEEN.
AND THE COMPANY LIKES TO SAY IF
YOU SEND UP TWO MISSILES, YOU'LL
GET 100%.
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
I SAID DO IT WITH ONE.
BRAND NEW, THEY PUT IN.
I SAID JUST OUT OF CURIOUSTY,
WHO PAYS FOR THIS?
I SAID TO A CERTAIN GENERAL,
GOOD GUY.
BUT HE'S NOT INTO BUSINESS.
HE'S INTO WINNING WARS, BUT NOT
BUSINESS.
HE'S INTO WINNING, BUT NOT
BUSINESS.
LITTLE BUSINESS TO HIM.
SO I SAID, SO, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.
HOW MUCH IS THAT SYSTEM COST?
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.
AS A BUSINESSMAN, YOU BY THE
WAY, A GOOD BUSINESSMAN, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
HOW MUCH DOES THAT COST?
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.
WHO PAYS FOR IT?
SIR, I DON'T KNOW.
NOW, YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, THE
PURPOSE OF THIS IS ON THE
BORDER.
THIS IS IN THE TIME WHEN WE WERE
HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM, YOU
KNOW AT THE BEGINNING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO WAR.
BUT WE'RE DOING NICELY NOW.
BUT I SAID, SO LET ME GET THIS.
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S VERY
EXPENSIVE.
AND WE SHOOT DOWN ROCKETS THAT
ARE SHOT FROM NORTH KOREA TO
SOUTH KOREA TO SHOOT OKAY.
SO WE'RE PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA,
RIGHT?
WHY AREN'T THEY PAYING?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
I SAID GENERAL, IMMEDIATELY GO
AND FIND OUT WHO'S PAYING FOR IT
AND HOW MUCH.
SO HE GOES, NEXT MORNING HE
COMES INTO MY OFFICE.
SIR, WE ARE AN ALLY OF SOUTH
KOREA, AND THEREFORE WE ARE
PAYING FOR THE SYSTEM, SIR.
I SAID, I THOUGHT SO.
THEN I SAID, ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME
THE BAD NEWS.
GIVE ME THE BAD NEWS.
HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST?
SIR, $1 BILLION.
I SAID, WELL, WHOA.
SO WE'RE PUTTING IN A SYSTEM
THAT WE PAY FOR AND IT'S GOING
TO COST A BILLION DOLLARS IN
ORDER TO PROTECT AN IMMENSELY
WEALTHY COUNTRY THAT MAKES ALL
OF YOUR TELEVISION SETS, RIGHT?
SAMSUNG, LG.
I ORDER A LOT OF THEM.
SOUTH KOREA.
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THAT
OUT, STEVE KING, AS A TRUE
CONSERVATIVE.
BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.
SO WE DO THIS AND I SAID DO ME A
FIVER.
GO BACK TO THE -- FAVOR.
GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY.
RENEGOTIATE THE DEAL.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL.
BUT SIR, THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY
AGREED TO IT.
I SAID I DON'T CARE IF THEY
AGREED TO IT.
I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF THEY
AGREED TO IT.
I DON'T CARE.
SO THAT'S THE SECOND OR THIRD
STORY.
I COULD GO ON ALL NIGHT, BUT I
WANT TO GET THE OUT OF
HERE, OKAY?
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS COMING
TO IOWA AND THERE'S MORE PEOPLE
FROM NEBRASKA.
RIGHT, PETE RICKETTS?
PETE RICKETTS, GOVERNOR
RICKETTS.
WE LOVE YOU BOTH.
WE LOVE YOU BOTH.
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING OTHER
NATIONS, I COULD GIVE YOU 30
STORIES.
I COULD GIVE YOU 100 STORIES
LIKE THAT.
WE'RE FINALLY REBUILDING OUR
NATION.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
AMERICA IS NOT BEING TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF ANYMORE.
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED
AGAIN.
WITH REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS, WE
PASSED THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF
TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
BIG NUMBERS.
SO IMPORTANT FOR THE FARMERS AND
SMALL BUSINESS TO SAVE YOUR
FAMILY FARMS AND RANCHES.
WE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED THE
ESTATE TAX, ALSO KNOWN AS THE
DEATH TAX.
SO NOW IF YOU LIKE YOUR CHILDREN
OR LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU CAN
LEAVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FARM TO
YOUR CHILDREN AND THEY WON'T
HAVE TO PAY ANY TAXES.
THEY WON'T HAVE TO GO TO YOUR
LOCAL BANKER, BORROW MONEY, AND
END UP LOSING THE FARM WHICH WAS
HAPPENING.
NOW YOU WON'T HAVE ANY, YOU GUYS
KNOW THAT.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL JEFF AND STEVE
AND EVERYBODY.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL BHAUZ PEOPLE
ARE -- BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
LEAVING THEIR FARMS, THE KIDS
END UP GOING THROUGH AND
LOSING THEIR FARMS.
SO NOW YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO TO
THE BANK, BORROW MONEY, PUT A
MORTGAGE ON.
HERE'S THE THING, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE YOUR KIDS OR IF YOU DON'T
LOVE YOUR KIDS, IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY IMPACT ON YOU.
SELL THE FARM, ENJOY YOURSELVES,
AND RELAX.
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING.
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING IF YOU
DON'T LIKE THEM.
DON'T GIVE THEM ANYTHING.
WE'RE REDUCING THE PRICE OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO HELP
CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS ACCESS
LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT.
WE PASSED RIGHT TO TRY.
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT IS.
WE HAVE RIGHT TO TRY NOW.
FOR YEARS PEOPLE WANTED TO
ACCESS SOME OF THESE CURES THAT
WORK, BUT THEY CAN'T GET
APPROVED BECAUSE IT'S A LONG
PROCESS WHICH WE'VE CUT WAY
DOWN.
RIGHT TO TRY.
THEY WERE TERMINALLY ILL AND
THEY COULDN'T GET TREATMENT OF
SOMETHING THAT MAY WORK.
WE JUST SIGNED RIGHT TO TRY AND
THESE GUYS HELPED A LOT.
RIGHT?
STEVE, JEFF, EVERYBODY.
THEY HELPED A LOT.
DAVID WAS GREAT.
DAVID YOUNG.
SO NOW YOU GET THE RIGHT TO TRY.
PEOPLE USED TO TRAVEL ALL OVER
THE WORLD IF THEY HAVE MONEY.
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE MONEY THEY'D
GO HOME.
THEY HAD NO HOPE.
NOW THEY CAN GET TREATMENT.
THEY SIGN A DOCUMENT.
THEY CAN GET TREATMENT.
THEY TRIED FOR 40 YEARS TO GET
THAT PASSED.
WE GOT IT PASSED.
RIGHT TO TRY, I LOVE IT.
WE ALSO PASSED VETERAN'S CHOICE,
GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO
SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR.
BIG THING.
44 YEARS.
44 YEARS THEY'VE TRIED TO GET IT
PASSED.
PEOPLE ARE WAITING IN LINE FOR
12 DAYS, 20 DAYS, FOR 28 DAYS.
PEOPLE AREN'T THAT SICK BY THE
TIME THEY SEE THE DOCTOR.
SERIOUSLY.
THEY'RE TERMINALLY ILL.
THEY COULDN'T SEE A DOCTOR.
NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LET
THEM GO SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR.
WE PAY FOR THE BILLS.
IT'S GREAT FOR THEM.
IT ACTUALLY IS SAVING FOR US.
44 YEARS.
44 YEARS.
44 YEARS.
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY IDEA, BUT
THEN I CAME BACK AND SAID WHAT A
GREAT IDEA.
THEY SAID WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO
GET IT PASSED FOR 44 YEARS.
I MEAN HOW SIMPLE, RIGHT?
44 YEARS.
BUT BECAUSE OF GUYS LIKE THIS,
STEVE, JEFF, EVERYBODY, GOVERNOR
YOU WERE INCREDIBLE, PETE
RICKETTS, PETE, YOU HELPED SO
MUCH.
ALL OF YOU GUYS.
AND THE LANDMARK V A
ACCOUNTABILITY -- VA
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW.
YOU COULDN'T FIRE ANYBODY,
LITERALLY.
THERE WERE SADISTS WORKING FOR
THE VA.
THERE WERE BAD PEOPLE.
THERE WERE THIEVES, HORRIBLE
PEOPLE.
YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM.
WE PASSED I THINK IT'S 46, 47
YEARS.
I HATE TO SAY IT, UNION
PROBLEMS, ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS,
CIVIL SERVICE PROBLEMS.
PRETTY STRONG LOBBY, RIGHT?
WE GOT IT PASSED.
44, 46 YEARS.
AND NOW WHEN WE CATCH PEOPLE
THAT AREN'T TAKING CARE OF OUR
VETERANS WE LOOK AT THEM, WE SAY
JIM, YOU'RE FIRED.
GET OUT OF HERE.
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T SPIN THE
CAMERAS.
FELLAS, I SAID AT THE BEGINNING,
NOBODY DOES IT.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW
HOW BIG THESE CROWDS ARE.
NO, I'M TELLING YOU.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.
LOOK.
THEY'RE NOT SPINNING.
DO YOU SEE ONE CAMERA TURNING.
NO, THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW ALL
THESE PEOPLE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.
I DON'T SEE -- LOOK, I DON'T SEE
ONE CAMERA TURNING.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW IT.
OUR GREAT FIRST LADY.
I COME HOME, DID THEY SHOW THE
CROWD?
NO, BUT IT SOUNDED MASSIVE.
RIGHT?
IT SOUNDED -- LOOKS LIKE AN
IOWA, IOWA STATE OR NEBRASKA
FOOTBALL GAME.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
MY WIFE WOULD SAY THEY DIDN'T
SHOW THE CROWD BUT IT SOUNDED
BIG.
YOU CAN'T CHEAT ON THE SOUND.
IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE.
THEY CHEAT BECAUSE THEY NEVER
SHOW THE CROWD.
WE SECURED $716 BILLION TO FULLY
REBUILD OUR GREAT AMERICAN
MILITARY.
AND AT MY DIRECTION THE PENTAGON
IS NOW PREPARING TO CREATE THE
SIXTH BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN
ARMED FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE.
VERY IMPORTANT.
VERY IMPORTANT.
WE GOT TO GET THAT DONE,
CONGRESSMEN.
EVERYBODY WANTS THAT.
SO IMPORTANT.
FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS YOUR
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA.
THEY APOLOGIZED.
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR
VALUES.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR IOWA AND
NEBRASKA.
AND WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP
FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM.
AND BY THE WAY, SPEAKING OF THE
NFL.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS THE NFL
HAD A BIG PROBLEM WITH CANADA
AND THE SUPER BOWL AND RIGHTS,
IT'S A COMPLICATED THING.
DOESN'T MATTER.
I HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WE
WERE DEALING WITH A MUCH MUCH
BIGGER ISSUE.
AND THE NFL IS A GREAT AMERICAN
COMPANY.
AND I TOLD MY PEOPLE, GET THE
NFL PROBLEM SOLVED.
IT TOOK THEM ABOUT TWO MINUTES.
AND I GOT A CALL FROM THE
COMMISSIONER.
I THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING ABOUT
THE FLAG.
I THOUGHT HE WAS CALLING TO SAY
WE AGREE TO STAND WITH OUR HAND
ON OUR HEART AND OUR HELMET ON
THE GROUND.
HE DIDN'T.
BUT A GOOD GUY.
HE CALLED ME TO THANK ME.
YOU KNOW WHY I DID THAT?
I DID THAT -- NOBODY TOLD ME TO
DO IT -- I DID THAT BECAUSE I
KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM, AND
IT'S A GREAT AMERICAN COMPANY.
WHETHER WE LIKE IT, DON'T LIKE
IT, IT'S A GREAT AMERICAN
COMPANY.
AND SO I GOT IT DONE.
TOOK US LIKE TWO MINUTES.
AND NOW THE PLAYERS WILL BE PAID
MORE MONEY AND THEY'LL STILL
HATE ME.
ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE?
THEY'LL STILL HATE TRUMP AS THEY
GET MORE MONEY.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S WHY GUYS LIKE JIM BROWN
AND KANYE AND SO MANY OTHERS
LIKE ME.
BUT TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE
MOMENTUM, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR
FRIEND, GET YOUR FAMILY, GET
YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR
COWORKERS, AND GET OUT AND VOTE
OR EARLY VOTING.
GET OUT AND VOTE OR EARLY
VOTING.
VOTE FOR GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS.
VOTE -- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING HERE AS MY GUEST.
PETE, I THOUGHT YOU WERE COMING
HERE JUST TODAY.
COME ON OVER, PETE.
VOTE FOR PETE RICKETTS.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE BRINGING
HALF OF NEBRASKA, PETE.
VOTE FOR CONGRESSMAN ROD BLUM
AND CONGRESSMAN DAVID YOUNG.
DON'T BOTHER WITH THESE TWO
GUYS.
THEY'RE GOING TO WIN.
VOTE FOR THEM TOO, PLEASE.
VOTE FOR THEM TOO.
THAT'S RIGHT, STEVE.
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU
GUYS.
THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU.
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS.
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING
BECAUSE A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE
FOR LOWER TAXES, LESS
REGULATION, AND MORE PRODUCTS
THAT ARE MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE
USA.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
IT'S A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR
BORDERS, RESPECT OUR
CONSTITUTION, AND RESPECT THE
HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A
VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT
POLITICS OF ANGER, DIVISION, AND
DESTRUCTION.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
AND WEAKNESS BECAUSE IT'S
WEAKNESS.
AND TO RECLAIM OUR MAGNIFICENT
DESTINY AS AMERICANS.
TO EVERYONE IN THIS GREAT ROOM
TONIGHT, TO EVERY CITIZEN
WATCHING ACROSS OUR LAND, AND
THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM, THIS IS
YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE.
SO IMPORTANT.
GOT TO GET OUT.
YOU'VE GOT TO VOTE.
IT WILL ALL BE TAKEN AWAY IF
THEY GET CONTROL.
INCLUDING THEY'LL START
APPOINTING SUPREME COURT JUDGES
THAT YOU WILL NOT WANT.
WE'LL HAVE JUSTICES THAT YOU
WILL SAY HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE.
IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE WHETHER WE
TURN BACKWARD TO THE FAILURE AND
FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PAST OR
WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD INTO
A FUTURE OF AMERICAN GREATNESS.
NEVER FORGET THAT IN 2016 WE HAD
THE GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND THEY WON'T CHALLENGE THAT.
THEY EVEN ADMIT THAT.
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY.
BUT THAT WAS THE GREATEST
MOVEMENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY.
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA OR THE
FAKE NEWS OR THE PUNDITS TO
DECIDE YOUR FATE.
IT IS UP TO YOU.
YOU HAVE THE POWER.
WITH YOUR VOTE YOU CAN DO SO
MUCH, BUT YOU CAN DEFEND
FAMILY, DEFEND YOUR COMMUNITY,
DEFEND YOUR COUNTRY, DEFEND YOUR
RIGHTS, YOUR FAITH, AND YOUR
DIGNITY.
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU, IOWA
AND NEBRASKA, HELPED BUILD THIS
COUNTRY.
AND TOGETHER WE ARE TAKING BACK
OUR COUNTRY.
RETURNING POWER TO BACK TO THE
AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHICH IS YOU.
THESE STATES WERE SETTLED BY
TOUGH PIONEER MEN AND STRONG
PIONEER WOMEN.
THE WOMEN ACTUALLY WERE STRONGER
THAN THE MEN, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT.
THE WOMEN ARE STRONGER THAN THE
MEN.
I'VE SAID IT FOR A LONG TIME.
SORRY, MEN, SORRY YOU GUYS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
RIGHT?
THEY'RE ALL NODDING.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHO HAVE BRAVED THE WILDERNESS
AND DEFIED THE DANGERS TO BUILD
A LIFE AND A HOME RIGHT HERE.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF
LUXURY.
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN
COMMON.
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES.
THEY LOVED THEIR COUNTRY.
AND THEY LOVED THEIR GOD.
THESE COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID
NOT SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND
TEARS SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT
HOME WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO ERASE
THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR
PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE.
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM, AND
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, WE
ARE GOING TO WORK.
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT.
AND WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN,
WIN.
WE WILL NOT BEND.
WE WILL NOT BREAK.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN.
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER.
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO
VICTORY.
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICA, AND OUR
HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE, AND
BLUE.
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY,
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER
GOD.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
THANK YOU, IOWA.
THANK YOU, NEBRASKA.
THANK YOU.
