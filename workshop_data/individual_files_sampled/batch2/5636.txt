thing one tonight trumped like all of us is constrained by character limits on Twitter and so he has to figure out ways to cut or abbreviate sometimes it's somewhat cryptic like senator gee apparently referencing Lindsey Graham soundbite on Fox and Friends or crooked H friend Terry M talking about Terry McAuliffe and of course Hillary Clinton but sometimes as shorthand seems to be a random abbreviation like last year when the president tweeted big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas while our people are far more vulnerable as we wait for what should be easy D as Vanity Fair put it Twitter melts down after Trump tweets about easy D easy D cost Iraq caused her raft of headlines and speculations was easy dear person do people know what easy D is but we never really found out what or who easy D was but now President Trump has come out with a brand new abbreviation with a tweet that ends with build wall through M how could you possibly know what M is one way is to look at what Trump TV was airing and that of course is thing to in 60 seconds so some consternation ensued when President Trump tweeted early Sunday morning because of the seven hundred and seven hundred sixteen billion dollars gotten to rebuild our military capital M many jobs are created and our capital and military is again rich which itself is weird I mean just our tax money but anyway building a great border wall is all about national defense capital and capital D build wall through em it seems that when Trump wrote build wall through M he did not mean build wall through Mexico some meta thought or Montgomery or mallomars or Marmaduke muffins know the M is for military build wall through military and I wonder where he got that idea where does he get the money to build the wall that you say he can build as national defense where does he take the money from the same place Reagan took the money to invade the same place he took the money to bomb Syria he has money to spend on national defense and this is a much bigger problem of national funds but all of this can be done under his powers as commander in chief if he cared today washing Post reported that indeed Trump is now pushing for M the military to pay for his border wall the president is following and Coulter's advice perhaps trying to get back in her good graces she's been attacking Trump for signing the budget bill but here's the problem Trump can't simply build wall through em that would require an act of Congress he can't force the military to pay for his wall just as he can't make another country foot the bill and who's gonna pay for the wall who's gonna pay for the wall who's gonna pay for the wall I've never done that before that's actually kill hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
