October 2011 : el Muammar al-gaddafi is drugged from a drainpipe beaten and killed by Libyan revolutionaries the body of Libya's self-proclaimed brother leader laid out in a refrigerator floor laying bare the end of his 42 we're cruel but at the very moment a new dawn bacon Libya was to suffer the revenge of his own history what's happening in Libya now we have two governments seems like a big mess the whole country is ruled by militias the struggle between these militias who will take more power we are now deeply embroiled in conflict in divisions in violence everybody wants to have his share of authority and his share of the money there's no central government per se which really has control so it become really the front for a number of militias Libya is trying to shape itself again but it's a country which is vast and it cannot be ruled centrally just from one city like Tripoli it's the process of this integration of state of Libya it became now what we can call the territory of Libya it's no more state of the history of Libya is the history of the foreign powers who ruled Libya we have definitions come over to Libya we have the Greeks came over and set up cities we have the Romans and then we have the Turks for almost 400 years it has been continuously a place of conflict between the civilization between countries so it was under occupation by every power that there is Libya invaded seized and occupied for millennia was for much of his history no single unified land there was Cyrenaica there was Tripolitania Fezzan and those also was not were not united for a long time almost a thousand years of Arab rule left a shared Islamic tradition across the three regions Tripolitania and the West Cyrenaica in the east and for Xan in the south but they remain distinct separated by geography history and identity by the early 20th century Italian colonizers would take over from ottoman turk occupiers and look to create a unified libya all of their own when the italians invaded Libya they actually viewed the country as the forth coast of Italy they came with the idea that Libya's is part of Italy beginning in 1911 Italian occupation was brutal and met by an organised resistance from Cernik and the East this resistance had its roots in the order of Mohammed Ben Ali Sanusi a Sufi scholar but established religious and political institutions across Eastern and parts of southern Libya the Italian faced civic society that was organized that has its own institution its own values that movement produce charismatic competent non corrupt leaders like Omar Mukhtar Omar al Mokhtar a leading Sanusi Imam led the fight against the Italian invaders but in 1931 after two decades of a targeted guerrilla campaign umbrella dar was captured by the Italian army and hanged to death the event was more than a leader being executed it made so many Libyans like they became somehow submissive to the Italians to the extent that they they they think the former after can be killed such a way there's no way to fight the Italians the Italians would win the fight against Libyan resistance but after their defeat in the second world war in 1943 that lose Libya to British and French control Italy's loss however was the sunna see orders again in 1951 Libya became the first country granted independence by the United Nations creating the kingdom of Libya with the Emir of Seneca at recess Sanusi as king Libyan independence was created as a compromise the Western leaders the urban leaders of off of Tripolitania agreed to accept King Amira Therese as the king of Libya in exchange for keeping the country unified he was from the eastern part he was in exile in Egypt when he came back with the army which would help of the British king we three is to a certain extent was was there man Olivier so it was a country that really did not exist in terms of sovereignty the United States France and the UK were actually running the affairs bassam be behind the scenes King giedrius granted permission for Britain and the United States to build military bases in Libya and when oil was discovered under the Libyan sands in British and American companies were first to be granted concessions Libya would now experience the transformative power of oil Libya began to really change from one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest in Africa before the oil the extended families and the tribal leaders had their sons in the army because it was the guaranteed for their future because there was no business after the oil having a small store anywhere will give you a salary better than going to the army own money was shifting Libya's established order as the Arab world wasn't ruled the revolutionary times embodied by one man above all Egypt's leader Jamel Abdul Nasser there was a huge wave of pan-arabism and Nasser's and military coos were taking place in Iraq in Syria in Sudan and Nasser was inspiring young Arabs to go into the army and then plan and plot military course to change regimes to change what NASA used to characterize as reactionary regimes pro-western regimes the army and the nationalists and the activist students began to agitate against the monarchy and the elite agitation would turn to revolution on September 1st 1969 Adri sister Lucy was ousted while receiving medical treatment in Turkey the group of military men who deposed the King were headed by a little-known 27 year old officer called Muammar al-gaddafi when the salmon he was riding on an anti-western anti-imperialist way the first thing he did is he terminated the agreement for the military bases both an American base in Tripoli and a British base in Tobruk it was a very popular movement because anti-colonialism nationalism call for more egalitarian society or more modernization but it's not a coincidence that only two of the twelve members of the council that led the coup in 1969 came from an eminent elitist background most of them came from a lower middle-class background by taking these nationalist goals their regime was very popular also above all you come very strongly in the side of the Palestinian called for justice in Palestine Arab nationalism support for the Palestinian cause against Israel and an anti colonial mission to drive Western interests out of Libya these were the pillars of the new regime headed by Mohamed Gaddafi who having promoted himself to the rank of culinary looked to make even greater changes he took over the banks in the Italian banks Bank idioma bank from became Libya's central bank at the same time he was very well engaged with his people locally so he would visit villages he would visit towns he would meet people new almost every day at the same time the rate of change inside the lives of people in terms of infrastructure building roads building schools building hospitals clinics and so on and so forth never stopped they had a very ambitious plan for nationalizing some big businesses and also taking over the oil industry in March 1970 the Gaddafi regime created the state-owned National Oil Corporation the NOC to take direct control of Libya's oil production and distribution the NOC replaced the DRI's era Libyan Petroleum Corporation moving the administration of oil from Benghazi in the east where the vast majority of Libya's oil fields were located to a new permanent location in the West entry Polly the heart of Gaddafi's power three years later he nationalized 51% to full assets of foreign oil companies operating in Libya then in 1973 war broke out between Israel and Egypt along with Syria an embargo by the oil cartel OPEC against countries supporting the Israelis led to a quadrupling of the price of oil for the remainder of the decade Gaddafi would use this new money and new power to lay out his vision for a new Libya what was his ideology what did he set out to achieve exactly for the living people at the time objective objectively speaking of course when the defeat came he came with the same rhetoric that Abdul Nassir Bush's career steerer Kiowa which is liberty or freedom socialism and an Arab unity and also he went to the same thing that he deliberate Palestine of course this resonates with the Libyan people and also at the same time he introduced himself as a very simple person that he would go and he will sit with the students in the university and he will drive his own car so because a person he's from them he's from among them so he got a lot of support and at that time what are your personal recollections of what he was like he was as dr. Lucia Gore said very simple and he came with no ideology he found what the street wanted and he had a lot of love I remember he came to the University we discussing with him the law of the of the Student Union and he came with the military fatigue so one of the students told him hey you know that's Envy in the university legislation you're not supposed to come in with this kind of uniform so he took his Volkswagen went back to his place changed and came and spent the night with us to the three o'clock in the morning and we ate together macaroni that we made there so I think this is the original Gaddafi is the simple guy that he does a lot of thinking he has ambitions but at the time he was not vicious I actually recall as a young boy three times what I met with Gaddafi or interacted with him in early 1970 I was in high school in Tripoli he came once to our school in his own yellow Volkswagen alone no security no bodyguards he drove all the way inside to our schoolyard and we all came around and surrounded his car he came out we met with him we started chatting with him he was so modest and down-to-earth and wanted to be directly in touch with people he was like that so it seems a very popular person at the beginning within a few years yeah became very unpopular and and that's the question what changed him how did he become that brutal autocratic ruler in Libya well I think I think believe clearly I mean he especially have a debt abdullah sir he became he feels that he is the leader of the Arab world and he's entitled to it and he started with of course eliminating his group around him the mesoscale Torah the the council spring council of the revolution and and of course he want to introduce something new first of all he cancelled the constitution and this has happened in 1973 and also he announced the the Cultural Revolution and of course based on that he would so many of the students who ever in any direction and interpret into prison but he did something before that he tried to bring all the intellectuals from Libya who ever have an opinion there and he made them speak to be able to categorize them who they are yes and which direction they are n so 1973 he imprisoned everybody the Communists the Socialists the Islamists and all of them including why they were including Mohammed Mohammed he was one of those 1973 yes with everybody else as a pan-arab a status well they looked for an accusation what was the effect the significance of the five political points he declared in zwar in 1973 at the time when you were arrested well he found a dissent growing up dissent inside the RCC dissent in the army and he was not at the time with that grip on it so he went to swara and he told us we we will all leave power we give it to the people yes civilians to the civilians so he went there and he deceived them so they are all out but he is the leader of the new revolution the popular revolution and then of course to make it sound a revolution it took us to jail so do you think he has always had that idea of becoming a dictator or was this a reaction to a threat to his position and power that changed him I think he said it was growing he said no more well look he didn't no more he never had the education or experience to make him a Democrat for us I'm not in power so I am with democracy I don't know if I'll be in power although I practice democracy now where I live but they were coup attempts assassination attempts is that what made him really brutal let me let me complete the idea so he had surplus of money that he never thought of and here he saw politicians from everywhere I saw the head of the Liberal Party in England came and tell him Quorra Gaddafi you are the one who teaches about freedom on Libyan TV because he was treated well there you think these sort of things changed him I I think I think if we go back to the few years before the coup Gaddafi was a very dominant figure with all his companions and colleagues which he gathered around himself to to actually do the to do the coup he was not going to accept criticism he was not going to accept anybody even from the closest of his colleagues who actually did the coup with him to force him to change his mind or policy and anything and and I think his his it was in his personality and his in his character always to be autocratic and to be dominating and he will not give in to other opinions so the precipitations for a dictator were were there in his character and as as things moved on and he started getting challenges not just from his own group Adam and Hassan Moussa Ahmed a military coup attempt in December 1970 or 1969 sorry and then the student movement were very expressive against him I remember he used to come to Tribune University and the students were very vocal very brave telling him look you and your colleagues the army officer you should go back to your barracks we want civilian rule so as he had rejections from the studio from intellectuals from army officers he started to become very brutal to protect his dominance as his control over power he basically took affirmed a grip of the country every aspect of the country's life and I think that was the first clear sign that Gaddafi was heading to be an absolute dictator of Libya despite growing isolation Libya continues to pursue policies which are a unique mix of strict Muslim rules and Marxist ideology Gaddafi established the Jamahiriya fate of the masses a system of people's committees and the general People's Congress this was part of Gaddafi's third Universal theory that he laid out in his green book he himself would claim to have no official role in the Jamahiriya but would remain the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and go by a new title brother leader I think it was it was to a certain point successful experience to a certain limit it was not completely independent system from Gaddafi he's not president originally a Republican there's no Republic and he is not a minister not a prime minister he is the leader of revolution which is kind of ongoing process that never ends it was diluted and subvert it and became a way of really enhancing the mobilization and cramping and punishing dissident voices in Libyan society the army was first there two unions were purged the Student Union was first the other independent Association were burst and everything became either you are a revolutionary or counter revolutionary and you could see that in formal institutions the security apparatus the secret police the the so-called Revolutionary Committees began to dominate the formal institutions of the state what Gaddafi's actually doing is working very hard to create a personalized centralized state in which really there are no proper institutions and he is the center of everything Gaddafi was hollowing out Libya's political structures who rose to real power would lead only to him and all dissent brutally repressed the whole power became in his hand and that's why he start really become a very vicious against anyone who will even voice anything different from his opinion the multi think of that you'll be in prison if you're not in prison you're behind in the streets that's where Libya have seen probably one of the most vicious hand in campaigns can ever happen twas it during the month of ramadhan that used to be done just around m'lip and his TV broadcasted and they've handed those young people in their own cities so to show them and also at the same time they go and they destroyed their homes while Muammar al-gaddafi exercised brute force at home his authority didn't extend to either Arab fs following the death of Egypt's German Abdel Nasser in 1970 Gaddafi had seen himself as heir apparent to advance pan-arabism but not a successor and were said that had sidelined Gadhafi during the war with Israel and ignored the Libyan leader as Egypt fell in line with Western interests signing a peace treaty with Israel Gadhafi took this as a personal insult and a betrayal of the Arab cause he's a leader with few friends in the area the man who dreamed of uniting the Arab world is perhaps discovering that no one shares his vision anymore Muammar al-gaddafi resented being sidelined in Arab affairs now at the beginning of the 1980s he'd looked to the wider world for new purpose he became literally against everybody especially in the Arab world because he felt that all of them had betrayed the the Arab cause and he is the champion of the Arab cause it is the responsibility of America must be outside of this area it is aggression it is that so that's why he starts supporting a lot of the movements in different parts of the world he was accused of supporting so many different various organizations from the Irish Republican Army yeah IRA in the UK to the Red Brigades in Italy or Mandela in South Africa at the time when it was only Gaddafi and people like him and Castro and yes Arafat who actually talked about Mandela negative positively and supported him Gaddafi might have seen himself as a champion of a global anti imperialist struggle but for much of the West he was a supporter of worldwide terror and then in December 1985 simultaneous attacks on airports in Rome and Vienna claimed the lives of 19 civilians including five Americans the following year a West Berlin nightclub was born killing three people to wear American servicemen ladies and gentlemen our president of United States European intelligence agencies suggested Palestinian groups based in Syria we're most likely responsible for the attacks for the US however the blame lay squarely please be seated with one man Gaddafi's long-standing involvement in terrorism is well-documented and there's irrefutable evidence of his role in these attacks Gaddafi of course was already hugely projected as a monster as it turns if you say he's a terrorist everybody will agree so it's easy to throw them at him and it will stick and he did deny it he didn't say that we are behind it but he didn't deny that idea and began to say this is a war against colonialism and imperialism the leaders of the Western world have called you a terrorist Colonel your government is a terrorist government the Reagan is the biggest terrorist in the world this Mad Dog of the Middle East has a goal of a world revolution Muslim fundamentalist revolution Reagan named them the Mad Dog of the Middle East so good efening answered them on the same day naming him as the Mad Dog of the international Zionism movement and of course it was very it was the lowest the law of diplomacy in April 1986 diplomacy between the United States and Libya came to a violent end today we have done what we had to do if necessary we shall do it again the United States decided to punish him once and for all actually by trying to kill him they send huge airplanes and bombed locations in Tripoli and his own house his own headquarters in all Bureau office but um we also had lost some civilians that including children including babies it is a clear and blunt attempt by the Nazis leader of the free world to assassinate somebody because they don't like him Gaddafi was from the Arab world and was a suitable person to fight with because after all Qaddafi had alienated almost everyone so he was a perfect foil for the Reagan administration Gaddafi's reputation as the artists sponsor of Terror was to once again make him the prime suspect within 1988 an American airliner was brought down over the Scottish town of Lockerbie killing all 259 people on board the evidence for Libya's direct involvement in carrying out the Lockerbie bombing was less than conclusive but in 1992 pushed by the United States Britain and France the United Nations placed severe economic and trade sanctions on Libya for his alleged involvement led to so many disruption of life it so many kind of finishing sanctions economic sanctions political sanctions even Bolivian passport when your truffle was was a kind of accusation in itself Libyans completely were now enclosed inside their country and they suffered for years because because of his actions after the the Lockerbie bombing the sanctions came in and that really it Qaddafi hard with me I think hit the Libyan people hard Gaddafi was not really affected by the embargo so al if it doesn't even be who there have been affected first and and with that his grip on power really tightened as he was looking to be an international leader supporting all these different groups around the world well by that time the Libyan the situation in Libya became marginal for him he's now a part of a big international struggle he's fighting against superpowers and he's not also a puppet of the Russians he's against communism and communist Olivia a prism so now he's is a part of international struggle you know the Libyans were marginal for him and and he got engaged in a battle that became you know like the snowball against the West and the West was working against him and that affected the Libyan population in a neck very negative way because it was more dictatorship more oppression and everybody against me he created an enemy he created when he started with you know supporting what he calls the liberation movements so would you say he was enjoying that role because he was accused of a lot of terrorist attacks in Vienna in Rome in Berlin and he never used to deny any of it he felt that Libya was too small for him he wanted a bigger stage so he tried with the Arab unity uniting the whole Arab as we say from the Gulf to the ocean from Bahrain to Morocco and he failed with that so now he wanted the whole world to be his stage so he started supporting revolutionary movements all around the world I recall somebody telling me and this is exactly accurate information that him in the 80s there was a camp in Libya supervised by something called the International revolutionary Matata this camp had 17,000 trainees military trainees from 35 nationalities well the question is including including Irish was was he to the Latin America to Asia to all over the world was he was he doing that because he believed in it as a revolutionary leader and so on or as mr. Bashir said he created an enemy he needed that sort of enemy I think both I think he suffered from grandia's illusions that actually he could rule the world he could change regimes all over the world and these regimes become they emulate his own model and he will be like the the mouse sitting of the muna the that's one thing the other thing I think he enjoyed this idea that this this this this man the popular man of the masses all over the world he's taken on the imperialists he's taken on the biggest imperialists in the world which is the United States when the terrorists attacked in Berlin happened Ronald Reagan called Gaddafi the Mad Dog of the Middle East so did the West need someone like Gaddafi to be you know an international villain as well was what was in it for the West I think they want to make an example of Gaddafi in the region that if you go beyond your limits then a clearly you can come and attack you in your place so I think it does that that's I think personally I think he is the one who created this for himself because he hit oh that he has to become a real big player in the world stage and of course he does not have he doesn't have that power or the or what will allow him to do such a thing there I would like to add to this why did Libya came up in the agenda of the Americans 1979-1980 I was part of the ribbon opposition and I had a meeting with a foreign agency American foreign agency you know it was imposed on me and they said we would like to help you at the time what Reagan won the election I can tell you now at the time the war between Iraq and Iran heightened and Iran threatened to stop all the oil supplies from the Gulf Libya for the United States and for Europe is an oil political entity it's a supplier when the supply from the Gulf is under heat Libya becomes important for the United States they wanted to topple him put another regime that will bring Libya back to good relation and higher oil production and better relation it's the same thing now it was convenient for the American foreign policy to find a maverick like Gaddafi and pick him as an enemy and put all this blame of international terrorism and all the mischief is around the world on him and I recall after the Lockerbie in 1988 and we all know now with the hand side that Lockerbie wasn't just the Libyan component that was Iran involved there was a group based in Syria involved and if you have three bad boys you pick a fight with the weakest one and this in this case it was Gaddafi because at that time it was not convenient to pick a fight with Iran and it was not convenient to pick a fight with Syria so in that sense Gaddafi played that role for conveniently played that role for the West and specially America gaddafi eventually handed over the two Libyan officials suspected of carrying out the Lockerbie bombing but the sanctions remained and fueled increasing dissent against the regime one organization the Libyan Islamic fighting group formed by Mujahideen returning from Afghanistan in the early 1990s plotted to kill Libya's leader and replaced the Jamahiriya with an Islamic state it failed crushed by Gaddafi's security forces many of his members mostly hailing from Libya's eastern region were locked up without trial and his qualit conditions in a Brazilian prison in Tripoli in june 1996 after being denied access to their families and to lawyers a mistreated by God's the inmates protested some revolted some escaped in the chaos an estimated one thousand two hundred and seventy prisoners were allegedly shot dead by prison guards and the orders from Gaddafi's intelligence chief though the facts of the incident remained contested it became one of the most notorious episodes of the Gaddafi era that was one of the ugliest massacres most brutal massacres under the regime and I think in the long term that haunted the regime twelve hundred and 70 prisoners killed they have 12 hundred and seventy families many of them were from Benghazi the families of those killed in a Brazilian prison in 1996 started to voice their demands those demands fell on deaf ears the fallout from the alleged massacre at Abu Salim prison was part of a growing discontent simmering in Libya but Qaddafi knew it was his troubles with the West not least the UN sanctions which threatened his authority at home but then in 2003 the u.s. invaded Iraq and changed the course of Libya's future real change in course happened just after the death of Saddam Hussein's son and Mosul are they fahsai were killed by the American Special Forces Gaddafi's wife at the time she told them you know if it's you you are free to do whatever you want but I don't want this to happen to my kids the logic of the so-called war on terror led by the United States meant that a man labeled a terrorist could now be a friend of the West Libya has begun the process of rejoining the community of nations and Colonel Qadhafi knows the way forward Gaddafi had been warning Western powers for years about these dangerous Islamist terrorists and the problems of Islamist terrorists and complained that nobody ever listened to him and suddenly the world woke up to the danger and the enormity of the problem and suddenly would it be useful to have an ally in Tripoli Gaddafi would renounce his support for illicit groups worldwide give up his nascent nuclear weapons program and pay compensation to the families of those killed in attacks for which Libya would take responsibility he would also introduce a limited program of reforms led by his son Saif al-islam including the eventual release of some of the political prisoners held at Abu cell in prison with that all sanctions were to be lifted please raise their hands Libya was now back in the international fold all of a sudden what Raley called the Mad Dog this despot this sponsor of terrorism all over the world this supposedly developer of lethal weapons became a good guy that governments like the British government and the American government could do business with leading the way to do business in Tripoli was British Prime Minister Tony Blair blessed visits in 2004 accompanied by representatives of UK industry culminated in the so-called deal in the desert that included an exploration agreement for anglo-dutch oil conglomerate royal dutch/shell worth more than six hundred million dollars Libya's rehabilitation was revealing his truth the West's top brass looking after his own bottom line in reaching out the hands of partnership today we do not forget the past but we do try in the light of the genuine changes happening to move beyond them one after another Western leaders went to Libya offering the hand of friendship multi-million dollar business deals and the kind of legitimacy Muammar Gaddafi had long forgotten from US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice two newly elected French President Nicolas Sarkozy Tripoli welcomed the West and the West jumped in Gaddafi went almost 180 degrees in his relationship with America purely out of the fear of what the United States could do to him it was very disparate for a long time to have a good relationship with United States and I think that that what happened after he saw Saddam coming out from that hole in the ground I think a message very clear came to him from in the red states this is what can happen to you unless you do this and this because they want a political victory for them and and the condition there that you give up your nuclear program we we started listening from Cheney people and we used to know them that let's start something called the constructive engagement with Libya and they said one condition that he gets rid of the was a weapon of mass destruction not because he's gonna use it but because they might go to a terrorist group and then we saw can delete the rice visit in Tripoli we saw a lot of world leaders like Berlusconi like absolutely it started looking great for them I think Tony Blair and George W Bush and I remember this very well it was very convenient for them because of their failure in Iraq because of the big lie that Saddam had WMDs what did Tony player come out to say he say look although we did not find them in Iraq but actually we found them in Libya and we managed to get rid of them in Libya without a war so Fotolia leaders wanted to promote that as a success story yeah and it was very convenient for both for Gaddafi to remain in power and to be rehabilitated and for Tony Blair Andrew and and W George W Bush to actually show some sort of a success against the background of their failure in Iraq we saw a stream of Western companies coming back to the view including British as well as American oil companies marathon came back ConocoPhillips came back British Petroleum came back shelf came back and then they take him to the next level of allowing them to visit him and he was there in France in Paris with Sarkozy and signing agreements with their with the military companies with the oil companies and all of that so now clearly Gaddafi willing to buy himself with the wealth of Libya would be accepted in the West but as Gaddafi was getting closer to the West he was alienating himself from the Arab world the destiny well our Arab subsidy fee any man I know manon understand Avila he has a clash with King Abdullah of Saudi where he's trying to imply that Abdullah is just a Babbitt of the Americans there was also a bad chemistry between him and prince hamad of other there was a real bad chemistry they never felt comfortable with him while Qaddafi burned bridges already charred across the region he continued to build bridges reaching out to sub-saharan Africa in 2009 Muammar Gaddafi was elected chairman of the African Union he immediately vowed to pursue his vision of pan-african unity including a unified African army and a single African currency all part hoopha United States of Africa later that same year Gaddafi made his first ever visit to the United States of America and took the stage at his maiden United Nations General Assembly millena lemonade butter and I am near by ucs a year just haven't invited David yet Mia we stuck the mulignan over 37 million seven loser robbed far from having been rehabilitated the man called the Mad Dog of the Middle East by a US president was showing his true colors and baring his teeth at those who believed they'd brought him to heel they were trying to rehabilitate him and the international community but if you see his speech in front of the Arabic summit and also in the in the UN it seemed like he didn't change when he called the Security Council the Council of course when he came to the United Nation I think that's what he destroyed all of the hope that those countries they had in him they showed they saw the real Gaddafi that he's a person he thinks that he is above the United Nations is above the world and he is a person who can't really dictate how this world would work and and I think that was the point when I said clearly this guy there's no hope in him and of course there's no hope I mean at least for the Libyan people we knew that for 40 years this just what this person has done it has no interest in but to be the dictator to be the authoritarian regime that he has created yeah I remember when he came to New York before coming they declined the visas for some of his delegation and when he came there they treated him bad the White House treated him bad even for the dinners that President Obama called for he was not invited and he tried to challenge Obama by doing a dinner for African leaders and of course nobody showed up to his dinner you know so the I asked one of his asila life I won't say his name and he told me well it was fear told me Gadhafi took a talk talked out of fear it was almost impossible for Gadhafi to change he is still branding America as imperialist and the biggest enemy of the world and at the same time is working with the CIA helping them in their anti-terrorist wars I think Gaddafi was never going to change because if he if he changed that means he would finish he struck deals financial and economic is would do a switch to the West's lightning but even his heart he never actually trusted the money never believed in anything by 2011 the people that he'd ruled with an iron fist for 42 years were showing their distrust of their brother leader standing up for what they did believe in and against the injustice of the Gaddafi regime we started to see small-scale protests and eruptions of public discontent so there was a slight sort of shift and an opening up but really by 2011 expectations for real change had been dashed and people had realized that there was no real change coming change was to come a Centurion from colonization by Italy Libya had become an important player on the world stage : L Muammar Gaddafi had gone from being and accused the sponsor of terror to an ally in the West war against it in the early days of 2011 transformations were sweeping through North Africa the so-called Arab Spring uprisings had seen the end of two dictators Ben Ali in Tunisia and Egypt asana Mubarak pressure was building on Muammar Gaddafi the battle for Libya was about to begin by 2011 we have to look at the international scene around Libya especially the Arab Spring they were seen as revolutions and they made the right atmosphere for something to happen in Libya something would happen in Libya and it would happen in the East the East has sort of a particular sense of itself and a particular narrative that it had been deliberately punished and deliberately marginalized by the Gaddafi regime fat high turbo a lawyer representing the families of prisoners allegedly killed in a Brazilian prison in 1996 had been planning a so-called Day of Rage for the 17th of February 2011 in the eastern city of Benghazi but turbo was arrested two days before the planned protests and as his supporters gathered to demand his release they clashed with security forces protests demanding the release of a terrible quickly moved into protests against Gaddafi in the following days the anti-gaddafi protesters made up of ordinary civilians as well as growing numbers of militias moved on to other cities ransacking police stations and military installations protests tend to armed rebellion Gadhafi at first held back from responding with force but his restraint would be short-lived this is a militant uprising had Qadhafi used more force he might have been able to suppress this uprising it was his decision not to use heavy force at the beginning that allowed this rebellion to get going oh let's work off we so Libyans forming and their own armed groups what we're known at the time as revolutionary brigades essentially the city just felt that they were making it up as they went along Gadhafi now moved to beat back the rebels and take back control the regime tried to snuff out the protests in in a brutal fashion in a way that sparked even more protests so the funerals of those who had been killed by the regime triggered even more crowds to come out people lost their fear the rebellion had spread from Benghazi as far west as Tripoli clashes between protesters and regime security forces peppered the capital city along with demonstrations of support by Gaddafi loyalists Libya was in the midst of a double-edged war for territorial supremacy on the ground and for legitimacy and the eyes of the wider world rebel militias played down their links to our Lord groups including the Al qaeda-linked Libyan Islamic fighting group whose members had been freed from prison two years earlier meanwhile kölner Gadhafi rallied his supporters against an armed insurrection by those he claimed to be drug-filled foreign terrorists in Libya shiver shiver sanghas anger just deaf even when he's talking clearly he want to say that these are not the liberal people that I know these are just terrorists who they trained by al-qaeda he want to get the sympathy of the world and Maya come on you are fighting and Qaeda in in Iraq and other places I am fighting them in Libya why don't you come support me instead of supporting them territory which in the first 72 hours fell to the rebellion was grabbed back by Qaddafi it was at that point that people began to warn of a bloodbath there started to be a push for a humanitarian intervention and and the push for this was coming from the rebels they realized they were losing this war and so the rebels said to the Sultan well what are we going to do well the only hope is Western military intervention I don't think Gaddafi would necessarily have gone and massacred ordinary civilians in Benghazi when he was poised to come back and take Benghazi he'd retaken a number of other towns including a stab here in the east where he hadn't gone ahead and done a wholesale massacre the international community could not just stand by and see Gaddafi willing to kill thousands and thousands and thousands of demonstrators at the end of February 2011 a group of military officers and government ministers had defected from the regime and set up a National Transitional Council the NTC headed by the former justice minister Mustafa the jury years of neutering the military and hollowing out political structures had left little loyalty among elements of the Gaddafi regime by early March however Gaddafi's forces had showed up their control of Tripoli and looked to head east to reclaim Benghazi the NTC working with the Arab League an organization long at odds with Libya and its leader urged the UN Security Council to stop Gaddafi from killing his own people on mass but claims of impending genocide of regime soldiers ordered to rape civilian woman at will were far from proven don't tell me about the stories about Gaddafi killing his own people the bombardment of fish loom the district in Tripoli the use of rape mass rape as a weapon the use of fragrant tablets as a man as a weapon that's completely false Western NGOs went in and found out that none of this was was true but it was reported at the time and it was reported by Al Jazeera Al Arabiya BBC near Times Washington Post CNN all the TV networks in the West we've seen many dead bodies of Libyans shot in the streets anti-government protesters have told Al Jazeera of what they call a massacre on Saturday in the town the body of evidence at the time seemed overwhelming because you had not just what until the intelligence community was saying you had what all of our allies were saying you had what the regional partners were saying you had what we were reading in the newspaper every day from press from journalists on the ground truth was not the first casualty of the war in Libya but it was now a fiercely contested asset British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy led the charge for direct action against the Gaddafi regime they pushed for a UN Security Council resolution authorizing a no-fly zone over Libya to be overseen by NATO but military intervention would be impossible without us backing you cannot do a NATO intervention without the support of United States and at the time the Secretary of State was Hillary Clinton clearly she is building a political career for herself and she want to take position in the world of stage EDI Clinton was in Paris and there she actually met several ministers Arab ministers there was a videoconference between Paris New York and Washington DC and that basically ilari you know convinced I guess the president to take this decision she went to Barack Obama and told them okay now Gaddafi has tanks going towards Benghazi if he kills the the revolutionaries their blood will be on your white shirt unlike Barack Obama the leaders of Britain and France had needed no convincing to call for a NATO intervention against Gaddafi while David Cameron may have looked to bolster his fledgling credentials as an international statesman for President Sarkozy the drive to get rid of Gaddafi seemed both political and personal the Gaddafi regime reportedly bankrolled Sarkozy successful 2007 presidential campaign that same year Libya signed the multi-billion euro arms agreement that the deaf he would later fail to honor he also proposed the idea of a pan-african currency no longer backed by the French Treasury another challenge to Frances influence in Africa on March 17th 2011 the UN Security Council led by France the UK and the u.s. pushed through resolution one 973 giving legal authority to enforce a no-fly zone over Gaddafi's Libya this resolution demands an immediate ceasefire and a complete end to violence and attacks against civilians they adopted a resolution that said that amongst other things there would be an arms embargo there would be a no-fly zone and all necessary measures could be used to protect civilians in Libya except no occupying Ground Force it wasn't a no-fly zone it was more appropriately and called a no-drive zone because it was able to hit targets on the ground NATO intervention was decisive and tipping the balance of power back in favor of the rebels and also of course the training of rebel forces by foreign security intelligence agencies enabled those rebels to move into the West and eventually to topple Gaddafi and to take control of Tripoli it led to not only the factor Civil War the militarization of surprising and the rise of the armed militias a lot that was done through supply of weapons through Qatar in collaboration with intelligence services of the West were willing to turn the other way to the fact that there was a weapons embargo there's a lot of a lot of help from Emirates from Qatar and who came to the help of the Libyan people and that limited the suffering of the people who limited the number of casualties that took place in their Carter at the beginning was very popular and supporting the uprising but then the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the National Coalition turkey became involved with support of Misrata and so we find that region of Arab countries and the European countries are involved in the Libyan Civil War it was an opportunity for the world to get rid of a menace it's called Gaddafi it's a coincident in the rare moment of history whereby the aspiration of some of the Libyans met with would be interests of Western powerful countries and the country was literally tied up hands and legs and throwing from the ninth floor four bunch of Tears and gangsters waiting outside rebel forces made up of militias divided along regional territorial and ideological lines also contained criminal elements and those seeking their own gain but despite their differences the rebels were gaining the upper hand in the east posters of anti imperialist national hero Omar al Mokhtar took pride of place as flags of independent Libya not seen since the time of King Idris where waste by jubilant crowds by the end of August 2011 rebel forces would take Tripoli Libya's capital city and regime stronghold without the feast resistance many had anticipated less than three weeks later the NTC was recognized by the UN as Libya's legitimate governing authority with Tripoli lost Gaddafi retreated to his hometown of Sirte but it too was now closed to fallen the rebellion was closing in and forget their fee time was running out when the phases recorded messages to his family he said they will go down in history as a hero they will never leave my country and I never I never lived my country I never gave up October 20th 2011 NATO aircraft attack a convoy of armed vehicles Leaving Cert rebel fighters on the ground receive intelligence that a person of interest may be among those fleeing moments later : Muammar al-gaddafi is found hiding in a drainpipe Qaddafi fled and then the rebels chased him down and tortured him and then murdered him for some the final words of Libya's brother leader moments before being killed showed a broken man frail and confused for others those words were of a desperate man clinging to delusion until the last moment here he looks like he doesn't believe that what he was doing was wrong I mean and that's why I say what did I do to you oh come on he destroyed their lives he destroyed their future those people they had no future whatsoever he symbolizes something do those who like him and dislike him or hate him those who picked up arms against him and those who whipped up bombers to defend him and he still represents some kind of fear for them the world was happy and I had a discussion at night with friends and I thought him we'll look you know the violence that happened with him might be the first chapter of a book that we're gonna go through if you live by the sword you die by the sword retribution was meted out to those who fought for Gaddafi some were killed some paraded through the streets others taking away their faiths unknown a gruesome end for an often brutal leader and his supporters but an end that may not have been inevitable there were a series of negotiations right at the beginning right in that period when the UN Security Council authorized intervention and NATO countries started the bombing and when the US State Department heard about this they said you need to stop those negotiations and one of the ex USX military officers who was engaged in those negotiations he said and he's quoted in the newspaper saying this if you're really serious about trying to protect civilians and end of the violence wouldn't you give 48 hours to see if they're serious about potentially agreeing to a ceasefire why would we pull the plug rather than give them a chance to see if they're interested in peace the very idea was to make as many people as possible believe that be that means very even and once you believe isn't even you don't accept the idea of talking to even there is a way to knocking and that's what happened exactly at least four major peaceful settlement negotiations the Americans certainly got that we Came we saw he died when Gaddafi sent his tanks to Benghazi to Benghazi and still the you know there is no United Nation resolution I asked a cousin of mine who was a dissident military man a Coronel and he was a Benghazi I told him good luck is sending his tanks what you're gonna do he said don't worry don't worry because we had French officers and Benghazi including Charles so do you think the French will let their people die they took the Arab League all the way to New York and the decision to bomb Libya was taken within a month it took them more than a year in in Bosnia and Kosovo and Rwanda so you said I think the year I think I need to respond here why did Gaddafi send a column of 60 kilometers of armed tanks and heavy equipment to Benghazi on the 19th of March he was you know a column to Manchester to bring it back he was not going to celebrate with the Benghazi people going to give us you know I just finished this point he was not going there to give out gifts or sweets no he was going there destroy you take a city back or kill was this exaggerated by the media including you know did Debbie really commit massacres oh I think I think I want to go back the West did not do anything during the Tunisian Revolution they did not go do anything via Gyptian Revolution clearly they are fed up with Gaddafi and here's an opportunity for the definitely be removed and the Libyan people are coming out and realized that that that the 70 kilometers of tanks and military vehicles of going to attack Benghazi they know that Gaddafi and of course he does know that but they are you going to slaughter the Libyans because he doesn't care what was in it for the West that's the question well I'll tell you what's in it the price what what was in it is the price Libya has a lot of resources Gaddafi had a lot of cash a lot of investments Libya has 40 banks up that runs sub banks of about 200 banks including in New York in in Wall Street but at that stage he had very good relationships with the West and he me he made big deals like the deal in the desert with Tony Blair and BP and she'll know but he was false billing incoming billions why that's why would they want to get to know he was reluctant especially the French the French Dip he promised them a 10 billion euro or more or more and he didn't do a thing Sarkozy was frustrated the British were frustrated American didn't care but there was a kind of a Lobby around the Clintons that made miss Clinton mrs. Clinton lead the way that the United States enter in this war but it was not the interest of the United States government it was the interest of some lobbies in the United States they think that if the United States have some action there there will be more interest for those lobbies we're talking about international intervention because even the UN resolution what they didn't talk what care about about change in the regime did about protecting civilians I was one of those throughout the Revolution who come out on mid international media almost every day what we were telling Western politicians and others and other politicians and the media that look Gaddafi is very brutal he's not Ben Ali he hasn't left he's not mobarak he's not given a power he's going to stick it out and kill as many people as possible to prevent his downside we wish to say do you want another Rwanda Massacre and North Africa is that what you want because will the international community conscious carry that remember what happened Wanda the world turned a blind eye a million people would be killed and the international community responded yes but it was it was their moral duty Libya was a member of the United Nation I don't think now all we had to do anything arguments for and against the legitimacy of NATO intervention we're being drowned out as the mission to protect civilians crept into regime change Libya was now up for grabs it's the leadership of France and Qatar that took the United the the Arab League to New York and convinced everybody to do and everybody came and for the price and that's what we see up till now the Libyan people there'll be people whatever their pains wear whatever the operation was used against them they were a marginal factor in what happened in Libya what happened are what still happens in Libya and this because the nature of of Libya this is not today this is 17th century this is tense essentially this is at the time of the Greeks when they came and the Romans the Turks Libya is a low potential country but with the Arab interest in these Arab countries what was their interest the Egyptian was confused and they were not in a position they could do anything in Libya the who led it was copper and then the Gulf countries you know and they wanted to get rid of Gaddafi of Libya is developed on the Mediterranean Shore 250 kilometers from Europe you know both sides well the Gulf would be second-hand in the area you're saying they deliberately wanted instability they felt that the only country that has the same potential was not in the Gulf Council is Libya it's out of control you know I'm not ruling out country's interest in Libya but we need to put it into perspective Gaddafi was already doing business with French British Italian and American companies their rights were always preserved by Gaddafi and you know this very well so partly I think partly yes economic interest is always there but I think for an international alliance of 45 countries to support the UN resolution 193 to go into Libya and protect civilians and many many know Norway took part Norway sent aeroplanes and fighters and took part so many countries took part in this alliance that cannot be explained purely by economic interest massacres massacres are happening all over the world yes and we don't see the NATO intervening to protect civilians in other countries and then let's let's let's not forget that what happened in this those eight months twenty seven thousand five hundred sorties with sixty thousand bombs and missiles on Libya the destruction of Libya and turning it from a state sovereign state into a territory that we see today it is the action of the international community that has to come back and try to help us reinstate this state immediately after the fall of the Gaddafi regime Libya was under the stewardship of the National Transitional Council but in reality it was a tonne patchwork of competing militias and awash with weapons under pressure from Western powers the NTC horde through parliamentary elections in July 2012 won by an outwardly liberal coalition the National forces Alliance the second biggest party represented in the new Parliament was the justice and construction party the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya the NTC was to give way to the GNC the general National Congress which would be based in Tripoli and given a mandate to govern for 18 months before the election of a new government but as Libya moved to democratic rule moves were being made that would give the militias even greater power number one was the fateful decision by the transitional authorities to grant a state salary to anyone who had fought during the revolution so what we saw happened was a mushrooming of armed groups so the revolutionary brigades became even bigger and more powerful you find a young person who become part of these military formations and he is making 50 % more than a teacher who has been teaching for 35 years the only job opportunity is to become a militia member Libya became consumed by political and economic turf battles this is my money this is my territory this is my activity not yours and all those different groups whose contesting interests were suppressed under Qaddafi got a chance to say it's my turn now the other crucial event was a decision by Mustafa Abdul Jalil then leader of the National Transitional Council to concede two armed Federalists and Federalists being those who were seeking some form of autonomy for eastern Libya they had begun blockading a key road in central Libya he capitulated to their demands and what was important about that was it was the first time in post-qaddafi Libya where the lesson was learned that force or the threat of force will give you political leverage what happens is that the militias become much more powerful than the government so really done there are many ways under the mercy of these of these bushes there was no real institution built in Libya so that mean when the defi goes you'll find these institutions in place for example there was no army army is marginalized since 1986 and only thing was there was the militias of Gaddafi and his children these are to protect him and these are the one who default again excuse me yes excuse me the Israel and 5th of June well I was an opponent to Gaddafi I went to his jail I was beaten on my legs on my hands by his people but let me let me be objective here the the Libyan army in 2011 resisted for 8 months three against 23,000 sorties Israel in June 5th 1967 used only 3,000 sorties so come on we're talking here when they say resistance what's the point because when you're talking about weekend why everybody was we didn't like the institutions of Gaddafi will you like him being the dictator we resisted them but we cannot say that Libya has no institutions I would say oh I didn't like the institution especially I can ask you well you were I don't know about the health institutions only that there was none it is a revolution it is not does not have a leadership it does not have a plan for what would you afterwards you have this vacuum that is in place and and and then here what happens that Gaddafi literally opened up all his weapon Arsenal's and so now he spread out all the weapons in the hands of the people you get out 17,000 criminals they are out from jail and they are militarized this is the problem now these militias they got used to money and salaries and and influence when they grew and grew they mushroom their numbers at the beginning in 2011 they were about 20,000 25,000 of them now at most now we have about quarter of a million because every young man who was unemployed the best way a quickest way to get money is to go and join a militia militia life became very attractive Libya was driven by militias with conflicting interests violence as political currency was carried out with impunity in September 2012 the US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed during an alleged attack by the al Qaeda affiliated Ansar al-sharia group on an American Consul facility in Benghazi kidnappings and assassinations were now commonplace in spring 2013 violence real and implied was used to force through new legislation that would favor some factions and we can others there was very much a sense in Libya of Victor's justice and one of the manifestations of this attitude this mindset was the drafting and passage in 2013 of what is known in Libya as the political isolation law and this was basically a hollowing out of expertise within key institutions of the state what I found so on I said if you had any job of the Qaddafi you could hold no role in the Libyan political or governmental life wiping out the technocrats wiping out the non-political people wiping out the competent people as well as wiping anybody who did any relationship to Qaddafi it was a power grab in February 2014 without public consultation or parliamentary vote the GNC extended its electoral mandate for one more year it was a fateful move that led to an exiled military man to launch his own challenge for power Haritha after a former Libyan army officer once part of the coup that ousted King Idris in 1969 had been abandoned in Chad after Gaddafi's failed war to seize territory in 1986 after was rescued by the CIA and given you a citizenship and returned to Libya at the start of the 2011 uprising general have to now look to steer a revolt against the GNC but his appeal to overthrow the Tripoli government failed so he regrouped in the east having to restore order to a lawless Benghazi it was completely unsafe in Benghazi to go out every day hundreds of people were killed assassinating Dana Benghazi was a jungle at the time it was a complete jungle between different two groups who are fighting for control after decided he was going to try and put an end to all of this with his operation dignity campaign he pulled with him routes of retired military personnel and then others who would come on board and join what he called his Libyan National Army but which actually in reality was a loose collection of revolutionary groups and militias as well on on the ground in the east you start in the so called the dignity or I can ask in gauzy and get it terrorists in Benghazi in Benghazi there was sorry I was labeled by the United Nation as a terrorist group but there are also other groups from their parted revolution clearly there nobody has labeled them as terrorists but they put all of them together and he started he had us explicitly empty Islamist in gender until the Muslim Brotherhood Nathan his rise or the start of this war in the east of Libya triggered fears among some of those forces in the west of Libya that he might be strong enough to take mine Ghazi and eventually to move and take over Tripoli powerful malicious such as the synteny brigades had common cause with after and the Libyan National Army the overthrow of the GNC in Tripoli this isn't any brigades moved to see strip the airport a strategically important site but we accounted by a collective of militias targeted by half this operation dignity this collective called itself Libya dawn and student support of the GNC operation dignity labeled Libya dawn as terrorists Libya dawn saw the leaders of operation dignity as anti revolutionary Gaddafi loyalists a new civil war was now been waged for control of Libya running street battles shadowed by political infighting the GNC had come to the end of his term and following elections in June 2014 which were marred by widespread violence it was obliged to hand over power to the newly elected House of Representatives to be based in Benghazi shift in Libya's government from west to east and shifting the balance of power from one block to another the government was to move to Benghazi once it had been elected but it didn't move to Benghazi instead a decision was taken to move to the eastern town of Tobruk which in the view of after his opponents was basically putting the Parliament in even more deeply and after his territory the elections were a real blow for many of the Islamist forces and parties and the Islamists could see that actually things were about to slip out of their hands the old government refused to give up the power the old Parliament the new Parliament which was in the East in the wrong place said we're in charge now and libya began a period of two governments countries like the Emiratis the UAE like Egypt maybe even countries like Qatar and Turkey countries like France they are siding with one side against the other the general National Congress and the people who were part of that group in Tripoli and some of the MS runs were supported at least politically and perhaps more by Qatar and Turkey and this government in the East under the House of Representatives was supported at least politically and perhaps more by Egypt and the amorous general Hoffner went east received his commission from the House of Representatives in the East and you had two competing governments neither of which had meaningful legitimacy neither which could deliver services neither which had national institutions operating national the technocratic institutions on which Libya depended most National Oil Corporation and the central bank of Libya continued to functions they always had there was a pressure from the international community that you don't play with the central bank you don't play with the National Oil Company you should keep them one the world corporation continued to pump oil under the old contracts the money went to the Central Bank of Libya the central bank would be adult it out to the few are you could have two groups fighting one another in the streets both paid for with salaries from the central bank and directed by neither government oil flow boosted cash flow but Libya was being blown apart the UN whose decision to intervene in 2011 inadvertently led to the arming of militias looked to broker a deal in December 2015 to end the violence by creating a new government of national Accord the G and a but the Tripoli based GNA headed by Prime Minister FISA sir Raja was rejected by the after backed House of Representatives and tobruk after would instead seek even greater power by taking control of Libya's lifeline oil it was clear that at some point he would try to control Eastern oil infrastructure which he did the moment that hafter gained control of those Eastern oil ports it changed in terms of the way international actors viewed him when General half DARS military adviser and family members came to me in November 2016 shortly after the u.s. elections they told me Hefner intended to conquer the entire country of Libya fire all of the politicians and every element of Libyan political life run the country by military decree I said to myself where have I heard that before that sounds like more our Qaddafi I got a call from him from after and he said you know can you talk to the Americans and I did talk to the Americans and I went back to mrs. Jones the British ambassador and I think the fire was in her desk and she told me do you think a retired general with one MIG 21 and 30 trucks can change things so III started communicating with General Hefner and good faith the only dispute that we had from the beginning that if it's war against terrorism that's fine but for the army to take over the country we don't want to repeat the 50 years we had before there's two different things you know Khalifa Haftar initiated a full open war in Benghazi with militia groups like the 17th of February the brigade like rafales Hattie Brigade and others this group essentially we're the revolutionaries who fought against Gaddafi in 2011 later on what they did they went into an alliance with internationally classified terrorist groups like Ansar Shariah al-qaeda and later on in 2015 - came in into Benghazi as well to fight with them so now what we had we had Khalifa Haftar on one side leading a fight against a group of revolutionaries in an alliance with terrorist groups for me he is a militia because he didn't have any legitimacy as an institution he is a retired general so he's like there were people who they are and the other militias there and and of course in this he was supported by the Egyptians or by the Emiratis they were supporting him with with weapons going against the embargo of the United Nation of I mean death that kind of support is very public now isn't it by Egypt and the UAE and Saudi Arabia well there's another point I would like to add why is he supported from these countries I want to add you know the general hiftar movement and Benghazi did not happen before general Sisi came to power in Egypt the Egyptians wanted to guarantee their western borders and they thought general Hector can do the work that the Egyptian Western Front the command could do so they they were very generous with him with ammunition with guns and then Saudi Arabia came hesitant but the Emirates came with full power and now I think the Emirates have even more more say than the Egyptians in the East our problem with after is he still believes that the army should be in charge and he belongs to that old mentality the whole idea of the Libyan revolution of 2011 is to get rid of that idea that the whole country is totally absorbed in one cult personality now fortunately and it's a great thing that in the whole west of Libya you will never now in Tripoli see a picture of any leader whatsoever you will not see people talking about individuals they talk about build exactly so let's talk about Tripoli instead of a cult one cult personality now we have two governments would you talk about the government in Tripoli the government of sir ROG yes who which militias supports this government and who supports it this government came as a result of the Libyan dialogue which took about a year and became from that the Libyan political agreement which has been ratified by the Security Council and supported by the international community so Sahaj government really wanted when it came and entered Tripoli allowed the militias to take over if there is a government they are all running it but really there is our not quality government to be honest with you because again I mean they have no power except they can write decisions I mean there is huge number of collimation proclamations yes they make them but they have statements and and the proclamations there that's all what they do the divisions in Libya are not based on ethnic or religious or or or sectarian factors the divisions are purely political purely based on disagreement and how to share power and wealth libya's politicians were failing the Libyan people and failing to deliver basic services such as food fuel and security face-to-face talks between Prime Minister Suraj and general after in Abu Dhabi in May 2017 then again in Paris a year later fell short of any roadmap to stability most telling however was not what was discussed but where as fighting continued in September 2018 between rival militias seeking a share of Libya's loot Libya's fate is directly influenced by overseas powers once again looks to be resting in foreign as well as Libyan hands France in particular seems to be leaning more heavily towards towards the hafta camp and to be giving their their backing to have to mainly I think because they see in him a strong figure who can fight against terrorism he seems to be a more of a force for stability the Italians who are the other really big player in Libya on the other hand that their most of their interests in Libya are really in in the west of Libya partly because that's where a lot of the main migration flows going into to Italy what's the point of departure is Western Libya but also because of Italy has strong reliance on Libyan gas Libya is becoming a proxy a kind of war without a military getting involved Demers Egypt and to a certain extent Saudi Arabia one side and then Turkey Sudan and and cut in the other side and both of these sites have their own international controllers if you like I mean if the United States he wants to solve the problem Olivia they can do it very quickly unless the outside countries will leave us alone for some time and we Olivia's come to our senses to be able to agree to save our country maybe we're not able to maybe unfortunate will continue until we have no more weapons to fight each other Libya that we knew before is gone it's gone all what we see in front of us the scene now it's at the end it's taking us to this integration nothing is is bringing the country back to unity and every day we are closer to this final scene you
