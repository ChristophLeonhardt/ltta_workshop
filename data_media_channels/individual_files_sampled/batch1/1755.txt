for many years people have been fleeing Eritrea a steady stream crossed the border into Sudan but unable or unwilling to stay there they move on many end up in Europe others have made it across the Sinai Peninsula and managed to get into Israel today approximately 40,000 people from Africa have made it into the country having rejected most of their asylum applications the Israeli government now wants them out a new program has been announced accept deportations to a third country such as Rwanda or Uganda or end up in an Israeli prison it's here in pockets of relatively deprived southern Tel Aviv that thousands of Africans have made their home over recent years we'll hear from some of those who now stand to lose that home here on talk to Al Jazeera chuckling and Eden have lived in tel-aviv for about 10 years now both of them say the reason they fled Eritrea was to escape the military it's a familiar story according to a United Nations investigation based on interviews with 500 refugees around the world the military is in fact a recruitment tool for forced labour tracing its role to the country's long run in conflict with its neighbor Ethiopia Eritrea gained formal independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30 year long armed struggle but since then the situation along the border has remained tense with frequent violent clashes as a result the military here plays a central organizing role but beyond defending the country it has become an instrument of oppression according to rich ray and refugees young men are forced to serve for many years but not just to execute military duties the issues relating to Eritrea's military and / national service programs include the arbitrary and indefinite duration the use of conscripts as forced labor including manual labor the inhumane conditions of service rape and torture often associated with service and their devastating impact on family life and freedom of choice for the individuals overall the UN investigators concluded that quote the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity namely enslavement imprisonment enforced disappearance torture other inhumanities persecution rape and murder have been permitted in Eritrea since 1991 it also recommended referring the situation to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court a natural way out of the country is north to Sudan but that country is hardly a long term solution not too far away is Israel and many managed to cross into the country before Israel decided to build a barbed fence along its border with Egypt in the Sinai Peninsula but now the government here says it's time for the refugees to go well we've come here to Levinsky Garden in southern Televisa Park here where years ago many of the asylum seekers were simply brought on a bus and left and now it's become something of a central point for this community Tek late' came here in 2006 for a while he worked in a restaurant today he works for an NGO advocating on behalf of the African community here Eden came here 10 years ago with her husband and two kids since then she has given birth to a daughter who is now in kindergarten she also works for an NGO let's start at the beginning of your story how and why did you leave Eritrea how did you end up here in Israel when I was an earth day I was an athlete and they was also a student without any reason their turn region detained me and forced me to the army and I trained as a soldier and they asked them to give me a chance to return back to my studies and also to my training to become an athlete I was an athlete middle distance runner and they refused me there it is my time to go back to where I came from and at that point I left my country because I become hopeless in my own country I become dreamless in my own country and it's my country on southern seekers in the way to cross the border and stun the Kashmir my country military border guards and they asked me where I'm going and I told them I'm live in my country because of all the stuff that happened to me and they asked me to work with them the prison I told them I know a prison what's up like so I can to go to prison and I start to run away from them they shoot three times to kill me my skip it happens in Sudan from southern 16 November 2007 and the same thing happened in Sudan the Sudanese government started ten in two hundred overall the return essentially bitter and I run away from that and they came to Egypt to Cairo and the same thing happened Cairo so the only place that is close near to me was Israel so I came to Israel on the end of stolen seven through Sinai Peninsula commenting on Israel's new policy Prime Minister Netanyahu had this to say on January 21st we are taking actions against illegal immigrants who came here for work purposes Israel will continue to be a shelter for true refugees and will eject illegal infiltrators now the Israeli government's argument in all of this is that the vast majority of the Eritrean Sudanese asylum seekers are not asylum seekers it calls them infiltrators and people who are here for economic reasons I mean how would you respond to that what would happen to you you think if you went back to Eritrea first of all they never check out a second plane properly according internal oh so they have no reason to call as migrant workers or traders infiltrators why because they never give us a chance even some is there are asylum application systematically they block us to submit our claim even those who are climbing still weekend we didn't get answer for that sometimes they reject automatically out of hand for no reason without checking their claim so it is completely a lie it's not completely right why they are saying especially in the world more than 90 percent of air change accepts as refugees in Sudanese are the same number get accepted as refugees so why in Israel is zero Prince's almost zero point one person get a settler it's almost there is 10 people who get accepted as refugees as we seen in the last 10 years so you can understand is completely baseless it completely completely lie and in your own personal case what are the stakes I mean you you left because you deserted the army you were shot at crossing the border if you were simply to go home you obviously do yourself as an asylum seeker if you were to go home now what would happen to you first of all I left my country because I would not say that my country so if I go about my country I am sure there will be imprisonment because across the border illegally and active against the eastern region and against its crime so I'm in danger if I were caught my country first of all not just me every trend will have to the country will be in danger because we know now when we were on in our country we know nothing about the dictator regime but now we know everything what he is doing to my country and to our people for Eden the military also played a critical role in her and her husband's decision to leave Eritrea ten years ago so why did you leave what forced you out of Eritrea because for the men all the men that flee from Eritrea was most of them it was in the army unlimited Armenia even if the man is flee from the army then the government came they took or they arrested the family especially for why with the kiddies I don't want to be in prison because everytime prison is difficult prison like this underground prison it is so difficult you can eat one time in a day you sleep you can't sleep on the floor this is your own personal experience when your husband fled the army you were in prison for two months yes for two months I was with my daughter with now my daughter now he's 11 years old at that time she was like 1 and 1/2 and so you both ended up both you and your husband and your two children ended up in Sudan and a refugee camp what made you decide to come here because there is no so that is also the same situation like like a retire because we if you sit in the refugee camp there is a smugglers maybe they kidnap with you maybe they kidnap with the kiddies to get the money when I saw when I listened some it happened for someone my husband he told me let's go try to be to to get a safe place and then he decided to send me to Israel and then I can't read and so you you're here you've been here for for nearly a decade and you've been trying you say to apply for asylum what's happened how far is your asylum application yeah I try like four four days to apply the asylum refugee status but I didn't get any chance to Intel because there is a lot of people also the immigration they don't want submit the refugee asylum peppers because he decided to deport us to Rwanda if someone applies the refugee status it is to save for the from the deportation when you first arrived in Israel nine years ago you didn't apply I don't know no one can tell me this I don't know because before I was in my country I don't know how to do about refugees I don't know how to apply we came here to say if you get used to it we don't want them here and they can go to work that and what about the environment here in southern Tel Aviv's how do you get along with local people here other other major problems all the refugees are here and they suffer from the people of the Netherlands some neighbors are they are blame to us they are talking about color go back to Africa Shikoku she like this I don't care about this but tackle it and Eden and their fellow refugees are not fighting for their position alone we came to demonstrate against deportation we disagree with the decision of our government especially as Jews we are people of refugees of asylum seekers for 2,000 years and we are here to say now that we are in a sovereign state we have to deal with other asylum seekers worldwide in the last few weeks and months we've seen a real groundswell of Israeli voices kind of advocating on your behalf we've seen Holocaust survivors writing to the government we've seen people even talking about sheltering people in their homes Allah and Frank to prevent them from being deported what's that been like to witness from your perspective actually it is so quite interesting for me it's is not interested like it's not like surprised because the last 10 years I know these people fighting with me but their bow is never here in the media but then they keep fighting for my father and for the future for the picture of the country in the face value of the country it's not a duty value even like was the gardener doing they are also protecting the image of the country it's not just just about me it's about the country because the cont the government is like working very hard to destroy our musical community and to destroy the image of the country itself the last 10 years not the the government system but the people become my Savior become my family become part of me so the last 10 years I survived it because of the Israeli people and will be the Republic but the system is completely made to break me and met just to kick me out of the country and let me down many eretrians and others have already been transferred out of the country but the circumstances are murky and hard to verify as a result there is a lot of speculation a common story is that refugees are sent undercover to Rwanda or Uganda with some cash and that the government's there look the other way possibly in a deal with Israel in the meantime refugees are staying in an open detention center here in Israel called Hallett they are free to leave during the day but have to return by night the policy that is being now advanced either prison or a third country which is widely thought to be Rwanda there are some arguments that perhaps Uganda could be involved as well that policy when it comes to that choice if you were presented with that choice personally prison or forced deportation back to an African country which is not your own what choice would you make it's better for me to see both sides what is waiting for me in Rwanda or abundance of countries there is no system created or waiting for me to give me a shelter or a security you have to understand that there is no system at all for me or for us I'm secured committee and rest countries because we know in the last series those people who are forced to both countries were smuggled to other countries they were victims of Ana's smuggling they were victims of human trafficking they didn't Sarah they did in matrons is they did in Libya and slave auction as we sold so for me is like a can do that I can't to go to his countries because I know I'm asking protection in Israel I never asked protection in one or Amanda and secondly it's better for me to be safe till I go back to my home which means it's better for me to stay in prison than to go to you and or what not are you worried about your physical safety in either of those two countries or what is your main concern about being sent to one of those places both of them as a person I have a dream to grow and to become human being I have here for 10 years I start from scratch actually I know the language I know the culture I know the country I can survive now but they are push me to start from scratch again so I'm human being and to do I need to create my future also from start point I can't go back to this language as you said also for my physical protection I'm not protected at all in this country because as we saw last three years a lot of people who are deployed from Israel were killed so I don't be killed as well how people are feeling at the moment how seriously are people taking this threat that is coming from Israeli government that they are going to be forcibly deported to a country which isn't theirs I think all the single men are at it now because they know it will it will be happen there was also a lot of men that now in ha lot they get rejected follow says there is the detention center in yeah reject answer for that istic and so you think that this is going to target single men in particular and that they are under very realistic threat of imminent deportation yeah and you yourself you have a family you have three children one of them was born here what has it been like bringing them up in this environment when there is a lot of uncertainty and fear about what might happen what's it been like for the kids I don't know if it will be happen for others or for the kiddies I'm not going to Rwanda I will I would sit in there in the jail in prison it's better to sleep in prison but that's your view yeah because Africa is Africa this is the same situation and your children I mean a very conscious of what's happening yes they know what is happening and what do they say my daughter she's talking about Rwanda she said what is Rwanda I don't think the girl Wanda why the government authorized decided to do like this she said we are a human being she said also why the government gave me to to to change the country like a Canada Europa I told her there is no kind of this choice she said I don't need to go under because I don't know the language I don't know the country's told me if he need to deport us better to go Eritrea because she told me because we have a family in America it is better to do like the same I don't decide to go Rwanda so that's your 11 year old and you have a younger daughter as well in kindergarten I mean what's what's the situation for her she done about the procession is almost small but it is difficult because they put her alone like for the refugee kindergarten so for refugee only there is no any Israeli kids learn together in the kindergarten it is also until one in heavens 2 p.m. there is no any chance to put for her like after school I pay for her until I came to tech and your own situation I mean if if you found yourself on a plane heading to Rwanda what would that mean for you what would the prospect of life there be like for you I'm not going to Rwanda I would sit in the end the prison no matter how many long list it takes why is that what are you worried about that would happen by her because Rwanda is the same like I don't know Africa if I go through Wanda they can take all the papers documents in Rwanda Nina in the in the airport also I'm afraid to be to get like a slave trade like that happen in Libya I am I don't want do you think that the Israeli government is really going to do this or do you think they're just trying to scare people I don't know maybe they need to scare people because you can't do like by force if somebody's care if they will put an unlimited prison maybe someone they decide to go the Israeli government says that the vast majority of people here we've come from Sudan Eritrea the African infiltrators as they call them are here for economic reasons they're here to get better jobs to get a better lifestyle I mean how do you know it is not it is wrong it is not no one can come for a job because when I was in Eritrea I was working in the bank for accounting debit/credit I I don't want to work in cleaning better to work in a bank or better to continue my education but I don't know it is not the correct and your young daughter finally who was was born here do you think that she has a future in this country there is no future for her even she's born here there is no future because she's from Eritrea and so your your aspiration your hope is to stay here and for your whole family to stay and live in Israel permanent what is your hope my hope is I don't know my hope is if I get a chance I want to go out from Israel because I can't continue kind of this life it is not a life if I get the chance I'm trying to get the chance sponsored Canada if I get I'm so happy if not I will continue like for tech let the only long-term solution points back to retrial he wants nothing more than to return to what he still calls his country but first the situation there has to change and your own future over the next few years I mean what do you think what do you hope is gonna happen to you that's I believe in God so I'm praying God to give me a good teacher and also other person I know I have to fight back and work hard to change the policy of the government toward me it looks like in Iran so I have to become stronger and to be safe till something happened to my country
