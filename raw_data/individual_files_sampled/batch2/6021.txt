reimpose economic sanctions on Iran now this follows some of trumps warlike rhetoric on Twitter geared toward Iran and he did essentially pull out of the Iran nuclear deal which was negotiated by President Barack Obama back in 2015 Europe is very much against what's going on right now but here are the updates in terms of these sanctions so Trump said quote as we continue applying maximum economic pressure on the Iranian regime I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities including its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism I mean there's no mention of US support of terrorism when it's Saudi Arabia conducting the terroristic acts but nonetheless I'll move on Trump is also planning to renew other sanctions in three months including ones targeting Iran's lucrative oil industry so there are more sanctions that are set to take place or take effect in November of this year but so far the economic sanctions have begun so here's what I get out of this story there must be some powerful or lobbyists doing a lot of work inside the Trump administration now I'll tell you why so right now Iran has not broken the deal we broke in but it's not just us and Iran if we had broken it then Iran would be free to break it anyway because it doesn't exist anymore but there's actually other parties involved the European countries are allies but also Russia and others involved so those players say they deeply regret that America broke the deal and violated its terms but they are still willing to abide by the deal so as far as we know so is Iran so on in terms of the ashes Iran is not pushing towards war so they say one thing that was a little aggressive we are the mother peace but if your attackers will be the mother of wars Trump loses and does this maniacal tweet etc so you can say hey forces pushing for war or winning here and I think that's true but if you notice in Trump's tweet he also talked about hey look I'll sit down with him which is great which is you know you should never ripped up the deal in the first place it was a perfectly good deal all of our allies agree etc but he's one to sit with I'm fine that's good news but they specifically then talked about sanctions about their energy sector and and their oil now what will that do if US has sanctions on Iranian oil it will limit the supply of oil thereby increasing the price of oil yep now this is the second action in a week that massively helps oil companies the second was totally unrelated to this issue we talked about it last week it was how he was going to rip up the fuel standards for cars now you think no no that's for the car manufacturers no the car manufacturers at this point say don't do that that's gonna give us two different rules we don't want that it's gonna give us uncertainty but what it would do is create demand for a lot more oil because the cars are not fuel-efficient billions of dollars in oil so two decisions seemingly nothing to do with each other but the common theme is oil companies are the big winners here my guess is if you looked a little bit more into it and that's why Trump administration is one of the worst in transparency and are trying to make sure we cannot find out who they met with my guess is that some oil lobbies have been doing some substantial work inside the White House recently yeah that's that's a really good guess especially when you take all of this in caught in the context of what he's trying to do with fuel efficiency standards because remember that will increase our reliance on oil right and and that will make oil companies incredibly happy and when that story broke oil companies were the only it was the only industry that was happy about Trump ripping up those fuel efficiency standards the car industry is Jenk correctly mentioned was not in favor of it because now there's going to be this ongoing legal battle between some of the blue states that want efficient vehicles and the federal government which is essentially ripping out fuel efficiency ripping up fuel efficiency standards now just to point to Trump's maniacal tweet against Iran earlier he had tweeted to Iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the United States again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death be cautious so as you can see all caps very intense and it's just it's fascinating how he treats some countries while giving other countries a complete pass when they threaten us an example of that would be Russia way where they essentially showed a video during Vladimir Putin's address to Russia showing nukes hitting Tampa Florida it was a simulation but here's what he essentially showed everyone in the world and Trump said nothing about it and they had Florida so Iranians do not have nuclear weapons the Russians do the Iranians that not say we're gonna launch nukes against you the Russians did a simulation where they launch nukes against us that was during Putin's annual address to the country's Federal Assembly and what's in Florida well a couple of things one is United States Central Command directly threatening our Central Command by the way another thing that's in Florida is mar-a-lago but Trump said nothing about that nothing about never threaten us nothing about how dare you nothing about your nukes nothing about attacking Florida nothing at all so when the oil companies have money to make all of a sudden all caps doro doro knows when the russians go here here's our missiles hitting florida rub it in your face sorry sir yes sir of course at mr. Putin sir yes sir gee I wonder what Donald Trump's interests are I can't quite tell and just quickly going back to the whole oil issue remember Germany made a deal with Russia to essentially build another pipeline that would you know send oil from Russia to Germany and Trump specifically targeted Angela Merkel right the leader of Germany over that issue but there was absolutely no pressure toward Vladimir Putin no anger toward Vladimir Putin for making that deal all of the anger and intensity was directed toward Angela Merkel and I just thought that was fascinating so because he can't criticize Putin gee I wonder why that that would Putin him in trouble but Anna that's a great point because I hadn't thought of that that's actually a third time that he helps the oil companies right do not do deals where the our couple companies are circumvented don't do that because I really care about foreign policy I mean and it's Russia doing the deal but I can't criticize Russia so I'm gonna instead viciously attack our allies so and here he is by the way when you were upset it rips up the Iranian deal he all so attacks our allies because our allies support that deal want us to abide by that deal and our word that we gave but he thinks who cares I got a swamp to run where's my oil lobbyists two easy ways for the young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
