WAS THAT A MAN OR A WOMAN? BECAUSE HE NEEDS A HAIR CUT MORE THAN I DO. I COULDN'T TELL. HE NEEDS A HAIR CUT. Greg: THAT'S OUR DONALD. LAST NIGHT'S RALLY WAS NOTHING NEW. THE CROWD LOFERRED HIM. THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HATE HIM WILL JUST HATE HIM MORE. THE MEDIA PATS ITSELF ON THE HEAD FOR NOT COVERING IT WHILE SECRETLY WATCHING FOX NEWS TOO BAD THEY TOTALLY MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CALL HIM HITLER. SO FOR THE BIAS ELM PAIRED SO FOR THE BIAS ELM PA IED SO FOR THE BIAS ELM PA IMPAIRED HERE IS NEWS. HE GOT REMAINS OF 200 U.S. SOLDIERS BACK FROM NORTH KOREA WEEK AFTER ISSUE WAS RAISE. RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. HELPING WOMEN AND MEN. OUR G.D.P. CLIMBS HIGHER. SO, IF HE A MONSTER, HE MIGHT BE THE WORST MONSTER EVER. MEANING NOT A MONSTER AT ALL. THAT'S WHY OPTIMISM IS HIGH. 95% OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE A POSITIVE COMPANY OUTLOOK. IT'S GOOD NEWS. EVEN IF THE ELITES DENY IT. AND ABOUT THOSE ELITES. DO YOU EVER NOTICE THEY ALWAYS CALL THE OTHER SIDE, THE ELITE. WHY ARE THEY ELITE? I HAVE A MUCH BETTER APARTMENT THAN THEY DO. I'M SMARTER THAN THEY ARE. I'M RICHER THAN THEY ARE. I BECAME PRESIDENT AND THEY DIDN'T. AND I'M REPRESENTING THE GREATEST, SMARTEST, MOST LOYAL, BEST PEOPLE ON EARTH, THE DEPLORABLES. REMEMBER THAT? Greg: THAT'S KEY. BRAG SOMETHING NEVER APPEALING BUT IS HE NOT WRONG. THAT BY WEALTH HE IS AN ELITIST, YET, HE IS STILL EMBRACED BY WORKING CLASSES. NO WONDER THE DENIROS, UPON DOES ALL UNRALPH, TRUMP IS RICHER THAN THEM ALL BUT CLOSER TO THE STREET THAN THEY ARE. HOW CAN THAT BE? THE ANSWER IS HE MAKES PROMISES AND FIGHTS TO KEEP THEM. BESIDES FOR YOU DEPLORABLES AT THE RALLY THE OUTRAGE CELEBRITY CLASS WILL ALWAYS DEEM YOU TO BE THE UNCOOL KIDS. TRUMP DEFENDS YOU AGAINST THE JERKS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WEALTH OR APARTMENTS. IT'S ABOUT SPEAKING UP FOR PEOPLE THAT THE MEDIA CELEBRITY COMPLEX SNICKERS AT. AND IT'S WHY WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT THOSE SNICKERS SEEM TRULY FROM MARS. DID YOU LIKE THAT, DANA? Dana: YEAH AND A MILKY WAY. Greg: DO YOU LIKE THOSE PUNS. IS DONALD TRUMP A BIT LIKE YOUR RICH UNCLE TELLING WHY CAN'T YOUR BUDDY GET A HAIR CUT? Dana: I GREW UP IN WYOMING WHERE TIGHT SHORT HAIR CUT. MY AUNT DONNA IS THE ONE WHO DOES THE HAIRCUTS IN THE KITCHEN EVERY COUPLE WEEKS THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT TODAY. I WAS TRYING TO THINK ONE OTHER PERSON WHO HAD THIS ABILITY SOMEONE WHO WAS SUCCESSFUL, WEALTHY, CELEBRITY. STILL CONSIDERED BLUE COLLAR. Greg: ME. Dana: I CAME UP WITH CLINTON EASTWOOD. I THINK IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE ART THAT HE CHOSE. THE WAY HE CHOSE TO THE MOVIES HE DIRECTED. YOU HOW HE ACTED AND THINGS HE DID. THERE IS NOT MANY OTHERS. Greg: HE SPEAKS THE LANGUAGE, JESSE. IT'S LIKE BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE HAIR CUT THING. Jesse: SURE. Greg: I BELIEVE THE HAIR CUT THING IS BEING PRESENTABLE FOR A JOB. THAT'S HOW A SALESMAN LIKE GET A HAIR CUT, JESSE. Jesse: CLEAN IT UP, WATTERS. HE IS ALSO A MAN'S MAN. YOU SPEAK ABOUT THESE MAN BUNS AND YOU CAN MOCK A MAN BUN NOW. Kimberly: GREG DOES. Jesse: STILL CAN DO THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S APPEARANCE BECAUSE THEY MAY BE ACCUSED OF BEING INSENSITIVE. DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER BEEN AFRAID OF BEING CALLED INSENSITIVE. LIKE THE COMMON MAN FOR A FREE REASONS. HE HAS DEALT WITH CONTRACTORS ALL MY LIFE. CAN I SMELL A CONTRACTOR. IT'S TRUE. AS A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER YOU DEAL WITH THE PIPE FITTERS, THE MASONS, THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS AND HE IS GREAT AT THAT. HE ALSO EATS FAST FOOD. NOT FOR A PHOTO OP. BECAUSE HE ACTUALLY LIKES IT. Kimberly: IS HE LIKE US. JESS IN A BRASH STYLE THAT CONNECTS WITH THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. TO BE HONEST, IS HE THAT ASPIRATIONAL CELEBRITY. FOR MANY GENERATIONS PEOPLE IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LOOKED UP TO DONALD TRUMP. THEY LIKE THE WOMEN HE WAS AROUND. THEY LIKED THE PLANES. THEY LIKED THE STYLE. THEY LIKED THE JETS. IF YOU WANT TO BECOME RICH IN AMERICA, YOU YOU WANTED TO BE LIKE DONALD TRUMP. LET'S NOT FORGET BEFORE HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT ATHLETES WANTED TO LIVE IN TRUMP TOWER. ALL THE REAL ESTATE GUYS THEY WANTED SOME, YOU KNOW, TEE TIMES AT HIS GOLF CLUBS. Greg: MOST CITED CELEBRITY IN RAP MUSIC. JESS ANY WANTED A PIECE OF ACTION. THIS GUY WAS IT. THE MINUTE HE RUNS FOR PRESIDENT HE IS HITLER. Greg: THIS TRUMP DEALS WITH MASONS NOT FREE MASON. LIKE THE ELITE ESTABLISHMENT VS. THE EVERY DAY MAN. Dana: MY GRANDFATHER ON MY MOM'S SIDE. RAWLINGS, WYOMING. Greg: JUAN, I KNOW YOU LOVED THAT RALLY. YOU RECORDED IT AND PLAYED IT FIVE TIMES. Juan: THE QUESTION IS THE APARTMENT. HIS APARTMENT IS BETTER THAN THEIR APARTMENT. NOT ONLY BETTER, SMARTER, BETTER APARTMENT. OH MY GOD YOU THINK ABOUT A PETTY PERSON MAKES EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM. Greg: IS HE BEING FUNNY. Juan: I DON'T THINK HE IS BEING FUNNY, THAT'S HIM. I GOT A BETTER APARTMENT SO HOW COME I'M NOT ELITE? Kimberly: YOU TAKE EVERYTHING SO LITERALLY. Juan: HE WAS TRYING TO SAY THAT HE HE COULD BE IN THAT GROUP BUT YOU LOVE ME AND I LOVE YOU. THAT'S WHAT I GOT OUT OF IT. Juan: NO, NO, NO. I WILL TELL WHAT YOU IT WAS. Greg: IT WASN'T INSULTING TO ANYBODY. Juan: WORTHY OF MOCKERY. MY APARTMENT IS BIGGER THAN YOURS, MY BUTTON IS BIGGER THAN YOURS. THIS IS HOW HE TALKS. HOW HE RELATES TO PEOPLE THESE OTHER CELEBRITIES DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE WORKING MAN. LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING, I'M NOT SURE HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE WORKING MAN ON SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM PARENTS. I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE WORKING MAN. WHAT HE DOES IS. Greg: HE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER NOW. Juan: HOT BUTTON ISSUES AND FEAR. YOU CAN HATE HILLARY CLINTON. HE HAD THE CROWD LAST NIGHT CHANTING LOCK HER UP. HE CAN SAY THINGS LIKE GO HOME TO YOUR MOM TO THIS GUY. WHY DON'T YOU GET A HAIR CUT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A MAN OR A WOMAN. Greg: THAT'S A TERRIBLE IMPRESSION, JUAN. Juan: HE HATES ON CLINTON. HE HATES ON EVERYBODY THEN HE SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE WHOSE HISPANICS, THEY ARE TERRIBLE, TOO. Greg: WHAT'S THAT BEEN HISPANICS? I MISSED THAT I THINK HE MEANT MS-13. Greg: HIS APPEAL IS BASED ON HATEFUL LANGUAGE AND HE APPEALS TO THE WORSE. Greg: SO WE'RE ALL BAD PEOPLE. KIMBERLY? Kimberly: I THINK AMERICA IS GREAT. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING THAT LAST NIGHT WHAT AN INCREDIBLE COUNTRY AND SUPPORTERS AND TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. HE HAS ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH AND HAD TREMENDOUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS LIKE WE REITERATED NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS SHOW. I DON'T KNOW, FOR MYSELF IN TERMS OF AS A PUERTO RICAN WOMAN AND LOOKING AT OTHER MINORITIES. QUITE PLEASED THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP IN TERMS OF THEIR FAVORABILITY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, YES. AND YOU SEE KEY NUMBERS GOING DOWN, UNEMPLOYMENT. WHY WOULDN'T SOMEBODY BE HAPPY ABOUT THAT? LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT FOR WOMEN, FOR MINORITIES. FOR HISPANICS, FOR BLACKS. ISIS GONE. WE HAVE GOT RECORD JOB NUMBERS. Jesse: KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT IS BETTER THAN YOURS. Juan: I BET IT IS. HE NOT ONLY WAS ATTACKING PELOSI AND CLINTON. HE THEN GOES AFTER JOHN
