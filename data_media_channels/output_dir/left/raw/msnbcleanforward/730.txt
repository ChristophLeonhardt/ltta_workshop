YOUR BELIEF IN OUR WONDERFUL SYSTEM, AND TO WATCH THE WAY

164
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,468
SYSTEM, AND TO WATCH THE WAY THAT YOU AND THE OTHERS HERE ON

00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:37,139
THAT YOU AND THE OTHERS HERE ON THIS PANEL HAVE STARTED TO LOSE

00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:39,875
DON’T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BLAME YOU.

00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:44,214
BLAME YOU. AND WHAT I WAS SAYING THAT DAY

00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:50,086
AND WHAT I WAS SAYING THAT DAY IS THAT THAT PINK BUBBLE WHAT

00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:55,391
PEOPLE WERE IN, THE PINK HIGH, THE SORT OF BELIEF THAT IT WILL

00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,893
THE SORT OF BELIEF THAT IT WILL BE GREAT, SHE’LL WIN, WE’LL HAVE

00:05:56,894 --> 00:06:00,296
BE GREAT, SHE’LL WIN, WE’LL HAVE OUR FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT, I’M

176
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,498
OUR FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT, I’M HEARING THAT RIGHT NOW ABOUT

177
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,899
HEARING THAT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THIS ELECTION.

178
00:06:02,934 --> 00:06:05,101
THIS ELECTION. WE’RE GOING TO GET THE HOUSE

179
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:05,401
WE’RE GOING TO GET THE HOUSE BACK.

180
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,770
BACK. PEOPLE ARE ALREADY BELIEVING

181
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,105
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY BELIEVING THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

182
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,808
THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT YOU SPEND

183
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:12,942
FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT YOU SPEND BELIEVING THAT WE’RE GOING TO

184
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:17,814
BELIEVING THAT WE’RE GOING TO GET THE HOUSE BACK IS A MINUTE

185
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:18,515
GET THE HOUSE BACK IS A MINUTE XWOGS

186
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,584
XWOGS GOING TOWARD THAT NOT HAPPENING.

187
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:22,218
GOING TOWARD THAT NOT HAPPENING. THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF US

188
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:25,521
THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF US HAVING TWO MORE YEARS OF THIS

189
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:29,659
HAVING TWO MORE YEARS OF THIS AND THEN ANOTHER TERM OF DONALD

190
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:29,993
AND THEN ANOTHER TERM OF DONALD TRUMP.

191
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:30,727
TRUMP. AND PEOPLE SAID THAT WON’T

192
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:31,228
AND PEOPLE SAID THAT WON’T HAPPEN.

193
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:32,563
HAPPEN. THAT’S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT

194
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:37,834
THAT’S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT BUSH, W. WOULDN’T GET A SECOND

195
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:38,501
BUSH, W. WOULDN’T GET A SECOND TERM.

196
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,636
TERM. I DON’T BELIEVE THAT.

197
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,338
I DON’T BELIEVE THAT. AND I EMBRACE EVERY SINGLE DAY

198
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,439
AND I EMBRACE EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN I WAKE UP THE FACT THAT

199
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:44,941
WHEN I WAKE UP THE FACT THAT THIS COULD BE A TWO TERM TRUMP

200
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:48,077
THIS COULD BE A TWO TERM TRUMP AND THAT WE WON’T WIN THE HOUSE

201
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,646
AND THAT WE WON’T WIN THE HOUSE BACK ON NOVEMBER 6.

202
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:50,547
BACK ON NOVEMBER 6. >> MIKA.

203
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,150
>> MIKA. >> WELL, I’LL TELL YOU, MICHAEL,

204
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,751
>> WELL, I’LL TELL YOU, MICHAEL, I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.

205
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,019
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. I THINK EVERYONE HAS LEARNED NOT

206
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:59,456
I THINK EVERYONE HAS LEARNED NOT TO PROGNOSTICATE WITH TOO MUCH

207
00:06:59,457 --> 00:06:59,856
TO PROGNOSTICATE WITH TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE.

208
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,459
CONFIDENCE. WE FELT WE SAW SOMETHING

209
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:02,859
WE FELT WE SAW SOMETHING HAPPENING.

210
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,928
HAPPENING. AND AS YOU DESCRIBE THE ARC OF

211
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,730
AND AS YOU DESCRIBE THE ARC OF OUR MINDSET AS IT SORT OF

212
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,832
OUR MINDSET AS IT SORT OF TRANSFORMED OR EVOLVED OVER THE

213
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,367
TRANSFORMED OR EVOLVED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, IT HAS BECOME

214
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,736
PAST TWO YEARS, IT HAS BECOME NOT JUST A BATTLE OF LEFT AND

215
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,171
NOT JUST A BATTLE OF LEFT AND RIGHT, NOT JUST A BATTLE OVER

216
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,673
RIGHT, NOT JUST A BATTLE OVER JUST HOW BAD OR HOW FAR HE WILL

217
00:07:16,675 --> 00:07:18,008
JUST HOW BAD OR HOW FAR HE WILL GO, I DON’T THINK ANYONE

218
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:20,343
GO, I DON’T THINK ANYONE ACTUALLY HAD A SENSE OF HOW BAD

219
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:22,379
ACTUALLY HAD A SENSE OF HOW BAD THIS COULD BE IF YOU THINK THIS

220
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
THIS COULD BE IF YOU THINK THIS IS BAD.

221
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:28,552
IS BAD. BUT NOW IT IS A DAILY BATTLE TO

222
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:29,887
BUT NOW IT IS A DAILY BATTLE TO MAINTAIN, ESTABLISH, HOLD ON TO

223
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:30,521
MAINTAIN, ESTABLISH, HOLD ON TO THE TRUTH.

224
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:35,392
THE TRUTH. I THINK IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS

225
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:35,692
I THINK IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS TIME.

226
00:07:35,694 --> 00:07:36,894
TIME. JOE IS CONFIDENT THAT THE

227
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:37,494
JOE IS CONFIDENT THAT THE INSTITUTIONS WILL HOLD.

228
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:40,197
INSTITUTIONS WILL HOLD. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

229
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:40,664
WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> NO.

230
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,901
>> NO. I LOVE JOE, BUT HE IS WRONG ON

231
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:44,201
I LOVE JOE, BUT HE IS WRONG ON THIS.

232
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,704
THIS. IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT HE IS

233
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,072
IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT HE IS STILL TRYING TO CLING TO THAT

234
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,106
STILL TRYING TO CLING TO THAT HOPE, BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK HOPE

235
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,175
HOPE, BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK HOPE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING WE

236
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,576
IS THE MOST DANGEROUS THING WE COULD HAVE.

237
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:54,912
COULD HAVE. I THINK THAT TO SIT AND BELIEVE

238
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:57,114
I THINK THAT TO SIT AND BELIEVE THAT -- HERE IS THE THING.

239
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:59,416
THAT -- HERE IS THE THING. DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE A SELF

240
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,317
DEMOCRACY DOES NOT HAVE A SELF CORRECTING MECHANISM.

241
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,719
CORRECTING MECHANISM. SO AS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER

242
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,221
SO AS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE CLIFF, THERE IS NOTHING

243
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:05,623
TO THE CLIFF, THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS GOING TO PULL US BACK.

244
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,124
THAT IS GOING TO PULL US BACK. THERE IS NOTHING -- DEMOCRACY,

245
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:08,592
THERE IS NOTHING -- DEMOCRACY, THE ONE WE HAVE, ACTUALLY IS

246
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:11,028
THE ONE WE HAVE, ACTUALLY IS JUST A PIECE OF PAPER.

247
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,397
JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. AND IN EACH ERA, THE HUMANS, THE

248
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:14,832
AND IN EACH ERA, THE HUMANS, THE PEOPLE, THE CITIZENS ARE THE

249
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,733
PEOPLE, THE CITIZENS ARE THE ONES WHO DETERMINE HOW THAT

250
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,302
ONES WHO DETERMINE HOW THAT PIECE OF PAPER IS INTERPRETED

251
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:19,704
PIECE OF PAPER IS INTERPRETED AND WHAT WE’LL LIVE BY AND BE

252
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:20,505
AND WHAT WE’LL LIVE BY AND BE BY.

253
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,807
BY. BUT THIS IS -- NOBODY SHOULD

254
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:27,111
BUT THIS IS -- NOBODY SHOULD BELIEVE THAT -- AND I SHOW THIS

255
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:30,715
BELIEVE THAT -- AND I SHOW THIS IN THE FILM.

256
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:34,252
IN THE FILM. GERMANY IN THE 30s OIT’30s WAS

257
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,552
GERMANY IN THE 30s OIT’30s WAS CULTURED, THEY READ MORE BOOKS,

258
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:36,721
CULTURED, THEY READ MORE BOOKS, THEY WERE WELL EDUCATED, THEY

259
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:38,256
THEY WERE WELL EDUCATED, THEY WERE A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY.

260
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:41,658
WERE A LIBERAL DEMOCRACY. THE POPULAR VOTE IN 1932 WAS WON

261
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,627
THE POPULAR VOTE IN 1932 WAS WON BY THE LIBERAL LEFT PARTIES.

262
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,463
BY THE LIBERAL LEFT PARTIES. HITLER WON WITH ONLY 32% OF THE

263
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:45,763
HITLER WON WITH ONLY 32% OF THE VOTES.

264
00:08:45,764 --> 00:08:47,932
VOTES. AND THEN THEY HAD A NATIONAL

265
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,769
AND THEN THEY HAD A NATIONAL EMERGENCY WHERE THEIR PARLIAMENT

266
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,870
EMERGENCY WHERE THEIR PARLIAMENT WAS RUN DOWN THROUGH SOME SORT

267
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:54,272
WAS RUN DOWN THROUGH SOME SORT OF ACT OF TERRORISM AND THAT WAS

268
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:58,376
OF ACT OF TERRORISM AND THAT WAS USED AS AN EXCUSE TO DO X, Y OR

269
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:58,610
USED AS AN EXCUSE TO DO X, Y OR Z.

270
00:08:58,644 --> 00:08:59,878
Z. LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO, THIS

271
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,746
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO, THIS MAN IN THE OVAL OFFICE SUGGESTED

272
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,781
MAN IN THE OVAL OFFICE SUGGESTED THAT THE LICENSE OF THIS VERY

273
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:05,116
THAT THE LICENSE OF THIS VERY NETWORK THAT WE ARE SITTING HERE

274
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:08,386
NETWORK THAT WE ARE SITTING HERE IN THE STUDIO TODAY SHOULD BE --

275
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,289
IN THE STUDIO TODAY SHOULD BE -- WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT TO DO,

276
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,424
WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT TO DO, SHOULD NBC STILL HAVE A LICENSE

277
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:14,092
SHOULD NBC STILL HAVE A LICENSE TO BROADCAST.

278
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:15,093
TO BROADCAST. >> AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME BY

279
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:15,560
>> AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE WAY.

280
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,795
THE WAY. >> NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

281
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:21,399
>> NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND HE IS NOT SUGGESTING PULLING

282
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,967
AND HE IS NOT SUGGESTING PULLING SOME SOCIALIST RAG THAT YOU

283
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,804
SOME SOCIALIST RAG THAT YOU COULD GET ON THE CORNER OUTSIDE

284
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,371
COULD GET ON THE CORNER OUTSIDE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

285
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:30,008
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. HE IS TALKING ABOUT NETWORK

286
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,878
HE IS TALKING ABOUT NETWORK PEOPLE AND THIS NETWORK BECAUSE

287
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:35,714
PEOPLE AND THIS NETWORK BECAUSE YOU MIGHT RUN SOMETHING THAT HE

288
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,149
YOU MIGHT RUN SOMETHING THAT HE DOESN’T AGREE WITH, HE BELIEVES

289
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,116
DOESN’T AGREE WITH, HE BELIEVES HE HAS THE POWER.

290
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:39,384
HE HAS THE POWER. AND LET JUST SAY TO HIS CREDIT

291
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:41,219
AND LET JUST SAY TO HIS CREDIT HE IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN

292
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:42,887
HE IS REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN MOST CEOs IN THE SENSE THAT THEY

293
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,123
MOST CEOs IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DON’T RUN THEIR COMPANIES LIKE A

294
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:45,523
DON’T RUN THEIR COMPANIES LIKE A DEMOCRACY.

295
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:47,526
DEMOCRACY. THAT IS NOT HOW BUSINESS IS RUN.

296
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:49,995
THAT IS NOT HOW BUSINESS IS RUN. THAT IS NOT WHAT HE IS USED TO.

297
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,430
THAT IS NOT WHAT HE IS USED TO. AND THE ONES WHO ARE

298
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:52,564
AND THE ONES WHO ARE BILLIONAIRE, THEY LIKE THE FACT

299
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,032
BILLIONAIRE, THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN

300
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:54,666
THAT THEY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN EVERYBODY ELSE.

301
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,035
EVERYBODY ELSE. AND SO THEY WANT THE SYSTEM

302
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,937
AND SO THEY WANT THE SYSTEM RIGGED SO THAT THEY END UP WITH

303
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:00,572
RIGGED SO THAT THEY END UP WITH MOST OF THE PIE AND EVERYBODY

304
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,741
MOST OF THE PIE AND EVERYBODY ELSE FIGHTS FOR THE CRUMBS.

305
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,343
ELSE FIGHTS FOR THE CRUMBS. THAT IS THE SYSTEM THEY LIKE.

306
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:07,512
THAT IS THE SYSTEM THEY LIKE. AND IT IS NOT CALLED DEMOCRACY.

307
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,948
AND IT IS NOT CALLED DEMOCRACY. IT IS AN AUTOCRACY, THE WAY THAT

308
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,049
IT IS AN AUTOCRACY, THE WAY THAT THEY PREFER TO RULE, IT IS THE

309
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,651
THEY PREFER TO RULE, IT IS THE WAY THAT HE PREFERS TO RULE.

310
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,588
WAY THAT HE PREFERS TO RULE. AND HE JUST HAD A MUCH LARGER

311
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,357
AND HE JUST HAD A MUCH LARGER AND KRIZCRAZIER VERSION OF IT.

312
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:19,725
AND KRIZCRAZIER VERSION OF IT. BUT I THINK THAT OUR PROBLEM

313
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,960
BUT I THINK THAT OUR PROBLEM BACK TWO YEARS AGO IS THAT

314
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:22,594
BACK TWO YEARS AGO IS THAT PEOPLE DID NOT TAKE HIM

315
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:22,961
PEOPLE DID NOT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.

316
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,528
SERIOUSLY. HE WAS JUST A JOKE.

317
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,164
HE WAS JUST A JOKE. HE IS CRAZY.

318
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:28,534
HE IS CRAZY. YOU KNOW, HE IS COO-COO FOR

319
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:30,235
YOU KNOW, HE IS COO-COO FOR COCOA PUFFS AND THAT IS IT.

320
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:32,371
COCOA PUFFS AND THAT IS IT. NO, THAT WASN’T IT.

321
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:37,176
NO, THAT WASN’T IT. I SAID THEN, I SAY IT NOW, HE

322
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,377
I SAID THEN, I SAY IT NOW, HE OUTSMARTED EVERYBODY.

323
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:41,247
OUTSMARTED EVERYBODY. HE OUTSMARTED THE CAMPAIGN OF

EVERYBODY WORKS FOR THAT JERK BY THE WAY, EVERYBODY AT WORK TODAY

00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,848
WAS GOING ON AND WHY HE BECAME SO BELOVED.

359
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,483
SO BELOVED. >> MICHAEL IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

TOOK DONALD TRUMP SERIOUSLY AS A.

363
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,057
A. UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY, MOST

364
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:58,891
UP UNTIL ELECTION DAY, MOST PEOPLE IN THE HILLARY CLINTON

365
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,859
PEOPLE IN THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN, MOST PEOPLE IN THE

366
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,760
CAMPAIGN, MOST PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA DIDN’T THINK THAT HE WAS

367
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,061
MEDIA DIDN’T THINK THAT HE WAS GOING TO WIN.

368
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:03,729
GOING TO WIN. DON’T YOU THINK THOUGH THAT

369
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,231
DON’T YOU THINK THOUGH THAT PROGRESSIVES AND DEMOCRATS HAVE

370
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:07,366
PROGRESSIVES AND DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ACTIVATED BECAUSE OF HIS

371
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:11,771
BEEN ACTIVATED BECAUSE OF HIS ELECTION TO ACT IN 2018 AND

372
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:12,071
ELECTION TO ACT IN 2018 AND 2020?

373
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:14,040
2020? I KNOW NEITHER JOE, MIKA OR AND

374
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,075
I KNOW NEITHER JOE, MIKA OR AND I AND I CAN’T REMEMBER ANYONE ON

375
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,743
I AND I CAN’T REMEMBER ANYONE ON THE SET SAYING THERE IS NO WAY

376
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,045
THE SET SAYING THERE IS NO WAY THAT HE WILL WIN IN 2020.

377
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,381
THAT HE WILL WIN IN 2020. I THINK PEOPLE ARE ON HEIGHTENED

378
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,482
I THINK PEOPLE ARE ON HEIGHTENED ALERT BECAUSE THEY WERE

379
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,149
ALERT BECAUSE THEY WERE SURPRISED BY 2016.

380
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:24,985
SURPRISED BY 2016. >> I WAS THINKING BACK FOR WHAT

381
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,353
>> I WAS THINKING BACK FOR WHAT DID WE KNOW WHEN WE HAD THAT

382
00:12:26,387 --> 00:12:27,153
DID WE KNOW WHEN WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION.

383
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,956
CONVERSATION. AND WHAT HAVE WE SINCE LEARNED,

384
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,057
AND WHAT HAVE WE SINCE LEARNED, WHAT WE COULDN’T HAVE KNOWN.

385
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,792
WHAT WE COULDN’T HAVE KNOWN. AND I THINK WE KNEW THAT HE WAS

386
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,259
AND I THINK WE KNEW THAT HE WAS A BAD GUY.

387
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,095
A BAD GUY. HE WAS A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST.

388
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:38,698
HE WAS A MALIGNANT NARCISSIST. THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT WAS IN.

389
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,366
THE EVIDENCE FOR THAT WAS IN. I THINK THE TWO THINGS THAT GET

390
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:43,170
I THINK THE TWO THINGS THAT GET TO YOUR QUESTION OF FUTURE OF

391
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:44,671
TO YOUR QUESTION OF FUTURE OF KIND OF ACTIVISM AND PEOPLE

392
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:47,974
KIND OF ACTIVISM AND PEOPLE TAKING BACK THE COUNTRY, THE TWO

393
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,111
TAKING BACK THE COUNTRY, THE TWO THINGS WOULD HE HAVE WE’VE LEARN

394
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,646
THINGS WOULD HE HAVE WE’VE LEARN KIND OF FAITH IN INSTITUTIONS, I

395
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,214
KIND OF FAITH IN INSTITUTIONS, I THINK WE’VE REALIZED AT LEAST

396
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,449
THINK WE’VE REALIZED AT LEAST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AND I

397
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,417
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AND I THINK YOUR AND SOME OTHERS THAT

398
00:12:57,418 --> 00:12:58,885
THINK YOUR AND SOME OTHERS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY AS A COUNTRY

399
00:12:58,886 --> 00:13:00,520
WE ARE ACTUALLY AS A COUNTRY HELD TOGETHER MUCH MORE BY

400
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:03,390
HELD TOGETHER MUCH MORE BY CULTURE AND NORMS AND ACTS OF

401
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:06,426
CULTURE AND NORMS AND ACTS OF BRAVERY THAN BY INSTITUTIONS.

402
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:08,128
BRAVERY THAN BY INSTITUTIONS. AND WE HAVE GREAT INSTITUTIONS,

403
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:09,896
AND WE HAVE GREAT INSTITUTIONS, BUT THEY HAVEN’T STOPPED HIM

404
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:12,799
BUT THEY HAVEN’T STOPPED HIM FROM A BUNCH OF THINGS, WHETHER

405
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,135
FROM A BUNCH OF THINGS, WHETHER IT IS THE MUSLIM BAN, WHETHER IT

406
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:15,836
IT IS THE MUSLIM BAN, WHETHER IT IS FAMILY SEPARATION, WHETHER IT

407
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,570
IS FAMILY SEPARATION, WHETHER IT IS DECLARING THE PLEAD I CAN’T

408
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,639
IS DECLARING THE PLEAD I CAN’T THE ENEMY.

409
00:13:19,641 --> 00:13:25,145
THE ENEMY. PEOPLE AND PERHAPS HIS RHETORIC.

410
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,781
PEOPLE AND PERHAPS HIS RHETORIC. WE ARE HELD TOGETHER BY WHETHER

411
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:29,550
WE ARE HELD TOGETHER BY WHETHER PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO

412
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,150
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO STEP UP.

413
00:13:30,152 --> 00:13:32,753
STEP UP. AND IN HIS OWN PARTY, IN HIS OWN

414
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:36,457
AND IN HIS OWN PARTY, IN HIS OWN SQUAD, THAT BRAVERY HAS BEEN

415
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,559
SQUAD, THAT BRAVERY HAS BEEN TOTALLY AN SEPTEMBERBSENTABSENT.

416
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,259
TOTALLY AN SEPTEMBERBSENTABSENT. AT LEAST THAT PART OF THE

417
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:41,661
AT LEAST THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AND HIS MOVEMENT HAS

418
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:44,832
COUNTRY AND HIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN PROFOUNDLY UNCOURAGEOUS

419
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,165
BEEN PROFOUNDLY UNCOURAGEOUS COUNTRY.

420
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,500
COUNTRY. THE SECOND THING THAT HAS BEEN

421
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,469
THE SECOND THING THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED IS THAT THE FOR UHE

422
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:51,472
REVEALED IS THAT THE FOR UHE LIST TURNED OUT TO BE IN HIS

423
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:53,908
LIST TURNED OUT TO BE IN HIS GOVERNING A BILLIONAIRE GIVEAWAY

424
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:55,576
GOVERNING A BILLIONAIRE GIVEAWAY GUY, A BILLIONAIRE WHO IS

425
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,278
GUY, A BILLIONAIRE WHO IS PROBABLY NOT EVEN REALLY A

426
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,746
PROBABLY NOT EVEN REALLY A BILLION THEIR HIMSELF GIVING

427
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,381
BILLION THEIR HIMSELF GIVING MONEY TO OTHER BILLIONAIRES AND

428
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,182
MONEY TO OTHER BILLIONAIRES AND USING HIS TIME IN THE WHITE

429
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:02,349
USING HIS TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO SCREW THE PEOPLE WHO

430
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:04,284
HOUSE TO SCREW THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM BY GIVING THEM

431
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:04,652
VOTED FOR HIM BY GIVING THEM BILLIONS.

432
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:06,087
BILLIONS. AND I THINK THAT IS WHY TO COME

433
00:14:06,088 --> 00:14:08,689
AND I THINK THAT IS WHY TO COME AROUND TO YOUR POINT THERE IS AN

434
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,558
AROUND TO YOUR POINT THERE IS AN EXTRA ORDINARY THING HAPPENING

435
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,992
EXTRA ORDINARY THING HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTRY, YES, IT IS

436
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:12,759
IN THIS COUNTRY, YES, IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE

437
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,061
ABOUT PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND THAT IS HAPPENING.

438
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,496
AND THAT IS HAPPENING. YES, IT IS ABOUT MORE WOMEN

439
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,698
YES, IT IS ABOUT MORE WOMEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE THAN EVER,

440
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:18,499
RUNNING FOR OFFICE THAN EVER, BUT I THINK IT IS EVEN EVIDENCE

441
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,100
BUT I THINK IT IS EVEN EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING DEEPER.

442
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,935
OF SOMETHING DEEPER. I THINK FOR 30 OR 40 YEARS, TO

443
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:24,105
I THINK FOR 30 OR 40 YEARS, TO GO BACK TO YOUR CEO POINT, WE

444
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,907
GO BACK TO YOUR CEO POINT, WE BELIEVED THE PHONY STORY ABOUT

445
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,110
BELIEVED THE PHONY STORY ABOUT HOW WE MAKE CHANGE, WHICH IS

446
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:29,844
HOW WE MAKE CHANGE, WHICH IS THAT IT IS TRICKLE DOWN, IT IS

447
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:32,113
THAT IT IS TRICKLE DOWN, IT IS COMPANY, MARKETS, FACEBOOK, IT

448
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:32,680
COMPANY, MARKETS, FACEBOOK, IT IS BUSINESS.

449
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:34,315
IS BUSINESS. AND I THINK WE’VE REALIZED TRUMP

450
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:36,684
AND I THINK WE’VE REALIZED TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY DONE US THE

451
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:37,985
HAS ACTUALLY DONE US THE ENORMOUS FAVOR REALIZING A

452
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,420
ENORMOUS FAVOR REALIZING A COUNTRY IS NO BETTER THAN ITS

453
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,022
COUNTRY IS NO BETTER THAN ITS PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, NO BETTER

454
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:43,224
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, NO BETTER THAN ITS GOVERNMENT.

455
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,026
THAN ITS GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THERE IS AN

456
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,794
AND I THINK THERE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT LOOMING IN

457
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,496
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT LOOMING IN WHICH WE HAVE AN AGE OF REFORM

458
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:51,933
WHICH WE HAVE AN AGE OF REFORM IN THIS COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY

459
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,534
IN THIS COUNTRY AND ACTUALLY WREE BUILD EVERY

SOCIAL CONTRACT, OUR DEEP SYSTEMS SO THAT THIS NEVER

00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:58,740
SYSTEMS SO THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

464
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,642
HAPPENS AGAIN. >> AND WHEN YOU SAY IT IS AN

I KNOW HOW THEY RAISE THEIR KIDS.

477
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,927
KIDS. THEY ARE NOT LIKE HIM.

478
00:15:18,928 --> 00:15:21,529
THEY ARE NOT LIKE HIM. IF ANY OF THEIR KIDS CAME HOME

479
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,831
IF ANY OF THEIR KIDS CAME HOME AND SAID ANY OF THE THINGS THAT

00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,668
HE SAYS, THOSE KIDS WOULD BE THROWN OUT OF THE HOUSE.

482
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:29,538
THROWN OUT OF THE HOUSE. IF THEY WERE MARRIED TO SOMEONE

483
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,273
IF THEY WERE MARRIED TO SOMEONE WHO TREATED THEM THE WAY HE HAS

484
