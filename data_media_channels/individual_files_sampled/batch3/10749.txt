Iraqi refugees in the country's Anbar province feel safer in camps than in the homes they're being forced to return to as according to a joint report called the long road home from three humanitarian organizations the report says 84 percent of refugees feel much safer in their camps only 1% of sure they still have a house to return to well half of those questioned they actually know their homes were destroyed testimonies and the report appeared to reflect those figures we didn't make it to this place without seeing death with our own eyes a thousand times I can't return to Ramadi my house was damaged by Isis I'm worried about the camp management telling us to leave and return home I heard rumors that they might close the camp but there's nothing official lots of my friends have returned to Ramadi but I can't go I can't afford to repair my house we are stuck in here like sheep last month annatee crew was filming in the Iraqi city of Mosul which was liberated from ISIL about a year ago but as these pictures show they're still little sign of the city returning to normal locals claim the authorities have no idea what the situation is really like on the ground how many bodies have you removed since you started working in this area approximately five hundred are there any more yes in houses and on their odds I challenge any member of parliament to live in the conditions we are currently living in here I bet they are even afraid of entering this area they have no idea how horrible the smell is or how critical the medical situation is we haven't received any kind of aid or support since things finished there seven months ago only on one occasion did I receive a small box of food no coupons no food nothing Melanie Markham from the Norwegian Refugee Council who worked on the report says refugees fear traps and violent reprisals if indeed they do return home there's a number of dangers I think one of the largest threats is that of unexploded bombs unexploded mortars and booby traps and in fact we heard one report of a family who returned home only to find their house booby-trapped and it killed a family member some of the other things that make it unsafe for people are violence from the community around them people who even are suspected of having links with Isis are particularly vulnerable but other people under the threat of violence by members of their own tribal community so there are a number of reasons why it's unsafe still unsafe for people to return home
