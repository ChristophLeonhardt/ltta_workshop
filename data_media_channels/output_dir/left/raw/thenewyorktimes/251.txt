1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
“A well regulated Militia,”

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,400
“A well regulated Militia,”

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,310
“being necessary”

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,410
“to the security
of a free State”

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,220
“comma —”

6
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,220
“the right of the people”

7
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,853
“to keep and”

8
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:10,086
“bear arms”

9
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:11,020
“shall not be infringed.”

10
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,540
“shall not be infringed.”

11
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,280
“What exactly does that mean?”

12
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,120
So it’s only 27 words long,
but it is probably

13
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,870
the most cryptic part of the
United States Constitution.

14
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,820
It’s hard to know
what the connection is

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,240
between the two phrases
in the Second Amendment.

16
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,870
One of them seems to
announce a collective right

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,830
and the second
an individual one —

18
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,110
and knowing how
they are connected

19
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,720
is the key to
understanding

20
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,390
the Second Amendment.

21
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,510
If you read that
first clause by itself,

22
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,230
a well-regulated militia
is one that the government

23
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,920
has taken pains to control.

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,660
“American riflemen

25
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,910
are the best riflemen
in the world

26
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,760
because the
training they get

27
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,790
is the best in the world.”

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,190
You would think the
Second Amendment protects

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,440
a collective right to
keep and bear arms,

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
which is how
it was understood

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,780
for a long, long time in the
history of the United States.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,480
The second clause cuts
in a different direction.

33
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,680
If you read this by itself,
it would seem to say

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,390
you have a personal
right to keep and bear arms.

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,280
However, when the
Constitution speaks

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,190
of the right of the
people, it sometimes

37
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,740
speaks in a more collective
sense rather than individual.

38
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,420
Let me discuss for a second
“to keep and bear arms.”

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,360
Most scholars agree
that to keep arms

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,240
is something you do
as an individual,

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
but to bear arms has
more of a military flavor.

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,790
What precisely the
framers meant by arms

43
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,525
is the subject of
a lot of dispute.

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,010
So the contemporary,
modern interpretation

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,910
of the Second Amendment
as protecting

46
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,320
an individual right
to keep and bear arms

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,580
is only 10 years old.

48
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,040
In that case, the
Supreme Court struck down

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,930
what was probably the
toughest gun control

50
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,920
law in the nation,
in Washington, D.C.

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,140
“We hold that the Second
Amendment guarantees

52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,120
an individual right
to have and use arms

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,080
for self-defense
in the home.”

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,690
But it tells us
almost nothing

55
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,230
aside from “in the
home for self-defense.”

56
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,000
And since then,
the Supreme Court

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
has ducked case
after case after case

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,960
that could refine
and elaborate

59
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
the scope of the
Second Amendment

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,670
to tell us,
for instance,

61
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,670
is there a right to
bear arms in public?

62
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,390
Are concealed carry laws O.K.?

63
00:02:26,390 --> 00:00:00,000
It’s told us almost nothing
about Second Amendment rights.
