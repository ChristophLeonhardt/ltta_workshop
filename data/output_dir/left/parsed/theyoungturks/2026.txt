SO JOE CROWLEY IS A
CONGRESSMAN FROM NEW YORK, VERY
POWERFUL, ARGUABLY ONE OF THE
TOP DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE.
WHY?
HE RAISES A LOT OF MONEY, WE
WILL SHOW YOU IN A SECOND, BUT
SOMEONE IS FINALLY CHALLENGING
HIM, ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ.
SHE'S
DOING PHENOMENALLY WELL, CROWLEY
HAS NEVER HAD A CHALLENGE LIKE
THIS BEFORE, HENCE ME DUBBING
HER ALEXANDRIA THE GREAT.
YESTERDAY WE HAD MIGHTY MARY
WILSON, ANOTHER JUSTICE DEMOCRAT
RUNNING IN TEXAS, CHECK THAT OUT
AS WELL, WE HAVE ALL OF OUR
INTERVIEWS WITH THESE GREAT
CANDIDATES ON TYT POLITICS.
SHE
IS TRYING TO GET TO 10,000
SIGNATURES TO MAKE SURE SHE GETS
ON THE BALLOT AND EVERYTHING IS
KOSHER.
OF COURSE WHAT DOES JOE
CROWLEY DO?
HE CONTROLS A LOT OF
THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE IN THAT
AREA, SO CONVENIENTLY ALL OF A
SUDDEN VOTING AREAS ARE
BEGINNING TO CHANGE.
OH, THAT I
HEAVILY MINORITY DISTRICT THAT
MIGHT FAVOR OCASIO-CORTEZ?
YEAH,
WE AREN'T GOING TO VOTE THERE
ANYMORE.
THE POLLING STATION,
WHAT A BREAK, WE HAVE TO MOVE
IT.
I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE
IN NEW YORK.
PER MEMBER WHEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN VOTER PURGES RIGHT
BEFORE THE PRIMARY.
SO THIS IS
IN SOME WAYS, AND THIS IS
HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY, BUT THIS IS A
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT RACE IN
NEW YORK BECAUSE CROWLEY IS SUCH
A POWER PLAYER IN THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY, BERNIE SANDERS VERSUS
HILLARY CLINTON ALL OVER AGAIN.
SOME OF YOU MIGHT SAY I DON'T
WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE AGAIN,
AND SOME OF YOU MIGHT THINK I
WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT
MOVIE BUT GIVE IT A DIFFERENT
ENDING.
AND HERE IS YOUR
OPPORTUNITY.
SO OCASIO-CORTEZ, VERY
PROGRESSIVE, A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT,
TAKES NO CORPORATE PAC MONEY,
MEDICARE FOR ALL, CROWLEY HAS TO
BE BROUGHT TO SOME OF THOSE
POSITIONS, LIKE MEDICARE FOR
ALL, ONLY AFTER HE GETS A
PRIMARY OPPONENT.
BEFORE HE
WASN'T FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL,
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS INTRODUCED
OCASIO-CORTEZ AS A PRIMARY OPPONENT
AND SUPPORTED THE MEDICARE FOR ALL
BILL IN THE HOUSE AND ALL OF A
SUDDEN CROWLEY SAYS THAT'S WHAT
I MEANT!
INTERESTING.
SO WHY
DOES CROWLEY HAVE THIS POWER IN
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY?
IS IT
BECAUSE HE'S PROGRESSIVE?
NO.
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE MONEY,
LEBOWSKI.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE
MONEY CROWLEY HAS RAISED, THIS
IS HIS TOTAL IN HIS CAREER, IF
YOU ADD SECURITIES AND
INVESTMENT, INSURANCE, AND
COMMERCIAL BANKS, THAT'S AROUND
$4.2 MILLION.
THAT THE FINANCIAL
INDUSTRY.
REAL ESTATE IS ALSO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL IN NEW YORK
AND LEADS TO A LOT OF
CORRUPTION, THAT IS $1.6
MILLION.
TOGETHER THAT'S ABOUT
$5.8 MILLION.
CROWLEY AND OTHER
DEMOCRATS LOOK AT THAT AND GO
BRAVO, WAY TO RAISE A LOT OF
MONEY FROM BANKERS.
EXCELLENT
JOB, CROWLEY.
REAL PEOPLE LOOK
AT THAT AND GO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO ON BEHALF OF THE
PEOPLE WHO GAVE YOU $5.8
MILLION?
YOU THINK BANKERS GAVE
CROWLEY MONEY FOR THEIR HEALTH?
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A
CHARITY?
NO, THEY GAVE THAT
MONEY FOR A RETURN ON
INVESTMENT, AN INVESTMENT THEY
HAVE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND
HENCE DONATIONS TO CROWLEY OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.
BUT HERE COMES
ALEXANDRIA AND SHE DOESN'T TAKE
ANY OF THEIR MONEY, SHE DOESN'T
TAKE ANY OF IT.
SO HOW ARE YOU
GO TO CORRUPT HER?
WELL, YOU
CAN'T. THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.
SO LET ME SHOW YOU JUST THIS
LAST ELECTION CYCLE, BECAUSE THE
FIRST TIME THE BANKERS GAVE YOU
MONEY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN
ACCIDENT, THE SECOND AND THE
THIRD AND THE EIGHTH TIME THEY
GAVE YOU MONEY IT'S NOT AN
ACCIDENT, THAT MEANS THEY GOT
THEIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT, SO
HERE'S THE LATEST CROWLEY CHART
FROM THE LATEST INVESTMENT
CYCLE.
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM, CAN
YOU TELL WHICH INDUSTRY GIVES
JOE THE MOST AMOUNT MONEY?
OH
YEAH, THERE IS AGAIN, FINANCE,
INSURANCE, AND REAL ESTATE AT
$726,000.
SO THE MONEY KEEPS ON
ROLLING IN.
THOSE ARE NOT
NONPROFIT CONTRIBUTIONS, THOSE
ARE INVESTMENTS.
SO JOE THE
BANKER CROWLEY DOING GREAT WITH
THOSE GUYS.
SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?
THE ONLY WAY THE SMALL DONOR
CANDIDATES AND THE NO CORPORATE
PAC CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO WIN
IS IF YOU ACTUALLY GET BACK.
SO
OCASIO2018.COM/LASTCALL TO
VOLUNTEER, SHE HAS 100
VOLUNTEERS RIGHT NOW, SHE NEEDS
200.
BUT MAKE IT HAPPEN, GET OUT
THERE AND GET THOSE PETITIONS
SIGNED, GET HER ON THE BALLOT,
OCASIO2018.COM/FIGHT TO DONATE,
BECAUSE YOUR DOLLARS GO WAY,
WAY FURTHER FOR ALEXANDRIA THAN
THE BANKER DOLLARS DUE FOR
CROWLEY, THE JUSTICE DEMOCRAT
FOLKS ARE MUCH BETTER AT
SPENDING MONEY BECAUSE THEY
LARGELY RELY ON VOLUNTEERS AND
GRASSROOTS.
LOOK, IF SHE HAS
10,000 SIGNATURES, IN THAT
PRIMARY THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO
WIN TO BEGIN WITH.
CROWLEY HAS
NEVER REALLY BEEN CHALLENGED.
A
LOT OF THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO
WIN.
BRENT WELDER IN KANSAS HAS
A BIG LEAD ON A REPUBLICAN
INCUMBENT.
MIGHTY MARY WILSON IS
AN AMAZING SHAPE.

LIBERTY BELL, ADRIAN BELL, IN
