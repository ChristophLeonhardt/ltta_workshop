1
00:00:00,921 --> 00:00:03,256
SECURE OUR SCHOOLS, AND TACKLE

2
00:00:03,256 --> 00:00:07,594
THE DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MENTAL

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:09,563
HEALTH.

4
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:12,199
>> Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,266
TODAY, AND A PRESIDENT TRUMP IN

6
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:14,868
THE LAST SCHOOL SHOOTING, WHERE

7
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,036
HE WAS REFERRING TO WHAT THEY

8
00:00:16,036 --> 00:00:18,605
WERE GOING TO DO MOVING FORWARD.

9
00:00:18,605 --> 00:00:20,207
AGAIN, THIS SCHOOL SHOOTING IN

10
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:22,742
SANTA FE, TEXAS, COMES AS YOU

11
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,578
LOOK AT THE MASS SHOOTING SO FAR

12
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,178
THIS YEAR.

13
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:28,148
THE LIST INCLUDES THREE OR MORE

14
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,182
VICTIMS KILLED, NOT

15
00:00:29,182 --> 00:00:30,450
CONVENTIONALLY MOTIVATED CRIMES

16
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,553
OR KILLINGS IN PRIVATE HOMES.

17
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:35,956
BUT YOU NOW HAVE SANTA FE, TEXAS

18
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,190
AND AT TEN KILLED HERE.

19
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,759
WE HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,427
TODAY THAT THE EDUCATION

21
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:45,932
SECRETARY, BETSY DeVOS, HAS

22
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:46,666
HER SCHOOL SAFETY COMMISSION HAS

23
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:50,570
STOOD UP TODAY AND IT WILL MEET

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,172
FOR THE FIRST TIME NEXT WEEK.

25
00:00:52,172 --> 00:00:54,774
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

26
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:57,344
LET'S START ON THE DAYS EVENTS.

27
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,748
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.

28
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:05,785
MATT SCHLAPP, AND NOEL ROTHMAN,

29
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:10,790
ASSOCIATE EDITOR OF COMMENTARY

30
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,392
MAGAZINE.

31
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:18,765
NO LUCK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

32
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:20,767
AND >> Noah: THEY HAVE BECOME

33
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:23,570
SO COMMON AT THIS POINT, THAT

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,905
CONSERVATIVES RESPOND BY TALKING

35
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,840
ABOUT CONSERVATIVE ISSUES AND

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,141
DEMOCRATS RESPOND BY ADDRESSING

37
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:28,608
GUNS.

38
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:30,610
THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A WEAPONS

39
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,011
ISSUE.

40
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,012
WE SAW SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY SAY

41
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,015
THAT WE NEEDED TO TALK ABOUT

42
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:36,216
WEAPONS BUT THE PERPETRATOR THAT

43
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:39,619
WE KNOW AT A SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN

44
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:51,665
WHICH IS ILLEGAL.

45
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:56,236
WHICH IS ILLEGAL.

46
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:56,903
AT THIS POINT, I THINK IT'S

47
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:57,637
PRETTY SAFE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE

48
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:58,204
A COPYCAT ISSUE HERE.

49
00:01:58,204 --> 00:01:58,838
AND THAT IS A MEDIA ISSUE.

50
00:01:58,838 --> 00:01:59,472
THERE IS ENOUGH SCHOLARLY

51
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,173
LITERATURE THAT SUGGESTS THAT

52
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:00,874
YOUNG STUDENTS ARE SEEKING TO

53
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:01,608
EMULATE THE HORRIBLE LEGACIES OF

54
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:02,242
PEOPLE LIKE THE COLUMBINE

55
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:02,976
SHOOTERS WHICH IS EVIDENT HERE,

56
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:03,543
WEARING A TRENCH COAT.

57
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,277
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT POINT

58
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:04,811
AND THAT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T

59
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:07,280
THINK ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,848
ADDRESS.

61
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,917
>> Bret: YES.

62
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:11,251
DAVID?

63
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,687
>> David: YOU PLAY THE CLIPS,

64
00:02:13,687 --> 00:02:14,788
THREE MONTHS AGO HE SAID THE

65
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,356
SAME THING AS HE SAID TODAY, AND

66
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:18,258
IT'S SAD TO SAY BUT IN THREE OR

67
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:18,925
FOUR MONTHS NOW, WE WILL

68
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,595
PROBABLY BE IN THE SAME

69
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:21,962
SITUATION.

70
00:02:21,962 --> 00:02:23,296
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF TEXAS

71
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:25,332
SUGGESTED TODAY, I HEARD IT, THE

72
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:27,601
PROBLEM WAS THE AMOUNT OF DOORS

73
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,234
AND THE SCHOOL.

74
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,670
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GUNS

75
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,038
BUT ENTRY POINTS AND IF THERE

76
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:33,373
WERE FEWER ENTRY POINTS IN THE

77
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,374
SCHOOL, THE SHOOTER COULD BE

78
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:34,975
STOPPED.

79
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:37,777
SO THERE IS NO AGREEMENT ON THIS

80
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:38,478
ISSUE BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND

81
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:39,379
DEMOCRATS AND I DON'T THINK WE

82
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,982
WILL SEE AN AGREEMENT UNTIL WE

83
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,750
HAVE A CHANGE, AND A PEOPLE OF

84
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,754
IN WASHINGTON.

85
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:48,388
>> Bret: MATT?

86
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:49,556
>> Matt: IT'S TIME TO GET

87
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:52,158
PRACTICAL AND THINK ABOUT THE

88
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:53,460
NUMBER OF STEPS WE COULD TAKE.

89
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,196
I DROP OFF FOUR OF MY KIDS AT

90
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:57,697
SCHOOL EVERY MORNING AND AN

91
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:58,431
OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER BRINGS

92
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,901
THE CAR IN FOR THE DROP OFF AND

93
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:03,003
I THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY

94
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:05,372
SCHOOLS THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO

95
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:06,573
ATTACK YOU.

96
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,441
WE HAVE THESE CONSTITUTIONAL

97
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,275
QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS ABOUT

98
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,176
VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY.

99
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:11,678
I DON'T THINK THESE WILL GET

100
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:12,412
RESOLVED POLITICALLY BUT I KNOW

101
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:15,882
ONE THING WE COULD DO, WE CAN

102
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:16,950
HARDEN THESE SCHOOLS AND GET

103
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,385
REAL WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS

104
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:19,619
VIOLENCE IN OUR SOCIETY AND

105
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,055
THERE IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE

106
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,223
THING IF WE DO NOTHING TO STOP

107
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:23,490
IT.

108
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,026
>> Bret: LET'S MOVE TO ANOTHER

109
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:27,027
TOPIC, WHICH IS THE

110
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:27,594
INVESTIGATION.

111
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,896
THE RUSSIAN PROBE LED BY SPECIAL

112
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:32,165
COUNSEL MUELLER, AND RUDY

113
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:32,999
GIULIANI, THE PRESIDENT'S

114
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,267
ATTORNEY, HAS BEEN OUT TALKING

115
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,702
TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

116
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:38,605
NETWORKS HERE AT FOX, AND

117
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:39,005
OTHERS.

118
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:43,576
HERE HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE

119
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:44,778
PRESIDENT, HOW HE WOULD TESTIFY.

120
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:47,981
>> THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO

121
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,915
LIE, LET'S GET THAT STRAIGHT.

122
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:51,618
>> WHAT GIVES YOU THAT

123
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:52,018
CONFIDENCE?

124
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,120
>> I'VE GONE OVER THE WHOLE

125
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,221
THING, THERE'S NOTHING TO LIE

126
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:55,789
ABOUT.

127
00:03:55,789 --> 00:03:57,590
>> Bret: THE QUESTION IS,

128
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,059
NOAH, ARE THEY SETTING UP

129
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:01,695
POTENTIALLY TO HAVE THE

130
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:03,229
PRESIDENT POTENTIALLY TALK TO

131
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,697
ROBERT MUELLER?

132
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,231
>> Noah: IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT,

133
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:06,833
APPARENTLY THERE IS SOME EFFORT

134
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,068
ON GOING.

135
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:08,868
MR. GIULIANI SPOKE WITH FOX NEWS

136
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:11,237
AND SAID THERE IS SOME

137
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:12,338
PREPARATION, ALMOST DEBATE PREP,

138
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,175
THAT THEY WILL BE RETURNING TO

139
00:04:15,175 --> 00:04:16,543
THE AREA IN NEW JERSEY WHERE

140
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:19,745
THEY DID DEBATE PREP IN 2016 AND

141
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,081
THEY WILL WALK THE PRESIDENT

142
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:21,481
THROUGH.

143
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:22,749
APPARENTLY, THE PRESIDENT WILL

144
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:24,718
BE DEPOSED BY THE COUNCIL, WHICH

145
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,553
IS A FRAUD PROSPECT, BUT I DON'T

146
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:28,321
THINK THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE

147
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:29,155
EVER EVIL HE DID IT.

148
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:33,026
>> Bret: IN THE MEANTIME, WE

149
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,261
ARE WAITING FOR THIS

150
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:35,962
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT, AND

151
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,597
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REPORTS

152
00:04:37,597 --> 00:04:38,531
INCLUDING "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

153
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,367
ABOUT THE FBI USING INFORMANTS

154
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:45,538
AT THE EARLY STAGES OF THE

155
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:45,972
INVESTIGATION.

156
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,240
>> THERE ARE REPORTS OF THAT BUT

157
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,142
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE INFORMANT

158
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:50,844
IS OR THE ACCURACY OF THE

159
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,746
REPORT, OR WHAT THE INFORMANT'S

160
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:55,415
GOAL WAS IF THERE WAS AN ACTUAL

161
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,417
INFORMANT.

162
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,385
LOTS OF QUESTIONS REMAIN AROUND

163
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,220
THAT.

164
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,588
ON THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION

165
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:02,822
THOUGH, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

166
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:03,990
THING THAT CAME OUT OF RUDY

167
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,860
GIULIANI'S MOUTH IS THAT MUELLER

168
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,161
SEEMS TO SAY THAT HE WILL NOT

169
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,596
INDICT THE PRESIDENT.

170
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:11,397
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE HE CAN INDICT

171
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:11,865
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

172
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:14,200
SO I THINK THE NEXT KEY THING TO

173
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,435
WATCH IN THE INVESTIGATION IS,

174
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:16,202
WHO IS IN HIS SITES?

175
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:19,372
IS IT A MEMBER OF THE

176
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,440
PRESIDENT'S FAMILY?

177
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,275
IS IT JARED KUSHNER?

178
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:23,710
COULD IT BE DONALD TRUMP JR.?

179
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,980
OR ARE ALL THE FISH ALREADY

180
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,313
FRIDAY?

181
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:30,450
I THINK THAT IS THE MAIN NEXT

182
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,153
QUESTION TO WATCH IN THIS

183
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:33,586
INVESTIGATION.

184
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:35,355
>> Bret: MATT, AND THE

185
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:36,523
INVESTIGATION INTO THE

186
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,258
INVESTIGATION IS ALSO ONE TO

187
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:38,558
WATCH.

188
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:39,793
>> Matt: EXACTLY.

189
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:40,960
THE PROBLEM FOR ROBERT MUELLER,

190
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,595
IF YOU LOOK AT HIS POLL NUMBERS,

191
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,165
THEY HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN AND

192
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:45,565
COMING DOWN.

193
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:47,033
IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAWYER HE

194
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:50,804
HIRED HAD A POLITICAL AX TO

195
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:51,471
GRIND AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

196
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,174
SO I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME,

197
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:56,609
THERE ISN'T A DOWNSIDE TO THE

198
00:05:56,609 --> 00:05:58,411
PRESIDENT AVOIDING THIS

199
00:05:58,411 --> 00:05:59,612
CONVERSATION WITH THE SPECIAL

200
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,413
COUNSEL'S TEAM.

201
00:06:00,413 --> 00:06:02,649
I THINK THE SECOND THING IS --

202
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,851
YOU'VE SEEN JAMES CLAPPER ON CNN

203
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,653
TALKING ABOUT HOW IT WAS A GOOD

204
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:10,557
THING TO HAVE A SPY IN THE TRUMP

205
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:10,924
CAMPAIGN.

206
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:11,624
IT'S THE MOST OUT -- AS THING

207
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:12,992
I'VE EVER HEARD OF AND I THINK

208
00:06:12,992 --> 00:06:15,595
WE NEED A TOWER COMMISSION.

209
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:16,729
PICK THREE PEOPLE OF EMINENT

210
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,430
REPUTATION WHO UNDERSTAND THE

211
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,599
NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS, TO

212
00:06:19,599 --> 00:00:00,000
USE IN THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
