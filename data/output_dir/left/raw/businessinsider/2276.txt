1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,770
and so what was that failure would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,200
learn oh my god oh I mean where do I

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,349
start you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> management failure you</font>

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,360
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so basically we eat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh are two</font>

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">things one is how to be a boss how to</font>

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,660
lead the<font color="#CCCCCC"> magazine second was what was</font>

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,630
our story if I was betting not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,119
internet you know was had failed but

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,580
that it had succeeded if the Revolution

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,750
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> won the question is what</font>

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,279
revolutionaries do when the revolution

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,330
is one do you come a

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,430
counterrevolutionary do you become an

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,960
establishment figure you know what is

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,570
that story and we sort of assumed the

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,010
story had meant about the subculture the

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,390
rise the subculture we're going to say

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,410
okay look right now everyone's

19
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,090
something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fallen subculture but we're</font>

20
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bet is the ability of the</font>

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,610
subculture that the Internet becomes

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,289
from papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just follow it into</font>

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,809
the mainstream and will declare victory

24
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,219
and you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and then we're</font>

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,899
going to stop writing about tcp/ip and

26
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,399
start writing about about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,430
technologies changes people's lives what

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,379
that means month in month out really I

29
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,300
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> messed up just time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and time</font>

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,789
again could not find you know that the

31
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,170
story that resonated<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all people</font>

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,549
didn't believe the positive story in

33
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:06,750
those days and second of all I wasn't

34
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,040
you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

35
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,570
articulate anything that was compelling

36
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,939
and eventually was science that saved us

37
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first issue that I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

38
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,380
really felt distinct and fresh again was

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,939
a science and religion just the sort of

40
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">they the clash of cultures between those</font>

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,080
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so science has become a core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,670
what we what we do it wired and kind of

43
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,159
taps into my background and plays really

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,750
well of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our readers and and is</font>

45
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,100
essentially you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say</font>

46
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the science is the only real news</font>

47
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,110
and it kind of speaks to kind of core

48
00:01:34,110 --> 00:00:00,000
truths about our world
