THAT, THEN NO ONE WOULD HAVE 3W4R50E6D HIM. STEVE: HE AMPED IT UP. MERCEDES SCHLAPP IS A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SHEET JOINS FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. I'M SURE GOING ARE IN I'M SURE THE WHITE HOUSE HAD ADVICE FOR HIM. WAS ONE OF THE PIECES OF ADVICE YOU BETTER LOOK LIKE YOU ARE FIGHTING? YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE KNOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR A LONG TIME AND HE IS A FIGHTER. HE KNEW SO WELL THAT IT WAS HIS MOMENT. HIS MOMENT TO TELL THE WORLD THAT HE WAS INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE. THAT IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FINE REPUTATION, ONE WHERE HE HAS SERVED OUR NATION HONORABLY FOR OVER 25 YEARS TO BE ABLE TO SHARE HIS STORY. AND THE MERE FACT THAT YOU HAVE HAD THE DEMOCRATS MISTREAT HIM IN A WAY, MISHANDLE THIS PROCESS IS A COMPLETE OUTRAGE. THE MERE FACT THAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN SAT ON THIS LETTER FOR OVER 60 DAYS AND DID NOTHING SEWED NOTHING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE IS THIS LEAK THAT CAME OUT RIGHT BEFORE THIS VOTE THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH CAME WITH THE FACTS HE OPENED HIS HEART AND SPOKE THE TRUTH. FROM THERE IT'S JUST SO TELLING THE FACT THAT THIS MAN DESERVES TO BE ON THE SUPREME COURT. BRIAN: WHAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO BRETT KAVANAUGH AS IF THEY HAD SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS EVERY DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKER, WHY DON'T YOU CALL FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION? WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE WHITE HOUSE. LOOK AT DON MCGAHN DICK DURBIN SAID CALL FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION. WHY WOULDN'T YOU? LET'S REMEMBER THE PEOPLE CALLING FOR THE FBI INVESTIGATION, THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MIND. THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE VOTING NO ON BRETT KAVANAUGH FROM DAY ONE SINCE HE WAS NOMINATED THESE DEMOCRATS CAME OUT IN FULL FORCE. THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO STOP HIM. AND THAT'S WHEN THEY STEARATED TO DRAG HIS NAME IN THE MUD. THAT'S WHEN THESE SACKIZATIONS CAME OUT I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO DID DR. FORD WITH THAT STEAD THERE WAS A LACK OF FACTS. AND HERE CAME JUDGE KAVANAUGH BEING ABLE TO TALK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE ABOUT HIS CHARACTER. THIS HAS BEEN A CHARACTER ASSASSINATION BY THE DEMOCRATS. THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES ON WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF BELITTLING THIS MAN, THIS FINE MAN WHO HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO PUBLIC SERVICE WHO HAS BEEN VERY GOOD FAMILY MAN, A GOOD FRIEND TO SOME OF US. AND HAS PROMOTED WOMEN DURING HIS CAREER. SO, IT'S JUST OUTSTANDING THAT THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GO SO LOW AND THAT WAS THE DISPLAY THAT THEY SHOWED, THE PUBLIC DISPLAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS SHOWED YESTERDAY WAS THE FACT THAT WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A POLITICAL WITCH HUNTINGTON AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. SO, TO SAY FOR THEM TO SAY OH, LET'S GO WITH THE FBI INVESTIGATION, WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT? NO. THEY WANT TO BUY TIME. THEY WANT TO BUY TWO MORE MONTHS, GET THROUGH THIS ELECTION. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED AT ALL ON THE CONCLUSIONS OR THE RESULTS. LET'S REMEMBER THAT THIS COMMITTEE, SENATE COMMITTEE HAS SORELY INVESTIGATED. THEY HAVE DONE WHAT THEY COULD TO DEPOLITICIZE THIS PROCESS AND THE REPUBLICANS AS WELL HAVE DONE WHAT THEY COULD TO REACH OUT TO DR. FORD. EVEN OFFERED TO GO OVER TO CALIFORNIA AND SHE WASN'T EVEN AWARE OF IT. WHY? BECAUSE HER LAWYERS ARE PRO-DEMOCRAT POLITICAL OPERATIVES. OF COURSE, REFERRED TO BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN. AINSLEY: YOU KNOW, DID I LIKE HOW THEY HELD THE DEMOCRATS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THINGS THEY HAD SAID IN THE PAST. LINDSEY GRAHAM LOOKED AT THEM AND SAID YOU HAVE EVEN SAID, SENATOR, THAT YOU WANTED TO DELAY. THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GO THROUGH. YOU WANT TO DELAY, DELAY, DELAY AND THEN YOU WANT TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY LOOKED AT EACH OF THE DEMOCRATS AND SAID THINGS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER. HE SAID YOU CALLED ME EVIL BEFORE. HE SAID YOU ARE GOING TO OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE. HE SAID THOSE WHO SUPPORT ME ARE COMPLICIT IN EVIL. SOME OF YOU SAID THAT SOME OF YOU CALLED ME YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. HE SAID I'M A GUY WHO HAS WORKED SO HARD MY ENTIRE LIFE AND YOU ARE TAINTING MY REPUTATION AND IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. HE IS RIGHT. AINSLEY: WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN HE WAS CALLING PEOPLE OUT FACE TO FACE? YOU KNOW, HE WAS SO TRANSPARENT AND SO HONEST AND SO RIGHT. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ALL NEEDED TO HEAR U WHICH IS THE FACT THAT HE CALLED THE DEMOCRATS OUT. HE CALLED THE LIBERAL MEDIA OUT. WHY? BECAUSE FOR 10 DAYS THERE ARE THESE STORIES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN OUT IN THE MEDIA THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FALSE, THAT THEY JUST RUN WITH ON BRETT KAVANAUGH. GOING AS FAR AS AS BASICALLY SAYING THAT HE IS RUNNING SOME SORT OF GANG RAPE CIRCLE IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS, OUTRAGE JUS. AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE HAD IS SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS WHO KNEW HIM BACK THEN. WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK, ARE WE KIDDING OURSELVES? HOW FAR IS THIS GETTING? AND SO FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH TO BRING IT BACK TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS, WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH IS THIS INSTITUTION OF RESPECT, OF PROFESSIONALISM, OF THE FACT THAT HE SAID THAT HE WILL BE AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE, AND. BRIAN: GOTCHA. HE HAD ALL THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR IT IT'S HIS TIME AND TIME FOR THE SENATE TO VOTE. STEVE: WELL, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IS GOING TO VOTE TODAY. MERCEDES WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS. APPARENTLY FOX IS CONFIRMING THAT THE HOUSE CONSERVATIVES AND THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP HAVE REACHED A DEAL TO BRING IN ROD ROSENSTEIN TO QUESTION HIM ABOUT THAT "NEW YORK TIMES" ARTICLE. NOT CLEAR IF ROSENSTEIN WILL RESPOND TO THE REQUEST BUT FOX IS TOLD THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND/OR OVERSIGHT COULD SUBPOENA HIM. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK OF THAT? WELL, WE WILL SEE. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE TALKING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN, I BELIEVE, NEXT WEEK. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT WILL BE TALKING TO HIM NEXT WEEK? I THINK THAT IS THE PLAN, YES. BRIAN: THEY SPOKE YESTERDAY? I AM NOT AWARE. STEVE: BUT THE PRESIDENT WAS BUSY WATCHING THE HEARING ALL DAY INSTEAD, RIGHT? YES. HE DID COME BACK FROM UNGLA INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL TRIP AND WATCHING THE HEARING. THE PRESIDENT IS VERY PROUD OF BRETT KAVANAUGH AS HE MADE VERY CLEAR THIS WAS A SEARCH AND DESTROY MISSION BY THE DEMOCRATS. AND JUST WATCHING JUDGE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S POWERFUL TESTIMONY SHARING THAT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AINSLEY: WHAT WAS HIS REACTION TO SENATOR GRAHAM? DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. I'M NOT AWARE. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE PRESIDENT. THERE WAS A MOMENT HERE WHERE SENATOR GRAHAM REALLY HIT A HOME RUN AND HE REALLY EXPRESSED ALL THE OUTRAGE THAT SO MANY OF US HAVE FELT FOR SO LONG WATCHING THE DEMOCRATS TREE TO DESTROY KAVANAUGH. VERY PROUD OF WHAT SENATOR
