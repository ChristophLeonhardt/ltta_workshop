1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:01,952
"

2
00:00:01,952 --> 00:00:09,660
THEY WERE AMONG THE VICTORS."

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,161
>> Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:12,997
WELCOME TO "TUCKER CARLSON

5
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,031
TONIGHT" ."

6
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,032
IT IS THIS WEEK, THE YEAR

7
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,901
ANNIVERSARY OF THE BEGINNING OF

8
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:18,669
THE ROBERT MUELLER RUSH

9
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:19,837
INVESTIGATION AT THE END OF THAT

10
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,538
PERIOD WE HAVE DISCOVERED THERE

11
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,774
IS STILL NO EVIDENCE AT ALL OF

12
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:24,875
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE

13
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,877
DONALD TRUMP FOR

14
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:27,845
PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN OF 2016 AND

15
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,246
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT BUT

16
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:29,980
MUELLER'S MANY SUPPORTERS IN

17
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,714
WASHINGTON DON'T SEEM TO CARE

18
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:32,816
ABOUT THAT.

19
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,018
THAT'S BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION

20
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:34,885
WAS NEVER ABOUT RUSSIA,

21
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:35,653
OBVIOUSLY.

22
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:36,553
THE WHOLE ABSURD FEVER DREAM WAS

23
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:37,688
ALWAYS A WAY FOR THE RULING

24
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:40,257
CLASS TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT

25
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:41,659
LOSING POWER IN 2016.

26
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:44,028
IT WAS A WAY FOR THEM TO AVOID

27
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:45,429
THINKING ABOUT WHY TRUMP GOT

28
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,030
ELECTED.

29
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,930
THEY NEVER HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

30
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:47,831
IT.

31
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:49,300
ALONG THE WAY THE INVESTIGATIONS

32
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,101
PROVIDED DEMOCRATS WITH A FULL

33
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,238
YEAR OF GOVERNMENT-FUNDED IPO

34
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,539
RESEARCH AND DESTROYED THE LIVES

35
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,042
OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

36
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,410
SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP.

37
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,445
THERE HAVE BEEN DOWNSIDES FOR

38
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:01,812
DEMOCRATS.

39
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,913
VOTERS ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY THE

40
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:03,614
RUSSIA STORY.

41
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,816
IT IS WEIRD AND FALSE AND

42
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,517
CONFUSING AND IT'S PRECISELY

43
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,119
NOTHING TO DO WITH VOTERS ACTUAL

44
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:09,953
LIVES OF THE ISSUES THEY VOTE

45
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:10,220
ON.

46
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,456
IT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME FOR

47
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:13,057
EVERYONE.

48
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,625
AND YET IT'S ALL DEMOCRATS HAVE.

49
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,028
TRUMP IS EVIL, SO IS RUSSIA.

50
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,631
THAT'S THE ENTIRE PROGRESSIVE

51
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,366
PROGRAM 2018 SUMMARIZED INTO

52
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:22,733
SENTENCES.

53
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,602
IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAD A

54
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:26,637
ATTITUDES.

55
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:27,938
NO WONDER THEIR APPROVAL NUMBERS

56
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,907
ARE FALLING.

57
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,042
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN HAS

58
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:33,043
INTRODUCED OVER THE RESOLUTION

59
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,044
CALLING FOR AN END TO MUELLER'S

60
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,779
INVESTIGATION OR A REPORT WITHIN

61
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:37,247
30 DAYS.

62
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:37,848
HE JOINS ALONG WITH RON

63
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,216
DeSANTIS OF FLORIDA.

64
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,051
HE SAYS HE MAY KNOW THE IDENTITY

65
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,453
OF THE PERSON WHO WAS SPIED ON

66
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:45,489
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE FBI IN

67
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,423
2016.

68
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,791
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME TO YOU BOTH

69
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,125
TONIGHT.

70
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:52,463
CONGRESSMAN, FIRST TO YOU.

71
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,631
THIS RESOLUTION WOULD CALL FOR

72
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,734
AN END TO THE INVESTIGATION OR A

73
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,235
REPORT SUMMARIZING ITS FINDINGS

74
00:01:58,235 --> 00:01:59,069
SO FAR.

75
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,038
AM I MISSTATING THAT?

76
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:01,572
>> BOTH CORRECT.

77
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:02,873
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT'S

78
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,874
BEEN A YEAR.

79
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,744
AS YOU SAY, IT'S BEEN

80
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,044
$20 MILLION AND WE NEED TO SEE A

81
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,713
REPORT ON WHAT EVIDENCE HE HAS

82
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,014
AND ABSENT THAT EVIDENCE IT

83
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,149
SHOULD WIND UP WITHIN 30 DAYS OF

84
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:14,451
THE RESOLUTION PASSING.

85
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,986
>> Tucker: SO WHY WOULDN'T

86
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,488
OTHER MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES IN

87
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:19,723
THE CONGRESS WANT SOME OVERSIGHT

88
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,023
AND?

89
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:22,459
IF YOU ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY

90
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,660
BOUND TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF

91
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,129
THE DOJ, WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY

92
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,430
PERSON CALLING FOR THIS?

93
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,097
>> ARE NOT.

94
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:28,232
MATT GATES IS ALSO CALLING FOR

95
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:28,499
IT.

96
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:31,435
THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER CALLING

97
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,236
PORTS.

98
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,437
CALL YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND

99
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,438
GET THEM ON BOARD.

100
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,572
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE A FREE

101
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,307
REPUBLIC, AS YOU KNOW, IF YOU

102
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:40,110
HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS

103
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,878
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

104
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:42,613
IT IS A WITCH HUNT.

105
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,114
IT HAS GONE BEYOND AN

106
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,215
INVESTIGATION AND THE ONLY

107
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,251
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION WE FOUND,

108
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,018
THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF CRIMINALITY

109
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,820
HAS BEEN ON THE DEMOCRATS.

110
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,388
WE ARE CALLING ON MUELLER TO

111
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:54,458
SHOW HIS HAND OR FOLD THE DECK.

112
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,193
>> Tucker: EVEN IF I BELIEVED

113
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,028
THE PRESIDENT COLLUDED WITH

114
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:59,229
VLADIMIR PUTIN I'D BE VERY

115
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,030
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

116
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,265
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE

117
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,299
PARAMETERS AREN'T CLEAR.

118
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:04,635
THE TIMELINE IS OPAQUE AND IT'S

119
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:08,238
NOT CLEAR WHAT THE POINT IS.

120
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,039
CONGRESSMAN, ONE OF THE ENDURING

121
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,441
MYSTERIES OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS

122
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,209
HAS BEEN THE STORY OF A MOLE OR

123
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,379
SPY WITHIN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

124
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:16,079
FEEDING INFORMATION TO THE

125
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,683
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

126
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:20,350
HAVE YOU ANY SENSE WHO THAT

127
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,886
PERSON MIGHT BE?

128
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,755
>> I DO, TUCKER, BUT I THINK

129
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:25,389
THAT THE ISSUE NEEDS TO GO

130
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:28,025
THROUGH THE TROUBLE SO MY PROPER

131
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:28,459
CHANNELS.

132
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,193
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE DISCLOSING

133
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,828
WHO I THINK IT IS BASED ON THE

134
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,463
EVIDENCE THAT I HAVE, BUT I CAN

135
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,964
SAY THIS, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

136
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,032
DESERVE AN ANSWER.

137
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:38,435
UP OR DOWN, DID THE FBI DIRECT

138
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,471
SOMEBODY TO SPY ON

139
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,839
DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN?

140
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,639
WAS SOMEBODY ACTIVELY WORKING TO

141
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,476
UNDERMINE HIS CAMPAIGN AND

142
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,077
CREATE THE ILLUSION OF

143
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:47,444
COLLUSION?

144
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,445
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, I THINK

145
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:51,882
THAT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN THE

146
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:52,649
FISA ABUSE.

147
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,251
I THINK IT'S MORE SERIOUS THAN

148
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,486
ROSENSTEIN BUTCHERING THIS WHOLE

149
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,587
APPOINTING ORDER WITH MUELLER

150
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:57,454
FROM THE BEGINNING.

151
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:58,822
WE NEED THE ANSWER TO THOSE

152
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,189
QUESTIONS.

153
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,157
THEY ARE NOT GIVING US THE

154
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,026
ANSWERS RIGHT NOW.

155
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,027
>> Tucker: THEY ARE DEFINITELY

156
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:04,428
NOT.

157
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:05,796
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK

158
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,499
LIBEL BY NAMING SOMEONE BECAUSE

159
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,867
THIS IS NOT BEEN PROVED IN

160
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,668
COURT, BUT GIVE US A SENSE OF

161
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,669
WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

162
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,337
ARE YOU SAYING SOMEONE WHO

163
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:17,741
WORKED ON THE DRUM CAMPAIGN FED

164
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,509
INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT?

165
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,411
>> SO IF YOU LOOK AT GLEN

166
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:23,447
SIMPSON'S TESTIMONY FROM

167
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:24,548
FUSION GPS, HE TALKED ABOUT

168
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:27,017
THERE BEING A HUMAN SOURCE AND

169
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,652
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

170
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,086
CONTROVERSIAL.

171
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,420
SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS

172
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,854
PAPADOPOULOS.

173
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:34,424
IT'S NOT PAPADOPOULOS.

174
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,659
THE ISSUE IS HE ACKNOWLEDGES

175
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,661
THERE'S A HUMAN SOURCE.

176
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:40,864
PETER STRZOK, HE OPENS UP THE

177
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,665
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

178
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,432
INVESTIGATION IN 2016, WHAT DOES

179
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,101
HE DO THE NEXT DAY?

180
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:44,835
HE GOES TO GREAT BRITAIN AND HE

181
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:46,069
GOES TO LONDON AND HE'S MEETING

182
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:46,470
WITH PEOPLE.

183
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,738
HOW THE HECK WOULD YOU DO THAT

184
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,239
IF YOU JUST OPEN THE

185
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:49,873
INVESTIGATION THAT DAY?

186
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,044
I THINK IN THAT KIND OF, THE

187
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,445
LONDON, CHRISTOPHER STEELE,

188
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:56,246
GLENN SIMPSON ACCESS IS PROBABLY

189
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:57,881
THE INDIVIDUAL WE ARE LOOKING

190
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,449
AT.

191
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,851
WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER THIS

192
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,585
INDIVIDUAL WAS SPYING OR NOT.

193
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,253
I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT IT

194
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:08,292
BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THOSE

195
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:18,535
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHEN THE

196
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,269
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PONIES UP THE

197
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:19,636
DOCUMENTS.

198
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:20,337
>> Tucker: ARE YOU SUGGESTING

199
00:05:20,337 --> 00:05:21,038
OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

200
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:21,738
SOMEONE WHO WAS PRESSURED INTO

201
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,272
COOPERATING WITH THE

202
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:22,973
INVESTIGATION, OR SOMEONE WHO

203
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:23,640
FREELY SEND INFORMATION OVER

204
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,174
ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN?

205
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:24,841
>> I THINK IT'S THE LATTER,

206
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:25,175
TUCKER.

207
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:25,909
I THINK THIS COULD BE SOMEONE,

208
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,110
POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE BEEN PAID

209
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,879
BY THE FBI, LIKE STEELE.

210
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,847
THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT TO PAY

211
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:31,848
STEELE.

212
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,649
DID THEY PAY ANYBODY?

213
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,417
YES OR NO.

214
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,352
DID THEY DIRECT ANYBODY TO GO TO

215
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,086
THE CAMPAIGN?

216
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:36,753
YES OR NO.

217
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,390
VERY EASY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.

218
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,960
>> Tucker: I'M SORRY,

219
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,027
CONGRESSMAN.

220
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,462
PLEASE GO AHEAD.

221
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:46,430
>> RON IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

222
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,665
WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW THE

223
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,633
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUELLER AND

224
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,233
COMEY.

225
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:50,968
COMEY KICKED THIS WHOLE THING

226
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:54,037
OFF WITH A BOGUS FISA WARRANT

227
00:05:54,037 --> 00:05:55,272
AND WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP

228
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,240
BETWEEN MUELLER AND COMEY?

229
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,575
DID MUELLER GIVE COMEY IMMUNITY?

230
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,077
DOES COMEY THINK HE'S ABOUT THE

231
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:00,477
LAW?

232
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,712
WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH ALL OF

233
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:02,012
THIS?

234
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,081
THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE

235
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:04,514
INVESTIGATED.

236
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,882
>> Tucker: DO BELIEVE,

237
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,250
QUICKLY, CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU

238
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,852
BELIEVE THAT JIM COMEY HAS BEEN

239
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:11,421
OFFERED IMMUNITY BY THE MUELLER

240
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:11,888
INVESTIGATION?

241
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,457
>> I THINK IT STANDS TO REASON

242
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,324
AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

243
00:06:14,324 --> 00:00:00,000
DESERVE TO KNOW.
