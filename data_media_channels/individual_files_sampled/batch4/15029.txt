remember those bogus astronomically inflated security fees that colleges charge student groups to host conservative speakers well they backfired on one school which now has to pay more than seven times the fee that they were trying to charge the students let's take a look that was part of the action from a rally with the patriot prayer group hosted by the university of washington's college republicans chapter but while many people probably saw the short bouts of political violence on youtube relatively few individuals looked into the cash money side of the equation which is barbaric in another sense the University of Washington's College Republicans chapter sued the school after UW tried to charge the group seventeen thousand dollars in security fees for the rally and now the school has to pay a hundred and twenty two thousand five hundred dollars to two law firms that defended the students as well as strike down the policy it used to charge security fees the conservative students argument was pretty straightforward the security fees violated their free speech rights they had backup from UW's own law school 23 professors they are asked the university to settle the case well this is one occasion you'll hear me agree with professors security fees are discriminatory because they're based on how likely a speaker is to attract violence and as we all know one side of the political aisle is a little bit more inclined to use violence this is largely why when louis farrakhan who called hitler a very great man came to UC berkeley the school charges security fee of $1,900 but when ben shapiro visited the school charged the berkeley college republicans over fifteen thousand dollars and it was no different with UW patriot prayer leader Joey Gibson has been assaulted at rallies in the past and has received death threats in fact the school mentioned when justifying its $17,000 security feed fortunately a US district court judge stepped in with a restraining order letting the college republicans carry on with their event now I do take exception to one part of the settlement this weird caveat which allows the UW to create constitutionally permissible security fees we'll have to find out what those look like but one thing's for sure students shouldn't have to shoulder the cost for other people's inability to counter speech with more speech instead of fists pepper spray and bike locks but who should foot the bill let me know in the comments below for campus unmasked I'm Rob shim shock if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus and mass comm
