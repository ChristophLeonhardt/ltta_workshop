at his annual State of the Union address this past week Viktor Orban hid all his favorite themes issues he says in danger hungry the threat posed by migrants you got a little burned or low diversity the dominance of the European Union esta vez a brutally barely n'y a pas de political show kostikova inca the spread of islam a connecting to the whole class or so this lamp tionary sheriff and his disdain for george soros christian feluccas denis george soros you sell sheldon beautiful there we Mexicans the mega attitude there are very clear messages from the Fidesz from the dominant party and the state may be and pro-government media just repeat the dis messages and Sasha retired maintained holiday looks as migrant artists of the fella raindrop ahead really no dijo Terran propaganda is younger than ever before so it sort of the kind of communication board public media has been totally conquered by the government since 2010 now they have four channels to communicate the rhetoric of the government its full-time full-time propaganda isn't unique to state media the Fidesz parties control extends across the media landscape encompassing both public and private operations according to the investigative journalism outlet at lat search since allies of the prime minister have been buying up numerous Hungarian media outlets men like former Hollywood producer Andy Viner and old school friend Lawrence Mesirow are among a group of 14 Orban allies whose collectively bore 11 radio stations 22 television channels and close to 500 online and print organizations state media however remains a powerful megaphone the umbrella organization created by the Hungarian government in 2011 is called the MTV a and it oversees all public outlet across TV radio and web mtv a cost Hungarians more than 250 million euros a year and is referred to by its critics as quote a taxpayer-funded propaganda network we spoke to two MTV a employees who described a lack of editorial independence and a climate of fear the latter explains why they were wary of speaking out and did so on condition that we disguised their faces and their voices every single thing connected to domestic politics is restricted I mean you can't write anything bad about the government for example if something is politically sensitive I I get instructions in in some cases I have the whole ready-made article so I don't need to do anything no editing that just control-c copy and paste the whole article really it's unimaginable to be honest the editor-in-chief is genuinely like a dictator he comes into the office saying hey what's up guys but then when you get an email from him your stomach tightens in the beginning we used to get emails like please do it like this or please don't do it like that now he just shots from one corner of the office we can't put this in the news it's against Victor Alba being pro all ban requires the Hungarian media to turn against those critical of his government and its agenda that means opposition figures critical voices at the European Union refugees and one well-known Hungarian emigrant George Soros the us-based billionaire businessman and philanthropist has through his Open Society Foundations funded investigations into the Orban government and campaigned in favor of multiculturalism and more open borders ideals squarely at odds with the prime ministers for all bands Fidesz party Soros has become a handy scapegoat and when you hear Hungarian media Soros represents all that threatens the country according to our insiders at MTV a editorial directives from the government on the Soros story can be crystal clear so one of my bosses sent me a Word document by mistake which was produced by this content making Department of the Prime Minister's Office and this document here makes the case that sure OSHA and his organizations are rallying support for a massive anti-government protest okay so here this bit says this statement shows does not trust the rule of law he then goes on to say or this document that he wants to use illegal methods to overthrow the government and this whole evil plan is happening before our eyes they are already offering training sessions conferences pronouncements and and their brainwashing people whatever the story is about if it mentions sharks we focus on it anything that has any connection to shore gets the Shiraz beginning Shiraz organisation Shiraz University and of course the word migrant and then left liberal left liberal newspaper left liberal journalists only three words shut off migrant and left liberal that's the government's whole campaign we try putting these claims of government interference directly to the government spokesperson Zoltan Kovac he turned our interview request down by text message he said he did not believe that the government should in any way comment on media issues even going as far as to say that the government has nothing to do with media and he said we could quote him on that we made our way to Parliament where every week Kovach hosts a press conference that's broadcast live on state TV our producer managed to get in and tried asking yes please can I just that's one quite no you know you're going there's an there's an order in the room and the order is that you give back the microphone to the person okay mister no no it's not here mr. Nowlan it's not your Terrance yeah no no it's not your turn would you like would you like me to guards to escort you out of the room hungries combination of tightly controlled state media and private outlets owned by government friendly tycoons means that most of the country's media are on the same page when it comes to some of the most important issues evidence of that can be found in the eerily similar pro-government talking points that keep appearing almost word-for-word in multiple news outlets as we now know it's often a cut and paste job under a government that says it has nothing to do with the media I think every pro-government media outlet has a guy who sends out these kind of directives from a centralized content providing Department they never dictate the exact article they just include bullet points stating the government's opinion you know their official line but put lots of articles with the different by lines together look at the titles highlight key words and you realize the message is the same we figured out that the content creation is centralized we created this model where you can see that an information pops up somewhere and in an hour all these medias it has been influenced by the government refer to it dispel around in the case of continuous papers the content is packaged in the very same way so if you see the stories and the articles of the country in newspapers which are edited centrally there are the very same stories very same pages in the newspaper even victory burns worst enemies will concede this about his media strategy it's working he has a healthy lead in the polls and come the election in April is likely to secure a third term his remaining critics on the airwaves of fuse RTL club a German own channel broadcasting in Hungarian has been beyond his reach because it's based outside the country with even that may change he's taken all the same eh magnetism forums at the super on it - no Teresa did also warm you to do media renter touch again acronyms Atticus Bank lndia the majority of Hungary's news media is already owned by Hungarians Viktor Orban wants it all and when he says the media system must be in national hands what he means it's hands he can control
