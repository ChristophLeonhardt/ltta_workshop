welcome back our by joining us from Washington would look at Axios am political reporter for Axios Alexei McCammon Alexei good morning to you talk to us about axis is one big thing today today's one big thing is about black women running for office there are at least 43 black Democratic women running as challengers for the US House of Representatives but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee which is the National Party's campaign arm is only supporting one woman in her candidacy and that's Lauren Underwood in Illinois and I've interviewed various of these black women running for office who have basically told me they feel like the party is not investing in them in the same way that they have invested in the party over the years so to that effect that how much of a role will the conversation about the party support of the black community both as voters on one side and candidates on the other play into the upcoming midterms you know this conversation is not going away anytime soon that only has 2018 been billed as the year of the woman right we've seen record number of women running for office but black women in particular have been a crucial voting bloc for the Democratic Party in 2016 ninety-four percent of them voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the Alabama Senate special election ninety-eight percent of black women carried Doug Jones to the finish line and so not only are they turning out as voters in overwhelming numbers but now they're running as candidates and this is something you hear the party talking about more and more calling them the backbone of the party but they're not investing in them in ways that these candidates feel is helpful well and it's insane to me that they're being ignored Aleksey by Democrats right now considering that in 2016 I believe 95 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton right exactly and that's something that I've heard from them when talking to them or many of these women who are running actually worked on duck Jones campaign so they're inspired by things that they see the party achieving but they are you know concerned in the ways that the party is not reaching out to them and one big thing that I hear from them is like we don't even know where to start with fundraising all we're asking for is best practices or to help you know share guidance on things like that we don't need handouts we just want resources that other candidates have been given in the past there are a lot of big races to watch out for come at the end of this year obviously stacey abrams now for a governor of Georgia on the Democratic side but in terms of the midterm elections what are some of the key races that you're watching where women are candidates you know they're also a record number of women running for Senate this year something like forty two women are running for Senate there are only 23 women senators currently in Nevada we could see Democrat Jackie Rosen take Dean Heller seat in Tennessee where Trump was last night Marsha Blackburn a woman is running for office there there are a number of women running for Senate in Maryland and Massachusetts and next Tuesday the California primaries there are something like you know 20 or more women running for the US House of Representatives so those are some big races to watch for women moving forward I know that Axios is also looking at the focus for ads by both Republican and Democratic candidates running for the House what seems to be the main focus for both the parties in these ads you know there's a really fascinating divided between the themes were seeing in these ads so Republicans and conservatives are running ads that are focusing on really hardline views on immigration which clearly speaks to their base and there's an issue that they are hoping will turn out voters to the polls when they're seeing how enthused Democratic voters have been Democrats meanwhile are focusing on health care specifically on this idea of expanding Medicare and that speaks to all these polls that we've seen and that Democrats have been given that show health care is a top issue across the country for voters especially after Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act we know one thing that has emerged over the past year has been the me2 movement we've heard a lot of politicians talk about their themselves being victims of sexual harassment is that likely to be a question that candidates face come the midterms are we likely to see that being one of the more important issues their positions on not just me too but sexual harassment the workplace and a lot of a lot of important social issues along those lines yes so we are also reporting at Axios for the first time that we've seen in an election cycle candidates are being asked explicitly about whether or not they have had instances of sexual harassment or assault either from them or against them and I think we are going to see this come up along the campaign trail in various ways because again not only is it the year of the woman but it the year of b2 in which women had this renewed sense of political power and autonomy and voice over these situations and we no longer want to have men or women for that matter in office who have history of sexual assault or harassment so I think we can definitely expect that to come up all right very good point there it is certainly being a very important issue to watch throughout the course of the past year Alexa McCammon live in Washington DC for us thank you of course we're gonna
