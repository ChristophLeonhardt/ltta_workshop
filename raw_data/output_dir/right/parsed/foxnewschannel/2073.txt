>>> I TURN ON LIKE, YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE NETWORKS AND I SEE,
DONALD TRUMP WHO IS NOT VERY
POPULAR.
I SAY, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?
YOU SAW THE POLL COME OUT THAT
I'M ABOVE OBAMA.
BUT THEN YOU TURN TO FAKE NEWS
AND THEY GO, DONALD TRUMP WHO IS
NOT VERY POPULAR.
I'M SAYING TO MYSELF, HOW DO
THEY GET AWAY WITH IT.
>> RASMUSSEN ONE OF THE MOST
ACCURATE POLLS FOR THE ELECTION
AND YOU'RE IN THAT CATEGORY AND
YOU GET PUBLICITY.
>> INDICTMENT OF THE MEDIA HAS
BEEN CENTRAL TO BOTH PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S CANDIDACY AND
PRESIDENCY.
LET'S BRING IN DIAMOND AND SILK,
SOCIAL MEDIA STARS AND TRUMP
SUPPORTERS.
GOOD MORNING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ALSO RELEASED
WHAT THEY'RE CALLING AN
ACCOUNTABILITY SURVEY ASKING
PEOPLE THESE QUESTIONS.
WE'LL PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN.
THEY SAY, DO YOU TRUST THE
SO-CALLED MAIN STREEN MEDIA.
WHICH ISSUES DO THEY DO THE
WORST JOB OF REPORTING ON
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
DO YOU FEEL THEY'RE TOO EAGER TO
SLUR CONSERVATIVES.
I WOULD PRESUME YOU AGREE WITH A
LOT OF THOSE.
BUT THIS SURVEY AND ARGUMENT, IS
IT RESONATING WITH THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE?
>> I THINK IT IS.
>> YEAH.
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF
THE FAKE NEWS, THE LEFT WING
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, R AND
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, A AND
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, ANDND
MEDIA SPREAD LIES, AND WANTING
YOU TO GO ON WITH THE NARRATIVE.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE
PRESS BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO BE A
CONTROL PRESS WHERE THEY CONTROL
THE MASSES OF PEOPLE WITH THEIR
FAKE NEWS NARRATIVE AND IT'S GOT
TO STOP.
I'M SO HAPPY THAT THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN IS BRINGING AWARENESS
TO THIS ISSUE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> MAYBE CONGRESS SHOULD CALL
THEM UP TO THE HILL TO SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE MEDIA
AND WHY DO THEY KEEP SMEARING
PEOPLE LIKE THEY DO.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
NO.
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED
TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY THE
CAMPAIGN.
>> THERE IS A NEW REPORT OUT
TALKING ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION,
SAYING IT HAS BEEN EXPOSED THAT
IT REGULARLY SPENDS 85% OF THEIR
REVENUE ON ANNUAL PARTY, NOT ON
SCHOLARSHIPS, WHAT IT'S MAINLY
BEEN KNOWN FOR.
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THIS?
>> THAT'S VERY SURPRISING.
THEY ALWAYS POINT THE FINGER ON
THE OTHER SIDE.
BUT LOOK AT THEM.
IT SCOLD
IT CCOLD
IT COULD BE A SLUSH FUND.
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE 85% ON A
MEAL AND TO BASH SOMEBODY AND
ONLY 15% ON WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE USED FOR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> AND IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
SHOULD CALL THEM OUT OR GET RID
OF IT ALL TOGETHER.
>> SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEEN
EXPOSED, ED, AT THIS POINT.
>> I USED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE
CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION.
I RAN THE DINNER ONE YEAR.
SO I TAKE ISSUE WITH YOU SAYING
IT'S SLUSH FUND.
SIT NOT A SLUSH FUND.
I WAS THERE, I SAW
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IT.
BUT I AGREE THAT A LOT MORE
MONEY SHOULD GO TO SCHOLARSHIPS.
I'M ON RECORD SAYING THAT.
I WAS PRESIDENT AROUND 2012,
2013.
AND I THINK TOO MUCH IS SPENT ON
THAT DINNER TO YOUR POINT AND
NOT ENOUGH ON THE MONEY THAT WE
SAY WE'RE GIVING TO THE NEXT
GENERATION OF JOURNALISTS.
IT'S NOT A SLUSH FUND.
PEOPLE ARE NOT MISUSING THE
MONEY.
BUT I WAY AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT
SHOULD BE ABOUT THE NEXT
GENERATION.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'S MY PERSONAL OPINION.
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME.
>> YEAH.
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN
ORGANIZATION THAT'S SUPPOSED TO
HELP PEOPLE WITH SCHOLARSHIPS,
THEN USE THE MONEY FOR THAT.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE 85% OF
IT AND USE IT FOR SOMEONE TO EAT
AND BASH SOMEONE?
THAT'S APPALLING TO ME.
>> WELL YOUR POINT IS THAT IT
FEELS LIKE THE SWAMP.
WE TELL YOU WE'RE ALL ABOUT THE
SCHOLARSHIPS, ALL ABOUT THE
KIDS.
ALWAYS ABOUT THE KIDS.
BUT 85% OF IT IS ASHT OUR
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOT OUR
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUTOUR
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUT OR
BUT 85% OF IT IS ABOUT OUR
TUXES, SPEECHES AND THE FANCY
DRINKS THAT'S THE SWAMP FOR YOU.
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTING
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTINE
>> I'M NOT DIETING ED. INDICTIN.
ROSIE O'DONNELL, TURNS OUT SHE
LOVES DEMOCRATS SO MUCH THAT SHE
GAVE TOO MUCH, WENT OVER THE
DONATION LIMIT TO MULTIPLE
DEMOCRATS.
OVER THE LEGAL LIMIT.
DOESN'T SURPRISE YOU THAT
ROSIE'S GIVING WOULD BE SO
OVERLY GENEROUS.
>> WHAT SURPRISED ME IS NOBODY
HAS CALLED HER OUT, LIKE THE
DEMOCRATS.
WHERE IS SHEILA JACKSON?
WHERE IS HAKEEM JEFFRIES.
WHERE IS THE FCC TO CALL HER OUT
ABOUT OVERLY GIVING OF THE
MONEY.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> I FIND THE HYPOCRISY SO REAL
AND SO UNBALANCED HERE.
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ALWAYS HOLD A
REPUBLICAN ACCOUNTABLE, YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD DEMOCRATS
ACCOUNTABLE TOO.
>> SHE USED FIVE DIFFERENT NEW
YORK ADDRESSES, FOUR DIFFERENT
VARIATIONS OF HER NAME.
TO HER POINT, HOW DID THIS GO
MISSING FOR SO LONG.
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU SUPPORT,
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT.
DIAMOND AND SILK, ALWAYS GOOD TO
HAVE YOU.
>> WHEN THEY CALL HER ON THE
HILL, MAKE SURE SHE'S UNDER
OATH.
>> HAVE HER UNDER OATH TO
EXPLAIN WHY SHE'S USING THESE
