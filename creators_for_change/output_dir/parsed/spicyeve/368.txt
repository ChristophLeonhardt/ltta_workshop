hey guys I'm here at naturally curly
offices yep
and I'm tired of transitioning I don't
know don't get me wrong though I love my
kinky to us semi
I know but you go and get tired
sometimes
just call me a tired transition
for some reason the second I get braids
my scalp is on fire
I tried oils I tried sprays wash my hair
frequently nothing seems to work
and I don't even have to tell y'all
twice about edges yeah breeding can
really put a strain on those delicate
baby airs can someone tell me how to
wash braids with what products what
technique when I Marie
and I can't use all the products I
normally would know heavy creams no deep
conditions nothing
and for some reason as soon as those
twists get done I miss my own hair I
know I know in due time the bigshot if
the countdown begins eight weeks to my
big chop don't get it twisted I've paid
80 bucks for these almost 12 months
transitioning so I think I can last at
least eight more weeks but until next
time bye guys
