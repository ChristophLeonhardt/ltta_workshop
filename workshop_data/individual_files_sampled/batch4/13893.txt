Congress today what can we let's just cut live to Mark Zuckerberg testimony all right yes they come Frankie these babies will be in the stores well he's still grappling with the pickle matrix guys and blade interesting interests that's not yeah not exactly what I expected from the testimony but we'll hear a lot more this is gonna be going on for a while sucks testimony began at 2:15 p.m. eastern time the subject is how Facebook protects user data in the wake of the Cambridge analytic a scandal the Cambridge analytical scandal oh my god no one really knows a lot about this thing let me fill you in in 2014 2015 270,000 Facebook users agreed to give an app some of their information on Facebook as well as data from people on their friends list about 270,000 people so that what they're saying is that this testimony is about that this awful data breach of 270,000 people many of whom agreed to give the data anyway and if you're on Facebook you're already agreeing to give your data over and give me a break you shouldn't put anything on the internet that you wouldn't want to read on the New York Times so that's what they say it's about it's really just about how awful it was that Facebook let Republicans win an election that's all this is he's being dragged in front of Congress and it's all about a maiya culpa to get the cat of nine tails and flagellate himself Miserere Mei Mei occult mayim Maxima culpa he said in his prepared testimony we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibilities and that was a big mistake it was my mistake and I'm sorry I started Facebook I run it I'm responsible for what happens here the responsibility that he has the responsibility that Congress expects him to have is to help elect Democrats that's his responsibility and he apparently failed in that responsibility and they're very upset if Cambridge analytic oh this this awful terrible too awful group and scandal if this were associated with George Soros instead of Robert Mercer you would never hear about this if this were associated with a left-wing donor and financier you would never hear about this and by the way here's my proof of that Barack Obama did the exact same thing he did the exact same thing that Republicans are accused of doing here except way way worse and on a much larger scale and guess what when that happened to nobody reported on this that happened in 2012 the Obama campaign encouraged supporters to download the Obama 2012 Facebook app that let the campaign then collect Facebook data both from the users of the app and from their friends friends maybe who weren't on the app friends maybe you didn't support Barack Obama it let them do that the MIT Technology Review wrote about this in 2012 that six years ago the average friend list size at that time was about 191 million people downloaded the Obama app so that means that upwards of 190 million people had some of their Facebook data scooped up by the Obama campaign without their consent it was just scooped up in this awful way we're talking about 270,000 people with Cambridge analytic we're talking about upwards of 190 million people with regard to the Obama campaign where were the where was the congressional testimony in 2012 where was the wailing and the gnashing of teeth in 2013 in 2014 that didn't happen because it was Obama well maybe they didn't know right maybe people didn't know oh no they did know because the Obama campaign admitted to it Teddy golf the Obama campaign digital director said quote people don't trust campaigns they don't even trust media organizations who do they trust their friends their friends that's why they had to go for their friends Time magazine credited this strategy with helping Barack Obama win that election the Obama campaign called it a game-changer and quote the most groundbreaking piece of technology developed for the campaign by the way just to make this relationship even starker the Trump campaign didn't solicit the data themselves the Trump campaign used the you know there's the various quizzes and things like that Obama literally solicited this data yet his fingerprints far more on this than the Trump campaign ever did also Trump's campaign didn't use the data in the general election campaign Barack Obama did use a live data it used it right up until Election Day there are two main differences between how Democrats used Facebook data and how Republicans used Facebook data what the Democrats did was much much more egregious when the Democrats did you remember they were hailed for winning the race for voter data and they connected with young voters it was the digital campaign he's the digital candidate hooray hooray hooray but not one Republicans do it nah when Republicans do it the other a key is that that's the Cambridge analytical thing the other accusation the Facebook has to fend off and Zuckerberg has to fend off in this testimony is that Russia used Facebook to hack the election were to rig the election or resist you know resist and this is not a legitimate president and he stole the election and Vladimir Putin blah blah blah so just just to jog your memory I know people have short short memories these days here is what Democrats thought about hacking and rigging before the election there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even you could even rig America's elections in part because they're so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time and so I divided mr. Trump to stop whinin and go try to make his case to get votes and if he got the most votes then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from an effective government okay you saw that this is Democrats after President Trump got elected see you can spot the difference Donald J Trump is now President of the United States anywhere the 45th President of the United States that is a subtle difference so I don't know if you could tell before no serious person would ever come on stop one and they're done and then know that that's the difference that happened I have to agree with Obama I have to defend Mark Zuckerberg and agree with Barack Obama no serious person would ever suggest that this election had been rigged or hacked by the Russians or whomever else it just didn't happen there's no evidence that it happened now this brings us to Russia Russian agents did you know interfere they did participate in the election they've been doing this for a hundred years they bought some advertising to stir up trouble in the American elections the way people hear that from the mainstream media is that they poured money into Facebook too just to help Donald Trump and was all in the Trump campaign and it's this massive amount of money and it's swung the election but that didn't happen the internet research agency was a little Russian shop that wanted to cause some trouble in American politics so they bought some ads on Facebook by the way these were not ads for Donald Trump they've bought issue ads they bought issue ads that were specifically on divisive issues so race or gay rights or gun control things that Americans are really divided on that's what they bought ads for there wasn't actually a lot of interference compared to the usual propaganda to put this into perspective Trump and Clinton spent a combined 281 million dollars on Facebook ads during the election 81 million dollars the internet research agency spent $100,000 that is point zero five percent of the amount of money spent on just Facebook ads by the candidates during the election negligible nothing nobody suggests it had any effect at all especially because at what were they weren't even ads for Donald Trump they were just issue ads to divide Americans because that's actually what our geopolitical adversaries want to do they just want to divide Americans and cause some trouble they don't I don't think they particularly like Donald Trump who's expelling their diplomats slapping them with sanctions countering them in Syria I don't think they really liked that guy that much I don't think they really hope that that guy remains president they just want to cause trouble with their geopolitical adversaries they've been doing this for a long time Russians are trolls you know I mean they are like a land of trolls so the Facebook data strategy has been around for a lot of years the you know grabbing data from people Barack Obama mastered it basically in 2012 the Russia issue has been around since oh I don't know 1917 they've been messing with us for a very long time but this time this is what's different this time a Republican one so Democrats have to turn on their own and he is one of their own Mark Zuckerberg is one of their own he is a lefty make no mistake about this if you ever go into the Facebook offices it is like left-wing Candyland and you know Facebook is always touting all of these lefty things lots of rainbows and you know it pro-immigration and pro-chinese neither Democrat nor Republican his ideological views are very clear I should I should preface this the Facebook PAC the political action committee actually donated a little bit more to Republicans than to Democrats in 2012 Mark Zuckerberg donates to both parties because he's a businessman he's the fifth richest person in the world so he's maxed out for instance to Sean Eldridge his friend were in hatch Marco Rubio Paul Ryan Chuck Schumer Cory Booker you know both sides of the aisle although a particular type of Republicans certainly not a hardline conservative Republican and he has to do that that's just what businessmen do Mark Zuckerberg also runs forward us a 501 C 4 that lobbies for amnesty for 11 million illegal aliens and Zuckerberg is trying to push blame on this whole thing he's trying to blame Alexander Kogan who is the Cambridge researcher that created the personality app that scooped up users information so the way this worked I think people still don't understand this awful nefarious plot of Cambridge analytic to grab all of the users information involves some stupid little Facebook quiz you've seen them all the time and then you click it and it says you know do you drink three cups of coffee or four and you click that and it's like you're ep7 J and whatever you know it's just like those little things but you've when you click to that you've consented to give all of your information away so this isn't exactly a nefarious thing it's just a stupid little Facebook poll Republicans have always been better at the internet that's I think what's underlying all of this this is the first time that we've won the presidency since social media has been around so it's getting a lot of play Republicans have always always been better at the Internet a little exception Obama was better at collecting Facebook data in 2012 we didn't get around to doing that that until this cycle but we have always been better at the Internet I'll give you an example from my own life I may have alluded to this a few times in 2010 I was an intern on a congressional campaign in New York with my very good friend nan Hayworth who was a challenger candidate she was running against John Hall who was the incumbent and he was a member of this rock band in the 70s called Orleans they're the guys who did like still the one that dude do you know and they did dance with me I want to be your partner okay you know there's some 70s rock band so anyway I decided to just be a troll at when I was 18 and to start the young voters for an Orleans reunion tour and so you know I kind of ripped off his song a little bit or we wrote it and all the lyrics were about getting John Hall to get fired from Congress cuz he was a terrible congressman this just this little thing cost very little to produce had a viral impact on the internet because it provoked the Democrats they reacted poorly to it and it got us a lot of free publicity we ended up winning that race but it got us a lot of free press in 2012 I again did a commercial with the rent is too damn high guy who's called the debt is too damn high it's probably on YouTube somewhere and same thing it cost barely anything to produce very low bar to enter you put it on the internet you air it on TV in the middle of nowhere and it gets this huge viral push those are just examples from my own life other Republicans have done way more than my modest efforts the reason that Republicans are so good at the Internet is because we could never get a fair shake in the mainstream media we could never get a fair shake in the mainstream press both the producers and the consumers the political operatives and the cultural operatives could never get a fair shake but also conservative viewers who just want like a normal thing on their TV and Jimmy Kimmel crying tears of rage because we're not going to raise taxes or something you know we just we can't even consumers can't get that so there was a lot of talent out there but there were no outlets so conservatives just exploded when the internet really took off and became the vehicle for all of our information and our entertainment and our politics I think an analogy of this is sort of like black actors in Hollywood black actors in Hollywood just about every black actor you see in a movie is a phenomenal actor whereas some white actors you see in movies aren't that great or they're fine or whatever this is just a numbers game this is because there are a lot of good black actors but there are very few black roles so when the black role comes around you've got these incredible performers who can take it whereas there are a gazillion white roles and so just the average talent is going to be lower that's just numbers it's the same thing with conservatives on the internet very few outlets for conservatives before the internet and especially before social media now we have a chance so conservatives absolutely killed it there are social scientific data to back up my anecdotes and my own experiences in this field in 2010 Fast Company as eight years ago ran a big headline Republicans dominate Democrats in social media this isn't the Age of Obama this is when Republican candidates for the Senate had over four times as many fans on Facebook they had over six times as many followers on Facebook you'll recall we killed it in that election that was a that was a big year that was the same year I was doing the congressional race according to an Axio study done by News whip which measures social media engagement it is conservatives not lefties who even now continue to see huge growth of new high traffic websites and web pages even now even as Facebook is trying to kill us we're seeing a huge growth in these these websites why is that because there's a hunger for that information and it's not being supplied by the mainstream media The Drudge Report Drudge is basically as old as the Internet itself and it has never changed it's that same white page with the hyperlinks Drudge drives more traffic to news sites than all but five companies in the entire world Drudge drives more traffic to news sites than Google that's the dredge report that is explicitly a right-wing news outlet and news aggregator the left cannot keep up they can't keep up on this this is why by the way the left is much more likely to block and unfriend conservatives on social media much more unlikely according to one survey lefties are three times more likely to unfriend or block or ban conservatives than conservatives are to do that to lefties why is that because I see a bunch of lefty nonsense in my newsfeed and at dinners and at parties and in the culture all day long I can deal with it I think okay that's not true that isn't true here's why that's not true oh that gave me something to think about okay that made me think that my view is even more right than I thought it was okay do to do to do right but the lefties just aren't that strong they're not like I don't mean that only to be insulting I mean they haven't been training they haven't been working those muscles they haven't had to defend themselves and so they're just kind of weak they're intellectually weak and they're emotionally weak the culture has made them weak it's because the culture is so oppressive Lee on their side that they haven't been able to work out their muscles and defend themselves so they just unfriend unfriend can't take it don't want to hear it this is also why lefties of tech companies are now trying to cheat and censor conservatives and kick them off we know from James O'Keefe that Twitter is shadow banning conservatives looks like they might have shadow ban Ted Cruz we know that Facebook is censoring conservatives like like what are their names those two excellent Trump supporters those women I forget what are their names diamond and silk yeah they're so good really yeah they're censoring them they're censoring all of these people they're trying to kick them off their YouTube is censoring all of my videos practically everything that comes out of the Daily wire we could give a dissertation on I don't know the history of you know Francis Bacon or something and Francis Bacon the country's bacon no you know you could give a history on basically the most boring subject in the world and they would still censor it and it's because they don't like us they don't want us to get our views out there and this brings us to fake news do we have time to cover yeah we'll cover this right at the end and we'll cut to our interview with Dan this brings us to fake news because that's kind of underlying all of this the fake news face books helping the fake news and the Conservatives and Trump was fake news and he uses the tert blah blah blah there were two kinds of fake news there's traditional fake news and there's new fake news there's the traditional media and is the new media there's the old media there's the social media the traditional fake news has been around a long time fake news is not a new phenomenon there's nothing new now I will tell you a lot of what you see in mainstream news reporting and on the Internet is fake it's not maybe the stories aren't fake maybe the sentiment isn't fake but it's really hyped up it's an astroturf term astroturf is the is the opposite of grassroots a grassroots campaign is when people just kind of their own accord decide to bubble up and rise up and create a movement that's like the Tea Party for instance the Tea Party was a real grassroots movement astroturf is when operatives go in and they try to make it make it look like that try to create the appearance of a grassroots movement even though it's really just three guys behind computers creating fake accounts and liking and whatever doing all of that the the largest this is a news story that just came out today I think the largest black lives matter page on Facebook 700,000 Facebook fans is fake that's not a black lives matter page just totally think there's 700,000 Facebook fans it's a scam tied to a middle-aged white guy in Australia middle-aged white Australian lives matter it's a middle-aged white Australian guy who appears to have pilfered $100,000 from fund raisers on the black lives matter page the hub of black lives matter on Facebook just isn't real it's just a fake thing some guy saw that he could make some money every single political campaign in America does this sort of thing I promise you that so many of the of the groups and the pages on Facebook are created by political operatives who want to be able to wrangle people marshal public opinion get clicks to different websites raise some money fake accounts fake likes astroturf campaigns there are whole agencies that do this I've been on a lot of campaigns I've dealt with a lot of these guys I've seen it happen it goes it happens all the time this is not really anything new it's new to happen on Facebook in the old days it was just the mainstream who would do this mainstream media would do this exact same thing except for worse because would be beamed into everybody's living room and they would see all of these every night one way they do this ridiculous polls so they you know these so-called expert polls the mainstream media I think it was two nights before the election in 2016 ran a Princeton analysis that showed a 99% likelihood of Hillary Clinton winning in 2016 they analyzed all the polls all of the experts from Princeton no less an Ivy League university they found that there was a 99% chance that Hillary would win and and what that really means is don't go to the polls Republic it's over don't go you don't who cares it's not gonna matter stay home stay home public opinion polls these are public opinion polls that are meant to shape public opinion they're not polls of public opinion they're polls to create public opinion and there's a demoralized Republicans this isn't to say the polls are always wrong sometimes they're right in 2012 the polls were basically right but very frequently they're used in races around the country to push public opinion this is why by the way political campaigns Commission polls polls are very expensive to to undertake and campaigns do it so the faking push public opinion they can change the wording of questions in such a way that you get a number then you report the number and if you're a Democrat the mainstream media tout the number and they try to convince Republicans to stay home because it's a lost cause the other way that the mainstream media do this is the wonderful phrase critics say that's what they do they say you know Donald Trump's the economy is doing great and he's handling North Korea wonderfully and it appears that that trade war with China that we were saying was going to destroy the global economy actually his forced China to make concessions even though we didn't think that that would happen and everybody thinks he's doing a great job but critics say he's still a jerk and we hate him the critics say is mainstream media jargon for we it just means we there's no they don't name the critics it's just we now because of the internet because of social media this is much much less one-sided there's still fake news there's still gonna be a little Russian person trying to so division there's still going to be Democrats freaking out there's still all of these things but this Mark Zuckerberg should trial is a show trial this testimony is a show trial it's meant for him to say I'm sorry I'm sorry that Republicans finally won I know that we don't like Mark Zuckerberg on the right because he's a huge jerk doing is a big lefty we have to defend him on this this is just absolutely outrageous because this entire entire episode is about punishing Facebook for not punishing conservatives that's all this is about okay we have got to talk about what we can only hope is the imminent demise of public sector unions in the United States we're gonna do that with Dan DeSalvo fellow at the Manhattan Institute but first I gotta say goodbye don't I we've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube it's that time folks sorry if you were on Facebook or YouTube it's probably all shut off now the Democrats have finally said you know we've had enough mark we've had enough until you start electing more Democrats it's all over so I'm it's too bad but I guess I'm just talking to the wall right now please go to Daley wire com if you're at Daley wire com thank you

we'll be right back oK we've got to get to Dan DeSalvo who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and associate professor of political science in the colon Powell School at the City College of New York i sat down with Dan to discuss the upcoming Supreme Court decision in Janis versus American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Council 31 which could seriously finally hopefully weaken government unions in the United States here is our conversation an Illinois State child care specialist is decided that he does not want to pay his $45 per month fee to his Union bosses he never had a choice in the matter they just started taking it out and a lot of times with Supreme Court decisions this has gone all the way up to the Supreme Court a lot of times they have a little something to do there's like a nice providential twist on the name so you know the case of loving versus Virginia is a case about who you can marry and you know you have Barack Obama trying to the Little Sisters of the Poor suing the Obama administration you couldn't make a better name than that Little Sisters of the Poor and I really like that this is a Child Support Specialists because it's a guy who doesn't want to have money taken out of his paycheck the Supreme Court will soon decide Janis the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees Council 31 this is being billed as the most important labor decision in decades we are joined by Dan DeSalvo dan what are the stakes here well the stakes are very high this this case poor tends to have the biggest impact on public sector labor relations in probably two generations I think it's important to stress that this isn't gonna change anything in the private sector labor market which is where four-fifths of workers are but it will have a big impact on state and local government employment you know no less a labor advocate than Franklin Delano Roosevelt opposed public sector unions or government unions he observed famously that it is impossible to bargain collectively with the government because nobody in that negotiation really has at stake except for the taxpayer who obviously is not at the bargaining table how did we even get public sector unions in the first place well they took a long time and their trajectory has been totally different than private sector unions private sector unions were around since the late 19th century and really took off in the 30s under FDR but public sector unions really didn't get going until the 60s and 70s and that's because they're governed by state rather than federal laws so they're the legal regime is different and their historical trajectory is completely different speaking of those states in 2005 then Governor mitch Daniels got rid of public sector unions with the stroke of a pen and there wasn't much hubbub about all of that then six years later wisconsin governor scott walker tried to do it and he ended up getting recalled because of it or we ultimately won that recall election but he was protested there were crazy demonstrations all over Wisconsin how his public opinion changed over time on this issue and maybe more importantly how his legal opinion changed over time that's a great question what's changed is the public's become aware of this arrangement which is collective bargaining in the public sector you could say that from their creation in the 60s and 70s public employee unions were really operating Sabrosa unless you were a public employee or had one in your household you probably weren't really aware of their existence and they grew up to become powerful political players and it really wasn't until about 2005 or really the early parts of the century that people started to take notice of the power that they were wielding in politics and some people at mitch Daniels started to want to do something about it then walk as governor Scott Walker came along and with act 10 which is his signature piece of legislation and that obviously brought the issue to national and international attention so I think the public is now much better informed than they were 10 years it's certainly 20 years ago about where public sector you need what public sector unions are and how they operate that is certainly true and even talking to people in politics they don't always understand the distinction they just hear Union and they say oh well let's see how many you my father was in a union or something like that you argued in the New York Daily News that public sector unions are not only bad for the taxpayer which they doubtlessly are but they're also bad for the workers as well how's that well it's it's bad for some workers like mr. Janice that is in states like New York and elsewhere people don't want to be a member of the Union well they can't be forced to be a member but they can be forced to pay the Union as a condition of employment and it's a curious relationship because what there's not many other sectors of employment where you're forced to pay into a group that's so extensively involved in politics just in order to take your job which may or may not have anything to do with politics so that's what's one thing that's really unique about it and I think that's why for some workers it's it's not a great deal you could also say that certain bargaining strategies that the unions employ while they are trying to represent all workers equally that may mean that high-performing workers who might benefit from higher salaries or deserve them aren't going to earn those higher salaries because the union's of strategy works against that that's right the union's strategy of basically putting a ceiling on on what they could perhaps get otherwise and this is maybe why you see a discrepancy in some numbers there are almost 15 million union members in the United States 14.8 and there's a huge difference between the number of private sector and government worker union membership so 6.5 percent of private sector workers belong to a union over 30 percent of government workers belong to a union now is this because Union Buster's in the private sector are preventing the workers of the world from uniting or is this because workers don't want to shell out their hard-earned money for the political activities of their union bosses well the private sector story is again really different I think one of the points that needs to be stressed is just how we're talking about really two different worlds here and for years people saw public and private settings is the same thing and that was one of the justifications for importing the private sector model into the public sector the reality is the private sector the economy has changed from the 50s when public when private screenings were at their pinnacle and they the economy's changed industries dump businesses come into business they go out of business they're facing international competition the service sector economy has been notoriously hard to organize so private sector unionism has suffered multiple and different challenges over the last thirty years the public sector in comparison is an island of stability that is because government doesn't go out of business it's largely a monopoly provider of many services so it's not facing any competition from employers abroad or other business firms so it's really a different reality in the public and private sectors my final question is basically a political question though I suppose it's a legal question - just as Gorsuch during your oral arguments has been quiet and that could be a good thing that could probably just be a good thing are we going to see another 5-4 decision here and if so should conservatives throw a ticker tape parade for Donald Trump well I think we're probably very likely to see a 5-4 decision in this case in part because the case was in some sense already heard two years ago in a prior case called Friedreich's versus California Teachers Association which was in many respects identical and due to Justice Scalia's untimely death the court deadlocked four to four now we don't know how which justices constituted the four opposed and the four against them the decision I wonder I had a crystal ball a good supposition that we was lining for conservative justices against the four liberals so really in this case justice Gorsuch is the only let's say swing vote but I think people that follow the court closely see him is probably pretty solid on this and is not asking any questions in this case isn't really telling either way and we're likely to see a 5-4 decision running against the unions that is there any better news to leave on that is a really wonderful wonderful bit of news Dan thank you so much for being here we really appreciate the analysis because No when you look at these issues it was for so many decades people couldn't really tell what is this union how is this different what is that you know people only want to look at the really saucy Supreme Court decisions but issues like this collective bargaining for government union workers or government workers they can have huge huge effects on on federal budgets and on how our government works in our relationship to the government so it's good that we have probable good news coming out thanks for being here my pleasure that's some good news to end on that is some really good news to end on it before I go I would be really remiss if I didn't send out a special message it's a special day you if you've been on Twitter you've seen its national siblings day so I just like to wish a happy national siblings day to my twin Rachel Maddow it's been really it's been really nice having you around all these years and so happy national siblings day to you sis that's our show I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Knowles show I will see you tomorrow and we'll do it all again the Michael Knoll show is a daily wire forward publishing production executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey supervising producer Mathis Glover our technical producer is austin stevens edited by alex Zingaro audio is mixed by Mike Cora Mina hair and makeup is by Jeshua of era copyright for word publishing 2018
