1
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:35,460
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG WAS THE
FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY,

2
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,010
ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN LIVE,
HE HAS BEEN A DEMOCRAT, A

3
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,270
REPUBLICAN, AN INDEPENDENT, NOW
HE HAS MADE UP HIS MIND ON WHICH

4
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,570
WAY HE WILL GO IN THESE
ELECTIONS IN 2018 AND HE'S

5
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,000
COMING IN WITH A BOATLOAD OF
MONEY, SO THIS COULD MAKE A HUGE

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,100
IMPACT. HUFFPOST REPORTS --

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:01:15,770
OOOH, REPUBLICANS, YOU DON'T
LIKE THAT, RIGHT? I CAN'T

8
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,369
BELIEVE THIS GUY IS COMING IN
HERE WITH ALL THIS BIG MONEY IN

9
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,350
POLITICS. WE WILL COME BACK TO
THAT, HERE IS PART OF HIS

10
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:30,100
ANNOUNCEMENT ON TWITTER,
BLOOMBERG 

11
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
SAYS --

12
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:42,720
IN HIS FULL STATEMENT HE WENT
ON TO STATE WHY, HE SAID, AND

13
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,390
REMEMBER, HE IS A FORMER
REPUBLICAN --

14
00:01:44,390 --> 00:02:02,100
NOW, BLOOMBERG IS KNOWN FOR
SEVERAL THINGS, PROBABLY MOST

15
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,270
FAMOUSLY AT LEAST FROM A
RIGHT-WING PERSPECTIVE IS HIS

16
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,579
STANCE AGAINST GUNS. HE WANTS
GUN CONTROL. SO HERE COMES $80

17
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,180
MILLION TO COUNTER THE NRA AND
OTHERS ON THE ISSUE OF GUN

18
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,531
CONTROL. WHAT HAPPENED,
CONSERVATIVES? I THOUGHT YOU

19
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:21,200
LIKED MONEY IN POLITICS? THE
REALITY IS OF COURSE IF YOU ARE

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,570
A CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE YOU ARE
SAYING NO I DON'T, CENK, THAT'S

21
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,031
UNFAIR, I HATE THE CORRUPTION, I
HATE OUR POLITICIANS WHO TAKE

22
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:31,750
THAT MONEY AND I DON'T WANT
BLOOMBERG COMING IN AND SPENDING

23
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,730
THAT MONEY ON THESE ELECTIONS,
ESPECIALLY ON ISSUES I DON'T

24
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,770
AGREE WITH. BUT HEY, WHY YOU
KEEP VOTING FOR POLITICIANS THAT

25
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,660
DO THAT? BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN
POLITICIANS, EN MASSE, GENERALLY

26
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,910
SPEAKING -- NOT ALWAYS AT THE
STATE LEVEL, TO BE FAIR AT THE

27
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,860
STATE LEVEL THERE ARE SOME
HONEST, PRINCIPLED REPUBLICAN

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,070
POLITICIANS AND LEGISLATORS --
BUT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THEY

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,540
ARE ALMOST ALL FOR MONEY AND
POLITICS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT

30
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,590
THIS WILL BE FUN, WE WILL GET
MONEY FROM THE KOCH BROTHERS AND

31
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,820
SHELDON ADELSON AND
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND

32
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,440
WE WILL JUST KEEP TAKING THAT
MONEY. NOW THERE IS MONEY ON THE

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,750
OTHER SIDE, ALL OF A SUDDEN
THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE. I HAVE A

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,610
VERY CLEAR STANCE ON THAT WHICH
I WILL GET TO IN A SECOND. NOW,

35
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,970
HOW MUCH MONEY CAN BLOOMBERG PUT
IN IF HE REALLY WANTED TO? WELL,

36
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:23,930
HIS NET WORTH IS $51 BILLION.
NOT MILLION, BILLION. SO IF YOU

37
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,050
PUT IN $2 BILLION TO AN ELECTION
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD FEEL IT,

38
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,540
I DON'T THINK IT'S CLOSE, HE
WOULDN'T MISS IT. I MEAN, YOU

39
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,110
ARE SAYING THAT'S CRAZY, CENK,
HE CAN'T PUT $2 BILLION INTO AN

40
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,349
ELECTION. YES HE CAN. WE HAVE
LEGALIZED BRIBERY IN THIS

41
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:43,370
COUNTRY, HE CAN PUT AS MUCH
MONEY AS HE WANTS INTO AN

42
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,989
ELECTION. THERE ARE LIMITS ON
HOW MUCH YOU CAN GIVE TO AN

43
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,590
INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE BUT THOSE
ARE A JOKE BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,269
DO INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES, YOU
CAN SET UP SUPER PACS, DARK

45
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,260
MONEY, AT LEAST BLOOMBERG HAS
THE DECENCY TO SAY A PUBLIC AND

46
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,330
HE'S NOT HIDING IT, HE SAYS I'M
COMING FOR YOU. AM I A BIG

47
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,409
PROPONENT OF BLOOMBERG'S MONEY?
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T AGREE WITH

48
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:12,290
HIM ON, HE IS IN NORMA'S
ADVOCATE OF WALL STREET, I DON'T

49
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,940
AGREE WITH HIM ON THAT, HE DID
STOP AND FRISK IN NEW YORK, I

50
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,829
DON'T AGREE ON THAT. MOST
IMPORTANTLY, I DON'T THINK THAT

51
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:26,540
A SINGLE PERSON SHOULD BE
BUYING/BRIBING OUR POLITICIANS.

52
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,020
CALL ME CRAZY. WELL, THEN YOU
WOULD HAVE TO CALL 93% OF THE

53
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,800
COUNTRY CRAZY BECAUSE WE ALL
THINK THAT. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,789
DISAGREE WITH US ARE THE
POLITICIANS. SO ONE MORE QUOTE

55
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:52,020
HERE FROM HUFFPOST ABOUT
BLOOMBERG --

56
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,750
THAT'S WHERE REPUBLICANS
MIGHT HOWL EVEN MORE. IF YOU ARE

57
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,150
A SECOND AMENDMENT SUPPORTER
REPUBLICAN, NOW HE'S GOING TO

58
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,590
BUY OFF REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS
TOO. YEP. THEY CAN BUY ANYTHING

59
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,740
THEY WANT. IT IS AN OPEN
AUCTION, WE DON'T HAVE A

60
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,440
DEMOCRACY, WE HAVE AN OLIGARCHY
WHERE BLOOMBERG AND THE KOCH

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,030
BROTHERS ARE IN A BATTLE OVER
WHO IS GOING TO BRIBE

62
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,750
POLITICIANS MORE. IT'S INSANITY.
SO DO I WANT BLOOMBERG DOING

63
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,210
THIS IN THIS CURRENT
ENVIRONMENT? GOOD. GOOD. WHAT,

64
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,410
YOU THINK I WANT UNILATERAL
DISARMAMENT? NO, IF THE NRA IS

65
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,430
GOING TO PUT IN $80 MILLION INTO
AN ELECTION I HOPE BLOOMBERG

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,320
PUTS IN $80 MILLION. IF THE KOCH
BROTHERS AND ADELSON ARE GOING

67
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,069
TO DO IT, I HOPE SOROS AND
BLOOMBERG DO IT TOO. AND I HOPE

68
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:42,479
MOST OF ALL IT MAKES YOU REALIZE
BRIBERY IS BAD NO MATTER WHO IS

69
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,580
DOING IT OR WHICH SIDE. SO IN
THE END WHEN I SAY GET MONEY OUT

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,139
OF POLITICS DO I ALSO MEAN
BLOOMBERG'S MONEY? GOD DAMN

71
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,870
RIGHT I DO. OF COURSE WE SHOULD
GET BLOOMBERG'S MONEY OUT OF

72
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,720
POLITICS, AND ADELSON'S, AND THE
KOCH BROTHERS', AND

73
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,080
CORPORATIONS, AND UNIONS, WE
HAVE TO STOP ALL THE MONEY FROM

74
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,319
GOING INTO POLITICS. IF PRIVATE
INTERESTS FINANCE OUR ELECTIONS,

75
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,130
OUR POLITICIANS WILL WORK FOR
PRIVATE INTERESTS. SO THAT'S WHY

76
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,490
YOU NEED PUBLIC FINANCING SO
THEY WORK FOR THE PUBLIC, IT'S A

77
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,120
PURE MATTER OF LOGIC. OH, PUBLIC
FINANCING WOULD COST US A LOT OF

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,520
MONEY -- ARE YOU CRAZY? THOSE
TAX CUTS COST US TRILLIONS,

79
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,449
BECAUSE ALL THE POLITICIANS GOT
BRIBED INTO SUPPORTING THE TAX

80
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:38,250
CUTS FOR THE RICH. THE TOP 1% ON
AVERAGE GET $61,000 PER YEAR,

81
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:44,580
EVERY YEAR, FROM JUST THOSE ONE
SET OF TAX CUTS, LET ALONE THE

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,630
TAX CUTS THAT GO TO
CORPORATIONS, ETC. SO I WANT ALL

83
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,139
THE MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, I
WANT THE PRIVATE FINANCING OF

84
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:57,520
OUR ELECTIONS TO END BECAUSE IT
LEADS TO ENDLESS CORRUPTION. SO

85
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,080
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IN AN
ACTUAL, BIPARTISAN WAY, AND THE

86
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,250
GOOD NEWS IS DEMOCRATIC AND
REPUBLICAN VOTERS AGREE, WE HATE

87
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,370
THE CORRUPTION, 93% OF THE
COUNTRY SAYS THAT THERE

88
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,190
POLITICIANS REPRESENT THEIR
DONORS AND NOT THE VOTERS, AND

89
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,440
THEY ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. SO WHAT
ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

90
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,260
WOLF-PAC.COM, THAT IS TO GET THE
MONEY OUT, TO GET IT ALL OUT,

91
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,710
THEY ARE NONPARTISAN. IF YOU ARE
A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN AND YOU

92
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,800
WANT TO GET MONEY OUT OF
POLITICS THEY WILL SUPPORT YOU

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,669
WHOLEHEARTEDLY, THEY ARE DOING
IT RIGHT NOW WITH THE CANDIDATE

94
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,460
IN MARYLAND AS WE SPEAK, THEY
WILL DO IT AGAIN SOON WHETHER

95
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,250
IT'S DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, IF
YOU ARE AGAINST THAT IDEA, YOU

96
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,220
WANT TO KEEP MONEY IN POLITICS,
THEN WOLFPAC WILL COME FOR YOU.

97
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,091
YOU GOT MONEY IN POLITICS, SOME
OF THE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS AT

98
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:50,130
THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE ECSTATIC,
GIDDY, ABOUT THEIR SUGAR

99
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,150
DADDIES, IT TURNS OUT THERE ARE
OTHER PEOPLE WITH MONEY AS WELL,

100
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,229
AND THEY CAN ALSO COME FOR YOU.
HOW ABOUT WE GO BACK TO A

101
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:07,770
DEMOCRACY THAT ACTUALLY
REPRESENT THE VOTERS?

102
00:08:07,770 --> 00:00:00,000
WOLF-PAC.COM.
