WE HAVE TO VIEW OUR ROLE.
THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF
OPINION.
WE AS FRIENDS CAN DISCUSS THAT
OPENLY.
>> THANK YOU, CHANCELLOR.
WE NEED A RECIPROCAL
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WE DON'T
HAVE.
THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW HAS
A TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE
EUROPEAN UNION OF $151 BILLION.
THE CHANCELLOR AND I HAVE
DISCUSSED IT TODAY AT LENGTH.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.
WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE FAIR.
THE CHANCELLOR WANTS TO MAKE IT
MORE FAIR.
SAME WITH NATO.
WE HAVE A FAR GREATER BURDEN
THAN WE SHOULD HAVE.
OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE PAYING
MORE.
I'M NOT SAYING GERMANY ALONE.
OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE PAYING
MORE.
WE'RE PROTECTING EUROPE, AND YET
WE PAY BY FAR MORE THAN ANYBODY
ELSE.
NATO IS WONDERFUL, BUT IT HELPS
EUROPE MORE THAN IT HELPS US.
WHY ARE WE PAYING A VAST
MAJORITY OF THE COSTS?
SO WE'RE WORKING ON THOSE
THINGS.
IT'S BEEN UNFAIR.
I DON'T BLAME THE CHANCELLOR.
I DON'T BLAME GERMANY.
I DON'T BLAME THE EUROPEAN
UNION.
I BLAME THE PEOPLE PRECEDING ME
FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN.
THERE'S NO WAY WE SHOULD HAVE A
TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 BILLION.
SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT
RECIPROCAL.
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT A MUCH
MORE FAIR SITUATION.
AND I THINK IN THE END,
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE VERY
HAPPY.
I THINK BOTH COUNTRIES, I VIEW
THIS AS MANY COUNTRIES.
BUT LOOKING AT IT AS ONE BLOCK,
WILL REALLY BENEFIT.
THERE'S TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS
POTENTIAL BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN
UNION AND THE UNITED STATES.
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.
THERE'S ALSO TREMENDOUS BENEFIT
TO NATO WHEN PEOPLE PAY WHAT
THEY HAVE TO BE PAYING.
SOME COUNTRIES PAY MORE.
THEY THINK THE UNITED STATES IS
-- I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY NUMEROUS
COUNTRIES.
POLAND BEING ONE.
THEY PAY ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT
MORE THAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
PAYING OR HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE
THEY FEEL THE UNITED STATES IS
MORE THAN CARRYING THE LOAD.
PERHAPS THEY FEEL IT'S NOT FAIR.
BUT IT'S SOMETHING WE VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE.
THEY MAY NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP.
THAT MEANS I'M DOING A GOOD JOB.
I'M REPRESENTING THE UNITED
STATES.
ANGELA IS REPRESENTING GERMANY.
WE'LL TRY AND CATCH YOU.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RECIPROCAL
