00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,460
The design of this soy sauce bottle goes back to 1945 in Japan.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,080
A teenager named Kenji Ekuan had witnessed the aftermath of the atomic bomb

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,780
falling on his hometown hiroshima and was mourning the loss of his sister and father.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,980
After seeing the devastation, Ekuanâ€™s path changed.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,660
He first enrolled as a Buddhist monk following in the footsteps of his father.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,729
But instead he decided to become a "creator of things" and bring happiness to people.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,760
As a young designer, Ekuan got a contract to design a table top soy sauce bottle for food company Kikkoman.

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,980
Soy sauce is a must for Japanese meals, but it was originally sold in big bottles that were hard to hold.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,500
It took Ekuan three years and about a hundred prototypes to complete the design in 1961.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,640
The result is a small glass bottle with a narrow neck -- a shape reminiscent of traditional Japanese sake flasks.

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,600
It allows you to see how much sauce is left.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,480
It's stable on surfaces and comfortable to hold.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,620
The inward angle of the tip of the spout is also perfect at preventing drips and controlling flow.

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,240
The design of the little soy sauce bottle was just the start of Ekuan's great journey.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,560
He also went on to create other icons of Japanese design.

16
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,240
In Japan Ekuan has become almost as recognisable as his bottle

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,620
and fifty years later still appeared in commercials for the soy sauce.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,620
Today the bottle can be found on the tables of homes and restaurants in more than a hundred countries.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,260
And in 2015 the bottle was even exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

20
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,600
Simple but elegant, this is the design made to create a small moment of happiness,

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:00:00,000
without you even knowing it.
