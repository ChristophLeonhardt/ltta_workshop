PRESIDENT'S RALLY THROUGHOUT THE HOUR, BUT FIRST MY OPEN. WE NOW ENTER A NEW PHASE OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. AMIDST THE OUTRAGEOUS, OUTLANDISH LEFT-WING CHAOTIC MOB BEHAVIOR OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS. AMERICAN MOMENTUM IS NOW AROUND WINNING. THE WINNING THAT OUTSIDER CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP PROMISED US. NOT THE ANARCHY DEMOCRATS, AKA DEMON RATS WANT TO IMPOSE ON US. THESE THE TACTICS OF THESE DEMON RATS AND TRUMP-HATING LEFTISTS ARE BACKFIRING. AMERICANS ARE NOW BUYING INTO AND CHOOSING RESULTS OVER POLITICALLY CORRECT LOSING BEHAVIOR OF OTHER PRESIDENTS. WHEN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," BRET STEVENS, AND THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL'S" PEGGY NOONIAN SAID SENATE DEMOCRATS OVERPLAY THEIR HAND AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE BLOWING IT, YOU KNOW THEY SENSE WHAT'S COMING. AND IT'S NOT THE BLUE WAVE THE GENIUS PUNDITS PREDICTED. THEY KNOW THEY LOST THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY. AMERICANS DON'T LIKE LIES, INJUSTICE, AND THEY DON'T LIKE VIGILANTE OR MOB JUSTICE. THE INSANITY WE WITNESSES FROM THOSE SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME IS SHOCK AND UNPRECEDENTED. FROM BEING TOSSED OUT OF RESTAURANTS TO BEING DIRECTED TO HARASS, INTIMIDATE, CONFRONT AND MAKE A CROWD AROUND ANYONE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH, THEY RAMPED IT UP EVEN MORE DURING THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. SCREAMING, INTERRUPTING, SHOUTING DOWN SENATORS, BLOCK THEM FROM VOTING. AND THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO BLOCK THEM FROM VOTING AND IN THEIR FEIGNED LOSER OUTRAGE, THEY CLAW ON THE DOORS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AS KAVANAUGH IS BEING SWORN IN. AMERICANS ARE FAIR, AND THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH. ACCORDING TO REAL CLEAR POLITICS, REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN KEY STATES HAVE DRAMATICALLY TURNED THINGS AROUND. CRUZ, BLACKBURN, HELLER, MCSALLY, AND DEMON RAT CORY BOOKER WHO IS NOW THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE SENATE AFTER LIKENING HIMSELF TO SPARTACUS FELL FLAT OFF HIS CHARIOT. AND THEY JUSTIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR. YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT. JUDGE JEANINE: HILLARY, OUT OF POWER, CASH AND HARVEY SWINE STEIN AND YOUR OWN SEXUAL PREDATOR HUSBAND, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU STAND FOR. TAKE A LISTEN TO THIS ONE. WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH? NO, NO. WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK THEM. THAT'S WHAT THIS NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ABOUT. JUDGE JEANINE: REALLY, ERIC. YOU A FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES CONDONE VIOLENCE? SOMEONE WHO THINKS BELIEFS AND WORD JUSTIFY PHYSICAL ASSAULT? DID YOU EVEN GO TO LAW SCHOOL? LOOK. HERE IS THE BOTTOM LINE. WE ARE NOT EVEN TWO YEARS INTO TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. THE ECONOMY, RECORD HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, RECORD LOW. UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP AMERICANS SAVED $3.2 TRILLION IN TAXES. $3.3 3.3 MILLION JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED. THE MILITARY IS BEING REBUILT. 120 FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE BEEN APPOINTED. TWO UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. A MUCH-I AM MOVED TRADE DEAL A MUCH-IMPROVED TRADE DEAL WITH MEXICO AND CANADA. 80,000 ILLEGAL ALIENS HAVE BEEN DEPORTED BY I.C.E. 15 HOSTAGES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT HOME FROM NORTH KOREA, IRAN, VENEZUELA AND OF COURSE JUST TODAY, PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON FROM TURKEY. SO WHO TOLD THOSE TRUMP-HATING DEMON RATS AND THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA KEEP UP THE ANTICS. YOU ARE ALL LOSERS. SORE LOSERS. STUPID LOSERS, TOO DUMB TO EVEN KNOW YOU ARE LOSING. HE SAID IT HIMSELF. JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO IN KENTUCKY. PRESIDENT TRUMP: THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING.
