23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,570
I've learned over the past couple years

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,100
is to come a critical thinker now

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,810
there's no such thing as a true critical

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,790
thinker in my opinion I think it's a

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,580
sliding scale you can become<font color="#E5E5E5"> better at</font>

28
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,160
becoming a critical thinker and that's

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,759
by not having any loyalties towards a

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,500
particular individual in its why society

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,570
fails in many ways it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font>

32
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,030
and credentials you know what does

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you look throughout history</font>

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,100
at some of the biggest atrocities that

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,250
have happened it is in result of blind

42

at but just look with an open mind and

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,590
actually the more sources of information

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,979
you have the clearer the picture you can

50
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,900
have on an issue personally who do I

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,220
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what at the moment I've been</font>

heard he recently got into and he does

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,480
great videos in terms of TV networks and

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,390
that you know I do look at BBC News but

66
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,060
I look at it knowing who the funders are

67
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,430
of that organization so I will find a

68
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,050
story and then i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look across the</font>

69
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet at different blog posts and</font>

70
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,500
different news

71
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,290
articles of different facets and

72
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,500
opinions and evidence of stories The

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,010
Huffington Post<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at current TV</font>

74
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,460
with the Keith Olbermann report I even

75
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,160
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox News just to see and</font>

76
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,980
understand what the opposing views are

77
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,530
so you know by understanding it you can

78
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">then have dialogues with people not</font>

79
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,490
ignorant of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what their perspectives are</font>

80
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,040
and hopefully bridge and come to some

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,530
agreements in an argument that way so

82
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,380

102
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,780
videos I've written in 10 minutes on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">flooded out with a trailer thought which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">has just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nowhere so when I</font>

106
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,660
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack shelves at a supermarket I</font>

107
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,520
would um I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep her a receipt on</font>

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,290
me that i could write on the back on so

109
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,580
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was stacking shelves at this</font>

110
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,370
supermarket came to mind i could write

111
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,770
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so take a night book around with you</font>

112
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,440
or if you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smart phone you know</font>

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,510
same to take notes on and what you

114
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">should do is over time as you're adding</font>

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,530
more and more notes you'll be able to

116
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,510
paint a picture which you can then apply

117
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,630
to making a video or some poetry or some

118
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,910
music or even used to have conversations

119
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,890
with other people so whenever you have

120
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,290
energy it comes in pieces and you know

121
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">just make sure you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose it if</font>

122
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,220
you've gained something like saying

123
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,440
inspirational in mind write it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font>

124
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,630
save it because if you just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

125
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,340
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> it later unfortunately the</font>

126
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,610
human mind tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forget things</font>

127
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,430
Daisy may be on YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> asks what is</font>

128
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,110
your view on nuclear weapons and nuclear

129
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,210
power in general Nick the weapons are

130
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,689
ridiculous in the sickest form the

131
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,909
argument of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not disarming nuclear</font>

132
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,129
weapons is because why should we remove

133
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,199
ours when there are other countries in

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,939
the world that have them when actually

135
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the argument of why countries</font>

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have nuclear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weapons because</font>

137
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:37,590
other countries have them I don't

138
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,270
understand why we don't dismantle

139
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,430
nuclear arms ask other countries to do

140
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,990
it if other<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries have nuclear</font>

141
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,240
weapons and it's a fret then just spend

142
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,460
the money not on nuclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> weapons but on</font>

143
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,229
deterrence for nuclear arms do you know

144
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,849
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the amount of money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

145
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,219
sounds ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> because by building up</font>

146
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,080
our nuclear arms are we saying with so

147
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,699
on nukes us we can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and destroy</font>

148
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,319
the world just to have the Star Wars

149
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,779
project and an anti nuclear capabilities

150
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,639
put in place maybe I'm ignorant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

151
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,639
but it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes no sense that to make</font>

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world a safer place that we build up</font>

153
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,969
our nuclear arms spend that money on

154
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,430
deterrence and you will therefore

155
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,229
increase the chance of people disarming

156
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,690
their nuclear capabilities and the world

157
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,060
doesn't trust itself in different

158
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,710

nuclear energy but the nuclear waste

189
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:39,979
talked about this a lot before because

you know many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when you went</font>

191
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,059
for an interview is where can you see

yourself in 20 years and the truth is

193
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,519
who knows who knows where you're going

194
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,739

195
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,629
then you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been able to answer</font>

196
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:56,089
it because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a career for life now</font>

197

I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know where</font>

199

a right the the world's political

201
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:07,789

in a week's time if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about the</font>

years um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just impossible for me to</font>

212
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,990
answer hopefully still alive and

<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully I'm still able to do what I</font>

want which is educate people and help

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,149
change the world for the better and

216
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,699
finally at Barry Aldridge on twitter

217
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:49,459
asks what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meaning of life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

218
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,529
I've wanted to do a video about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

219
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,779
about a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now because I</font>

220
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,129
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the meaning of</font>

221
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">life which it's just an opinion and I</font>

222
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's to create legacy is to create</font>

223
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is an extension or it</font>

224
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,490
extends further than your existence on

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,509
the planet you want something that's

226
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,009
going to outlive you now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look</font>

227
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,430
back in with the Egyptians you know and

228
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,709
doing hieroglyphics you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

229
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,689
that whole notion of writing on paper

230
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,250
all doing a blog on the internet or a

231
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">video these things are going to last</font>

232
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,579
longer than you this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that I'm</font>

233
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,600
recording right now could possibly exist

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,019
and be open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the public longer than I</font>

235
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,610
am on this planet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

236
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,589
remarkable thing it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wanting to</font>

237
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:35,899
have children so that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

238
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,649
legacy it could be

239
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:41,119
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a company it could be</font>

240
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,610
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some legislation to change</font>

241
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,799
society for the better it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

242
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,049
religion and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling people</font>

243
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:50,839
about a religious belief you have you

244
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,879
look at any aspects of society where

245
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,649
people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave slank behind that</font>

246
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,899
is legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you know</font>

247
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,720
saying that legacy or creating a legacy

248
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,249
is the meaning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

249
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:04,309
offensive because anyone who would have

250
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,420
maybe a different view of what the

251
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,839
meaning of life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is um I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

252
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">includes that notion so maybe I'm being</font>

253
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,850
too simplistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I mean I think I was</font>

254
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,110
told once that the the physics the

255
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,819
meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life for physic scientists</font>

256
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,269
physicians is it on mess up completely

257
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:27,769
physicists I'm an idiot forgive me it's

258
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,819
been a tough week physicists would say

259
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,519
that the the meaning of<font color="#CCCCCC"> life is to act</font>

260
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,559
as a vehicle for the transfer of energy

261
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,829
that's just moving about in the universe

262
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,009
now that may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been changed since I</font>

263
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,360
was told that which was quite a few

264
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even that in a sense is a</font>

265
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,689
legacy because what you're leaving

266
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:52,089
behind is energy which then continues

267
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,519
that is the time um so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

268
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,739
in good time really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry I missed I</font>

269
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,449
messed up quite a few my words on this

270
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:01,759
but as always if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have any questions</font>

271
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,480
you'd like me to answer on next week's

272
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,639
episode you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> via twitter</font>

273
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,389
via Facebook as a youtube comment on

274
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,939
tumblr and why not post a video response

275
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,339
to this video with you answering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

276
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,919
same questions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did and the</font>

277
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,179
questions will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be available in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,389
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much for tuning in and</font>

280
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,249
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a coherent one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

281
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,559
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was messing up a few of my</font>

282
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,189
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just feel awful for many reasons</font>

283
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:34,730
and I didn't feel better talking about

284
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the people that always support</font>

285
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,439
me on youtube I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate it</font>

286
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:40,669
because I feel I have a real connection

287
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,199
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that watch my videos</font>

288
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:44,389
which may sound cliche but as I always

289
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:46,759
say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something sounds cliche it's</font>

290
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually because it's true and on that</font>

291
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,920
note<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I hope</font>

292
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,529
you have a good week and I will see you
