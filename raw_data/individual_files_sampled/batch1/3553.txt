the human body exhibits certain behavior under extreme stress situations like war westpoint psychology professor lieutenant colonel Dave Grossman specializes in the psychology and physiology of deadly combat according to Grossman here's how a soldier's body is likely to function on the battlefield it's common for soldiers to defecate the lower abdomen is a toxic waste site and the body is programmed to remove that waste before a life-and-death event the circulatory system immediately constricts blood vessels keeping blood away from the body surface this is why our faces turn white when we're terrified it's called vasoconstriction and in the event of trauma the process keeps enough blood in the body long enough for the soldier to finish the fight the body relaxes and blood flow returns to normal this is dangerous if soldiers are unprepared the wound that wasn't bleeding during battle could fatally bleed out afterwards that's why tourniquets must be applied immediately
