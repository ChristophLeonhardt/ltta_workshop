so I'd like to thank the Academy my wife my parents my agent and God Almighty for the great honor of being the top journalist target of Jew hatred in America over the past few months according to a comprehensive study from the anti-defamation league I'm honoured because being targeted by mouth-breathing idiots is a compliment you know you're doing something right if people who tweet pictures of gas chambers on the day of your child's birth find you unacceptable as a human being hint I also find you unacceptable as a human being here are some quick thoughts first Twitter should not ban the Jew haters as the dude who receives hook-nosed Jew memes more than any other journalist on planet Earth I don't believe people ought to be suspended or banned from Twitter or Facebook for posting vile garbage so long as you're not openly advocating violence I make a habit of retweeting these pieces of human crap in order to mock their stupidity and to expose the fact that people like this exist twitter has every right to ban people because it's a private company but that doesn't mean they should and every time they do they grant credibility to the monstrous people who want to play victim second yes the alt-right is anti-semitic there are a lot of people who consider themselves alright because they don't actually understand what the alt-right is you're not alright just because you back Trump you're not alright just because you hate the media alt-right means something and it means ethno-cultural European solidarity that has nothing to do with conservatism the Constitution or ideals of Liberty so read what the alt-right is we actually have a great piece over at Daily wire that you can check out by the same token downplaying the alt-right to anti-semitism as a mischievous and trolling as some people at sites like the Trump centric alt-right meeting site Breitbart like to do that's lying by omission and provides cover to evil third Jew hatred is not widespread among Trump supporters so the ADL report links Trump supports Jew hatred on Twitter there's no question that there's a very small but loud segment of alt-right Trump supporters who tweet gas chamber memes of people but it's pretty small the vast majority of from supporters find this sort of stuff absolutely reprehensible they're not in line with the alt-right I know it you know we all know it to overestimate the percentage of the population would be wrong in foolish forth a lot of online Jew hatred is astroturfed the ADL study shows Jew hatred on Twitter spikes at certain times and cascades on itself that means it's being coordinated or at least encouraged by specific Twitter personalities I can say with certainty the amount of Jew hatred in my Twitter feed has dropped exponentially since Twitter ban Milo which by the way is a ban I opposed Trump does wink by the way at the all right fifth as I said before Don front may not be an alt writer he isn't but he spends an awful lot of time and effort winking at them the hiring of Steve Ben and his campaign CEO a guy who turned breitbart.com from an edgy conservative site into an alt right Haven then bragged about it was a shout out Trump winking and nodding at Vladimir Putin that's part of the same pattern his language about international bankers and may not be intentional but the alt-right certainly treated it that way finally the media ignored jew-hatred if it's directed against the right the ADL has done a really good job of charting the rise of Jew hatred against conservative pundits but the entire media largely ignored that same Jew hatred so long as it only targeted people like me on the right and only began to notice it when it hit people on the left like Julia Joffe we Jews on the right who opposed Trump were used to it by the point the left figured out about a political magazine just did an entire piece like two weeks ago about anti-semitism among the segments of Trump supporters and they asked quote why has the Jewish right looked away this is patently insane and it demonstrates the myopia of much and left the left itself is replete with anti-semitism in Jew hatred just check their support for the Palestinians and their charter for the black lives matter movement so what's the future of the alt-right and all the sort of Jew hatred online if Trump wins it'll probably grow the alt-right feels emboldened by Trump but even if he loses they'll live on its sites that now rely on their enthusiastic support like Breitbart Iraq has been overturned the window of acceptability has moved and it's worthwhile fighting back i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so glad to be back I tattooed a break and now we're back into it the debate is tonight we will get to all that first we

to the debate stuff because obviously the big debate is tonight is it Trump's last chance or is it beyond Trump's last chance we'll talk about it what is his big plan but we have to start today with these two videos that broke while I was off for Sukkot Sukkot is the festival of booths this is the one where we sit outside in these kind of makeshift tents to symbolize how Jews traveled in the wilderness while I was off for a couple of days doing Sukkot I have a couple more days next week where I'm off but I'm doing a Friday show this week's a never fear you'll get your fill the the the James O'Keefe who does a great job with investigative journalism he broke a video in which he showed that there are people who work for the DNC who are involved in promoting voter fraud and also involved in promoting violence at Trump rallies here is a clip from one of O'Keefe's undercover videos this investigation has revealed compelling evidence of a dark money conspiracy a violation of federal campaign coordination laws between Hillary Clinton's campaign Priorities USA Hillary super PAC and the Democratic National Committee he's a big part of us too the campaigns and dancing cannot go game with priorities but i guaran-damn-tee you that the people who ran the super packs all talk talk to each other and me with you other people are the hubs oh there is a script there's a script okay the script of engagement sometimes the crazies bite sometimes the crazies don't fight they're starting confrontations in the line right they're not starting a conference of volunteers in the rally because once it inside the rally they're on the secret services control when they're outside the rally act it out they're harder to get in the media will cover it no matter where it happens I assume it's always in the rally initiating the conflict who's talking is Scott Foley's National Field Director at Americans United for change they're a group that works with a second group in that group works for the DNC's what he's talking about is the idea that they stack people in the line at Trump rallies in order to ask nasty questions of the Trump folks and try and elicit a violent response that the media can pick up on he actually talked about a situation where a 69 year old woman apparently did this to an older guy and the older guy hit her or at least she claims he hit her and this became a national media story I remember when it happened there was there was national media coverage of the 69 year old woman who claimed that she'd been assaulted by this Trump supporter he's saying we asked wrote her this kind of stuff and that's not the only allegation that that is being you know kind of fulfilled and proved correct by these tapes from O'Keefe and Project Veritas which is it which is a good organization there's also a second piece of information that is that these folks engage in voter fraud and are happy to do so so this is the second clip here in this it's got Fobo was talking about his voter fraud and he talks in the video about the idea that you rent cars and then you go to places and you just vote under an assumed name and you and you write in a ballot and it gets picked up now is this the kind of voter fraud that's going to shift massive presidential elections very difficult to say that that's the case so there is voter fraud voter fraud is extraordinarily real voter ID is necessary anybody who opposes the clearing of the rolls of dead people who opposes the idea that you identify yourself when you vote there's only one reason you want to do that and it's because you're basically okay with voter fraud because your side benefits from it voter fraud does happen voter fraud is the reason that Al Franken is in the Senate as opposed to norm coleman he ended up winning a race in 2008 the he was the 60th vote for Obamacare he ended up quote-unquote winning that race after a recount there was I think 2.8 million votes cast in that election hands it up quote-unquote winning it by like three hundred votes there's a there's voter fraud clearly in Washington State with regard to the 2004 gubernatorial election woman in christine Gregoire who was a Democrat supposedly beat a fellow named Dean Rossi and the gubernatorial race ended up winning by like a hundred and fifty votes out of again 2.5 million votes cast and that was voter fraud as well and obviously people talk about 1960 and all the dead people voting in Chicago for John F Kennedy as an example of voter fraud so voter fraud absolutely exists and O'Keefe is right to point it out and he'll keep his right to target it and the media who are attempting to downplay this attempting to pretend it doesn't exist trying to say that nobody admitted to any wrongdoing here both the oval the guy who's on this tape he's already resigned and the guy he works for has already resigned as well so obviously the Democrats know heads have to roll here or they're gonna be accountable for all of this so yes voter fraud is very real now with that said that's not the only kind of fraud that exists there's also media fraud so the media have completely ignored you know all the bad things that are going on with Hillary Clinton wiki leaks continue to come out demonstrating that Hillary is coordinating at very high levels with the media that the Hillary campaign was coordinating at very high levels with the DOJ and the FBI that was rigged investigation and and John Ashcroft the former attorney general of the United States says there's obviously evidence of a crime in the Clinton emails Donald Trump says this is a felony corrupt and it is a quid pro quo is it both well first of all I'm not in a position to make I don't haven't given a thorough investigation but offering a public official a benefit in return for the public official making a concession of some kind is illegal and not only is it illegal if it's if you're asking a public official to do something illegal it can be bribery if you offer a public official an incentive a benefit in order to do something that is legal if you offered to pay him or to give him a benefit to issue a grant to you or to organisation issuing grants is legal but it's not legal to offer a benefit in order to get it now this is 100% true okay what Ashcroft is saying here is 100% true obviously there's evidence of a lot of illegal activity and Hillary Clinton's emails and no one cares because the media are more focused on Donald Trump's shenanigans with women over the past thirty years they're also not that interested in Bill Clinton's shenanigans with women in the fact that Hillary Clinton helped cover those up and targeted the women involved there's apparently a new accuser who's now come forward today against Bill Clinton you know I'm not sure that this is relevant to the presidential race unless there's evidence that Hillary tried to cover it up but it just does demonstrate the media's level of interest when it comes to Bill Clinton is nil and their level of interest when it comes to Donald Trump is extraordinarily high he started making inappropriate gestures he we were responsible for editing our own stories and we had a very small editing room and he had touched my shoulder and done other things to me before in public around other people but that was just his nature to be very you know demonstrative and and touchy-feely as I call it but he followed me into an editing room the first time I remember that it was very small there was a chair I was sitting in a chair he came up behind me and started rubbing my shoulders and running his hands down toward my breasts and I was just Bill Clinton which should be the name of the TV show good times Bill Clinton and the media of course ignore all of this because it's not important to their narrative their narrative is that the Donald Trump is a scuzzbag with women and Bill Clinton is just well we'll just forget about him what will memory hold him he no longer matters in any way shape or form so I want to start off with this stuff because I want to point out a couple of things first of all it is true elections are rigged in a couple of senses the media are very heavily favoring Democrats they have for 80 years that is true it is also true that there is voter fraud although it doesn't exist on the scale of millions and millions and millions of votes it exists on the scale of probably tens of thousands of votes across the country at the very least it exists in the case of thousands of votes across the country in a tight tight election that's going to matter a lot now that said that said all that's legit to say that said what Donald Trump is saying about the rigging of this election is not correct so here is Donald Trump about the election and I just want to before we play this I just want to point something out there's gonna be the theme because we're gonna talk about the debate in a second I know there are a lot of people out there who are desperate to see Donald Trump win who really want to see Donald Trump win there's a large part of me that would love to see Donald Trump win just to stick it to the media and to stick it to Hillary Clinton and watch her weep as her life see ambitions crumble before her because that would be really really amusing for all the people who are rooting for Donald Trump to win you care more about Donald Trump winning at this point than Donald Trump does yeah I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings I hate to be the guy who brings you the reality if as I say all the time if you want to hear shows where they're gonna tell you things that you want to hear you can tune on over to a bunch of shows on Fox there's some syndicated radio shows that do the same thing I won't name names like Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity they'll tell you what you want to hear and they'll tell you that everything is hunky-dory Trump's gonna win he's gonna walk away with this thing all of it is not real all of it is not true you know that all the elections are rigged and when Donald Trump goes down in flames that's because he was stabbed in the back here is the truth Donald Trump now knows he's going to lose the polls are awful for him the national polls right now the last three major head-to-head national polls Fox News Trump down seven there's I think it says it a CBS poll Trump down nine and then there was a public PPR eye poll from the Atlantic Trump down 15 points in a head-to-head 51 to 36 he's getting brutalized in the polls he's not coming back and he's certainly not coming back with this particular strategy and here's the evidence that what I'm saying is true if Donald Trump wanted to win he'd have to do all the things you think he needs to do he would have to be disciplined he'd have to be focused he'd have to be very specific in his attacks on Hillary Clinton he would have to do a good job of deconstructing her in front of the American people instead Donald Trump is focusing all of his attention on how rigged everything is because his real goal here is not to win anymore he's not going to and he knows it his real goal here is to get to million of people like you and me people like us to believe that we that it was rigged that the media did it that the voter fraud did it that never Trump did it that it was somebody who is not Trump and if you just stand by Donald Trump he'll tell you the truth he's the great truth teller the great victorious truth teller and the reason he went down in flames is not because of Donald Trump and for $10.99 a month you too can be part of the team that's gonna make America great again at Trump TV that's where this is going okay this is all a movement toward what happens after the election and what he's doing right now in this election cycle only makes sense it only makes sense if you see it in that light like for example he's supposed to bring to the debate tonight he's supposed to bring to the debate tonight Barack Obama's half-brother okay well how many votes is that gonna win him any and what what's that designed to accomplish exactly and the answer is nothing it's not designed to accomplish anything except it's supposed to get a lot of people who are conservative people who are Republican people who hate Hillary and hate Obama to grin and that's fine so far as it goes but the man is running for president of the United States still it's still October it ain't November 8th yet when he's throwing red meat to his base that obviously has no draw for anyone outside of his base that means he's appealing deliberately to his base his base is not gonna drive him to victory in this election his base will pay $10 a month a million of them $10 a month at some Trump TV network and they'll clear 120 million dollars a year gross that's the goal here okay this isn't this is now a business proposition it is no longer a political proposition and I'll explain how I know that and why Donald Trump continues to talk about all of this all of this rigging in just a second but first we have to say hello to our friends over at trunk clubs so if you watched megyn kelly last week I was on megyn kelly show last week and I was wearing a brand-new snazzy khaki jacket and that jacket is really nice I got from front club who's tailored and it's

of Donald Trump talking about rigging because some things are written some things are not what Donald Trump has made a habit of doing is destroying conservative arguments by mouthing the arguments in the wrong context so Donald Trump will make arguments about how the media's bias but he'll do it in the context of the media actually telling the truth horizontal Trump will be talking about how the left is race-baiting but he'll do it in the context of him race-baiting and so what he's saying is true but the context actually helps his credit the argument here's an example of Trump doing that with the rigging again the goal of him saying this thing is rigged is not to win the goal of him saying this is rigged is to convince a bunch of people who are fans of his that if somebody's gonna get blamed after the election it shouldn't be him instead you should continue giving your money to Donald Trump I talked about the election being rigged it was just reported they're almost 2 million dead people right and a registered to vote right right and Inbal ryan gets up and issues a memo that he disagrees that the elections rigged what walk over to Philadelphia and st. Louis and Chicago these cities and and how how could he say the election is look nothing's perfect but this process is unbelievable and it's certainly rigged with the press so why would he issue a memo that the elections that busy naive because that's naivete or maybe something worse than lack of street smarts as you said last night I don't know what it is but you know when you go to Philadelphia where Romney gets zero votes will McCain got zero votes okay so he says about Philadelphia and there are precincts where McCain Romney got zero votes I think was 59 precincts out of 1700 something like that in in Philadelphia huhuhuh had made a good case against this sort of voter fraud all the you know this idea that is widespread he's gonna lose by 15 percent but it's all voter fraud again this discredits the argument there is real rigging its rigging from the media that is far to the left its rigging in the terms of actual voter fraud that exists on a relatively small scale but yes it exists and yes we should be concerned about all of that okay but it doesn't help when you have a guy who's gonna lose by 15 and then people are gonna say it's rigged okay it sounds like a stupid conspiracy theory because it is a stupid conspiracy theory here's Mike Pence may well actually hear here's Donald Trump saying the same thing well we'll do that in a second first we have to say goodbye to the folks on on Facebook and YouTube but if you want and we have a cool in the deal for you okay so I didn't pitch it yet I have a new novel it comes out November 1st but if you want it now and if you want it signed go to daily wire and become an annual subscriber right now eight nine eight bucks a month it makes you as subscriber to daily wire com you can watch the rest of the podcast live you can you can see it you can be part of the mailbag which we do on Thursdays here on the Ben Shapiro show and you can also write now for a special limited time you can also get my book it's called true allegiance and you can get it signed and it's recommended by Brad Thor even people who are big fans of Trump like Ann Coulter say it's a good book so whether you like Trump or they don't like Trump that's irrelevant to the book itself and it's an action novel sort of if you took everything in if you took everything in the United States and ramped it up by a factor of about three that's what this book is true allegiance and and you can get a copy of that for free signed when you go and subscribe to daily wire calm and and we are the biggest podcast a big biggest conservative podcast in the United States so thank you for that you
