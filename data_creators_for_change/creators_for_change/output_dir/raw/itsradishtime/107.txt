00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
hi friend so I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> every week I'm</font>

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,689
trying to slide into my blog like

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,330
anything's new place just do your best

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,280
yeah but I tried anything again I went

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,980
to to dance classes this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and I</font>

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,410
did try my<font color="#E5E5E5"> best and I'm not sorry about</font>

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,910
it trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things and meet new</font>

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,380
people when you live in a new city and

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,109
work from home is kind of tough so I

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,210
found a studio in my neighborhood<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,369
signed up I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a West African dance</font>

12
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,099
class which was dope it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most fun</font>

13
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,529
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like drummers and I somehow got</font>

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,950
invited to a funeral so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm in i</font>

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,630
also went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ballet class which was</font>

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,940
like seventy percent more intimidating

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,520
and i also somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like twenty two</font>

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,190
percent or sat ballet even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used</font>

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,360
to teach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to children but but I</font>

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,190
survived my favorite thing in college

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,800
now stay with me what's to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in</font>

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,289
the evenings or the early mornings and

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,809
watch for bunnies it should have

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:59,940
surprised me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess to see all these</font>

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,609
rabbits inhabiting this one large patch

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,379
of green space in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of downtown</font>

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,380
Milwaukee but it always did it wasn't so

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,630
much that they were there but how they

29
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,909
were there bunnies have kind of a

30
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,670
presence you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can see the moment</font>

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they hear your foot falls coming</font>

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,619
towards them and every little muscle and

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,680
their tiny bodies just see this up but

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,960
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you move towards them the</font>

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,659
rabbits never moved it look you right in

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,920
the eye with equal measures terror and

37
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,320
defiance and just wait for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass</font>

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,070
them to resume just running around i

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,320
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same semester that I started</font>

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,479
noticing rabbits I was taking a

41
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,939
statistics class for people who don't

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,880
math and our merciful professor being a

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,009
fan of other disciplines as well would

44
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,320
allow students to perform a talent in

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,060
front of the class for extra credit

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,799
points I know it was pretty weird but

47
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,509
the weirdest part was that after you did

48
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,340
your talent everybody in the class got

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,040
to vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> on whether you got one two or</font>

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,869
three extra percentage points on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

51
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,150
next test that was around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

52
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">as practicing guitar a ton plus</font>

53
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,790
statistics for me was difficult AF so

54
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,500
some extra point seemed pretty

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,290
attractive and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the next</font>

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">two weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I practiced my song over and</font>

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,960
over every day but I never played for

58
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,090
anyone before and suddenly my first

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,160
public performance was going to be in

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">front of a hundred of my most not having</font>

61
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,450
it peers on a Wednesday afternoon at two

62
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,220
thirty the night before<font color="#E5E5E5"> my hands were</font>

63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,870
shaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much I could barely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold the</font>

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,640
strings down it's not like performing

65
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,230
dance dance is easy because the house

66
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,450
lights are down so you can't see anybody

67
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,820
there you quite literally dance like no

68
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,620
one is watching but all I could think

69
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,810
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> was lifting my head up and seeing</font>

70
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,400
just rows upon amphitheater rows of

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,040
these north face jacket and 19 year olds

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,390
under fluorescent lights just judging so

73
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,750
I took a post<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i doodled a</font>

74
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,970
little rabbit and glued it to the back

75
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my guitar I thought to myself just</font>

76
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,330
focus right there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't even</font>

77
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,160
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to acknowledge that there's anyone</font>

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">else in the room and on the day I</font>

79
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,330
performed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the class I just stared at</font>

80
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,360
that little blue rabbit with equal

81
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,350
measures terror and defiance and

82
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,030
squeaked out my little song a zero

83
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,980
memory of how it actually went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

84
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,400
sitting in that plastic chair and then

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,010
after it was over my professor saying I

86
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,870
think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> all agree that that</font>

87
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,300
deserves three points no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote</font>

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,459
which I didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up needing by</font>

89
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,380
the way because well how do you know but

90
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,690
I got an A in statistics without the

91
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,480
points but new things new places try

92
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,750
your best I would really love if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,540
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a story of a time where you felt</font>

94
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,269
the footfalls of a scary thing coming

95
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,330
towards you and you stay there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

96
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,910
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it pass or you can tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

97
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,070
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're still too afraid</font>

98
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,489
to do yet and if at all you enjoyed this
