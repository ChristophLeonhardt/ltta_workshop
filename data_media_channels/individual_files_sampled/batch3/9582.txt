THE BORDER $5 MARGARITAS. CAN'T BELIEVE I DON'T ALREADY HAVE A T-SHIRT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GETTING A MAMMOGRAM AT AGE 40 MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH IN THE BATTLE AGAINST BREAST CANCER, THE COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY RECOMMENDS THEM AND RECEIVE BREAST CANCER SCREENING AT AGE 30 SO WHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? I SAW THIS NEWS EARLIER THIS WEEK, PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS. WHY DID THE AGE CHANGE? NOT NECESSARILY GETTING MAMMOGRAMS AT 30 BUT BEING EVALUATED FOR RISK FACTORS BY AGE 30, THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY AND SOCIETY OF BREAST IMAGING, THEY SAID WE NEED TO EVALUATE WOMEN BY THE AGE OF 30 TO DETERMINE IF THEY NEED BREAST CANCER SCREENING BEFORE THE AGE OF 30 BUT THE OTHER THING THEY NOTED IS AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HIGH RISK SUBSET BECAUSE AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN, THE SAME INCIDENCE AND OCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER, TEND TO HAVE MORE SEVERE CASES AND DIE MORE FROM IT SO THAT IS ANOTHER SIGN THESE GUIDELINES HAVE. I'M 35 AND HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THIS YET BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WOULD WAIT UNTIL 40. WHAT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SHOULD WE BE LOOKING FOR AND ASKING OUR DR.? A LOT OF WOMEN, MYSELF INCLUDED, IT GETS CONFUSING WITH THE GUIDELINES THE CHANGE ALL TIME BUT I DON'T WANT WOMEN TO GET CONFUSED. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RISK FACTORS, IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER MAYBE YOU HAD RADIATION, DENSE BREASTS OR CERTAIN GENETIC FACTORS THAT COULD MAKE YOU HAVE HIGH-RISK. TALK WITH YOUR DOCTOR EARLY TO DETERMINE WHAT YOU NEED. KERRIMAC WHAT ABOUT THIS WEEDKILLER THAT IS IN TONS OF FOOD IN THE UNITED STATES? WHAT IS THIS? THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A CHEMICAL WE SEE IN A LOT OF HERBICIDES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND TO FIND OUT HOW COMMONLY USED THE SUBSTANCE IS, THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT SAFETY AND HOW THIS AFFECTS PEOPLE AND MAY AFFECT PEOPLE DOWN THE LINE. ACADEMICIANS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AND CONFLICTING REPORTS. THERE IS GOOD RESEARCH ABOUT THIS CHEMICAL BUT THE OTHER THING, THE OTHER CHEMICALS USED ALONG WITH IT MAY POSE RISKS AS WELL. WE NEED A LOT OF INFORMATION.
