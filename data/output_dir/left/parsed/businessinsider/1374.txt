my best negotiation tactic is being
upfront and letting the other party know
I don't like
jerking around and to be jerked around I
like to come in and say what I want
something to be what I'm looking for
what I want to pay for it or be paid for
it and not go that far from that center
I don't like when people over price
things because they think that it's
eventually going to be a big negotiation
I don't like deal fatigue which happens
a lot with partners and people you're
negotiating with I think it puts a sour
taste in everyone I think a great deal
is one where both parties are singing a
little bit but also feel good about it
you should feel fair and decent about a
deal you shouldn't feel like you got
away with murder and you shouldn't feel
like you got hosed
