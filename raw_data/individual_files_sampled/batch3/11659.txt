staying with the u.s. leader presidents have the power to influence millions we know but few if any are as adept at using social media to get their message out as Donald J Trump Mikell Francis Santiago looks at the u.s. leaders unique form of Twitter diplomacy now on the stir it's causing in the news media after days of binge watching TV I think I finally discovered one thing that keeps the media buzzing Trump tweeting President Trump tweeting President Trump tweeting in part there is a new saying gaining prominence there's a trump tweet for everything the president tweeting the President Trump tweeted but it's hard to keep up with the president who uses Twitter to make us public statements and Trump rarely misses an opportunity to tweet so here's your usual day in the American media starting with some Trump tweets you might think that several reposts in the middle of the night is no biggie but it got thousands of retweets and became one of the first things Americans saw after turning on the TV in the morning president Trump has been busy this morning on social media retweeting in quick succession a series of alarming videos there's such a volume of tweets from the president we can't lose our ability to be shocked in fact the media got so caught up that towards the evening the whole world knew every detail about an organization that had previously been known only to a small audience in Britain this string of incidents from the president now includes the president retweeting three videos from a four right anti-muslim fringe political party but don't you worry that's not the only news that made headlines that day there was also a heated debate about the murder of a former Trump intern that in fact took place years ago President Trump has said and done things that are not only unpresidential they're really out of control the president the United States has used the firing of Matt Lauer to advance his false claims of fake news and to spread wildly inappropriate accusations against media figures including Joe Scarborough wonder why that story received so much attention both online and on TV well that's right because it came straight from the president's Twitter feed of course it might be surprising to see how much airtime is being given to Trump's tweets and it seems well either like a perfect way around for the media not to talk about things that matter or just a perfect scheme used by Trump to get a grip on the new cycle Donald Trump is a genius or insane or both I don't know or yes we're insane but I say we the mainstream media are because they keep following and hanging on every word oh but they do is they don't even have an agenda as I may also tell you they should thank God for him because they have nothing to say he does all the work for them think about this you're a news producer you take what Trump tweets to make a graphic out of it you put it up you have somebody read it and talk about it and there's your new short story no reporters no research no scouring the world nothing about Honduras I think about Syria I think about anything no no just Trump's tweets he's a genius they're the cat he is the beam of light and they're running into the wall
