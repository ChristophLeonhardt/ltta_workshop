1
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:03,330
CHARLES WAS TOTALLY

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,899
UNINTIMIDATED ALL THE WAY

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:05,766
THROUGH, BRAVE AND CLEAR

4
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:06,300
THINKING TO THE END.

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,602
WHAT A MAN.

6
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:09,803
TONIGHT WE WANT TO TALK TO SOME

7
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,106
OF THE PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM BEST

8
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,542
HERE AT FOX, STARTING WITH HIS

9
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,309
FRIEND OF MANY YEARS, BRIT HUME,

10
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,680
WHO JOINS US TONIGHT.

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,548
BRIT, PEOPLE LEFT

12
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:21,382
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, EVEN THOSE

13
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:22,917
WHO DISAGREED WITH HIM.

14
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:25,386
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HIM THAT THEY

15
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:25,920
WERE RESPONDING TO?

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,122
>> IT WAS A RARE COMBINATION,

17
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:29,723
TUCKER, AND THE SENSE THAT HE

18
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:32,326
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECT

19
00:00:32,326 --> 00:00:32,359
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECA

20
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:32,426
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECD

21
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:32,459
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECO

22
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:32,860
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECE

23
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:32,893
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECT

24
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:32,927
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECA

25
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:33,861
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECT

26
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:33,894
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECA

27
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:33,928
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECL

28
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:33,961
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECO

29
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,061
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECF

30
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:34,361
HAD THIS EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECA

31
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,863
SORT OF ADMIRED AND NONE OF US

32
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:36,597
REALIZED -- NONE OF US THOUGHT

33
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,533
WE COULD EVER COME CLOSE TO

34
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:39,900
EQUALING.

35
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,402
HE WAS LITERALLY IN A CLASS BY

36
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,069
HIMSELF.

37
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:44,071
HE WAS ONE OF A ONE-OF-A-KIND.

38
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,506
AND ON TOP OF THAT, HE HAD COME

39
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:48,309
UP FOR ALL OF THE SHARPNESS OF

40
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:52,379
HIS THOUGHT AND WRITING AND --

41
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,883
HE WAS EXTRAORDINARILY KIND AND

42
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:56,216
GENTLE.

43
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:57,418
AND THE COMBINATION MADE YOU

44
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:00,554
LOVE HIM, AND WE DID, ALL OF US

45
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:00,821
DID.

46
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,355
THE AUDIENCE DID.

47
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:05,893
YOU COULDN'T HELP IT.

48
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,695
YOU THINK ABOUT WERE DOING

49
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,729
TONIGHT, TUCKER, WE ARE ALL

50
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,997
FEELING SAD AND SORRY, BUT WE'VE

51
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:11,899
BEEN ON THE AIR SINCE 6:00 WHEN

52
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,367
THIS NEWS BROKE, AND WE ARE

53
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:15,102
TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE SUBJECT.

54
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,904
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT SAY,

55
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,806
THAT'S BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS

56
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,342
ON FOX IF HE WAS THEIR GUY.

57
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,376
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

58
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:25,312
BUT HE WAS A GIANT OF OUR TIME

59
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,414
AND ALL OF OUR TRADE, AND HE

60
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:30,651
CARRIED IT OUT TO THE HIGHEST

61
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:31,018
STANDARDS.

62
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:32,286
HE WROTE BEAUTIFULLY.

63
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,722
HE WAS CAREFUL ABOUT HIS FACTS.

64
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,290
HE THOUGHT THINGS THROUGH.

65
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,292
AND HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF WITH

66
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:39,159
EXTRAORDINARY DIGNITY AND GRACE

67
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,294
AND WE COULD ALL SEE IT AND CAN

68
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:45,265
ONLY ASPIRE TO IT.

69
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,501
>> Tucker: NO BITTERNESS, PURE

70
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:48,068
HUMANITY.

71
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:49,470
HIS INSTINCTS WERE SO

72
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,070
RELENTLESSLY DECENT.

73
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,906
I DON'T THINK I KNEW ANYONE WHO

74
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,841
DISLIKED HIM.

75
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:54,141
>> NO.

76
00:01:54,141 --> 00:01:55,876
I KNOW PEOPLE WHO DISAGREED WITH

77
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,511
HIM, AND THEY WERE SOMETIMES

78
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,713
ANNOYED OR OFFENDED BY, YOU

79
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:00,514
KNOW, THE SHARPNESS WITH WHICH

80
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,950
HE WROTE, PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AS

81
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,519
SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL AS CHARLES

82
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,120
UNFAILINGLY WAS.

83
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,354
BUT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, IF YOU

84
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:11,925
EVER SAW HIM OR WATCHED HIM, YOU

85
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,061
COULDN'T -- YOU COULDN'T DISLIKE

86
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:14,461
HIM.

87
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:16,030
YOU COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE

88
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,399
HIM, EVEN IF YOU DISAGREED WITH

89
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,299
HIM, YOU RECOGNIZE THE POWER IN

90
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,902
US OF HIS THOUGHT, THE

91
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:22,870
THOROUGHNESS OF HIS RESEARCH,

92
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,705
AND THE QUALITY OF HIS WRITING,

93
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:26,707
AND THE COMBINATION WAS STRONG.

94
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:28,809
IF YOU KNOW HIM PERSONALLY, THAT

95
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:30,911
WONDERFUL QUALITY HE HAD, THAT

96
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:31,912
KINDNESS, GENTLENESS, GRACE.

97
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,881
IF YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAD BEEN

98
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,683
THROUGH, YOU SAW THE WAY HE

99
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:39,486
HANDLED ALL THAT, YOU ADMIRED

100
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:41,422
HIM AS HE PROBABLY DIDN'T ADMIRE

101
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:41,889
ANYONE ELSE.

102
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,323
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE THAT I

103
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:46,493
ADMIRED MORE THAN I ADMIRED

104
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,428
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER AND DO TO

105
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:47,961
THIS DAY.

106
00:02:47,961 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: A SPEAK FOR SO MANY
