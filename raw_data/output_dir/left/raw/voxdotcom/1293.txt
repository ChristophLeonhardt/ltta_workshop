1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,850
If you walk around a shopping mall, turn on
the radio, or go to a coffee shop between

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,400
Thanksgiving and Christmas you’re gonna
hear this song.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,080
I don't want a lot for Christmas

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,450
That’s Mariah Carey’s 1994 hit “All
I want for Christmas Is You.”

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,401
It’s one of the most often played Christmas
songs ever.

6
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:27,360
And it happens to be one of the only Christmas
songs written in the last 20 years that has

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,450
reached the same popularity of the American
Christmas standards that came before it.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,479
So, here’s a question: What makes Mariah
Carey’s song sound so incredibly…

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,809
Christmassy?

10
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:50,429
… aside from those sleigh bells.

11
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,980
One of the greatest Christmas albums of all
time is A Christmas Gift for You from Phil

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,260
Spector.

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,170
It was originally released in 1963 to little
fanfare but then it was reissued in 1972.

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,449
At that point it instantly became a classic.

15
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:12,830
And if you look at Mariah Carey’s song it
is a direct style study of that 1972 Phil

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,030
Spector Christmas album.

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,659
The arrangement is just down to a tee.

18
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,920
That’s Adam Regusea.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,119
He teaches journalism at Mercer University
but studied music and composition.

20
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,369
Most directly she’s trying to imitate a
song titled “Christmas (Baby Please Come

21
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,369
Home)”

22
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,140
You can hear that so very clearly in how the
intro of both songs are structured.

23
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,729
Christmas!

24
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,490
Snow's coming down!

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:52,609
I don't want a lot for Christmas

26
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:57,640
But, if you look a little bit deeper into
Mariah Carey’s song you’ll see another

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
link.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,170
One to the best selling song of all time:
1942’s “White Christmas” by Irving Berlin

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,460
performed by Bing Crosby.

30
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,360
And to find that similarity you’ve got to
look at the chords.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,099
It’s all in the chords.

32
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,310
A chord is 3 or more notes played together.

33
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,130
“Christmas (Baby please come home)” that
Phil Spector song, I think that only has 4

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,130
chords in it.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,989
It's a 4 chord rock song.

36
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:30,370
There’s a lot more variety of chords used
in “All I want for Christmas is You” and

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,150
they harken back to a time when popular music
was largely informed by Jazz.

38
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,320
A Jazz standard might have 9 different chords
in it and chords of lots of different kinds

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
and flavors.

40
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,230
Not just majors and minors but diminished
and augmented and 7ths and 9ths and all that

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,230
kind of stuff.

42
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,519
And there is one very special chord in Mariah
Carey’s song that gives it such a classic

43
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,519
sound.

44
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,490
It’s no coincidence that that very chord
is also played in “White Christmas.”

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,810
So this is not going to sound great, I’m
playing it off my iphone.

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,159
We’re putting both songs in the key of C
for comparison.

47
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,659
So Carey starts on a tonic chord.

48
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,659
A home chord.

49
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,659
Chord one.

50
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,640
“I don’t want a lot for Christmas”

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,770
One seven.

52
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,989
“There’s just one thing I need”

53
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:17,989
Four chord.

54
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,150
Subdominant chord.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,209
“I don’t care about the presents”

56
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,349
And here’s the special chord.You could call
it a diminished two seven chord?

57
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,159
“Underneath the Christmas tree”

58
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,260
"I just want you for my own"

59
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:40,569
So the effect is going from a dominant chord
and kind of melting into this delicious spicy

60
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,439
warm little diminished chord.

61
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,850
Now if we were to compare that to Irving Berlin’s
“White Christmas” we see an incredibly

62
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,960
similar progression culminating that very
very special chord.

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,180
Irving Berlin starts this phrase with a tonic
chord

64
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:03,640
"Where the tree tops glisten and children
listen"

65
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,360
There’s that special chord.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:14,129
"To hear sleigh bells in the snow"
To me the right word is just melting.

67
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,570
You know it's like snow melting by the fire.

68
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,850
it’s these Jazzy chords that give Mariah
Carey’s song that kind of classic early

69
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,450
20th century Christmas Jazzy sound.

70
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,260
And it's just the most Christmassy sound in
the world.

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why.
