<font color="#CCCCCC">andrew ahead of earnings you upgraded to</font>

2
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,940
stocks yesterday what were they in why

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,449
sure the two stocks operator were

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,670
Continental Resources I took her CLR and

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,949
arena resources ticker ard upgraded both

6
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,810
of them from neutral to buys but did not

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,160
change our price target they're both

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,098
ironically $46 price targets the reason

9
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,989
I did it are twofold first of all off

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:35,940
you know I am fundamentally more

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,500
positive on oil stocks and then I'm on

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,420
gas stocks and these represent the last

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,739
two the oil way to companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,410
cover I when I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their activity</font>

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,539
sets you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> aside the fact that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> common</font>

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">element adding hedges and I think arena</font>

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,530
will add additional activity in 2010 I

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,079
think their activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> profiles should be</font>

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,239
more robust additionally when you

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,010
compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to the rest of space the</font>

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,180
stocks themselves had underperformed

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,190
over the last fall last month and

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,629
they're down ten to fifteen percent so I

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:01,879
felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the combination</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those two</font>

25
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,199
made it the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to upgrade when</font>

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:05,339
you talk about activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking</font>

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,430
about inventory yes I when I said cavity

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,229
I'm referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wells are</font>

29
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,060
going to drill in their key plays and if

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">you lo Continental Resources their key</font>

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,049
players the Bakken oil shale it's an oil

32
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,240
shale up in North Dakota and Montana and

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they're raising rig count from two</font>

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,710
rigs last year when oil prices were down

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,990
around thirty dollars to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15</font>

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,430
rigs you know this year with all our

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,259
prices close to closer to 75 to 80

38
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,600
dollars so outside of earnings obviously

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,100
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up are there other catalysts</font>

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,659
looming out there that can move your

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,450
sector yes I on the catalyst<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

42
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">short-term what I think will be</font>

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,799
important our year-end<font color="#CCCCCC"> reserve reports</font>

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,869
as we discussed earlier with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the change</font>

45
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,329
in pricing we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how gas</font>

46
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,610
companies fair with the new rules and

47
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,290
how oil companies differentiate

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,750
themselves as well as well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see quite a more data on economic</font>

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,710
expansion and how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> economy has kind</font>

51
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">of held through the fourth quarter so</font>

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,579
you had said you're more bullish on oil

53
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,009
than gas what would be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your top</font>

54
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,880
stock picks for 2010 yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean across</font>

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> space in the oil sector you know the</font>

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,560
continental it is definitely a very

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting stock it's a across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,580
board it's more of a consensus neutral

59
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,760
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short across it and I think given</font>

their increase in activity that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that x-ray activity potential</font>

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,350
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets them up to i think</font>

65
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,500
outperform in 2010 current<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidance is</font>

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,910
for ten percent growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think when you</font>

67
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,220
look at their asset by asset portfolios

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,959
that they could probably do you know

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:00:00,000
almost double that growth
