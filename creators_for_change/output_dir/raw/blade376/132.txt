00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone hope all is doing well</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,480
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my last video which was</font>

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,130
about ownership which you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,290
clicking here by the way I've had a lot

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,570
of emails and tweets and comments about

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,200
what my thoughts are on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> London riots</font>

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,089
which I thought I'd touched on in a kind

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:17,160
of subtle way on that video because it's

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,050
about ownership and possessions which is

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,029
off T what drive a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people to do</font>

11
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,460
what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> um but with the constant</font>

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,080
bombardment I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was fair for me</font>

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,390
to express what I thought and you know

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">just overall I think it was terrible</font>

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,159
what happened but with everything that

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,540
was happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media and with the</font>

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the police you know bombarding these</font>

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,940
people that obviously do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font>

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,230
that they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just think we're</font>

20
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,899
overreacting a bit it's just it's just

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,570
become so much and what it has become

22
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,730
too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and we need to put</font>

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,100
things in perspective there's currently

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,870
an e-petition going out saying that

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,280
these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested and</font>

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,050
convicted should no longer have their

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,350
benefits and I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that as</font>

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,879
being justified if anything is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,840
incur it's just gonna get<font color="#CCCCCC"> encouraged it</font>

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,049
more to happen in future so I say is you

31
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,000
know fine we've got the people that have

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,549
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so far but if you know just back</font>

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,200
away now that the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that haven't</font>

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,970
been caught just say fair enough it's

35
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,119
been just it's been a few days they've

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
got what they want and just let them get

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,650
on with it because I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

38
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's got a bit much really that</font>

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,670
the media and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> politicians with all</font>

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,439
their rhetoric it's just getting very

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,290
extreme and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a clean</font>

42
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:44,509
slate and yeah sure that's we cook great

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,930
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really so let's</font>

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,810
just call it quits and start a new slate

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,549
and everyone's happy and those who've

46
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,079
got stuff I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got stuff in those who</font>

55
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,370
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two video</font>

56
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,290
recommendations for you one of them is

57
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,270
the video I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned already which is</font>

58
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,130
about ownership which you can view there

59
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,050
and my second video recommendation is

60
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,790
called epic drink time just because my

61
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,140
brother helped me out with that and he

62
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,060
helped me out with this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so</font>

63
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm sure there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of questions</font>

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video if you want my real</font>

65
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,739
opinion about the riots it obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

66
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:34,660
very tragic and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

67
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,849
bigger picture anyone who<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks the</font>

68
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,980
people that were doing riots were evil

69
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,900
are wrong because the difference between

70
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,720
you I and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that were writing</font>

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,910
on the streets is circumstance if we

72
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,110
were brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that they</font>

73
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,090
were brought up there is something in

74
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,860
their environment which has caused them

75
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,780
to do that if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were given other</font>

76
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,489
opportunities and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas more</font>

77
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:57,010
resources to fulfill their actual dreams

78
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,569
and aspirations that they perhaps could

79
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:00,580
have had if shown another way in life

80
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,959
then perhaps they wouldn't have gone

81
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,910
down that route we do need to take short

82
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,370
term solutions but you know any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

83
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids that go into prison if we take away</font>

84
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the benefits from the people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> convicted that's going to push him</font>

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,250
further down the line we've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

87
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,930
look at the bigger picture you know when

88
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,730
i'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the train home from work now</font>

89
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,280
people talking very irrationally and

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,470
with emotion of anger but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the anger</font>

91
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,690
should be vented at the fact that how

92
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,850
have we created a society which allows

93
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,010
this to happen and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font>

94
00:03:30,010 --> 00:00:00,000
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asking</font>
