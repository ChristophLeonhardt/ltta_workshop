the three players at the center of the controversy Captain Steve Smith vice captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft are being sent back to Australia in disgrace in regard to the three players on report I want to stress that we are contemplating significant sanctions in each case these sanctions will reflect the gravity with which we view what has occurred and the damage it has done to the standing of Australian cricket a cricket australia investigation into the ball tampering incident in Cape Town concluded that only three players knew about it it involved scuffing up the ball with a small piece of tape that was improvised into sandpaper one of the players hid the tape in his trousers the Cricket Australia chief was at pains not to use the word cheating and confined the incident to just the three players but cricketing greats like former Australia captain Michael Clarke and former England captain Michael Vaughn took to social media to question how nobody else could have known there were also doubts on the streets of Sydney and calls for tough sanctions I'm convinced that the coach would never know about it I can't imagine the senior players doing that without their own demons approval and I'm sure most Aussies would think the same I think they should be stood down and and probably be suspended for a long period of time I think what what most people will expect is like pretty harsh punishments the foreign minister Julie Bishop says it's damaged Australia's reputation Australia is seen as a country that plays fair that plays by the rules that abides by the rulers and any attempt to gain an unfair advantage by carrying out an unlawful act essentially cheating is a surprise sanctions against the three players are expected within the next 24 hours but it may take more than that to repair the image of a sport very much intertwined with the nation's identity Yarber Malcolm al-jazeera Sydney
