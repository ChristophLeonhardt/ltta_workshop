1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,370
SO WE'VE HAD A RED WEDDING AND
WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNS OUT.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,200
HE DIDN'T TURN OUT WELL, BUT
THERE ARE WEDDINGS THAT

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,340
TURN OUT GREAT.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,800
RED WHITE AND BLUE WEDDINGS.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,020
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,560
I'M GOING TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS
ONE OF THE BEST WEDDINGS IN

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,560
AMERICA.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,710
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A LITTLE
VIDEO OF IT AND YOU ARE

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,839
GOING TO GO WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

10
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,429
IT SEEMS INNOCUOUS ENOUGH.

11
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:24,920
LET ME SHOW YOU THE LOVELY
WEDDING HERE AND THEN I

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,810
WILL TELL YOU WHY THIS LOVELY
COUPLE I THINK DID SOMETHING

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,569
INCREDIBLY PATRIOTIC AND WHY I
WANT TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.

14
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,760
LET'S WATCH.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,109
TODAY, IS ONE OF LIFE'S HAPPIEST
OCCASIONS.

16
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:43,530
BUT MARRIAGE INVOLVES MANY
EMOTIONS, GOOD AND NOT SO GOOD.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,500
B EACH OTHER SUPPORT SYSTEM.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,070
YOU WILL HAVE ALL OF US TO
LEAN ON AS WELL BUT ON A

19
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,109
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, YOU WILL NEED
EACH OTHER.

20
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:54,120
LISTEN, BE PATIENT.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,230
COMMUNICATE YOUR NEEDS.

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,370
AND DON'T FORGET THAT FRIENDSHIP
IS ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,370
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,390
FRIENDSHIP, LAUGHTER, AND LOVE.

25
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,739
THEY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT
LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BUT

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,520
FAIRLY NORMAL WEDDING.

27
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
WRONG.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,100
THOSE AMERICAN HEROES ARE JUSTIN
HAYASHI AND REBECCA CHAN.

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,939
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID TO THEIR
GUESS?

30
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:16,670
THEY SAID DON'T GIVE US ANY
GIFTS.

31
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:22,790
INSTEAD, PLEASE GIVE AT
WOLF-PAC.COM/WEDDING.

32
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,930
I AM NOT KIDDING.

33
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,229
THEY ASKED EVERY GUEST TO GIVE
TO WOLFPAC INSTEAD.

34
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:33,350
HOW MUCH DO I LOVE THESE GUYS?

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,780
THEY GOT NO GIFTS FOR THEIR
WEDDING.

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,240
ALL THEY GOT WAS PEOPLE GIVING
TO A CAUSE THAT THEY REALLY

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,660
BELIEVE IN WHICH IS TO OF COURSE
GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS SO WE

BUT THAT THE AMERICANS CAN HAVE

40
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,070
A TRUE VOICE AND SO I WAS MOVED
BY THAT.

41
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,680
THEY VISITED HERE AS WELL AND I
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE
