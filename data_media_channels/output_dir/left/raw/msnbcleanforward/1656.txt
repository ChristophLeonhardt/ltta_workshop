they were like totally focused in and

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,519
taking this down point by point well

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,880
remember they've heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this twice</font>

81

before<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've heard about this from</font>

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,870
various stages<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've seen other emails</font>

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,000
when the money from Ukraine is starting

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,310
to dry up after the Viktor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yanukovych</font>

gets booted out of office<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the gates</font>

90
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,330
tells him what the taxes are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

93
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,170
so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gates said is that he</font>

94
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,040
helped the

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the defense got Ric gates to</font>

108
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,770
heard the sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gory details about how</font>

109
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,580
he did it

110
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,830
how many times he did it they showed

111
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,960
emails they showed statements so they

112
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,479
they they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to nail down the</font>

113

evidence on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we heard for</font>

115
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ripped into him to basically say why</font>

116
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">should the jury believe you they said</font>

117

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he lied many times to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Muller's</font>

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> negotiating right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we and they say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a secret life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he was even lying to</font>

125
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,120

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,729
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> point when they asked is it possible</font>

127
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,620
that remember Manta<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford stepped down</font>

200
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,030

204
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,250
