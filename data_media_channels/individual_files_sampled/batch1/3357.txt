I think when you talk about wine obviously the word dry is probably the most misunderstood or misused word dry means by definition that there is no sugar in the wine oftentimes when we taste we smell a Riesling we instantly think it's sweet because it smells very fruity so we really should be a distinction between something that smells fruity and is sweet so oftentimes you could say something like I want something that's very high in aromatics or highly aromatic that could mean something's very floral or has a lot of citrus character to it tannin is something with red wines that is often spoke about you know between some ways we use it to really judge wines when we're blind tasting and even whether it goes with food so if you were to say I want something with a lot of tannin you're saying you want something that really impacts your palate that's very rich that maybe has an astringent see to go along with its fruit character or its alcohol content
