WE'RE GATHERED HERE TO HEAR

FROM THE VICTIMS OF AS 

66
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:15,835

67
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,437
WE HEAR THE SIDE. 

68
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,372
WE HEAR THE OTHER SIDE. 

69
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,807
THESE ARE CITIZENS PERMANENTLY 

70
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,010
SEPARATED FROM THEIR 

71
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,410
LOVED ONES. 

72
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,044
THE WORD "PERMANENTLY" BEING 

73
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,947
THE WORD YOU HAVE TO 

74
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:28,281
THINK ABOUT. 

75
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:28,614
PERMANENTLY. 

76
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,050
THEY'RE NOT SEPARATED FOR A DAY 

77
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,684
OR TWO DAYS. 

78
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,986
PERMANENTLY SEPARATED, BECAUSE 

79
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,954
THEY WERE KILLED BY 

80
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,455
CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS. 

81
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:40,360
THESE ARE THE FAMILIES THE 

82
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,793
MEDIA IGNORES. 

83
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,729
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEM. 

84
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,130
VERY UNFAIR. 

85
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,031
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERYBODY. 

86
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,867
BUT THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR 

87
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:48,167
SITUATION. 

88
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,371
AND I KNEW THAT YEARS AGO WHEN 

89
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,439
WE WOULD BE TOGETHER 

90
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,939
OUT CAMPAIGNING. 

91
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,509
AND I SAID, "IF THIS EVER 

92
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,110
HAPPENS, WE'RE NEVER 

93
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,912
FORGETTING YOU. 

94
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,948
YOU KNOW THAT, LAURA, 

95
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,248
EVERYBODY. 

96
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:02,682
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 

97
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,783
AND THEY'RE DEDICATED. 

98
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,451
THESE ARE THE STORIES THAT 

99
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,287
DEMOCRATS AND PEOPLE THAT 

100
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,922
ARE WEAK ON IMMIGRATION, THEY 

101
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,857
DON'T WAT TO DISCUSS, 

102
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,225
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR, THEY 

103
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,025
DON'T WANT TO SEE, 

104
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:15,961
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT. 

105
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,796
NO MAJOR NETWORKS SEND CAMERAS 

106
00:03:17,796 --> 00:03:19,232
TO THEIR HOMES OR 

107
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,935
DISPLAY THE IMAGES OF THEIR 

108
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,169
INCREDIBLE LOVED ONES 

109
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,303
ACROSS THE NIGHTLY NEWS. 

110
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:26,105
THEY DON'T DO THAT. 

111
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,307
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE KATIE 

112
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,775
AND DESTRUCTION 

113
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,210
CAUSED BY PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T 

114
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,711
BE HERE, PEOPLE THAT 

115
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,012
WILL CONTINUOUSLY GET INTO 

116
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,515
TROUBLE AND DO BAD 

117
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:36,883
THINGS. 

118
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,683
FOR YEARS, THEIR PAIN WAS MET 

119
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:38,217
WITH SILENCE, THEIR 

120
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,320
PLIGHT WAS MET WITH 

121
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,788
INDIFFERENCE, BUT NO MORE. 

122
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,357
I TOLD THEM THREE YEARS AGO 

123
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,524
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER, 

124
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:49,662
DAY ONE, JUST ABOUT DAY ONE, I 

125
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,830
WOULD SAY, I SAID UP 

126
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,597
I HEAR YOU. 

127
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:54,234
I SEE YOU, AND I WILL NEVER LET 

128
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:54,534
YOU DOWN." 

129
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,436
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING 

130
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,537
TOGETHER, AND THEIR LOVED 

131
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,505
ONES HAVE NOT DIED IN VAIN. 

132
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,507
WE ALL KNOW THAT. 

133
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,376
WE CALL THESE BRAVE AMERICANS 

134
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,111
THE ANGEL FAMILIES, 

135
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,312
ANGEL MOMS, ANGEL POPS. 

136
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,381
THESE ARE THE ANGEL FAMILIES. 

137
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:12,218
YOUR LOSS WILL IN THE HAVE BEEN 

138
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:12,919
IN VAIN. 

139
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,021
WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS, AND 

140
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,156
WE WILL MAKE SURE 

141
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,392
THAT THEY'RE PROPERLY TAKEN 

142
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:20,660
CARE OF. 

143
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,528
EVENTUALLY, THE WORD WILL GET 

144
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:22,728
OUT. 

145
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,130
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A SAFE 

146
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,397
COUNTRY. 

147
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,132
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SAFE 

148
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:26,966
COUNTRY, AND YOUR LOVED 

149
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,434
ONES ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING 

150
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,335
AND WILL CONTINUE TO 

151
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,703
PLAY A BIG PART IN IT. 

152
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,573
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? 

153
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:33,940
YOU KNOW THAT. 

154
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,543
SO HERE ARE JUST A FEW 

155
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,545
STATISTICS ON THE HUMAN TOLL 

156

173
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,614
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. 

174
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,517
I ALWAYS HEAR THAT, "OH, NO, 

175
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,117
THE POPULATION IS SAFER 

176
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,387

YOU HEAR THAT MUCH. 

181
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,226
IS THAT POSSIBLE? 

182
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,261
IT'S NOT TRUE. 

183
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,395
YOU HEAR THEY'RE BETTER PEOPLE 

184
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,432

186
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:38,304
IT'S NOT TRUE.

>> THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 

408
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,964

410
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,366
OVERNIGHT SHIFT. 

411
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,970
AN ILLEGAL ALIEN CAME IN, 

412
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,503
WANTED TO BUY CIGARETTES. 

413
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,039
DUMPED A JAR OF CHANGE OUT ON 

414
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:20,372

415
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,041
GRANT WENT TO COUNT THE CHANGE, 

416
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,444
AND WASN'T COUNTING 

417
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,145
FAST ENOUGH. 

418
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,747
SO BASICALLY THIS MAN PULLED A 

419
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:27,947
GUN. 

420
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:32,985
GRANT DID EVERYTHING HE WAS 

421
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,153

422
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,254
HIM THE CIGARETTES. 

423
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,590
THE MAN WENT AHEAD AND, CUTED 

424
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,391
HIM AND SHOT HIM 

425
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,959
POINT-BLANK IN THE FACE. 

426
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,595

ABEAC WAS A GROUP WE STARTED,

00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:43,609

IMMIGRANTS. 

607
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,952
I CAME THE RIGHT WAY: I PAID 

608
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,086

609
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,989
ME FIVE YEARS TO BECOME A

00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:44,890

611
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,557
AND I DIDN'T DOCTORING MY SON-

612
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:47,092

613
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:47,993
HE NAMED HIMSELF GERMAN

CHOCOLATE. 

615
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,462
HE WAS BORN IN GERMANY. 

616
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,697
I DIDN'T DRAG HIM OVER 

617
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:53,364

618
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:58,070
I DIDN'T PLACE HIM IN HARM'S

620
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,306
I PROTECTED MY CHILD FROM HARM, 

621
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,309
BUT I COULDN'T DO

THAT ON JULY 12th, 2012. 

623
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,047
HE WAS 30 YEARS OLD. 

624
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,750
I COULDN'T PROTECT HIM, BECAUSE 

625

THE JUDGE, THE DA, THEY KNEW 

632
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,464

633
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,867
THEY GAVE HIM PROBATION AFTER 

634
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,801

635
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,837
FIVE WEEKS LATER, HE KILLED MY 

636
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,571

THAT'S IT. 

642
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,753
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW, AND 

643
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:49,888
THEY DESERVE TO KNOW 

644
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,490

645
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,593

00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,241
DRUNKEN IN PUBLIC. úBOTTOM LINE 

745
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,676
THROUGH MESA, AND HE TRIED 

746
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,744
TO MAKE IT, AND HE WAS GOING -- 

747
00:22:59,744 --> 00:23:01,446
HE WAS THREE TIMES 

748
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,281
THE LEGAL LIMIT. 

749
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,383
SO THE POLICE TOLD ME THAT AT 

750
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,018
THAT, IT'S LIKE 

751
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,353
WEARING ALMOST BLACK-OUT 

752
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,287
GLASSES WHEN YOU'RE 

753
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:09,554
DRIVING. 

754
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,922
WHEN HE HIT THE GIRLS FROM 

755
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,724
BEHIND, IT WAS AN 

756
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,024
EXPLOSION. 

757
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,093
THE NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGHT A BOMB 

758
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:15,359
WENT OFF. 

759
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,462
THE GIRLS WERE ALMOST 

760
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,730
INSTANTANEOUSLY DEAD. 

761
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,931
THEY WORKED ON TESSA FOR 

762
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,900
AWHILE, AND I GOT TO SEE 

763
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,968
HER IN THE HOSPITAL. 

764
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:27,406
THOSE FROM THE DREAMERS THAT 

765
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,441
THE UNITED STATES 

766
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,541
SHOULD FOCUS ON. 

767
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,611
I CAN'T MAKE AN OPINION ABOUT 

768
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,447
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT 

769
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,481
ARE HERE ILLEGALLY BECAUSE 

770
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,449
THEIR PARENTS BROUGHT 

771
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,552
THEM, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU 

772
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,452
THE GOVERNMENT HAD 

773
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:43,421
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. 

774
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,190
AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO BLAME, 

775
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,325
BUT THE PARENTS OF 

776
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,527
THOSE CHILDREN ARE TO BLAME, 

777
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:51,429
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF, 

778
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,031
"WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL FEEL SORRY 

779
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:53,999
FOR THEM, BECAUSE 

780
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,234
THEY'RE KIDS, AND MAYBE IF 

781
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:56,734
THEY'LL BEHAVE, THEY'LL 

782
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,036
JUST MAGICALLY BEAT THE 

783
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:58,970
SYSTEM." 

784
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,137
MY MOM CAME FROM IRELAND. 

785
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:02,374
IT TOOK HER TEN YEARS TO GET 

786
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,675
HER CITIZENSHIP. 

787
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:04,309
SHE HAD A SPONSOR. 

788
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,178
IF SHE GOT IN TROUBLE, NOT ONLY 

789
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,879
DID SHE GET IN 

790
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,714
TROUBLE, THE SPONSOR WAS IN 

791
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,014
TROUBLE. 

792
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,616
I WOULD HAVE BEEN SPEAKING 

793
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,286
NORTHERN IRISH NOW IF SHE 

794
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:14,786
GOT OUT OF LINE. 

795
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,355
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS WITH INS 

796
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,489
IN THOSE DAYS, AND 

797
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:22,127
MOM LOVED BEING AN MERGE. 

798
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:26,431
I HELPED HER STUDY FOR EXAM. 

799
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,033
SO I'M ALL ABOUT LEGAL 

800
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:28,366
IMMIGRATION. 

801
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,268
BUT THE INVADERS AND PEOPLE WHO 

802
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:30,601
COME OVER OUR 

803
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:32,704
BORDERS AND STY TO TAKE THE LAW 

804
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,672
IN THEIR OWN HANDS 

805
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,409
AND MAYBE ARE SUPPORTED BY A 

806
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:37,876
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 

807
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:38,877
FOR GOD SAKES I DON'T KNOW WHY 

808
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,845
THEY WOULD WANT TO DO 

809
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,814
IT, IT'S EVIL, IT HURT PEOPLE, 

810
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,882
AND IT COSTS US 

811
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,883
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. 

812
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:48,119
AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO 

813
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:48,552
PAY FOR IT. 

814
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:52,123
THEY WANT US TO PAY FOR IT, THE 

815
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:52,556
OTHER TAX PAIRS. 

816
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:54,626
I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT 

817
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,694
TRUMP, BECAUSE WHEN MY -- 

818
00:24:56,694 --> 00:25:00,164
THOSE KIDS DIED, I WAS -- I WAS 

819
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,665
A CITY EMPLOYEE. 

820
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:04,035
SO OF COURSE I SUED THE CITY 

821
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,069
AND IT JUDGE AND THE 

822
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:07,439
ADJOINING CITY WITH THE JUDGE 

823
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:07,806
THERE, AND, OF 

824
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,207
COURSE,, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE 

825
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:09,440
IMMUNE. 

826
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,777
BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE ME REALLY 

827
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,545
FRIENDLY WITH THE CITY. 

828
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,515
IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FRIENDLY WITH 

829
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:17,848
ICE, BECAUSE 

830
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,451
BASICALLY THEY CLAIMED THEY 

831
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:19,917
WEREN'T CALLED. 

832
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,686
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAID, 

833
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,119
"WITH CALLED THEM," 

834
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,555
AND IT WAS A BACK AND FORTH. 

835
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,290
NO ONE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY. 

836
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,925
BEING IN THAT SITUATION WHERE 

837
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,827
NO ONE TAKES 

838
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,729
RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS 

839
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,230
GOVERNMENT AT ALL MEANS THAT 

840
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,833
YOU'RE STANDING IN A DARK 

841
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,635
FOREST AT NIGHT WHEN IT'S 

842
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,305
RAINING, AND IT'S COLD, AND 

843
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:40,972
YOU'RE LOST. 

844
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,675
EVERYBODY YOU TALK TO, YEAH, 

845
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,110
YEAH, YEAH, BUT HE WAS 

846
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,245
DRUNK, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF 

847
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:47,478
DRUNKS. 

848
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:48,113
LET ME TELL YOU, THE GUY 

849
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,614
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE 

850
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,082
AT THAT TIME. 

851
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,250
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE, 

852
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,451
AND WE HAD MANY 

853
00:25:53,451 --> 00:26:00,558
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET HIM OUT. 

854
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,492
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING? 

855
00:26:01,492 --> 00:26:03,561
OUR REPRESENTATIVE IS THE 

856
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,629
PRESIDENT AND THE VICE 

857
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:04,929
PRESIDENT. 

858
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,731
THEY TOOK US IN, AND WE'RE 

859
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,066
GOING TO FIGHT THIS 

860
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:09,300
BATTLE. 

861
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,136
AND WE'RE GOING TO WIN IT. 

862
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,105
AND WE'RE GOING TO CLEAN IT UP, 

863
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,507
AND I'M VERY PROUD 

864
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:15,774
OF THAT. 

865
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,176
I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A PART OF 

866
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,678
THAT, AND I WILL 

867
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,480
SUPPORT YOU AS LAW ENFORCEMENT 

868
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,581
AND MY PRESIDENT AND

VICE PRESIDENT SUBPOENAS THEY 

870
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:24,950
NEED.

I WANT TO THANK THE REMEMBRANCE

AND GOD BLESS YOU, AND I HOPE 

875
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:43,501

MY NAME IS ANGEL MOM AGNES

GIBBANY. 

887
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,488
MY FAMILY IMMIGRATED FROM HUNG 

888
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:03,989
BAYRY. 

889
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:04,622
WE ESCAPED DURING THE 

890
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:04,922
REVELATION. 

891
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,424
WE COULDN'T COME TO THE UNITED 

892
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,592
STATES AS MY MOTHER 

893
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,027
PLANNED, BECAUSE MY FATHER WAS 

894
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:09,661
BORN IN YUGOSLAVIA 

895
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,063
AND THEY WANTED TO STAY, AND 

896
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,298
BECAUSE MY MOTHER SAID 

897
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,433
NO, THEY DIDN'T ALLOW US TO 

898
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,469
COME TO THE AMERICAN 

899
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:17,735
EMBASSY. 

900
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:22,474
WE HAD A CHOICE OF SOUTH AFRICA 

901
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:22,774
OR BRAZIL. 

902
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,210
WE WANT TO BRAZIL AND LIVED 

903
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,578

904
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:29,514
TO LEGALLY IMMIGRATE TO THE 

905
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:29,881
UNITED STATES. 

906
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,784
WHEN WE IMMIGRATED TO BRAZIL, 

907
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,584
WE WERE STATELESS. 

908
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:34,386
WE DIDN'T BELONG ANYWHERE, 

909
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,787
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 

910
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,122
TOOK OUR CITIZENSHIP, BECAUSE 

911
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:37,455
WE ESCAPED. 

912
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,458
AND WHEN WE CAME TO THE UNITED 

913
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,326

914
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,427
STATELESS, AND I'M VERY HONORED 

915
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,228

916
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,864
THIS IS MY HOME, MY COUNTRY, 

917
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,932
AND I WILL FIGHT FOR 

918
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,535
THIS COUNTRY UNTIL MY DEATH. 

919
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:56,407
THANK YOU, LAW ENFORCEMENT,

926
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,182
WANT TO WALK IN OUR 

927
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:04,582
SHOES. 

928
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,384

I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. 

936
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,366

STATE, SO I WOULD 

940
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,405

THIS IS MY SON DREW. 

969
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:21,459
HE WS IN LAW SCHOOL IN SAN 

970
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,527
FRANCISCO IN 2010 WHEN 

971
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,929
ROBERTO GALO TRIED TO MAKE A 

972
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,563

00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:29,534

STOPPING. 

975
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,203
HE TRIED TO FLEE, SO HE 

976
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,972
ACCELERATED, DROVE OVER HIS 

977
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,006
BODY. 

978
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,941
MY SON WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE. 

979
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:37,541
HIS HELMET CAME OFF, WEDGED 

980
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,909
UNDER ONE OF HIS TIRES. 

981
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,211
HE BACKED UM, DRIVING OVER HIM 

982
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,481
A SECOND TIME, AND 

983
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,517
THEN TRYING TO GET AWAY, WENT 

984
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:47,785
FORWARD. 

985
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,087
BY THAT TIME A GUY HAD GOTTEN 

986
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,554
OUT OF A CAR AND 

987
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:54,392

988
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:54,892
MY SON'S ABDOMEN, AND

00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:57,428
FIVE PEOPLE HAD TO LIFT THE CAR 

990
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:57,929
OFF OF HIM. 

991
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,431

HE HAD BEEN DEPORTED 

1027
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,008
PREVIOUSLY. 

1028
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:17,541
ICE FILED A DETAINER. 

1029
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:24,015
THE DAY THEY DECIDED TO RELEASE

1039
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:42,633
THE STATE SAFER. 

1040
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,203
IF YOU KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT 

1041
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,604

THAT'S ABSURD, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS, 

1046
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:53,678

BE DONE. 

1048
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,146

WE WANT PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY 

1132
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,626

1135
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,132

THEY START DRAWING 

1137
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:29,800
