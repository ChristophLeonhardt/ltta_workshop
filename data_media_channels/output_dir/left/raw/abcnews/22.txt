1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:08,475
KNOW, IS READY IF NECESSARY.

2
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,943
LIKEWISE, I HAVE SPOKEN TO SOUTH

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,745
KOREA AND JAPAN, AND THEY ARE 

4
00:00:12,745 --> 00:00:16,349
NOT ONLY READY SHOULD FOOLISH OR

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,751
RECKLESS ACTS BE TAKEN BY NORTH 

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,420
KOREA, BUT THEY ARE WILLING TO 

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,259
SHOULDER MUCH OF THE COST OF ANY

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,729
FINANCIAL BURDEN, ANY OF THE 

9
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:32,465
COSTS ASSOCIATED BY THE UNITED 

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:38,738
STATES IN OPERATIONS IF SUCH AN 

11
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,506
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION IS FORCED 

12
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:41,841
UPON US.

13
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,042
HOPEFULLY POSITIVE THINGS WILL 

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,078
BE TAKING PLACE WITH RESPECT TO 

15
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:49,615
THE FUTURE OF NORTH KOREA, BUT 

16
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,353
IF THEY DON'T, WE ARE MORE READY

17
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:57,390
THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,924
NORTH KOREA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY 

19
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:01,894
TO END DECADES OF POVERTY AND 

20
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:04,263
OPPRESSION BY FOLLOWING THE PATH

21
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,467
OF DE-NUCLEARIZATION AND JOINING

22
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,938
THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, AND I 

23
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,941
HOPE THAT KIM JONG-UN WILL 

24
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,744
ULTIMATELY DO WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT

25
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,180
ONLY FOR HIMSELF, BUT PERHAPS 

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,350
MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS RIGHT 

27
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,519
FOR HIS PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,756
GREATLY AND NEEDLESSLY.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,125
ALL OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE, NORTH 

30
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:36,362
AND SOUTH, DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO

31
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,899
LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY, 

32
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,768
PROSPERITY AND PEACE.

33
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:44,337
THAT BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL FUTURE

34
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,973
CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THE THREAT 

35
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,878
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS REMOVED.

36
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,948
NO WAY IT CAN HAPPEN OTHERWISE.

37
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,649
IF AND WHEN KIM JONG-UN CHOOSES 

38
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,884
TO ENGAGE IN CONSTRUCTIVE 

39
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:04,958
DIALOGUE AND ACTIONS, I AM 

40
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,626
WAITING.

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,930
IN THE MEANTIME, OUR VERY STRONG

42
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,432
SANCTIONS, BY FAR THE STRONGEST 

43
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:16,936
SANCTIONS EVER IMPOSED AND 

44
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,672
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN WILL 

45
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,609
CONTINUE AS IT HAS BEEN 

46
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,010
CONTINUING, BUT NO MATTER WHAT 

47
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,115
HAPPENS AND WHAT WE DO, WE WILL 

48
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,352
NEVER, EVER COMPROMISE THE 

49
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,655
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE 

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,922
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

51
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:40,426
WE WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT 

52
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:45,498
FEEL VERY, VERY STRONGLY ABOUT 

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:45,664
IT.

54
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,200
OUR MILITARY AS YOU KNOW, HAS 

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,504
BEEN GREATLY ENHANCED.

56
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,138
WE'LL SOON BE AT A LEVEL THAT 

57
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,207
IT'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

58
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,544
OUR APPROVAL OF $700 BILLION 

59
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:03,016
THIS YEAR, AND $716 BILLION NEXT

60
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,218
YEAR LARGELY DUE TO THE HELP OF 

61
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,087
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WITH ME 

62
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,324
TODAY AND STANDING RIGHT HERE, 

63
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,359
WE APPRECIATE.

64
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,861
BUT WE HAD TO DO THAT FOR OUR 

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,795
MILITARY, AND WE HAVE DONE IT 

66
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,164
AND HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING WILL 

67
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,565
WORK OUT WELL WITH NORTH KOREA, 

68
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,534
AND A LOT OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

69
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,171
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT PERHAPS 

70
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,774
AND WE WOULD WAIT, IT'S POSSIBLE

71
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,176
THAT THE EXISTING SUMMIT COULD 

72
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,646
TAKE PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME 

73
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,714
LATER DATE.

74
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,481
NOBODY SHOULD BE ANXIOUS.

75
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,318
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT.

76
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:38,518
OKAY.

77
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,187
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE 

78
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,624
SOMETHING ELSE WHICH I HAVE TO 

79
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,524
TELL YOU, ALL OF YOU CHAIRMEN, 

80
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,660
MIKE AND EVERYBODY.

81
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,197
THAT WAS A BIG DEAL UNTIL THIS 

82
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,498
CAME UP.

83
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:52,965
I DON'T KNOW.

84
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,298
WHERE'S MIKE?

85
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:55,935
WHERE ARE YOU?

86
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,302
CONGRATULATIONS.

87
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,937
YOU DID A GREAT JOB, BUT IT 

88
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,640
DOESN'T SEEM SO IMPORTANT NOW.

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,407
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT.

90
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,109
>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 

91
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,110

101
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:22,095

THIS IS FROM THE LETTER HE SENT 

107
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,136
KIM JONG-UN EARLIER TODAY.

108
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,005
HE SAID, SADLY BASED ON THE 

109
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:33,539
TREMENDOUS ANGER AND OPEN 

110
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,974
HOSTILITY DISPLAYED IN YOUR MOST

111
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,843
RECENT STATEMENT, I FEEL IT IS

I WANT TO GO TO CECILIA VEGA,

WHAT HAPPENED?

126
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,066
>> Reporter: IN SOME WAYS, TOM, 

127
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:00,566
THIS WAS NO SURPRISE.

128
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,667
THEY HAVE BEEN ON SHAKY GROUND 

129
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,936
ABOUT THIS MEETING FOR A COUPLE 

130
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,138

131
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,639

FORTH ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS 

134
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:10,743
MEETING WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE 

135
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:10,943
PLACE.

136
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,512
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY WITH 

137
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,213
THE LANGUAGE THAT NORTH KOREA 

138
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,614
USED, CALLING VICE PRESIDENT 

139
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,483
PENCE RECENTLY IGNORANT AND 

140
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:17,716
STUPID.

141
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,252
HE CALLED HIM A POLITICAL DUMMY 

142
00:05:20,252 --> 00:05:21,787
FOR THESE COMMENTS THAT THE VICE

143
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:22,521
PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT WOULD 

144
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:28,060
HAPPEN TO KIM JONG-UN.

145
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,963
ESSENTIALLILYY SAYING IF HE DOET

146
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,699
MAKE A MOVE WITH THE U.S., HE 

147
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,934
MIGHT END UP DEAD.

148
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,969
THERE WAS ANGER TAKEN TO THAT, 

149
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,471
AND THE MESSAGE COMING FROM 

150
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,972
NORTH KOREA, BUT LET'S GO BACK 

151
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,140
TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST 

152
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,941
SAID RIGHT HERE IN THE WHITE 

153
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,075
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

154
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,544
THIS WAS NOT JUST STRONG 

155
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,578
LANGUAGE.

156
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,447
THIS WILL BE INTERPRETED I THINK

157
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,615
BY MANY IN THE CITY AND PERHAPS 

158
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,717
AROUND THE WORLD AS PERHAPS A 

159
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:52,318
THREAT.

160
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,619
MEETING NORTH KOREA WITH ITS OWN

161
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,820
RHETORIC ABOUT MILITARY USE, 

162
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,790
SAYING THAT HE SPOKE TO GENERAL 

163
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,891
MATTIS, THE DEFENSE SECRETARY, 

164
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,193
AND THE JOINT CHIEFS TODAY.

165
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,627
BY FAR, HE IS SAYING THAT OUR 

166
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,896
MILITARY IS BY FAR THE MOST 

167
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,832
POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.

168
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,433
QUOTE, THEY ARE READY SHOULD 

169
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,603
FOOLISH OR RECKLESS ACTS BE 

170
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,170
TAKEN.

171
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,904
THAT IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE, 

172
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,539
AND WE WILL WAIT TO SEE HOW 

173
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,740
NORTH KOREA REACTS TO THAT.

174
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,641
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT 

175
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,843
DID SAY THAT THERE WAS POTENTIAL

176
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:21,480
FOR A MEETING TO STILL HAPPEN, 

177
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,114
BUT TOM, I HAVE GOT TO SAY, I 

178
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,082
THINK UNIFORMLY HERE IN THIS 

179
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,717
TOWN, THE SENTIMENT IS 

180
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,951
QUESTIONABLE AT TO WHETHER THAT 

181
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,487
WILL ACTUALLY GO FORWARD.

182
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,458
>> SO TRUE, CECILIA.

183
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,125
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORAN, 

184
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,428
OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.

185
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,396
WHAT SET THEM OFF APPARENTLY WAS

186
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,097
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

187
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,700
MENTIONING THE LIBYAN MODEL.

188
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,436
JOHN BOLTON DID, AND NORTH 

189
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,337
KOREA'S RESPONSE WAS A, QUOTE, 

190
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,739
NUCLEAR TO NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN IF 

191
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,742
WE DON'T HAVE A MEETING AND ALSO

192
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,178
CALLING MIKE PENCE A POLITICAL 

193
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:52,378
DUMMY.

194
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,845
WHY WAS THAT SUCH A RED FLAG FOR

195
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:55,047
THE NORTH KOREANS?

196
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,550
>> Reporter: WELL, BOTH VICE 

197
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,151
PRESIDENT PENCE AND NATIONAL 

198
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,085
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON 

199
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:04,123
RAISED THE LIBYA MODEL AS THE 

200
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,091
TEMPLATE FOR THE NORTH KOREA 

201
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:06,526
DEAL.

202
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,093
THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC 

203
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,529
BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING.

204
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,830
GADDAFI GAVE UP HIS NUCLEAR 

205
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,169
WEAPONS AND IT WAS IN THE 

206
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,638
PROCESS.

207
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,238
UNTIL 2003, HE GAVE IT ALL UP 

208
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:19,872
AFTER SEEING THE UNITED STATES 

209
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:20,339
SWEEP THROUGH IRAQ.

210
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,674
HE WAS WORRIED AND EIGHT YEARS 

211
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,676
LATER, HE ENDED UP OVERTHROWN, 

212
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,644
DRAGGED FROM A DRAINAGE DITCH, 

213
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:29,382
BEATEN BY A MOB AND SHOT.

214
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,351
AND ESSENTIALLY PENCE AND BOLTON

215
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,985
ARE SAYING, YOU HAVE TO TAKE 

216
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,853
THAT DEAL, AND THAT ALARMED THE 

217
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,556
NORTH KOREAN REGIME, AND KIM WAS

218
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,090
INSULTED BY IT AND SO THE 

219
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,325
RHETORIC WENT UP, AND THEY WENT 

220
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,593
BACK TO SQUARE ONE.

221
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,929
WE HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE.

222
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,565
NORTH KOREA IN THE PAST HAS 

223
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,767
DISD

224
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,136
DISMANTLED NUCLEAR FACILITIES AS

225
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,838
THEY CUT A DEAL WITH AMERICAN 

226
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:53,472
PRESIDENTS AND THEY HAVE GONE 

227
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,774
BACK AS SOON AS THEY GET THE WAR

228
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,176
TALK BACKED OFF SOME, AND SOME 

229
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:57,977
BREATHING ROOM.

230
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,145
A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH 

231
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,478
CHINA.

232
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:00,646
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT KIM 

233
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,114
JONG-UN HAS LEARNED FROM HIS 

234
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:06,418
FATHER, AND CLEARLY IT WAS THE 

235
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:08,286
TRIGGER OF WHAT VICE PRESIDENT 

236
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,122
PENCE SAID ABOUT LIBYA, BUT HE 

237
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,791
WAS ALSO NEVER CLEAR ABOUT WHAT 

238
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,526
DE-NUCLEARIZATION ACTUALLY 

239
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,528
MEANT.

240
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,996
WOULD HE ACTUALLY GIVE UP ALL OF

241
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:18,664
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

242
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,200
THAT REMAINS THE KEY QUESTION 

243
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,268
FOR HIM AND FROM PRESIDENT 

244
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:22,468
TRUMP.

245
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,770
IF HE WANTS A DEAL, WILL HE LIVE

246
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,939
WITH SOMETHING SHORT OF 

247
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,343
COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE, 

248
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,344
DE-NUCLE

249
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:32,778
DE-NUCLEARIZATION. 

250
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,111
>> THANK YOU.

251
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:33,477
JUST TO RECAP.

252
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,347
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS CANCELED THE

253
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,482
JUNE 12th SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE 

254
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,150
WITH NORTH KOREA.

255
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,385
SAYING NOW IS NOT A TIME TO BE 

256
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:41,620
ANXIOUS, BUT OUR MILITARY IS 

257
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,054
READY.

258
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,090
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THIS 

259
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,427
