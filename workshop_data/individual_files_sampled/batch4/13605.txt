around the country left-wingers are doing some serious soul-searching re-examining their beliefs in the aftermath of an election in which they were defeated at every level of government while their ideas were utterly rejected almost everywhere and their personal integrity was impugned plus their hopes and dreams crushed all their opponents and danced over the wreckage breathing in the sweet sweet perfume of their suffering and drinking the honey nectar of their tears and laughing and loud voices saying ha ha ha ha ha in academia Columbia College professor Ludwig von Thatcher asari examined left-wing behavior and a poignant essay in the New York Times a former newspaper the essay read in part quote the truth is on college campuses we have been one-sided and small-minded and have closed ourselves off from ordinary Americans in a virtual bubble and it's just not enough we need tonight we need to make the bubble real and possibly build it out of iron so we can't even see what's going on outside also when we shout down anyone who disagrees with us we need to update our amplification equipment since some of their ideas are still audible unquote in the news media CNN anchorman wolf mendacity told his colleagues quote clearly the problem is fake news and how to get more people to believe it I know some say that when we call people racist and sexist and anti-semitic we should have proof that our charges are true but that would mean completely abandoning our journalistic standards and traditions also it sounds like an awful lot of work maybe even harder than making stuff up which can take almost an hour and be very tiring unquote Hollywood VIPs also joined in the self-examination actress Lena privileged star of the hit HBO series sluts and author of the memoir it's a hit even if no one watches it because I say so penned a series of tweets saying quote only a bunch of racist butt heads would elect someone who constantly calls people names we should kick the crap out of every person who supported this bully and anyone who believes in his politics of exclusion should not be allowed to work in show business unquote miss privilege later announced she was checking into a rehab clinic in order to be with her fans former corrupt Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has denied the electoral losses were her fault saying quote I am calling for a recount because I cannot accept the election of a man who would not have accepted the election of a woman who will not accept the election of a man who would not accept my election I am however accepting donations to my foundation and while I can no longer promise an ambassadorship in return for a thousand bucks I'll come to your home and do your dishes while singing Danny Boy unquote mrs.

talk a lot about God and atheism and Dave has a lot of atheist in his audience I must have said something really intelligent because the atheists have been attacking me all day how could you say so I thought I must have said for something really good believe me if I did it was totally an accident don't blame me all right we're going to talk about Muslims basically in the aftermath of that Ohio incident because I really the way these stories are covered now has become so wrote that we almost don't notice how stupid it is and I really want to talk about that before we just we do have to pay a little bit of attention to Donald Trump and the transition because I have to say there's something there's something getting to be almost surreal I mean I know that's it there's an overused word for you but something getting to be almost surreal about this transition because all the important stuff that's happening is great I mean I love the guys he's picking Jeff Sessions I love the guy you know to vote for education yesterday he picked for Health and Human Services this guy the House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price who has been a vocal opponent of Obamacare and has even proposed his own law his own version of how we would supply people with health care without forcing them on government it provides with it provides people with tax incentives to sign up for insurance do we have that cut that I sent him that was eleska yeah he explained why he was asked well isn't that the same thing but he explained why it wasn't it couldn't be more different Obamacare puts the government in charge we put people in charge we put patients in charge what we say is that the patient every single American ought to have the opportunity to purchase the coverage that they want for themselves not that the government forces them to buy you think about about what what we're moving toward we're moving toward a system where the federal government defines every single thing about your health coverage but every single Americans health care and as I mention before when the federal government has the ability the power to decide what health care is then it has the power to decide what health care isn't right and if you think something is health care that the federal government doesn't think is health care the federal government always wins in that so so this is great I mean these are these are peas appointing people who are good people this guy's an orthopedic surgeon as well as a congressman he's who are good people who are set up to do the things that he promised would get done repealing and replacing Obamacare one of them you know it's really exciting even even the things that I'm worried about like one of the things I'm worried about is that Trump is a basically at heart a Democrat I'm afraid he'll spend too much money but so far his his soup infrastructure plan looks like a really clever idea too you know that's still taking shape and I'm not sure how it's gonna come out and infrastructure is always very difficult because people picture all these shovel-ready jobs but they don't really use shovels anymore to build infrastructure they use these machines and the guys who handle the machines of these technicians and they're like four of them on a you know it doesn't really create as many jobs as it used to and it's people think it does but still the thing that he's doing is again using tax incentives during the Obama administration I want to get too much in the high weeds about this but during the Obama administration a lot of people who did not trust Obama as steward of the economy and steward of the country kept their money out of the country I'm talking about trillions of dollars out of the country he's Trump is trying to arrange it so that these guys say okay we'll come back in you're not gonna regulate us to death you're not gonna hold up our plans you're not gonna destroy our businesses with your regulations we'll bring our money back in if that money floods in there will be jobs and that'll that'll work so so far all the important stuff he's doing really well then these tweets these I don't even understand why somebody doesn't just take his phone you know there's this there's this recount effort on I I don't even know to be honest with this is Jill Stein who strikes me as just a complete flapdoodle I mean it's like you know somebody needs to put her in a cage somewhere it's like it where's Jill or Bay but her in the cage she sleeps better in the cage I mean it just needs the cage trained this woman and she's calling for a recount in Wisconsin in Michigan and Pennsylvania I think she missed the Pennsylvania deadline Hillary Clinton who said the worst possible thing she called it horrific horrific that Donald Trump would think about questioning the results of an election she has joined in this recount effort no one seems to feel except some right-wing talk-show hosts or making you know people panic about it no one seems to feel that there is just too many votes separating them out it's not gonna it's not gonna happen I don't even think they're gonna pull it off in some of these places I think it's just Jill Stein's way of raising money you know paying off her campaign debt or something well and by the way if Jill Stein hadn't been in the race Hillary Clinton would have won in in some of these states I mean no votes for Hillary Clinton to prevent it from winning so the whole thing is crazy so then Trump comes out and he tweets oh I would have won even the popular vote if millions of illegals hadn't voted which is like what poor Katrina Peters and remember Katrina Peterson was a spokeswoman for Walsh he goes on megyn kelly and may I mean this megyn kelly must do this for sport you know tearing apart Katrina Peters and trying to defend Donald Trump tweets is like what you do just to get kind of get in shape for the real interviews embarrassing where does he get his evidence that millions of illegal immigrant election that millions of people voted legally well I think it's a combination of things man you can look at the daily the daily call our back in October wrote an article about showing what voter fraud looks like and they listed 23 states and the instances that happened there you can go back to the LA Times about a year ago where they talked about Governor Jerry Brown's voter motor registration which automatically had people so it's it's it's a sin a position they say 2 million well but there have been instances like in Iowa there was a some a woman who was convicted and prosecuted for voting and she would make millions do how a woman well a woman does not equal millions and millions possible months or a year earlier does not make it actually happen on November right well I also think that's something we should look at you know the argument here is that you can't prove it well how about we do looking at anything when your team won that's a very good question you know but I mean it's so easy I called their country no Peterson its Pearson right between appears I mean what I think all these people who a substitute for Trump who speak for Trump really just need to come up with one response like up for his tweets because his tweets are just these dopey things that he does you know they just want to come out yeah the guy's crazy he is one crazy mo you know I don't I don't know what the hell he's it off so today oh and and the other thing of course is that the way the press reacts now this is listen as somebody who's been around journalism all most of my life I have to tell you this is news when there's no news you know this is news when there's no news and Trump is very good at that so today he tweets that flag-burning is a disgusting should be punishable by a year in jail or loss of citizenship you know now I actually believe you should lose your citizenship for certain things like if your car alarm goes off in the middle of the night and you don't stop it I think you should actually be exiled from the you are you are exiled from our country you know however however the press goes nuts about this is unconstitutional because the Supreme Court has said that flag-burning is protected speech but Hillary Clinton in 2005 proposed an anti flag-burning law and the punishment was a year in jail a hundred thousand dollars I think fine or a year in jail so it's not that crazy but it's just like he's doing so well at his transition I mean the transition is actually I'm really impressed as somebody who voted for him with great you know I had to wrestle with my conscience a long time before I thought I'm gonna vote for this guy because Hillary Clinton is so corrupt and Obama has corrupted the government made my decision but I'm thrilled with what he's doing so far obviously he hasn't actually done anything but I'm thrilled with his appointments you know I just say you know Ben Shapiro has this thing all this I'm good Trump bad from but I think it's all one guy you know I think we I think that same guy it's like it's not dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde is kind of like heckle yeah he's just one guy who does these crazy things but actually listen if if he says stupid stuff for four or eight years and does great stuff I'm good that's fine with me so I can live with that but it is gonna be extremely entertaining all right let's talk about Ohio State this is really really interesting thank God it wasn't any worse than it is we're not talking about a terrible tragedy one of the reasons I want to I do want to talk about is because we don't have to deal with the bodies it's I think 11 11 people injured bad enough but still a student at this is in Columbus Ohio at Ohio State University his name it was Abdul Razak Ali our Tom drives his car into a bunch of people and then gets out and goes after them with a knife cuts up people after hurting them with the car there is a campus cop who was attending to something else the campus cop confronts the guy the guy charges and shouts at him says put down the night that the guy charges him of the knife campus cop shoots him okay so Tim Cain you remember Tim Cain does anybody remember Tim Cain he was gonna be the vice president if Hillary Clinton won yeah I know remember Hillary Clinton if she was the nevermind but Tim Kaine tweets out so help me so help me let me see if I just wanna get deeply saddened by the senseless act of gun violence I mean he must have just missed heard what happened but that's the thing they're all on automatic you know automatic you know democrat talking points senseless gun violence ago wait wait the guy was attacking people with a knife and the cops shot him not that's not a senseless act of gun oh yeah still probably drinking after the loss you know if senseless I what is what is it gun violence something I don't know just don't mention Islam that's all that's all I can remember from being a Democrat candidate then there was another guy a civil rights guy who says how is it that when a white man shoots a black man we decide he's a hero there's nothing good tweet it's like yeah I think it's because he's a hero all right we're gonna talk some more about this because it really does get absurd and it really is worth looking at the way this was covered and the way it's and the way it's discussed but first we have to say goodbye we have to say goodbye to our friends on Facebook and YouTube and come on over to the Daily wire and subscribe so you can be in tomorrow's mailbag and ask your questions and who knows we may even get you a date
