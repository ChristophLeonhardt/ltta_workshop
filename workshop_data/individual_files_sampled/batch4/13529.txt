trying to remember where we work well we believe there's a soul or something like a soul of pattern information that represents who you are that floats off the body and goes continues on si I don't know I honestly I don't know and I don't think anybody has a great verifiable account of that I have suspicions but again their suspicions less and less about knowledge what I do know and the reason why I'm religious is that a religious lifestyle that that is based on certain fundamental premises I think makes life better for people I think that the rules that are set down you know as currently understood at least our rules that that are likely to lead you to leading a happier and better life then then your pure reason alone because pure reason alone Unleashed without even those moorings in judeo-christianity can lead to a lot of really terrible places but I want to ask you about your version of heaven because we talk about heaven so we can get back to that very conversation just a second but you're in your newest book is heavens on earth the scientific search for the afterlife immortality and utopia and you make a pretty compelling case that heaven on earth is basically to a certain extent you enjoying yourself transcendentally that basically if you go out and look at a forest that that may be heaven on earth or as close to it as you're gonna get not just that though that really just living a full meaningful life and being engaged with other people in your society with your family and friends and so on that this is it and we should be doing this anyway whether there is an afterlife or not because these are good things to do so in the last chapter I deal with well if it's oh you're an atheist if there's no afterlife maybe there is but whether there is or not we don't live in the afterlife we live in this life we know that we're not we're not living in the here and after hereafter we're living in the here and now so make the most of it but not the most of it by like just plugging in the morphine drip all right you know sucking down you know whiskey all night or with you know whatever whatever your pleasures are it turns out that research shows that that doesn't do it for most people it's not enough I mean there are some just pure hedonist it just you know get stoned all day or whatever but most people find that unsatisfying and so there's things between happiness and meaningfulness so leading a happy life if this is your goal the things you do are more short-term immediate likely a pain-free life but you know pain-free or it's just fun like going out for dinner with dinner and drinks the family and friends okay that's fun three hours later it's over it's like okay now what but doing something that's more long-term either in your looking back to your past what have I done with my life that's productive what am I going to do in the next 20-30 years and then doing things that are not fun or pleasurable now like the example I use in the book is caretaking I've I have four parents stepparents and bio parents and I was caretaker for two of them and this wasn't fun at all I had it wasn't pleasurable driving my dad around all these hospitals and then the nursing homes and in the pharmacies and you know I'd get home I just exhausted but but I feel better as a person having done that cuz I kind of feel like well they did this for me when I was little and I would want somebody to do that for me and the cycle of life and all it you know and and those kinds of things are something much simpler like working out in the morning like this morning I did a couple hour bike ride with the guys it's not fun when we're going really hard I mean it's kind of painful actually but when I'm done I'm like I feel better about myself I did that and then down the line it's a good thing to do that's kind of so and this is the concept of flow also that when you're in constant work the happiest you are like when you when you are one with the work that you're doing and I totally agree with this by the way I think that the happiness in life is not utterly disconnected from action in life I think that the attempt to make a hard break between okay so you take a bunch of stuff that you hate during life and you're gonna hate it your whole life and they're gonna die and everything's gonna get fixed in heaven I actually don't think that's a very good way to teach religion number one right number two I don't know that's what religion is here that's to do I think that thing that religion is here to better your life here on earth and then if you believe in an afterlife if you believe that there is a rectification of the of the wrongs that you experienced at the hands of others you were you're a baby who's killed by the Nazis and now there's an afterlife where you're going to move on that's that's a different question slightly than what religion provides to most people
