mood<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to punch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone but</font>

let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going down in</font>

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,230
November as we spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time</font>

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,390
focusing on beverages on monday i'm

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,099
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with one those the</font>

13
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">twinings orange cinnamon and mango tea</font>

14
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,910
now you might remember from Monday that

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,470
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly obsessed with his orange</font>

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,210
and cinnamon tea and tried to find an

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,340
adequate replacement of some sort just

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,050
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tide me over while I waited</font>

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">for Katie to get back from Christmas I</font>

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,050
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting to find something</font>

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the same but I wasn't expecting</font>

22
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,129
to find something terrible either twangs

23
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,230
orange mango and cinnamon tea<font color="#E5E5E5"> tastes</font>

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,480
like weird juicy water I completely

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,270
dislike my whole experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,710
drinking it and it made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me really sad</font>

27
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,719
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she doesn't normally make me sad</font>

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,460
tea makes me happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the fact that he</font>

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,680
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sad very sad oh yeah I'm not</font>

30
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">master fan of twenties anyway just</font>

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,199
because they don't generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,210
cheese I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pocker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he picks make</font>

33
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,610
my favorite teas also going down this

34
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,680
time of year being the time of year when

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,510
everyone announces that the prices are

36
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,460
going up that was the big humor about

37
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,110
the energy bills but then there's also

38
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,900
phone bills internet bills tend to go up

39
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,580
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's just by</font>

40
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,650
two pounds if every single one of your

41
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,330
providers is knocking things up by two

42
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,220
or three pounds it drives me absolutely

43
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,350
crazy because it adds up to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> extra 10</font>

44
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,330
or 15 pounds a week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an extra</font>

45
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,280
week of food that I could be spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,189
food or alcohol or a book I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

47
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,020
it's particularly frustrating for things

48
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,240
like travel because I need it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,979
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to get around and I made the</font>

50
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,170
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not drive so that I would</font>

51
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,630
save money but then yeah publishers book

52
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,399

53
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,500
are already tight as it is so yeah
