1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:02,644
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE WE GO.

2
00:00:02,645 --> 00:00:04,046
>> President Trump: I JUST WANT

3
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,380
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

4
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,316
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO WILL

5
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:08,617
BE BACK PROBABLY LATE TONIGHT

6
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:09,918
OR EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.

7
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,020
HE WENT TO TURKEY, HE WENT ALL

8
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:12,321
OVER.

9
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:14,823
BUT HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH

10
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,325
THE CROWN PRINCE AND HE IS

11
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:20,195
GOING TO HAVE A FULL REPORT.

12
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:21,930
I'M NOT GIVING COVER AT ALL.

13
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,332
WITH THAT SAID SAUDI ARABIA HAS

14
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,633
BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT ALLY OF

15
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,502
OURS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

16
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:29,838
WE ARE STOPPING IRAN -- WE'RE

17
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,439
STOPPING IRAN.

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,141
WE WENT A BIG STEP WHEN WE TOOK

19
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,711
AWAY THE RIDICULOUS DEAL MADE

20
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:40,782
BY THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION,

21
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:42,217
THE IRAN DEAL, $150 BILLION,

22
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:43,151
1.8 BILLION IN CASH.

23
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,887
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

24
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:46,421
THEY'RE AN ALLY AND WE HAVE

25
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,589
OTHER GOOD ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE

26
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,890
EAST.

27
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,126
IF YOU LOOK AT SAUDI ARABIA

28
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:52,527
THEY'RE AN ALLY, TREMENDOUS

29
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:54,363
PURCHASERS OF NOT ONLY MILITARY

30
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,597
EQUIPMENT BUT OTHER THINGS.

31
00:00:55,598 --> 00:01:00,002
WHEN I WENT THERE THEY

32
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,637
COMMITTED TO PURCHASE 450

33
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:03,839
BILLION WORTH OF THING AND $110

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,173
BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY.

35
00:01:05,174 --> 00:01:06,575
THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST ORDERS IN

36
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,843
THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY,

37
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,611
PROBABLY THE HISTORY OF THE

38
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:09,912
WORLD.

39
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,681
I DON'T THINK THERE HAS EVER

40
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:13,849
BEEN EVER ORDER FOR $450

41
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,182
BILLION.

42
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:15,984
YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY IN SAUDI

43
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:17,152
ARABIA WHERE THAT COMMITMENT

44
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:17,853
WAS MADE.

45
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,021
THEY ARE AN IMPORTANT ALLY BUT

46
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:21,657
I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

47
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:23,058
HAPPENED, WHERE IS THE FAULT,

48
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,226
AND WE WILL PROBABLY KNOW THAT

49
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:26,695
BY TEND OF THE WEEK.

50
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:27,963
MIKE POMPEO IS COMING BACK AND

51
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:30,532
WE'LL HAVE A LONG TALK.

52
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,934
>> ACROSS THE RIVER IN

53
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:33,802
VIRGINIA, WHY NOT SEND THE

54
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,003
F.B.I. IN TO FIGURE ALL THIS

55
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:35,704
OUT?

56
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,039
>> HE WASN'T A CITIZEN OF THIS

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,507
COUNTRY FOR ONE THING.

58
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:39,074
WE'LL DETERMINE THAT.

59
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,275
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

60
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:41,877
WE HAVE, DO YOU?

61
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:43,779
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

62
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,314
WE'VE SENT THE F.B.I.?

63
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:48,984
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.

64
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,720
WHY WOULD I TELL YOU?

65
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,624
>> YOU ASKED FOR THIS AUDIO,

66
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,392
VIDEO INTELLIGENCE?

67
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,494
>> President Trump: WE HAVE

68
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,863
ASKED FOR IT IF IT EXISTS.

69
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,298
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THEY

70
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,666
HAVEN'T SENT IT OVER?

71
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:07,035
>> I'M NOT SURE IT EXISTS,

72
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:07,502
POSSIBLY DOES.

73
00:02:07,503 --> 00:00:00,000
I'LL HAVE A FULL REPORT ON MIKE
