what is this war never changes you know
it is not it does not change in the year
1945 my great-great-grandfather serving
in the army
wondered when he'd get to go home to his
wife and the son he'd never seen he got
his wish when the u.s. ended world war 2
by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki the world awaited
Armageddon instead something miraculous
happened we began to use atomic energy
not as a weapon but as a nearly
limitless source of power people enjoyed
luxuries once thought the realm of
science fiction domestic robots fusion
powered cars portable computers but then
in the 21st century
no people awoke from the American dream
years of consumption led to shortages of
every major resource
the entire world unraveled
peace became a distant memory
it is now the Year 2077
we stand on the brink of total war
I'm afraid
for myself for my wife
for my infant son

realized something so basically guys if
you guys didn't know
so these underground vaults were created
to keep a small percentage of the
population safe from the nuclear war but
instead of doing that they put aside
some these vaults for certain
experiments and it seems ladies and
gentlemen that this experiment was to
freeze the people in the vault and see
how they would survive I don't even know
how long it's been
why would they do this up the bloody
liquor sheds I can't believe they froze
us I can't believe that part they killed
my wife and where did they take my son
or shared oh my goodness what is this oh
