HEARING, WHERE DOES THE

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,573
BURDEN OF EVIDENCE LIE?

7
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,109
DOES IT EVEN MATTER IN THIS

8
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:13,476
CASE?

9
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:14,611
BRIAN: HERE TO WEIGH IN FOX

10
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,480
NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANNE

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,314
ANALYST JUDGE ANDREW

12
00:00:18,314 --> 00:00:18,715
NAPOLITANO.

13
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:19,582
WHAT CHANGES AFTER THAT

14
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:20,684
INTERVIEW LAST NIGHT?

15
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:21,718
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT

16
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:23,753
ANYTHING CHANGES AFTER THE

17
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:24,754
INTERVIEW, BRIAN.

18
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:26,022
IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING

19
00:00:26,022 --> 00:00:26,389
QUESTION.

20
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:27,891
I THINK HE WOULD LIKE TO

21
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,693
HAVE SAID A LOT MORE BUT HE

22
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:34,631
WAS EXCEPTIONALLY SELF

23
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:35,766
RESTRAINED AND SAID TWO

24
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,933
THINGS TO MARTHA I KNOW

25
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:37,868
NOTHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I

26
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,669
HAVE NEVER DONE THIS IN MY

27
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:41,004
LIFE TO ANYONE AND SECOND, I

28
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,373
WANT THE PROCESS TO BE FAIR.

29
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:46,143
SHE ASKED UNBELIEVABLY

30
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:47,844
SUPERB AND DIRECT AND

31
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:48,378
THOROUGH QUESTIONS.

32
00:00:48,378 --> 00:00:49,613
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD

33
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:52,883
PREPARED HIM NOT TO GO THERE

34
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,551
IS THIS BECAUSE OF ROE V.

35
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:54,851
WADE?

36
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,553
OF COURSE IT'S BECAUSE OF

37
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:56,954
ROE V. WADE.

38
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:58,989
>> OF COURSE IT'S BECAUSE OF

39
00:00:58,989 --> 00:00:59,389
ROE V. WADE.

40
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:00,490
IS IT BECAUSE YOU ARE

41
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:00,857
CATHOLIC?

42
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,025
OF COURSE IT IS BECAUSE IS

43
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:02,492
HE CATHOLIC.

44
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:03,594
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GO THERE

45
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:06,296
BECAUSE IT OPENS UP A CAN OF

46
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:06,663
WORMINGS.

47
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:07,698
WHERE IS THE BURDEN OF

48
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:07,998
PROOF?

49
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:08,765
THERE IS NO BURDEN OF PROOF.

50
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:09,866
THERE IS NO RULES HERE.

51
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:10,901
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

52
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:11,268
HAPPENED.

53
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:14,037
WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT IS THE

54
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,274
IMPRESSION AMONGST THE

55
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,743
AMERICAN PUBLIC AT 5:00 P.M.

56
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:20,344
ON THURSDAY.

57
00:01:20,344 --> 00:01:21,845
IS THERE IMPRESSION SHE IS

58
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:24,281
MORE CREDIBLE OR IS THERE

59
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:24,848
IMPRESSION HE IS MORE

60
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:25,215
CREDIBLE.

61
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,116
THAT'S WHAT WILL DECIDE.

62
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:28,452
THIS LOOKING AT FIVE

63
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:29,887
SENATORS, FIVE REPUBLICANS,

64
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,489
CORKER, FLAKE, MURKOWSKI,

65
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,125
COLLINS AND CAPITO.

66
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,127
THE HUMAN BEINGS WHO THIS IS

67
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:37,461
AIMED.

68
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:38,896
APPEAR AN YOU ARE SAYING

69
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:39,963
CAPITO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A

70
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:41,598
GIFT TO PRO-LIFE

71
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:42,399
EVANGELICALS BUT IT'S

72
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,100
ANYTHING BUT.

73
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,634
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

74
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:44,868
>> I THINK THAT UNTIL TWO

75
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,503
WEEKS AGO THE EVANGELICAL

76
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:47,638
BASE SUPPORTS THE PRESIDENT

77
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:52,509
VERY, VERY STRONGLY FELT

78
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,844
THEY HAD BEEN REWARDED BY

79
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:56,046
HAVING ONE OF THEIR OWN

80
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,481
CATHOLIC, CONSERVATIVE,

81
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:57,948
TRADITIONALIST.

82
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:59,817
NOW, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS

83
00:01:59,817 --> 00:02:01,185
NOMINATION MIGHT BE IN

84
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:02,953
TROUBLE.

85
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:04,488
NOW, THE REACTION TO THAT

86
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,789
COULD BE WHAT YOU GUYS WERE

87
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:06,824
JUST TALKING ABOUT IN THE

88
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:07,992
LAST SEGMENT THAT

89
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,793
REPUBLICANS COME OUT IN

90
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:11,562
DROVES TO EXPRESS THEIR

91
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:12,930
ANGER SO THAT WOULD BE A

92
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,498
BENEFIT TO THE PRESIDENT.

93
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,900
BUT IF THE REPUBLICANS THINK

94
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,601
IF THE REPUBLICAN BASE

95
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:18,435
THINKS THAT THE

96
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,037
CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IN

97
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,305
THE WHITE HOUSE COULDN'T

98
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,940
MANAGE A NOMINATION AS SAFE

99
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,478
AS THIS, THEY MIGHT STAY

100
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:29,280
HOME I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY

101
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,214
IT WILL GOVERNMENTAL WE WILL

102
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,049

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,652
ON THURSDAY:  PERHAPS

104
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,619

00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:38,689
CONGRESS A LETTER SAYING

108
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:39,490
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, I

109
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,925
THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE

110
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,793
A FAIR PRESENTATION OF MY

111
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,728
SIDE AND, YET, YOU

112
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,664
APPARENTLY ARE GOING TO HIRE

113
00:02:46,664 --> 00:02:48,265
A SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR TO

114
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:49,233
ASK THE QUESTIONS.

115
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,901
AND MITCH MCCONNELL MADE

116
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:56,641

00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:58,009
THE SENATE.

119
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,277
MAYBE SOME ARE SURMISE SHE

120
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,612
GO IS NOT GOING TO SHOW.

121
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:02,913
>> IF SHE DOESN'T SHOW THIS

122
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:04,181
HAS TO BE OVER WITH HE

123
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:04,982
CANNOT ANSWER AN ALLEGATION

124
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,218
THAT IS NOT CREDIBLY MADE.

125
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:08,919
AND RIGHT NOW THE ANSWERS HE

126
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,922

THAT DOESN'T CUT THE MUSTARD

134
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:22,266
F SHE HAS ALLEGATIONS OF

135
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,801
THIS MAGNITUDE, SHE HAS TO

136
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,570
STATE THEM UNDER OATH.

143
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,877
DISCREDITED BY NOW?

148
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:38,983
WILL HAPPEN.
