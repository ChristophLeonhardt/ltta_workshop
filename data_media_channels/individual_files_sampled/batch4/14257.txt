hey music fans since it's 2018 this just happens to be the 35th anniversary of the debut of what I and presumably millions of others consider to be the worst pop song ever recorded in the history of people kind hint it's about robots I think how time flies 35 years ago I still vividly remember turning on MuchMusic Canada's ripoff version of MTV and seeing the music video for something called mr. Roboto by Styx now if mr. Roboto were a vehicle it would be the Chevy Chevette if it were a football team it would be the Cleveland Browns you get where I'm going here and then the event it was 1983 the New York Islanders were on route to winning their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup the other Trudeau was Prime Minister and Nintendo had just released the Mario Brothers video game a different world to be sure but nothing could have prepared me for what was about to be conveyed via my humongous 26 inch Zenith TV for when mr. Roboto blasted onto the screen I watched with a mixture of fascination bewilderment and well frankly horror oh just where does one begin the autopsy well for starters let it be said that any hack can record a bad song but to record something that is cosmically awful something that even lives on decades later as a pop-culture punchline well folks that requires a huge measure of talent now in fairness the tune does have a catchy beat even most mr. Roboto haters must concede that point eradicate the lyrics and you've got something that would play well for an aerobics class I should think but alas it comes down to those lyrics doesn't it line such as I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin my heart is human my blood is boiling my brain IBM what the hell I will say this however on the plus side thanks to mr. Roboto the english-speaking world at least now knows how to say thank you in Japanese the other thing about mr. Roboto is that this was no novelty song it was never meant to be a goof by the band it was supposedly to be taken earnestly and sincerely kind of like 2001 a Space Odyssey yes it was meant to be artsy and it reads so very high to make some sort of profound statement regarding technology and humanity only to fail so spectacularly Hey I guess the Ford Pinto kind of look good on paper too I suppose and let it be said it certainly didn't help matters that although the band clearly blew some big bucks on this video it remains a mystery why they decided to source those goofy robot masts from the local dollar store yet another factor that contributes to the legend of mr. Roboto is that it wasn't recorded by some flash-in-the-pan one-hit wonder band rather Styx was responsible for this song yeah the same Styx that recorded come sail away and babe and the best of times these very same musicians were responsible for this musical practical joke of cosmic proportions this worst of times if you will finally there is the song's ending it might just be the most jarring pop music conclusion of all time and for whatever reason it uh nervous me to this day um I think he's trying to say I'm Kilroy still in the final analysis if you're going to be bad you may as well be brutally mind-numbing wickedly cosmically bad not just mediocre bad and although mr. Roboto had a close call when it came to relinquishing its crown in 1985 as worst pop song ever thanks to the release of starships we built this city this tune has managed to take on and defeat all crummy comers when it comes to being the most craptacular of them all domo arigato mr. Roboto indeed for the rebel media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
