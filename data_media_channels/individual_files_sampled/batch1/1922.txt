this was Kim Jong Un's first meeting with a senior Russian diplomat since coming to power another first in a diplomatic dance of increasing complexity Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov invited Kim to add to his busy summit schedule and visit Moscow but it was lavrov's apparent support for Kim's position in readiness for his summit with US president Donald Trump that will be the most welcomed outcome for North Korea Lavrov said North Korea must get relief from sanctions and quickly it is absolutely obvious that starting any discussion of the nuclear problem and all other programs on the Korean Peninsula they cannot be complete without repealing all sanctions on North Korea how that will go ahead will be a question of the skill of the negotiators but it cannot be done in one sitting US officials based in Seoul have been in near daily discussions with their North Korean counterparts at the truce village of Panmunjeom that's in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas how much progress has been made isn't known all whether North Korea's stated commitment to denuclearization comes with a specific timetable and a process for verification that's acceptable to the US I think North Korea wants to stretch this process of democratization for as long as possible they are very I can now imagine them agreeing to a near-term timetable or deadline to completely dismantle their nuclear weapons but sensing a possible historic breakthrough Russia doesn't want to be left on the sidelines just as Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with Kim the Russians want to exert the kind of influence they feel they deserve
