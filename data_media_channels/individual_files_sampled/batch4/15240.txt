and update again another update ah we are on over 140,000 signatures for our petition this petition will be compared handed in to the army and 10 Downing Street a game what I found out today I found out that one member of our armed forces somewhere was convicted for selling crack cocaine he was found with tens of thousands of pounds with a crack cocaine dealing okay he did not lose his job he'd been given a second chance I found out on another barracks there are two people who have been convicted of sexual offenses against minors two they did not lose their jobs so in the British Army what we're saying is you can sexually assault women sexually assault cheap children you can sell drugs but if you have a photograph with a journalist because that journalist talks about Islam you will be discharged from the army and I'm sorry but that is not that is not right and people are not going to allow that and what you're going to see now which you've seen because I've traveled down to and spent time today I was supposed to being watched out today meeting a father of a young girl who's been who was sexually exploited as part of these grooming gangs and I suppose for having a median and then this has sprung up so I'll put that meeting off him and I'm nearly there now okay because I had to travel to another end of the country I'm nearly there now now if I had time I could have visited four or five barracks today because soldiers are contacting me from every barracks across this country okay now this can be the fine that they say that the army cannot be politicized well stay fully rainbow flags off the top of a lot of army barracks okay what they've done to the what they done with the fire brigade and the fire service I spoke to so many soldiers today who said the only way you get promoted is if you're a mixed race lesbian this and that those DS DS diversity programs that are being enforced on them and basically you're more likely you're more likely to get sacked and kicked out of the army because of though if you had a problem with diversity then you are if you fiddled with a child what is going on what is going on how come again the priority given the priority given to if you talk out against an ideology if you talk out against Islam that's what this is about it's about these it's about the forced common purpose there's been spread from every institution of Britain but now you've tried it with the Armed Forces and I hope now you're gonna have a reverb in the Armed Forces and that's not what I want that's not why I wonder what I've most shocked me over the last two days it's finding out how low the marau is in our armed forces it's at the bottom they are all fed up they fill up their undermanned they're understaffed they're treated like dirt they're not rewarded they're not respected and then you try and destroy one of their lives at the age of 17 and ruin his career because here's a photo of a journalist so I'm traveling I'm traveling or even oh I'm going back tonight from up north because I've got a flight to catch in the morning I'm traveling everywhere and on me and I'm meeting our on for our armed service man and the ones I met today him on their faces shown what wasn't bothered about having their faces shown they didn't care they said they can't discharge us all it is literally I am Spartacus okay they can't discharge everyone I've been contacted and and the minute I'm making the conscious choice against what they want to cover faces and I'm making that just until there's enough footage until I've got hundreds and hundreds of serving soldiers who are saying I am soldier X I am soldier eggs you think you're going to throw him under the bus because of the Muslim Council of Britain the Muslim Council of Britain who signed the Declaration to say that our Royal Navy affair targets for jihad that's who you're bowing to that's who the superiors within the army are bowing to is it I've got I've got a recording here of a major in the army telling them you need to unfollow Tommy Robinson you need to unfollow him if not you need to get out the door what before our soldiers are signed enough to give people freedom but take freedom away it's gone insane and what at what point are you not just the people in the army well what point are people going to stand together and say enough is enough I've also hired some of some very encouraging messages as well because morale has been blocked bomb but then I had another a wife of a soldier sent me a message saying in their whatsapp group of over a hundred members morale morale in in their forces have not been as high as it is now because they finally see some things about happened and that and I say that we say soldier eggs so soldier X about this young seventeen year old boy can become so much more that symbol can come so much more for all the wrongs that have the haze happening to our armed services to give them a voice that they haven't got to undo the wrongs that are happening they if you look at them that our last military adverts took for recruitment I think they got 10% of the of what they needed to get in figures because it was all about praying on the floor or in a bow and respect in Islam whilst bulks world's men quoting the Koran or blowing you up that's what you're meant to do unbelievable and then there's got video saying it's okay to cry in the army it's okay to be gay in the army but it's not okay to be a straight young English or British well skies for Northern Irish straight male that's not okay cuz you'll be left right at the bottom you'll be kicked out of the way why everyone else progresses up to the higher ranks and when they get to their higher ranks and all they'll do they'll kick your Lisle away in sacrifice' the minute you step out allowing the say one single negative word about religion there in force him blasphemy within our fucking armed forces so anyway I am running because I'm just speaking to so many people and it is sucking what they are doing what this government are doing and in Britain and in Britain within our military if they've already done all our free institutions the NHS is done the the the ER the fire brigade it's all been weakened everyone will tell you that who's been in those in those are in those jobs they'll all tell you it and now they want to do it to the army the army the Navy that's what they want and it's about time people stood up so if you are serving in our country and not just serving our country if you're old if you're young whoever you are I am soldier eggs get involved in that campaign show you the size of the campaign show the size of the support as I said we're 140,000 signatures on our on our data on our on our own on our petition but they've been blocking the site you have to come off of your Wi-Fi because it's been blocked say that out loud we're holding a petition for a young man who has been booted from the net from from the Army for having
