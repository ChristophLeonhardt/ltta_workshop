00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:03,047
TAPES, HOW DO WE STOP HER FROM RELEASING THEM?

78
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,350

>> THEY COULD TRY TO GET A TRO PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.

80
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,688

81
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,922
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. >> WHICH ISN’T HARD TO GET.

84
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,260
SHOW YOU’RE GOING TO WIN ON THE MERITS AND THERE’S A HARM.

85
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,862
MERITS AND THERE’S A HARM. I HAVEN’T DONE ONE, BUT THIS IS

86
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,630
I HAVEN’T DONE ONE, BUT THIS IS GOING BACK TO LAW SCHOOL.

87
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:20,031
GOING BACK TO LAW SCHOOL. >> RIGHT.

88
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,965
>> RIGHT. >> AND YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE

89
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:23,201
>> AND YOUR ARGUMENT WOULD BE THAT SHE MAY HAVE TAPES

90
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,369
THAT SHE MAY HAVE TAPES INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY.

91
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,137
INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY. SHE ALLEGEDLY RECORDED SOMETHING

92
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,838
SHE ALLEGEDLY RECORDED SOMETHING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

93
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,075
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. SO YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT

94
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,510
SO YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE HAS

95
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,745
THAT, YOU KNOW, SHE HAS INFORMATION THAT IS NATIONAL

96
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,581
INFORMATION THAT IS NATIONAL SECURITY, EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE,

97
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,451
SECURITY, EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

98
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,853
AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DISCLOSE THAT TO THE PUBLIC.

99
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:42,887
DISCLOSE THAT TO THE PUBLIC. THAT’S A TOUGH ROAD.

100
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,155
THAT’S A TOUGH ROAD. >> THIS IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

101
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,090
>> THIS IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THAT IS SUING AS OPPOSED TO THE

102
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,791
THAT IS SUING AS OPPOSED TO THE ADMINISTRATION, SO THERE’S --

103
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,992
ADMINISTRATION, SO THERE’S -- >> BECAUSE SHE DIDN’T SIGN --

104
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:48,960
>> BECAUSE SHE DIDN’T SIGN -- WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING THE WHITE

105
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,595
WHEN SHE WAS LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE, THE REASON SHE COULDN’T

106
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,430
HOUSE, THE REASON SHE COULDN’T GET HER PERSONAL BELONGINGS BACK

107
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:53,965
GET HER PERSONAL BELONGINGS BACK BECAUSE SHE WOULDN’T SIGN THAT

108
00:02:53,976 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN’T SIGN THAT AGREEMENT WHEN SHE LEFT.
