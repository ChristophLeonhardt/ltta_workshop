this is someone who worked at that Trump digital firm Cambridge analytic uh until three weeks ago Brittany Kaiser a top exec there she had a key to Steve bannon's town house in Washington this so called Breitbart embassy she spoke at CPAC in 2016 along with Kellyanne Conway spent election night at the Trump victory party with mega donor Rebecca Mercer she also just left Cambridge she also worked for Barack Obama she's pretty interesting and this is her first TV interview anywhere in the world I spoke to her from Bangkok Thailand beginning with her thoughts on Facebook did you know that Cambridge had the length of data we're now learning I was copied into the information that we gave to Facebook which in January 2016 our chief data officer said we deleted the data sets that we were asked to delete now I find it incredibly irresponsible of Facebook that they did not send anybody to come and check that seems like a very simple piece of due diligence for a company that until last week was worth 500 billion dollars you think they didn't care I think that the data policy has been only exploitative and incredibly irresponsible irresponsible that's how she put what Cambridge has done with Facebook's lacks approach we also spoke and this is important about what this digital firm that work for Trump did with the data and whether any of this could be bound up in the big question of Russian meddling Facebook gave probably thousands of different companies access to this data we were only asked in December 2015 about seven months later if we still possess that data and were asked to delete it in January 2016 I guarantee you that Cambridge analytic Oh was probably one of thousands of companies that still possess that data much longer than we should have is it possible that Cambridge or other data firms that had more of an American expertise might have somehow been helped used or interacted with the Russian operation anybody in the world can purchase and license the data of individuals in America you don't have to be an American company you don't have to be working for a political campaign and that means that individuals and their data sets are exploited and they can be exploited by anyone without the help of an American firm hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
