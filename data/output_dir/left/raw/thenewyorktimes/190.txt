1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,090
For the past year, the special
counsel, Robert S. Mueller III,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,580
has been examining
two chief questions:

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,850
ties between Donald Trump’s
campaign and Russia,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,710
and whether Trump,
as president, has tried to

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,930
obstruct that investigation.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,770
I don’t know if I can explain
it as well as I did before.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,790
Like, the special —
the special counsel is this,

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,780
you know —

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,280
Robert Mueller will likely
reach one of two conclusions

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,100
about the president.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,680
Either there is evidence
he broke the law

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,840
or not.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,610
If Mueller has evidence that
the president broke the law,

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,770
he has a series of decisions to
make about how to move forward.

15
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,180
The least aggressive
of them

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,160
would be to try and write
a report that he would

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,700
hope would end up
in Congress.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,340
Mueller could take a more
aggressive measure,

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,160
which the special counsel
did during Nixon,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,350
and make the president
an unindicted co-conspirator

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,590
in court documents.

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,830
The most aggressive option
would be for Mueller

23
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,450
to try and indict the president.

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,370
But there are many obstacles
to that,

25
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,250
particularly a longstanding
Justice Department policy

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,450
that says the president
cannot be indicted.

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,780
Mueller cannot make any of
these decisions on his own.

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,850
It all has to go
through the gatekeeper,

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,490
in this case, the
deputy attorney general,

30
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,100
Rod Rosenstein.

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,130
If Mueller tries to indict
someone like the president,

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,160
and the deputy attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein,

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,390
says no,

34
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,630
it automatically triggers
a report to Congress —

35
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,190
a way of sort of
giving the process

36
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,600
additional sunlight
and oversight.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,550
Rosenstein would have
to explain to Congress

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,140
why he didn’t want to go along
with what Mueller wanted to do.

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,740
Some experts believe that
Mueller may try

40
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,840
and indict Trump just to ensure
that it triggers

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,540
a report to Congress.

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,390
If Republicans
control the House,

43
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,450
they are not likely
to do anything

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,150
with information from Mueller
unless it is really damning.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,960
If Democrats win control
of the House in the fall,

46
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
regardless of what
Mueller finds

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,820
there will be immense 
political pressure on them

48
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,620
to do something.

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,010
And if they get a report
from the Justice Department,

50
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,620
they will likely, certainly, take
impeachment seriously,

51
00:02:29,620 --> 00:00:00,000
if not begin an impeachment
process against the president.
