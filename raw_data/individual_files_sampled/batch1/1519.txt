one of the many problems in a city on the siege is how to dispose of its rubbish it's a Dell halil's job to help collect it using a donkey and cart the blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt means there were a few refuse trucks and fuels expensive surely there is no other country in the world using donkeys to collect rubbish if we had proper vehicles and enough fuel it would be faster and make our work much easier the Gaza Strip time to about two million people and it's almost entirely built up the city's waste is loaded in trucks and taken here to a giant open dump it's one of three all of them close to people's homes it's enormous it just goes on and on and it stinks it's hard not to gag standing here just a few hundred meters in this direction is the separation wall built by Israel around Gaza about a kilometer over here is the edge of the city so there's just no other space the municipal waste manager told us the dump emits noxious gases and liquids and so it's a public health hazard the authorities struggle to import machinery needed for processing or recycling because Israel restricts the import of anything it says could be used to make weapons it is known all over the world that at least some of the rubbish should be recycled but in Gaza we cannot recycle anything we don't have any factories that could reuse the plastic or steel so the only way to deal with it is to dump it here but with more than 40 percent unemployment is a living to be made here - these men search for whatever they can sell none of them agreed to an interview they told us they're ashamed to be seen here the city produces nearly 2,000 tons of waste every day this site will be full in about two years and as long as the seed lasts gauss's dumps and it's rubbish problem will only get bigger Malcolm Webb al-jazeera in the Gaza Strip
