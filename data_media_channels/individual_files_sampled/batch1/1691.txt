some have called this region lawless and a hotbed of terrorism for the past 70 years later or the federally administered tribal areas border Afghanistan unlike Pakistan czar the provinces Fatah are under the direct control of government leaders in Islamabad through a series of political officers in reality however the region is difficult to control and has very little real governance pata was declared a region during the British colonial occupation of India British troops found the area unruly and struck a deal with the local tribes to make a buffer zone between British India and Afghanistan Pakistan formalized that system after the creation of the country in 1947 platter became a safe haven for Mujahideen fighters during the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s it was also a sanctuary for armed groups such as al-qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban during the so-called US war on terror now leaders in Islamabad when Fatah to become a formal part of Pakistan by merging it with the province of hiber Parkton ha also known as kpk the federal cabinet has approved a parliamentary vote on the draft constitutional amendment bill the National Assembly is expected to vote on it on Thursday most welcomed the merger saying is long overdue others say fattest people must have a say well it's very unfortunate it's done in a haste without consulting the people apart it is a strange democracy in the country they do not give the basic democratic right to the people of farter to decide for themselves whether they want to merge or they want to have a province to themselves this decision is made for them by others Outsiders or father thoughts or government forces have been at war for the past decade with armed groups including the Pakistani Taliban which is waged in nationwide suicide bombing campaign some security analysts questioned whether the time is right for the merger and if it will stop the region from becoming a sanctuary for gunmen even though it is being done in haste and they are issues because the security situation is very tenuous in Fatah already the military is there and we are hearing that the level of conflict and level of violence that had gone down and attacks that had gone down are picking up again so we can see that the militants that had been displaced are regrouping again other Pakistani czar concern that the merger will falter because of shortfalls in the KP case budget as well as opposition from within Fatah itself some tribal leaders would rather Fattah was declared a province instead of being merged the KPK Imran Khan al-jazeera
