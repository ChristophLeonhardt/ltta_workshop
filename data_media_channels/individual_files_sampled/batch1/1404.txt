hi Emily kabila and you're in the stream today deadly protests along the border of Gaza and Israel and Palestine poetry of resistance will talk to Palestinian poets about creative forms of protest first we go to our correspondent haveta Meade who was in huzza city she's been covering the protests along the border of Israel and Gaza and you at home can join our conversation via Twitter at AJ stream or through our YouTube chat room heard that welcome to the stream Israeli forces have killed at least 52 palestinians that's the the latest death toll those protesting and fahza along the border they fired live ammunition tear gas fire bombs what was it like witnessing the events of today it was actually surreal if I may use that word simply though because we were standing there looking at the protesters yes the Israelis had warned that they will have a zero tolerance warning people to keep away from the border fence but they really started shooting very early in the morning even when there were many protesters and they were just burning tires not very far from the fence yes but they were not trying to reach that fence and then throughout the day we just so one ambulance after the other it was a continuous stream we even at a certain point moved away from the border fence and went to one of these first eight tents and it was relentless for the medical staff there and now they have these tents as we stood to sort of make a triage of you know the injured we need to go to the hospital because they're in bad conditions one those who can be treated on the spot simply because the medical system here in Gaza is crumbling too few weeks ago it had already declared a state of emergency so it was tough difficult the youth were their defiant resilient and you know you would look at them some of them were so young and you could see in their face that you know this fear their fearlessness the fact that it didn't mind if they were gonna get wounded or if they were gonna die was just a sign of how desperate they were they are mm-hmm I pulled up this suite here that we got from a former stream gasps this is a Hallmark card I am who says hearing updates while we are on our way to donate blood it's surreal I feel numb so many people killed and injured here today you can smell death in the air the streets are empty and Gaza is sad or the can you relate to what Homer is writing here in his tweet yes absolutely it was very sad especially when you go to these medical tents and I've been I covered the protest at the beginning the first two weeks and when he went to the hospital I mean it was a lot to take him as well sometimes it felt like someone had just punched you in the stomach all these young people maimed some of them had their leg amputated simply because they are in Gaza if they were somewhere else they could have gotten the treatment they wanted if it wasn't that they were in Gaza and things were so complicated they might have been able to travel to Egypt or to the occupied West Bank to get treatment there but they are in Gaza and they have no way out and I remember very well one doctor talking to me and he was very emotionally was containing his tears and he said sometimes I feel helpless these people should not be suffering so much because the degree of injury they have is yes very serious but it could be treated if Gaza was a normal place but and then he said but this is not a normal place and he was really struggling it up he did not know what to do mm-hmm I want to share a visual example of that juxtaposition that you're talking about that it this is because these people are in the class and if they were someplace else they might have been able to get more help this is Patrick Gailey who an AFP photographer and he shares two photos from the AFP posted today May 14th left Jerusalem right Icaza pictures taken at the same time this afternoon and on the right hand side you see protesters one passed out and people carrying him in Gaza on the left hand side you see the the daughter of President Trump Ivanka Trump standing next to Steve minuchin at the official opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem both of these taken at the same time were protesters they're aware what was going on in Jerusalem and what said the connection between those two events well certainly today's protest was called to coincide with the opening of the US Embassy in Jerusalem the protesters were not following what was going on in Jerusalem they they probably didn't see the you know hear the speeches and seen the grand competence of the inauguration but they were angry at it very much anyone you ask will tell you I'm here because of that US Embassy Jerusalem is our capital of a future Palestinian state that is ask any Palestinian they would tell you that whether they're in Gaza or in the occupied West Bank or indeed in Jerusalem and even those living inside their Israeli inside Israel so everybody was aware of the fact that this was happening but no one could was seeing or watching television or you know listening to what was unfolding over there asked journalists we were you know me and Stephanie Decker my colleague we both had the odor return at least of what was happening in Jerusalem and I have to say that we discussed it nature this evening and Stephanie even reported on that it was very difficult to take in because on one hand in one year we were listening all these speeches that we heard the I think it was the American ambassador saying that this was a great opportunity for peace you know we heard all these remarks and then on the other side we were watching young people being shot at I mean they were throwing stones they were burning tires they were flying cats type some of them had petrol bombs but at no point if any was any soldier in danger even those who managed to reach the fence and when they're disgusted to breach it when they come back they tell you we know we can't get further but that just doing that for them symbolizes as you know and momentarily sense of freedom that's actually was how one young boy a teenager 15 year old put it for me so it was quite surreal and you could see this is such a divided part of the world and with every day that passes you just don't know how they will ever come together if that will ever happen and then you know there's a rhetoric coming out that this is all organized by Hamas that the 2 million gallons are basically all terrorists this is completely dehumanizing all these people are completely brushing aside the fact that you have at least two generations who have grown up under a blockade who have seen nothing else but Gaza since they were born and don't know when they will see anything else but you have more than half of the youth even the university graduates who are completely unemployed with no chance of getting a job that you have people who actually have sold already all their furniture at home and have nothing more to feed their children right that is what is happening at the border it is no Hamas you hear a lot of people complaining about Hamas that's not what's pushing them to the border Hamas yet has this rhetoric I must yes has its own agenda but Gazans by and large are fed up with all political faction at this stage right I want to end with this street here from Massey who says the US administration must take responsibility for the killings the US government has been acting as a mediator between Palestinians and Israelis McDonald Trump administration jeopardising is jeopardizing the peace process the whole world should condemn Israeli aggression and standard Palestine just one view from our community we're going to let you go how to stay safe we'll continue to follow this story from on the ground thank you for being with us so what can a poet express about the plight of Palestinians Palestinian poets have long used their creative skills to highlight experiences of dispossession exile living under occupation and the resilience of their people today we'll hear more about the role poetry plays in Palestinian resistance with us are three poets in London Rafi Giada and poet human rights activists and third-generation Palestinian refugee she's released two albums of spoken word poetry titled we teach life and Hadean in Columbia Missouri if T sound but account in addition to writing poetry she is the author of two award-winning memoirs about growing up in Palestine tasting the sky at Palestinian childhood and balcony on the moon coming of age in Palestine and in Atlanta Georgia mohammed el Kurd he has a university student and poet from occupied East Jerusalem welcome to the stream everyone if I want to start with you you heard what Hoda had to say at the top of the show as a Palestinian poet who writes about resistance how do you make sense of the resistance and then the reaction that we've seen along the huzza is real border today it's been a really devastating day we've just been watching the death toll rise I think people in God that are so courageously saying enough is enough you deserve to live in freedom we deserve to live in dignity and importantly we deserve to go back home the majority of the population in Gaza as you know are refugees and the point of this march is not just against the siege but it's also just of the right of return that is something very dear to my heart as a third-generation Palestinian refugee something that I speak about quite often I think what today really brought out is the fact that the Palestinian Nakba is ongoing since its inception Israel has been displacing Palestinians and continues to displace them the big question on my mind is what is the international community going to do and how far does Israel have to go today we witness the televised massacre of unarmed civilians being shot at how long does this have to happen before more countries do what South Africa has just done and pulled their ambassadors and before we have military embargoes on Israel mm-hmm I hear what you're saying there if do some I could see you having a really you know a visceral and visible reaction to the scenes that we're seeing that we saw from earlier today and I know that this is difficult for so many of our viewers and of course including our guests who are tied to this issue so intimately what's going through your mind you know there are certain things that cannot be expressed in words they're just so um language hasn't caught up with what the Palestinians go through language hasn't developed enough to express the depth of the lost and the devastation on the inside and what must be said for the Palestinian to communicate to the world and be heard so far we communicate and we're not heard so for me there's um there's the Nakba of course which has been going on for seventy years and one day and that's a geographic and a national political end of a life nook but but there's also an emotional Nakba as well that is happening with all of the palestinians all over the world and we don't have a place to express it poetry is just a tiny oasis where we can express some of that knockabout and have an opportunity here and with tears I'm reminded of my humanity and that I'm alive and I connect with my people who are in Gaza crying right now I doubt it that anyone in Gaza who's not crying hmm yeah of course you mentioned the neckla for our audience that it's not familiar although if you watch out Jazeera you are familiar that is the day that Palestinians referred to as the catastrophe literally and this is wind 7 more than 750,000 Palestinians were forcibly made to flee to do the exodus out of their land against five hundred villages of towns were emptied and massacres were committed in order to force people to flee so like a whole country it's not actually the figure 750,000 this is a very conservative estimate of the United Nations but what happened is an entire country was emptied eventually for Palestine to be removed from the map and Israel to be put on a map a whole people have been displaced a whole country has been destroyed and in this in the before and after what might have happened ethnic cleansing and genocide and destruction I mean how could a country be taken off the map another put on the map you can only imagine what happened in between and you can understand it from what's happening in Gaza right now it's just the same thing people being yes destroyed families destroyed whole cities burned and in my opinion which I really like to communicate to all of my audiences that I cannot see the Palestinian experience in separation from the Holocaust the Palestinian experience happened right after the Holocaust in order to move people outside of Europe and give them a national home basically the Holocaust has moved land it moved language it moved hands but it continues a people we're facing genocide in Europe and now a people facing genocide in Palestine with the same forces play I play actually they are be in the United States and the Jewish people and it's just it changed places and that is the larger perspective I like to communicate because we're part of humanity and often we're separated from here not from humanity like okay this is the problem the Palestinian no this is not the problem of the Palestinian this is the problem of humanity that created a genocide against the Jews and now supports allows and waits for 70 years before something happens they waited for 6 million Jews to die before that and now 70 years and one day the waiting happening and my question is until when the waiting will continue until 1:00 mmm if you sound powerful words I want to share this tweet from Noura Erakat who writes there is a massacre in Gaza today that is its own headline not expect achill to complete your stories on the embassy move in Jerusalem for Palestinians this is all an ongoing Nakba not the end the beginning or the middle of a farcical peace process Mohammed I want to turn to you with that because there's a special significance for you as well you were born on the 50th anniversary of binoculars Allu so now that we are reaching the 70th what significance is this hold for you how are you marking this anniversary every birthday I've had especially today has been a reminder nakba is not yet nostalgic it is not yet an opportunity for reminiscing it's not in a museum it is ongoing and today has reminded me that death in Palestine is constant and instant and it happens like in between breaths I called my family and I asked them just any sec if they were fine and safe but nobody can be safe regardless of where you are in Palestine now I am so moved by the people the courage of the people in Gaza and how resilient and powerful they have been to go about such things and to face such things and to be so confrontational with with that just means how much they are lustful for life nobody would go face to face to death unless they were so close to it already and these people have no resources no freedom they are living in an open-air prison and the only reason they are erupting this uproar is because they yearn for freedom and dignity and human rights and equality and their rate of return we are done being refugees we are done being headlines we are done being statistics but if we if I know that you are a third-generation refugee and I know you also have written a poem about the Wanaka ba I love if you could share your poem with our audience well actually the poem I had in mind for today was more around the events of today because I saw how various mainstream media were reporting and they would just say Palestinians died as if it just happened that the Israeli snipers weren't there doing it clear sky so it's called a place is there a place we can be is there a place we can be more than thunderclaps and hashtags our fears are not Twitter storms our flesh not dissected in comment sections is there a place where we can hold each other in sorrow and silence in defiance before you make a picture funeral to share is there a place where headlines don't hate us or assume we die mysteriously just fall and are never killed intentional by soldiers taking orders intentionally by snipers taking aim intentionally by weapons purchased intentionally by countries that are selling more intentionally they're a place where headlines don't hate us and our life like our laughter is intentional is there a place I don't have to justify that our lives also matter that we also love our children is there a place where the breaking news like breaking waves doesn't just bring more bodies is there a place where we can just be human and return just the place thank you so much sir if that was haunting and beautiful it sparked this comment from Barnaby Jones watching us live on YouTube he says this is very similar to the Irish situation in times of war they turned to art poetry and song to express the pain of being oppressed if t some when we talk about poetry it can seem to psalmist trivial and and not worthy of a discussion in a day like today how do you make sense of those two things and is that the place that you turn to make sense of events like today it's not trivial at all poetry is not trivial this is how the Arabs survived since the beginning of time poetry is the gift of the Arabs since the beginning of time so poetry elevates and also keeps the human being alive generally at times like this that people shut down and when a person shuts down they don't have access to their feeling when they don't have access to their feeling they're closer to death whether they continue to breathe or not they're closer to death when a person continues to breathe through art or through poetry they're closer to life they are more able to respond intelligently on creatively a bird says I can show you since that if you've just read that poem I'll show you a little piece of art that I have that inspires me please do it's actually a war piece of art this is a origami tank it's paper tank origami actually an artist and American artist who went to the war in Iraq creates these tanks and I got this tank and he had like a cannon in it and I put a pencil in it and turned this tank from a piece like a weapon of destruction she a weapon of creativity the cannon now in my mind says I can't go on and the pencil shoots instead of destructive things mushy words that maintain hope so it's more like a bird and instead of nemac avouch it's like ah 60 tonnes on the ground killing the ground this is just a few ounces and it can fly it's so important for me to use my creativity to take the elements of the oppression and turn them in my mind so I can interact with them whether it's poetry where the language that is targeting us excluding us disconnecting us I can give it more life I can nurture it and bring it back to life the language so it expresses me because generally the language is attempting to keep me on the outside the political language aims to keep me on the outside the poetic language constantly brings me home to humanity and the rest of the people but poetry is not enough there this is a catastrophe and and the poem can do some things right I use paper I use art I use painting I use my tears I use relationships I use everything to stay alive because the occupation has one goal it's for us not to remain alive for us to die and disappear and for only for the land remain and the land to be taken when you mention political language versus poet poetic language it reminds me of something I'd like to share with our audience before we go when we speak of resistance people might think of images like today's protests but perhaps another recent case should come to mind as well and that's of Doreen tat or Palestinian poet convicted this month by Israel for inciting violence and supporting what a court called terrorism she published a poem on social media titled resist my people resist and now she's facing up to five years in prison this is what she told the stream sorry Muffy Adelie oh yeah I could not return home in La Caleta : an archer house and picked up the one share Carmela I'm not sure a budget how comfortable enough looked at her I'm not a natural like in a coffee table I did a couple of more academically Murphy I share him Danny Murphy marketable another must be hunky Dublin no he hire business really Omaha Fatah me hi to mark of Aikido a Camila each other unsure Akita body but there but washes and battle into her Mohammed we have just about 30 seconds left but I saw you nodding your head there what are you thinking just just to point out that when when Doreen was arrested about 400 other people were arrested in 2015-2016 for Facebook post and this is not only a violation of like basic human rights of free speech but this also a test to say that there is a narrative here that is being manipulated Muhammad I reared I have to stop you there are thanks to you ft Sam Barakat and refused the ADA thank you for being here on the show today and the story will course we'll continue with hashtag aj stream we'll see you online
