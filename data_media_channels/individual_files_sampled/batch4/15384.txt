I want to read an excerpt from the press release from from the Middle East forum your group writes quote the forum's contribution the 1 million dollar offer requires Unruh to end the automatic registering and perpetuity of number 1 the descendants of refugees number 2 though those who hold a nationality and three those who live in their purported homeland the West Bank in Gaza making these technical changes puts it in line with all other refugee agencies and reduces the number of Palestinian refugees now this is what really stood out to me dr. pipes reduces the number of Palestinian refugees from 5.3 million to around 20,000 you want to say our 1 million dollar donation will go a long way to meet the humanitarian considerations of this small and diminishing number I mean I'm that is that is a mind-blowing statistic that there overinflating than their numbers through their process to this degree right 99 and a half percent black so our offer is contingent on one changing that of course I'm not going to accept our money it's pretty sight but if they did we've got the million for them the the whole the the import of is not so much funding terrorism that's bad in itself but even worse is the fact that von Romme gives the refugee status to a baby born today so it sees itself this baby will see itself as victimized as remote from its homeland and so forth so it's bad for the Palestinians it's also obviously bad for the Israelis because it it it nurtures this large and growing room of individuals who want to murder Israel and get rid of this is bad for everybody this is critically important content and I want to bring it to you every day but please subscribe to our premium service at www.fafsa.gov you into all this you're gonna absolutely love it I guarantee it you're gonna love it you gotta check it out I will be back with you tomorrow thanks so much for watching
