>> THE IDEA THAT IMMIGRANTS
COME OVER HERE AND THEY
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AND THEY
ARE DRAGGING US DOWN,
BECAUSE WE ALL COME FROM
IMMIGRANTS, INCLUDING YOU
TYPICALLY LEHNER.
>> SHE TALKS ABOUT LOW
SKILLS.
WHAT EXACTLY ARE HER SKILLS.
>> HER SECOND GREAT
GRANDMOTHER HAD BEEN HERE 10
YEARS SPOKE NO ENGLISH.
>> CONSENSUS THREE TIMES
GREAT GRANDMOTHER BEEN HERE
41 YEARS AND STILL SPOKE
GERMAN SHE DIDN'T SPEAK
ENGLISH EITHER.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN
HISTORY SHE CERTAINLY
DOESN'T KNOW THIS COUNTRY'S
HISTORY.
AINSLEY: FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR TOMI LAHREN IS
HERE TO
HERE.TO
WHAT LED TO BASHING ON "THE
VIEW."
>> ONE WOMAN OVER THE
WEEKEND WHO TOOK IT UPON
HERSELF TO RESEARCH MY
FAMILY HISTORY IN HOPES OF
DIGGING UP SOME KIND OF A
GOTCHA MOMENT, A GOTCHA
ANGLE TO VALIDATE ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND OPEN BORDERS
AND WHAT SHE FOUND WAS
REALLY SHOCKING, GUYS.
SHE FOUND THAT MY FAMILY,
WHO CAME HERE IN THE 1800S
FROM NORWAY AND GERMANY THAT
THEY SPOKE NORWEGIAN AND
GERMAN.
AND REALLY WHAT SHE DID IS
PROVE THAT MY FAMILY CAME
HERE LEGALLY.
BUT WHAT SHE WAS HOPING TO
DO WAS TRY TO CALL ME A
HYPOCRITE FOR BELIEVING IN
MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION.
AGAIN, SHE FAILED MISERABLY.
BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T WHAT
SHE CALLS RESISTANCE
GENEALOGY.
IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF
TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.
I REALLY AM HAPPY THOUGH
THAT SHE HAS SUCH A
FASCINATION WITH MY FAMILY
HISTORY AND I'M HOPING THAT
SHE WILL TAKE ON ELIZABETH
WARREN'S NEXT.
BRIAN: THAT WOULD BE VERY
INTERESTING.
TOMI, A COUPLE OF THINGS.
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION.
ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE SIGNS
THE GUEST BOOK AND SAYS I
WOULD LIKE TO STAY.
HERE'S MY CREDENTIALS.
THE OTHER SNEAKS IN.
THEY MIGHT PEOPLE A WAY IN
AND THERE IS A WRONG WAY IN.
AND FOR THEM TO GO THAT DEEP
IN YOUR BACKGROUND, YOU HAVE
GOTTEN UNDER THEIR SKIN TO A
LEVEL YINK WAS POSSIBLE.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU THAT
BOTHERS THEM SO MUCH?
>> IT'S NOT JUST ME OR
ANYBODY WHO ADVOCATES FOR
MERIT BASED IMMIGRATION OR
HAS AN ISSUE WITH OPEN
BORDERS.
AGAIN, JUST LIKE YOU SAID,
THEY DON'T SEEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT WE, ON THE
RIGHT, BELIEVE IN
IMMIGRATION.
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE A
NATION OF IMMIGRANTS AND I
AM PROUD OF MY HERITAGE.
HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT
THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS OF
TODAY IS APPLES TO ORANGES
WHAT IT WAS IN THE 1800S
WHEN IMMIGRANTS CAME TO THIS
COUNTRY LEGALLY.
WERE DOCUMENTED, WORKED FOR
THEMSELVES, ASKED FOR
NOTHING AND BUILT A LIFE AND
A FAMILY.
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRISIS
OF TODAY THAT WE MUST DEAL
WITH.
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHATSOEVER.
BRIAN: DID YOU PROVIDE THEM
WITH D.N.A. 23 AND ME.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THE DETAIL
ON YOUR BACKGROUND THAT THEY
WERE ABLE TO GET.
>> WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO.
SHE DID ALL THE RESEARCH FOR
ME.
APPRECIATIVE.
AINSLEY: JOY SAYING WHAT ARE
YOUR SKILLS?
IT'S BEYOND RESEARCH.
IT IS PERSONAL.
IT IS MEAN.
>> OF COURSE THIS IS
CLASSICAL JOY BEHAR.
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ASK JOY
BEHAR WHAT HER SKILLS ARE
BECAUSE PERHAPS WE COULD
SWAP STORIES.
I KNOW I WATCH JOY AND SEEMS
LIKE A HIGHLY SKILLED LADY
BUT FOR HER TO ATTACK ME
THAT'S REAL INTERESTING.
THOSE IN GLASS HOUSES SHOULD
NOT THROW STONES.
STEVE: MEANWHILE, ONE OTHER
THING THE "NEW YORK TIMES"
HAS THIS HEADLINE, BREAKING
UP IMMIGRANT FAMILIES.
THIS ALSO HAS TO DO WITH
IMMIGRATION.
A LOOK AT THE LATEST BORDER
TACTIC.
CLEARLY, AS WE HAVE HEARD
FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
THE UNITED STATES, TOMI,
THIS ADMINISTRATION IS
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE
ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION
LAWS WHERE THE LAST DURING
THE OBAMA YEARS NOT SO MUCH.
>> DURING THE OBAMA YEARS
CATTLE CALL TO COME INTO
THIS NATION ILLEGALLY.
FURTHERMORE, THIS IS THE
AGAIN THE LEFT'S ATTEMPT AT
EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL.
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO STATE I
DON'T KNOW IF THEY
UNDERSTAND THIS OR NOT BUT
IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR
FAMILIES TO BE BROKEN UP
WHEN YOU CROSS THE BORDER
ILLEGALLY, HERE'S AN IDEA,
DON'T CROSS THE BORDER
ILLEGALLY THEN YOUR FAMILY
WILL SURELY STAY TOGETHER.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE LEFT
CAN'T THINK OF, THIS BUT
THEY WOULD RATHER TRY TO
TELL US THAT WE HATE
FAMILIES AND WANT TO BREAK
UP FAMILIES, WE ARE
HORRIBLE, WE ARE DESPICABLE.
NO WE WANT TO ENFORCE
FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW
WHICH IS WHY TEXAS CYSTS IN
THE FIRST PLACE, BUT, AGAIN,
THE LEFT CANNOT SEEM TO
UNDERSTANDING THIS CONCEPT.
STEVE: WELL, AND THE UNITED
STATES IS TRYING TO ENFORCE
OUR BORDER REGULATIONS DOWN
SOUTH.
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF
YEARS IT HASN'T BEEN SO
MUCH.
THEN THE NEWS OUT OF ISRAEL
YESTERDAY WAS THE FACT THAT
THE ISRAELIS WERE PROTECTING
THEIR BORDER AND THE
PALESTINIANS UNDERSTOOD THAT
THERE COULD BE TROUBLE BUT
NONETHELESS THEIR LEADERS
SAID GO AHEAD, YOU KNOW,
BREACH THE BORDER.
CLIMB OVER THE WALL BECAUSE
THE ISRAELI SOLDIERS HAVE
RUN AWAY.
>> WELL, AS WE SEE ISRAEL
CLEARLY DOESN'T PLAY AROUND.
EVERY NATION HAS THE RIGHT
TO ENFORCE THEIR BORDER.
EVERY NATION HAS A RIGHT TO
PROTECT ITS CITIZENS.
I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE.
YOU DON'T LOCK YOUR DOOR
BECAUSE YOU HATE THE PEOPLE
OUTSIDE.
YOU LOCK IT BECAUSE YOU
BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE
PEOPLE INSIDE.
BORDER.
BUT THE LEFT WOULD RATHER US
HAVE OPEN BORDERS.
AGAIN, THAT'S A THREAT TO
OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY AND
WE THAT BELIEVE IN LEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND WE THAT
BELIEVE IN BORDER
ENFORCEMENT WILL NEVER STAND
FOR THAT EVER.
BRIAN: TOMI, ON BEHALF OF
THE PEOPLE OF NORWAY AND
GERMANY, WE THANK YOU FOR
YOUR PARENTS.
TOGETHER HAVE YOU BECOME A
FINE HUMAN BEING.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT, GUYS.
STILL WAITING FOR ELIZABETH
WARREN'S GENEALOGY, THOUGH.
