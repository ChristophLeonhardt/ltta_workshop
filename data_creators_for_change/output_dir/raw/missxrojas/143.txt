1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
I never really<font color="#CCCCCC"> had those big wide-open</font>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,799
summers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in films I worked I</font>

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,779
went on holidays that I saved up for and

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,940
I kind of gave myself all these weird

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,010
tasks even when I was young that someone

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,809
has never felt and cheated me I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,820
feels empty to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people growing</font>

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">up my summers have become busier than</font>

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,150
ever especially in the last couple of

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,100
years with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the release of two films when</font>

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,330
the fault in our stars was filming I

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,859
went out to Amsterdam to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the scenes</font>

13
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,529
there and when paper towels is filming I

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,180
went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the scenes filmed in the</font>

15
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,800
abandoned many more it's weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,990
back then it's weird to explain what a

17
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,120
film is when you're seeing bits and

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,680
pieces of it when you're seeing drafts

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,390
of scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dailies and cool sheets</font>

20
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,980
and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> little fragments of these</font>

21
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,510
things when i'm seeing a scheduled for

22
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,370
one person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's one part of this huge</font>

23
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,079
enterprise when it's so focused on

24
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,370
something but you don't know what that

25
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,960
something will be and what it will

26
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,100
become there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of other</font>

27
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
youtubers there and it was like being

28
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,030
plucked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my life for a moment into</font>

29
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
this other life<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two sides of</font>

30
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing at least on this trip you know</font>

31
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my job and then I was also</font>

32
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to explore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and experience it in</font>

33
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,379
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that all the other</font>

34
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,589
youtubers like Tyler and Hannah and Troy

35
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,470
and Ingrid were also invited to

36
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,740
experience it this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peek into</font>

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,020
something you know like you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> led</font>

38
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,060
into this this place that feels quite

39
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,299
secret that feels in its own way

40
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,659
abandoned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels in its own way kind</font>

41
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of unfinished because you have all those</font>

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,830
sets that don't have doors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

43
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,049
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have half the room and then</font>

44
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,549
there's something complete about it

45
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,020
still because there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention</font>

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,299
to detail there's so much love put into

47
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,970
it it's a strange experience and then at

48
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day it's work it seems</font>

49
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,060
that need to be shot it's a

50
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,770
collaboration between everyone hired to

51
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,360
work on it I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of felt like we were</font>

52
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
foreign-exchange students visiting for a

53
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,750
year there are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> moments in the</font>

54
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,820
Paper Towns film that I love my absolute

55
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,619
favorite is probably when<font color="#CCCCCC"> hind kicks in</font>

56
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,930
but the scenes especially with radar and

57
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Angela are what I hope they would be and</font>

58
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,969
more the joy of adaptations for me is

59
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,969
seeing someone play with this world that

60
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,590
I really love in these character

61
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I love and see what they'll do with them</font>

62
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,770
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like you're seeing a story</font>

63
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're seeing a text the way they</font>

64
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,068
see it and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and watch a film</font>

65
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,810
with friends or you go and have that

66
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,580
kind of communal experience and you talk

67
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,140
about it afterwards you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

68
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,849
to their lands<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their perspective and</font>

69
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,080
I think that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I liked watching</font>

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,030
YouTube videos about films and things I

71
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,170
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that John</font>

72
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,459
may episode or someone else may have

73
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,349
said but every part of the film is

74
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,540
someone's interpretation on it it's not

75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,610
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the directors cool there</font>

76
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,080
are so many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> facets to it I</font>

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the moment of creation is</font>

78
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,530
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really over its kind of actively</font>

79
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,630
always being created and actively always

80
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,780
been built upon and I think that every

81
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,730
part of discussion around<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

82
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone has made makes it and it's not</font>

83
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it makes it in a permanent way</font>

84
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,450
that's going to us outlast us all I work

85
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,560
for John<font color="#E5E5E5"> after all I know that</font>

86
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's going to die it's more</font>

87
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,769
important than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's more important</font>

88
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,799
that immortality it's the process of it

89
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,989
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the real fun at least for me</font>

90
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,030
so yeah I was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> honored</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

91
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,410
invited behind the scenes and I know

92
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,629
that I probably should have made this

93
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,260
video in<font color="#CCCCCC"> may or in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> June or in July but I</font>

94
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,019
kind of wanted a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of quiet in the</font>

95
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,180
summer I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be back at a place</font>

96
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,799
where I could think about everything

97
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,810
that's happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past</font>

98
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of years for me professionally</font>

99
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,319
seeing having the gift of seeing these

100
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,790
stories that I really love come to life

101
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,769
and having them come to life in all

102
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,299
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in ways that</font>

103
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,239
are familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and unfamiliar to me where</font>

104
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm at at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> precise moment on this</font>

105
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,500
precise day is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really fun to</font>

106
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,660
have so many avenues and opportunities

107
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explore storytelling like in every</font>

108
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">aspect of our lives right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

109
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,040
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunities to explore toric</font>

110
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,200
storytelling whether that's still oral

111
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,919
storytelling or in print or on film or

112
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,500
in video games or in comics what an

113
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,919
amazing thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are able to create</font>

114
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,389
these stories and these narrative

115
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:53,639
experiences and share them with one

116
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,859
another I don't know I don't know I

117
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,329
think I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just feeling grateful today</font>

118
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,780
which is appropriate looks I'm very

119
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,380
privileged very lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's been a</font>
