all we've done with this law is we've reaffirmed the purpose of Israel which is the the one and only place in the world that Jews get to call their home I think Jews are good guests in other countries I don't think you know unless you're a Nazi and you believe you know what Hitler wrote in mine camp Oh Jews are not the worst people to have in your country but yet when Jews want their own country to do things differently in a Jewish way this is the one we've got the only one we've got and it's where all our traditions and cultures came from and I can I mean I could criticize this law I really don't think it needs to be changed I I'm not sort of apologizing for it in any way but if I'm gonna be like really I've always used or over the last few years I've used the language of indigenous people I think it's a very important point to say it's not the individuals who are sitting here today but it's the entire culture and many of the individuals and all our connections to history that come from here and so Judaism and Jews are obviously indigenous to Israel but there are some other groups of people who dwell quite happily in our country today who are also indigenous now the ones who aren't we'll just clear this out of the way is basically Islamic culture is not indigenous to Israel it arrived here by conquest it is a conquering invading force that's Arabic and that's Islam but we do have populations like the Druze who I was actually visiting with Druze chap in the north today about an hour away from me in a place called Dalia tell Carmel sitting on a just beautiful mountain with the Mediterranean Sea on one side instead of I could look all the way from the Mediterranean Sea and then inland just gorgeous place and I was with a proud scientist Jews he's got two Israeli flags flying on flag poles in his beautiful house and his kids go to the army he went to the army he knows the only reason why Drew's are safer and better off in Israel you know because big Druze populations live in Syria Lebanon few in Jordan very very small numbering in Turkey but their safest and most secure here in Israel because Jews run the place that's just and and he's happy with this law he's got no problem in fact someone was interviewing him and and there'll be a an op-ed that he'll co-write in the Jerusalem Post in a few days I hope because and you know we've had this huge outpouring of just left-wing dominated oh how can we say we're better well I'm sorry but this is the Jewish state we exist for Jews we exist to be the place for Jews but we are also capable of having minorities live comfortably in this country which is a trick no one else manages in the Middle East that's an excerpt from my weekly full-length show the gun show on my show I take on the issues of the day through my Alberta conservative lens and I talked to the real news makers the mainstream media ignores to get access to my show in all of our other premium content click the link on the screen to subscribe today you
