a fraternity at Cornell is indefinitely suspended in fact they have self suspended themselves after one of their frat members was arrested following the beating of a black student John Greenfield is the name of the student who has been arrested I'm sorry Greenwood John Greenwood was arrested police identified a 19-year old John Greenwood as the Cornell student charged with misdemeanor assault after he was arrested police did not release a mugshot now the victim in this story said he was trying to get people to leave the front yard of his residence when a group of men yelled expletives and the n-word at him and then they proceeded to assault him punch him in the face he went to the hospital for a possible concussion and a broken nose luckily he did not have a broken nose and he is recovering fine today but the fact that this happened is ridiculous also the cops are saying that they're exploring all avenues of what led up to the incident itself and what prompted it police are also reviewing the evidence that they have against the statues statutes that they have for a hate crime so they are treating this as a potential hate crime we'll see how it goes but the fraternity that this student was part of originally denied that he had any involvement with them and then when they realized oh a yeah he's involved with us they decided that they would no longer operate on the Cornell campus and that they would now use the building that that fraternity operates from for you know the students to promote diversity which i think is a good move on their part yeah on the campus the Black Student Union and others occupied a Willard Strait Hall which is of historical significance because in 1969 after a series of incidents there wasn't a similar you know gathering of people in that building and issued 12 demands to the school among those demands were the expulsion of all people involved in addition they wanted to ban the in the permanently banned the Sai Epsilon fraternity and they wanted to turn it into a cultural center for black students right in addition to a lot of other demands that are things that I think a lot of universities can benefit from things like adding coursework on privilege and power mental health personnel of color to be hired in addition to training on identity issues such as race sex citizen status and class my my question here aside from all that is why the police won't release the mugshot of John Greenwood after the arrest once this becomes a national story and a similar thing happened with brock turner as well like why do we have to put up a photo of him in his suit and tie rather than the police mugshot I mean they would do the same thing if it was a black person beating up a white yeah no they always do that you're right it's always very fair and balanced it's never like a photo of him like holding up a gun from his Instagram from like 7 years ago or anything like that like will they pull his rap sheet figure out if he's done anything when he was like 12 years old are they gonna give him a drug test and figure out whether or not he's you know using marijuana it's cocaine it's a it's a frat on an Ivy League campus it's cocaine he's got cocaine in it yeah I'm just saying like it's just very fair and balanced treatment when it comes to good old boys going to an Ivy League university in a fraternity doing everything right they're part of the squash team they clear not have yeah they could not have this person could not have been a racist like no we need to change this idea that that people that are wealthy white students can't be frickin racist like it's only it's only people that are poor that are racist no this dude is if he use the n-word and then attack this person like this is a hate crime right what more do you need does he need to write a manifesto as well saying I hate black people I think tribalism is a real thing and that that black people are inferior to white people and that's why I will punch someone tomorrow night like is that when we will arrest them for a crime Oh everything that you said feeding into reasons why they don't show his mug shot and why they show him in a suit and tie though I want to punch him in the face more cause he's in a suit and tie and is like frat photo like Britt hates people that were suits and ties I do I did racist against that I am allergic to suits and ties um but that all feeds into what's going to be the angle which is like listen this kid is not a menace to society he made a mistake he had an error in judgment he is a frat he's a he's in a fraternity this is a member of another fraternity it's a Kappa sig kid and this is a psych epsilon and you know what everyone's on if there's a lot of testosterone going it was one big mistake that's what they want to do but this is a situation where you go rule of law yeah if you want rule of law this is where rule of law says that as soon as you drop the n-word I don't care if you're you know whatever reason you gave for it but as soon as you did that it is now a hate crime and you will suffer accordingly because the problem is person in this situation it is very likely that the squash player from Deerfield Cornell in sight Epsilon has not suffered the kind of consequences that would befall someone in literally any other organization now if you can call it a fraternity on the one hand it's the same as a gang it's a group of young men hanging out together we cannot excuse one while punishing the other disproportionate and by the way I'm not the biggest advocate for draconian punishments and I might get a lot of hate for saying this but if we're going to be lenient when it comes to these sort of cases we should exercise that same leniency when it comes to black perps as well keep it real there there has always been a two-tier justice system right and some of that of course has to do with racial background but a lot of it also has to do with socioeconomic status so if you're you know a white kid who comes from a wealthy or well-to-do family you're able to afford a certain level of defense that people from a lower socioeconomic status or an underprivileged background wouldn't be able to I mean think about what happened with that affluenza case where an underage kid steals liquor from a Walmart store drives a car without a lot and then crashes into people on the side of the road killing several of them and when he is you know in court one of the defense the one part of the defense was that you know he comes from a wealthy family and he's been so lucky and privileged all his life that he's never had to face any consequences so making him face consequences now would be really difficult for him the rejoinder is let's start now bitch here's your consequence you're gonna suffer it well I think a attorney Raymond Schlatter JD 76 would disagree with you're with yourself seems like when you when you have that entire thing mapped out on your article I feel like he's probably a good a good attorney another interesting aspect of this is the difference between what we kind of talked about this with hot with schools for minors what a school district can do to punish kids now there's another series of debate going on over what a university can do to punish a student because it's out it's exist outside of the criminal law system so Cornell seems like they've taken certain steps but they don't really have to and they don't have to go in line with what happened with what the like conclusion of a legal debate might be you have it the University of Southern California they had a kicker who was kicked off the football team because he was found choking his girlfriend and she afterwards maintains listen nothing happened it's a misunderstanding SC is like listen we have your statement and the statement of other people saying it did happen we can't wait for the conclusion of the legal battle we're gonna kick this kid off because we were not beholden to the to the legal system we have our own code of conduct and he violated that so he's off oh so Cornell can act outside of that system and say listen we don't have to wait until she's convicted or not we can get rid of this person based on what we think is a preponderance of evidence or whatever their standard is right you know I think a great solution to all this is concealed carry on college campuses because you know wow you're so right but think about that like that's what the NRA pushes for and that's what members the GOP who were funded by the NRA push for yeah concealed carry on college campuses let's give these kids a gang he wouldn't have broken his nose you would have efficiently murdered that's right that's wrong so whether it was racially motivated or not this was a violent act and you put a weapon in that person's hand and it would have ended much worse another thing is for schools like Cornell first like top tier private schools the thing they think about when weighing what their conclusion will be is absolutely reputation reputation reputation so if you if everyone watching out there makes a big stink about this you can absolutely especially in the case of an Ivy League school effect change because people like SC they had been under intense scrutiny because of other violations in the past and so they wanted to get ahead of the next one if you go and hold Cornell to intense scrutiny they will do everything in their power to stay ahead in the next one support independent media come join us the Young Turks TYT
