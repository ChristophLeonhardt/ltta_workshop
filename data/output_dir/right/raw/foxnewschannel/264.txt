00:00:06,017 --> 00:00:07,317
QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD.

4
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:08,652
NEIGHBORS ARE SHOCKED TO HEAR

00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:11,922
THIS NEWS COME OUT ABOUT THEIR

6
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:14,458
OWN NEIGHBOR, PAUL ROSENFELD.

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,332
AND OCTOBER HE WAS BUILDING A

10
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:22,633
BOMB.

11
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:24,434
THERE'S PUMPKINS ON THE STEPS.

12
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,069
JUST A NORMAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,805
THE FBI SAID HE PLANNED ON

14
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,373
BLOWING HIMSELF UP AND OTHERS ON

15
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:31,308
THE NATIONAL MALL WITH THAT BOMB

16
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,310
IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON ELECTION

17
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:35,078
DAY 23406TH.

18
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,014
PROSECUTORS SAY HE WANTED TO

19
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:40,517
DRAW ATTENTION TO AN ALTERNATE

20
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:42,219
POLITICAL THEORY.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,987
THE 56-YEAR-OLD ORDERED BLACK

22
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,455
POWDER ONLINE AND HAD IT SHIPPED

23
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:46,156
TO NEW JERSEY.

24
00:00:46,157 --> 00:00:47,825
HE DROVE EIGHT POUNDS OF THAT

25
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,726
BLACK POWDER TO HIS NEW YORK

26
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:50,093
BASEMENT.

27
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:51,228
THAT'S WHERE HE BUILT THE BOMB

28
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,798
OUT OF A PLYWOOD BOX.

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,067
OTHER COMPONENTS WERE ADDED TO

30
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,302
ENSURE THE BOMB WOULD KILL HIM

31
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,937
WHEN IT EXPLODED.

32
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:01,672
PROSECUTORS SAY IT APPEARED THE

33
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,140
BOMB WAS FUNCTIONAL AND

34
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:04,641
ROSENFELD TREATED HIS BASEMENT

35
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,043
LIKE A BOMB FACTORY.

36
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:08,779
HE CONDUCTED TESTS USING SMALLER

37
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,079
BOMBS.

38
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,647
WE SPOKE TO NEIGHBORS AND WE

39
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:13,317
ALSO SPOKE TO ED, THE MAILMAN,

40
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:14,785
WHO'S BEEN DELIVERING MAIL ON

41
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:17,054
THIS ROUTE FOR THE LAST EIGHT

42
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:17,354
YEARS.

43
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,256
>> I NEVER SUSPECTED THAT THERE

44
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:20,657
WOULD BE A BOMB INSIDE THIS

45
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:20,958
HOUSE.

46
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,893
I WOULD HAVE NEVER SUSPECTED A

47
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,629
NORMAL PLACE LIKE THIS ON A

48
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,166
QUIET STREET WOULD BE HOME OF A

49
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:31,134
MAD SCIENTIST.

50
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:31,902
>> Reporter: ROSENFELD WAS

51
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,937
CAUGHT, DANA, BECAUSE A PERSON

52
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:36,240
WAS RECEIVING LETTERS AND TEXT

53
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,541
MESSAGES FROM ROSENFELD.

54
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:39,142
THAT PERSON SAID THAT THEY DID

55
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:41,211
NOT HAVE ANY IDEA WHO ROSENFELD

56
00:01:41,212 --> 00:01:42,713
WAS, BUT THAT HE WAS SENDING

57
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:44,948

58
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,084
