I mean this is no self-serving statement but I'm one of not many American journalists who have been to North Korea to my Western eyes and mind is one of the strangest oddest places on earth with almost incomprehensible mind and thought control but the dictatorial government the longer one is in North Korea the more one knows how much one doesn't know it is in that spirit that I submit the following few geopolitical crises have simmered with more combustible energy longer than the instability on the Korean Peninsula it was the fierce and bloody Korean War of the 1950's that was the backdrop of my college years and throughout my decades as a reporter that unfinished conflict has never been far from the headlines in the past they've been some moments of optimism for if not a peace that at least a thawing of hostility but those moments have been the exception most of the trend lines have been toward greater danger a reality that is sprung into ever more urgent reality with the reclusive and repressive regime of North Korea becoming a nuclear power and one armed with an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of short medium and long-range missiles the Korean stalemate has dominated Americans concerns in East Asia and bedeviled every president who has had to confront it regardless of their ideology or party affiliation it is against this backdrop that what can only be described as an historic meeting took place this past week between the leaders of North and South Korea this was the fruition of a strategy pursued by president moon of South Korea who has called for greater engagement and reconciliation with his neighbor to the north we are now in the third generation of the Kim dynasty in North Korea and relatively new and still quite young leader Kim jong-un remains a mystery wrapped in an enigma his consolidation of power has been by all accounts swift brutal and remorseless up until now his attitude towards the outside world was bellicose mixed with a determination to grow his nuclear might as the ultimate checkmate to those who would seek to overthrow him by force but that Kim seemed far removed than the one who met his South Korean counterpart this week promising to shudder his nuclear testing sites opened him up to foreign inspection and negotiate a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula in the future so now the stage is set for a summit with President Trump is this a trap set by North Korea to buy more time and gain global legitimacy for his regime is there really a path to peace his president Trump prepared for these delicate negotiations was this brought about because of the president's tough talk and earlier threats to North Korea or despite them what role will China play and our Japanese allies who remain very nervous never mind the South Koreans many longtime Korean Watchers feel the chances of failure and disappointment even maybe escalation are high but there's also a sense that this may be different no matter what anyone may think of president Trump we almost hope that we can begin a path toward a lessening of tension if not outright peace millions of lives hang in the balance
