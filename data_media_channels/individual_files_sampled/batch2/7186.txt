so this is a story that caught my eye from raw story they say Christian lawmaker giddy about abortion being outlawed advises women to get their coat hangers ready so of course he's referring to Cavanaugh becoming justice Cavanaugh and officially getting on the Supreme Court he is ecstatic about that and so he thought it would be a really smooth and intelligent thing to do to go on social media and basically brag and say get your coat hangers ready because the force is going away whoa now it's funny because there were a lot of Republicans who were pretending like oh no he's not gonna get rid of he's not gonna rule against abortion he already ruled against abortion in one case he also criticized he criticized the decision in Roe versus Wade so that's evidence II perhaps would go even further in an anti-abortion direction so it's funny how you see the dichotomy of what they say when they're trying to get their way like no he's not gonna do it and then when they they let their hair hang loose they're like oh yeah he's gonna get abortion and it's awesome so they can't be honest about what they really believe because then they know it'll turn people off so they wait until they already get their way and then they're like ha ha gotcha he's gonna get rid of it get your coat hangers ready that's how you know you're a tribal idiot because he's happy and he's bragging that legal abortion will go away but go ahead perform your illegal abortion see that's an admission like oh yeah no we know sure we know if you ban it legally people are just gonna get them illegally and what happens when you have illegal abortion you put the life of the mother at risk so congratulations for being a fucking moron who wants to put the life of the mother risk I read a wonderful article a while ago that really made an amazing case for the left-wing position on reproductive issues and basically the article was from somebody who was formerly on the right and who was formerly against abortion and what she said is here's how I was convinced that I was wrong the empirical data so in other words what happens is when left wingers get their way what's the ideal left-wing policy when it comes to reproductive rights well sex education you have Planned Parenthood and Family Planning clinics that are available and open to the public and you know anybody can get that information and can get the help that they need you have you know to teach contraception and things of that nature and you know the old saying was abortion should be safe legal and rare and what happens when you set up a left-wing an ideal left-wing system on those reproductive issues STD rates go down child pregnancy rates go down the abortion rate goes down why well you bortion rate goes down because you're teaching family planning you have sex education you have these family planning clinics that are open and so the result of that is fewer unwanted pregnancies fewer abortions so in this article this woman was arguing hey listen don't be a dumbass like don't fucking like have a brain that functions don't have a cinderblock where your head is supposed to be because if you want to have fewer abortions you should support the left-wing proposals because it is a matter of fact that the left-wing proposals get us fewer abortions now on the flip side there are countries where abortion is totally banned and they have more abortions than countries where abortion is legal because again it goes hand in hand abortion is illegal but now we don't teach about family planning and we don't teach sex education cuz we don't want to sexualize the kids at a young age or whatever bullshit argument they come up with and all the social effects are the opposite of what conservatives say they want to happen so if you want to limit the number of abortion support the left-wing policies but this guy's like oh yeah abortion is gonna be outlawed get your coat hangers ready illegal abortion time such a sick prick so this guy's a West Virginia lawmaker and he left the Democratic Party because he felt it was anti-christian he's parks burg City Councilman Eric Barber and my favorite part of the story is he went back and deleted this comment perhaps because he realizes he sound like a fucking idiot and then he accused everybody who called him out on it to try of trying to get him fired he's Parks burg City Councilman Eric barber yeah when people call you out cuz you say something stupid and they don't and they want to get you out of office that my friend is called democracy what a fuckin jackass I got you want you want to get me fired yeah cuz you're a public official and you said something I don't agree with so I want to get you out of office by voting you out of office yeah you can't do that yeah it's called democracy so this guy somehow in just this one story I've learned that he's one of the biggest idiots in the country which is hilarious
