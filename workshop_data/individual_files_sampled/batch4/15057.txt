a Labour councillor who once said that there's no proof Isis even exists is now in charge of protecting children against radicalization no I'm not making this up and I wish I was to remember the case of Safian Noor last year she was a Labour Party council candidate at the time and she was suspended from her role as a parent governor at the yew tree Community School in Witten and she was suspended because she came out on Facebook claiming that there was no proof that Isis existed amazing isn't it at the time the Birmingham Mail reported a Birmingham laborer a local election candidate who claimed there was no proof that Islamic state exists has been suspended as a school governor law student staff Ian Nour apologized after the Birmingham Mail revealed the claims she made in a string of controversial Facebook posts the 25 year old had been selected as Labour's new candidate for the Small Heath ward in City Council elections next year now you tree Community School in Witten has confirmed she's been suspended as a parent governor while an investigation into her comments takes place well now she's not just a candidate anymore now she's an elected Labour Party councillor for the Small Heath Ward after winning in the May elections and her comments were bad enough to get his suspended from the school but not bad enough to get suspended from the Labour Party in fact she went on to become an elected representative of the Labour Party I mean this should come as no surprise really I mean you can come out with the the most insane real hardcore socialist communist crap or anti-semitic stuff or whatever you like and we can even become leader of the Labour Party if you're fancy it but not only did she say by the way that there was no proof that Isis existed as she also posted on Twitter this is according to Birmingham live that people must grow up and stop pointing fingers following the Westminster terror attack so to me this woman is either an apologist for these innit attacks or she's purposely misleading people to try and stop them from you know tracing the source of the problem she's either apologising for it or trying to fool people into thinking that the problem isn't with a religious script or text either way that makes her a very dangerous woman but the most fascinating part of all of this is that she's now been appointed to the children's social care overview and scrutiny committee so this means that now she's going to be responsible for helping ensure that children are protected from radicalization that's the level of insanity we've reached in England the level of insanity where where a woman who's either apologising for or denying the existence of terrorists is now responsible for stopping children from being radicalized by terrorists that's the insanity we're facing here Conservative councillor Alex yet told the Birmingham live considering that the school at which she was a governor suspended her saying her comments breached its code of conduct it beggars belief that labor think it appropriate for her to oversee safeguarding of children including protecting them from the threat of radicalization well the Labour Party has overseen the protection of children in lots of areas of this country and I don't think I need to go into detail when I comment on that do I I think you know exactly what I'm talking about the Labour Party's got a history of failing children and they're doing it yet again but by the way by the way the Small Heath Ward where she's from this is where schools were affected by the Trojan horse scandal this is when Islamists tried to take over schools across Birmingham with a really strict adherence to Islam of course the Guardian etc tried to push it off as pass it off as fake but it happened it happened and it happened in this local area which makes NORs job even more important there is a real presence of radicals in Birmingham and it's her job to stop kids from being radicalized but given she doesn't even recognize that Isis exists I dread to think how badly she's gonna do that job The Telegraph reported in 2015 regarding this they said another Birmingham school puts in special measures and mid Trojan horse fears small Heath a previously outstanding non faith state secondary is expected to be downgraded to inadequate by Ofsted so the serious problems in Birmingham problems with radicalization and a woman that's been appointed to deal with it doesn't even think they exist when a woman who denies the existence from Isis from a part of the country that saw local schools trying to indoctrinate children with an Islamic agenda you know there's a problem the Labour Party allowed Safian or to remain as a candidate for the Labour Party she then stood and won became an elected councillor for the Labour Party and now she's in charge of protecting children against radicalization this is insanity from a part of the world that saw the Trojan horse agenda the Trojan horse never went away it simply changed it's away from the schools now and the Islamic agenda might not be slipping through the schools but it is slipping through the net in the form of counselors who are apologists for real extremists the tentacles of a violent political ideology have spread into every single institution of this country and when you cut off one tentacle and another one grows back
