1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,730
A weeping teenage girl
recently sat in front of

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,600
Iran’s state TV and made a
so-called confession. Her crime?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,150
She danced to pop
music in her bedroom

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,770
and posted the recordings
on her Instagram account.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,830
This young girl, 18-year-old
Maedeh Hojabri,

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,800
was arrested by
Iran’s security agents, hauled

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
in front of the
state broadcaster,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,400
and forced to make
state-dictated

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,525
statements of remorse.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,140
My name is Nazanin Boniadi
and I’m an Iranian-born

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,340
actress.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,260
My parents were
political refugees

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,320
who fled to London in
the aftermath of the 1979

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,874
Iranian Revolution.

15
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:52,540
They didn’t want to
raise their daughter

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,690
in a social, political
and legal climate

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,210
that was growing increasingly
aggressive toward women

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,770
and girls.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,010
I often wonder how
different my life

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,200
would have been if I’d
grown up without the freedom

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,455
to dance, sing and
perform as a little girl.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,550
Thousands of Iranians
inside the Islamic Republic

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,610
and all over the world have
registered their disgust

24
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,770
at the humiliation
of this girl by posting

25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,380
videos of themselves
dancing and singing

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,880
in solidarity with Maedeh.

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,660
This is only the
latest in a series

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,480
of acts of civil disobedience
against Iran’s

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,140
decades-long gender apartheid

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,920
and legalized misogyny.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,340
Brave Iranian women

32
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,110
have disguised themselves as
men to enter sports stadiums

33
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,950
and they’ve publicly removed
their government-mandated

34
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,640
headscarves in peaceful
protest.

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,290
For many women,

36
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,910
the hijab has become
a constant reminder

37
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,160
of their inequality in Iran,
where women are forbidden

38
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,830
from becoming judges, let alone
president.

39
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,190
And a woman’s court testimony

40
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,430
and inheritance is half that of a man’s,

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,800
and a married woman needs
her husband’s approval

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,876
to work or travel.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,290
Now we see a young girl, head
uncovered, joyfully dancing

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,560
at home,

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,440
forced to parade
herself in front

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,540
of the nation as a criminal.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,240
This cultural
tyranny must end.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,820
It’s not only peaceful dissent
that can land one in prison

49
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,019
in Iran.

50
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,310
People are told
what books they

51
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,590
can read, what movies
they can watch,

52
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,140
and what music they can enjoy.

53
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,210
Maedeh’s arrest shows
that Iran denies

54
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,240
even the most personal
and nonpolitical acts

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,050
of expression, a basic
and universal human right.

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,860
Humiliating a young girl
for her joyful acts of youth

57
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,130
is a disgrace.

58
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,690
The authorities tried to shame
a young girl, but instead

59
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,800
they have only shamed themselves.

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,240
It’s a moral imperative
that every world leader

61
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,030
stands with the Iranian
people and doesn’t ignore

62
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,240
their cries when shaking
hands with President Rouhani

63
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,670
or Foreign Minister Zarif
or any representatives

64
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,530
of the Islamic Republic.

65
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,740
It’s time to put
people before politics.

66
00:03:12,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Human dignity is
not negotiable.
