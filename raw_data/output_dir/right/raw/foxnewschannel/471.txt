1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,414
GREG: SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:07,617
FROM THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS?

3
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:08,684
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S

4
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:10,286
TESTIMONY WAS COMPELLING, BUT IT

5
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:11,220
WAS ALSO CONFUSING.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,422
AT TIMES IT WAS LIKE WATCHING

7
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,224
PEOPLE'S COURT, RACHEL MITCHELL

8
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,593
ASKING DIRECT QUESTIONS, GETTING

9
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:19,295
DIRECT ANSWERS, AND JUST WHEN IT

10
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,230
WAS GETTING SOMEWHERE, THE

11
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,798
DEMOCRATS WOULD START TALKING.

12
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:25,101
WE'D GO FROM A PROCEDURAL LINE

13
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,802
OF FACT FINDING TO HIGH

14
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:27,470
EMOTIONAL DRAMA.

15
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,372
BUT THEN THIS GUY BROKE THROUGH.

16
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,207
>> I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT

17
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:32,441
YOU HAVE DONE TO THIS GUY.

18
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:36,712
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM

19
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:39,115
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS.

20
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:42,318
THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW.

21
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,519
THIS IS HELL.

22
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,756
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE

23
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:51,661
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME

24
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,461
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS.

25
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:54,864
GREG: HE REMINDS ME WHEN I'M AT

26
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:56,332
THE RENTAL CAR COUNTER AND I

27
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,134
WANTED THE CONVERTIBLE SEBRING,

28
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:00,403
BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY

29
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:01,704
CONVERTIBLES, BUT THAT WAS

30
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:02,038
AMAZING.

31
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,373
ANY WAY, AT THE END OF THIS, DID

32
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:07,310
WE LEARN ANY NEW FACTS ABOUT A

33
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,911
35-YEAR-OLD INCIDENT?

34
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:08,878
LOOK, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT

35
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:09,245
HAPPENED.

36
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,581
I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH

37
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:12,482
KAVANAUGH OR FORD.

38
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:13,349
WILL AN FBI INVESTIGATION GIVE

39
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:15,151
US MORE ANSWERS?

40
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,585
I DON'T KNOW.

41
00:01:15,585 --> 00:01:17,053
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE

42
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:17,787
THEIR STORIES.

43
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:21,958
SO HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW,

44
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,760
POLITICAL TRIBALISM NOW INCLUDES

45
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,894
PUBLIC ACTS OF PERSONAL

46
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,229
DESTRUCTION.

47
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:26,729
IT IS GHULLISH.

48
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,031
THE DEMOCRATS COULD HAVE AVOIDED

49
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,499
THIS SHOW TRIAL BY ACTING

50
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:30,433
IMMEDIATELY WHEN THEY FIRST GOT

51
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,068
THE LETTER INSTEAD OF SITTING ON

52
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,736
IT WHICH LED TO A TWISTED CIRCUS

53
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:35,705
THAT RUINED REPUTATIONS,

54
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:37,106
HUMILIATED VICTIMS AND THEIR

55
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:37,674
FAMILIES.

56
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:39,742
THE LESSON IN POLITICS,

57
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:41,311
COLLATERAL DAMAGE IS NOW TOTALLY

58
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:41,711
ACCEPTABLE.

59
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,480
WHO CARES IF YOU DESTROY A

60
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,982
FAMILY OR TWO, YOU STILL BLOCKED

61
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:47,183
THAT SEAT, GOOD FOR YOU.

62
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,484
WE LOOKED HARD TO FIND A GROUP

63
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,986
OF PEOPLE MORE CIVIL THAN THE

64
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:54,591
HEARINGS.

65
00:01:54,591 --> 00:02:05,668
HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND.

66
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,203
MAYBE IT IS NOT SO BAD, BUT

67
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:10,607
MAYBE MICHAEL MOORE WAS RIGHT

68
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,708
AFTER ALL.

69
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,512
TIME TO MOVE TO CANADA.

70
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,013
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE

71
00:02:17,013 --> 00:02:18,949
HEARINGS IN GENERAL?

72
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,717
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE DOING A

73
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:21,551
WEEK-LONG FBI INVESTIGATION.

74
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,752
GENERAL THOUGHTS ON THIS,

75
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:24,187
MADISON, AS A LAWYER?

76
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,655
>> I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM REALLY

77
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,923
DID SAY IT BEST WHEN HE SAID YOU

78
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:31,628
WANT A FAIR PROCESS, YOU CAME TO

79
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,363
THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME

80
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,531
MY FRIEND.

81
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,265
NOTHING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN

82
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:35,565
FAIR.

83
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,435
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET A SEARCH

84
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:40,270
WARRANT OR ARREST WARRANT FOR

85
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,238
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

86
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:42,906
WE HAVE AN FBI INVESTIGATION.

87
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,809
TAXPAYER MONEY IS FUNDING THAT.

88
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,277
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY MORE

89
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:48,912
INFORMATION IN A WEEK.

90
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,047
I WOULD BET MY LIFE ON THAT.

91
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,982
THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE GOING

92
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:53,083
TO INTERVIEW MR. JUDGE.

93
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,351
HE ALREADY PRESENTED HIS

94
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,519
STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF

95
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:55,953
PERJURY.

96
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:56,687
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO

97
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:58,388
CHANGE HIS STORY.

98
00:02:58,388 --> 00:02:59,523
THAT WOULD BE INSANE.

99
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:00,257
GREG: YEAH.

100
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,858
TYRUS, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

101
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:02,159
THIS?

102
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,993
DO YOU THINK THE TESTIMONY

103
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:03,527
CHANGED ANY MINDS?

104
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,029
>> NO, I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE

105
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,331
WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY NOW.

106
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,000
NOBODY'S MINDS ARE BEING CHANGED

107
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,002
PERIOD ON ANYTHING.

108
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:13,637
I DON'T THINK EITHER WAY BOTH

109
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:14,538
PEOPLE WERE CREDIBLE.

110
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:15,772
I THINK THE CRIME IS THAT THEY

111
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:16,907
JUST HAPPENED TO BE INVOLVED

112
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:17,407
WITH OUR SENATE.

113
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,576
I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.

114
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:19,943
[LAUGHTER]

115
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:21,578
>> I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE.

116
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,146
I THINK THAT IF NEVER THERE WAS

117
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,481
A TIME NOW FOR TERM LIMITS ON

118
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,416
THE SENATE, IT IS NOW.

119
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,552
GREG: UH-HUH.

120
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:29,753
[APPLAUSE]

121
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:34,524
>> WHETHER YOU'RE --

122
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:34,891
[APPLAUSE]

123
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,226
>> WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN

124
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:38,028
OR A DEMOCRAT, ENOUGH.

125
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:41,031
THE FACT IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE

126
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,266
HAVE 51 TO 50 VOTES.

127
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,600
THAT WE HAVE ALL DEMOCRATS ON

128
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,768
ONE SIDE -- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU

129
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,303
ARE ELECTED FOR.

130
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,705
YOUR JOB WAS TO GET THE BEST

131
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:48,472
DEAL FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,

132
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:49,140
NOT YOUR OWN THING.

133
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,741
ALL WE'RE SEEING EVEN AFTER

134
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,043
TODAY WHEN THE DEAL WAS MADE

135
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,110
BASICALLY WE'RE GOING TO PASS

136
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,879
HIM THROUGH, RIGHTFULLY SO,

137
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,613
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

138
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,148
EVIDENCE TO SAY OTHERWISE, AND

139
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:59,283
WE'RE GOING TO STILL DO AN FBI

140
00:03:59,283 --> 00:03:59,717
INVESTIGATION.

141
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:00,184
GREG: UH-HUH.

142
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:02,720
>> SO THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR

143
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,055
THE DEMOCRATS IS TO SHOW OF GOOD

144
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,090
FAITH FOR MEETING THEM HALFWAY

145
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,691
WAS TO VOTE YES.

146
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,325
WE ALL AGREE WE'RE GOING TO VOTE

147
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:09,760
HIM THROUGH AND THEN WE'RE GOING

148
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,294
TO INVESTIGATE IT.

149
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:11,729
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MESSAGE

150
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,031
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE

151
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:17,168
THESE -- BUT NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT

152
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:17,868
THEY REALLY WANT.

153
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:18,702
IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT.

154
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:19,670
IT IS THE CIVIL WAR IN THE

155
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,904
SENATE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

156
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:21,204
WITH.

157
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,441
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

158
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:28,679
WHETHER THIS WOMAN WAS ASSAULTED

159
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,447
OR NOT.

160
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,749
WE BELIEVE BOTH PEOPLE BUT I

161
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:33,718
HAVE TO SAY NO OR YES.

162
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:34,919
REGARDLESS OF YOUR PARTY

163
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,020
AFFILIATION, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,

164
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,588
WE NEED TO START GETTING NEW

165
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:38,322
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN

166
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,090
THERE AND INDEPENDENTS IN THERE

167
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,024
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY

168
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:42,426
GOING TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE AND

169
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:43,427
NOT THEIR SELF.

170
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:44,495
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.

171
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:53,070
[APPLAUSE]

172
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,573
GREG: KAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?

173
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:56,507
>> MY THOUGHTS?

174
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,375
GREG: YES.

175
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:57,842
>> I DON'T KNOW.

176
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:58,443
I DON'T KNOW.

177
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,011
I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE

178
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,813
DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ALL OF THE

179
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:03,915
CERTAINLY MILLIONS IF NOT

180
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:05,216
TRILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH ME

181
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:06,117
AND JUST --

182
00:05:06,117 --> 00:05:06,484
[LAUGHTER]

183
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:06,951
GREG: YEAH.

184
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,853
>> AND THEY DECIDE WHAT TO THINK

185
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,356
BASED ON WHAT I THINK BECAUSE

186
00:05:12,356 --> 00:05:14,892
THEY ADMIRE ME SO MUCH.

187
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:15,259
[LAUGHTER]

188
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,861
>> OH I'VE SEEN IT.

189
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:17,228
[LAUGHTER]

190
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:19,664
>> BUT I REALLY JUST DON'T -- I

191
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,465
DON'T KNOW.

192
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,599
I WASN'T THERE.

193
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,435
I DON'T KNOW.

194
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:25,136
GREG: DO YOU KNOW, KAT?

195
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:26,537
>> SAME AS LAST WEEK I FEEL LIKE

196
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:29,273
I'M WANDERING AROUND IN A FOREST

197
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:30,741
AND I SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE ON

198
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,010
BOTH SIDES WHO CLAIM TO KNOW FOR

199
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,912
SURE AND THEY ARE SO -- ABOUT IT

200
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,514
ON BOTH SIDES AND I THINK THAT A

201
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,183
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DECIDING BASED

202
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,618
ON PARTISANSHIP.

203
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:42,153
THEY ARE NOT DECIDING BASED ON

204
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,721
THE FACTS BECAUSE BASED ON THE

205
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,756
FACTS HOW COULD YOU KNOW.

206
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,391
GREG: NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

207
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,659
>> NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

208
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,595
GREG: THE ONE THING I HAVE

209
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:52,130
LEARNED CHARLIE IS THAT NATURE

210
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,132
OF MEMORY IS IMPERFECT AND WE --

211
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,534
I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY BELIEVE

212
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,436
THEIR STORIES AND BOTH STORIES

213
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,138
ARE PROBABLY FLAWED.

214
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:03,141
BUT I DON'T KNOW TO ECHO KAT,

215
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,308
BUT I DO THINK THAT THE PROGRESS

216
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:07,612
THAT WE'RE MAKING IS IN THE AREA

217
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:09,547
OF UNDERSTANDING MEMORY OVER

218
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,217
TIME, THAT WE HAVE TO START

219
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,351
THINKING ABOUT LIKE WHAT IS TRUE

220
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:14,953
IN SOMEBODY'S HEAD IS NOT TRUE

221
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:15,587
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

222
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,622
>> I DON'T TRUST MY MEMORY FROM

223
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:18,056
THIS MORNING.

224
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,424
GREG: NEITHER DO I.

225
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:20,859
>> MUCH LESS LAST WEEK.

226
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,861
GREG: I HAD TO TELL YOU TO PUT

227
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:23,261
ON PANTS.

228
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:26,298
>> AND I DON'T EVEN DO ANY DRUGS

229
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:26,631
ANYMORE.

230
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,332
GREG: YEAH.

231
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:27,666
ANYMORE.

232
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,501
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS.

233
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:29,901
[LAUGHTER]

234
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,004
>> BUT NO, I WOULD SAY ACTUALLY

235
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,973
I DID CHANGE MY MIND LISTENING

236
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:35,507
TO THE TESTIMONY.

237
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:38,677
GOING IN, I THOUGHT THAT

238
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:41,313
DR. FORD WAS A POLITICAL -- I

239
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,447
THOUGHT SHE WAS POLITICALLY

240
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:42,814
MOTIVATED.

241
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,950
I THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO TAKE

242
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,686
OUT THIS GUY AND DOING

243
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:48,687
EVERYTHING THAT SHE COULD TO

244
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:51,022
JUST -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THE

245
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,892
FIRST TIME SHE EVER UTTERED HIS

246
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:54,993
NAME TO ANYBODY WAS AFTER HE HAD

247
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:56,695
BEEN FLOATED AS A POTENTIAL

248
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:57,362
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.

249
00:06:57,362 --> 00:06:58,430
LISTENING TO HER TESTIMONY, I

250
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,499
FOUND IT RIVETING AND I FOUND IT

251
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:05,103
TOTALLY BELIEVABLE AND I CAME

252
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,538
AWAY THINKING MY GOODNESS

253
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,372
OBVIOUSLY THIS WOMAN IS NOT WHO

254
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:07,906
I THOUGHT SHE WAS.

255
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,474
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, NOT

256
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,710
TO DO EXACTLY WHAT TYRUS SAID,

257
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,512
HE'S SICK AND TIRED OF, BUT THEN

258
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,213
YOU LISTEN TO BRETT KAVANAUGH

259
00:07:15,213 --> 00:07:17,949
AND WHAT HE SAID, AND I TOTALLY

260
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:18,383
BELIEVED HIM.

261
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:18,817
GREG: YEAH.

262
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:20,619
>> AT THIS POINT YOU CAN'T PROVE

263
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:20,886
IT.

264
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:21,953
YOU CAN'T KNOW.

265
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,455
SO ALL YOU CAN DO THEN IS

266
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:25,157
EVALUATE ALL THE OTHER EVIDENCE.

267
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:25,690
GREG: RIGHT.

268
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,192
>> WHEN YOU EVALUATE ALL THE

269
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,995
OTHER EVIDENCE, NO RATIONAL

270
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,497
PERSON CAN COME DOWN ON ANY

271
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,265
DECISIONS BUT THAT THEY DIDN'T

272
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:33,832
PROVE THEIR CASE.

273
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:34,766
GREG: RIGHT.

274
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:35,734
>> ONE THING I WOULD SAY THAT'S

275
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:36,735
DIFFERENT TODAY AND I THINK IT

276
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,738
IS A VERY GOOD THING IN AMERICA,

277
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:40,873
THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY, 30

278
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:44,009
YEARS AGO -- OR 20 YEARS AGO,

279
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,878
BILL CLINTON WOULD HAVE SENT HIS

280
00:07:45,878 --> 00:07:48,180
WAR DOGS OUT TO CALL HER TRAILER

281
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,515
TRASH AND SAY THAT OH YEAH YOU

282
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:50,449
CAN BRING -- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN

283
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,150
GET ANYBODY TO SAY ANYTHING, YOU

284
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,652
JUST DRAG A $20 BILL THROUGH A

285
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:54,119
TRAILER PARK.

286
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:55,687
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE NOW.

287
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:56,488
GREG: YEAH, YEAH.

288
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:59,158
>> THIS WOMAN, WHETHER

289
00:07:59,158 --> 00:07:59,958
REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, BY IN

290
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,859
LARGE, YOU CAN'T FIND A SINGLE

291
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,494
PERSON ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE

292
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,930
WHO TRASHED HER OR DID ANYTHING

293
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,333
BUT SAID WE WANT TO HEAR HER

294
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:07,599
OUT.

295
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,168
IT WAS TOTALLY RESPECTFUL.

296
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,170
AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS

297
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,238
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CLINTON

298
00:08:13,238 --> 00:08:14,373
YEARS WHEN PAULA JONES WAS

299
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:17,643
CALLED TRAILER TRASH AND A LIAR.

300
00:08:17,643 --> 00:08:19,912
GREG: RIGHT.

301
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:20,279
[APPLAUSE]

302
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,547
>> I HAVE A QUESTION, GREG.

303
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:25,117
YOU NEVER GET ASKED QUESTIONS

304
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:26,251
BUT I HAVE QUESTION FOR YOU

305
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,052
BESIDES YOU ARE ALWAYS NEGATIVE

306
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,520
TO ME ON THE MONOLOGUE, BUT

307
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,888
FORGET THAT.

308
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:31,056
IS IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GOES

309
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,157
BACK TO THE LEAK FOR ME REAL

310
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:32,457
QUICK.

311
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:33,392
GREG: YEAH.

312
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:36,528
>> IS IT POSSIBLE THAT FEINSTEIN

313
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:39,498
SAT ON THIS BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T

314
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:40,631
THINK IT HAD ENOUGH CREDIBILITY?

315
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:43,669
GREG: FEINSTEIN IS DENYING IT

316
00:08:43,669 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT SHE LEAKED IT.
