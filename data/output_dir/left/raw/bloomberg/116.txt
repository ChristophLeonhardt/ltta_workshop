1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
This is Monsanto’s RoundUp.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,029
It’s in cookies, breads, corn, crackers,
chips, breakfast cereals, and beer.

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:11,019
The list goes on, and on, and on.

4
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,630
The active ingredient in RoundUp is called
glyphosate, and it’s used by backyard gardeners

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,100
and industrial farmers alike to kill invasive
weeds.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,170
And whether glyphosate is harmful to humans
or not is something of a 66 billion dollar

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,180
question

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,040
But first: What is glyphosate?

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,260
Commercial: There’s never been a herbicide
like it before.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,399
Glyphosate was originally introduced in 1974
by Monsanto.

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,530
Its use in American agriculture has soared
nearly tenfold since Monsanto introduced the

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,839
first genetically-modified RoundUp Ready seeds
in 1996.

13
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:48,699
Glyphosate is now used in more than 160 countries,
with more than 1.4 billion pounds applied

14
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:49,699
per year.

15
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,969
And while Monsanto lost patent protection
over glyphosate herbicides in 2000, the company

16
00:00:54,969 --> 00:01:00,239
still has about 40 percent of the 8 billion
dollar global herbicide market because of

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,049
what is called the “virtuous cycle”:

18
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:08,719
Monsanto sells its genetically modified RoundUp-ready
seeds to produce cotton, corn and other commodities

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,119
to make them resistant to glyphosate’s herbicidal
effects.

20
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,509
More sales of the GMO seeds beget more use
of Roundup; more herbicide use drives up demand

21
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:19,710
for Monsanto's GMO seeds.

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,270
For 25 years that cycle has enjoyed an unblemished
run in our crops, soil, and food.

23
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,810
Until now.

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,020
Now Monsanto has its own invasive species
creeping in: Doubt.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,130
On its website, Monsanto says glyphosate is
“about half as toxic as table salt and more

26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,460
than 25 times less toxic than caffeine."

27
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,429
More than 1,000 farmers and herbicide applicators
stricken with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma disagree.

28
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:51,710
Hundreds of plaintiffs with cancer have filed
a class-action lawsuit against the company.

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,049
In 2015, the International Agency for Research
on Cancer, known as IARC, determined glyphosate

30
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,069
to be a “probable carcinogen”.

31
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,860
Remember that 66 billion dollars?

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,100
That’s where this comes in: It’s how much
Bayer is offering to buy Monsanto for, but

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
if glyphosate is thought of as cancer-causing,
it may back out of the deal completely.

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,650
But what would life without glyphosate look
like?

35
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,260
According to Bloomberg agriculture expert
Christopher Perrella, it wouldn’t be pretty.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,150
Perrella: The alternative would be a step
back.

37
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,560
And it would definitely affect farmers, income
their profitability, the way they do business.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,209
Eventually filters down to the consumer in
terms of higher prices for meats… for all

39
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,620
food products.

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,790
The question now, after the EPA's own hand-picked
experts have also voiced concerns, is what

41
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,140
the Trump EPA will do about it.

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,060
But with administrations from Clinton to Bush
to Obama promoting GMOs, it seems unlikely

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:00:00,000
Trump’s EPA will be any different.
