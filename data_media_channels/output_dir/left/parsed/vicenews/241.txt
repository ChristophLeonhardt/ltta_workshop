I mean there are thousands of families
who are desperately searching for any
signs of their loved ones who were taken
by the Islamic state do you have any
regrets over the level of executions
torturing the headings that took place
there Islamic state police force or the
judicial system to know exactly the most
transparent in terms of what happens to
the person after arrest and do you
denounce that now denounce what God's it
or do you denounce the fact that there
were countless executions and beheadings
taking place under the Islamic state I
support Islamic law fully anything from
God's law I support 100%
