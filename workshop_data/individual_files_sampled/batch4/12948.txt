today the New York Times tore into Donald Trump's racist attacks on judge Gonzalo Curiel instead of attacking curial for his association with a pro illegal immigration organization Trump went directly at Carole's ethnicity you'll remember he claimed that his Mexican parentage he was born in Indiana made him unfit to serve as a judge on the Trump University case here is the New York Times quote federal judges have repeatedly and emphatically refused to recuse themselves from cases because of their race or ethnicity these rulings were driven by two realizations ethnically based challenges would reduce every judge to a racial category which would be racist and such challenges would make judges vulnerable to recusal motions for reasons of race ethnicity gender or religion in every case that came before them once it started the ethnic cleansing of the court system could be made to apply to any unpopular group at any time mr. Trump is essentially arguing that his own bigoted attitude toward Mexicans has disqualified a respected jurist from hearing a court case in which he is a defendant ok that's basically right but we must ask did the New York Times just realize that discrimination for or against people on the basis of race is racist see here's the thing I understand why people like many people on the right are upset with Trump we think that ethnicity and race are completely irrelevant to your quality as a human being we don't care whether your parents were Mexican or Irish or Armenian or Jewish we only care whether you're a good human being doing good things the Left doesn't hold by that same standard the left constantly suggests white cops can't make objectively decent police decisions in minority communities and when President Obama nominated now Justice Sonia Sotomayor news quickly broke of a lecture she'd given in 2001 in which she labelled herself better qualified for the judiciary because she was quote a wise Latina woman this is racism ethnicity doesn't make you a better judge but it was one of the chief qualifiers for that same New York Times which defended Sotomayor s comments and excoriated her critics here's what the Times wrote all the way back then quote the first Hispanic nominee to the court is being called racist she's being attacked as not smart enough as too abrasive a description often applied to women who speak their minds in public life there have even been reports that critics have taken aim at her taste for Puerto Rican food the context matters she was pointing out throughout history even esteemed white male justices like Oliver Wendell Holmes voters Webb hold race and sex discrimination she said accidents of birth inform people's views but judges must strive to look beyond them some of judges sewed my ORS detractors seem uncomfortable with her Puerto Rican heritage so in other words according to the New York Times racism is totally cool when it comes from the left when you use diversity as code for ethnic cleansing of light people like Oliver Wendell Holmes from the judiciary but when it's the reverse then it has to be called out it should be called out in both of these cases racism is bad gang there are those like racist pans or Pat Buchanan he thinks the left's racism justifies his own and so he justifies Donald Trump's comments on these grounds he quotes he says quote too many liberals all white southern males are citizens under eternal suspicion of being racists the most depressing thing about this episode is to see Republicans rushing to stomp on Trump to show the left how well they've mastered that a liberal catechism fighting racism is not a liberal catechism gang it's the right thing to do but because there are racists on both sides racism is now returning with a vengeance Pat Buchanan's what's good for them is good for us revenge racism and the left's diversity over merit racism all of this is ugly and all of it ought to be fought I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so last night Hillary Clinton locked up the number of Delegates that she's going to need in order for her to be the nominee and she's very very excited about it nobody else is particularly excited about it the excitement is gone the thrill is gone for Hillary when she keeps saying this is a historic moment all I can think of is well so was the Hindenburg but that wasn't that great here's Hillary Clinton ripping on Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders by the way says I don't trust any of these counts we're going all the way to the convention and Hillary basically says you don't understand math and he says well yeah that's why I'm a socialist Hillary said here's what Hillary says about about Bernie Sanders when senator Sanders has been essentially warning the network's warning journalists that they shouldn't declare the nomination clinched tomorrow even if you do cross the delegate threshold because he says the super-delegates can't really be counted until they vote at the convention obviously as you just explained that was not your calculus in 2008 when the race was even closer than it is now what's your reaction to him casting the race that way does that frustrate you I find it perplexing what he basically seems to be saying is that the will of the people should be overturned I have this very substantial lead in the popular vote more than 3 million votes that means more than 3 million Democrats and others voting and democratic contests have chosen me I have a very significant lead in pledged delegates he's basically seems to be suggesting that super-delegates should overturn the will of the people that is just hard for me to understand it's never happened before it's not going to happen this time okay so she's right actually when she says that Sanders is dismissing the quote-unquote will of the people I do want to point out that will of the people is a malleable term as we've noticed it was the will of the people that Donald Trump be the nominee with 42% of the popular vote it's the will of the people that Hillary Clinton be the nominee with a majority of the vote it's it's the will of the people that Bernie Sanders be the nominee because he's got more enthusiasm the will of the people doesn't mean anything all that means anything is the actual number of votes that are counted and so when people say will of the people you should search for your wallet a little bit it's it's very rare that there is one single will of the people it really is just an excuse for for a sort certain sort to say I deserve power right I channel the will of the people there is no single will of the people people have various different wills it's one of the reasons for small government it's one of the reasons that a small government is a good thing because if the government is small presumably this allows you to have your own will there's no grand will of the people that must be enacted by any particular politician Hillary is very excited nonetheless she says this is a historic moment here we are it's a historic moment and that face in that camera growling at that camera whoa here we go I've seen it for more than a year my supporters are passionate they are committed they have voted for me in great numbers across our country for many reasons but among those reasons is their belief that having a woman president will make a great statement a historic statement about what kind of country we are what we stand for it's really emotional and I am someone who has been very touched and really encouraged by this extraordinary conviction that people have it's predominantly women and girls but not exclusively men bring their daughters to meet me and tell me that they are supporting me because of their daughters okay so this is it this is all you can trip Donald Trump for saying that Mexican judges are going to be biased against him if you're willing to say Hillary is a better president because she has of a whoo-hoo right it doesn't work that way you don't get to have it both ways by the way no one is excited about Hillary being the first female president no one this idea that there are masses of women out there like yay first female president they don't exist okay there there are a few of them I'm sure they're all in Hollywood and they all pat themselves on the back for how wonderful they are but they're not real there's no broad movement and by the way this idea that women are somehow out of power in politics fifty five percent of the electorate is female okay four more women than men vote in the United States so this whole thing men control politics well ladies that's your fault then because you're the ones who are voting you're voting for greater numbers than we are and by the way that you've been voting lately you're making a big batch of it so you might want to reconsider this whole women have it better when you elect President Obama twice and now you're gonna elect Hillary Clinton so Hillary says all that she also says she's excited about having President Obama's support it's all very exciting I want to point out here that the media have now made clear what we all knew they were going to do so what the media said early on is they said Donald's from we're gonna cover him we're gonna cover and there's this baseline assumption by members of the Republican Party that they were going to that the media was gonna treat Trump fairly in a general election didn't know it was never going to happen the media has passed the point where they got to nominate the Republican nominee Donald Trump and they got to nominate the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and now they're coming out in force so I want to show you some questions that were asked to hello pregnant and Clinton at this is this press gaggle I just want to show you the questions this is clip 24 it's it's amazing listen to the questions that are being asked by the press they finally get a chance to ask a felon questions right and instead of asking her about her felonies or instead of asking her about her her vague policies instead of asking her about Libya and said of asking her about a thousand things here is what they asked Hillary Clinton and this is the sounds exactly like a Sports press gaggle after somebody throws the winning touchdown how did it feel to throw that winning touchdown what do you think they're gonna say it felt terrible you know it made me really remember the plight of the suffering in China well what do you think she's gonna say but here's how the media are really gonna treat Hillary Clinton all the way through it's one of the reasons why Donald Trump is just a big middle finger to everything one of the reasons that Donald Trump is a big middle finger to the media is because of stuff like this here's how the media treat Hillary Clinton you're on the cusp of being the first female nominee of a major party what does that mean to you and how are you reflecting on that no matter what happens tomorrow Bernie Sanders has said the convention of Philadelphia will be contested do you think there's anything you can do to change that at this point is it setting in that might be making serious some prominent Democrats are not saying we maybe need to reevaluate the super delegate system more broadly irrespective of what happens in this primary to support looking into that and perhaps getting rid of them last night we need to exchange in Sacramento there was a woman standing next to me who was absolutely solving and she said you know it's time it's past time and you see the women you see people here and people just come up to you and and they they get tears in their eyes right do you feel do you feel the weight of what this move women were sobbing sobbing do you feel the weight of history on you Winston Churchill do you feel like this is just like when they were fighting the Nazis and there you are with your hoo-hoo waving it around telling everybody that you deserve to be President these kind of questions from the press make everyone wants you start vomiting and never stop vomiting it becomes that jiff from from Team America where you think there's the long vomit scene and just keeps vomiting and vomiting or like The Exorcist where everyone's head swivels around and they vomit in 360 degrees this is this is this is why people say well a few Trump this is why because the media is so horrible at all of this they're just horrible and they're terrible in every way now with that said with that said here is the person you chose to go up against Hillary Clinton so I'm about to say the four words that some people say they hate to say these four words these are actually my four favorite words in the English language because it proves to you you should continue to listen to me and also you should take what I say seriously because I am almost invariably correct so here it is I told you so so back in March I wrote a piece in the Jewish Journal we talked about it at the time in which I explained why Donald Trump had risen to power what was driving all of this and one of the factors that I named was Donald Trump's take on American exceptionalism so what I said now I want to read you the section from from this piece so let me let me grab that really quickly if the internet will will cooperate so what what Donald Trump said is so what so what I said about American exceptionalism I said wrote this go direct quote ok back March a second in his own way Donald Trump believes in American exceptionalism much like Barack Obama does as a term to describe a parochial patriotism Obama infamously remarked in 2009 I believe in American exceptionalism just as I suspect the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believed in Greeks ilysm obama meant that dismissively american exceptionalism is just something we do because we're American not because we're actually special Trump means it proudly his nationalism is a reaction to Obama's anti nationalism it says Barack Obama may think America isn't worthy of special protection because we're not special well we're America dammit even if we don't know what makes us special according to trump we ought to operate off the assumption that Americans deserve better lives not because they live out better principles or represent a better system but because they're here the Republican Party has stood for embrace of anyone who will embrace American values extreme European right-wing parties tend to embrace people out of ethnic Allegiance rather than ideological allegiance Trump uncomfortably straddles that divide yes that's what I said about Obama about Trump's take on American exceptionalism he doesn't know what makes America exceptional he doesn't know right he thinks that what makes America exceptional is that we are rich ready that we're successful this is what I said about Trump right and people oh no he knows what American exceptionalism he knows what it here is visit April 2015 has now been uncovered by Mother Jones here is Donald Trump being asked specifically specifically about American exceptionalism here is Donald Trump's answer here we go define American exceptionalism does American exceptionalism still exist and what do we do to grow American exceptionally ok well I don't like the term I'll be honest with you and I'll people who say oh he's not paid right look if I'm a Russian or I'm a German or if I'm a person we do business with why you know I don't think it's very nice Jeremy we're exceptional you're not first of all German is eating our lunch so they say why you except sure we're doing a lot better than you I never liked the term and perhaps that's because I don't have a very big ego or not or any terms like that but honestly when you're doing business I mean I watch Obama everyone so I'll say American exceptional service of all I don't like the term because we're dealing for I want to take everything back from the world that we've given them we've given them so much on top of taking it back I don't want to say we're exceptional we're more except essentially you're saying we're more we're more outstanding than you by the way you've been eating our lunch for the twenty years but we're more exceptional than you I don't like the term I never liked it when I see these politicians get up with the American exceptionalism and we're dying we owe 18 trillion in debt I'd like to make us exceptional and I'd like to talk later instead of now does that make any sense because I think you're insulting the world doing something you like this is your money no Jim if you German or if you're from Japan or you're from China you don't want to have people saying that right I never liked the expression okay so and I see a lot of paper to talk about America you can think it but I don't think we should say it we may have a chance to say it they're not too distant future but even then I wouldn't say it because when I take back the jobs and when I take back all that money and we get to all US I'm not gonna rub it in what's that rub it in let's not rub it in but I never liked that term okay that's an amazing statement what makes America exceptional and would be true whether we were poor whether we're rich what makes Americans that because of these values we are rich but Trump doesn't understand that what makes America exceptional is the basic idea that government is there to protect your rights but not to violate them and that as soon as government violates your rights it loses all ability to be government and that that violation of rights is unjustified under natural or godly law that's the basic idea of American exceptionalism right that you have inalienable rights as a human being as expressed in the Declaration of Independence you can't get rid of them there's no way to get rid of them and if government violates those rights government has done something deeply wrong and in order to preserve those rights we've instituted a system of checks and balances so that the government cannot become overweening and violate your ability to live as you see fit that's what makes America exceptional ISM not rich not richness not not well there are plenty of wealthy empires in history lots of them the Roman Empire the British Empire the Chinese now are gaining wealth that does not make them exceptional what makes us exceptional is the ideas behind the declaration that we're the only country in history founded on an idea not founded just on board it's not founded just cuz we're there but founded on an actual idea and that's an amazing thing that's that's what makes us unique but Trump doesn't understand that Trump thinks the only thing that would make us unique is if we're rich and the people here were unique because were here misleads to the sort of nativism and this idea that only he personally can make America great again when he says make America great again he doesn't mean return to founding principles he means make us economically powerful again and you should have unlimited power to do that should have unlimited power to do that which is why Mitch McConnell is out there even Mitch McConnell who now endorses him is out there saying things like Donald Trump has to learn not to be a dictator that's scary stuff right I mean that's truly frightening stuff is that that's what Mitch McConnell is saying but it's also why Donald Trump is happy to threaten people it's why he when people say he's a proto-fascist like Andrew Clavin says he's a proto-fascist it Springs from this idea right the only way to make America great again is to hand a multimap our America's ideals aren't great only America is great in competition with others he says I want to take back everything we gave to the world wait you mean like freedom would you like to take that back would you like to take back world war two where we granted your up freedom would you like to take back the Cold War are we granted half the world freedom would you like to take all that back this is scary stuff folks and it doesn't get better just because Trump is saying it this is what I hate about the Trump movement I've been saying it all along Trump backing Trump is going to pervert conservatism and it's not if Trump wins it's the movement itself is perverting conservatism and this is what's happening in real time every day right now people are gonna look at this and if Obama had said this they would have said this is egregious this is unpatriotic it's unamerican Trump says it well you know nothing really makes America great nothing makes America great its ideas don't make America great and Trump says that in order to in order to exercise this power he basically needs to be able to intimidate anyone so David French who announced yesterday he's not gonna be running for president which makes me sad I would have gladly voted for David French the columnist for National Review Trump apparently had his surrogates or supporters threatened David French's wife and this is okay with everybody here's David French on MSNBC explaining it was that someone from the Trump campaign you said called someone have your wife's baby identified they identified themselves as someone affiliated with the Trump campaign who had been told to call you know a member of my they track down a member of my wife's family in Tennessee while all of this is going on and I you know I only learned about it later it you know I consider that a threat I considered it a ham-handed effort to intimidate me ham-handed effort to intimidate their calling wife and threatening people it's just it's amazing and that's okay with the Trump people because we need someone tough we need to make America great again again what makes America great is the principles that you guys are discarding this is why people say well we don't need an ideologue no we do we need an i you all gone behalf of what made America great in the first place we don't need someone to come along and say all power vested in me will make your life great again that is unamerican forget on American it's not conservative forget not conservative it's not right it's not moral and it's not true okay that's what that's what really the problem is so that being said it doesn't matter what's happening is the perversion of the conservative movement you're watching as people get sucked into the gaping maw of trumpism and there be it's like the Sarlacc and in Return of the Jedi I mean they're just they're just falling in there and it doesn't matter they thought they were allied with the Sarlacc right I mean Jabba thought he was allied with the Sarlacc didn't matter all the people are falling off a Java ship right into the middle of the Sarlacc right he's just eaten all of them and and that weird tongue thing is sneaking around people's legs and dragging them down right so Donald Trump is is dragging everybody down so in the last week what that's meant is his Mexican comment right you can't be a judge on his case if you're Mexican it turns out not only can you not be a judge on his case if you're Mexican you also can't be a judge on his case if you're a woman so Katrina Pierson who is his spokeswoman she's asked hey Trump says Mexican judges will be will be mean to him does this also hold true of female judges and here's Katrina Pierson just sticking her face right in the mud pie that is the Trump campaign here she is you know Donald Trump's sister is a federal judge in New York if somebody were to say to her she was biased in regards to some sort of case because she's a woman that would deal that would be awful wouldn't it well it would depend on her past and the decisions that she's made as a judge there is no question that there are activist judges in this country CNN gives a platform to black lives matter and their entire premise it's injustice in the system do tourette okay so she says they're sort of what she means which is it may be women judges are gonna be but it's dead so basically identity politics all the way through maybe maybe female judges won't like Donald Trump either now that's not totally what she's saying she's sort of saying there could be situations in which being a female bias you why I mean this is identity politics at its finest Donald Trump even is trying to walk this back a little bit but it's it's too little too late here's Donald Trump now saying he doesn't care if the judge was Mexican after spending a week saying he cares if the judge is Mexican she has a tape of her saying great things and she has a written statement signed by her saying great things and the judge dismissed her from the case but left the case stayed we thought we're going to win the case I don't care if the judge is Mexican or not I'm gonna do great with the Mexican people because I provide job so I don't care about Mexican but we're being treated very unfairly built very very unfairly okay so he says he doesn't care whether the judge is Mexican anymore now the media are totally on the attack against Trump now because now they're unleashing the Beast the problem I have and this is what makes me so sad about all of this makes me so sad the media are despicable I play to that clip of the questions they're asking Hillary Clinton Oh Hillary how historic is it that you're gonna be the nominee does this make you more or less historic than Jesus are you actually going to ascend to heaven after you become president or will we have to wait till you're on your deathbed and then you'll bless us and God will kiss you and take your soul like you did to Moses how exactly is all this going to go will you get on a chariot like Elijah and rise to heaven that's how they ask questions to Hillary Clinton and then they attack Donald Trump right and so the double standard is there and the double standard is terrible there's only one problem when they attack Donald Trump I can't stop it folks I can't stop it because these attacks are legit these attacks are legit it's illegitimate that they're defending Hillary Clinton but it's totally legit the way they're going after Donald Trump now this doesn't mean that they're not that they're not hypocrites right Joe Scarborough is a perfect example of a hypocrite here's Joe Scarborough on MSNBC today saying that the Republican Party really has to call out Donald Trump it's imperative that they call out Donald Trump on this Mexican judge thing Republicans in Washington DC right now you are letting your presumptive nominee who is making racist statements run roughshod over what remaining national reputation we have as a National Party you have to start calling him out today this is not where you can do the slow boil you have to start calling him out and saying you're going to retract your endorsement of him today or else the United States Senate is in danger Kelly Ayotte C is in danger Rob Portman seat is in danger Ron Johnson seat is in danger super tick he's super ticked off okay flashback to about a month ago here's Joe Scarborough talking about how anyone ripping on Donald Trump is the flashback clip anyone ripping on town'll Trump's hard to tell he's wearing exactly it's it okay is is is is in the wrong here that we all have to just accept Trump so few things are insulting to me but it's insulting to me is you can't state politically obvious things right without people saying oh you're the tank for Trump or oh you're supporting Trump or oh no no no we just can actually look at the earth and see that the Sun Goes Down and that it's actually not flat but there been a lot of flat earthers out there for nine months right now who have been to writing stories of the mainstream media writing stories non-stop that Donald Trump will never win he's a fool he's an idiot then when it looks like he could win he's a Nazi he's a fascist I think it was Robert Reich issue came to Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin which is pretty good you can find that that's about 50 million deaths between them all I guess it's because it's not funny but it said no I guess it's just because I mean you think about it Donald Trump is still friends with Omarosa which TV Guide once listed is one of the top 60 villains in television history so I suppose there's a reason I suppose there is a reason why people could draw the conclusion between Trump and Hitler because vomer oh it was nice to Rosie either so maybe that's the Stalin things don't we killed 30 million of his own people so maybe there's that connection I don't really know okay but you're a little put me out okay just Scarborough let me just say this to you okay this is absurd this is absurd okay Joe Scarborough a month ago was saying you can't call him bad names up calling him bad names it's terrible today how dare you not call Donald Trump bad names you knew who he was all along you terrible people this is the game the media been playing all along the game the media it was we're gonna suck you in by pretending the Donald Trump is an exception to our let's kill the Republican rule and then it turns out he's not an exception he is the he's the example par excellence he's example par excellence of how we are going to tear somebody apart watch Anderson Cooper rip apart Jeffery Lord who's a trump campaign spokesman straight from straight from the tales of the Crypt talking about this Mexican judge here's the Anderson Cooper who looks large like a wolf's husky and/or Jamie Lee Curtis I talking to Jeffery Lord think about what you're saying is you're not talking about what Donald Trump said identifying this guy as Mexican when in fact he's not Mexican E's American born in Indiana and I mean that his Mexican heritage impacting and determining how he can rule because of that identity politics correct correct Anderson I'm talking about it because this is the issue that this goes far beyond Trent University this goes to pointing appointing people to the bench and having a legal system where everybody is supposed to be judged by their skin color so their ethnic heritage Donald Trump is simply picking this up and saying okay if that's the way you're going then this guy should be okay I mean you're doing backflips here to interpret something Donald Trump by identifying him as Mexican and not in not even in Mexican heritage by labeling him by saying he's actually commenting on identity politics of others Anderson Anderson the judge goes out of his way to identify himself as Latino the judge does it that's like playing a judge who's part of a public organization or a Jewish organization Jewish judges not be able on the bench Muslim judges which were in apparently they can I am saying if they if they are if they are belonging to organizations that are explicitly about race and bringing race into the judicial system instead of the Constitution that's the problem and that has been going on for a long time justice Sotomayor and her wise latina mark but again Ramar you had a no comment this judge has actually made you're just linking him to what another to a Latina judge because what they all think philosophy large okay so is period giant fail dry and fail epic fail so he's trying to make the argument that I made in the introduction here which is that leftist have been playing this game all along the problem is he's trying to justify Trump for doing exactly the same thing and it just doesn't work and the media is tearing people apart over this and you can see the Republicans are now in full-on faceplant mode okay they've now realized too late that they are the wrong end of the human centipede here the Donald Trump's at the head and that there's a whole line of people and that human centipede and it's really horrifying that's that's what they are now beginning to realize there's a whole chain of people who are doing this now so Harry Reid comes out he says Mitch McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader he's spineless for not standing up to Donald Trump I can't argue against this and Harry Reid is one of the worst people in the history of American politics here's Harry Reid Senator McConnell and all congressional Republicans leaders have never taken stand against Trump's well rhetoric that's because the hate emanating from Trump's mouth reflects the report Republican Party's agenda here in the United States Senate for the last seven and a half years the agenda that Senator McConnell himself promoted four years Senate McConnell and other Republican leaders embraced the dark settlements within their party the Republican Party made had a woman and a Latino and him Muslim and immigrant and I'm the Obama policies the norm Trump is the largest the ramen have been saying this is what they're gonna do this is what they're gonna do everything that Trump represents is now when we smeared all over conservatism so you oppose you oppose illegal immigration you must be a Trumpkin who thinks Mexican judges shouldn't sit on the bench you think that a bad idea to publicly fund Planned Parenthood it's because you must think all women are ugly and or pieces of ass right that everything Trump does you break it you bought it and now you own it now you own it and watch Mitch McConnell try to run headlong from this Mitch McConnell tries to tries to run so fast from this and again problem is that Mitch McConnell can only move at the speed of a turtle and so here is Mitch McConnell trying to run from this how do you react to the people who say that you as the majority leader of the Senate something you wanted and you got and and John Boehner the Speaker of the House that you two are in in large part responsible if you will for the rise of Donald Trump my answer that's nonsense responsible for the rise no you are because your spec lessness in the face of Obama led people to get angry and then they reacted to you by getting the guy who's out of the box and says crazy things and then you backed him and then you backed him ready you can't you can't say I'm back in that guy Mitch McConnell is in this really awkward position now because if he doesn't back Donald Trump openly then Trump's Mattson and this is exactly what happened by the way Mitch McConnell came out he condemned Trump's Mexican remarks and the initial response of the Trump campaign was to rip on Mitch McConnell right this is the way that this works now you're now in the rear I warned you folks you get in the passenger seat with Trump and from drives you toward that cliff like like it and like in rebel without a cause okay you're going over that cliff with him whether you like it or not doesn't matter how loud you scream at him doesn't matter how often you tell him to turn that car around or put it in reverse or hit the brakes he ain't gonna do it you're in the car with him you're in the car with him okay you're on the Trump train and it's headed for Eastwood ravine like in Back to the Future 3 that's where we're going now and it's a little amusing I gotta be honest it's a little amusing because there are two groups of people here when I feel a little bad for one I don't people I feel kind of bad for are the people who say well you know Trump is that I didn't vote for him the primaries and I opposed him in the primaries now we're stuck what we want Hillary okay nobody wants Hillary everybody thinks this is terrible understood I feel bad for some of those folks then there's the second group of people who are pushing Trump all along and Mike Huckabee's of the world I don't feel bad for you one iota you own it I hope you enjoy this I don't feel bad for Mitch McConnel cuz Mitch McConnell could have come out in favor of Ted Cruz he didn't so could Paul Ryan he didn't he all had the ability to try and come out against Donald Trump instead you sat still in you sat on your hands cuz you didn't want to take people off and now here you are on national television having to answer questions about whether Mexicans should be allowed on the bench not even Mexicans Americans who are born in America and the parents happen to be Mexican extraction whether they should be allowed on the bench and it's awkward for you I understand but it's delicious for me because you have this coming so here's Mike Huckabee who is basically Trump's egor at this point and he's got nothing going on in his life so he's saying that the establishment GOP like Mitch McConnell they can't stand in front of Trump they're just lucky we're not executing them Republicans did that and they're getting what they justly deserve they're getting spanked and they need to be happy they're only getting spanked and not executed because there is seething rage on in the country for those who have fought to help some of these guys get elected and they get there and they surrendered to Obama and people are sick of it and I think that's why we've seen the spirit of this election and frankly Donald Trump gives me great comfort I tell people I don't have any hesitation going out there and genuinely supporting supporting Donald Trump he does have any hesitation whatsoever general and by the way anyone who opposes Trump should basically be executed so that's good stuff that's that's really I think and by the way in this interview you couldn't tell because he's not speaking the person he's talking to Sean Hannity the official press secretary for the for the Trump campaign Bill O'Reilly who is the deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign he came out and he says that you know Trump says that this this this judge should be recused should not be able to be on this case because from says he's a Mexican and therefore now he's tainted here's bill at Bill O'Reilly agrees with Trump he agrees with Trump in other words Donald Trump says I want this guy to recuse himself note Donald Trump's attorneys have not have not filed a motion for accusal because there's no basis for it here's Bill O'Reilly saying the judge to recuse himself anyway just because Trump wants him to recuse himself the Trump you case is certainly political to some extent and it's a very high-profile situation because of that talking points believes the judge should recuse himself not because he did anything he didn't but to eliminate any doubt as to the motivation in court rulings oh my god there are plenty of federal judges I could immediately step in it is valid that some may see any recusal as caving to intimidation but stark justice in a case this important Trump's pardon upon okay any theoretical so so stark justice by the by back stark justice he means what Donald Trump says right because start justice demands that a judge should not be removed from a case unless you have actual reason to remove him other than you don't like the color of his skin right that's what stark justice would demand but here's Bill O'Reilly out there defending him Trump by the way is you you you wonder why he's defending Donald Trump the reason he's defending Donald Trump is because Donald Trump and Bill O'Reilly I like this they're tight right they have milkshakes together Trump actually was on O'Reilly's show last night and he openly implied that O'Reilly had sent him questions before the interview to tell him what he was going to ask him about the Boston Globe yesterday writes that you pay men in your campaign a third more in salary than you pay women and this goes back to my theme that this is what you're going to be confronted with number one is that true do you pay men 1/3 more than women in your campaign the answer is no and I just had to check because I heard this was going to be a question I don't know I have a good source and somebody said that this could be a question I just checked it bill and the answer is no okay so yeah I wonder why these defenders are defending a megyn kelly who is whose back to going after Trump when he's being dishonest which he's been doing for she's the only one on Fox or one of the few Bret bear has been doing it there are a few others Dana Perino has been doing it here's megyn kelly 'some macking bill o'reilly over this whole thing even some pundits are demanding that judge kerry l stepped down to eliminate doubts as to his motivations but that is not the way our system works judges must indeed avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest but litigants do not get to create that appearance by vocally complaining about the judge any litigant who moved to disqualify a judge based on his heritage would actually be sanctioned punished by any and it's happened in the past rightfully moreover if a litigant making a stink about a judge necessarily resulted in a conflict that would force the judge to step down it would lead to chaos in our court system it would prejudice the other party who's not complaining or taking their licks and would lead to more parties throwing fits in order to bounce judges off the case whose rulings they do not love you so of course everything maybe Kelly says right here is totally true this is all totally true but it doesn't matter now everybody's been forced between this rock in this hard place and you can see it all over the news today everybody is having to answer questions about Donald Trump's stupidity so remember when there was Todd akin back in the 2012 election cycle and Todd akin was this guy who was running for Senate in Missouri and he made a comment about how if a woman was legitimately raped or some I'm forcibly raped I think was the language that he used that that she wouldn't get pregnant there the women have magical uterus is that reject rape sperm or some such nonsense and everybody ran for the hills from him oh my god everyone's gonna be tired with this imagine Todd akin being a thousand times worse and running for president that's what you've got now so Jeff Sessions who's on the Trump campaign raised his immigration guy he was just asked like literally just a few minutes ago he was just asked about these comments and the exchange is is pretty darn hilarious the exchange for Jeff Sessions I'm going to try and find the transcript here because pre-fight it goes like this senator do you condone Donald Trump's comments about Judge curieux answer well he's answered that he's made a statement on it question but what do you think about it answer I don't have any statement on it he's answered that question do you think it was racist no response okay this is oh these exchanges are gonna go all the way down the line watches Paul Ryan does the same thing Paul Ryan who came in he's had a rough week he came out last week and he endorsed Donald Trump said I but I'd back him for president sure I'd back him for president because he'll be better than Hillary Clinton and they need a press conference today and he's condemning Trump the comment about the judge the other day just was not a left field for my mind it's reasoning I don't relate to I completely disagree with the thinking behind that and so he clearly says and does things I don't agree with and and I've had to speak up on time to time when that has occurred and I'll continue to do that if that's necessary I hope it's not but at the end of the day this agenda we're rolling out which is our conservative principles and the policies that implement those principles it is clear to me that that that we have a weird we have somebody who was a willing partner in advancing these things and I know for darn sure Hillary Clinton is gonna go in the opposite direction and every one of these things okay so he said he's trying to having both ways Hillary will be will be worse than Trump but I can't but Trump's a racist I mean what he's saying racist things he was asked by the way a follow-up which was you say he's saying racist things his Trump a racist and he said well I don't want to go there so now it's it now you're an awkward land again and you just can't escape awkward land Trump land is awkward land abandon hope all ye who enter Trump land that's basically where we are Mitch McConnell just came out moments ago and says it's time for Trump to stop attacking various minority groups oh ah all you people could have been part of the counter movement you could have stopped him and you didn't by the way you still can but you're gonna pick you're never gonna piss off a bass swath of Republican voters if you stop him at the convention which you still can it's still possible to do that but that possibility is growing daily because Donald Trump can't stop himself he can't stop himself and he won't stop as we said yesterday it's Donald Trump turned down for what and it's making it very very difficult for anyone to defend him there's an ad that came out that's now been pushed out Welford before I get to that I just have to sorry one one quick thing the greatest defender of Donald Trump is of course chris christie and chris christie and after having that existential death stare as he endorsed Donald Trump the one that Lindsey put dust in the wind from Kansas to Chris Christie as I've said before has become renfield to Donald from stir Acula and as long as Donald Trump keeps feeding him juicy tarantulas he will be out there juicy juicy custard filter ran Chile's chris christie will be out there defending donald trump and it's just this is so awful in every way for conservatism for the brand for the republican party here is chris Christie just making I would say an enormous ass out of himself that I would be under estimating his rotundity so here's chris Christie I don't know the history of the Trump University case so I'm not going to get into speaking about all that I've said this before that I know Donald Trump I've known him for 14 years and Donald Trump with 14 years and Donald Trump was not a racist so you know the allegations that he is are absolutely contrary to every experience that I've had with him over the last 14 years and so we're gonna end it there calls a textbook racism today you know what this congressman Ryan is entitled to his opinion as is everybody else who has an opinion on this I've expressed mine and if all we're gonna do is talk about this I'm going to get in the car and go back as I've given you my opinion you have other questions whether the answer was it was it a mistake Michael I am NOT going to get into rity 'king the campaign's that we're in the middle of will be plenty of times for post-mortem after the campaign is over and you want to ask me about it then that's fine but I'm not going to micro analyze every bit of a campaign because you know what the voters don't and what matters here is winning and losing first and foremost and what matters here is where the country's direction will be after whoever wins is winning and losing first and foremost and it turns out being a decent person matters more to me it turns out that not being a piece of crap matters more to me it turns out that you can still take the plate too awkward but you're better off taking the Paul Ryan decision he said something terrible he's still better than Hillary you're better off taking that position if you're gonna be Chris Christie than doing what chris Christie is doing here and there are more Republicans doing what Chris Christie is doing here making excuses for Trump saying that what Trump does is okay cuz the left does it it isn't it isn't the perversion of conservatism is happening in real time because people have to feel good about backing their guy they can't just condemn him and then say he's still better than Hillary it puts them in an awkward political spot and so instead what they're doing is they're now forced to become full-time Trump defenders that is a full-on disaster area and again this guy is basically indefensible I mean there's a lot about him that is indefensible the only defense that he's better than Hillary that defense gets more and more awkward every time Trump opens his mouth there's an ad out from Priorities USA it's a Hillary super PAC I hate Priorities USA it's disgusting they ran they ran at a super PAC ad back in 2012 implying the MIT Romney had fired somebody said his wife would die of cancer this is the famous Joe's optic ad this is an ad that is devastating to Trump it's devastating to Trump and this is the problem folks I get so many emails why don't you talk more about Hillary why don't you talk less about Trump because Hillary is going to remain Hillary but you all don't have to remain Trump ian's okay Hillary's gonna be Hillary she's gonna be just as snaky as she always was my dad always taught me expect us to make to be a snake and I expect Hillary to be who Hillary is but I think it's vital that you not Trump you make clear you're to staying for somebody who does things that are immoral and bad because if you don't you're gonna be smearing his candidacy all over your ideology all over your principles from American exceptionalism to racism - to what he said this ad is it's a really good ad it's a really good ad because it points out something about Trump that really is egregious there's a defense to the a but Trump can't make it here's the ad then I'll tell you what what should be the defense I remember being in the ultrasound room and finding out that our daughter was going to be born with a disability and spina bifida she was born 20 weeks later on Valentine's Day and she is a total blessing in our lives grace is the happiest child you've ever seen despite all of her medical challenges she brings out the goodness in each person and that's what we see every day with grace when I saw Donald Trump Mach a disabled person I was just shocked you got to see this guy I don't know what I said I don't remember that reporter he is talking about suffers from a chronic condition that impairs movement of his arms the children at Grace's school all know never to mock her and so for an adult to mock someone with a disability is shocking when I saw Donald Trump mock somebody with a disability it showed me his soul it showed me his heart in it I didn't like what I saw Priorities USA Action is responsible for the content of this advertising moodle ad brutal ad there's no comeback from that ad now the normal comeback would be from any normal person who hadn't mocked the disabled the normal comeback would be you like your Democrat you like killing those kind of kids in the womb right kids who have spinal bifida you recommend to parents that they abort that kid never would've gotten to live it had been for Democrat rule but Trump can't make that defense because he's busy insulting people after they're born this is the problem with trumpet Trump Trump corrupt any good and absolute Trump corrupts absolutely okay so that's that's the that's the the rule and that's what we're watching right now and it's so awkward for all of the people who are advocates for Trump and I hope they enjoy it because this is gonna be it's gonna be a long five months game it's gonna be a long five months and by the way it ain't gonna let up Trump's gonna do this every day he's not gonna stop being Trump the media is not gonna stop being the media and it's gonna be very hard to defend Trump from the media when they're saying true things about him we can attack the media for being dishonest with Hillary but they're not being dishonest with Trump on this stuff and that's the problem the most dishonest people are still being honest about Trump they were dishonest about him before by ignoring all this the first time you said the Mexican judge stuff by the way was in February and the media completely ignored it shocker he wins the nomination boom it's top of the news okay it's time for stuff I like and then a couple of things that I hate so stuff I like I'm doing sports this week I'm a big sports fan in particular I'm a big fan of baseball and basketball and football I wish I could get into hockey I think I got into a little bit late it's fun to watch but I don't know enough about it to really be a big fan but golf tennis I mean I'm a big fan of all of these but baseball is my favorite sport and so yesterday we did some boxing stuff I like boxing as well here's here's the the best baseball book or at least the best-selling baseball book probably ever written his book called ball four by Jim Bowden this book is r-rated it's totally all rated but it's the first of its kind it was it was a book that was written by Jim Mountain who-who he was a fast follower for the for the New York Yankees and he blew out his arm and tried to reinvent himself as a knuckleball pitcher and he came back and wrote this memoir during his season where he pitched for the Seattle pilots this is before the Seattle Mariners and then he pitched for the Houston Astros and it is hilarious at r-rated it's really funny it kind of explodes the myths about about baseball in some ways it's it's I I love this it's a great bathroom book it's a really really funny book he got basically banned by the Yankees or zatia almost for life because of this book by the way I said it's really good also in the baseball realm gonna watch a great baseball movie I think this is probably the best baseball movie ever made and there are a lot of good baseball movies and maybe we'll do another one tomorrow you know the one that all guys know is the the the met and Men cry movie will do that one tomorrow men crying baseball movie and every man within earshot knows what I'm talking about this is probably the best baseball movie of all time this one is sixty-one Billy Crystal directed this and it's a terrific film HBO made it and it's about the hunt the the the battle between Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris to hit 61 home runs in defeat Babe Ruth's record really well done the baseball actually looks authentic here's some of the trailer this is a fantastic story fellas 20 Yankees playing in the house that Ruth Built both going after his record it's great for baseball Oh Maris comes over from Kansas City first year with the team he beats Mickey out for the MVP you're telling me mana wouldn't be pissed off that Maris doesn't have something to prove how about the homerun record you got a shot at the bank I think if anybody's gonna do it to be Mickey it's pretty amazing the guy can play at all considering how much pain he's in maybe he took better governed self he wouldn't be injured so much tough time not to help from it you can write watch on once and the fans love this guy they love him uncle Maris never smiles he's having the season of his life and he looks like a zombie test 80% of the fans are rooting for Mickey well I guess that seems right why is it I don't know maybe I'm not a New York kind of guy I'm just some dumb redneck from North Dakota as for the M&M boys I'm told there's a feud growing believe you yeah I guess so they're booing him in his own ballpark what a tepee they've only got room in their heart for one guy we don't have to watch the pole trailer it's terrific it's really really good so take take a look at 61 and it's you know teens and above but it's really really good film okay things that I hate so one of the things that I really despise the media now featuring every kid who has a mental illness and thinks that they're of the opposite sex they've turned them all into heroes and so you every day there's a new video it's it's a viral video of some poor kid who's been victimized by their parents and suffers from a severe mental illness 40% of people who are transgender or describe themselves as such will attempt suicide in their lifetime as opposed to less than 2% of the normal population it's it's horrifying it's terrible in every way so the newest video that is like this there's this video that's being pushed by Teen Vogue magazine because we have to recruit kids to this now being pushed by Teen Vogue magazine and it's this little boy he's 14 years old and his parents have turned him into a girl or they're trying to turn him into the girl and she's Kara and he he looked it looks like a girl here so they've done his hair up like a girl but is a boy and he is is holding up signs talking about their trend his transition into a girl and this is this is the video I love painting my nails too wearing my mom's high heels was my favorite but only in the house never outside because I was born a boy I never had many friends I didn't fit in with girls and the boys made Punishers in fifth grade I was bullied so bad almost every day I came home from school crying they would make up lies to try to get me in trouble one of the kids told me I should kill myself because no one liked me anyway he told me no one would miss me if I was dead they were so mean I just wanted to die hey by the way transgenders after surgery wanna die exactly so my parents took me out of school and homeschooled me I was so so so thankful I asked my mom if I could wear a dress and I need high heels to the store she said yes so I did and it felt amazing until a woman in the store started taking pictures of me with her phone another lady was pointing in laughing okay it goes on like this right and then the idea is that we can stop it here but I felt like a freak I felt like a misfit and then I realized I saw jazz Jennings on TV it's a documentary about a boy who thinks he's a girl and his parents are making it are treating this as normal now Cory is happy and back in public school writes Teen Vogue this time she's at a school where her peers and teachers accept her she plays on the girls soccer team and uses the girls bathroom just as she should this acceptance is so important though 41% of transgender people will attempt suicide at some point in their lives we know that support and love from their community can prevent this no that's false that's not true okay support and love from the community would be making sure that people kids particularly who suffer from mental illness get treatment for the mental illness they don't mutilate their bodies and they don't put themselves in positions in school where kids are going to victimize them that doesn't mean that kids should victimize kids ever okay bullying is is against school rules but don't tell me that the parents aren't partially responsible for the letting their kid go to school dressed as a girl and he's a boy if kids make fun kids are mean kids are nasty and the parents are mean and nasty for doing this to their kid okay just to make and then to and then sent to put their their kid out there as though the kid is is totally fine and should be a model for other kids the idea that kids are not malleable in their behavior is just ridiculous and we all know this is true but it doesn't matter for the left the left only wants it's it's it's version of reality it's significantly more important for them to have their version of reality than it is for actual reality to prevail even if it means the kids suffer okay tomorrow we will be back we'll give you some results of the California primaries Hillary will have locked us up so we'll have pictures of Hillary dancing it'll be horrifying but I hope that you'll show up despite all the horrific campaigning and Hillary dancing up on ladies we have a Jif of that one already so prepare thyselves i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
