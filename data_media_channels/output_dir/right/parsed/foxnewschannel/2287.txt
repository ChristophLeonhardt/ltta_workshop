I'M ACTUALLY FROM SOUTH
JERSEY.
SOMEWHAT
UNTIL BORDER.
MATTERS.
BRIBE IS VERY IMPORTANT.
AND IT NEEDS TO BE
REITERATED OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.
LOOK AT ME.
OKAY.
I HAVE GOT BROWN SKIN.
MY PARENTS CAME HERE
LEGALLY.
AND THERE ARE SO MANY
GENERATIONS OF DESCENDENTS
OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO THIS
COUNTRY WHO ARE THE MOST
VOCAL PROPONENTS FOR MAKING
SURE THAT OUR BORDERS MATTER
AND THAT WE HAVE AN ORDERLY
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN
HERMINE WHO WANT TO DO HERE
GOOD AND WHO RESPECT THE
SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR COUNTRY
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TO
DO WORSE.
AINSLEY: OCTOBER TO DECEMBER
NEARLY 80% OF ASYLUM SEEKERS
PASSED THE INITIAL
SCREENING.
I'M BEING TOLD THAT FEW OF
THEM WILL LIKELY WIN ASYLUM.
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER
THEY GO BACK HOME AND WE
HAVE TO CATCH AND RELEASE
THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY UNTIL
THEY COME INTO COURT?
DO YOU THINK THAT NEEDS TO
CHANGE?
>> HERE'S THE THING.
HERE IS WHY ASYLUM SYSTEM
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A
COMPLETE JOKE.
MEXICO ALREADY OFFERED
ASYLUM TO EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE
CARAVAN.
OKAY.
AND IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SAFE
PASSAGE IN THAT INITIAL
COUNTRY, THEN THAT ALREADY
DELEGITIMIZES THE CLAIM ONCE
YOU ALREADY GET HERE.
AND WE NEED A BETTER VETTING
SYSTEM FOR WHO ACTUALLY IS
EXPERIENCING TRUE
PERSECUTION.
OF COURSE WE WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE CONSIDER THE
LEGITIMATE ASYLUM AND
REFUGEE CLAIMS OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
BUT, YOU SAID IT.
STEVE, PERFECTLY.
WE HAVE LIMITS.
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT'S
BEEN MISSING FROM THE
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM DEBATE.
WHICH IS WE CAN'T TAKE EVERY
LAST WILLING WORKER IN THE
WORLD WHO WANTS TO WORK HERE
FOR A DOLLAR AN HOUR.
WE HAVE TO HAVE LIMITS.
BRIAN: THERE NEEDS TO BE
MODERNIZATION OF OUR LEGAL
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.
IT TAKES TOO LONG.
TOO UNWE WOULDY AND PEOPLE
WHO CAN GET IN HERE.
PEOPLE HOBBY ON THIS LINE
10, 15 YEARS AND THEY HAVE
DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT.
>> EXACTLY, BRIAN.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MANTRAS
THAT YOU ALWAYS HERE IS
WELL, WE NEED A PATH TO
CITIZENSHIP.
THERE ARE MANY PATHS.
THERE IS AN ALPHABET SOUP OF
VISAS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO
PEOPLE.
AND THE KEY THAT YOU JUST
TALKED ABOUT, BRIAN, IS THAT
WE NEED TO GET THAT LEGAL
SYSTEM IN ORDER.
IT IS -- THERE ARE HUNDREDS.
STEVE: TALK TO CONGRESS.
>> THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
WAITING.
IT'S A HUGE BACKLOG AND THAT
AINSLEY: THERE IS ANOTHER
TOPIC WE WANT TO TALK TO
YOU, ABOUT AS A WOMAN, WHITE
HOUSE CORPTS DINNER.
MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN
MAKING FUN OF SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS LOOKS.
SHE IS SAYING SHE DIDN'T DO
THAT.
BUT SHE COMPARED HER TO AUNT
LYDIA, HAND MAID'S TALE.
I GOOGLED HER.
NOT EXACTLY A COMPLIMENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE
MISOGYNY OF THE LEFT FOR 25
YEARS AND IT IS FINALLY
ERUPTED FOR PEOPLE THAT --
THEY CAN SEE IT.
IT IS SO TRANSPARENT.
DRIPPING FROM PEOPLE IN
HOLLYWOOD.
AND JOURNALISTS AND I HAVE
TO SAY IT'S A COMPLETE
DISGRACE THAT THERE WASN'T A
SINGLE PERSON ON THE DAY AS.
THAT INTERRUPTED THAT WOMAN
AS FILTH WAS COMING OUT OF
HER MOUTH.
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW PROUD
I WAS TO BE A CONSERVATIVE
WOMAN TO SEE THE DIGNITY
WITH WHICH SARAH SANDERS
BORE THOSE SLINGS AND
ARROWS.
I HAVE FACED IT.
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE FACED.
IT'S TIME FOR THE LEFT TO
RECKON WITH IT.
AINSLEY: I WATCHED SARAH
HUCKABEE SANDERS.
AS A WOMAN I WOULD BE HAVING
TO FIGHT BACK AS A MAN OR A
WOMAN.
WHEN SOMEONE IS ATTACKING
YOUR APPEARANCE AND DOING
THE BEST YOU CAN AS A
WORKING MOTHER.
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T GET
UP.
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T
CRY.
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO BE THAT STRONG.
LET'S HEAR IT IF YOU MISSED
IT.
>> I HAVE TO SAY I'M A
LITTLE STAR STRUCK.
I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA IN
THE HAND MAID'S TALE.
SHE BURNS FAT AND THEN SHE
USES THAT ASH TO CREATE A
PERFECT SMOKY EYE.
LIKE MAYBE SHE IS BORN WITH
IT.
MAYBE IT'S LIVE.
BRIAN: HER KEY LINE WAS
AFTER ONE OF HER LINES
BOMBED AND THERE WERE MANY.
SHE SAID HEY, GUYS, YOU
SHOULD HAVE DONE YOUR
RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ME.
SHE DOES THIS.
THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES.
SHE IS FROM THE DAILY SHOW
SO YOU KNOW SHE DESPISES
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AND YOU LOOK AT HER ACT.
THAT'S WHAT HER ACT IS.
>> THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO
TURN THIS AROUND ON THE
LEADERSHIP AT THE WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S
ASSOCIATION.
BECAUSE, ACTUALLY, MICHELLE
WOLF IS RIGHT.
THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE
GETTING AND THEY WANTED IT.
AND THIS REUSE ALL OKAY
BECAUSE IT'S COMEDY, THESE
LIBERAL COMEDIANS ALWAYS
CLOAK THEMSELVES IN TO SPEW
THE WORST KIND OF HATRED AND
INTOLERANCE OF PEOPLE WHOSE
VIEWS THAT THEY DISAGREE
WITH.
I WANT TO GET BACK TO THIS
THING ABOUT CONSERVATIVE
WOMEN AGAIN.
BECAUSE, I HAVE BEEN THE
TARGET OF A HATE RAPE LIST
ALONG WITH OTHER PROMINENT
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO
SARAH PALIN DURING HER VICE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY.
THEY CALLED ON GANG RAPE FOR
HER.
THEY CALLED ON
ASSASSINATION.
THEY USE THE WORST KIND OF
VILE IMAGERY OF ANY KIND OF
CONSERVATIVE WOMAN WHO DARES
TO STRAY FROM THE LIBERAL
ORTHODOX PLANTATION.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING
TO INSPIRE?
A GENERATION OF INDEPENDENT
YOUNG GIRLS TO STAND UP FOR
THEIR VALUES.
OF BEING PRO-LIFE, OF BEING
PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT.
OF BEING PRO-LIMITED
GOVERNMENT.
BECAUSE THAT IS THE MOST
EMPOWERING THING THAT WOMEN
CAN DO AND BELIEVE IN.
STEVE: THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION
IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE
THAT SHOW BECAUSE EVEN
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT HAVE SAID
WAY OVER THE LINE.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S A JOKE?
THEY ARE SAYING NOW MAYBE WE
NEED TO CHANGE THE FORMAT.
NO, CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE AND
CHANGE YOUR FILTHY MOUTH.
STEVE: THERE IS A REASON THE
"NEW YORK TIMES" STOPPED
GOING IN 2000 WILL.
IT'S BECOME TOO CHUMMY.
BRIAN: THEY WERE THERE.
I SAW A LOT OF "NEW YORK
TIMES."
STEVE: OFFICIALLY THEY HAVE
STOPPED GOING SINCE 2008.
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BIG
SHOW LAST NIGHT.
>> THANK YOU.
MANHATTAN FILM FESTIVAL
CRUSADING ON BEHALF BEHALF
OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS WE
WERE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO
CROSS THE AISLE ON LEFT,
RIGHT AND CENTER IT ACTUALLY
DOES HAPPEN.
