in an effort to combat tax avoidance the use blacklisted 17 countries as offshore states however it failed to include its own members which act as tax havens that's according to the human rights and legal watchdog Oxfam the blacklist in-process has been surrounded by secrecy putting citizens in the dark and leaving tax havens free to use their political and economic leverage to get themselves off the EU blacklist Oxfam claims that four EU members are Ireland Luxembourg the Netherlands and Malta should all have been put on this blacklister ultimately as so-called a conduit offshore financial centres now such countries act as a intermediate destinations for money transferred to tax havens they also provide favorable tax policies to ensure a quote quiet funds flow it means the mediators to protect the reputations of their client countries the financial commentator critter Charlie Boyle believes the use made ineffectual attempts to clean up its image after the 2016 Panama papers scandal it was an attempt to be seen to be doing something internationally about the offshore havens the problem is inside its inside the EU London's one of the biggest financial centres and it has the this this transfer pricing policy which which makes it you know the virtually zero percent for the big corporations in terms of corporation tax and there's also saving in big saving of v80 as well so again it's a it's a totally unfair what I've found most interesting is the Panama papers and the Paradise papers and the leaks to do with that there was a lot of uproar but I'm amazed at how quickly it's died down it doesn't matter who's on the list or who's not on the list it's the case of the the existing business practices in those countries as well but it doesn't address the wider problem of the the tax policies of individual Western countries all across the world including the EU
