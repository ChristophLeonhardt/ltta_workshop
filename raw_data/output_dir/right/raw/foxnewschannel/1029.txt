MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY

TENSIONS THAT HAVE SET THE AREA

TO THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR.

NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN

JAPANESE CITIZENS WHO HAVE BEEN

42
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:21,279
KIDNAPPED BY NORTH KOREA.

00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,329
THE SOUTH KOREANS, THE JAPANESE

54
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:38,129
AND THE UNITED STATES WITH

55
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:39,331
RESPECT TO OUR APPROACH.

WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA.

58
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:45,537
>> AS FOR NORTH KOREAN CITIZENS,

59
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,605
THEY REPORTEDLY DON'T EVEN KNOW

60
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:48,607
WHEN OR WHERE THE SUMMIT IS

HAPPENING.

62
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,542
JUST THAT THEIR LEADER WILL BE

63
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:51,576
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP.

64
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:54,212
ANALYSTS SAY HE CARES LESS ABOUT

65
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,548
THEM, MORE ABOUT GETTING

66
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:56,915
RESPECT.

67
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,583
>> HAVING HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS,

68
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,819
THEY CAN BUILD A NARRATIVE

69
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,088
AROUND THAT AND PORTRAY THE

70
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,289
LEADER AS AN EQUAL TO THE

71
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,725
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

72
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,928
>> ALL SIDES ARE LOOKING ALSO AT

73
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,229
WHETHER THERE AT LEAST COULD BE

74
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:12,264
SOME MOVEMENT AT THIS MEETING

75
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:13,732
TOWARDS THE DECLARING OF AN END

76
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,767
TO THE KOREAN WAR.

77
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,769
THAT CONFLICT WAS HALTED WITH A

78
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,237
TRUCE SOME 65 YEARS AGO.

79
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,506
THAT INDEED WOULD BE A PEACE

80
00:02:21,506 --> 00:00:00,000
DIVIDEND FROM THE SINGAPORE
