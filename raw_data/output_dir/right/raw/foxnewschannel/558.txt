>> President Trump: IRAN HAS

4
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:09,085
ACTED VERY BADLY.

00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:11,287
WE ARE DOING MANY THINGS RIGHT

6
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:13,123
NOW, INCLUDING SANCTIONS, THAT

7
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:14,224
ARE VERY MASSIVE.

8
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:14,891
ONE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS WE

9
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,460
HAVE EVER DONE.

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,728
IRAN HAS TO CHANGE ITS TUNE

11
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,663
BEFORE I MEET WITH THEM.

12
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:21,631
THEY WANTED ME.

13
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,166
I'M NOT MEETING WITH THEM UNTIL

14
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,701

IT WILL HAPPEN.

16
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:27,671
I BELIEVE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,072
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A

18
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,007
GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.

19
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,411
