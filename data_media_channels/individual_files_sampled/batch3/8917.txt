IF MAKING IT EASY TO BE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN ISN'T ENOUGH. HOW ABOUT OFFERING AN AWARD FOR BEING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. NO SANE COUNTRY WOULD DO THAT, RIGHT? GUESS AGAIN. I VOTED NUMEROUS TIMES WHEN I WAS A SENATOR TO SPEND MONEY TO BUILD A BARRIER TO TRY TO PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM COMING IN. PEOPLE WHO ENTER THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS AND ILLEGAL ALIENS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED THE SAME AS PEOPLE WHO ENTER THE U.S. LEGALLY. BRIAN: WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PEOPLE? WAIT A SECOND, THEY ARE STILL HERE. THEY HAVE TOTALLY FLIPPED ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS NOT GONE AWAY. HOW ARE THEY GETTING AWAY WITH THIS? STEVE: IT'S CALLED POLITICS AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. TOMI LAHREN IS THE HOST OF FOX NATION. GO TO FOX NATION TO FIGURE OUT MORE ABOUT IT YOU ARE JOINING US TODAY FROM LOS ANGELES. LOS ANGELES HAS CERTAINLY HAD AN IMMIGRATION PROBLEM IN THE PAST. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE DEMOCRATS WHO BACK IN THE DAY WERE FOR ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS SAYING? WELL, DEMOCRATS DON'T JUST HOPE, THEY WILL ENSURE THAT THE MIGRANT CARAVANS OF TODAY ARE THE VOTERS OF TOMORROW. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY USING THESE PEOPLE AS POLITICAL WEAPONS AND FOOTBALLS IN ORDER TO GET VOTES THE DETRIMENT OF NOT ONLY AMERICANS BUT LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE CALL THEM ON IT WE REPEAT THOSE SOUND BITES THAT THEY SAID LONG AGO AND ASK THEM WHY THEIR POSITION HAS CHANGED? WHY DO THEY NOW PLACE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OVER LEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND AMERICANS? IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY ANSWER FOR THAT. AINSLEY: TOMI, WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION REFORM? WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT A WALL AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH HILLARY CLINTON ALSO FEELS THE SAME WAY ABOUT A PHYSICAL BARRIER TO STOP PEOPLE. LISTEN, WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW WITH THIS MIGRANT CARAVAN IS NOT A CARAVAN, IT'S AN INVASION. WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS. AND, YES, PHYSICAL BARRIERS DO WORK. I HAVE SPENT TIME WITH THE BORDER PATROL. I HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY GO THROUGH. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE GREAT TECHNOLOGY, WHETHER YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL BARRIER YOU ARE ABLE TO REALLOCATE RESOURCES IN OTHER PLACES WHERE A PHYSICAL BARRIER ISN'T POSSIBLE. YOU ARE ABLE TO STOP A LOT OF THAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST, YOU NEED TO GAIN THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND BUILDING A WALL IS A FIRST STEP TO DO IT. THEN WE CAN DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY HERE. THAT WALL HAS TO BE FIRST. BRIAN: NOW, WHEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AGREED ON GETTING RID OF CHAIN MIGRATION, AGREED TO BUILD THE BARRIER AND AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD NOT IS HAVE FULL FLAT ACCESS TO OUR COUNTRY UNIMPEDED HE WOULD STILL COULDN'T GET IMMIGRATION DONE. WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MADE IT CLEAR THIS CARAVAN COMING HERE UNACCEPTABLE. TO THOSE WHO SAY THIS IS A HARD-HEARTED STANCE, LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE UNITED STATES IS A HISTORICALLY GENEROUS NATION WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION OVER 33 MILLION PEOPLE TOTAL ARE CURRENTLY HIRE WHO ARE IMMIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY. TO THOSE WHO WANT TO COME HERE, COME HERE LEGALLY. LEGAL IMMIGRATION IS THE SUREST WAY TO OBTAIN THE BETTER LIFE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. FROM A SECURITY STANDPOINT, THERE IS NO PROPER ACCOUNTING OF WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CARAVAN ARE. AND THIS POSES AN UNACCEPTABLE SECURITY RISK TO THE UNITED STATES. BRIAN: TOMI, HERE WE ARE. THIS IS THE CARAVAN. I DON'T HEAR A WORD FROM DEMOCRATS. WHY? WELL, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THIS NARRATIVE THAT BORDER ENFORCEMENT, BORDER SECURITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMMIGRATION LAW IS SOMEHOW BIGOTED AND INTOLERANT AND UNFORTUNATELY, AS I HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES WHEN I HAVE GONE TO WEST HOLLYWOOD, WHICH WE KNOW IS REALLY THE BAGSIAN THGSIAN THESIAN BASTION OF LIBERALISM. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM INTOLERANT SO THEY WON'T SAY A WORD ABOUT IT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE IS DONALD TRUMP. I BELIEVE GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, I DON'T THINK THIS MIGRANT CARAVAN IS GOING TO HURT REPUBLICANS OR DONALD TRUMP. I THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICANS REALIZE WHAT'S AT STAKE AND COME OUT AND VOTE FOR BORDER SECURITY AND ENFORCEMENT. STEVE: YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE SAID EARLIER THAT THE MIDTERM IS ALL ABOUT THE CARAVAN AND KAVANAUGH. YOU ARE SAYING THAT'S ACCURATE? OH, ABSOLUTELY. BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS GOING TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR EMOTIONAL PLEAS, THERE ARE SO MANY AMERICANS OUT THERE THAT ARE SEEING THIS, THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THIS IS AN INVASION AND SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE UNITED STATES AND OUR RULE OF LAW. THEY ARE ARE GOING TO COME OUT AND VOTE AGAINST IT BECAUSE, EVEN IN CALIFORNIA, PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THIS. BRIAN: TOMI LAHREN ONE OF YOUR FEATURES I KNOW IS AT THE BORDER ON FOX NATION, RIGHT? ABSOLUTELY. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THOSE FOLKS. YOU WILL SEE IT ON FOX
