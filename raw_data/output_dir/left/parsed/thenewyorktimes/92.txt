If you’re in Zimbabwe
and need cash,
Vincent’s your guy.
Two years ago,
he graduated with a
degree in accounting.
But he didn’t land a job.
So he’s on the street,
exchanging U.S. dollars
and South African rand
for Zimbabwe’s failing currency.
The country’s so short on cash,
people line up at
A.T.M.s for hours
just to get 20 bucks.
There are virtually no jobs.
So Vincent's generation,
college-educated and ambitious,
is stuck, hawking shoes,
phone chargers, bras.
Many give up and leave.
Right now any money he makes
goes to a broker, who has
promised to get him
work papers in South Africa.
Vincent’s trying to get out, too.
We came to Zimbabwe to
witness its first elections
since Robert Mugabe 
was forced out.
For almost 40 years,
Mugabe’s oppressive rule
isolated the country
and crippled its economy.
The military-backed
government that overthrew him
promised change.
They even called an election,
and let in journalists.
We saw genuine 
excitement on the street.
Followed by violence.
Six people were killed,
and the same ruling party
was declared the winner.
So is this true change?
Sure, Mugabe is gone.
But everywhere we look,
corruption, violence 
and fear still run deep.
Like here.
In 2005, the ruling party
forced nearly 700,000 people
into squatter camps.
The goal: To create a voting
bloc dependent on the state
and break up
opposition strongholds.
The result:
a broken community.
We meet Collen.
He was brought here after the
government burned his home.
He’s lived here for 15 years
and the place still lacks
basic infrastructure.
But his vocal
criticism has made him
a target for intimidation.
So he’s moved his
family into hiding.
Desperate, many women here
turn to prostitution.
Because of the 
cash shortage,
Tracey’s clients send 
payments to her phone —
if they pay at all.
Outside of the capital,
we see the roots of despair
in these neglected fields.
Agriculture is critical
to Zimbabwe’s economy.
This is Steve Krynauw.
Eighteen years ago,
he lived here.
In 2000, Steve
and three friends
were kidnapped, beaten
and left for dead.
One friend was killed.
It was part of
Robert Mugabe’s plan
to right the wrongs
of colonialism
by seizing land owned
by white farmers
and giving it to
black Zimbabweans —
by force if necessary.
Steve was driven off his farm
and never compensated.
But the property didn’t
go to local black farmers.
It went to a military family
loyal to the party.
With no farming experience,
the land went to waste 
and the house burned
in a brush fire.
It was a common story.
Seizing the land
and handing it out
to a ruling elite that led
the country to total ruin.
And the same elite
still governs.
But then, there’s
Richard Muvungha.
He’s a veteran.
Fifteen years ago, he 
was granted this land
formerly owned by a 
white cattle rancher.
He learned how to farm and
transformed the property.
But his investment
isn’t guaranteed.
The state owns all of
the redistributed lands.
Richard can’t use his property
as collateral for loans.
It’s hard to acquire
new plots for expansion.
And the risk remains that
the government could seize it
from him at any time.
The night the election 
results are announced,
the city is on lockdown.
We see only riot police
and soldiers.
The opposition
challenges the results.
“Persecution. Intimidation.”
Journalists are corralled
by police.
Reports emerge of 
beatings and arrests.
It’s a far cry from the
peace and prosperity
that were promised.
