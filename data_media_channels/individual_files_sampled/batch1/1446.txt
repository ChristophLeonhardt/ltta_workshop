Lench Oh a new leader but is the government willing to carry out the reforms that protesters have been calling for thank you so much yes there is a new leader a chairperson for the ruling et RDF and then shortly to become the Prime Minister of Ethiopia the the ruling party has been going through different process of renewal and change it means that it is doing all what it has been doing to respond to the the grievances that the people of Ethiopia in general have been addressing and so we can say that yes new leader and administration in general has ready to respond to the needs of the people mr. Adamo how do the Roma people feel about this new leader is it enough to appease them and does he represent real change for them I think the most important context here is this is the only leader that could have pulled Ethiopia back from the brink in certainly the ruling party from edging closer to what most people would say dissolution so in that sense I think this is the best of the alternatives that were provided for this position but I think ultimately it comes down to it's not so much that now we have an aroma prime minister which is symbolically very important but I think what he does next in in who he surrounds himself with who is going to come into his new cabinet because the the ruling party has taken a responsibility for the crisis in the country particularly the executive leadership we will have to wait and see what kind of change he will put in there because if you just change one leader at the table that necessarily doesn't mean a whole lot of change and I think we will have to see specifics and people are cautiously optimistic and they are going to give him a chance he will have to deliver and miss Leymah do you think he will deliver will the change trickle down from the top and to the various institutions that make up the ithi and of Ethiopian government well I agree with what my colleague Mohammad además ate in the first place but I would add this dr. Wahby is inheriting a country which I would say is a deep state and every stretch of measurement he's inheriting a country under a state of emergency which is essentially being ruled by the army and he comes from the region where the state of emergency which is widowed hard-hit by the state of emergency and given all this and if the reform or if the replacement of doctor IV of the pride the outgoing Prime Minister by dr. avi is not going to be accompanied by the immediate lifting of the state of emergency it is not going to give him the leverage that he needs to flex to exercise his leadership capacity no matter how many people would surround him the first and foremost thing would be for the state to have lifted the state of emergency so that he can have the room to maneuver to discuss with opposition politicians with civil society which are prohibited under the state of emergency so I don't see how he's gonna succeed in inheriting a state under the rule of the military well let me put that to the government spokesperson mr. landreaux wall at the government when will the government rather left the state of emergency and will the military the intelligence community that holds so much power Ethiopia are they going to work with the new prime minister well first of all I think we have to acknowledge that what should rule in Ethiopia or what should prevail should be democracy and all the the challenges that we have been facing can be addressed properly when democracy prevails and concerning the state of emergency and the role of the military actually the military is the Ethiopian military and they are given the the power and the right to the limit of the law and it is not by a personal willingness or it is not preference it's not a choice to accept and work with the new leader but the Constitution forces all the institutions including the military to work for the people of Ethiopia because the decision made the new chairperson of epr defendant the new prime minister has been elected democratically it means that we are building democracy in a nation just getting rid of poverty and there is no other choice but it is an obligation for all institutions including the military to work with a new leader and we we have hope we are highly optimistic that the the needs of the Ethiopian people will be served with and justice will be made and the the rural part we trusted in it is leader but while electing dr. avi argument to lead the ruling party and then to become the Prime Minister of Ethiopia it means that by the participation of all Ethiopians across the country and also all governmental institution there is a high possibility for the new leader to respond to the needs of the Ethiopian people I'm sorry to interrupt yes women's emergency when can we expect that to be lifted and will it come with protesters demands being met you know accountability for human rights abuses the release of political prisoners political freedoms greater reforms when the the state of emergency is not in the best interest of the Ethiopian government our government and they took in people but you know we have been fortunate because of different factors and the state of emergency is there to serve the interest of the European people but in new process people have been voicing concerns basically from the Oromia region and other regions and the grievances are well taken and it will be addressed properly because the government has the obligation to protect human rights and also to serve the very interest of the people and so regarding where the set of when the state of emergency will be lifted from the very beginning I have rightly said that it is not in our best interest as a government and as a people but there are issues to be addressed that is there has to be peace in the stability we have to restore peace in the stability and then we have to pay attention to the questions that our people have been raising because the government has been for so many times I can say for about two more than two years you know just paying attention to restoring peace and order that can affect the economy now peace is a necessity it is not an alternative for Ethiopia as a whole and for the government as well miss let me hunt of the Akopian people we know that we cannot safeguard the peace and stability by security forces but by the participation of all Ethiopians and it is at the hands of the European people and I cannot tell you it will be lifted in a month or so but we hope and we wish that the reality on the ground improves and we immediately lift the state of emergency thank you very much for that mr. Lench I'm going to bring miss Lima I will bring miss Lima and now mr. lencho is as very optimistic about this situation and having peace and security are you as optimistic that everyone in the government is going to work together including the two grains who've had a disproportionate amount of power for the size for the for how much of the ethiopian population they make up are they going to be willing now to surrender some of their powers so that the political system is more equal well you know it's it's one thing to be optimistic but it's quite another thing for me to do it you know besides being optimistic if you look at how his election process in itself there is enough reasons to worry about the fight that was put up particularly from the TP lfd to Grand people Liberation Front representatives inside the council's meeting a fight that lasted to the bitter end he was he was you know Ford against he's even including his own candidacy was an was in the council there so there's a huge resistance from from particularly the representatives of the two grand people Liberation Front so that gives me enough reason to worry but my optimistic I do hope and I am optimistic regarding the coming of dr. Abbey for one and one reason only and that is he is a result of people's power he comes from the region where the people have pushed and cornered the the original state change his own way of conducting its business so he is coming from that background and he knows what it means not to deliver and he is well aware to my understanding that if he offends what he's gonna be facing is going to be the people's power that gives me hope and he also showed showed a bit of an attitude previously that has the departure from the government from the remaining government in terms of listening to the people and in terms of connecting to the people's cry to the people's grievances so that gives me a hope but I still remain you know cautiously optimistic about this whole process because I like what dr. negeri said with all due respect to what he said it is not going to be an easy thing and I'm not sure if that he will be allowed to bring in the changes that he desires - given the status quo continues like it is today mr. Adama miss Leymah touched on some real reform credentials that mr. Ahmed does have you know he was a very important part of the erroneous state government that was driving reform in that region including things like the way police conducted themselves during protests he allowed the regional broadcaster to have more press freedom do you think that he will be able to carry out those reforms on a national level how difficult is that going to be I think it's important I'm glad that you point that out because when he was elected at the romeo he as a vice president it was at the height of a rama protest his election itself was a response to relentless protests and I think in aside from changing the the way the the regional broadcaster the board of which dr. Ravi chairs in and also changing the police in society relations I think one of the things that they did successfully at the regional level was acknowledging that there are problems in the best way to deal with those problems is by listening to people by cleaning up their house that entails laying off a lot of people raft officials TPA left cronies who were holding office as gatekeepers in real reform and embracing the protesters demands and in where the question now is whether he would be able to take that to the national level I think he has a stork opportunity to do that and there are various factors I can cite one is the regional party from Romeo P do controls the majority of seats in parliament in the parliament the dystopian Parliament has been a rubber-stamp legislature for the last 27 years but over the last year we have seen some movement where at least some of the members are not voting their conscience and listening to the will of the people listening to their constituents so the the most logical thing to do for doctor revision for his party now is used that power use that leverage lift the state of emergency which essentially takes away his civilian powers and give the powers to the military I agree with dr. Lynch or that what Ethiopia needs now is real democracy in more freedoms but the best the way to deal with that is not by doubling down with the same tired and tried in failed strategies of stead of emergency more repression putting people who were arrested a month ago back in jail yeah this kind of barking force you know one step forward one step back that is not going to inspire confidence and that is not going to restore the credibility the legitimacy that this government lacks and let me put that to mr. lonchar then mr. Lench oh are the hardliners the elites and the government ready to believe that security crackdowns can no longer crush dissent well thank you actually dr. a behemoth is a gift to the European people and it has come a long way through this different process that IPR they followed as a party it means he has been democratically elected because he's a visionary because he is an architect of change it is a hope to the Ethiopian people in general and basically they use in particular who have been voicing different grievances in that case we have to understand that without promoting democracy and ensuring equality justice rule of law in general I don't think that we can solve the problems that we are facing these days therefore there is no party which has special treatment special privilege in Ethiopian because it all is European people we can say have a paid sacrifices to build this nation but the reason we have isn't the reason why there is a new leader in Ethiopia because of mass protests over many years because one party one tribe are seen to have had too much power disproportionate power well now I am talking about the reality you know people may see things from different perspectives I mean I don't buy even the idea that one party is a kingmaker and can make and break we won't accept this in the future if we have to change Ethiopia for the right cause all right mr. lamken we have to change our perspective as well so that we can change the reality all right I understand you we don't deny that there are red seekers in the party and I'm just going to bring mr. a vamo and now because we don't have very long left and I'd like to see and I see that he has something to say absolutely I think we should be very clear that the ruling party EP RDF in January acknowledged that TP LF the the kingmakers in the EP RDF coalition have built cronies inside o PDO inside other parties which essentially made the country uncover noble they continue to have that power they still control the military they still control the intelligence they are heavily invested in the economic sector they the their companies companies associated with them control the commanding heights of the country's economy so I don't think the Prime Minister will have power or his his term will be much different from that of the outgoing Prime Minister if we are going to repeat that so I think EP RDF understands there is a problem now they have to see to it that the solution is what the communications minister dr. Nagar is saying more more democracy more freedom opening up the political environment EP RDF cannot solve the problems alone the opposition needs to be brought in in be part of the solution that includes opposition in the country or position in outside the country of the press the civil society doesn't exist all the things that all I'm going to bring miss Leymah in now because we don't again we don't have a very long left I'm going to give her the last point is mr. Ahmed going to be able to bridge the divisions in the coalition and succeed that again still depends on what the party is going to do to every initiative that he may probably bring to the table let's not forget that a PR dev as a coalition is a party in a governing party that considers compromise as a sign of weakness what kind of compromise are they going to make in order to bring about the changes in December when the leaders of all the four parties met together they have brought around 12 major agendas that they they said needed a reform and the most important ones are the security reform the security sector and the army judiciary the economy itself and all and they have agreed that they need to bring the reform agenda and they have set up a committee for each of the reform agenda that they brought together they acknowledge that unless they have changed brought a change into those areas they face an imminent threat of collapse so they all understand that but that means they need to make a lot of compromise and I believe as as a party is a party that's led by a group think a party that thinks compromise is a sign of weakness and that that that's the worry right now so no matter how much effort dr. Abbey is going to bring in unless the party gives him the leverage in the room to maneuver he's going to be a spectacular failure again or mr. lemma thank you very much for that that acid alley lemma joining us from Frankfort we have negeri lencho and addis ababa and muhammad a day more in Washington DC thank you all very much for your time today and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website al-jazeera calm and for further discussion to go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle this act aj inside story the millers of the puranam and the whole team here thank you very much for watching and bye for now you
