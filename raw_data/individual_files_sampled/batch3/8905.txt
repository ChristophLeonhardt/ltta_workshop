♪ ♪ THE U.S. HAS BEEN PLAYED BEAUTIFULLY LIKE A FIDDLE BECAUSE YOU HAD A DIFFERENT LEADER. WE WON'T BE PLAYED. THINGS CHANGED RADICALLY FROM A FEW MONTHS AGO. WE ARE SETTING UP MEETINGS. DOWN TO TWO COUNTRIES FOR A SITE. IRREVERSIBLE DISMANTLING OF NORTH KOREA'S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION WITHOUT DELAY. IT'S SOMETHING I HOPE I CAN DO FOR THE WORLD. Bret: A BIG MOMENT WITH NORTH KOREAS LEADER AND SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT COMING TO THE DMZ STEPPING OVER INTO EACH OTHER'S TERRITORY AND TALKING, LAYING THE GROUND WORK FOR A POSSIBLE PEACE AND ALSO LAYING THE GROUND WORK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN. THIS FOLLOWS THE CIA DIRECTOR MIKE POMPEO'S VISIT TO NORTH KOREA OVER EASTER WEEKEND. A PICTURE OF HIM SHAKING HANDS WITH THE NORTH KOREA LEADER. A LOT TO COVER TODAY. OUR PANEL. BYRON NEW YORK, AMY AND JASON A "WALL STREET JOURNAL" COLUMNIST. JASON, YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT TODAY? WELL, HMMM, I DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF WARMTH THERE. . BETWEEN MERGE AND DONALD TRUMP. Bret: DIFFERENT THAN THE FRENCH VISIT? A LITTLE DIFFERENT. FRANCE AND GERMANY ARE WARY OF THE U.S. PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL. THEY DON'T LIKE TRUMP'S TALK OF TARIFFS ON ALUMINUM AND STEEL. TRYING TO GET HIM TO SCALE THAT BACK. YOU SEE SOME SIMILARITIES THERE. WHAT I SAW, STRONG LANGUAGE OUT OF DONALD TRUMP WITH REGARD TO IRAN AND HOW HE WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE DETERRENTS ACQUIRE ACQUIIN ACQUIING ACQUIING N ACQUIING NUC ACQUIING NUCLE ACQUIING NUCLEAR ACQUIING NUCLEAR WE ACQUIING NUCLEAR WEAP ACQUIING NUCLEAR WEAPON ACQUIING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. FRANCE SEEMED MORE OPEN THAT PARTICULARLY WITH THINGS LIKE SUNSET PROVISIONS OR INSPECTIONS. I AM NOT SURE THAT MERKEL IS THERE YET. Bret: ON KOREA, THE PRESIDENT TWEETING FURIOUSLY. GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING. ONLY TIME WILL TELL. KOREAN WAR TO END. THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT TAKING PLACE IN KOREA. DON'T FORGET THE GOOD HELP THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA GAVE TO THE U.S. THEY ARE LAYING THE GROUND WORK HERE FOR SOMETHING REALLY SIGNIFICANT. YES. LOOK, THIS IS ALL GOOD NEWS. THE PRESIDENT DESERVES ALL OF THE CREDIT FOR WHATEVER HE DID TO PUSH THE CHINESE TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AND GET THE SANCTIONS PASSED THROUGH THE U.N. THAT ARE INFLICTING PAIN ON THE REGIME IN NORTH KOREA. THE MEETING LAST NIGHT, IT WAS NOT UNPRECEDENTED THAT THE 2 SIDES WOULD TALK. BUT THE PHYSICAL MEETING AND EVERYTHING BODES WELL. THEY DIDN'T GET SPECIFIC. THEY DIDN'T PROMISE TO END THE KOREAN WAR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DIDN'T COMMIT TO ANY PLEDGES. IT'S HOPEFUL. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT TOOK PAINS TO CREDIT PRESIDENT XI FOR ENFORCING THE SANCTIONS AND BEING A CREDIBLE PARTNER. SOUTH KOREAS AND NORTH KOREAS WOULD LIKE TO SEPARATE US. THE JAPANESE ARE SKEPTICAL. A POSSIBLY SCENARIO IS HE DEVELOPED HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM SO FAR HE CAN GET TO THE TABLE AND SAY, GUESS, WHAT IT'S BEEN GREAT MEETING WITH YOU. I MIGHT TALK ABOUT A FREE FREEZE BUT I DON'T DISMANTLE. . Bret: THEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD WALK AWAY. YES. PEOPLE SAY KIM CAN'T BE TRUSTED AND THE U.S. HAS TO ALWAYS REWARDS ONLY ACTIONS AND NEVER PROMISES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS A BIG DEAL. THERE IS ONE PERSON WHO IS MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN ANYBODY ELSE AND THAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE SANCTIONS AND THIS ATTITUDE I MIGHT BE CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE MADE SOMETHING HAPPEN. HE IS RIGHT. WE HAVE NORTH AND SOUTH AGREEMENTS BEFORE AND SUMMITS AND JOINT DECLARATIONS. THE FACT IS THE NORTH KOREA CONSTITUTION CALLS FOR THE END OF SOUTH KOREA. IT HAS SINCE 1953 AND STILL DOES. WE HAVE NO SPECIFICS ON. THAT WE HAVE NOTHING ON HUMAN RIGHTS HERE. THE MOST REASSURING THING I HAVE HEARD IS WHAT YOU JUST REFERRED TO. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE IS WILLING TO WALK AWAY. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T FEEL IF HE GETS INTO THESE MEETINGS, I HAVE TO CUT A DEAL OR I WILL LOOK LIKE A FAILURE. NO. UNLESS YOU GET SOMETHING OF SUBSTANCE, WALK AWAY. NORTH KOREA CAN'T BE TRUSTED. Bret: THE PRESIDENT TODAY ON THE HOUSE INTEL REPORT. IT SAID NO COLLUSION ON THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. HE WAS HONORED BY THE REPORT. IT WAS CONCLUSIVE. NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. THE COMMITTEE DID NOT USE ITS SUBPOENA POWER FOR BANK AND PHONE RECORDS. IT WAS A KINDERGARTEN REPORT. Bret: DEMOCRATS NOT HAPPY WITH THE REPORT. THE FINDINGS OF THE RUSSIA CYBER ATTACKS. NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA. OPPOSITION RESEARCH MAKES ITS WAY FROM RUSSIA AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE MEDIA. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS ABOUT MIKE FLYNN. I ASKED JIM COMEY ABOUT THAT. DID YOU TELL LAWMAKERS THAT THE FBI DID NOT BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL FLYNN WAS LYING INTENTIONALLY? NO, MAYBE SOMEONE MISUNDERSTOOD SOMETHING I SAID. IF HE DID NOT REMEMBER TELLING CONGRESS HIS AGENTS TOLD HIM THEY DIDN'T THINK FLYNN WAS LYING. HE NEEDS TO GET HIS LAWYERS TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE TRANSCRIPT. WE DID NOT MIS-HEAR. MAYBE HE MIS-SPOKE. Bret: IN THIS REPORT GENERAL FLYNN PLEADED GUILTY TO MAKING A FALSE STATEMENT TO THE FBI ABOUT HIS MEETING WITH THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATOR. WELL, JAMES COMEY HAS DENIED THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES SO FAR. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED. I REPORTED IT NOT TOO LONG AGO. IN THIS MEETING OF MARCH OF 2017, CONGRESS DEMANDED BRIEFINGS FROM COMEY. HE TOLD THEM THAT. THE KEY WORD HERE IS TRANSCRIPT. THAT'S WHAT GOWDY WAS TALKING ABOUT. HIS MEETING WAS TRANSSCRIBED. YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY IN THIS REPORT THAT JUST GOT RELEASED TODAY. IF ANYBODY LOOKED AT THIS REPORT. BIG BLACK SECTIONS EVER THINGS THE HOUSE COMMITTEE SAID NOT ALL OF THIS STUFF IS CLASSIFIED. WE WILL RELEASE A LESS REDACTED VERSION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. Bret: QUICKLY. EVEN GOWDY SAID MUELLER IS THE BIG PERSON HERE. THERE WERE WITNESSES. THEY WANTED TO TALK TO. THEY COULD NOT TALK TO. YES, THERE ARE THINGS THAT MUELLER CAN DO THAT THE COMMITTEES ON THE CAPITOL HILL COULD NOT DO.
