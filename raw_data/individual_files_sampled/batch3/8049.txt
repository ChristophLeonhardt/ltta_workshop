OKAY. IS THIS GOOD? YET. OKAY. THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, AND RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, MY NAME IS CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. I AM A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT PALO ALTO UNIVERSITY AND A RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST AT THE STANDFORD UNIVERSITY OF MEDICINE. I WON'T DETAIL MY EDUCATION BACKGROUND SINCE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SUMMARIZED. I HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO RUSSELL FORD SINCE 2002. WE HAVE TWO CHILDREN. I AM HERE NOW TODAY NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE. I AM TERRIFIED. I AM HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS MY'S EVERY DUTY TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IT WHILE IT BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I WERE AT HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE DESCRIBED THE EVENTS PUBLICLY BEFORE. I HAVE SUMMARIZED THEM IN MY LETTER TO RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN AND AGAIN TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY. I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE APPEARANCE IMPORTANCE OF IT YOU ARE HEARING FROM ME DIRECTLY AND THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS HAD ON MY LIFE AND ON MY FAMILY. I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS OF WASHINGTON, D.C. I ATTENDED THE SCHOOL AND BETHESDA, MARYLAND, FROM 1978- 1978-1984. IT IS AN ALL GIRLS AT SCHOOL THAT OPENED IN 18 OH ONE. DURING MY TIME AT THE SCHOOL, GIRLS ARE FREQUENTLY MET AND BECAME FRIENDLY WITH ALL BOYS SCHOOLS, INCLUDING GEORGETOWN PREP. AS WELL AS COUNTRY CLUBS AND OTHER PLACES WHERE FAMILY SOCIALIZED. THIS IS HOW I MET BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE BOY WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ME. DURING MY FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE SCHOOL YEARS, WHEN I WAS 14-15 YEARS OLD, MY GROUP OF FRIENDS INTERCEPTED WITH BRETT AND HIS FRIENDS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I HAD BEEN FRIENDLY WITH THE CLASSMATES OF BRETT FOR EVERY TIME DURING MY FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEAR. IT WAS THROUGH THAT CONNECTION THAT I ATTENDED A NUMBER OF PARTIES THAT BRETT ALSO ATTENDED. WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL, BUT I KNEW HIM, AND HE KNEW ME. IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, LIKE MOST SUMMERS, I SPENT ALMOST EVERY DAY AT THE COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB IN CHEVY CHASE MARYLAND, SWIMMING AND PRACTICING DIVING. ONE EVENING THAT SUMMER, AFTER A DAY OF DIVING AT THE CLUB, I ATTENDED A SMALL GATHERING AT A HOUSE IN THAT AREA. THERE WERE FOUR BOYS I REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY BEING AT THE HOUSE. BRETT KAVANAUGH, MARK JUDGE, A BOY NAMED PJ, AND ONE OTHER BOY WHO I CANNOT RECALL. I ALSO REMEMBER MY FRIEND "LELAND, ATTENDING. I DO NOT REMEMBER ALL OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT GATHERING CAME TOGETHER, BUT LIKE MANY THAT SUMMER, IT WAS ALMOST SURELY A SPUR OF THE MOMENT GATHERING. I TRULY REMEMBER I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL WITH MORE DETAILED ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE AND WILL BE ASKED ABOUT HOW I GOT TO THE PARTY AND WHERE IT TOOK PLACE AND SO FORTH. I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, AND I DON'T REMEMBER AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO. BUT THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT NIGHT THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY ARE THE ONES I WILL NEVER FORGET. THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY MEMORY AND HAVE HAUNTED ME EPISODICALLY AS AN ADULT. WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL GATHERING, PEOPLE WERE DRINKING BEER AND A SMALL LIVING ROOM/FAMILY ROOM TYPE OF AREA ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. I DRINK ONE BEER. BRETT AND MARK WERE VISIBLY DRUNK. EARLY IN THE EVENING, I WENT UP A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS, LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE RESTROOM. WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS FROM THE BATHROOM. I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME. BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM. THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BEDROOM. IT WAS TURNED UP LETTER BY EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE WERE IN THE ROOM. I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED, AND BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME. HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME. I YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME, AND I TRY TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, BUT HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE WAS VERY INEBRIATED. AND BECAUSE I WAS WEARING A ONE PIECE BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH MY CLOTHING. I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE ME. I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP. WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM YELLING. THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE MOST, AND IT'S HAD THE MOST LASTING IMPACT ON MY LIFE. IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE, AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. BOTH RHETT AND MARK WERE DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE ATTACK. THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME. MARCUS SEEMED AMBIVALENT AT TIMES, URGING BRETT ON. AT TIMES TELLING HIM TO STOP IT. A COUPLE OF TIMES, I MADE EYE CONTACT WITH MARK AND THOUGHT HE MIGHT TRY TO HELP ME. BUT HE DID NOT. DURING THIS ASSAULT, MARK CAME OVER AND JUMPED ON THE BED TWICE WHILE BRETT WAS ON TOP OF ME. AND THE LAST TIME THAT HE DID THIS, WE TOPPLED OVER, AND BRETT WAS NO LONGER ON TOP OF ME. I WAS ABLE TO GET UP AND RUN OUT OF THE ROOM DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE BEDROOM. A SMALL BATHROOM. I RAN INSIDE THE BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR. I WAITED UNTIL I HEARD BRETT AND MARK LEAVE THE BATHROOM, LAUGHING, AND LOUDLY WALK DOWN THAT NARROW STAIRWAY, PIN BOWLING OFF THE STAIRS ON THEIR WAY DOWN. I WAITED, AND WHEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM, I LEFT THE BATHROOM, WENT DOWN THE SAME STAIRWELL, THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM, AND LEFT THE HOUSE. I REMEMBER BEING ON THE STREET AND FEELING AN ENORMOUS SENSE OF RELIEF THAT I HAD ESCAPED THE HOUSE, AND THAT BRETT AND MARK WERE NOT COMING OUTSIDE AFTER M ME. BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS. I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY PARENTS THAT I AT AGE 15 WAS IN A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY PARENTS PRESENT, DRINKING BEER WITH BOYS. I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE BRETT DID NOT RAPE ME, I SHOULD JUST MOVE ON, JUST PRETEND THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. OVER THE YEARS, I TOLD A VERY, VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. I TOLD MY HUSBAND BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED A SEXUAL ASSAULT. I HAD NEVER TOLD THE DETAILS TO ANYONE, IS THE SPECIFIC DETAILS ON TILL MAY 2012 DURING A COUPLES COUNSELING SESSION. THE REASON THIS CAME UP IN COUNSELING IS NOT MY HUSBAND AND I HAD COMPLETED A VERY EXTENSIVE, VERY LONG REMODEL OF OUR HOME, AND I INSISTED ON A SECOND FRONT DOOR. AN IDEA THAT HE AND OTHERS DISAGREED WITH AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. IN EXPLAINING WHY I WANTED A SECOND FRONT DOOR, I BEGAN TO DESCRIBE THE ASSAULT IN DETAIL. I RECALL SAYING ABOUT THE BOY WHO ASSAULTED ME COULD SOMEDAY BE ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AND SPOKE A BIT ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND AT AN ELITIST ALL BOYS SCHOOL IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND. MY HUSBAND RECALLS THAT I NAMED MY ATTACKER AS BRETT KAVANAUGH. AFTER THAT MAY 2012 THERAPY SESSION, I DID MY BEST TO IGNORE THE MEMORIES OF THE ASSAULT BECAUSE RECOUNTING THEM CAUSED ME TO RELIVE THE EXPERIENCE AND CAUSE PANIC AND ANXIETY. OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD DISCUSS THE ASSAULT AND INDIVIDUAL THERAPY SESSIONS, BUT TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE MORE RELIVING OF THE TRAUMA, SO I TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT OR DISCUSS IT. BUT OVER THE YEARS, I WENT THROUGH PERIODS WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT THE ATTACK. I HAD CONFIDED IN SOME CLOSE FRIENDS THAT I HAD HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT. OCCASIONALLY, I STATED THAT MY ASSAILANT WAS A PROMINENT LAWYER OR JUDGE, BUT I DID NOT USE HIS NAME. I DO NOT RECALL EACH PERSON I SPOKE TO ABOUT BRETT'S ASSAULT, AND SOME OF THOSE FRIENDS HAVE REMINDED ME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF "THE WASHINGTON POST" STORY ON BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I I HAD N BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I I HAD V SEPTEMBER 16TH 2018. BUT UNTIL JULY 2018, I I HAD R NAMED MR. KAVANAUGH AS MY ATTACKER OUTSIDE OF THERAPY. THIS CHANGED IN EARLY JULY 2018. I SAW PRESS REPORTS STATING THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ON THE SHORT-LIST OF A LIST OF VERY WELL-QUALIFIED SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. I THOUGHT IT WAS MY CIVIC DUTY TO GIVE MY INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDUCT SO THAT THOSE CONSIDERING THE NOMINATION WOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS ASSAULT. ON JULY 6, THERE WAS A SENSE OF URGENCY TO RELAY THE INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE A NOMINEE WAS SELECTED. I DID NOT KNOW HOW SPECIFICALLY TO DO THIS. I CALLED MY CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE AND LET HER RECEPTIONIST NOW THAT SOMEONE ON THE PRESIDENT SHORT-LIST HAD ATTACKED ME. I ALSO SENT A MESSAGE TO THE ENCRYPTED "WASHINGTON POST" TIP LINE. I PROVIDED THE NAMES OF BRETT KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE. I STATED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD ASSAULTED ME IN THE 1980s IN MARYLAND. THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY HARD THING FOR ME TO DO, BUT I FELT THAT I COULDN'T NOT DO IT. OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I TOLD A COUPLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS ON THE BEACH IN CALIFORNIA THAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD A SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ME. I WAS VERY CONFLICTED AS TO WHETHER TO SPEAK OUT. ON JULY 9TH, I RECEIVED A RETURN PHONE CALL FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CONGRESSWOMAN, AFTER MR. KAVANAUGH HAD BECOME THE NOMINEE. I MET WITH HER STAFF ON JULY 18TH, AND WITH HER ON JULY JULY 20TH, DESCRIBING THE ASSAULT, AND DISCUSSING MY FEARS ABOUT COMING FORWARD. LATER, WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF SENDING A LETTER TO RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, WHO IS ONE OF MY STATE SENATORS, DESCRIBING WHAT OCCURRED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT REPRESENTATIVE, OR OFFICE DELIVERED A COPY OF MY LETTER TO FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE. THE LETTER INCLUDED MY NAME, BUT ALSO REQUEST THAT IT BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. MY HOPE WAS THAT PROVIDING THE INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALLY WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR THE SENATE TO CONSIDER THE SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE MYSELF, MY FAMILY, OR ANY WOMAN'S FAMILY VULNERABLE TO THE PERSONAL ATTACKS AND INVASIONS OF PRIVACY THAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE MY INFORMATION BECAME PUBLIC. AND A LETTER DATED AUGUST 31ST, SENATOR FEINSTEIN WROTE THAT SHE WOULD NOT SHARE THE LETTER WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT CONSENT, AND I APPRECIATED THIS COMMITMENT. SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHEN AND WHETHER THEIR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE IS MADE PUBLIC. AS THE HEARING DATE GOT CLOSER, I STRUGGLED WITH A TERRIBLE CHOICE. DO I SHARE THE FACTS AND IT PUTS MY FAMILY IN THE SPOTLIGHT? OR DO I PRESERVE OUR PRIVACY AND ALLOW THE SENATE TO MAKE ITS DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING THE FULL TRUTH OF HIS PAST BEHAVIORS? I AGONIZED DAILY ABOUT THIS DECISION THROUGHOUT AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 2018. THE SENSE OF DUTY THAT ORIGINALLY MOTIVATED ME TO REACH OUT CONFIDENTIALLY TO "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND IT TO'S OFFICE, WHEN THERE WAS STILL A LIST OF EXTREMELY SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THE SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS TH, SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THB SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THT SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THM SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THY SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THF SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THA SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THS SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES, AND SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS ALWAYS THF SPEAKING OUT OF STARTED TO EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE. IT DURING AUGUST 2018, THE PRESS REPORTED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION WAS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN. PERSONS PAINTED HIM AS A CHAMPION OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND EMPOWERMENT. AND I BELIEVED THAT IF I CAME FORWARD, MY SINGLE VOICE WOULD BE DROWNED OUT BY A CHORUS OF POWERFUL SUPPORTERS. BY THE TIME OF THE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS, I HAD RESIGNED MYSELF TO REMAIN QUIET. AND LETTING THE COMMITTEE AND THE SENATORS MAKE THEIR DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD DONE TO ME. ONCE THE PRESS STARTED REPORTING ON THE EXISTENCE OF THE LETTER, I FACED MOUNTING PRESSURE. REPORTERS APPEARED AT MY HOME AND AT MY WORKPLACE. DEMANDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE LETTER. IN THE PRESENCE OF MY GRADUATE STUDENTS. THEY CALLED MY BOSSES AND COWORKERS AND LEFT ME MANY MESSAGES, MAKING IT CLEAR THAT MY NAME WOULD INEVITABLY BE RELEASED TO THE MEDIA. I DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY TO A JOURNALIST WHO HAD ORIGINALLY RESPONDED TO THE TIP I HAD SENT TO "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND WHO HAD GAINED MY TRUST. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE DETAILS OF THE ASSAULT IN MY OWN WORDS. SINCE THE SEPTEMBER 16TH, THE DATES OF "THE WASHINGTON POST" STORY, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE OF THIS COUNTRY. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES DRAMATICALLY ALTERED BY SEXUAL VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED OUT TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND HAVE THANKED ME FOR COMING FORWARD. WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY. AT THE SAME TIME, MY GREATEST FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED, AND THE REALITY HAS BEEN FAR WORSE THAN WHAT I EXPECTED. MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF CONSTANT HARASSMENT AND OF DEATH THREATS, AND I HAVE BEEN CALLED THE MOST VILE AND HATEFUL NAMES IMAGINABLE. THESE MESSAGES, WHILE FAR FEWER THAN THE EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT, HAVE BEEN TERRIFYING AND HAVE ROCKED ME TO MY CORE. PEOPLE HAVE POSTED MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THAT OF MY PARENTS ONLINE ON THE INTERNET. THIS HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EMAILS, CALLS, AND THREATS. MY FAMILY AND I WERE FORCED TO MOVE OUT OF OUR HOME. SINCE IT SEPTEMBER 16TH, MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN VISITING ANNA VARIOUS SECURE LOCATIONS, AT TIMES SEPARATED, AND AT TIMES TOGETHER, WITH THE HELP OF SECURITY GUARDS. THIS PAST TUESDAY EVENING, MY WORK EMAIL WAS HACKED, AND MESSAGES WERE SENT OUT, TRYING TO RECANTS MY DESCRIPTION OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. APART FROM THE ASSAULT ITSELF, THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE. I HAVE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA IN FRONT OF THE WORLD. AND I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE PICKED APART BY PEOPLE ON TELEVISION, ON TWITTER, OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA. OTHER MEDIA, WHO HAVE NEVER MET ME OR SPOKEN WITH ME. I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL MOTIVES. OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT DO NOT KNOW ME. I AM AN INDEPENDENT PERSON, AND MY MOTIVATION AND COMING FORWARD WAS TO BE HELPFUL AND TO PROVIDE FACTS ABOUT HOW MR. KAVANAUGH'S ACTIONS HAVE IMPACTED MY LIFE SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE INTO SERIOUS CONSIDERATION, AS YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED. IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER MR. KAVANAUGH DESERVES TO SIT ON THE SUPREME COURT. MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I UNDERSTAND THAT A PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN HIRED AT TO ASK ME QUESTIONS, AND I AM COMMITTED TO DOING MY VERY BEST TO ANSWER THEM. I HAVE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY A PROSECUTOR, AND I WILL DO MY BEST. AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE JUDGING MY CREDIBILITY, I DO HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH EACH OF YOU, AND AT THIS POINT, I WILL DO MY BEST
