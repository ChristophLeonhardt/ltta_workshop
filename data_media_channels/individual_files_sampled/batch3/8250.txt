COOPERATE IN THAT FASHION. Shannon: A LOT OF PEOPLE PUTTING THESE SIDE-BY-SIDE HAVE THOSE SAME QUESTIONS. ANDY, THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT ANALYSIS ALWAYS. THANKS, SHANNON. Shannon: NEWLY REVEALED TEXT MESSAGES LOOMING LARGE TONIGHT IN WHICH FBI AGENT PETER STRZOK TELLS FBI ATTORNEY LISA PAGE "WE WILL STOP IT," TALKING EVIDENCE OF AN ANTI-TRUMP DEEP STATE? REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM UTAH SITS ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. ONE OF YOUR COUNTERPARTS ACROSS THE AISLE, ADAM SCHIFF SAYS "NO DEEP STATE, NO SECRET SOCIETY, NO ANTI-TRUMP CABAL AT THE FBI. NO INDICATION THAT COMEY'S ERRORS OF JUDGMENT DID ANYTHING BUT HELP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. NO VINDICATION FOR THE PRESENT. ALL, MY GOSH. HAS HE BEEN LIVING ON MARS? NOTHING'S GOING ON HERE. I THINK MR. McCARTHY EARLIER SAID IT WELL. YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE EXAMPLES OF THE ANIMOSITY TOWARDS THIS PRESIDENT AND THE VISCERAL HATRED TOWARD THIS PRESIDENT DEMONSTRATED WITH SOME OF THESE FBI, SENIOR FBI OFFICIALS AND THEN JUST PRESUME THAT NONE OF THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN THEIR WORK ARE IN THE WAY THAT THEY VIEWED THEIR DIFFERENT CASES ESPECIALLY WHEN SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE WORKING ON HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAIL THING AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE WORKING ON THE DONALD TRUMP RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. IT'S A STRETCH TO IMAGINE THOSE PERSONAL FEELINGS WOULDN'T INFLUENCE THEIR WORK AT SOME POINT. Shannon: ALL RIGHT. PETER STRZOK'S ATTORNEY, HE FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THIS REPORT, HE SAID "THE IG CONCLUDE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE POLITICAL VIEWS OF SPECIAL AGENTS STRZOK AND OTHERS IMPACTED THE HANDLING OF THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION." THAT IS REPEATED THERE WITH GENERAL SIZE THROUGHOUT THE 568 PAGES HERE BUT YOU ARE SAYING COMMON SENSE TELLS YOU OTHERWISE? I DON'T KNOW HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THAT LESSIE CAN CRAWL INSIDE YOUR MIND AND ACTUALLY EXAMINE THEIR MENTAL PROCESS. I WANT TO COMPLEMENT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR WHAT I THINK IS GENERALLY A VERY THOROUGH WORK. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO. HE'S BROUGHT FORTH INFORMATION THAT THOSE OF US ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN BEATING OUR HEADS AGAINST THE WALL TRYING TO GET FROM THE FBI. WE ARE GLAD HE'S DONE IT. SOME OF THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I'M JUST GOING TO AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THIS. HE CAN PRESUME WHETHER IT IMPACTED THE OUTCOME OF THEIR WORK WHEN IT SEEMS EXTRAORDINARY UNLIKELY. THIS IS FROM SOMEONE WHO DEFENDED DIRECTOR COMEY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. IT SHOWS THE OBVIOUS LACK OF LEADERSHIP. HOW IS IT THAT THE VERY SENIOR PEOPLE AROUND THE FBI, AND WE NOW KNOW THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY POLITICAL HACKS. LIBERAL POLITICAL HACKS. IT ISN'T JUST A COINCIDENCE. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CALLING HIS INSUBORDINATION AND POINTING OUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING HILLARY CLINTON, DOING THE SAME THING. THE NUMBER OF LEAKS IN THE MEDIA CONTACTS THAT SENIOR FBI OFFICIALS HAD NO BUSINESS TALKING TO THE MEDIA. ACCEPTING GIFTS FROM THE MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES. THE CULTURE IN THE FA UNDER THAT LEADERSHIP ABSOLUTELY HAD TO CHANGE. Shannon: DIRECTOR WRAY SAYS IT HAS IN IT WELL AND HE WILL PUSH FORWARD. QUICKLY, THE ONE QUESTION YOU WANT ANSWER BECAUSE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL VIEW BEFORE THE SENATE AND HOUSE NEXT WEEK. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY ONE BOAT QUICKLY, IT WOULD BE, DID YOU REPORT CHANGE QUESTION WHAT DID YOU FEEL PRESSURE TO CHANGE A REPORT? I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE EVIDENCE QUESTION. I WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE THIS WORK. HE CAN'T BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE HIS WORK.
