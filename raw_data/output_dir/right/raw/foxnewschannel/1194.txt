WOULD BEGIN WITH A HYPOTHETICAL

8
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:18,162
THAT IS CAUSING SOME VERY REAL

BE NO NEED SINCE THERE IS -- IT

17
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:35,580
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HE IS

18
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,748
INNOCENT.

EVEN AS HE PREPARES FOR THAT

ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARDON MYSELF

38
00:01:08,146 --> 00:01:09,981
BUT WHY WOULD I DO THAT WHEN I

39
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:11,416
HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG?

40
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:13,084

THAT THE MUELLER PROBE IS

44
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:21,359
TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

45
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,060
>> President Trump: IT'S NOT

46
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,728
EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL.

47
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,497

MYRIAD REASONS WHY MUELLER HAS

00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:40,778
NO LEGAL STANDING TO ASK FOR AN

55
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:41,813

ATTORNEYS JOHN DOWD AND JAY

57
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:44,515
SEKULOW ARGUE THE PRESIDENT

58
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,384
COULD COME IF YOU WISH,

59
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:47,318
TERMINATE THE INQUIRY OR EVEN

60
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:52,356
EXERCISE HIS POWER TO PARDON.

61
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:55,359
DEMOCRATS RUSHED TO SAY NO, HE

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:55,727
COULDN'T.

63
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:56,561
>> IT'S NOT THE RULE OF TRUMP.

UNDER IN THE UNITED STATES OF

66
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,198
AMERICA.

67
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:03,334
EVEN IN 1974, RICHARD NIXON'S

68
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,202
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MADE IT QUITE

69
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,137
CLEAR THAT NIXON COULD NOT

70
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,606
PARDON HIMSELF.

71
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,775
THE SAME THING IS TRUE HERE.

HAVE THE POWER PARTED

76
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:23,087
HIMSELF THOUGH TO DO SO WOULD BE

77
00:02:23,087 --> 00:02:23,588
POLITICAL SUICIDE.

78
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:24,188
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE

79
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:24,922
UNITED STATES PARDONING HIMSELF

80
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:26,891
WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE AND WOULD

81
00:02:26,891 --> 00:02:30,695
LEAD TO PROBABLY IMMEDIATE

82
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:31,095
IMPEACHMENT.

83
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,797

85
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,165
PARDON.

86
00:02:34,165 --> 00:02:38,069
>> THE PRESIDENT HASN'T DONE

87
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,170
ANYTHING AND TRICKLE WRONG AND

88
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,238
WOULD NEED ONE.
