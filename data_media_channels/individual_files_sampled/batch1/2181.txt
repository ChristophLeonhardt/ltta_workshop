when I say that out loud 50% of inner-city school kids do not graduate high school that is a national catastrophe we should bring the armed all alarm bells it's not fair we've made a huge effort globally but in the United States but getting kids jobs so this is one piece of it the South Bronx without the affinity schools needed more than most it's a observe tone so Jake Moore chase banks a lot of people here we need to get kids with gain out of high school who go on with the job or go on to college and that leads to a job you saw the kids today they're all getting jobs are smiling they're proud of themselves and that's what we need to do in our inner-city schools you've said the the lack of opportunity for kids growing up in this area is a moral and economic crisis how does that happen exactly it's not just this area so you have unemployment now going below you know 4.4 percent this morning but if you go to a lot of inner city school inner cities the unemployment among youth like think of 17 to 25 is 20% or 25% so the fact that part of the country doing well doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on the part that isn't and so I think part of the problem is that jobs have been done locally so these kids can get jobs at the MTA there's a distribution company down here they know what these kids being trained in they were they were part of the training effort business has to be involved locally with civic society in this case schools to get the kids trained to have a job there are plenty of jobs out there and so when people talk about the problems you know I would say well what's the solution what do you want what the outcome you want how you gonna get there I think civic society and business have to do it together it's not going to work one without the other when I say that out loud fifty percent of inner-city school kids do not graduate high school that is a national catastrophe we should bring them the arms off alarm bells it's not fair you know we were land of opportunity you know we will never have equal outcomes but you could have equal opportunity among those kids we might have had a Colin Powell or Albert Einstein we never know so I just think it's just part of running a good society you know people's get involved in fixing that particular problem
