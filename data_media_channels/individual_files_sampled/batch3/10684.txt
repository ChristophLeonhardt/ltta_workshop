kids don't want a bulletproof backpack they want their own backpack they want their JanSport their Patagonia their North Face they want their own identity we we did not want to change that we did not want to force them into something that they didn't want so as an alternative we decided to take our technology around plate and create a thin profile plate that would fit perfectly in the back of a backpack until Parkland and Santa Fe this last school year where I made the decision that I had to put something in my kids backpack so I took a law-enforcement plate which is a level 3a just like the pack protect material and just like the pack protect capability and I put this in their backpacks and one day at school my son told his friends my dad put a plate in my backpack he showed them and the reaction was why don't we have something like that
