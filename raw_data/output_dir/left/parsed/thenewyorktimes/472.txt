It was normal life.
I have everything there.
I had my own house.
I had a car.
I had money.
I had everything in Aleppo,
but I didn't feel my freedom.
But after the war,
I lost everything,
but I had my freedom.
I'm Dr. Farida I'm from Aleppo.
I was working in M2 hospital.
I was the OB-GYN there.
It was my dream to be a doctor.
In Aleppo and in Idlib also,
it's very necessary to be
an OB-GYN, because there
is not many OB-GYN in Syria
and in Aleppo.
Hi.
This is our dinner from
the besieged Aleppo.
We have some macaroni with
garlic and some yogurt.
Nothing else.
Hospitals are
always is a target,
because they have airplanes
always targeting all hospitals
in Aleppo.
When we evacuated from Aleppo,
there was just one hospital was
working.
And before the war it was
10, about 10 hospitals.
But he started to
target them one by one.
You are stuck, and you
can't go out of this area.
And they always bombing us.
They always killing us with
every weapon that you can
imagine in the world.
So our last weeks in Aleppo
was like a horror movie,
and it was in reality,
not just a movie.
I can dress what I want.
I can go where I want.
But in the regime areas,
in the regime held areas,
you can't do what you want.
You can't talk what you
want at the hospital.
When the regime know
that you are work--
that you were working at that
hospital, they will arrest you.
Because it's-- they'll consider
you as a terrorist if you are
working there.
Good morning, ,
Ranking member Cardin,
distinguished member
of the committee.
Thank you for the opportunity
to appear before you today.
It's our duty as a human being
to advocate all of the involved
parties on the ground to
allow him humanitarian access,
and to finally hold these
who violate international
humanitarian law accountable.
Later this month, my family
and I will return to Syria
to continue our work at the
hospital in Northern Syria.
The reason is simple.
It's our duty--
I want the world to know
what's happened in Syria,
and what's still happening.
Now it's happening in
 in, Homs,
in Al-Huta, and other
places, and in other places.
It not just happened in Aleppo.
Now it's happening once again.
And for chemical
attacks, we talked many,
many times about
chemical attacks.
And you know they have to
charge Assad regime with this,
but no one is talking.
And now he's targeting us with
chemical attack once again.
I have to be there to do my
work and to teach these doctors.
It's very important,
so we need to go back.
And it's my country also.
I miss my country.
