>> NFL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO SUFFER FROM BRAIN DAMAGE AS A
RESULT OF THE SPORT THEY PLAY.
INVOLVED A NUMBER OF NFL PLAYERS
THAT SUFFERED FROM SEVERE
DEPRESSION AND SOME WHO EVEN
COMMITTED SUICIDE AS A RESULT.
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS FOUND
BECAUSE OF THE CONSTANT HEAD
TRAUMA THAT NFL PLAYERS HAVE TO
EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT THEY ARE
LIKELY TO DEVELOP A CONDITION
KNOWN AS CTE.
IT COULD LEAD TO
THINGS LIKE MEMORY LOSS, MOOD
SWINGS, IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND
ALSO DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL
THOUGHTS.
RESEARCHERS OF BEEN
DELVING INTO THIS ISSUE EVEN
FURTHER AND RECENTLY Ã± THAT
NUMBER IS PRETTY HIGH BUT WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU STUDY THE
BRAINS OF NFL PLAYERS
SPECIFICALLY?
THESE BRAINS THAT
WERE STUDIED BY THESE
RESEARCHERS WERE DONATED BY
FAMILY MEMBERS OF DECEASED
FOOTBALL PLAYERS YOU HAVE
SUSPICIONS THAT THE PLAYERS HAD
CTE.
THE SAMPLE IS SOMEWHAT SKEWED
AND THE ACTUAL NUMBERS
MIGHT BE LOWER.
>> THE NUMBERS ARE SO HIGH THAT
IT STILL GIVES YOU A SHOCKING
PERSPECTIVE INTO HOW DEEP THIS
PROBLEM IS. 99%, THAT 
IS
UNBELIEVABLE.
IT IS 
ENORMOUSLY
DISHEARTENING BECAUSE I LOVE
FOOTBALL.
I AM JUST BEING
TOTALLY HONEST ON MY HYPOCRISY
ON 
THIS ISSUE.
>> AMONG COLLEGE PLAYERS IT'S
91%.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR
YEARS OF BANGING MY HEAD.
I
THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING IN
COLLEGE.
THERE ARE TWO FACTORS,
THERE'S AN EXCELLENT CHANCE I
WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
THE SCHOOL I
WENT TO IS NOT KNOWN FOR
FOOTBALL.
THE OTHER THING IS IT
TAKES TOO LONG.
IF I PLAY
FOOTBALL AND THEY HAVE ME
PRACTICE EIGHT HOURS A DAY I'M
WORRIED ABOUT MY GRADES.
SO I
PLAYED A MUCH LESS VIOLENT
SPORT, RUGBY.
BUT YOU ARE NOT
CONSTANTLY BANGING HEADS.
THE
HELMET MIGHT BE THE MOST
IRONICALLY DANGEROUS INVENTION
WE HAVE HAD TO PROTECT ATHLETES
EVER.
>>I WANT TO QUICKLY GO BACK TO
THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEONE IS HYPOCRITICAL IF THEY
CONTINUE TO WATCH FOOTBALL
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW.
AT
LEAST NOW THE INFORMATION IS OUT
THERE AND THE NFL IS NOT
ATTEMPTING TO COVER IT UP.
ONE
OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE STORY
WAS THE SCANDAL INVOLVING THE
NFL TRYING TO BRUSH THIS UNDER
THE RUG.
ADULTS COULD NOT MAKE A
DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WANTED TO PLAY FOOTBALL OR
WANTED TO ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO
PLAY IT.
I SAW THAT AS A
PROBLEM.
IF THE INFORMATION IS
OUT THERE AND IT IS WELL-KNOWN
THAT THIS IS A POTENTIAL RISK OF
PLAYING THE SPORT, THEN PEOPLE
GET TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
>>I KNOW.
I FEEL THE SAME WAY
ABOUT MMA AND I DON'T WATCH IT.
IT IS 
MODERN-DAY 
MANDINGO
FIGHTS.
IT IS MISSING THE RACIAL
COMPONENT.
BUT WE ARE BASICALLY
THROWING THEM IN THE RING AND
SAYING RIP EACH OTHER APART.
BUT
STILL THERE IS SOMETHING
UNSETTLING 
ABOUT IT.
>> YES.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO
WATCH FOOTBALL KNOWING THAT 99%
OF NFL PLAYERS WILL GET THIS
DEGENERATIVE BRAIN DISEASE?
IT
IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION AND I
DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY YOU ARE
GOING TO COME OUT ON IT.
>> I WILL ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO
VOTE IN OUR POLL IF YOU DON'T
WATCH FOOTBALL ANYWAY.
FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO WATCH FOOTBALL WILL
YOU CONTINUE TO WATCH IT KNOWING
HOW MUCH IT DOES DAMAGE TO
ATHLETES?
JUMPING FROM 21%
CHANCE OF WHEN YOU PLAYED IN
HIGH SCHOOL TO 91% IF HE PLAYED
IN COLLEGE THAT IS A GIANT
DIFFERENCE.
IF YOUR KIDS ARE
THINKING OF GOING TO COLLEGE
DON'T THINK IT IS JUST THE NFL.
