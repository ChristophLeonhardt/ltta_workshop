athletes make tough opponents for politicians as Donald Trump has been learning and advocating civil rights in the field has a rich history it was 50 years ago this week that Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists at the Mexico City Olympics to put the mistreatment of black Americans in front of the whole world my next guest continues that tradition basketball legend Kareem abdul-jabbar also known for activism and intellect off the court and in a new essay today he recounts skipping those Olympics as a protest teaming up with Muhammad Ali and others to advocate an end to the Vietnam War on many of today's athletes cite his example and continue the path you have LeBron James wearing the I can't breathe t-shirt which drew attention to the police strangling an unarmed man in New York Eric garner or of course Colin Kaepernick who ignited a presidential-level debate over his protests of kneeling during the national anthem oh and LeBron and Kevin you're great players but no one voted for you keep the political commentary to yourself or someone once said shut up and dribble I'm not sure why it's so hard for so many NFL players to understand why Americans don't want to see the flag and the national anthem disrespected on Sunday on game day you have to stand proudly for the national anthem well you shouldn't be playing you shouldn't be there maybe you shouldn't be in the country we are honored to welcome Kareem abdul-jabbar to the beat he started a new action of his own memorabilia with some of the proceeds going to the skyhook foundation which helps kids in need thanks for coming on the show well thank you for having me Ari you look at this history that you've been involved in and now writing about what do you see as the legacy and what's important for athletes and fans to do right now well the legacy is the incredible legacy of the civil rights movement that's what we're dealing with right now the problems that Colin Kapernick was trying to call attention to are the same problems that black Americans were dealing with immediately after the Second World War when you know the civil rights woman really took off and gained steam and in your in your new essay you compare this to 68 which was of course a big year for activism in a lot of ways reading reading a little to Kareem for you to build on you say outspoken athletes of today face the same hostility from good people who are just ignorant the facts from those who are terrified of the gradual Browning of America and from those who profit from social disparity can you speak a little bit about that because in this polarized time I couldn't help but notice in reading that you are definitely clarifying that there are plenty of as you put it good people who might have an initial negative reaction and it seems like you're trying to dialogue with them yeah I am because what what I don't feel that they understand is the athletes who were taking a knee during his playing of the national anthem we're trying to bring attention to a problem the fact that black Americans are killed unnecessarily at a ridiculous rate and they were trying to bring attention to that problem they were not trying to disrespect our country or the flag or our military what they want to call attention to the fact that America is not walking it like it supposedly talks it and that is what the issue is all about right and so how do you also square that with the the kind of status that some fans and some Americans seem to want to hold a fleet's and specifically black athletes in and we played some of the clips there and I think it's a range but when you hear this idea that athletes somehow should stay out of politics well all of us in America are welcome to engage in politics but as we just showed there's this rich history what do you make of that that kind of view or even that kind of discrimination I think that's absurd you know Bill Bradley certainly didn't pay attention to that edik Tom McMillan another former NBA player who's run for office and had plenty to say about our political situation the fact that we have a certain profession does not mean that we can't have opinions on very important issues that are being discussed nationally and you know whoever suggested that LeBron keep quiet they they didn't know what they were talking about mm-hmm and then you have in Donald Trump someone who used to make a big deal out of his relationships with prominent black America certainly prominent celebrity black Americans and then just totally flipped his message when he went into racist birtherism and then 2016 campaigning take a look look at my african-american over here look at him are you the greatest and we're going to work on our ghetto spot do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump what do you have to lose what the hell do you have to lose I'd say in contrast to some of the folks you address in your new essay Donald Trump according to many civil rights leaders is not worth dialoguing with at least at this time so what do you say to people about that and how to how to make impact well we have to do what we can do to to change the situations we have a lot of work to do we have to register people to vote and we have to understand what the issues are and appeal to Americans on the basis of the issues that they all hold common that's just common sense that that's the way the American political system works and I believe that's how we will get past this moment mm-hmm let me close with some of the good stuff as well I want to hear a little bit more about what you're doing with your foundation which sounds really positive and we also while we got you here on sports wanted to know what you think about LeBron going to the Lakers could he ever be the top three or best ever basketball player do you want to weigh in on that long-running debate well I'm really thrilled that LeBron is is coming here to Los Angeles to play he brings a whole lot to the table not just on the court off the court his leadership and I'm sure that he's gonna be a very positive addition to the Laker team but you know as far as my auction is concerned I'm working with golden auctions the auction stops on October 27th and people want to know about how they can get a piece of my career they can go to a golden auctions.com and they can find
