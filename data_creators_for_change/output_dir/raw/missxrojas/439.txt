maps that was really fun also the

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,829
internet seems like this new exciting

19
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,719
project is called Potter wall when

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,129
you've been working as a bookseller for

21
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,540
quite a while you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice when</font>

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,399
there are changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spines on the</font>

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,930
shelves I noticed this week that a

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,309
famous five books had shifted along

25
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">about an inch as a bit confused why</font>

26
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,579
because I can notice any immediate

27
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,930
differences and then I noticed there

28
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">were two new famous five books having</font>

29
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,870
established the fact that you know

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">blyton did not in fact wise from the</font>

31
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,890
dead and as a zombie pen to new famous

32
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,809
five novels realize that they were in

33
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,969
fact choose-your-own-adventure versions

34
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,700
of the first two novels in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> famous</font>

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,260
five series which kind of annoyed me to

36
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,880
say the least I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in</font>

37
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,560
shock more than anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean of</font>

38
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,790
all the things make choose your own

39
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,860
adventure novels what feels like slicing

40
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,630
and dicing I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to read them</font>

41
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,549
just to find out how they achieved that

42
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,200
and how they managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create the same</font>

43
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,909
story five on a treasure island was one

44
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,500

48
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,430
started thinking about the other books

49
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would make really good choose your</font>

50
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,369
own adventure nobles and for some reason

51
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,799
I started thinking about ethics there

52
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,720
has to be a choose-your-own-adventure

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,100

and a page 43 if you believe that

eat the apple turn to page 666 very last

62
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,460
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was applying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for job recently</font>

63
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,170
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to give some references</font>

64
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,180
I've done lots of work outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

65
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,469
box but I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it's about</font>

66
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done loads of</font>

67
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,429
work outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this lovely box and have</font>

68
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,258
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make such good videos that</font>

69
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,569
they support themselves on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and</font>

70
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,140
how

71
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,700
you know they would go about using

72
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,410
references and getting references if

73
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,910
most of their work is based on line so

74
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,560
for example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they contribute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a blog</font>

75
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,270
and get paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and if they</font>

76
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,010
contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to youtube and get paid for</font>

77
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,690
it because the jobs i apply for us the

78
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">reference is like on a letterhead you</font>

79
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,860
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> email the CEO of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google and</font>

80
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,080
be like hey I'm a YouTube partner can

81
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280

83
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,880
if you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so inclined to write me a</font>

84
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,530
reference that would be great as I get

85
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,209
older I am starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize more and</font>

86
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,370
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are really traditional</font>

87
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,290
in our job industry and how that

88
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,090
conflicts would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everything I do and</font>

89
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,010
everything my friends do I like stay

90
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,390

91
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to tell other people what</font>

his job was because they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

93
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,610
really understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so he decided</font>

94
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to instead just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go with a storyteller I</font>

95
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,930
tell stories which I would argue is what

96
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,630
we all do time for a cup of tea<font color="#E5E5E5"> bye I</font>
