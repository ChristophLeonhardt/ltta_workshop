>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, WE'RE COMING
BACK ON THE AIR RIGHT NOW 
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
MELANIA TRUMP ARE ABOUT A APPEAR
IN THE WHITE HOUSE GARDEN FOR 
THE VICTIMS OF THE DEAD LIEST 
SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
THE COLOR GUARD COMING OUT RIGHT
NOW AS WELL AND HERE COMES 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST 
LADY.
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND HIS 
WIFE, KAREN, THERE AS WELL.
>>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST 
LADY, THE VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
AND WIFE KAREN GOING BACK INTO 
THE WHITE HOUSE.
THAT IS WAS MEMORY OF THE 58 
DEAD AND THE OVER 400 INJURED.
WHITE HOUSE STAFF FLANKED ON THE
LAWN THERE AS WELL.
BRIAN ROSS, AND WE'RE LEARNING 
MUCH MORE NOW ABOUT THE SHOOTER,
STEPHEN PADDOCK.
64, ACTED ALONE AND KILLED 
HIMSELF.
STILL SEARCHING FOR A MOTIVE.
>> WE KNOW HE SPENT SEVERAL 
WEEKS STOCKPILING WEAPONS AND 
AMMUNITION.
GOT A VERY HARD TO ATTAIN 
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
BUT HE WAS A VERY UNREMARKABLE 
PERSON AT AGE 64 HE MOVED TO A 
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF 
LAS VEGAS.
HIS BROTHER SAYS HE WAS NOT 
POLITICAL, HE HAD SOME MONEY AND
LIVED MOSTLY TO PLAY VIDEO 
POKER.
>> UNREMARKABLE, PERHAPS, BUT 
PIERRE THOMAS, A MAN THAT BUILT 
UP QUITE AN ARSENAL.
19 GUNS IN THE ROOM THAT WE SEE 
THE WINDOW BLOWN OUT RIGHT 
THERE.
>> HE CAME ARMED TO KILL.
OUR SOURCES TELLING US ROUGHLY 
20 GUNS, 19 GUNS I WAS SPECIALLY
TOLD IN THAT ROOM AS HE FIRED 
DOWN ON THOSE UNSUSPECTING 
PEOPLE TRYING TO ENJOY A 
BEAUTIFUL SUNDAY NIGHT OF A 
CON
CONCERT, GEORGE.
LAW ENFORCEMENT TRYING TO 
DETERMINE WHERE THE GUNS CAME 
FROM.
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THEY WERE
BOUGHT AUTOMATIC, IF THEY WERE 
AUGMENTED TO BECOME AUTOMATIC.
A HUGE INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW.
NOTHING REMARKABLE IN HIS 
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND TO SUGGEST 
HE WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
>> THE AUTHORITIES HAVE KNOCKED 
DOWN A CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY 
FROM AN ISIS WEBSITE.
WE WANT TO GO TO MATT GUTMAN WHO
IS ON THE SCENE.
THIS WAS A SCENE OF PURE TERROR 
AND PANIC THAT UNFOLDED ABOUT 
10:07 LAS VEGAS TIME.
>> GEORGE, WE WERE ABLE TO SEE 
DOWN INTO THE CONCERT VENUE, AND
WHAT WE SAW WAS INCREDIBLY 
DISTURBING.
THE DEBRIS OF WHAT HUNDREDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND.
THERE WAS STRETCHESBANDAGES ON  
DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE THE 
SHOOTER WAS AND THE CONCERT 
VENUE.
WE THINK ABOUT THE MASS AMOUNT 
OF BULLETS AND FIRE FIRED IN 
THERE.
IT WAS DEADLY ACCURATE AND 
ASTONISHING GIVEN THE VAST 
DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SITES
AND THE TYPES OF WEAPONS, THE AR
TYPE RIVFLES.
VERY DISTURBING.
THERE ARE FIRST RESPONDERS GOING
THROUGH AND COMING THROUGH AND 
FORENSIC TEAMS TRYING TO FIND 
WHATEVER EVIDENCE THEY CAN AND 
PICK UP ANY PIECES THEY CAN. 
>> SURVEILLANCE VIDEO LIKELY TO 
PICK UP MORE EVIDENCE IN THE 
COMING DAYS AS WELL.
THIS MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE 
VICTIMS.
LINDSEY DAVIS IS AT THE HOSPITAL
WHERE THEY TOOK IN HUNDREDS OF 
VICTIMS.
YOU HAVE EVERY HOSPITAL IN THE 
AREA DEALING WITH THIS TRAUMA.
>> YES, 515 PEOPLE INJURED.
WE JUST MOVED AWAY, BUT UMC IS 
JUST ACROSS THE STREET OVER 
HERE, IN THIS PARKING LOT THEY 
BROUGHT IN A BUNCH OF RV'S, AND 
THIS IS A POP UP, IMPROMPTU 
BLOOD DRIVE.
WE'RE TOLD AT SOME LOCATIONS 
THERE IS A FIVE HOUR WAIT, RIGHT
NOW THEY'RE AT CAPACITY.
IT'S JUST ONE WAY THAT THE 
COMMUNITY IS RALLYING AROUND THE
VICTIMS JUST ACROSS THE STREET 
WE HAVE ABOUT A DOZEN PEOPLE 
STILL FIGHTING FIR OR THEIR LIV.
12 PEOPLE STILL IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION.
>> THE DTRAUMA FROM THIS DAY WIL
LAST WELL BEYOND AS WELL.
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, 
THOSE VICTIMS ON THE SCENE, 
LINDSEY.
>> YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
I THINK THAT IS THE LARGE THING 
SO IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THE 
COMMUNITY IS THEY'RE EAGER DO 
WHATEVER IS TAKES.
THERE IS A GO FUND ME PAGE, 
GIG
GIVING DONATIONS TO THE VICTIMS,
FREE FOOD AND CHARGING STATIONS,
TRYING TO ERASE SOME OF THE 
UGLINESS OF THE DAY.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU LINDSEY 
DAVIS, NO WORDS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT AT THAT MOMENT OF 
SILENCE HONORING THE VICTIMS 
EARLIER IN THE DAY.
HE CALL IT'D AN ACT OF PURE EVIL
AND CALLED ON ALL MILES PER 
HOURS TO COME TOGETHER AT THIS 
MOMENT.
>> YES, THIS IS A DAY FOR 
CONSOLING THE SIRURVIRURVIVORS  
HAS ORDERED ALL FLAGS FLY AT 
HALF-STAFF TODAY.
THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING JUST 
ENDED MOMENTS AGO, AND THERE WAS
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN THERE 
FOR SARAH SANDERS ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S POSITION ON GUN 
CONTROL GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN 
LAS VEGAS TODAY.
THEY SAY THIS IS NOT THE PLACE 
OR TIME FOR POLITICAL DEBATE.
SURELY THIS IS A QUESTION THAT 
WILL CONTINUE TO COME BACK AT 
THIS WHITE HOUSE.
I ALSO ASKED SARAH SANDERS IF HE
CONSIDERS IT AN ACT OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM.
THEY SAY IT IS PREMATURE.
THIS IS AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT FOR 
THOSE IN THE WHITE HOUSE IS AN 
UNDER STATEMENT.
SARAH HASANDERS HAD A VERY 
EMOTIONAL IN A MOMENT.
>> SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY.
DAVID MUIR WILL BE IN LAS VEGAS 
TONIGHT FOR A SPECIAL EDITION OF
"WORLD NEWS."
>>> THIS HAS BEEN
