ONE WALK APPEARED FOR MONTHS THAT WE'VE SEEN PROTESTS THAT CAME TO A HEAD DURING THE NOT CONFIRMATION. SUCH PROMINENT ISSUES RIGHT UP THERE AS THE FIRST LINE OF THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE FOR THE MIDTERMS. THIS NOVEMBER, VOTE FOR JOBS, NOT MOBS. STEVE: JOBS NOT MOBS! JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE PRESIDENTS PROPONENTS IN THE MEDIA STARTED TO PUSH BACK ON HIS ARGUMENT. SURE ENOUGH WE SAW THAT THIS MORNING ON THE SUNDAY SHOW WITH NBC CHUCK TODD AND CNN JAKE MAKING THE SAME POINT IN AN UNCANNILY SIMILAR WAY. THIS IS NANCY PELOSI IN MIAMI FACING A MOB AND MITCH McCONNELL IN KENTUCKY FACING A MOB. LOOK AT THIS YOU DON'T BELONG HERE. WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF MOB SCENES WHERE LEADERS OF THE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS WERE BOTH PUBLICLY HARASSED. OF ANGRY PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. IT IS NOT MADE UP ITS UGLY, IT IS BAD AND I THINK LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES NEED TO ACCEPT THAT. STEVE: THEY BOTH GOT THE SAME MEMO FROM ANTI-TRUMP HQ. YOU CAN SEE WHAT CHUCK AND JAKE ARE TRYING TO DO PAY THEY WANT TO LOOK NEUTRAL. THESE HATE FILLED MOBS IS NOT JUST THE DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS DO IT TOO. IT IS BOTH SIDES. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? CHUCK AND JAKE GO WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP CHARLOTTESVILLE DEFENSE, BLAME ON BOTH SIDES. NO ACTUALLY, AS I SAID THE TIME, IT WAS NOT BOTH SIDES THEN. AND THERE'S NOT BOTH SIDES NOW. CHUCK COMPOUNDED TIME TO BE SEEN A REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS INCITING HARASSMENT LIKE THIS? IF YOU SEE ANYBODY FROM THAT CABINET IN A RESTAURANT, IN A DEPARTMENT STORE, AT A GASOLINE STATION. YOU GET OUT AND YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE NOT WELCOME. ANYMORE, ANYWHERE. STEVE: WHERE IS THE SENATE CALLING FOR THIS? DON'T GO TO HOME, GO TO THE HILL TODAY. GET UP AND PLEASE, GET UP IN THE FACE OF SOME CONGRESS PEOPLE. STEVE: CAN EITHER OF YOU IMAGINE PAUL RYAN TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE, FELLOW AMERICANS LIKE THIS? YOU HAVE TO HAVE TOTAL CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WE DO. WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, IMMIGRATION, AND SAFETY, CLIMATE, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT CLIMATE AND IF THERE IS SOME COLLATERAL DAMAGE FOR SOME OTHERS WHO DO NOT SHARE OUR VIEW, SO BE IT. STEVE: COLLATERAL DAMAGE? MY GOD! NEVERMIND A LACK OF CIVILITY. THAT IS THE LANGUAGE OF CIVIL WAR. IT IS NOT BOTH SIDES, IT IS THE LEFT DRIVING THE HATE AND INTOLERANCE AND VIOLENCE AND RAGE. AND THEY HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE 2016 WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE VOTED FOR REAL CHANGE AND REJECT THE FAILED ELITIST ESTABLISHMENT THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS IN THE LATEST MEDIA SEEM TO LOVE SO MUCH. EVEN THOUGH FOR DECADES, THE SAME ESTABLISHMENT WITH HIS POMPOUS NORMS AND CORRUPT CIVILITY, RUIN THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS. THIS RAGE AND HATE AND INTOLERANCE ON THE LEFT IS ALL PART OF THE COLLAPSE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY ONCE STOOD FOR WORKING PEOPLE BUT NOW, IT'S UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION, IT HURTS THE WORKING CLASS MOST. THEY USED TO BE AGAINST BIG MONEY AND POLITICS BUT NOW THEY OVERLAP IN THE LIKES OF GEORGE SOROS. THEY SAY THAT FOR WOMEN BUT MAKE EXCUSES FOR THEIR OWN ABUSERS. WHETHER IS KEITH ELLISON IN MINNESOTA OR BILL CLINTON IN THE OVAL OFFICE. AS WE SAW YET AGAIN FROM HILLARY THIS WEEK. THEN PERHAPS, THE MOST HUMILIATING COLLAPSE OF ALL. ELIZABETH WARREN. HE ONCE MADE A COMPELLING AND SUBSTANTIVE CASE AGAINST COURTNEY CAPITALISM NOW BLUNDERING INTO A MESS OF HER OWN MAKING AS SHE ABANDONS POPULISM FOR DIVISIVE IDENTITY POLITICS. KNOWING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT AS A DEMOCRAT TODAY. WHAT A PATHETIC SPECTACLE. IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE SINCERE AND DECENT LEFT POPULIST LIKE BERNIE SANDERS AND TIM RISON AND OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE SOME WRONG IDEAS BUT AT LEAST ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE LIVES OF WORKING AMERICANS. TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THE
