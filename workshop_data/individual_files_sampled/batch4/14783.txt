really the media have been on trial here as much as if not more than Roy Moore and the week before the election there was one fake news scandal after another whether it was falsely reporting that Michael Flynn was going to testify that Donald Trump ordered him to contact the Russians during the election which never happened or whether it was falsely reporting that trumps bank records had been subpoenaed from Deutsche Bank which also didn't happen or the latest example before the weekend anyway was CNN getting the date wrong on a story which fundamentally changed the story originally they were reporting that Donald Trump jr. had contact with WikiLeaks before they released their huge archive of democratic files of course the date happened to be after that release not before so it turned out that WikiLeaks was trying to get in touch with him after they had already made all the files public there were a few other additional stories one about crowd size a picture that was tweeted too early from a rally in Pensacola on Friday that was done by a Washington Post reporter and it was just one thing after another the media couldn't have suffered a greater loss of credibility at a more politically sensitive time when essentially the accusations against broham or depend on the credibility of the media more even than the women who were accusing him of inappropriate behavior yes I mean in the whole Harvey Weinstein Weinstein Abba let's the cascading almost-daily revelations of senior people in media in politics now even senior restaurant tours are being exposed as who they were i think the democrats thought that they could turn roy more into a very meaningful example on the republican side but as you point out he's been in public life for decades for almost half a century very controversial he was a fighting judge he fought with other judges he fought in politics he had a bruisin primary against a candidate Donald Trump did not back Roy more in the primary so everyone was out to get Roy Moore really for 40 years the guy has had the hardest path possible and for allegations to come weeks before the election when there's been no hint of this for 40 years I think that stretches that some of the credulity as opposed to Harvey Weinstein that everyone sort of knew was a Lech that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
