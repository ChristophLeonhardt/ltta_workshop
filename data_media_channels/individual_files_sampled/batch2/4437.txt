hey he's the head of a country and I mean he is the strong head don't let anyone think anything different he speaks and his people sit up at attention I want my people to do the same he's the strong head of a country he speaks his people sit up at attention and I want my people to do the same the President of the United States wants the American people to give him the same attention that the North Korean people are forced to give their leader let's just take a moment to look at some of the atrocities documented about Kim jong-un's regime according to a 400-page UN report at least 120,000 people men women and children are being held in the for known political prisons according to Amnesty International former detainees in those camps say they were stripped of all sense of being human there is no thinking no free will just fear that's a quote detainees caught rats to eat they were beaten by guards if caught with contraband cigarettes some died from the wounds from those beatings starvation just isn't an issue in the camps the regime uses starvation's a starvation as a means of control distributing food to those considered useful to the government one famine in the late 1990s killed an estimated 1 million people you want this for your people Donald Trump according to the New York Times since taking power in 2011 Kim jong-un has consolidate his and consolidated his power by using executions citing the Institute for national security strategy The New York Times says quote in the first six years as leader he has ordered the executions of at least three hundred and forty people Kim's own family has not spared his brutality in executions the same Times report says quote one of Kim's uncle's was convicted of treason and then executed with anti-aircraft machine guns his body incinerated with flamethrowers the u.s. also says there's evidence that North Korea was responsible for killing Kim's estranged brother last year at an airport with a chemical warfare agent no as vx you want that for your people Donald Trump is that why you want Americans to sit up and listen to you Trump is not ignorant of that oppression quoting his own words Trump has said quote an estimated 100,000 North Koreans suffer in gulags toiling in forced labor and enduring Storch ER starvation rape and murder on a constant basis end quote from the President of the United States so it's interesting that President Trump now says he has great respect for this North Korean leader he wants his people to do the same as North Koreans sit up and listen to a strong leader minutes after saying he wanted the American people to sit up in attention like they do in North Korea here is how the president tried to clarify his comments it was all a joke okay well then it's okay NBC's Jeff Bennett is live at the White House also with us is MSNBC terrorism analyst Malcolm Nance Malcolm I just want to start with you because you are a military man from a military family with generations you are taught to sit up straight and listen to your commander-in-chief this is something entirely different it absolutely is and in my family we were taught to sit up and pay attention and you know salute the flag so that other Americans could have the freedom and liberty to do as they please however that being said anyone who is in the service of this nation particularly the president of the United States must not only understand that they must execute that faithfully for the other citizens of the United States I don't believe that Donald Trump understands what his role is he sees that sitting with a murderous brutal dictator is the equivalent of bringing that dictator to our way of thinking that's not true it's the other way around we are seeing him emulate and show envy of that dictator at the time that he should be showing decorum and honor Jeff one of the things that the president said this morning is that what am I supposed to do in fact his quote is what am I supposed to do walk out and say terrible mean things I get along with him very well I've got good at chemistry I asked him about the remains he brought back the remains of he gave back the remains of great heroes what's he what's the strategy here what's he trying to do it's just not clear to the American people listening to Donald Trump what he's trying to achieve in praising Kim jong-eun who he raised to a new level of insult in past months that's right and I think it should be said that the u.s. in Western Allies ally for decades have often turned a blind eye to totalitarian regimes around the world often in the interest of us stability often at the expense of people living in those countries but American leaders up until this point have so often been very careful about the words they use to refer to those leaders as a way of trying to maintain some semblance of a moral high ground and yet the president having just returned from these talks with Kim has referred to him as funny smart very talented and said he loves his people even though we know that Kim is an accused human rights abuser hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button
