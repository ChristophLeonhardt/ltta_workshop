and what's happening now you speak out you're a racist you're a homophobe you're a an Islamophobe you cannot say anything today without being by the left I might add labeled and if there is a problem with in this country it's the left well we're in the homestretch of a municipal election campaign here in Toronto and there are literally signs everywhere but one little sign in North Toronto has become somewhat of a tempest in a teapot I'm standing here with Tony Dundas and Tony you erected this homemade sign on your lawn saying Shelley get a real job this is about former councillor Shelley Carroll first of all Tony tell us what does that sign mean well as you are aware should be aware Shelley resigned ran for the Liberal Party and lost walked away with somewhere I believe in the area of a hundred and twenty thousand dollar severance and now she's running again for Council which to me I'm just not real happy with that this is my way of protesting what she did gotcha and we live in a country where ostensibly we have freedom of speech this is private property this is your house you put up this sign and then one day somebody came knocking at the door and what happened Tony well I think this whole situation is somewhat smelly I was not home so my son answered the door and my neighbor across the street confirmed and this neighbor here confirmed what happened a City of Toronto truck pulled up in front of the house the gentleman in the car sat there for about 20 minutes he came to the door looked through our front window knocked on the window and then my son came to the door he did not identify himself he did not show any credentials and he did not leave me any paperwork he simply said you have to take down your sign because it violates the code it's considered third party advertised and he said either we take it down or you take it down yeah indeed by law has confirmed that they received one complaint they never say who it's from any ideas who it might be from Tony I don't want to speculate because that would be totally unreal but I think my son told me this guy looked like he worked in the parks department not as a bylaw officer he was wearing a green vest which most outside workers wear and that's all I can say about it really without I'm not gonna leap to conclusions I'm not gonna accuse anybody any of anything but to me it doesn't pass the smell test now believe it or not according to the city this indeed runs afoul of the I guess the Elections Act they say the extensible purpose of not allowing signs like this to go up they don't want any kind of third parties to unduly influence an election are you buying that Tony no no absolutely not this has nothing to do with the election this is my protest sign I have the right to protest I have the right to say what I want as long as I'm not about preaching violence or anything this preaches nothing and I'll tell you an interesting story I my cousin lives four doors up he drives by here constantly I talked to him today he was not even aware of the smaller printing he just saw Shelley he didn't read anything more and as you can see there's probably about 30 homes that would drive by this sign we live on a very quiet street so why are we making an issue and who is making the issue I again I I find it hard to believe that the city would send a bylaw officer here with no paperwork with nothing to inform me of my rights as to you must take it down or here's the ticket absolutely nothing and speaking of tickets you face a potential fine of $200 I understand should it go to the court level that could escalate to a maximum fine of $5,000 are you going to cave are you going to take that sign not take it down and I am prepared to go I'm gonna look for a pro bono lawyer I'm about I'm prepared to go to court about this and I'm prepared to launch a case with the Ontario Human Rights Commission because these people are this is a protest sign I wish they would get it through their head it's nothing to do with vote for or don't vote for and Tony what I think is perversely ironic about this is that you must be having a great belly laugh about this here we are on a very quiet little Crescent in North Toronto maybe in the days to come a couple of dozen would have seen this sign now you're getting newspaper coverage radio interviews here we are out here and so basically what I'm saying is this sign is getting exponential exposure if whoever the complainer was just shrugged and minded their own business absolutely and and that's what I don't get I'm just a quiet guy family raising kids we're looking after my dad and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of this explosion and you know I've been being getting calls all day today and you know one thing I have to say I looked at the comments that were posted on the Sun and I laughed my ass off I think I've struck a nerve with a lot of people who are disgruntled with politicians and I'm not a fan of politicians of all creeds I think most of them should not be here and also the speed in which the city has responded to this side is something else I understand this area you have some serious issues from flooding to traffic congestion to potholes to crime and that seems to be on the back burner but this little red and white sign well we better get the Batmobile dispatch well I know what you're saying and I just don't understand as I said it was a quiet little protest now that has exploded today believe it or not somebody that lives about a mile away found my house knocked on the front door and said I want to shake your and and as I said I think I've struck a nerve and you know if I can just say one thing I would I'd love what Rob Ford did about cutting council he should have gone one step further 2-year term limit and you're gone and you can never come back if you want to be a lobbyist you have to wait five years before you can be a lobbyist with the city and if you want to work for the city you wait another five years and but of course Shelley Carroll is the definition of a career politician she's been at the the game for so long and that's another point of contention with you isn't it Tony that her signage her official election sign which says reelect yet she stepped down she didn't have a council seat because she went to run for the Liberal Party for Ontario and you feel that is somewhat misleading well I think it gives her an unfair advantage half of the people never voted for Cheryl to Carroll in this new riding never voted for her because it was a different Ward everybody else is playing on one field that says elected and she says re-elected and I would suggest she get her little minions and her workers get a couple of rolls of duct tape and cover up the read and make it fair what about calling the signage police on Shelley Carroll apparently her opponents I've phoned a couple of them and said are you aware of this and apparently it has happened okay well what to see well it's we're just days away from October 22nd that's the big data I wonder if she stands a chance of getting elected in this writing in the meantime Tony you are I think you said earlier you are not taking this sign down you will fight it all the way what do you think the city's next move will be I think if Mary Ford or mayor Ford sorry meritorious Mart he'd just leave this alone and just to leave it alone nobody's none of my neighbors came this gentleman here came over and he read the sign and he hugged me you know I've struck a nerve people are sick and tired of the crap that goes on downtown and now the crap downtown is coming right up here uptown to your own private property and I guess you're saying enough is enough this is where you draw the line well absolutely I am I grew up in the 60s we protested we fought not to label people not to humiliate people and what's happening now you speak out you're a racist you're a homophobe you're a an islamaphobe you cannot say anything today without being by the left I might add labeled and if there is a problem with in this country it's the left and apparently you can't say Shelley get a real job well Toni good luck and keep fighting for freedom of speech my friend he'll do that and nice to meet you David well we reached out to the Shelley Carroll campaign in fact we're standing right now in front of the Shelley Carroll campaign office nobody was available to come on camera and explain their side of the story but as you can see lots of Shelley Carroll signs there's also a sign there for dr. Siham Royale for school trustee I guess Shelley Carroll is endorsing her there's also a copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the window I don't know why but speaking of signage I just find it a little odd that this campaign headquarters it's the former home of a massage parlor young sensation Wellness Spa I mean why wouldn't you cover that up with your own election signs in any event as the day's tick on to October 22nd only time will tell in terms of who will win the election and all of Toronto's now 25 wards and indeed if Shelley Carroll will receive a happy ending for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Benzies hey folks if you like the kind of journalism you get here at the rebel dot media the kind of journalism you aren't gonna get anywhere else please like and subscribe you
