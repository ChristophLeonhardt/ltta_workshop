all right all right all right it's the fall which means football is kicking off and every single Network is fighting for your viewership this fall with a host of new shows to choose from some look great some look yeah you know we'll see but one show in particular called New Amsterdam stood out to me specifically the reason why every critic seems to be jumping on this and saying it's such a great critique of the modern healthcare system and they're loving it because apparently it promotes socialized medicine so let's watch the trailer see if the shows can be good and where they're pushing a certain agenda let's find out but hopefully how did this kid he looks like he just like stumbled off this airplane how do you get through customs to come to the United States apparently he's come from a really hard country I wonder how how in the anyway well hope they talk about it let's let's find out hopefully support kid that's okay we perform the world's first c-section in the world's first maternity ward the Dean makes me tell it to every you recognize that guy that's Ryan Eggold if you remember he was on the black list and if you stand out in the show with James Spader you know you're good actor he's a fantastic actor so he's gonna do great for the show for sure medical director and how many of those have you worked with five in five years well everyone in the cardiac surgical department please raise your hands great great thank you you're all fired any department who places billing above care you will be terminated okay I kind of get where he's coming from like obviously want to focus on your care for your patient do the best job possible it's more important than your paycheck necessarily we want to do the best job there with our patients we get get in there but is that is this complaint that people aren't doing as good a job as they can do with the people that come in or that you're requiring a paycheck to see different patients you know when the doctors like keep in mind like a doctor's the average in the United States takes about ten to fifteen years to become a doctor but you get about quarter of a million dollars in debt how many people will want to go through that cycle to you know help all these people if you're not going to be able to be compensated for the time you spent away from your family having a life kids whatever the 15 years it takes to get to this spot if there's not any type of financial incentive to do so let's see if they talk about that so how can I help you know we all feel like the system is too big to change just gets problems that there's not enough doctors I wonder what would happen if you ask every doctor to donate their time for free how many people will donate the rest of their lives to this career being a doctor if they're not gonna be compensated and be able to have enjoy some aspects of life with their family and their outside of their career I wanted to be a more a greater shorter of doctors shortage of doctors if they did that against the TV show you know but we are the system and we need to change let's be doctors I can't let's be doctors I have to tape segments with the morning show I actually expect you to practice medicine because it's your job you're funny we have all of the reactions I think all the actors in this show looked phenomenal by the way I'm not harking on any actors I would you know any actor she would be would love to be on any kind of shows patient presenting all the signs of malaria TB oh no our poor kid has Ebola not a cold not a common cold he came flew the united states apparently smoking himself onto this aircraft because he has Ebola it had to come united states uh how is that possible how did he make it there anyway let's just continue so you just take a second sure what patient me this girl has been abused three times in the foster care system if you can't help Gemma as a doctor and just help her as a human being am I allowed to do that okay here's the thing it all sounds good and feels good all this kind of stuff like free health care for everything health care is a human right you should be able to do anything outside of your professional boundaries as a doctor with a patient the reason these are in place is because that not everyone is angels and if you have someone that's literally in control of your life and get to trust 100% telling you all kinds of things this can be abused very very very easily that's why there's a certain chain of command my wife's a nurse she's not allowed to do a whole bunch of different stuff with the patients there's a list of things that you can cannot do but obviously it sounds good in a TV show why don't you perform half as many procedures as your colleagues because there's other ways to help people then by cutting them open run the cardiac surgical department there is no cardiac surgical department at build one it's great for the trailer I didn't realize how would you do that if you're doing everything for free and your your Hospital you like I worry about profits anymore how are you gonna afford to build a new wing that can save hundreds and thousands of people's lives how you can afford to do that how you can just build a building how you gonna do that with your hopes and dreams again like a great slogan yeah this is where all those things thrown at you about universal health care and all these things there's a cost to everything there's a reason the United States you would fly to the United States if you had a bola or any major disease you're the best chance here it's because of the innovation that we have through incentives for different doctors and obviously there's different hospitals that donate their time and resources all the time and many doctors do do that and they should be praised for it but it running a hospital like that it's gonna take very quickly half the night half the hospitals united states are in deficit I are there they are running under the green so that's not the best way to be able to expand and help new people is it helmut now no no no don't go to Ebola with your gloves what do you want to happen nobody's ever asked me that that girl as an actor like this is just me I noticed that girl just crushed this same like there are so many levels in that emotion there I really hope this girl has a longer arc in the show than one episode because she looks like she's the real deal whoever that is working here being able to save someone else's sister someone's daughter to dream come true they're not gonna let you come in here and just help people so let's help as many as we can before they figure us out um yeah I think it's just the main thing with this show or any TV shows you understand like obviously this is it's not real life like house it was great probably best medical show ever it's not real life this show is obviously not gonna be real life but if they're peddling it as look see this is what can happen these are the things wrong with our health care system this is why we should have universal health care we should have socialized health care then then now I do have a problem with that I'm gonna have to call it on every time I see it but I hope the show itself is goodness tears away from that hopefully the critics are just trying to latch on to that aspect of the show but I will see this fall and I have a feeling that they will steer directly into that political sphere but hopefully not we'll see alright see ya all right so if you enjoyed that video please consider becoming a
