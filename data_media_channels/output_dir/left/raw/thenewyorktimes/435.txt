00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,540
Welcome to the Trump
International Hotel.

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,600
It is housed in Washington’s 
Old Post Office,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,180
owned by the
federal government.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,100
The Trump Organization holds a
60-year lease on the building.

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,470
The hotel is one example
at the center of a new lawsuit

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,520
filed by Maryland and the
District of Columbia this week.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,200
It claims President Trump has
used his position

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,170
to help his businesses and violated
the Constitution’s bans against

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,630
self-dealing by receiving payments
from foreign governments,

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,310
federal agencies and states.

11
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,020
During the week of Mr. Trump's
inauguration,

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,030
the minimum nightly rate at the
hotel was about $735 dollars

13
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:00,000
for a room like this one.
