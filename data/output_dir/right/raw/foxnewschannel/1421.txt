00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,236
TALENT.

18
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,605
WHEN SHE GROWS UP SHE WANTS TO

19
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,041
BE A FAMOUS POLICE OFFICER AND

20
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,442
THEN, WHEN SHE GETS TIRED OF

00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,544

23
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:37,545
THAT'S OKAY.

24
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:38,680
ABBY: WHAT A SWEET MOMENT THAT

25
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,215

00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:51,025
WHAT A SWEET MOMENT THAT WAS.

33
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,328
I WANT TO START LISA WITH YOU ON

34
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:55,463
THIS STORY OF KATHERINE BECAUSE

35
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,499
YOU ALL THOUGHT YOUR PARENTING

36
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:00,702
YEARS WERE OVER HOW DID CAT GET

37
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:01,369
INTO YOUR LIFE?

38
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,505
>>  WELL IT WAS IN 2012 WE WENT

39
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,674
TO THE MARCH FOR LIFE, THE MASS

40
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,077
AT ST. MATTHEWS AND THERE WAS A

41
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:11,045
GUEST SPEAKER THAT HAD ADOPTED

42
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:13,515
THEIR FAMILY HAD ADOPTED SIX OF

43
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:15,884
THEIR CHILDREN, ALL SIX OF THEM,

44
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:17,619
AND THE MOTHER LOOKED TO BE MY

45
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,054
AGE, AND SO I LATER GOT IN TOUCH

46
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:22,624
WITH HER AND SHE IN FACT WAS

47
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,528
CLOSE TO MY AGE WHICH WAS 48 AT

48
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,363
THE TIME AND THEN THAT STARTED

49
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:29,597
THE WHOLE PROCESS.

50
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:32,300
WE JUST FELT CALLED BY THE HOLY

51
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,102
SPIRIT TO FOLLOW THAT PATH AND

52
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:36,037
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE AND WE HAVE

53
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:36,971
KATHERINE.

54
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,807
ABBY: BRUCE THE MINUTE YOU

55
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,341
LOOKED INTO KAT'S EYES WHAT WENT

56
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:42,043
THROUGH YOUR MIND?

57
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:45,280
>>  THIS IS MY DAUGHTER AND I

58
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,216
KNOW THAT SOUNDS STRANGE OR

59
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,251
ALMOST COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT

60
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,054
CLEARLY, AS LISA SAID, YOU KNOW,

61
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,223
WE FELT CALLED TO THIS MOMENT

62
00:01:55,223 --> 00:01:57,659
AND WE FELT CALLED TO KAT AND KA

63
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,094
T SPECIFICALLY AND SO IT WAS

64
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,262
AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT.

65
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:03,131
SAME AS IF MEETING ANY ONE OF

66
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,099
THE BIRTH OF ANY OF OUR OTHER

67
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:06,167
FOUR CHILDREN.

68
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,769
ABBY: I HAVE TWO ADOPTED SISTERS

69
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,571
, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE

70
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,705
EXPERIENCE FOR ANYONE WHOSE BEEN

71
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:12,407
THROUGH THAT LISA JUST TO REMIND

72
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:14,042
OUR AUDIENCE THOUGH IT WAS

73
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,677
KATHERINE'S MOM WHO GAVE BIRTH

74
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,512
AND FOUND OUT THAT KAT HAD AN

75
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,047
OPIOID DEPENDENCY AND DECIDED TO

76
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,615
GIVE HER UP FOR ADOPTION HOW IS

77
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,050
SHE DOING NOW.

78
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,251
SHE'S FOUR YEARS OLD.

79
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,186
>>  SHE'S JUST A TYPICAL FOUR

80
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,254
YEAR OLD.

81
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:29,190
EVEN FROM THE TIME WE GOT HER

82
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,059
SHE WAS WEENED IN THE HOSPITAL

83
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,794
SO MEDICALLY, I THINK ALL THE

84
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:33,595
MEDICAL PROBLEMS AS FAR AS THE

85
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:36,831
DOCTORS TOLD US WERE FINE AND

86
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:38,433
YOU WOULD FROM THE DAY WE GOT

87
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:41,169
HER, THERE WAS NOTHING DIFFERENT

88
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,470
ABBY: SHE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL

89
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,238
GIRL.

90
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,073
BRUCE, WALK US THROUGH THAT

91
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,441
MOMENT YOU TOOK HER UP ON STAGE

92
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,077
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER

93
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,078
THIS WEEK.

94
00:02:50,078 --> 00:02:51,446
HE HAS NOW MADE KATHERINE FAMOUS

95
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:52,814
, WALK US THROUGH THAT

96
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,048
MOMENT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR

97
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,183
MIND AND WHAT DO YOU THINK

98
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,618
KATHERINE WAS THINKING IN THAT

99
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:57,252
MOMENT?

100
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:59,420
>>  WELL, THE FIRST THING WAS IS

101
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,089
WE WERE CERTAINLY NOT EXPECTING

102
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:02,457
TO GO UP THERE.

103
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:05,059
WE WERE AWARE THAT AS PART OF

104
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,228
THE LARGER GALA THAT THERE WOULD

105
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,364
BE SOME RECOGNITION OF ADOPTION,

106
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:12,267
THE ADOPTION OPTION, SO WE'RE

107
00:03:12,267 --> 00:03:15,003
JUST FOCUSED ON THAT AND THEN OF

108
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:15,904
COURSE THE PRESIDENT SAID COME

109
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,439
ON UP KATHERINE AND AT THAT

110
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,042
POINT IN TIME, IT WAS ALMOST

111
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,878
SURREAL FROM THAT POINT, YOU

112
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,813
KNOW, FORWARD, AND WE MADE OUR

113
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,982
WAY TO THE STAGE, KATHERINE AND

114
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:30,285
I AND THEN ONE OF OUR OTHER

115
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:33,054
DAUGHTERS, TAYLOR WE ALSO MADE

116
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:33,755
IT UP THERE.

117
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,857
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON

118
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:37,258
IN KATHERINE'S MIND AT THAT TIME

119
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,261
BUT I WILL TELL YOU SHE'S AWARE

120
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,131
WHO THE PRESIDENT IS, SO AT

121
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:45,133
LEAST FROM THAT ASPECT I THINK

122
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,070
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS AT LEAST

123
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,071
ENTERTAINING SHE WAS THINKING.

124
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,073
ABBY: BRUCE WHAT WAS HE SAYING

125
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,541
TO YOU IN THAT MOMENT?

126
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,643
>>  I HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, SORT OF

127
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:57,278
CAVEAT IT OR FRAME IT BY SAYING

128
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,814
THE PRESIDENT WAS INCREDIBLY

129
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,182
GRACIOUS.

130
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:04,519
AS WE GOT UP TO THE STAGE, HE

131
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,055
THANKED KATHERINE FOR COMING UP,

132
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:09,257
ASKED HER HOW SHE WAS DOING.

133
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:11,159
HE MENTIONED HE WAS HAPPY THAT

134
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,226
SHE WAS THERE.

135
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,362
HIM AND I, WE HAD A BRIEF

136
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:15,797
EXCHANGE AS WELL.

137
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,832
HE THANKED ME FOR ALSO COMING UP

138
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:21,135
, BUT ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED OUR

AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT MOST OF

141
00:04:28,242 --> 00:04:29,510
HIS ATTENTION, AND I CERTAINLY

142
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,245
CAN RECOGNIZE THAT AS A FIVE-

143
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,314
TIME FATHER WAS QUITE

144
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,482
FRANKLY GENUINELY GIVEN TOWARDS

145
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,083
