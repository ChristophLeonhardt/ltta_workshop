1
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,402
ARE PEOPLE READY WHERE YOU?

2
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,572
>> THEY WERE READY BUT THEY

3
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,140
TOOK A RELAXED APPROACH TO THE

4
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:09,440
STORM.

5
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,575
EVEN WHAT WE HEARD FROM

6
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:11,509
EMERGENCY SERVICES.

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,678
A LOT OF OPTIMISM THE WORST OF

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,346
THE STORM WILL HIT FURTHER EAST

9
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:15,846
ON THE PANHANDLE.

10
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,050
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

11
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:20,718
AT THE CHICO MARINA WHO DECIDED

12
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,587
TO RIDE OUT THE STORM IN BOATS.

13
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,988
THEY'LL STAY ON THE BOATS AND

14
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,156
THEY LIVE IN THEIR BOATS.

15
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:27,024
THEY ARE JUST UNDER THE

16
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:28,426
IMPRESSION THAT THEY WOULD

17
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,627
RATHER BE THERE, MAINTAIN THE

18
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:30,995
PROBLEMS AS THE STORM WAS

19
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,897
ROLLING IN THAN COME AND DEAL

20
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:33,831
WITH THEM LATER PARTICULARLY

21
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,266
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE.

22
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:37,335
THERE IS A SCIENCE TO

23
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:38,536
MAINTAINING THE LINES WITH THE

24
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:39,704
BOATS OR MORE OF AN ART.

25
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:41,339
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS

26
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,974
ENOUGH SLACK IN THE LINES SO AS

27
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:44,408
THE WATER COMES UP YOU DON'T

28
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,810
PULL THE BOAT AWAY FROM THE

29
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:46,978
DOCK ITSELF BUT YOU WANT TO

30
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,913
HAVE THE LINES TIGHT ENOUGH

31
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,081
THAT YOU DON'T THRASH AROUND

32
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:51,248
AND BANG INTO THE OTHER BOATS

33
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,650

34
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:53,851

37
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:57,121
PEOPLE THINK THAT AGAIN THE

38
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:58,589
WORST OF THE STORM IS GOING TO

39
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,858
BE FURTHER TO THE EAST.

40
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:01,559
THEY'RE FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC.

41
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,461
PEOPLE DID WAKE UP TO THE NEWS

42
00:01:03,462 --> 00:01:04,929

PREDICTIONS NOW UP TO 13 FEET.

68
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,705

THE WATER SHOULD BE PRETTY LOW.

74
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,349
THE EDGE OF THIS BOAT SHOULD BE

75
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,650
PARALLEL WITH THE DOCK.

76
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:04,588

FLOATING DOCKS, IT OTHER FIXED.
