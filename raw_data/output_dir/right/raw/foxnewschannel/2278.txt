1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,473
BRITAIN WANT THE DEAL TO STAND

2
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:06,675
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF

3
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:09,812
BACKING OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR

4
00:00:09,812 --> 00:00:10,546
DEAL?

5
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:11,513
CONOR POWELL LIVE IN JERUSALEM.

6
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:14,950
WHAT ELSE ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT

7
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,791
THE FILES, CONOR?

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,995
>> IT'S NO SECRET THAT BENJAMIN

9
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:30,733
NETANYAHU IS A STAUNCH BACKER OF

10
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:37,439
THE IRAN DEAL BEING SCRAPPED.

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,807
HE SAYS THESE DOCUMENTS DATE

12
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:41,977
FROM THE 1990s AND EARLY 2000s.

13
00:00:41,977 --> 00:00:43,612
AT A TIME WHEN IRAN WAS DENYING

14
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,247
THEIR NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AND

15
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:46,648
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

16
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:48,817
A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION WAS

17
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:52,021
MADE PUBLIC IN THE 2011 NATIONAL

18
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,255
INTELLIGENCEST MITT WHICH

19
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:56,425
CATALOGED ALSO IRAN'S NUCLEAR

20
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:57,092
PROGRAM.

21
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,028
NETANYAHU IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT

22
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:01,930
TONIGHT THIS IS PROOF THAT IRAN

23
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,332
HAD LIED ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM IN

24
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:05,034
THE PAST AND CAN'T BE TRUSTED

25
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:08,804
GOING FORWARD AND RENDERING THE

26
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,441
CURRENT AGREEMENT NULL AND VOID.

27
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,309
NETANYAHU DID NOT ACTUALLY SAY

28
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,011
THAT IRAN HAS RECONSTITUTED

29
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:17,146
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

30
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:18,514
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE JUST A

31
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:20,849
FEW DAYS AGO ON CAPITOL HILL,

32
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,619
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MATTIS SAID

33
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,187
THAT IRAN IS STILL IN COMPLIANCE

34
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,289
WITH THE AGREEMENT, THIS IS

35
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,491
WHERE THE SORT OF RUB COMES IN

36
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,526
THIS ENTIRE DISAGREEMENT ABOUT

37
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:32,061
THE AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD.

38
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:36,799
MATTIS AND OTHERS SAY IRAN IS

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,166
COMPLYING.

40
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,967
NETANYAHU AND THOSE THAT ARE

41
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:39,835
CRITICS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP

42
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:42,171
SAID THAT IRAN CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

43
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,906
THEY'VE LIED IN THE PAST AND LIE

44
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:44,873
IN THE FUTURE.

45
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,076
>> Shepard: AND THE ISRAELIS

46
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:48,877
AREN'T A PART OF THE DEAL.

47
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,813
THIS COMES AS THE TENSIONS ARE

48
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:52,181
GETTING HIGH.

49
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,350
ISRAEL, SYRIA, IRAN AND REALLY A

50
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,919
DIFFICULT MIX AT THE MOMENT.

51
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,253
>> YEAH, THIS IS IMPORTANT

52
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,589
BECAUSE WHILE THERE'S THIS HUGE

53
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:05,694
INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT THE

54
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:06,728
IRANIAN AGREEMENT, ON THE GROUND

55
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,597
THERE'S ESCALATING TENSIONS WITH

56
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:12,334
THE ISRAELIS AND IRANIANS.

57
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,236
IRAN LAST BEEN A HUGE SUPPORTER

58
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,504
OF SYRIA.

59
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:18,307
THE ISRAELIS IN THE PAST HAVE

60
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:19,875
LAUNCHED AIR STRIKES ABOUT THE

61
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,711
TRANSFER OF WEAPONS TO MILITANT

62
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,045
GROUPS.

63
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,414
IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS,

64
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:26,782
INCLUDING LAST NIGHT, TWO DAYS

65
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,551
AGO, THE ISRAELIS HAVE LAUNCHED

66
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,154
AIR STRIKES TARGETING IRANIAN

67
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,655
FOOT HELD AND PRESENCE IN SYRIA.

68
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:35,724
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.

69
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:37,860
THIS IS A CONVENTIONAL WAR THAT

70
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,329
WE COULD BE SEEING BREWING

71
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:40,996
BEFORE OUR EYES.

72
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:45,067
THE IRANIANS HAVE THREATENED THE

73
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:45,434
ISRAELIS.

74
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,136
THE ISRAELIS HAVE SAID THEY

75
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:49,471
WON'T TOLERATE AN IRANIAN

76
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,672
PRESENCE ON THE BORDER.

77
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,475
WE MAY GET TO A REAL HOT WAR ON

78
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:56,211
THE GROUND IN SYRIA BETWEEN

79
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,680
ISRAEL AND IRAN BEFORE WE HAVE A

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:00:00,000
DECISION AROUND WHETHER OR NOT
