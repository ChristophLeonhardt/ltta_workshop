00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
one of my all-time favorite quotes is

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,360
actually about the internet and it is

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,100
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> its absolute communication</font>

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,470
absolute isolation and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,330
about it it makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense we live</font>

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,860
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a world now where we have this tool</font>

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,960
that allows people all across the world

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,549
who are geographically isolated to

9
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:16,680
communicate but the same time if we

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,600
don't translate these communications

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
into real life event then it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,949
worthless because all we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing our</font>

13
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,900
entire lives is sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room</font>

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,990
chatting to a screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in the</font>

15
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,580
past year I've received a lot of

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,399
concerns from people in all walks of

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,110
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have become friends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

18
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,260
saying why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you ignoring me miles why</font>

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,329
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you been in touch lately and do</font>

20
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,710
you hate me about done something wrong

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,980
or you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been such a dick and it's</font>

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">really hard because I've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to step</font>

23
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,270
back and think have I done something

24
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,460
wrong you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I've been</font>

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,289
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my friends but when looking</font>

26
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,390
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full picture I realize it's due</font>

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,190
to the cyber society that we in fact

28
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">live in before the internet was so</font>

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,960
easily accessible we would embrace any

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,420
opportunity we had to socialize<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now</font>

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,380
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter with facebook with YouTube</font>

32
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,640
you know with everything our fingertips

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,070
whether we have an iphone or leave our

34
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,320
instant messenger applets online it

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,479
makes communication so the media and

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,700
abundant and therefore compared to when

37
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,250
we used to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> any person who tried</font>

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,439
to contact us we are now left with this

39
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,070
choice of do we reply or do we ignore

40
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,950
and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're intentionally</font>

41
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,369
trying to be disrespectful but if i was

42
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,229
to respond to every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single man i got if</font>

43
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,939
i was to respond to every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single instant</font>

44
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,310
message or text message<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it was</font>

45
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,170
just me saying i can't talk right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

46
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,460
wouldn't have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

47
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,229
anyway because my life would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

48
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,750
responding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are two types</font>

49
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people in life there are those that</font>

50
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,840
know a few people but knowing very well

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,189
and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

52
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,259
hubs and people that know vast

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,479
quantities but don't know them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,549
great well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the internet</font>

55
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,140
it's all come together now into one

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,630
massive thing in which we know vast

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,759
numbers of people but free quick

58
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,619
information exchange we actually know

59
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,610
what time they got up in the morning

60
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">over their status updates what they had</font>

61
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,390
for breakfast and what they plan to do

62
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,490
with their day I guess my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

63
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,350
where do we draw the line do you believe

64
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an issue that general internet</font>

65
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,670
users would truly understand and do you

66
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,830
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> society will ever eradicate such</font>

67
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,230
problems or evolve into a culture where

68
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,000
we are forced to prioritize who is worth

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:00:00,000
our time and who is not
