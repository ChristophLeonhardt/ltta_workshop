1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,862
The companies that beam,
or stream, your favorite

2
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:04,390
shows onto your screens,

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,202
and how much they can get 
away with charging you,

4
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,870
attract a lot of scrutiny
when they start

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,770
racking up acquisitions and 
cornering the marketplace.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,780
What keeps them in
check are antitrust laws.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,720
“Unreasonable curbs
on competition

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,540
are, in theory, at least, criminal.”

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,190
Too much control or market
share can happen in two ways.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,340
The first is horizontal integration.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,190
If one studio gains
monopoly power

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,740
by buying up lots 
of other studios,

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,960
and the resulting company squeezes 
out the competition across an industry,

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,970
or jacks up prices
for consumers,

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,660
it could be violating
antitrust laws.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,560
The second way is vertical 
integration of the supply chain.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,630
In the late 1940s, the
government actually went in

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,570
and busted up the
Hollywood studio system

19
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,480
because a few behemoths 
owned almost all the studios,

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
and the theaters,

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,000
and they controlled the distribution 
rights to almost all the films.

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,960
"Hello, Mr. Aylesworth. How are you?"

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,070
That made it extremely difficult
for other companies

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,330
in the business of making,

25
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,030
or selling,

26
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,110
or showing movies.

27
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,620
If we look at today’s 
digital landscape,

28
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,620
that would be like if an 
internet provider

29
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,970
also owns the studios 
that make the shows

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,820
and the channels, premium 
networks or streaming platforms.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
And in some cases,

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,650
maybe even the device 
you watch on.

33
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,870
Kind of like, say, 
Apple or Amazon.

34
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,120
The government usually leaves
these kinds of companies alone

35
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,234
if the growth happens
organically, through ingenuity.

36
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,400
But when a company grows
through mergers and acquisitions,

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,256
that can raise a red flag.

38
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:27,780
Historically there have
been fewer challenges

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,696
to vertical integration up and 
down the supply chain,

40
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,730
than across industries.

41
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,640
But when AT&amp;T decided it wanted
to merge with Time Warner,

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,550
the Department of Justice
decided to challenge the move.

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,170
"Your pricing is going to go up.

44
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,029
I don’t think it’s a good
deal for the country."

45
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,030
The companies say they 
need to make this deal

46
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,500
to compete with the Amazons
and Apples of the world.

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,450
The question is whether
one huge company

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,310
plus another huge company

49
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,990
would turn into one new enormous 
telecom and media company

50
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,600
controlling so much content,

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,220
and the way it’s
delivered to you

52
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,130
that it could charge
consumers more

53
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,550
and squeeze out other producers 
suppliers or distributors

54
00:02:00,550 --> 00:00:00,000
who want to make you laugh, 
cry and binge-watch.
