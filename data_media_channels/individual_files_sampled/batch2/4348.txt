today a new lawsuit hitting Donald Trump the accusation defamation in the stormy Daniels case Daniels lawyer arguing that Trump crossed the line when he accused her of lying about being threatened back in 2011 the lawsuit specifically cites Trump's tweet about this forensic sketch of the man who Danielle's alleges intimidated her in the tweet Trump called the claim a total con job the lawsuit saying quote mr. Trump used his national and international audience to make a false factual statement to denigrate and attack Danielle's today Danielle's lawyer Michael avenatti saying this on MSNBC the bottom line here is is that if the president continues to make up statements and and distribute them about my client and if he continues to lie about my client there's gonna be consequences for that period all right so this new lawsuit is actually separate from Daniels's existing battle with Trump and his lawyer Michael Cohen over that hundred thirty thousand dollar payment to keep her quiet joining me now Daniel Goldman former assistant US attorney Brian Weiss a criminal defense attorney Shelby Holiday reporter for The Wall Street Journal great to have all three of you with us here on set Daniel let me begin with you and talk about Michael avenatti strategy here what is the strategy and is this worth is this a fight worth picking now with the president when you have all of these other legal fronts that you've opened up well I think Michael avenatti strategy is all-out warfare that he is pressing every single button he can he's trying to hold the president accountable for whatever it is that the president is doing the interesting thing about this is it's just another example of the president's tweets and his statements coming back to bite him in court it happened last week after the Fox and Friends interview it's now another example of somebody in this case stormy Daniels going to court based on the president's tweets and I mean there's a lot in politics and the politics it doesn't necessarily come back and bite it because there's not necessarily that immediate sense of accountability but do you think that these tweets in a legal courtroom could hold up to the threshold of defamation I think this is a very hard case for stormy day it's not a clear-cut statement that she is a liar like you actually having an ongoing another lawsuit the summers servos the apprentice woman who has already gotten past a motion to dismiss and that's going into discovery that's a much more clear-cut case of a a statement that someone is a liar so I think that from a legal vantage point this is a tough case and I think what avenatti is trying to do is just keep the pressure on even if it's not a fantastic claim that he has I see you shaking your head and that leads me to this question about that point I get a sense that avenatti just wants to be in the room with President Trump at some point he's like all he wants to do is get in into the room to be able to deposed him maybe on this is one way of doing it but take a listen to what he said to my colleague Nicole Wallace earlier today is this another effort to depose the President and get him under oath well certainly there's going to be discovering the case they're gonna be able to take my clients deposition and I'm gonna be able to take mr. Trump's deposition sooner rather than later hopefully relating to this tweet and what's his basis of knowledge so as a criminal defense attorney what do you think does he have a chance in this case to get president Trump into a room for a deposition a man I think he totally does and this is the guy Michael avenatti who can't stop won't stop and every time there's another story every time another shoe drops every time there's more oxygen to keep this story alive every time I see Michael avenatti on the air compared and contrasted with Team Trump it's reminiscent of Cuba in the dream team in the 92 Olympics this guy is crushing them in the court of public opinion and and I agree with that it's a tough case to make but so what I don't think ultimately he really cares whether he wins or loses as long as he gets to depose the president well I would add one thing though and I agree that he's definitely full court press keeping the pressure on and he's all over television whereas the president's team obviously is not talking about this except for a tweet and a comment on Air Force One but I don't know if he wants his client deposed because she has according to my colleagues at the journal and the reporting they've done she has some shifting statements about this threat why she took the money we know she was trying to sell her story before the threat yet she said she didn't want to report the threat because she didn't want her house and to know there are a lot there's a lot of confusion surrounding how she tells the side of the story and I'm not saying the threat didn't exist but some of the statements she's made sure hunting it seemed not to add up so it would be important to get a timeline and get more information about when the threat occurred and you know if his team can find the person who made the threat but he put out this email address in a reward we haven't heard anything about it yet let's focus in on Michael Cohen for a Lobo because I want to read this next area but the National Inquirer stormy Daniels is obviously just a part of the mounting pressure that is facing Michael Cohen it's also coming from a magazine that has long backed president Trump the National Enquirer the tabloid slamming Cohen with this new headline Trump fixers secrets and lies now The Inquirer article placing the legal burden squarely on Cohen rather than Trump quote some are questioning Cohen's role alleging blackmail threats hush-money payoffs and even collusion with Russia Swamiji Daniels's lawyer Michael avenatti drawing a connection between the new Inquirer article and Trump's strategy I think it's clear to at least to me who's behind this ultimately I think it's the White House and mr. Trump they've planted this story in an effort to undermine Michael Cohen's credibility because I think the dawn has has set in or the light has set in and they've realized that something I've been saying for a long time Michael Cohen is going to flip on the president he's gonna tell prosecutors everything that he knows about mr. Trump and mr. Trump's dealings and he's gonna have to in an effort to save himself so Daniel do you think that in fact the Trump team is preparing Michael Cohen for flipping I think that's that's the obvious implication here if if the relationship between Trump and Cohen you know as Trump's consigliere so to speak he's so close with the National Enquirer for them to come out so strongly against Michael Cohen and accusing him of lying as well is part of a more recent tack that the president took beginning with Fox and Friends or at least including Fox and Friends last week where they're truck starting to undermine Michael Cohen's credibility with the idea being that if and when he does flip they're gonna say that he just made every thing up in order to get a deal with the government to save himself from whatever misconduct that he did that is separate and apart from the president's team it's a dangerous strategy though because you know Michael Cohen was next to the president for many many years and presumably as his fixer as the guy he would go to to correct issues that he has has a lot of information about where the bodies are buried let me ask you about this other report this was coming out from ABC News and it reports that the Trump campaign to be exact paid off some of Cohen's legal fees this is between October of 2017 and 2018 so given the amount of legal pressure that Cohen is now facing is he going to be able to sustain legal challenges on his own without any kind of financial help I mean the two messages coming out here what we're seeing from the National Enquirer is we just heard and at the same time the fact that the Trump organization wants to make sure Cohen survives this in some capacity legally well I think anybody that's watched this show recognizes what we all learn the first day of law school any criminal defendant can beat the rap but they can't beat the ride and in a situation like this Michael Cohen has already discovered he's going to be taken for heckuva riding in terms of the money in terms of the shame in terms of the general trauma but what quick take one take away a man about the National Enquirer when I was a kid back before y'all's parents met the National Enquirer had a habit of talking about two-headed babies UFOs in Bruce Willis's marital troubles wait wait no that was this way and ultimately they're gonna try to paint Michael Kohn as a latter-day Henry Hill yeah is a rat who's a liar but this man is no typical jailhouse informant he's not a guy who's trying to turn his dealer this is a man who up until a couple of months ago before he went from sanh young to sayonara had the presidents there and the president's confidence good luck with that strategy I'm gonna give you the final word about the National Enquirer article what do you make of it is it significant should I mean obviously the fact that we're talking about the National Enquirer is a little bit self-acting but the fact that it is so close to President Trump he's defended it in the past what do you make of the reason it's important is not just because it's close to Trump it's close to Michael Cohen Michael Cohen used to be the sort of manager between President Trump and David he was a central figure in planting some stories for the president and now that he is the tables have turned and he's on the cover that looks like and I'll let Shane covered there was also another headline about President Trump not and being involved in collusion with Russia so both sides of the code hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
