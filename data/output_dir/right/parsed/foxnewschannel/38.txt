EAR.
STEVE: THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
JILLIAN, WITH 13 DAYS FOR THE
MIDTERMS, IT'S A TIGHT RACE FOR
THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR RACE, NEW
POLL FROM QUINNIPIAC PROGRESS
SIEVE MAYOR ANDREW GILLEM AHEAD
OF RON DESANTIS.
AT THIS POINT SIX POINTS.
AINSLEY: JOINING US ON A BUSY
CAMPAIGN MORNING, RON DESANTIS.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.
>> GOOD MORN.
AINSLEY: WHAT DO YOU SAY WITH
THOSE VOTERS BECAUSE YOU'RE DOWN
A LITTLE BIT IN THE POLLS?
>> WELL LOOK, WE HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT FLORIDA'S
ECONOMIC MOMENTUM.
I WILL DO THAT AND REALLY TAKE
IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.
ANDREW IS RUNNING ON MASSIVE TAX
INCREASES WHICH WOULD COST JOBS.
CAUSE BUSINESSES TO LEAVE
FLORIDA.
IT WOULD STOP THE FLOW OF
INVESTMENT COMING INTO FLORIDA
WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT.
HE IS ALSO SOMEBODY WHO PRESIDES
OVER THE MOST CRIME-RIDDEN CITY
IN FLORIDA, TALLAHASSEE.
THEY HAD A RECORD NUMBER OF
MURDERS LAST YEAR.
HE SIGNED AN ANTI-POLICE
MANIFESTO.
HE WANTS TO ABOLISH I.C.E.
HE WON'T COOPERATE WITH THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
SO FLORIDA WOULD HAVE MORE CRIME
UNDER ANDREW GILLEM.
THAT WOULD BE DISASTEROUS FOR
OUR STATE THAT UNDERCUTS
EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO
ECONOMICALLY WITH THE
ENVIRONMENT, YOU NAME IT.
STEVE: A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS
MAKING FLORIDA THEIR HOME.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CARAVAN
IN MEXICO THAT IS HEADED OUR
WAY?
WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM
MR. GILLUM REGARDING THIS, I
DON'T BELIEVE.
>> OBVIOUSLY A SOVEREIGN COUNTRY
CAN'T JUST HAVE PEOPLE PLOWING
ACROSS ITS BORDER.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT
TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN COUNTENANCE
THAT.
ANDREW HAS OPEN BORDER POLICIES.
HE BASICALLY SAID THAT IS WHAT
HE WANTS, HE WANTS FLORIDA TO BE
A SANCTUARY STATE AND HAVE
SANCTUARY CITIES.
WHEN YOU DO THAT, OBVIOUSLY
FOLKS COME IN, WE DON'T NO HOE
THEY ARE, BUT IT'S A WET KISS
FROM THE DRUG CARTELS THEY MOVE
THE PRODUCT IN FROM CHINA,
FENTANYL DRIVING OPIOID CRISIS.
THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANYWHERE IN
THE COUNTRY.
OBVIOUSLY THAT STUFF FINDS ITS
WAY TO FLORIDA.
BRIAN: ANDREW GILLUM WAS FROM
TALLAHASSEE.
HIS INTELLECT IS STRONG AFTER
THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE.
ONE THING IS CLEAR HE IS UNDER
FBI INVESTIGATION.
WE HAVE SOME DETAILS NOW.
TURNS OUT AN FBI UNDER COVER
AGENT TRIED TO OFFER HIM
"HAMILTON" TICKETS.
HE TOOK IT.
HE DID HAVE A EXPLANATION THAT
HIS BROTHER GAVE IT TO HIM BUT
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE PLAYING
OUT.
>> NO.
IN FACT HE, I ASKED HIM
DIRECTLY, WE HAD A DEBATE SUNDAY
AND HE SAID HE PAYS FOR
EVERYTHING.
HAS NEVER TAKEN ANYTHING.
WELL THEN THE DOCUMENTS THAT
CAME OUT SHOWED JUST THE
OPPOSITE.
THAT YES, THIS UNDERCOVER FBI
AGENT POSING AS A CONTRACTOR
TRYING TO DO BUSINESS WITH HIM
AS MAYOR WITH THE CITY OF
TALLAHASSEE, HE IS THE ONE THAT
GAVE ANDREW THE "HAMILTON"
TICKETS.
ANDREW LIED TO THE FOLKS OF
FLORIDA.
BUT ALSO THE FACT HE IS GETTING,
HE CLAIMS HE IS NOT UNDER
INVESTIGATION.
WHY THE HECK WOULD LAW
ENFORCEMENT SEND AN UNDERCOVER
AGENT TO LINE HIS POCKETS IF HE
WASN'T UNDER INVESTIGATION?
OF COURSE HE IS.
HE HAS VIOLATED FLORIDA LAW BY
ACCEPTING THOSE GIFTS, NOT JUST
THAT, BUT THIS LUXURY VACATION
TO COSTA RICA.
THE DOCUMENTS ALSO SHOW HE
DIDN'T PAY FOR THAT.
LO AND BEHOLD THE LOBBIEST THAT
TOOK HIM ON THAT TRIP TO COAST
CAN REEK CAN, HE TURNED AROUND
AND GAVE THE LOBBIEST $2 MILLION
IN CITY MONEY TO BUILD A
RESTAURANT.
THAT IS LOCAL CORRUPTION LOOKS
LIKE.
BRIAN: CONGRESSMAN, HERE IS THE
MOMENT FROM SUNDAY'S DEBATE.
>> THE QUESTION IS, DID YOU PAY
FOR THE "HAMILTON" TICKET OR DID
THE UNCOVER FBI PAY FOR THE
"HAMILTON" TICKET?
DID YOU PAY TO STAY IN THE VILLA
IN COSTA RICA?
WHERE ARE THE RECEIPTS?
YOU HAVE NOT PROVEN YOU PAID FOR
ANYTHING.
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
>> HERE IS DIRECT ANSWER.
I DON'T TAKE FREE TRIPS IN
ANYBODY.
I'M A HARD-WORKING PERSON.
I KNOW THAT MAY NOT FIT YOUR
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT YOU THINK
PEOPLE LIKE ME DO BUT I WORKED
HARD FOR EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE
GOTTEN AND IN MY LIFE.
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY HANDING ME
ANYTHING FOR FREE.
STEVE: CONGRESSMAN?
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE DOCUMENTS
THAT WERE RELEASED COME DOWN ON
THAT STATEMENT LIKE A TON OF
BRICKS.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, HE
WAS GETTING THINGS FOR FREE AND
NOT JUST THAT.
LOOK, IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE GOT
SOMETHING FOR FREE.
I DON'T LIKE GETTING THINGS FOR
FREE AS A PERSON BUT WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT THIS WAS CONNECTED TO
HIS ROLE AS MAYOR.
THESE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING TO
INFLUENCE HIM, WHO HAD BUSINESS
BEFORE HIM.
SO HE IS PUTTING MONEY IN HIS
POCKET EFFECTIVELY, THEN TURNING
AROUND DOING THE BIDDING OF THE
SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING HIM
THIS STUFF.
THAT IS WRONG.
AINSLEY: IF HE IS, IF HE IS
TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS
HIS BROTHER GAVE HIM THE
"HAMILTON" TICKETS.
STEVE: HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE
BROTHER.
AINSLEY: IS THAT ALLOWED?
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO GET FREE
THINGS FROM THE FAMILY, JUST NOT
FROM SOMEONE ELSE?
>> EXACTLY.
IF THE UNCOVER GAVE THE TICKETS
TO HIS BROTHER TO GIVE TO
ANDREW, THAT WOULD BE NO
DIFFERENCE.
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
THAT IS WHY HE SO EVASIVE.
HE LASHED OUT IN THE DEBATE
BECAUSE HE KNEW HE WAS NOT ON
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FACTS
HERE.
WHAT WE HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING HIM
TO THE FIRE.
THE MEDIA HAS NOT DONE VERY MUCH
ON THIS FINALLY THIS CAME OUT
BECAUSE OF A SUBPOENA REQUEST IN
THE ETHICS INVESTIGATION INTO
ANDREW.
STEVE: TAMPA BAY NEWSPAPER IS
DOING THAT A LOT OF LOCAL
OUTLETS IN FLORIDA TODAY.
NOT EXACTLY WHEN YOU WANT IT TO
DROP TWO WEEKS OUT BEFORE THE
ELECTION.
MR. DESANTIS THE PRESIDENT
TWEETED SUPPORT FOR YOU.
HE ADDED MORE STOPS BEFORE THE
MIDTERMS.
IS HEADING BACK TO THE SUNSHINE
STATE?
>> I THINK SO.
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE
WHITE HOUSE WILL ANNOUNCE AND
TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WILL ANNOUNCE
WHEN THEY WANT TO.
BUT I THINK YOU WILL SEE HIM
HERE THE YOU SAW THAT TEXAS
CROWD.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE SIMILAR
ENTHUSIASM FOR HERE IN THE STATE
OF FLORIDA.
BRIAN: CONGRESSMAN SOME SAY
YOU'RE GOOD AT DEFINING WHAT
GILLUM WILL DO, RAISE TAX, THAT
NATURE, YOU'RE NOT SAYING GOOD
ENOUGH JOB WHAT YOU WOULD DO.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
YOU AND GOVERNOR SCOTT?
>> WE'RE COMING IN AT A
DIFFERENT TIME.
RICK CAME IN WITH ECONOMY IN THE
TANK.
I'M COMING IN WITH THE ECONOMY
GOING.
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
CAPITALIZE OFF THAT, RECRUIT
RECORD INVESTMENT INTO FLORIDA
SO WE EXPAND OUR ECONOMIC BASE,
FINANCE TECHNOLOGY,
MANUFACTURING, THAT IS MORE
HIGH-PAYING JOBS.
ALSO WE HAD PERSISTENT PROBLEMS
WITH OUR WATER RESOURCES.
WE HAVE TO CLEAN THE WATER, MAKE
SURE WE RESTORE THE EVERGLADES
AND STOP TOXIC ALGAE.
I'M IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO DO
THAT.
I STOOD UP AGAINST SOME OF THE
BIGGEST INTERESTS IN FLORIDA TO
DO THE RIGHT THING.
I'M ONLY ONE OF THE TWO OF US
WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE.
THAT IS AN ISSUE ON THE
FOREFRONT OF A LOT OF FLORIDIANS
MINDS.
