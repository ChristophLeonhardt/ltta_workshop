I mean I was mark louder he is a special assistant to was a special assistant to president Trump in the White House and a former press secretary to vice president pence he is now a spokesman for the Trump pence political operation any member of the Trump 2020 advisory board mr. Latta thank you for coming in thank you everybody let me start with this why should we take the president at his word right now I think the president has been consistent when he said that he did not know about that payment and if you look at what Rudy Giuliani told Bob Kosta from The Washington Post he said that at the time when the president did that interview on Air Force One that he was not aware of that payment being remade because broody Giuliani says that he had actually informed him of that just a few days a few days ago week to 10 days ago I think is what he says but what I'm confused he said so Giuliani informed him but then the president today said well no Giuliani doesn't have his facts straight and he said that that leads the impression that Donald Trump does know the facts and then you're now saying oh no Giuliani informed him that's where and I understand why you may be confused because I'm confused and and Rudy has put out a statement clarifying some of that I'm not sure it completely clarifies everything and that's where we're gonna have to get more information but the one thing I think and there's a poll out a few months ago from Quinnipiac that said that so few Americans think less than 1/4 of Americans actually think that this this affair or the coverage of it is actually important so why does the president why is the president cover this up so much if it doesn't matter I'm with you I don't think this is a big political deal why does he go through hoops to not tell us the truth about I think the big thing right now is that they have they have clarified that this was not an FEC violation which I know we know that one thing well I think I talked to one of the top election law lawyers yesterday about this asking him here in Washington DC and he said there's a very specific criteria that while the law says one thing there's more precedent that clearly defines what a cot and the in-kind contribution would be and that this does not meet that that all may be true but Rudy Giuliani is the one that brought up the election timeline and then I would ask this if that is the case why didn't he pay her in 2011 or 2012 or 2013 or 2014 when there was some interaction between mr. Cohen and the lawyer and I'm not sure when or how that to his attention in in 2016 but I can't say regardless of that timeline according to court precedent they are saying that that one of the lawyers I spoke said this does not reach the criteria of being a campaign contribution what what was Rudy Giuliani trying to do was he trying to sort of clean trying to clear out the stormy Daniels distraction and instead it made it worse I mean was that was I I got the impression that that's what he was trying to do and then how he did it it didn't work and I don't know I've seen I've not talked to Rudy about it I just saw enough social media some reporting by Kristen Welker from NBC who suggested that that was his intention was to before the information got leaked out by the Southern District of New York that he wanted to get it all on the table and just get it out there so are we to so so is the president's tweet from yesterday morning correct or not which was which indicated that it was a retainer that he paid and how Michael Cohen used that money he was unclear is that what is it that we should take as fact here when it comes to the president's knowledge about his payments to Michael Cohen and Michael Cohen's payments to stormy day and I do want to be clear this is a matter between the president his personal life but that Twitter feed are we to take that at his word I would take what the president says on Twitter to be to be the word on that but I don't because I'm not involved in those personal discussions between him and his lawyers I wouldn't know the information that's got a larger issue here dan Balz somebody who does not does not write in hyperbolic terms his lead today is this does it bother anyone that President Trump has been caught lying does it bother anyone that this is not new does it bother anyone that the president has been shown to be a liar these are rough words from somebody who isn't somebody that would go down that road and you look at the Washington Post had a study as a May one he has told 3001 false or misleading claims while in office according to their account does this make it harder to say that you can take the president at his word I think what we're talking what we're looking at is that what the American people are seeing is are the results I mean we're talking about things like the economy today we're looking at North Korea those kinds of things and while there are many things that consume our coverage and everything here inside the beltway I think we when you get outside I think so many people are going well I may not always agree with the way things are said or how they're said its the results that matter and there and so far there's intending to like what they're seeing we're seeing a steady increase in the president's approval look this was the president's argument just now he's like oh yeah but he called it crap but here's what the Wall Street Journal editorial page not exactly somebody who is unfriendly to the president Paul Gigot obviously very supportive of some of the president's accomplishments and he writes this via the ad board mr. Trump is compiling a record that increases the likelihood that few will believe him during a genuine crisis say a dispute over speaking with Special Counsel robert muller or a nuclear showdown with kim jong on mr. trump should worry that americans will stop believing anything he says these are basically the crying wolf argument and i think that's something that we definitely have to address as a is an administration and across the board because when we do face that situation and all and all administration's do but i do think that we have an ability in our country to in times of crisis to see past some of the political things that may go on at other times during the year and that when we stand up there and behind that podium or on the world stage confronting those crises that we tend to believe our leaders regardless of political affiliations or our thoughts on them beyond that did the president of germany leave Sarah Sanders out to dry yesterday I don't what are in a position do you feel are you concerned at what you're telling me that eventually he may not be true I don't think so because when you look at and again I'll go back to the Bob Kosta interview from the Washington Post with Rudy he supported that timeline that he had talked about and which was reiterated by the president I think not knowing that the interview was taking place obviously that's a coordination issue and I'm sure that everyone in the White House would would prefer to have more information but what we have to realize is that this is a this is not in the White House's realm this is not the White House counsel's office that is handling this where Sarah can just go down the hall and say give me your information these are the personal attorneys that are working on the out no I understand that but if you were working on that White House would you basically say that don't make me answer a question that I don't have an answer to well unfortunately as you well know we can't control what questions are asked us so we do have to prepare the best we can I think she goes out there trying to give the best information that you do every day as all White House press secretaries do and sometimes that gets contradicted and you have to deal with that but I mean you've had hope Hicks told a congressional committee that she's had to tell white lies and we can define what white lies are Sean Spicer has admitted there's some exaggerations he said while they're in front of that podium the point is this is a pattern that you can't get back you can't you can't get this back I think we have a majority and the the Quinnipiac poll I think with some 60% that believe it he doesn't tell the truth and that's something that I think what we're going to have to work on long term is is making sure that we have that trust and and that results with let's back up the results with the rhetoric and and get everybody thinking on the same page again and hopefully if we can dial down the partisanship a little bit on all sides that we can get back to that long term all right mark louder I'm sure plenty people don't envy the situation you get put into sometimes thanks for coming on deck sharing your views I appreciate it hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more Meet the Press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
