10
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,109

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">heroes now my heroes are individuals who</font>

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,660
have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadened my horizons allow</font>

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,250
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bigger picture in life</font>

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,590
and thus inspired some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the content I</font>

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,050
put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this YouTube channel and Jeremy</font>

28
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind dirty wars my first question is</font>

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,710
in a minute for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that haven't seen</font>

30
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,600
it yet and maybe aren't familiar with

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,180
your work why should people see this I

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,010
mean we're living in a moment here where

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,590
a guy who won<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Nobel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peace Prize and</font>

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,479
is a constitutional lawyer by training

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,090
and campaign for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presidency of the</font>

36
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,009
United States on a pledge to basically

37
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,479
erase everything that Bush and Cheney

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,540
did to screw up the world is presiding

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,040
over what is effectively a global

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,110
assassination program and is trying to

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,939
argue that not only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States</font>

42
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,920
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right to do this but is right in</font>

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
doing it so our film tells the human

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,970
stories of the people who live on the

45
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,530
other side of America's missiles and

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,780
raises very serious questions about the

47
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,310
possibility of this coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back around</font>

48
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,560
as a boomerang to hit us all in Western

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,740
society and this is your first film

50
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,180
probably my only feather oh really<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a filmmaker you</font>

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,899
know it was a it was it was a it was a

53
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,130
strange thing we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off to</font>

54
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,329
make a film we were we were trying to

55
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,880
examine sort of this the idea that there

56
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">were two wars in afghanistan uh you know</font>

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
conventional war that we would see on TV

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,729
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a more covert war and we</font>

59
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:06,659
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even sure it was going to become</font>

60
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">a films</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right i'm not a filmmaker</font>

61
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,750
maybe I'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else and film</font>

62
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,670
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways always like planting</font>

63
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,840
the seeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you learn</font>

64
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,250
yeah you might do it again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

65
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,440
going to ask how you found it differed

66
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,420
because as a viewer seeing the film<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

67
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,060
followed your work and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm</font>

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,340
quite well read on the subject but the

69
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
movie just hits you in ways that books

70
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,720
and interviews don't because you're

71
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,750
hearing the voices from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

72
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're actually effects and and maybe</font>

73
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,799
in a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogger the thing I really</font>

74
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,239
campaign against is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that i</font>

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,180
believe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is a vehicle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

76
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,830
massaging global empathy is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

77
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,299
that when you go toward another country

78
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:44,069
it's now not with some stranger's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

79
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,560
friends or families and during the

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,780
recent uprising in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey I was speaking</font>

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,579
to people on Twitter and it's it's

82
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">really that next extra edge so I</font>

83
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,260
wondered<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would maybe be a reason</font>

84
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,090
for my mag filming I completely agree at

85
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,160
you I mean that that's part of if you I

86
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,629
would invite you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some day you can come</font>

87
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,120
and sit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my couch in in New York and</font>

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,549
we'll watch cable television in the US

89
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,049
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some good food will sit there</font>

90
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,060
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch it for the entire day</font>

91
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,209
and you will get a sense of how idiotic

92
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,069
our media culture is in in the United

93
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,160
States<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all about crime you</font>

94
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,920
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who killed who sex scandals you</font>

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,109
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miley Cyrus twerking yes what real</font>

96
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,000
housewives are drinking and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,470
shit is with the adverts in between

98
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,209
right oh yeah I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the</font>

99
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:28,650
adverts are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> entertaining that the</font>

100
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,540
actual provide informative right but

101
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,160
when it comes to cover in the war it's

102
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,359
there you never see the face of any of

103
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,680
the people who live on the other side of

104
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,329
the missiles and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why we made</font>

105
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,519
this film was to humanize people that

106
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,829
were told are the enemy yeah sometimes

107
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,150
actual terrorists are killed in these

108
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,160
attacks but tremendous<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers of</font>

109
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,389
civilians have been killed who are those

110
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,370
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when we have you know we</font>

111
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,900
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge problem in America of</font>

112
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,370
school shootings you know that we're a

113
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,190
gun addicted society and these you know

114
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">children get gunned down by these</font>

115
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
lunatics who go in and fire it up when

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,430
the when those stories are covered in

117
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the media we know the names of every kid</font>

118
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,049
that was killed and we empathize with

119
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:09,000
their families because we see them as

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,950
our own why shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that before</font>

121
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,319
we go to war in Iraq or Afghanistan or

122
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,849
Yemen or Somalia don't we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

123
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,289
moral responsibility to say wait a

124
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute real people are going to die</font>

125
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,228
including<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that have nothing to do</font>

126
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">with terrorism cash shouldn't we know</font>

127
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,320
their stories are some of their stories

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,440
before we decide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go and blow them up</font>

129
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,510
so lately I realized that movie was

130
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,340
quite stylized so there were some

131
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,170
aspects I don't if that was the right

132
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,180
word to use um it definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a bad</font>

133
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,800
thing to didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it in a bad way but</font>

134
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,740
um even if you did man I know but I go

135
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,860
crying give the vascular here so many

136
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,390
critical life you want I'll give you my

137
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,400
critique of them out there um but

138
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">between certain scenes like when you</font>

139
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">went to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different location it would be</font>

140
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,840
the black and white the the photography

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,110
shots which which I liked when dealing

142
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,820
with a movie like this where it's such a

143
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,460
sensitive issue but it's also about

144
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,100
reaching outs people that do need it

145
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,920
died in a digestible format was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

146
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,200
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> process unlike was that one of</font>

147
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,610
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengthy process I don't even</font>

148
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,910
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in this film I mean as myself</font>

149
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,500
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fought against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in fact</font>

150
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,970
that i'll give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little inside</font>

151
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,680
information there are some scenes where

152
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm sitting in a car and we're going</font>

153
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,280
from one place to another and there's

154
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,190
some tension and and there is tension

155
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,840
but what you didn't see in it is me

156
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,030
yelling<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Rick the director of the film</font>

157
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,500
afterwards get the fucking camera out of

158
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,480
my face because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> hated it I felt like I</font>

159
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,190
was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of a weird war version</font>

160
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,169
of The Truman Show Jim Carrey movie

161
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like your whole life is film for</font>

162
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,060
years um but not I mean we we wanted to

163
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a film that felt familiar to people</font>

164
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,310
in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the genre as a way of</font>

165
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,300
communicating the message effectively

166
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,850
and you know I think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm from a</font>

167
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,620
working class family in the Midwest of

168
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,300
the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was thinking of like</font>

169
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,390
what will my you know relatives who are

170
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,980
not necessarily paying attention is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

171
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,240
what kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie would they want to</font>

172
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and see where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could actually</font>

173
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,830
sneak in some real information and so

174
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,919
part of why we stylized it in the way

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did is is that we wanted to</font>

176
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
create a film that people would actually

177
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,970
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch yeah and not feel like</font>

178
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're you know in doing schoolwork</font>

179
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,660
then I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> or doing the knowledge yeah</font>

180
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,640
yeah yeah yeah when it comes to sort of

181
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,160
poles and especially on the US media I

182
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,470
never sure where you even make a

183
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,780
compromise with all of them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

184
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with this that</font>

185
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,830
about sixty percent of americans support

186
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,720
the drone program that that's the number

187
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,070
of these yes it runs out more than that

188
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,780
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sometimes a little bit less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

189
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,700
mean it but yeah let's say let's say

190
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,740
that it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than half yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

191
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,590
it's fair to say

192
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,000
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what i think is at play</font>

193
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,820
there is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> president obama is</font>

194
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,130
running the drone wars a lot of liberals

195
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,050
have sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of checked their consciences</font>

196
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,330
at the at the coat check of his

197
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,160
presidency and they're gonna have a

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,690
tough time finding them the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

199
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,520
Republican is in office so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I</font>

200
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,930
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way I think you would see a</font>

201
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,630
lot lower numbers of support in the

202
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,850
polls if a Republican was president you

203
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,550
know in fact most liberal

204
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,930
self-identified Liberal Democrats

205
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,850
support the drone program yeah it's it

206
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,620
there's a rising tide of voices from the

207
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,020
libertarian movement the Tea Party from

208
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,490
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right flank of American</font>

209
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,020
politics opposing these policies

210
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,580
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> because Obama's the president</font>

211
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,160
so it's very polarized it's scary when

212
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,620
you look at actually the polarization of

213
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,810
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> left wing anymore not because it</font>

214
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,060
is it is face I mean the Liberal

215
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Democrats oh not labor or conservatives</font>

216
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,250
the leader Nick Clegg you know is with

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conservatives at the moment he was</font>

222
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,120
the myths of these labels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

223
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,590
that actually you should judge on

224
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,960
individual actions and individual policy

225
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,610
look I mean yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I followed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,350
we have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to browse</font>

312
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,660
anonymously it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about protecting our</font>

313
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,070
sources to as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is about</font>

314
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,350
protecting our own data so in the movie

315
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,910
that those clips of when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on</font>

316
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,860
the mainstream media and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the</font>

317
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,930
reaction you get and I've

318
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,399
the interviews in which you've pretty

319
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,589
much given them truth when I play and

320
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,720
then they've most of the time pushed it

321
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,700
away but obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a real</font>

322
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,490
information war going on I feel a part

323
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,560
of that information war is using

324
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,570
language as a weapon so I didn't know if

325
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,890
you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that and I know</font>

326
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,180
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the movie to you touch about a</font>

327
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,220
signature strikes and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe could</font>

328
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,360
explain what that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font>

329
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,700
clearly not what right there<font color="#CCCCCC"> again there</font>

330
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,950
are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> or first of all and the issue of</font>

331
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media I'm always surprised when I</font>

332
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,130
get invited back on those shows I mean

333
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,810
you know I went on we have this network

334
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,300
MSNBC in the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

335
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,130
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like state media for the White</font>

336
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,520
House and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I blast them on their</font>

337
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,980
own airwaves an attack famous hosts of

338

their shows on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> home pro cause of</font>

339
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,130
them at once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was it look like the</font>

340
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,529
Brady was like I was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle and</font>

341
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,740
it was a strange sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing but yeah</font>

342
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,370
I know but I on the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of language</font>

343
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,589
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean Orwell's 1984 was a</font>

344
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,660
fantastic sort of illustration of the

345
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,029
way you know taken to its extreme that

346
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,709
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> brother will sort of teach us that</font>

347
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,330
war is peace and all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

348
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of age of obama</font>

349
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,040
you know they're developing a thing

350
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,230
called the disposition matrix which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

351
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,670
basically like an algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

352
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,350
determining who's gonna live or die in

353

<font color="#E5E5E5">the future from at the hands of american</font>

354
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,760
drone strikes there are two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,959
drone strikes signature strikes and

356
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,970
personality strikes personality strike

357
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,830
would be they know who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

358
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,110
following you around they get you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

359
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,790
open field and boom they kill you and

360
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,810
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that they've</font>

361
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,089
killed is you a signature strike is

362
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:39,800
where they're tracking your metadata and

363
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,630
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out who are you</font>

364
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,370
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone with where is your phone</font>

365
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,980
bin where are you logging on you know to

366
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet who are you in touch with</font>

367
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,510
and are you with other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who fit a</font>

368
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,860
pattern that we think indicates you

369
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,540
might be involved terrorist activity we

370
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily know your identity but</font>

371
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,630
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you fit the pattern of what we</font>

372
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,980
believe terrorists are doing in a

373
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,589
certain area and we decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just</font>

374
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be taken out because you</font>

375
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,310
probably are a terrorist it's it's sort

376
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,360
of like the you know Minority Report

377
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,890
stuff with Tom Cruise where you

378
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,920
basically say it's pre-crime and and

379
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,290
we're preemptively killing people

380
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,270
primarily military-aged males that's

381
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,160
another phrase that the US military aged

382
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,630
male in

383
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,270
to preempt terrorist activities at it is

384
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">utterly gratuitous it's the most</font>

385
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,990
offensive part of the drone program to

386
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,090
me is it you you are intending to kill

387
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,400
specific people whose identities you

388
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,200
don't know and against whom you may have

389
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,610
no evidence that they're involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

390
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,080
terrorism and its language like

391
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,030
Collateral Murder<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss me well</font>

392
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,880
collateral murder uh sighs I'm sorry

393
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,140
vinoba<font color="#E5E5E5"> Claire that's part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

394
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,880
WikiLeaks call the collateral murder is

395
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,410
you know they because it's not

396
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">collateral damage when you're killing</font>

397
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,610
you know civilians the idea that it's we

398
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,340
say casualties and collateral damages

399
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,150
are deeply offensive terms so since the

400
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,100
movie because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been out in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

401
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,710
let's gym since junior um what has been

402
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest lesson what have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

403
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,790
from it may be from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

404
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">people you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i was i was</font>

405
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,800
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> um first of all it was very</font>

406
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,530
positively received in the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

407
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry press in the film world which</font>

408
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,920
was a new world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me i had never been</font>

409
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,200
on any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a red carpet with women</font>

410
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,870
wearing big furs and it was so straight

411
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,210
strange thing um no the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> bizarre</font>

412
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,510
thing that happened was um in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Washington</font>

413
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">DC there were people who work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

414
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,140
CIA that came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screening you know</font>

415
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,710
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opening I didn't invite those I</font>

416
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,230
don't hang out with people from the CIA

417
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,910
they came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me afterwards a group of</font>

418
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,260
CIA analysts who work on the

419
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,180
counterterrorism program and said you

420
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,700
know I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big t the capital</font>

421
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">T truth of what you're saying like we we</font>

422
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,330
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we we think you know we're</font>

423
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to pay a price for it later but we</font>

424
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,220
get bombarded by politicians with all

425
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,590
these requests to take people out you

426
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,990
know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I mean anyway the point is</font>

427
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there was it's i think that there's</font>

428
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,530
more of a dialogue going on behind the

429
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,360
scenes than we are aware of because

430
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,100
people are afraid to talk they're afraid

431
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,480
they're gonna get<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit with espionage act</font>

432
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,520
charges with what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said then I</font>

433
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,070
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it it's hard to sort of put</font>

434
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the finger of blame and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a blame</font>

435
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,940
game of is the issue systemic is it bad

436
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,770
foreign policy or is it individual

437
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,240
people and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always easy to</font>

438
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,150
point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Obama's evil and so I</font>

439
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bombers evil it's a ya know I</font>

440
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,800
get ya ass because the question always

441
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
is when Obama makes these decisions

442
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,360
who's putting the info<font color="#CCCCCC"> on his desk is it</font>

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,430
the military saying we need this amount

444
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,560
of budget extended or else there'll be

445
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,220
another terrorist

446
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,750
do you want to be that president who

447
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,820
says no<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it fine happens that</font>

448
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,980
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only beneficiaries of these</font>

449
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,230
policies of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the so-called war on terror</font>

450
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,750
have been big corporations the you know

451

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Halliburton's of the world Lockheed</font>

waters they're the only people that have

454
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,900
won anything from this you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> win</font>

457
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,840
anything from this but to directly

458
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,540
answer your question the in the US and I

459
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,130
think it's true also in Britain in the

460
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a beast that is the</font>

461
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,930
national security state and that beast

462
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,270
will outlast any political leader it

463
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,070
allowed outlasted Bush and Cheney it

464
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,220
will outlast Obama and that beast is is

465
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,770
alive<font color="#E5E5E5"> because America's political system</font>

466
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,540
is totally bought and paid for by

467
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,090
corporations us a legalized form of

468
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,830
corruption in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is what our</font>

469
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,680
electoral system is and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

470
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,090
reality no one will ever become

471
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,950
president of the United States who is

472
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,020
not purchased by a corporation every

473
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,940
year we break a record for how much it

474
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,770
cost to purchase the White House<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

475
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">xanies also post a bill so there's</font>

476
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,780
unlimited spending oh and now you know

477
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,910
corporations are officially recognized

478
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,590
as people in the United States so

479
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,840
there's a ruling called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Citizens United</font>

480
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,030
so that means that ordinary people who

481
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,800
have maybe a hundred dollars to spend

482
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,330
contributing to a politician because

483
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,820
they believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them they can't stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

484
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,530
against a huge corporation that already

485
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,150
has purchased ninety percent to that

486
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,460
politician so you know it's it's not

487
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not about Bush and</font>

488
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,369
Cheney there is a national<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

489
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">state that largely exists in secret and</font>

490
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,230
serves the interests of major

491
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,750
corporations and you know so how do you

492
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,060
confront that I mean that's we need to

493
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,380
wake up I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't about</font>

494
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,140
just who we elect this is about getting

495
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,060
corporations out of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives yeah out</font>

496
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our political lives I feel that the</font>

497
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,480
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ways we can help is with</font>

498
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,859
stuff like this because the thing that's

499
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,510
priceless i found is truth because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

500
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,970
can have a multi-billion pound news

501
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,550
organization but it takes one<font color="#E5E5E5"> sis and</font>

502
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">journalist or the camera to record the</font>

503
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,030
truth and to go online and it can

504
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,460
completely overwrite it for the most

505
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,990
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just that since</font>

506
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,700
this morning i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was reading at before i</font>

507
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
came to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i was reading in the</font>

508
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,060
paper an article about<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft now</font>

509
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,490
saying

510
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,110
that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to they're they're</font>

511
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,360
looking at encrypting all of their all

512
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,300
of their services<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a direct response</font>

513
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,820
to what Edward Snowden revealed by

514
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,590
leaking these documents to Glenn

515
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,290
Greenwald and Laura Poitras you know

516
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,700
Glenn who is a friend of mine and I'm

517
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">working with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him now he always has</font>

518
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,650
courage breeds courage and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

519
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,300
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what Edward Snowden</font>

520
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,490
did it's true what Chelsea Manning did

521
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,640
other people may be afraid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak out</font>

522
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,570
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear that they're going to get</font>

523
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,490
locked up for live in exile but I think

524
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,870
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people will see that and say</font>

525
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,450
you know I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like that ya nour</font>

526
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,070
that's the example so I and I think

527
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,510
you're right it like final two questions

528
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,490
are more personal ones but I think ones

529
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,290
that will benefit anyone watching the

530
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">first one is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you research and</font>

531
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,710
when I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I I literally mean</font>

532
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,010
what is the process because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even I like</font>

533
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,170
to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm quite good at reading</font>

534
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,300
up I make nice of videos i watch online

535
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,360
I'm starting to build folders but just

536
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,090
what is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> etiquette wait for as you</font>

537
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,440
can see in the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> the film I actually</font>

538
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,330
don't know how to type I've developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

539
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,250
own I use four fingers and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you</font>

540
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,630
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the Hollywood thing where you</font>

541
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,030
know they do the no no I actually know

542
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,950
we could if we can if you want it you

543
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">can watch my baby i'll show you my own</font>

544
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">system but i'm actually quite fast at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

545
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,320
um you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I when you're when you are</font>

546
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigating the US government it's not</font>

547
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is online and you have to</font>

548
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,880
learn the process of filing what are

549
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,010
basically like many lawsuits<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

550
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to documents so a large part of</font>

551
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the research requires you to use old</font>

552
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,870
snail mail to apply for things I work

553
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,600
with researchers also and sometimes

554
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,400
they'll go and dig in archives when we

555
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,710
were doing the book about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Blackwater my</font>

556
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,000
researcher this guy named Garrett

557
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,740
ordower who is fantastic went to this

558
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,770
tiny town where the Blackwater owner is

559
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,450
from and went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through look physically</font>

560
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,880
went through the archives but also you

561
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,120
know you you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use LexisNexis</font>

562
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,280
you know which is usually can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

563
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
friend who's at a university to give you

564
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,550
their password for free right um you

565
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,929
know which has a database it's basically

566
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:48,970
like digitized microfiche where you can

567
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,910
go back through through time

568
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,470
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> note 02 is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key to any</font>

569
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,940
kind of effective research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you</font>

570
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,590
have to keep your stuff straight it's

571
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,669
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why I use</font>

572
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:58,320
old-fashioned

573
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,389
paper and pin things on walls you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

574
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:01,860
you sit there and you look at the same

575
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,330
things over and over and you always will

576
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,490
learn something new right you know you

577
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,019
by staring at it's like one of those

578
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,669
things that were popular than 90 s<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

579
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,049
pictures that just look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

580
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,340
pixels that have you stared at them long

581
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,200
enough you'd see some magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lions yeah</font>

582
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,940
yeah yeah but it's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

583
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're in the matrix when you're doing</font>

584
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,419
this kind of research but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I</font>

585
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say to anyone doing any kind of</font>

586
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,789
journalism or reporting nothing is a

587
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,740
replacement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for old fashioned going out</font>

588
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,330
and talking to people that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

589
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,940
research that you can do there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

590
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,649
will never get more information out of

591
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,269
someone then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will by sitting with</font>

592
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,919
them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get it by chatting with</font>

593
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,480
them you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it by emailing them</font>

594
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,669
or texting them going out getting your

595
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:41,070
fingers dirty in there in the real world

596
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,139
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best form of research that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

597
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,879
can do so I've always really appreciate

598
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,230
about what you do is especially with

599
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,419
issues like in dirty wolves where it's

600
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:49,889
clearly a motive being involved with

601
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:52,740
those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you managed to stay</font>

602
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,500
measured and and just report the facts I

603
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,990
mean I'm sure yeah theme you have to

604
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,190
have empathy for people i also think

605
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that journalists have to</font>

606
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:02,429
be objective is total bullshit

607
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,100
objectivity is used as a code for being

608
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,840
devoted to the official version put out

609
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,730
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state yes you know it's just it's</font>

610
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,649
completely fabricated which is a huge

611
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:12,149
debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment on I Glenn's Brent</font>

612
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:13,259
talking out with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York Times</font>

613
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,450
editor and yeah I mean but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's but I</font>

614
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,370
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York Times your bill keller</font>

615
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Times feels like he has</font>

616
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,269
some crown of objectivity that he can

617
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:23,519
wear I mean you know they and I think

again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I knew that I wanted to be a</font>

658
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,960

659
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,669

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,490

six months in a place I wanted to report

663
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,370
on and whether I could get someone to

664
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,740
hire me or not go there and take myself

665
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,750
seriously and give myself assignments

666
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,700
