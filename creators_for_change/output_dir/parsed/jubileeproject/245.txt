gets around under Daisy I'm gonna be
walking without shoes today
caricature project and today we're going
without shoes that kids don't have to
this is a really important issue for us
to get involved with because millions of
children around the world suffer from
risk of infection and foot disease
because they can't afford a pair of
shoes so we're gonna spend the day today
with people across the country
some graffiti over
all that been pretty much everything you
can possibly go to work
we're raising awareness safe for our
kids across the world they don't have to
but yeah I understand your policy thank
you
this is so bad because there's people
across the country as well as you're
doing this with me today so is everyone
that's doing this with me doing it and
be encouraged because we're all here
with them
all right it's my desk we finally made
it here safe and sound
spent the cold in the rain and all that
sticky stuff and then the gooey stuff in
the ground we finally made it here in
one piece to success
hey guys so I'm in Boston right now
I'm at school I toes hey no how does
this pretty lil selves feels great I
mean it doesn't feel good to think about
all the people who don't have shoes but
feels good to be in solidarity that's
right
you guys can take your shoes as well and
join us it's okay I didn't pay my toes
all those
so I'm walking around on my lunch break
without any shoes outside and I've got
to say it's pretty liberating I really
enjoy it but more I'm very excited about
this day because I know people all
around the world are walking barefoot
for amazing cause to raise a lot of
awareness for TOMS shoes so I'm very
excited to see the videos that come out
of this thank you so much a few partaken
yeah we have a great day doing good is
contagious so we're standing outside
pouring rain right now
that just makes the ground cleaner so
we're going apartment hunting right now
with Josh and Margie I think my feets
getting numb and cold
not a nice nice yeah what's great like
that where you look like yo these late
sticks and rocks oh wow Jonathan look at
look at all these Ross okay
God's going strong though John John
yours that is intense yep yep let's see
it
oh how is your experience then today
though she takes longer walk places so
it's been about eight hours
I've been shoeless or since like 8 a.m.
this morning I feel like I've gotten
really in touch with my surroundings and
it's like being more like aware
especially on
they'll have shoes what they're
especially since they walked on surfaces
like like volcanic rock and really
terrible soil and get a lot of terrible
diseases that's why like so
that we made me reflect and be more
thoughtful
it's been a great experience
so we ran into this guy on the way home
and have shoes on the question yes shoes
but it's okay we don't play enough
wordplay so I said fine yeah that's good
yeah it sucks that no one even celebrate
I just hey you still have two hours left
in the day so he's gonna be walking home
without you guys thank you thank you for
a nice Brandon hey Brandon thanks so
much
all right take care
in case
we just forcibly took off the shoes
seriously it was quite an experience
overall though we're so blessed to be a
part of this movement of people across
the country in the world who decided to
go without shoes today to help those
don't have shoes and so I hope that this
was an inspiration to all of you and
that it will inspire you to make a
difference in your own communities when
you watch this video thanks so much for
watching JP love
