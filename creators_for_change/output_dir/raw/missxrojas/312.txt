00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,660
John Green made a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks ago</font>

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,490
because it was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about books and it</font>

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,110
was a really well presented video giving

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,650
Fault<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Our Stars but you've probably</font>

12
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,789
already read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that would be really</font>

13
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,109
boring so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just jump in with</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else a for people who love</font>

15

like grim and once upon a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

17

slightly darker side tender morsels by

Margo Lanagan earlier this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reread</font>

21
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,110
this book and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> even better than</font>

22
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first time I read it it is difficult</font>

23

warning for sexual assault<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's such</font>

25
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,760
a complex and rich story and once you're

26
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,710
inside it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get lost within it</font>

27
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,629
and you just can't put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down and it's</font>

28
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,120
a fantastic book and absolutely

29
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,890
fantastic work of fiction in the same

30
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,199
vein also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for lovers of revolution and</font>

35

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overthrowing of the Romanovs and</font>

36
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,619
also of the ensuing political choices

37
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,810
that everyone had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make Arthur ransoms</font>

38

as destroy each other and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

40
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,270
affected his stories and the stories

41
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,700
that he told and the impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Russia</font>

42
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,549
had on him it's also a story it's also

43
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,400
fiction so it's this magnificent

44
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,470
blending of fact and fiction to the

45
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,090
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it doesn't really matter what</font>

46
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">genre is just like tender morsels it's</font>

47
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,090
one of those things that comes under the

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">teen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> category when we categorize it in</font>

49
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,140
bookshops but it is also you know

50
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,020
equally suitable for adults as well and

51
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is no restriction to that at all i</font>

52
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,670
don't think kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of going the opposite</font>

53
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,710
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Black Swan green by David Mitchell</font>

54
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,600
is book that is normally categorized in

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,399
the adult category but could equally be

56
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,950
put in teen fiction<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's story of a very</font>

57
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,990
young teenager called Jason in the 80s

58
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,610
and everything it was going on at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

59
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,560
time with the Falklands War and just

60
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,329
although all the noise around him as

61
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:58,649
well as his personal problems at home

62
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> burrows at school but it's fantastic</font>

63
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,189
it's from David Mitchell not the

64
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">comedian the writer who also wrote Cloud</font>

65
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,210
Atlas another one of the ways to go is

66
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,250
also his book ghost written this was

67
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,050
David Mitchell's debut novel and has

68
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,150
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same features as cloud</font>

69
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,310
atlas<font color="#CCCCCC"> has multiple narratives and also</font>

70
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,189
has a strange slightly creepy maybe

71
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,680
otherworldly feature to it I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font>

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,879
this book i first read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when I was</font>

well to rereading certs ghostwritten the

92
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,920
to tell a different aspect of their

like big books and I cannot lie finally

probably best known for brave new world

179
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,909
