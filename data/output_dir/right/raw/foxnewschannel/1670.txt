DURING THREE COMBAT TOURS I

00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,040
TAKING AWAY.

00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,807
MY CHAINSAW IS READY TO RIP UP

26
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,444
SOME REGULATIONS.

27
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:00,378
I'VE GOT A BIG TRUCK JUST IN

28
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:03,081

00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,516
ILLEGALS AND TAKE THEM HOME

30
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:11,022
MYSELF.

31
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:15,494
YEP, I JUST SAID THAT.

32
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:16,194
WE WANTED TO GET THE SUBTLETY

33
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:16,695
AND THAT MESSAGE?

34
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:17,329
LAST AND MOST PROVOCATIVE,

35
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:17,896
PERHAPS, I DON'T KNOW.

36
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:18,530
IT'S A PRETTY TOUGH RACE.

37
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,064
MICHAEL WILLIAMS.

00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:20,265
>> WEEK AT THE DEPORTATION BUS.

39
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:22,968

PLAN THAT'S GOING TO FILL THIS

47
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:35,847
BUS WITH ILLEGALS TO SEND THEM

48
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,849
BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

49
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,150
WE ARE NOT JUST GOING TO TRACK

50
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,085
THEM AND WATCH THEM ROAM AROUND

51
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:41,686
OUR STATE, WE ARE GOING TO PUT

52
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,788
THEM ON THIS BUS AND SEND THEM

53
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:44,089

00:01:46,725 --> 00:01:48,860
GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS EVENING,

57
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,961
SIR.

58
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:54,399
HOW DID THIS IDEA COME TO YOU

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,334
AND YOU ARE I THINK FIFTH IN THE

60
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:56,835
POLLS RIGHT NOW.

61
00:01:56,835 --> 00:01:58,069
IS IT SORT OF A LAST DITCH

62
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:59,604
EFFORT TO GET SOME ATTENTION I

63
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:02,307
GUESS IS ONE QUESTION?

64
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,041
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU SO

65
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,243
MUCH FOR HAVING US ON IN THE WAY

66
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,646
THAT WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA,

67
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:09,080
MY CAMPAIGN STAFF, WE WERE

68
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,014
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND

69
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,216
OF BUS TO WHERE WE WANTED TO

70
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,284
HAVE AND WE DECIDED WE DIDN'T

71
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,286
WANT TO DO ONE OF THOSE

72
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,420
TRADITIONAL KIND OF BORING

73
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,087
CAMPAIGN BUS STORIES.

74
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,156
WE WANTED TO COME UP WITH

75
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:19,291
SOMETHING THAT EXEMPLIFIES WHAT

76
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,359
OUR TAGLINE MEANT, WHICH WAS

77
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:22,160
FEARLESS CONSERVATIVE, AS WELL

78
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,229
AS ADDRESSES AN ISSUE THAT IS

79
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:27,098
PIVOTAL TO MY CAMPAIGN AS WELL

80
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:28,667
AS IMPORTANT TO ALL GEORGIANS,

81
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,401
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SO WE CAME

82
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,503
UP WITH THE MICHAEL WILLIAMS

83
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:33,672
DEPORTATION BUS TOUR AND WE

84
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,874
ACTUALLY STARTED IT TODAY AND WE

85
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:37,642
WENT TO TWO SANCTUARY CITIES TO

86
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,376
BRING ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS

87
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:41,646
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HERE IN

88
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:43,848
OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY AND WE

89
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:44,583
FEEL VERY, VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT

90
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,451
OUR POSITION IN THIS RACE.

91
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:48,453
WE HAVE HAD TONS OF PEOPLE REACH

92
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,921
OUT TO US OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

93
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,589
WEEKS SAYING THEY'VE ALREADY

94
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:51,022
VOTED FOR US.

95
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,291
I KNOW THERE ARE POLLS OUT THERE

96
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,259
THAT WANT TO SAY OTHERWISE BUT

97
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,794
WE ALL KNOW POLLS DON'T MATTER,

98
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,095
WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS WHO SHOWS

99
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:58,063
UP AT THE BALLOT BOX.

100
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,264
HE >> Martha: YOU HAVE A VIDEO

101
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:01,366
ABOUT THE BUS AND IT WAS TAKEN

102
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,634
DOWN BY YOUTUBE.

103
00:03:02,634 --> 00:03:03,468
WHY WAS THAT AND I BELIEVE THEY

104
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,272
PUT IT BACK UP, RIGHT?

105
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:07,973
>> ABSOLUTELY.

106
00:03:07,973 --> 00:03:10,675
THEY TOOK IT DOWN BECAUSE THEY

107
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,309
SAID, AND THEY SENT US A

108
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:14,245
CONFIRMATION THAT THEY TOOK IT

109
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,281
DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS FEAR, HATE

110
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:16,648
SPEECH.

111
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,049
WHAT WAS REALLY EXCITING TO ME

112
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,484
WAS THAT WE HAD SUPPORTERS NOT

113
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:21,553
JUST HERE IN GEORGIA, BUT ALL

114
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:22,854
OVER THE COUNTRY.

115
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,289
PEOPLE THAT LOVE THE

116
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,523
FIRST AMENDMENT, THAT LOVE OUR

117
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:26,257
CONSERVATIVE VALUES.

118
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,292
THEY REACHED OUT TO YOUTUBE AND

119
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,727
SET PUT THAT VIDEO BACK UP AND

120
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:31,262
THEY CAVED AND THEY PUT IT BACK

121
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,964
UP SO I WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT

122
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:33,465
HAPPEN.

123
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:34,532
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

124
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,300
HAPPENING IN YOUR STATE, THERE

125
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,336
WAS A PERIOD WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE

126
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:42,307
IT COULD GO BLUE, SORT OF

127
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:43,108
BLUE-RED IN GEORGIA.

128
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,142
AT WHAT YOU'RE FEELING FOR HOW

129
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,444
YOUR STATE IS SHIFTING RIGHT NOW

130
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,612
AND HOW DO YOU THINK THAT YOU

131
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:48,580
CAN MAKE UP THE GROUND THAT YOU

132
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,583
APPEAR TO HAVE LOST TO CASEY,

133
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,652
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNMENT THERE?

134
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,920
>> WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT CASEY

135
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,956
CAGLE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT TO

136
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:58,857
THE RUNOFF.

137
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:00,458
HE'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR ALMOST A

138
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,660
QUARTER OF A CENTURY.

139
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,460
REALLY HIGH NAME I.D.

140
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,628
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD NAME IDEA BUT

141
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:06,464
IT'S HIGH.

142
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:07,499
OUR GOAL, OUR OBJECTIVE WAS

143
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:08,900
ALWAYS TO MAKE IT TO THAT SECOND

144
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,634
SPOT SO WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE

145
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:11,870
RUNOFF WITH HIM AND AS FAR AS

146
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,072
THE STATE GOING BLUE, GOING RED,

147
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,808
WE HERE IN GEORGIA, WE LOVE OUR

148
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,642
PRESIDENT, WE LOVE WHAT HE'S

149
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:19,377
DOING, WE LOVE THE VALUES THAT

150
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,480
HE IS FIGHTING FOR AND I AM 100%

151
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,214
CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO

152
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:26,418
HAVE A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN

153
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:26,918
GEORGIA IN 2019.

154
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:27,619
>> Martha: DID YOU GET ANYBODY

155
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:30,889
ON THE BUS YET?

156
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:31,856
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

157
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,892
THAT WE GET ASKED AS WE TRAVEL

158
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:35,126
AROUND, WE'VE SPOKEN TO MANY

159
00:04:35,126 --> 00:04:37,062
NEWS OUTLETS AND THEY WANT TO

160
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:38,463
KNOW, ARE YOU ACTUALLY PICKING

161
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:39,464
UP ILLEGALS AND PUTTING THEM ON

162
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:39,864
THE BUS?

163
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,666
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO WE ARE

164
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:41,933
NOT.

165
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:42,801
THE PURPOSE OF THE BUS IS TO

166
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:46,705
BRING ATTENTION TO MY 287G

167
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,273
DEPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD

168
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,774
ALLOW SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES TO HAVE

169
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,043
MANY OF THEIR DEPUTIES ACT AS

170
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:55,413
ICE AGE AND SO WE CAN HAVE 159

171
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:59,884
COUNTIES WITH ACTING AS AGENTS.

172
00:04:59,884 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY CAN BEGIN THE DEPORTATION
