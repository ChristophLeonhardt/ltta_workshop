1
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,479
The quilts have been part of this 
work for years already.

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,069
We've been making them for
about three years.

3
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:27,490
We gather people together in these 
sewing bees across this country

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,100
and in Australia and Taiwan.

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,899
The atmosphere kept changing as, of
course, the light changed,

6
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,050
and the moods change and the shifts
change and I just mean mood

7
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,080
in terms of light and how
the night shifts.

8
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,169
The relationship between the performers 
and the audience is

9
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:01,490
very much that we are all here together.

10
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,310
We have gathered here together.
We are in this together.

11
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,100
I wanted people in the morning, as the 
sun came up,

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:00:00,000
to just be able to step into this new day 
changed and ready.
