1
00:00:02,368 --> 00:00:02,635
GARLAND. 

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,003
HE SAID THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,905
NEEDED A BETTER CHANCE TO SPEAK 

4
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:08,141
AND IF THEY DECIDE DEMOCRATS 

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,109
SHOULD CONTROL THE SENATE THAN 

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,344
IT'S VERY HARD TO ARGUE THAT 

7
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,612
REPUBLICANS SHOULD PUSH THROUGH 

8
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,546
A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN THE 

9
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,314
MONTH OF DECEMBER. 

10
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,382
>> WHAT I'VE BEEN WONDERING AND 

11
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,148
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, 

12
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:18,051
IS THAT IF THIS PROCESS IS 

13
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,355
RUSHED AND AS THERE ARE MORE 

14
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,791
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS, IF THE 

15
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,359
REPUBLICANS RUSH THIS PROCESS, 

16
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,362
AND THEY CAN GET WHAT THEY WANT 

17
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,432
ON THE PRIMA CORD, WITH THEY 

18
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,899
HAVE TO PAY DURING THE MIDTERM 

19
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,872
ELECTIONS? 

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,939
I DON'T KNOW HOW BRETT 

21
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,940
KAVANAUGH NOW BECOMES A SUPREME 

22
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,941
COURT JUSTICE WITHOUT AN 

23
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:46,813
ASTERISK BESIDE HIS NAME AND 

24
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,748
WITHOUT IT BEING TAINTED IN 

25
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,716
SOME WAY. 

26
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,519
THAT'S GOT TO PLAY OUT IN THE 

27
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:52,952
MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

28
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:53,520
ANYONE UPSET ABOUT HOW THE 

29
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,154
PROCESS HAS UNFOLDED -- 

30
00:00:54,154 --> 00:01:00,693
>> THE ONE ACCUSATION IS BAD, 

31
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,128
TWO AND NOW THREE, THESE ARE 

32
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:02,661
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS. 

33
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,497
THE QUESTION BECOMES -- I MEAN 

34
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,400
-- IS THERE GOING TO BE SOME 

35
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,468
SORT OF PRESSURE? 

36
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,103
EVEN IF WE UNDERSTAND THE 

37
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,438
PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE TO LOSE 

38
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,407
AND IF HE BELIEVES THERE IS A 

39
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,209
CON JOB OR MEMBERS WHO BELIEVE 

40
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,343
IT IS A SMEAR TACTIC BY 

41
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,211
DEMOCRATS -- FOR JUDGE 

42
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,012
KAVANAUGH AND MITCH McCONNELL, 

43
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,949
WHAT DO THEY DO? 

44
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,650
DO THEY SAY THAT FOR THE GOOD 

45
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,419
OF THE COUNTRY, FOR YOUR FAMILY 

46
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:32,125
AND FOR THE PARTY, THIS MAY NOT 

47
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,526
BE THE BEST PATH FORWARD? 

48
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,029
>> FOR MITCH McCONNELL, PLAIN 

49
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,398
AND SIMPLE, IT'S A NUMBERS 

50
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:38,598
GAME. 

51
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,632
IF HE THINKS HE CAN GET 

52
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,433
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED, HE IS 

53
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,705
GOING TO STICK WITH HIM FOR THE 

54
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,575
REASONS I OUTLINED BEFORE. 

55
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,109
YES, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE 

56
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,110
COULD TAKE THIS INTANGIBLE HIT 

57
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,510
IN THE MIDTERMS. 

58
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,213
HE MAY FEEL THAT IS MORE OF A 

59
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,314
TANGIBLE VICTORY OF GETTING ON 

60
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,149
THE SUPREME COURT. 

61
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,057
BEYOND THAT, THE REALITY FOR HIM

62
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:06,392
IS THAT THE MINUTE TWO OR MORE 

63
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:11,764
REPUBLICAN SENATORS -- THE 

64
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,434
AMOUNT HE CAN AFFORD TO LOSE IF 

65
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,301
DEMOCRATS VOTE NO, THE MINUTE 

66
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,636
THEY SAY I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS 

67
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,470
GUY, IT'S OVER. 

68
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,907
IT'S OVER AND McCONNELL KNOWS 

69
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,277
THAT. 

70
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,112
MAYBE HE WILL HAVE EVERYONE 

71
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:27,780
TAKE A VOTE TO SHOW HE DOESN'T 

72
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,048
HAVE THE VOTE OR MAYBE HE 

73
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,049
DECIDES I DON'T WANT TO MAKE 

74
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,850
EVERYONE TAKE A VOTE. 

75
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,190
HE MAY GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

76
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,492
SAY HE CAN'T GET HIM CONFIRMED 

77
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,227
BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED, YET. 

78
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,363
>> NANCY, I HOPE YOU CAN STICK 

79
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:43,596
AROUND. 

80
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,263
CLEARLY WE WOULD WANT TO HEAR 

81
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:48,701
FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. 

82
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,837
MY THOUGHTS ARE THEY WON'T BE 

83
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,138
HAVING A LOT OPPRESSED WHILE 

84
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,239
THEY DIGEST THIS INFORMATION. 

85
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,775
STICK AROUND BECAUSE WE WANT TO 

86
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,010
BRING IN AN ATTORNEY THAT IS 

87
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,111
JOINING US ON THE PHONE TO TALK 

88
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,178
US THROUGH THIS. 

89
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,514
THANK YOU JULIE RENDLEMAN FOR 

90
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:07,520
JOINING US. 

91
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,454
ANNE-MARIE POINTED OUT THAT THE 

92
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,923
AFFIDAVIT RELEASED BY ATTORNEY 

93
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,626
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS SUBMITTED 

94
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,930
AND YOU CANNOT LIE IN THESE. 

95
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,967
IF YOU DO, THEN YOU COULD BE -- 

96
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,901
THIS IS PERJURY. 

97
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:28,007
THE THREAT OF PERJURY. 

98
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,143
>> I CAN SEE A SITUATION WHERE 

99
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,212
SUPPORTERS OF MR. KAVANAUGH 

100
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,180
SAY, LOOK, THESE ARE JUST 

101
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,982
ALLEGATIONS AND THERE IS NO 

102
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,649
PROOF OF THIS. 

103
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,086
WHAT DOES THIS AFFIDAVIT MEAN, 

104
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:40,853
LEGALLY SPEAKING, WHEN IT COMES 

105
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,587
TO THESE ALLEGATIONS? 

106
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:42,855
WHERE DOES THE BURDEN OF PROOF 

107
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,992
LIVE? 

108
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,727
>> FIRST OF ALL, LET ME SAY WE 

109
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,195
WERE ALL WAITING FOR MR. 

110
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:50,730
AVENATTI. 

111
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,732
I THINK IT WAS 48 HOURS AND 

112
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,499
PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER HE 

113
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,500
WOULD AND HE FULFILLED HIS 

114
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,767
PROMISE. 

115
00:03:54,767 --> 00:04:01,441
WHAT IS THIS AFFIDAVIT? 

116
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,542
IT HAS CREDIBILITY BECAUSE IT 

117
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,044
IS A SWORN AFFIDAVIT. 

118
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,813
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S NO CHANCE OF 

119
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,514
CROSS-EXAMINATION UNLESS SHE IS 

120
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,148
PERMITTED TO TESTIFY LIKE 

121
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:09,515
EVERYONE ELSE. 

122
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,382
MANY WILL SAY SHE SHOULD BE 

123
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:14,187
TESTIFYING, AS WELL. 

124
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,121
THE BIG THING ABOUT WHAT SHE 

125
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,289
SAYS IS THAT SHE REFUTES NOT 

126
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,957
ONLY EVERYTHING KAVANAUGH SAYS 

127
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,027
BUT THERE WAS AN ILL-ADVISED 

128
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:27,300
INTERVIEW AND THERE WERE A LOT 

129
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,334
OF DETAILS IN REGARDS TO HIS 

130
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,202
BEHAVIOR BACK THEN AND THE 

131
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,169
BEHAVIOR OF MARK JUDGE WHICH 

132
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,004
CORROBORATES WHAT THE MAIN 

133
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:36,909
WITNESS IS SAYING AND THAT 

134
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,476
HURTS KAVANAUGH INCREDIBLY. 

135
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:38,578
>> I WAS CURIOUS WHAT YOU 

136
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,578
THOUGHT ABOUT THE WAY THE 

137
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:45,485
DECLARATION WAS MAPPED OUT. 

138
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,219
THE MOST EXPLOSIVE PART DOESN'T 

139
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,622
COME UNTIL THE VERY END. 

140
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,057
THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING 

141
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,525
VERY STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW SHE 

142
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,061
EXPLAINS HOW SHE MET MARK JUDGE 

143
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,162
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH, THE NATURE 

144
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,596
OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND HOW SHE 

145
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:58,898
OBSERVED THE TWO MEN AND THEIR 

146
00:04:58,898 --> 00:04:59,231
RELATIONSHIP. 

147
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,266
WHAT DO YOU MAKE ABOUT HOW IT 

148
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,237
IS ALL SORT OF LAID OUT? 

149
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,070
>> YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. 

150
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,339
WHEN SHE DESCRIBES WHO SHE IS, 

151
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:13,012
NOT JUST SOME WOMAN COMING OUT 

152
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,414
OF NOWHERE, THIS IS A WOMAN WHO 

153
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,715
HAD SECURITY CLEARANCES TIME 

154
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:20,620
AND TIME AGAIN AND NOT SOMEONE 

155
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,923
WHO SEEMS TO HAVE AN AX TO 

156
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,957
GRIND. 

157
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,526
ALTHOUGH, REMEMBER THAT SHE 

158
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,092
HASN'T BEEN INVENTED. 

159
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:28,694
SHE WAS VETTED ARGUABLY BY 

160
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:29,962
AVENATTI BUT BOTH SIDES HAVE A 

161
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:30,797
RIGHT TO VETERAN MAKE A 

162
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,831
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR 

163
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:37,870
NOT THERE IS ANY BIAS OR ANY 

164
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,672
REASON SHE MIGHT COME FORWARD 

165
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,105
AND BE DISHONEST. 

166
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:40,907
I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS 

167
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,941
SURPRISED TO HEAR AGAIN FROM 

168
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,979
ANOTHER FEMALE THAT WHEN 

169
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,747
KAVANAUGH WAS YOUNGER, THAT 

170
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,548
ESTABLISHES HE WAS A BIG 

171
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:54,554
DRINKER, A BIG PARTIER AND THAT 

172
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,355
IT LED TO SOME ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR 

173
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:57,290
TOWARD WOMEN. I 

174
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,159
DON'T THINK IT IS A SHOCKER 

175
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,061
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN 

176
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,196
HEARING AND I CERTAINLY THINK 

177
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:03,863
IT CONTRADICTS INCREDIBLY WHAT 

178
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,931
HE'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH 

179
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,300
HIMSELF AS. 

180
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,335
HE MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT TODAY 

181
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,469
THAN HE WAS THEN BUT IT DOESN'T 

182
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,973
REMOVE THE FACT THAT HE BEHAVED 

183
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,107
LIKE HE DID WHEN HE WAS YOUNG. 

184
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,909
>> IT'S INTERESTING THAT MR. 

185
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,844
KAVANAUGH HAS THIS CALENDAR 

186
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:23,149
THAT HE SAID HE HAS. 

187
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:29,755
IT'S SURPRISING THAT HE IS AN 

188
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:30,523
INCREDIBLE LAWYER AND HE WOULD 

189
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,760
SAY, I'VE GOT THIS CALENDAR 

190
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,263
THAT I KEPT WHEN I WAS A 

191
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,298
TEENAGER AND IT SHOWS ALL THESE 

192
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,433
ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BEACH 

193
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:40,633
WEEK. 

194
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,467
WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS 

195
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,535
THAT NUMBER NINE ON THE 

196
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,402
AFFIDAVIT FROM MR. AVENATTI AND 

197
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:48,408
FROM MS. SWETNICK. 

198
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,576
HE SAID I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS 

199
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,344
OCCURRED IN OCEAN CITY, 

200
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,178
MARYLAND AND I WITNESSED THIS 

201
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,112
ON ONE OCCASION IN OCEAN CITY, 

202
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,746
MARYLAND DURING BEACH WEEK. 

203
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,684
HE WAS SUGGESTING HE WAS THERE 

204
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,285
TO EXONERATE HIM. 

205
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,020
IF YOU WERE IN COURT AND 

206
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:12,832
SOMEBODY WERE IT IS -- SOMEBODY 

207
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,434
WAS TRYING TO PROVE INNOCENCE 

208
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,502
BY GOING BACK TO A CALENDAR IN 

209
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,171
THE OUR TEEN YEARS, IS THAT 

210
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:18,471
ADMISSIBLE? 

211
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,972
>> IT MIGHT BE. 

212
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,708
WHAT YOU GET IS THAT WHEN YOU 

213
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,244
HAVE A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT, ONE 

214
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,712
THING YOU SAY IS KEEP YOUR 

215
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,146
MOUTH SHUT. 

216
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,614
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. 

217
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,016
THE THINGS THAT YOU THINK WILL 

218
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,452
HELP YOU WILL HURT YOU IN THE 

219
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,455
END BECAUSE YOU WILL BE TIED TO 

220
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:35,855
WHAT YOU SAID. 

221
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,291
IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND 

222
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,492
SUGGEST A SPECIFIC LOCATION 

223
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,193
LIKE HE SUGGESTED, IT IT OPENS 

224
00:07:41,193 --> 00:07:43,930
THE DOOR TO WITNESS IS SAYING, I

225
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,699
SAW HIM THERE AND HE WAS RAPING 

226
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,699
A WOMAN OR ATTACKING A WOMAN OR 

227
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:52,471
HE WAS INEBRIATED AND BEING 

228
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,240
INAPPROPRIATE TO WOMEN. 

229
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,509
NOW, HE'S TIED HIMSELF INTO 

230
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,510
THOSE SPECIFIC TIMES AND 

231
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,779
WITNESSES ARE NOW SAYING HE DID 

232
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,412
SOMETHING COMPLETELY ABHORRENT. 

233
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,282
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FEELS THE 

234
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,318
NEED TO OPEN HIS MOUTH. I 

235
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,052
WOULD KILL TO BE CROSS-

236
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,419
EXAMINING HIM. 

237
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,386
UNFORTUNATELY, I WON'T GET THAT 

238
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:07,619
CHANCE. 

239
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:11,123
>> JULIE, STAND BY. 

240
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,291
WE WILL BE JOINED BY RIKKI 

241
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,829
KLEIMAN ON THE PHONE. 

242
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,297
BEFORE WE GET TO THIS QUESTION, 

243
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,699
I WENT TO GET BACK TO NANCY. 

244
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,234
IF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

245
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:26,973
COMMITTEE CHOOSES TO IGNORE 

246
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,007
THIS ALLEGATION AND I DON'T 

247
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,442
KNOW IF THEY CAN -- BUT IF THEY 

248
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:34,413
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS HEARING, 

249
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,381
CAN THE DEMOCRATS RAISE 

250
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,414
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THIRD 

251
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,649
ACCUSER IN THE HEARING 

252
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:37,916
TOMORROW? 

253
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,085
OR WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED OUT 

254
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,251
OF LINE SINCE NONE OF THE 

255
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:40,885
PEOPLE INVOLVED ARE THERE? 

256
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,289
>> Reporter: THEY CAN TALK 

257
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:55,968
ABOUT ANYTHING THEY WANT. 

258
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,869
THEY OBVIOUSLY WOULD POSE MORE 

259
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,502
QUESTIONS TO KAVANAUGH, 

260
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,204
HIMSELF, RATHER THAN FORD 

261
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:04,243
ALTHOUGH THEY COULD ASK HER AS 

262
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,011
SOMEONE WHO ATTENDED AT LEAST 

263
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,178
ONE PARTY WITH KAVANAUGH, 

264
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:10,216
HERSELF. 

265
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,453
OR, IF THEY FELT WHAT HAPPENED 

266
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,988
TO HER WAS AN ATTEMPT TO DO 

267
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:16,756
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF 

268
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,723
WHAT SWETNICK OUTLINES HAPPENED 

269
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:26,632
TO HER AT A LARGER PARTY. 

270
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,299
REPUBLICANS, OSTENSIBLY, COULD 

271
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,234
ASK THE SAME THING ALTHOUGH 

272
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,405
IT'S LIKELY THAT MOST OF THEM 

273
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,272
WILL STEER CLEAR. 

274
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,073
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, EVEN 

275
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:40,312
THOUGH THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE 

276
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,414
INCREDIBLY EXPLOSIVE, THERE MAY 

277
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,348
BE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS WHO WANT 

278
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:47,219
TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS BECAUSE 

279
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,622
THEY WANT TO GET CHRISTINE FORD 

280
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,791
ON THE RECORD AND THEY WANT TO 

281
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,292
BE ABLE TO SEE HER AND HEAR 

282
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:53,559
FROM HER. 

283
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,660
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE MORE 

284
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,264
POWERFUL THAN SEEING A 

285
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:58,831
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE IN WHICH 

286
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,701
SOMEONE WAS INTERVIEWED. 

287
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:06,505
IT MAY BE THAT SHE IS A VERY 

288
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:14,780
POWERFUL -- PROVIDES A POWERFUL 

289
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,149
ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HER 

290
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,250
AND IT MIGHT MAKE HER MORE 

291
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,550
BELIEVABLE. 

292
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,719
IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE 

293
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,988
WALK AWAY BEING OVERWHELMED. 

294
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:23,422
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 

295
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:30,262
IT'S A COMBINATION OF HAVING 

296
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,932
THIS INFORMATION OUT AND THE 

297
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,134
IRONIC THING, I HAVE TO TELL 

298
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,135
YOU, IS THAT EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE 

299
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,169
KIND OF KEEPING AVENATTI AT 

300
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,003
ARMS LENGTH THROUGH THE EARLY 

301
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:44,210
PART OF THE WEEK BECAUSE HE HAS 

302
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,944
A REPUTATION, FAIRLY OR 

303
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:45,811
UNFAIRLY, ON CAPITOL HILL, AS 

304
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,012
BEING THE LAWYER OF STORMY 

305
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:52,451
DANIELS. 

306
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,219
HE LOVES THE CAMERA AND 

307
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:53,986
DEMOCRATS, JUST LIKE 

308
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,620
REPUBLICANS, DON'T QUITE KNOW 

309
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,860
WHAT TO MAKE OF WHAT HE PUT IN 

310
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,094
THE EMAILS ABOUT GANG RAPE AND 

311
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,729
ALL THE REST AND THEY WERE 

312
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,664
WORRIED, FRANKLY, THAT WAS 

313
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,498
HURTING THEM BECAUSE THEY 

314
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,733
DIDN'T KNOW IF HE ACTUALLY HAD 

315
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,502
THE GOODS TO BACK UP WHAT HE 

316
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,504
WAS SAYING. 

317
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,072
THEY DON'T HAVE A LONG HISTORY 

318
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:17,510
WITH HIM. 

319
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,911
HE HAS BEEN SAYING TO ME, THE 

320
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,746
ENTIRE TIME AND TO OTHERS, IS 

321
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,016
THAT HE DID HAVE A CREDIBLE 

322
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,020
CLIENT WHO WAS READY AND 

323
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,488
WILLING TO GO PUBLIC AND WITHIN 

324
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,025
THE NEXT 48 HOURS, WHILE HE IS 

325
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,225
SOMEWHAT NEW TO THE POLITICAL 

326
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:42,468
WORLD AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR 

327
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,270
OR SO BECAUSE OF THE 

328
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,337
PRESENTATION OF CHARLIE'S -- 

329
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,505
STORMY DANIELS, HE IS ACTUALLY 

330
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,740
A LAWYER WITH A LOT OF 

331
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,912
VICTORIES IN COURT AS A TRIAL 

332
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,548
LAWYER. 

333
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,982
HE SAID IT WAS NOT IN HIS 

334
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,850
INTEREST TO HURT HIS REPUTATION 

335
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,650
BY OVERPROMISING WHEN HE DIDN'T 

336
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,154
ACTUALLY HAVE A SERIOUS CLIENT 

337
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,289
WILLING TO COME FORWARD AT THE 

338
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,023
END OF THE DAY. 

339
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,926
>> I'VE SEEN SOME PUNDITS AND 

340
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,793
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA SUGGESTING 

341
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:13,699
THAT THE WEAPONIZATION, IF YOU 

342
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,867
WILL, OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT, 

343
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,001
COULD COME BACK TO HURT THEM 

344
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,369
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE THINGS 

345
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,274
YOU POINT OUT ABOUT RICKY -- 

346
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:22,774
ABOUT MICHAEL AVENATTI. 

347
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:23,642
WE HAVE RIKKI KLEIMAN WITH US. 

348
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:27,513
HE WAS TEASING A THIRD CLIENT. 

349
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,048
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. 

350
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,216
IS NOT THE TYPE OF LAWYER THAT 

351
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,050
WOULD RISK HIS REPUTATION. 

352
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,754
NO ATTORNEY WOULD RISK THEIR 

353
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,722
REPUTATION AT THIS LEVEL OF THE 

354
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,957
GAME IF HE DIDN'T HAVE THE 

355
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,058
GOODS AND NOW, IT APPEARS ON 

356
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,058
PAPER THAT MR. AVENATTI HAS 

357
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:40,693
DELIVERED? 

358
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,726
>> Reporter: MICHAEL AVENATTI 

359
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:49,301
ANNOUNCED THAT AND IT'S NO 

360
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,603
SURPRISE TO ME, HE ANNOUNCED IT 

361
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,537
ON RACHEL MADDOX THE OTHER 

362
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:51,770
NIGHT. 

363
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,072
HE AS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHAT HE 

364
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,274
HAD AND HE ALSO WAS ABUNDANTLY 

365
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,008
CLEAR THAT HE WOULD DO IT AS AN 

366
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,612
ANNOUNCEMENT, APPROPRIATELY AND 

367
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,914
WITHIN 48 HOURS AT A POINT 

368
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:10,322
WHERE HE FELT THAT THE VICTIM'S 

369
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,457
SAFETY, HIS CLIENT'S SAFETY WAS 

370
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,591
IN A BETTER POSITION THAN AT 

371
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:19,131
THE TIME HE ANNOUNCED IT. 

372
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,932
WHAT HE CAME UP WITH IS WHAT I 

373
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,301
EXPECTED. 

374
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,640
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE IF ANYONE 

375
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,009
WAS LISTENING OR FOLLOWING HIM 

376
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:37,650
ON TWITTER. 

377
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,851
I'VE FOLLOWED AVENATTI'S WORK 

378
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,651
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 

379
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,319
STORMY DANIELS CASE. 

380
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,857
HE DOES NOT BLUFF. 

381
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,660
HE WAS GIVEN THE WORK IN TERMS 

382
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,561
OF HIS WRITTEN PRODUCT AND HE 

383
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:50,729
FOLLOWS THROUGH ON WHAT HE SAYS 

384
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,164
HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH. 

385
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,199
SO, THE FACT THAT HE NOW CAN 

386
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,969
RAISE THIS AFFIDAVIT IN ITS 

387
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,105
APPALLING DETAIL -- AND ONE OF 

388
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,740
THE THINGS INTERESTING ABOUT 

389
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,711
THE GANG RAPE THAT IS OUTLINED 

390
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:09,014
BY THE AFFIDAVIT -- IT'S NOTED 

391
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:16,588
THAT MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 

392
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:17,155
KAVANAUGH WERE PRESENT. 

393
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:17,689
THE INTERVIEW THAT BRETT 

394
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,958
KAVANAUGH DID ON FOX NEWS IS 

395
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:25,931
DIRECTLY CONTRADICTORY TO EVEN 

396
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,399
THE IDEA OF BEING PRESENT 

397
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,703
BECAUSE HE HAS DENIED THAT HE 

398
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,637
KNEW ABOUT ANYTHING CONCERNING 

399
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:38,110
GANG RAPE. 

400
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,977
>> YEAH. 

401
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,412
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IN 

402
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:40,712
THIS CASE. 

403
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:41,513
HE DID NOT JUST BEING THERE, 

404
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:48,120
AND IT IS SORT AS THE -- SORT 

405
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,922
OF THE LOWEST LEVEL OF 

406
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,222
ACCUSATION. 

407
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,457
YOU ARE AT A PARTY WITH 

408
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,891
UNDERAGE DRINKING AND WHILE 

409
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,159
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, IN THIS 

410
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,827
CASE. 

411
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,895
THE FACT THAT HE DENIED THAT 

412
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,762
CALLS INTO QUESTION ALMOST 

413
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,796
EVERYTHING ELSE HE SAID THAT HE 

414
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:58,664
STOOD FOR. 

415
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:03,335
>> Reporter: ANNE-MARIE, AS YOU 

416
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,671
KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS VERY CLEAR 

417
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,472
ABOUT A -- WHETHER ON OR OFF 

418
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,675
CAMERA -- I THOUGHT THAT THE 

419
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,876
INTERVIEW ON FOX NEWS WAS A 

420
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,276
TERRIBLE MISTAKE. 

421
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:11,743
IT WAS ILL ADVISED. 

422
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:14,546
NO MATTER HOW WELL HE MAY HAVE 

423
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,917
COME ACROSS, THE REALITY IS THAT

424
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:26,358
IT IS A LAWYER'S STREAM TO HAVE 

425
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,059
MATERIAL FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION 

426
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,861
AND HOW YOU GET THAT MATERIAL 

427
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,164
-- IT'S BECAUSE THE WITNESS 

428
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:32,998
MAKES A PRIOR STATEMENT. 

429
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,166
NOW, YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE 

430
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,769
PRIOR STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE 

431
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,006
ON FOX NEWS AND THEY CANNOT BE 

432
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,007
ERASED. 

433
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:49,415
THEREFORE, AS NANCY CORDES 

434
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,716
POINTS OUT, THE DEMOCRATS MAY 

435
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,318
HAVE FIVE MINUTES EACH. 

436
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:55,220
NEVERTHELESS, THEY HAVE THE 

437
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,321
ABILITY TO USE THOSE FIVE 

438
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,489
MINUTES IN A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY 

439
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,290
BY WHATEVER MEANS THEY DECIDE, 

440
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,663
TO DIVIDE UP THEIR TIME. 

441
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,833
THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD CROSS 

442
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,801
EXAMINER IN KAMALA HARRIS. 

443
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,669
THIS IS FROM HER WORLD. 

444
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,737
THE FOX NEWS INTERVIEW WAS A 

445
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,270
TERRIBLE MISTAKE. 

446
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,707
>> I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE 

447
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:20,913
PREVIOUS NOMINEES. 

448
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,349
AND, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 

449
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,650
WERE NAMES REMOVED FROM THE 

450
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,117
NOMINATION PROCESS? 

451
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:25,984
>> ONE I CAN REMEMBER IS 

452
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:36,895
HARRIET MYERS, NOMINATED BY 

453
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,529
FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. 

454
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:37,729
BUSH. 

455
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:38,764
SHE WAS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF 

456
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,865
HIS AND HIS FAMILY AND WORKED 

457
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,632
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 

458
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,233
SHE HAD VERY LITTLE 

459
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:41,900
UNDERSTANDING OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

460
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,168
LAW AND EVEN BEFORE SHE GOT TO 

461
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,003
THE SENATE JUDICIARY PROCESS, 

462
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,605
AND IF YOU REMEMBER THIS -- I'M 

463
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,873
USING MY OWN MEMORY -- BUT I 

464
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,740
REMEMBER HARRIET MYERS DIDN'T 

465
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,075
EVEN GET TO THE FLOOR OF THE 

466
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,011
SENATE FROM THE COMMITTEE LEVEL 

467
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:56,648
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE, HERSELF, TO 

468
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,983
WITHDRAW HER NOMINATION AND THE 

469
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:58,884
PRESIDENT ACCEPTED IT BECAUSE 

470
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,152
IT TURNED OUT SHE HAD BEEN MORE 

471
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,787
OF LIKE A PAL. 

472
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,423
>> SHE WAS A LAWYER BUT SHE 

473
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,691
WORKED IN AN OFFICE AND HAD 

474
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,624
NEVER BEEN A JUDGE AND HAD 

475
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:09,060
NEVER JUDGED CASES. 

476
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,296
IN MODERN TIMES, THAT IS THE 

477
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,931
ONLY ONE I CAN REMEMBER. 

478
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,234
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN OTHERS, FOR 

479
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:16,435
SURE. 

480
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,102
>> NANCY, CAN YOU RECALL UNDER 

481
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,002
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES A SUPREME 

482
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:23,474
COURT NOMINEE HAS REMOVED THEIR 

483
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:24,609
NAME OR HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED? 

484
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,109
>> Reporter: WITHDRAWN? 

485
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,310
SURE. 

486
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:38,190
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. 

487
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,491
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES LIKE 

488
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,126
HARRIET MYERS HAVE WITHDRAWN 

489
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:41,993
THEMSELVES FROM CONSIDERATION 

490
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,028
FOR FAR LESS EXPLOSIVE REASONS. 

491
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,864
>> A GREAT POINT. 

492
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,633
I DON'T REMEMBER HOW ROBERT 

493
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,800
BORK -- HOW HE WAS REMOVED FROM 

494
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,868
THE NOMINATING PROCESS BUT I 

495
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:55,774
KNOW THERE WAS LOT OF QUESTIONS 

496
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,876
ABOUT HIS BELIEFS AND HIS 

497
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,278
INTERPRETATION OF THE 

498
00:17:59,278 --> 00:17:59,611
CONSTITUTION. 

499
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,245
I DON'T RECALL ANYBODY EVER 

500
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,079
HAVING ALLEGATIONS AS EXPLOSIVE 

501
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,747
AS THESE. 

502
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:08,153
PERHAPS THERE WERE? 

503
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,355
>> I WONDER IF WE ARE NOW 

504
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,223
PERMANENTLY CHANGING THIS 

505
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:11,490
PROCESS. 

506
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,259
NANCY, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FBI 

507
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,128
VETTING PROCESS AND IT PROBABLY 

508
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,296
DIDN'T INCLUDE WHAT YOU DID IN 

509
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:19,064
HIGH SCHOOL. 

510
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,932
>> PEOPLE ON TWITTER ARE 

511
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:23,502
SUGGESTING THAT THE FBI DOESN'T 

512
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,870
ACTUALLY LOOK AT STUFF BEFORE 

513
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,437
YOU ARE 18. 

514
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,905
>> NANCY, COULD WE BE SEEING A 

515
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:30,442
CHANGE HERE? 

516
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,843
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH DECIDES HE 

517
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:32,878
DOESN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS 

518
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,879
PROCESS AND REMOVES HIS NAME, 

519
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:39,651
THE NEXT PERSON CHOSEN, I'M 

520
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,254
SURE, WILL LOOK BACK TO THEIR 

521
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,155
HIGH SCHOOL CAREER, IF YOU CAN 

522
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:44,823
CALL IT THAT. 

523
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,924
THEY WILL FIGURE OUT ANY 

524
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:47,993
MISDEEDS THEY MIGHT HAVE 

525
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:48,393
PARTICIPATED IN. 

526
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,428
IS THIS A PERMANENT CHANGE IN 

527
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,461
HOW SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE 

528
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,266
CHOSEN? 

529
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:58,237
IT DOES MATTER WHAT YOU DID AT 

530
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:58,870
17 FROM NOW ON? 

531
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,938
>> Reporter: THIS IS A VERY 

532
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:00,706
PARTICULAR SITUATION AND I'M 

533
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,708
SURE HE WAS ASKED, EVEN BEFORE 

534
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:10,282
FORMALLY VETTED BY THE FBI, 

535
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,084
WHENEVER HE SPOKE TO THE WHITE 

536
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,052
HOUSE, I'M SURE THEY ASKED IF 

537
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,455
THERE WAS ANYTHING IN HIS 

538
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,290
BACKGROUND THAT WOULD BE 

539
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,623
EMBARRASSING. 

540
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,092
THAT IS SORT OF LIKE THE BASIC 

541
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:20,592
INTRODUCTORY QUESTION. 

542
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,093
ANY SURPRISES IN YOUR 

543
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:21,393
BACKGROUND? 

544
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:27,299
THERE MIGHT BE SOME PEOPLE, 

545
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,067
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE A 

546
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,937
TEENAGER, THEY MAY BE RELUCTANT 

547
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,005
FOR THIS REASON TO SUBJECT 

548
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,871
THEMSELVES TO SCRUTINY. 

549
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:35,073
THEY MIGHT SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, 

550
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,475
I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH 

551
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:41,246
IT. 

552
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,748
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS ONE CASE 

553
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:43,582
IS REPRESENTATIVE OF A WHOLE 

554
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:50,489
SEA CHANGE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

555
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,291
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES ALL THAT 

556
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,960
OFTEN AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 

557
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,393
THEM IS DIFFERENT. 

558
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,996
LOOK AT NEIL GORSUCH, JUST LAST 

559
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,196
YEAR. 

560
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,164
HE ALSO WENT TO GEORGETOWN PREP 

561
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,899
AND IS PRETTY CLOSE IN AGE TO 

562
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,101
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

563
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,437
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY LOOKED AT 

564
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,239
HIS HIGH SCHOOL BACKGROUND BUT 

565
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,275
NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO SAID HE 

566
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,845
HAD -- TO SAY HE HAD DONE 

567
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:14,278
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 

568
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,147
EVERY NOMINEE IS DIFFERENT AND 

569
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,248
A CHARGE OF SHOPLIFTING WHEN 

570
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,851
YOU ARE A TEENAGER, AS SOME 

571
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,453
BACKGROUND CHECKS MIGHT TURN 

572
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,222
UP, IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN A 

573
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:23,789
CHARGE OF GANG RAPE. 

574
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,057
>> JULIE, YOU WANTED TO CHIME 

575
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:31,763
IN ON THAT? 

576
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,666
>> WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE 

577
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,501
TYPICAL 17-YEAR-OLD BEHAVIOR, I 

578
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:36,734
ASSUME. 

579
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:38,837
HE'S NOT ACCUSED, AS YOU SAID, 

580
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:39,904
OF SIMPLE SHOPLIFTING. 

581
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,074
MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY I WAS 

582
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,742
YOUNG AND MADE A STUPID 

583
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,009
MISTAKE. 

584
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,010
HIS BEHAVIOR, IF WE BELIEVE IT 

585
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,478
TO BE TRUE IS SO INCREDIBLY 

586
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:52,084
ABHORRENT AND SO AGAINST 

587
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,218
EVERYTHING THAT WE SHOULD BE 

588
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,555
BELIEVING IN IN TERMS OF WHO OUR

589
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:57,789
JUSTICE IS. 

590
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,691
REMEMBER, HE WILL MAKE 

591
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,526
DECISIONS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF 

592
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,461
WOMEN AS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 

593
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,295
WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT AND 

594
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:03,996
COULDN'T EVER IGNORE THAT. 

595
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:10,268
THE THING IS THAT IF HE HAS 

596
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:11,570
DONE THESE THINGS, THEY ARE SO 

597
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,404
INCREDIBLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT IT 

598
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,638
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO 

599
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,141
SIT AS A SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 

600
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,908
OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE LITTLE 

601
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,976
THINGS THAT THEY HAVE DONE THAT 

602
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:24,282
WOULDN'T BE RELEVANT TO A 

603
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:24,649
DECISION-MAKER. 

604
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:25,917
>> TO POINT OUT, THESE ARE 

605
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,885
ALLEGATIONS AND CBS NEWS HAS 

606
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,752
NOT CONFIRMED THESE 

607
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:31,323
ALLEGATIONS. 

608
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,591
>> WE ARE SEEING A NOTE AND 

609
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:38,130
NANCY, YOU'VE SEEN THIS, WE WILL

610
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,665
RELAY IT TO THE VIEWERS. 

611
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,834
IT SUCKED -- IT COMES FROM THE 

612
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,602
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMUNICATIONS 

613
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:43,868
DIRECTOR. 

614
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,270
THIS MORNING, MICHAEL AVENATTI 

615
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,671
PROVIDED A DECLARATION TO THE 

616
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,907
COMMITTEE AND LAWYERS ARE IN 

617
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,908
THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING IT, 

618
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:51,109
NOW. 

619
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,078
AS ANNE-MARIE POINTS OUT, THESE 

620
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,680
ARE ALLEGATIONS BUT OUR VIEWERS 

621
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,783
ARE JUST TUNING IN TO CBSN 

622
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,950
RIGHT WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO 

623
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,651
THE TOP OF THE HOUR. 

624
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,952
IT'S THE NEWS THAT MICHAEL 

625
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:05,557
AVENATTI HAD BEEN SUGGESTING ALL

626
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,260
WEEK LONG THAT HE WAS GOING TO 

627
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,027
PROVIDE TO THE SENATE JUDICIARY 

628
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,195
COMMITTEE AND TO THE MEDIA, IS 

629
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,329
OF THIS THIRD ACCUSER ACCUSING 

630
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,397
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 

631
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:21,306
KAVANAUGH OF EXPLOSIVE INSTANCES

632
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,642
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, 

633
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:23,975
ESSENTIALLY. 

634
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,844
I'M GOING TO READ FROM THE 

635
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,279
AFFIDAVIT, THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT 

636
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,980
THAT IS PROVIDED TO MR. 

637
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,748
AVENATTI AND THAT MR. AVENATTI 

638
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,648
HAS PROVIDED TO THE PRESS. 

639
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:36,788
IN ONE OF THOSE PARAGRAPHS, AND 

640
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,357
WHAT I'M READING, IT WOULD BE 

641
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,325
CONSIDERED THE LEAST VOLATILE 

642
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:40,926
OR EXPLOSIVE OF THE 

643
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:41,259
ALLEGATIONS. 

644
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,694
TO POINT OUT WHY THERE WERE SO 

645
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,466
MANY CONCERNED THAT MR. 

646
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,067
KAVANAUGH WOULD BE GIVEN A 

647
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,068
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE 

648
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,003
SUPREME COURT AND WOULD HAVE 

649
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,004
THE POWER AND DECISION-MAKING 

650
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,806
OVER THE LIVES OF 400 MILLION 

651
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,341
AMERICANS, INCLUDING WOMEN, 

652
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,209
OBVIOUSLY. 

653
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,444
OF ONE OF THE PARAGRAPH SHE 

654
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,879
STATES, FOLLOWING THE FIRST 

655
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,447
INTRODUCTION, I ATTENDED WELL 

656
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,216
OVER 10 HOUSE PARTIES IN THE 

657
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:04,850
WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA DURING 

658
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,951
1981-1983 WERE MARK JUDGE -- 

659
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:10,689
THE MEN WHO WAS BRETT 

660
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,390
KAVANAUGH'S FRIEND -- AND BRETT 

661
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,259
KAVANAUGH WERE PRESENT. 

662
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,727
THESE PARTIES WERE COMMON 

663
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,995
OCCURRENCES IN THE AREA. 

664
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,497
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS I 

665
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,031
WITNESSED MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 

666
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,299
KAVANAUGH DRINK EXCESSIVELY AND 

667
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,133
ENGAGE IN HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE 

668
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,069
CONDUCT INCLUDING BEING OVERLY 

669
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,569
AGGRESSIVE WITH GIRLS. 

670
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,405
NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. 

671
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,241
THIS CONDUCT INCLUDED THE 

672
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,709
FONDLING AND GRABBING OF GIRLS 

673
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,143
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. I 

674
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,246
OBSERVED BRETT KAVANAUGH DRINK 

675
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,380
EXCESSIVELY AT MANY OF THESE 

676
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,781
PARTIES AND ENGAGE IN ABUSIVE 

677
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,617
AND FIGURES LIKELY AGGRESSIVE 

678
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,951
BEHAVIOR TOWARD GIRLS INCLUDING 

679
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,221
PRESS AND GIRLS AGAINST THEM 

680
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,289
WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, GRINDING 

681
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:44,956
AGAINST GIRLS AND ATTEMPTING TO 

682
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,324
REMOVE OR SHIFT THEIR CLOTHING 

683
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:51,997
TO EXPOSE PRIVATE BODY PARTS. 

684
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,665
HE SPOKE ABOUT GIRLS DEMEANING 

685
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:56,868
ONLY IN GENERAL AND BY NAME AND 

686
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,537
I WITNESSED HIM BEHAVE AS A 

687
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,672
MEAN DRUNK ON MANY OCCASIONS AT 

688
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,706
THESE PARTIES. 

689
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,908
THAT IS THE SEVENTH PARAGRAPH 

690
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,308
AND IT GOES ON. 

691
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:07,479
>> JUST TO INTERJECT, PART OF 

692
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,081
THE REASON THAT THESE ARE THE 

693
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,683
LEAST EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS OR 

694
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,752
WHY THEY ARE STILL IMPORTANT IS 

695
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,420
BECAUSE THEY DIRECTLY 

696
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,721
CONTRADICT WHAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 

697
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:18,156
SAID IN HIS FOX NEWS INTERVIEW 

698
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,525
AND WHAT HIS FRIEND MARK JUDGE 

699
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,426
SAID WHO DISMISSED THE 

700
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,127
RELATIONSHIP AND SAID HE HAD 

701
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:25,464
NEVER REALLY SEEN BRETT 

702
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,164
KAVANAUGH AT THESE PARTIES 

703
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:26,865
BEHAVING IN THIS WAY. 

704
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,699
IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS IT. 

705
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,068
>> I THINK WE HAVE HIM ON THE 

706
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,638
RECORD IN THAT FOX NEWS 

707
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,639
INTERVIEW SUGGESTING THAT HE IS 

708
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,241
ESSENTIALLY A CHOIR BOY. 

709
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:39,077
HE WENT TO CHURCH AND HUNG OUT 

710
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,312
WITH HIS PARENTS. 

711
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,682
DID YOU AGREE WITH RIKKI 

712
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,949
KLEIMAN'S TAKE THAT THIS WAS AN 

713
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:45,884
ILL-ADVISED INTERVIEW? 

714
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:46,484
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

715
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,020
AS AN ATTORNEY, YOU TELL YOUR 

716
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,922
CLIENT NOT TO SAY A WORD 

717
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,924
BECAUSE ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN BE 

718
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,626
USED AGAINST YOU. 

719
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,594
EVEN THINGS YOU THINK ARE 

720
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,028
INNOCENT OR WILL MAKE YOU BE 

721
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,131
BETRAYED AS SOMEONE AS A CHOIR 

722
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,500
BOY, IT MAY COME BACK TO HAUNT 

723
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,237
YOU BECAUSE NOW, A, YOU HAVE 

724
00:25:06,237 --> 00:25:07,305
THE ABILITY TO CROSS-EXAMINE ON 

725
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,373
THINGS YOU SAID BEFORE AND NOW, 

726
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:08,806
OTHER WITNESSES ARE 

727
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:09,374
SPECIFICALLY CONTRADICTING 

728
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,977
THINGS HE SAID IN THAT 

729
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,913
INTERVIEW, IN AND OF ITSELF. 

730
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:20,218
YES, INCREDIBLY EVEN MORE 

731
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:26,625
DIFFICULT FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY 

732
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,659
IF THERE ARE GOOD CROSS-EXAMINE 

733
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:31,029
HER'S IN THERE. 

734
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,899
>> JULIE AND NANCY, PLEASE STAND

735
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,065
BY. 

736
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:34,966
WE HAVE A CRIMINAL DEFENSE 

737
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:35,800
ATTORNEY AND FORMER PROSECUTOR 

738
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,067
WITH US. 

739
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:36,601
YOU ARE REPRESENTING AND 

740
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:43,608
LOOKING AT THIS INFORMATION AND 

741
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,410
LOOKING AT THIS AFFIDAVIT. 

742
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,312
AS A PROSECUTOR, AND A CRIMINAL 

743
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:47,912
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, YOU HAVE TO 

744
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:48,546
REPRESENT MR. KAVANAUGH. 

745
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:52,350
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 

746
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,551
>> FIRST, THE TIMING IS 

747
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,953
SUSPECT. 

748
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,554
I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 

749
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:00,926
THAT. 

750
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,460
THESE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN GOING 

751
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,030
ON FOR A WHILE AND IS NOT THE 

752
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,997
FIRST TIME JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS 

753
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:06,665
BEEN BEFORE THE SENATE. 

754
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,934
HE WAS UP FOR THE CONFIRMATION 

755
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:13,037
PROCESS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT. 

756
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:16,474
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM 

757
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:16,874
THAT PERSPECTIVE. 

758
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,843
THAT BEING SAID, IN TERMS OF 

759
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:19,911
THE AMOUNT -- NOW, THE NUMBER 

760
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,079
OF ACCUSATIONS, THREE SEPARATE 

761
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:27,485
ACCUSES -- AND BECAUSE OF THE 

762
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:28,286
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ALLEGATION, 

763
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,354
I THINK IT WARRANTS AN 

764
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,388
INVESTIGATION AND A DELAY IN 

765
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,756
THE PROCESS, FOR THIS TO BE 

766
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:37,362
FULLY VETTED. 

767
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,597
PEOPLE HAVE TO STILL RESPECT 

768
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,099
KAVANAUGH AND SAY, THE GUY HAS 

769
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:41,832
TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT. 

770
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:42,566
IT'S THE BEDROCK OF OUR 

771
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:42,933
INSTITUTION. 

772
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,269
THESE OTHER THINGS, AT THIS 

773
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:49,607
POINT, THE TIMING AND THE FACT 

774
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,610
THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT STUFF

775
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,747
FROM 35 PLUS YEARS AGO, I THINK 

776
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,649
ALL OF THAT LEADS INTO THE 

777
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,016
TOTAL EQUATION. 

778
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,250
AT THIS POINT, IT HAS TO MERIT 

779
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,318
AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE WE ARE 

780
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:04,356
TALKING ABOUT THE U.S. SUPREME 

781
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:04,589
COURT. 

782
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,958
>> I'VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THIS 

783
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:07,859
TACTIC OF THE SUPPORTERS 

784
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,227
INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 

785
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:09,861
AND THESE ARE ALLEGATIONS FROM 

786
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,163
35 YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE 

787
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,199
TEENAGERS. 

788
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,534
ALL OF US, ANY REASONABLE 

789
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,169
PERSON WOULD SAY THAT WHEN YOU 

790
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,438
ARE A CHILD, WHICH IS WHAT YOU 

791
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,308
ARE BEFORE YOU ARE 18, YOU DO 

792
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:23,675
STUPID THINGS. 

793
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,543
NOT ALL OF US WOULD SUGGEST 

794
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,046
THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT 

795
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,914
ARE ALLEGED ARE TYPICAL OF AN 

796
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,850
AMERICAN OR ANYBODY IN WHATEVER 

797
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,852
COUNTRY, BUT I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS 

798
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,286
ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IT HAPPENED 

799
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:35,653
35 YEARS AGO. 

800
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:36,320
SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP THE POINT 

801
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,426
THAT WHEN VICTIMS OF PRIESTS 

802
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,961
WHO SEXUALLY ABUSE CHILDREN 

803
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,229
FINALLY COME TO GRIPS AND ARE 

804
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,162
WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD 

805
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,564
WITH ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY MAY 

806
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,602
HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATELY 

807
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,437
AGGRESS BY A PRIEST, WE DON'T 

808
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,006
SAY THIS HAPPENED WHEN YOU ARE 

809
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,642
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 10, 11, SO 

810
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,575
THEY CAN'T BE TRUE. 

811
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:01,045
PROSECUTORS TAKE THIS AND TRY 

812
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:02,981
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. 

813
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,882
>> HERE IS THE THING. 

814
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:06,885
WHETHER SOMETHING HAPPENS 35 

815
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,853
YEARS AGO OR YESTERDAY, AS A 

816
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,923
PROSECUTOR, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT 

817
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,725
EACH SPECIFIC CASE AND MAKE A 

818
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,592
DETERMINATION AS TO THE 

819
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,493
CREDIBILITY. 

820
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,661
YOU CAN HAVE SOMETHING WHO SAID 

821
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,163
SOMETHING ELSE AND THEY ARE 

822
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,932
LYING ABOUT IT. 

823
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:21,733
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE TO 

824
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:28,239
CONSIDER WHY IT IS AND IF THE 

825
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,874
VICTIMS GIVE A VALID AND 

826
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,210
CREDIBLE REASON AS TO WHY THEY 

827
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,077
DIDN'T COME FORWARD, THEN IT 

828
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:33,778
REALLY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. 

829
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,650
KEEP IN MIND THAT WE DID LIVE 

830
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,851
IN A DIFFERENT TIME 35 YEARS 

831
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:40,051
AGO. 

832
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,219
SOME OF THIS BEHAVIOR WAS 

833
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,757
EITHER ACCEPTABLE OR -- 

834
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,025
REMEMBER -- IF YOU WERE A WOMAN 

835
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:51,996
ATTACKED BY THESE YOUNG MEN, 

836
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,866
THEY HAVE AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OF 

837
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:55,066
BOYS. 

838
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,835
AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED, 

839
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:00,038
IT STOOD BEHIND THEM AND IT 

840
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,272
MADE IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO 

841
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,006
STEP FORWARD. 

842
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:02,873
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRESUMPTION 

843
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,442
OF INNOCENCE, THIS IS NOT A 

844
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:04,842
CRIMINAL TRIAL. 

845
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:11,983
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE 

846
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:12,851
THINGS, IT'S NOT BEYOND A 

847
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:13,685
REASONABLE DOUBT SITUATION, IT 

848
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:18,256
IS IF THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE

849
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,925
IF HE SHOULD BE A SUPREME COURT 

850
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,062
JUDGE. 

851
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,264
WE ARE TELLING HIM HE CAN'T 

852
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,933
SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT 

853
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,236
MAKES DECISIONS FOR THE REST OF 

854
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,804
HIS LIFE AND THAT'S THE 

855
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:33,104
DIFFERENCE. 

856
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,606
>> SOME THINGS THAT WERE 

857
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,640
INTERESTING, ONE THING TO 

858
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,743
CONSIDER IS THAT IT WAS A 

859
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:39,611
DIFFERENT TIME. I 

860
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,780
WANT TO ASK NANCY ABOUT THE 

861
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,581
FACT THAT WE ARE IN THE #METOO 

862
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,349
MOVEMENT ERA. 

863
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,484
BILL COSBY IS GOING TO JAIL FOR 

864
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,452
SEVERAL YEARS AND SPENT THE 

865
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,253
NIGHT IN PRISON AND THE 

866
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:56,961
ACCUSATION IS THAT HE DRUGGED 

867
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,561
WOMEN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

868
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:58,396
THEM AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS CAME 

869
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,130
UP BEFORE THIS ERA. 

870
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,231
IT'S ONLY NOW THAT THEY WERE 

871
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,332
ABLE TO PROSECUTE AND CONVICT 

872
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:06,137
HIM. 

873
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,206
HO DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HOW THE 

874
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,007
#METOO MOVEMENT AND THE ARROW 

875
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,108
WE ARE IN FACTORS INTO WHAT'S 

876
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,945
HAPPENING WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH? 

877
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,246
>> I THINK IT IS A HUGE FACTOR, 

878
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,615
THE FACT THAT SO MANY DEMOCRATS 

879
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:25,256
AND SOME REPUBLICANS SAID FROM 

880
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,158
THE OUTSET THAT EVEN AFTER JUST 

881
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,059
ONE WOMAN CAME FORWARD, I 

882
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,494
BELIEVE HER OR I THINK WE NEED 

883
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,761
TO EXPLORE WHAT SHE IS SAYING. 

884
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:38,603
IF YOU THINK BACK 20 YEARS AGO 

885
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,337
AND EITHER PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 

886
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,205
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS OR EVEN 

887
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,540
FURTHER BACK WHEN HE WAS ACCUSED

888
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,345
OF LEWD BEHAVIOR BY WOMEN IN 

889
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,079
HIS PAST, DEMOCRATS DIDN'T WANT 

890
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,147
TO BELIEVE IT AND SO THEY 

891
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:49,781
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT. 

892
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:57,121
BY AND LARGE THEY CHOSE TO 

893
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,456
BELIEVE HIM OVER THE ACCUSERS 

894
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,223
AND THEY LOOKED FOR VARIOUS 

895
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,291
REASONS AS TO WHY THESE WOMEN 

896
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,528
WERE NOT RELIABLE. 

897
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,696
THAT STILL HAPPENS, BUT THE 

898
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,663
OVERWHELMING PRESUMPTION, NOW, 

899
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,733
IS THAT IT IS VERY PAINFUL FOR 

900
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,935
WOMEN TO COME FORWARD AND IF 

901
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:17,342
THEY ARE COMING FORWARD, IT'S 

902
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,042
NOT OPEN AND SHUT. 

903
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,580
THEY DESERVE TO BE HEARD 

904
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,849
BECAUSE THERE IS A VERY STRONG 

905
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,017
CHANCE THAT THERE IS AT LEAST 

906
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:26,851
SOMETHING TO WHAT THEY ARE 

907
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,084
SAYING. 

908
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:31,422
CERTAINLY, WHEN YOU HEAR FROM 

909
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,190
MORE WOMEN, THAT MAKES EACH 

910
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,424
WOMAN EVEN MORE BELIEVABLE. 

911
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:39,664
I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH WHAT A 

912
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,066
VOLATILE SITUATION WE ARE NOW 

913
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,232
IN. 

914
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:46,504
ON MONDAY, A LOT OF US CAME TO 

915
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,139
WORK HALF EXPECTING THAT, 

916
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,840
PERHAPS, KAVANAUGH WOULD BE 

917
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,843
WITHDRAWING BECAUSE OF THE 

918
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,311
ACCUSATIONS THAT HAD ALREADY 

919
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:53,644
BEEN LEVELED. 

920
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:54,445
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND HE AND 

921
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,213
REPUBLICANS DOUBLED DOWN. 

922
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,380
NOW, NOW THAT THESE NEW 

923
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:05,990
ALLEGATIONS -- VERY DISTURBING 

924
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,657
ALLEGATIONS -- HAVE BEEN MADE, 

925
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:07,357
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. 

926
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:08,660
CHUCK GRASSLEY COULD COME OUT 

927
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,165
AT ANY MOMENT AND SAY THE 

928
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,934
HEARING IS POSTPONED. 

929
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,135
THEY ARE OPENING AN 

930
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,102
INVESTIGATION -- YOU KNOW -- 

931
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,936
HE'S CONFERRING WITH REPUBLICAN 

932
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:19,503
LEADERSHIP, ANYTHING COULD 

933
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:20,505
HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

934
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:24,675
HOURS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE 

935
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:30,481
BIG HEARING THAT WE ALL EXPECT 

936
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,482
TO HAPPEN TOMORROW THAT WILL 

937
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,183
LAST THE ENTIRE DAY. 

938
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:36,020
BRETT KAVANAUGH COULD ANNOUNCE 

939
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,056
THAT HE IS TAKING A STEP BACK 

940
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,158
IN LIGHT OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

941
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,259
THEY DOUBLED DOWN ON MONDAY AND 

942
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,629
MAYBE THEY'VE PLAYED THAT CARD. 

943
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,697
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T, BUT I 

944
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:47,465
GUARANTEE YOU THESE 

945
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,033
CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE 

946
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,568
IN A FAST AND FURIOUS MANNER 

947
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,869
ACROSS HIS CAPITAL AND BETWEEN 

948
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,837
THE LEADER'S OFFICE IN THE 

949
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,038
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. 

950
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,141
>> NANCY, I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT

951
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,075
TO GO. 

952
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:59,844
TELL YOUR PRODUCER, JOHN NOLAN, 

953
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,345
THAT WE ARE SORRY WE KEPT YOU 

954
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:03,915
HERE SO LONG. 

955
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,249
YOU PROVIDED A WEALTH OF 

956
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:05,582
INFORMATION. 

957
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:06,551
JOHN AND NANCY, I HAVE ONE 

958
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:06,918
FINAL QUESTION. 

959
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:14,225
YOU TALKED ABOUT BILL COSBY AND 

960
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,627
THE ERA OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT 

961
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,662
AND THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST MR. 

962
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,964
COSBY HAPPENED BEFORE THE ME, 

963
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,899
TOO CONFIRMATION -- THE ME, TOO 

964
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:22,099
ERA. 

965
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,234
THE CLARENCE THOMAS 

966
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,502
CONFIRMATION WAS WELL BEFORE 

967
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,536
THE #METOO MOVEMENT. 

968
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,605
ANITA HILL SAID THE SENATE 

969
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,239
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STILL LACKS 

970
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,141
A PROTOCOL FOR VETTING SEXUAL 

971
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,442
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT CLAIMS 

972
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,977
THAT SURFACED DURING A 

973
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,879
CONFIRMATION HEARING AND IT 

974
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,481
SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE LEARNED 

975
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,982
LITTLE FROM THE THOMAS HEARING, 

976
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,017
MUCH LESS THE MORE RECENT #METOO

977
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:40,284
MOVEMENT. 

978
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,352
WHY HAS THE SENATE DELAYED THIS 

979
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,188
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS? 

980
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,124
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

981
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,492
HOPE THAT NO MATTER HOW IT 

982
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,092
HAPPENS, THAT THEY WILL NOT 

983
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:48,925
FURTHER DO THAT. 

984
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:56,000
>> NANCY, FOR THE ANITA HILL 

985
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,968
SITUATION, THERE WAS AN FBI 

986
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:57,568
INVESTIGATION BUT HAVE THESE 

987
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:58,436
THINGS MOVED BACKWARDS? 

988
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:02,206
>> Reporter: FIRST OF ALL, THE 

989
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,607
SENATE DELAYS ON ALL KINDS OF 

990
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:08,346
THINGS. 

991
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,781
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE 

992
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:11,849
SPECIFICALLY PUTTING THIS OFF, 

993
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:12,784
IT'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS. 

994
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,886
IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE SENATE 

995
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,120
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN INTENT ON 

996
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,353
USING TIME ON THE FLOOR TO 

997
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:26,330
CONFIRM AS MANY JUDGES AS 

998
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,232
POSSIBLE BEFORE THE MIDTERM 

999
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,033
ELECTIONS. 

1000
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,168
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH 

1001
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,135
EXTRANEOUS LEGISLATION GO TO 

1002
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,735
THE SENATE FLOOR LIKE 

1003
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:32,603
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CHANGE 

1004
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:36,239
THE RULE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

1005
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,708
REPORTING IN CONGRESS. 

1006
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,177
THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP A 

1007
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,712
COUPLE OF DAYS ON THE SENATE 

1008
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:42,780
FLOOR THAT THEY COULD BE USING 

1009
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,181
TO CONFIRM ANOTHER CONSERVATIVE 

1010
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:48,920
JUDGE. 

1011
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,755
THEY WANT TO GET AS MUCH OF 

1012
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,356
THAT DONE RIGHT NOW AS THEY 

1013
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,024
CAN. 

1014
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,360
BEYOND THAT, THERE IS A BIT OF 

1015
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,431
SELF PROTECTION GOING ON AND 

1016
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,365
THE WORRY THAT THEY WILL 

1017
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,633
SOMEHOW GIVE UP TOO MUCH POWER 

1018
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:08,873
FOR WOMEN AND MEN THAT MIGHT 

1019
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,142
REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY A 

1020
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,877
COLLEAGUE OR EVEN BY A MEMBER 

1021
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,346
OF CONGRESS. 

1022
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,447
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT FALSE 

1023
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:21,752
REPORTS THAT CAN CREATE A 

1024
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,620
LASTING STAIN ON ONE'S 

1025
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:29,393
REPUTATION. 

1026
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,262
SIMPLY PUT, THERE ARE A LOT OF 

1027
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,230
SENATORS WHO HAVE PAID LIP 

1028
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,397
SERVICE TO THE NOTION OF 

1029
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,966
MODERNIZING THE RULES BUT IT IS 

1030
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:40,037
NOT SOMETHING THAT THERE IS A 

1031
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:42,106
LOT OF PASSION FOR, PARTICULARLY

1032
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,008
AMONG A LOT OF THE OLDER MALE 

1033
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:44,275
SENATORS. 

1034
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,610
>> NANCY CORDES, OUR CHIEF 

1035
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,410
CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT WHO 

1036
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,013
SPENT THE BETTER PART OF AN 

1037
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:50,414
HOUR WITH US BREAKING DOWN THE 

1038
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,616
EXPLOSIVE NEWS FROM ATTORNEY 

1039
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,650
MICHAEL AVENATTI, WE THANK YOU. 

1040
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,519
THANK JOHN NOLAN FOR US, AS 

1041
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,254
WELL. I 

1042
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,489
KNOW YOU HAVE SOME BUSY HOURS 

1043
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,691
AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE IT, 

1044
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:00,924
NANCY. 

1045
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:02,093
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. 

1046
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,861
>>> A FEW MOMENTS AGO, MICHAEL 

1047
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,163
AVENATTI WAS ON THE VIEW TALKING

1048
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,033
ABOUT THE NEW CLAIMS AND SAID 

1049
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,468
THAT HIS CLIENT IS READY TO 

1050
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:10,735
TESTIFY. 

1051
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,802
>> SHE IS WILLING TO TESTIFY 

1052
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:16,340
AND WILLING TO MEET WITH THE FBI

1053
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,743
FORTH WITH, IMMEDIATELY, TO 

1054
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,343
DESCRIBE WHAT SHE WITNESSED. 

1055
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,011
SHE IS PREPARED TO PROVIDE 

1056
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:20,811
ADDITIONAL CORROBORATING 

1057
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,881
WITNESS NAMES TO THE FBI 

1058
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,448
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT 

1059
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,149
INVESTIGATION AND WE ARE 

1060
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,417
HOPEFUL THAT THE COMMITTEE IS 

1061
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:34,425
GOING TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY BY 

1062
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:35,492
CALLING FOR AN FBI 

1063
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:35,859
INVESTIGATION. 

1064
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,795
ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS CAN 

1065
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,397
THEN BE PROPERLY VETTED AND THE 

1066
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,431
TRUTH CAN BE KNOWN. 

1067
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,832
>> ONE OF THE JUDICIARY 

1068
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,668
COMMITTEE DOES NOT RESPOND AND 

1069
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,835
SAY THEY ARE GOING AHEAD WITH 

1070
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,738
THE PLAN, WHICH IS TO HEAR THE 

1071
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,973
TWO OF THEM TOMORROW AND THEN 

1072
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:49,873
VOTE ON FRIDAY? 

1073
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,476
WHAT HAPPENS THEN? 

1074
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,178
>> WELL, WE HAVE A COUPLE OF 

1075
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,713
OPTIONS AND I WANT TO EXPOSE 

1076
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,047
WHAT THEY ARE AT THIS POINT IN 

1077
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:57,248
TIME. 

1078
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:01,652
WE HAVE PLANNED FOR THAT AND I 

1079
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,055
WILL TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT 

1080
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,189
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS 

1081
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,290
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. 

1082
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,491
THERE SHOULD BE NO RUSH TO 

1083
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,693
CONFIRM THIS MAN TO THE U.S. 

1084
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:09,060
SUPREME COURT. 

1085
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,163
DELAYING THIS MATTER A WEEK OR 

1086
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:14,131
MONTH OR SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A 

1087
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,566
MONTH WOULD BE OF NO 

1088
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:15,899
CONSEQUENCE. 

1089
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:17,168
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

1090
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,738
GET THIS RIGHT, 100% RIGHT, 

1091
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,106
BEFORE A VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE 

1092
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:29,180
CONFIRMATION FOR A LIFETIME TO 

1093
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 

1094
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,716
>> THAT WAS ATTORNEY MICHAEL 

1095
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:34,819
AVENATTI APPEARING ON THE VIEW 

1096
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,219

OTHERS TO CAUSE GIRLS TO BECOME

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:31,175
THEY COULD BE GANG RAPED IN A

00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
PARTIES WAITING FOR THEIR TURN 

1139
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,286

THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE 

1147

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

1148
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,510

1149
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,411

00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,051
IT SAYS, QUOTE, SOMETIMES I HAD 

1153
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:14,518
TOO MANY. 

1154
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,554
IN RETROSPECT I SAID AND DONE 

1155
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,089
THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT MAKE 

1156
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,524
ME CRINGE NOW BUT THAT'S NOT 

1157
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,726
WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY. 

1158
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,562
WHAT I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF IS 

1159
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,362
FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN JUVENILE 

1160
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:25,695
MISBEHAVIOR. 

1161
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:26,329
I NEVER DID ANYTHING REMOTELY 

1162
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,064
RESEMBLING WHAT DR. FORD 

1163
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,732

VINOO VARGHESE. 

1168
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:46,617
FIRST, TO JULIE -- LET'S RESET 

1169
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,285
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR FOR OUR 

1170
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,353
VIEWERS. I 

1171
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,188
JUST READ ONE OF THE MORE 

1172
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,524
EXPLOSIVE ALLEGATIONS BY MS. 

1173
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,693
SWETNICK IN THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT 

1174
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,027
AND NOW WE HAVE THE PREPARED 

1175
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:57,661
WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF BRETT 

1176
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:57,961
KAVANAUGH. 

1177
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:58,795
HE'S ONLY ADDRESSING DR. FORD'S 

1178
00:39:58,795 --> 00:39:59,663
ALLEGATIONS. 

1179
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,633
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHERE THIS 

1180
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:09,440
GOES? 

1181
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,175
>> THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK 

1182
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,744
IS THAT IF YOU BELIEVE 

1183
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,514
KAVANAUGH, IF YOU ARE ONE OF HIS

1184
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,715
SUPPORTERS, WHAT'S WRONG WITH 

1185
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,315
DOING A FURTHER INVESTIGATION 

1186
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,450
TO VET THE TRUTHFULNESS OF 

1187
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,586
THESE WITNESSES? 

1188
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,222
IF THE POINT IS TO TRY TO 

1189
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,558
GARNER THE TRUTH AND GET TO 

1190
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,828
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS, IN 

1191
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,595
FACT, CORROBORATION OF THE 

1192
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,530
WITNESS -- I'M SORRY -- THREE 

1193
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,730
WITNESSES -- NOW IS THE TIME TO 

1194
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:38,369
TAKE THE TIME TO DO A THOROUGH 

1195
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:38,936
INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE 

1196
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,769
WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE, IN 

1197
00:40:39,769 --> 00:40:48,612
FACT, OTHER WITNESSES AS THIS 

1198
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,313
NEW VICTIM HAS SAID. 

1199
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:51,648
WITNESSES OR INDIVIDUALS MAY 

1200
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:53,017
HAVE WITNESSED OTHER 

1201
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,051
INDIVIDUALS EITHER BEING 

1202
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,252
ASSAULTED OR VERBALLY ABUSED OR 

1203
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,220
ANY OF THOSE THINGS. 

1204
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,821
WHAT REASON IN THE WORLD WITH A 

1205
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,524
NOT PUT THIS ON HOLD? 

1206
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,826
>> I WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE 

1207
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:03,993
SOUND FRO MICHAEL AVENATTI. 

1208
00:41:03,993 --> 00:41:05,895
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 

1209
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:08,465
SERIOUSNESS OF MAKING AN 

1210
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:08,965
ACCUSATION LIKE THIS. 

1211
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:10,267
LET'S PLAY THAT SOUND. 

1212
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,670
>> SHE UNDERSTANDS THE MAGNITUDE

1213
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,638
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AND SHE 

1214
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,438
DOES NOT MAKE THEM LIGHTLY. 

1215
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:16,506
SHE HAS THOROUGHLY REVIEWED THE 

1216
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:20,878
DECLARATIONS AND GONE OVER IT 

1217
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,681
IN DETAIL AND SHE KNOWS EXACTLY 

1218
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,049
WHAT IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE 

1219
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:25,616
DECLARATION AND I'M LOOKING 

1220
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,785
FORWARD TO AN INVESTIGATORY 

1221
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,853
PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR THE 

1222
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:32,089
TRUTH TO BE KNOWN. 

1223
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,223
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DESERVES TO 

1224
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:34,925
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND ABOUT THE

1225
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:37,061
CHARACTER, ABOUT BRETT 

1226
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:37,361
KAVANAUGH. 

1227
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,831
LET ME ALSO SAY -- AND THEN I 

1228
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,167
HAVE TO RUN -- BUT THERE'S NO 

1229
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,134
EXCUSE, NO EXCUSE FOR THE 

1230
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:44,935
COMMITTEE AND FOR BRETT 

1231
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:49,640
KAVANAUGH NOT CALLING MARK JUDGE

1232
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,576
TO TESTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE. 

1233
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,378
THIS IS A MAN THAT IS ONE OF 

1234
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,913
THE CLOSEST FRIENDS OF BRETT 

1235
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,114
KAVANAUGH AT THE TIME. 

1236
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,216
AT ISSUE AND ALL YOU HAVE TO 

1237
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,418
KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE HIDING 

1238
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:01,618
HIM. 

1239
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:03,153
THEY ARE HIDING MARK JUDGE FROM 

1240
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,456
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I CAN 

1241
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,391
ASSURE YOU IF HE HAD POSITIVE 

1242
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,493
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THIS TIME 

1243
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,196
PERIOD AND POSITIVE THINGS TO 

1244
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,397
SAY ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 

1245
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,232
CONDUCT, WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY 

1246
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,366
HEARD FROM HIM. 

1247
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:17,868
>> VINOO VARGHESE, YOU ARE A 

1248
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,069
FORMER PROSECUTOR AND DEFENSE 

1249
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,905
ATTORNEY AND YOU'VE BEEN ON 

1250
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,005
BOTH SIDES OF THIS. 

1251
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:24,808
IN REGARDS TO MARK JUDGE, MY 

1252
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,677
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MARK 

1253
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,245
JUDGE MADE A STATEMENT IN THE 

1254
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,947
COMMITTEE DIDN'T THINK HE COULD 

1255
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:30,681
ADD VALUE TO HIS TESTIMONY, 

1256
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,516
THAT IT WOULDN'T ADD VALUE SO 

1257
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,318
THEY DIDN'T DEMAND THAT HE 

1258
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,654
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THEM BUT 

1259
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,722
NOW, WITH ALL OF THESE 

1260
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,157
ACCUSATIONS, DO YOU AGREE WITH 

1261
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,291
MICHAEL AVENATTI THAT THEY'VE 

1262
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,428
GOT TO COUGH HIM UP AND MARK 

1263
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,128
JUDGE NEEDS TO PRESENT HIMSELF 

1264
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:47,097
FOR THE COMMITTEE? 

1265
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:50,801
>> I'M NOT SURE IF HE DOES OR 

1266
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,068
DOESN'T. 

1267
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,435
IT POTENTIALLY COULD BE 

1268
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:53,203
HELPFUL. 

1269
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:54,905
HE'S BEING NAMED. 

1270
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,240
IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL 

1271
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:56,573
TO KAVANAUGH. 

1272
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,808
I WOULD SAY THAT THE 

1273
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:04,181
ALLEGATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY SUCH 

1274
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:04,614
A HORRIBLE NATURE. 

1275
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:05,916
IT DOES WARRANT FURTHER 

1276
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,283
INVESTIGATION. 

1277
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,385
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT HAS 

1278
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,722
TO BE ORDERED BY THE PRESIDENT, 

1279
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,024
BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND IS AN 

1280
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,659
EXTENSION OF THE BACKGROUND 

1281
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,195
CHECK, AS AN INVESTIGATION BY 

1282
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,031
THE FBI AND WOULD BE A 

1283
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:21,999
CONTINUATION FROM THE 

1284
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,133
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ALREADY 

1285
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:23,366
HAPPEN. 

1286
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:23,933
IN TERMS OF THE ALLEGATION, 

1287
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,035
JUST BECAUSE MICHAEL AVENATTI 

1288
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:30,474
SAYS THAT HE SIGNS THIS 

1289
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,276
DECLARATION DOESN'T MAKE THE 

1290
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:32,676
DECLARATION TRUE. 

1291
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,945
JUST BECAUSE SHE SIGNED IT UNDER

1292
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,046
PENALTY OF PERJURY DOESN'T MAKE 

1293
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:36,312
IT TRUE. 

1294
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:37,147
UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAS NOT 

1295
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,081
BEEN SUBJECT TO CROSS-

1296
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:44,421
EXAMINATION AND SOMETHING JULIE 

1297
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,623
SAID EARLIER, SEVERAL MINUTES 

1298
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,092
AGO, WHILE THIS ISN'T A 

1299
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,793
CRIMINAL TRIAL, THE ALLEGATIONS 

1300
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,494
ARE CRIMINAL. 

1301
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,995
SO, IT'S MY BELIEF THAT IF YOU 

1302
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,163
ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON A 

1303
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:59,703
GUY OR DENY HIM A VOTE BECAUSE 

1304
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,206
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS, THEN 

1305
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,508
THESE NEED TO BE VETTED 

1306
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,309
PROPERLY AND HELD TO THE 

1307
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,110
HIGHEST STANDARDS UNDER THE 

1308
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,310
LAW. 

1309
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,912
THAT IS BEYOND A REASONABLE 

1310
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:09,346
DOUBT. 

1311
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,147
THESE ARE EXPLICIT ALLEGATIONS 

1312
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:19,256
AND YOU HAVE A MAN WHO HAS HAD 

1313
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:19,789
SIX DIFFERENT FBI CHECKS 

1314
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:20,056
RECENTLY. 

1315
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:20,891
WHEN THESE THINGS COME OUT AT 

1316
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:23,327
THE 11TH HOUR, THEY SHOULD BE 

1317
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,962
VETTED, AND VIEWED WITH 

1318
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,931
SUSPICION. 

1319
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:28,532
I THINK KAVANAUGH SHOULD 

1320
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:34,972
WELCOME AN FBI CHECK. 

1321
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,172
>> HOLD ON, ONE SECOND. 

1322
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:36,906
I JUST WANT TO -- 

1323
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:41,011
>> THE ALLEGATIONS CAN BE 

1324
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,280
PROVED TRUE THEN, AND THERE'S 

1325
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,282
NO WAY THEY COULD THEN BE PROVED

1326
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:45,816
FALSE. 

1327
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,752
>> I WANT TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE 

1328
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:49,586
BIT. 

1329
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:50,788
TWO THINGS. 

1330
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,488
THIS 11TH HOUR, WE SPOKE TO 

1331
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:53,157
NANCY. 

1332
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,424
THE 11TH HOUR IS UPON US 

1333
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:56,193
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE SENATE 

1334
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,127
DECREED IS THE 11TH HOUR. 

1335
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,395
THEY COULD TAKE THE TIME TO 

1336
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,563
INVESTIGATE THESE AS MANY 

1337
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,197
PEOPLE CALLED FOR. 

1338
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:07,137
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT

1339
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,774
A PERSON, A WOMAN, WOULD PUT 

1340
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,776
THESE ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE AND 

1341
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,546
NOT UNDERSTAND THE ENORMITY AND 

1342
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,514
THE RISKS INVOLVED. 

1343
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,483
GENERALLY, 70% OF WOMEN WHO WERE

1344
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,618
SEXUALLY ABUSED DO NOT EVER 

1345
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:21,918
REPORT IT. 

1346
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:23,487
THEY NEVER REPORT IT EVEN WHEN 

1347
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,354
FACED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

1348
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,757
DO SO AT MUCH LATER TIMES IN 

1349
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,592
THEIR LIFE. I 

1350
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,194
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL 

1351
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,895
THAT WE AREN'T SUGGESTING THAT 

1352
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,063
JUST BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING 

1353
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,364
WHEN IT HAPPENS THAT WE WOULD 

1354
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,600
SUGGEST THE ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT 

1355
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:36,800
TRUE. 

1356
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,268
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE CAN MAKE 

1357
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,704
THINGS UP AND THAT THERE ARE A 

1358
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:41,638
LOT OF POLITICS INVOLVED BUT 

1359
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,741
WHERE WE HAVE A TOWN WHERE WE 

1360
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,908
DON'T SUGGESTED BECAUSE IT'S 

1361
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,811
COMING OUT WHEN IT COMES OUT, 

1362
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:48,945
THAT IT SOMEHOW MEANS IT DIDN'T 

1363
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:50,581
HAPPEN OR THERE MIGHT BE SOME 

1364
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,583
LEVEL OF TRUTH? 

1365
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,986
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO QUESTION 

1366
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,222
THE STATEMENT AND RIP IT APART 

1367
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,156
AND WONDER ABOUT THE TIMING. 

1368
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:00,991
SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE HAD 

1369
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:01,758
AN UNDERSTANDING OR AWARENESS 

1370
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,059
THAT THERE WERE CRIMES TAKING 

1371
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:08,232
PLACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND 

1372
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:08,999
SHE ULTIMATELY BECAME A VICTIM 

1373
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,133
OF THAT CRIME BUT NEVER CAME 

1374
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:14,538
FORWARD AND THAT WILL BE ONE OF 

1375
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,973
THE QUESTIONS, AND I PRESUME 

1376
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:16,907
THAT YOU'VE BEEN A DEFENSE 

1377
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,375
ATTORNEY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE 

1378
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:21,845
QUESTIONS RAISED? 

1379
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:27,584
>> LET ME JUST SAY -- WHEN YOU 

1380
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:35,425
CITE STATISTICS LIKE THIS, YOU 

1381
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,193
SAY THEY ARE STATISTICS, HOW 

1382
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,329
COULD YOU PROVE WHEN IT 70% OF 

1383
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,632
WOMEN, WHEN YOU USE THE TERM 

1384
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:47,271
SEXUAL ASSAULT, THAT IS A TERM 

1385
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,405
DEFINED IN THE PENAL LAW OF 

1386
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:48,738
EACH STATE. 

1387
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:50,006
THE ONLY WAY TO PROVE IT 

1388
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:55,345
HAPPENED IS TO GO THROUGH THE 

1389
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:55,611
PROCESS. 

1390
00:46:55,611 --> 00:46:56,413
WHEN I SEE THE 11TH HOUR, THE 

1391
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:01,385
HEARINGS ENDED A WEEK AGO AND 

1392
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,586
I'M NOT GETTING INTO THE 

1393
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,754
POLITICS, BUT I DO BELIEVE THE 

1394
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:04,421
ALLEGATIONS ARE SO SERIOUS THAT 

1395
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,288
THEY REQUIRE FURTHER 

1396
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:08,958
INVESTIGATION AND THERE SHOULD 

1397
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,726
BE AN INVESTIGATION. 

1398
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:15,298
WHAT I'M SAYING IS FROM LOOKING 

1399
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:18,402
AT THIS, PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE A 

1400
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,137
STEP BACK AND SHOULD NOT 

1401
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,804
PRESUME THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 

1402
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:22,906
GUILTY. 

1403
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,074
THE NATURE OF THESE THINGS AND 

1404
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:24,908
WHY WE HAVE STATUTES OF 

1405
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:25,775
LIMITATION, WITNESSES 

1406
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:31,014
DISAPPEAR. 

1407
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,215
PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER AND 

1408
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,851
THAT IS WHY CRIMES NEED TO BE 

1409
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:35,118
REPORTED. 

1410
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,186
YOU CAN TAKE INTO EFFECT THAT 

1411
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,020
THIS NATURE, PEOPLE MAY NOT 

1412
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,388
REPORT IT RIGHT AWAY BUT THE 

1413
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:44,795
FACT THAT THE FIRST ACCUSER, 

1414
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,898
THAT SHE SPOKE TO HER THERAPIST 

1415
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,466
IN 2012, IT DOESN'T MEAN BRETT 

1416
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,968
KAVANAUGH DID THIS 35 YEARS 

1417
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:51,168
AGO. 

1418
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:52,336
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING I 

1419
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,939
WANT TO STRESS. 

1420
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,508
WE HAVE TO GIVE KAVANAUGH THE 

1421
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,509
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. 

1422
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,578
IT'S TO HIS BENEFIT TO HAVE THE 

1423
00:48:02,578 --> 00:48:03,946
FBI THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE. 

1424
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:07,417
THERE WON'T BE A WAY TO PROVE 

1425
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:08,184
OR DISPROVE THESE CLAIMS. 

1426
00:48:08,184 --> 00:48:09,753
YOU END UP WITH A STALEMATE 

1427
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,056
REQUIRING FURTHER 

1428
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,423
INVESTIGATION. 

1429
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,994
>> LET ME READ STATISTICS FROM 

1430
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,595
THE NATIONAL NETWORK WHEN IT 

1431
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,564
COMES TO REPORTS OF SEXUAL 

1432
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,399
VIOLENCE CRIMES AND WHY PEOPLE 

1433
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,833
GENERALLY DO NOT REPORT THEM. 

1434
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,235
THESE ARE THE REASONS. 

1435
00:48:26,235 --> 00:48:28,272
23% FEAR RETALIATION, 13% 

1436
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,673
BELIEVE THE POLICE WOULDN'T HELP

1437
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,809
AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN A PERSONAL 

1438
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,145
MATTER OR REPORTED TO A 

1439
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,612
DIFFERENT OFFICIAL OR THAT IT 

1440
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,181
WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO 

1441
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:38,414
REPORT. 

1442
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:39,383
MANY DIDN'T WANT TO GET THE 

1443
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,617
PERPETRATOR IN TROUBLE, AND 30% 

1444
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:50,127
DO NOT CITE A REASON. 

1445
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,528
THE NOTION THAT BECAUSE THESE 

1446
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:52,729
HAPPENED SO LONG AGO AND 

1447
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:53,597
WEREN'T PRESENTED TO THE PROPER 

1448
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,564
AUTHORITIES AT THE TIME AND 

1449
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,832
THAT THEY ARE COMING OUT NOW, 

1450
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:00,770
WHICH ANYBODY WHO HAS SPOKEN ON 

1451
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,373
THIS SUBJECT IN THE LAST TWO 

1452
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,908
WEEKS OR SO HAS UNDERSTOOD THAT 

1453
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:05,876
IT'S INCREASINGLY POLITICAL, NO 

1454
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:06,276
DOUBT ABOUT THAT. 

1455
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,613
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS? 

1456
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:11,982
>> I APPRECIATE WHEN YOU TALK 

1457
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,050
ABOUT THIS PRESUMPTION, BUT 

1458
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,920
THESE -- THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 

1459
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,992
CASE. 

1460
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,094
THESE ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST 

1461
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,429
HIM ARE NOT CRIMINAL, THEY ARE 

1462
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,396
INDICATIONS THAT HE WAS A HEAVY 

1463
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,431
DRINKER AND WAS DISRESPECTFUL 

1464
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:31,435
TO WOMEN. 

1465
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:32,602
EVEN IF WE IGNORE FOR ONE 

1466
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:36,973
MOMENT THE CRIMINAL CHARGES OR 

1467
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,241
EVEN IF WE ACCEPT THAT SOME OF 

1468
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:44,013
THAT IS TRUE, THAT, IN AND OF 

1469
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:46,149
ITSELF, BECOMES THE QUESTION OF 

1470
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,250
WHETHER HE WILL SERVE AS A 

1471
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,251
SUPREME COURT JUDGE. 

1472
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,820
REMEMBER, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 

1473
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,489
CRIMINAL FOR THEM TO TAKE A VOTE

1474
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,224
BASED ON THE FACT THAT AT SOME 

1475
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,493
POINT IN HIS LIFE HE WAS 

1476
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,562
DISRESPECTFUL TO WOMEN THAT IT 

1477
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,664
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO 

1478
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,631
MAKE A JUDGMENT NOW IN REGARD 

1479
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,666
TO SUCH IMPORTANT THINGS AS 

1480
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,637
REGARDS TO THE LAW. 

1481
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,007
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING 

1482
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,210
HAPPENING 35 YEARS AGO, YES, ANY

1483
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,178
TIME IN THE INN -- ANY 

1484
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,480
INDIVIDUAL IN A CRIMINAL 

1485
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,648
PROCESS COMES FORWARD AND MAKES 

1486
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:22,018
AN ALLEGATION, NOT JUST ABOUT 

1487
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,121
RAPE, BUT ABOUT ANY TYPE OF 

1488
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,189
CRIME, IT IS THE JOB OF THE 

1489
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,091
PROSECUTOR TO VET THAT WITNESS 

1490
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:28,859
AND THAT CAN MAKE A 

1491
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,860
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER 

1492
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,197
THAT PERSON IS CREDIBLE. 

1493
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,866
AS TO WHETHER THERE IS 

1494
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,400
CORROBORATION OR IF THE 

1495
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,036
INDIVIDUAL HAD A MENTAL 

1496
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,970
DISORDER OR DISEASE THAT MAY 

1497
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:41,070
CAUSE THEM NOT TO BE TRUTHFUL. 

1498
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,072
OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO BE 

1499
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:48,545
VETTED AND WE SHOULD EXPECT 

1500
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,247
THAT THEY BE VETTED IN THIS 

1501
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:50,680
SCENARIO. 

1502
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,049
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE 

1503
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,785
OBLIGATED, AT THIS STAGE, TO 

1504
00:50:55,785 --> 00:50:56,986
GIVE KAVANAUGH THE BENEFIT OF 

1505
00:50:56,986 --> 00:50:58,889
THE DOUBT. 

1506
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,423
WE NOW HAVE THREE WITNESSES 

1507
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:03,460
THAT HAVE COME FORWARD WHO HAVE 

1508
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,228
MADE SWORN AFFIDAVITS AND THEY 

1509
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,430
ARE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT IN 

1510
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,332
WRITING AND WILLING TO BE CROSS-

1511
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:09,599
EXAMINED. 

1512
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,003
I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT HE'S 

1513
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:13,603
ENTITLED TO THAT PRESUMPTION 

1514
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,503
ANYMORE, NOT IN THIS SETTING. 

1515
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:16,106
>> JULIE, WE KNOW THAT THE 

1516
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,810
FEMALE PROSECUTOR WOULD BE HIRED

1517
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,212
AND HER NAME IS RACHEL 

1518
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,313
MITCHELL. 

1519
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,748
I IMAGINE SHE IS FEROCIOUSLY 

1520
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:33,156
REWRITING WHATEVER HER PLAN WAS 

1521
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,891
IN TERMS OF QUESTIONING BOTH 

1522
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:35,692
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD. 

1523
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,260
WHAT DO YOU SEE HER ROLE AS 

1524
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,530
RIGHT NOW? 

1525
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:41,998
HOW DICEY IS THIS MOVING 

1526
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:47,404
FORWARD FOR HER? 

1527
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,739
>> IT'S FUNNY AND I THINK WE 

1528
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,675
CAN ALL AGREE THAT IT'S 

1529
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,477
INTERESTING THAT THEY CHOSE A 

1530
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,044
FEMALE PROSECUTOR AND THAT WAS 

1531
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:55,946
PURPOSEFUL. 

1532
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,280
WHEN WE THINK BACK TO ANITA 

1533
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,548
HILL SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF 

1534
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,017
MEN ASKING HER INAPPROPRIATE 

1535
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:01,985
QUESTIONS, AS FAR AS I RECALL, 

1536
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:07,891
IT WAS A CRINGE WORTHY MOMENT. 

1537
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,360
THEY ARE CERTAINLY TRYING TO 

1538
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,529
RESCUE IT BY BRINGING IN A 

1539
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:12,762
FEMALE. 

1540
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:13,863
FEMALE OR MAIL, THEY HAVE TO BE 

1541
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:14,531
INCREDIBLY CAREFUL HOW THEY 

1542
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:20,637
CROSS-EXAMINE THE INDIVIDUAL. 

1543
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,739
IF IT'S TOO AGGRESSIVE, THEY 

1544
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,774
WILL TURN OFF THE VIEWERS. 

1545
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:28,011
THAT IS PEOPLE IN THE ROOM 

1546
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:28,979
WATCHING. 

1547
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,248
IF SHE IS ONE OF THOSE 

1548
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:32,215
INDIVIDUALS THAT IS QUIET OR 

1549
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,049
SOFT SPOKEN, IT MAY ACTUALLY BE 

1550
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:39,389
TOO AGGRESSIVE AND THEY MAY LEND

1551
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,624
CREDIBILITY TO WHAT SHE HAS TO 

1552
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:40,824
SAY. 

1553
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:41,825
THEY HAVE TO BE SUPER CAREFUL 

1554
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,996
IN HOW THEY CROSS-EXAMINE THIS 

1555
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:46,963
INDIVIDUAL. 

1556
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,632
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIRING A 

1557
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:49,766
WOMAN, BUT THE OBJECTS -- THEY 

1558
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:54,237
DIDN'T WANT A GROUP OF OLDER MEN

1559
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,573
GRILLING A SEXUAL ASSAULT 

1560
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:56,806
VICTIM. 

1561
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,742
I DON'T KNOW IF HIRING A WOMAN 

1562
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,143
IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE MUCH OF 

1563
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:00,476
A DIFFERENCE. 

1564
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:01,478
QUITE POSSIBLY IT SENDS THE 

1565
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:06,349
MESSAGE THAT THESE GROUP OF MEN 

1566
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,617
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY IN A 

1567
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:08,418
REASONABLE OR RESPONSIBLE OR 

1568
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,252
COMPASSIONATE WAY, TO QUESTION 

1569
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:09,552
THE VICTIM. 

1570
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:12,222
>> I THINK THERE IS A LEVEL OF 

1571
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:18,995
IT BEING TRANSPARENT TO PICK A 

1572
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:19,228
WOMAN. 

1573
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:21,464
NOT TO SEE A WOMAN CAN'T HANDLE 

1574
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,499
THE JOB, I'M SURE SHE CAN. 

1575
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,134
IF SHE'S TOO AGGRESSIVE, I 

1576
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:31,274
DON'T THINK THE FIT WILL BE AS 

1577
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:31,908
AN INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE CROSS-

1578
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:33,009
EXAMINE HER, BUT ONE THAT KNOWS 

1579
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:39,215
HOW TO LISTEN AND CALMLY BRING 

1580
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,251
THE VICTIMS THROUGH THE CASE TO 

1581
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,719
TRY TO POKE HOLES IN HER STORY, 

1582
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,120
SHE WOULD HAVE TO BE 

1583
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,355
INCREDIBLY, INCREDIBLY CAREFUL 

1584
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:48,124
HOW SHE NAVIGATES THAT CROSS-

1585
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,026
EXAMINATION. 

1586
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,028
>> IT'S ALSO SURPRISING, AND 

1587
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:59,002
WITH JULIE AND VINOO VARGHESE, 

1588
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,004
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH THAT 

1589
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,173
HAPPENED THAT WE'VE TALKED 

1590
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:03,540
ABOUT. 

1591
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,709
BUT I BELIEVE BOTH OF YOU 

1592
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,676
SUGGESTED THAT IN LIGHT OF 

1593
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:07,477
THESE RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF 

1594
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:08,344
THIS ACCUSER, THAT YOU WOULD 

1595
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:09,545
WANT TO HEAR FROM MARK JUDGE, 

1596
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:12,315
WHO WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH'S BEST 

1597
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,918
FRIEND IN HIGH SCHOOL. 

1598
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,754
IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE, HE IS 

1599
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,324
NAMED AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS AWARE 

1600
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:24,227
OF THE BEHAVIOR OF MR. 

1601
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,364
KAVANAUGH. 

1602
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,832
I WENT BACK TO LOOK AT THE NEW 

1603
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:35,138
YORKER ARTICLE AND IT CAME OUT 

1604
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,739
THIS WEEK WITH JANE MAYER AND 

1605
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:39,576
THEY INTERVIEWED MR. JUDGE'S 

1606
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,244
GIRLFRIEND AND IN ONE OF THE 

1607
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,579
QUOTES, HER NAME WAS ELIZABETH 

1608
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,781
RAZOR AND SHE DATED MARK JUDGE 

1609
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,416
FOR THREE YEARS AND RECALLED 

1610
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,818
THAT JUDGE HAD TOLD HER 

1611
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,186
ASHAMEDLY OF AN INCIDENT 

1612
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,421
INVOLVING HIM AND OTHER BOYS 

1613
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,823
TAKING TURNS HAVING SEX WITH A 

1614
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:54,156
DRUNK WOMAN. 

1615
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:56,126
RAZOR SAID THE JUDGE REGARDED 

1616
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,993
IT AS FULLY CONSENSUAL AND 

1617
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:57,927
JUDGE DID NOT NAME OTHERS 

1618
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,130
úINVO 

1619
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,534
KNOWLEDGE THAT KAVANAUGH 

1620
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:04,867
PARTICIPATED. 

1621
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:07,604
BUT, WAS DISTURBED BY THE STORY 

1622
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,240
AND NOTED THAT IT UNDERCUT IT 

1623
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,408
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SEXUAL 

1624
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,142
INNOCENCE AT GEORGETOWN PREP, 

1625
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,209
WHICH WAS WHERE BOTH HE AND 

1626
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,210
BRETT KAVANAUGH WENT TO HIGH 

1627
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:14,443
SCHOOL. 

1628
00:55:14,443 --> 00:55:16,379
DO YOU AGREE THAT YOU WOULD 

1629
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,248
RECOMMEND TO THE SENATE THAT 

1630
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:23,787
THEY HEAR FROM MR. JUDGE? 

1631
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:24,820
>> I'M PROBABLY NOT AS 

1632
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:29,859
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM MR. 

1633
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:30,493
JUDGE. I 

1634
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,929
DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL TELL THE 

1635
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:33,162
TRUTH. 

1636
00:55:33,162 --> 00:55:33,830
>> THAT'S INTERESTING. 

1637
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,765
IN FRONT OF THE SCENT OF? 

1638
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,402
HE COULD GO TO JAIL FOR LYING 

1639
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,269
TO THE SENATE. 

1640
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:42,205
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 

1641
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,507
IT'S DIFFICULT IN THIS SETTING 

1642
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,375
TO DISPROVE WHAT HE WOULD SAY 

1643
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,776
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DNA 

1644
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,346
EVIDENCE AND WE WON'T HAVE THOSE

1645
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:51,381
THINGS THAT POTENTIALLY WE 

1646
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,583
WOULD NEED TO PROVE THAT HE'S 

1647
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,451
NOT FORTHRIGHT. I 

1648
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,286
BELIEVE PART OF THE REASON HE 

1649
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,153
ISN'T COMING IN IS BECAUSE HE 

1650
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,321
DON'T -- HE DOESN'T THINK HE 

1651
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,656
CAN TELL THE TRUTH. 

1652
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,591
AT THE END OF THE DAY, I DON'T 

1653
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,259
KNOW IF HE WILL MAKE OR BREAK 

1654
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,129
THE CASE. 

1655
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,597
AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO THE IDEA 

1656
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,464
THAT IT SHOULD BE FURTHER 

1657
00:56:08,464 --> 00:56:09,732
VETTED AND WE SHOULDN'T BE 

1658
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:15,038
RUSHING AND IF WE WERE ON TRIAL 

1659
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,006
WITH THE CASE, WE WOULDN'T BE 

1660
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,242
RUSHING TO TRY IT TOMORROW WHEN 

1661
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,176
WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT AN 

1662
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,144
ADDITIONAL COMPLAINANT COMING 

1663
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,713
FORWARD TODAY. 

1664
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,981
WE WOULD EXPECT WHEN THERE IS A 

1665
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:26,182
DECISION OF THIS IMPORTANCE, 

1666
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:30,119
WHEN YOU DETERMINE WHO WILL BE 

1667
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,287
MAKING THESE DECISIONS FOR THE 

1668
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,155
ENTIRE LIFETIME, THAT WE COULD 

1669
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:32,956
GIVE IT A LITTLE TIME. 

1670
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,190
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS 

1671
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,594
HEARING FROM THE WITNESSES, THE 

1672
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:41,564
ALLEGED VICTIMS IN THE CASE AND 

1673
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,231
ANYONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE 

1674
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:48,338
WHAT THEY SAY. 

1675
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:49,939
IF REPUBLICANS -- IF MR. 

1676
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,374
KAVANAUGH THINKS THAT MR. JUDGE 

1677
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,542
CAN CREDIBLY COME IN AND VOTE 

1678
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,411
FOR HIM, BY ALL MEANS, ONE 

1679
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,446
WOULD THINK THEY'D WANT HIM TO 

1680
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,115
BUT THEN HE WILL BE SUBJECT TO 

1681
00:56:59,115 --> 00:56:59,548
CROSS-EXAMINATION. 

1682
00:56:59,548 --> 00:57:00,182
>> I WANT TO READ A STATEMENT 

1683
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:05,722
BY SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER, 

1684
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:06,956
REPUBLICANS NEED TO IMMEDIATELY 

1685
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,525
SUSPEND THE PROCEEDINGS RELATED 

1686
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,159
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION 

1687
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,929
AND THE PRESIDENT MUST ORDER 

1688
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,130
THE FBI TO REOPEN THE 

1689
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:14,797
BACKGROUND CHECK INVESTIGATION. 

1690
00:57:14,797 --> 00:57:15,398
THERE ARE NO MULTIPLE 

1691
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:15,931
CORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS 

1692
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:23,272
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH MADE úU 

1693
00:57:23,272 --> 00:57:25,408
THEY ALL DESERVE A THOROUGH 

1694
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:25,775
INVESTIGATION. 

1695
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,309
I STRONGLY BELIEVE JUDGE 

1696
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,577
KAVANAUGH SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM 

1697
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:28,311
CONSIDERATION. 

1698
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:31,881
IF HE WILL NOT, AT THE VERY 

1699
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,384
LEAST, THE HEARING AND THE VOTE 

1700
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,419
SHOULD BE POSTPONED WHILE THE 

1701
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,154
FBI INVESTIGATIONS THESE -- 

1702
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,221
WHILE THE FBI INVESTIGATES. 

1703
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,391
IF THEY PROCEED WITHOUT THE 

1704
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,993
INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD BE A 

1705
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:45,328
TRAVESTY FOR THE HONOR OF THE 

1706
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,128
SUPREME COURT AND OUR COUNTRY. 

1707
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:49,999
VINOO, YOU HAVE EXPRESSED THE 

1708
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,868
ASCENSION THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1709
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,902
IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY 

1710
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,303
AND THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 

1711
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:59,676
I HAVE TO WONDER. 

1712
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,878
BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO BE A 

1713
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,279
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE AND NOT 

1714
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,046
ANYTHING ELSE, PERHAPS -- 

1715
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:05,848
>> HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS LIFE 

1716
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:06,248
IF HE WITHDRAWS. 

1717
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:07,417
>> I WONDER IF YOU WOULD BE 

1718
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,985
ABLE TO GO BACK TO BEING A 

1719
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,721
JUDGE. 

1720
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,157
BUT THE PRESUMPTION OF 

1721
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,124
INNOCENCE IS ALWAYS THERE, THE 

1722
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,392
FACT THAT HE IS ATTEMPTING TO 

1723
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,360
BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE 

1724
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,795
MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE 

1725
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:19,095
SENSITIVE? 

1726
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:26,169
>> I AGREE WITH THAT. 

1727
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,970
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, THE 

1728
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,706
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND, A 

1729
00:58:30,706 --> 00:58:32,141
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. 

1730
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,176
UNDERSTAND HE ALREADY HAS A 

1731
00:58:34,176 --> 00:58:34,877
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AS A COURT 

1732
00:58:34,877 --> 00:58:35,644
OF APPEALS JUDGE IN D.C.. 

1733
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:42,185
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE ZENITH OF 

1734
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,686
A LAWYER, TO BE ON THE SUPREME 

1735
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:50,526
COURT. 

1736
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,494
I'M NOT SAYING -- I DON'T 

1737
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,127
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD 

1738
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:52,795
WITHDRAW HIS NOMINATION. 

1739
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,831
HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS 

1740
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,632
WARRANTS FURTHER FBI 

1741
00:58:55,632 --> 00:59:01,504
INVESTIGATION. WHILE JULIE AND I

1742
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:05,141
AGREE IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL CASE, 

1743
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:09,145
HE IS BEING ACCUSED OF CRIMES 

1744
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,680
WITH THIS ALLEGATION THAT HE 

1745
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:14,384
WAS INVOLVED, POTENTIALLY, IN A 

1746
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,388
TRAIN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 

1747
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:18,621
PEOPLE. 

1748
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:19,956
>> WE SHOULD CLARIFY BECAUSE IN 

1749
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:25,528
HER STATEMENT SHE SAID THAT SHE 

1750
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:31,968
HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND 

1751
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,302
MARK JUDGE AND BRETT KAVANAUGH 

1752
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:34,103
WERE PRESENT. 

1753
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,172
SHE DOESN'T ACCUSE THEM OF 

1754
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:36,539
ASSAULTING HER. 

1755
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:37,340
SHE SAID SHE WAS AWARE OF 

1756
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,708
SEXUAL ASSAULTS GOING ON INSIDE 

1757
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:42,211
ROOMS OR BEDROOMS. 

1758
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,680
SHE DIDN'T SAY SHE WITNESSED 

1759
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,381
THEM BUT SHE SAW YOUNG MEN 

1760
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,250
LINING UP TO TAKE THEIR TURN 

1761
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,452
AND IN THAT LINEUP SHE OFTEN 

1762
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,486
SAW BRETT KAVANAUGH AND MARK 

1763
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:50,719
JUDGE. 

1764
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,088
>> WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE 

1765
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:57,460
KAVANAUGH OF MR. KAVANAUGH. 

1766
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,961
WE HAVE A SOURCE WITHIN THE 

1767
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:00,963
WHITE HOUSE THAT TWEETED THIS 

1768
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:01,230
EARLIER. 

1769
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,131
HE SAID, THE WHITE HOUSE IS 

1770
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,934
SHOCKED BY AVENATTI CLAIMS. 

1771
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,304
PRIVATELY, THEY ARE SAYING THIS 

1772
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,507
COULD BE THE END OF THE LINE FOR

1773
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,776
KAVANAUGH FOR OUTSIDE ADVISOR. 

1774
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,545
THIS IS COMING FROM GABRIEL 

1775
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:16,579
SHERMAN, REPORTER FOR VANITY 

1776
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:16,779
FAIR. 

1777
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,980
MICHAEL AVENATTI RESPONDED AND 

1778
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,148
SAID, THIS SHOWS HOW 

1779
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:19,948
INCOMPETENT THE WHITE HOUSE IS. 

1780
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:21,050
THEY MUST NOT HAVE BEEN PAYING 

1781
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:21,818
ATTENTION THE LAST SEVEN 

1782
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:22,051
MONTHS. 

1783
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:28,590
I GUESS THEIR CHIEF SOURCE OF 

1784
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,660
NEWS IS FOX NEWS. 

1785
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,161
THE ASSERTION BY GABRIEL 

1786
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,362
SHERMAN AND TALKING TO HIS 

1787
01:00:33,362 --> 01:00:35,298
SOURCES AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 

1788
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,165
JULIE, IS THAT EVEN THOUGH 

1789
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:37,300
AVENATTI HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

1790
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,903
THIS AND IT APPEARED ON 

1791
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,740
TELEVISION TO TEASE THE NEWS 

1792
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,110
THAT HE HAD MADE CONTACT WITH A 

1793
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,444
THIRD ACCUSER, THEY ARE STILL 

1794
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,312
SHOCKED BY THIS AND THE 

1795
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,279
THINKING ACCORDING TO GABE IS 

1796
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:54,617
ú 

1797
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:55,451
SINKS THIS POTENTIAL NOMINEE. 

1798
01:00:55,451 --> 01:01:01,290
>> THERE IS A TIME WHEN IT'S 

1799
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,159
TIME TO CUT YOUR LOSSES AND ONE 

1800
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,862
QUESTION AT THIS POINT, ONE MAY 

1801
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,698
WONDER IF IT IS THAT TIME. 

1802
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,600
REMEMBER, IF THEY PUSH THIS TOO 

1803
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,567
HARD AND THESE WITNESSES COME 

1804
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,136
IN AND THEY ARE CREDIBLE AND 

1805
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:17,406
KAVANAUGH IS NOT, IT HURTS THEM 

1806
01:01:17,406 --> 01:01:18,775
NOT JUST IN THIS SITUATION, BUT 

1807
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:22,311
WHO THE NEXT CHOICE IS. 

1808
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,881
THEY MAY SAY WE DON'T WANT TO 

1809
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:25,982
PUT THESE WMEN THROUGH IT AND 

1810
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,149
WE CAN'T STAND BEHIND A PERSON 

1811
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:31,587
EVEN IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT THE 

1812
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:36,792
MOST SEVERE CHARGES, THAT IT 

1813
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,494
WOULD BE SO INAPPROPRIATE AND 

1814
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,462
MISGUIDED ON THE TREATMENT OF 

1815
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:40,429
WOMEN DURING THAT PERIOD OF 

1816
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,732
TIME THAT WE WON'T STAND BE -- 

1817
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:47,837
BESIDE HIM. 

1818
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:48,638
>> FROM ALL THIS PLAYING OUT, 

1819
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:53,175
IT FEELS THAT THIS IS GOING TO 

1820
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:56,979
PLAY OUT IN COURT ROOMS AND IN 

1821
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,614
DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS THE 

1822
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:06,155
COUNTRY. 

1823
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,423
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS MADE 

1824
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,224
AGAINST MR. KAVANAUGH, HOWEVER 

1825
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,091
IT TURNS OUT, WOULD THIS MAKE 

1826
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:17,300
BOTH OF YOUR JOBS HARDER IF YOU 

1827
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,868
ARE A PROSECUTOR AND YOU HAVE 

1828
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:19,535
SOMEBODY NOT GOING AFTER 

1829
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:20,236
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BEING 

1830
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,005
THAT WOULD SUGGEST A SCHOOL 

1831
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,173
SUPERINTENDENT OR SOMEBODY WHO 

1832
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,607
IS A STATE SENATOR, IF THEY DID 

1833
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:31,179
SOMETHING WHEN IT WAS 10-15-25 

1834
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,014
YEARS AGO? 

1835
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:36,219
IN THIS ERA, DOES THAT EMPOWER 

1836
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:36,919
MORE WOMEN TO COME FORWARD? 

1837
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:43,960
OR DOES IT -- AS WE POINT OUT 

1838
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,927
EARLIER, SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S 

1839
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,928
SO MUCH HEAT AND SCRUTINY AND 

1840
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,096
ATTENTION ON THIS FROM THE 

1841
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,131
MEDIA AND FROM OTHERS AND FROM 

1842
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:56,339
PEOPLE WHO HAVE POLITICAL 

1843
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:57,273
AGENDAS, THAT THIS MAY CONTINUE 

1844
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,441
TO DRIVE FOLKS WHO FEEL THEY 

1845
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,709
HAVE A STORY TO TELL TO NOT 

1846
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,443
TELL THAT STORY TO LAWYERS? 

1847
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,511
>> IT MAKES BOTH SIDES MORE 

1848
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:05,014
DIFFICULT. 

1849
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:10,386
THE PROSECUTOR, IF WE THINK 

1850
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,254
ABOUT HARVEY WEINSTEIN, WHAT 

1851
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:17,126
OCCURRED OR WHAT DIDN'T OCCUR, 

1852
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,794
AND MAY HAVE AMOUNTED TO HIM 

1853
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:19,562
GETTING ARRESTED NOW AND 

1854
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:20,329
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

1855
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,831
BEING ASKED AS TO WHY THE BALL 

1856
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:22,164
WAS DROPPED. 

1857
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:25,668
THE JOB OF THE PROSECUTOR'S IS 

1858
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:30,773
NOT TO NOT ARREST BUT TO MAKE 

1859
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,741
THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHEN 

1860
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:35,311
WITNESSES ARE CREDIBLE, IF THEY 

1861
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,712
ARE, IF THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A 

1862
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:37,613
CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST THEM, AS 

1863
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:42,351
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, I'M SURE IT 

1864
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,920
MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT IN 

1865
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,792
CERTAIN WAYS BECAUSE WHEN YOU 

1866
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,327
HAVE A LESS HIGH-POWERED CLIENT 

1867
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:56,332
BEING ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, IF 

1868
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,134
YOU ARE CONCERNED THE 

1869
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,169
PROSECUTOR WOULD TREAT THOSE 

1870
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,637
CASES, THAT THEY TREATED LESS 

1871
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:02,905
SERIOUSLY BEFORE OR MORE 

1872
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,440
SERIOUSLY NOW. 

1873
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:04,940
OBVIOUSLY, AS A DEFENSE 

1874
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,308
ATTORNEY, YOU DON'T WANT THAT. 

1875
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:09,111
YOU WANT THE CASES RESOLVED THE 

1876
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,346
WAY THEY USED TO BE BECAUSE 

1877
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,281
THAT'S YOUR JOB AS A DEFENSE 

1878
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,983
ATTORNEY. 

1879
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,251
IT'S MAKING BOTH SIDES A LITTLE 

1880
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,051
MORE CONSCIENTIOUS AND A LITTLE 

1881
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:17,420
BIT MORE CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE 

1882
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,221
JOBS REALLY ARE. 

1883
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:24,260
>> WE HAVE THE LATEST STATEMENT 

1884
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:25,594
FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH AND IT'S 

1885
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:31,300
OBVIOUSLY BRIEF. 

1886
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,035
THE QUOTE FROM THE JUDGE IS 

1887
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,937
THAT THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND 

1888
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:36,339
FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE. I 

1889
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:39,075
DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS AND THIS 

1890
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,209
NEVER HAPPENED. 

1891
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,744
>> WHO THIS IS, ACCORDING TO 

1892
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:42,611
THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT, IS A HIGH 

1893
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:47,750
RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO 

1894
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,654
HAS HELD THE FOLLOWING -- ENTRY 

1895
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,123
POINTS OUT INACTIVE -- BUT TOP 

1896
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,091
SECRET CLEARANCES FOR THE U.S. 

1897
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:55,891
DEPARTMENT OF STATE, THE 

1898
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:56,826
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE 

1899
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:57,526
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 

1900
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,928
SECURITY AS WELL IS CUSTOMS AND 

1901
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,830
BORDER PROTECTION. 

1902
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,365
THE FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

1903
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,432
COMES OUT WITH A STATEMENT 

1904
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,566
UNEQUIVOCAL, THIS IS RIDICULOUS 

1905
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:06,469
AND FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE, I 

1906
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,204
DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS IN THIS 

1907
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:08,938
NEVER HAPPENED, HOW EASY OR 

1908
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:13,075
HARD WILL IT BE TO PROVE THAT 

1909
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,444
-- THAT HE ACTUALLY KNEW HER OR 

1910
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:15,844
DIDN'T KNOW HER? 

1911
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:20,516
>> WHEN I SEE THIS NEVER 

1912
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,550
HAPPENED, THE FIRST THING THAT 

1913
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,251
COMES UP, WHICH THIS? 

1914
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,019
THERE'S SO MANY ALLEGATIONS IN 

1915
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,353
HER STATEMENT THAT HE SAID 

1916
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,623
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND OTHERS HAVE 

1917
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:27,923
SAID DID. 

1918
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:32,929
I DON'T EVEN KNOW --

1919
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,965
>> LET'S GO WITH DRINKING 

1920
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:36,298
EXCESSIVELY. 

1921
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:38,234
HE SAID IT NEVER HAPPEN. 

1922
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,535
NOT THESE ACCUSERS BUT OTHERS 

1923
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,937
SUGGESTED THAT HE WAS A HEAVY 

1924
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:42,237
DRINKER. 

1925
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:43,973
'S ATTORNEY APPEARED ON HERE 

1926
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:47,009
THIS MORNING AND SAID THERE ARE 

1927
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,244
OTHERS WHO SAY HIS EXACTLY AS 

1928
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,411
HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF ON FOX 

1929
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:52,915
NEWS. I 

1930
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,351
WONDER, AS A PROSECUTOR AND A 

1931
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:56,852
CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, HOW 

1932
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,254
HARD OR EASY WOULD IT BE TO 

1933
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,221
DISPROVE THIS, I DON'T KNOW 

1934
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:03,291
WHERE THIS PERSON IS? 

1935
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:06,095
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY 

1936
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:06,996
DIFFICULT TO PROVE OR DISPROVE 

1937
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:07,429
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 

1938
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:13,502
>> THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HER? 

1939
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,070
>> HOW WILL THEY PROVE THAT? 

1940
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,672
HE WENT TO AN ALL BOYS SCHOOL. 

1941
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:17,907
HE MAY HAVE BEEN AT A PARTY 

1942
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:22,344
WITH HER, WHO KNOWS? 

1943
01:06:22,344 --> 01:06:23,111
I UNDERSTAND WHY KAVANAUGH 

1944
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:31,454
MAKES THESE STATEMENTS AND HE'S 

1945
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,189
ALL IN, AND REPUBLICANS ARE ALL 

1946
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:33,355
IN. 

1947
01:06:33,355 --> 01:06:33,989
HE'S MAKING THIS STATEMENT AND 

1948
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,558
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 

1949
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,260
DIFFICULT. 

1950
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,195
THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE 

1951
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,362
SENATE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK AND 

1952
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:42,164
SET UP NEW HEARINGS AND CONDUCT 

1953
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:48,270
THE INVESTIGATION. 

1954
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,906
AT THIS POINT, IT'S STUPID NOT 

1955
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,107
TO AND I GET THE POLITICAL 

1956
01:06:52,107 --> 01:06:54,343
REASONS FOR GOING FORWARD BUT 

1957
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,744
ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE GOING TO 

1958
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:57,112
SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT. 

1959
01:06:57,112 --> 01:06:59,949
IF THEY DON'T VENT THESE THINGS 

1960
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,150
AND IT GOES TO THE SUPREME 

1961
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,851
COURT, THERE WILL BE PAYBACK IN 

1962
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:03,853
THE LONG RUN. 

1963
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,388
>> THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT 

1964
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:08,591
WANTING HIM ON THE SUPREME 

1965
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,558
COURT BEFORE IT BEGINS, THE 

1966
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:10,326
TERM BEGINS BUT MORE 

1967
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,260
IMPORTANTLY BEFORE THE MIDTERM 

1968
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,065
ELECTIONS. 

1969
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,801
AS WE GO FORWARD, AND WE TALKED 

1970
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,069
ABOUT THIS EARLIER, THERE WILL 

1971
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,102
BE A CAVEAT ASSOCIATED WITH HIS 

1972
01:07:21,102 --> 01:07:21,303
NAME. 

1973
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:28,277
THESE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST 

1974
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,678
SCANDALOUS AND EXPLOSIVE 

1975
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,280
ALLEGATIONS IN REGARD TO THE 

1976
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,948
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE THAT I 

1977
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:33,849
HAVE EVER HEARD. 

1978
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,719
>> BY ALMOST ANY BUDDY-BUDDY -- 

1979
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,287
BY ALMOST ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC 

1980
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:38,587
EYE. 

1981
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,255
>> BEING A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, 

1982
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:41,490
WE'VE GOT THIS STATEMENT THAT 

1983
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,591
IS A COUPLE OF SENTENCES BUT 

1984
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:50,833
HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE A CLIENT. 

1985
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,935
DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL? 

1986
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,504
>> THAT COULD BE A COURSE OF 

1987
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:59,141
ACTION YOU TAKE BUT THIS ISN'T A

1988
01:07:59,141 --> 01:07:59,541
NORMAL SITUATION. 

1989
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:00,910
JULIE AND I AGREE THAT IT'S NOT 

1990
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,011
A CRIMINAL CASE. 

1991
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:06,282
DOING AN INVESTIGATION, WE TELL 

1992
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:08,784
CLIENTS IF THEY COME TO US EARLY

1993
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:11,987
ENOUGH, NOT TO SAY ANYTHING IN 

1994
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:12,554
THE INVESTIGATION TAKES ITS 

1995
01:08:12,554 --> 01:08:13,322
COURSE, WE MAY PROVIDE 

1996
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:14,289
ASSISTANCE TO PROSECUTORS AND 

1997
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:15,924
THEY WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT 

1998
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:24,300
SITUATION. 

1999
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,935
AT THIS POINT, HE SHOULD EITHER 

2000
01:08:26,935 --> 01:08:28,170
WITHDRAW OR GO 100% AHEAD. 

2001
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:32,241
HE'S CHOOSING 100% AHEAD AND 

2002
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:37,479
ACTUALLY, THEY HAVE TO DO THIS 

2003
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:38,513
FOR THE INVESTIGATION, TO DO 

2004
01:08:38,513 --> 01:08:39,214
THE BACKGROUND AND ALLOW THESE 

2005
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:40,014
PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD. 

2006
01:08:40,014 --> 01:08:40,682
WHAT MAY ULTIMATELY HAPPEN IS 

2007
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:43,285
THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE TESTIFY, 

2008
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:44,953
THEY MAY NOT APPEAR CREDIBLE 

2009
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:50,024
AND THIS IS WHERE THE 

2010
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:50,792
PROSECUTOR THAT HAS BEEN HIRED 

2011
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:53,828
BY THE REPUBLICANS -- I THINK 

2012
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:55,564
SHE SHOULD GO HARD ON EVERYONE 

2013
01:08:55,564 --> 01:09:03,906
AND TAKE THAT POSITION. 

2014
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,506
THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE TO BE 

2015
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:08,676
VETTED AND THERE'S NO REASON TO 

2016
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:09,044
GO AROUND THIS. 

2017
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,612
WE SHOULDN'T TREAT PEOPLE 

2018
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:13,349
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THEIR 

2019
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,582
GENDER. 

2020
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,350
IF THEY MAKE AN ACCUSATION OF 

2021
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,952
THIS MAGNITUDE, THEY SHOULD BE 

2022
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,287
SUBJECTED TO WHATEVER THE CROSS-

2023
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,154
EXAMINATION IS FOR ANY WITNESS 

2024
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:20,154
WHO MAKES AN ALLEGATION, THAT 

2025
01:09:20,154 --> 01:09:25,327
THEY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO. 

2026
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,363
IF THAT'S TOO DELICATE, THAT 

2027
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:28,529
DOESN'T SERVE THE PURPOSE. 

2028
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:30,165
IF THE OBJECTION IS TO GET TO 

2029
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:31,233
THE TRUTH, WHATEVER THAT IS, 

2030
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,701
HOWEVER YOU DO THAT, YOU SHOULD 

2031
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,104
DO THAT. 

2032
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,939
THINK THEY SHOULD ALL BE 

2033
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:37,238
SUBJECTED. 

2034
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:38,107
AT THE END OF THIS, THERE 

2035
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,944
SHOULD BE AN ACCOUNTING. 

2036
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:42,944
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 

2037
01:09:42,944 --> 01:09:43,679
SUPPORT HER POSITION AND THESE 

2038
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,714
ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD 

2039
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:50,953
DO TO GET THESE PLUSES AND 

2040
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:51,654
MINUSES AND THEN THE 

2041
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:52,720
REPUBLICANS WOULD MAKE THE 

2042
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:58,193
DETERMINATION OF IF THERE ARE 

2043
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:58,960
MORE PLUSES AND MINUSES. 

2044
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,228
AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T BE 

2045
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:06,302
SURPRISED IF THERE IS A PAUSE. 

2046
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,536
THIS SHOULD BE AT THE VERY 

2047
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,237
LEAST. 

2048
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:13,709
>> IN THE AFFIDAVIT, MS. 

2049
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:14,577
SWETNICK SAYS THIS IN PARAGRAPH 

2050
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:19,148
13 -- IN APPROXIMATELY 1982, I 

2051
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,482
BECAME THE VICTIM OF ONE OF 

2052
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:22,451
THESE, QUOTE, GANG OR, QUOTE, 

2053
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,286
TRAIN RAPES WHERE MARK JUDGE 

2054
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,321
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH WERE 

2055
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:25,921
PRESENT. 

2056
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,557
SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT, I 

2057
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:29,625
SHARED WITH WHAT TRANSPIRED 

2058
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,193
WITH AT LEAST TWO OTHER PEOPLE 

2059
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,028
AND DURING THE INCIDENT I WAS 

2060
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:34,730
INCAPACITATED WITHOUT MY 

2061
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,632
CONSENT AND UNABLE TO FIGHT OFF 

2062
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:38,701
THE BOYS RAPING ME. I 

2063
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,169
BELIEVE I WAS DRUGGED USING 

2064
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,336
QUAALUDES OR SOMETHING SIMILAR 

2065
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:43,171
PLACED IN WHAT I WAS DRINKING. 

2066
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,973
THE REASON I HIGHLIGHT THAT 

2067
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:46,175
PARAGRAPH IS BECAUSE, AS ANN 

2068
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,210
MURRAY POINTED OUT AND WE'VE 

2069
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:49,745
BEEN DISCUSSING, IT DOES NOT 

2070
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,380
SAY THAT MARK JUDGE AND BRETT 

2071
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,382
KAVANAUGH PARTICIPATED, BUT 

2072
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,183
THAT THEY WERE THERE. 

2073
01:10:55,183 --> 01:10:56,719
SHE SAID SHE WAS DRUGGED, 

2074
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,053
UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT AND 

2075
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,122
UNABLE TO FIGHT OFF THE BOYS 

2076
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,257
THAT WERE RAPING HER AND SHE 

2077
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,293
BELIEVES -- AND THIS IS HER 

2078
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,663
ASSERTION -- THAT SHE WAS 

2079
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,330
DRUGGED USING EITHER QUAALUDES 

2080
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,365
OR SOMETHING ELSE PLACED IN 

2081
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,333
WHAT SHE WAS DRINKING. 

2082
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,303
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD IF 

2083
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,304
YOU ARE CROSS-EXAMINING HER AND 

2084
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,071
YOU ARE THE PERSON THE 

2085
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:16,839
REPUBLICANS HAVE CHOSEN TO 

2086
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:23,711
EXAMINE AND TO TALK TO, FOR DR. 

2087
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:26,148
FORD, HOW DO TAKE THAT 

2088
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,282
PARAGRAPH AND WHAT TO SAY TO 

2089
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:28,116
SOMEONE WHO SAID THEY WERE A 

2090
01:11:28,116 --> 01:11:31,519
VICTIM IN INCAPACITATED AND 

2091
01:11:31,519 --> 01:11:31,786
DRUGGED? 

2092
01:11:31,786 --> 01:11:33,922
THEY REMEMBER TWO INDIVIDUALS 

2093
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,658
BEING THERE BUT THAT IS ALL 

2094
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,659
THEY HAVE TO GO ON AND IT 

2095
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,228
HAPPENED 30 PLUS YEARS AGO? 

2096
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,062
>> LET'S BE CLEAR. 

2097
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:43,265
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GO 

2098
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:44,233
ABOUT CROSS-EXAMINING A FEMALE, 

2099
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:49,371
NO MATTER WHO IT IS, THE 

2100
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,173
RELEVANCE ISN'T WHETHER IT IS 

2101
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:52,441
MALE OR FEMALE, BUT YOU HAVE TO 

2102
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,409
KNOW, AS A PROSECUTOR AND 

2103
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:54,543
DEFENSE ATTORNEY, WHO THE 

2104
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:59,882
WITNESS IS. 

2105
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,483
WHO THAT WITNESS IS, AND HOW 

2106
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:02,351
THEY WILL PORTRAY THEMSELVES 

2107
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,152
AND HOW THEY WILL BEHAVE 

2108
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:11,627
WEATHER ON THE STAND OR IN A 

2109
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,427
HEARING DICTATES HOW YOU CROSS-

2110
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:12,760
EXAMINE THEM. 

2111
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,796
YOU CAN BE AGGRESSIVE WITH A 

2112
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:14,696
WITNESS WITHOUT YELLING AT THEM 

2113
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:17,866
AND WITHOUT INSULTING THEM. 

2114
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,803
AS WE KNOW FROM PRIOR HEARINGS, 

2115
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,003
A LOT OF ATTORNEYS AND NON-

2116
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:22,971
ATTORNEYS DON'T KNOW HOW THE 

2117
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,039
HECK TO GET SOMEONE OR CROSS-

2118
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:30,779
EXAMINE THEM THE RIGHT WAY. 

2119
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:32,614
SHE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO TOE THE 

2120
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:44,493
LINE. 

2121
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,628
BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH 

2122
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,197
CERTAIN WITNESSES CAN BACKFIRE 

2123
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,699
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

2124
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,533
SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS, 

2125
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,968
OBVIOUSLY, THE QUESTIONS TO ASK 

2126
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,804
ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THAT DAY, BUT

2127
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,638
THAT PERIOD OF TIME. 

2128
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:57,706
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE 

2129
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,274
WHY SHE DIDN'T COME FORWARD AND 

2130
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,510
WHO SHE TOLD AND WHAT 

2131
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:08,617
SURROUNDED HER AT THAT TIME. 

2132
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,118
THE PROBLEM THE CROSS EXAMINER 

2133
01:13:10,118 --> 01:13:12,154
WILL HAVE IS A LOT OF THE 

2134
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:13,555
QUESTIONS SHE ASKED MAY GIVE 

2135
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,424
ANSWERS THAT WILL HURT HER. 

2136
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:19,594
FOR EXAMPLE, IF I SAY, WHO DID 

2137
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:23,165
YOU TELL AND SHE NAMES TWO 

2138
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:23,799
PEOPLE, POTENTIALLY, YOU HAVE 

2139
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,335
TWO WITNESSES THAT WILL ARGUABLY

2140
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:27,469
CORROBORATE WHAT SHE SAID AND 

2141
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:28,470
YOU ARE HURTING YOUR CASE WHEN 

2142
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:32,941
YOU DO THAT EXAMINATION. 

2143
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,476
IT IS NOT AN EASY CROSS-

2144
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:35,511
EXAMINATION. I 

2145
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:36,378
DON'T ENVY HER. 

2146
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:37,979
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T MIND DOING 

2147
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,047
IT BUT ITS GOING TO BE TOUGH. 

2148
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,215
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE STIGMA 

2149
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:49,658
REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WHEN 

2150
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,661
I TALK ABOUT JUDGE THOMAS TO MY 

2151
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:53,929
CHILDREN, THE FIRST THING THAT 

2152
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,397
COMES TO MIND, AND THE 

2153
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,565
ALLEGATIONS WERE NOT AS 

2154
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:57,299
SERIOUS, WAS A COKE CAN. 

2155
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:58,667
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT EVERY 

2156
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:03,038
TIME. 

2157
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:03,939
JUST IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN 

2158
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,173
IF KAVANAUGH BECAME A SUPREME 

2159
01:14:05,173 --> 01:14:09,745
COURT JUSTICE. 

2160
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:12,747
>> CAN I ASK, WHAT SHOULD WE, 

2161
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:14,450
THE PUBLIC, BE LOOKING FOR WHEN 

2162
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,284
WE WATCH THE CROSS-EXAMINATION. 

2163
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:18,287
NOT BY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 

2164
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,923
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE WILL BE A 

2165
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,558
LEVEL OF POLITICS, BUT FROM 

2166
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:23,425
THIS PERSON THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY 

2167
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:24,259
MEANT TO BE BIPARTISAN OR 

2168
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:30,332
NEUTRAL, BUT SHOULD WE LOOK FOR 

2169
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,935
AND TO YOUR POINT, SHE CAN BE 

2170
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:33,168
TOUGH. 

2171
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,403
I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTS 

2172
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,805
HER TO NOT BE TOUGH BUT WHAT 

2173
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:38,973
SHOULD WE LOOK FOR AS WE LISTEN 

2174
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:40,509
TO HER AND HER QUESTIONS AND 

2175
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,711
PROBING TO INDICATE THAT SHE IS 

2176
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:43,812
BEING FAIR? 

2177
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,080
WHAT WOULD BE A RED FLAG TO 

2178
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,481
SUGGEST SHE IS NOT BEING FAIR. 

2179
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:48,083
TO EITHER DR. FORD OR JUDGE 

2180
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:51,286
KAVANAUGH. 

2181
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,087
JULIE? 

2182
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,623
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, VINOO, 

2183
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:55,924
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS ONE? 

2184
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:57,559
>> I WILL GO. 

2185
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:03,732
I THINK THE PROSECUTOR THAT IS 

2186
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:04,700
GOING TO DO THE QUESTIONING, 

2187
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,301
SHE'S GOT TO GATHER 

2188
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:09,071
INFORMATION. 

2189
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,172
THAT IS PART OF IT. 

2190
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:13,675
JULIE RAISES A GOOD POINT THAT 

2191
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,912
THERE MAY BE OTHER PEOPLE THAT 

2192
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:17,545
YOU TALKED TO. 

2193
01:15:17,545 --> 01:15:20,449
THIS IS A TOUGH POSITION FOR 

2194
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:20,816
THE PROSECUTOR. 

2195
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:21,650
MOST OF THE TIME, THE 

2196
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,718
PROSECUTORS HAVE HAD BACKGROUND 

2197
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:26,221
INFORMATION AND IT DOESN'T 

2198
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:27,556
APPEAR THEY WILL HAVE THAT 

2199
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:32,694
OPPORTUNITY HERE. 

2200
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,463
WHAT THEY WILL LOOK FOR IS 

2201
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:35,163
EVASIVENESS, THE ABILITY TO 

2202
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,064
ANSWER QUESTIONS, DIRECT 

2203
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:39,735
QUESTIONS. 

2204
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:40,635
WHY DIDN'T SHE GO FORWARD? 

2205
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:41,436
WHERE WERE YOU DURING THIS 

2206
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:42,938
PERIOD WHEN HE WAS UP FOR 

2207
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:48,110
SENATE CONFIRMATION AND BECAME 

2208
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,377
A JUDGE AS A CIRCUIT COURT 

2209
01:15:49,377 --> 01:15:50,512
JUDGE? 

2210
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:58,487
I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE. 

2211
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:00,522
THERE HAVE BEEN SIX FBI 

2212
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:01,657
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT 

2213
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,258
KAVANAUGH HAS GONE THROUGH 

2214
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:03,725
PREVIOUSLY. 

2215
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,895
YOU'VE GOT TO RE-EXAMINE THOSE 

2216
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:07,128
CHECKS. 

2217
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,563
I DON'T THINK REPUBLICANS OR 

2218
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:10,966
DEMOCRATS SHOULD PROCEED WITHOUT

2219
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:11,966
RE-EXAMINING THOSE CHECKS. 

2220
01:16:11,966 --> 01:16:14,403
DID THESE PEOPLE COME INTO THE 

2221
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,271
CROSSHAIRS OF THE FBI 

2222
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:16,571
PREVIOUSLY? 

2223
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:18,874
WERE THEY EVER QUESTION? 

2224
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,408
OR, WERE PEOPLE AROUND THEM 

2225
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:20,675
QUESTION? 

2226
01:16:20,675 --> 01:16:23,311
IF PEOPLE AROUND THEM WERE 

2227
01:16:23,311 --> 01:16:24,479
QUESTIONED AND THERE WAS NO 

2228
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,314
ALLEGATIONS OF THIS WAY BACK 

2229
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:26,982
WHEN, AND PRESUMABLY THERE 

2230
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,016
WASN'T BECAUSE IT NEVER CAME UP 

2231
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,951
WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED TO BE THE 

2232
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:37,025
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE, IF 

2233
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,727
THEY WERE NEARBY OR AVAILABLE 

2234
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,896
TO BE QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T THIS 

2235
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:41,829
COME UP EARLIER? 

2236
01:16:41,829 --> 01:16:44,332
THE QUESTION IS, WHY DIDN'T IT 

2237
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:44,599
COME UP? 

2238
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:46,635
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

2239
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,303
FOR 30 YEARS? 

2240
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,672
LISTEN, THERE CAN BE SYMPATHY TO

2241
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:52,841
A POINT BUT IT HAS TO BE VETTED 

2242
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,543
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT 

2243
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:55,410
EVERYTHING AROUND IT AND WHY 

2244
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,445
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION IS 

2245
01:16:56,445 --> 01:17:03,351
THERE AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. 

2246
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,419
>> RACHEL MITCHELL WILL ALSO 

2247
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,254
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 

2248
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,155
TYPICALLY, ONE OF THE HALLMARKS 

2249
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:08,323
OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IS THAT 

2250
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,292
TYPICALLY THE JUDGE IS SOMEWHAT 

2251
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,028
EVASIVE AND THEY ARE VAGUE 

2252
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:14,663
ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND ON HOT 

2253
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,030
BUTTON ISSUES. 

2254
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,664
HE WAS PARTICULARLY SKILLFUL 

2255
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:19,767
AND THAT WON'T FLY, RIGHT? 

2256
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:24,539
>> I DON'T THINK HE WILL BE 

2257
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:24,772
VAGUE. 

2258
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:28,644
IF HE'S VAGUE HERE, HE'S DONE. 

2259
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:29,845
I THINK HE WILL BE UNEQUIVOCAL 

2260
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:34,683
HERE, AS HE HAS BEEN IN HIS 

2261
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:35,584
QUOTES. I 

2262
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,553
WOULD BE SHOCKED IF IT GETS TO 

2263
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:38,853
THAT POINT. 

2264
01:17:38,853 --> 01:17:40,922
I THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING 

2265
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,324
ON FOR THIS TO CONTINUE. 

2266
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,292
>> LET ME READ THE TWEET FROM 

2267
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:44,659
THE PRESIDENT. 

2268
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:45,593
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED A MINUTE 

2269
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:50,699
AGO. 

2270
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:51,633
MICHAEL AVENATTI IS A THIRD-

2271
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,269
RATE LAWYER WHO IS GOOD AT 

2272
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,303
MAKING FALSE ACCUSATIONS LIKE 

2273
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,672
HE DID ON ME AND LIKE HE IS NOW 

2274
01:17:57,672 --> 01:17:59,541
DOING ON JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

2275
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,477
HE IS JUST LOOKING FOR 

2276
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,678
ATTENTION AND DOESN'T WANT 

2277
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:05,480
PEOPLE TO LOOK AT HIS PAST 

2278
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,282
RECORD AND RELATIONSHIPS, A 

2279
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:08,216
TOTAL LOW LIFE. 

2280
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:08,984
OKAY. 

2281
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:09,985
THAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 

2282
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:10,518
RESPONSE, THUS FAR. 

2283
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:11,987
JULIE, YOU WERE GOING TO PICK 

2284
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:14,122
IT UP? 

2285
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:15,857
>> I HOPE TO GOSH I DON'T HAVE 

2286
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,125
TO RESPOND TO THAT. 

2287
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:20,395
>> THAT'S OKAY. 

2288
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:24,299
>> IT ONLY SEEKS TO CONFOUND. 

2289
01:18:24,299 --> 01:18:27,368
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE 

2290
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:29,471
LOOKING FOR, REMEMBER THAT ANY 

2291
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:32,274
TIME YOU ARE CROSS-EXAMINING 

2292
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,176
SOMEONE, YOU ARE NEUTRAL AND 

2293
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:35,710
LOOKING TO CATCH THEM IN A 

2294
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,311
LIVE. 

2295
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:37,245
WEATHER FOR POLITICAL REASONS 

2296
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,381
OR THAT YOU ARE PROSECUTORS WHO 

2297
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,949
BELIEVE SOMEONE IS GUILTY OR 

2298
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,150
NOT GUILTY, YOU HAVE AN AGENDA 

2299
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:45,854
WHEN YOU CROSS-EXAMINE SOMEONE. 

2300
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,589
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE MOST 

2301
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:49,524
IMPORTANT AND PRESSING ISSUE IS 

2302
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,059
WHY SHE DIDN'T COME FORWARD 

2303
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:51,726
SOONER. 

2304
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,428
THE PRESSING ISSUE IS HER 

2305
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:54,962
ABILITY TO REMEMBER OR NOT 

2306
01:18:54,962 --> 01:18:55,330
REMEMBER. 

2307
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,098
WAS SHE DRINKING? 

2308
01:18:57,098 --> 01:18:58,900
THESE ARE QUESTIONS YOU WILL 

2309
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,503
WANT TO ASK BECAUSE IF SHE'S 

2310
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,537
DRINKING, DOES THAT IMPAIR HER 

2311
01:19:03,537 --> 01:19:05,440
ABILITY TO REMEMBER? 

2312
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,374
THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT WILL BE 

2313
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,642
RELEVANT TO DETERMINE WHETHER 

2314
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:08,810
SHE GOT IT RIGHT IN HER 

2315
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:16,752
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT OCCURRED. I

2316
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,821
THINK THE SECOND ISSUE IS BIAS. 

2317
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:21,923
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE 

2318
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,226
NATURE OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH 

2319
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,527
HIM OR HER POLITICAL VIEWS THAT 

2320
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,328
MAY IMPACT HER ABILITY TO BE 

2321
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:28,997
FULLY HONEST? 

2322
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,499
THE MINUTE YOU START GOING DOWN 

2323
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:34,770
THE ROAD OF SAYING SHE DIDN'T 

2324
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,772
COME FORWARD, AS SUGGESTED, THIS

2325
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,439
ISN'T SYMPATHY. 

2326
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:39,975
THERE ARE FACTS THAT WE'VE 

2327
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:42,978
TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF 

2328
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:44,312
STATISTICALLY WHY INDIVIDUALS 

2329
01:19:44,312 --> 01:19:46,414
DON'T COME FORWARD AND WE SAW 

2330
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:47,415
IT IN BILL COSBY, HARVEY 

2331
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:48,382
WEINSTEIN AND IN THE CATHOLIC 

2332
01:19:48,382 --> 01:19:48,616
CHURCH. 

2333
01:19:48,616 --> 01:19:51,286
THAT IS NOT ABOUT SYMPATHY, 

2334
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,922
IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE 

2335
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,223
DON'T COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF 

2336
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,324
THREAT OF RETALIATION, 

2337
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,225
EMBARRASSMENT AND THE LIKE. 

2338
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,693
IT'S FUNNY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT 

2339
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:58,893
IT. 

2340
01:19:58,893 --> 01:20:01,062
I WAS SPEAKING TO A FAMILY 

2341
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,531
MEMBER THE OTHER DAY AND FOR 

2342
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,632
THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT UP 

2343
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,033
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME. 

2344
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:11,806
IT DIDN'T COME INTO MY MIND. 

2345
