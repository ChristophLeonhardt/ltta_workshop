1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,720
Warren Buffett isn't like most CEOs.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,750
He runs one of the few true conglomerates
left in America -- Berkshire Hathaway.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,700
Berkshire is a massive insurance company,
manufacturer, railroad operator, investor

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,090
and much more.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,210
Buffett himself is worth about $74 billion,
which makes him the fourth-richest person

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,210
in the world.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:27,140
Yet he lives in Omaha, Nebraska -- not some
fancy coastal mansion.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,640
But one of the biggest things that sets Buffett
apart is that he doesn't always play by the

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,090
same rules as the other guys.

10
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,820
And nobody really questions him.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,590
There is good reason for this.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:44,640
Buffett has delivered a nearly 2 million percent
stock price gain since he took over Berkshire

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,470
50 years ago.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,980
Plus he's got this folksy image that adds
to his aura of trustworthiness.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:56,080
But Buffett turns 87 this year, and so lately
there's a lot of talk about what Berkshire

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,950
will be like without him.

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:03,360
You can count on one thing: The opaque culture
he's created is a luxury that won't be afforded

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,250
to Buffett's successor --
whether that's Greg Abel or Ajit Jain or some

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,190
other candidate.Many have been rumoted over
the years, but Abel and Jain are seen as Buffett's

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,530
two favorites right now.

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,510
Should he ever decide to step away though,
there will be the issue of transparency.

22
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,680
Berkshire Hathaway owns all these disparate
businesses,

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,300
but aside from the biggest ones
shareholders really only get a high-level

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,030
glimpse at their performance each quarter.

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,300
And forget the common practice of quarterly
earnings calls -- Buffett doesn't do those

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,630
It doesn't really bother investors now.

27
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,850
But they'll demand more from Buffett's replacement.

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,190
Another big issue will be Berkshire's pile
of cash.

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:49,970
It sits at about $260 billion, a figure that
continues to climb.

30
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,200
Buffett uses the money for acquisitions and
investments at his discretion, which produce

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,530
better returns than, say, paying a dividend.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,730
In fact, Buffett is firmly against paying
a dividend.

33
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,740
But that could be one of the first changes
we see.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,580
Berkshire may very well pay out some of its
cash to shareholders under the next CEO to

35
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,899
appease weary shareholders.

36
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,970
It could look like a very different company
in those respects, but that's not necessarily

37
00:02:14,970 --> 00:00:00,000
a bad thing.
