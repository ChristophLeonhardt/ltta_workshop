1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,101
could make history.

2
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,469
What's in your wallet?

00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,711
>> Tucker: WE ARE CONTINUING

DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA.

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,349
YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RUSSIA

8
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,884
BUT YOU ALSO BECOME KNOWN FOR

9
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,785
YOUR POSITION ON GUNS AND YOU

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,753
ARE ONE OF THE VERY FEW

11
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,487
DEMOCRATS I THINK WHO HAS BEEN

12
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,356
HONEST ABOUT THAT.

13
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,393
YOU SAY THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,894

16
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,896
ABOUT THIS.

17
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,967
THIS IS NOT A SECRET OF    VIEW

18
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,000

MILITARY STYLE SEMIAUTOMATIC

22
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,306
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

23
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,107
WE SHOULD BUY BACK SUCH WEAPONS

24
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,976
FROM ALL WHO CHOOSE TO ABIDE BY

25
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,210
THE LAW AND WE SHOULD CRIMINALLY

26
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,179
PROSECUTE ANY WHO CHOOSE TO DEFY

27
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,914
IT BY KEEPING THEIR WEAPONS.

28
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,384
SO WE SHOULD CONFISCATE?

29
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,186
>> THIS ENTIRE CLASS OF

30
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:53,553
FIREARMS.

31
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,821
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN

32
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,555
IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRIED

33
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,158
TO DO THAT?

34
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,892
>> DID YOU READ THE OP-ED?

35
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,028
>> Tucker: I JUST QUOTED IT

36
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,796

00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:05,932
INVEST IN A BUYBACK.

40
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,767

KEEP THEM THERE WHERE IT'S SAFE,

44
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,641
NOT ON OUR STREETS, AND IF YOU

45
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,709
ARE CAUGHT, JUST LIKE IF YOU

46
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,877
WERE CAUGHT WITH DRUGS OR

47
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,379
ANYTHING ELSE, THEY HAVE

48
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,513
PROBABLE CAUSE TO GO INTO YOUR

THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

72
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,621

PLANS TO COMMIT A CRIME.

75
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,524
HE WOULD INSTANTLY TURN THEM

INTO FAMILIES.

77
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,360
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A

MEANINGFUL, WHAT YOU SAID.

92
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,214
WEAPONS COULD BE BOUGHT BACK OR

93
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,582
KEEP THEM AT A GUN CLUB.

94
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,717
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE IT UP BUT

95
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,185
KEEP THEM AT A GUN CLUB.

WRONG, YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANYBODY

98
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,355
AND YOU JUST MADE THEM INTO

99
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,990
FELONS.

100

I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP, YOU

WROTE THAT.

107

CLUB, I FEEL LIKE KEEPING IT IN

112
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,237

PASS A BAND LIKE THIS.

122
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,585
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE PASSED BY A

123
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:05,952
MAJORITY.

124
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,255

THEY ARE POLICE OFFICERS, THEY

THEY ARE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL.

150
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,896
THEY HEAR A BOOK DROPPED, THEY

151
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,197
THINK A SHOOTER IS WALKING INTO

152
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:51,764
THE CLASSROOM.

153
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,666
DON'T THEY DESERVE TO BE

YOU DON'T ACTUALLY CARE MORE

162

SAME FIREARM AT HOME THAT YOUR

178
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,382

>> THAT'S A RIDICULOUS ARGUMENT.

180
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,751
IT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

181
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,385
>> Tucker: BECAUSE YOU ARE

182
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,587
MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME?

00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,663
OUR MILITARY SHOULDN'T BE

191
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,030
OUTGUNNED.

192
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,264
>> Tucker: WHY DON'T WE JUST

193
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,232
LIMIT THEM TO THE SAME GUNS I

194
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,266
CAN HAVE AT HOME?

195
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,768
>> WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A REAL

196
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,870
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS?

197
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,638
>> Tucker: THIS IS A REAL

198
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:06,639
CONVERSATION.

199
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,840
>> YOU ARE CALLING COPS

200
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,209
BODYGUARDS, AND THAT'S

201
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:09,642
DISRESPECTFUL.

202
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,010
THEY WERE ALL HERE IN TOWN

203
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,812
HONORING THE FALLEN AND YOU ARE

204
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,413
CALLING THEM BODYGUARDS.

205
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,415
MY DAD WAS A COP, HE'S NOT A

206
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,015
BODYGUARD.

207
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,217
HE PROTECTS PEOPLE.

208
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:17,984
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

209
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,587
>> Tucker: TO MEMBERS OF

210
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,621
CONGRESS HAVE BODYGUARDS?

211
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,789
>> THAT IS SO DISRESPECTFUL.

212
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,290
>> Tucker: THEY ARE.

213
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,193
THE GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THEM.

214
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,561
>> THEY PROTECT YOU AND YOUR

215
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,362
KIDS AND OUR FAMILIES.

216
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,096
>> Tucker: CAN I GET THE SAME

217
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,834
IN MY OFFICE IN THE TEXT PAYERS

218
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,669
CAN PAY FOR IT?

219
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,839
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

220
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,908
IF I WALKED ON THE OFFICE, GREAT

221
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:45,578
GUYS, I'M NOT ATTACKING THEM.

222
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,779
THEY ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK AT

223
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,380
ALL.

224
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,648
I'M MERELY SAYING THAT YOU HAVE

225
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,984
BETTER PROTECTION THAN I DO.

226
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,385
AND YOU ARE SAYING THAT MY

227
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,187
FAMILY DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE A

228
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:54,988
CERTAIN SPECIES OF WEAPON.

229
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,689
YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT WE CAN

230
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,590
PROTECT OURSELVES WITH BUT YOU

231
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,393
ARE NOT GOING TO IN ANY WAY TAKE

232
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,628
THE ABILITY TO PROTECT YOU AWAY

233
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,831
FROM THE CAPITAL POLICE.

234
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,232
>> I'M SAYING EVERY POLICE

235
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,467
OFFICER IN AMERICA IS OUTGUNNED.

236
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,702
FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THE PEOPLE

237
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,470
THEY PROTECT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE

238
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,039
ASSAULT WEAPONS.

239
00:06:13,039 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO YOU.
