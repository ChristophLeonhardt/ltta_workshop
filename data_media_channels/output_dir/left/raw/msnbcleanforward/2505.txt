MATTHEWS, HOST OF "HARDBALL" RIGHT HERE ON MSNBC.

5
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:07,931
RIGHT HERE ON MSNBC. TOM, LET ME GET TO YOU ON WHAT

6
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,667
TOM, LET ME GET TO YOU ON WHAT THIS SHIFT -- WHAT ANOTHER TRUMP

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,403
THIS SHIFT -- WHAT ANOTHER TRUMP APPOINTMENT IN REPLACEMENT OF

8
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,638
APPOINTMENT IN REPLACEMENT OF KENNEDY -- WOULD MEAN FOR THE

9
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,138
KENNEDY -- WOULD MEAN FOR THE BALANCE OF POWER.

10
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,440
BALANCE OF POWER. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUPREME COURT

11
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,643
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUPREME COURT PICKS AND SUPREME COURT CASES

12
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,011
PICKS AND SUPREME COURT CASES INVARIABLY WE GO TO ABORTION,

13
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,346
INVARIABLY WE GO TO ABORTION, THE ROE VERSUS WADE, TO THE

14
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,414
THE ROE VERSUS WADE, TO THE LONGEVITY OF THAT DECISION.

15
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,150
LONGEVITY OF THAT DECISION. A TRUMP PICK TO REPLACE ANTHONY

16
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,119
A TRUMP PICK TO REPLACE ANTHONY KENNEDY, DOES IT HAVE THE

17
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,254
KENNEDY, DOES IT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE ROE VERSUS

18
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,055
POTENTIAL TO CHANGE ROE VERSUS WADE AS WE KNOW IT?

19
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,523
WADE AS WE KNOW IT? >> IT’S LIKELY TO.

20
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,225
>> IT’S LIKELY TO. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ROE

21
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,627
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ROE WOULD BE OVERRULED OR INSTEAD

22
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,130
WOULD BE OVERRULED OR INSTEAD REDUCED IN ITS SCOPE SO STATES

23
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,865
REDUCED IN ITS SCOPE SO STATES COULD PASS ABORTION

24
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,265
COULD PASS ABORTION RESTRICTIONS.

25
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,666
RESTRICTIONS. IT WOULD BE SHOCKING IF A

26
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,402
IT WOULD BE SHOCKING IF A NOMINEE TO REPLACE JUSTICE

27
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,437
NOMINEE TO REPLACE JUSTICE KENNEDY WASN’T MORE INCLINED TO

28
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,872
KENNEDY WASN’T MORE INCLINED TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF ROE VERSUS

29
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:49,272
LIMIT THE SCOPE OF ROE VERSUS WADE.

30
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,709
WADE. SO, TOO, WITH OTHER DECISIONS OF

31
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,476
SO, TOO, WITH OTHER DECISIONS OF THOSE PERMITTING AFFIRMATIVE

32
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,178
THOSE PERMITTING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, AND LIKE YOU SUGGESTED

33
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,779
ACTION, AND LIKE YOU SUGGESTED LIMITING THE DEATH PENALTY.

34
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,514
LIMITING THE DEATH PENALTY. THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THESE

35
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:57,881
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF THESE QUESTIONS.

36
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,484
QUESTIONS. WHILE JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS

37
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,019
WHILE JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS CONSERVATIVE HE WAS THE LIMITING

38
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,288
CONSERVATIVE HE WAS THE LIMITING AGENT, THE BARRIER TO TAKING A

39
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,656
AGENT, THE BARRIER TO TAKING A BIG LEAP TO THE RIGHT IN

40
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,390
BIG LEAP TO THE RIGHT IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

41
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,058
AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. >> ELABORATE ON THAT IF YOU

42
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,358
>> ELABORATE ON THAT IF YOU COULD.

43
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,393
COULD. WE HEAR ABOUT HIM AS THE SWING

44
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:10,694
WE HEAR ABOUT HIM AS THE SWING VOTE.

45
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,696
VOTE. THIS WE CAN I THINK WE SAW A

46
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,897
THIS WE CAN I THINK WE SAW A COUPLE OF EXAMPLE WHERE IS HE

47
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:14,931
COUPLE OF EXAMPLE WHERE IS HE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT.

48
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,200
SWUNG TO THE RIGHT. MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN

49
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,502
MAYBE IF YOU HAVE A REPUBLICAN PICK FROM TRUMP HERE, THE RULING

50
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,337
PICK FROM TRUMP HERE, THE RULING WOULD END UP THE SAME.

51
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,972
WOULD END UP THE SAME. WHERE ARE THE ONES WHERE THE

52
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,474
WHERE ARE THE ONES WHERE THE BALANCE OF POWER COULD SHIFT

53
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,109
BALANCE OF POWER COULD SHIFT HERE, WHERE THIS SWING VOTE

54
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,512
HERE, WHERE THIS SWING VOTE BEING REPLACED BY POTENTIALLY

55
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:31,615
BEING REPLACED BY POTENTIALLY DOCTRINE AIRRE CONSERVATIVE

56
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,084
DOCTRINE AIRRE CONSERVATIVE WHERE THE DECISION MOVE TOWARD

57
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,586
WHERE THE DECISION MOVE TOWARD THE RIGHT.

58
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,824
THE RIGHT. >> CONSERVATIVE IS PROBABLY THE

59
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:40,224
>> CONSERVATIVE IS PROBABLY THE WRONG LABEL.

60
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:43,160
WRONG LABEL. I WASN’T THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY

61
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,230
I WASN’T THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY COULDN’T GO BACK AND FORTH ON

62
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,433
COULDN’T GO BACK AND FORTH ON DIFFERENT ISSUES.

63
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,402
DIFFERENT ISSUES. GAY MARRIAGE, GAY RIGHTS IN THE

64
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,738
GAY MARRIAGE, GAY RIGHTS IN THE EMPLOYMENT SPACE, WHEN IT CAME

65
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,140
EMPLOYMENT SPACE, WHEN IT CAME TO EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION.

66
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,342
TO EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. HE RESERVED THE CORE OF ROE

67
00:01:58,386 --> 00:01:59,009
HE RESERVED THE CORE OF ROE VERSUS WADE.

68
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,044
VERSUS WADE. GUN RIGHTS.

69
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,647
GUN RIGHTS. THE COURT SAID THERE IS A RIGHT

70
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,048
THE COURT SAID THERE IS A RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

71
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:05,816
TO BEAR ARMS. BUT NOT A PARTICULAR RIGHT FOR

72
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,852
BUT NOT A PARTICULAR RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE, TO HAVE CONCEALED

73
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:08,352
EXAMPLE, TO HAVE CONCEALED CARRY.

74
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:10,955
CARRY. IN THE DEATH PENALTY HE WAS THE

75
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,057
IN THE DEATH PENALTY HE WAS THE PIVOTAL VOTE WHO SAID WE WILL

76
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,026
PIVOTAL VOTE WHO SAID WE WILL NOT EXECUTE SOMEONE WHO

77
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,160
NOT EXECUTE SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED A CRIME WHILE THEY

78
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,829
COMMITTED A CRIME WHILE THEY WERE A MINOR OR UNABLE TO UNDER

79
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,431
WERE A MINOR OR UNABLE TO UNDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY

80
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:20,665
THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY DID.

81
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,600
DID. THOSE ISSUES, AND PARTS OF

82
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,969
THOSE ISSUES, AND PARTS OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW, THE LAW

83
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,637
CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW, THE LAW CAN MOVE DISTINCTLY TO THE RIGHT

84
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,440
CAN MOVE DISTINCTLY TO THE RIGHT AND AS YOU SUGGESTED FOR LONG

85
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:29,740
AND AS YOU SUGGESTED FOR LONG TIME.

86
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,842
TIME. A PRESIDENT CAN COME IN AND

87
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,043
A PRESIDENT CAN COME IN AND REPLACE THE POLICIES OF DONALD

88
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:34,445
REPLACE THE POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP AFTER THE NEXT

89
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,581
TRUMP AFTER THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

90
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,282
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BUT A SUPREME COURT IS THERE

91
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,017
BUT A SUPREME COURT IS THERE THESE DAYS A MINIMUM OF A

92
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,884
THESE DAYS A MINIMUM OF A QUARTER CENTURY.

93
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:41,586
QUARTER CENTURY. >> THE PRESIDENT MADE REFERENCE

94
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,788
>> THE PRESIDENT MADE REFERENCE TO A LIST OF 25 NAMES THAT’S

95
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:45,990
TO A LIST OF 25 NAMES THAT’S BEEN OUT THERE, POTENTIAL

96
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,159
BEEN OUT THERE, POTENTIAL NOMINEES FROM THE 2016 CAMPAIGN.

97
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,594
NOMINEES FROM THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES THAT

98
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,296
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NAMES THAT ARE IN CIRCULATION, WHAT WE SAW

99
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,565
ARE IN CIRCULATION, WHAT WE SAW WITH THE GORSUCH PICK, HOW THAT

100
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:54,299
WITH THE GORSUCH PICK, HOW THAT CAME TOGETHER.

101
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,334
CAME TOGETHER. ARE WE LOOKING AT BASICALLY A

102
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:58,103
ARE WE LOOKING AT BASICALLY A COOKIE CUTTER MODEL HERE WHERE

103
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:02,874
COOKIE CUTTER MODEL HERE WHERE THEY ARE ALL LIKELY TO BE THE

104
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,210
THEY ARE ALL LIKELY TO BE THE SAME ITIO LOGICALLY OR ARE THERE

105
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,011
SAME ITIO LOGICALLY OR ARE THERE ANY WILD CARDS?

106
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,279
ANY WILD CARDS? >> I THINK IT IS CUTIE COOTER

107
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:08,813
>> I THINK IT IS CUTIE COOTER AND CONSERVATIVES THINK IT

108
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:09,814
AND CONSERVATIVES THINK IT TASTES REALLY GOOD.

109
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:11,449
TASTES REALLY GOOD. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FARM

110
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:12,917
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FARM TEAM THAT THE BUSH

111
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,519
TEAM THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PUT IN PLACE TEN

112
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,287
ADMINISTRATION PUT IN PLACE TEN YEARS AGO AND REPUBLICAN

113
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,122
YEARS AGO AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS FOR EXAMPLE, IN TECH

114
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,123
GOVERNORS FOR EXAMPLE, IN TECH DID THE SAME THING.

115
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,425
DID THE SAME THING. THEY HAVE A GROUP OF NOMINEES

116
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,093
THEY HAVE A GROUP OF NOMINEES WHO THEY AROUND REALLY CONCERNED

117
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:23,929
WHO THEY AROUND REALLY CONCERNED WILL COME ONTO THE SUPREME COURT

118
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:26,331
WILL COME ONTO THE SUPREME COURT AND DRIFT TO THE LEFT LIKE A LOT

119
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:29,701
AND DRIFT TO THE LEFT LIKE A LOT OF OUR JUSTICES, LIKE RETIRED

120
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,603
OF OUR JUSTICES, LIKE RETIRED JUSTICE DAVID SUTER DID.

121
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,239
JUSTICE DAVID SUTER DID. I DON’T THINK THERE IS A HUGE

122
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:34,639
I DON’T THINK THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

123
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,808
DIFFERENCE. IN ANY INDIVIDUAL CASE THERE CAN

124
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,444
IN ANY INDIVIDUAL CASE THERE CAN BE BUT ON THE CORE ISSUES LIKE

125
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,179
BE BUT ON THE CORE ISSUES LIKE ABORTION, GAY RIGHTS, CAMPAIGN

126
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,148
ABORTION, GAY RIGHTS, CAMPAIGN FINANCE RIGHTS, THEY ARE GOING

127
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,249
FINANCE RIGHTS, THEY ARE GOING TO BE SIMILAR AND GOING TO BE A

128
00:03:44,292 --> 00:00:00,000
TO BE SIMILAR AND GOING TO BE A STEP TO THE RIGHT OF JUSTICE
