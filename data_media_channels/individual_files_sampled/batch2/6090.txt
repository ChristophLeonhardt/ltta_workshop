so CNN and Politico and a lot of other organizations covered the Tuesday elections some more fairly than others and in Tuesday's elections for progressives there were some excellent wins there were some disheartening losses and it was a mixed bag and if you reported that way that is true so I'm gonna give you the full context here first let's go to CNN's reporting they say Alexandria Cortes movement failed to deliver any stunners Tuesday night now I don't love the word fail in in the title it seems like it is not mixed news it makes it seem like it's totally terrible news that it was a failure but when you go to the text of the article it's not as bad so they say there were no major surprises I would argue that Jamie's schoolcraft winning was a very nice surprise I'll tell you about him in a second Rashidah Talib was in fifth place and went to first I would argue that was a surprise but it's not an overly offensive thing to say it's if if off it's off by a little bit they explain that another Sanders in Ocasio Cortes favored James Thomson won comfortably so that at least gives some context for some of the victories so that's also good I'm trying to be fair here and giving you all sides the the negative and the positive for how this coverage went in the mainstream media and then they explain the most heartening results for a leftist came in Michigan's 13th congressional district where a former state lawmaker Rasheeda Talib outlasted a crowded field that's good that's great so they mentioned Thompson and they mentioned Talib so now overall they painted one of general failure they mentioned two of the winners you know I guess my expectations for the mainstream media is low enough that I found that almost to be a relief Politico of course was far far worse lately The Associated Press which should be the bastion of objectivity has been unfortunately quite bad at how they report on progressives and I would argue a in fact biased now so but I want to give full context here so it's not true that the overall denied was a bad one in fact there are great many victories for progressives throughout the night including for working families party our revolution which we'll get to in a second P trip will see and and certainly the just Democrats and McCulloch was defeated in Missouri he would he's one of the worst prosecutors in the country and he's the one that basically helped the police evade justice in the Michael Brown case so that was a great victory for progressives but just on justice Democrats alone there was thirteen races one is still not decided believe it or not in Washington's ninth district so the twelve that had been decided if you looked at the CNN article you would have gotten the impression that the just Democrats lost the overwhelming majority but that is not true they actually went six for twelve so they went literally won half the races that actually sounds pretty good so let me show you the winners just to help out here James Thomson as they mentioned in Kansas fourth a great victory closed what was a twenty seven point victory for the Republicans in that district and a special election down is six and now that he's won is primary anything is in great shape to actually win that race in the general election and he has moved on Matt Morgan in Michigan's first district another Joseph Democrat and that means no corporate PAC money and a progressive platform also won Rob Davison Michigan's second district also won now those races were were not surprises that is true okay now let James Thompson with a nice solid victory but he was also expected to win Rasheeda Talib was definitely a surprise certainly from the beginning of the process like I said she was in fifth place she kept moving up moving out moving up and eventually winning a very close race so that's the victory number for the person they didn't mention at all as Jamie Schoolcraft now I think that's the most interesting case he's in Missouri seventh he was outspent two-to-one so he barely won right Kazak you already know he's a winner no he didn't barely win he won by thirty points I would count that as a significant surprise how much coverage has Jaime schoolcraft gotten outside of the Young Turks I don't know that he's gotten any coverage he won by 30 points after being massively outspent and the final victory was per millage i appalled she is an incumbent that was also not a surprise again to be fair to CNN but she is a justice Democrat and likely will be part of that caucus in in the next Congress so overall not terrible coverage by CNN and and they had some caveats in there but I thought obviously if you give the full context you see that there was significant progressive victories and overall the night was split and don't get me wrong I've already told you this for two days straight but I'll say it in the context of this stories too they were painful losses Cory Bush Brent welder Abdullah Saeed so there was some painful losses and someone wonderful victories that's the reality so now we go to Politico where you are not going to get the reality so they painted as a Bernie issue and their headline on surprising given that it's Politico and their enormous disdain and bias against Bernie Sanders is Bernie and his army are losing 2018 how's that for context okay and just in case you weren't clear on where they stand they are not going to give you the full picture instead in the body of the article they have lines like this over and over again Bernie Sanders is sputtering okay now Politico did a hit job on our revolution earlier again there emitted all their victories and only focused on their losses if you talk about their losses that's fair that's real we're not nobody's trying to cover that up but you should also talk about their wins that's called journalism what you're doing is as usual and I know that the people in Washington think this is crazy like oh my god but yes you are biased against progressives it's so obvious from all of your coverage Bernie said is losing sputtering our revolution disorganized I can't believe he has no organization plus he's not part of our revolution he set it up but he can't technically be involved in the organization you leave that out of your stories or you pointed out with no sense of irony or hypocrisy right so again and again Politico with their attacks against progressives so I don't care what the Republicans say and as a reporter you shouldn't care oh well the Republicans say we're liberals so we have a liberal bias so we're going to go out of our way to bash liberals does that sound like journalism to you that sounds like cowardice to me it certainly doesn't sound objective so again I'm gonna give you the full context here in a second they go on to say two years after his defeat in the 2016 presidential primary the Vermont senator has amassed a growing string of losses and races in which he has intervened this is so-called reporter David ciders and then they go on to say you get the whole sense of it here Sanders also campaigned for James Thompson who won is primary in a less competitive Kansas House District Tuesday and our revolution endorsed candidates have already won local contests elsewhere now I give you that because I'm trying to be fair to them that was their only caveat for lost just sputtering terrible all right James Thompson won and and I guess there's local election somewhere and they won some of those but anyway we're moving back to Sanders just Darrow ball can't win at all now look if you want to point out that Sanders supported Brent Walder Abdullah signed and they didn't win that's super fair that's what happened but if you don't talk about the victories well then I have to question whether you're a biased why are you leaving out the victories now it's not like political doesn't know the Bernie Sanders started our revolution they did a giant hit job just a little while ago saying that everything that our revolution did can be pinned on Bernie Sanders and it's Bernie Sanders fault you can go back and read that story that's a fact that they wrote that so why don't you look at how our revolution did on Tuesday night oh if you had asked them if you were an actual reporter you might have found out they won a lot of races so just like the just Democrats went about 50/50 they won six out of 12 that are decided our revolution back twenty four candidates on Tuesday night and guess how many of them won if you read Politico you might have thought one or you know or just no out of the twenty-four eleven one and for the races are not decided yet so since political apparently never bothered to ass our revolution or even just go to their website I'll read it to you so that I could educate Politico if you think that that sounds dismissive how do you think you sound to us so here you go if you actually bother do reporting you would find out the our revolution back James Thompson it obviously for US Congress in Kansas forth George Hanna and Kansas State House District 47 mark Bignell Michigan State Senate District 33 Rasheeda Talib in Michigan's thirteenth by the way they won on a very important issue and very decisively on no on Prop a the Missouri ballot measure that was really important to the unions in the working class in Missouri a resounding victory which Politico seems to have forgotten about in bashing our revolution and Bernie Sanders again in Adrienne plank Missouri Statehouse district 47 Mike Ellis Skelton Missouri State House District 50 Curtis Wilde Missouri State House District 107 / millage I appalled US Congress Washington 7th Victor min Horace Thurston County prosecutor in Washington Aaron Fraser Washington State House District 19 Jesse Lewis Washington state Senate District 6 so don't tell me that you do objective reporting because you don't you don't even do neutral reporting I used to criticize organizations like Politico because they was just saying oh well he said she said the Republicans say this Democrats say that I mean how would I know what am i a reporter no who cares what the Republicans say in the Democrats say what is the reality in this case if you were had the so-called liberal bias you want to talk about all the victories and not mention the losses at all we have a perspective we're progressive we're honest about that but you think we covered up the losses no those losses were really really painful we talked about him all night long but we also talked about the victories because unlike you we might have a perspective but we're not biased and we're not looking to cover up the truth because that wouldn't help our audience so what's your Excuse Politico so within the context of these and there's more where this came from in the mainstream media the CNN story seems benign I think they could have done a better job of giving context but I'm being fair to them whereas the political story was yet another hatchet job against Bernie Sanders and progressives are revolution and all these organizations because they're biased they don't like progressives almost all of their stories attack progressives and that's the reality and I just proved it and by the way since the last time I did the story about their last hatchet job I challenged them all right well show us any stories you wrote that was actually fair not positive not not something that skews artificially in favor of progressives just give me any story that you wrote that was in any way earned in a positive way or fair towards progressives nothing nothing when there's an opportunity to bash progresses political will show up every time when progressives have victories gee I wonder if you're biased Politico takes as from giant corporations all day long and this supports corporate politicians how dare you mention that bias how dare you that's our living we make all the money from these people who support the corporate politicians oh you're not allowed to point out our bias only the right wing is allowed to point out our non-existent bias your bias it's even it's not so much that they're right-wingers or that they're conservative it's that they cater to their advertisers they cater to corporations they cater to the status quo if anything they have a really deep-seated establishment bias if it comes from an established government official the White House the Pentagon a corporation as a politician someone they find official oh yes absolutely sir absolutely sir progressives are trying to challenge the establishment a sputtering law says I'm not going to tell you about their wins Politico is one of the worst organizations in mainstream media so don't believe the hype we're not like the right-wing we don't want the politicos of the world to be terrible at their job we want them to be good at their job we want good strong healthy journalism but it ain't
