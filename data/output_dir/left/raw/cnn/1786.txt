1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
time now for the Ridiculist it's been a
while but it's back in tonight we're

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,099
traveling to a magical land far far away
a place so special it's almost like it

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,610
doesn't even exist allow me to explain
today the President of the United States

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,179
of America was at a meeting of African
leaders at the United Nations when he

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,560
straight-up made up a country I'm
greatly honored to host this lunch to be

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,579
joined by the leaders of Cote d'Ivoire
Ethiopia Ghana Guinea nambia yeah he

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,380
said nambia now I know what you're
thinking he obviously meant Namibia just

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,260
a slip of the tongue it can happen to
anyone right mmm

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,870
no listen in Guinea and Nigeria you
fought a horrifying Ebola outbreak

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:54,390
Gambia's Health System is increasingly
self-sufficient he thinks there's a

11
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,199
place called nambia maybe it's a
combination of Namibia which is a real

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,379
place I've actually it's lovely I went
when there for Christmas one year and

13
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,210
Narnia which is not though I wish it
were and I would love to go there if I

14
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,470
could only fit through that wardrobe
here's a map right there take a look you

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,390
see Namibia and right near it are Angola
Zimbabwe there's Botswana in there or I

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,200
guess if you're the president you can
just say them however you want nambia

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,930
and go go as in booby boots Walla Walla
for instance I just want to remind you

18
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,310
he was speaking to African leaders oh
and by the way the president might want

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,950
to consider taking a little break from
checking his favorite app tonight

20
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,570
because the Twitter people there on this
just a few of our favorites nambia the

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,159
world's top producer of Gogh FA but they
got a bumper crop of calf FA this year

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,899
by tomorrow Kellyanne Conway will insist
nambia is real by November it will be in

23
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,450
Texas who studies textbooks another one
why did Barack Obama never visit hashtag

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,799
nambia hashtag nambia is truly beautiful
this time of year everyone should visit

25
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,530
at least once in their lives just take
psilocybin to get there I'm told

26
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,399
psilocybin is the fancy way of saying
magic mushrooms and if I can learn to

27
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,300
pronounce psilocybin for a frigging
ridiculous I think the president United

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,280
States
take the time to learn how to pronounce

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:00:00,000
the names of other countries or at least
the ones that exist
