recently Donald Trump signed the defense reauthorization Act and in that signing ceremony and in his speech he applauded himself and his White House for doing more for our troops and for our veterans but the reality is that there are a number of regulations that are put in place in order to protect our troops from predatory lending that the Trump administration wants to do away with and recently they have done away with something that would protect them something known as the military Lending Act they have decided to stop supervising financial institutions that continuously prey on our soldiers okay so let me give you the details of what's going on first there's McMullen II he is the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is the very Bureau that is supposed to be supervising predatory lenders to ensure that they're not going after our troops and essentially pressuring them to take out loans that they can't afford loans that usually have incredibly high interest rates well the bureau's supervisory staff typically conducted these checks to make sure that the lenders aren't charging military members exorbitant interest rates pushing them into forced arbitration or otherwise not following guidelines outlined in the military Lending Act a 2006 law that protects active duty military members and their families from financial fraud predatory loans and credit gouging so now the CFPB is saying yeah we're not really gonna supervise anymore you know like we're just gonna let these lenders do what they want to do it's true it's Omarosa has it on tape they sound exactly like that they don't have no I'm Rosa doesn't have it on tape but we do have tape featuring Mick Mulvaney very openly sharing what his thoughts are on the CFPB the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau remember he is the temporary head of the agency while the Trump administration looks for someone to take his place and so during Senate hearings here is what Mick Mulvaney had to say about the CFPB do you still believe that see if PB is a sad sick joke yes sir I do and I'll be happy to tell you why it is to me sir one of the most offensive concepts I think in a representative government which is almost completely unaccountable government bureaucracy so Mick Mulvaney goes to the CFPB again this is an agency that's incredibly important it was put together after the financial collapse in 2008 in order to protect consumers from predatory lending right and Mick Mulvaney goes in there and he's like yeah don't like any of this it's mantling it sorry and so that's what he's doing right now and so don't be fooled when you hear that the administration cares about our military cares about the troops cares about our veterans no they don't they care about the very financial institutions that fund their campaigns Mick Mulvaney stop donors include payday lenders and so of course he's gonna want to deregulate of course he's gonna want to stop supervising and protecting our troops from these predatory lenders I mean it's it's of course gonna happen so ok first of all the whole point is to protect consumers so if you're Republican are you proud or we're not protecting consumers anymore ok if you say well the average American I don't give a damn about them let the bankers crush them I don't know what kind of conservative you are it's not really a conservative position but in this case it's veterans and these scumbags the predatory lenders that's what they are target veterans at four times the rate of in a vs. so when you see a veteran you see someone you respect and that sacrifice for their country when they see a veteran they see a target they see a mark and Mick Mulvaney just came in and said have at it Hoss you want to target veterans there are a lot of veterans that are livid over this and and Army Colonel Paul Cantwell for example said why do you think we have people standing guard in the military and what he just did was he just took the people that were standing guard off the and just let people run in and and defraud our veterans any way they like basically and and that's his job and why is it his job who pays his bills the payday lenders the predatory lenders pay Mulvaney's campaign donations he works for them he doesn't work for you you think he cares about veterans you know he cares about his donors that's the only thing he cares about and it's not just veterans veterans are certainly included in you know these predatory tactics but this also involves active duty members of our military who oftentimes are very young they're out of high school they have no credit history and so since they're so young and financially inexperienced they are a prime target of these payday lenders of these you know predatory lenders of these institutions and so this military Act of 2006 was so important and luckily it's still in place and the whole point of that was to ensure that these scumbags don't continuously target them with insanely high unaffordable interest rates and so in 2015 the Obama administration really did beefed up that regulation to ensure that the CFPB was supervising these organizations to to prevent them from you know just leeching off of our military by the way the bureau now says that it will only be able to take action against lenders when it receives a complaint so they're not gonna do anything unless you know you go through the insane bureaucracy of reaching out to them and filing a complaint yeah and by that time is some of the veterans are and their advocates are pointing out it's too late your life's already been ruined they've already foreclosed on your house they've already taken everything you have etc now I'm gonna tell you in a second how much money that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had saved veterans and annas right active service members as well okay so it's a startling number that's the number that the bankers had ripped them off of and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gave them back okay and so I'm gonna say that for you in just a second but understand that's what they do they look out for the Servicemembers so the military Lending Act which was in place but actually when you proactively regulate as was happening this case it helped you to enforce the military Lending Act and that's why the bankers hated it because they couldn't more effectively rip off people who'd served in the military which again they found to be really easy marks so for whatever reason what the guidelines were you can't charge military members an annual interest rate of more than thirty six percent so it's not a tough standard thirty-six percent interest rate is gigantic donald trump bankrupted Taj Mahal because he took an interest alone that had too high an interest rate you know what it was fourteen percent and and it was totally untenable and unsustainable but yeah they're willing to charge that to our service members enter average American citizens and we're keeping him down to thirty six percent if we didn't have this law they sometimes to charge up to three hundred percent so then the other provisions they can't push them into forced arbitration this forced arbitration is rigged in favor of corporations often times they can't require them to a lot portions of paychecks to pay back their loans so that means they would just start taking it out of the service members checks if they couldn't pay it back but they might need that money for family for their food for their family for rent otherwise they might be homeless etc but they would just grab their paychecks and the military lending I prohibited that okay and the last one was creditors can't charge a penalty for early payment now that's mental if I have the money and I'm willing to pay you so I don't have to keep paying that ridiculous interest rate why can't I just pay you they said no I'm gonna charge you a penalty for being a good guy and paying ahead I don't know why because they want their interest yes because they want to rob you blind so the military Lending Act is great and what is it it's regulation to protect veterans and servicemembers so then on top of that it was regulated in a way that they didn't wait for your life to be ruined they were proactive so what did that do how much does that save proponents of the system say that it worked out well and they say that the agency says it delivered more than a hundred and thirty million dollars in relief to servicemembers since 2011 and handled more than 71,000 consumer complaints from men and their families is also taking enforcement actions after discovering lenders that broke the law so several layers of regulation that you see there what is the point of regulation it is just laws meant to protect you so you do regulation so that your local plant can't put toxic liquid into the nearby stream which your kids swim it that's a regulation in this case you regulate the predatory lenders so they don't prey on our servicemembers that's regulation you could do it before in the middle and after and there's different gradations of it and now make Mulvaney and the Trump administration said yeah don't worry about it let's see if they catch them afterwards they'll catch them for a lot less that's a hundred and thirty million dollars those lenders are gonna rob from our servicemembers do you support the troops or don't you support the troops and the reality is progressives actually care about them they're American citizens and and and they signed up to protect us etc so we want to protect them and what do cos serve to say and I don't think it's real conservatives to be fair to consumers hey I think it's the corrupt Republican politicians they go yeah I don't give a damn about those people it's a punch line for us that ribbon you put on your car supporter trips don't care these guys pay our bills bankers pay my bills bankers go rob them go rob them so they save one hundred thirty million dollars for you guys you think bankers pay with all their army of lawyers you don't they pay a hundred thirty million dollars because they didn't do it so they're gonna do it again and they're gonna rob them again cuz they just took the cops off the street that's what these guys are Mick Mulvaney is one of the most corrupt people we've ever had in government trained to swamp my ass this is exactly what the swamp is and by the way the military Lending Act is wonderful why doesn't apply to all of us yeah it's a great point that's a great point and look the whole point of the CFPB was to protect all of us but I gotta give credit to Elizabeth Warren the CFPB was her idea and she did grill Mick Mulvaney rather aggressively during Senate hearings and what you're about to watch is an example of all the different ways Mulvaney has gone after the CFPB take a look in 2012 you voted in favor of a Republican budget that called for eliminating the agency entirely is that right I don't have a specific recollection but that sounds familiar to me I'm familiar okay but that was only the beginning you also voted for Republican budgets that eliminated the CFPB in 2013 2014 and 2015 that sound right again yes ma'am there were occasional Republican budgets I didn't vote forward I don't know what was in them but generally I can I see your point yes ma'am all right and in 2015 you'll also supported a standalone bill that would have killed off the CFPB is that right that's correct I think it was a co-sponsor of them yeah he is now the interim head of the CFPB which is fitting for the Trump administration why do you think they want to destroy the organization that protects consumers come on man get your head out of your ass if you're a maggot guy you're getting that Red Hat dirty okay get your head out of your ass they're not here to protect you they're here to protect their donors come on man it's brazen so you want protect consumers from bankers know we're the Republican party we love bankers there's no other explanation oh you think oh the banks are too regulated poor predatory lenders what if they can't rip off service members and charge them 300 percent interest rate poor poor payday lenders does anyone in the country believe that anyone you think that the victims are the bankers and the real thugs who shouldn't be protected our servicemembers and veterans is that what you think okay fine then I guess you're that kind of animal so Mick Mulvaney one of the most corrupt guys Donald Trump who appointed him appointed him to be that corrupt and he's very happy with him to destroy any protection that weather service members or any US citizens get from the guys on Wall Street who want to rob you blind have done it before and now they're gonna get to do it even more two easy ways for Young Turks one is subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you
