PRESIDENT MOON, WORKING ON THIS

37
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:10,173

JUNE 12TH AND THE ACTIVITIES

43
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:22,952
THAT ARE NECESSARY TO FOLLOW

44
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:23,653
THERE FROM.

45
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,587
YOU ASKED ABOUT MY CONVERSATIONS

46
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:28,591
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, THIS QUESTION

47
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:35,464
IS SORT OF UNDIGNIFIED, AND THE

48
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:36,332
CONVERSATIONS INVOLVED DEEP

49
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:38,267
COMPLEX PROBLEMS, CHALLENGES AND

50
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:39,468
THE STRATEGIC DECISION THAT THE

51
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,870
CHAIRMAN HAS BEFORE HIM ABOUT

52
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,206
HOW IT IS HE WISHES TO PROCEED,

53
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,507
AND IF HE IS PREPARED IN

54
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,876
EXCHANGE FOR THE ASSURANCES THAT

55
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,444
WE ARE READY TO PROVIDE TO HIM,

56
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:52,215
IF HE IS PREPARED TO FULLY

57
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:57,253
DENUCLEARIZE.

58
00:01:57,253 --> 00:02:02,859
AND, THEY TOOK THAT TIME TO

59
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,394
ENSURE THAT WE DIDN'T END UP IN

60
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:07,396
THE SAME PLACE THAT WE DID

61
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:12,068
BEFORE.

62
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,838
AND NOT ONLY THE UNITED STATES

63
00:02:15,838 --> 00:02:17,673
BUT THE WORLD WITH NUCLEAR

64
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:18,474
WEAPONS.

65
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,009
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT, IT

66
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,279
WILL REQUIRE A ROBUST

67
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:25,081
CLARIFICATION PROGRAM, AND ONE

68
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:26,649
THAT WE WILL UNDERTAKE WITH

69
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,251
PARTNERS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH

70
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,685
WILL ACHIEVE OUTCOME IN A WAY

71
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:33,756
THAT FRANKLY NO AGREEMENT FOR

72
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:36,058
THEM IS SET FORTH.

73
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,960
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A

74
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,694
GOOD SOUND DISCUSSION SO I THINK

75
00:02:38,694 --> 00:02:40,863
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD

76
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:42,064
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN OUR TWO

77
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:42,798
COUNTRIES ABOUT WHAT THE SHARED

78
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:51,474
OBJECTIVES ARE.

79
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,043
THERE ARE SOME VIDEOS THAT HAVE

80
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:54,477
BEEN RELEASED.

81
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,047
OUR CONVERSATIONS WERE WARM.

82
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,082
WE WERE EACH REPRESENTING OUR

83
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,484
TWO COUNTRIES MAKING SURE THAT

84
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:07,890
WE WERE TRYING OUR BEST, AND WE

85
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,692
HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

86
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,426
HISTORY OF OUR TWO NATIONS AND

87
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,295
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD

88
00:03:12,295 --> 00:00:00,000
BETWEEN US.
