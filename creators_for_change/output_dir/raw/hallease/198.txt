00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,470
like make your selfie into something

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,620
philosophical it's it's not it's you

59
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,239
feeling like you look attractive and

60
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,890
wanting the world to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that and</font>

61
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,980
that's fine but be honest with yourself

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the fifth and final thing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm not about and it's actually</font>

64
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,310
been coming up a lot in the recent media

65
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,700
is the comments section of any video

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,390
that has racial connotations or<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

67
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,760
racial implications of any kind I'm just

68
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">not about the comments section of</font>

69
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,140
