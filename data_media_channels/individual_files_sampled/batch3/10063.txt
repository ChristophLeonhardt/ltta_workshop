tensions arising across Italy as the country prepares to vote in next weekend's general election police have been deployed in cities throughout the country to handle rallies which are either defend or condemned centralite forties security forces expect further protests during the elections and afterwards as the vote isn't expected to produce a clear winner party's haneish assessee assesses the key political figures it's these general election show like no other starring a convict a Trump wannabe and a poster boy confused well let me break it down for you our first contender is the grand old age of 81 and has a scandalous past of fraud convictions and sex scandals oh and he's also been the former Prime Minister of Italy multiple times it's Silvio Berlusconi I am still young so I'm ready to work well at least he's young at heart and he has plenty of supporters I will vote for Berlusconi and the rest I don't care about he gets things done due to his conviction he can't become the Prime Minister himself but if his go Italy partied as well he could be the man to pick the head of the cabinet go Italy leads a coalition which spans the range of Italian center-right politics is thought they could gain 38% of the votes part of this coalition includes our next contender mate'll salvini and his leg a party formerly known as leg inaud Italians first Italians first wait a second doesn't that battle cry sounds familiar America first and I'm sure there's more what I admire in Trump is the fact that he is keeping most of the promises he made during the electoral campaign now just like Trump salvini tweets about anything and everything moving on to our third contender now the young face of the anti-establishment party at only 31 years old their leader of the five star movement is seen by some as a bit of eye candy and he makes sweet promises to we are the only political force that in recent years has made promises to the Italians and has kept faith with those promises we are the only ones to renounce the privileges of policy while all other politicians continue to obtain these privileges I give up my annuity and cut my salary he's the complete opposite of the party's founder and stand-up comedian beppe grillo his cool calm and collected and it seems to have captivated young voters I will go with DeMaio DeMaio will be the turning point I hope that the five star movement comes to power because it understands us young people better they are more aware about technology they think about the future of us young people but there's still a huge group of those unsure which way to votes on March the fourth poll suggests almost a third of eligible voters are either undecided or will abstain honestly I don't trust anyone anymore for me they're all the same whichever political party it is they come here they make their promises I say this I will do that but in the end it was nothing they might have their reasons Italy has seen 60 governments and even more Prime Minister's since the Second World War that's roughly new cabinets every 14 months so we'll see if any of these cars can sway the voters and stay long enough to actually keep any of their promises well polls also show the center-left parties including the current ruling one unlikely to struggle at the election however Italy as junior minister for European affairs Sandra Godsey believes the large amount of undecided voters means they are comes not set in stone there are four million of Italians 4 million of Italians who say that they would go to vote they will go to the polls but that still they are still to make up their mind and it is why the opinion polls so far as are not very reliable because if we depend on the movement on the Elektra behavior of these four million people and also there are people who have abstained in the last general elections who are saying that we abstain and these you ta think of all the political forces in this week to persuade the highest number possible of voters to go to the polls because this general elections in Italy will be very important for Italy self for our positioning in the European Union and I think that they are also very important for the possibility to relaunch the European Union itself
