all right joining us now from Washington with a look at ax es am political reporter for Axios Alexei macam and Alexia appreciate you getting up early for us I know you were up late yesterday on KCDC what is axis is one big thing for us this morning today we're doing a deep dive look into president Trump sort of mind control superpower no president in history has quite managed to summon the power of the pulpit friendly media like Fox and Friends and also the power of Twitter to sort of persuade people and move Minds and this is most evident in sort of the silence of Republican critics and this really matters because we're seeing how this strategy from President Trump has emboldened not only himself but those around him to sort of move forward with untested legal arguments especially as it relates to the Muller probe which we saw just this weekend I gotta say axes as graphics department is really stepping it up these days because graphics that we've been seated because it can't beat that it's a scary leader Kevin McCarthy he's a possible candidate to be House Speaker becoming the latest GOP leader to claim know collusion despite Bob Mahler's ongoing Russia probe what is that signal to you Alexei about how Republican leadership is viewing this investigation you know there's a really important thing happening among Republican leaders and Republican senators at large whether it's Marco Rubio or Kevin McCarthy as you just mentioned who are so fixated on this idea of whether or not there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and that's not that's not what we know Muller is looking at we know for a fact that Muller and his team are looking at the president and things he has done after the election which is about obstruction of justice that is not about collusion with Russia so while they are fixated on this one topic that doesn't mean the president is off the hook because he is still very much the subject of this investigation for obstruction and it also speaks to what I was just mentioning which is sort of this Republican silence or Republican critics are silenced under President Trump and they feel that they have to follow what the president's saying which as we all know is that this is a witch-hunt and there's no collusion and that is sort of dangerous when you're considering the gravity of the situation and how no one in his party is willing to step up to him no matter what they may personally believe I got ask you about some of the headlines that came out of Rudy Giuliani's comments over the weekend saying that the president he's not gonna pardon himself but he certainly has the power to do so what are you hearing around town about the possibility that the president may either shut down the Russia probe or potentially even pardoned himself you know we all know I think in Washington and around the country that the president is someone who will do whatever it takes not only to save himself but to save his family and to save those who are close to him who he really cares about I wouldn't be surprised and I don't think many people would be surprised if President Trump tried to move forward on something like shutting down this investigation by himself or even pardoning himself but I think one important thing to consider here is that the president has signaled in recent days alone that he is willing to pardon people around him if not even himself so I think what we should look for moving forward is whether or not the president moves to pardon folks like Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort who are being swept up in the Moller probe and Trump thinks unfairly and he seems to certainly be signaling that with some of the pardons he's already absolutely the talk is that he's sort of setting that up let's talk about this new reporting Axios has out this morning about students including those surviving the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from what we hear they're embarking on a summer tour what are they looking to achieve with this so the students from the March for our lives gun violence reform rally are starting a bus tours you just mentioned they are making 20 different stops in 20 different cities across the US and they are really hoping to just not only register the four million people in America who are turning 18 before the November election to vote but they want to push this gun violence platform that they have been fighting for since the parklands shooting they want comprehensive background checks they want funding for the CDC to conduct research on gun violence they want to ban automatic weapons and so this is something that they're doing ahead of the election to sort of show their political power and make actual change so what do you think are going to be some of the most notable stops on this sure it's obviously going to get a lot of buzz but what should we be looking at for in Florida alone these kids will be visiting all 25 congressional districts which i think is a really smart way to keep it local to their home state another state we should look out for is California that is a state where they could really sort of activate this grassroots progressive base that is likely to agree with them on their gun violence platform they're also going to places like South Carolina and Texas and I think Texas is a really fascinating place for us to watch as this develops because it has been reliably read but we have seen instances in which it has been shifting blue alright Alexa mckimmon live for us in Washington DC doing double-duty on MSNBC
