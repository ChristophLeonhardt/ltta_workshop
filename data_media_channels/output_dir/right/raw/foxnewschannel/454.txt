00:00:01,182 --> 00:00:02,383
HOUSE THAT IT WILL WRAP UP BY

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,018
THE END OF THIS WEEK?

3
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:05,886
>> TO REMIND FOLKS IT WAS THE

4
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:07,755
PRESIDENT THAT SIGNED OFF ON

5
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:08,923
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

6
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:10,591
BUT HE SAID ALL ALONG HE

7
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:11,292
BELIEVES DEMOCRATS ARE DOING

8
00:00:11,292 --> 00:00:13,627
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DELAY

9
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:15,329
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION

10
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:16,730
AND HE EXPECTS TO SEE THAT

11
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,097
CONTINUE.

12
00:00:17,097 --> 00:00:18,132
THE CONCERN IS THAT WITH THIS

13
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,034
WEEK FOR THE F.B.I. TO COMPLETE

14
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:20,768
THIS BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

15
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:23,070
IT GIVES A LOT MORE TIME FOR

16
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,507
ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS TO COME

17
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:28,042
OUT AND CALLS FOR FURTHER

18
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,210
INVESTIGATION AND DELAYS.

19
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,312
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ARE

00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:32,012
CONVINCED THE F.B.I.'S

21
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:32,746
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION WILL

22
00:00:32,746 --> 00:00:34,815
NOT TURN INTO A FISHING

23
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:35,216
EXPEDITION.

24
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:36,951
NO MATTER THE OUTCOME THE

25
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,585
PRESIDENT IS PREDICTING

26
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:39,753
DEMOCRATS WON'T BE SATISFIED.

27
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:41,388
ON SUNDAY HE TWEETED WOW,

28
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,257
STARTING TO HEAR THE DEMOCRATS

29
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:44,425
ONLY THINKING OF OBSTRUCT AND

30
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:46,560
DELAY ARE STARTING TO PUT OUT

31
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,462
THE WORD THAT THE TIME AND

32
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:50,564
SCOPE OF THE F.B.I. LOOKING

33
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,199
INTO KAVANAUGH AND WITNESSES

34
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:52,666
ISN'T ENOUGH.

35
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:52,967
HELLO?

36
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,535
FOR THEM IT WILL NEVER BE

37
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:54,869
ENOUGH.

38
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,338
STAY TUNED AND WATCH.

39
00:00:57,338 --> 00:00:59,640
ON 60 MINUTES CHRIS COON SAID

40
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,574
HE BELIEVES THE INVESTIGATION

41
00:01:00,574 --> 00:01:02,276
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

42
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,378
>> I THINK WE'LL BE IN A

43
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:06,714
DIFFERENT PLACE BECAUSE LOTS OF

44
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:09,617
SURVIVORS AROUND THE COUNTRY

45
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:11,218
WILL FEEL THAT DR. FORD'S STORY

46
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:13,554
WAS HEARD AND RESPECTED AND

47
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:14,121
FURTHER INVESTIGATED.

48
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,423
WE MAY WELL BE IN A DIFFERENT

49
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,758
PLACE A WEEK FROM NOW BECAUSE

50
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,827
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY

51
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:23,864
MAY WELL HAVE HAD EXCULPATORY

52
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,466
EVIDENCE BROUGHT FORWARD.

53
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:27,401

56
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:31,238
>> Bill: DEMOCRATS ARE RAISING

57
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,273
CONCERNS ABOUT THE

58
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:32,707

59
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,908
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TODAY?

60
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:35,543
>> DEMOCRATS ARE CONCERNED THAT

61
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:37,845
GIVEN THE LIMITED TIME THAT THE

62
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,714
F.B.I. HAS TO WORK WITH IS THAT

63
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:41,349
ACTS WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETE

64
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:45,052

68
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:51,392
LIKE THIS IN MUCH SMALLER TIME

69
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:51,726
FRAMES.

70
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,494

00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,532
LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE

75
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:01,736
INVESTIGATION TO NOT LOOK INTO

76
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:02,837
OTHER ALLEGATIONS OR INCIDENTS

77
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,539

SUNDAY".

81
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:09,911
>> WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL HAS

82
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,079
ALLOWED THE SENATE TO DICTATE

83
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:11,946
WHAT THE TERMS LOOK LIKE AND

84
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,748
WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE

85
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:14,616
INVESTIGATION IS.

86
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,951
AGAIN, THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T

87
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,452

92
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:22,624
FROM THE BEGINNING AND WE'RE

93
00:02:22,624 --> 00:02:24,225
LETTING THE SENATE CONTINUE TO

94
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:25,126
DICTATE WHAT THE TERMS LOOK

95
00:02:25,126 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE.
