THERE IS A LOT TO GO THROUGH BEFORE THE JUNE 12th SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE. Sandra: RICH EDSON, THANK YOU. Bill: ANOTHER BIG STORY WE'RE WATCHING. AWAITING A BIG U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING. MILITANT GROUPS FIRED MORE ROCKETS TOWARD SOUTHERN ISRAEL OVERNIGHT. ERIC, GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. IT'S A RARE SECURITY COUNCIL EMERGENCY MEETING THAT IS BEING HELD IN DEFENSE OF ISRAEL AND INTENDED TO PUT HAMAS ON THE SPOT. U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES NIKKI HALEY CALLING FOR THIS EMERGENCY SESSION TO HOLD THE PALESTINIAN LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ATTACKS. HALEY CONDEMNING THE MORTAR FIRE OF MORE THAN 100 ROCKETS FROM GAZA INTO ISRAELI TERRITORY INCLUDING HITTING THIS KINDERGARTEN JUST BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHOWED UP. HALEY SAID THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD BE OUTRAGED AT THE VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT INNOCENT CIVILIANS. ISRAEL HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR ITS LETHAL RESPONSE TO THE RIOTING, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TOLD ME THIS MORNING THE SECURITY COUNCIL SHOULD ALSO DESIGNATE HAMAS AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION JUST LIKE AL QAEDA AND ISIS. IT WILL BE A MESSAGE FROM THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND WHO ARE THE BAD GUYS IN THE REGION. WE WILL NOT ALLOW HAMAS TO THREAT EN OUR CITIZENS. THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCE WILL ATTACK TERRORISTS IN GAZA. WE WILL HUNT AND GO AFTER THEM. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY ESCALATION BUT WON'T ALLOW THEM TO ATTACK OUR CIVILIANS. A STUDY BY AN ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE THINK-TANK. 93 PALESTINIANS KILLED WERE WITH THE TERRORIST GROUP. 63 HAMAS, 21 FATAH. SOLDIERS HIT TERRORIST OPERATIVES. THEY WERE AMONG THE FRONT LINE WHO TRIED TO BREAK INTO ISRAELI TERRITORY BY BURNING TIRES AND THROWING PIPE BOMBS AND MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AND KITES. SHOOTING ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE SPONSORED BY KUWAIT TO DEPLOY A FORCE TO PROTECT THE PALESTINIANS. WE ARE ALL FOR THE PEACE PROGRAM. WE WANT THE SECURITY COUNCIL TO REACTIVATE THE PEACE PROCESS AND WE WANT THE PROCESS TO BE REACTIVATED BASED ON INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY AND BASED ON ALL THE RESOLUTIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY. FOX NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT THE U.S. DELEGATION IS PUSHING FOR A SECURITY COUNCIL STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE ATTACKS AND CALLING FOR THE VIOLENCE TO STOP. BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS HOUR IF THERE WILL BE THAT
