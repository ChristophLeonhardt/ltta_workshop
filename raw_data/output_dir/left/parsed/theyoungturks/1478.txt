DONALD TRUMP HAS ISSUED A
PARDON FOR CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST
AND CONSPIRACY THEORIST DINESH
D'SOUZA.
THIS WAS AN INDIVIDUAL
WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO MAKING
CAMPAIGN DONATIONS UNLAWFULLY,
SO LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
FIRST IT ALL BEGAN WITH DONALD
TRUMP TWEETING THE FOLLOWING --
>>
>>AGAIN, PLEASE KEEP IN MIND
THAT DINESH D'SOUZA HIMSELF
PLEADED GUILTY TO UNLAWFUL
CAMPAIGN DONATIONS.
DONALD TRUMP
ALSO SAID --
>>
>>AND OF COURSE DINESH D'SOUZA
RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO THIS NEWS
WITH A TWEET THAT READ AS
FOLLOWS --
>>
>>THEN HE SPECIFICALLY WENT
AFTER THE PROSECUTOR WHO
PROSECUTED HIM --
>>
>>LET'S STOP AND TALK ABOUT
THAT A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS.
WHY DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
IF HE'S AN INDIAN AMERICAN AND
YOU ARE AN INDIAN AMERICAN.
YOU
WANT TO BRING RACE INTO THIS?
I
THOUGHT YOU HATED TALKING ABOUT
RACE, BUT YOU MADE IT RACIAL FOR
NO REASON AT ALL.
SECOND OF ALL,
YEAH, TRUMP FIRED HIM SO THAT HE
WOULDN'T INVESTIGATE HIS
LAWBREAKING, IT'S NOT A THING TO
BRAG ABOUT.
AND TRUMP HAD TOLD
HIM I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU ON,
AND THEN HE'S LIKE, YOU ARE
LOOKING INTO MY CRIMES?
NO, I
HAVE TO OBSTRUCT JUSTICE, YOU'RE
FIRED.
SECOND OF ALL, YOU GOT
PARDON FOR WHAT?
LET'S TALK
ABOUT HOW STUPID DINESH D'SOUZA
IS.
IT'S SO EASY TO BRIBE OUR
POLITICIANS, YOU CAN DO IT
LEGALLY THROUGH DARK MONEY,
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES,
CAMPAIGN DONATIONS, A THOUSAND
DIFFERENT WAYS, YOU CAN FUNNEL
MILLIONS TO THEM.
BUT YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE MONUMENTALLY STUPID
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY GO, OKAY,
I'LL BREAK THE LAW.
I'LL JUST
HAVE THAT GUY GIVE HIM MONEY
EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE GIVING
IT TO HIM.
THAT'S THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T DO, YOU MORON.
LOOK,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE
AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE'S A
CONVICTED FELON.
>>THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO JUMP
IN VERY QUICKLY, CENK, BECAUSE I
WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM DINESH
D'SOUZA HIMSELF AS HE PLEADED
GUILTY TO THIS.
HE SAID THE
FOLLOWING --
>>
>>AND YES, CENK IS ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, HE USED STRAW DONATIONS,
HE WOULD ESSENTIALLY GO UP TO
PEOPLE AND TELL THEM, HEY, MAKE
THIS DONATION OBVIOUSLY ON MY
BEHALF BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT UNDER
MY NAME, AND I WILL REIMBURSE
YOU FOR THAT CAMPAIGN DONATION.
THAT IS ILLEGAL AND HE CONFESSED
TO IT.
>>PART OF THE REASON FOR THE
PARDON IS DONALD TRUMP IS A
CRIMINAL AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
HE IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR
CRIMINALS, AND ONE OF THE CRIMES
THEY ARE LIKELY TO FACE IS
CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATIONS.
SO
WHAT HE'S DOING IS HE IS GOING
AROUND PARDONING EVERYBODY THAT
HAS A SIMILAR CRIME TO THE ONES
HIS CRONIES HAVE EITHER
COMMITTED AND HAVE BEEN CHARGED
WITH, OR HAVE COMMITTED AND ARE
ABOUT TO BE CHARGED WITH.
SO HE
IS LIKE, CAMPAIGN FINANCE
VIOLATIONS, WE WILL BE CHARGED
WITH THAT?
WHO IS A CONSERVATIVE
HACK WHO DID A CAMPAIGN FINANCE
VIOLATION?
DINESH, PERFECT.
EVEN
THOUGH YOU ADMIT YOU DID IT, YOU
WERE CONVICTED, YOU PLED GUILTY
-- BY THE WAY THIS IS HOW IT
WORKS WITH POWERFUL PEOPLE, AND
THIS IS HOW MUCH KID GLOVES WE
HAVE FOR REPUBLICANS, EIGHT
MONTHS IN PRISON BUT HE GOT TO
LEAVE DURING THE DAYTIME.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU DID SOMETHING
DEEPLY ILLEGAL AND YOU WENT TO
PRISON AND THEY WOULD SAY YOU
CAN LEAVE DURING THE DAY, YOU
JUST HAVE TO COME SLEEP IN A
MINIMAL SECURITY PRISON?
YOU
DIDN'T GET THAT TREATMENT,
RIGHT?
BUT IF YOU ARE CONNECTED
POLITICALLY LIKE DINESH D'SOUZA
AND YOU KEEP CRYING AND CRYING,
ALL I DID WAS BREAK THE LAW, AND
THEY SAID UNDER THE GUISE OF
HAVING A JOB, WHICH IS TO BE A
CORPORATE LACKEY FOR REPUBLICAN
DONORS AND BE LIKE, OKAY, MY JOB
IS TO ATTACK HILLARY CLINTON AND
BARACK OBAMA AND SAY RACIAL
THINGS ABOUT OBAMA BECAUSE I'M
BROWN AND I GET TO SAY THAT --
YES NOW I BROUGHT RACE INTO IT
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE,
DANCE WITH THEM, DINESH -- HE
GOT TO GO OUT DURING THE DAY AND
GOT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT HE GOT
AN EIGHT MONTH PRISON SENTENCE
BECAUSE HE'S A CONVICTED
CRIMINAL.
SO TRUMP PARDONS HIM
BECAUSE HE'S LIKE, MY GUYS ARE
ALSO DOING THE SAME CRIMES, SO
WHEN I PARDON THEM I'LL GET TO
SAY IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
MICHAEL COHEN OR ANY OF MY OTHER
LAWYERS OR ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS OR CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS,
I PARDON EVERY CONVICTED
CRIMINAL WHO HAS DONE CAMPAIGN
FINANCE VIOLATIONS, LOOK AT
DINESH D'SOUZA, HE IS AMONG THE
WORST CRIMINALS WE HAVE IN
CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND I PARDONED
HIM.
>>IT DOES APPEAR THAT TRUMP IS
SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE IN
REGARD TO THE AMOUNT OF POWER HE
HAS.
HE DOES ESSENTIALLY HAVE
UNMITIGATED POWER IN TERMS OF
PARDONING PEOPLE, OFFERING
CLEMENCY, AND HE IS SENDING WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A STRONG MESSAGE
TO PEOPLE WHO COULD TESTIFY
AGAINST HIM IF THEY ACCEPT A
PLEA DEAL UNDER THE GENERAL --
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
MEDDLING AND UNSTRUCTURED OF
JUSTICE.
SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT SOMEONE LIKE MICHAEL
COHEN OR PAUL MANAFORT AVOIDS
SAYING ANYTHING INCRIMINATING
DURING THE INVESTIGATION, ONE OF
THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO
SAY DON'T TAKE ANY KIND OF DEAL
OR OFFER ANY INFORMATION,
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DO GET
CONVICTED AND EVEN IF YOU DO
FACE SIGNIFICANT PRISON TIME, I
COULD PARDON YOU.
I HAVE THAT
KIND OF POWER.
BY THE WAY, I
WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOME
OTHER COMPONENTS TO DINESH
D'SOUZA'S CRIME AND THESE
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE ISSUES, BECAUSE
THERE WAS A STORY THAT CAME OUT
RECENTLY IN REGARD TO ROSIE
O'DONNELL, SHE IS BEING ACCUSED
OF DONATING TOO MUCH MONEY TO
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS, THAT IS
BEING INVESTIGATED.
SHE IS
SAYING THAT SHE DONATED THAT
MONEY THROUGH ACT BLUE, AND SHE
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS GIVING TOO
MUCH.
AND BY THE WAY IT WAS
NOTHING LIKE WHAT DINESH D'SOUZA
DID, DINESH D'SOUZA KNOWINGLY,
WITTINGLY BROKE THESE CAMPAIGN
FINANCE LAWS, AND IN ORDER TO BE
CONVICTED OF CRIMES LIKE THIS --
>>
>>SO THE REASON I BRING UP
ROSIE O'DONNELL IS BECAUSE WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO IS PROOF THAT SHE
KNEW SHE WAS BREAKING THE LAW.
DINESH D'SOUZA CONFESSED THAT HE
WAS BREAKING THE LAW, AND IN THE
ACT OF DOING WHAT HE WAS DOING
HE WENT AND LOOKED FOR STRAW
DONORS, BASICALLY LETTING PEOPLE
KNOW, HEY, THERE'S A LIMIT TO
HOW MUCH I CAN DONATE SO WHY
DON'T YOU DONATE ON MY BEHALF
AND I WILL REIMBURSE YOU?
>>THAT SHOWS INTENT, THAT SHOWS
THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS
BREAKING THE LAW, WHEREAS
O'DONNELL SAID, LOOK, I THOUGHT
IF YOU WENT ABOVE THE AMOUNT, I
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE AMOUNT WAS
-- AND BY THE WAY THAT MIGHT NOT
BE A GOOD DEFENSE AND I'M NOT
DEFENDING ANYONE WHO IS DOING
THAT -- BUT IF YOU GO ABOVE THE
AMOUNT I THOUGHT THEY JUST GIVE
THE MONEY BACK BECAUSE THEY HAVE
TO BY LAW.
SO SHE DIDN'T GO INTO
A CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY LIKE
DINESH D'SOUZA.
NOW, HE WAS NOT
CONVICTED ON CONSPIRACY, HE WAS
JUST CONVICTED OF BEING A
REGULAR OLD FELON WHO LIKES TO
DO CAMPAIGN-FINANCE VIOLATIONS.
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT DINESH
D'SOUZA IS.
THIS GUY IS ARGUABLY
A LUNATIC, BUT I DON'T THINK SO,
I THINK HE IS JUST MAINLY A
DANCER FOR REPUBLICAN DONORS.
AND SO WHAT DOES HE DO?
HE HAS
SAID THAT OBAMA IS -- HAS RAGE
BECAUSE HE IS ANTI-COLONIALIST.
FIRST OF ALL BEING
ANTI-COLONIALIST, THAT'S A BAD
THING?
>>TO REPUBLICANS IT IS.
>>SO YOU WANT TO BE PRO
COLONIALIST, YOU WANT TO CRUSH
PEOPLE AND STEAL THEIR RESOURCES
AND YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD
THING?
BY THE WAY, THEY DID THAT
INDIA.
YOU BROUGHT INDIA INTO
THIS, BRITAIN DID THAT TO INDIA.
SO I GUESS HE'S LIKE, YAY, YOU
CRUSHED INDIAN PEOPLE AND
MURDERED THEM AND TOOK THEIR
MONEY, PRO-COLONIALISM.
THAT IS
WHAT THEY ARE PAYING YOU TO DO,
DINESH.
DANCE FOR THEM, BOY.
DANCE FOR THEM.
THEN HE DOES A
DOCUMENTARY CALLED THE ROOT OF
OBAMA'S RAGE.
NOW, IF YOU ARE A
REGULAR MAGA GUY AND YOU ARE
STUPID AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HISTORY, YOU ARE LIKE WHAT'S THE
BIG DEAL, HE'S AN ANGRY BLACK
GUY.
I GET IT, YOU'RE STUPID.
DINESH D'SOUZA WENT ANOTHER WAY,
YOU DON'T THINK HE KNOWS RACIST
TROPES?
THE ANGRY BLACK MAN?
SO
HE DOES A WHOLE MOVIE CALLED THE
ROOT OF OBAMA'S RAGE.
>>I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN
OBAMA ANGRY.
THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME I'D THOUGHT OF IT.
>>I WISH OBAMA WOULD HAVE HAD
RANGE.
IT'S TO SMEAR HIM AS AN
ANGRY BLACK MAN.
I DID A STORY
IN THE 2012 ELECTION ABOUT HOW A
REPUBLICAN DONOR NEEDED A DARKER
SKINNED GUY TO ATTACK OBAMA SO
THEY WOULDN'T GET CALLED RACIST.
DANCE FOR THEM, DINESH.
HE WENT
TO DARTMOUTH, HE KNOWS THAT'S A
RACIST TROPE.
HE DID A WHOLE
MOVIE ABOUT IT.
THEN HE
INSINUATES MICHELLE OBAMA IS A
MAN.
THEN HE TALKS ABOUT HOW
CHARLOTTESVILLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
STAGED.
HE DOES A CONSPIRACY
THEORY ABOUT LAS VEGAS, HOW THE
SHOOTER WAS AN ANTI-TRUMP GUY.
HE DOES THE SAME ANTI-SEMITIC
ATTACKS AGAINST GEORGE SOROS
THAT ROSEANNE BARR JUST GOT IN
MASSIVE TROUBLE FOR.
TRUMP, I
GET IT, HE'S A CRIMINAL, AND ALL
OF HIS CRONIES ARE CRIMINALS, SO
HE IS PARDONING CRIMINALS SO
EVENTUALLY WHEN HE PARDONS HIS
CRONIES IT DOESN'T SEEM AS WEIRD
OR UNPRECEDENTED.
I GET HIS
MOTIVATIONS.
BUT IN TERMS OF
DINESH, LIKE, ARE YOU PROUD?
AND
THEN YOU GO TO TED CRUZ, LET'S
TALK ABOUT HIS MOTIVATIONS.
AND
ALL THE REPUBLICANS.
BECAUSE TED
CRUZ APPLAUDED THIS TODAY.
ARE
PROUD AMERICAN, DINESH D'SOUZA
-- I MEAN, I'M A LATINO, I
ATTACK FELLOW LATINOS.
DINESH,
ATTACK AROUND PEOPLE, GO!
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, ATTACKING
GEORGE SOROS, SAYING HE
COLLABORATED WITH THE HOLOCAUST,
YES!
RIGHT, TED CRUZ?
THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, THESE PEOPLE
ARE NOT HONEST ACTORS.
THEY ARE
TERRIBLE PEOPLE, AND THEY LIE
AND THEY SMEAR, AND YES THEY DO
WHOLE MOVIES BASED ON RACISM,
AND THEN HE TWEETS ABOUT HOW YOU
CAN'T TAKE THE GHETTO OUT OF THE
BOY, ABOUT OBAMA.
>>WE HAVE THAT TWEET FOR YOU.
THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE
TYPE OF STUFF THAT YOU WILL FIND
ON DINESH D'SOUZA'S TWITTER
ACCOUNT.
>>YOU CAN TAKE THE BOY OUT OF
THE GHETTO, WATCH THIS VULGAR
MAN SHOW HIS STUFF WHILE AMERICA
COWERS IN EMBARRASSMENT.
BECAUSE
HE TOOK A SELFIE?
YOU CAN TAKE
THE BOY OUT OF THE GHETTO?
DANCE
FOR THEM, DINESH.
YOU PATHETIC
LITTLE SNIVELING PIECE OF CRAP.
SO YOU WANT TO GO ATTACK OTHER
MINORITIES SO THEY PAY YOU?
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO?
THEN YOU DO
CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THIS
INSANE STUFF, AND THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY, WHICH HAS LOST ITS MIND
ON A GRAND SCALE, GOES BRAVO,
DINESH.
YES, LET THE CRIMINAL
GO.
THIS IS THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY.
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE
THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BE
NEUTRAL, BE NEUTRAL.
TED CRUZ
COULD BE RIGHT, MAYBE A
CONVICTED CRIMINAL IS AWESOME,
MAYBE CAMPAIGN-FINANCE
VIOLATIONS ARE AWESOME, MAYBE
RACISM IS GREAT.
MAYBE ALEX
JONES CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE
WONDERFUL.
TED CRUZ ALSO TALKED
ABOUT HOW WE WOULD BE STUFFED
INTO HOBBIT HOMES BY THE U.N.,
IT WAS ON HIS WEBSITE.
WE HAVE
LOST OUR MINDS.
LET'S CALL IT
EVEN, I DON'T WANT TO OFFEND
REPUBLICANS COME AND THEY ARE
SPECIAL LITTLE SNOWFLAKES, DON'T
OFFEND THEM, THEY WILL GET
TRIGGERED.
AND THE AUDIENCE, I
NEED THE RATINGS.
REPUBLICANS,
DON'T LEAVE.
DON'T LEAVE ME.
I'LL TELL YOU PRETTY LITTLE LIES
ABOUT HOW YOUR LEADERS ARE NOT
LUNATICS, ARE NOT RACISTS, ARE
NOT SERIAL, PATHOLOGICAL LIARS.
BUT THEY ARE, THEY ARE.
>>WHAT I BELIEVE THE RIGHT WING
IS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN
DOING IS SPREADING THIS FALSE
NARRATIVE THAT THE MEDIA IS TOO
LIBERAL AND IS CONSTANTLY ON
THIS WITCHHUNT AGAINST THEM.
AND
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT I SEE, THIS
IS AGAIN MY TAKE, THE MEDIA
TRIES TO PROVE THAT IT'S NOT BY
CATERING TO THEM, AND GIVING
THEM A PLATFORM, EVEN IF THEY
ARE CONVICTED FELONS, GIVING
THEM A PLATFORM AND TREATING
THEM AS IF THEY ARE LEGITIMATE
AND RESPECTABLE PEOPLE WHO
SHOULD BE HEARD.
AND I THINK
THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT
TO REALLY LAY THINGS OUT AS THEY
ARE, RIGHT?
THE ROSIE O'DONNELL
STORY IS FINE, I THINK IT'S FINE
TO REPORT ON THAT, BUT YOU
AREN'T GOING TO HEAR PEOPLE ON
THE LEFT TEAR APART THE MEDIA
FOR REPORTING THAT STORY AND
ACCUSE THE MEDIA OF BEING RIGHT
WING HACKS.
>>I'M SO SICK OF THE MEDIA AND
THEIR STUPID, RIDICULOUS
NEUTRALITY.
IF YOU PUT LIES AND
TRUTH ON THE SAME FOOTING, YOU
HAVE GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO LIE,
YOU HAVE GIVEN AN INCENTIVE TO
CHEAT, AND YOU HAVE DESTROYED
ANY EFFORT AT REAL JOURNALISM
WHERE YOU TELL THE AUDIENCE WHAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND IT HAS
CREATED THIS, A REPUBLICAN PARTY
FILLED WITH PATHOLOGICAL LIARS
WHOSE JOB IS TO DECEIVE YOU,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER.
THE MEDIA IS GOING TO
CALL IT EVEN.
WATCH, CNN WILL
GET ON AND CALL IT EVEN.
SO
THERE SHOULD BE INCREDIBLE
OUTRAGE OVER THIS, AND THERE
WON'T BE, IT WILL BE ANOTHER
DAY, THEN EVERYONE WILL MOVE ON
AND WHEN DONALD TRUMP TRIES TO
PARDON HIS CRONIES IT WILL BE
JUST, OH WELL, WE ARE A SLOWLY
BOILING FROG ON OUR WAY TO
FASCISM.
OKAY, I GUESS THAT
HAPPENED.
SO WHEN HE FIRES THE
PROSECUTORS, I GUESS THAT
HAPPENED.
LET'S CALL IT EVEN.
HEY, DID I MENTION, DINESH, I
DON'T SEE YOU DANCING.
DANCE,
BOY.
DANCE.
