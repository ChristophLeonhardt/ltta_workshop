Many waters
cannot quench love,
neither can floods drown it.
But love is not only
about a young couple.
Now, the power of love is
demonstrated by the fact
that we’re all here.
Love your neighbor
as yourself.
If the sky that we look upon
should tumble and fall,
or the mountains
should crumble to the sea.
Stand by me,
stand by me.
Stand by me ...
I now invite you to join hands
and make your vows.
– For better or for worse.
– For better or for worse.
– For richer, for poorer.
– For richer, for poorer.
– In sickness and in health
– In sickness and in health.
– To love and to cherish.
– To love and to cherish.
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.
This little light of mine,
I’m going to let it shine.
This little light of mine,
I’m going to let it shine.
Let it shine, let it shine …
