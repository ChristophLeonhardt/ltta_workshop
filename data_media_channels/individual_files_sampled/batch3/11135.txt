hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle fifteen years ago this month the United States in its so called Coalition of the Willing illegally invaded in occupied Iraq American troops remain there to this day and Iraq continues to grapple with that fateful decision many call the invasion of Iraq a blunder shouldn't we call it what it really is a crime crosstalking Iraq 15 years on I'm joined by my guess Ken O'Keefe in Calgary he is a political analyst and an ex US Marine who renounced US citizenship in Washington we have Christopher nee whyme he is a former Army Military Police Sergeant Iraq war veteran and contributor to the hill and in Tehran we have Mohammad Morandi he's an associate professor at the University of Toronto all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in any time you want and I always appreciated alright gentlemen before we get started here I'd like to refresh everybody's memory of what happened 15 years ago preceding the war and also because the mainstream media is largely ignoring this 15 year commemoration because it's certainly not an anniversary here let me read a few things here I believe demolishing Hussein's military power and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk that was Keith Adelman Edelman the conflict could last six days six weeks I doubt six months Donald Rumsfeld we will be greeted as liberators Dick Cheney a year from now I wouldn't be surprised that there's some grand square in Baghdad named after President Bush Richard Perle Iraq will not required sustained aid mitch Daniels and lastly but really importantly we're dealing with the country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon Paul Wolfowitz all right you know ken let me go to you first here I mean what has been learned from this fiasco for everybody involved and why isn't it being commemorated and remembered it seems like it's intentionally being blocked out go ahead Ken well let's remember the 22 American servicemembers a day that are committing suicide because they were sent off to fight an illegal immoral war that was based on a pack of lies and ultimately what we've learned is that international law is not functioning because of all the things we were told about Adolf Hitler apparently according to the Nuremberg principles the supreme crime that he committed was war of aggression because all the other crimes torture mass murder crimes against humanity all of those stemmed from war of aggression so only win Tony Blair and George Bush and a whole host of others including Rumsfeld and Cheney are sitting in a jail cell for the rest of their lives we begin to think that this world is turned from the better until such time apparently we haven't learned much because this crime that we have committed is one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century and I personally having been to Iraq and having visited Baghdad and met the orphans that are there millions of orphans millions of refugees probably close to two million dead at least a million dead the country is still wreaking havoc over its entire system has been destroyed infrastructure wise all of this is one of the major crimes of the 21st century and nobody in any position of power has suffered the consequences which tells me that international law is not functioning and that means that we must change that circumstance and people need to be put in jail for life okay Christopher you you you were a year in Iraq or veteran here I mean when I look at a lot of the people that were the architects of this war I mean some of these people are in the Trump administration now now so can already brought up the issue of accountability I mean this is a catastrophe of you know almost unbelievable magnitude but and not only these architects but people in the media that cheered on this war like they cheer on so many other foreign adventures how do you reflect upon that Christopher you were there go ahead I was it's hard to believe how much time has gone by it's it's been a very very long time I remember I was 19 years old coming into two theatres and Kuwait and then through Iraq and I remember it's very personal many of the veterans I serve with have lost legs lost eyes it's been a very personal so I actually appreciate Ken's perspective on the VA well veterans are dealing with out there and I would admit that some of the arrogance that came out of the the sort of tone and tenor of some bush folks back that about the ease of it it's been very personal for me but I do want to push back a little bit in the sense of this notion that it's illegal or the illegality if we look back at UN Security resolutions dating back to 1990 and forward the Security resolutions that were passed to give to compel Iraq to comply with with weapons inspections and to to to give that authorization and if you look back I mean 72% of Americans Gallup poll the United States Congress many of the people and I I would ask can if he would agree were you know Hillary Clinton Joe Biden US lawmakers that voted for that war authorization that use of force so I think we have to look back at the time where people's minds were at in the post 9/11 environment and I would point to those International Security resolutions well as the authorization that that was cited for the invasion well you know there's a there are other countries in the world that don't abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions Israel is a prime example okay let me go to Mohammed here I think it is patently obvious that the war was illegal because there was no United Nations Security Council resolution okay and because and I'll be willing to admit that it Iraq did not fulfill probably every single resolution but that's not a cause for war okay go ahead Mohammed I think it's even worse than that first of all I think it was whether even if the UN Security Council had voted for them to launch this war it still would have been illegal the United States was the regime that created the monster Saddam Hussein they helped create the war machine that Saddam Hussein use in Bakke wait for example and to invade Iran the United States and its European allies the so-called civilized world they gave Saddam Hussein chemical weapons they used chemical weapons the Iraqis with the support of the United States Halabja Dissidia the Kurdish city in northern Iraq Omo in in there almost 7,000 people were killed 6,800 I believe as a result of chemical weapons that Saddam Hussein used with the support of the West I personally survived two chemical attacks so these were crimes against humanity that the United States bears as much responsibility as Saddam Hussein after that when the United States imposed sanctions on the Iraqi people after the defeat of the Saddam forces in Kuwait a million people were killed and Madeleine Albright back then said it was a price worth paying 1 million children died as a result yeah and also after Iraq was defeated in Kuwait the Iraqis rose up and they were about to overthrow the regime and then the United States allowed the regime to use its helicopters to Massacre Iraqis both in the north in the south of the country scope the scroll craft and people like Haas they were saying that the regime must stay in place because its overthrow may benefit Iran so the United States kept Saddam Hussein well our all these certainly out anymore and the war was based on lies right big and they certainly did the chemical weapons the nuclear weapons right aluminum tubes the yellowcake from Niger all that fabricated evidence and the reason why Americans supported it was because the corporate media exacting on media like the BBC they're all because they were lied to okay well go ahead jump in there can because it this is my mantra all the time about this because you have the media's Justin ographers for power and again and one of the things I want to make this program is that we're seeing it all over again we saw it with Syria we're seeing it with and around this being targeted right now it's the same techniques it's the same people doing it go ahead can and it's the same people in charge and if we want to learn something if the audience wants to learn something then let's look at oh did you not as a strategy for Israel in the 1980s there is this psychopathic plan for Israel to expand and back in the 1980s Saddam Hussein was identified as target number one while by the way he was our asset fighting the Iranians which brother Muhammad knows very well because Saddam Hussein was used to kill effectively a million Iranians which included teenage boys who were what who were sent off to the front who came voluntarily to the front to defend Iran very honorably the only war that Iran has been involved in for several centuries ultimately this plan of expanding Israel the greater Israel project involved not just the taking out of Saddam Hussein or any other strong Arab leadership in the region but also to effectively balkanize the entire region and what we see right now in Syria Lybia an entire region is plan OD the Anand's a strategy for israel in the 1980s and this chaos that we see is not an accident and if people really want to learn something here they need to understand that none of this is an accident actually what's happened in Iraq is exactly what was intended not only to take out Saddam Hussein but to break up Iraq which we see three different segments we see the same thing happening in Syria right now so if people really want to have an understanding they need to know that those that are in power which are all basically puppets and government who are underneath the bankers who always want war who financed generally all sides of war they have a major incentive to keep going with war and now you know very well sitting there in Russia that we're trying to pick a fight with Russia and look at the embarrassing reality of UK politics with Boris Johnson and the Prime Minister themselves in Dighton Russia without any evidence whatsoever yeah why because they work for the bankers and another war is on order okay that's the pattern you know accuse and then you don't need any kind of evidence here Christopher let me ask you almost kind of like a personal question I mean a lot has come out about the planning and the and the botched occupation you know the Iraqi government I think it was about two weeks ago voted to have all foreign troops removed from Iraq but the United States doesn't do that I thought you know the United States was trying to get sovereignty to Iraq and it doesn't even listen to its own the only the the political system that it actually imposed you know shouldn't isn't it time for the u.s. to stop quote unquote helping the Iraqis go ahead Christopher well I think that I mean President Bush campaign we weren't going to have nation-building then we had nation-building on steroids I mean I think it'd be fair to look back at that but I think the the biggest issues with the post with Iraq was not so much the the initial invasion but it was all of the post war activities whether it was the disagreement between the the Pentagon and the administration over troop levels decommissioning the Iraqi military and all and frankly just the the post-war governance I think that's where the problems had if Iraq was a flourishing democracy today I think maybe we'd be looking at it differently but I think it's more the way that it turned out that's causing those issues but I do want to say it's a very long complex history I don't disagree at all with the the contradictory foreign policy positions over the last 50 years of the United States in these areas it's it's I can easily see why with let me jump in sure timonium let me jump in here gentlemen we have to go to a hard break and after that hard break we'll continue our discussion on Iraq 15 years on stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle to remind you were discussing Iraq 15 years on okay let me go back to Tehran Mohammed one of the ironies of the of the law of unintended consequences probably my favorite phrase when I look at American foreign policy in the Middle East is that what you know 15 years on after this I will continue with the illegal invasion and occupation is that this is a neo-cons nightmare because because of that blunder failure even crime is that you have a government in Baghdad that doesn't look to Washington it looks to Tehran so I mean the the unintended consequence couldn't be more or overstated go ahead Mohammed I think the reason for that is that the United States never was looking to create any democracy in Iraq just like it's not looking to create democracy anywhere else it's basically in the region to keep its hegemony intact the United States supports Saudi Arabia the the regime that has been exporting waha BISM across the world the ideology of Isis and al-qaeda and they have no problem with that in the case of Iraq the United States thought that they could overthrow the country they could scare their own people if you remember that the dossier and the 45 minutes where they they were claiming that Saddam Hussein could you know the day the Sun and the Daily Star and England were saying we could be attacked in 45 minutes and then Kelly the he revealed information that this was all nonsense and he ultimately committed suicide or he died somehow all if we recall all these and younger generation recalls how the United States prepared the public and proof what created fear in the West so that they could attack this country was basically through fear through lies they attack the country they destroyed the country and they were hoping that they could plunder the country they could you they could start exporting Iraqi oil and make up for any losses that they had as a result of the attack and the problem is is that the Iraqi people they were freed from Saddam Hussein and they did not like the occupation either and they wanted better relations with Iran and the the very fact that an elected government in Iraq wants good relations with Iran is something sinful to the Americans they say that this is the Iranian presence in Iraq no it's it's an order it's normal relations that have been established between two neighboring countries yet the Americans cannot tolerate that so I think the whole problem is that the United States how it presents itself to the world is that it's a democracy that it promotes democracy but in reality it is a regime that is only trying to preserve its own interests it is Orientalist the the culture of the political regime in the United States and in Europe they are Orientalist that's why you fake the Saudis can kill hundreds of thousands of people through starvation and disease in Yemen and no one in Europe will care no one in Europe will be ashamed of the war crimes that their governments are being carried out because they're Yemenis you know you're not white Europeans right the same is true in Libya the same is true in Afghanistan and so on you know in can you you know reflect upon that because because because there is no reflection and taking of responsibility for what has happened in Iraq and that that assures the same strategy will be applied again and I'm thinking of course all of us are thinking about Iran the same mechanisms are in place the lack of democracy in Iran you know they never mentioned the fact that there is no there is a democracy in Iran and it's an Islamic democracy it's what the Iranian people seem to be content with but they you know Saudi Arabia the closest ally one of the closest allies of the United States in the Middle East has no democracy whatsoever we never hear about that but we'll you know Iran will be targeted for democracy change you know when they already have it I mean again the American people are so grossly uninformed go ahead Ken you know there's a couple of points that need to be made here one the war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be overstated in Fallujah they are advising women not have children because we use so much depleted uranium white phosphorus which is a chemical weapon and other experimental weapons that the area is so toxic that the birth defect rates have gone through the roof child cancers and if you've ever seen the pictures of these depleted uranium babies and you know what the definition of crime against humanity is it is disgusting and criminal beyond description the other point that needs to be made that while Saddam Hussein was in power there was no al-qaeda in Iraq in fact Saddam Hussein would have been the first one to execute anyone who would have been found to be linked to al-qaeda and then if we're to believe the official version of history after the occupation we're supposed to believe that this Isis creation which is a creation of Western intelligence agencies we're supposed to believe that all of a sudden all these Humvees and all these American weapons just accidentally fell into the hands of Isis which wreaked havoc cutting off heads all over that region all over Iraq we're supposed to believe that that was an accident all the while as Muhammad is mentioned and you've just mentioned our best friend and ally in Saudi Arabia which by the way is an extension of Israel Saudi Arabia the exporter of all of that Wahhabi doctrine which is the the seabed of Isis is our best friend and Ally so we created the context in which Isis was created and Isis has wreaked havoc and it was never a popular movement at all every genuine Muslim knows damn well that Isis is an affront to Islam and even in Basra on a yearly basis last year was it reported in the Western media at all that there was about 20 million 20 million Muslims who protested and demonstrated against Isis and were making clear that Isis has nothing to do with genuine Islam we created that and again I say that's not an accident the creation of Isis is not an accident we know that al-qaeda is the CIA database that was not an accident these are the Frankenstein's that Western intelligence agencies and Mossad create in order to justify our policies in the region which are basically to destroy that entire region to balkanize that region so that ultimately Israel can expand you know in American the American government is bought and paid for by Israel and it couldn't be more obvious Netanyahu's three visits to the US Congress were these sycophants traders in the US Congress sit there and give him 29 standing ovations 29 standing ovations tells you everything about who owns the US Congress which is nothing but a den of traitors Christopher reflect upon you know 15 years on I mean how is the United States moved forward with its interests in the region because it seems to me that particularly since the end of the Cold War just about everything the US does in the Middle East backfires blows up in its face and just leaves in its wake chaos I mean that the you know I'm always you know asking the question and where is the learning curve because I don't see any of it here unless it's intentional as our other guests have said is just to sow chaos I don't know is that in the interest of the United States and the American people and spending so much on the military for that go ahead Christopher well I think that the other problem is the u.s. never gets credit for the good it does I mean that's that's another issue that's perennial is the grass I mean the fact is first of all the u.s. gives Israel money not the other way around so if anything it should be the other way around in that particular example but the bottom line is when it comes to because the you have been is only about that's why we give them that money keep going Christopher keep well keep going Christopher Kent can you get your ten minutes look at the bottom line is in the crimes against humanity we completely forgot about Saddam Hussein kidnapping people gassing their own people his son running around like a total crime family and then in the instance of the idea that Iran is some flourishing democracy imagine here in the States if the Trump administration had appointees in Congress in the judiciary where the entire government it's all the clerics every single branch of government is completely occupied Christopher by the religious leaders Christopher no you know I I think you're a good person and I think your hearts in the right place but why is it the responsibility of the United States to be determining what kind of political culture is in a foreign country halfway around the world okay I mean the United States has the highest and car duration level in the world while maybe the US should work on that or its opiate crisis you know III don't see the thing is this whole approach Lauren ace you know that 320 million people it's a totally different virtues I I don't because I think that's that has nothing to do with politics okay you know that and I also this is crosstalk Peter you do invite you do invite people to chime in so I'm gonna chime in here now you try and tell you try and tell the Iraqi people who've lost a million to two million the millions of orphans I've met orphans in Baghdad who lost both parents they have nothing so don't you dare tell me and and nevermind me don't you dare tell the people of Iraq the good that the United States has done lives have been destroyed what if it was your child who was blown to bits would you say oh well you know they did help us take out a dictator through all of us through all of his worst crimes can't through all of his worst crimes the United States supported Saddam Hussein so that let me so tell me we care about the rights of the people there Christopher reply oh well I mean I was I was there in 2003 Ken I don't know if you were but the bottom line is you know we're building roads were feeding people like I was there and I've seen the real effective war and for okay great in 2003 in 2003 you were I was before the invasion and I came back a year later we built rows so that makes killing a million to two million okay okay all right have you covered the Iraqi crime family who day Hussein and all that you didn't touch anything on that see it's always one-dimensional the US if it's some point if Iraq because their people don't want to run with my we supported Saddam Hussein through all of his hand we're rapidly running out of time want to go to Mohammed in Tehran we also forgot about 1991 but okay later Mohammed look and in and I think that the problem is is that your guest doesn't recognize that Saddam Hussein again as I said earlier was created with the help of the United States when he gassed his own people he did it he did it with us support he did it with European support the only time this became an issue was after Saddam invaded Kuwait the United States has no has done no favors to the Iraqi people the destruction of Iraq for the last 40 years was because of the United States as I said and you were alluding to to my 1991 in 1991 when the Iraqi people after the regime lost its battle in Kuwait they rose up against the regime and the Americans prevented Saddam Hussein from collapsing they allowed him to use his despite the no-fly zone denied him to use virtually gentlemen we've run out of time fascinating topic here many thanks in I guess in Calgary Washington and in Tehran and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
