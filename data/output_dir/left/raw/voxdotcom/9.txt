1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,350
In October of 2014, Jason Van Dyke - a white
Chicago police officer - shot and killed Laquan

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,030
McDonald - a black teenager.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,870
A year after the shooting, the city released
the graphic video that captured the incident.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,090
It shows McDonald walking down a busy roadway,
holding a knife.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,660
As he walks away from the officers, Van Dyke
shoots him.

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,220
16 times.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,220
“16 shots.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,380
16 shots.”

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,980
The response to the release of the footage
was swift and widespread.

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,030
Chicago residents protested.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,010
The police chief was fired.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,680
The state’s attorney was voted out.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,360
A Justice Department investigation unearthed
a pattern of excessive deadly force and racial

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,020
bias among Chicago Police officers.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,960
And for the first time in more than 30 years,
a Chicago police officer faced murder charges.

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,120
While police officers who end up in court
often prefer a judge to hear their case, Van

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,399
Dyke opted for a jury.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,699
But here’s the thing about that jury.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,320
It didn’t look like the population of Cook
County, where the shooting took place.

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,180
In a county where almost a quarter of people
are black, there was only one black juror.

21
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,880
When it comes to justice in America, race
has always been a part of the equation...So

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,040
what happens when a “jury of peers,” doesn’t
actually look like our peers?

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,700
“A good citizen will perform basic civic
duties.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,860
Your duty to serve on the jury goes with your
right to trial by jury”

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,580
Here’s how jury selection works.

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,200
First, prospective jurors are picked for duty
out of a large pool.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Usually, a list of registered voters or licensed
drivers.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Then comes a process called “voir dire”
or “to speak the truth.”

29
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,900
Prospective jurors are questioned by lawyers
on both sides.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,880
They’re looking for bias.

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,720
Like in this scene in “The Devil’s Advocate”
where a lawyer is trying to gauge the jury

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,620
for bias against bankers.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,000
“Do you think as a juror you might be able
to set aside any prior opinions you might

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,310
hold of the savings and loan industry?”

35
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,520
If a lawyer has reason to believe a juror
will be biased, they can ask the judge to

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,480
dismiss the juror with cause.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,630
Each side can also strike a certain number
of  jurors without giving a reason.

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,730
These are called “peremptory challenges,”
and this is where things get tricky.

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,900
While lawyers aren’t technically allowed
to use these challenges to discriminate on

40
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,310
the basis of race or sex,
that doesn’t mean they don’t try.

41
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,280
Like in this scene from the TV show How to
Get Away with Murder.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,051
“We have to look for jurors who are prone
to distrust authority.

43
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,170
What are some of the signifiers of this?

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,190
Number one is race.

45
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,580
There’s a larger distrust of police among
black Americans.

46
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,150
You don’t call the police in my neighborhood.”

47
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,860
The racial balance of a jury can impact the
verdict.

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,880
Studies have shown that all-white juries are
harsher on black defendants, make more errors,

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,200
and discuss less of the case facts.

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,790
And in another study, in cases with a black
defendant and white victim, having one or

51
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,750
more black male jurors lowered the likelihood
of a death sentence - by a lot.

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,280
“A difficult day for jurors in the OJ Simpson
murder trial.”

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,840
It’s why - in high-profile, racially charged,
trials like that of OJ Simpson - so much attention

54
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,500
was given to the fact that the jury had nine
black members on it...

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,940
"The jury has spoken."

56
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,500
and Simpson was acquitted.

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,860
There’s also the disturbing case of Emmett
Till.

58
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,830
In 1955, two Mississippi men - Roy Bryant
and J.W.

59
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,270
Milam - were accused of kidnapping and brutally
murdering a 14-year-old black boy named Emmett

60
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,760
Till.

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Bryant’s wife alleged that the boy had touched
her hand and waist, and whistled at her in

62
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,819
a grocery store.

63
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,500
Emmett Till’s body was found days later
in the Tallahatchie River, beaten, shot, and

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,310
tied to a cotton gin with barbed wire.

65
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Bryant and Milam were arrested and charged
with murder.

66
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,099
But the trial of Bryant and Milam would be
decided by a jury...a jury that consisted

67
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,080
of 12 white men.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,569
Despite multiple witnesses seeing the two
men take the boy, and one that saw the back

69
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:17,079
of Milam’s truck dripping with blood - “a
jury of twelve white neighbors of the defendants

70
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,029
reached the verdict after one hour and five
minutes of deliberations”

71
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,050
The men would walk free.

72
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,560
Decades later, Bryant’s wife - who made
that first accusation against Emmett Till

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
- recanted her story.

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,710
Fast forward thirty years later, and all-white
juries still weren’t a thing of the past.

75
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,660
In the 1986 case Batson vs. Kentucky, a prosecutor
used his peremptory challenges to remove all

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,930
four black jurors from the pool.

77
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,490
The defendant’s appeal made it all the way
to the Supreme Court.

78
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,200
And won.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,360
Today, if one side suspects the other of using
peremptory strikes to racially discriminate,

80
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,490
they can file what’s called a Batson challenge.

81
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,870
But...the problem is….

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:06,480
"Yeah so Batson is pretty much
widely regarded as a failure."

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,410
If a lawyer accuses the other side of excluding
a juror because of race, the judge then has

84
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,850
to decide whether it’s discriminatory.

85
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,521
The accused would have to come up with a reason
- any reason - that’s race neutral, for

86
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,900
why they don’t want that juror.

87
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,710
"Courts have really allowed
kind of any reason."

88
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,570
"For example like an attorney might say ‘well
I struck all the people who seem suspicious

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,160
of the police.’

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,480
And so that would on its face be racially
neutral but it's still kind of allows for

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,150
that disproportionate impact."

92
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,930
You can see that in this leaked 1987 training
video in which attorney Jack McMahon explains

93
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,949
how to exclude black people and get away with
it.

94
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:56,360
“There's the blacks from low-income areas
are less likely to convict… and as a result

95
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,139
you don’t want those people on your jury.

96
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,920
Batson vs. Kentucky, I'm sure you've all become aware of that...

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,310
The best way to avoid
problems is to protect yourself.

98
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,260
When you do have a black jury, you question
them at length, on this little sheet that

99
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,010
you have mark something down that you can
articulate. Say well the woman had a kid the

100
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,830
same age as defendant and I thought sh’ed
be sympathetic to him.

101
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,570
Or she’s unemployed and I just don’t like
unemployed people because I find they’re not too

102
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,570
stable.”

103
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,970
This kind of strategy has led to a pattern
of excluding black jurors across the country.

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:34,190
And in North Carolina, between 1990 and 2010
-- prosecutors struck black jurors 2.5 times

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,600
as often as non black jurors.

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,300
Another report found half of all juries that
delivered death sentences in Houston County,

107
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,780
Alabama, between 2005 and 2009 were all white.

108
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,669
The other half had a single black juror...even
though the county is 27 percent black.

109
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:57,310
And Ann Eisenberg did a study that showed
the prosecution struck 35 percent of black

110
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,490
jurors in South Carolina who made it through
the voir dire process compared to 12 percent

111
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,490
of white jurors.

112
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:09,050
"I asked a colleague of mine
when I finished this study I said you know

113
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,259
okay I've shown this you know what of it now?

114
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,680
There's so much evidence."

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,500
"And he said 'yeah, proving that racial discrimination
effects jury selection is like proving that

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,780
the sun rises.' "

117
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,000
But there might be signs of progress.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,370
In the case of Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago
police officer who shot Laquan McDonald, a

119
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,200
majority white jury convicted him of murder.

120
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,620
It was Chicago’s first murder conviction
of a police officer in 50 years.

121
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,560
They found him guilty of second degree murder,
a lesser charge.

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,420
And guilty of all 16 counts of aggravated
battery.

123
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,960
One for each shot at Laquan McDonald.

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
“We the jury find the defendant Jason Van Dyke guilty of

125
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,100
aggravated battery with a firearm, 16th shot.”

126
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,660
Thanks for watching.

127
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,651
There’s a lot I couldn’t fit into the
video, like how do we fix the problem of racial

128
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:11,310
discrimination in jury selection?

129
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,440
Over the years lawyers have suggested solutions
like

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,180
choosing from a bigger jury pool of underrepresented

131
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,330
people that aren’t on voter registration
lists or driver license lists.

132
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,490
Or getting rid of peremptory challenges altogether.

133
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,949
It’s a complicated problem to solve but
there are procedural tweaks that could make

134
00:08:27,949 --> 00:00:00,000
the system a lot more fair.
