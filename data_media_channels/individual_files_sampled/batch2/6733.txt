Trump recently held an event to thank Border Patrol agents for doing a great job in his eyes and there was an interesting interaction that happened when he called a man by the name of Adrienne Anzu and Zulu de Idaho say his name but anyway he's a Border Patrol agent yeah sorry man Adrienne is also he's a Hispanic American Border Patrol agent and also a dog handler from Texas okay so here's the interaction that he had with Trump up on stage how did you come recommit you're not nervous she speaks perfect English come here I want to ask you about that 78 lives you saved 78 people oh why wouldn't he speak perfect English she's an American he speaks perfect English that's unbelievable Cameron I know we've gotten used to it and I know that the right wing is triggered anytime the word racist is used and they need a safe space but why would you turn to a Latino guy who you're celebrating an ice agent that you're trying to applaud and go he speaks perfect English it's amazing woody come on if he was calling up Betsy DeVos what do you play Here Come Betsy DeVos she speaks perfect English why would he say that like Ryan's inky speaks burping English come on up Ryan like why it's such a random thing to say anyway he can't help himself he really can't help himself but what I also love is the rest of the interaction which I'll explain to you so he's the border patrol agent is being rewarded because he caught a smuggler who's trying to smuggle 78 individuals across the border now these are people who are trying to get into the United States these are not people who are you know in imminent danger at that moment because they're literally trying to escape their own countries from imminent danger now with that said he's like ah you saved you saved these people's lives no he didn't he caught these people and they're gonna get deported back he's not saving their lives in fact based on what's likely to happen to them they could deal with you know extreme crime their safety could be at risk as a result of that so I want to clarify that second part of it though Trump was like how did you do it how did you this is amazing how did you accomplish this and so he responded by saying that he had his dog he said he ran the dog to search the car then open the latch to reveal quote a lot of subjects Wow how did you do it though that sounds so amazing okay well good job by the dog in as we all know animal sorry okay look a lot of people are smuggle to the country in those kind of trucks and then they come here and then and they send money back to their family and that's why they went through all that hardship etc etc we understand that and sometimes people do die in those conditions if it's really hot and they don't do it right etc so sometimes it can save lives and in the case of this gentleman it's his job he did his job like there what he didn't like risk his life he didn't do anything he has a dog the dog sniffed the vehicle the dog then found people and then those people got arrested by the way these people are at the border at this at this point yeah so they would have made it yeah okay so he didn't really save their lives it's potential in a different situation you might have saved their lives but probably not in that one but but we're not done with the goofiness from Donald Trump he kept praising ice and Customs and Border Protection mmm now you guys can figure out what the initial sort of Customs and Border Protection are right it's obviously CBP throughout the press conference he kept calling it CBC he's like oh these guys at CBC are amazing people like what CBC what's going on who's CBC these guys some of these guys at CBC that our Americans even speak English come on up here Adrian it's incredible like I I think about Sarah Palin a lot I do yeah cuz it turns out she got a raw deal she really did get a raw deal like Sarah Palin like don't get me wrong she said a lot of stupid things but I would argue that Trump has said much stupider things and for some reason he gets celebrated when things do whereas Sarah Palin I mean got the raw deal like ya know and of course nobody's got any love for Sarah Palin and she got everything she had coming to her right she couldn't even name a single newspaper that she read she couldn't name a Supreme Court case the center but Supreme Court cases what Donald Trump it means a new low he can barely speak English ironically given this story have you seen his tweets just the other day he misses misspelled special counsel for like the 12th time yeah it's a special counsel investigating you you've misspelled it over and over again and he misspelled but again in a Twitter rant if Sarah Palin had done 10% of what Donald Trump and she did and people ripped into her but so now you think hey look a lot of people have criticized Donald Trump that's true to be fair right but do people characterize Donald Trump as stupid as Sarah Palin generally speaking they don't was an obvious exception of us I can't stop telling you how stupid he is because it's partly frustrating to me that the rest of the media for all their criticism of Donald Trump from time to time will still talk about his strategy and how oh but he was a big successful businessman no he wasn't he wouldn't have taken seven bankruptcies for you to realize that he was a terrible businessman he went bankrupt six times and I can go on and on he's way dumber than Sarah Palin right I mean look just think about the debate that Sarah Palin had with Joe Biden now I didn't agree with her at all during that debate but she carried herself well way better than Trump ever has and it wasn't a major disappointment we were thinking it was gonna be a complete disaster and it wasn't so no matter what you think of her in that debate at Sarah the flubs that she made that are still legendary Donald Trump makes on a daily basis every single time you're right about at least three times a day so just keep it real on who the dumbest guy in politics is and it's definitely Donald Trump like this video that's great and you never have to miss another episode of TYT by hitting the subscribe button below and
