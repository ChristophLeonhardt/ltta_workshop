5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,170

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,759
it in my head and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always colder</font>

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,500
than I think it is which I don't think

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,050
is a really good sign but oh well today

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,720

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,910
back we started on wednesday last week

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,039

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,310
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go travelling all weekend</font>

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,779
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one of the classes I'm taking is</font>

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,170
actually beginners ballet let's see how

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that goes because my posture is really</font>

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,950
really bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also swapped my desk chair</font>

19
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,899
which you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind me for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Swiss</font>

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,670
ball which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you can see</font>

21
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see me rolling around on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,149
great right now I'm reading the story of

23
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,280
Buddhism which is nonfiction and it's

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually for when my religion classes by</font>

25
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,860
donald s lopez jr who is a professor at

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,920
the University of Michigan we construct

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
religion is like these pretty coherent

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,539
sets of like beliefs and doctrines and

29
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,430
practices and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really how</font>

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,459
it works and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> erroneous</font>

31
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,140
that whole idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just by reading the</font>

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,970
story but is its kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of historical and</font>

33
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,030
social and anthropological and all these

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,619
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are skin tight so I've</font>

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,479
been enjoying that a lot still reading

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Moby Dick haven't finished that yet</font>

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,650

39
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,400
lots of other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks the</font>

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,930
exciting side projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font>

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,610
won't know about for a while still

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,020
trying to write I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting excited</font>

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,970
because I've got a lot of trips coming

44
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,650
up that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for and save</font>

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,860
for and channel money into somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,420
that's kind of where my life is right

47
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,369
now it also occurred to me that you guys

48
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,650
had seen my map which is probably the

49
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">most amazing thing ever but for my Swiss</font>

50

51
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,600
can see you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it finish this</font>

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,090

53
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,600
post-it note flags with a date and names

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,250

58
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,399
a lot of this map covered up with people

59
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,649
orange flags but practically that might

60
00:02:07,649 --> 00:00:00,000
not be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case that's all for me today</font>
