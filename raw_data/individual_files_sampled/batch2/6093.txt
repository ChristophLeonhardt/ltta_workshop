Before we jump into the next clip I just want to tell you real quick we got a new audio network go to T y-t-dot-com slash audio and get all of our new podcasts so CNN did a fun article and I will take it in the spirit of it I think it was intended and they titled it the definitive ranking of 2020 Democrats okay now that's bold so I like that and I think they're being tongue-in-cheek to be fair I don't think that they really think it's the definitive ranking especially this far out it's certainly clique baby I mean I think I think anyone would want to click on that and see what they have to send to be fair I clicked on it right okay and so I don't mind the over-the-top title that's fun okay so let's I don't want to go through the whole list for you guys but I thought one was particularly interesting or two of them so where did Bernie Sanders come in right now he came a second last time wait a minute it turns out number five now when Hillary Clinton came in second to Barack Obama she was assumed to be the number one candidate next time in fact she was assumed to be the number one Kennedys so much people said you should even primary her it would be terrible for the Democratic Party for anyone to challenge her now Bernie Sanders also happens to be the most popular politician in the country and in the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton if she had those kind of numbers they did it anyway but if she had those numbers they'd be like everybody get out of the race get out of the race get out of the race clear the field we got to save money so we could fight the Republicans no he's not number one he's not number two number three number four no he's down at number five but okay to beat let's again let's be fair why so this is one of the reasons why I said so why is Sanders not higher he's a white male and Democrats may be looking to turn the page from 2016 okay can we stop for a second so I know that progressives get painted in this picture where we want to give people certain advantages simply because they're a minority or because they're a woman and I do agree that some people like that do exist right they do think that way which infuriates me which is what we also experience during the 2016 election where some women in the Democratic Party shamed other women in the Democratic Party for wanting to vote for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton during the primaries because Hillary is a woman you should vote for a woman but no it doesn't work that way and it shouldn't work that way that it look you want equality of opportunity right you want to hear people out and you want to hear their case and you want to decide based on their policy proposals whether or not that is the right person to represent you so the idea of me looking at a guy and thinking you're a white guy so I'm I'm just gonna by default say no that is not smart thinking don't do that please I'm begging people don't think that way yes so we fight against racism we fight against sexism we fight against all those things but that doesn't mean people should be disqualified based on their race or sex that's a preposterous thought and the question is how good are you on those issues right anyway so that's a good point politically but for the purposes of this I was most amused by the reasoning he's a now and they might be projecting onto the Democrats so the Democrats don't want or maybe they don't but but they said look since he's a white male he he does not stand as good a chance plus it's old news 2016 you don't want to do we do a retread of somebody from 2016 so old white male no so curious to see who came in number one so let's take a look white male a retread from politics of 2016 and Beyond and by the way he is just as old as Bernie Sanders is he really yes so no excuse I thought that maybe he was slightly younger but he might be younger by a year or less like so they're nearly identical so no excuse like oh no no we can't have the retreads of white males no that's why Joe Biden number one I mean I don't know if they just realize how funny the hypocrisy of that statement no it's insane and by the way just to reiterate like my desire for birdie to be higher on that list as opposed to Biden has nothing to do with the fact that there you know white males so I'm not against Biden for being a white male that would be preposterous but I think Biden has wonderful qualities however I think that he has a blind spot a huge blind spot when it comes to what you know the the people who want wanted Bernie Sanders really desire in a leader so no no it's not even close look and look we'll find out who's right and who's wrong it to me and it's not because of and it's easy for people to say I don't believe you right but it's not because of my bias so I'll give you an example right so I I can't stand Donald Trump and I said that he would win the Republican primary in June of 2015 put aside the general election and all that stuff in the primaries June of 2015 66 months before the voting I couldn't stand him and I said look I can see the polling I can see how the fervor he's gonna win and they keep attacking each other and not Donald Trump that's a terrible strategy he's gonna win right and I'm telling you right now the number overwhelming number one candidate for 2020 is Bernie Sanders not because I agree with him he has gigantic name recognition his popularity is through the roof now Biden is also popular to be fair to Biden okay and so let me read you CNN's logic for why they picked Biden and I'll tell you what's wrong with it okay they said the former vice president may not seem like the perfect fit for the moment in the Democratic Party he's older 75 white male and has been a electoral politics for more than four decades and yet Biden is something that no other candidate in the field has what is it he's first he's on top of early polls gauging the 2020 field so is Bernie Sanders but you put him at number 5 he's leading in national polls so is Bernie Sanders to be fair to Biden sometimes bynes number one sometimes Sanders is number one but according to this logic Sanders should at least be number two right anyway he's leading in national polls early primary state polls and in a matchup against Trump Sanders pushes against Trump in the same polls they say that's no guarantee Biden wins the nomination but if history holds is an indicator he'll be right there until the end also not sure none of that is true except for the fact that Biden does do well in the polls so we're traveling to actual facts now why do I think Biden will fade and this idea that he always that is there too till the end because he's not always there till the end I've seen him in three different elections he goes out immediately so in 2008 and I like Biden but in 2008 he went out after Iowa that's the first state and he came in not second or third or fourth he came in fifth in Iowa and left the race immediately so 1988 left the race every race he fades and Joe Lieberman who was at the top of the polls in 2004 I'm sorry 2008 in the beginning why because he had a lot of name recognition because he was Al Gore's VP nominee right he was on the ticket but he was not popular among Democrats and it was super obvious and every psycho joe lieberman jolie would now they talk about Joe Biden Joe Biden as good a guy as he is he's terrible in primaries so if you that's amazing that we're two people who presumably are a number of people that look at the same fact pattern and they go Biden obviously older white male does great in primaries I have some thoughts on this as well because if you look at the reasoning that they gave for this definitive ranking the reality is all of the reasons have everything to do with perceptions about the horse race as opposed to policy and that is the mistake that CNN made throughout the entire 2016 election they did not care about policy they did not care to ask about policy at least specific detailed follow-up questions pertaining to quality when they were hosting the debates and so that is a huge weakness that they have when it comes to making predictions the reason why people liked Bernie Sanders had nothing to do with his race or his gender or his clothing or how he combs his hair it had nothing to do with that you know everything to do with the fact that he was willing to talk about the policies and actually appeal to the real concerns that Americans have today and so the same strategy was used by Trump actually right I mean Trump didn't mean anything he said and I think that he's proven that time and time again throughout his presidency but talking about the issues that actually matter to Americans is a better indicator as opposed to is it a man and do Democrats want a man a white man no way let's we're smarter than that let's move on and especially Millennials and they are rising and especially the Bernie Sanders orders and now here's the name recognition etc but look I had only it's bad intent I just think that they live in their bubble and I'm sure they think we're in a bubble but we've been proven right a couple of times I mean this is the same folks who again they don't mean bad by it but they missed Acacio cortez completely whereas we did 34 videos on her and we told you before the election and we told you what was coming and and it's because we can feel the progressive energy it's not gonna be close so and in there groupthink in Washington they think about those things oh wow who's what race what sex that's what everybody in Washington is buzzing about calm well Harris is in great shape because she's african-american and a female yeah but what's your policy position in that right and in youth and they come from a world of television where television doesn't talk about policy so they think well nobody cares but now we've got a whole generation that grew up on the internet where you could look anything up so you actually do care about policy because you could look at a good research at etc I know you don't believe that but it is the case and so and then finally it in one of the reasons for why it won't be Bernie Sanders they said well you know I don't know if the Democratic Party is ready for a guy who was independent and not technically a Democrat that's the thing that only people in Washington say I'm not saying that there isn't seventeen other people in the country who feel that way but the overwhelming majority of the voters and you could see it in the polls or like what I know am I getting Medicare for all or am I not getting it am I getting a higher wage or am I not getting it do my kids have a chance at college or do they not does this guy care about me does he not care about me and so Biden by the way does great in caring about people so that would be a fair thing to point about he's really good at ammo that and but what are you talking about oh but technically he's not a Democrat no one outside of Washington cares about that you're missing the whole thing and with his name recognition and the love that he's got and I'm gonna say something they're gonna find outrageous I'm watching a documentary on Bobby Kennedy now and Bernie Sanders reminds me of Bobby Kennedy why you're crazy Bobby Kennedy was young and dynamic first of all pretties dynamic no but the thing that is similar is when Bobby went through the streets people were all over him and they were excited because he did things for regular Americans once Bobby Kennedy called a landlord in the middle of New York when he was a senator from New York and said we've got rats biting the babies in your building and the tenant landlord couldn't believe that a senator would care about somebody in Harlem that's amazing and and that is why Bobby Kennedy was beloved and people don't Bernie Sanders cares people know that Bernie Sanders is gonna make that call they know it in their hearts they know it in their minds he's going to crush the field two easy ways folly
