Venezuela is gripped by crisis ravaged by economic collapse and marred by political decay the government of Nicolas Maduro faces an existential threat my little has been ruling in the middle of a perfect storm Latin America's once model democracy struggles to maintain order and feed a divided people we have never seen a deterioration of living standards of this magnitude almost anywhere in the world a nation boasting the world's largest oil reserves fights for economic survival as it's pulled further apart polarization is their racially is their regionally is their by class it's there in multiple multiple ways but the seeds of its current demise was so in a century ago when the events of its formative years ensured that the fate of Venezuela would be written in oil this country that was once that the wealthiest in the region what went wrong how did we get to this point in Venezuela the country starts a modernization process that is shaped by oil this petrol state becomes more and more powerful and they shake that country through the stick Chavez and then Maduro spree him try to create a socialist revolution and that led these people to destroy the whole business apparatus of that country that unemployment did go down equality increased per capita GDP increased of course you could say that seekers of oil wealth at the same time that oil wealth could have been distributed completely differently and I would say was distributed much more equitably and I thought it was a very backward country before oil but is it one of the poorest of Latin America life expectancy was in your early 30s and about three-quarters of the country was illiterate it's very difficult to speak of a national polity much less of a national culture then we have an extraordinary developments in 1914 when Venezuela sinks its first wells and begins pumping oil for the first time Venezuela enters the era of commercial heavy oil production and not only is the British and the Dutch involved but now the u.s. also comes to Venezuela to partake in oils production foreign oil giants such as Royal Dutch Shell and the American Standard Oil Company were granted concessions by the military dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gomez allowing them to drill for oil and allowing gomez to get rich the arrival of the oil companies the development of the industry parallels the rise of 1/b sent they Gomez and the rise of the Venezuelan state even though Venezuela really begins to develop its loyal economy the Venezuelan state doesn't benefit hugely because in essence it's only charging rent for the land by the mid-1930s the once loose collective of largely coffee exporting regions had become a consolidated nation state formed and transformed by oil we have the beginnings of a mass process of urbanization so people coming out of the rural countryside and city the big cities because the major landowners are selling off their land to the oil companies the very idea of oil became imbued with the notion of modernity that the oil camps with the North American presence the British presence with electricity water sewage would then become social laboratories that other Venezuelans should emulate on the one hand there were people who were living in the oil camps who received all the benefits of working for all companies and then on the outside of these camps you had the majority of Venezuelan society who didn't have access to all of the health care and benefits and education benefits Juan Vicente Gomez died in 1935 but he laid the blueprint for other dictators to follow developing infrastructure suppressing dissent and getting rich off oil deals the first half of the 20th century would see Venezuela ruled by oppressive military regimes for all but three years when a popular push for democracy in 1945 briefly unseated dictatorship but the political parties cemented in that democratic interlude acción democrática ad and cop a Christian Democrats remained a persistent opposition to authoritarian rule by the mid 1950s the rule of another dictator general Marcos pérez jiménez would create a vastly expanded and increasingly unequal State we enter what some of call the bulldozer years in Venezuela the state will now use the funds the the profits of oil to engage in broad scale developmentalists projects those are all great opportunities for development but also for corruption because in process of developing those projects the military and their associates were all benefitting tremendously the big problem is that the only way pérez jiménez can maintain himself in power is through brutal repression what we see is a real clamp down brutal clamp down on political opposition you start to seeing also the very clear parameters of - Venezuela's the Venezuela the benefits from oil and the Venezuela that actually still remains in the shadow of the oil industry in that Venezuela is rural that Venezuela is poor that Venezuela is illiterate that Venezuela is seeing and looking at the evolution of the other but it's not benefiting from it as Venezuela's elite got richer and its poor were getting left behind the forces for democracy once again dared to take on a dictator you begin to see rumblings in the military you begin to see younger officers protest in much the same way they had protested before there's also an active social movement being led by dissidents in the Communist Party in acción democrática even the Social Democrats and others there are actually cooperating to undermine bata see - so pérez jiménez is effectively overthrown through another coup which then brings us democracy in Venezuela in 1958 democracy had fallen to dictatorship a decade earlier for it now to survive unity was a must there is an attempt to form a pact so ad comes to the table with its union and party political framework cop a comes to the table the Christian Democrat right so what you have around the table is essentially all of the key financial and political interests in the country the Roman Catholic Church is also essentially party to these negotiations as is the military these parties signed the pact or Punto fijo and began well was has been called in Venezuela the punt of his book meaning there was an agreement in which the parties agreed not to go in conflicts that could put at risk Venezuelan democracy Venezuela was moving inexorably toward the so-called first world with growing confidence it had broken the cycle of military coos and now the Punto fijo pact ensured progress would be underwritten by democratic process and its alliance is a kind of golden age because it has its modernization going on now for two decades and it also has now a democracy that begins to be an example for the rest of Latin America in 1960 Venezuela helped establish the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and in 1973 following the hike in oil prices after war in the Middle East it was awash with petrol dollars Venezuela was asserting itself as a global player and in Carlos Andres Perez it would have a president ready to take the next big step and take back its oil that was the dream of democracy and some colors and this is I've got the money why not let's do it and so we nationalized the oil industry in 1975 it is called beta visa petróleos de Venezuela is yeah what it essentially does is it nationalizes the bureaucracy of oil exploration its nationalization to create a company rather than nationalization of Venezuela's oil sector to say many of the world workers maintain their privileged status and the oil camps and this is a period in Venezuela that many refer to as la Venezuela Solita an image of Saudi Venezuela in which the notion is in one of the terms in Venezuela's Dawa righto amigos is cheap to me too and Venezuela had that kind of wealth the dream of a state-owned oil company had been realized with peda VESA president Carlos Andres Paris now embarked on a nationwide spending spree funding social programs housing projects and nationalizing industries with the price of crude oil at a record high such lavish spending could also be supplemented by borrowing he wanted Minnesota to be an industrialized country and he thought this we could be done because we had a lot of money so this idea also puts us in loans and more loans and more money that continues as long as the price of oil is good because the oil price begins to fall back Venezuela doesn't reduce its financial outlays you have this huge bureaucracy which also emerges in Venezuela and huge amounts of corruption government high post implicitly had the benefit of helping yourself and helping others in your social circle but instead of addressing any of these problems the strategy of the government is instead to oarai money the debt becomes more difficult to pay under that environment actually more critical means is the election of 1979 and you have to go more to a market economy inflation begins to take off corruption becomes an even more profound problem and yet we have no effort made by any of the governments in the 1980s to actually address the overwhelming reliance on oil which was falling in value successive governments of acción democrática and co-pay did little to check the economic decline social inequality and the corruption of a ruling class in December 1988 Carlos Andres Paris was reelected to office promising to bring back the cash which glorious of his first term but rhetoric would be trumped by reality once he is sworn into power he he tells he tells the Minister people I already negotiated and I'm going to the island Venezuela had to go to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to saying there was no choice no choice at that time because Venezuela was indepted Venezuela had to go to some adjustment structural adjustment to launch the growth again the problem is Gregg this IMF loan comes with some very difficult terms and conditions you have you have a segment of the population that hasn't benefited from the boom times living conditions have been deteriorating through the 80s and now comes this IMF loan where yet again they're feeling the effects should Paris have anticipated this well if you yes you should have certainly on because it affected again the poor who had been already suffering it affects them even more but I would say I just one step back also in terms of it was there an alternative I think we have to keep in mind on the one hand that at that time the neoliberal kind of policy and paradigm was absolutely hegemonic and around the world and so it certainly appeared that way I think that there was no alternative I would argue from today's perspective it there probably were some alternatives one of them would have been perhaps to actually default on the debt which of course you know has all kinds of other consequences one can talk about trying to for example tax the wealthy more or some other way of raising revenues other than cutting back on the parts that have an impact on the poor Oh what do you say to that Carlos people were still suffering in terms of unemployment and wages yeah because when you change when you have to the idea in the second Carlos Andres Paris government was that the consequence resorting on oil resources couldn't be depending on the state resources they had to promote private entrepreneurship they have to promote the participation of a business we had to promote foreign national investment in oil in another industries that were state-owned how could change always implies pain and to listening to lessen the pain for the majority there were some of the most advanced social programs at the time that later on were you know taken by Brazil in Mexico too long who is feeling that yeah I have a different perspective on that I mean you would you want to change us from from one day to the other into a free-market economy when we have been a state economy throughout all 20th century I mean you can't do that and I think the problem was not that the change had to come and we are still we still haven't been able to have a market economy in some way that will let us to feed up the population the 30 million of an assurance that we are but the problem was the way it was it was put out it was a political problem the political problem was candles and they said you know what we can't take this anymore we're changing and we're going to do a radical change what also had a played a major role in that moment was the fact that Kevin Saunders Pettis ran on a platform that was anti neoliberal when he ran for president and then made this big turnaround I mean that's what I think has a major impact on what happened afterwards as well actually I think that's not accurate because he said in his electoral campaign that he was going to bring major changes in in Venezuela and the economy and political realm but what is true is that he represented the gold in the golden years that we had in the 1970s is that your understanding when he was perceived in one way and then does the opposite and that was exactly what was this adding insult to injury I mean the injury being the the cutbacks on on subsidies for transportation or for food and at the same time this is not what we thought we were voting for yeah I think there was a big disenchantment he doesn't consult his party because he thinks he is so popular he doesn't need to consult his party to do this radical change and so there is some arrogance in Carlos Andres V services parties if I go to my party I lose too much time he goes to the IMF to do a shock therapy with me that was that's the way it was called at that time with a country that everything that depended on the state for salt for everything you can't just jump into a free market economy without giving a transition to the people without convincing the people without doing some kind of political a menu were there to convince the people that that is necessary that people didn't think it was necessary that's the point I really think that the society was used to something and as Ghana said if you change that it's going to be painful and it's in the society is going to resist and that's that's in Caracas by 1989 the country was facing a very dire situation the government of carlos andres palace of which i was part they tried to rebalance the economy by eliminating all of these price controls exchange controls refinancing the debt and asking for international financial assistance but before any of these policies were adopted the government that had taken over on february 2nd 1989 was met with this cara castle this was a massive revolt of the Venezuelan people popular sectors poor sectors who were coming down from the Barrios it started out of the raise of petrol in the gas stations for people middle-class people were ransacking markets its spirals into this massive social explosion because in many ways that Venezuelan dream had come to an end the back to the Punto fijo was shattered because in response to the massive social protests spontaneous social protests that government econo Honduras patties his ministers his supporters supported the use of the military the deepening economic turmoil and simmering distrust of the political elite now saw Caracas ablaze with riots and looting president Peres gave orders for the military to restore order to the streets of Caracas the military's response would be deadly these words troops the head some of them you were youngsters that are 18 years old they were afraid of the people of Scilly they put them into shanty towns and they started killing it was a very brutal it was a very horrific repression of popular mobilization this was the moment of rupture with democracy in Venezuela the headline in Newsweek in the US was Latin America's model democracy explodes government figures claimed 276 civilians were killed in the military crackdown independent reports suggested the death toll was almost twice as high a red line had been crossed and a new figure was about to emerge that would challenge a failing government and changed the course of Venezuelan history the military started conspiring against the government Oh of colors under Spanish and this conspiracy is going to take place it's going to come out in the open in 1992 with the coup of February the 4th the leader of the coup was over Chavez the coup attempt was launched in six different cities across Venezuela because Chavez had failed to capture Caracas he was basically taken prisoner and during a very very famous television interview when the coup was over mm in de por ahora loss of had evoke an Oakland teemo's Chavez said we failed to achieve our goals for now por ahora and this two-word sentence really became the catchphrase of demands for political change in Venezuela the government of Paris doing these reforms had a lot of discontent when Chavez attempt a coup in February 1992 suddenly that discontent got the face that represented the disturbances that the society had Chavez is now on the political map and he in effect is seen as the the political Saviour for those completely disaffected with a diem cop a lugar Chavez a middle ranking officer in the Venezuelan army had failed to overthrow Carlos and his Paris and was sent to prison he would be released within two years he'd taken on a corrupt elite stood up for the poor and transformed himself from a man of the military to a man of the people by 1998 the man who would be king would be elected as president in December 1998 Hugo Chavez a former Army lieutenant colonel was elected as president of Venezuela in a country divided by race and class where white equaled wealth and privilege and anything else meant everything less Chavez victory was an historic turning point he was a mixed indigenous heritage he was really nothing like anything that we had ever seen before in terms of Venezuelan presidential elections or politics which had always been very much dominated by an a white elite class of politician Chavez was elected on a very simple platform saying that essentially the problem is corruption and we have to get rid of this political class Chavez was talking about the importance of a third way between socialism and capitalism it was all about participate read amok recei and what Chavez was promising to do was to completely overhaul the Punto fijo State hawala the new president created a Constituent Assembly to write a new constitution and set about his task of transforming the country Chavez Vienna see we need to eradicate this poverty in our country and the way to do it is by gaining control of our oil industry and making sure those profits are going back into our country by seeking greater control of the national oil company peda VESA Chavez was taking on Venezuela's most prized and powerful asset the fight for peda VESA spilled out onto the streets becoming symbolic of the struggle between two Venezuela's one left behind by an oil fueled modernity the other looking to keep its place and its control within it Caracas was a tinderbox of competing ideals battling for the very idea of Venezuela Venezuela was huge turmoil every day demonstrations in the streets going to miraflores the presidential palace I was in opposition rally I was moving in a hundreds of thousands toys the palace in order to ask Terrace to resign but the palace was surrounded by backers of Bubo chavez they were going to resist this rally people that were on buildings shooting we don't know who they were several civilian fell dead of both sides Chavez called the army to send the tanks into the street to stop the people and the army said sorry this is a political problem we are not sending the tax to the street to stop the people that was a cool that was really in the moment the coup happened was when his minister said I can't go out the army had been scarred by the handling of the carcass Oh unrest in 1989 but it's high rank had been conspiring with elements of the elite establishment deposed by Chavez and together they plotted his downfall we started getting reports in the fall of 2001 that you know this guy that guy the other guy are planning a coup Charles Shapiro had taken his seat as the US ambassador to Venezuela just three weeks before the coup against President Chavez a coup that was far from secret it becomes like background noise if we're hearing this everybody in Venezuela is hearing it as well the executives have been Anisa were in the queue the church was in the coup the Cardinal of Caracas was in the cool the intrapreneur the president of any communist was in the coup and so it became clear that they were planning something and the US ambassador who was in Venezuela at the time was openly collaborating with the opposition I did not the US government did not organize plan implement authorize a coup okay and if I had I'm not organized enough to have organized a coup in three weeks Chavez was forced out by this coalition of you know these opposition groups Oh allied with these dissenting military high-ranking military officers who had forcefully gone in and taken him against his will Chavez had been ousted taken into custody and flown to an offshore military base Pedro Carmona the head of the Venezuelan Chamber of Commerce but their cameras was now hastily sworn in as interim president his presidency would last only hours when this huge Pro Chavez demonstration comes and essentially drives Carmona and his government out of the presidential palace military since a helicopter to pick up Chavez Chavez gets back to the presidential palace it's something like a movie Hollywood movie comes back in a helicopter in the night and the people are waiting for him and he says within 48 hours of being overthrown Hugo Chavez was back in power eight months later his authority would be challenged once again certain Offices of the earth company seemed to have been involved in the coup but in any case Charles didn't feel strong enough to oust them from the company and what they did was that they continued to conspire to make a better cool that's really what they did so what was the better coup in oil lockout this is not a strike this was the result of an action taken by executives and by higher oil executive officials to actually lockout employees to bring production to zero to try to crash the economy in Venezuela to put the economy on its knees the National Oil Company along with the union federation and the Chamber of Commerce conspired to bring Venezuela to an economic standstill with the aim of bringing down Hugo Chavez the strike could to be a failure they were unable to stop production there's a new sense of Bavaria that comes out of the strike that paid a visa now belongs to a larger number of Venezuelans than rather the symbol of a privileged status for a small select number of individuals Lucca Chavez had held firm and now at the beginning of 2003 the president's resilience turned to resurgence so he went to Cuba and Cuba came up with a bunch of new social programs and he started to implement these new social programs massive new social programs a for healthcare for access to food and for scholarships we have a whole raft of these so-called Misiones the social programs which give people citizenship rights identity cards access to job training access to breakfast clubs university systems so this is a very comprehensive effort to deliver basic social services what this is doing though is essentially still using oil as that redemptive quality to bring social change while bringing social change deepening the dependence on oil and we can do this while the prices of oil are high he had access to finance he could borrow as if it was going out of fashion so he decided that that was the moment to radicalize the process in 2007 with the price of crude oil six times greater than when he was first elected to office Chavez embarked on a nationalization Drive he renegotiated oil contracts and brought power and resource companies as well as telecommunications groups and banks under state ownership and in his view under the will of the Venezuelan people he's trying to continue on with this grassroots governance but the more entrenched he became in power the more sort of the further away he drifted from that initial model that had been so widely accepted and you know beloved by the people oil prices began to decrease people began to say wait a minute before it's all gone I'm gonna get my piece of it when Chavez at first comes to power he had said that essentially there was going to be a you know a hard hand and iron fist against these problems of corruption which had been so overt on the pontiff II his MO but the reality was that absolutely nothing was done as the integrity of his government withered so too did the president's health Chavez was suffering with cancer and could no longer keep his ailing condition hidden from the Venezuelan people in October 2012 still failed from intensive treatment Hugo Chavez one of fourth term as president by March 2013 he was dead it's impossible to underestimate the effect that the death of Chavez had the outpouring that one saw on the streets at the same time as the celebration of some people really was exploitive of the kind of Venezuela's we had with thousands lined up to see him his body laying in state others in Miami and others in Caracas celebrating you die and the charisma dies with you he was ruling through his charisma and through his money and those two things disappear in 2013 they didn't set any money aside in a sovereign wealth fund and a rainy day fund you know so they got money in case things go down everybody in the oil industry knows oil prices are cyclical they use the period of the oil boom from 2004 to 2014 to 6 to pull the public debt the biggest sucker in Venezuelan history is the guy who's gonna follow Chavez as president and that's exactly what nicolas maduro a former bus driver and trade unionist who'd served as foreign minister was handpicked by Chavez as his successor Maduro was no Chavez his narrow election victory in April 2013 and the deepening economic crisis would herald protests from a restive population and a renewed challenge from an emboldened opposition when the doll estate viewer Christ start dropping the government wasn't she had a severe death and did not have enough dollars to buy the food imports and the medicine enforced a whole wave of protests arose in this context what we have during the first couple of years of the Maduro presidency is the opposition use of protests and street mobilization as a way of discrediting and D legitimizing the government becomes the key opposition tool the protests are sidetracked by these more violent sectors who are looking for an incident protests against crime against food shortages and against economic hardship were all ultimately protests against the Maduro government violence was met with violence clashes between protesters and state forces would leave dozens of Venezuelans dead murder has no support the only support that Maduro has is the repressive forces of the state the military the police and the paramilitary groups in parliamentary elections held in December 2015 the opposition Democratic unity roundtable that had included parties such as acción democrática and cob a secured a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly convulsed by the prospect of the opposition blocking government appointments as well as dictating policy president Maduro manipulated supreme court appointments and manufactured a ruling favorable to his objective to nullify the National Assembly that's where some of us began to see these transgressions into you know a more authoritarian type of government less democratic you know then clearly we've stepped beyond the bounds of democracy and and far beyond the participatory democracy that the Bolivarian revolution had proposed to build in the country in May 2017 amidst continuing protests against his government Maduro announced plans to hold elections for a new legislative body the Constituent Assembly would have sweeping powers to rewrite the Constitution and dissolve the opposition led National Assembly such plans would lead to three months of sustained clashes between anti-government protesters and the government's own forces this mass protest was met with massive massive repression in the end 135 people were killed 15 of them on July 30th 2017 the day when the National Constituent Assembly was elected 15,000 people were injured 6,000 people were put in prison it was a repression of a scale that the country had never seen 2017 would continue to be a year of contested elections the Constituent Assembly would be boycotted by the opposition leaving Maduro loyalists with total control the ruling Socialist Party would also win 18 of the 23 governorships in the gubernatorial elections in October contested counts and procedural irregularities dogged the elections that were claimed as proof of chavez Mo's enduring appeal by Maduro and gave cause for the opposition to call for more protests and more unrest in 2018 the year of another pivotal presidential election that will divide a fractured nation once more the battle for Venezuela goes on people need to be expressed politically or the dissatisfaction and the rejection that they are feeling and the desire that they have for a political change and I would I would say they want to demolish the democracy back and the opposition hasn't known how to put their act together to give that strategy and that political expression because that is not going to come from the government they are authoritarian and totalitarian is there any way any chance that you can have the opposition and the government have any type of talks and negotiations what is clear through our discussion is that through the decades you have had a class struggle you had a power struggle playing out this is a deeply divided society can these forces that have been opponents for so long ever coexist well currently they are negotiating and I think there's a willingness on both sides to come to an agreement because the economic crisis has been dealing I've been going on for so long and people will tend to blame him Maduro for that although i think you know the u.s. and the opposition there are a large part of the blame for the current economic crisis venezuela is in a kind of semi civil war situation right now with the opposition from the US us is putting tremendous pressure with its financial sanctions against Venezuela where it cannot refinance its debt and has having an economic impact as well as of course on the ongoing kind of well the tremendous very high inflation which I think is partly also the government's fault but the combination of these factors is going to cause a lot of people to say you know we give up we're going to vote for somebody else I think the only solution for Venezuela are negotiations for a transition to democracy meaning resignation of Maduro free and fair elections supervised by international organizations and to get a new path to democracy okay personally I think that the elections are already there I guaranteed in terms of their their security and protect protected against fraud but they could have additional controls and that could happen and then that might be a way of moving forward but it all depends again on who the opposition candidate is and if they can actually challenge the Bolivarian so to speak movement which is still very substantial in Venezuela is there any hope for coexistence between those that support the bottom full of iron revolution and those that oppose it or is it always going to be like this in Venezuela a zero-sum game for survival I think that the people that are at the top of the of the government don't have any disposition for changing their points of view and so there's no way we can go to a democratic transition but I think one could say the same thing about the stubbornness of the opposition I mean it's good they've taken also very extreme very hard line positions that make negotiation extremely difficult I think for things to free the prisoners to recognize the National Assembly to give a corona gram of the of a fair election what's the fourth and and to respect the National and to call for you mind agreement as possible but so far the the demonstrations and all of the demands on the saying as long as they maintain that position in an agreement will not happen if you ask for a resignation of our officer a public officer that's your right yes I'm not saying it's not their right I'm just saying that no agreement will be reached on that basis yeah but that is not on the table of negotiation I repeat there are four things that are on the table no negotiation there is none of that's why I said that an agreement is possible in that sense but not on the deposit just say what Rosa Diaz did you recognize a National Constituent Assembly the opposition cannot recognize a National Constituent Assembly because it completely it destroys democracy the main issue is that the government has the National Constituent Assembly with a super super constitutional power that can decide whatever it wants to decide to suppress governor's to suppress the mayors to change it you don't have any control social control on that body there is the body of the dictatorship the tool the the fists of the dictatorship I mean there's many different responses to that but I mean one of them is of course that that this was an elected body even though that the government I mean the opposition boycotted that election wasn't a democratic election you have to do democratic elections one one citizen one vote we are talking about two Venezuela's the upper-middle class in many ways thought that they owned the Venezuelan national project it was their project it was their notion of a country because in many ways it was part of their property their privileged their position and that other Venezuela was always an uncomfortable attachment that other Venezuela was always there but not part of the national narrative that Venezuela that was historically erased out of the dominant narrative in the oil years that Venezuela that exists in that Ranchos that surround Caracas and almost every other major city in Venezuela that Venezuela which includes a very diverse segment of the population and who saw their lives improved under Chavez it goes well beyond what Google Chavez is vision was for Venezuela what a lot of this has showed is that the movement wasn't strong enough to survive on its own without its leader this is a regime that rules according to the right they have to rule because they are the successes of Tomas that inherit his legacy how is it possible that a participatory democracy that's supposed to be grassroots based and a government of the people can't survive with just the people but was really led by a leader because no one could fill the shoes of who-ville Chavez we're dealing with us a very fragmented society it comes from two different lived experiences there is no going back to pre 1998 and pre Chavez Venezuela has been transformed it has changed what it will evolve to remains to be seen you
