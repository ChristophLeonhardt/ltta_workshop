1
00:00:00,756 --> 00:00:01,356
THEM ALL HOUR.

2
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:05,093
ALLISON BARBER HAS BEEN DOING

3
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:05,894
THAT AS WELL.

4
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:07,196
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

5
00:00:07,196 --> 00:00:08,263
>> WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH

6
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,531
ALL THESE AT THIS POINT.

7
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:11,934
SO FAR IT'S CLEAR THIS IS THE

8
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:13,435
MOST COMPLETE PICTURE WE HAVE

9
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:15,204
OF THIS MEETING TO DATE.

10
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:16,605
THE PRESIDENT'S SON, DONALD

11
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:17,773
TRUMP JUNIOR BEGAN HIS

12
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,875
TESTIMONY BY SAYING I DID NOT

13
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,809
COLLUDE WITH ANY FOREIGN

14
00:00:20,809 --> 00:00:23,178
GOVERNMENT AND DO NOT KNOW OF

15
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:23,879
ANYONE WHO DID.

16
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,747
HE ALSO SAID THE PRESIDENT DID

17
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:28,650
NOT KNOW ABOUT THE JUNE 2016

18
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,452
MEETING WITH A RUSSIAN LAWYER.

19
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:32,087
THE BIG ISSUE HERE IS THAT

20
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,423
MEETING AND THE SUBSEQUENT

21
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:34,990
EXPLANATIONS OF IT.

22
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,426
INITIALLY HE TOLD "THE NEW YORK

23
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:39,294
TIMES" THE MEETING WAS

24
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,362
PRIMARILY ABOUT RUSSIAN

25
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,196
ADOPTIONS NOT MENTIONING THE

26
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,464
FACT HE AGREED TO THE MEETING

27
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:43,966
AFTER BEING TOLD IN AN EMAIL

28
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,868
THE PERSON HAD INFORMATION THAT

29
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:47,736
MIGHT HURT HILLARY CLINTON'S

30
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:48,203
CAMPAIGN.

31
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:50,005
MANY CALLED TRUMP JUNIOR'S

32
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:50,772
STATEMENT MISLEADING AND THEN

33
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,908
THERE WERE REPORTS THAT

34
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:53,809
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY

35
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:54,776
DICTATED THE STATEMENT.

36
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,411
THE COMMITTEE ASKED IF THAT WAS

37
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,946
CORRECT TO WHICH TRUMP JUNIOR

38
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,681
REPLIED I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER

39
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,416
SPOKE TO MY FATHER ABOUT IT.

40
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,951
IN HIS TESTIMONY HE TOLD THE

41
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:05,287
COMMITTEE HE AGREED TO THE

42
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:07,389
MEETING AFTER A PUBLICIST NAMED

43
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:08,824
ROB GOLDSTONE TOLD HIM SOMEONE

44
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:12,261
HAD OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND

45
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:12,861
INFORMATION THAT WOULD

46
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:13,662
INCRIMINATE CLINTON, HER

47
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:14,696
DEALINGS WITH RUSSIA AND THE

48
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:15,998
INFORMATION WOULD BE USEFUL TO

49
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:17,165
THE CAMPAIGN.

50
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:18,567
HE CLAIMS HE WAS SKEPTICAL FROM

51
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:19,968
THE BEGINNING BUT FELT HE

52
00:01:19,968 --> 00:01:21,637
SHOULD LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAD

53
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:21,970
TO SAY.

54
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,272
TRUMP JUNIOR SAID HE DID NOT

55
00:01:23,272 --> 00:01:25,374
TELL HIS FATHER ABOUT THE EMAIL.

56
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:27,009
WHEN ASKED WHY WOULDN'T YOU

57
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,410
SHARE IT WITH YOUR FATHER GIVEN

58
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,746
YOUR RESPONSE THAT YOU LOVED IT

59
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,147
ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER,

60
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:34,249
TRUMP JUNIOR REPLIED BECAUSE I

61
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:39,121
WOULDN'T BRING HIM ANYTHING

62
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,055
THAT'S UNSUBSTANTIATED

63
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:42,524
ESPECIALLY FROM A GUY LIKE ROB

64
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,692
BEFORE I KNEW WHAT IT WAS

65
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,661
ACTUALLY ABOUT MYSELF.

66
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,595
>> Heather: DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR

67
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,931
NOT THE ONLY PERSON AT THIS

68
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,399
MEETING, RIGHT?

69
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,066
>> RIGHT.

70
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,768

THE FIRM BEHIND THE UNVERIFIED

TRUMP DOSSIER.
