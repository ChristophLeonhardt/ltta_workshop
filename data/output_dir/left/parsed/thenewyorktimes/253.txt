It’s hard to imagine that a sound 
could transform someone’s life,
but it happened to me.
I was 27 years old and
on one of those road
trips between your old
life and your new one.
I pulled over to get some rest.
As I lay on the ground, I
watched a storm develop.
I remember hearing
the thunder define
the far reaches of the valley
as the storm passed over me,
drenching me.
This was the first time I
experienced true listening.
I guess you could say
that was my baptism.
By holding a microphone, I
became a better listener.
I learned that a
microphone doesn’t
listen for what’s important.
It doesn’t judge.
It doesn’t interfere.
My whole life I had
been listening for what
was important rather than taking
things in with equal value.
Every place has a sound.
A passing breeze that
indicates a weather change.
The first bird songs of spring.
And the shifting tide reminding
us of the celestial ballet.
All of these experiences
connect us back to the land.
Just listen.
Silence is the poetics of space,
what it means to be in a place.
The whole topography of
the surrounding landscape
is revealed to me in the
many layers of the echo
that come towards me.
And I think to myself …
I know exactly where I am.
Silence isn’t the
absence of something,
but the presence of everything.
When I speak of
silence, I mean silence
from noise pollution
of modern life,
sounds that have nothing to do with
the natural acoustic system.
Silence is the presence
of time undisturbed.
It can be felt within the chest.
It nurtures our nature.
And silence is on the
verge of extinction.
There is not one place
left on planet Earth that
is set aside and off
limits to noise pollution,
not one square inch
of silence left
untouched by the modern world.
Our typical anti-noise
strategies offer no relief.
(MUFFLED) Earplugs,
(MORE MUFFLED)
noise canceling headphones,
(REGULAR VOLUME)
even noise abatement laws offer
no real solution, because they
do nothing to help us reconnect
and listen to the land.
And the land is speaking.
When I listen, I
have to be quiet.
I become very peaceful.
And I think what I enjoy
most about listening
is that I disappear.
I disappear.
