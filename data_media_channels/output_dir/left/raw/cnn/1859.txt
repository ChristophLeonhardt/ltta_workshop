Harvey Sara there's obviously been a
huge outpouring of support to people all

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,299
around the country for the victims of
Harvey you've seen people lining up to

tens of millions of dollars

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,809

million dollars of personal money to the

been doing a lot of reporting into the

groups and organizations that have best
and most effective in helping and

suggestions from the folks here and I'd
