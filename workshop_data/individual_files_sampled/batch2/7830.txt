two police officers in Chicago have been officially reprimanded after a photo featuring them went viral online now in the photo they are shown kneeling in solidarity with NFL players who also kneeled during the national anthem and this whole story came about when an activist approached them and asked if they supported people like Colin Kaepernick so the officers were approached by an activist named Arleta Clark who asked the two officers whether they were opposed to police brutality and racism they responded in the affirmative knelt down in solidarity with Clark Kaepernick and the broader message so that was what you saw in that photo was posted on Instagram went viral and for the most part got a lot of support but after enough people saw it of course there gonna be some who are opposed to it and the police department was notified of the image and they released a statement indicating that these police officers would be reprimanded now I also want to be clear that the department does have a pretty strict policy when it comes to partisan political speech while on duty they are obviously in uniform and they made a political statement and so that's the reason that the department is giving four reprimanding them department members are prohibited from participating in any partisan political campaign or activity while on duty including but not limited to distributing campaign literature or wearing or displaying political paraphernalia the official statement from the department is as follows we are aware of the photo and we will address it in the same way we have handled previous incidents in which officers have made political statements while in uniform with a reprimand and a reminder of department policies okay so I'm a little split on this I mean I get it they have a policy yeah now and at the end of the day it's a reprimand and a reminder of department policies yeah they live some people aren't mistaking that as these officers getting fired they're not getting fired okay now on the other hand they're not really doing political paraphernalia it's not like they're saying vote for Bob or Susie or Lucan or democrat it easily could have been interpreted as not a political statement and then think about what the statement is it's against police brutality and their police I hope that all the cops agree that they're against police brutality so if that's against your guidelines to be in favor of to be against police brutality oh that I'm a little worried about your guidelines it's super easy to say that's not a political statement of course we're all against police brutality yes look I I hate zero-tolerance policies I think that you know once you put out a zero-tolerance policy in regard to political speech and you know you're talking about public officials putting forth a policy that squashes political speech I mean I don't know if you can have a debate about whether or not this is protected by the First Amendment I get the idea though that hey we need to have a policy in place because we might have some police officers who say things that lead to the community further distrusting them right and so we've had a number of stories where police have said things that were horrible toward the black community or those who have been protesting and that unfortunately not unfortunately understandably leads to the community not trusting them however like in this case I feel like this is something that should be protected right it seems like the only time cops get reprimanded or face a punishment is when they criticize other cops or call out other cops and I think right now more than ever we need the good cops to come forward and be like you know what no we're not gonna stand for this all of these you know murders against people who are unarmed we're not gonna stand for this we got it we got to change the policing we got to change the training that's what we've been asking for and now finally we have these two cops who made a mild statement by kneeling in a photo and you know they get reprimanded so look I totally agree with the policy overall I don't want a cop showing up at a maggot at me I also don't want a cop showing up with I'm with her a sticker okay or even a burny so punk t-shirt which you could get at shop TYT calm but because what if you know some people are made uncomfortable they work with her or you know it's a very wealthy purses house and they wrongly are made uncomfortable by Bernie Sanders and they are not sure the cop is on their side we can't have it I totally agree that you should leave politics out of it but Kaepernick taking a knee and doing you know raising their fists and all the players now doing it and even some NFL owners doing it are not saying we're against cops they're not saying we're against any race certainly right they're saying we want to make sure that everybody is treated equally and that and that we don't have police brutality especially if you're the police you got to agree with that message right and so and the last thing is a lot of people have a wrong impression of cops so they think for example were gas cops that's crazy we talked about it a million times you want better training for cops because there are cops and then we want them to protect the community all the community and we want to train better to do that so they don't shoot us quickly etc right and and then some on the right thing oh the cops don't like you guys I'm sure that's true for some of the cops but that's actually not at all true for a lot of the cops I know from my personal life I mean cops are shouting out at me all the time but not in that way no so and they'll be like hey Young Turks hey I watched your show hey keep going yeah DC in New York in LA in DC when I got arrested for civil disobedience to get money out of politics as I was going to do the paperwork one of the council's like Young Turks keep it going okay yeah now I don't want to go to somebody else's house because that would be political right but so not all cops are alike that's ridiculous way of thinking on either side right great I love to see them doing this saying we're gas police brutality I wish the department was a little bit more understanding of it yeah absolutely and and just one comment in regard to cops liking us or not liking us I it's not our job to care about cops liking us right it's our job to do the best can with these stories and and be honest with you guys and give you the facts but I have a tremendous amount of respect for the cops that you know watch the show see some of the criticisms that we've had in regard to police training and they've been you know receptive to it and understanding so much love to them helped us build the independent media together come join us TYT Network comm /join
