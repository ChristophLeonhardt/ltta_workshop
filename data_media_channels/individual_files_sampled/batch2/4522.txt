and thanks to at home for joining us this hour happy Monday in Watergate it's still not totally clear looking back why the Nixon White House didn't just destroy all the Oval Office tapes I mean they knew what was on him right why didn't they just barbecue him frankly looking back it's still not clear why they made those tapes in the first place but they made them and by the time the special prosecutor was closing in in Watergate Nixon and his White House knew that if those tapes ever became public that would be the end so they fought to keep the tapes secret the existence of the tape secret then once the public knew that they existed they fought for the right to keep them private and never released them ultimately the Nixon White House came up with a ridiculous offer that would make it look like they were releasing the tapes without them ever hack should ever have actually having to do so we've talked about this on the show before it was called the Stennis compromise to avoid releasing the tapes Nixon offered the special prosecutor and Watergate a deal the White House would not hand over the tapes but they would listen to the tapes themselves type up written summaries of what they said was on the tapes and then they would cross your heart pinky swear that those summaries were absolutely accurate there was nothing else damning on the tapes at all and just in case you were some sort of cold-hearted cynical jerk and you wouldn't take President Nixon's word for it that those written summaries were an accurate description of what was on the tapes well for you cynics there would also be a verification process a pro Nixon Dixiecrat senator named Senator John Stennis would personally individually listen to the tapes he'd compare the tapes with the written summaries that had been drawn up by the Nixon White House and senator Stennis would personally sign off attributing right he would listen up you could you could he could use his own integrity to tell whether those written summaries were accurate he would attest to their accuracy and that was an absolutely ridiculous offer from the Nixon White House right not only was it a rule rude Goldberg contraption right of the tapes being made and tapes being played and then transcribed and then summarized and then listened to again and then verified and signed off on by this other dude and that but in addition to all of that Senator John Stennis the key validator for this whole process he was famously deaf so he was not going to be able to validate the auditory accuracy of any of those tapes so the Stennis compromise was offered the special prosecutor said ya know and Nixon responded by firing the special prosecutor that was the Saturday night Massacre I couldn't fire the special prosecutor directly so he ordered his Attorney General to fire the prosecutor Attorney General said no so he fired his attorney general then he gave the same order to the Deputy Attorney General who said no he fired the Deputy Attorney General ultimately it was the Solicitor General Robert Bork who said yeah okay I will fire the special prosecutor now as ridiculous as it is in hindsight Nixon apparently really believed his own sales pitch he really believed that this Stennis compromise was such a reasonable generous offer from him that the country would absolutely be on his side in this standoff look what I've offered how can they say no to that that is not out the country received it instead the the Saturday night massacre got the whole country up in arms the whole thing really just blew up both sides of the aisle ultimately a new special prosecutor was appointed and that was all she wrote for the Nixon administration new special prosecutor maintained the insistence on getting the actual tapes the courts agreed Nixon had to hand him over and that was the end in the Washington Post tonight reporter Carroll lenok has a scoop at president Trump's lawyers and the Russia investigation have just sent over to Special Counsel Robert Muller's office some written summaries of their own quote president Trump's attorneys have provided the special counsels office with written descriptions that Chronicle key moments under investigation by the special counsel both the written materials provided to Moeller's office includes summaries of internal White House memos and contemporaneous correspondence about events Muller is investigating including the ouster of national security adviser Mike FBI director James Comey quote the records do not include Trump's personal version of events but they provide a narrative of the White House view Trump's lawyers hope this evidence eliminates the need to ask the president about some of these episodes raise your hand if you think this is gonna make this whole problem for the White House go away raise your hand if you think Robert Muller and his prosecutors will not just be delighted they'll be absolutely satisfied to receive written narrative vignettes from the White House Russia lawyers providing their perspective on these matters that are under investigation I mean give him credit how many other options do they have the reason the president's lawyers are trying to do this is obvious to the point of being emphatic as Carol lennick puts it in her scoop tonight at the post quote Trump's legal team shared the documents in an effort to limit any session between the president and the special counsel the decision to share materials with Muller's team as part of an effort by trumps lawyers to minimize his exposure to the special counsel this latest gambit to write some stuff up for the special special counsels prosecutors is quote in hopes of curtailing the scope of a presidential interview I bet the president's lawyers are clearly paddling as fast as they can here but they're only gonna be able to steer this thing for so long you will recall that the president's lawyers previously assured him that the Moller investigation would be wrapped up by Thanksgiving as in Thanksgiving last year when we rolled straight through Thanksgiving and that wasn't true they apparently told him it would definitely be done by Christmas then they told him what we did be done by the new year when that didn't happen either January 8th is when the president's lawyers first floated the idea that instead of the president answering questions from a special counsel Muller instead the president would just sign an affidavit affirming that he is innocent of all charges see the legal force of that would be that he would sign it he'd put his name on it so therefore that's all you need right that's an assurance of innocence president's lawyer suggested this sworn from the president asserting his innocence should be enough to satisfy the special counsel if that wouldn't be satisfying enough they also suggested well how about the special counsel could submit questions in writing and then the president's lawyers could write up some answers and send those back that unsurprisingly also did not make the special counsel go away just a week and a half ago they came up with yet another gambit they offered to have the president do a very limited interview with Miller's team where he wouldn't have to answer any detailed questions at all he could just speak to any general questions they might have okay and in exchange for that generous offer from the president's lawyers the special counsel would agree for his part that he would give up the whole thing in 60 days he'd end the whole investigation within 60 days so that gambit week and a half ago that apparently did not go anywhere either so now tonight the president's lawyers have apparently tried this written vignette gambit we'll see how that goes it does seem like they're sort of running out of options and ridiculous compromises to offer one House adviser concedes to Carol lennick tonight at the Washington Post that the Trump lawyers believe they are moving into crunch time on the Moller investigation last week the New York Times reported that the Trump Organization president Trump's business has received a subpoena from the Malheur investigation president himself has already betrayed two reporters that he would well that this is a sensitive subject for him he had previously said to The Times that any investigation into his business and his business finances is something he would see as a violation by the special counsel we also now know that Muller's investigators have sent to the president's Russia lawyers the first round of topics and questions they intend to discuss with the president in his interview and you know maybe the president's lawyers are right and molars prosecutors will be fully satisfied with just getting written descriptions of events from the perspective of White House lawyers in response to those queries but that would be a surprise if they were okay with that last week the New York Times was also first to report that a new lawyer would be joining the president's roster in the Russia scandal at this late date The Times reported that veteran Washington lawyer Amit T flood was in discussions to join the president's team the president himself vehemently denied that report saying not just that he wasn't hiring Emmett T flood but that he wasn't hiring anybody president said quote the failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I'm unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and I'm gonna add another lawyer to help out wrong I am very happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow they're doing a great job filling New York Times wrong to report that I want a new lawyer for my Russia team today the White House confirmed that in fact the president is adding a new lawyer to his Russian team we're gonna actually have a little more on him coming up later on in the show tonight so this does sort of feel like like crunch time at least it feels like a lot of cages are being rattled all at once I mean the president last week fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and coincidentally or not that firing came Tuesday morning just hours after Tillerson made his first-ever sharply critical comments about Russia the White House has pushed a false timeline of tiller since firing to make it appear that he was fired some time before his Russia comments going so far as to also fire the number four official at the State Department who put out an accurate statement about when in fact Tillerson was fired which was hours after his Russia remarks CNN also reports that embassies around the world and other State Department officials were ordered explicitly to not retweet or acknowledge that true statement about when exactly Tillerson was fired so something's rattled them they're then late on Friday night just as just after I got off the air like thirty seconds after I got off the air the Deputy Director of the FBI was fired Andrew McCabe now if there was any doubt as to whether that firing was related to the Russia scandal the president's lawyer John Dowd cleared that up the following morning Saturday morning when he released a statement to the Daily Beast saying that Deputy Attorney General rod Rosenstein should follow the example set by the McCabe firing and he and he should quote bring an and to the alleged Russia collusion investigation so McCabe's own statement about his firing on Friday night certainly contended that this is related to Russia he contends in this lengthy statement that he issued Friday night that his ouster is an effort to discredit him as a witness to the firing of FBI director James Comey which all sides agree is one of the key areas of focus and investigation by the millers team so I mean it does sort of feel like we're in crunch time it feels like the White House is rattled and it feels like they're taking increasingly erratic action and now in the midst of all that the president's lawyers and Moeller's lawyers going head to head the firings and at least one of those cases a false cover story about the firing being advanced by the White House this hard turn by the president and his lead Russia lawyer this weekend to start attacking robert muller and the special counsels office directly in in the cacophony of this crunch time now today there is a new thing that is going crunch what we want to know is what is the expertise of the deep thinking that you can do to make sure that the people know the true identity and secrets of these people is interesting the effective can be just together speak to the incumbents and on the Facebook or YouTube or something like for example you're saying when you are using the girls to introduce to the minute to the local fellow and you're using the girls yes we are very beautiful Ukrainian girls they are very beautiful I find that Ukrainian girls trick works works very very well the the English gentleman was on the right side of your screen for most of that tape explaining that that tactic is the CEO of Cambridge analytic a Cambridge analytic is famous for being the data firm for the Trump campaign they're basically a British firm that opened up a US shell company with money from Republican mega donor Robert Mercer one of the easiest things to forget about the presidential election cycle is who was affiliated with who before Trump started winning everything in this past presidential election cycle Robert Mercer and his web of companies and and donations they didn't initially support Trump he initially supported Ted Cruz in the primary that's why they're those funny clips you can still get on YouTube of Kellyanne Conway criticizing Donald Trump in the 2016 election race that's because Kellyanne Conway was associated with the Mercer family and their web of entities and donations and they initially were not for Trump they were for Ted Cruz when it became clear though that Ted Cruz was going to lose to Donald Trump the whole Mercer operation switched allegiance this happened around the time when it came time for Paul Manafort to fade back into the background because of his shady seeming relationships with pro-russian oligarchs and political factions in the former Soviet Union at that time you know Ted Cruz took his fight all the way to the convention but then Trump was triumphant Manta Ford gets out stood a Mercer stepped into the Trump campaign they installed Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon at the top of the Trump campaign they also brought onboard Cambridge analytical which the Mercer's funded which Steve Bannon helped found and where he served as vice president it's interesting though just a few months before all that happened in December 2015 the Guardian newspaper in Britain had reported that Cambridge analytic has worked for the Ted Cruz campaign appeared to have something sort of rotten at the center of it Cambridge analytic Oh was supporting Ted Cruz and they appeared to be using millions of Facebook profiles that had effectively been stolen off of Facebook without the users consent it was a sort of minor slightly arcane campaign controversy at the time face apparently wasn't too bothered by that reporting or its implications they took quite a few months until late 2016 before they apparently even bothered anybody about it a new whistleblower who was the former research director at Cambridge analytic ah he's now come forward to the New York Times to the Guardian and Observer newspapers in Britain and of Britain's channel for saying that he was contacted in August 2016 August 2016 so right before the 2016 election contacted August 2016 by Facebook and they sent him a notification telling him that he and Cambridge analytic I needed to delete all that data he and other Cambridge analytical sources now say that Cambridge analytic uh didn't delete that data and it didn't much matter because Facebook never checked to see if they did what Cambridge analytic it does is works works on creating a web of disinformation online so that people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs websites etc that make them think that certain things are happening that may not be Cambridge analytic I was meeting with Corey Lewandowski in 2015 before Trump had even announced and offering the services that that I'm talking about right now Cambridge analytic Oh was founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users and I want to bring attention to that so that people understand that their data is being used improperly by this company that has also been you know in in talks with Russian oil companies that that was using a psychologist who is going back and forth between London and Russia who is also working on projects that were funded by Russian funds in Russia on profiling people and their personalities so I think it's really important for Americans to know what this company is being doing with their data and it's really important I think to find out was this data used to help elect Donald Trump that's the former research director at Cambridge analytic his name is Chris Wiley speaking on the Today show this morning he made a reference there to a Russian oil company that's about this company Lukoil they're the second largest oil company in Russia they have turned up in the past in Russian influence operations overseas one famous example is in the Czech Republic with a pro-russian president in the Czech Republic a key adviser to that pro-russian president found himself in financial trouble because of a legal matter and this random Russian oil company Lukoil stepped in to rescue him basically to pay his legal fees though Lukoil is a private company but has been deployed as an instrument of the Kremlin and they are sanctioned by US law because of it one of the things that Cambridge analytic is form a research director Christopher Wylie is saying and providing documentation of now is that he says in 2014 and 2015 Cambridge analytic Ahmet with executives from lukoil specifically to give them detailed briefings on how data was used to target American voters quote Christopher Wiley who helped found Cambridge analytic and developed the company's voter profiling technology said Luke well showed interest in how the company used data to target their messaging to American voters quote I remember being super confused at mr. Wiley who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings I kept asking alexander nicks the head of c8 Cambridge analytic I can you explain to me what they want I don't understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America we're sending them stuff about political targeting they come and asked more about political targeting as to the way that Cambridge analytic 'got access to their core data to the personal and private data of at least 50 million Facebook users which is what this whistleblower says their whole political operation was based on well according to the Guardian observer they have obtained that information by partnering with a professor at Cambridge University in England he was able to obtain that kind of data from Facebook supposedly for academic purposes but he then apparently made a business deal with Cambridge analytic where he handed it on to them for them to use it in their business according to the Guardian quote while that professor was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at st. Petersburg State University in Russia taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media online posts showed professor Cogan lecturing in Russian one talk was called new methods of communication as an effective political instrument so Cambridge analytic does presentations in 2014 2015 for a Russian oil company that has been known to do political work for the Kremlin around the world they give that oil company information about how to target and influence American voters and how that works why does a Russian oil company need that kind of information we then learned that Cambridge analytic obtains the core data that was the basis of their business in all their political work from a Russian researcher who was working at Cambridge but it's also simultaneously doing work for the Russian government we know from separate reporting that during the campaign while the Trump campaign was paying Cambridge analytic on nearly 6 million dollars for its certain Data Services Cambridge analytic I was in touch with WikiLeaks WikiLeaks was busy distributing emails that had been stolen by Russian government hackers to try to inflict maximum political harm on Hillary Clinton Cambridge analytic a contacted them to see if they could basically help out with that well now a whistleblower who's deeply involved in the data operations of that company has come forward and handed over to Britain's National Crime Agency cybercrime unit a dossier of emails invoices contracts and bank transfers from his time at the company he says he's basically driven by guilt the British prime minister says she supports an investigation into the company the Information Commissioner in the UK which is sort of the prosecutor on privacy issues says she is now seeking a warrant to get their databases and their servers the European Union also says they are interested in starting an investigation here at least one state attorney general Democrat Maura Healey in Massachusetts says she is she too is potentially looking at this as a criminal matter here in the United States the president and his legal team have thus far come up with one legal argument to prove that there was no conspiracy or collaboration between the Russian effort to help elect Donald Trump and Donald Trump's campaign effort trying to do the same thing so far their legal argument is them saying in all capital letters with exclamation points on the end no collusion no collusion no collusion and I know it feels like everything is sort of happening all at once but we're about to find out if that complex legal argument from them has met its match crunch time indeed senator Amy Klobuchar joins us next day with us hey they're armed cruisers from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
