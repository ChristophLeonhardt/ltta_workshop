so jimmy kimmel threatened to beat a guy up last night which is leftism in a nutshell first they get all teary-eyed and emotional then they Hector you and if that doesn't work they resort to violence we'll talk about why it always works that way also dr. Helen Smith will be here to talk about modern sex and what it's doing to us and the stuff I like great directors who started with terrific small crime films but first I thought this would be a good day to cover some of the stupid news stories you might have missed because you have a life and don't want to sit around reading stupid news stories first of all there was sports radio host Clay Travis who shocked CNN anchorwoman Brooke Baldwin by saying on-air that the two things he believed in completely were the First Amendment and boobs CNN journalists were united in condemning Travis's remark saying that it was crude and disgusting to publicly praise the First Amendment which apparently allows conservatives to just go around saying whatever they want which CNN believes should be illegal personally when I heard what Travis said that he said he loved boobs I thought he was referring to all CNN journalists though Brooke Baldwin does have a pretty nice rack then there's the story of the process March Washington by Juggalos and juggle let's now you may ask what our Juggalos and juggle let's or more likely you don't care but I'll explain anyway Juggalos and juggle let's are the guys and girl fans of a hip hop band called insane clown posse insane clown posse or two men who call themselves violent Jay and Shaggy 2 dope so you know they're terrific they sing hip hop songs with lyrics like the one about a guy who went to prison and his girlfriend slept around and thus gave him genital warts and now he's going to blow her kneecaps off and then strangle her to death so you know they're terrific anyway the Obama administration what may be the only useful thing they ever did classified these fans as a street gang and the Juggalos and juggle let's wanted that designation revoked so there was a Juggalo juggle at protest march on washington DC and you still don't care finally all of us were charmed by a hard-working 11 year old boy named Frank who offered to mow the why House lawn and got his chance if that wasn't cool enough as Frank was mowing the president of the United States came out to greet him but the kid was so intent on doing a good job he didn't even take notice Frank says he wants to grow up to be a Navy SEAL I think it's safe to say that just about everyone in America loves this little guy except Steven greenhouse who used to work for the New York Times the former labor reporter for the former newspaper tweeted that President Trump was sending a bad signal on child labor minimum wage and occupational safety by letting the boy mow the lawn fortunately since green house did used to work for The Times he doesn't know what he's talking about labor laws do allow children to do chore like jobs like mowing lawns but even if they didn't green house would still be a knucklehead who ought to stuff a sock in his mouth to protect himself from his own stupidity but then without stupidity the New York Times would just be a bunch of blank pages and that's the stupid news trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show also sings it easy it's a wonderful stop the hammering stop the hammering out there who's got a hammer where is it where's the hammer is it on the go up on the other floor so I'm gonna go up there and stop the hammering lawrence o'donnell on MSNBC is an eight-minute video of him just going on guy you know he needs to relax i think what he needs is some single nostril breathing like you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and then you exhale through the other and you keep going you know i want to be fair to lawrence O'Donnell though this does happen to people right i mean we we all try to be decent in everything but the other day michael knowles did a segment he got a few minor things wrong and and i actually went off on him and we caught that on video yeah so here's the video just to be fair to lawrence O'Donnell is me going off on Michael Knowles I want you to get this where he brings I want you to find this fancy boy I want him dead I want his family dead I want his house burnt to the ground I want to go to middle not a no loss took it well I think he needs some single nostril breathing Kitty but you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and the other and you keep going yeah dr.

/ Clavin right now so Jimmy Kimmel first-first Kimmel goes on and he talks about his son who has this his baby son had to have open-heart surgery and he cries and it's very moving but he uses this event to sell Obamacare right we need Obamacare because I'm not sure what the logic was there oh because some people don't have insurance not everybody's making thirty five million dollars a year like Jimmy Kimmel is so he cries and it's like oh now we need Obamacare because he's crying I you know and and by the way obviously we all hope and pray that Jimmy Kimmel son is all right been Shapiro's daughter I think it was at the exact same operation with the exact same doctor ben shapiro is not for obamacare bench bureau would like so it's actually your emotions don't actually mean anything you know even though you have emotions even though we have tragedies in our lives that doesn't make us specialists in what kind of health care is best for America so when that didn't work in these Republicans are still trying to repeal or they're not going to repeal that they're going to change Obamacare move some of the funding to the states which hopefully would let the laboratory of federalism do good work and change the way this collapsing law will be administrated so then he goes on he starts hectoring you played that yesterday instead of doing his monologue he's just sitting there screaming at people about the republicans you know it's just like that that's what we want after a long day's we want to see a late-night comedian come on and scream at us about you know what he thinks is the health care should be so now brian kilmeade the guy on Fox and Friends comes out and says fairly mildly you know he says this is the Hollywood elite they're always pushing this thing you know the Hollywood elite always want even though they're not watching the Emmy here is Jimmy Kimmel's response to Brian Kilmeade and the reason I found this comment to be particularly annoying it's because this is a guy Brian Kilmeade who whenever I see him kisses my it's like a little boy meeting Batman he follows me on Twitter he asked me to write a blurb for his book which I did he calls my agent looking for projects he's dying to be a member of the Hollywood elite the only reason he's not a member of the Hollywood elites because nobody will hire him to be one and you know the reason I'm talking about this because my son had an open heart surgery and has to have two more and because of that I learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation I don't get anything out of this Brian you phony little creep oh wow how do you when I see stop that's Kimmel going off shame I'll pound you when I see you and the audience is applauding for this that she's threatening this guy basically for criticizing him and the audience is applauding yeah pound this guy he said something he disagreed with you you know you gotta pound this guy so just before I get on to this I want to let Brian Kilmeade respond because he responded to all those charges on his show have we got kill me hope your son gets better I hope your son gets all the care he needs I'm glad you're interested you cause on the day you're doing a great job bringing the dialogue out but you should actually do what we're doing talk to the people that wrote it yeah it's senator Graham senator Cassidy asking tough questions to to Michael and we'll see where we go from here about me and you personally yeah I did this thing called request in the interview for an up-and-coming talk-show host disease a great job on Fox warts and even when you weren't getting great ratings I taught you and the show was excellent when I was at American Idol across the street at the finale I walked over at least two years maybe three years and you were kind enough to give an interview to me I thought the pieces went great I didn't kiss your butt I thought you did a good job and I thought I'd highlight behind the scenes are not becoming talk show as you trying me trying to get you to blurb the book a little mistaken I actually tried to get you in this book in 2003 it's how you play the game the games do count two books back to back I wanted to focus on people in sports and how it helped him later on in life so so there's Kilmeade answering this but the thing is no matter what he said it wasn't like hate speech it wasn't like you know it wasn't like he was screaming at Jimmy Kimmel said you know this guy is a Hollywood elite he's pushing this thing on us and Kimmel responds with basically a threat of violence I'm not saying it's an actual real threat of violence but it's pretty real I'm gonna pound this guy and the audience applause I just want to point out obviously Jimmy Kimmel is not the biggest story in the world but this is the left in a nutshell this is the pattern of the left first they come out with their sob story and there are sob stories in the world there are real sob stories but the answer to every sob story is not more government the answer to every sob story is not we get to take this segment of your life over and we now get to control your life because when the government takes over health care as you see everywhere it has been done they get to control your healthcare they get to say well you did this so we don't have to get you're too old for health care they get death panels basically they get to say you are not going to we're not gonna give you any more health care because the state can't afford it so they they have that power everything they give you comes at a price so they start with the emotionalism when people don't buy into the emotionalism when that doesn't stop the train excuse me they start to heck to you you know it's like what's Riley you know you're a climate denier you're this denier or that you're a racist you're this and when that doesn't work they threaten you with violence and this is you know this is like antiphon when they can't silence I'm sorry I'm joking today it's the hammering it's all the hammering as well yeah yeah guy needs to calm down I think he needs a little single nostril breathing but you know you do hold and you breathe through one and you hold it and then you exhale through the other and you keep going never mind you know it's like anti-fog when they can't stop people when they fight after they stay first they start with oh the poor this oh the poor minorities oh the poor women over the poor this and when people say yeah but you know really they have to take care of themselves just like everybody else then they start to Hector you you know you're a racist you're a sex you're this you're that when that doesn't work auntie Fah turns up and beats you up when people like ben shapiro still turn up on campus and make their speeches aunty Fay shows up there was a poll recently 51% of students of college students agree that it's alright to shout down speakers 20% say it's okay to commit violence in response to words and 44% say hate speech isn't protected by the First Amendment I mean they actually don't know what they're talking about so they're right not just angry and violent they're actually ignorant so why is it like this it's like this because the things they do don't work and the things they do strip the power of the people they're unconstitutional almost always there's nothing in the Constitution that gives the government the right to take over our health care that take over our insurance market like this you know the insurance market bought into this because basically they said we're gonna force people to buy your product and so it'll be great but of course it's not great because they cover pre-existing conditions this is the whole problem with Kimmel's argument by the way is that the reason people don't have health insurance is they don't get health insurance when they're healthy when you have a when your wife is pregnant you insure the baby you know you shouldn't go into Parenthood without being insured for catastrophic illnesses so you know Obama has destroyed the insurance market he's taken it over this is what fact you know there's fascism is communism is where the state runs everything fascism is where they let the company run things but they tell it what to do and so when things go wrong the company gets the blame but that company really has no freedom and that's why people are pulling out of this all over the place so when people will not allow their fantasy to continue they get violent that is the way this works so I mean we're seeing everything everything the left tells us everything they sell us turns out to be untrue so remember when Trump said that he had been wiretapped in Trump Tower and there's oh he was lying he actually had on CNN they had like Chiron's Trump lies you know Trump lies they had James clapper former Director of National Intelligence right so let's just go back in time for a minute James clapper sits in front of I believe it was the Senate committee and he lies about NSA gathering so this is clapper in 2013 okay which number it is it's number 6 in 2013 and here he is lying in front of the Senate yes so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans no sir it does not not wittingly there are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not not wittingly okay so now we know this is untrue right we know there's this huge program where they were collecting all this information all this data so now in March he's on Meet the Press and they ask him whether it's possible that they ask him whether there were any FISA taps on Trump and what is it possible Trump is telling the truth so this has got five obviously I'm not I can't speak officially anymore but I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president the president-elect at the time or as a candidate or against his campaign I can't speak for other title three authorized entities in the government or a state or local and say if the FBI for instance had it fights a court order of some sort first surveillance would that be information you would know or not now yes you would be told that I would know that if there was a FISA Court on something like this something like this absolutely and at this point you can't confirm or deny whether that exists or I can deny it okay so now that guy we know we already know he lies right now he denies this thing and now CNN comes out with an exclusive report saying that there was in fact an FBI FISA wiretap on Paul Manafort who was four briefly Trump's campaign manager who lives in Trump Tower who undoubtedly spoke with Trump and and there are it's not it's not just him I mean they were wire time they tapped Trump advisers Carter Page Michael Flynn and all these guys are now Don Lemon has clapper on and says you want to you know confirm what you said and clapper keeps saying I confirm it but he really doesn't here he is is it possible the president was picked up in a conversation with Paul Manafort it's it's certainly conceivable yeah is that likely I can't say I wouldn't want to go there but I will say it it's it's it's possible I mean the left is living in a fantasy world and every time something breaks through it that's when they get violent now there's a report to Samantha power the former US ambassador to the United Nations was am asking people you know when they would tap they would tap your phone and you would get caught up in this conversation or American would get caught up in a conversation that was being legally tapped you're not supposed to unmask that Samantha power the former she was the US ambassador to the United Nations he had no reason to unmask anybody she was unmasking is such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 these guys were running a game on the Trump campaign they were that government of the United States was running again on a candidate for president we're gonna talk come back and talk about this if we have time but dr. Helen Smith is with us we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube if only if only you would subscribed if only you would scribe ahead subscribe you could see the whole thing on The Daily wire calm now you can listen to it if you subscribe for a year you get the leftist tears tumblr come on over to the daily wire and here at dr. Helen Smith okay dr. Ellen Smith is a psychologist specializing in forensic issues in Knoxville Tennessee she has authored more importantly uh more importantly to me of men on strike why men are boycotting marriage fatherhood and the American dream and why it matters she is my colleague at PJ Media you can find her at PJ media.com slash dr. Helen all together dr. Helen hi Helen how you doing it it's great to see you it's been a while since we've talked I think the last time it was out the beach somewhere I always good to talk to you about the best thing you know so I'm gonna I want to talk about men on strike but I want to talk first about a study that I saw and the way it was reported to I think this was in The Washington Post it said a new study shows the teenagers and this is the way they put it are increasingly delaying activities that had long been seen as rites of passage into adulthood the study in journal child development found that the percentage of adolescents in the United States who have a driver's license who have tried alcohol who date and who worked for pay has plummeted since 1976 but basically it says that they're not having as much sex and they're not drinking as much so this the headline could have been teenagers are getting more wholesome it could have been a good news story but they so which is it I mean do you think that teenagers are or or males teenagers especially are absconded on adulthood or are they just getting wise I mean I think it's both girls and boys but I think that there are several reasons for that I think that we are delaying childhood so much more I think parents now they have fewer children we had what one two three children on average 2.3 so I think parents put more and more effort into kids and I think because of that over I think kids are very much over protected now we have a lot of helicopter parents and I'm not blaming parents I don't think it's their fault I think part of it is that we have so much supervision at schools and places for kids kids don't get outside and play anymore I just don't think they're exposed to a lot of things that we were exposed to when we understood more about world they did these studies I mean I remember these studies have been going on for like 10 15 20 years where they've been saying the kids are getting younger and younger you see kids were 18 they're saying they're more like 15 year olds I think there are two different things going on I think one thing is that you know kids should be doing some things like driving or getting jobs and things like that and they're not and I think that's a concern that sexual can sort of be alcohol those are those are not really concerns they're more I mean what's going on so I think it depends I mean shoot kids 15 to 18 have sex you know it depends what you're feeling about that Dex I mean is that a good thing or a bad thing it depends on the person I you know I grew up in such as I grew up in the 60s it was such a hyper sexualized time that it took me a long time to say to myself you know what I'm not really enjoying this oh I actually want to be with somebody in a van and like the people that I'm with instead of just doing stuff you know and I think that was that that was a very healthy thing but it was such an unhealthy time it was such a revolutionary time there was hard for me to catch up with it I think you know I mean I think this is the thing is old people always think young people are just going wild they always think young people are having sex but you kind of you're kind of saying that men are withdrawing a little bit from the sexual game and you think that's still true I don't know so much but I think that there are so many other avenues for men and I think part of the problem is that we're always seeing things like there was one book and one that you mentioned about you know is cheap sexy Ozzie meant not to get married and I had written a post about that and a lot of my readers really educated me and helped me to understand what's going on and a lot of them to me say you know what it's not that marriage is cheap I think that the reality is that we we treat men treat cheaply in our society we treat men in ways that make them not want to be married we treat them as disposable objects who are there for the availability of women now and I think men used to in the old days get something out of marriage there was a kind of a bargain hey you're gonna do some things for me and I'm gonna do them for you but now it's like women want the Society tells women you should have it all you're the one that gets to go to work but if you want to you could stay home and have kids but a man doesn't really have a choice and I think young men today really see they see their fathers or uncle older brothers and they see that the contract for them isn't working out as well but the marriage contract for them anytime there's a problem it's always the man's fault and I think in older times it we didn't blame them and I think our society as a whole is blaming men for every evil and every problem that we have in society so I think that does get men withdrawing a little bit more and finding porn the internet and other avenues a little bit better it's not that it's cheaper is this that their lives are cheapened by the fact that we don't actively give me in those things in marriage that they would need in order to think it's a good deal does that make sense yes I mean it makes sense but the guy who writes the book cheap sex is actually saying that now sex is a buyers market I mean that the cliche is that what men want well let me ask you this I mean the cliche is that what men want out of life is sex sex sex that they want lots of partners they want to be sex I want to get you know get it wherever they can and all this stuff do men want to do men want to be in a marriage I mean do they want a bond like that I think men really do want that bond but the they've looked at the Pew Research study did a study and they found out that it used to be that almost 40% of men thought marriage was the most important thing in their life and now it's down to 29% Wow women it's going up and the reason it's dropping I think it's just that it's marriage I think men still want relationships and then tell me that men still very much believe that that's an important thing for them but I think it's very hard to find in our society first of all to find a woman I know that you and other people have found really good partners but there are many men out there who we the women today are told you know it's not a good thing to be a wife and a mother they're told to delay those things and they're also told that men are supposed to provide them with with everything they're supposed to provide the money they're supposed to provide just help him with the children and I think for men the expectations are so high that it's very difficult to make that leap into getting married also if things go wrong remember the man is going to be the one that's gonna get the full brunt of it a woman legally I'm not saying on a personal level yeah but I think that makes it very hard for men to want to take that job to get married because they know that they're gonna be held more responsible more so than a woman would be you know one of the reasons I always want to find out about this is because every story I read is about the proliferation of cheap sax and you know college kids are having these weekends where this is all they do every single person I know is lonely and not getting out my you know and and miserable basically you know I mean that they they yearn for companionship they do and I think because our society is so externally oriented now we have everything we've gone to all this technology where everybody and I'm not saying it's the phones but everybody looks at technology they look at the Internet and I think that over the years our communities everybody moves around and we don't know each other as well so nobody really knows and because there's so much mistrust between people and I think even our political system make it so we all mistrust each other you know Democrats mistrust Republicans Republicans because we're all like so angry with each other and I think that it makes it very difficult not just politically but so many people I think get her or feel that you can't trust somebody and I think our society even in the job situation there's you know all of us are replaceable now and I think we don't put a value on human life when you don't put a value on people as individuals I think what you get is a society full of people who don't value other people's individuality and I've seen that more and more just in my own practice I've seen so many you're right I mean so many kids and teens and adults are lonely now yeah and and at the same time you see all this stuff on Facebook and there's discrepancy between everything that you see in the movies and the media about how everybody's having a great time they're all party and they're all having sex and at the same time you're home and lonely and you can kind of see the disparity where everybody's depressed yeah I know it looks that way to me too that's why when I read these stories I kind of think like gee this is not my experience now you you have a practice you see people if if a man came to you and said I want to be married I I know that psychologists don't part in the business of giving advice but just just an imagination if a man came to you and said I would like to find a wife what would your advice be to him you know in the old days my advice was I hope that you can find somebody really great and let's help you to do that but over the years I've been impressive so long that my advice has changed over the years a lot of times if it depends what age if the man really really wants children I would try to teach that person or help that that man to find a partner that is really suitable for him but I I tend towards more seeing middle-aged men and older who have already been married and a lot of those men a lot of them tell me I never want to get married again the reason is that because they were hurt so badly the first time a wife has taken their children I also want to say that in our society kids are kind of used as pawns in other words in our society more and more those children used to in the old days they belong more to the men to the husband to the father they had more say and how the where the kids went nowadays if you look at almost in every case the woman 80% of his time gets those children then it's very very difficult for men to actually get access to their kids if there's a divorce and I think that children are used as a pawn and because of that I think that when men are middle-aged and they already have children maybe there's not as much a point of getting married at that point so I might get the advice to the man maybe you want to wait and see is that something you really want to do I mean I don't know I hear what you're saying and it's very difficult it's a legal contract a legal contract that says two men now you're responsible and if things go wrong you're the courts are not going to favor you the courts are against you in the majority of cases so you you wrote a book called men on strike why men are boycotting marriage fatherhood and the American Dream and why it matters why does it matter why why is what's going on important because what we're seeing is so many men and boys withdrawing today we see boys in school that are all on they're all diagnosed with ADHD because boys can't you know we could go on and on but we know that boys are having a lot of emotional problems they're not learning in schools we're not going to college as often they're not doing jobs anymore and there were drawing from society and I think that affects number one I mean first of all it affects themselves as individuals it affects our society and it affects economically it tooks every aspect of our lives a lot of women are unhappy but that's not the important thing I wrote men on strike because it's important that men be treated as autonomous beings who deserve respect and an educate and due process in this country and that brings me to another point which is that I really like what the Trump administration is doing with that seat of us with going after title 9 and looking at some of these due process rights for young men on college campuses young men's rights under the Obama administration were taken away in that they reduce the level of preponderance of evidence that one needs to accuse a young man of rape or sexual assault on campus and what devos is trying to do is say hey let's put that preponderance back up instead of fifty percent of the time you're guilty let's have it go back to more a criminal case where it would be you need beyond a shadow of a doubt or you know it seems so out there if you're a young man in college today just imagine you know I know you have a son I know other people have sons out there and I think a lot of men and young men and their fathers are afraid you know what do you do if your son is accused of sexual abuse I mean there are many issues that young men are facing today that they didn't face years ago and it's a really very much a tragedy that in the United Sates of America that young man's due process rights are so easily flippantly tossed out it's a strange paradox that feminists have essentially said that they want to be treated exactly like men but they want men to still behave as if they were young ladies from the Victorian era and I you can't have both things as a price you pay for every man to have responsibility and women to have privilege that's the new feminist mentality and the old divison mentality was more you know you always think of it as more equality that's what I thought when I was growing up in the seventies names it was sort of like oh you thought it was going to be like an equality type thing and now it's just well women are privileged a man need to be responsible they don't say that right but that's what we see in the legal and a political realm yeah dr. Helen Smith the author of men on strike why men are boycotting marriage fatherhood and the American dream and why it matters can find her online at PJ Mediacom slash dr. Helen all one word Helen it's great to see you I hope you ll see it say hi to the Glen okay I just before before we get the stuff I like I just want to add one more thing about what I was talking about before or that so much of what happens on the left is about the fact that what the stuff that they're saying isn't true and that not only is it not true but they don't care that it's not true and they just don't want to be interrupted don't it's like don't interrupt me while I'm lying you know and there's a new study now that shows that global warming is happening much more slowly than they thought it was okay now they're selling this as oh this means we have more time to implement the Paris Accord and it'll work but what really this story is is that they're computer models were way way off and they they're selling this whole story as if like oh you know that this gives us more time more time but really it seems to me that like the scientists themselves are saying well yeah you know our computer models were really just the kind of amalgam of different models and kind of an average and all this stuff and now we're kind of changing our mind one one guy one scientist said we haven't seen that rapid acceleration and warming after 2000 that we see in the models we haven't seen that in observations and other scientist said when the facts change I change my mind and you know they're still obviously salient and this climate is changing we know it's changing we know that we all want there to be less pollution that's always a good thing but the panic and the basic selling of left-wing politics of the government taking over oil supplies taking over energy supplies all that stuff has been used to panic and when you don't buy it first they start with the emotion we're all gonna die then they start with the hectoring you know you're a climate denier and finally they get around to just punch me in the face it's the Jimmy Kimmel party it's Jimmy Kimmel is just exemplifying his entire the entire party all right stuff I like to end our week stuff you know it's the Cleveland last weekend already this was a really good last week I know it was like poof and and Puerto Rico is like gone already right in Puerto Rico in Mexico we've lost every place where I mean it's again it can only come closer and closer we're we've been having some small earthquakes here I sleep through them of course but like everybody else is memory yeah I didn't feel it at all but apparently it was it was real today I want to talk about the fact that many many of our great film directors who are not associated with small more crime films started out making small more crime films and I the reason I point this out is because small nor our crime films are just about my favorite kind of film and so when you go back and you find these great great films made by directors who later became famous for other things they really are like little gems so let me just start with the killing which is Stanley Kubrick I don't think it was his first film but it was very very early on I could coerce Kubrick went on to make 2001 and all those films but the killing is a terrific film it's the final scene has been stolen again and again and again when you get to the end of this picture you will see it's basically a bank heist story sterling Hayden one of the great underrated new are actors it was written by Kubrick and Jim Thompson the guy who wrote The Killer Inside Me he wrote a number of not famous noir novels very he's very famous cult noir writer and so he co-wrote the script and it's a bank heist story a bunch of criminals get together and here is one of them played by the absolutely mortal Elisha cook Jr who played the gunman in The Maltese Falcon and he's he's enslaved by this femme fatale and he just wants to tell her that soon as soon as this bank heist comes off he's going to be rich rich rich and here's the scene how would you define money George if you're thinking to give me your collection of Roosevelt I mean big money hundreds of thousands of dollars I really don't feel well do you are you sure that pains in your stomach I'm gonna have it sherry hundreds of thousands maybe a half a million of course you are darling did you put the right address on the envelope when you send it to the North Pole go ahead and well wait you see maybe you won't be laughing so hard in a few days really serious you really think you're gonna have a lot of money nothing I know it you've never been a liar George you don't have enough imagination to lie so what makes you think or know that you're gonna have several hundred thousand dollars cause I do I just can't talk about it that's all not even to me your little share shouldn't have even mentioned I was gonna have it it's not that I mind I know I can trust you but if these other guys other guys I can't talk about it Jerry I just can't I love it I love the current that collar has turned up he's got the sweaty collar and all his use Elysee cooks who knew he was just the ultimate little mousy guy you know it was like always trying to be a bigger man then he wanted another great film by a guy went on to become a big-time director shallow grave 1994 people do not see this I actually saw this in the theater in 1994 it's got even McGregor Christopher Eccleston who you've seen him Eccleston who you've seen a million times Kerry Fox a bunch of guy up three people two guys and a girl had this beautiful apartment and they're kind of there's something a little bit sadistic about their relationship they need a roommate and so they rent it to a guy who comes in and one day they find out they walk into his bedroom and he's dead and he's got a suitcase full of money and so they decide hmm what do we what do we do you know and they decide they're gonna keep the money but now they got to get rid of the dead guy that hits the title shallow grave but of course a suitcase full of money belongs to somebody right so this it's just a movie where this threat it just keeps coming and coming and coming while they keep ignoring it and here's the scene where Eccleston tries to get you and McGregor to face up to the fact that somebody is coming to get this money and Ewan McGregor just won't listen listen can we talk about something no now I have an idea it's important we need to decide where you just stop lying to love and to happiness forever no until you've it says it's just this wonderful kind of you know young young people you know fooling around except this absolute threat is hovering over who's really good picture Heavenly Creatures I have a personal story I may have told this on the air before but a really good story Heavenly Creatures as I believe that first film by Peter Jackson maybe there may have been one before but Heavenly Creatures is by Peter Jackson obviously the guy went on to make Lord of the Rings and it's a really small film early film of Cate it was actually the first film like Kate Winslet she's paired off with a woman named melanie lynskey this is a true story a true story about two girls in New Zealand who got into what is called a folly ado and they were 15 years old the father you know was paired what was how do I translate madness for to my son Spencer the linguists today you know and they and this is a true story 1954 and they finally came up with they were trying to part them because they were afraid they were getting too romantic the two girls and the mother was trying to part them and they finally came up with an idea of what to do and here's the scene where one of them introduces that idea to the other I know what to do about mother we don't want to go to too much trouble some sort of accident people die everyday so III may have told the story before but it's worth telling again I was in London and went to a very fancy party for writers at the houses of parliament so tuxedo black tie and all this and I'm mingling talking to people my wife is there and I met Anne Perry who is a very famous very best-selling writer of a historical detective fiction she writes these detective stories that take place in Victorian England okay and Perry big bestseller we're having a charming conversation she lives way way up in Scotland she looks absolutely I think it's I think it's called like Lands End or some some places like the end of the world where she lives and we're chatting and we walk away and my wife said you know I found her charming I found them very charming I said you know that's kind of an offbeat woman that's an offbeat one I said why she said I don't know it's just something offbeat about so we went home for the summer we came back to America for the summer this is maybe three days later okay three days later I sit down I opened the New York Times a former newspaper and there's a story about an Perry and Perry was one of the girls in that murder case she spent five years in prison she changed her name and she basically left her past behind she was the girl played by Kate Winslet and she left her past behind and made a career for herself as a best-selling the crime novelist she became a Mormon a devout Mormon I think and this story just came out three days after a mess on my wife just like psychologists like looked right at her and saw that something was off about her I didn't see it at all but it was pretty interesting that story goes that there's more to that story but I won't tell it today finally final last small crime film by directors went on to become big directors bound which is by the Wachowskis the guys who made the matrix and Vees for Vendetta and the story is Joel Silver who I worked by wrote two screenplays for Joel silvered big big director die hard every basically every great action film ever made was made by Joel's soldier Joel silver tells the story that the Wachowski say isn't true that they came to him after writing a film called assassins I think and they said we want to make the matrix and Joel silver is famously a sort of meat and potatoes guy you know he's not the kind of guy you think of making the matrix so he ultimately did make it but he said you know this is a hundred million dollar film before you make that show me you can direct a five million dollar film Russ where this picture is not true they just wanted to direct a film but they made this picture that is it's really good it is about it's about a girls who fall into a lesbian relationship except one of them wants to get out of the relationship she's in with a mobster okay and this is the scene it who is Gina Gershon plays the kind of masculine lesbian the the bush the butch one I guess you would say and jennifer Tilly jennifer Tilly plays the vas super soft feminine lesbian and this is the scene where they they first meet she comes in and Gina Gershon has been working on the house and her hands are all dirty and she just looks like a a plumber and she brings her a cup of coffee I guess you're a straight black good guess Thanks my pleasure to be perfectly honest I did have a slightly ulterior motive husband I might ask you a little favor favor yeah you see I'm kind of a night person and I was wondering if you might wait a little bit before you start using the power tools sorry oh no it's not your fault it's just the walls here are so terribly thin really

in awe people who can fix things my dad was like that I never had anything new whenever anything was broken he would just open it up tinker with it a little bit great lesbian or very sexy great sex
