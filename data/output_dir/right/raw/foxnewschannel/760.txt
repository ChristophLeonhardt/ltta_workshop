ONE TOO MANY.

377
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:18,799
WE HAVE TO SCREEN AND THAT AND

378
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,100
DO THOSE THINGS.

379
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,540
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

380
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,274
GREG: CAT, DO YOU THINK WHERE

381
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:28,075
YOU THINK THIS IS GOING WITH THE

382
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:28,676
CONSTANT NOT THE HITLER

383
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:29,076
COMPARISON?

384
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,879
WILL THIS END?

385
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,115
KAT: I DID NOT LIKE THE

386
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:35,616
SEPARATION POLICY.

387
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,585
NOT A FAN GLAD THAT'S NOT A

388
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,720
THING ANYMORE ALTHOUGH I REALLY

389
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,327
JUST GENERALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND

390
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:47,161
HOW IT IS NOT TO GERMANY?

391
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:48,195
I DON'T GET HOW THAT'S EVEN A

392
00:12:48,195 --> 00:12:48,596
COMPARISON.

393
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,296
I'M CONVINCED THAT A LOT OF

394
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:51,332
PEOPLE MAYBE DON'T KNOW WHAT

395
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:51,799
NAZI GERMANY IS.

396
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:58,138
GREG: THAT IS A GOOD POINT.

397
00:12:58,138 --> 00:12:59,006
KAT: MAYBE, I THINK IT SPREAD

398
00:12:59,006 --> 00:12:59,440
LIKE WILDFIRE.

399
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,341
FIGURE 1% SAY IT AND THEY SAY

400
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:07,481
THAT TO FIT IN IS TO AGREE SO

401
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,515
THAT WAY EVERYBODY OR THE THINK

402
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:09,583
THAT YOU ARE A JERK SO EVERYONE

403
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,250
KEEPS REPEATING IT WITHOUT

404
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,986
REALLY EXPLAINING IT.

405
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,588
>> IF YOU BELIEVE BEING A NAZI

406
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:18,859
IS BEING IN FAVOR OF SCHOOL

407
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:19,627
VOUCHERS YOU GIVEN YOURSELF A

408
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:23,931
WIDE RANGE.

409
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:24,732
IF ANYONE DOESN'T DISAGREE WITH

410
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:25,833
YOU THAT'S HOW THEY GET AWAY

411
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:26,233
WITH IT.

412
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:26,867
IT'S COMPLETELY ILLOGICAL.

413
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:36,610
GREG: I THANK YOU ARE A NAZI.

414
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,411
THE IRONIC CONCLUSION HERE AND I

415
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,412
KNOW WE HAVE TO GO BUT TRUMP

416
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:39,546
GAVE A LOT OF THESE CYNICAL

417
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:40,414
HYPOCRITES THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO

418
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:41,582
THE JOB.

419
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:42,516
THIS IS A PROBLEM THE REPORTERS

420
00:13:42,516 --> 00:00:00,000
ARE NOW GOING AFTER ONLY BECAUSE
