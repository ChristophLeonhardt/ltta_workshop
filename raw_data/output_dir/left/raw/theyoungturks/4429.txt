22
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,460
the reason why he's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> prison is because</font>

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,760
take a look at video<font color="#CCCCCC"> from his parole</font>

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,140
hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. Simpson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I cast my</font>

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're a consistent board I will let</font>

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know that that consistency also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes</font>

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,920
to parole and we do not look<font color="#E5E5E5"> kindly upon</font>

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,220
parole violations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if I cast my vote</font>

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,259
to grant<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and it concludes the</font>

35
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,020
hearing our expectation would be that

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">you not violate even the simplest</font>

37
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,390
condition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> parole having said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am prepared to cast a vote I am</font>

39
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,070
prepared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the commissioners to set</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">conditions if if that happens we will</font>

41

<font color="#CCCCCC">produce an order sometime in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next 15</font>

42
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,979
to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be faxed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

43
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:06,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">or presented to you of the institution</font>

44
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it will become a public record</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,980
based on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that mr. Simpson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,990
vote to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grant parole when eligible and</font>

47
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:43,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will conclude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this Harry all right</font>

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,890
so during the hearing he also talked

49
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the robbery itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he said</font>

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,580
that the two memorabilia<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealers that he</font>

51
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,519
decided to target<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't you know they</font>

52
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,190
had stolen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that merchandise or that</font>

53
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">material from him it was rightfully his</font>

54
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result it was the reason why he</font>

55
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull out a gun and threatened</font>

56
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,380
them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially robbed them at</font>

57
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,829
gunpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because he</font>

58
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">had good behavior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apparently behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bars</font>

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so they had already cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down his</font>

60
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,459
sentence<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know since he was</font>

61
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,620
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parole he decided to move forward</font>

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this hearing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have</font>

63
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,299
unanimously decided to let him go

64
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:28,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went on for a while and my favorite</font>

67
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,450
said I believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jury system</font>

68
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,450
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you believe in the</font>

69
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">theory said and the other was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,430
one has ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> accused me of pulling a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">weapon of any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on anyone no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one has</font>

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,310
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel guilty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for watching it</font>

77
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,069
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the circus and and I guess I was</font>

79
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,109
when I was drawn in in a voyeuristic way

80
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,170
but he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain arrogance to him</font>

81
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,629
through the entire process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talking</font>

82
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:14,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">about for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effect of alcohol</font>

00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,539
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and his handling of</font>

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it all it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know he</font>

92
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably served longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than he should</font>

mentioned that aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it during the</font>

hearing they say we got a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> letters</font>

Americans literally according to USA

113
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,720
Today<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be held</font>

118
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,080
Nevada<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of that case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's</font>

119
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you can't do that what I found</font>

120
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,979
striking<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of the four panelists that</font>

121

125
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,860

127
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,259
as far as I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea like</font>
