Donald Trump making waves tonight with a new invite for Vladimir Putin to visit the White House and as that occurs a man who has paid millions by putin's oleg arc to support russian political interests in the ukraine is one week away from a very anticipated trial Trump's jailed campaign chief Paul Manafort begins his first trial next week and that means tonight we're getting some of the first clues about the case against similars prosecutors telling the court they have up to 500 items of evidence like pictures of man affords multiple homes from Brooklyn to the Hamptons to Virginia and to support a tax in money laundering case they are showing his spending like his home putting green high-priced Yankees tickets a $21,000 watch designer clothes oriental rugs this is all pretty interesting now the trial strategy here is not class resentment anyone can buy luxury goods prosecutors are making the case that man afford hit illegal income evading taxes and using purchases for money laundering so people who live luxury lives may relate to some of the choices man afford made you know there's a classic saying and hip-hop beamer benz or bentley my jeans are never empty and if you have keys to those three cars obviously your jean pockets are going to be quite full to say nothing of the money also filling your jeans and that's the argument prosecutors are sort of making against Manta Ford the new evidence list showing that he has keys to several cars a Benz just like Lloyd Banks plus a Land Rover and that evidence builds on the larger case in both these trials mana Ford's jeans prosecutors say were never empty and they weren't just full of car keys they were full of money allegedly laundered money I'm joined by Margaret I'm sat at Oriel board and former Watergate special prosecutor Nick Ackerman I put the question to you Beamer Benz or Bentley well I think this is the whole argument they're going to make to the jury on this case is all about greed this is a man who basically earned 75 million dollars from the Ukraine government and didn't report it on his taxes instead he bought all of these luxury items this is not going to appeal to the jury in terms of this person stealing that much money that he doesn't stealing from the government basically not reporting it on his income taxes you're saying just by by defrauding the United States government that's right norm of stealing because other people lawfully pay their tax that's right and there aren't going to be too many people on that jury that ever see that much money I've never mind that ain't not that many people in the United States who see that do you think it is dabbling in class resentment I mean a lot of Americans say if people earn money and make money the honest way they cheer that on they cheer success no but I think this is showing that by committing these crimes it's greed it's a crime of greed and what he's done here is he's lined his own pockets to the detriment of all the good honest citizens who do pay their taxes it looks from the evidence list and as I say this is new stuff we're getting so we're really getting down to the details beyond you know an indictment can also can always make someone look bad and not stand up in court we're getting to the evidence what do you think it looks like for I think two things the first is that it's just I just find it interesting that he I think the argument is essentially he's been parking money in the same way that Russians Park money in New York I mean this is it's not legitimate money so therefore you have to go buy really really expensive kind of outrageously expensive things and I think a lot of people find that extremely disgusting and so that will play with the jury but the other issue here is the level of detail I mean you look at the level of detail the putting green and so on and so forth it just it suggests that you know hey jury hey public we have so much information about what's going on I know exactly what car you bought you know how you paid for this house I mean that it really to me is suggestive that there's much more to come right because this is of course as Nick and walk us through this is an early stage pretrial activity take a look at Donald Trump talking about Paul Manafort and his new interview amidst all the other Russian stuff this week with Paul Manafort who's that who really is a nice man you look at what's going on with him it's like Al Capone just to say things it's a very sad thing for our country to see this well that's precisely what Al Capone was convicted of income tax evasion so I don't know why Donald Trump is comparing his former campaign manager to Donald Trump I mean if you go the other loan I mean to Al Capone yeah I mean it makes I mean I guess it does make sense but I don't know if he understands in a way that nothing makes sense right exactly in that way but I mean it's and this is sort of like you know oh my former assistant was convicted you know they're saying he did drugs you know I look at him as an El Chapo type figure and you're like wait what well it's all relative I mean the president not only does he not sound presidential he sounds more and more like you know every other dictator on the block I think that's right and look at this again is is a obvious example of a total disregard for the law offer for the law seventy five million dollars that was taken in the Ukraine and then put into all of these luxury items hidden in a way I mean you can even look through these exhibits you can see what he did he put it through all of these different foreign accounts offshore accounts I mean one of the things that the government has to prove here is are the badges of fraud to show that he was being deceptive that he was knowingly Dewar's knowingly do this you can't just be convicted of tax evasion for mistake or negligence well the overlap in both the points you're making is the president's job is to faithfully execute the laws the Justice Department is prosecuting Paul manna for under the Trump administration now he's innocent till proven guilty but you would expect any president to say we're gonna pursue the case and if proven if I we're all gonna learn things that maybe he wants to claim he didn't know about Paul metaphore then of course he should go to jail because he's defrauding everyone and that's not the message at all that we see it in that clip which is remarkable hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or
