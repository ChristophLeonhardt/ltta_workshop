ALTHOUGH, BOOKED IN WASHINGTON STATE ON WELFARE FRAUD, CHARGES OVERNIGHT. POLICE SAY SHE STOLE $8000 IN FOOD AND CHILDCARE BENEFITS. SINGER JACKS CAME TO THE SCENE ON SEASON 14 OF AMERICAN IDOL BUT HER BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY YET COULD BE THE INVITATION TO PERFORM AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATION BUT NOT EVERYONE PRAISING THE PERFORMANCE, SOME ATTACKING HER ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT SHE IS DEFENDING HERSELF AND THE ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY AND JOINS US NOW. SO THE PRESIDENT ASKED YOU TO PERFORM TOMORROW, ALONG WITH MILITARY BEN AND SARAH EVANS. WHAT WAS YOUR INITIAL REACTION? HOW CRAZY IS THIS THE WHITE HOUSE JUST INVITED ME TO PERFORM, GOING TO BE SOME BUCKET LIST, TO GET ONSTAGE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND PRETTY COOL TO SING IN FRONT OF A MILITARY BAND. TALKED ABOUT LACK OF CIVILITY, PEOPLE DON'T AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT THEY ARE HATERS, THEY HATE ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH HIM, YOU GOT A LOT OF BACKLASH ABOUT THIS, WHAT WERE PEOPLE SAYING? SOMETIMES LESS ABOUT POLITICS AND MORE VULGARITY AND A LOT OF BULLYING AND NOT SOMETHING I AM NOT USED TO IN GENERAL BECAUSE GROWING UP IN MUSIC I AM ALWAYS DEALING WITH CYBERBULLYING AND HATE ON THE INTERNET BUT THIS WAS AN AGGRESSIVE ONE, THINGS LIKE KILL YOUR SELF, CRAZY THINGS, PRETTY BAD. IT IS HURTFUL THAT I WATCHED THE VIDEO YOU POSTED THANK MY BROTHER IS IN THE MILITARY, HE IS A MARINE, HE IS 20 YEARS OLD, MY DAD, A FIRST RESPONDER. WHY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SUPPORT THE MILITARY, AND WE OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE CELEBRATION? I COME FROM A STRONG MILITARY BACKGROUND, I AM SO PROUD OF MY LITTLE BROTHER AND MY FATHER. HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HERO, THE OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR HIM AND HONOR MY FATHER AND HONOR THE TROOPS IN GENERAL. IT IS A MILITARY EVENT. I LOVE THE MARINES. FAMILY AND RESPECT THE OFFICE. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE IT WITH HIM, HE IS HERE, HE HAS FLOWN IN. YOU SAID IN THE VIDEO I WATCHED ONLINE IT IS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE CAN'T SEPARATE POLITICS FROM PATRIOTISM. WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE FOR THE PEOPLE WATCHING THAT ARE SO ANGRY? MY MESSAGE WOULD PROBABLY BE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ABOUT ANGER, DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SO DIVISIVE, DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. WE ARE SUCH AN AMAZING COUNTRY AND THE UNIT THAT THE FOURTH OF JULY IS THE BIRTHDAY OF THE COUNTRY AND TIME TO UNITE AND CELEBRATE. I REALLY HATE THE PETTINESS. I WOULD RATHER HONOR THE TROOPS AND BE PATRIOTIC ABOUT IT. AND BE PATRIOTIC ABOUT IT. A LOT OF FINGERS MIGHT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRESIDENT MIGHT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARED OF THE YOU STRONG ENOUGH TO SAY I DON'T CARE? I HAVE ALWAYS APOLITICAL. I AM CREATIVE AND STILL LEARNING AND STILL GROWING. I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT RIGHT NOW, STILL READING AND TRAVELING, TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM POLITICALLY. BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN AND YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL FEAR OF LOSING YOUR JOB IN ANY WAY SO TO ME IT IS A SAD THING WHEN POLITICS BECOMES PART OF YOUR EVERYDAY IDENTITY IN LIFE BUT WHERE I AM NOW IS FOCUSED ON MUSIC AND JUST LOVING LIFE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US, GOD BLESS YOUR FAMILY
