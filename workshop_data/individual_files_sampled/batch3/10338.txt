day three at the Winter Olympics in South Korea has seen seven sets of medals handed out figure skating and snowboarding have winners and they're still ski jumping biathlon and speed skating among other sports ahead today Russian athletes got their second medal silver in the figure skating with Canada winning gold and the u.s. coming third as well as the competitive side there's also the social aspect to the games with most nations hosting their own hospitality houses as they called Russia of course isn't officially represented at the Olympics but they're still the corner of Pyeongchang that feels very much Russian as a hubert rank has been finding out as usual there are all kinds of national houses at the Olympics in Byung Cheng the likes of the Holland house near the coast the countries like Austria and Switzerland naturally settled a bit higher in the mountains and since Team Russia doesn't officially exist here the traditional Russian house doesn't either or isn't that a matryoshka to make sure Russian fans have a home in Korea it took a few tricks after all the IOC must be respected the place is called the sports house obviously you'll find white blue and red in the design but never specifically in the recognizable pattern like here some white and black in between what could appear to be flag stripes no official Russian symbols the matroyshkas haven't become official right other than that pure Russian fun and spirit among the attractions here are these hockey jerseys from every year at the Olympics that Russia won gold but on this one from 1992 like here in Korea you won't find the letters Russia or the USSR I'll go ask the guest if they know why why did Russia compete under a neutral flag at the Olympics 26 years ago I don't know I got some clues for you countries take turns with the why Olympic flag and respect to the IOC I think it's tell me is it don't be sorry no I think it's the Russians just established as a country so being union clubs right now was just established as a country that's when the Soviet Union had its breakup so neutral Flags weren't always down to the IOC sanctions Ilya Buitrago RT Pyeongchang while even traveling to see one of the world's largest sporting events can prove to be challenging especially with similar sounding Korean cities on everyone's lips
