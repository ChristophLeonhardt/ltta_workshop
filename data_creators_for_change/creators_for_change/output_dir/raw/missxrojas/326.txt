to other people as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was great</font>

27
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,690
and Alice looked at each other for some

28
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,300
time in silence and last<font color="#E5E5E5"> the caterpillar</font>

29
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,829
took the hooker out of its mouth and

30
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,309
addressed her in a language sleepy voice

31
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:58,289
who are you said the caterpillar this

32
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,090
was not an encouraging opening for a

33
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation and it's replied rather</font>

34
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,030
shyly I I hardly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sir just at</font>

present at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know who I was when I</font>

got<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this morning but I think I must</font>

have changed several times since then

what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that said the cash</font>

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,229
will astound me explain yourself I can't

40
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,420
explain myself I'm afraid sir because

41
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not myself you see I don't see so</font>

the caterpillar I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,049
it more clearly Alice replied very

44
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,000
politely for I can't understand it

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,979
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> to begin with and being so many</font>

46
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">different sizes in a day is very</font>

47
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,869
confusing it isn't said the caterpillar

48
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,460
well perhaps you haven't found it so yet

49
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,320
said Alice but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to turn to</font>

50
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">a chrysalis you will someday you know</font>

51
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,280
and then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that edge of butterfly I</font>

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,450
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll feel it a little</font>

53
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,659
queer weren't you not a bit said the

54
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,210
caterpillar well perhaps your feelings

55
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,520
may be different Solaris all I know is

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,610
it would feel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> queer to me you said</font>

57
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the caterpillar contemptuously who are</font>

58

<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of a conversation as felt a</font>

60
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,460
little irritated at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the caterpillars</font>

61
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,829
making very short remarks and she drew

62
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,649
herself up and said very gravely I think

63
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,979
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are first</font>

64
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,680
why said the gospel<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

65
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,900
it was another puzzling question and as

66
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,430
Alice could not think of any good reason

67
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,379
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the caterpillar seemed to be in a</font>

68
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,599
very unpleasant state of mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> she turned</font>

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,720
away come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cash fella called</font>

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,590
after her I'm something important to say

71
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,959
this sounded promising certainly Alice

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,049
turned and came back again keep your

73
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,650
chamber said the caterpillar is that all

74
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,780
said Alice swallowing down<font color="#CCCCCC"> her anger as</font>

75
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,959
well she could<font color="#E5E5E5"> no said the caterpillar I</font>

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,730
was thought she might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well wait is</font>

77
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,440
she had<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else to do perhaps after</font>

78
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">all it might tell her something worth</font>

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,010
hearing for some minutes it puffed away

80
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,739
without speaking but<font color="#E5E5E5"> none last it folded</font>

81
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,359
its arms took the hooker out of its

82
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:57,000
mouth again and said so you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I'm afraid I am sir said</font>

84
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,980
Alice I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember things as I used</font>

85
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,019
and I don't keep the same size for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

86
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,970
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> together can't remember what</font>

87
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,879
things so the caterpillar well I've

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to say how doth the little busy</font>

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,620
bee but it all came different<font color="#CCCCCC"> as replied</font>

90
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,310
in a very melancholy voice repeat you

92

began you are old father William the

very white and yet you incessantly sound

96
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,620
in your head do you think at your age it

97
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,720
is right in my youth father<font color="#E5E5E5"> William</font>

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,769
and argued each case with my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,690
the muscular strength which it gave to

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,500
questions and that is enough said his

124
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
father<font color="#E5E5E5"> did give yourself airs</font>

125
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,670
do you think I can listen all day<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,140
such stuff be off or<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll kick you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">downstairs that is not said right said</font>

128
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,870
the caterpillar not quite right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

129
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,640
frames at Alice timidly some of the

words have got<font color="#CCCCCC"> halted it is wrong from</font>

131
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,380
beginning to end so the caterpillar

132
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,360
decidedly and there was silence for some

133
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
minutes the caterpillar was fast to

134
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,090
speak what size do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be it</font>

135
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,550
asked oh I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular as to size</font>

136
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,710
Alice hastily replied and it what

137
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,480
doesn't like changing so often you know

138
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,500
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know said the caterpillar Alice</font>

139
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,330
said nothing she had never<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so much</font>

140
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,640
contradicted in all her life before and

141
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,960
she felt that she was losing her temper

142
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,310
are you content<font color="#E5E5E5"> now said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the caterpillar</font>

143
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,600
well I should like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little larger</font>

144
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,360
size you wouldn't mind said Alice three

145
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,980
inches is such a wretched height to be

146
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,560
it is a very good height indeed said the

147
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,180
caterpillar angrily wearing itself

148
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,940
upright as it spoke it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly three</font>

149
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,830
inches<font color="#CCCCCC"> high but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not used to it they</font>

150
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,930
did poor Alice in a piteous tone and she

151
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,610
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to herself I wish the creatures</font>

152
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,070
wouldn't be so easily offended you'll

153
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">get used to it in time said the</font>

154
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,340
caterpillar and it put the hooker<font color="#CCCCCC"> in its</font>

mouth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> began smoking again this time</font>

156
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,270
Alice waited patiently until it chose to

157
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,400
speak again in a minute or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> the catch</font>

158
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">better check the hooker out of its mouth</font>

159
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you and once or twice and shook</font>

160
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,050
itself then he got down off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

161
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,270
room and crawled away to the grass Mary

162
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,430
remarking as it went one side will make

163
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,110
you grow taller the other side will make

164
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,390
you grow shorter one side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

165
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,430
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of what thought Alice to</font>

166
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,979
herself of the mushrooms at the

167
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,870
caterpillar just as if she had asked it

168
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,000
aloud and in another moment it was out

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,070
of sight Alice remained looking

170
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,540
thoughtfully a mushroom for a minute

171
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,250
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make out which were the two</font>

172
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,110
sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and as it was perfectly</font>

173
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,820
round she found this a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

174
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,340
question however<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah she stretched her</font>

175
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">arms around it as far as they would go</font>

176
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:13,970
and broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a bit of the edge with each</font>

177
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,850
hand know which is which she said to

178
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,530
herself and nibbled the little of the

179
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-hand bit to try the effect the</font>

180
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,190
next moment she felt a violent blow

181
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,530
underneath her chin it has struck a foot

182
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,479
she was a good deal frightened by this

183
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
very Sun trained but she felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,450
was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be lost and she was</font>

185
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,370
shrinking rapidly so she said to work at

186
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,110
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat some of the other bit her</font>

187
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,729
tongue was pressed so close think it's a

188
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,500
foot there was hardly room to open her

189
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,880
mouth but she did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at last</font>

190
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,860
minus y1 warlord the left-handed bit

191
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,260
come my head's free at last said Alice

192
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,180
in a tone delight which changed into

193
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,710
alarm in another moment when she found

194
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,940
that her shoulders were nowhere to be

195
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,950
found or she could see where she looked

196
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,020
down was an immense length of neck which

197
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,000
she drives like a stalk out of the sea

198
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,830
of green leaves that lay far below her

199
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,470
what can all that green stuff be said

200
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,900
Alice and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my shoulders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

201
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,540
and oh my poor hands how is it I can't

202
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,790
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you she was moving them about as she</font>

203
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,800
spoke but no result seem to follow

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,540
except a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> shaking amongst the</font>

205
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,060
distance green leaves as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be no</font>

206
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,470
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her getting her hands up to</font>

207
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,360
her head she tried to get her head down

208
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,010
to them and was delighted to find that

209
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,870
her neck would<font color="#CCCCCC"> bend about his easily in</font>

210
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,420
any direction like a serpent she had

211
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,160
succeeded<font color="#E5E5E5"> in carving it down into a</font>

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,050
graceful zigzag and<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to dive in</font>

213
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,460
among the leaves which he found doing

214
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,840
nothing with the tops of trees under

215
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,310
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> she had been wondering when a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sharp has made her drawback in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hurry a</font>

217
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,210
large pigeon had flown into her face I

218
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,990
was beating her violently with its wings

219
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,390
serpent to scream the pigeon I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

220
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,450
serpent said Alice indignantly let me

221
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,570
alone servant hey see you again repeated

222
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,580
the pigeon but in a more subdued tone

223
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,250
and added with a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sob I've tried</font>

224
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,470
every way but nothing seems to suit them

225
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,870
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the least idea what you're</font>

226
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,210
talking about said Alice I've tried to

227
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,100
Bruce of trees and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've tried banks and</font>

228
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,570
I've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> hedges the pictures we went</font>

229
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,430
on without attending to her but<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

230
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,280
serpents there's no pleasing them Alice

231
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,930
was more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more puzzled but she</font>

232
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,950
thought there was no<font color="#CCCCCC"> use in saying</font>

233
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,540
anything more to the pigeon had finished

234
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,360
as if it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble enough hatching</font>

235
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,430
the eggs said the pigeon but I must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

236
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,140
on the lookout for servants night and

237
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,880
day why have another wink of sleep these

238
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,160
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks I'm very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

239
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,260
annoyed said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice was beginning to see</font>

240
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,270
its meaning and justice<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh taken the</font>

241
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,130
highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree the world continue to the</font>

242
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,440
pigeon raises voice to a shriek and just

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,270
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was thinking I should be free of</font>

244
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,860
them at last they must needs come

245
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,179
raining down from the sky Oh serpent but

246
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,159
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a serpent I tell you said Alice</font>

247
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,900
I'm a I am well what I said the pigeon I

248
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,340
can see you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to invent</font>

249
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,850
something I'm a little girl said Alice

250
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,560
rather doubtfully she remember the

251
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,820
number of changes she'd gone through

252
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

253
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,420
likely story indeed said the pigeon in a

254
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,060
tone of the deepest contempt I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

255
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,130
good many little girls in my time and

256
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,019
never one<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a neck suppose you'll be</font>

257
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:01,130
telling me next that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've never</font>

258
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed an egg I have tasted excitingly</font>

259
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,529
said Alice was a very truthful child but

260
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,149
little girls eat eggs quite as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

261
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,850
serpents do you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it</font>

262
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,920
that the pigeon but if they do why then

263
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,540
they're a kind of serpent that's all I

264
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">can say this was such new idea Alice</font>

265
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:17,990
that she was quite silent for a minute

266
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,610
or two which gave the pigeon the

267
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,440
opportunity of adding you're looking

268
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,149
very exciting that well enough and what

269
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,380
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether you're a</font>

270
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,329
little girl or a servant well it matches

271
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,029
a good deal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said Alice hastily but</font>

272
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:30,529
I'm not looking for eggs as it happens

273
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it was I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should have won yours I</font>

274
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,889
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> them raw well I'll be off</font>

275
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:36,380
then said the pigeon is salty tone is it

276
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,839
settled down into its nest as crouched

277
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,399
down among the trees as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as she</font>

278
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,870
could for<font color="#E5E5E5"> her neck kept getting</font>

279
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,940
entangled among the branches and every

280
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,649
now and then she had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and untwist</font>

281
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,540
it after a while she remembered that she

282
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">still held the pieces of mushroom in her</font>

283
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,170
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work very carefully</font>

284
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,630
nibbling fast one and then the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

285
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,160
growing sometimes taller and sometimes

286
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,959
shorter and so she had succeeded and

287
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,730
bring herself down to her usual height

288
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,829
it was so long since she had been

289
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,209
anything near the right size that it

290
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,010
felt quite strange at first but she got

291
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,420
used to it in a few minutes I'm again

292
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,459
talking to herself as usual comme des

293
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,740
half my plan done now how puzzling all

294
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,510
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes are I'm never sure what</font>

295
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,620
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be from one minute to</font>

296
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,329
another however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got back to my</font>

297
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:16,220
right size<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next thing is how to get</font>

298
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that beautiful garden how is that</font>

299
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,089
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> da</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder as she said this she</font>

300
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,430
came suddenly upon an open place with a

301
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">little house in his about four feet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

302
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,990
nothing lives there thought Alice he'll

303
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,579
never do to comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> than this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size</font>

304
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:30,529
why I should frighten them out of their

305
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,570
wit's so she brought nibbling on the

306
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">right-hand bit again and did not venture</font>

307
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,540
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the house if she had brought</font>

308
00:10:35,540 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">herself down to nine inches high</font>
