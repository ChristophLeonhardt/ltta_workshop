this is one of the newly erected camps in Paris it's been set up to shelter around a hundred and seventy migrants who are amongst the thousand or so who are cleared from the canals of Paris during dual side raids thousands of migrants had been camped along the canals for many many months living in squalid conditions with you - no comforts the mayor of Paris and the Interior Minister Jean our column had been embroiled in a war of words over who was responsible for clearing the camps the situation will be repeated indefinitely if measures are not taken by local authorities to prevent the camps from reappearing we could have avoided waiting for months to find shelter for these people the suggestion I made to the state was to build and reform a Welcome Center which is really the only the only option possible if we want to avoid the roadside camps so I'm waiting for the state to get back to me on that now these migrants are being housed in Bois de Boulogne one of Paris's wealthiest areas the 16th arrondissement it's also home to former President Nicolas Sarkozy PSG sparked a persuit bulk stadium and Roland Garros which is currently hosting tennis stars from across the globe for the French Open some locals aren't over the moon about their new neighbors I think that people here are not very pleased that these people are here because they are afraid afraid that to some some of them must be a very difficult some of them very very nice I'm sure but a really tough part of them may be bad you never know how people can react you can have some people who react very badly and some good you never know thirty's choose not to most hospitable area because it is populated by many old people who are not really open-minded so I think that this area is not the most welcoming we support us we don't see any changes we don't communicate with migrants because we don't see them at all in the area so I guess they live autonomously this is now the 34th time in three years that migrants have been moved in Paris but the problem seems to be cyclic it's never ending authorities are due to continue the clear out of camps that emerged along Paris's canals in the next few days yet with the capital already overflowing and an estimated five hundred and fifty extra migrants arriving every week there seems to be little that the authorities can do to keep a lid on the problem Shahla divinsky RT Paris you
