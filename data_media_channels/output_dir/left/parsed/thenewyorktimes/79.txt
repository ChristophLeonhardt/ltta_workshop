“Hello, and welcome to
‘Internetting After Dark.’
If you don’t know
already, I’m Amanda.”
“I’m Shane.”
“And we are here to give you a
closer look inside the making
of ‘Internetting
With Amanda Hess.’”
“Should we get started?”
“Let’s do it.”
“Let’s do it.”
“So, we just launched
the second season
of ‘Internetting,’ and we
had a big party in New York
to celebrate.”
“We also set up two
anonymous question boxes
so that people who were
attending the event
could ask Amanda
questions. So ...
‘When raccoon
revolution start date?
As specific as
possible, please.'"
“So, we made a video that’s
about cats versus dogs
on the internet,
and them fighting
for dominance over our feeds.
And a lot of the
comments we got
were like asking what all
of these other animals
represent in that ecosystem.
And we heard a lot —
a lot — about
raccoons, which I think
makes sense because they
are right on the border
between like wild animal and
domesticated animal,
because they hang outside
of our houses all the time,
and they like eat our
discarded foods.
And so the idea
of like bringing them
just a step closer like
inside our houses, I think,
is really fascinating.”
“I feel like the
metaphor, though,
of feasting on garbage is
very apropos for how we all
exist on the
internet right now.
So the idea of someone who’s
gleefully consuming trash
is like a really good
survival mechanism.”
“Like maybe we can all
be like the raccoons.”
“As you can imagine,
cats versus dogs
is always a hot-button issue.
Jonathan Evans on YouTube
wrote, ‘Cats will always
eat the face of
their owners first
after food sources deplete.
The face!' I have
a cat named Wanda.
Wanda is also pictured
directly behind us.
I’m well aware that
Wanda would eat my face
if I stop feeding her.
And I think that
that’s her prerogative.
And frankly, after
all she’s given me,
she has every right to.”
“I don’t think we can
air this without getting
a comment from Wanda.”
“Ooh.”
“Hello, Wanda.”
“Hi, Wanda.
O.K., I have a question.
If you were really hungry,
would you eat Shane’s face?”
“I feel like as long as I
keep feeding her, she won’t.”
“We also released
two other videos.
One is about hands, and the
other is about fembots.”
“Bring in the fembots!”
“This one garnered
probably the most response
that we had online.
This is from Monty
Cantsin on YouTube.
‘The male-robot-as-evil-threat
narrative is just as prolific
as the fembot, and to sculpt
your narrative to avoid that
is disingenuous.
Here’s some evil male-bots
since I can back up
my critique off the
top of my head.’”
“That’s actually
a great point.
And I think it’s
really interesting
to actually contrast how we
construct feminine robots
and how we construct
masculine robots.
So if we’re making like techno-women
to be hyper-feminine,
we also seem to be making like
techno-men to be hyper-masculine
and specifically
to be killing machines, which
I think probably
also says something
interesting about how we do
that sometimes to real men,
like particularly during war.
But if you’re
interested in more
about how the internet
is affecting masculinity,
we actually have a video about
that coming out real soon.”
“This is from Rob from Kansas.
‘I was surprised
you did not cover
‘Westworld’s’ strong
female robot AI characters.
I particularly
enjoyed the series
because it confronted
the harsh reality
of the kinds of purposes
the male gaze will have
for robots in the
future, sexual objects
and violent aggression toys.
The female robot
characters surprise us
in their nongender
robot normative agency.’”
“There was one version
of the video where we did
end with this montage
of female robots
rising up and like destroying
their male creators.”
“In pop culture, fembots
have a narrative.
They’re either destroyed
to protect society
from their sexual
danger, or they destroy
to protect themselves.
Hey, Siri, what will we do?”
“Before we go,
Amanda, best thing
you’ve seen on the
internet this week?"
“‘Terrace House’ is
currently airing on Netflix,
Japanese reality show.
It’s like crack.”
“For me, I would
say ‘Defunctland.’
Specifically their episode
about the limousine
ride is incredible.”
“Next week we will
have a new episode
of ‘Internetting’ for you.
This one is about
mysticism on the internet.”
“And if you have any questions
or comments or want to say
anything else about
‘Internetting,' please just
leave a comment right here.”
"‘Internetting With
Amanda Hess’ — after dark.”
