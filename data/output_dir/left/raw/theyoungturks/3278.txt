1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,429
THE HOUSE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:05,560
QUESTIONING JEFF SESSIONS,
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,900
AS PART OF ITS INVESTIGATION
INTO POSSIBLE RUSSIAN MEDDLING

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,870
IN THE ELECTION AND THIS WAS AN
INTERESTING HEARING CONSIDERING

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,189
SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE
NOW KNOW REGARDING SOME

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,430
CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEERS, CAMPAIGN
STAFFERS AND THE

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,010
COMMUNICATIONS THEY HAD WITH THE
RUSSIANS.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,980
SO COURSE THERE IS THE PALM IN A
FOUR ANGLE.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,869
THERE IS THE FACT THAT GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS HAS ADMITTED

10
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:35,630
GUILT ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE
FULL DETAILS OF WHAT HE HAS

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,090
AND HAS NOT ADMITTED TO.

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,800
WHAT IS SESSIONS TAKE ON THIS?

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,910
IS HE CHANGING HIS STORY A
LITTLE BIT FROM PREVIOUS

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,330
HEARINGS IN THE PREVIOUS
TESTIMONY THAT HE HAS GIVEN?

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,610
FIRST, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT
HIS ANSWERS REGARDING

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,280
PAPADOPOULOS AND PAGE CARTER.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,530
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS RECENT
NEWS REPORTS REGARDING MEETINGS

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,760
DURING THE CAMPAIGN ATTENDED BY
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS AND CARTER

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,620
PAGE, AMONG OTHERS.

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,580
FRANKLY, I HAD NO RECOLLECTION
OF THIS MEETING UNTIL I SAW

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,230
THESE NEWS REPORTS.

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,970
I DO NOW RECALL THAT THE MARCH
2016 MEETING AT THE TRUMP

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,640
HOTEL THAT MR.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,760
PAPADOPOULOS
ATTENDED BUT I HAVE NO CLEAR

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,390
RECOLLECTION OF THE DETAILS OF
WHAT HE SAID AT THAT MEETING.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,440
AFTER READING HIS ACCOUNTS AND
TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION,

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,470
I BELIEVE THAT I WANTED TO MAKE
CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,330
AUTHORIZE TO REPRESENT THE
CAMPAIGN WITH THE RUSSIAN

29
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,900
GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER FOREIGN
GOVERNMENT FOR THAT MATTER BUT I

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,590
DID NOT RECALL THIS EVENT WHICH
OCCURRED 18 MONTHS BEFORE MY

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,560
TESTIMONY OF A FEW WEEKS AGO AND
I WOULD GLADLY HAVE REPORTED IT

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,020
HAD I REMEMBERED IT BECAUSE I
PUSH BACK AGAINST HIS SUGGESTION

33
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,700
THAT I THOUGHT MAY HAVE BEEN
IMPROPER.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
AS FOR MR.

35
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,950
PAGE, WHILE I DO
NOT CHALLENGE HIS RECOLLECTION,

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,210
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF HIS PRESENCE
AT A DINNER AT THE CAPITOL HILL

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,820
CLUB OR ANY PASSING CONVERSATION
HE MAY HAVE HAD WITH ME AS

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,979
HE LEFT THE DINNER.

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,180
SO WE JUST SHOWED YOU A SMALL
PORTION OF THE HEARING AND

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,920
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T HAVE
THE TIME TO SIT AND WATCH THE

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,150
FULL HEARING, I CAN SUM IT UP
FOR YOU BY LETTING YOU KNOW THAT

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,110
JEFF SESSIONS RESPONDED TO EVERY
QUESTION PERTAINING TO RUSSIA

43
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,290
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS DID NOT WANT
TO ASK ABOUT RUSSIA, THEY ASKED

44
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,180
ABOUT A VARIETY OF OTHER RANDOM
THINGS WITH I DO NOT RECALL.

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,380
I DO NOT RECALL THAT HE DOES NOT
RECALL ANYTHING.

46
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,110
HE DOESN'T RECALL ANYTHING FROM
A YEAR TO HAVE A GO DRIVE

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,450
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER SIGNIFICANT
THINGS A YEAR AND A HALF

48
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,940
AGO, I MEAN, CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING?

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,400
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS TO ME AND THEN
HE WOULD PRETEND LIKE HE

50
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,910
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND QUESTIONS THAT
WERE INCREDIBLY CLEAR AND

51
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,349
HE DID NOT WANT TO ANSWER THEM.

52
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,180
MAYBE HE IS GOING TO GO WITH
ALZHEIMER'S DEFENSE TOO.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,020
LOOK, COME ON, GUYS.

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,780
GET A LOAD OF THE OBVIOUS ON ITS
FACE ABSURD ARGUMENT THAT

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,880
SESSIONS IS MAKING.

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,959
HE SAYS, I DON'T RECALL HAVING A
CONVERSATION WITH PAPADOPOULOS.

57
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,180
I DID NOT RECALL IT, TELLING HIM
TO NOT PUT US IN TOUCH WITH THE

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,880
RUSSIANS, BUT NOW, I DO RECALL
IT AND I WAS AWESOME AND I TOLD

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,440
HIM DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE THAT
CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIANS.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,590
YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER IT AT ALL
BEFORE.

61
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,921
NOW THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT YOU
WERE IN THE MIDST OF ALL OF

62
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,431
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN TALKING TO

63
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:36,430
THE RUSSIANS, NOW THAT YOU DO
RECALL IT, YOU RECALL IT

64
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,440
WITH GREAT CLARITY AND INFOSYS
AND HOW YOU ALMOST YELLED

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,040
AT HIM TO KNOCK INVOLVED WITH
THE RUSSIANS.

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,680
HE IS A GOOD GUY.

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,970
NOW YOUR MEMORY IS
CRYSTAL-CLEAR, RIGHT?

68
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,970
COME ON.

69
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,070
YOU EITHER REMEMBER
OR YOU DON'T.

70
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,040
WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO IS GET
CREDIT, KNOCK IN TROUBLE

71
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,590
BECAUSE HE LIED ABOUT NOT
REMEMBERING THINGS BECAUSE

72
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,110
HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ALL THE RUSSIAN

73
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,670
CONNECTIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE A
LOT OF THEM, RIGHT?

74
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,010
ANYONE TO GET CREDIT FOR THAT
AND GET CREDIT FOR, I TOLD

75
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,470
HIM NOT TO GO AND I TOLD HIM NOT
TO PUT TRUMP AND PUTIN, HE

76
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,170
COULD GET CREDIT FOR THE SECOND
THING IF HE ADMITTED, I

77
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,810
LIED TO YOU GUYS STOP COURSE
ARMOR THAT CONVERSATION.

78
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,389
I'M THE ONE WHO TOLD HIM TO MAKE
SURE TRUMP AND PUTIN DIDN'T

79
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,389
MEET UP.

80
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,419
HE EXPLAINS WHY IT IS COMMON
FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIM TO NOT

81
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,569
RECALL CERTAIN THINGS.

82
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,710
LET'S LISTEN TO HIS REASONING IN
THE NEXT VIDEO.

83
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,699
MY ANSWERS HAVE NOT CHANGED.

84
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,340
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH,
AND I HAVE ANSWERED EVERY

85
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,279
QUESTION AS I UNDERSTOOD THEM TO
THE BEST

86
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,210
OF MY RECOLLECTION AS I WILL
CONTINUE TO DO TODAY.

87
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,199
ALL YOU HAVE BEEN IN CAMPAIGNS,
LET ME JUST SUGGEST THAT MOST OF

88
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,389
YOU HAVE NOT PARTICIPANT
PARTICIPATED IN A PRESIDENTIAL

89
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:53,669
CAMPAIGN AND NONE OF YOU HAD A
PART IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

90
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,050
IT WAS A BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN, I
THINK, IN MANY WAYS BUT IT WAS A

91
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,110
FORM OF CHAOS EVERY DAY FROM DAY
ONE.

92
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,839
WE TRAVELED, SOMETIMES IT TO
SEVERAL PLACES IN ONE DAY.

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,279
SLEEP WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY AND
I WAS STILL A FULL-TIME

94
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,800
SENATOR WITH A VERY FULL
SCHEDULE.

95
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,509
DURING THIS ERA, I'VE
SPENT CLOSE TO 20

96
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:18,759
HOURS TESTIFYING BEFORE
CONGRESS.

97
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,909
BEFORE TODAY I HAVE BEEN ASKED
TO REMEMBER DETAILS FROM A YEAR

98
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:27,759
AGO SUCH AS WHO I SAW ON WHAT
DAY AND WHAT MEETING AND WHO

99
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,909
SAID WHAT WHEN AND ALL OF MY
TESTIMONY I CAN ONLY DO MY

100
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:37,889
BEST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS
I UNDERSTAND THEM AND TO

101
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,009
THE BEST OF MY MEMORY.

102
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,669
BUT I WILL NOT EXCEPT AND REJECT
ACCUSATIONS THAT I HAVE EVER

103
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,909
LIED.

104
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,720
THAT IS A LIE.

105
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,539
AS I SAID BEFORE, MY STORY HAS
NEVER CHANGED.

106
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,000
I'VE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH AND
I'VE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION TO

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,119
THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION AND
I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY.

108
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:02,069
WE KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE
BECAUSE HE RECUSED YOURSELF

109
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,430
BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD
NEVER MET WITH THE RUSSIANS WHEN

110
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,029
OUT FRANK AND ASKED YOU ABOUT IN
YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARINGS.

111
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:11,969
THEN WE FOUND THAT YOU MET WITH
THE RUSSIAN SEVERAL TIMES.

112
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,279
THEN YOU SAID WELL, WE DIDN'T
TALK ABOUT POLICY, THEN YOU

113
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,500
ADMITTED THAT YOU DID TALKED
ABOUT POLICY AND THEN YOU

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,629
RECUSE YOURSELF.

115
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,949
YOU CLEARLY LIGHT IN THE
BEGINNING ABOUT MEETING

116
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,050
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

117
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,220
NO, HE DIDN'T LIE.

118
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,180
IT'S JUST THAT INITIALLY HE HAD
NO RECOLLECTION.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,629
NOW IT'S JUST, IT'S A
COINCIDENCE THAT I

120
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,050
CONVENIENTLY HAVE NO
RECOLLECTION WHEN IT

121
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,149
DOESN'T SUIT ME TO HAVE ANY
RECOLLECTION.

122
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:35,149
RIGHT?

123
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,860
THAT SOMETHING IS AMAZING.

124
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,509
AND THAT'S A STRATEGY AND IT HAS
WORKED SO FAR.

125
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:41,649
HE JUST SAYS HE DOESN'T
REMEMBER, THEN HE GETS

126
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:45,070
CALLED OUT HE IS LIKE ALL YEAH,
NOW I REMEMBER BUT HEY, I

127
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,710
WAS SO TIRED AND I WAS A
FULL-TIME SENATOR BECAUSE

128
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,089
SENATORS WORK REALLY HARD,
RIGHT?

129
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:51,849
WITH ALL THE STAFFERS THAT
THEY HAVE READING THE

130
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:54,580
LEGISLATION FOR THEM AND
BRIEFING THEM ON THINGS THAT.

131
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,710
THE SENATORS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT
DONE IN THE US LATELY.

132
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,550
TO BE FAIR TO THE REPUBLICANS,
WHEN CLINTON SAID THAT HE

133
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:07,270
WAS ALSO TIRED AND THAT IS WHY
HE LIED OVER UNDER OATH,

134
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,900
THE REPUBLICANS WERE LIKE YOU
ARE RIGHT, YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

135
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,059
SO SESSIONS, IF YOU BELIEVE LIKE
THE REPUBLICANS THAT WHAT

136
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,939
CLINTON DID WAS OUTRAGEOUS,
LYING UNDER OATH ABOUT AN

137
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:18,939
AFFAIR.

138
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,330
THIS IS LYING UNDER OATH ABOUT
THINGS THAT INVOLVE THE

139
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,610
GOVERNMENT AND WORKING WITH A
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO

140
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,149
PERHAPS INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS.

141
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,060
WAY MORE IMPORTANT AND SESSIONS
SHOULD BE GONE.

142
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,219
IF NOT, I AM EXPECTING APOLOGIES
FROM ALL REPUBLICANS WHO

143
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,599
PURSUED IMPEACHMENT BECAUSE NOW
THEY APPARENTLY THINK THAT

144
00:07:38,599 --> 00:00:00,000
PERJURY IS NO BIG DEAL.
