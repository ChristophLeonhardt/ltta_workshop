I think once you venture into tie bars tie pins and lapel pins my main piece of advice is proceed with caution if you're going to wear a tie bar keep it as classic as possible these are just pure silver clean and simple and if you're going to go there I would start here there are as many type-in variations as there are coupling my favorite here is this vintage Jade type in just because it's more almost curiosity than just a jewel another way to go something sort of geometric with a little bit of color that almost blends into the pattern of your tie is a great way to introduce that slight touch of something extra to your look nothing signals someone who's really well-dressed and really put together like a beautiful pair of shirts done you want to think about shirts does that have something unusual maybe they're not gold these actually are mother-of-pearl and gold and these are really pale chalcedony with a small sapphire cabochon if you're at a formal occasion that you're not in a tuff puffins are a really great way to just add that note of consideration a really classic pair of black onyx with a tiny diamond also signals that this was a night you took a little bit of extra care and you put on
