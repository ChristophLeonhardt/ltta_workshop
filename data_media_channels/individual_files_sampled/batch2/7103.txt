THERE ARE SO MANY STORMS BREWING IN THE CARIBBEAN, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DEVASTATION. HURRICANE MARIA WHICH REACHED HURRICANE STATUS WENT BACK TO FOUR, IT IS PICKING UP TO FIVE AGAIN. IT IS WREAKING HAVOC ON THE ISLAND OF DOMINICA, ABOUT 78 OR 80,000 PEOPLE. THESE ISLANDS, LIKE ISLANDS THAT SUFFERED THE SAME FATE, ESPECIALLY BARBUDA, IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN NOW. THE PRIME MINISTER OF DOMINICA SAID AFTER BEING RESCUED FROM HIS HOME ñ THAT IS EVERYTHING. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE THING BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW IF HIS PREMONITIONS CAME THROUGH BECAUSE ALL COMMUNICATION TO THE ISLAND WAS CUT OFF. THEY HAD NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. HERE IN FLORIDA YOU CAN DRIVE TO GEORGIA, INLAND OR DO OTHER THINGS. WHEN YOU'RE ON A SMALL ISLAND THERE IS NO PLACE YOU CAN GO. IT'S EASY, WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE SO MUCH ñ IT IS EASY TO BLAME IT. I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THIS WAS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. YES, OBVIOUSLY IT'S RELATING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. CHANGES IN HER PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE DID NOT CAUSE HURRICANES. EVERYTHING THAT A HURRICANE BRINGS, NO ONE IS SAYING THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES HURRICANES. FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGED, IT WAS NOT ñ WE WOULD HAVE HURRICANES. YEAH, WE ALWAYS HAD HURRICANES. ANYONE WHO USES THAT ARGUMENT IS MISSING THE POINT. IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL THIS AND WE HAVE HURRICANES. IT'S ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE STORMS, THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL, THE RISING SEA LEVELS. AND ALSO THE MOISTURE AND THE HEAT THAT EXACERBATES THE SITUATION. BACK IN THE DAY YOU WOULD HEAR ABOUT STORMS LIKE THIS AND THEY WOULD REFER TO IT AS A ONCE EVERY 500 YEAR STORMS. NOW WE HAVE MAJOR STORMS THAT CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO OUR COUNTRY AS WELL AS OTHERS EVERY YEAR. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE IGNORING IT. WE PULLED OUT OF THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT, THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT. WE ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO COVER OUR BASES IN THE EVENT THAT ALL THE SCIENTISTS ARE RIGHT. EVERY ACTION IT SEEMS WE ARE TAKING IS LEADING US FURTHER AWAY FROM ADMONITIONS INSTEAD OF CLOSER IN LINE WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT DEBATES THIS. ONLY IN AMERICA DO WE DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS HAPPENING. WHY? TO PROTECT THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES. TO PROTECT THE FACT THAT WE ARE PART OF DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE REALLY POWERFUL TO HELP FIX IT. THE STARTING POINT IS ACKNOWLEDGING, AND GETTING BACK INTO THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. ON THE DAY THAT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE UNITED NATIONS THIS WAS NOT A BIG TOPIC THERE. THE CENTRAL CHALLENGE IN GETTING PEOPLE TO AFFECT POLICY THAT ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES IS THAT IT IS A NOT PRESSING THREAT. AT THE KIND OF THING WHERE WHEN YOU HAVE A SCIENTIST SAY HERE ARE MODELS WE PLAYED OVER DOZENS OF YEARS, BUT IS FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. ANYTHING THE PEOPLE WANT TO GET DONE INVOLVES SOME KIND OF PRESSING ISSUE. SUCH AS THIS YEAR WE CAN MAKE THIS MUCH MONEY IF WE OPEN UP THIS FIELD TO BE DRILLED OR FRACKED. THAT IS A PRESSING ISSUE THAT GETS FOLKS MORE EXCITED. NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT ARE MORE INTENSE BECAUSE OF HIGHER SEE TEMPERATURES. THAT IS THE ONE THING THEY TEACH YOU IN WEATHER AND STORMS ABOUT HURRICANES. THEY FEED OFF WARMER WATERS. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN WHERE THE HURRICANE GOES FROM CATEGORY 3 TO 4. IT DOES THAT OVER THE WARM WATERS OF THE GULF, AND IT LOSES POWER OVER THE LAND OR OVER COLDER WATER. THAT IS JUST HOW IT WORKS. IF YOU'RE RAISING THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER, BARRING ANY DRASTIC TEMPERATURE, YOU WILL HAVE A HUGE ASS HURRICANE. EVERYONE IS TRYING TO SHAKE THESE FOLKS AND SAY THIS IS THE DEPRESSING THING THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND FEELS LIKE. THE SEA LEVELS HAVE ALWAYS RISEN, BUT AGAIN PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. IT'S LIKE THE UNITED STATES IS THE CERSEI LANNISTER OF GAME OF THRONES. AND THE WHITE WALKERS ARE COMING, BUT WE ARE IN DENIAL. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING. THIS IS WHERE I PRETEND I KNOW WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT. IT'S LIKE THE WHITE WALKERS ARE CLIMATE CHANGE. I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT IT NOT BEING A PRESSING MATTER FOR MOST AMERICANS WHICH IS WHY I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ARE ABLE TO BRUSH IT UNDER THE RUG. HERE IS ANOTHER THING, THERE IS ANOTHER PRESSING MATTER THAT I THINK TAKES PRIORITY OVER DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE ISSUE OF JOBS. I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A YOUNG GUY ON A PLANE, A LIBERAL GUY WHO IS AN ENGINEER ON AN OIL RIG. POLITICALLY SPEAKING HIS LIBERAL. WHEN IT CAME TO THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE HE ACKNOWLEDGED IT, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT MEANS HE HAS TO GO FIND ANOTHER JOB, AND HE IS IN A CUSHY POSITION WORKING FOR EXXON. WHEN IT COMES TO FEEDING YOUR FAMILY, BUT IS ALWAYS GOING TO TAKE PRIORITY OVER DOING SOMETHING THAT WILL BENEFIT THE PLANET. BUT HERE IS THE THING, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY OR THE COST OF FOOD, OR THE REFUGEE CRISIS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IN THE MIDDLE EAST, ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BECOME EXACERBATED MOVING FORWARD. AND WE SEE IT GET WORSE EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE KNOTS AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN ISSUE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT IT IS A TOMORROW ISSUE. TOMORROW ISSUES DON'T PLAY POLITICALLY. PEOPLE VOTE THEIR POCKETBOOKS AND THINK ABOUT WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL OR JOB IS COMING FROM. EXCEPT NOW IT IS A TODAY ISSUE. THAT IS WHY RUNNING INTO THIS WALL OF ATTITUDES THAT COME FROM THE OTHER PARTY ON THIS, THE PARTY THAT IS STANDING AWAY OF THESE THINGS, AND DONALD TRUMP AND HAS A MINISTRATION OR STANDING IN THE WAY OF THIS, IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT IS A TODAY ISSUE AND IT IS NOT THE SAME TYPE OF THING AS IT USED TO BE.
