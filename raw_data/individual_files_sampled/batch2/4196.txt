this was Donald Trump's worst week as president and no doubt the worst week of his life the second worst thing a businessman or a politician can hear is your accountant has immunity the worst thing is you're under arrest and that is usually the next thing that happens to you when your accountant gets immunity and that's what we discovered today about Donald Trump his accountant has immunity Alain weiselberger was Donald Trump's father's accountant and then Donald Trump's accountant and now has the title of chief financial officer of the Trump Organization Allan Weissenberg knows more about Donald Trump than all of Donald Trump's wives combined and his children Allan Weissenberg knows about every dollar of Donald Trump's income and he knows what Donald Trump has done with every one of those dollars Allan weiselberger knows what has happened to every dollar that has come in to any one of the many Trump businesses Allan Weissenberg knows exactly how much federal tax and state tax those businesses have paid how much federal tax and state tax Donald Trump has paid and how much taxation those companies and Donald Trump have illegally failed to pay if any and now we know at the end of Trump's worst week that Allan Weissenberg has immunity from prosecution in exchange for telling the truth about Donald Trump and his businesses and his illegal payoffs to women during the presidential campaign and who knows what else it was already Trump's worst week before we discovered the president's accountant has immunity Donald Trump has had many bad weeks as president beginning with the first when he was greeted with the most massive worldwide inauguration protests we have ever seen but this was the week that changed everything because this was not just the week when the president's men were being found guilty in federal court and pleading guilty in another federal court and grabbing immunity deals in exchange for telling the FBI everything they know about Donald Trump this was much more importantly impeachment this was the week when everyone began talking about impeachment and when I say everyone I mean everyone from me to Fox News and Donald Trump if the Democrats take back power do you believe they will try to impeach you well you know I guess it's just something like high crimes and all I don't I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's not a great job I'll tell you what if I ever got impeached I think the market would crash I think everybody would be very poor because without this thinking you would see if you would see numbers that you wouldn't believe in reverse the week began with political TVs strangest character saying this in defense of the President of the United States this crowd I don't need to go like I know it isn't truth truth is in truth when Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump the Ghostbusters of political commentary say things like that the world worries the world worries that the minority of American voters who made Donald Trump president are out there obediently nodding their heads and chanting truth isn't truth but they're not not all of them the propaganda isn't working and we discovered that in an extraordinary interview that one enthusiastic Trump supporter gave to Fox News after she voted guilty on all 18 counts against Paul Manafort Paula Duncan says she voted for Donald Trump and she would still vote for Donald Trump again after being firmly convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by Robert Muller's team of prosecutors that Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort was guilty of everything they charged him with she explained that Paul Manafort got a hung jury on some of the counts only because there was one juror who refused to vote guilty on the undecided counts the vote was 11 guilties one not guilty on every one of them that's how close Paul Manafort came to being convicted on all 18 counts the way that Trump supporter Paula Duncan wanted him to be convicted and tonight Paula Duncan is the most important voice standing between President Trump and a pardon for Paul Manafort how would you feel if the president pardoned Paul Manafort I feel it would be a grave mistake for President Trump to pardon Paul Manafort why justice was done the evidence was there and that's where it should stop all Trump has to listen to that a trump voter a strong Trump supporter still who is ready to vote for Donald Trump again is telling the President of the United States not to pardon Paul Manafort because she studied the evidence in the metaphor case and decided Paul Manafort was guilty of everything everything forget what Rudy Giuliani says to the president about pardoning Paul Manafort what Paula Duncan says is much much more powerful the Paula Duncan's of this country are now Donald Trump's worst political nightmare Paula Duncan was supposed to think it was all a witch hunt Paula Duncan was supposed to think Paul Manafort didn't do anything wrong Paula Duncan was supposed to think that truth isn't truth but the brainwashing didn't work Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani pumped all of those messages into the propaganda fog that was supposed to make Trump supporters unable to see the truth it didn't work Paula Duncan took an oath to put aside any sympathies or biases that she might have and evaluate the evidence placed before her and that is exactly what she did and so Donald Trump has to worry tonight how many Paul and Duncan's are there in his loyal base of all those people who say that after all of this they would still vote for Donald Trump again how many of them will change their minds if they are presented with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Donald Trump committed crimes the Paula Duncan's out there have the future of Donald Trump's presidential see in their hands now because if some of them if half of them turn against Donald Trump if they are presented with proof that he committed crimes then Donald Trump will be impeached and he will be removed from office even if Republicans still control the Senate because that would mean that enough Republican voters turned against Donald Trump that's 16 or 17 Republican votes to convict the president in the Senate would be possible impeachment is a quasi legal quasi political process if there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the president committed the crimes then the legal elements of impeachment would be satisfied but the votes on impeachment would still be a political calculation if the Democrats win the House of Representatives as polls indicates they indicate they will then the impeachment process will surely begin with the United States Senate serving as the jury in the trial removing an impeached president from office requires 67 votes in the United States Senate when senators cast those votes in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial they all checked the polling on impeachment in their states every one of them tonight the polls have very bad news for the president 60 percent agree with Trump supporter Paula Duncan that the president should not pardon Paula mana for 62 percent say the president should not pardon Michael Cohen 66 percent think it should be legally permissible for sitting presidents to be formally charged with a crime and here is the most frightening response in this poll released today which included this question should Congress begin impeachment proceedings to remove President Trump from office right now tonight it's a tie 40 to 42 and there is only one direction that that poll question is going to go the more we hear from Michael Kohn and from all of the friends and business associates of Donald Trump who now have immunity the more ready the country will be for impeachment in his column today in the Rupert onde new york post frequent Trump apologist rich Lowry said if it wasn't obvious before it should be now President Trump is in an impeachment fight that won't happen unless Democrats take the house and do so with a healthy margin in the fall but Michael Cohen's statement that he committed campaign finance violations at the behest of Trump makes it that much more likely Democrats will impeach him once they have the power and the votes to do it so long as he has the vast majority of his party with him he has a break against a removal vote in the Senate that's from a conservative Republican writer on the editorial page of Rupert Murdoch's newspaper today the Friday of Trump's worst week impeachment week so long as he has the vast majority of his party with him he has a break against a removal vote in the Senate and that's true and that's why it's all up to Paula Duncan and Trump supporters like Paula Duncan if Donald Trump loses Paula Duncan and supporters like her he will lose his presidency and when Paula Duncan voted guilty on all 18 counts against Paul Manafort and then came out and publicly said she opposes a pardon for Paul Manafort Donald Trump discovered that no he cannot shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it with all of his supporters because Trump supporters like Paula Duncan still no truth is truth thanks for checking out our youtube channel
