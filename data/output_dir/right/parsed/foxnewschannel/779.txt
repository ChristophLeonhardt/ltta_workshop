>> Neil: THEY SAY YOU'RE DEFINED
IN LIFE BUT NOT THINGS THAT GO
WELL BUT THINGS THAT ARE NOT.
THINGS YOU DIDN'T SEE COMING.
FOR CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, IT WAS
A DIVING ACCIDENT.
HE WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD HARVARD
MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENT AND HE
TOLD MY COLLEAGUE, BRET BAIER
THAT HE KNEW THE MOMENT THAT HIS
HEAD HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL
HE WAS PARALYZED FOR LIFE.
YOU KNOW THIS STORY.
SO MANY STORIES TOLD BY SO MANY
THAT KNEW CHARLES FAR BETTER
THAN ME AND WORKED WITH CHARLES
FAR LONGER THAN ME.
SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEIR
MEMORIES.
ALLOW ME NOW TO SPEAK FOR MINE.
FEWER BUT JUST AS POWERFUL.
NOTICE AS PERSONAL BUT FOR ME
VERY PERSONAL.
WHEN IT CAME TO CHARLES, I
WASN'T JUST A VIEWER.
I WAS A VOYEUR.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE WATCH OTHERS DO WHAT THEY DO,
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE GOOD
AT WHAT THEY DO OR SHOULD DO.
CHARLES WAS REALLY GOOD AT WHAT
HE DID.
WHAT AMAZED ME IS HOW HE DID IT.
I MARVELLED AT HIS MANNER.
BUT MORE, I MARVELLED AT HIS
MANNERS.
HE NEVER SCREAMED OR NEVER
YELLED.
HE NEVER IMPUGNED THE INTEGRITY
OF ANYBODY.
JUST A ZEAL THAT IMPRESSED BOTH
SIDES.
HE GOT YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE HE
GOT LIFE.
MAYBE BECAUSE HE GOT THE
FRAGILITY OF LIFE.
IN A WAY MOST CONSERVATIVES
COULD NOT AND CANNOT AND MOST
LIBERALS INSIST THEY ARE BUT ARE
NOT.
THAT WAS THE CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER
THAT I KNEW.
THAT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
THAT WAS INSPIRING ENOUGH FOR
ME.
IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A POINT
WITHOUT MORPHING INTO A SHORT
FEST THAT TURNED POINTLESS.
THAT WAS HIS SECRET.
HE HAD NO SECRET.
THAT WAS HIS GAME.
HE PLAYED NO GAMES.
EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING WHAT
YOU SAW IS WHAT YOU GOT WITH
CHARLES.
A MAN WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH SO
MUCH, BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT
UNLESS YOU ASKED.
HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU MUCH EVEN
IF YOU PUSHED.
IT'S HOW HE HANDSELED THE THINGS
THAT WENT WELL JUST LIKES THE
THINGS THAT DID NOT.
HE WAS DEALING WITH THE CARDS
THAT HE WAS DEALT.
THE MAN THAT REFUSED TO BE
DEFINED BY THE LEGS HE COULDN'T
USE BUT THE REMARKABLE BRAIN
THAT HE DID.
BRIT HUME SAID CHARLES WAS AN
UNLIKELY MEDIA MEGASTAR.
IT'S HIS UNLIKELINESS THAT MADE
HIM A MEDIA MEGASTAR.
HE SPOKE VOLUMES SOMETIMES
WITHOUT SPEAKING MUCH AT ALL.
THE QUIET MAN AT THE TABLE THAT
RULED THE TABLE.
NOW LIKE YOU, ALL I CAN FOCUS ON
IS THE EMPTY SPACE AT THE TABLE
AND THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING.
