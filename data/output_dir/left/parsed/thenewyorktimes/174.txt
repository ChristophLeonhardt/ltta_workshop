Peacocks are the very
definition of showy.
Look at them strut.
But they don't just show their 
feathers to attract females.
They shake them.
It's called train rattling.
The train being that whole
amazing tail.
And the rattling,
you can hear it.
A group of Canadian and
American researchers
wanted to nail down the 
physics of all that shaking.
They shot high-speed 
video of the birds.
And they conducted some 
feather-shaking experiments
of their own.
Here are a few of their 
findings.
The tail feathers vibrate 
at their natural
resonating frequency,
like a guitar string.
The iridescent eyes
stay still while the rest of 
the feathers are shaking.
And males with longer, 
heavier feathers,
don't shake them more
slowly, as you might think,
they shake them faster.
The researchers plan to 
build on this foundation,
learn more about what 
the female sees
and what she hears.
Darwin himself wondered 
about the rattling.
Is it part of the appeal 
or just noise?
