GOING TO BE PRETTY AMAZING. CONGRESSMAN, WE APPRECIATE WE WANT TO BRING IN A FORMER NAVY SEAL AND A COMBAT SWIMMER. WHEN WE STARTED THE MORNING, JAKE, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW HOURS. REPORTS ON-LINE THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BRING THE BOYS OUT NOW, ACTUALLY, TWO BY TWO. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THIS OPERATION? ONE, THEY PROBABLY GOT YOU PUT THE BEST AND THE THEY ARE OVERPERFORMING. ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, I ASKED A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS DONE A LOT OF DIVING IN SOME COMPLEX SITUATIONS WHAT WOULD SCARE HIM THE MOST IN THIS SITUATION, HE SAID VISIBILITY. CAVE WATERS LOOKING MUDDY. YOU HAVE ZERO VISIBILITY ENVIRONMENT, EVEN WITH A GUIDE ROPE, IT IS GOING TO FREAK OUT A KID AND CAUSE PANIC, FULL FACE MASK IS VERY SMART, BUT IF THE WATER BECAUSE THE WATER IS MUDDY, BUT THEN ANYTHING THAT GETS A LITTLE TWISTED OR HUNG UP IS HARD TO UNRAVEL AND NO ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT KID OR OTHER DIVERS. TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE STUCK ON SOMETHING, WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU MANAGE A SITUATION LIKE THAT. SO I MEAN, LET'S JUST BE HONEST, THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE SQUEEZE THROUGH THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY AND MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN. THEY PROBABLY HAVE GUYS THERE TO FACE THE CONTINGENCY; RIGHT? THERE'S A VARIABLE THAT A KID THAT PANICS; RIGHT? YEAH, IF HE PANICS, THEY ARE LITTLE. NOT MUCH THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO. THEY ARE GOING TO GET DRUG OUT, SO, YOU KNOW. YOU ALSO THINK THEY HAVE NOT BEEN EATING MUCH OVER THE LAST TWO TWO WE TWO WEEK TWO WEEKS TWO WEEKS MA TWO WEEKS MALN TWO WEEKS MALNUT TWO WEEKS MALNUTRI TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITI TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITION TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITION. THESE BOYS ARE SMALL TO BEGIN WITH. JAKE, YOU COMPARED THIS CLIMBING TO MOUNT EVEREST. YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND THE SITUATION THEY ARE IN, PLUS THE PRESSURE OF NOT KNOWING HOW YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS THING, IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET OUT ALIVE WITH THESE BOYS WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SWIM, TO CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST WITHOUT DOING ANY TRAINING BEFOREHAND. AS WE ARE WATCHING THIS FOOTAGE AND SEEING THESE PICTURES INSIDE THIS CAVE, WALK OUR VIEWERS THROUGH WHAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING, LIKELY RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT, WITH THESE BOYS. WELL, I MEAN, IT'S LIKE I SAID BEFORE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE STAGES TO THE CLIMB, BUT LET'S BE HONEST, WE'VE GOT SIX OUT. WE'VE GOT SEVEN MORE TO GO OR SIX MORE TO GO. YOU KNOW, GETTING DOWN OFF OF MOUNT EVEREST IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS GETTING UP IT. SO, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE PROBABLY TERRIFIED. YEAH. TWO EXTREMES MORE THAN LIKELY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN A DARK CLOSET, YOU KNOW, IN THE WATER, NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU ARE GOING, NOT KNOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING. THIS POINT. THEY HAVE HAD SOME PRACTICE DIVES IN THE CAVE. YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT AN UNDERSTANDING KIND OF WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT IS GOING TO BE. THE OTHER THING IS THERE'S BREAKS IN BETWEEN WHERE THEY HAVE GOT TO GET OUT AND WALK SO THEY ARE NOT UNDER WATER FOR THAT WHOLE TIME WHICH IS PROBABLY A BREAK FOR THEM. FIRST BIT OF AIR, WHERE THEY GET TO COME UP AND BREATHE, I'M SURE THEY ARE GOING TO BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND BE A LOT BETTER OPTIMISTIC AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS OPERATION, BUT I'M NOTICING REPORTS ON-LINE THAT ONE OF THE FIRST BOYS WHO EMERGED, THERE ARE CONCERNS BELIEVE NINE DAYS AND MORE RECENT DAYS THEY HAVE HAD FOOD, BUT THEY WERE MALNOURISHED AND THAT WAS BEFORE HEADING INTO THE WATT WE ARE THE DIVERS INTO THE WATER WITH THE DIVERS AND EMERGING AFTER 2, 2 1/2 MILES OF A DIVE AND A SWIM. THERE IS AT LEAST ONE BOY THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHERS WHO ARE STILL INSIDE THE CAVE. THERE ARE SOME REPORTS AS WELL THAT THEY MAY HALT OPERATIONS YET, ARE WE? OH, NO WAY, I MEAN WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, THE BIG THING IS ONCE THEY GET THEM OUT, YOU KNOW, THEY MAY HAVE A DECOMPRESSION I HEARD THEY ARE GOING TO BE SOME OF THE PLACES ARE AS DEEP AS 90 FEET. I HIGHLY DOUBT WE WILL LOSE ANYBODY AFTER THEY GET OUT FROM MALNUTRITION. A PERSON CAN GO A MONTH WITHOUT FOOD. THEY MAY BE BEAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. ON THIS ONE, GETTING THEM OUT OF COUPLE OF GRAPHICS THIS MORNING. WE'RE GOING TO PUT ANOTHER ONE SEE IT OR NOT, BUT IT ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITY OF A TANDEM DIVE LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, WE'RE HEARING THAT IT IS BASICALLY TWO DIVERS FOR DIVE LINE THAT THEY ARE HOLDING ON TO, THEY HAVE GOT BOTH TANKS BUT ALSO COMPRESSED AIR BOTTLES. THE CHILD WEARING A FULL FACE DIVER. YOU ARE SAYING LIKELY IF THEY AT THAT INTERSECTION TO USE A FAMILIAR TERM FOR FOLKS SHEPHERDING THE OTHER DIVERS THROUGH AS WELL AS A CHILD SO THAT YOU'RE AGAIN MINIMIZING THEY PROBABLY ALREADY CLEARED THOSE AREAS OUT EVEN MORE, NOTHING'S GOING TO BE SMOOTH. COMMONLY PRACTICED THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH? 100%, RIGHT? THERE TO HELP YOU OUT THROUGH THAT STICKY PLACE. YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST PART OF MISSION PLANNING, OPERATION PLANNING, RIGHT? YEP. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AT ALL THE PLACES WHERE THING CANS GO REALLY WRONG WHERE THINGS DON'T. IN THIS CASE THEY HAVE OVER A THE ODDS OF PROBABILITY OF JAKE, YOU KNOW, YOU THINK ABOUT THESE BOYS AND THEIR COACH WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS CAVE FOR TWO WEEKS NOW. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO HAVE EACH YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH FOOD. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE. BUT TO RELY ON EACH OTHER FOR MORAL SUPPORT, TO HELP EACH OTHER STICK THROUGH IT, TO GIVE EACH OTHER HOPE IN A TIME WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO HAVE EACH OTHER. WELL, I KNOW THIS, YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY THEM IN ABOUT A MONTH FROM NOW BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE FIRED UP TO WIN SOME SOCCER GAMES NOW.
