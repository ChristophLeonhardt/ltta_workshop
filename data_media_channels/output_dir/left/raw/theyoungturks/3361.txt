1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,781
WE ARE THE LONGEST-RUNNING
DAILY STREAM ON THE PLANET, NO

2
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:10,150
ONE HAS BEEN STREAMING DAILY
LONGER THAN WE HAVE COME WE

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,239
STARTED IN 2005, AND WE HAD
DIFFERENT POINTS WHERE WE WERE

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,810
KIND OF AMAZED AT WHAT HAPPENED,
I REMEMBER I WROTE AN ARTICLE IN

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,270
THE HUFFINGTON POST A MILLION
YEARS AGO ABOUT HOW WE CROSSED

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,529
100 MILLION VIEWS, THAT'S HOW
MANY PEOPLE WATCH THE SUPER

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,260
BOWL, I INVENTED A THING CALLED
THE SUPER BOWL STANDARD WHERE IF

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,950
YOU GOT 100 MILLION VIEWS YOU
WERE A LEGIT SHOW.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,180
IN 2010 WE

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,180
CROSSED 300

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,400
MILLION VIEWS, THAT'S THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,110
NOT EVERY VIEW IS A UNIQUE
VIEWER BUT THAT'S STILL A

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,730
LOT OF USE.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,489
GUESS WHAT WE CROSSED TODAY?

15
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,690
>>310 MILLION VIEWS.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,850
>>IT HAS BEEN A SLOW SEVEN
YEARS, THAT'S RIGHT.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,180
>>IT REALLY PEAKED AT THAT POINT
AND WENT DOWN.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:18,159
>>WE PASSED 7.6 BILLION VIEWS,
THAT IS THE WORLD'S POPULATION.

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,160
I THINK IT'S MOMENTOUS AND
IT'S NOT A THING A LOT OF

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,820
CHANNELS OR SHOWS OR NETWORKS
GET, THAT'S A DECENT NUMBER.

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,630
HERE IS A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF
THOSE THRESHOLDS.

22
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:40,300
>>300 MILLION IS A GOOD NUMBER,
WE ARE DOING A PRESS RELEASE AND

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,091
THEY GOT WORKED UP AND I SAID
THAT'S THE SIZE OF THE U.S.

24
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:44,091
POPULATION.

25
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,800
YOU KNOW WHAT OUR
NEXT TARGET IS?

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,240
THE SIZE OF THE

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,520
ENTIRE WORLD.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,470
ON THE ROAD TO 6

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,300
BILLION, ALTHOUGH BY THE TIME WE
HIT IT IT MIGHT BE 7 BILLION.

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:03,390
>>A COUPLE DAYS AGO WE PASSED A
BILLION VIEWS.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,590
>>WHAT THE HELL?

32
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,449
>>2 BILLION VIEWS.

33
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,819
>>THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE.

34
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,920
>>WE JUST CROSSED 5 BILLION.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,290
>>IMAGINE 10
YEARS AGO THINKING ONE DAY --

36
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,220
PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE ARE YOU
NUTS?

37
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,740
>>YOUNG TURKS CROSSES 6 BILLION
VIEWS.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,200
>>THEY SAID YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE
MEDIA, DON'T TRY, HERE WE

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,349
ARE, WE ARE CHANGING THE MEDIA,
THANK YOU.

40
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:42,610
>>THAT IS YOU GUYS, IF YOU
DIDN'T WATCH WE WOULDN'T EXIST.

41
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,690
SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU, AND I
THINK YOU HAVE GIVEN US AN

42
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,209
ABILITY TO SEND THE MESSAGE TO
THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT IS

43
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,790
NEEDED AND THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE WITHOUT YOU GUYS POWERING

44
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,600
THE SHOW, SO I HELL OF A NUMBER
AND I JUST CAN'T THANK YOU

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
ENOUGH.

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
GOD BLESS.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,660
EXCEPT NOW
THE NEW GOAL IS GOING TO HAVE TO

48
00:03:05,660 --> 00:00:00,000
BE THE UNIVERSE.
