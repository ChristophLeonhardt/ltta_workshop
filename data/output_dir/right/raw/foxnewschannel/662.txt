1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:04,221
GOING TO BE PRETTY AMAZING.

2
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:05,188
>> CONGRESSMAN, WE APPRECIATE

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,461
WE WANT TO BRING IN A FORMER

4
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:13,163
NAVY SEAL AND A COMBAT SWIMMER.

5
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:14,932
WHEN WE STARTED THE MORNING,

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,400
JAKE, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW

7
00:00:21,205 --> 00:00:21,505
HOURS.

8
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:26,243
REPORTS ON-LINE THAT THEY ARE

9
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,178
TRYING TO BRING THE BOYS OUT

10
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:29,780
NOW, ACTUALLY, TWO BY TWO.

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:32,182
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

12
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:32,783
THIS OPERATION?

13
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:35,319
>> ONE, THEY PROBABLY GOT

14
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:39,856
YOU PUT THE BEST AND THE

15
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,695
THEY ARE OVERPERFORMING.

16
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:45,329
>> ABSOLUTELY.

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,797
YOU KNOW, I ASKED A FRIEND OF

18
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,465
MINE WHO HAS DONE A LOT OF

19
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,933
DIVING IN SOME COMPLEX

20
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:50,701
SITUATIONS WHAT WOULD SCARE HIM

21
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,603
THE MOST IN THIS SITUATION, HE

22
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:53,103
SAID VISIBILITY.

23
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,771
CAVE WATERS LOOKING MUDDY.

24
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:55,839
YOU HAVE ZERO VISIBILITY

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
ENVIRONMENT, EVEN WITH A GUIDE

26
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,275
ROPE, IT IS GOING TO FREAK OUT A

27
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:00,177
KID AND CAUSE PANIC, FULL FACE

28
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:02,179
MASK IS VERY SMART, BUT IF THE

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,514
WATER -- BECAUSE THE WATER IS

30
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:05,482
MUDDY, BUT THEN ANYTHING THAT

31
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,551
GETS A LITTLE TWISTED OR HUNG UP

32
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,386
IS HARD TO UNRAVEL AND NO

33
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:10,354
ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT

34
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,221
KID OR OTHER DIVERS.

35
00:01:11,222 --> 00:01:13,223
TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

36
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,897
STUCK ON SOMETHING, WALK US

37
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:22,499
THROUGH HOW YOU MANAGE A

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,467
SITUATION LIKE THAT.

39
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:25,502
>> SO I MEAN, LET'S JUST BE

40
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,903
HONEST, THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE

41
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,780
SQUEEZE THROUGH THE NARROW

42
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:37,881
PASSAGEWAY AND MAKE IT ON THEIR

43
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:38,148
OWN.

44
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:39,182
THEY PROBABLY HAVE GUYS THERE TO

45
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,284
FACE THE CONTINGENCY; RIGHT?

46
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:50,661
>> THERE'S A VARIABLE THAT A KID

47
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:51,662
THAT PANICS; RIGHT?

48
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,464
>> YEAH, IF HE PANICS, THEY ARE

49
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:54,798
LITTLE.

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,565
NOT MUCH THEY ARE GOING TO BE

51
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:56,266
ABLE TO DO.

52
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,901
THEY ARE GOING TO GET DRUG OUT,

53
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,670
SO, YOU KNOW.

54
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,704
>> YOU ALSO THINK THEY HAVE NOT

55
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,339
BEEN EATING MUCH OVER THE LAST

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,641
TWO

57
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:04,675
TWO WE

58
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:04,708
TWO WEEK

59
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,209
TWO WEEKS

60
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:06,243
TWO WEEKS MA

61
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:06,276
TWO WEEKS MALN

62
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:06,309
TWO WEEKS MALNUT

63
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,343
TWO WEEKS MALNUTRI

64
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:06,376
TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITI

65
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:06,410
TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITION

66
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:06,743
TWO WEEKS MALNUTRITION.

67
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:09,312
THESE BOYS ARE SMALL TO BEGIN

68
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:10,980
WITH.

69
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:12,382
JAKE, YOU COMPARED THIS CLIMBING

70
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,184
TO MOUNT EVEREST.

71
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,652
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AND THE

72
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:16,586
SITUATION THEY ARE IN, PLUS THE

73
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:17,621
PRESSURE OF NOT KNOWING HOW YOU

74
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:18,622
ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS

75
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,290
THING, IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET

76
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,958
OUT ALIVE WITH THESE BOYS WHO

77
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,561
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SWIM, TO

78
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:25,395
CLIMB MOUNT EVEREST WITHOUT

79
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,697
DOING ANY TRAINING BEFOREHAND.

80
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:27,998
AS WE ARE WATCHING THIS FOOTAGE

81
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,566
AND SEEING THESE PICTURES INSIDE

82
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,368
THIS CAVE, WALK OUR VIEWERS

83
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:32,235
THROUGH WHAT THEY ARE

84
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,804
EXPERIENCING, LIKELY RIGHT AT

85
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:35,906
THIS MOMENT, WITH THESE BOYS.

86
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,808
>> WELL, I MEAN, IT'S LIKE I

87
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:40,477
SAID BEFORE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE

88
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:41,978
STAGES TO THE CLIMB, BUT LET'S

89
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,880
BE HONEST, WE'VE GOT SIX OUT.

90
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,115
WE'VE GOT SEVEN MORE TO GO OR

91
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:45,716
SIX MORE TO GO.

92
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:48,985
YOU KNOW, GETTING DOWN OFF OF

93
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:50,153
MOUNT EVEREST IS JUST AS

94
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:51,988
DANGEROUS AS GETTING UP IT.

95
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,557
SO, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GOING

96
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:54,691
THROUGH RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE

97
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:55,325
PROBABLY TERRIFIED.

98
00:02:55,326 --> 00:02:56,693
>> YEAH.

99
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:00,997
TWO EXTREMES MORE THAN LIKELY

100
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:01,898
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

101
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,936
IN A DARK CLOSET, YOU KNOW, IN

102
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:07,270
THE WATER, NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU

103
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,407
ARE GOING, NOT KNOWING WHAT'S

104
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:10,774
HAPPENING.

105
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:14,478
THIS POINT.

106
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,378
THEY HAVE HAD SOME PRACTICE

107
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:15,912
DIVES IN THE CAVE.

108
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,881
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE GOT AN

109
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:18,682
UNDERSTANDING KIND OF WHAT THEY

110
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,617
ARE GOING TO EXPERIENCE, BUT

111
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,651
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT IS

112
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,986
GOING TO BE.

113
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:25,422
THE OTHER THING IS THERE'S

114
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,857
BREAKS IN BETWEEN WHERE THEY

115
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,859
HAVE GOT TO GET OUT AND WALK SO

116
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,293
THEY ARE NOT UNDER WATER FOR

117
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,128
THAT WHOLE TIME WHICH IS

118
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,329
PROBABLY A BREAK FOR THEM.

119
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,433
FIRST BIT OF AIR, WHERE THEY GET

120
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,935
TO COME UP AND BREATHE, I'M SURE

121
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,103
THEY ARE GOING TO BREATHE A SIGH

122
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,772
OF RELIEF AND BE A LOT BETTER

123
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,208
OPTIMISTIC AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE

124
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:46,409
FUTURE OF THIS OPERATION, BUT

125
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,178
I'M NOTICING REPORTS ON-LINE

126
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,381
THAT ONE OF THE FIRST BOYS WHO

127
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:53,116
EMERGED, THERE ARE CONCERNS

128
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:59,422
BELIEVE NINE DAYS AND MORE

129
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:00,991
RECENT DAYS THEY HAVE HAD FOOD,

130
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:05,195
BUT THEY WERE MALNOURISHED AND

131
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:05,996
THAT WAS BEFORE HEADING INTO THE

132
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,199
WATT WE ARE THE DIVERS -- INTO

133
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,868
THE WATER WITH THE DIVERS AND

134
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,437
EMERGING AFTER 2, 2 1/2 MILES OF

135
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:15,572
A DIVE AND A SWIM.

136
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:16,306
THERE IS AT LEAST ONE BOY THEY

137
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,140
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

138
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:17,908
THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED

139
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,776
ABOUT THE OTHERS WHO ARE STILL

140
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:20,277
INSIDE THE CAVE.

141
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:22,345
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS AS WELL

142
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,480
THAT THEY MAY HALT OPERATIONS

143
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:37,427
YET, ARE WE?

144
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:39,529
>> OH, NO WAY, I MEAN WE HAVE A

145
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,430
LONG WAYS TO GO, YOU KNOW.

146
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,499
I MEAN, THE BIG THING IS ONCE

147
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,134
THEY GET THEM OUT, YOU KNOW,

148
00:04:44,135 --> 00:04:48,872
THEY MAY HAVE A DECOMPRESSION --

149
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,773
I HEARD THEY ARE GOING TO BE --

150
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:52,742
SOME OF THE PLACES ARE AS DEEP

151
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:53,944
AS 90 FEET.

152
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,545
I HIGHLY DOUBT WE WILL LOSE

153
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:59,149
ANYBODY AFTER THEY GET OUT FROM

154
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,583
MALNUTRITION.

155
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,385
A PERSON CAN GO A MONTH WITHOUT

156
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:02,686
FOOD.

157
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,487
THEY MAY BE BEAT DOWN A LITTLE

158
00:05:04,488 --> 00:05:04,821
BIT.

159
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:09,726
ON THIS ONE, GETTING THEM OUT OF

160
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,332
COUPLE OF GRAPHICS THIS MORNING.

161
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,266
WE'RE GOING TO PUT ANOTHER ONE

162
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,603
SEE IT OR NOT, BUT IT

163
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:21,438
ILLUSTRATES THE COMPLEXITY OF A

164
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,439
TANDEM DIVE LIKE THIS.

165
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,107
YOU KNOW, WE'RE HEARING THAT IT

166
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,508
IS BASICALLY TWO DIVERS FOR

167
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:30,914
DIVE LINE THAT THEY ARE HOLDING

168
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,649
ON TO, THEY HAVE GOT BOTH TANKS

169
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,451
BUT ALSO COMPRESSED AIR BOTTLES.

170
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,820
THE CHILD WEARING A FULL FACE

171
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:40,924
DIVER.

172
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,492
YOU ARE SAYING LIKELY IF THEY

173
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:47,597
AT THAT INTERSECTION TO USE A

174
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,132
FAMILIAR TERM FOR FOLKS

175
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:49,933
SHEPHERDING THE OTHER DIVERS

176
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,334
THROUGH AS WELL AS A CHILD SO

177
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,169
THAT YOU'RE AGAIN MINIMIZING

178
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:57,107
THEY PROBABLY ALREADY CLEARED

179
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,508
THOSE AREAS OUT EVEN MORE,

180
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,176
NOTHING'S GOING TO BE SMOOTH.

181
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,983
COMMONLY PRACTICED THAT YOU'RE

182
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:07,817
FAMILIAR WITH?

183
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,219
>> 100%, RIGHT?

184
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,891
THERE TO HELP YOU OUT THROUGH

185
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:15,692
THAT STICKY PLACE.

186
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:18,762
YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST PART OF

187
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:19,696
MISSION PLANNING, OPERATION

188
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:20,797
PLANNING, RIGHT?

189
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:21,765
