one of the big surprises of my research was that those people who are married who were unhappy with her sex life believe it or not it was not about the satisfaction of the sex life it was about frequency versus in frequency so my research showed and this was over 400 married women who reported in that there's a very big difference between the frequency of sex of the happily married woman and the unhappily married woman the unhappily married woman is having sex about three to four times a month the happily married woman 11 times a month so right away we can see that a person who is happily married is engaging in more sex making more time for it so what gets in the way of your sex life think about most married couples statistics tell you that you got about a two-year period where things are gonna be great but once you hit that two-year mark like most things in life we got to start working or else things get stale think about when you are dating when you went out on a date you're probably thinking of interesting topics to share but once we get married what happens it becomes a lot of have twos it's the mortgage payment or the rent it's the kids are vomiting again it's trying to get some sleep for heaven's sake and all of a sudden we start to share our lives mainly about these obligations and that just doesn't lend itself toward the happiness and the love that leads to lovemaking you
