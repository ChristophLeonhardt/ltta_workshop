HOURS AWAY FROM THE START OF
PEACE TALKS.
>> Martha: IT'S REMARKABLE.
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ED HENRY REPORTING FROM
SINGAPORE.
WE HAVE A GREAT PANEL TONIGHT.
LIEUTENANT COLONEL MICHAEL
WATTS, MICHAEL MALICE AUTHOR OF
THE UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF KIM JONG IL.
DAVID MOREY AND MARION MARSH,
FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO
SENATOR JOHN KERRY WHO WENT ON
TO BECOME SECRETARY OF STATE.
WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU, GOOD TO
HAVE YOU HERE TONIGHT.
MICHAEL, LET ME START WITH YOU,
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE
WALKABOUT, THE SELFIES AND THE
NEWS THAT THE DEAR LEADER HAS
ALREADY DECIDED, ACCORDING TO
HIS FOLKS, THAT HE'S GOING TO
LEAVE THIS AFTERNOON, SINGAPORE
TIME?
>> I WILL GO TO MICHAEL.
>> I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY ONE OF
THE THINGS YOU SAID IN YOUR
INTRO.
YEARS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP
TWEETED HE TREATS TO THE HATERS
AND LOSERS, HE DOES SO WITH
AFFECTION.
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THEY WERE
BORN SO  UP.
TO HAVE SOME CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM
THAT THIS CAN GO IN A POSITIVE
DIRECTION IS NOT TOO MUCH TO
ASK.
WE COULD SEE DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS, THE END OF THE KOREAN
WAR, FURTHER TALKS AND A PAUSE
ON THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
MIKE POMPEO HAS CAREFULLY
SHIPPED THE ARGUMENT FROM
DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA TO
DENUCLEARIZING THE WHOLE
PRINCIPLE.
ALREADY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF
AN AGREEMENT.
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF
KIM JONG UN ON WHEN YOU WATCH
THEM WALKING AROUND TAKING THE
SELFIES AND YOU HEAR THAT HE HAS
ALREADY DECIDED THAT HE'S
LEAVING TODAY?
>> THIS COULD BE A FAINT.
THE MEETING WAS CALLED OFF A
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
THEY LIKE PLAYING HARDBALL, THIS
HOLLYWOOD THING, WHO WAS GOING
TO GO TO WHOSE TABLE?
GETTING THEM TO GO TO
NORTH KOREA, A BIG CONCESSION ON
HIS PART IN THE FACT ALSO THAT
THE NORTH KOREAN MEDIA IS
ALREADY REPORTING ON THE STREET
AND WHERE IT'S USUALLY THE
REPORT AFTER THE MEETING HAS
OCCURRED IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IF THEY TELL THAT THEY HAVE
ARTIE MADE SOME AGREEMENT, THERE
WILL BE SOME SUCCESS BY SOME
MEASURE.
>> Martha: ALSO GETS NERVOUS
LEAVING HOME.
THE PEOPLE IN NORTH KOREA JUST
FOUND OUT THIS MORNING AND FACT
THAT THE LEADER OF THEIR COUNTRY
WAS LEAVING AND GOING TO
SINGAPORE.
THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN
VERY AWARE OF THIS.
THE MEDIA IS DIFFERENT THERE AS
WE KNOW.
INTERESTING THAT HE LET GO THREE
OF HIS TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS,
KIM JONG UN, IN RECENT DAYS.
BEGS THE QUESTION, PERHAPS THEY
WERE AGAINST SOME OF THE MOVES
HE'S PLANNING TO UNDERTAKE HERE.
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT
KIM JONG UN HAS A DOMESTIC
AUDIENCE AS WELL, THAT'S NAMELY
THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY, AND
THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM TRULY IS
KIND OF THE HOLY GRAIL OF THE
NORTH KOREAN MILITARY.
TO THAT END, THE REASON THAT WE
ARE SITTING HERE IS PRESIDENT
DONALD J. TRUMP MADE BOTH THE
NORTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE
REALIZE THAT THE USE OF
CREDIBLE -- THE CREDIBLE USE OF
MILITARY FORCE IS ON THE TABLE,
WOULD BE USED AND I THINK IT HAS
CHANGED THEIR CALCULUS.
HERETO FOR THEY HAVE BELIEF THAT
THEY HAD TO HAVE A FULLY
FUNCTIONAL ICBM IN ORDER TO
ENSURE THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL AND
NOW DONALD TRUMP IS MADE THEM
REALIZE THAT, NO, IF YOU GET
THAT ICBM, IT WILL MEAN YOUR
DESTRUCTION, AND I HOPE THAT'S
THE MESSAGE IN THE ONE ON ONE
THAT IS DELIVERED PERFECTLY
CLEAR, THAT IF YOU USE THIS TIME
TO DRAG THINGS OUT WITH THE
INSPECTION REGIME AND THEN BACK
OUT LATER AND DECLARE A NUCLEAR
PROGRAM, THAT IT WILL MEAN THE
DESTRUCTION OF YOUR REGIME.
>> Martha: DAVID, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT SEEMS TO HAVE SUNK
IN WITH KIM JONG UN IS THAT THE
STATUS QUO IS NOT ANY LONGER FOR
HIM.
EITHER HE NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS
MODEL AND OPEN UP HIS ECONOMY
AND AGREE TO SOME SECURITY
ASSURANCES FROM THE
UNITED STATES AND DISMANTLE HIS
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, OR HE'S GOING
TO FACE A MILITARY THREAT FROM
THE UNITED STATES.
THOSE OF THE CHOICES THAT HE HAS
ON THE TABLE.
COMMENT ON THAT AND ALSO ON THIS
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE ENTIRE
PENINSULA THAT SECRETARY OF
STATE POMPEO WAS TALKING ABOUT.
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS RISES ABOVE POLITICS SO I
THINK WE SHOULD STOP TALK ABOUT
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.
DEMOCRATS ARE ROOTING FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THIS ONE.
HE DESERVES CREDIT FOR BEING A
DISRUPTIVE DIPLOMAT, AS JUST
KIM JONG UN.
WE ARE GIVING HIM SOMETHING BY
HAVING THE MEETING.
I DISAGREE WITH SOME OF THE
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION.
THIS IS A REAL WIN FOR
KIM JONG UN, JUST SITTING DOWN
WITH HIM.
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE PAIN
OF THE SANCTIONS OR IF HE HAS
JUST GOTTEN TO THIS POINT WITH
NUCLEAR WEAPONRY WHERE HE NOW IS
SATIATED AND HE WANTS TO MOVE
AND TURN THE COUNTRY TO ECONOMIC
PROSPERITY.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A KEY ISSUE.
THE QUESTION YOU RAISE IS WHAT
DOES DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN, AND
THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE
PROCESS THAT FOLLOWS THESE
MEETINGS, WHICH I THINK WILL GO
WELL.
THAT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE
PACE AT WHICH WE NEGOTIATE THIS.
THERE'S MAYBE 300 STEPS.
THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THE IRANIAN DEAL, AND
FINALLY WHAT PRICE IS INVOLVED
AND STORMED THE MIC IN TERMS OF
ECONOMICS INCENTIVES HERE.
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENT HAS
SAID IT'S A ONE-SHOT DEAL SO
HE'S DEFINITELY PUTTING THE
PRESSURE ON KIM JONG UN ON TO
USE THIS MOMENT PRODUCTIVELY AND
FOR BOTH SIDES TO WALK OUT
FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE GOTTEN
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS MEETING.
LET ME BRING IN MARION MARSH,
TALKING ABOUT POLITICS.
THIS IS A LITTLE MONTAGE FROM
SOME OF THE COVERAGE TODAY
BEFORE THESE MEETINGS EVEN
BEGAN.
WATCH THIS.
>> THE REST OF THE WORLD IS
LOOKING AT THIS AND THINKING TO
THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
DOING?
>> FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PLACE
ALL HIS EGGS IN THE DICTATOR
BASKET SEEMS LUDICROUS AT BEST.
>> WE ARE MAKING NONSENSICAL
COMMENTS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO
KNOW IN THE FIRST MINUTE WHETHER
OR NOT THEY WILL DO NUCEARIZED.
>> THE PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES A
BIT OF HIMSELF AND KIM.
THERE'S A LOT OF SIMILARITIES.
>> HE'S NOT GOING TO COME HOME
AND SAY THAT HE'S FAILED.
HE'S GOING TO CALL THIS A WIN NO
MATTER WHAT.
>> Martha: A LOT OF ARMCHAIR
PSYCHOLOGY GOING ON THERE.
THEY SEEM TO BE DEEP INTO THE
MIND OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HE'S THINKING OF
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO HERE.
>> IT WAS WIDELY REPORTED THAT
THERE WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL
BRIEFED ON THE ON CAM FORKS TO
PREPARE ON THIS MEETING.
>> Martha: DID THAT WOULD NOT
MAKE SENSE?
>> OF COURSE IT DOES FOR
PREPARATION, BUT THE FACT IS NO
MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT, AND
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
NEXT FEW HOURS, THIS IS A WIN
FOR KIM.
HE'S GETTING MUCH DESIRED
ATTENTION.
THE AIR OF LEGITIMACY CONFERRED
UPON HIM BY THIS MEETING.
THE HANDSHAKE WE WILL INEVITABLY
SEE HOURS FROM NOW, YET HE HAS
DONE NOTHING, MAYBE LITTLE, IF
NOTHING TO EARN IT.
HE HASN'T AGREE TO ANYTHING YET.
>> Martha: LAST SUMMER AS AT
HER AND REPORTED OUT IN HIS
REPORT WE WERE LOOKING AT A
SITUATION WHERE THERE WERE
MISSILE TESTS GOING OFF PRETTY
MUCH EVERY SIX WEEKS AND PEOPLE
WERE CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THEM
MIGHT MISTAKENLY LAND IN THE
MIDDLE OF JAPAN IF IT WERE
MISFIRED.
WE'VE ALSO GOT HOSTAGES BACK.
TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT
IS GROWTH ALONG THE SPECTRUM
JUST BASED ON THE FACTS SEEMS
UNTRUE.
>> THERE ARE A FEW POINTS HERE.
THE FACT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THIS, TRUMP HAS GONE FROM
DEMANDING DENUCLEARIZATION OF
NORTH KOREA TO A PROCESS THAT
THEY WILL NEGOTIATE OF THE
KOREAN PENINSULA, WHICH OTHERS
HERE HAVE AGREED UPON AND BEEN
REPORTED.
OTTO WARMBIER, YES, RETURNED
HOME I BELIEVE ONE YEAR AGO
TODAY, YET NOTHING -- AT THE
HANDS OF NORTH KOREANS, WHO HAD
HIM AND HE RETURN HOME BLIND,
DEAF AND HOWLING ONLY TO DIE A
WEEK LATER.
>> Martha: PRESIDENT OBAMA ON
THE WAY OUT THE DOOR SAID TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP NORTH KOREA IS
YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM, BY THE
WAY, SEE YOU LATER.
>> THAT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY
THING HE SAID TO HIM AND I DO
THINK THE PRESENCE OF TWO PEOPLE
PLAY IT LARGER TO ME.
BARACK OBAMA, TRUMP IS OBSESSED
WITH DOING BARACK OBAMA'S LEGACY
AND EVERYTHING HE'S DONE AND I
THINK YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO
SHOW TO HIM, I GOT THIS MEETING,
WE ARE GOING TO GET SOMETHING
DONE, HERE'S ONE MORE THING I'VE
BEAT YOU AT.
XI JINPING IS THE POWER BROKER
IN THIS AREA.
IF NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT HIM,
ESPECIALLY IN NORTH KOREA AND I
THINK XI JINPING HAS A LOT TO
SAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS
NEGOTIATION MORE THAN JUST
FLYING HIM TO GET TO THIS
MEETING AND TO MAKE SURE HE HAS
PROPPED UP THIS REGIME, HIS
FATHER BEFORE HIM AND PROVIDE
HIM WITH FOOD AND ENERGY THEY DO
HAVE.
