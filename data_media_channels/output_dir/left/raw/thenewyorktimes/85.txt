1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
MoviePass is a ticket
subscription service

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,830
for movie theaters.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,320
You pay one fee a month —
$10 right at the moment,

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,060
although that’s changing —
and you can see a movie a day.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,490
August of last year,
they decided

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,740
that they would
drastically reduce prices

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,230
to boost
membership drastically.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,126
It became too popular
too quickly,

9
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:22,500
and so they haven’t
had the money

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,590
to pay for all
of those tickets.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,000
Their concept was that more
people would pay than go.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,030
They say that they’re
profitable on about 88 percent

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,160
of their customers.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,000
The problem though,
are that they have some very

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,760
rabid moviegoers.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,010
In New York, let’s say,
a ticket costs $16.

17
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,380
I go to a movie every day
and I’m only paying $10.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,550
Yet MoviePass is
paying full price

19
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,760
for all of those tickets
to the theater owners.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,310
You can see why their
bank account is just

21
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,040
going down, down, down.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,120
The C.E.O. told me in
April, “We wanted

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,190
to get too big to ignore,”

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,700
so they could force
discounts from theater owners

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,050
and say, “Hey, we have all this
data on who’s going to movies.

26
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,630
Pay us for
that information —

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,505
we’ll give it to you.”

28
00:01:08,505 --> 00:01:10,140
But studios are
terrified that people

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,590
will come to expect
$10 a month

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,350
movie-a-day experience.

31
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,050
There’s has been a bit
of old-fashioned hubris.

32
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,570
Just moving too
fast, too quickly.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,220
“MoviePass is dying.”

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,740
“MoviePass,
the dream is over.”

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,410
“How am I going
to keep this up?”

36
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,440
They weren't
capitalized enough

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,680
to make their
plans work out.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,494
But more people are
going to movies,

39
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:37,410
especially if there’s a
movie that they’re not

40
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,140
quite sure that it’s going
to make sense for them.

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,730
It takes out the risk
and for indie movies

42
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,810
and arthouse movies

43
00:01:43,810 --> 00:00:00,000
they’ve seen a
big bump from MoviePass.
