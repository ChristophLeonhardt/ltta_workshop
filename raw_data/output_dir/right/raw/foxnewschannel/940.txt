HE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT.

148
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:45,425
HE SHOULD TURN OVER THE

150
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,794
HE SHOULD BE COOPERATIVE AND

00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,999

161
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:08,214
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:56,396
THREATS TO SUBPOENA.

191
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,798
OF COURSE IT ALL COMES IN THE

192
00:05:58,798 --> 00:05:59,799
SHADOW OF THE RAMPANT

193
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:00,700
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE THAT WE

194
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,235
KNOW HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH THE

195
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:04,604
DOJ NOT WILLING TO HAND OVER

196
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,205
DOCUMENTS.

197
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:07,607
INCLUDING SPECIFIC OHIO'S FROM

198
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,142
THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE

199
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:10,376
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES OVER

200
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:11,711
DOCUMENTS SURROUNDING THE FBI'S

201
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,514
USE OF INFORMANTS IN THE TRUMP

202
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:15,214
CAMPAIGN.

203
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,015
NUNES SET A DEADLINE FOR

204
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,049
YESTERDAY.

205
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:23,456
THE DOJ IGNORED IT.

206
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:26,259
ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHAT ARE YOU

207
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:26,592
HIDING?

208
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:28,461
WHY ARE YOU OBSTRUCTING,

209
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,429
INTIMIDATING, THREATENING,

210
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,363
HARASSING CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS

211
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,831
AND THEIR STAFF?

212
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,598
IT IS TIME FOR ROD ROSENSTEIN TO

213
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:37,236
STEP ASIDE OR BE FIRED BECAUSE

214
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,204
IF THIS IS AN ATTEMPT AT

215
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,406
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, WHY

216
00:06:40,406 --> 00:06:42,608
WON'T YOU LET CONGRESS DO THEIR

217
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,209
JOB?

218
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,711
ACCORDING TO NEW POLITICAL POLL

219
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,947
NUMBERS, MUELLER'S PUBLIC IMAGE,

220
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:48,815
ROD ROSENSTEIN APPOINTED

221
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:51,050
MUELLER, AT AN ALL-TIME LOW.

222
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,819
PEOPLE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.

223
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,455
EAP REPORTING MUELLER STEAM IS

224
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:56,622
"WORRIED THAT RUSSIAN

225
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:59,025
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES WILL USE A

226
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,560
CRIMINAL CASE IN WASHINGTON TO

227
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,830
GATHER ABOUT ITS INVESTIGATION

228
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,097
AND U.S. INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

229
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:05,465
METHODS."

230
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:06,399
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THAT.

231
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,469
THEY NEVER SHOULD'VE FILED THOSE

232
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,037
TONIGHT, I HOPE YOU CAN STOMACH

233
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:11,804
THIS.

234
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,340
YOU ARE MAINSTREAM, CORRUPT

235
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,108
MEDIA, THE DESTROY TRUMP MEDIA

236
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:17,410
HAS REACHED A NEW LOW.

237
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,344
DESPITE SO MUCH SUCCESS AT HOME

238
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:21,781
ON THE ECONOMY AND ABROAD, NOT

239
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:24,417
INCLUDING THIS WEEK HERE IN

240
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,319
SINGAPORE, THE PRESIDENT HAS

241
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,820
BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY PORTRAYED

242
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,821
NEGATIVELY IN THE PRESS.

243
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,623
EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT IS

244
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:31,057
FIGHTING BACK.

245
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:34,026
HE TWEETED:

246
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:34,760
"SO FUNNY TO WATCH THE

247
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,394
FAKE NEWS, ESPECIALLY NBC

248
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:35,862
AND CNN.

249
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:36,562
THEY ARE FIGHTING HARD TO

250
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:37,463
DOWNPLAY THE DEAL WITH NORTH

251
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,264
KOREA.

252
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,031
500 DAYS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE

253
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,033
"BEGGED" FOR THIS DEAL.

254
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,335
LOOKED LIKE WAR WOULD BREAK OUT.

255
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,904
OUR COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ENEMY

256
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,572
IS THE FAKE NEWS SO EASILY

257
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:52,411
PROMULGATED BY FOOLS!"

258
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,213
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT, AND

259
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:55,581
HERE'S ALL THE PROOF YOU WILL

260
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,015
EVER NEED.

261
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,617
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP.

262
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:58,384
THEY CALL THEMSELVES NEWSPEOPLE.

263
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:01,020
IT'S PATHETIC.

264
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,955
A BUNCH OF LAZY, OVERPAID

265
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,624
SO-CALLED COLLEAGUES, AND THEY

266
00:08:04,624 --> 00:08:06,192
HAVE A RADICAL LEFT-WING AGENDA.

267
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:07,393
IT'S OBVIOUS.

268
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:08,427
TAKE A LOOK.

269
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,463
>> USUALLY WHEN TRUMP SIGNS AN

270
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:12,398
AGREEMENT WITH A FOREIGNER, IT'S

271
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:13,266
A PRENUP.

272
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,200
>> ALMOST CAVEMAN LIKE.

273
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,970
IT REALLY IS.

274
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:19,605
COUNTRY.

275
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,007
WRITING THINGS ON STONE, NOT

276
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,508
EVEN ABLE TO DO THAT.

277
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:24,577
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

278
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:25,878
KIM JONG UN IS ABSOLUTELY

279
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:35,288
INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

280
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:35,587
YEAH.

281
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:36,255
UNLESS OF COURSE KIM JONG UN

282
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:36,956
WINS THE SUPER BOWL OR THE NBA

283
00:08:36,956 --> 00:08:37,390
CHAMPIONSHIP.

284
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:37,924
>> WHY THE PRAISES?

285
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:42,260
WE ALL TALK ABOUT A CASE LIKE

286
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,600
THAT, THE LANGUAGE.

287
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,402
IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THE WAY HE

288
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:50,202
TALKS.

289
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,604
THIS GUY IS A KILLER.

290
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,105
>> A LOT OF THE REASON WE WERE

291
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:55,007
ON THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR, TO

292
00:08:55,007 --> 00:09:01,213
BE SURE, THE NEW -- NUCLEAR

293
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,949
TESTS AND THE RECKLESS AND

294
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:03,649
IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC FROM

295
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,317
DONALD TRUMP RATCHETING UP

296
00:09:04,317 --> 00:09:05,418
TENSIONS.

297
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:06,819
THIS IS THE ARSONIST GETTING

298
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,254
CREDIT FOR PUTTING OUT THE FIRE.

299
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,555
>> TO BELIEVE KIM JONG UN IS

300
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:10,856
GOING TO GIVE AWAY HIS NUCLEAR

301
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:11,757
ARSENAL WHICH REALLY GIVES THE

302
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:18,831
POWER, I THINK WE WENT TOO FAR.

303
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,434
>> JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING HASN'T

304
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,635
HAPPENED BEFORE DOESN'T MEAN

305
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:23,803
IT'S HISTORIC.

306
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:24,403
THAT'S ONE THING.

307
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,805
I THINK WHEN YOU CALL SOMETHING

308
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:28,407
HISTORIC, IT MEANS IT HAS A GOOD

309
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:30,409
CHANCE OF HAVING LASTING

310
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,010
IMPLICATIONS.

311
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,678
I THINK IT'S VERY UNCLEAR, AT

312
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:34,814
LEAST TO MY LAYMAN'S EYE, THAT

313
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,282
THIS DOES THAT.

314
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,650
>> ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENT COULD

315
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,186
HAVE EASILY HAD A SUMMIT WITH

316
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:40,853
ANY PREVIOUS LEADER WITH

317
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:41,654
NORTH KOREA BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

318
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:45,057
VERY EAGER TO BE LEGITIMATED BY

319
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:46,125
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

320
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:46,559
UNITED STATES.

321
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,560
DONALD TRUMP IS THE FIRST ONE TO

322
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,030
AGREE TO DO THAT.

323
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,800
>> Sean: MEANWHILE, OVER AT

324
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,835
MSNBC, THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS

325
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:58,237
CHOICE AND CABLE NEWS, YOU HAVE

326
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:01,607
LIBERAL MORNING HOST, JOE

327
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:02,208
SCARBOROUGH, TRASHING

328
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,643
REPUBLICANS WHO SUPPORT THE

329
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:04,377
REPUBLICAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

330
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:04,744
SHOCKING.

331
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,812
TAKE A LOOK.

332
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,315
>> IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAVE

333
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:23,462
DEVOLVED INTO A TRUMPIST CULT.

334
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,196
>> IT IS A CULT OF PERSONALITY.

335
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,432
THAT'S A GOOD DESCRIPTION.

336
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,034
>> Sean: THE ONLY CULT OF THE

337
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:29,435
PEOPLE WHO WATCH THAT RIDICULOUS

338
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,404
MORNING SHOW OF YOURS.

339
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:32,238
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

340
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:33,005
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES.

341
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:36,008
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL

342
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:36,942
HIS AGENDA BECOMES OR HOW MUCH

343
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,245
THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOU, THE

344
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,147
AMERICAN PEOPLE, FORGOTTEN MEN

345
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:41,814
AND WOMEN, BECOMES.

346
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:45,484
THE MEDIA IN THIS COUNTRY IS

347
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,752
BLINDED BY PATHOLOGICAL HATRED

348
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:49,021
OF THIS PRESIDENT, SO MUCH SO

349
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,424
THAT IT'S NOW OUTWEIGHING THEIR

350
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,559
DESIRE EVEN FOR A ROBUST ECONOMY

351
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,193
AND PEACE IN THE WORLD.

352
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,495
THIS IS SICK.

353
00:10:56,495 --> 00:00:00,000
THE RESIDENT IS ACTIVELY,
