in the province of Ontario in Canada that's our largest province by population there's been a recent debate about sex ed curriculum because the sex ed curriculum was written under the Deputy Minister who is a convicted of child pornography and pedophilia and so it's an extreme sex add and and you may be thinking what's this got to do with guns well it's it's there's an objection to it because of how early it sexualizes kids for example teachers grade school kids that there are six genders now under you're pretty smart guy but I bet that even you could not name the six genders and the objection well I haven't met the other four I've never met anyone who knows all six by the way but I guess I should talk to grade schoolers because they're learning it my point is the big debate over sex ed is you're displacing parents you're voicing this on kids with other parents these are young children of tender years and you're taking advantage of them you're you you use the phrase child abuse you're you're ideologically forming them instead of teaching them you know reading riting and rithmetic in the case of ontario sex ed they're teaching them six genders and that whole ideology I think that's what's going on here and they don't give a damn about parents to heck with parents and what they what their views are about the Constitution or guns these teachers unions and the teachers administrations are looking at students not as customers to be educated but as hostages is the wrong word but people who are trapped and forced to go through an indoctrination for 18 years said I think there's an analogy there I don't know if I put it very clearly though well I think that you know when you look back you look at the way the culture makes fun of conservatives for being in favor of the family oh we want everything to be in 1950s sitcom you know we want everything to be fathers knows best conservatives have not been very good at making the argument which is that the family is the building block of freedom when you have a family it is a self-governing unit that teaches children you know a value system that they can then take out and compare to the value system of the world the left hates that the left is it is not just they're not they they want to get rid of families you know families are not good for the left because families foster freedom families foster a culture that is individualized and says you know here is what we as a family think is good here is what we as a family think is right now go into the world and compare that to what the world is selling you and see which one you know is the right idea what the left always wants to do is supersede that you're not smart enough to educate your own children you're not good enough to educate your own children you're too selfish you're too mean you're too bigoted to educate your own children so we will do it for you what on earth are they teaching kids about sex for again the questions I want to know is can they read can they do math I mean here in California we have we spend more on schools than just about anybody else we have some of the worst schools in the country because they are teaching this agenda this left-wing agenda to supersede the family instead of teaching the kids the skills they need to get along and it's purposeful its purposeful they always make fun of our love of the family and our defense of the family because they think it makes us square but really what they are doing is assaulting the family because the family makes us free
