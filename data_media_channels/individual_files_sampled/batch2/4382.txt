I'm till my Rob Reiner actor and director of shock-and-awe Dahlia with wick who's a senior editor and legal correspondent for Slate and career on Pierre's senior advisor for moveon.org Rob thank you for joining us I have this another layer of concern here this Supreme Court when it's full up with nine justices will decide the fate very well of this president we've got a special counsel loaded for bear all kinds of issues obstruction of justice and possible collusion with the Russians and how that what materials and what testimonies have to be accepted whether he has to testify or not and they're gonna let him pick one of the people to decide his own fate that's the biggest problem I don't think we should get hung up on the egregious effects of what Mitch McConnell did to Barack Obama and a tit-for-tat kind of thing we have a President of the United States that right now is under investigation for possibly conspiring with a firing foreign enemy power to disrupt our democracy and steal an election I don't think we want as Americans to allow somebody who is possibly colluding with a foreign enemy to making choices that are going to affect our lives for the next 3040 years that's the issue and make no mistake about it we we cannot allow this we have to see what happens with the Muller investigation whether or not a donald trump is guilty or not guilty of major major crimes and if he is he should not be allowed to pick the next Supreme Court justice knowing the question there it seems to me as a matter of timing do they have the vote after the election or after this mower has made his call and the court decisions have been made you know it seems to me you could also think about getting Kennedy to stick around for a while and serve a few more months it wouldn't kill him serve a few more months while we do have a full court we're not having to put Trump's take in there to decide Trump's future I don't think there's any chance of Kennedy sticking around I think he quite deliberately chose that July date that's when he's out I do think it leaves the rest of us confounded by this problem of are we gonna really let Donald Trump vet somebody cross-examine somebody set out litmus tests he's already told us he has a litmus test around row litmus tests and do the kind of thing we know he's done too Jeff Sessions and Jim Comey and asked for pledges of loyalty and while I'd like to believe that no nominee is going to pledge that loyalty it just seems to me unbelievably problematic that the president is going to pick a judge who will as you just heard very likely sit in judgment over some piece of what Muller produces whether it's kind of present pardoned himself can a president get a sitting president be indicted all of that could very very likely come before the court so it's a very odd thing that Trump is in the business of vetting that person right now karinna people are going to have to fight this nomination you'll be the Democratic leaders they've got to get out there make this case where they don't have parliamentary tricks or whatever up their sleeve they got to slow this thing down to the voters get to talk first I think your thought I don't know that's exactly right I think that they think they can't play nice there is no play nice here everything is at stake fundamental rights are at stake here when you talk about affirmative action abortion we talk about environmental issues right LLG btq issues everything is at stake and it's true the one thing that is also very scary this is like the worst case scenario here Chris because the other thing too is with Russia with a Russian investigation he could be buying himself a get-out-of-jail-free card with this pick he this is someone who doesn't believe in the rule of law he thinks he's above the law and even during the Nixon times though the Supreme Court had to jump in in Watergate so there's a lot here at risk and we have to we have to make sure that the Senators Democratic senators and on the inside match the intensity on the outside that they're gonna see from activists from from voters for Americans Rob I know you care about these social issues and individual rights issues like choice but I think this Supreme Court is by five to four has shown it's amazing brazenness it picked the president w who took us to Warren about your movie shocked at all that's very relevant it took us to war with a president who was the only president I can imagine this planet who would have taken us into that war they picked them the Supreme Court then they decide they're gonna let unlimited money play a role the United States political elections with their citizens united and no check on the power of people to buy guns no no limit it used to be something to do with founding a militia they dropped all that language this court is unbounded in its power and it's not just as socialist as we fight about like abortion and marriage equality it's everything right political and wherever you come down on any of these issues I would hope that as an American you don't want a potential criminal choosing one of our Supreme Court justices that's what it comes down to I mean I don't care whether you're pro-life or pro-choice I happen to be you know pro-choice and I happen to be in favor of gay rights and civil rights and and workers rights and all those things and those things are in jeopardy but whatever wherever you come down ideologically we can all agree that we shouldn't have a potential criminal choosing our next Supreme Court justice so let's talk numbers we often go to election time but now we have to look at it again there's 50 Republicans in the Senate there's 51 at John McCain could get back in vote although his vote would be up in the air I think even on this one and we have 49 Democrats it couldn't be closer Democrats are also looking of course to try to get to moderate Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski both women of Alaska as allies in stopping a Trump supreme court pick well today Senator Collins was asked what she would expect from any possible nominee nominee have to commit to you that he or she would uphold the precedent of Roe vs. Wade in order to get your support I always have a thorough interview with judicial nominees for the Supreme Court for circuit courts and one of the questions that I always ask is do they respect precedent from my perspective roe v wade is an important precedent and it is settled law well Senator Murkowski of Murkowski of Alaska didn't explicitly address the issue but send a statement my standards for Supreme Court nominees are extremely high it is my long-standing practice to carefully scrutinize the qualifications of judicial nominees had to cast an independent vote let me go to Dalia and then impact everybody else you know I've had experience with Trump on this dial yeah I asked him what a woman should be punished he said there needs to be some form of punishment now that's a weird answer I have no idea who's talking about was he talking about imprisonment he said Oh about fighting or some new form of punishment I don't know what he's talking about but that's what he talks like he also talked in the ward in the Wilding incident where those kids were accused of murder in Central Park he said we gotta execute kids who were in their sub teens basically so we know his views are harsh and they're not about individual rights or the rights of a defendant earlier young people so if he picked somebody like himself man or woman it's pretty scary he's rosy picks a trump and in that person is thinking so how can you count on him picking a Justice Kennedy in a million years just a thought well I think Chris on the issue of roe v wade he's promised us he ran on the overt promise for the first time in history I will have a litmus test here are 25 people each of them will pledge to overturn Roe so this is not in dispute he's pledged it but I would go further and say be really careful about fetishizing the language of what you heard Susan Collins say was as long as it's good precedent and that person promises it's good precedent I'm gonna be okay you can do away with roe v wade you can hollow it out from the center it's been happening in the states for years now without explicitly overturning it so to fetishize the language of will this person or will they not overturn Roe is to really miss the big game are they going to hollow out the core of room when they're gonna get rid of undue burden are they gonna say there can be a burden you have to go to a hospital all these things they've come up with in Texas to make it more difficult for a person living in a row setting to have that choice yeah I mean look the the list that he's been talking about the 25 list that the federal list lists the outside conservative group everybody on that list is to the to the far right of Kennedy he's not going to replace Kennedy so we we have to understand we can't be fooled here whoever he picks is going to try and get rid of Roe vs. Wade I mean I was once there and he wants that that's like that's who he wants so that's what's gonna happen the person that gets Bick is going to cement all of Donald Trump's horrible policies I want to go back to Robin that Rob I don't I've ever talked to you about this but what are you taking with the fact he said to me there needs to be in his interesting language that was creepy language there needs to be some form of punishment for the one I asked about it you mean for the woman he said yes the woman he thought about it yes and then he's some form of punishment that's sort of a biblical answer you were the only one to be able to to nail him down on that and get his true answer to that and and I put it to people that the pro the pro-life people think of abortion as murder they say it they said it over and over well what is the punishment for murder it's either life imprisonment or the death penalty so what are we talking about here are we saying that the woman and the doctor both have to be put in jail for the rest of their lives or executed I mean what are we talking about this is this is crazy this is absolutely crazy and and and and you there's so much more is gonna be at stake than just the abortion rights although that's gonna be front and center but how do you how do you adjudicate that anyway I saw your movie shocked you know I got an advance view of movie I think it's very amazed from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want
