WE ARE LIVE FROM SINGAPORE WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
BECOME THE FIRST AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH A 
DICTATOR OF NORTH KOREA.
IT IS A MOMENT RICH WITH 
OPPORTUNITY AND RISK.
SUCCESS HERE COULD REDUCE THE 
RISK OF NUCLEAR WAR, USHER IN A 
NEW ERA OF PEACE.
MILITARY ACTION, CATASTROPHIC 
CONFLICT WITH U.S. TROOPS RIGHT 
ON THE FRONT LINE.
THAT IS WHERE DELEGATIONS.
SUPPOSED TO LAST MOST OF THE 
DAY, BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
KIM EXPECTED TO LEAVE SINGAPORE 
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY RIGHT 
NOW.
JONATHAN KARL IS WITH OUR WHITE 
HOUSE DELEGATION.
JON, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 
KNOW IN THE FIRST MINUTE WHETHER
HE CAN WORK WITH KIM.
>> Reporter: HE ALSO SAYS HE HAS
BEEN PREPARING, GEORGE, HIS 
WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT.
BUT THIS HAS BEEN A PROCESS.
THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN 
DRIVEN BY THE PRESIDENT, BY A 
PRESIDENT ACTING ON HIS OWN 
INSTINCT AND OWN COUNSEL.
A PRESIDENT WHO ACCEPTED THIS 
INVITATION FROM KIM JONG-UN IN 
AN INSTANT.
AND THAT COUNSEL, HIS OWN 
COUNSEL, WILL BE DRIVING THIS 
MOMENT TODAY AS YOU POINT OUT, 
GEORGE, THE FIRST MEETING, 
EXTRAORDINARY IN SO MANY WAYS, 
INCLUDING THE FACT IT WILL JUST 
BE THOSE TWO MEN, KIM JONG-UN, 
DONALD TRUMP AND THE 
TRANSLATORS.
>> TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR EACH
OTHER, SEE IF A PEACE CAN BE 
FORGED.
65 YEARS SINCE THE CEASE FIRE 
THAT ENDED THE FIGHTING IN THE 
KOREAN WAR, FIRST THERE'S BEEN 
NO PEACE TREATY.
JOINED BY MARTHA RADDATZ.
THE BIG QUESTION ON THE TABLE IS
NORTH KOREA WILLING TO GIVE UP 
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WHAT CAN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP OFFER KIM TO 
CONVINCE HIM HE DOESN'T NEED 
THEM?
>> WELL, WE KNOW THAT KIM 
JONG-UN HAS SAID HE WILL TALK 
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION.
HE WILL DISCUSS THAT OR WE 
WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THAT VERY 
CLEAR, THAT HAS TO BE ON THE 
TABLE.
MOST EXPERTS, MOST FORMER 
OFFICIALS WILL TELL YOU HE WILL 
NEVER GIVE UP THOSE WEAPONS.
BUT I THINK IF YOU READ THE 
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM ABOUT THAT, 
MAYBE KIM DOES WANT TO COME INTO
THE MODERN WORLD.
MAYBE HE DOES WANT HIS ECONOMY 
TO IMPROVE.
WHAT HE DOES WANT IS MORE 
MEETINGS THAN JUST THIS ONE.
BOTH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
WANT MORE MEETINGS.
THEY SAY THIS IS A PROCESS.
KIM OBVIOUSLY IF HE DECIDES TO 
DENUCLEARIZE IT WILL TAKE A 
WHILE.
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL 
NOT KNOW THE RESULTS OF FOR A 
LONG TIME.
BUT WHAT HE WANTS IN EXCHANGE IS
SECURITY WITHOUT WEAPONS IF IT 
COMES TO THAT. 
>> THIS COULD TAKE MONTHS AND 
YEARS.
DAVID MUIR ALSO HERE.
WE KNOW THAT, DAVID, NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS ARE WHAT GOT KIM HERE 
TODAY.
AND HE'S ALREADY ACHIEVED WHAT 
HIS FATHER, WHAT HIS GRANDFATHER
COULDN'T, SHARING A STAGE WITH 
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
>> NO QUESTION, GEORGE.
AND THE NUMBERS WHEN IT COME TO 
THAT NUCLEAR ARSENAL JUST 
STUNNING.
UNDER KIM JONG-UN, THEY LAUNCHED
MORE BALLISTIC MISSILES THAN HIS
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER COMBINED.
FOUR OF THE SIX NUCLEAR TESTS 
HAVE HAPPENED UNDER KIM JONG-UN,
THAT HYDROGEN EXPLOSION JUST A 
FEW MONTHS BACK BELIEVED TO BE 
LARGER THAN HIROSHIMA.
GEORGE, AS YOU POINT OUT, MANY 
OBSERVERS SAY THE FIRST VICTORY 
FOR KIM JUONG-UN IS APPEARING I 
MOMENTS HERE, THE LEADER OF THE 
FREE WORLD THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES.
>> THEY'RE ABOUT TO COME OUT 
RIGHT NOW.
WE EXPECT TO SEE KIM JONG-UN, 
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND KIM 
JONG-UN ARE THERE.
THEY WILL BE WALKING FROM 
OPPOSITE SIDES.
AS WE SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
GETTING PREPARED TO WALK TO 
CENTER STAGE.
AND THERE IT IS.
THE FIRSTHAND SHAKE BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND 
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR, DONALD 
TRUMP, KIM JONG-UN.
65 YEARS IN THE MAKING.
WE CAN'T READ EXACTLY WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SAYING TO 
KIM JONG-UN THERE.
BUT HE IS NOW FACING THE 
CAMERAS.
NO SMILES FROM EITHER MEN.
BUT A THANK YOU FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
AND THEY WILL NOW GO BEHIND 
CLOSED DOORS FOR THAT ONE-ON-ONE
MEETING WITH TRANSLATORS.
SOME SMILES NOW THAT THEY'RE IN 
THE CORRIDOR.
THE FIRST GREETING BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND 
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR.
THEY'RE GETTING STARTED BEFORE 
THEY GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, 
JONATHAN KARL.
>> Reporter: UNBELIEVABLE 
MOMENT, GEORGE.
I MEAN, JUST -- TO LOOK AT THOSE
TWO INDIVIDUALS, TWO OF THE MOST
UNPREDICTABLE LEADERS IN THE 
WORLD, STANDING TOGETHER OVER 
THE MOST OF THE PAST YEAR, 
GEORGE, THE CONVERSATION BACK 
AND FORTH WAS TAUNTING, WAS 
PERSONAL INSULTS, WAS TALK OF 
WAR.
AND THERE YOU SEE GETTING -- I 
THINK WHAT WE JUST SAW -- 
>> THE CAMERAS ARE GETTING 
TOGETHER TO GO INSIDE, JON.
>> YEAH.
THAT WAS TIGHTLY CHOREOGRAPHED.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN
WHEN THEY GET BEHIND CLOSED 
DOORS.
WE'LL SEE A MINUTE OF THAT.
DAVID MUIR, LET ME BRING YOU IN.
THEY BOTH KEPT ON THEIR GAME 
FACES BEFORE THE CAMERAS.
WHEN THEY GOT BEHIND THAT 
PILLAR, YOU SAW THEM BOTH BREAK 
INTO SMILES. 
>> INTO SMILES WITH THE WORLD 
WATCHING.
I'M SO CURIOUS, GEORGE, HOW MUCH
ENGLISH KIM JONG-UN UNDERSTANDS.
HE WAS EDUCATED IN SWITZERLAND.
A LOVER OF WRN CULTURES, MOVIES,
AMERICAN BASKETBALL.
WE DO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT AND 
KIM JONG-UN WILL BE IN THIS ROOM
ALONE WITH ONLY THEIR 
TRANSLATORS FOR AT LEAST THE 
FIRST MEETING HERE.
GOOD PART OF THAT FIRST MEETING.
AND WHAT'S UNCLEAR IS HOW MUCH 
THEY'LL BE ACTUALLY SPEAKING IN 
ENGLISH, KIM JONG-UN WILL 
UNDERSTAND AND PERHAPS IT WILL 
OFFER SOME ENGLISH IN RETURN. 
>> MARTHA RADDATZ, UP UNTIL THE 
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE AMERICAN
WHO KNEW HIM BEST DENNIS RODMAN.
MIKE POMPEO HAS MET WITH HIM 
LEADING UP TO THIS MEETING.
WE BELIEVE BUT DON'T KNOW FOR 
SURE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKELY
TALKED TO HIM OVER THE PHONE BUT
OF COURSE THIS IS THE FIRST FACE
TO FACE. 
>> EXACTLY.
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.
I THINK OF THE THREE OF US IN SO
MANY TIMES IN THE LAST FEW 
MONTHS TALKING ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF WAR AND BEING ON 
THAT BORDER, THAT DMZ, MYSELF A 
FEW MONTHS AGO, AND REALIZING 
THAT THESE ARE TWO NATIONS THAT 
COULD GO TO WAR AND THE MILITARY
IS PREPARING FOR THAT.
>> YOU SEE THE HAND ON THE 
SHOULDER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
PUT ON KIM JONG-UN.
IT'S QUITE EXTRAORDINARY. 
>> AND THE WORDS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP HAS USED TO DESCRIBE KIM 
JONG-UN, KIM JONG-UN USED TO 
DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT, 
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE CHANGE IN 
ATTITUDE, AT LEAST AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THIS MEETING.
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE THEY GET 
BEHIND THOSE DOORS.
BUT MARTHA, YOU JUST MADE THE 
POINT, ESPECIALLY AFTER THOSE 
FIRST TESTS AND THOSE THREATS 
FROM KIM JONG-UN, THE MILITARY 
WAS POISED FOR POSSIBLE MILITARY
ACTION.
NO ONE WAS SURE IT WOULDN'T 
COME. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS 
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT MUCH IS 
THAT KIM JONG-UN REALLY STOPPED 
BEFORE THE U.S. MILITARY -- 
>> CAMERAS NOW INSIDE THE ROOM 
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND KIM 
JONG-UN.
LET'S LISTEN IN.
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT.
WE'LL HAVE A GREAT DISCUSSION.
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.
THIS WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY 
SUCCESSFUL.
IT'S MY HONOR.
WE WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC 
RELATIONSHIP.
I HAVE NO DOUBT.
>> Translator: LOOK AT OBSTACLES
IN OUR WAY FORWARD, BUT WE 
OVERCAME ALL OF THEM AND WE ARE 
HERE TODAY.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> AND ANOTHER HANDSHAKE THERE 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG-UN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP -- 
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
LET'S GO.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRESS
RIGHT THERE SAYS HE EXPECTS A 
VERY GOOD MEETING.
HOPING FOR SUCCESS.
KIM JONG-UN SAYING THEY'VE 
OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO GET HERE.
LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT THE DAY 
CAN BRING.
YOU MADE THE POINT KIM JONG-UN 
GROOMED IN SWITZERLAND FOR 
LEADERSHIP, PICKED BY HIS FATHER
TO BECOME HIS SUCCESSOR.
IT WAS SUCH A MYSTERY TO MOST OF
THE WORLD.
>> WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT HIM.
IN FACT, IT WAS THE PRESIDENT, 
GEORGE, AS YOU'LL RECALL A FEW 
WEEKS BACK SAYING HE WAS JUST 27
YEARS OLD WHEN HE TOOK OVER THE 
REGIME, WHEN HIS FATHER DIED.
THE PRESIDENT SAYING SAY WHAT 
YOU WANT, BUT THAT'S NOT EASY 
ESPECIALLY AT THAT AGE.
I'M NOT GIVING HIM CREDIT OR NOT
GIVING HIM CREDIT.
I'M JUST SAYING IT'S A VERY HARD
THING TO DO.
A MOMENT OF RESPECT FROM THE 
PRESIDENT FOR THAT LEADER.
BUT KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A 
BRUTAL DICTATOR.
HE KILLED HIS UNCLE, HIS TRUSTED
UNCLE WHEN HE BELIEVE THE UNCLE 
PLOTTED A COUP.
IT'S WIDELY BELIEVE HE WAS 
BEHIND THE ASSASSINATION BEHIND 
HIS HALF BROTHER, THE NERVE 
AGENT ADMINISTERED BY THE TWO 
WOMEN.
AND OF COURSE MILLIONS OF NORTH 
KOREANS BACK HOME THAT HAVE 
FACED STARVATION, GEORGE, FOOD 
SHORTAGES AND THOSE ROLLING 
BLACKOUTS.
THE FACT THAT HE'S SITTING HERE 
BESIDE THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, THE LEADER OF THE
FREE WORLD IS HISTORIC FOR HIM 
AND A VICTORY ALREADY. 
>> ONE OF THE QUESTIONS, MARTHA 
RADDATZ, HOW MUCH THE PRESIDENT 
WILL BRING UP, HOW MUCH HE WILL 
CONFRONT KIM JONG-UN ON ISSUES 
BEYOND THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM?
>> THERE'S CALLS FOR HIM TO DO 
THAT, ADDRESS THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
ISSUES IN A BIG WAY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP, OF COURSE, 
WANTS THIS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL 
MEETING.
YOU HEARD HIM SAY, I THINK IT 
WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL,
AND IT IS MY HONOR TO MEET KIM 
JONG-UN.
THAT CERTAINLY STOOD OUT IN HIS 
REMARKS.
THEY'RE OFF TO A FRIENDLY START.
SO FAR THEY'VE GONE MORE THAN A 
MINUTE FOR SURE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD 
KNOW WITHIN A MINUTE WHETHER HE 
THOUGHT THE MEETING WOULD BE 
SUCCESSFUL.
IT TOOK ABOUT A MINUTE AND A 
HALF BEFORE HE SAID HE THOUGHT 
IT WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY 
SUCCESSFUL.
SO LET'S GO BACK TO WHAT WE WERE
SAYING A LITTLE BIT BEFORE, 
GEORGE, AND THE MILITARY 
CONFRONTATION THAT WE THOUGHT 
WAS SO REAL.
OUR U.S. MILITARY WAS PRACTICING
ALL THE TIME FOR WHAT MAY COME, 
IF KIM JONG-UN DECIDED TO DO AN 
ATMOSPHERIC TEST, WE WOULD HAVE 
TO STOP THAT IN SOME WAY OR 
RESPOND IN SOME WAY.
KIM JONG-UN DECIDED NOT TO GO 
FORWARD BECAUSE HE ALREADY -- 
COULD VERY QUICKLY GAIN THE 
ABILITY TO PUT A NUCLEAR WARHEAD
ON A MISSILE.
>> OF COURSE, IF THIS MEETING 
FAILS, THAT PROSPECT OF MILITARY
ACTION COULD COME TO THE FLOOR, 
AGAIN BUT FOR NOW, WE'VE SEEN 
HANDSHAKES, WE'VE SEEN SMILES 
FROM BOTH LEADERS, BOTH LOOKING 
CONFIDENT, BOTH HOPING THERE 
WILL BE SUCCESS, MEETING ONE ON 
ONE NOW WITH THEIR TRANSLATORS.
THE WIDER DELEGATIONS WILL 
FOLLOW.
WE'LL STAY HERE ALL NIGHT LONG, 
ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH 
BREAKING REPORTS AS IT WARRANTS.
THE FIRST SUMMIT BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND A 
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR.
FOLLOW US AT ABC NEWS.
BACK NOW TO OUR REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING.
♪
>> Announcer: THIS
>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT THE HISTORIC
SUMMIT, TRUMP AND KIM.
NOW REPORTING FROM SINGAPORE, 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.
>>> GOOD EVENING.
YOU SAW IT RIGHT THERE, THAT 
HANDSHAKE THAT HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE AN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT, A NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR SHAKING HANDS HERE IN 
SINGAPORE JUST ABOUT AN HOUR 
AGO.
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN THEN 
WENT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AFTER 
THAT GREETING BEFORE THE 
CAMERAS.
BOTH SAYING THEY EXPECT A VERY 
GOOD MEETING.
SO A SLIGHT SMILE ON THE FACE OF
KIM JONG-UN, THE PRESIDENT 
RELATIVELY SERIOUS THERE BEFORE 
THE CAMERAS.
BOTH SHOWING A STERN FACE TO THE
WORLD.
AND THEN JUST MOMENTS AGO, AFTER
MEETING FOR ABOUT 40 MINUTES 
WITH THEIR TRANSLATORS, THE 
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN 
WALKING ACROSS THAT COLONNADE 
FOR A BROADER MEETING WHERE 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITH THEIR 
TOP STAFF.
THAT IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT JOINED BY HIS 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO, 
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, 
JOHN BOLTON CHIEF OF STAFF JOHN 
KELLY, DELEGATION THERE WITH KIM
JONG-UN AS WELL.
JON KARL THERE AS WELL.
INTERESTING THAT JOHN BOLTON 
MADE IT INTO THE MEETING.
HE HAS BEEN THE HARDEST OF HARD 
LINERS ON NORTH KOREA.
ALMOST TANKED THE MEETING LAST 
MONTH WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
LIBYA MODEL, NORTH KOREA DOING 
AWAY WITH ALL OF ITS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MOAMMAR
GADHAFI. 
>> HE GAVE UP THE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS AND WAS MURDERED ON THE 
STREET OF TRIPOLI.
BOLTON IS THE HARDEST OF HARD 
LINER.
GEORGE, YOU REMEMBER SHORTLY 
BEFORE HE BECAME NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISER HE JOKED THE 
WAY TO TELL THE NORTH KOREANS 
ARE LYING IS TO LOOK AT WHETHER 
THEIR LIPS ARE MOVING.
THE NORTH KOREANS DETEST JOHN 
BOLTON, BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A GOOD COP/BAD COP GOING ON 
HERE.
OBVIOUSLY MIKE POMPEO SEEMS TO 
ESTABLISHED QUITE WARM RELATIONS
WITH KIM JONG-UN.
HE'S MET WITH HIM NOW MULTIPLE 
TIMES.
AND THE BIG QUESTION COMING OUT 
OF THIS IS WILL THERE BE ANY 
AGREEMENT WHATSOEVER.
GEORGE, I WOULD SAY THAT THE 
SINGLE BIGGEST WAY TO MEASURE 
THE SUCCESS OF THIS FIRST 
MEETING, IF IT IS A FIRST 
MEETING, IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
ARE SAYING THAT THEY WILL MEET 
AGAIN BECAUSE CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GET A DETAILED 
AGREEMENT OUT OF THIS SHORT 
ENCOUNTER HERE IN SINGAPORE.
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION MARTHA 
RADDATZ, CAN THEY COBBLE 
TOGETHER SOME KIND OF JOINT 
AGREEMENT?
>> I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 
TRYING TO DO.
LET'S REMEMBER WHAT THE GOAL 
EVENTUALLY IS, COMPLETE, 
VERIFIABLE, IRREVERSIBLE, 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE,
SAID THAT VERY CLEARLY HERE 
YESTERDAY.
THEY SAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
>> AND DAVID MUIR, THAT WAS THE 
QUESTION THAT KIM JONG-UN THREE 
TIMES IN THE WALK ACROSS THE 
COLONNADE. 
>> YOU HEARD REPORTERS ASKING 
THIS REPEATEDLY.
HE'LL GET IT AGAIN, KIM JONG-UN 
ASKED WILL HE GET RID OF HIS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
GEORGE, AS YOU KNOW, ULTIMATELY 
THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM TO THE TABLE
ACROSS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES IN THE FIRST 
PLACE.
HE LOST MORE BALLISTIC MISSILES 
THAN HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER 
COMBINED.
THE TEST OF THE HYDROGEN BOMB, 
LARGER THAN THE BOMB DROPPED ON 
HIROSHIMA, YOU HEARD SECRETARY 
OF STATE MIKE POMPEO PRESSED 
WILL THERE BE ANY KIND OF 
AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR 
ECONOMIC RELIEF BEFORE ALL OF 
THAT IS DESTROYED.
HE WAS CLEAR IN HIS POSTURING 
GOING INTO THE SUMMIT BUT CLEAR 
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS SAYING NO 
ECONOMIC RELIEF UNTIL WE SEE ALL
OF THAT DESTROYED. 
>> THE SEQUENCING IS SO 
IMPORTANT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE NEGOTIATING 
RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL STAY WITH THIS ALL NIGHT 
LONG.
WE'LL RETURN NOW TO REGULAR 
PROGRAMMING BUT CONTINUING WITH 
OUR COVERAGE ON DIGITAL ABC NEWS
ONLINE.
♪
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY 
SOMETHING?
>> Translator: WE HAD AN 
HISTORIC MEETING AND DECIDED TO 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND AND WE'RE 
ABOUT TO SIGN AN HISTORIC 
DOCUMENT.
THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR 
CHANGE.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY 
GRATITUDE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
MAKE THIS MEETING HAPPEN.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OKAY.
. 
>> SO THERE YOU SEE IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING ALONG 
WITH NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM 
JONG-UN.
AND YOU HEARD THE COMETS FROM 
KIM JONG-UN JUST MOMENTS AGO 
SAYING WE ARE GOING TO SIGN A 
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.
WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME TOGETHER.
WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE PAST 
BEHIND US AND THE WORLD IS ABOUT
TO SEE AMAZING CHANGE.
LET'S LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> DID YOU TALK ABOUT OTTO 
WARMBIER, SIR?
>> THE PRESIDENT SAYING YOU'LL 
BE ABLE TO SEE THE CHANGE 
QUICKLY.
YOU HEAR THEM ASKING QUESTIONS.
>> THE LETTER WE'RE SIGNING IS 
VERY COMPREHENSIVE.
I THINK BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO 
BE VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE 
RESULT.
A LOT OF GOOD WILL WENT INTO 
THIS, A LOT OF WORK, A LOT OF 
PREPARATION.
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY ON 
BOTH SIDES.
SECRETARY POMPEO AND ALL OF HIS 
COUNTERPARTS.
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE BIT 
LATER.
AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT 
TOOK PLACE TODAY.
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IS GOING TO BE A VERY 
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN IT
HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.
WE DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING 
AND WE DEVELOPED A VERY SPECIAL 
BOND.
SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
IMPRESSED.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
HAPPY AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
CARE OF A VERY BIG AND VERY 
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD.
AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN 
KIM.
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER 
TODAY.
VERY INTENSIVE TIME.
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT IT
WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US FAR 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED.
I THINK I THINK FAR BETTER -- I 
WATCHED THE VARIOUS NEWS 
REPORTS.
I WOULD SAY FAR BETTER THAN 
ANYONE EVEN PREDICTED.
AND THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO 
MORE AND MORE AND MORE, AND IT'S
AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU.
GREAT HONOR.
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOUR 
REPRESENTATIVES.
VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.
>>. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, I WILL.
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SCENE UNFOLDING 
HERE IN SINGAPORE ABOUT 1:44 OUR
TIME HERE IN THE AFTERNOON.
WE'RE 12 HOURS AHEAD OF EASTERN 
STANDARD TIME, 1:45 IN THE 
MORNING EASTERN TIME BACK IN THE
U.S.
PRESIDENT PRESIDENT, KIM JONG-UN
SIGNING PAPER WORK JUST MOMENTS 
AGO, A DOCUMENT.
THE PRESIDENT SAID I THINK OUR 
WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO 
BE WITH THE KOREAN PENINSULA, HE
SAID, MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IN THE
PAST.
WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO TAKE 
CARE OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.
HE CALLED THIS A LETTER.
HE SAID A LOT OF GOODWILL WENT 
INTO IT, A LOT OF PREPARATION.
THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY MORE 
DETAILS ENAND, OF COURSE, DETAI 
IS WHAT MATTERED HERE.
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE, 
WOULD THE PRESIDENT GET KIM 
JONG-UN TO DECIDE TO GIVE UP HIS
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
A COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.
OR WOULD THIS JUST BE THE 
BEGINNING OF A NEW RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NORTH KOREA, A RESET, IF 
YOU WILL.
THE SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN UNTIL 
NORTH KOREA COMPLETELY AND 
VEV
VERIFIABLY GETS RID OF ITS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ACCORDING TO 
POMPEO.
THAT'S UNCLEAR.
>> HE SAID HE WAS FOLLOWING A 
SCRIPT AND THE SCRIPT WENT EVEN 
BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
THE ONLY THING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT GAVE US A 
HINT ABOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF A 
DANGEROUS PROBLEM.
TO THE REST OF US, THAT MEANS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S 
ANYTHING CONCRETE, BUT WE JUST 
DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.
>> LET'S BRING IN TOM BOSSERT.
YOU WERE WATCHING THIS WITH US.
AND YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING AS 
WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR FOR HOURS 
NOW, THE DEVIL IS IN THE 
DETAILS.
>> IT'S HARD TO READ THE TEA 
LEAVES HERE.
THERE'S A NOTION OF DISARM, 
DISABLING AND DISMANTLING THAT 
THE U.S. WAS SEEKING.
PERHAPS WE GOT THEM TO AGREE TO 
DISARMING, WHICH WOULD BE A 
MASSIVE BREAK THROUGH IF THAT'S 
THE CASE.
THE DISMANTLING AND DISABLING 
COULD COME LATER IN A SEQUENCED 
FASHION.
AT THIS POINT, WE'RE SPECULATING
TO THAT.
EITHER WAY, AN HISTORIC 
DEVELOPMENT.
WE THE WHO
WE. 
>> THEY SAY THE WHOLE WORLD IS 
GOING TO SEE CHANGE.
>> EXTRAORDINARY TO HEAR -- 
EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE KIM JONG-UN
SITTING NEXT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
BUT THEY HAVE TO VERIFY WHATEVER
HAPPENS.
THIS IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP THAT 
YOU CAN DEPEND ON TRUSTING THE 
NORTH KOREANS, NO MATTER HOW 
FRIENDLY THAT LOOKS.
NO MATTER HOW MANY PATS ON THE 
BACK, NO MATTER HOW THEY WALK 
OUT TOGETHER, THEY HAVE TO 
VERIFY.
THIS ISN'T A RELATIONSHIP YOU 
CAN TRUST.
>> THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID 
THE LAST 24 HOUR, WE WILL NOT 
LIFT THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.
THERE WILL NOT BE ECONOMIC 
RELIEF UNLESS WE SEE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
WE'RE IN OVERNIGHT HOURS IN THE 
UNITED STATES.
I DO WANT TO BRING IN JUJU 
CHANG.
WE WERE GETTING WORD THAT THE 
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT, 
PRESIDENT MOON AND THE CABINET, 
THEY WERE WATCHING ALL OF THIS 
UNFOLD TODAY.
AT MARTHA POINTS OUT, THEY SHOOK
HANDS JUST A FEW HOURS AGO AND 
NOW THEY SIGN THIS LETTER IN 
FRONT OF THE WORLD.
>> WHAT STRIKES ME DAVID, I HAVE
TO SAY, WHEN YOU SEE THE SMILE 
AND THE HAND SHAKES AND YOU SEE 
KIM WALKING AROUND AS A TOURIST 
IN THIS FUTURISTIC CITY OF 
SINGAPORE.
ALL I CAN THINK OF, HERE'S A 
DICTATOR, A HEAD OF STATE WHO 
HAS SENT, ACCORDING TO 
DEFECTORS, PEOPLE TO PRISON JUST
FOR WATCHING K-POP VIDEOS OR 
TAKING PART IN ANYTHING THAT'S 
WESTERN OR EVEN ENGAGING IN 
CAPITALISM.
AND YET HERE HE IS TODAY SHAKING
THE HAND OF A ULTIMATE 
CAPITALIST AND MAKING NICE WITH 
THE WEST WHICH WAS JUST EQUATED 
WITH EVIL FOR DECADES UNDER HIS 
REGIME.
HIS FAMILY'S REGIME, ANYWAY.
>> YOU'RE LOOKING AT LIVE 
PICTURES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 
WALKING DOWN THE KOL NAD THERE.
 THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE IN RECENT DAYS WHEN 
NORTH KOREA'S FORMER CHIEF SPY 
MASTER CAME AND DELIVERED A 
LETTER, IF THEY TALKED ABOUT 
HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
HE SAID IT DID NOT COME UP.
HE SAID PERHAPS IT WOULD WITH 
KIM JONG-UN.
UNCLEAR IF HUMAN RIGHTS CAME UP.
AND UNCLEAR, JOHN KARL, WHO 
JOINS US NOW, WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE WAS ANY KIND OF AGREEMENT 
IN PRINCIPLE FOR COMPLETE 
DENIQUE LURIZATION WHICH IS WHAT
WE HEARD SECRETARY STATE MIKE 
POMPEO PRESSED.
AND YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT, 
HAVE YOU GOTTEN KIM JONG-UN TO 
AGREE TO GIVE UP HIS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.
>> A LOT OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS, DAVID.
A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS SIGNED 
AND WHAT THE MECHANISMS WOULD BE
FOR PUTTING THAT AGREEMENT IN 
ACTION, WHATEVER IT WAS.
BUT ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
QUESTION, IF YOU THINK BACK TO 
THE PRESIDENT STATE OF THE UNION
ADDRESS, AND THE GUEST IN THE 
FIRST LADY'S BOX, THE NORTH 
KOREAN DEFECTOR WHO THE 
PRESIDENT TOLD THE STORY ABOUT 
HOW HE DEFLECTED ON HIS CRUTCHE 
AND MADE HIS WAY ACROSS CHINA.
THE PRESIDENT IN THAT SPEECH 
SAID -- AND THIS IS AN EXACT 
QUOTE -- NO REGIME HAS OPPRESSED
ITS OWN CITIZENS MORE TOTALLY OR
BRUTALLY THAN THE CRUEL 
DICTATORSHIP IN NORTH KOREA.
THAT WAS JUST MONTHS AGO DURING 
THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
ALL THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 
WAS THAT THIS MEETING TODAY 
WOULD BE ABOUT THE NUCLEAR 
ISSUE, WOULD NOT BE ABOUT HUMAN 
RIGHTS.
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
IS THERE A REAL NUCLEAR 
AGREEMENT THAT WILL BE IN PLACE?
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT NORTH
KOREA BECOMING A PART OF THE 
REAL WORLD, AS HE PUT IT.
THE MOST BRUTAL DICTATOR IN THE 
WORLD WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING 
TO SCALE BACK THE OPROSECUTE 
EGS.
 -- OPPRESSION.
>> LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.
THIS IS LIVE.
>> WHAT DID YOUR LEARN ABOUT 
HIM, SIR?
>> HE'S A GREAT, TALENTED MAN.
I ALSO LEARNED THAT HE LOVES HIS
COUNTRY VERY MUCH.
. 
>> WILL YOU BE MEETING AGAIN, 
SIR?
>> WE'LL MEET BE TIMES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> IT HAS BEEN A DAY OF FIRSTS 
HERE IN SINGAPORE.
THE FIRST TIME A SITTING U.S. 
PRESIDENT HAS MET WITH THE 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROVING AS HE SO
OFTEN DOES, THAT HE'S A SKILLED 
TELEVISION PERSONALITY FROM THE 
PAST.
AND TALKING TO REPORTERS MOMENTS
AGO, TELLING HIM THAT HE WILL 
HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE BEFORE 
THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS CORPS 
GATHERED HERE A SHORT TIME FROM 
NOW.
WHEN HE DOES HOLD THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE, TAKE QUESTIONS, 
OFFER MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE 
LETTER THAT WAS JUST SIGNED 
BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADER, WE 
WILL CARRY IT LIVE.
WE WILL ALSO HAVE WEST COAST 
"NIGHTLINE" LIVE FOR YOU COMING 
UP HERE.
MORE AT ABC NEWS.COM.
AND HE ALSO SAID THERE THAT WE 
WOULD BE MEETING MANY, MANY 
TIMES.
YOU SAW THE HAND SHAKE.
AND HE SAID OF KIM JONG-UN, I 
ALSO LEARNED THAT HE LOVES HIS 
COUNTRY, TOO.
THOSE WERE THE FINAL WORDS 
BEFORE THEY SHOOK HANDS ONCE 
AGAIN AND PARTED WAYS.
THE BEGINNING OF A RELATIONSHIP,
THE PRESIDENT ALLUDING TO WHERE 
THERE WILL BE MANY MORE MEETINGS
TO COME.
OUR THANKS TO JOHN KARL, MARTHA,
TOM, AND WE'LL MEET YOU AGAIN 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSES THE
INTERNATIONAL PRESS CORPS HERE 
IN SINGAPORE.
WE'LL SEE YOU SHORTLY.
. 
>>> WE WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC 
RELATIONSHIP, I HAVE NO DOUBT.
>> BREAKING NOW, THE MEETING 
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
>> THIS HALF HOUR, WHAT HAPPENS 
AFTER THE HANDSHAKE, PLUS, THE 
HEALTH SCARE FOR SOMEONE IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.
>> TRUMP AND KIM, THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT.
>>> FROM ABC NEWS, THIS IS 
"WORLD NEWS NOW."
>> AND WE DO SAY GOOD MORNING TO
EVERYBODY ON THIS TUESDAY.
>> QUITE A BUSY ONE.
>> WHAT A TUESDAY, WHAT A 
MORNING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
SIX DECADES OF HOSTILITY AT 
TIMES WITH THE U.S. AND NORTH 
KOREA ON THE BRINK OF WAR 
SEEMINGLY COMING TO AN END 
TODAY.
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH 
KOREAN DICTATOR KICKED OFF THE 
MOMENTOUS OCCASION WITH A 
HANDSHAKE.
>> THE PRESIDENT PREDICTED 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND GAVE THAT
THUMBS UP THAT YOU SEE RIGHT 
THERE.
HE'S ALREADY DESCRIBING THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP AS EXCELLENT.
MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS US LIVE 
FROM SINGAPORE.
GOOD MORNING.
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST IN SOUTH 
KOREA AT THE DMZ A FEW MOMENTS 
AGO.
YOU SEE ALL OF THIS PLAYING OUT,
YOUR IMPRESSIONS TODAY.
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S QUITE 
INCREDIBLE TO SEE THOSE 
PICTURES.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT
IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT LETTER THAT
THEY SIGNED SAYS.
WE DO KNOW FROM WHAT HE SAID, 
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT 
RELATIONSHIP, SO IF YOU THINK 
BACK BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME
HERE, HE SAID THE LEAST WE CAN 
ACCOMPLISH IS MEET, SEE EACH 
OTHER AND HOPEFULLY LIKE EACH 
OTHER.
THAT, THEY GOT FOR SURE.
BUT THEY CLEARLY ALLUDED TO THE 
FACT THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.
DIDN'T SAY HOW, DIDN'T LAY OUT 
ANYTHING.
BUT THE KEY TO ME IS WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE VERY END 
WHEN HE WALKED AWAY THERE WAS 
ASKED ABOUT OTHER MEETINGS.
AND HE SAID THERE WILL BE MANY 
MORE.
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT THEY 
WANTED, A PROCESS, THAT'S WHAT 
KIM JONG UN WANTED.
SO WE WILL SEE IF THEY SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION,
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 
GET REAL SPECIFIC THERE IF THEY 
HAVE MORE MEETINGS TO COME.
>> I KNOW THE PRESIDENT SAID 
WE'LL KNOW VERY QUICKLY.
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE PORING 
THROUGH THIS LANGUAGE.
WE HEARD FROM KIM JONG UN, THE 
WORLD WILL SIEE MAJOR JACHANGE.
WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS ON 
BOTH SIDES FOR WHAT THOSE WORDS 
MEAN?
>> Reporter: WELL, FOR THE U.S. 
IS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
AND FOR KIM, IT IS SECURITY.
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THE 
UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO 
VERIFY.
MIKE POMPEO MADE THAT VERY 
CLEAR.
WHATEVER IS THE FINAL AGREEMENT 
HAS TO HAVE THAT COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
KIM JONG UN MAY HAVE A VERY 
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT 
THAT MEANS.
HE WANTS TO BE SECURE IF HE DOES
NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE 
WHO DOUBT THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN,
BUT WE CAN REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.
AND THE U.S., OF COURSE, DOESN'T
TRUST KIM.
THEY WANT TO VERIFY.
BUT THIS IS A START.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
THIS IS HISTORIC.
I THINK THINGS WILL NOT BE THE 
SAME WITH NORTH KOREA.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE 
PRESIDENT LEARNED AND HIS STAFF 
AND HIS AIDES AND SECRETARY 
POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON WHO ARE 
IN THERE ABOUT KIM JONG UN.
NO ONE KNEW.
WE SAID ALL DAY THE LAST 
AMERICAN WHO REALLY TALKED TO 
HIM BEFORE MIKE POMPEO WAS 
DENNIS RODMAN.
DENNIS RODMAN KNEW MORE ABOUT 
KIM JONG UN THAN ANY OTHER 
AMERICAN.
AND NOW WE'VE GOT THIS.
YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW IN THAT 
ROOM, THOSE AIDES ARE TAKING 
NOTES.
THEY'RE WATCHING KIM JONG UN. 
>> HOW DOES HE NEGOTIATE?
DO WE THINK HE'S TELLING THE 
TRUTH?
MIKE POMPEO IS READING THE BODY 
LANGUAGE AND WHAT HE SAYS.
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO, THIS IS
THE ART OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT.
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK IN A ROOM 
AND GET A DEAL AND KNOWS WHAT TO
LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO LOOK OUT 
FOR.
>> POINTING OUT THAT WE BARELY 
EVEN HEARD KIM JONG UN'S VOICE 
PRIOR TO THIS MORNING.
IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR IT.
MARTHA RADDATZ IN SINGAPORE.
WE APPRECIATE IT, MARTHA.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 
CONTRIBUTOR, RETIRED COLONEL 
STEVE GANNYARD.
>> SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT, 
PROMISING MAJOR CHANGE.
CAN A DEAL BE TRUSTED, THOUGH?
THEY BOTH SEEM INCREDIBLY 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT JUST 
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT DO WE FOCUS 
ON NOW?
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NUKES 
THEY HAVE.
SO WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER THAT
WE'RE GOING TO COUNT THEN IT'S 
HARD TO COUNT THAT NUMBER.
SO FINDING WAYS TO DO THIS IS 
GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT 
OF TIME AND NEGOTIATION.
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 
HAPPEN OVER MONTHS IF NOT YEARS 
TO COME TO THE FINAL DETAILS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT.
BUT I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING 
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT MOST OF MY 
CAREER THINKING ABOUT THE THREAT
FROM THE NORTH AND THE HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO 
HAVE SERVED IN UNIFORM IN THE 
PACIFIC WHERE NORTH KOREA WAS 
THE THREAT.
AND HERE YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEN 
SITTING TOGETHER.
IT IS, WHETHER IT TURNS OUT 
RIGHT OR WRONG, IT'S STILL AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.
>> NOW STEVE, TWO MONTHS AGO YOU
SAID THAT YOU WERE SKEPTICAL 
THAT THEY WOULD BREAK EVERY 
PROMISE THEY MADE.
HE SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT 
JUST TRUST AND VERIFY BUT 
DISTRUST AND VERIFY.
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY AFTER 
SEEING THESE PICTURES?
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO.
WE'VE BEEN BURNED IN THE PAST.
AND UNTIL THEY SHOW SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT, THEN WE NEED TO, THEN
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TRUST NO 
ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN 
VERIFY EVERYTHING THAT WE AGREE 
TO.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO
SEE SOME CHANGES, AND I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME TRUE 
MOVEMENT FORWARD, BUT IT'S ALL 
GOING TO PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT 
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, HOPEFULLY 
BRINGING PEACE AND REUNIFICATION
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO MANY HOPING FOR
THAT THIS MORNING.
STEVE GANYARD FOR US THANK YOU.
>> OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL THE 
DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN 
SINGAPORE, IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA
AS WELL AS WELL AS NORTH KOREA.
>> THE WORLD IS WATCHING THIS.
NOT ONLY ARE THE STAKES VERY 
HIGH FOR THE UNITED STATES, 
WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME NOW.
AND THIS IS TWO LEADERS WHO WENT
FROM SEEMINGLY ON THE BRINK OF 
WAR.
>> WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT ASKED,
WOULD YOU INVITE HIM TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND HE SAID YES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> ABSOLUTELY YES.
>>> COMING MORE, A
>>> SOME LIVE IMAGES OF THE 
BUSINESS DISTRICT IN SINGAPORE 
WHERE THAT COUNTRY IS BASKING IN
THE GLOW OF HOME OF WHAT WAS A 
HISTORY-MAKING DAY FOR THE 
WORLD.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG 
UN SIGNING A DEAL, AS WE WAIT TO
SEE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THAT 
DEAL, WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS.
HERE AT HOME, THE PRESIDENT'S 
TOP ECONOMIC ADVISER HAS 
SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK.
>> HE BROKE THE NEWS IN A TWEET 
AS HE DOES.
HE IS BEING TREATED AT WALTER 
REED IN THE D.C. AREA.
IT WAS A VERY MILD HEART ATTACK 
AND KUDLOW IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A
FULL AND SPEEDY RECOVERY.
>> HE HAS PLAYED A LEADING ROLE 
IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH TRADE 
PARTNERS.
WHEN ALLIES CLASHED AT THE G7 HE
CAME TO HIS DEFENSE SAYING 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU STABBED THE 
PRESIDENT IN THE BACK.
AFTER TRUDEAU SAID HE WOULD 
RETALIATE FOR NEW OU.S. TARIFFS 
MIKE POMPEO TRIED TO PLAY DOWN 
THE FEUD.
>> I AM CONFIDENT THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND THOSE COUNTRIES WILL 
MOVE FORWARD ON A STRONG BASIS.
>> CANADA'S FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAID THEY DON'T BELIEVE THOSE 
TYPES OF ATTACKS ARE APPROPRIATE
OR USEFUL WAY TO CONDUCT 
RELATIONS.
GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL 
CALLED THE WORDS SOBERING AND 
DEPRESSING.
>>> RIGHTS GROUPS ARE 
CRITICIZING THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL.
CRITICS OF A RULING SAY IT COULD
AFFECT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE.
INCLUDING WOMEN SEEKING 
ASSISTANCE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
GROUNDS.
>>> MORE THAN 2,000 HOMES HAVE 
BEEN EVACUATED IN COLORADO 
BECAUSE OF AN OUT OF CONTROL 
WILDFIRE.
IT IS NOW OVER 20,000 ACRES IN 
SIZE.
DANYA BAUCUS HAS MORE.
>> THIS AREA IS UNDER MANDATORY 
EVACUATION.
>> Reporter: OFFICIALS DECLARING
A CODE RED.
MORE THAN 2,000 COLORADO 
RESIDENTS GIVEN JUST A LITTLE 
TIME.
>> DO I GO THIS WAY OR -- 
>> YEP, YEP.
>> I'M FREAKIN' OUT.
>> THAT'S OKAY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Reporter: TO PACK UP AND 
LEAVE.
THE 416 FIRE IN DURANGO DOUBLING
IN SIZE.
WINDY CONDITIONS PROVIDING A 
PERFECT SETUP TO FUEL THE 
FLAMES.
HUGE PLUMES OF SMOKE TAKING OVER
THE SKY.
THE FIREFIGHT HAPPENING FROM THE
AIR WITH PLANES DROPPING FIRE 
RETARDANT AND HELICOPTERS DO IN 
WATER DROPS.
>> IT'S SCARY FROM THE FACT OF 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S 
GOING TO LAST.
>> Reporter: OFFICIALS SAY 
FLAMES HAVE COME WITHIN FEET OF 
HOMES.
BUT AS OF MONDAY, NO STRUCTURES 
HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR LOST.
AND OFFICIALS SAY THE FIRE 
DANGER IS DECREASING AS COOLER 
TEMPERATURES AND LESS WIND MOVE 
INTO THE AREA.
NO WORD ON WHEN THOSE EVACUATION
ORDERS WILL BE LIFTED.
>>> SEVERE WEATHER AND THE 
HURRICANE KNOWN AS BUD IS NOW 
CATEGORY THREE CHURNING OFF THE 
COAST OF MEXICO.
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS ARE 125 
MILES PER HOUR.
IT IS SUPPOSED TO BRUSH THE BAJA
PENINSULA LATER THIS WEEK.
HEAVY RAIN TO THE SOUTHWEST U.S.
EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS.
>>> SOME AIRLINE PASS JURORS 
RECEIVED A COLD-BLOODED WELCOME 
TO FLORIDA.
THEY HAD TO STAY ON THEIR PLANE 
AFTER ARRIVING IN ORLANDO 
BECAUSE AN ALLIGATOR WAS ON THE 
RUNWAY.
THE FLIGHT WAS ALLOWED TO HEAD 
TO ITS GATE AFTER THE GATOR 
STROLLED INTO THE POND.
BUT NOTHING SAYS FLORIDA LIKE AN
ALLIGATOR DELAY.
>> THERE YOU GO.
A NEW GREETING COMMITTEE.
>> A NEW GREETING.
>> YOU CAN TIP THAT GATOR IF YOU
WANT TO.
>>> AND MAN'S BEST FRIEND PROVED
TO BE A BABY'S HERO AT A HOUSE 
FIRE IN CALIFORNIA.
>> IN IS THE FAMILY'S PIT BULL.
SASHA TURNED INTO A FOUR-LEGGED 
FIRE RESCUE TEAM.
AT FIRST SHE BANGED ON THE DOOR 
WHEN SHE NOTICED A FIRE AT THE 
NEIGHBOR'S HOME HAD SPREAD TO 
THEIRS.
>> THEN SHE RAN IN AND GRABBED 
THE 7 MONTH OLD BY HER DIAPER, 
DRAGGING THE LITTLE GIRL OUT OF 
THE HOUSE, TRYING TO GET HER TO 
SAFETY.
LUCKILY, EVERYBODY GOT OUT OF 
THE HOUSE OKAY.
BUT SASHA IS NOW BEING CREDITED 
WITH SAVING THE FAMILY.
>> YEAH, SHE'S BEEN LICKING THE 
LITTLE GIRL EVER SINCE.
LISTEN.
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.
>> I GET TO LICK YOUR FACE ALL I
WANT.
>> AND YOU WILL PICK UP MY POOP 
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE OLDER.
>> WHEN WE COME BACK.
MORE FROM SINGAPORE AS KIM JONG 
UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE 
HISTORY.
>> AND WE ARE STANDING BY IN 
SOUTH KOREA FOR FRESH REACTION 
FROM THERE.
YOU'RE WATCHING "WORLD NEWS NOW"
 you running...
. 
>>> WE'RE BACK WITH LIVE IMAGES 
ONCE AGAIN OF SINGAPORE WHERE 
WE'RE TOLD THAT KIM JONG UN HAS 
NOW LEFT THE NEARBY SENTOSA 
ISLAND WHERE THAT SUMMIT HAD 
BEEN HELD HOURS EARLIER.
AND AS THE NEWS BREAKS ACROSS 
THE WORLD, IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT WILL 
BE INTERPRETED IN THE SECRETIVE 
NORTH WHERE INFORMATION IS MORE 
TIGHTLY CONTROLLED THAN ANYWHERE
ELSE IN THE WORLD.
>> MANY NORTH KOREANS IN THE 
CAPITAL CITY OF PYONGYANG ARE 
AWAITING WORD FROM STATE MEDIA 
THERE, WHERE, IN THE SOUTH, THEY
HELD A VIGIL FOR PEACE THIS PAST
WEEKEND, AND THERE ARE HOPES 
THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR STEP 
TOWARD REUNIFICATION.
A DREAM FOR MANY KOREANS ON BOTH
SIDES OF THAT 38th PARALLEL.
>> LET'S GO TO SOMEONE WHO'S HAD
INCREDIBLE ACCESS OVER THE 
YEARS.
BOB WOODRUFF IS LIVE WITH US.
WHAT'S THE REACTION SO FAR FROM 
THE SOUTH KOREANS?
>> Reporter: WELL, THE SOUTH 
KOREANS ARE PRETTY HOPEFUL.
THEY'RE SEEING SOME OF THESE 
RESULTS.
I'M RIGHT DOWNTOWN SEOUL RIGHT 
NOW.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING 
ON IN THIS CAPITAL.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO COME OUT 
OF WORK A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S BEEN PRETTY DULL MOST OF 
THE DAY.
NOW THEY'RE HITTING THE STREETS.
THIS BACK HERE IS THE BLUE 
HOUSE, THEIR EQUIVALENT OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE.
THIS IS WHERE THE POLITICS 
HAPPENS, THIS IS WHERE THE BIG 
MEETINGS ARE HAPPENING.
BUT THIS IS DOWNTOWN.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF 
THINGS.
WE'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE U.S.
EMBASSY.
YOU CAN SEE THE AMERICAN FLAG 
RIGHT THERE.
SO THAT'S GUARDED.
OUTSIDE BY MULTIPLE GUARDS.
THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE OUTSIDE.
AND, IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE, THIS
IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN 
THIS, SOMEBODY SAYING, AGAINST 
THE PEACE TALKS WITHOUT NORTH 
KOREANS, HUMAN RIGHTS.
PEOPLE WANT THIS TO BE TALKED 
ABOUT AT THE SUMMIT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY KIM JONG UN 
IS NOT THIS PEACEFUL MAN.
THIS IS ONE WHO COMMITTED A LOT 
OF CRIMES.
HE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS HALF
BROTHER AND UNCLE.
SO THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT 
TOPIC AS WELL.
SO EXACTLY WHAT THE REACTION IS 
TO THE SUMMIT IS PRETTY UNCLEAR.
BUT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TALK 
TO ME.
AND THEY SAID THEY'RE HAPPY THAT
SOMETHING POSITIVE COULD COME 
OUT OF IT, BUT THEY JUST WANT TO
MAKE SURE THIS IS DONE PROPERLY.
THEY TRUST GENERALLY, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, BUT THEY DON'T REALLY 
TRUST KIM JONG UN AT ALL.
PART OF IT'S THAT HISTORY.
NORTH KOREA, WE DON'T REALLY NOW
WHAT THE PEOPLE'S REAL THOUGHTS 
ARE.
YOU KNOW, INSIDE THEIR SOUL, 
IT'S HARD TO KNOW.
EVERY TIME WE VISIT NORTH KOREA,
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MINDERS.
JOURNALISTS CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE
WITH REAL FREEDOM.
SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY'RE THINKING, BUT CERTAINLY 
SHOCKING THAT THEY'VE HEARD ALL 
THESE DETAILS OF THEIR LEADER, 
THIS TRIP TO SINGAPORE, TO 
WATCH, WITH PICTURES OF HIM.
THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.
WE'LL WAIT AND SEE EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENS HERE IN SEOUL.
BUT IT'S STARTING TO UNFOLD A 
LITTLE BIT.
>> I KNOW IT'S LARHARD TO GET A 
READ ON THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.
BUT NORTH KOREA HAS HAD A LOT OF
DEFECTORS LATELY.
SPECIFICALLY, ELITES DEFECTING.
WHAT ARE THEY HOPING FOR?
>> Reporter: THE NORTH KOREANS, 
THE FIRST TIME I WENT THERE WAS 
2005, SO, WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT,
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
BLUE HOUSE AGAIN.
THERE'S A BETTER SHOT TO LOOK 
HERE WHILE WE'RE DOWNTOWN SEOUL.
BUT THE FIRST TIME I WENT BACK 
THERE IN 2005 IN NORTH KOREA, 
YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE REALLY KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
EVEN A LOT OF THOSE IN 
PYONGYANG, THE CAPITAL OF NORTH 
KOREA.
BUT NOW THERE'S A LOT MORE 
CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
THEY CAN GET SOME ACCESS TO THE 
CELL PHONES ALONG THE BORDER 
WITH CHINA.
A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM NORTH KOREA
ARE GOING TO STUDY OVERSEAS.
A LOT OF DIPLOMATS RETURN AFTER 
SEEING THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
SO THE ELITE IN PYONGYANG REALLY
KNOW WHAT THE WORLD IS.
IT'S GOT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
KIM JONG UN TO DO THINGS 
DIFFERENT THAN HIS FATHER DID.
HIS FATHER COULD PROTECT HIS 
COUNTRY FROM THOSE FROM THE 
OUTSIDE.
HE COULD CONVINCE PEOPLE ON THE 
INSIDE THAT THE LEADERS OF THE 
REGIME ARE LIKE GODS AND SHOULD 
NEVER BE DENIED ANYTHING.
THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE 
DIFFICULT.
KIM JONG UN HAS SEEN CHINA IS 
NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH ALL OF 
THIS ACTIVITY.
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GETTING 
PRESSURE FROM THEM AND THE 
UNITED STATES.
THERE'S MOTIVATION TO DO 
SOMETHING THAN WAS DONE BEFORE.
MAYBE THIS MEANS DENUCLEARIZING,
OR MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT HE NEEDS MORE MONEY IN THE 
COUNTRY, SANCTIONS LIFTED.
AND HE NEEDS, NUMBER ONE, AS A 
GUARANTEE FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
THAT HE WILL NOT BE ASSASSINATED
OR HIS REGIME DEFEATED IF HE 
GETS RID OF HIS NUCLEAR BOMBS, 
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 
THAT.
>> ALL RIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
PROMISING PROTECTION TO KIM JONG
UN, AND I'M SURE THE PEOPLE IN 
SOUTH KOREA HOPING THEY'LL BE 
PROTECTED TOO AND HOPING FOR 
PEACE TO COME OUT OF THIS DEAL.
BOB WOODRUFF LIVE IN SEOUL FOR 
US, THANK YOU.
>> WHAT A DAY THERE IN SEOUL.
I'VE BEEN TO SEOUL DURING SOME 
OF THE WORST TIMES, TENSE 
MOMENTS, AND THE SOUTH KOREANS 
ARE JUST LIKE, EH, SO IT'S 
FASCINATING NOW AT THE GOOD 
TIMES TO SEE THAT THEY'RE 
HOPEFUL AND LOOKING FORWARD TO 
THE FUTURE.
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
s A and B
♪ ♪
♪ I'M SO SORRY ♪
♪ ♪
>> THE REST WE DON'T KNOW.
I WANT TO BE A GOOD MAN, JUST 
FOR YOU.
>> OH, WELL.
>> JUST FOR YOU.
>> THE REST IS IN KOREAN.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
THE NUMBER ONE SONG ON THE 
CHARTS.
>> IF YOU WERE ABLE TO SING THE 
KOREAN PART, I WOULD BE VERY 
IMPRESSED.
>> MY TWO KOREAN WORDS, THAT'S 
IT.
MAKIN' LOVE IS THE NUMBER ONE 
SONG IN SINGAPORE AND BELONGS TO
THE SOUTH KOREAN BOY BAND, BTS 
OF COURSE.
AS YOU SAW THE ICONIC MARINA BAY
SANDS HOTEL.
>> HAVE YOU STAYED AT THAT 
HOTEL?
>> I DON'T MEAN TO NAME DROP, 
BUT JUST TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS 
THERE, SUITE 3604.
>> LOTS OF PEOPLE GO THERE.
BUT GUESS WHO ELSE WAS THERE?
KIM JONG UN WAS CHECKING IT OUT,
PART OF HIS TOUR OF SINGAPORE 
BEFORE HE MET WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
>> REALLY?
>> KIND OF AN INTERESTING 
DYNAMIC.
BECAUSE SINGAPORE IS KIND OF 
VIEWED AS THIS EXAMPLE FOR THE 
DEVELOPED WORLD.
SO ADVANCED.
NORTH KOREA IS NOT, SUFFICE IT 
TO SAY.
SO I WONDER IF KIM JONG UN, AS 
HE'S LOOKING AROUND THIS, AT 
THIS PLACE IS WONDERING, DOES HE
ASPIRE TO BRING NORTH KOREA TO 
THAT POINT?
>> EXACTLY.
OR SAYING THIS IS EVERYTHING 
THAT'S WRONG WITH CAPITALISM, 
ALL THREE TOWERS OF THE MARINA 
BAY SANDS.
BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW HE HAS HIS
BODY GUARDS THERE GIVING THEM A 
BREAK FROM RUNNING ALONGSIDE 
THEM AS HE TAKES HIS TOUR.
BUT FASCINATING SIGHT.
>> LOTS OF BODYGUARDS, 
PHOTOGRAPHERS AND VIDEOGRAPHERS 
AS WELL.
>> SO WHY SINGAPORE AND WHY 
RIGHT NOW?
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WONDERING 
THAT.
>> LET'S TALK LOCATION.
SINGAPORE'S IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
AND HAS THE INTERESTING 
DISTINCTION OF BEING A SOVEREIGN
CITY STATE, KIND OF LIKE MONACO 
AND VATICAN CITY.
5.6 MILLION RESIDENTS, THE 
GLOBAL COMMERCE HUB AS WELL.
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THE 
HISTORY FOR SINGAPORE, YOU KNOW,
THE MALAYSIANS ARE LIKE, WE 
DON'T WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF 
US.
AND SO THEY GAVE THAT LAND AND 
SAID WE'LL SUPPLY YOU WITH 
WATER, AND YOU CAN JUST DO YOUR 
OWN THING. 
>> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
>> THE MALAYSIANS WANTED TO BE 
THEIR OWN MUSLIM COUNTRY, AND 
NOW SOME 60 YEARS LATER, 
SINGAPORE IS WAY MORE SUCCESSFUL
AND SELLING WATER BACK TO THE 
MALAYSIANS.
>> SINGAPORE LOOKS TO ME TO BE 
SIMILAR TO DUBAI.
IS IT?
YOU'VE BEEN TO BOTH.
>> IT IS SIMILAR, AND BOTH SEEM 
TO BE CITIES OF THE FUTURE.
DUBAI IS A LOT MORE STRICT.
BUT SINGAPORE'S STRICT AS WELL.
THEY'RE BOTH STRICT.
>> NOT STRICT ENOUGH.
CLEARLY NOT STRICT ENOUGH, 
BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED THIS TO 
HAPPEN.
>> THEY, YEAH.
THEY WILL LET ANYBODY IN.
THEY JUST WON'T LET YOU OUT. 
>> NICE FLOATIES, BUDDY.
>> AH, SINGAPORE.
SORRY, APOLOGIES ALL AROUND.
>>> GOOD MORNING.
I'M DIANE MACEDO.
>> I'M KENDIS GIBSON.
HERE ARE SOME OF THE TOP 
HEADLINES WE'RE FOLLOWING ON 
"WORLD NEWS NOW."
THE HISTORIC HANDSHAKE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HIS MEETING
WITH KIM JONG UN WENT BETTER 
THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED.
THE TWO LEADERS DECLARING A 
BETTER RELATIONSHIP GOING 
FORWARD AND SIGNING A LETTER 
THEY DESCRIBED AS VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE BUT OFFERED FEW 
DETAILS.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD 
MEET WITH KIM MANY TIMES AND 
ADDED THAT HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY 
INVITE KIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE, 
BUT GAVE NO INDICATION ON WHAT, 
WHEN THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE.
>>> AND THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 
ECONOMIC ADVISER, LARRY KUDLOW 
HAS SUFFERED A SMALL HEART 
ATTACK WE'RE TOLD.
HE WAS WORKING ON TRADE POLICIES
AND JOINED THE PRESIDENT IN 
QUEBEC, CANADA FOR THE 
CONTENTIOUS G7 SUMMIT.
THE WHITE HOUSE EXPECTS HE WILL 
MAKE A FULL RECOVERY.
>>> A FAMILY OF FIVE IS DEAD 
AFTER AN EXPLOSION AT THEIR 
WEEKEND CABIN IN SEATTLE.
FOUL PLAY IS NOT SUSPECTED.
THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR TOP 
STORIES.
>>> FROM ABC NEWS, THIS IS 
"WORLD NEWS NOW."
>> WE SAY GOOD MORNING ON THIS 
REALLY BIG TUESDAY MORNING WITH 
THE LANDMARK SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE
TAKING PLACE AIMED AT RIDDING 
NORTH KOREA OF ITS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.
>> SHORTLY AFTER THIS 
EXTRAORDINARY FIRST HAND SHAKE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DECLARED THAT HE
HAS AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP 
WITH COUPLEKIM JONG UN AND KIM  
CALLING IT A PRELUDE FOR PEACE.
KAREN, WE WERE WATCHING FROM 
HERE IN AMAZEMENT, WHAT'S THE 
REACTION THERE?
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
AFTER ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF 
MEETINGS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
KIM JONG UN AS YOU SAY SIGNED A 
JOINT STATEMENT.
THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT 
COMPREHENSIVE AND IMPORTANT.
KIM JONG UN CALLED IT HISTORIC, 
BUT DIANE AND KENDIS, NEITHER OF
THEM ACTUALLY SAID WHAT WAS IN 
IT.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE SUMMIT, 
THOUGH, WENT BETTER THAN HE 
PREDICTED.
A MOMENT FOR HISTORY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN 
SHAKING HANDS.
THE FIRST SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT
TO MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER.
MR. TRUMP AND KIM ALL SMILES 
AHEAD OF THEIR ONE ON ONE 
MEETING.
NO AIDES WITH THEM, JUST THEIR 
TRANSLATORS.
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT 
DISCUSSION AND TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS.
WE'LL BE TREMENDOUSLY 
SUCCESSFUL.
IT'S MY HONOR, AND WE WILL HAVE 
A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP, I HAVE 
NO DOUBT.
>> Reporter: LATER U.S. AND 
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIALS JOINING 
FOR A MEETING AND WORKING LUNCH.
THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT TAKES PLACE
ON SINGAPORE'S SENTOSA ISLAND.
THAT MEANS PEACE AND 
TRANQUILITY, FITTING FOR WHAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING A 
MISSION OF PEACE.
THEY HAVE BEEN MEETING HERE IN 
SINGAPORE, WORKING TOWARD A 
JOINT STATEMENT THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN COULD SIGN
AFTER THEIR MEETINGS.
MIKE POMPEO SAYS A COMPLETE, 
VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA 
IS THE ONLY OUTCOME THE U.S. 
WILL ACCEPT.
>> IN EACH OF THOSE TWO 
COUNTRIES, THERE ARE ONLY TWO 
PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS 
OF THIS MAGNITUDE, AND THOSE TWO
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SITTING 
IN A ROOM TOGETHER.
>> Reporter: BUT THERE ARE KEY 
DIFFERENCES ON THE ISSUE OF DIE 
NUCLEARIZATION.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
SIGNALED THEY WANT THE PROCESS 
TO HAPPEN QUICKLY, PERHAPS ALL 
AT ONCE.
NORTH KOREA WANTS A PHASED 
APPROACH, DISMANTLING IN PHASES 
AND GETTING SOMETHING IN RETURN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HOLD A 
PRESS CONFERENCE BEFORE HE MAKES
THE LONG TRIP BACK TO 
WASHINGTON.
HE WAS ASKED IF HE PLANNED TO 
ASK PRESIDENT TRUMP KIM-- KIM J 
UN TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND HE 
SAID HE WILL.
HE PREDICTED THEY WOULD MEET 
MANY TIMES.
>> HOW TO WE GO FORWARD WITH 
WHATEVER WAS SIGNED IN THIS 
LETTER.
CAN THESE TWO MEN TRUST EACH 
OTHER?
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT WAS 
CERTAINLY GUSHING WITH PRAISE 
FOR KIM JONG UN.
HE SAID SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS A 
GREAT HONOR TO MEET HIM.
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT YET WHAT 
WAS IN THAT JOINT STATEMENT.
THE PRESIDENT, ALWAYS A TV 
PRODUCER, GIVING A BIT OF A 
SUSPENSE THERE, SAYING HE WOULD 
TALK TO REPORTERS IN A COUPLE OF
HOURS AND GIVE DETAILS AT THAT 
POINT.
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT 
OF A CLUE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 
THE PROCESS OF DENUCLEARIZATION,
AND HE SAID HE EXPECTS THAT WILL
BEGIN PRETTY QUICKLY.
SO I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THEY 
GOT FURTHER ALONG THAN MAYBE 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN 
PREDICTING OVER THE LAST FEW 
DAYS.
THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS A PROCESS
NOW THAT THEY HAVE SET OUT FOR 
NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP ITS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
>> ALL RIGHT, OUR KAREN TRAVERS 
THERE IN SINGAPORE WITH THE VERY
LATEST ON WHAT HAS BEEN AN 
AMAZING, INCREDIBLE DAY IN 
HISTORY, KAREN, THANK YOU.
>> AND WE ACTUALLY ARE GETTING 
THAT DOCUMENT RIGHT NOW.
LET'S GO OVER TO OUR 
CONTRIBUTOR, STEVE GANYARD FROM 
WASHINGTON, PICK OUT SOME OF THE
HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU'RE SITTING 
HERE.
>> I'M SITTING HERE ON MY iPHONE
TRYING TO EXPAND.
>> THERE SEEM TO BE ABOUT FOUR 
DIFFERENT POINTS IN THIS 
DOCUMENT, AND IT SEEMS AS IF 
SOME OF THEM ARE REALLY 
SIGNIFICANT.
>> YES, THE TWO THAT STUCK OUT 
WITH ME IS SECURITY GUARANTEES 
FROM THE U.S.
SECRETARY POMPEO HINTED AT THIS 
IN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS.
THIS IS THE U.S. SAYING, LOOK, 
WE PROMISE NOTHING WILL HAPPEN 
TO YOU.
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.
WE'RE GOING FROM A STATE OF 
NEAR-WAR TO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
CARE OF YOU.
THE OTHER PART HERE IS THE 
COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZATION 
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
NOT OF NORTH KOREA.
THIS IS A BIT OF A CONCESSION AS
WELL.
THIS IS WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN 
STYLE OF NEGOTIATION HAS ALWAYS 
HELD THAT IT NEEDS TO BE, THE 
U.S. NEEDS TO GET ITS NUKES OFF 
OF SOUTH KOREA AS WELL.
SO THOSE HAVE BEEN GONE FOR 
QUITE A WHILE, BUT THE FACT IS 
THAT SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE ON NO
NUKES ON THE PENINSULA.
AND THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE ANY 
KIND OF U.S. NUKES THAT MIGHT BE
IN THE VICINITY AS WELL.
>> THERE'S SOME TALK ABOUT 
RECOVERING P.O.W. REMAINS.
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THAT?
>> THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
THERE ARE, I CAN'T REMEMBER THE 
EXACT NUMBER, BUT THOUSANDS OF 
MISSING P.O.W.s AND REMAINS THAT
HAVE NOT BEEN REPATRIATED.
YOU REMEMBER THAT WE'VE HAD A 
LONG HISTORY WITH VIETNAM OF, 
EVEN WHEN WE WEREN'T GETTING 
ALONG WITH VIETNAM AFTER THE 
WAR, OF THEM HELPING US TO 
REPATRIATE REMAINS OF MIAs AND 
SO THIS IS A BIG DEAL.
WE LOST 36,000, 37,000 PEOPLE IN
THAT WAR, THE U.S. DID ALONE, 
AND MANY OF THOSE NEVER CAME 
HOME AND WERE NEVER FOUND.
SO THIS IS A BIG STEP.
THE ONE THING YOU'LL NOTICE IS 
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN PRIME 
MINISTER ABE MET WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP?
AND HE SAID PLEASE, SEE WHAT YOU
CAN DO ABOUT BRINGING HOME THE 
ABDUCTEES, THE JAPANESE 
ABDUCTEES.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MENTIONED 
THERE.
SO THIS LOOKS TO BE PRETTY MUCH,
THIS IS WHAT THE U.S. WANTS AND 
LET'S DEAL WITH THE OTHER 
DETAILS THAT OTHER COUNTRIES 
WANT LATER.
>> IT IS THE VERY FIRST DAY.
AND EVEN THE LETTER ITSELF WAS A
SURPRISE THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
BE SIGNING ANY KIND OF AN 
AGREEMENT.
YOU KNOW THE DYNAMICS OF THAT 
REGION.
ANYTHING THAT KIM JONG UN DID 
TODAY, DID IT HAVE THE 
PERMISSION AND GUIDANCE OF CHINA
IN 
>> ?
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
THEY WERE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AT 
SENIOR LEVELS WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT AND SAYING YOU DO 
THIS, YOU DENUCLEARIZE AND WE 
WILL GUARANTEE YOUR SURVIVAL.
NO DOUBT THE CHINESE HAVE DONE 
SOMETHING SIMILAR.
REMEMBER THAT KIM HAS MADE TWO 
SURREPTITIOUS VISITS TO BEIJING 
IN THE PAST MONTH OR SO.
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE 
CHINESE WERE DOING THERE, SAYING
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS DONE AND 
PERHAPS WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU 
AS WELL.
SO LOTS OF REASSURANCES WENT IN 
BEHIND THE SCENES TO GET TO 
WHERE WE WERE TODAY.
THIS WAS NOT KIM JUST DIVING 
INTO THE POOL SAYING, OKAY, 
LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT.
I THINK THAT HE HAD LOTS OF 
ASSURANCES FROM BOTH THE U.S., 
SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA.
>> AND STEVE, REALLY QUICK.
I KNOW YOU SAID DENUCLEARIZATION
DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT A PEACE 
TR
TREATY AS WELL WITH SOUTH CRAY.
HOW
 -- KOREA, HOW MUCH OF A GAME 
CHANGER IS THIS?
>> PRESIDENT MOON HAS BEEN A 
DRIVING FORCE IN THIS.
HE HAS HIS OWN INTEREST.
HE HAS BEEN RUNNING ON A 
PLATFORM THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO OR
HE WAS PUSHING FOR 
REUNIFICATION.
REMEMBER THAT KIM JONG UN'S 
GRANDFATHER, WHEN THEY STARTED 
THE WHOLE IDEOLOGY OF NORTH 
KOREA, THAT WAS BASED ON 
REUNIFICATION OF THE PENINSULA.
SO BOTH SOUTH KOREA AND JUJU 
TALKS ABOUT THEIR.
B
-- THIS, BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH 
KOREA WANT TO REUNIFY FOR 
DIFFERENT REASONS.
THIS WILL ALLOW PRESIDENT MOON 
TO WORK ON THAT PEACE TREATY.
IT'S GOT TO BE A PEACE TREATY 
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH 
KOREA.
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY BACK IN 1950
A CIVIL WAR.
AND THAT CIVIL WAR HAS TO BE 
ENDED BY THE COMBATANTS.
NOT THE U.S.
>> THANK YOU.
AND THE START OF THAT HISTORIC 
SUMMIT HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL 
EVENT FOR ANOTHER MAN, ONE 
CONSIDERED A FRIEND BY BOTH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN.
>> BUT REALLY, HE WAS THE 
AMBASSADOR WHO BROKERED THIS, 
LET'S BE HONEST.
THE BASKETBALL HALL-OF-FAMER, 
DENNIS RODMAN.
THE IMAGES FROM SINGAPORE 
BROUGHT THE FORMER DETROIT 
PISTONS BAD BOY TO TEARS.
>> I KNEW IT.
I NEVER HAD NO ONE TO HEAR ME!
I HAD NO ONE TO SEE ME!
BUT I KEPT THOSE BULLETS, I TOOK
ALL THAT.
EVERYONE CAME AT ME.
AND I'M STILL STANDING.
BUT TODAY IS A GREAT DAY FOR 
EVERYBODY.
SINGAPORE, TOKYO, CHINA, IT'S A 
GREAT DAY!
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, THE FACT 
THAT I SOMEWHAT HAD SOMETHING TO
DO WITH THIS NORTH KOREA 
SITUATION, BUT I DON'T WANT TO 
TAKE ANY CREDIT, WHERE CREDIT'S 
DUE, WE ALL NEED TO TAKE CREDIT.
I'M SO THANKFUL TO BE HERE.
I'M GLAD THE FACT THIS IS 
HAPPENING.
I SAW IT, THE WORLD SAW IT, MY 
KIDS SAW IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S HOPE FOR THE BEST.
>> HE'S HOPING FOR THE BEST.
DENNIS RODMAN TAKING A LITTLE 
BIT OF CREDIT THERE.
>> AND GETTING EMOTIONAL.
YOU SEE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS
FACE.
>> TALKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE 
EMBASSY IN PYONGYANG.
MAYBE AMBASSADOR?
FOR RODMAN?
WEIRDER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.
COME ON.
>> INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMACY, KIM 
KARDASHIAN IS GETTING PRISONERS 
OUT, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
>>> THE OTHER MAJOR TELEVISION 
EVENT OF THE NIGHT.
BECCA'S QUEST FOR LOVE, OF 
COURSE.
SEE HOW THINGS GOT A LITTLE 
ROUGH AT THE BACHELORETTE 
MANSION.
AND ALSO MORE FROM SINGAPORE.
YOU'RE WATCHING "WORLD NEWS 
NOW."
>>> YOU'RE TAKING A LIVE LOOK AT
SINGAPORE, WHERE WE JUST SAW THE
HISTORIC MOMENT OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN SIGNING AN
AGREEMENT TOGETHER.
THE HIGHLIGHTS SO FAR ARE 
PROMISE OF PROTECTION FROM THE 
UNITED STATES AND A PROMISE OF 
DISARMAMENT OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA FROM KIM JONG UN.
>> IT'S ONLY TUESDAY, BUT IT'S 
BEEN A BUSY, BUSY COUPLE OF DAYS
FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, 
COUPLE FEW DAYS IN FACT.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RIGHT 
NOW SLAPPING NEW SANCTIONS ON 
RUSSIANS AND RUSSIAN COMPANIES 
FOR BEING INVOLVED IN 
CYBERATTACKS.
>> FIVE RUSSIAN FIRMS AND THREE 
EXECUTIVES ARE ON THE NEW 
SANCTIONS LIST.
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS ALL OF 
THEM ENGAGED IN CYBERATTACKS OR 
ASSISTED WITH OTHER MALICIOUS 
ACTIVITIES.
>>> WE'RE GETTING NEW DETAILS 
THIS MORNING ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH
MONEY THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER 
AND SON-IN-LAW ARE BRINGING IN.
NEWLY RELEASED FINANCIAL 
DISCLOSURE FORMS REPORT THEY 
EARNED MORE THAN $08 M80 MILLIO 
OUTSIDE THEIR JOBS IN THE 
GOVERNMENT.
THE COUPLE'S ATTORNEY SAYS THEY 
FOLLOWED ALL ETHICS RULES.
>>> AND A FAMILY OF FIVE IS DEAD
AFTER AN EXPLOSION DESTROYED A 
CABIN IN WASHINGTON STATE.
>> THE CABIN INCLUDED THREE 
BOYS, AGES 2, 8, AND 11.
THEY USED IT FREQUENTLY FOR 
WEEKEND GET AWAYS.
IT WAS IN THE TOWN OF BRENNAN, 
ABOUT 30 MILES WEST OF SEATTLE.
THE CAUSE IS UNDER 
INVESTIGATION.
BUT OFFICIALS SAY THEY DO NOT 
SUSPECT FOUL PLAY.
>>> AND WE'RE GETTING THE FIRST 
LOOK AT THE MOMENT A SUV HIT A 
VERY HEAVY PRICE AT A FLORIDA 
TOLL PLAZA.
THIS IS A CADILLAC SRX THAT 
SLAMMED INTO A BARRIER NEAR ST. 
CLOUD, FLORIDA.
FIVE PEOPLE WERE INSIDE THE 
VEHICLE, ONE EJECTED.
BUT EVERYONE SURVIVED AND IS 
EXPECTED TO BE PHYSICALLY OKAY 
IN THE END.
POLICE SAY THE DRIVER APPEARS TO
HAVE BEEN TIRED AND CITED FOR 
OCCAS
CARELESS DRIVING.
>>> ST. BERNARDS' REPUTATION ARE
BUILT ON BEING RESCUE DOGS.
SAVING HIKERS IN THE ALPS.
>> ONE OF THE DOGS NEEDED A 
LITTLE HELP OF ITS OWN IN 
MINNESOTA.
THAT'S WHISKEY SITTING ON AN 
OVERHANG IN MINNEAPOLIS.
HIS OWNER'S MOM WAS DOG SITTING 
WHEN HE MANAGED TO PUSH OUT A 
SCREEN AND WANDER OUT ONTO THE 
TOP THERE OF THE ROOF.
>> AS YOU DO.
>> YEAH.
>> FIREFIGHTERS DID MANAGE TO 
GET THE 100-POUND-PLUS DOG BACK 
INSIDE.
PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE THAN THE 
CAT IN THE TREE PHONE CALL.
DID WHISKEY HAVE A LITTLE TOO 
MUCH WHISKEY?
>> WHISKEY'S BEEN HITTING THE 
BOTTLE.
>> HE LOOKED PRETTY CALM OUT 
THERE.
>>> COMING UP, WE'LL HAVE MUCH 
MORE LIVE FROM SINGAPORE.
>> INCLUDING A LOOK AT THE MEDIA
FRENZY SURROUNDING THE SUMMIT.
JAMES LONGMAN IS STANDING BY, 
AND WE'LL GET THE LATEST FROM 
HIM NEXT ON "WORLD NEWS NOW."
>>> AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED A 
VERY, A VERY SPECIAL BOND, SO 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
IMPRESSED.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
HAPPY, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
CARE OF A VERY BIG AND VERY 
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD.
AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN 
KIM.
>> THAT'S FROM THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT WAS HELD EARLIER
THIS MORNING WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND KIM JONG UN, SHAKING HANDS 
YET AGAIN THERE ON SENTOSA 
ISLAND NEAR THE CITY OF 
SINGAPORE.
ABC'S JAMES LONGMAN WHO HAS BEEN
COVERING THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG UN JOINS US NOW LIVE.
>> JAMES, WE WERE TALKING TO YOU
A FEW MINUTES AGO. YOU CALLED 
THIS A SURREAL TRIP.
DESCRIBE FOR US WHAT IT'S LIKE 
TO BE THERE.
>> Reporter: DIANE, KENDIS, I 
HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS.
BEING HERE IN SINGAPORE, 
WITNESSING A NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR, THE DICTATOR OF 
POSSIBLY THE MOST BRUTAL 
DICTATORSHIP ON EARTH, WANDER 
AROUND THERE, DOWNTOWN SINGAPORE
LAST NIGHT WAS VERY, VERY 
STRANGE.
IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
WE WERE IN OUR HOTEL HERE IN 
CENTRAL SINGAPORE, AND WE 
SUDDENLY GOT WORD THAT HIS 
MOTORCADE HAD LEFT HIS HOTEL.
WE THOUGHT WAIT A MINUTE, THAT 
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
THAT WASN'T SCRIPTED.
SO WE RUSHED TO OUR TVS TO WATCH
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
AND SURE ENOUGH, HIS BULLETPROOF
MERCEDES HAD PULLED UP IN 
DOWNTOWN SING IMPORTANT.
OUT HE G-- SINGAPORE, OUT HE GO,
FOLLOWED BY THE GUYS THAT JOG 
ALONG HIS MOTORCADE, THEY WERE 
THERE TOO.
THEN HE STARTS CROSSING OVER 
THIS BRIDGE, WAVING AT PEOPLE, 
TAKING SELFIES.
THIS MAN HAS BEEN, PEOPLE ALLEGE
THAT HE HAS KILLED THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY, 
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY TO 
CONSOLIDATE POWER IN NORTH 
KOREA, AND HERE HE IS IN 
SINGAPORE, WHAT IS THE ENVY OF 
ASIA IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT, WANDERING AROUND, 
SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE.
AT ONE POINT HE TOOK A SELFIE 
WITH A MEMBER OF THE SINGAPOREAN
GOVERNMENT.
IT WAS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.
THEN HE TOOK A TOUR OF THAT 
BUILDING THERE, THE MARINA BAY 
SANDS HOTEL.
THERE'S A COASINO IN THERE.
THE IDEA THAT A DICTATOR OF A 
COMMUNIST REGIME WOULD TAKE A 
TOUR OF A CASINO IS REALLY QUITE
SOMETHING.
BUT I GUESS THAT'S THE SHOWMAN.
THAT'S THE SHOWMAN IN KIM JONG 
UN.
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT BETTER 
SHOWMAN FOR HIM TO MEET THAN 
DONALD TRUMP.
BOTH OF THEM CERTAINLY LIKE A 
GAMBLE.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE 
SEEN.
I THINK FOR ME, WATCHING ALL 
THIS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY BUT 
ALSO SEEING WHAT KIM JONG UN IS 
FACED WITH WHEN HE STEPS OUT OF 
HIS BUBBLE.
WE SAW IT A FEW MOMENTS AGO, HE 
WAS OUT IN THE GARDENS OUTSIDE 
THE RESORT.
AND I WAS BEING SHOUTED 
QUESTIONS OUT BY REPORTERS.
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY.
>> ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY 
INDEED, CONSIDERING WE HAVEN'T 
HEARD MUCH FROM THIS MAN FOR 
DECADES OR FOR YEARS.
JAMES, REALLY, REALLY QUICKLY.
WE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS 
SUMMIT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO.
IT HAS TAKEN A HERCULESEN EFFORT
TO GET YOU GUYS THERE.
TELL US ABOUT THE MEDIA FRENZY 
THERE.
>> Reporter: I MEAN, EVERY 
SINGLE MEDIA ORGANIZATION IS IN 
SINGAPORE.
THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER ENORMOUS 
HOTELS AT GREAT EXPENSE.
THE SINGAPOREN GOVERNMENT HAS 
SPENT SOMETHING LIKE $15 MILLION
FOR THIS EVENT, BUT I THINK 
THEY'RE GOING TO REAP THAT BACK 
BY ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COM
>>> IT'S GOING TO BOOST YOUR 
MODELING CAREER.
WHAT'S THE LOOK THAT I'M GETTING
RIGHT NOW?
WHAT'S THAT ONE CALLED?
IT'S LIKE THE PENSIVE LOOK?
IS THIS THE CLINT EASTWOOD?
>> GUESS WHAT?
ATTACHED TO ME IS 
PROFESSIONALITY.
IT'S THE WAY I WALK AND THE WAY 
I TALK.
PROFESSIONALITY.
>> NAILED IT, BRO.
>> IT'S THE WAY I TALK.
PROFESSIONALITY.
THAT WAS JORDAN AND DAVID, 
GETTING INTO IT ON "THE 
BACHELORETTE" LAST NIGHT.
JUST TWO OF THE POTENTIAL 
CATCHES FOR BECCA.
>> AND BACK WITH US LIVE IS OUR 
CHIEF SENIOR GLOBAL BACHELOR 
ANALYST.
HE SKIPPED OUT ON THE SUMMIT TO 
BE WITH US.
>> I KNOW WE'RE MISSING OUT ON 
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD 
ABOUT THIS ONE, BUT WE'RE BACK 
HERE FOR ANOTHER SEASON OF "THE 
BACHELORETTE."
15 GUYS STARTED THIS WHOLE THING
LAST NIGHT.
THINGS GOT A LITTLE ROUGH IN THE
MANSION.
AND SO, ROLL THAT BEAUTIFUL 
BACHELORETTE FOOTAGE.
>> ONE FOR ONE.
>> AGRO AMONGST THE MEN, JORDAN 
THE MODEL VERSUS DAVID, THE GUY 
IN THE CHICKEN SUIT.
>> YOU ARE A SKELETON OF A MAN.
>> SPA FOR A GROUP DATE.
>> OH, HO, HO.
>> PERFECT PLACE TO WORK THINGS 
OUT BETWEEN COLTON AND BECCA.
BECCA AND COLTON WORKED THINGS 
OUT.
>> ARE YOU READY FOR THIS FOR 
ME?
>> YES.
>> COLTON GETS A ROSE.
ONE ON ONE DATE WITH CHRIS.
AH, IT'S RICHARD MARX, WRITING 
LOVE SONGS FOR EACH OTHER.
>> THE IDEA AT THE END OF THIS 
IS WHAT I WANT TO ENVISION THE 
MOST.
>> CHRIS DID WELL.
CHRIS GOT A ROSE.
WE HAVE AN INJURY!
>> HE FELL OUT OF BED.
LANDED ON HIS FACE.
>> ANOTHER INJURY ON THE GROUP 
DATE.
CLAY, THE FOOTBALL PLAYER, HURT,
PLAYING FOOTBALL.
KISS COUNT, KISS COUNT, THE KISS
COUNT STOPS AT TEN!
>> TEN!
>> TEN FOR THE KISS COUNT, SO.
>> WOW!
>> SO BECCA, NO DOUBT, SHE 
REALLY GOT THE WORK AT THE END 
OF THIS ONE.
IF THERE WERE ANY QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHETHER SHE WAS FULLY 
COMMITTED, AFTER A KISS COUNT OF
TEN, SHE IS DEFINITELY FULLY 
COMMITTED, LET'S PUT IT THAT 
WAY.
>> ANY PREDICTIONS?
>> YEAH, THE ANALYST PREDICTS 
BLAKE WILL BE THE WINNER.
>> BLAKE.
>> YES, BLAKE AND BECCA ARE 
ENGAGED.
SO SAID THE ANALYST.
THEY ARE GOING TO THE CHAPEL.
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.
>>> THIS MORNING ON "WORLD NEWS 
NOW," SPECIAL EDITION.
TRUMP AND KIM, THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT.
>> THE TWO PARTY LEADERS HAVE 
PARTED WAYS AFTER SEVERAL HOURS,
THEY SIGNED A DOCUMENT.
COMPLETE COVERAGE AHEAD.
WE ARE LIVE IN SINGAPORE ON 
TUESDAY, JUNE 12th.
>> FROM ABC NEWS, THIS IS "WORLD
NEWS NOW."
>> YES, IT IS.
AND WE'RE GOING TO START THIS 
HALF HOUR WITH THE FACE-TO-FACE,
THE HANDSHAKE, MAN-TO-MAN, 
MEETING NORTH KOREA AS ENDING 
DECADES OF HOSTILITY.
THE PRESIDENT THERE WITH THAT 
DICTATOR FOR THE FIRST TIME.
>> A STUNNING SIGHT ON THE WORLD
STAGE.
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN 
SHOOK HANDS, EXCHANGED 
PLEASANTRIES, A FEW PATS ON THE 
BACK.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE WILL BE
MANY MORE MEETINGS AND MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT KIM IS WELCOME AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
KAREN TRAVERS JOINS US LIVE FROM
SINGAPORE.
GOOD MORNING, KAREN.
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
THEY MET FOR ABOUT FOUR AND A 
HALF HOURS HERE IN SINGAPORE, 
AND AFTERWARDS, THEY SIGNED A 
JOINT STATEMENT.
THE PRESIDENT CALLED IT 
HISTORIC.
HE CALLED IT COMPREHENSIVE.
BUT THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY 
WHAT WAS IN THE STATEMENT.
WE GOT A LOOK AT IT, BUT WE CAN 
TALK ABOUT THAT.
AS WE TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO SAY 
BEFORE HE SAID FAREWELL TO KIM 
JONG UN HERE IN SINGAPORE.
>> SO WE'RE SIGNING A VERY 
IMPORTANT DOCUMENT.
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.
AND WE'VE HAD A REALLY GREAT 
TERM TOGETHER, A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP.
>> Translator: TODAY WE HAVE A 
HISTORIC MEETING AND DECIDED TO 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND, AND WE 
ARE ABOUT TO SIGN THE HISTORIC 
DOCUMENT.
>> Translator: THE WORLD WILL 
SEE A MAJOR CHANGE.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY 
GRATITUDE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
MAKE THIS MEETING HAPPEN.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Reporter: AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
WITH A LOT OF PRAISE FOR KIM 
JONG UN AND AS HE CALLED HIM A 
GREAT NEGOTIATOR WHO IS WORKING 
ON BEHALF OF HIS COUNTRY.
HE SAID SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS A 
GREAT HONOR TO MEET WITH HIM AND
CALLED HIM VERY TALENTED.
>> AND KAREN, WE'RE NOW GETTING 
A LOOK AT THIS DOCUMENT AND THIS
AGREEMENT, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE 
HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU ARE PICKING 
OUT?
IT SEEMS TWO BIG STANDOUTS SEEM 
TO BE THE PROMISE OF SECURITY 
AND PROTECTION FOR NORTH KOREA 
AND THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT 
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT OF THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA.
>> Reporter: THOSE WERE THE TWO 
BIG ISSUES GOING INTO THIS 
ONE-DAY SUMMIT.
AND BASED ON OUR LOOK AT THIS 
LETTER, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 
HASN'T TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT THE 
UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AGREEING TO SECURITY 
GUARANTEES FOR NORTH KOREA.
WE, OF COURSE, ASKING THE WHITE 
HOUSE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
AND WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE WEEKS 
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT.
HE HAS SAID THAT KIM JONG UN 
WILL HAVE PROTECTIONS AND 
SECURITIES AND ALSO A PROMISE 
THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT 
PURSUE A POLICY OF REGIME 
CHANGE.
THAT'S OF COURSE A VERY BIG DEAL
FOR KIM JONG UN.
BECAUSE HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE
HIS LEVERAGE ON THE GLOBAL 
STAGE.
IF HE GIVES THEM UP, EVEN IN A 
SLOWER PROCESS, HE LOSES THAT 
LEVERAGE.
SO THE PRESIDENT'S SAYING A 
COUPLE WEEKS AGO, KIM JONG UN 
WILL KEEP HIS JOB AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WILL HELP 
GUARANTEE THAT.
>> WHAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE 
THERE IN SINGAPORE, BESIDES 
BEING HOT AND HUMID.
WHAT'S THE GENERAL FEEL THERE AS
YOU GO ABOUT THAT THIS IS, 
YOU'RE EYEWITNESS TO AN AMAZING,
HISTORICAL MOMENT THERE.
>> Reporter: THAT WAS AN 
INCREDIBLE FIRST MEETING, WHEN 
THINK WALKED OUT TOGETHER, THEY 
SHOOK HANDS.
THEY WERE VERY SERIOUS, THEIR 
EXPRESSIONS, BUT AS THEY WALKED 
AWAY FROM THE CAMERAS, KENDIS, 
THEY WERE ALL SMILES.
THERE WAS A LOT OF PHYSICAL 
CONTACT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND KIM JONG UN.
BOTH TRYING TO EXERT A LITTLE 
ALPHA DOG STATUS.
THIS WAS A NEUTRAL SITE.
NOBODY WAS HOSTING THE OTHER 
LEADER.
YOU GOT THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP WANTED TO SHOW HE WAS IN 
COMMAND OF THIS MEETING.
AT THE END OF THIS HE WAS ASKED 
IF HE WOULD INVITE KIM JONG UN 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
HE SAID ABSOLUTELY HE WILL.
HE ALSO PREDICTED THEY WOULD 
HAVE MANY MEETINGS.
AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO SAY, 
STAY TUNED, WE'LL SEE.
AND WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S DETAILS
ABOUT ANOTHER SIT-DOWN MAYBE 
SOMEWHERE IN ASIA.
WE'LL SEE.
>> HE SAID THAT THEY'RE TAKING 
CARE OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR 
THE WORLD.
PRESUMABLY REFERRING TO NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS THERE.
BUT THE STAKES ARE HIGH FOR THE 
WORLD, BUT PARTICULARLY FOR 
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA.
WHAT ARE THE PERCEPTIONS THERE?
>> Reporter: WELL, THEY EACH 
HAVE THEIR OWN SECURITY 
INTERESTS.
YOU HAVE SOUTH KOREA, OF COURSE,
SHARING THE PENINSULA WITH NORTH
KOREA.
AND PRESIDENT MOON, THE 
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA HAS 
REALLY PLAYED A LEAD ROLE IN 
GETTING THIS MEETING TO EVEN 
HAPPEN.
HE WAS THE ONE THAT PRESENTED 
THE INVITATION TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BACK IN MARCH FROM KIM 
JONG UN, THE ONE THAT HE 
ACCEPTED VERY QUICKLY.
AND REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP CANCELED THIS MEETING A 
COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN THAT LETTER 
TO KIM JONG UN, IT WAS PRESIDENT
MOON WHO THEN VERY QUICKLY SET 
UP A MEETING WITH KIM TO TRY TO 
GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK.
JAPAN HAS BEEN MORE ON THE 
SIDELINES OF ALL OF THIS, PRIME 
MINISTER ABE HAS NOT MET WITH 
KIM JONG UN.
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SECURITY 
INTERESTS.
AND THEY WERE REALLY HOPING THAT
THE UNITED STATES WOULD ADD THAT
TO THEIR AGENDA, SHORT AND 
MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES.
NOT JUST THE ONES THAT CAN HIT 
THE U.S. MAINLAND, BUT THE ONES 
THAT CAN HIT JAPAN.
THEY'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE NORTH 
KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES 
ADDRESS HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.
THERE'S NO SUGGESTION OR 
INDICATION THAT THAT WAS PART OF
THESE DISCUSSIONS.
>> THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO JUST MOMENTS AGO TWEETING
A PHOTO OF PHONE CALLS HE HAD 
WITH THE LEADERS OF JAPAN AS 
WELL AS WITH SOUTH KOREA.
I'M ASSUMING HE GOT SOME 
ASSURANCES OVER TO THEM MOMENTS 
AGO.
WE'LL SEE.
KAREN TRAVERS THERE IN COOL 
SINGAPORE THERE ON THE EQUATOR, 
WITH A WIND CHILL OF 20, OH, 
WAIT, THAT'S IN CELSIUS.
IT'S HOT.
SORRY.
>> ENJOY THE HEAT, KAREN, THANK 
YOU.
>>> NOW LET'S GET A BREAK DOWN 
OF THIS WHOLE DAY AND WHAT THIS 
ALL MINES.
 -- MEANS.
>> FOR MORE INSIGHT, WE TURN TO 
TOM BOSSERT.
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING ALL OF 
THESE DEVELOPMENTS, AND IT LOOKS
REALLY NICE AS FAR AS A PHOTO 
OP, BUT THE REALITY IS WHAT?
>> GOOD MORNING.
IT'S HARD TO TRACK THE TIME 
HERE.
I AM LOOKING THROUGH THIS 
DOCUMENT THAT THEY SIGNED AND 
THE REALITY, KNOWING WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT WHAT WENT INTO THESE TALKS
TODAY IS THAT THE WORDS IN THIS 
DOCUMENT ARE TRULY HISTORIC.
IF THEY CAN MAKE GOOD ON THE 
WORDS IN THIS DOCUMENT, THIS IS 
A BLUEPRINT FOR PEACE AND A 
REVELATION.
>> AND TOM, I KNOW ONE OF THE 
BIG THINGS EVERYONE WAS LOOKING 
FOR, NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT.
IT SEEMS THAT APPEARS IN THIS 
DOCUMENT, APPLYING TO THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.
THAT'S A BIT OF A CONCESSION ON 
THE PART OF THE U.S., AND IN 
EXCHANGE, THE OUSU.S. IS PROMIS 
SECURITY.
WHAT DETERMINES IF THEY WALK 
AWAY CONSIDERING THEMSELVES 
WINNERS?
>> WELL, I THINK THAT BOTH OF 
THESE MEN SHOULD WALK AWAY 
CONSIDERING THEMSELVES WINNERS 
IF THEY TRULY MEAN WHAT THEY 
SAID IN THIS DOCUMENT.
I THINK YOU MADE A VERY GOOD 
POINT.
THEY COMMIT TO WORK TOWARD 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
KOREAN PENINSULA.
THAT DOESN'T JUST MEAN THE 
NORTH.
THAT MEANS THE SOUTH AS WELL.
NOW THE U.S. HASN'T HAD NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS IN SOUTH KOREA ON THE 
PENINSULA SINCE THE '90S, BUT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPLICATIONS 
THERE TO THE ENTIRE PENINSULA 
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
UNPACK.
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF 
TIME AND HARD WORK THERE.
I'M CERTAIN THAT NORTH KOREA WAS
INTERESTED IN THE PRESENCE OF 
U.S. BOMBERS.
THE CHINESE ARE INTERESTED IN 
THAT AS WELL.
THEY BELIEVE THE BOMBERS CAN 
DELIVER BOMBS.
THAT'S AN OBVIOUS EXTENSION OF 
THEIR CONCERN AND THEIR SAFETY, 
SECURITY ISSUES.
SO IF PRESIDENT TRUMP SEEMINGLY 
MEANS WHAT HE SAYS, HE HAS MADE 
CONCESSIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE 
SECURITY OF THE NORTH.
AND THE NORTH IN RETURN HAS 
CONCEDED TO WHAT I KNOW TO BE 
THE ASKS THAT WE WENT IN TO 
THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH, THEN I 
THINK THIS IS JUST TRULY 
REMARKABLE.
NOW I KNOW TALK IS CHEAP.
BUT REMEMBER, WE DIDN'T JUST SAY
DISARM.
WE SAID DISARM, DISABLE, 
DISMANTLE AND THEN PUT IN PLACE 
A LONG-TERM VERIFICATION 
PROCESS, WHICH WILL, I ASSUME, 
HAVE TO INCLUDE THE IAEA, THE 
ORGANIZATION THAT DOES THIS.
AND MAYBE EVEN SOME CHINESE 
SECURITY GUARANTEES.
SO THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.
AND IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE 
EVERY WORLD LEADER IN THAT 
REGION SOME TIME TO WORK THROUGH
THESE WORDS.
>> TOM BOSSERT THERE IN 
SINGAPORE.
THANK YOU, TOM.
SIGNIFICANT, AND JUST THE START.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PROMISING 
MANY MORE MEETINGS WITH KIM JONG
UN TO COME.
AND WE'LL BE WATCHING ALL THAT 
VERY CLOSELY.
>>> BUT WE'RE SEEING CONTRASTING
IMAGES IN THE STAFF AVAILABLE AT
THE SUMMIT.
>> FOR KIM JONG UN, THERE ARE 
GUYS WEARING SUITS WHO RUN 
ALONGSIDE HIS LIMOUSINE.
THESE WERE THE SCENES WE SAW AT 
THE DMZ JUST LAST MONTH.
>> THEY'VE GOT TO BE TIRED.
ESPECIALLY IN THAT HEAT.
>> AND BACK IN SINGAPORE AS 
WELL.
>> AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S STAFF 
INCLUDES A MAN WHO'S ALSO PRETTY
FIT.
>> WHOA!
>> HE IS KNOWN AS CHEF RUSH.
A FREELANCE CHEF AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
HE ALSO, BY THE WAY, HAS 24-INCH
BICEPS AND CAN BENCH 700 POUNDS.
>> WOW!
>> DO WE EVEN NEED SECURITY?
>> ARE WE SURE THIS ISN'T THE 
QUARTERBACK FOR THE CLEVELAND 
BROWNS?
WOW.
WE DON'T NEED ANY RUNNING 
BODYGUARDS WHEN YOU HAVE CHEF 
RUSH.
>> AND HE'LL COOK YOU UP A GREAT
DINNER, TOO.
BURGERS ANYONE?
>>> WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
LIGHTER SIDE OF THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT.
>> YEAH.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> YUM.
>> ANYBODY HUNGRY AT THIS HOUR?
>>> PLUS, THIS MORNING'S OTHER 
HEADLINES.
HOW THIS CAR ENDED UP HERE.
DANGLING FROM A PARKING 
STRUCTURE.
WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW THIS ALL 
PLAYED OUT, NEXT.
>>>WE'RE BACK WITH THESE IMAGES 
OF SINGAPORE IN THE MID 
AFTERNOON HOURS THERE.
THE HISTORIC SUMMIT IS NOW OVER 
BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
BOTH LEADERS ARE BASKING IN THE 
GLOW OF THAT SUMMIT.
>> HISTORY MADE WITH 
RAMIFICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.
BUT WE ALSO HAVE BREAKING NEWS 
OVERNIGHT HERE AT HOME.
A STANDOFF WITH POLICE IN 
ORLANDO HAS ENDED IN TRAGEDY.
>> FOUR YOUNG CHILDREN WHO HAD 
BEEN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 24 HOURS 
WERE FOUND DEAD.
POLICE SAY THEY ALSO FOUND THE 
GUNMAN DEAD FROM A 
SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND.
THE STANDOFF STARTED AFTER THE 
SUSPECT SHOT AND INJURED A 
POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS 
RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
CALL.
>> THE CHILDREN WERE AGES 1, 6, 
10, AND 11.
TWO OF THE CHILDREN WERE HIS.
THE MAN WAS ON PROBATION FOR 
ARSON AND OTHER CRIMES.
>> 1,10, AND 11.
WE ARE HEARING FROM THE EX-WIFE 
OF ANTHONY BOURDAIN FOR THE

AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER THERE SHAKING

AGAIN?
DEFINITELY HISTORY IN OUR TIME

>> A THUMBS UP SIGN THERE FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
AND PEOPLE IN THE WEST DON'T 
KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN 
NORTH KOREA OTHER THAN WHAT 
WE'VE HEARD FROM THOSE WHO'VE 
ESCAPED.
>> AND THE REST OF THE WORLD MAY
KNOW LESS ABOUT THE LEADER, KIM 
JONG UN.
CONSIDERED A RECLUSE, HE NOW HAS
A PRIME SPOT ON THE WORLD STAGE.
>> Reporter: HE IS THE 
36-YEAR-OLD LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA, KIM JONG UN.
THOUGH HIS OFFICIAL BIRTH DATE 
HAS NEVER BEEN CONFIRMED.
HIS FATHER WAS NORTH KOREA'S 
FOUNDER, KNOWN AS THE GREAT 
LEADER.
AND HIS FATHER, KIM JONG IL 
ASSUMED POWER WHEN HIS 
GRANDFATHER DIED.
KNOWN FOR THE WAY HE DRESSED, 
HIS PLATFORM SHOES AND HIS 
PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
AND HIS YOUNGEST SON KIM JONG UN
TOOK OVER.
KIM JONG UN HAS PROVEN TO BE 
RUTHLESS.
HE HAS NOW TESTED MORE MISSILES 
THAN HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER 
COMBINED.
HE'S CONDUCTED FOUR NUCLEAR 
TESTS.
LAST SEPTEMBER HE TESTED WHAT 
WAS BELIEVED TO BE A HYDROGEN 
BOMB, MUCH LARGER THAN THE BOMB 
DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA.
KNOWN AS THE SUPREME LEADER, THE
WORLD GOT A FIRST GLIMPSE AT HIS
FATHER'S FUNERAL IN 2011.
HE WAS ONE OF THE PALLBEARERS, 
CRYING AT HIS FATHER'S WAKE.
IT IS SAID THAT HIS FATHER LOVED
HIS FEARLESSNESS SHOWN WHEN HE 
WAS JUST A BOY.
AND AS NORTH KOREA'S LEADER HE 
HAS DEMONSTRATED HE IS WILLING 
TO KILL TO KEEP HIS POWER.
PUBLICLY ARRESTING AND EXECUTING
HIS OWN UNCLE, A ONCE TRUSTED 
ADVISER, BUT HE FEARED HIS UNCLE
WAS PLANNING A COUP.
IT'S ALSO BELIEVED HE WAS BEHIND
THE ASSASSINATION OF HIS HALF 
BROTHER, ONCE THOUGHT TO BE THE 
ORIGINAL HEIR TO THE KIM 
DYNASTY.
LAST YEAR THE WORLD SAW THE 
VIDEO OF THE TWO WOMEN SPRAYING 
A DEADLY NERVE AGENT IN HIS 
BROTHER'S FACE.
HE WAS DEAD WITHIN MINUTES.
IT IS THOUGHT HE HAS ALSO KILLED
MORE THAN 140 SENIOR OFFICIALS 
TO KEEP HIS GRIP ON POWER.
THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE HAVE 
STRUGGLED WITH LITTLE FOOD AND 
BLACKOUTS.

MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
>> Reporter: HE SERVED 18 MONTHS
BEFORE BEING RELEASED TO THE 
U.S. IN A COMA, EVENTUALLY DIED 
FROM HIS INJURIES.
HIS PARENTS ARE STILL DEMANDING 
ANSWERS.
OBEDIENCE IS DRILLED INTO NORTH 
KOREANS FROM A YOUNG AGE.
THERE IS PROPAGANDA EVERYWHERE.

STARVATION AND LABOR CAMPS.
AND THIS VIDEO OF A SOLDIER 
TRYING TO DEFECT.
SURVIVING A HAIL OF BULLETS.
THERE IS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT KIM 
JONG UN'S PERSONAL LIFE.
HE LOVES BASKETBALL, MICHAEL 
JORDAN.
HE LATER BECAME FRIENDS WITH 
DENNIS RODMAN.
HE IS MARRIED.
IT IS BELIEVED HE HAS THREE 
CHILDREN AND HIS WIFE IS MORE OF
A PUBLIC FIGURE IN NORTH KOREA.
IN A RARE CHANGE, SHE IS NOW 
CALLED RESPECTED FIRST LADY.
AND JUST THIS YEAR, KIM JONG UN 
AND HIS UNEXPECTED OLIVE BRANCH 
TO SOUTH KOREA.
IT WAS KIM JONG UN WHO SUGGESTED
SOUTH KOREA SHOULD WALK INTO THE
NORTH.
AND THEN HE DID THE SAME.
>> OUR THANKS TO DAVID MUIR FOR 
THAT REPORT.
COMING UP, THE LIGHTER SIDE OF 
THE SUMMIT.
>> A DOUBLE TAKE FLEX IN THE 
MIX.
IF YOU'RE AGE 50 TO 85,
AND LOOKING TO BUY LIFE
INSURANCE ON A FIXED BUDGET,
>>> IT IS TIME FOR THE MIX NOW.
A SPECIAL EDITION OF THE MIX.
WE SHOULD SAY.
>> IT'S A BIG DEAL.
>> MOVE OVER ROYAL WEDDING, 
THERE'S NEW SWAG IN TOWN.
FEAST YOUR EYES ON THE GOODY BAG
FOR THE SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE.
APPARENTLY, ANYONE AT THE MEDIA 
CENTER HAD THE PLEASURE OF 
RECEIVING A FAN WITH KIM JONG UN
ON ONE SIDE, PRESIDENT TRUMP ON 
THE OTHER.
THERE WAS ALSO A NOTEBOOK.
>> OKAY.
>> AND A WATER BOTTLE.
SUMMIT WATER BOTTLE.
IT IS HOT THERE.
SO THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE 
GOODY BAGS OR SURVIVAL 
TECHNIQUES.
>> TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN'S FACE 
ON THEM.
>> EXACTLY.
ALSO SOMETHING ELSE.
SINGAPORE IS GETTING INTO THIS.
SO EVEN WITH THEIR FOOD, THE 
SINGAPOREANS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR
FOOD.
NOW THEY'VE BRANCHED OUT A 
LITTLE BIT.
HERE YOU HAVE THE TRUMP AND KIM 
BURGER.
SO THIS IS AT THE ROYAL PLAZA.
THE HOTEL THERE IS OFFERING THE 
BURGER WHICH OFFERS KIM CHI PATE
WITH THE BURGER WHICH REPRESENTS
KOREAN AND AMERICAN CULTURES 
COMING TOGETHER.
>> I WOULD TRY IT.
>> WHAT WOULDN'T YOU TRY?
>> THE MEANTIME, THE EL 
HOMBRE -- 
>> ROCKET MAN.
>> AND EL GRINGO TACOS.
YOU HAVE THE TRUMP, KIM CHI 
DISH.
>> NOW I'M HUNGRY.
>>> AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 
RECOGNIZE THESE TWO.
>> OH, HEY.
>> SO THOSE ARE IMPERSONATORS.
HOWARD X AND DENNIS ALLEN AT IT 
AGAIN.
THEY WERE SEEN ON SATURDAY, 
BRO-ING IT UP SO TO SPEAK AHEAD 
OF THE SUMMIT.
THEY MAY THEY TOURED THE SOUTH N
WI
WINTER OLYMPICS AND GOT DETAINED
AT THE AIRPORT FOR SEVERAL 
HOURS, AUTHORITIES PERHAPS WERE 
CONFUSED BY THEIR APPEARANCE.
>> CONFUSED BY ALL OF THAT?
LOOK AT THAT.
THEY'RE HAVING, KIND OF LOOKS 
LIKE THE SUMMIT ITSELF.
THEY GOT TO CHECK OUT THE 
MER-LION, WHICH IS THIS WEIRD 
THING THEY HAVE, A HALF 
MERMAID-HALF LION THERE IN 
SINGAPORE.
>> THEY DON'T EVEN LOOK THAT 
MUCH LIKE THE REAL THING, BUT 
IMAGE OF BOTH OF THEM WALKING 
TOGETHER, SLAPPING EACH OTHER, 
EATING.
IT'S FUNNY.
>> IFT IS AWESOME.
SO MUCH HAPPENING IN SINGAPORE.
LOOK AT THEM.
>> WHAT'S UP, BRO?
>> IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO FREAKY 
FOR MANY PEOPLE TO SEE THE REAL 
KIM JONG UN WALKING THROUGH THAT
PARTICULAR AREA LAST NIGHT.
>> THAT'S TRUE, BECAUSE HE 
ACTUALLY
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN,
FACE-TO-FACE IN SINGAPORE.
>> THIS HALF HOUR, WHAT HAPPENS 
AFTER THE HANDSHAKE, PLUS, THE 
HEALTH SCARE FOR SOMEONE IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE.
>> IT IS TUESDAY MORNING, AND 
YOU'RE WATCHING A SPECIAL 
EDITION OF "WORLD NEWS NOW."
TRUMP AND KIM, THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT.
>>> FROM ABC NEWS, THIS IS 
"WORLD NEWS NOW."
>> AND WE DO SAY GOOD MORNING TO
EVERYBODY ON THIS TUESDAY.
>> QUITE A BUSY ONE.
>> WHAT A TUESDAY, WHAT A 
MORNING IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
SIX DECADES OF HOSTILITY AT 
TIMES WITH THE U.S. AND NORTH 
KOREA ON THE BRINK OF WAR 
SEEMINGLY COMING TO AN END 
TODAY.
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH 
KOREAN DICTATOR KICKED OFF THE 
MOMENTOUS OCCASION WITH A 
HANDSHAKE.
BEFORE HEADING INTO THEIR FIRST 
ONE ON ONE MEETING.
>> THE PRESIDENT PREDICTED 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND GAVE THAT
THUMBS UP THAT YOU SEE RIGHT 
THERE.
HE'S ALREADY DESCRIBING THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP AS EXCELLENT.
MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS US LIVE 
FROM SINGAPORE.
GOOD MORNING.
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST IN SOUTH 
KOREA AT THE DMZ A FEW MOMENTS 
AGO.
YOU SEE ALL OF THIS PLAYING OUT,
YOUR IMPRESSIONS TODAY.
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S QUITE 
INCREDIBLE TO SEE THOSE 
PICTURES.
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT
IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT LETTER THAT
THEY SIGNED SAYS.
WE DO KNOW FROM WHAT HE SAID, 
THEY HAVE AN EXCELLENT 
RELATIONSHIP, SO IF YOU THINK 
BACK BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME
HERE, HE SAID THE LEAST WE CAN 
ACCOMPLISH IS MEET, SEE EACH 
OTHER AND HOPEFULLY LIKE EACH 
OTHER.
THAT, THEY GOT FOR SURE.
BUT THEY CLEARLY ALLUDED TO THE 
FACT THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT THE 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.
DIDN'T SAY HOW, DIDN'T LAY OUT 
ANYTHING.
BUT THE KEY TO ME IS WHEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE VERY END 
WHEN HE WALKED AWAY THERE WAS 
ASKED ABOUT OTHER MEETINGS.
AND HE SAID THERE WILL BE MANY 
MORE.
THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT THEY 
WANTED, A PROCESS, THAT'S WHAT 
KIM JONG UN WANTED.
SO WE WILL SEE IF THEY SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION,
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO 
GET REAL SPECIFIC THERE IF THEY 
HAVE MORE MEETINGS TO COME.
>> I KNOW THE PRESIDENT SAID 
WE'LL KNOW VERY QUICKLY.
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE PORING 
THROUGH THIS LANGUAGE.
HE CALLED THIS AN IMPORTANT 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT.
WE HEARD FROM KIM JONG UN, THE 
WORLD WILL SEE MAJOR CHANGE.
WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS ON 
BOTH SIDES FOR WHAT THOSE WORDS 
MEAN?
>> Reporter: WELL, FOR THE U.S. 
IS COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE
DENUCLEARIZATION.
AND FOR KIM, IT IS SECURITY.
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THE 
UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO 
VERIFY.
MIKE POMPEO MADE THAT VERY 
CLEAR.
WHATEVER IS THE FINAL AGREEMENT 
HAS TO HAVE THAT COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
KIM JONG UN MAY HAVE A VERY 
DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT 
THAT MEANS.
HE WANTS TO BE SECURE IF HE DOES
NOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE 
WHO DOUBT THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN,
BUT WE CAN REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.
AND THE U.S., OF COURSE, DOESN'T
TRUST KIM.
THEY WANT TO VERIFY.
BUT THIS IS A START.
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.
THIS IS HISTORIC.
I THINK THINGS WILL NOT BE THE 
SAME WITH NORTH KOREA.
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE 
PRESIDENT LEARNED AND HIS STAFF 
AND HIS AIDES AND SECRETARY 
POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON WHO ARE 
IN THERE ABOUT KIM JONG UN.
NO ONE KNEW.
WE SAID ALL DAY THE LAST 
AMERICAN WHO REALLY TALKED TO 
HIM BEFORE MIKE POMPEO WAS 
DENNIS RODMAN.
DENNIS RODMAN KNEW MORE ABOUT 
KIM JONG UN THAN ANY OTHER 
AMERICAN.
AND NOW WE'VE GOT THIS.
YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW IN THAT 
ROOM, THOSE AIDES ARE TAKING 
NOTES.
THEY'RE WATCHING KIM JONG UN. 
>> HOW DOES HE NEGOTIATE?
DO WE THINK HE'S TELLING THE 
TRUTH?
MIKE POMPEO IS READING THE BODY 
LANGUAGE AND WHAT HE SAYS.
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO, THIS IS
THE ART OF THE DEAL PRESIDENT.
HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK IN A ROOM 
AND GET A DEAL AND KNOWS WHAT TO
LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO LOOK OUT 
FOR.
>> POINTING OUT THAT WE BARELY 
EVEN HEARD KIM JONG UN'S VOICE 
PRIOR TO THIS MORNING.
IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR IT.
MARTHA RADDATZ IN SINGAPORE.
WE APPRECIATE IT, MARTHA.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO OUR 
CONTRIBUTOR, RETIRED COLONEL 
STEVE GANYARD.
>> SIGNING THIS DOCUMENT, 
PROMISING MAJOR CHANGE.
CAN A DEAL BE TRUSTED, THOUGH?
THEY BOTH SEEM INCREDIBLY 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT JUST 
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT DO WE FOCUS 
ON NOW?
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY NUKES 
THEY HAVE.
SO WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER THAT
WE'RE GOING TO COUNT THEN IT'S 
HARD TO COUNT THAT NUMBER.
SO FINDING WAYS TO DO THIS IS 
GOING TO TAKE QUITE A WHILE.
IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE A LOT 
OF TIME AND NEGOTIATION.
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL 
HAPPEN OVER MONTHS IF NOT YEARS 
TO COME TO THE FINAL DETAILS OF 
THIS AGREEMENT.
BUT I'M SITTING HERE WATCHING 
SOMEBODY WHO SPENT MOST OF MY 
CAREER THINKING ABOUT THE THREAT
FROM THE NORTH AND THE HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS WHO 
HAVE SERVED IN UNIFORM IN THE 
PACIFIC WHERE NORTH KOREA WAS 
THE THREAT.
AND HERE YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEN 
SITTING TOGETHER.
IT IS, WHETHER IT TURNS OUT 
RIGHT OR WRONG, IT'S STILL AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SCENE.
>> NOW STEVE, TWO MONTHS AGO YOU
SAID THAT YOU WERE SKEPTICAL 
THAT THEY WOULD BREAK EVERY 
PROMISE THEY MADE.
HE SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT 
JUST TRUST AND VERIFY BUT 
DISTRUST AND VERIFY.
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY AFTER 
SEEING THESE PICTURES?
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO.
WE'VE BEEN BURNED IN THE PAST.
AND UNTIL THEY SHOW SOMETHING 
DIFFERENT, THEN WE NEED TO, THEN
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TRUST NO 
ONE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN 
VERIFY EVERYTHING THAT WE AGREE 
TO.
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO
SEE SOME CHANGES, AND I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME TRUE 
MOVEMENT FORWARD, BUT IT'S ALL 
GOING TO PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT 
MONTHS IF NOT YEARS, HOPEFULLY 
BRINGING PEACE AND REUNIFICATION
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO MANY HOPING FOR
THAT THIS MORNING.
STEVE GANYARD FOR US THANK YOU.
>> OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW ALL THE 
DEVELOPMENTS HAPPENING IN 
SINGAPORE, IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA
AS WELL AS WELL AS NORTH KOREA.
>> THE WORLD IS WATCHING THIS.
NOT ONLY ARE THE STAKES VERY 
HIGH FOR THE UNITED STATES, 
WE'VE HEARD THE PRESIDENT 
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME NOW.
AND THIS IS TWO LEADERS WHO WENT
FROM SEEMINGLY ON THE BRINK OF 
WAR.
TO NOW STRIKING A DEAL.
HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR SOUTH 
KOREA AS WELL.
THIS COULD CHANGE THE ENTIRE 
PENINSULA.
>> WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT ASKED,
WOULD YOU INVITE HIM TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, AND HE SAID YES.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> ABSOLUTELY YES.
>>> COMING MORE, A PARTING SHOT 
FROM SINGAPORE AS WE AWAIT THE 
PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE.
>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
TRUMP AND KIM, THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT.
NOW REPORTING FROM SINGAPORE, 
DAVID MUIR.
>>> HELLO, AGAIN, EVERYONE FROM 
SINGAPORE AND IT HAS BEEN AN 
EXTRAORDINARY DAY HERE IN 
SINGAPORE.
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BACK HOME IN
THE UNITED STATES, HISTORY MADE,
THE FIRST SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT
TO SIT DOWN FACE-TO-FACE WITH 
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA IN 
THIS CASE DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN, 
THE PRESIDENT A SHORT TIME AGO 
TELLING OUR GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS THAT HE DOES 
TRUST KIM JONG-UN.
GEORGE, PRESSING THE PRESIDENT 
HOW WILL HE VERIFY COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT WILL BE 
WORKED OUT BUT THAT THEY WILL 
FIND WAYS TO VERIFY, LOOKING 
BACK TO RONALD REAGAN'S WORDS 
SAYING TRUST BUT VERIFY, THE 
PRESIDENT ECHOING THOSE WORDS 
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO HERE.
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE ROOM.
YOU CAN SEE IT, CAPPELLA HOTEL, 
SENTOSA ISLAND WHERE HE MET WITH
HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS, FIRST THE
FACE-TO-FACE AND LARGER MEETING 
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISERS.
OUR JON KARL IS IN THE ROOM.
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT AND, JON, SO MANY 
QUESTIONS STILL UNANSWERED BUT 
NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS TRULY 
HISTORIC IN NATURE.
AND, JON, IN THAT ROOM 
APPARENTLY HE CAN'T HEAR US, 
PROBABLY IN POSITION GIVEN THE 
FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
EXPECTED TO TALK SHORTLY BUT, 
MARTHA RADDATZ, OUR CHIEF GLOBAL
AFFAIRS ANCHOR WHO HAS BEEN 
WATCHING IT UNFOLD WITH ME IN 
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS FOR THOSE 
WATCHING BACK IN THE U.S., THE 
KEY HURDLE HERE IS GOING TO BE 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHICH IS
WE MUST VERIFY, WE WILL VERIFY 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, BUT 
HOW DO YOU DO THAT. 
>> HOW DO YOU DO THAT?
YOU CHECK.
YOU RECHECK.
YOU HAVE A WHOLE PROGRAM HERE 
WHERE YOU GET RID OF THE 
WEAPONS, FIRST OF ALL, IN A 
PHASED BASIS.
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE 
TO LOOK OUT HERE FOR, DAVID, IS 
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID,
TRUST.
YOU REALLY CAN'T TRUST.
THE PRESIDENT MAY TRUST KIM 
JONG-UN BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST.
YOU HAVE TO VERIFY AND THE 
UNITED STATES HAS SAID THAT 
AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT JUST VERIFY 
BUT IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
WHAT YOU ALSO HAD IN THAT 
STATEMENT IS THE PRESIDENT AND 
KIM JONG-UN SAYING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COMMITTED TO PROVIDE 
SECURITY GUARANTEES TO NORTH 
KOREA, THAT'S KEY HERE, THAT'S 
EXACTLY WHAT KIM JONG-UN WANTED.
HE FELT THREATENED.
THAT'S WHY HE GOT THOSE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS TO BEGIN WITH.
SO HE COULD NEGOTIATE TO A DAY 
LIKE TODAY. 
>> THIS IS SOMETHING THE 
PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY BE ASKED 
ABOUT MOMENTS FROM NOW, HOW DO 
WE PROVIDE THAT SECURITY AND 
WHAT DOES THAT SECURITY LOOK 
LIKE?
DOES THAT KEEP KIM JONG-UN IN 
POWER FOR YEARS, DECADES TO 
COME?
>> WELL, HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T 
MENTION HIM BY NAME.
HE TALKED ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE
DPRK.
HE TALKED ABOUT SECURITY FOR 
NORTH KOREA.
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?
MIKE POMPEO SAID IT'S A UNIQUE 
KIND OF SECURITY AGREEMENT.
WE, FRANKLY, DON'T KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW THEY 
WILL PROVIDE THAT SECURITY.
YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO
WE WERE THREATENING ANNIHILATE 
NORTH KOREA IF THEY DARED LAUNCH
ANY SORT OF NUCLEAR WEAPON OR 
THREATEN THE UNITED STATES, 
REMEMBER, THE INCIDENT WITH 
GUAM, HE WAS PROMISING MISSILES 
WOULD BE SHOT TOWARDS GUAM AND 
THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST 
INTENSE PERIOD FOR FEARS THERE 
WOULD BE SOME COSORT OF CONFLIC 
>> WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN 
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST WITH 
NORTH KOREA BACK DURING 
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON'S TIME.
THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT REACHED 
IN PRINCIPLE THAT FELL APART NOT
LONG AFTER WHEN KIM JONG-UN'S 
FATHER DIED A SHORT TIME AFTER 
THAT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.
IN THIS CASE WHEN YOU SEE THOSE 
WORDS AND, IN FACT, IT'S IN THE 
FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS LETTER 
SIGNED JOINTLY BY THESE TWO 
LEADERS A SHORT TIME AGO HERE IN
SINGAPORE SAYING THAT CHAIRMAN 
KIM JONG-UN HAS REAFFIRMED HIS 
FIRM AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT 
TO COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, I MEAN, 
THERE ISN'T MUCH ROOM FOR AN 
OPENING THERE, COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION IS WHAT 
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO SAID 
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS AND WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID LEADING
UP TO THE SUMMIT THAT WAS 
CANCELED THEN BACK ON BUT THIS 
IS ALWAYS BEEN THE GROUNDS FOR 
AN AGREEMENT. 
>> Reporter: IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
THE REASON WE ARE HERE TODAY, 
THE REASON PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME 
TO THIS MEETING, THE REASON FOR 
THIS SUMMIT IS DENUCLEARIZATION 
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA, OF 
NORTH KOREA.
>> WE ARE ON THE AIR IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BACK HOME, 
4:08 IN THE MORNING IN THE EAST,
WE'RE 12 HOUR AS HEAD IN 
SINGAPORE.
DIE WANT
 I DO WANT TO BRING IN JUJU 
CHANG MONITORING THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS WITH US HERE IN 
SINGAPORE BACK IN OUR NEW YORK 
STUDIO AND, JUJU, I'M CURIOUS, 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT 
MOON IN SOUTH KOREA AND THIS 
CABINET WATCHING AS THE EVENTS 
UNFOLDED HERE SMILING WITH THAT 
FIRST HANDSHAKE, BUT EVEN HE 
COULD NOT HAVE PREDICTED HOW 
THIS WOULD HAVE UNFOLDED TODAY 
AND I KNOW THAT THE SECRETARY OF
STATE NOW TRAVELS TO MEET WITH 
PRESIDENT MOON NEXT TO FILL HIM 
IN ON HOW THIS, THEY BELIEVE, 
WILL UNFOLD IN THE COMING WEEKS,
MONTHS, YEARS TO COME. 
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAPPENED SO 
QUICKLY.
THE SPEED WITH WHICH PEACE BROKE
OUT ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, IF 
YOU WILL, IT HAS BEEN WILDLY 
POPULAR IN SOUTH KOREA ENJOYING 
80% APPROVAL RATINGS IN SOME 
SECTORS, BUT THERE IS STILL A 
VERY DEEP RESERVOIR OF DISTRUST 
BUILT UP OVER DECADES OF 
BETRAYALS AS YOU ALLUDED TO AND 
BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE WITH 
SUBSEQUENT AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATIONS STRIKING DEALS 
WITH KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER AND 
HIS GRANDFATHER BEFORE THAT.
THEY'VE MADE AGREEMENTS TO 
DENUCLEARIZE, AGREEMENTS BEFORE 
TO STRIKE AT PEACE AND WE'VE 
EVEN HAD A PREVIOUS SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT KIM DAE-JUNG WIN A 
NOBEL PRIZE FOR HIS EFFORTS 
TOWARDS PEACE ONLY TO HAVE THEM 
UNRAVEL.
NOW, THE IRONIC TWIST IS THAT 
THIS SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON
JAE-IN HAS SUGGESTED THAT IT'S 
DONALD TRUMP WHO DESERVES THE 
NOBEL PRIZE WHICH IS FASCINATING
TO ME ON SOME LEVELS, A 
KOREAN-AMERICAN, IT SAYS IF HE'S
THE MODERN-DAY, YOU KNOW, 
GENERAL DOUGLAS McARTHUR COMING 
TO SAVE KOREA FROM TYRANNY WHICH
IS IN MANY WAYS AN ASTONISHING 
DEVELOPMENT.
>> IT IS, JUJU.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HIMSELF 
THAT HE'S BEEN LONG INTERESTED 
IN BEING PART OF THE 
NEGOTIATIONS THAT WOULD HELP 
TAKE CARE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
THAT STILL EXIST IN OUR WORLD.
HE SAID HE'S WATCHED IT SINCE 
THE '80s PLAYING OUT WHEN RONALD
REAGAN WAS PRESIDENT AND WE 
WITNESSED SOMETHING 
EXTRAORDINARY TODAY WHERE AT 
LEAST FOR NOW WE HAVE THE 
BLUEPRINT FOR WHAT COULD BE 
PEACE ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE KIM JONG-UN 
CAME TO THIS SUMMIT WITH AN EYE 
TOWARDS JOINING THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AT 
LEAST ECONOMICALLY AND THAT THIS
LETTER, THIS AGREEMENT IS REALLY
HIS TICKET INTO THE CLUB AND 
SANCTIONS MAY NOT BE ON THE 
TABLE AND MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN 
THE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THAT'S 
CLEARLY ON THE REGIME'S MIND, IF
YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC GAPS 
BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH 
KOREA, SOUTH KOREA IS NOW THE 
11th OR 12th LARGEST ECONOMY 
DEPENDING ON WHICH LIST YOU LOOK
AT AND NORTH KOREA IS 125th.
IT IS IN THE CELLAR AND THAT IS 
NOT WHERE IT WAS 50 YEARS AGO, 
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT
AND SO THIS IS AN ECONOMIC 
DISPARITY THAT KIM JONG-UN IS 
CERTAINLY HOPING TO CHANGE.
>> AND, JUJU, STICK WITH US 
HERE, I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WATCHING BACK HOME AS THIS 
UNFOLDS WE ARE AWAITING THE 
PRESIDENT AND WILL TAKE 
QUESTIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL 
REPORTERS BUT WANTED TO GET BACK
TO JUJU BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE 
NOT ONLY BACK IN THE U.S. BUT 
AROUND THE WORLD I'M SURE IT'S 
ALSO A DAY OF TRYING TO 
RECONCILE THE PERSON THEY KNEW 
AS A BRUTAL DICTATOR, SOMEONE 
WHO PRESIDED OVER A COUNTRY WITH
ROLLING BLACKOUTS, WITH PEOPLE 
NEAR STARVATION, IN DESPERATE 
NEED OF FOOD IN SOME CASES, A 
LEADER WHO KILLED MEMBERS OF HIS
OWN FAMILY TO KEEP HIS GRIP ON 
POWER.
AND NOW JUST SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THIS YEAR THE OLIVE BRANCH TO
THE SOUTH, PRESIDENT MOON TAKING
NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION TO THE 
OLYMPICS AND THIS FACE-TO-FACE 
MEETING NOW WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
THIS HAS ONLY BEEN RELATIVELY 
NEW FOR KIM JONG-UN, THE 
DIPLOMAT, AND IT COMES AFTER 
YEARS AS A RUTHLESS DICTATOR IN 
NORTH KOREA. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, DAVID.
WHEN I WAS IN SEOUL MOST 
RECENTLY BEFORE THE KOREA 
OLYMPICS, A LOT OF THE DEFECTORS
FROM NORTH KOREA WERE TELLING ME
THIS IS A REGIME THAT IS KNOWN 
IN THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN 
RIGHTS COMMUNITY AS IMPRISONING 
IN GULAGS MORE THAN 100,000 
NORTH KOREANS, TORTURING, 
EXECUTING, STARVING ITS CITIZENS
AND SO THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE AS 
JON KARL HAS NOTED FROM SENIOR 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT IS 
NOT ON THE NEGOTIATING TABLE 
THIS TIME AROUND AND YET IT IS 
VERY MUCH A CONCERN FOR THOSE 
LOOKING AT NORTH KOREA.
>> JUJU CHANG, "NIGHTLINE" 
ANCHOR STANDING BY IN NEW YORK.
OUR THANKS TO YOU.
I WANT TO BRING IN JONATHAN KARL
BECAUSE JON IS IN THE ROOM 
AWAITING THE PRESIDENT.
HE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS GATHERED IN 
THAT ROOM AND I KNOW THEY'RE 
PLAYING A VIDEO PRESENTATION.
DO A BIT OF A SCENE SETTING 
HERE.
WHAT IS IT THEY PRODUCED?
>> Reporter: THIS IS QUITE A 
PRODUCTION, VERY SLICKLY 
PRODUCED VIDEO AND PLAYED IT 
BOTH IN KOREAN AND IN -- NOW 
THEY'RE PLAYING IT IN ENGLISH.
IT'S A VIDEO THAT BASICALLY 
DESCRIBES THIS AS A MOMENT IN 
HISTORY WHERE WE HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GO BETWEEN 
NUCLEAR WAR AND PROSPERITY FOR 
ALL.
IT'S REALLY QUITE A SLICK VIDEO 
PRESENTATION.
IT'S GOT OVERTONES OF PROPAGANDA
BUT A VERY SLICKLY PRODUCED 
PRODUCTION.
>> WILL THE WORLD EMBRACE THIS 
CHANGE?
>> I ALSO HAVE TO SAY IT 
ILLUSTRATES HOW MUCH PLANNING 
HAD ACTUALLY GONE INTO THIS 
SUMMIT.
I THINK THAT IN THE REPORTING 
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT THERE 
WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT 
HOW PREPARED PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS, HOW MUCH STUDYING HE WAS 
DOING.
HE SAID I DON'T HAVE TO PREPARE 
MUCH BUT WAS A SHORT TIME THERE 
AFTER HE IS PREPARING AND 
SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS A DAY 
WITH SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, 
BUT TO SEE WITHIN MINUTES, 40 
MINUTES OR SO COMING OUT OF THAT
FACE-TO-FACE SAYING WE HAVE AN 
EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP.
WE GOT ALONG VERY GOOD IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S WORDS AND NOW TO SEE
THIS AGREEMENT SIGNED WITH THE 
TEMPLATE OF PEACE IN THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA AND NOW WHAT APPEARS 
TO BE A VERY SLICK VIDEO BEING 
PLAYED.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD SHOW THAT 
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE PLANNING 
THAT WENT INTO THIS, JON.
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A LOT OF 
PLANNING IN THIS.
AND THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY.
YOU HAVE BASICALLY THE WORLD 
PRESS CORPS HERE WATCHING THIS 
VIDEO PRESENTATION.
AS I MENTIONED, AMERICAN, 
ENGLISH AND IN KOREAN AND WE 
HAVE THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND 
STAFF AND HERE COMES THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, DONALD TRUMP.
>> NO DOUBT, VERY HAPPY WITH HOW
EVENTS TRANSPIRED HERE IN 
SINGAPORE TODAY.
HIS FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH 
KIM JONG-UN MAKING HISTORY AND 
BEING WATCHED ALL OVER THE 
WORLD.
WATCH THIS.
>> WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 24 
HOURS AND THREE MONTHS BECAUSE 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE
A WHILE.
THAT WAS A TAPE WE GAVE TO 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND HIS PEOPLE, HIS
REPRESENTATIVES AND IT CAPTURES 
A LOT, CAPTURES WHAT COULD BE 
DONE AND THAT'S A GREAT PLACE 
HAS A POTENTIAL TO BE AN 
INCREDIBLE PLACE BETWEEN SOUTH 
KOREA IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND 
CHINA.
THAT'S GOT TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL 
AND I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT 
AND HE WANTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S MY HONOR TODAY TO ADDRESS 
THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD 
FOLLOWING THIS VERY HISTORIC 
SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN
OF NORTH KOREA, SPENT VERY 
INTENSIVE HOURS TOGETHER AND I 
THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE GOTTEN 
THE SIGNED DOCUMENT OR YOU WILL 
VERY SHORTLY.
IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE.
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN 
EMISSARY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO DELIVER A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND
VISION AND A MESSAGE OF PEACE.
LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING OUR 
INCREDIBLE HOSTS IN SINGAPORE, 
ESPECIALLY PRIME MINISTER LEE, 
FRIEND OF MINE, THIS IS A 
COUNTRY OF PROFOUND GRACE AND 
BEAUTY AND WE SEND OUR WARMEST 
WISHES TO EVERY CITIZEN OF 
SINGAPORE WHO REALLY MADE THIS 
VISIT SO IMPORTANT AND SO 
PLEASANT DESPITE ALL OF THE WORK
AND ALL OF THE LONG HOURS.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT 
MOON OF SOUTH KOREA.
HE'S WORKING HARD, IN FACT, I'LL
BE SPEAKING TO HIM RIGHT AFTER 
WE'RE FINISHED.
PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN, 
FRIEND OF MINE, JUST LEFT OUR 
COUNTRY AND HE WANTS WHAT'S 
RIGHT FOR JAPAN AND FOR THE 
WORLD.
GOOD MAN.
AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, WHO HAS 
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 
THAT'S OKAY, BUT HE REALLY HAS, 
AND HE'S A TERRIFIC PERSON AND A
FRIEND OF MINE AND REALLY A 
GREAT LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE.
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR 
EFFORTS TO HELP US GET TO THIS 
VERY HISTORIC DAY.
MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO THANK
CHAIRMAN KIM FOR TAKING THE 
FIRST BOLD STEP TOWARD A BRIGHT 
NEW FUTURE FOR HIS PEOPLE, OUR 
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING, THE FIRST
BETWEEN AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
AND A LEADER OF NORTH KOREA 
PROVES THAT REAL CHANGE IS 
INDEED POSSIBLE.
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM WAS
HONEST, DIRECT AND PRODUCTIVE.
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 
TIME.
UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 
CIRCUMSTANCE.
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 
HISTORY AND WE'RE READY TO WRITE
A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 
NATIONS, NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO 
THINK OF THAT, 70 YEARS AGO AN 
EXTREMELY BLOODY CONFLICT 
RAVAGED THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 
CONFLICT INCLUDING TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 
YET, WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED 
TO THIS DAY, NEVER ENDED.
BUT NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE 
THAT IT WILL SOON END AND IT 
WILL.
IT WILL SOON END.
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO DEFINE
THE FUTURE.
Y
YESTERDAY'S CONFLICT DOES NOT 
HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR AND AS
HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER AND OVER
AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN INDEED 
BECOME FRIENDS, WE CAN HONOR THE
SACRIFICE OF OUR FOREFATHERS BY 
REPLACING THE HORRORS OF BATTLE 
WITH THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE.
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 
EMBRACES COMMERCE AND AN 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 
ENGAGE.
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER TO BE 
REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER WHO 
USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW ERA OF
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS 
PEOPLE, CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST 
SIGNED A JOINT STATEMENT IN 
WHICH HE REAFFIRMED HIS 
UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
KOREAN PENINSULA.
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT.
THIS ISN'T THE PAST.
THIS ISN'T ANOTHER 
ADMINISTRATION THAT NEVER GOT IT
STARTED AND, THEREFORE, NEVER 
GOT IT DONE.
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 
NORTH KOREA'S ALREADY DESTROYING
A MAJOR MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 
SITE.
THAT'S NOT IN YOUR SIGNED 
DOCUMENT.
WE AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED.
THAT'S A BIG THING.
FOR THE MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 
TESTING, THE SITE IS GOING TO BE
DESTROYED VERY SOON.
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF AN 
ARDUOUS PROCESS, OUR EYES ARE 
WIDE OPEN BUT PEACE IS ALWAYS 
WORTH THE EFFORT.
ESPECIALLY IN THIS CASE.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YEARS
AGO.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED A
LONG TIME AGO.
BUT WE'RE RESOLVING IT NOW.
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 
HIS PEOPLE.
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 
PEACE.
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER.
THE PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 
SOUTH, ARE PROFOUNDLY TALENTED, 
INDUSTRIOUS AND GIFTED.
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE.
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 
LANGUAGE, CUSTOMS, CULTURE AND 
DESTINY.
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 
REMOVED.
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT.
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 
HARMONY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN 
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF WAR.
THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS WITHIN AND
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING.
IT IS RIGHT THERE.
IT'S WITHIN OUR REACH.
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE.
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 
TAKE PLACE.
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE.
IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY.
IT'S A VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM IS ON HIS WAY BACK 
TO NORTH KOREA AND I KNOW FOR A 
FACT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES HE 
WILL START A PROCESS THAT'S 
GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE 
VERY HAPPY AND VERY SAFE.
SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH 
EVERYBODY TODAY.
THE MEDIA, IT'S A BIG GATHERING 
OF MEDIA, I WILL SAY.
MAKES ME FEEL VERY 
UNCOMFORTABLE.
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL 
OF US INCLUDING YOURSELVES AND 
YOUR FAMILIES SO THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
GO AHEAD, SURE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> NBC.
>> THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT.
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU IF YOU 
DON'T MIND, FIRST, THE MAN YOU 
MET TODAY, KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU 
KNOW HAS KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, 
HAS STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 
OTTO WARMBIER, WHY ARE YOU SO 
COMFORTABLE CALLING HIM VERY 
TALENTED?
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED.
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T SAY
HE WAS NICE OR I DON'T SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, HE RUN IT -- 
VERY FEW PEOPLE AT THAT AGE YOU 
CAN TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 
PROBABLY COULDN'T DO IT.
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PERSON AND HE WILL BE FOR A LONG
TIME IN MY LIFE.
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 
MINE.
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO, THIS WOULD
NOT HAVE HAPPENED.
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY, IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING.
IT WAS BRUTAL.
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED TO 
FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING ON 
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA.
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS.
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE 
TO SAY SPECIAL PARENTS, SPECIAL 
PEOPLE.
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING
HERE TODAY, OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU,
SIR, WAS ON THE SECURITY.
SECOND QUESTION, SIR, ON THE 
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT.
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN?
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 
MILITARY CAPABILITIES AND JUST 
TO FOLLOW UP -- 
>> WE'RE NOT REDUCING ANYTHING.
WE'RE NOT REDUCING, AT SOME 
POINT I HAVE TO BE HONEST AND 
USED TO SAY THIS DURING MY 
CAMPAIGN AS YOU KNOW PROBABLY 
BETTER THAN MOST, I WANT TO GET 
OUR SOLDIERS OUT.
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 
BACK HOME.
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN SOUTH
KOREA AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO
BRING THEM BACK HOME BUT THAT'S 
NOT PART OF THE EQUATION RIGHT 
NOW.
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL BE 
BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES, WHICH WILL SAVE US A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD BUT WE'LL 
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
MONEY, PLUS, I THINK IT'S VERY 
PROVOCATIVE.
YES.
GO AHEAD.
OH, GO AHEAD.
I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN ROBERTS.
YOU LOOKED -- MUCH BETTER, 
RIGHT. 
>> WE'RE FREQUENTLY CONFUSED, 
MR. PRESIDENT.
>> YES.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 
STATEMENT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> YEAH. 
>> IS THAT A CONCESSION ON THE 
PART OF THE UNITED STATES. 
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 
ARE GOING TO -- LET'S SEE HERE.
IT WILL BE GONE, I DON'T THINK 
YOU CAN BE ANY MORE PLAIN THAN 
WHAT WE'RE ASKING.
ISSUES RELATED TO THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW U.S. 
DPKR RELATIONS, THE BUILDING.
WE TALK ABOUT THE GUARANTEES AND
WE TALK ABOUT UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA.
THIS IS THE DOCUMENT THAT WE 
JUST SIGNED.
>> DID YOU DISCUSS WITH CHAIRMAN
KIM METHODS TO VERIFY EITHER 
WITH YOU THE UNITED STATES OR 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT
VERY PROCESS?
>> YES, WE DID. 
>> AND DO YOU HAVE A TIMETABLE.
COULD YOU GIVE US THAT?
HOW WILL IT BE ACHIEVED. 
>> IT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY HAVING
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE AND AS WE 
DEVELOP A CERTAIN TRUST AND WE 
THINK WE HAVE DONE THAT, 
SECRETARY POMPEO'S BEEN REALLY 
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB.
HIS STAFF, EVERYBODY, AS WE DO 
THAT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT 
OF PEOPLE THERE AND WE'RE GOING 
TO BE WORKING WITH THEM ON A LOT
OF OTHER THINGS, BUT THIS IS 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
NORTH KOREA.
AND IT WILL BE VERIFIED.
>> WILL THOSE PEOPLE BE 
AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL -- 
>> A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE.
A COMBINATION OF ABOVE AND WE 
HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, YES.
GO AHEAD.
BE NICE.
BE RESPECTFUL.
>> I'LL BE VERY RESPECTFUL, SIR.
WHAT DID KIM JONG-UN SAY TO YOU 
TO GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT 
FOR ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF NORTH
KOREA THEY ARE NOT CHEATING THE 
SYSTEM AND GAMING THE WORLD AND 
GAMING THE PEOPLE WHO WILL HAVE 
TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GIVING UP THEIR
NUCLEAR ARSENAL?
>> VERY FAIR QUESTION.
HE ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE FACT 
THAT THEY PROCEEDED DOWN A PATH 
IN THE PAST AND ULTIMATELY AS 
YOU KNOW NOTHING GOT DONE AND 
ONE CASE THEY TOOK BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS DURING THE CLINTON 
REGIME, TOOK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING AND HE
ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP TO ME AND
HE SAID, WE HAVE NEVER GONE THIS
FAR.
I DON'T THINK THEY'VE EVER HAD 
THE CONFIDENCE, FRANKLY, IN A 
PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT 
NOW FOR GETTING THINGS DONE AND 
HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET THINGS
DONE.
AND HE WAS VERY FIRM IN THE FACT
THAT HE WANTS TO DO THIS -- I 
THINK HE MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS 
AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN ME 
BECAUSE THEY SEE A VERY BRIGHT 
FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA.
SO, YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT?
WE NEVER KNOW BUT I'LL TELL YOU 
WHAT WE SIGNED A VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT TODAY AND
I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE BEEN 
GIVEN THAT DOCUMENT.
BUT WE SIGNED A VERY, VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT AND I 
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO LIVE UP TO
THAT DOCUMENT.
IN FACT, WHEN HE LANDS WHICH IS 
GOING TO BE SHORTLY, I THINK 
THAT HE WILL START THAT PROCESS 
RIGHT AWAY.
I DO.
I DO.
I CAN ONLY SAY I KNOW I'M FOR 
REALLY WELL -- IT'S BEEN VERY 
RHETORICAL AS YOU KNOW.
I THINK WITHOUT THE RHETORIC IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED, I THINK 
WITHOUT OTHER THINGS GOING 
ALONG, I THINK THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF A NEW TEAM WAS VERY 
IMPORTANT.
THEY HAVE A GREAT TEAM BUT I DO.
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE.
I REALLY FEEL THAT VERY 
STRONGLY.
JOHN.
YOU TWO GUYS LOOK ALIKE WHEN THE
LIGHT IS RIGHT.
THE HAIR IS VERY SIMILAR.
WHO HAS BETTER HAIR?
PRETTY GOOD HAIR. 
>> IT'S THE ANGELIC GLOW OF THE 
BACKLIGHTING, MR. PRESIDENT, 
THAT MAKES US LOOK SO SIMILAR.
OF COURSE, THE DENUCLEARIZATION 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BIOLOGICAL 
WEAPONS IS ONE PROBLEM IN NORTH 
KOREA.
ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM IS THE 
HORRIBLE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS.
WAS THAT DISCUSSED AT ALL?
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL 
TACKLE IN THE FUTURE. 
>> YES, IT WAS DISCUSSED.
IT WILL BE DISCUSSED MORE IN THE
FUTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS.
WHAT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED IN GREAT
DETAIL, JOHN, WAS THE FACT THAT,
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE -- AND I MUST 
HAVE HAD -- JUST COUNTLESS CALLS
AND LETTERS AND WEEKS, ANYTHING 
CAN YOU DO, THEY WANT THE 
REMAINS OF THEIR SONS BACK.
THEY WANT THE REMAINS OF THEIR 
FATHERS AND MOTHERS, ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT GOT CAUGHT INTO THAT
REALLY BRUTAL WAR, WHICH TOOK 
PLACE TO A LARGE EXTENT IN NORTH
KOREA AND I ASKED FOR IT TODAY 
AND WE GOT IT.
THAT WAS A VERY LAST MINUTE, THE
REMAINS WILL BE COMING BACK.
THEY'RE GOING TO START THAT 
PROCESS IMMEDIATELY.
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE, EVEN DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN THEY'LL SAY, IS 
THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN WORK WITH 
NORTH KOREA TO GET THE REMAINS 
OF MY SON BACK OR MY FATHER 
BACK?
SO MANY PEOPLE ASKED ME THIS 
QUESTION AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID, 
LOOK, WE DON'T GET ALONG TOO 
WELL WITH THAT PARTICULAR GROUP 
OF PEOPLE.
BUT NOW WE DO.
AND HE AGREED TO THAT SO QUICKLY
AND SO NICE -- IT WAS REALLY A 
VERY NICE THING AND HE 
UNDERSTANDS IT.
HE UNDERSTANDS IT.
SO FOR THE THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS, I GUESS, WAY OVER 
6,000 THAT WE KNOW OF IN TERMS 
OF THE REMAINS, THEY'LL BE 
BROUGHT BACK.
>> THE P.O.W./M.I.A. ISSUE -- 
>> ESPECIALLY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE -- 
>> WHAT DO YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP,
EXPECT KIM JONG-UN TO DO ABOUT 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD 
REGARDING THE NORTH KOREAN 
PEOPLE. 
>> RIGHT, IT WAS DISCUSSED.
IT WAS DISCUSSED RELATIVELY 
BRIEFLY COMPARED TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION, OBVIOUSLY 
THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED AND 
WHERE WE ENDED.
BUT THEY WILL BE DOING THINGS 
AND I THINK HE WANTS TO DO 
THINGS.
I THINK HE WANTS TO.
YOU'D BE VERY SURPRISED, VERY 
SMART, VERY GOOD NEGOTIATOR, 
WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
HE BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT IN 
THE PAST THEY TOOK DIALOGUE -- 
THEY NEVER WERE LIKE WE ARE, 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE
WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE NOW, BUT THEY
WENT DOWN THE LINE, BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WERE GIVEN AND, YOU 
KNOW, THE FOLLOWING DAY THE 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM CONTINUED.
BUT THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 
TIME AND THIS IS A MUCH 
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT IN ALL 
FAIRNESS.
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
THIS WAS ONE OF THE PERHAPS ONE 
OF THE REASONS THAT I WON -- I 
CAMPAIGNED ON THIS ISSUES AS YOU
KNOW VERY WELL.
WHOEVER THOSE PEOPLE ARE.
I CANNOT SEE YOU WITH ALL THE 
LIGHTS BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE 
EITHER OF THE TWO -- YEAH, GO 
AHEAD.
SURE.
GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT AND 
FIRST OF ALL CONGRATULATIONS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.
>> DID YOU TOUCH ON THE ISSUE OF
PEACE TREATY AND ALSO WILL YOU 
TRAVEL TO PYONGYANG ANY ANY TIME
SOON. 
>> THAT WILL BE A DAY I LOOK 
FORWARD TO AND I ALSO WILL BE 
INVITING CHAIRMAN KIM AT THE 
APPROPRIATE TIME TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE 
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY 
IMPORTANT AND HE HAS ACCEPTED.
I SAID AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.
WE WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.
BUT WHAT WE SIGNED TODAY WAS A 
LOT OF THINGS INCLUDED AND THEN 
YOU HAVE THINGS THAT WEREN'T 
INCLUDED THAT WE GOT AFTER THE 
DEAL WAS SIGNED.
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE IN MY 
LIFE.
WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN THE 
AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE
TIME AND I THINK MOST OF YOU 
HAVE BEEN HANDED OUT THE 
AGREEMENT OR SOON WILL, BUT -- 
YOU HAVE NOT?
WELL, IF YOU COULD HAVE THOSE 
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, WE JUST 
FINISHED THEM JUST A LITTLE 
WHILE AGO.
BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE THE 
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, YOU'LL 
SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.
>> CONGRATULATIONS, PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WHAT PART DID JAPAN PLAY AND 
DID THE ABDUCTION ISSUE COME UP 
AND ALSO THE FATE OF THE 
CHRISTIANS AND THE FOLLOW-UP 
QUESTION IS WHEN WILL YOU BE 
DOING AN INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE
TV?
50,000 AMERICAN TROOPS ARE IN 
JAPAN. 
>> 50,000 GREAT TROOPS.
YEAH, I DID, ABDUCTION, 
OBVIOUSLY.
PRIME MINISTER ABE, CERTAINLY 
OTHER THAN THE WHOLE DENUKING 
SUBJECT, CERTAINLY HIS, I WOULD 
SAY HIS MAIN POINT AND I BROUGHT
IT UP, ABSOLUTELY AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT.
WE DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN IN THE 
DOCUMENT BUT IT WILL BE WORKED 
ON.
CHRISTIANS, YES, WE ARE -- 
BROUGHT IT UP VERY STRONGLY, 
FRANKLIN GRAHAM SPENT AND SPENDS
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME IN 
NORTH KOREA.
'GOT A VERY CLOSE TO HIS HEART.
IT DID COME UP AND THINGS WILL 
BE HAPPENING.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
GREAT QUESTION.
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
RETURNING TO THE QUESTION OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU SPOKE VERY 
POWERFULLY ON THE ISSUE DURING 
YOUR STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.
YOU SHOWED THAT YOU HAD THE 
DEFECTOR IN THE FIRST LADY'S BOX
WITH THE CRUTCHES WHO ESCAPED 
AND YOU SAID AT THAT POINT NORTH
KOREA HAS MORE BRUTALLY 
OPPRESSED ITS PEOPLE THAN THEY 
OTHER REGIME ON EARTH.
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT IS THE
CASE HAVING SAT DOWN WITH KIM 
JONG-UN AND DOES HE NEED TO 
CHANGE THAT?
>> JON, I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH 
SITUATION OVER THERE.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND
WE DID DISCUSS IT TODAY.
PRETTY STRONGLY, I MEAN, KNOWING
WHAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF WHAT WE
WERE DOING IS, DENUKING, BUT 
DISCUSSED IT AT PRETTY GOOD 
LENGTH.
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT.
IT'S ROUGH.
IT'S ROUGH IN A LOT OF PLACES, 
BY THE WAY, NOT JUST THERE BUT 
IT'S ROUGH AND WE WILL CONTINUE 
THAT AND I THINK ULTIMATELY 
WE'LL AGREE TO SOMETHING, BUT IT
WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH OUTSIDE 
OF -- OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR 
SITUATION, ONE OF THE PRIMARY 
TOPICS. 
>> BUT DO YOU THINK THAT NEEDS 
TO CHANGE TO BRING ON THIS 
GLORIOUS NEW ERA YOU TALKED 
ABOUT?
>> I THINK IT WILL CHANGE, YEAH.
I THINK IT PROBABLY HAS TO BUT I
THINK IT WILL, YEAH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STEVE.
THAT'S YOU, STEVE, RIGHT THERE. 
>> YES, SIR, THANK YOU.
WHAT TIMETABLE DO YOU ENVISION 
FOR THEIR DENUCLEARIZATION AND 
IN THE MEANTIME, ARE YOU 
THINKING ABOUT EASING ANY 
SANCTIONS?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, 
SCIENTIFICALLY I'VE BEEN 
WATCHING AND READING A LOT ABOUT
THIS AND IT DOES TAKE A LONG 
TIME TO, YOU KNOW, PULL OFF 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, IT 
TAKES A LONG TIME, 
SCIENTIFICALLY, YOU HAVE TO WAIT
CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME AND A 
LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN, BUT 
DESPITE THAT, ONCE YOU START THE
PROCESS, IT MEANS IT'S PRETTY 
MUCH OVER.
YOU CAN'T USE THEM.
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS AND THAT'S 
GOING TO START VERY SOON, I 
BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO START 
VERY SOON.
WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS IT CAN 
MECHANICALLY AND PHYSICALLY BE 
DONE, STEVE.
>> AND THE SANCTIONS. 
>> THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF 
WHEN WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES 
ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR.
SANCTIONS PLAYED A BIG ROLE, BUT
THEY'LL COME OFF AT THAT POINT.
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE SOON BUT
THEY'LL COME OFF -- AS YOU KNOW 
AND AS I'VE SAID, THE SANCTIONS 
RIGHT NOW REMAIN BUT AT A 
CERTAIN POINT I ACTUALLY LOOK 
FORWARD TO TAKING THEM OFF AND 
THEY'LL COME OFF WHEN WE KNOW 
WE'RE DOWN THE ROAD WHERE IT'S 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
OKAY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MR. PRESIDENT.
>> GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS 
HISTORIC SUMMIT. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY, BY
THE WAY.
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY.
GO AHEAD. 
>> YOU SIGNED A DOCUMENT WITH 
KIM JONG-UN.
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PIECE OF 
PAPER.
YESTERDAY WE HAD A BRIEFING FROM
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MIKE 
POMPEO AND HE SAID THE 
FOLLOWING, MANY PRESIDENTS 
PREVIOUSLY HAVE SIGNED OFF ON 
PIECES OF PAPER, ONLY TO FIND 
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS EITHER 
DIDN'T PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT 
THEY HAD OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON 
THOSE PROMISES.
WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT, 
MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> WELL, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT 
ADMINISTRATION.
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECRETARY 
OF STATE.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE, NOW 
HE, VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM AND 
WE GET IT DONE.
THE OTHER GROUPS MAYBE IT WASN'T
A PRIORITY.
I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 
DONE IT IF IT WAS A PRIORITY, 
FRANKLY.
I DON'T THINK THEY HONESTLY 
COULD HAVE DONE IT EVEN IF IT 
WAS A PRIORITY.
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 
BACK THEN, WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR 
ME MUCH EASIER IF THIS WERE TEN 
YEARS AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO AND 
I'M NOT JUST BLAMING PRESIDENT 
OBAMA.
THIS GOES BACK FOR 25 YEARS THIS
SHOULD DR. HAPPENED.
I WAS GIVEN A VERY TOUGH HAND.
I WAS GIVEN THIS.
I WAS GIVEN THE IRAN DEAL AND 
PLENTY OF OTHER PROBLEMS, BUT WE
ARE -- WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL 
AND THE IRAN DEAL, I HAVE TO BE 
HONEST, I DID IT BECAUSE NUCLEAR
IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE TO ME.
NUCLEAR IS NUMBER ONE.
BUT ON THE IRAN DEAL, I THINK 
IRAN IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY NOW 
THAN IT WAS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS
AGO.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING SO
MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING SO
MUCH AT SYRIA LIKE THEY WERE 
WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SO 
CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW BUT I HOPE 
WITH THAT BEING SAID I HOPE THAT
AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AFTER 
THE SANCTIONS KICK IN AND THEY 
ARE BRUTAL WHAT WE'VE PUT ON 
IRAN, I HOPE THAT THEY'RE GOING 
TO COME BACK AND FOESHT A REAL 
DEAL.
I'D LOVE TO DO THAT BUT RIGHT 
NOW IT'S TOO SOON FOR THAT.
YES.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ALSO TALK 
ABOUT ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, EXCHANGING 
AMBASSADORS.
HOW LONG BEFORE THAT HAPPENS?
>> GOOD QUESTION.
HOPEFULLY SOON.
BUT WE'LL HAVE TO GET THINGS 
MOVING FIRST.
VERY -- A LITTLE EARLY FOR THAT.
WE HAVE TO GET THINGS MOVING.
YES, GO AHEAD.
HI.
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY WHEN YOU SAID
YOU'RE STOPPING WAR GAMES SO YOU
ARE STOPPING THE MILITARY 
EXERCISES CAN SOUTH KOREA. 
>> YEAH, WE'VE DONE EXERCISES 
FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME 
WORKING WITH SOUTH KOREA AND WE 
CALL THEM WAR GAMES, I CALL THEM
WAR GAMES AND THEY'RE 
TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE, THE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND ON THAT
IS INCREDIBLE AND SOUTH KOREA 
CONTRIBUTES BUT NOT 100% WHICH 
IS CERTAINLY A SUBJECT THAT WE 
HAVE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT ALSO 
AND HAS TO DO WITH THE MILITARY 
EXPENSE AND ALSO THE TRADE.
SO WE'RE DOING THAT.
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW DEAL WITH
SOUTH KOREA IN TERMS OF THE 
TRADE DEAL BUT WE HAVE TO TALK 
TO THEM.
WE HAVE TO TALK TO MANY COU
COUNTRIES ABOUT TREATING US 
FAIRLY BUT THE WAR GAMES ARE 
VERY EXPENSIVE.
WE PAY FOR A BIG MAJORITY OF 
THEM.
WE FLY IN BOMBERS FROM GUAM.
I SAID IT WHEN I FIRST STARTED, 
I SAID WHERE DO THE BOMBERS COME
FROM?
GUAM.
NEARBY.
I SAID, OH, GREAT, NEARBY.
WHERE IS NEARBY?
6 1/2 HOURS.
6 1/2 HOURS IS A LONG TIME FOR 
THESE BIG MASSIVE PLANES TO BE 
FLYING TO SOUTH KOREA TO 
PRACTICE AND THEN DROP BOMBS ALL
OVER THE PLACE AND THEN GO BACK 
TO GUAM.
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT AIRPLANES.
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
AND WHAT I DID SAY IS AND I 
THINK IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE, I 
HAVE TO TELL YOU, JENNIFER.
IT'S A VERY PROVOCATIVE 
SITUATION.
WHEN I SEE THAT AND YOU HAVE A 
COUNTRY RIGHT NEXT DOOR, SO 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 
WE'RE NEGOTIATING A VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE, COMPLETE DEAL, I 
THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO BE 
HAVING WAR GAMES.
SO NUMBER ONE WE SAVE MONEY.
A LOT.
AND NUMBER TWO, IT REALLY IS 
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THEY'RE 
VERY MUCH APPRECIATING. 
>> DOES NORTH KOREA GIVE YOU 
SOMETHING IN RETURN, THOUGH?
>> WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN -- I'VE 
HEARD THAT.
I MEAN, SOME OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT -- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY REALLY MEAN IT.
I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO GO 
AGAINST THE PRESS, ESPECIALLY 
NOT TODAY THIS.
IS TOO IMPORTANT BUT I NOTICE 
THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
AGREED TO MEET, HE HAS GIVEN UP 
SO MUCH.
I GAVE UP NOTHING.
I'M HERE.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS BUT 
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO 
DO BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN 
NEGOTIATING FOR LITERALLY AROUND
THE CLOCK WITH THEM AND WITH US 
AND WITH JOHN AND MIKE AND A 
WHOLE TEAM OF TALENTED PEOPLE.
BUT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ANYTHING
OTHER THAN YOU'RE RIGHT, I 
AGREED TO MEET AND I THINK THE 
MEETING WAS EVERY BIT AS GOOD 
FOR THE UNITED STATES AS IT WAS 
FOR NORTH KOREA, BUT I JUST 
WROTE DOWN SOME OF THE THINGS WE
GOT, AND THEY -- YOU KNOW, SURE,
THEY GOT A MEETING BUT ONLY A 
PERSON THAT DISLIKES DONALD 
TRUMP WOULD SAY THAT I'VE AGREED
TO MAKE A BIG COMMITMENT.
SURE, I'VE AGREED TO TAKE A 
PERIOD OF TIME AND COME HERE AND
MEET AND THAT'S GOOD BUT I THINK
IT'S GREAT FOR US AND AS A 
COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S GOOD 
FOR THEM.
BUT WHAT DID THEY DO TO JUSTIFY 
THIS MEETING?
SECURED COMMITMENT FOR COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
THAT'S THE BIG THING.
THEY SECURED THE RELEASE OF 
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES.
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEM TO US TWO
MONTHS AGO.
THESE PEOPLE NOW LIVING HAPPILY 
BACK IN THEIR HOMES WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES.
AND IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH FOR 
THEM.
TO PUT IT MILDLY.
SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 
RECOVER THE REMAINS INCLUDING 
THESE ARE OF FALLEN HEROES AND 
THEY'RE GIVING A COMMITMENT.
THEY'RE STARTING IT IMMEDIATELY 
TO RECOVER THE REMAINS AND I 
TESTS THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE 
OF THEIR SINGLE PRIMARY NUCLEAR 
TEST FLIGHT, TEST SITE, ALL 
THREE OF THEM THERE IN AN AREA 
THAT'S COMMON AROUND EACH OTHER.
THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE.
THEY SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 
DESTROY THE MISSILE ENGINE 
TESTING SITE.
THAT WAS NOT IN YOUR AGREEMENT.
I GOT THAT AFTER WE SIGNED THE 
AGREEMENT.
I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR, YOU'VE 
GOT THIS MISSILE ENGINE TESTING 
SITE.
WE KNOW WHERE IT IS.
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, IT'S 
INCREDIBLE, THE EQUIPMENT WE 
HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I SAID, CAN YOU CLOSE IT UP?
HE'S GOING TO CLOSE IT UP.
WE MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO 
CONTINUE TO APPLY SANCTIONS SO 
WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS.
NOW, I HAD 300 SANCTIONS I WAS 
GETTING READY TO PUT ON LAST 
WEEK AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, I 
CAN'T PUT ON SANCTIONS WHEN I'M 
MEETING -- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
VERY DISRESPECTFUL.
300 VERY BIG ONES, POWERFUL 
ONES, AND I SAID IT WOULD BE 
DISRESPECTFUL SO, JENNIFER, WHEN
YOU LOOK AT ALL THOSE THINGS WE 
GOT, AND WHEN WE GOT OUR 
HOSTAGES BACK, I DIDN'T PAY 
1.8 BILLION IN CASH LIKE THE 
HOSTAGES THAT CAME BACK FROM 
IRAN WHICH WAS A DISGRACEFUL 
SITUATION, WHAT TOOK PLACE.
SO WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT SO WHEN I 
HEAR SOMEBODY IN THE MEDIA SAY 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS AGREED 
TO MEET LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
TO MEET.
I THINK WE SHOULD MEET ON A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT TOPICS, NOT JUST 
THIS ONE AND I REALLY BELIEVE A 
LOT OF GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN, 
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> SIR, YOU JUST LISTED OFF A 
LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU GOT IN 
THIS MEETING.
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO YOU SAID 
YOU DEFINE SUCCESS OF THIS 
MEETING BY NORTH KOREA GIVING UP
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON. 
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
>> TALK ABOUT HOW -- 
>> I DON'T THINK -- 
>> KIM JONG-UN FOR A COMPLETE 
VERIFIABLE IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND CAN YOU SAY
WHY YOU DIDN'T SECURE THOSE 
DETAILS IN THIS AGREEMENT?
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIME.
I'M HERE ONE DAY.
WE'RE TOGETHER FOR MANY HOURS 
INTENSIVELY BUT THE PROCESS IS 
NOW GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND I 
WOULD BE SURPRISED, MIKE, IF 
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED 
ALREADY.
THEY HAVE STARTED.
THEY BLEW UP THEIR SITES.
THEY BLEW UP THEIR TESTING SITE.
SO BUT I WILL SAY HE KNEW PRIOR 
TO COMING -- IT WASN'T LIKE A 
SURPRISE.
IT WASN'T LIKE WE'VE NEVER 
DISCUSSED IT.
WE DISCUSSED IT, MIKE DISCUSSED 
IT VERY STRONGLY WITH HIS 
COUNTERPART IN NORTH KOREA.
THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS -- LET'S
SAY THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO IT, I 
COULDN'T SIGN ANY AGREEMENT.
THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT THAT 
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED SO THEY 
UNDERSTOOD THAT.
AND IT WASN'T A BIG POINT TODAY 
BECAUSE REALLY THIS HAD BEEN 
TAKEN CARE OF MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER THING BECAUSE IT WAS ALL 
ABOUT THIS, THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN 
CARE OF BEFORE WE GOT HERE SO 
WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT UP TODAY, 
YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE IS VERY 
STRONG.
IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT.
YES, MA'AM.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
MILITARY CONSEQUENCES FOR NORTH 
KOREA IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON THE COMMITMENTS THAT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. 
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO -- 
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO TALK 
ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE
THREATENING.
I DON'T WANT TO BE THREATENING.
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT AND YOU'VE 
SEEN WHAT WAS PERHAPS GOING TO 
HAPPEN AND SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION 
PEOPLE.
WE THINK WE HAVE BIG CITIES.
YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK WHERE IT 
HAS 8 MILLION.
WE THINK IT'S A BIG CITY.
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE.
THINK OF THAT.
AND IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
BORDER.
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE DMZ.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.
I MEAN, IF THIS WOULD HAVE 
HAPPENED, I THINK -- I'VE HEARD,
OH, 100,000 PEOPLE.
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE LOST 20 
MILLION PEOPLE, 30 MILLION 
PEOPLE.
THIS IS REALLY AN HONOR FOR ME 
TO BE DOING THIS BECAUSE I 
THINK, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY YOU
COULD HAVE LOST, YOU KNOW, 30, 
40, 50 MILLION PEOPLE.
THE CITY OF SEOUL ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD IS 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER.
>> YOU ONCE SPOKE ABOUT FIRE AND
FURY.
IS THAT NO LONGER THE CASE IF AT
THAT TIME WE NEEDED PERHAPS FIRE
AND FURY BECAUSE WE COULD NOT 
HAVE ALLOWED THAT KIND OF 
CAPABILITY FROM THE STANDPOINT 
OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
CERTAINLY JAPAN WASN'T GOING TO 
ALLOW IT EITHER.
JAPAN IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 
>> ONE MORE THING, 
MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE VIDEO THAT YOU SHOWED 
BEFORE THIS?
>> YEAH. 
>> WHEN DID YOU SHOW THAT TO 
KIM?
WHAT WAS THE GOAL THERE. 
>> TODAY, YEAH.
WE HAD IT MADE UP BY SOME -- I 
HOPE YOU LIKED IT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 
ENOUGH TO SHOW.
ONE IN ENGLISH AND ONE IN KOREAN
AND WE HAD IT MADE UP.
I SHOWED IT TO HIM TODAY.
ACTUALLY DURING THE MEETING 
TOWARD THE END OF THE MEETING 
AND I THINK HE LOVED IT.
WE DIDN'T HAVE A BIG SCREEN LIKE
YOU HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING.
WE DIDN'T NEED IT BECAUSE WE HAD
IT ON A CASSETTE -- AN iPAD AND 
THEY PLAYED IT AND ABOUT EIGHT 
OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WERE 
WATCHING IT AND I THOUGHT THEY 
WERE FASCINATED BUT I THOUGHT IT
WAS WELL DONE.
I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE 
THAT'S THE FUTURE.
THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE 
FUTURE.
AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 
JUST NOT A VERY GOOD 
ALTERNATIVE.
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD BUT I SHOWED 
IT BECAUSE I REALLY WANT HIM TO 
DO SOMETHING.
NOW I DON'T THINK I HAD TO SHOW 
IT BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE HE 
WANTS TO -- I THINK HE WANTS TO 
GET IT DONE.
YES, GO AHEAD.
HOW IS STATEN ISLAND FERRY 
DOING, OKAY.
>> GOING WELL. 
>> HE WROTE THE BEST STORY ABOUT
ME WITH THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY 
AND AFTER THAT HE'S NEVER 
WRITTEN A GASH. 
>> THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 
>> IT'S A LONG TIME AGO.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S BEEN A 
BUSY WEEK FOR YOU ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE.
YOU'RE LEAVING THIS SUMMIT IN 
SINGAPORE HAVING DETERMINED THAT
KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED MAN.
YOU LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT A FEW 
DAYS AGO IN CANADA HAVING 
DETERMINED THAT PRIME MINISTER 
TRUDEAU IS WEAK AND DISHONEST.
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICA'S 
ALLIES WHO WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT 
BE JEOPARDIZING OUR LONG-TERM 
ALLIANCES AND WHO WORRY YOU 
MIGHT BE TREATING OUR HISTORIC 
FRIENDS AS AND -- AS ENEMIES AND
ENEMIES AS FRIENDS. 
>> I LEFT THE MEETING AND I'LL 
BE HONEST, WE ARE BEING TAKEN 
ADVANTAGE OF BY VIRTUALLY EVERY 
ONE OF THOSE COUNTRY, VERY, VERY
SERIOUSLY.
NOW, THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE 
OF BAD MANAGEMENT AT THE TOP, 
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENTS THAT 
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT TRADE OR 
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT OR WHATEVER
REASON, FOR MANY YEARS WITH 
CHINA BEING OBVIOUSLY THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL AT IT BUT THE 
EUROPEAN UNION IS SECOND, 151 
BILLION WE LOST, THEY WERE 
REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, AND 
WE'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 
ON TRADE.
CANADA DOES HAVE VERY BIG 
ADVANTAGES OVER US IN TERMS OF 
TRADE DEFICITS.
WE HAVE A BIG TRADE DEFICIT WITH
CANADA.
I WAS RIDING WHERE, OH, IT'S 
ACTUALLY A SURPLUS.
IT'S EITHER 17 BUT IT COULD 
ACTUALLY BE 100.
THEY PUT OUT A DOCUMENT, I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU SAW IT, THEY DIDN'T 
WANT ME TO SEE IT BUT WE FOUND 
IT, PERHAPS THEY WERE TRYING TO 
SHOW THE POWER THEY HAVE.
IT'S CLOSE TO $100 BILLION A 
YEAR LOSS WITH CANADA.
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR FARM 
PRODUCTS, MANY OF THEM.
THEY CHARGE WHAT WAS 270% BUT 
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY 
THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY 
RAISED IT TO 295% FOR DAIRY 
PRODUCTS AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO
OUR FARMERS AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR
TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, 
THE WORKERS, THE FARMERS, THE 
COMPANIES.
AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TRADE.
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS BARRIERS 
UP.
THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TARIFFS SO 
WHEN I PUT IN A COUNTERVEILING 
TARIFF JUST TO GET US UP A 
LITTLE BIT SO THE BALANCE ISN'T 
SO MUCH, IT'S LIKE THIS, THEY 
SAID, OH, THAT IS A-- EVEN IF 
IT'S NOT COMPLETE WE HAVE TO 
HAVE BALANCE.
I SAY IT WITH MANY COUNTRIES, 
ANYWAY, WE CAME -- WE FINISHED 
THE MEETING REALLY EVERYBODY WAS
HAPPY AND I AGREED TO SIGN 
SOMETHING.
I ASKED FOR CHANGES, I DEMANDED 
CHANGES AND THOSE WERE MADE.
IN FACT, THE PICTURE WITH ANGELA
MERKEL WHO I GET ALONG WITH VERY
WELL WHERE I'M SITTING THERE 
LIKE THIS, THAT PICTURE WAS 
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOCK THE 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE 
FINAL DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY THE
CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED.
THAT WAS A VERY FRIENDLY -- I 
KNOW IT DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY AND
WAS REPORTED NASTY BOTH WAYS.
I WAS ANGRY AT HER.
ACTUALLY WE WERE JUST TALKING 
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING 
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING.
VERY FRIENDLY WAITING FOR THE 
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I COULD
READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE.
ANYWAY, I LEFT AND IT WAS VERY 
FRIENDLY.
WHEN I GOT ONTO THE PLANE I 
THINK THAT JUSTIN PROBABLY 
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE 
HAS ABOUT 20 TELEVISIONS AND I 
SEE THE TELEVISION AND HE'S 
GIVING A NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT 
HOW HE WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND
BY THE UNITED STATES.
I SAY PUSH HIM AROUND.
WE JUST SHOOK HANDS.
IT WAS VERY FRIENDLY.
LOOK, COUNTRIES CANNOT CONTINUE 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ON 
TRADE.
THE NUMBERS ARE OUT.
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
AND OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS BUT
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
THIS COUNTRY HAS LOST $800 
BILLION ON TRADE WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST ONE BEING
CHINA.
8$800 BILLION.
151 BILLION WITH THE EUROPEAN 
UNION.
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS BARELY.
THEY DON'T TAKE A LOT OF WHAT WE
HAVE AND YET THEY SEND MERCEDES 
IN TO US.
THEY SEND BMWs IN TO US BY THE 
MILLIONS.
IT'S VERY UNFAIR.
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 
WORKERS AND I'M GOING TO 
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.
IT WON'T EVEN BE TOUGH, OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> MR. PRESIDENT.
>> GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO INVOLVE 
CONGRESS, YES, AND, NO, I HAVE A
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH JUSTIN 
TRUDEAU.
I REALLY DID.
OTHER THAN HE HAD A NEWS 
CONFERENCE THAT HE HAD BECAUSE 
HE ASSUMED I WAS IN AN AIRPLANE 
AND I WASN'T WATCHING.
HE LEARNED.
THAT'S GOING TO COST A LOT OF 
MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE OF CANADA.
HE LEARNED.
YOU CAN'T DO.
WE LAUGHED.
WE HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
I'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH JUSTIN.
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP -- I 
HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH ANGELA MERKEL BUT ON NATO 
WE'RE PAYING 4.2%.
SHE'S PAYING 1% OF A MUCH 
SMALLER GDP THAN WE HAVE.
WE'RE PAYING 4.2% ON A MUCH 
LARGER.
WE'RE PAYING FOR -- ANYONE CAN 
SAY FROM 60 TO 90% OF NATO AND 
WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES OF 
EUROPE AND THEN ON TOP OF IT 
THEY KILL US ON TRADE SO YOU 
JUST CAN'T HAVE IT THAT WAY.
IT'S UNFAIR TO OUR TAXPAYERS AND
TO OUR PEOPLE.
BUT, NO, I HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH JUSTIN AND I 
HAVE
THINK I I HAVE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN KIM.
I HOPE IT'S GOOD BECAUSE IF IT'S
GOOD WE'LL SOLVE A VERY BIG 
PROBLEM AND I THINK WE'VE GONE A
LONG WAY.
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S UP TO THE LEGENDARY SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS.
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING, SARAH?
OKAY.
WE'LL GO.
WELL, I DON'T CARE.
HEY, YOU KNOW, JUST MEANS WE GET
HOME A LITTLE LATER IN THE 
EVENING, RIGHT?
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
SURE.
GO AHEAD.
>> HI, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> HOW ARE YOU?
>> I'M GOOD.
I'M FROM THE TIMES OF SINGAPORE.
WELCOME TO THE COUNTRY.
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR FOOD. 
>> BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.
I DID. 
>> I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT YOU
DESCRIBE THIS AS A PROCESS.
WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP?
IS THERE SOME ONGOING DIALOGUE?
>> YES, WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER 
NEXT WEEK TO GO INTO THE DETAILS
NEXT WEEK WITH JOHN BOLTON AND 
OUR ENTIRE TEAM TO GET THIS 
STUFF DONE.
WE WANT TO GET IT DONE.
HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE.
WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY MUCH 
WITH SOUTH KOREA.
WE'RE WORKING WITH JAPAN.
WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA TO A 
LESSER EXTENT BUT WE'RE WORKING 
WITH CHINA.
>> YOU'RE COMING BACK TO 
SINGAPORE.
>> I WOULD COME BACK GLADLY.
YOUR PRIME MINISTER WAS 
FANTASTIC.
WE WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY.
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB.
VERY WELCOMING.
PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE 
ACTUALLY.
GREAT PLACE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> YES, MA'AM.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THAT FIRST 
INTERACTION WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
THIS MORNING THAT MADE YOU 
DECIDE NOT TO WALK AWAY AFTER 
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD KNOW 
WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE IF HE 
WAS SINCERE. 
>> I'VE SAID THAT ABOUT 
RELATIONSHIP, I'VE SAID THAT 
ABOUT PEOPLE.
YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST SECOND, 
NOW, I WAS GENEROUS, I SAID FIVE
SECONDS, YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST 
SECOND IN SOME CASES, SOMETIMES 
THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT.
BUT SOMETIMES IT DOES.
FROM THE BEGINNING WE GOT ALONG 
BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 
GROUNDWORK.
THIS WASN'T LIKE WE JUST STARTED
TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY COMPLEX
SUBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON
FOR 70 YEARS.
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR 
MONTHS.
AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE RHETORIC
STOPPED, ONCE THEY DID A GREAT 
THING, YOU KNOW, NORTH KOREA DID
A GREAT THING BY GOING TO THE 
OLYMPICS, BECAUSE THE OLYMPICS 
AND PRESIDENT MOON WILL TELL YOU
THIS, THE OLYMPICS WAS NOT 
EXACTLY DOING GREAT.
PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE BEING 
BOMBED OUT OF THE OPENING 
CEREMONIES, YOU KNOW, THEY 
WEREN'T EXACTLY SELLING TICKETS 
AND AS SOON AS -- AS SOON AS THE
CHAIRMAN, CHAIRMAN KIM SAID 
LET'S PARTICIPATE IN THE 
OLYMPICS, IT SOLD LIKE 
WILDPWILDFIRE 
AND WAS A GREAT SUCCESS.
HE DID A GREAT THING BUT SINCE 
THAT TIME, PRETTY MUCH SINCE 
THAT TIME, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW A
DELEGATION CAME FROM SOUTH KOREA
WHO HAD JUST MET TO NORTH KOREA 
AND TOLD ME LOTS OF THINGS 
INCLUDING THE FACT THEY WOULD BE
WILLING TO DENUKE.
WE HAVE ONE OF THEIR GREAT 
PEOPLE HERE TODAY THAT THEY WERE
WILLING TO DENUKE AND ONCE THAT 
STARTED, WE HAVE BEEN -- WE HAVE
BEEN REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT 
FROM THE END OF THE OLYMPICS 
WHEN THE WHOLE DELEGATION CAME 
TO SAY VARIOUS THINGS INCLUDING 
DENUKING. 
>> IF I MAY A SECOND QUESTION.
IN THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU SIGNED 
EARLIER TODAY, NORTH KOREA 
AGREED TO COMMIT TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION.
TO BORROW A PHRASE YOU HAVE USED
TO CRITICIZE YOUR PREDECESSORS 
AND POLITICAL OPPONENTS HOW DO 
YOU ENSURE THAT NORTH KOREA IS 
NOT ALL TALK, NO ACTION?
>> WELL, I THINK CAN YOU ENSURE 
ANYTHING?
CAN I ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING 
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN PROPERLY 
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN?
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ENSURE 
ANYTHING.
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO 
MAKE A DEAL.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEALS.
I'VE DONE GREAT AT IT.
AND THAT'S WHAT I DO.
AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS 
TO DEAL AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY
DOESN'T.
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T.
THAT'S NOT THEIR THING BUT IT IS
MY THING.
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS REALLY COULD
HAVE BEEN DONE, I THINK EASIER A
LONG TIME AGO BUT I KNOW FOR -- 
I JUST FEEL VERY STRONGLY, MY 
INSTINCT, MY ABILITY OR TALENT 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL AND 
MAKING A DEAL IS A GREAT THING 
FOR THE WORLD AND FOR CHINA.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT CHINA IS 
HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY HAVING 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO CLOSE.
SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S CHINA WAS 
VERY HELPFUL.
SO I THINK HE WANTS TO MAKE A 
DEAL.
CAN ANYBODY BE CERTAIN?
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE CERTAIN 
SOON BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATIONS 
CONTINUE.
OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GO AHEAD.
>> YOU MENTION THAT YOU HAVE 
RAISED EXTENSIVELY THE ISSUE OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM.
I WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD SAY TO 
THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
NO ABILITY WHATSOEVER TO HEAR OR
TO SEE THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 
THE 100,000 NORTH KOREANS KEPT 
IN A NETWORK OF GULAGS, HAVE YOU
BETRAYED THEM BY LEGITIMIZING 
THE REGIME IN PYONGYANG?
>> NO, I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM 
BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WILL 
CHANGE.
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY.
ALL I CAN DO IS DO WHAT I CAN 
DO.
WE HAVE TO STOP THE 
NUCLEARIZATION AND HAVE TO DO 
OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT THING.
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK 
ME A MUCH MORE POSITIVE 
QUESTION.
NOT MUCH I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.
AT A CERTAIN POINT I REALLY 
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO DO THINGS 
ABOUT IT.
I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE 
GREAT WINNERS TODAY.
THAT LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I THINK ULTIMATELY THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT 
WINNERS AS A GROUP.
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
YEAH.
>> WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER 
REMOVING THE SANCTIONS WITHOUT 
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE 
HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION?
>> NO, I WANT SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVEMENT.
I WANT TO KNOW IT WON'T BE 
HAPPENING AND, AGAIN, ONCE YOU 
START THAT PROCESS, THERE WILL 
BE A POINT AT WHICH EVEN THOUGH 
YOU WON'T BE FINISHED FOR AWHILE
BECAUSE IT CAN'T HAPPEN 
SCIENTIFICALLY OR MECHANICALLY 
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE 
TO GO BACK.
ONCE WE REACH THAT POINT I'LL 
START TO GIVE THAT VERY SERIOUS 
THOUGHT.
YES, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
YOU FIRST.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DID YOU ALSO 
DISCUSS THE COST OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND HOW ARE 
THEY GOING TO FOOT THE BILL WITH
THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS 
REMAINING IN PLACE. 
>> I THINK SOUTH KOREA AND I 
THINK THAT JAPAN WILL HELP THEM 
VERY GREATLY.
I THINK THEY'RE PREPARED TO HELP
THEM.
THEY ANOTHER THEY'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO HELP THEM.
I THINK THEY WILL HELP THEM VERY
GREATLY.
WE WON'T HAVE TO HAPPEN THEM.
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN 
PAYING A BIG PRICE AT A LOT 
DIFFERENT PLACES BUT SOUTH KOREA
WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS RIGHT NEXT 
DOOR IN JAPAN WHICH ESSENTIALLY 
IS NEXT DOOR, THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE HELPING THEM AND I THINK 
THEY'LL BE DOING A VERY GENEROUS
JOB AND A TERRIFIC JOB SO THEY 
WILL BE HELPING THEM.
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.
YES.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU.
>> I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON 
STEVE'S QUESTION.
HE ASKED YOU HOW LONG IT WOULD 
TAKE TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA.
YOU SAID A LONG TIME.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> WHEN YOU SAY A LONG TIME I 
THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS 
WE CAN DO IT SCIENTIFICALLY AS 
FAST IT CAN BE DONE 
MECHANICALLY.
I DON'T THINK -- I'VE READ 
HORROR STORIES, IT'S A 15-YEAR 
PROCESS ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO 
DO IT QUICKLY, I THINK WHOEVER 
WROTE THAT IS WRONG BUT THERE 
WILL BE A POINT AT WHICH WHEN 
YOU'RE 20% THROUGH YOU CAN'T GO 
BACK. 
>> HOW LONG -- 
>> I HAD AN UNCLE A GREAT 
PROFESSOR FOR I BELIEVE 40 YEARS
AT MIT AND USED TO DISCUSS 
NUCLEAR WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.
HE WAS A GREAT EXPERT.
HE WAS A GREAT, BRILLIANT JEAN 
DR. JOHN TRUMP AT MIT.
I THINK HE WAS THERE 40 YEARS, I
WAS TOLD.
IN FACT, THE HEAD OF MIT SENT ME
A BOOK ON MY UNCLE BUT WE USED 
TO TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR -- TALKING
ABOUT A VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT.
IT'S NOT JUST LIKE, OH, GEE, 
LET'S GET RID OF THE NUKES.
IT TAKES A PERIOD OF TIME BUT 
THE MAIN PERIOD OF TIME THAT I'M
TALKING IS THAT FIRST PERIOD 
WHEN YOU HIT A CERTAIN POINT, 
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.
IT'S VERY HARD TO GO BACK.
>> HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?
>> WE DON'T KNOW BUT IT'LL GO 
PRETTY QUICKLY.
GO AHEAD.
SURE.
>> THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT.
I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ON THE
SANCTIONS CAMPAIGN.
YOU ALLUDED AT THE VERY 
BEGINNING THAT THE CHINESE ARE 
NOT DOING AS GREAT A JOB 
SECURING THE BORDER AS THEY WERE
BEFORE.
YOU EXPRESSED, YOU KNOW, SOME 
DOUBTS WHEN KIM WENT TO SEE 
PRESIDENT XI.
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WAS
IN PYONGYANG AND SAID THERE 
SHOULDN'T BE ANY SANCTIONS WHILE
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDER WAY
AND THE SOUTH KOREANS ARE NOW 
TALKING ABOUT RESTORING SOME 
FORM OF TRADE.
SO WITH ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS 
APPEARING TO BE MOVING TOWARD 
ERODING SANCTIONS, HOW CAN YOU 
KEEP THE SANCTIONS REGIME IN 
PLACE?
WHAT LEVERAGE DO YOU HAVE ON 
THESE COUNTRYS?
>> I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF 
LEVERAGE.
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
LEVERAGE.
I DO BELIEVE THAT CHINA DESPITE 
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT 
XI, A MAN I TOLD YOU I HAVE 
GREAT RESPECT FOR AND LIKE A 
LOT, WE'RE HAVING TOUGH TALKS ON
TRADE.
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 
AFFECTS CHINA SOMEWHAT BUT I 
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
AND I THINK OVER THE LAST TWO 
MONTHS THE BORDER IS MORE OPEN 
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED.
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS.
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS, TREMENDOUS
DEFICIT IN TRADE.
COMMONLY KNOWN AS A TRADE 
DEFICIT.
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN 
TRADE WITH CHINA.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT.
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN.
AND I THINK THAT HAS HAD AN 
IMPACT ON MY RELATIONSHIP IN 
TERMS OF THE BORDER.
I DON'T THINK IF -- I DON'T 
THINK IT AFFECTS MY FEELING ON 
PRESIDENT XI BUT WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED WE WEREN'T READY TO GO 
THAT ROUTE AND AS WE STARTED 
PREPARING AND GETTING READY TO 
DO THAT, I THINK THAT'S HAD AN 
IMPACT ON FRANKLY THE BORDER.
WHICH IS A SHAME BUT I HAVE TO 
DO IT.
I HAVE NO CHOICE.
FOR OUR COUNTRY I HAVE TO DO IT.
SOUTH KOREA WILL DO WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO GET A DEAL DONE.
IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T TRADE 
THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRADE.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO 
TRADE.
IF THEY THINK AND THEY WOULD DO 
THIS WITH OUR CONCURRENCE.
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO SOME 
WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY FAR 
DOWN THE LINE WE'RE FAR.
THAT DOCUMENT WHEN YOU READ IT 
TODAY, THAT'S FAR DOWN THE LINE.
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST 
HAPPENED TO BE PUT TOGETHER.
THIS WAS DONE OVER MONTHS AND, 
AGAIN, THE RHETORIC WAS 
IMPORTANT AND THE SANCTIONS WERE
IMPORTANT.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE WAS 
MORE IMPORTANT.
THEY WERE BOTH IMPORTANT.
GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DAVID SANGER 
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF WHETHER 
THE CHAIRMAN KIM TOLD YOU HOW 
MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HE BELIEVES
HE'S MADE, WHETHER HE'S WILLING 
TO TURN THOSE OVER FIRST AND 
THEN WHETHER IN YOUR MIND YOU 
NEED TO DO MORE THAN WAS DONE IN
THE IRAN DEAL FOR ACTUALLY 
DISMANTLING THE -- BOTH THE 
URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM PROCESSES 
AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A 
SENSE THAT CHAIRMAN KIM REALLY 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT INVOLVES 
AND HAD A TIMETABLE IN HIS OWN 
MIND OF SHUTTING THAT.
>> WELL, DAVID, I CAN TELL YOU 
HE UNDERSTANDS.
HE UNDERSTANDS IT SO WELL.
HE UNDERSTANDS IT BETTER THAN 
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE 
WORK FOR HIM.
THAT IS AN EASY ONE.
AS FAR AS WHAT HE HAS, IT'S 
SUBSTANTIAL.
VERY SUBSTANTIAL.
THE TIMING WILL GO QUICKLY.
I BELIEVE YOU'LL SEE SOME GOOD 
ACTION.
I MEAN, AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE
THINGS WITH THE MISSILE SET, I 
THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY SURPRISED 
TO HEAR, THE MISSILE SITE.
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE, DAVID, 
IT'S GOING TO GO VERY QUICKLY.
I REALLY BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO 
GO FAST AND IT IS A VERY 
SUBSTANTIAL ARSENAL.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, I USED TO SAY MAYBE 
IT'S ALL TALK AND NO ACTION.
BUT WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD 
INTELLIGENCE INTO THAT ALTHOUGH 
PROBABLY LESS THERE THAN ANY 
OTHER COUNTRY.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE BETTER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE ROOM.
WE HAVE ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT THEY
HAVE IS SUBSTANTIAL.
THIS IS WHY, DAVID, I ALWAYS SAY
THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN PLACE 
SO LATE INTO THE PROCESS.
WOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN BETTER 
IF IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO OR 20 
YEARS AGO OR 15 YEARS AGO WHEN 
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT 
NOT HAVING A SUCCESSFUL MEETING 
LIKE TODAY.
I STILL LOVE MY FIRST INTERVIEW 
WITH YOU, DAVID.
I STILL HAVE THAT INTERVIEW 
ACTUALLY.
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> MY QUESTION IS IF THERE IS A 
SECOND SUMMIT -- THAT'S OKAY.
IF THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT WITH
CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN WILL IT BE 
IN PYONGYANG OR WASHINGTON?
>> WE HAVEN'T SET THAT UP.
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 
SUMMIT.
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED OR MEETING.
WE CAN USE A DIFFERENT TERM.
BUT WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 
ONE.
I WILL SAY THIS, WE'RE MUCH 
FURTHER ALONG THAN I WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT.
I DID NOT THINK WE'D BE HERE.
I TOLD PEOPLE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BUILD PEOPLE'S 
HOPES UP TOO MUCH.
I TOLD PEOPLE I THOUGHT THIS 
WOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL MEETING IF
WE GOT ALONG.
WE DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP AND 
WE COULD HAVE MAYBE GOTTEN TO 
THIS POINT IN THREE OR FOUR 
MONTHS FROM NOW.
BUT IT REALLY HAPPENED VERY 
QUICKLY.
A LOT OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE
FOUNDATION THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, 
PUT DOWN BEFORE WE MET.
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED VERY 
FAST.
WE DIDN'T HAVE AS AN EXAMPLE 
BRINGING BACK THE REMAINS, THAT 
WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS ON OUR
AGENDA TODAY.
I BROUGHT IT UP AT THE VERY END 
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE TALKED TO
ME ABOUT IT AND I BROUGHT IT UP 
AT THE VERY END AND HE WAS 
REALLY VERY GRACIOUS AND INSTEAD
OF SAYING LET'S TALK ABOUT IT 
THE NEXT TIME, HE SAID IT MAKES 
SENSE.
WE WILL DO IT.
HE KNEW -- THEY KNOW WHERE MANY 
OF THOSE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE.
WHERE THEY'RE BURIED ALONG 
ROADS, ALONG HIGHWAYS, ALONG 
PATHS, USUALLY, BECAUSE OUR 
SOLDIERS WERE MOVING BACK AND 
FORTH AND HAD TO MOVE RAPIDLY.
IT'S VERY SAD.
BUT HE KNEW AND THAT WAS BROUGHT
UP AT THE VERY END AND, YOU 
KNOW, REALLY GREAT THAT HE WAS 
ABLE TO DO IT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> FROM AMERICAN NEWS, 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THE NICE WAY 
YOU'RE TREATING US.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
REALLY, IT'S VERY GOOD.
REALLY BEAUTIFUL WHAT YOU DO.
GO AHEAD.
>> SO, YOU'VE -- 
N
>> NOW I WILL PROBABLY GET THIS 
KILLER QUESTION. 
>> SPECIFICALLY THE PEOPLE -- 
KIM JONG-UN IS SAYING HE'S 
WANTING A BRIGHTER FUTURE WITH 
PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE YET WE
KNOW THEY LIVED UNDER 
OPPRESSION.
YOU SHOWED HIM THIS VIDEO OF 
WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BE LIKE.
BUT DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA 
SPECIFICALLY OF THE MODEL THAT 
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TOWARDS?
ECONOMICALLY IS HE OPEN TO MORE 
ECONOMIC FREEDOM. 
>> A GOOD QUESTION.
SO YOU SAW A TAPE TODAY AND I 
THINK WAS DONE REALLY WELL BUT 
THAT WAS DONE AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVEL OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
I TOLD HIM, YOU MAY NOT WANT 
THIS.
YOU MAY WANT TO DO A MUCH 
SMALLER VERSION OF THIS.
I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING BUT YOU MAY WANT TO DO
A SMALLER VERSION.
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT WITH THE 
TRAINS AND EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW,
SUPER EVERYTHING AT THE TOP.
AND MAYBE YOU WON'T WANT THAT.
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM.
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM AND 
UP TO THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.
THEY MAY NOT WANT THAT.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT TOO BUT 
THAT WAS A VERSION OF WHAT COULD
HAPPEN, WHAT COULD TAKE PLACE.
AS AN EXAMPLE THEY HAVE GREAT 
BEACHES.
YOU SEE THAT WHENEVER THEY'RE 
EXPLODING THEIR CANNONS INTO THE
OCEAN, RIGHT.
I SAID, BOY, LOOK AT THAT.
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A GREAT 
CONDO.
I EXPLAINED INSTEAD OF DOING 
THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE BEST 
HOTELS IN THE WORLD RIGHT THERE.
THINK OF IT FROM A REAL ESTATE 
PERSPECTIVE.
SOUTH KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA AND 
THEY OWN THE LAND IN THE MIDDLE.
HOW BAD IS THAT?
RIGHT?
IT'S GREAT.
BUT I TOLD THEM, I SAID YOU MAY 
NOT WANT TO DO WHAT'S THERE.
YOU MAY WANT TO DO A SMALLER 
VERSION OF IT OR, YOU KNOW, AND 
THAT COULD BE.
ALTHOUGH I TELL YOU WHAT, HE 
LOOKED AT THAT TAPE.
HE LOOKED AT THAT iPAD AND I'M 
TELLING YOU THEY REALLY ENJOYED 
IT, I BELIEVE.
OKAY.
YEAH, GO AHEAD.
A COUPLE OF MORE.
OKAY, WE'LL DO THREE MORE.
GO AHEAD.
GO.
>> FROM "TIME" MAGAZINE.
>> HI, BRIAN.
AM I ON THE COVER AGAIN THIS 
WEEK?
GO AHEAD.
I MIGHT BE.
>> ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. 
>> I KNOW.
>> DO YOU KNOW SEE KIM JONG-UN 
AS AN EQUAL?
>> IN WHAT WAY?
>> YOU JUST SHOWED A VIDEO THAT 
SHOWED YOU AND KIM JONG-UN ON 
EQUAL FOOTING IN DISCUSSING THE 
FUTURE. 
>> NO, I THINK THAT -- I DON'T 
VIEW IT THAT WAY.
I DON'T VIEW IT THAT WAY.
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO 
MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE.
IF I HAVE TO SAY I'M SITTING ON 
A STAGE, I MEAN I UNDERSTAND 
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT, IF I 
HAVE TO SAY I'M SITTING ON A 
STAGE WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
THAT'S GOING TO GET US TO SAVE 
30 MILLION LIVES, COULD BE MORE 
THAN THAT, I'M WILLING TO SIT ON
THE STAGE.
I'M WILLING TO TRAVEL TO 
SINGAPORE VERY PROUDLY, VERY 
GLADLY.
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THE 
FACT THAT IT IS TAKING MY TIME, 
THEY HAVE GIVEN UP A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT.
THEY'VE GIVEN IT UP EVEN BEFORE 
AND EVEN ADD THE OLYMPICS TO IT.
YOU COULD ADD THE OLYMPICS TO 
THE QUESTION.
THEY WENT TO THE OLYMPICS.
THEY TOOK AN OLYMPICS THAT WAS 
GOING TO BE A MASSIVE FAILURE 
THAT MAYBE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN 
OPENED AND MADE IT A TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS BY AGREEING TO 
PARTICIPATE.
ADD THAT TO THE LIST OF THINGS 
THAT THEY'VE DONE.
SO, BRIAN, IF I CAN SAVE 
MILLIONS OF LIVES BY COMING HERE
SITTING DOWN AND ESTABLISHING A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE WHO IS
A VERY POWERFUL MAN WHO'S GOT 
FIRM CONTROL OF A COUNTRY AND 
THAT COUNTRY HAS VERY POWERFUL 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IT'S MY HONOR TO
DO IT.
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THE 
VIDEO YOU JUST SHOWED TO BE USED
BY KIM AS PROPAGANDA TO SHOW 
HIM -- 
>> NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.
WE CAN USE THAT VIDEO FOR OTHER 
COUNTRIES.
GO AHEAD.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IN THE YEAR 
2000 PRESIDENT CLINTON GOT 
AGGRESSED BY KIM JONG-UN -- 
>> GOT IMPRESSED.
>> GOT A REQUEST.
>> OH. 
>> FROM KIM JONG-UN TO TRAVEL TO
PYONGYANG AND MEET HIM AND 
CLINTON REFUSED.
HE SEND SECRETARY OF STATE 
ALBRIGHT. 
>> HE DID A GREAT DEAL AND SPENT
$3 BILLION AND GOT NOTHING.
STARTED MAKING NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS -- 
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU ON THE 
OTHER HAND GOT THE REQUEST AND 
RIGHT AWAY WENT HERE TO MEET HIM
AND DO YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT YOU GAVE HIM
THE ULTIMATE PRESENT, A 
LEGITIMACY TO A REGIME THAT 
OPPRESSES ITS PEOPLE WITHOUT 
ONGOING PROCESS BEFORE YOU AS 
THE U.S. PRESIDENT AS THE LEADER
OF THE FREE WORLD MEET, SHAKE 
HANDS WITH THIS LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA WHICH IS PERCEIVED TO BE 
OPPRESSING BRUTALLY HIS OWN 
PEOPLE.
>> OKAY, GOOD, I THINK WE JUST 
ANSWERED THE QUESTION.
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND -- 
>> I UNDERSTAND IT MUCH BETTER 
THAN YOU DO.
GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> I'M WITH POLITICO.
>> HI.
>> HI.
YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE SPECIFIC 
CONCESSIONS THAT YOU GOT FROM 
KIM, THE RETURN OF REMAINS AND 
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR 
SITE AND I KNOW YOU SAID -- 
>> MUCH MORE. 
>> THE LAST WAS AN ADD-ON BUT HE
GAVE YOU HIS WORD.
IF HE DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON 
THESE THINGS, WHAT ARE YOU 
PREPARED TO DO IN RESPONSE AND 
WILL YOU LOSE FAITH IN THIS 
PROCESS?
>> NO, I THINK HE'LL DO IT.
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT.
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE DOING 
THIS.
I REALLY BELIEVE AND IT WAS 
REALLY THE ENGINE TESTING SITE 
IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER 
THINGS THAT THEY'VE AGREED TO 
DO, IT WAS THE -- THEY'VE GOT A 
VERY POWERFUL ENGINE SITE AND 
WE'RE ABLE TO SEE BECAUSE OF THE
HEAT THAT IT EMITS AND, YEAH, 
I'M ABLE TO -- I'M VERY HAPPY, 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I'M HAPPY 
WITH THOSE TWO POINTS THAT YOU 
MENTIONED BUT YOU MIGHT BE 
REFERRING TO THE THING THAT'S 
NOT IN WHICH IS THE ENGINE 
TESTING SITE.
I THINK HE'S -- I THINK HONESTLY
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO THESE 
THINGS.
I MAY BE WRONG AND MAY STAND 
BEFORE YOU IN SIX MONTHS AND 
SAY, HEY, I WAS WRONG.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL EVER 
ADMIT THAT BUT I'LL FIND SOME 
KIND OF EXCUSE.
OKAY, ONE -- ONE MORE.
>> IN THE -- 
>> THANKS, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> MEDIA GROUP CHINA.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WOULD YOU 
CALL THE U.S. PRESIDENCY WHEN 
YOU COME BACK TO D.C. TO DISCUSS
ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS YOU MADE 
TODAY WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND -- 
>> I WILL. 
>> WHAT'S YOUR EXPECTATION ABOUT
CHINA'S ROLE TO ACCELERATE THE 
PROCESS TO ESTABLISH LONG-TERM 
PEACE MECHANISM?
>> WELL, MY EXPECTATION ABOUT 
CHINA IS THAT CHINA IS A GREAT 
COUNTRY WITH A GREAT LEADER AND 
A FRIEND OF MINE.
AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HE'S 
HAPPY THAT WE'VE MADE THIS KIND 
OF PROGRESS AND I'VE HEARD FROM 
HIM BUT I WILL BE CALLING HIM 
SHORTLY.
MAYBE EVEN BEFORE I LAND, OKAY.
AND I HAVE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, AND
THE UNITED STATES IS A GREAT 
COUNTRY AND WE HAVE SET RECORDS 
ECONOMICALLY OVER $7 TRILLION IN
NET WORTH ADDITION TO WHAT WE 
HAVE AND WE ARE ALMOST TWICE THE
SIZE -- THE ECONOMY OF THE 
UNITED STATES, NOBODY TALKS 
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU DO HEAR A
LOT ABOUT CHINA RIGHTFULLY SO 
BUT THE UNITED STATES NOW IS 
ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE OF THE 
ECONOMY OF CHINA.
WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY AND 
WE'RE ON A CORRECT PATH.
OKAY.
ONE MORE.
THAT WILL BE IT.
>> SOUTH KOREA.
WHERE IS SOUTH KOREA.
I THINK YOU DESERVE -- GO AHEAD.
GO.
YOU DESERVE ONE.
YES.
YOU DESERVE ONE.
>> I'VE GOT TWO QUESTIONS FOR 
YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
FIRST, YOU MENTIONED EARLIER 
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TALK WITH 
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON 
JAE-IN OVER THE PHONE.
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DISCUSS WITH
HIM?
>> I JUST WANT TO TELL HIM ABOUT
THE MEETING.
VERY SUCCESSFUL AND HE'LL BE 
VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN THE FINAL 
NEGOTIATION.
HE'S A VERY, VERY FINE 
GENTLEMAN, ALSO A FRIEND OF MINE
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING 
TO HIM.
HE'LL BE VERY HAPPY -- I'VE 
ALREADY SENT WORD TO HIM ABOUT 
WHAT HAPPENED.
I SENT THE DOCUMENT TO HIM 
ACTUALLY AND ALL OF THE DETAILS 
BEHIND THE DOCUMENT.
SO I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM VERY 
SHORTLY. 
>> IN SIGNING THE PEACE TREATY 
DO YOU HOPE TO -- DO YOU PLAN TO
WORK THIS OUT WITH NORTH KOREA'S
CHAIRMAN KIM ONLY OR WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF 
SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA AS THE 
SIGNATORIES. 
>> I'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM 
INVOLVED ALSO.
>> BOTH OF THEM. 
>> A QUESTION WHETHER WE'RE 
LEGALLY HAVE TO, I DON'T CARE.
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO 
HAVE CHINA INVOLVED AND ALSO, OF
COURSE, SOUTH KOREA.
>> THANK YOU.
>> WHAT?
.
>> MIKE, DO VERY HAVE A 
TRANSCRIPT?
THEY PROBABLY HAVE A ROUGH 
TRANSCRIPT IF YOU HAVE ONE.
NO.
THEY DIDN'T RECORD IT.
I DON'T THINK THEY RECORDED IT.
ARE THERE ANY RECORDINGS OF IT?
I WISH THERE WERE.
BECAUSE IT IS INTERESTING STUFF.
SAY IT -- 
. 
>> I DON'T.
WE PROBABLY HAVE NOTES OR 
SOMETHING BUT THEY HAVE ACTUALLY
DETAILED NOTES I WOULD IMAGINE.
BUT WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION.
IT WAS A VERY HEARTFELT 
CONVERSATION.
.
I DON'T HAVE TO VERIFY BECAUSE I
HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT MEMORIES 
OF ALL TIME SO I DON'T HAVE.
OKAY.
OKAY.
>> WHAT WE DID IS WE'VE HAD 
NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS, WE'VE HAD 
VERY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS 
ESTABLISHED AT MIKE'S LEVEL AND 
OTHER LEVELS, IN FACT, A COUPLE 
OF PEOPLE ARE HERE FROM AS YOU 
KNOW FROM NORTH KOREA.
THEY'RE IN THE ROOM.
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE BACK
ALSO FROM THE ROOM.
SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS FINAL 
AGREEMENT, VERY IMPORTANTLY WE 
DIDN'T GO IN COLD BUT WITH 
TREMENDOUS RELATIONSHIP AND 
TREMENDOUS KNOWLEDGE AND I THINK
THAT'S WHY WE GOT IT DONE.
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS BUT
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE
TAKEN IT EASY.
I HOPE WE'VE ANSWER THE YOUR 
QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH AND SORT OF CONGRAT LAYINGS
TO EV
 -- CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S AN IMPORTANT EVENT IN WORLD
HISTORY AND TO BE REALLY TRUE TO
MYSELF I HAVE TO ADD I WANT TO 
GET IT COMPLETED SO, MIKE, OUR 
WHOLE TEAM HAS TO GET TO WORK 
AND GET IT COMPLETED BECAUSE 
OTHERWISE WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB 
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THE BALL 
OVER THE GOAL LINE, IT DOESN'T 
MEAN ENOUGH.
OKAY.
SO THANK YOU AND SORT OF 
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY IN 
THE ROOM.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.
>> CANDOR FROM THE PRESIDENT WHO
SAID HE NOW WANTS TO COMPLETE 
THIS, WANTS TO GET THE BALL OVER
THE FINISH LINE.
YOU HEARD HIM TALKING FOR MORE 
THAN AN HOUR FROM REPORTERS ALL 
OVER THE WORLD ABOUT THE HISTORY
THAT UNFOLDED IN SINGAPORE 
MEETING FACE-TO-FACE, THE FIRST 
TIME A SITTING UNDER ARMOUR 
PRESIDENT MET FACE-TO-FACE WITH 
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND IN
TALKING TO THEM HE TURNED TO THE
AGREEMENT THAT THEY SIGNED, A 
LETTER THEY SIGNED POINTING TO 
THAT ONE LINE, UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION POINTING TO 
THAT LINE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
HE SAID WITHOUT THE RHETORIC 
RATCHETING UP THE RHETORIC THIS 
LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.
HE WAS ASKED ABOUT THE 
SANCTIONS.
HE SAID THEY WILL COME OFF WHEN 
NUKES ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR AND
SAID HE HOPES SANCTIONS WILL 
COME OFF SOON.
AND WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE U.S. 
MILITARY, HE SAID THERE WILL BE 
NOT ANY REDUCTION IN THE NUMBERS
OF U.S. MILITARY ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IN THE REGION BUT THAT
THE WAR GAMES COMMONLY SEEN WITH
SOUTH KOREA WILL COME TO AN END 
AND WILL SAVE THE U.S. A LOT OF 
MONEY IN HIS WORDS.
HE DID SAY HE WOULD TRAVEL TO 
PYONGYANG WHEN THE TIME IS 
RIGHT.
AND THAT HE WOULD INVITE 
CHAIRMAN KIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
AGAIN, POINTING OUT WHEN THE 
TIME IS RIGHT.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 
JONATHAN KARL IN THE ROOM.
YOU HEARD HIM DESCRIBE KIM AS 
VERY TALENTED.
VERY SMART AND GOOD NEGOTIATOR.
>> WARM WORDS ABOUT CHAIRMAN 
KEEP.
HE ALSO FACED SOME QUESTIONS, I 
ASKED HIM ABOUT THE HUMAN RIGHTS
SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA.
IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO, DAVID, 
THAT THE PRESIDENT IN HIS STATE 
OF THE UNION ADDRESS SAID THAT 
KIM JONG-UN LEADS THE MOW 
REPRESSIVE REGIME ON THE PLANET.
HE SPOKE VERY FORCEFULLY ABOUT 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION BACK 
THEN.
NOW, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED LIKE IT
WAS NOT A MAJOR PART OF THIS 
DISCUSSION ALTHOUGH IT WAS 
INTERESTING IN HIS ANSWER TO ME 
ON THAT, HE BOTH SAID HE SPOKE 
VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN THE MEETING AND HE SPOKE 
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN THE MEALING BUT THE BOTTOM 
LINE HERE IS THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVES THAT HE IS ON A PATH 
TOWARDS PEACE, THAT THIS WAS A 
LANDMARK DAY FOR HIM.
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM ANSWER 
QUESTIONS IN A VENUE ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS.
THIS IS REALLY HIS FIRST FULL 
BLOWN PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE 
FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR.
HE CLEARLY CONSIDERS THIS A 
LANDMARK ACHIEVEMENT, A 
SIGNATURE ACHIEVEMENT AND WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT IT ALTHOUGH IT WAS
EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE 
MANY, MANY DETAILS THAT ARE 
NOWHERE NEAR WORKED OUT AND WE 
ARE A LONG WAY FROM AN ACTUAL 
AGREEMENT ON DENUCLEARIZATION.
>> TWO OF THOSE KEY DEALS 
UNANSWERED, THOSE KEY QUESTIONS,
JON, AS YOU POINT ARE IS HOW 
MUCH HUMAN RIGHTS WERE 
DISCUSSED.
HE SAID IF HIS ANSWER TO JON 
KARL IT WAS DISCUSSED ABOUT THAT
THEY'LL NEED TO DIVE INTO IT 
MORE DEEPLY AND, OF COURSE, HOW 
HE WILL VERIFY THAT COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION ACTUALLY 
HAPPENS THAT, IS GOING TO BE THE
BIGGEST HURDLE GOING FORWARD, 
MARTHA RADDATZ. 
>> IT ABSOLUTELY WILL BE AND WE 
NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT AND
I'M SURE WE WILL LEARN MORE 
ABOUT IT IN THE FUTURE.
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK 
BY IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 
AGAIN, IT WAS WELL OVER AN HOUR,
HE HAD REAL COMMAND OF THE 
ISSUES.
I THINK HE ENJOYED TAKING ALL 
THOSE QUESTIONS.
HE LIKED LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HOW
MUCH HE KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
I THINK ALL OF THIS WILL 
EMBOWLEN AND EMPOWER PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE 
SECOND HALF OF HIS PRESIDENCY 
BECAUSE THIS MAXIMUM PRESSURE 
CAMPAIGN BROUGHT US TO WHERE WE 
ARE TODAY.
THERE'S LOTS TO BE DONE.
THERE'S LOTS OF DETAIL.
THERE'S LOTS OF VERIFICATION 
THAT HAS TO HAPPEN BUT FOR NOW 
THAT CAMPAIGN WORKED. 
>> AND FOR A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS
THE MEDIA AND KNOWS HOW TO 
INTERACT HE LOOKED OUT AND SAID 
THE NUMBER OF REPORTERS FROM ALL
OVER THE WORLD HAVE AN IMPACT 
EVEN ON HIM AND MADE HIM FEEL 
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT ANSWERED 
QUESTIONS WITH A CALM DEMEANOR 
WHICH I THOUGHT TOM BOSSERT 
REFLECTED HIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE HISTORY, THE POSSIBILITIES 
OF THIS MOMENT AND AS I 
MENTIONED, HIS CANDOR IN THE END
THERE SAYING THIS IS HISTORY BUT
IT ALSO HAS TO BE COMPLETED.
HE RECOGNIZES THAT. 
>> I THINK MARTHA IS RIGHT.
THIS WAS A PRESIDENT IN COMMAND 
OF HIS MATERIAL.
I'VE SEEN HIM IN COMMAND OF HIS 
MATERIAL PRIVATELY BUT THIS 
PUBLICLY WAS REALLY SOMETHING TO
WATCH.
I THINK WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO WAKE UP TO NOW TO 
TODAY IS FIND THIS PRESIDENT HAS
NOW SECURED A BLUEPRINT FOR 
PEACE.
IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING 
OF AN ARDUOUS PROCESS AND IT 
WILL TAKE TIME BUT IT'S 
REMARKABLE. 
>> HE WAS ASKED BY OUR OWN 
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS SHORTLY 
AFTER THAT WAS SIGNED DO YOU 
TRUST KIM JONG-UN AND HE SAID, 
I, IN FACT, DO TRUST HIM AT 
LEAST FOR NOW AND HE SAID AT THE
END OF THAT PRESS CONFERENCE 
THAT AS WE MENTIONED LASTED 
LONGER THAN AN HOUR COMFORTABLE 
TAKING QUESTIONS ON THE SCOPE, 
WIDE RANGES QUESTIONS ON THIS 
MATERIAL, HIS COMMAND OF THE 
MATERIAL, SAYING, PERHAPS HE'LL 
BE BACK IN FRONT OF YOU SIX 
MONTHS SAYING I WAS WRONG.
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WITH GEORGE
STEPHANOPOULOS, I TRUSTED HIM IN
THIS INTERVIEW BUT WE'LL HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE.
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF 
THEY DO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AS PROMISED AND
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW IT AS A TEAM.
WE'VE BEEN ON THE WORLD SINCE 
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" LAST NIGHT 
FOR MANY OF THESE HOURS AS IT'S 
UNFOLDED.
HISTORY IN THE MAKING.
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS IN 
INTERVIEW WITH THE PRESIDENT 
COMING UP ON "GOOD MORNING 
AMERICA" AND FOR MANY OF YOU IN 
THE EAST BACK IN THE U.S. YOUR 
LOCAL NEWS COMES UP NEXT.
I'M DAVID MUIR FROM ALL OF US 
HERE AT ABC NEWS, THANKS FOR 
SPENDING MUCH OF THIS EVENING.
THIS OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH US AS 
HISTORY IS MADE HERE IN 
SINGAPORE.
GOOD DAY.
>> Announcer: THIS HAS BEEN A 
SPECIAL REPORT FROM ABC NEWS.
ORDEROUS PROCESS.
OUR EYES ARE WIDE OPEN.
PEACE IS ALWAYS WORTH THE 
EFFORT.
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A 
LONG TIME AGO. 
>> SPEAKING MOMENTS AGO AFTER 
SIGNING A HISTORIC DOCUMENT 
ALONG WITH NORTH KOREA'S LEADER 
KIM JONG-UN AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S TEAM IS ACTUALLY RIGHT 
NOW CONTACTING MANY OF OUR 
ALLIES ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE 
THIS MORNING. 
>> HE'S BEEN TALKING WITH TOP 
OFFICIALS FROM SOUTH KOREA AND 
JAPAN.
PASSING ALONG DETAILS FROM THE 
SUMMIT.
ABC'S BOB WOODRUFF HAS BEEN 
REPORTING FROM SOUTH KOREA AND 
HAS REACTION FROM THERE. 
>> Reporter: THE SOUTH KOREANS 
ARE -- THEY'RE PRETTY HOPEFUL 
SEEING SOME OF THE RESULTS.
RIGHT DOWNTOWN SEOUL AND WANT TO
SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS
CAPITAL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOW 
STARTING TO COME OUT OF WORK A 
LITTLE BIT.
IT'S BEEN PRETTY DULL MOST OF 
THE DAY.
BUT NOW THEY'RE HITTING THE 
STREETS.
THIS IS THE BLUE HOUSE, THIS IS 
THEIR EQUIVALENT OF THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE POLITICS 
HAPPENS.
THIS IS WHERE ALL THE BIG 
MEETINGS ARE HAPPENING.
BUT THIS IS DOWNTOWN.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE OF 
THINGS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE 
U.S. EMBASSY.
YOU CAN SEE THE AMERICAN FLAG 
RIGHT THERE.
SO THAT'S GUARDED OUTSIDE BY 
MULTIPLE GUARDS.
THE POLICE OFFICES ARE OUTSIDE.
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE THIS IS 
FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN 
THIS, SOMEBODY SAYING AGAINST 
THE PEACE TALKS WITHOUT NORTH 
KOREANS HUMAN RIGHTS, SO PEOPLE 
WANT THIS TO BE TALKED ABOUT AT 
THIS SUMMIT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, LISTEN, KIM
JONG-UN IS NOT THIS PEACEFUL 
MAN.
THIS IS ONE WHO COMMITTED A LOT 
OF CRIMES.
HE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING HIS HALF
BROTHER AND HIS UNCLE SO THEY 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT TOPIC AS
WELL.
SO EXACTLY WHAT THE REACTION TO 
THIS SUMMIT IS STILL PRETTY 
UNCLEAR BUT PEOPLE ARE STARTING 
TO TALK TO ME AND THEY SAID THAT
THEY'RE HAPPY THAT SOMETHING 
POSITIVE COULD COME OUT OF IT 
BUT THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THIS IS DONE PROPERLY.
THEY TRUST PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT 
DON'T REALLY TRUST KIM JONG-UN 
AT ALL.
PART OF IT IS THAT HISTORY.
NORTH KOREA, WE DON'T REALLY 
KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE'S REAL 
THOUGHTS ARE.
YOU KNOW, INSIDE THEIR SOUL IT'S
HARD TO KNOW.
EVERY TIME WE VISIT NORTH KOREA 
WE'RE SURROUNDED BY MINDERS.
THE JOURNALISTS CAN'T TALK TO 
THE PEOPLE WITHOUT REAL FREEDOM.
THEY ALSO LISTEN TO WHAT THE 
CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY ARE 
SAYING WHEN THEY'RE INTERVIEWED 
BY US SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW 
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING BUT 
CERTAINLY IT'S SHOCKING THEY'VE 
HEARD ALL THESE DETAILS OF THEIR
LEADER, THIS TRIP TO SINGAPORE 
TO WATCH HIM AND SAY, YOU KNOW, 
WITH VIDEOS OF HIMMING, PICTURES
OF HIM IN A PLACE THAT'S NEVER 
BEEN DONE BEFORE SO WAIT AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS IN SEOUL BUT IT'S 
STARTING TO UNFOLD A LITTLE. 
>> MANY ARE WAITING AND SEEING 
AND HEARD FROM THE CHINESE 
FOREIGN MINISTER CALLING THIS 
AGREEMENT CREATING A NEW HISTORY
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID 
HE ALSO SPOKE WITH JAPAN AND 
SOUTH KOREA OVERNIGHT AS WELL. 
>> THERE ARE MANY HEADLINES BACK
IN THE U.S. INCLUDING THE 
TABLOIDS HERE IN NEW YORK CITY 
CALLING IT HISTORIC.
SUMMONING IT UP.
THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING NEWS IN 
AMERICA THIS MORNING. 
>> DO STAY WITH US FOR "GOOD 
MORNING AMERICA" AND HAVE A 
GREAT DAY.
HEADQUARTERS AND SINGAPORE.
