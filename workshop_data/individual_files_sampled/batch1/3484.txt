I learned how to speak like them dress like them and they understood that I could be as ruthless as as they were so they trusted me only the fact that I was with the Drug Enforcement Administration I never described what I did to my friends I never wanted to worry my family especially my parents they had an idea of the dangerous work that I was doing but they really did not have a complete concept one day I would be dealing with traffickers in Brazil the next day I'd be dealing with other traffickers in Bolivia so I was jet-setting throughout Latin America and working you know really dangerous undercover assignments you lived with these individuals and they became part of your persona and it was difficult to shut it off but you know eventually I learned how to go back to a normal routine I was like a switch it was like a light switch I could turn it on and off you know as required
