1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,080
ON THE SEASON OPENER OF GAME OF
THRONES, BRITISH SINGER ED

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,890
SHEERAN HAD A CAMEO.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,740
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE SINGER,
LITTLE BIT DARK, IT IS THE WOODS

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,640
AFTER ALL, AND A FUN TRIVIA
FACT, THE WORLD THAT GAME OF

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,119
THRONES IS SET ON DOES NOT
ACTUALLY HAVE A MOON.

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,580
IF WE GO TO THE NEXT ONE, WHAT
TO SEE A PICTURE, THEN

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,669
LAUGHING ALONG.

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,560
HE HAD TWO LINES AFTER SINGING A
LITTLE BIT.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,150
IN FACT, BRETT IDENTIFIED HIM
BASED ON THE VOICE BEFORE HE

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,470
ACTUALLY SHOWED HIS FACE ON THE
SHOW, AND YOU MIGHT THINK,

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,040
THAT'S INTERESTING, LITTLE
CAMEO, THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,480
WITH SINGERS ñ NOT AS
HIGH-PROFILE NECESSARILY, BUT

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,710
THEY HAD SINGERS ON BEFORE.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,980
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT
HAVING IT, AND THERE WAS THIS

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,770
UPROAR ONLINE, THAT A CELEBRITY
WOULD DARE TO HAVE A CAMEO

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,130
APPEARANCE, LIKE ED SHEERAN.

17
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,360
IT IS BELIEVED TO BE RELATED TO
THAT THAT ED SHEERAN TOOK

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,030
HIMSELF OFF TWITTER.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,830
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY
THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,830
HAS HAPPENED.

21
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,300
A FEW MONTHS BACK HE SAID THIS:
"I'VE ACTUALLY COME OFF

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,300
TWITTER COMPLETELY.

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
I CAN'T READ IT.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,970
I GO ON IT AND IS NOTHING BUT
PEOPLE SAYING MEAN THINGS.

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,890
ONE COMMENT RUINED YOUR DAY, BUT
THAT'S WHY HAVE COME OFF IT."

26
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,890
HIS COMMENT ABOUT PEOPLE SAYING
MEAN THINGS, WE'VE LOOKED

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,740
INTO IT AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
TRUE.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,450
HE RECENTLY CAME BACK ON IT, HE
DOESN'T READ IT HE SAYS,

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,100
BUT HE DOES TWEET SIMILAR
HOWEVER, HIS ACCOUNT WENT

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,740
DOWN AFTER THE UPROAR OVER HIS
APPEARANCE.

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,490
I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO SAY.

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:35,030
NUMBER ONE, WHEN JOHN SAID THAT
BRETT CALLED IT WHEN WE

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,840
WERE WATCHING IT LIVE, I WAS
THINKING, DID WE ALL WATCH

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
IT LIVE?

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,700
ACTUALLY WE DO, AND YOU GUYS CAN
WATCH IT WITH US.

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,850
WE COVER IT ON WHAT THE FLICK?

37
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,729
YOU WATCH IT AT HOME, WE WATCH
IT HERE AND WE DO BASICALLY

38
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,280
PLAY-BY-PLAY, BUT WE TALKED VERY
LITTLE BECAUSE IT'S GAME OF

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,260
THRONES LET'S BE REAL.

40
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,549
BUT BRETT DID SAY WHILE WE WERE
WATCHING IT LIVE, IS THAT ED

41
00:01:58,549 --> 00:01:59,549
SHEERAN?

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,229
NO, I SAID, THAT'S ED SHEERAN.

43
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,560
IT WASN'T A QUESTION, THERE'S NO
QUESTION WHEN YOU HEAR THE

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,750
DULCET TONES OF THAT GINGER.

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:15,209
WE WANTED IN THE STUDIO, AND
THEN WE DO A REVIEW OF IT

46
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,879
IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER, SO GO TO
YOUTUBE.COM/WHATTHEFLICKSHOW, TO

47
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:22,430
CATCH ALL OF THOSE REVIEWS AS WE
ARE DOING IT LIVE, AND

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,719
AFTERWARDS YOU CAN SEE THE
REVIEW.

49
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,389
AND ONTO THIS, WHY ARE PEOPLE
UPSET ABOUT THIS?

50
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,389
I HAVE NO IDEA.

51
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,550
I LOVE GAME OF THRONES, WE HAVE
BEEN REVIEWING IT ALL THESE

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,260
YEARS, AND I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY.

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,930
PEOPLE LOVE ED SHEERAN, HE'S A
GREAT SINGER.

54
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,930
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE HATERS.

55
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,019
I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS HATERS
ONLINE, AS YOU'VE MENTIONED,

56
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,250
BUT I THINK IT WAS THE WAY IN
WHICH HIS CAMEO PLAYED OUT.

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,450
IT WAS THE LIKE...

58
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:59,189
FREEZE ON ED SHEERAN, AND THEN
FOR ME I WAS PICTURING ALL THE

59
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:02,709
TIMES THEY JUST DID LIKE, ALL
RIGHT ED, SAY YOUR LINE 5

60
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:04,389
TIMES, DIFFERENT WAYS.

61
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,109
HE HAD TWO LINES.

62
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:11,409
HE MAY AS WELL AS HAD A MARQUEE
WITH NEON LIGHTS GOING, ED

63
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,180
SHEERAN, TONIGHT ONLY!

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
REALLY?

65
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,580
YES, TO ME IT TAKES YOU
COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.

66
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,829
NOW, IT WAS A MOMENT, A
SHORT MOMENT, PEOPLE ARE

67
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,890
INTERACTING, AND HIS VOICE, WHEN
I HEAR IT, TAKES ME BACK TO

68
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,799
BEING A KID, I DON'T KNOW WHY.

69
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,029
I WAS LIKE, 30 WHEN HE BECAME
POPULAR.

70
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:38,120
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMOUS
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CAMEOS ON GAME

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,209
OF THRONES, BUT I HAVEN'T YET
SEEN IT IN A WAY THAT TAKES

72
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,900
YOU COMPLETELY OUT OF IT.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:53,439
WHEN I SAW IAN MCSHANE, WHEN HE
DID HIS CAMEO IT WAS LIKE, YES!

74
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,339
WELL HE'S AN ACTOR.

75
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:59,469
HE'S AN ACTOR FROM AN HBO SHOW,
I'M SO INTO IT, AND THEY DO THAT

76
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:01,870
ALL THE TIME, BUT WITH ED
SHEERAN IT WAS LIKE, HE WAS

77
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,529
THERE TO SING WELL, AND ACT
OKAY.

78
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:08,489
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE QUALIFIED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU

79
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:10,290
KNOW WHO ED SHEERAN IS.

80
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,939
I'M THE PERFECT TEST
CASE, BECAUSE ñ

81
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,358
I PREPPED FOR THIS, I STILL
BARELY KNOW WHO HE IS.

82
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,009
BUT GOING INTO THE EPISODE I HAD
NEVER HEARD OF THIS PERSON

83
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,010
BEFORE.

84
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,488
HE SEEMED LIKE A FINE SINGER.

85
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,389
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A
DIFFERENT GROUP BECAUSE OF

86
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,389
THE SINGING.

87
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:26,389
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

88
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,770
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO ED
SHEERAN IS?

89
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,960
I'M WORSE THAN HIM.

90
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,120
WHEN YOU SAID IT DURING THE
SHOW, I THOUGHT HE WAS A

91
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
COUNTRY SINGER.

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,889
HE VERY WELL COULD BE.

93
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,830
MY POINT IS, I DID NOT KNOW WHO
HE WAS, AND IF YOU HADN'T

94
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,139
SAID ANYTHING I WOULD NOT HAVE
THOUGHT THERE WAS ANYTHING

95
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,139
WEIRD.

96
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,840
HE WAS TO SOME GUY WHO SANG AND
HAD TWO LINES.

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,169
WE FOCUSED ON IT TOO MUCH, HE
LOOKED LIKE EVERY OTHER

98
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,940
PERSON SHOWS UP ON GAME OF
THRONES.

99
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,940
RACIST.

100
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

101
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,129
I DON'T KNOW.

102
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,080
LET'S GET INTO WHY YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THERE, BEFORE WE

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,289
RETURNED TO THE COMMENTARY.

104
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,400
HIS ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN AWAY, AND
THEN REPORTS CAME THAT HE

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,190
WAS BACK, BUT THEY DELETED ALL
OF HIS TWEETS, AND HE HAD

106
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,650
LESS THAN 200,000
FOLLOWERS ALL WE DOWN FROM 19

107
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,120
MILLION, WHICH MEANS I SHOULD
KNOW WHO HE WAS.

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,400
THAT DUDE HAD 19 MILLION
FOLLOWERS?

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,500
APPARENTLY.

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,400
HE'S DOWN TO LIKE 14

111
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,130
MILLION, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
BELIEVE ANYMORE.

112
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,830
BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY HE
SHOWED UP, AND IT'S NOT

113
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,830
JUST THAT HE'S FAMOUS.

114
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:34,100
ONE OF THE SHOW RUNNERS SAID
THIS, BUT WE KNEW THAT MAISIE

115
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,259
WILLIAMS WAS A BIG FAN, AND FOR
YEARS WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET

116
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:50,909
THEM ON THE SHOW, AND THIS YEAR
WE FINALLY DID IT.

117
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,120
SHE'S PROBABLY CRAZY FOR HIM,
IT'S A COOL LITTLE SURPRISE.

118
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,360
HE DID A GOOD JOB, GET OFF HIS
ASS.

119
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,949
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

120
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,069
THAT'S AN OLD REFERENCE.

121
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,650
I'M BEGINNING NOW TO SEE WHY.

122
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,830
I'M WITH JOHN, I DID NOT AS
ANYTHING DIFFERENT, BUT IF

123
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,419
IT WAS BEYONC…, IT MIGHT ñ YOU
I'M SAYING?

124
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,220
IF ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE HAVING
A SERIOUS GAME OF THRONES

125
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
MOMENT.

126
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,259
ARE YOU SAYING THAT ED SHEERAN
IS BEYONC…?

127
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,259
I'M SAYING HE'S NOT.

128
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,949
I'M SAYING IT WAS A REALLY
FAMOUS PERSON.

129
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,430
APPARENTLY HE'S REALLY FAMOUS.

130
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,430
RIGHT, AND A FIANC…

131
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,599
SHOWS UP IN
THE MIDDLE OF A GAME OF

132
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,380
THRONES AND PERSONAE MIGHT BE A
LITTLE DISTRACTED.

133
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,110
ANYWAY, THE MAIN THING I GOT OUT
OF THIS IS THAT ED SHEERAN

134
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,810
IS WAY TOO SENSITIVE.

135
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,860
IF YOU LIVED IN OUR WORLDS.

136
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,699
I AM ON TWITTER, IT IS MOSTLY
PEOPLE SAYING MEAN THINGS,

137
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,409
BECAUSE ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
BE MEAN, BUT THEY KNOW IF THEY

138
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,080
DO IT IN PERSON THEY'LL GET
PUNCHED IN THE FACE, SO

139
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
THEY DO IT ONLINE.

140
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,539
BY JOHN.

141
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,490
BY ME, OR ANYONE ELSE THAT THEY
WERE MEAN TO.

142
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,009
BUT FOR THE JOB, AND FOR
THINGS OTHER THAN POLITICS ñ

143
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,759
BUT I UNDERSTANDABLY WANT TO
LIKE, PROTECT THEIR SANITY

144
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,340
BY LEAVING IT.

145
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,419
HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON LEAVING
IT.

146
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,730
TICKETS OKAY, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED IN IT, YOU

147
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,259
HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO EXPOSE
YOURSELF TO THAT SORT OF

148
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,580
CONCENTRATED INSANITY.

149
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,009
HERE'S THE THING, ED SHEERAN
WILL DO A CAMEO ON THE

150
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,860
SIMPSONS, WHICH IS A SHOW FOR
CAMEOS.

151
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,659
I DON'T THINK THAT THE GAME OF
THRONES IS A SHOW FOR THAT

152
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,389
KIND OF, LIKE, I WAS JUST ON THE
SIMPSONS, AND DANCING WITH

153
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:36,190
THE STARS, NOW WHAT TO DO MY
CAMEO ON GAME OF THRONES.

154
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,870
IT WAS A STRANGE, ALTHOUGH HE IS
A SUPER TALENTED, EXTREMELY

155
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,039
ñ DESPITE WHAT THEY SAY,
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW ñ

156
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,789
EXTREMELY POPULAR SINGER,
NOMINATED FOR THE HIGHEST

157
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:48,080
AWARDS IN THE LAND OF MUSIC.

158
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,029
OKAY, ANYWAY, I PARDON EVERYONE
INVOLVED, AND ONE COMMENT

159
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:54,460
SHOULD NOT RUIN YOUR DAY.

160
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,300
IT WAS PROBABLY MORE.

161
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,509
I'M WORRIED THIS SETS A
PRECEDENT WHERE PEOPLE WILL

162
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:00,820
WANT TO DO THESE CAMEOS ANYMORE,
BECAUSE IF YOU DECIDED TO

163
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,840
SURPRISE ME WITH A CAMEO WERE
LIKE, EMMA WATSON HAD A

164
00:08:02,840 --> 00:00:00,000
COUPLE LINES ON TYT, I WOULD
WANT YOU TO DO THAT.
