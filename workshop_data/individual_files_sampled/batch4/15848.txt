give me your take on what happened in Texas you know as these are the events that keep the incidents that keep law enforcement the intelligence community awake at night a very low-tech asymmetrical attack with one actor with motivations that are unknown although I suspect ap ISM had a lot to do with it he had a violent criminal history we know he was convicted in a military court of beating his wife and child back in 2014 and and essentially the facts are that there's something snapped inside of this guy Devin Kelley he walked into this church with an ar-15 rifle and started shooting at worshippers I mean think about it when you walk in the door of a church on a Sunday morning their backs are turned to you so what an act of cowardice now the neighbor a plumber local guy is a tiny town it's like a one stop sign town four hundred five hundred residents when he left the church when the shooter left the church his neighbor engaged him in gunfire struck him then this neighbor and another neighbor got into a vehicle and had a 95 mile an hour car chase the suspect then rolled his car into a ditch and they found him dead in the vehicle it looks like the good samaritan with the legal gun delivered the fatal shot stop this massacre and he'd not been armed who knows how many people would have been killed yeah and and that's the thing is you cannot stop acts of violence especially if they're random and it and I'm going to guess that unlike for example jihadist terrorists I'm going to guess this truly was a lone wolf I would be very surprised if he conferred or collaborated with anyone just based on what he looks like and it sounds like there is no way to stop the randomness in a country of 300 million plus people even a totalitarian state cannot stop random acts it's whether or not you allow people to protect themselves or if people have to wait for like if you say this is a one stop sign town maybe the local police officer is half an hour away maybe he's hours away if you have to rely on an official policeman to save your church there's going to be a lot more casualties that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
