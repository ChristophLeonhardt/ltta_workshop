1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,702
“I really disagreed with him.
I was not his fan.

2
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:05,038
But I'll tell you what:
What he did,

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,906
he brought back 
his reputation.”

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:09,275
In October, Donald Trump had
good things to say

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:11,378
about both James Comey
and his decision

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,579
to reopen his investigation

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,280
into Hillary Clinton's emails.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,051
“And it took guts for Director
Comey

9
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,387
to make the move that he made.”

10
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,554
Attorney General Jeff Sessions

11
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,590
also applauded the F.B.I.
director.

12
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,326
“You know, F.B.I. Director Comey
did the right thing.

13
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,094
When he found new evidence,

14
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,496
he had no choice

15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,731
but to report to the American
Congress ...”

16
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,433
But that was then.

17
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,069
Now, one of the reasons why
Trump fired Comey

18
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,772
was over his handling of this
very same incident.

19
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,073
“Why now?”

20
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,441
When it comes to Comey,

21
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,276
Democrats have also done an
about face

22
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:44,177
on their feelings.

23
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,779
They were very critical of his
decision,

24
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,313
just days before the election,

25
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,149
to reopen the Clinton case.

26
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,484
“I think he made a mistake
on this.

27
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,887
And he clearly has a
double standard.”

28
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,789
“And I think it would not be a
bad thing

29
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:56,956
for the American people

30
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,391
if he did step down.” 

31
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,026
Now, some of those same people

32
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,795
are calling Trump's decision
to fire Comey

33
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:02,896
highly unfortunate.

34
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,798
“The dismissal of Director Comey

35
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,134
establishes a very troubling
pattern.”

36
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,036
Nancy Pelosi compared Comey’s
dismissal

37
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,806
to “some of the worst Executive
Branch abuses.”

38
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,108
Bernie Sanders said it raised
“serious questions”

39
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,342
about what Trump is hiding.

40
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,778
The irony of the Democrats'
shifting relationship

41
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,047
to James Comey was not lost
on Donald Trump.

42
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,315
Trump himself tweeted

43
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,184
that “Democrats have said some
of the worst things

44
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,985
about James Comey, including
the fact

45
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,253
that he should be fired,

46
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,155
but now they play so sad.”

47
00:01:29,489 --> 00:00:00,000
The irony of his own shifts
was another story.
