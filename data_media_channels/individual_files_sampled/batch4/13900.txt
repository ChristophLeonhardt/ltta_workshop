so ariana grande Grande grande grande grande anyway the one who licked the donut you know the donut looking one she's out with a new video and song called God is a woman and it has caused waves in the culture pop culture's is is a frenzy right now because is because of God as a woman and it has the media like the LA Times proclaimed that grande has officially smashed the patriarchy with her music video for God is a woman which just a quick side note there we are continuously told that this in that thing or person has smashed the patriarchy but then feminists continue to complain about the patriarchy so I thought it had been smashed I mean once you smash something it's gone right so like I guess that means you haven't really been smashing it I mean if you actually smashed it then you have to stop complaining about it but if you're still complaining about it then you can't claim that you're smashing it because clearly it's if the patriarchy is still intact and can be smashed it means that it was not smashed in the past that's just a quick just a quick note there technicality alright just a logistical point but and there are other Mashable says that it's the empowering female anthem the world needs the Guardian wrote a lengthy article dissecting the theological aspects of Grande's song and there's been a lot of coverage like that of course the only problem with dissecting the theological aspects of the song is that there aren't any theological aspects of the song the video consists of the singer writhing about in various states of undress which is you know what most pop female pop videos consist of these days and you know she's gyrating on various different objects including on the globe itself at one point and the video is peppered with it is peppered with a random hodgepodge of blasphemous imageries and and things like that at one point Madonna comes on and quotes Scripture okay so just there's a random blasphemy going on along with ariana grande naked prancing about so the song itself like 98.7 percent of all pop music is just nonsensical garbage and makes you manifestly stupider just by encountering like I will just so just so we're on the same page okay I and kind of as a science experiment I will read some of the lyrics to you and I want you to be now pay attention as I read this because you're going to feel your own IQ plummeting to the earth your IQ will will lower by 13 to 15 points just when I read a couple of lyrics from this so you're gonna feel it you're gonna feel yourself you're gonna say to yourself wow I'm getting Dumber right now I could I am I am more and by the end of it you will be dumber than you were heading into it so and this is just as I said just a science experiment so the lyrics of the song and maybe you can maybe I'm wrong maybe there is some deep theological significance here maybe she's making some argument for the womanhood of God that I that I just am too stupid myself to pick up on but here's what the the lyrics say you love it how I move you you love it how I touch you my one when all is said and done you'll believe God is a woman and I feel it after midnight a feeling that you can't fight my one it lingers when we're done you'll believe if God is a woman I don't want to waste no time yeah you ain't got a one-track mind yeah have it any way you like yeah and I can tell that you know I know how I wanted ain't nobody else can relate boy I like that you ain't afraid baby lay me down and let's pray I'm telling you the way I like it how I want it but why does she I thought he or she said that he knows he knows how she wants it and then now she's saying that she's gonna tell him how she wants it so I'm trying to understand that so it seems a little bit redundant but anyway I could continue but your brain would actually liquefy and leak out of your nose if I did so I won't do that and this is why there there are several people emailed me and they said they asked me like Matt can you can you do a podcast talking about why god he's into a woman you know can you can we can we talk can you engage with the point that ariana grande is making and get into a theological debate with her pop song and I'm not gonna do that because as you could tell from that she's not if this is it's just it's again it's just nonsensical she and she's not even really saying that God is a woman she's saying that God is a woman because she is God and the reason why she is God is that she can sexually satisfy her partner she can sexually satisfy a man in bed so that means that she is God that's what she's saying that's the theological argument that she's making and I I mean I do disagree with it I don't think the ability to sexually satisfy someone makes you a God personally that's just my my own reading of Scripture is that that's not accurate as far now if I were to actually engage this idea of you know it's got a woman it's God is not a woman neither is God a man God is not a male or female God is not a created being okay God is it is a being that transcends all of that okay so we can't put them into the labels in the box boxes that we belong to however so it's not so God from from the way that we think of it like our understanding of man and woman God is neither he's above beyond transcending however it is important that we refer to God as he for two reasons the first reason is that if we're you know if we're not gonna refer to God as he and we're not going to refer to God as she because that would certainly be inaccurate then we're left with something kind of impersonal we'd have to refer to God as it or they or something like that but there's a reason why Scripture uses a a personal pronoun because he is a personal God and that's a point that has to be driven home and you start when you start using these kinds of vague when you start when you start using vague language to refer to God then you begin to think of God as this kind of impersonal almost this pantheistic kind of cosmic force that's just sort of floating out there detached from reality and that is the kind of God that some religions believe in it that is not the judeo-christian God and it's not the true God the true God is a personal God so we have to use personal language and referring to God why do we call him heat well I think it's very simple because that's mean that Jesus tells us to call god father so you can argue with that if you want you can tell Jesus he's wrong about the nature of God if that's an argument you want to get into with Jesus be my guest I wouldn't recommend it but I'm not gonna get into that argument it for me it's it's it's it's as simple as Jesus told us God is father call him father in what sense is he father in what sense can you use this this obviously masculine label and attach it to God I don't know I I mean I don't know exactly I far as the exact nature of God I understand very little I have just like this little tiny symbol of understanding in my head and all I can ever hope to do is just fill that thimble so even if I even if I reach my max capacity for understanding God I will still have just a little thimble and as it happens right now I have only a little bit of that thimble filled so my point is I don't I don't know exactly but this is what Jesus Christ God incarnate this is what he told us so we know that God is personal and we are to refer to him and see him as father he but let's put all that to the side because really I don't want to talk about that I wanted to talk about just kind of pop music in general and especially this idea that stuff like this can it somehow empower us and especially empower women so few point Birk first of all the problem with this kind of stuff I mean this kind of pop music is that it harms you both mentally and spiritually it harms your mind and your soul it's it's it's it's not a neutral I know I was kind of kidding around about how your IQ drops listening to it but I was it I was only half kidding I think it really does harm us it's not a it's not a neutral experience your mind is harmed because this is nonsensical obnoxious utterly stupid and so in order to enjoy it and when I say stupid I don't mean it as this it's not a playground insult where I'm just oh that's stupid I mean it's really stupid it is just stupid I mean I read it to you that is stupid there's AI there's really no other word that would better capture there's no adjective that would better capture it then stupid and I would use the term stupid before I would use a term like offensive now when you when you've got these pop stars they start getting into the blasphemy and everything they want you to be offended what they're going for is offensive but it's not nearly smart enough to be offensive ariana grande just doesn't have the intellectual wit to be offensive she can't offend me it's just really really stupid so in order to a jet to it to enjoy it you have to kind of wilfully kill off the parts of your brain that demand actual substance and actual coherence now I would say that smart people don't listen to this stuff but that's not quite right because there is something in it and I don't mean just this song in particular I mean there's something in pop music in general there's something in it that that plays to the lowest common denominator in all of us something that that everybody finds weirdly almost incomprehensible appealing to some extent I don't find this song appealing at all but everybody has even when it comes to stupid pop songs everyone has certain stupid pop songs that you hear that and you're like this is stupid I don't like it but I also there's something about it that I do like I can't quite understand it and it has to do with the repetition and the melody the beat the way I think also the way the lyrics of these songs almost always feed into the ego of the listener and I think all of this could entice even potentially smart people to listen to it but if smart people do listen and they keep listening and they get enmeshed in this pop culture world then they will become less smart in the process they may remain smart but not as smart and they will be smart in spite of all this crap they're listening to not because of it because your mind atrophies after a while and I know people like to say well sometimes you got to turn your brain off and just enjoy and what they mean is is that they're they're talking about something the talk the song the show the movie whatever they're talking about when they say well you gotta you know you just got to turn your brain up what they're saying is that this thing is so completely devoid of intellectual substance that you would be bored by it unless you made the effort to put your brain into kind of hibernation mode again it's not this this so much in pop culture the show is the song so much of it is just incredibly stupid and it's not that if you encounter it you'll be offended it's more like if you keep your brain on you'll be bored by it you just it's boring because with your brain still on yeah you might it is possible to be entertained with your brain on so that your mind is also being engaged in some way and that's a much deeper more fulfilling more enjoyable more entertaining form of entertainment but if you keep your brain on and you try to engage with ariana grande or Beyonce or whoever you're just going to be bored to death so you've got to make this effort to turn it off and yeah maybe every once in a while it doesn't hurt to do that maybe every once in a while it doesn't hurt to turn your brain off and really enjoy something completely stupid okay maybe that doesn't although it never really helps but maybe it doesn't hurt but the problem is that most people are indulging in this turn off your brain entertainment every day for hours at a time they turn their brain off and they never turn it back on they say oh sometimes you got to turn your brain off and the only response to that is sometimes what do you mean sometimes what this is what you're always though you never you never have your brain on everything you every form of entertainment that you enjoy is it requires you to turn your brain off so and you're always being entertained by something so when exactly are you turning it back on and it's not like the person who's always turning their brain off for ariana grande in company and for whatever reality shows and the bachelor or whatever else it's not like they're balancing that with Shakespeare and documentaries about military history you know it's intellectually substantive but that's not what's happening they're just their whole life revolves around the turn your brain off stuff and I think after a while you get to the point where you don't know how to turn it back on and you don't really want to so your mind just kinds kind of Withers after a while in the same way that your legs will wither if you just lay around on the couch all the time so the mind is hurting it and then the soul is also hurt I think because art can be a very very uplifting experience and it can be edifying and it can be enlightening and I'm not just talking about religious art I mean any any art any art that is rooted in something true and that brings you closer to truth any art that illuminates him in some way and I think all arts should do that even non-religious mean all art should have that effect I've said in the past that that all art should bring us closer to God and people always object to that because they think that I'm saying that all art should be religious but that's not what I'm saying at all in fact I would actually quite prefer it if Christian artists like Christian musicians Christian actors and so on would make less Christian entertainment quote Christian entertainment and and make more entertainment that is consistent with their faith but is not explicitly evangelical so I'm actually not a fan of this thing we do now where you've got art you know got like regular secular arts which is rooted in nihilism and just stupidity and materialism and then you've got Christian art Christian movies Christian music Christian TM trademark you know what I would like to see I think will be great is that you take some of those Christians from over here from this category and you bring them over into secular entertainment and you have them make secular entertainment that is still consistent with and rooted in their a Christian worldview that's the way pretty much all art used to be in the West up until like the mid 20th century it's not that all art was religious it was that all art told stories of love and redemption and suffering and forgiveness and justice and virtue and sin so even if it wasn't preaching it was still rooted in a philosophical understanding of these things and it would increase your own understanding to listen to or watch or or read whatever art form but most art today has no connection to anything real and instead it exists for its own sake and exists only to distract it exists to appeal to the basest parts of us and I think that that certainly does hurt our souls as well as our brains second point and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this I just and I'm I admit I'm not a woman myself so maybe I'm going to engage in a little bit of mansplaining here but when I hear people say that stupid pop music is empowering to women or when someone says that the song the lyrics to which I just read to you when someone says those lyrics and a video of a woman naked prancing around empowers women I could only think that that is in credit for but it's incredibly demeaning and insulting to women because the women that I know the women in my life okay the women in my family my own wife so there's women that I that I know personally that if you told them that that you know if you said to them hey I found this really empowering thing for women why don't you come watch it and then you put on the Ariana Grande video for them the first thing they would probably do is laugh at you because they would think you were joking and then when they realized that you weren't joking they would be I would think probably insulted it's like what do you think of me that you think I'm empowered by this idiocy are you kidding me turn this garbage off so the women that I know that's that's how they would react to that claim and I think that's probably the case for most women you know so this it's it this is always the case with modern feminism that while it claims to be defending women and representing women all it does is demean and bring them down to this level where most women have no interest in beat so I think there are a lot of I think I think substantive intelligent women like the women in my life like hopefully any women watching this like most of the women in the country there's a lot of places they can look just like men there are a lot of places we can look for empowerment but they're not going to look to pop music any more than I think an intelligent and substantive man will look at the pop music or to rap or something for empower and a third point I want to make this is the last point there's this really dumb thing that people do where they dismiss concerns about modern pop music on the basis that people had similar concerns 50 years ago and I'm sure there are people saying this even now right now is they the people even as I'm as I'm discussing this there are people thinking this in their head I'm sure where people will say oh please you know adults in the 50s were complaining about Elvis and those concerns were obviously unwarranted so what's the big deal it's just pop music every time I hear that I think well yeah you're right I mean adults were complaining about Elvis in the 50s you're saying that their concerns were unwarranted but were they it seems to meet now now most people in the 50s or in the 60s or whatever when if they were complaining about Elvis or the Beatles they weren't literally claiming that the world was actually going to end because Elvis was shaking his hips around I don't think anyone was saying I don't think anyone was saying that the world that all human that all life on Earth will be annihilated because of the shape the hip shaking of the the pelvic thrusting of Elvis or whatever nobody was saying I think instead what what what perceptive people were saying in the 50s and 60s as pop music was coming into its own they were noticing that this stuff is having a Courson corseting and stupefying effect on our culture and so what they were worried is that art would increasingly be debased and would be increasingly disconnected from beauty and truth and God and virtue and you know in all of that and instead it would become this course of vulgar ridiculous stupid thing that exists only to distract and for no other reason I think that's what people were worried about in the 50s when they were looking at Elvis and you're saying they were wrong about that no no III think clearly they were right I think it's quite obvious that their concerns were 100% warranted and what they warned would happen actually did happen and is happening now so yes complaints about pop music have been around since pop music has been around but my point is those complaints have all been justified they've all been proven true I mean what are you talking about that have you noticed what's happening in the culture now I'm not saying we can look at our cultural state now I'm not saying that it's the fault of pop music but pop music has not helped pop music has contributed to it pop music has been both a symptom of our cultural decline and a vehicle for it and I think that is very clear when you just look around you just open your eyes we live in a culture today that is that is just dumb in need of constant stimulation there are great many people in this country who have no desire for any kind of intellectual engagement so they're they they have this constant need to be entertained and the kind of entertainment they look to is and it just gets dumber and dumber by the day and I would submit that that's a process that really began in earnest in the mid 20th century and so all the people who were pointing that out and kind of wringing their hands about it in the mid point they were right we probably should have listened to them all this so-called classic pop music of the Beatles and Elvis I mean all that stuff is just garbage I mean it's done nothing good for society whatsoever society would be would have been better off if none of that ever existed and I know that's supposed to be some kind of like harrassing now they say Oh what do you mean Elvis well all of us is a classic because he was I mean how could you say no I mean the music is just kind of garbage it's like what what is what's it trying to say what's it doing what's the point of it what was the point of most of what the Beatles were churning out I mean both it's just I submit that if we could turn back the clock to the 40s and 50s and just go off on a completely different path and all the pop music just didn't never came about I think we'd be in a better spot to it I'm not saying that we'd be in a utopian spot I don't even know how I don't know how I don't know to what degree we'd be in a better spot because there are so many other problems as well but but I think we'd be in a better spot I I don't think the world was made better by any of this stuff first so once again it would seem to be the case that the prophetic voices in the early and mid 20th century who were warning about this and that we probably should have listened to them but the world did listen to them just like they're not listening to those voices today that's just the story as it goes anyway thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
