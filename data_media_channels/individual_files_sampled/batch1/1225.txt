these moves are not new to John he's been taught how to carry them out for the past two years since he was 15 he didn't learn the drills willingly John's one of at least 700 children forcibly recruited by the South Sudan's national liberation movement if tech is in that we want to work there not accept if they fund you do that take you again by force the civil war in South Sudan now into its fifth year has killed thousands and displaced millions many vulnerable kids were recruited by armed groups to fight both boys and girls such as thirteen-year-old Sarah right groups they nearly all armed groups recruited children to fight the South Sudan's national liberation movement has recently released more than three hundred children they were not really first but their condition band then fostered them and all over together to stay so in fact we did not attend papazilla so that they may be recruited is their army to fight that's why you see we have you decided also as we are now in towns after the peace so we have decided to release them so that they can go to school or join their communities nearly two thousand children have been demobilized in the past five years but they are being replaced according to UNICEF the number of child soldiers in the armed groups and armed forces has been on the rise since the war in December 2015 that despite all warring sides agreeing to stop recruiting child soldiers and releasing those already enlisted but even for those who have been demobilized life is a challenge many children who've been released have no idea where their families are for others fighting has become a way of life the biggest challenge is reintegration it's a process that takes time two to three years for that child to go back home and resettle we still have more kids to be released so access big thing there we need more kids to be released our real concern is the reintegration of these children so that then they don't get recruited again John and Sarah say they don't want to return to the battlefield but they also fear what lies ahead after their past experiences and wonder if they may be forced to fight again Hiba morgan al jazeera lambu south sudan
