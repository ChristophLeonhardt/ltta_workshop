Europe is having a ton of trouble with its Turkish immigrants in the old days of course Europeans used to do battle with the Turks because the Turks were trying to conquer Western civilization nowadays Europeans actually invite Turks to sweep into their countries and droves because things have changed the Turks are still trying to conquer Western civilization but Europeans are now weakened stupid the latest troubles began when Turkey tried to get Turks in Europe to support a Turkish referendum that would give dictatorial powers to Turkey's president Recep air Dogen pronounced air Doan because the G is silent as in angst ER until recently Turkey had been slowly modernizing because of the secularizing reforms instituted last century by Mustafa Kemal Kemal is usually known as Ataturk because of all the people shouting Ataturk he instituted secularizing reforms unfortunately these reforms have been gradually eroded by President Erdogan pronounced heir to one because the G is silent as in Wiz how come you're eroding all those great reforms the Turks tried to gin up support for the president's most recent power grab by staging rallies in European countries but the Europeans shut down the rallies because they were afraid there would lead to riots and threats of holy war to prove these concerns were unfounded the Turks rioted and threatened holy war the Europeans put down the riots which angered president air Dogen which is pronounced air21 because the G is silent as in hottest the Turkish president accused the Europeans of being Nazis which the Europeans generally don't like because some of them actually used to be Nazis but are now pretty nice what's more Turkish hackers spread the Nazi accusation by hacking them into very important Twitter accounts like those of Justin Bieber Amnesty International Forbes magazine and myself which made me feel like a very important person who was accusing the Europeans of being Nazis even though they're now pretty nice geared velders a hard-line anti-islamist with amazingly gigantic hair hoped that he would ride the Turkish troubles to election as the Dutch prime minister builders had promised to D Islamize the Netherlands but his election bid was rejected because the Dutch apparently preferred to Islamize and also the big hair was considered a negative all the same the Europeans do finally seem to be debating whether letting Islamists weep over their country's rape their women kill their men and destroy their culture is really as good an idea as it sounded when they first thought of it on the one hand the EU recently enacted a ban on head scarves in the workplace feeling Muslim women should be treated fairly at work before returning home to be chattel again on the other hand Germany's Angela Merkel recently bowed to air to ones request that a German comedian be prosecuted for insulting the Turkish president personally I'd have told air Dewan to add stuffed the G is silent trigger warning I'm

that's why so many people died over the Clavin last weekend this was the National Review ideas summit were all these important people and me were the hairy no I walked on as I walked on stage Tom Price the new health and what's that health mister secretary was walking off and as I walked off Paul Ryan was walking on and I thought like what was I doing there I don't know anything but it was really good I like to I like to go there it reminded me it made me think back on another I go to these National Review things and I was on one of their cruises and I was on a panel on the cruise and John Miller a pal of mine was now a professor at Hillsdale said ask the panel in general what did we think how do we think history would record Barack Obama and everybody had a kind of elaborate thing what history would say about Barack Obama and I said I thought that Barack Obama would get one sentence in history for a while that he was the first black president and then after that became unimportant he would have no place in history whatsoever I mean he would be like Millard Fillmore or like you know Martin Van Buren or something like this I now believe that to be that I got that exactly right now of course I always get these things exactly right for those of you who are leaving comments saying that I'm wrong you know it'll save you so much groveling later on if you don't don't say that's that because I but I really do think Obama is already he's like a kind of vague memory like I can barely remember what's going on and it makes me realize that these eight years of Obama were like a dream they were like a dream that the left was having out loud of this salvific black president who was going to lift us all and everything was gonna be different now we were gonna be let's give him the Nobel Peace Prize because now give him the Nobel Peace Prize before he does anything because now everything will be peace and in fact it's been the law it was the longest period of war under any president ever the fewest number of ledges of any president ever now everything he's doing is being erased one way or another by Donald Trump the his party has been destroyed and I just don't think he's gonna make left left much of a mark I accept on the minds of these people who imagined it and so now we have Donald Trump and you know there's this old saying nobody knows exactly who said it that the news is the rough first draft of history but really now the news is an alternative history it's like reading science fiction it's like the reading a war so here's we're entering this big week this is a big week for the Trump administration Neil Gorsuch Supreme Court guy his hearings begin the health care law is supposed to come up for a vote as early as Thursday it has one more committee to get through and that that comes up for vote now there are all these investigations these are going on as I speak so stuff is probably happening as I speak that I'm not watching but the Intel investigations into Russia you know on Russia influence on the election and Trump's accusations that Obama wiretapped him and all this stuff so here's a piece from The Wall Street Journal this morning I'm just gonna read like a little bit of it that is giving it gives the general impression that the press is giving us about this administration since President Donald Trump's election equity and bond markets have been on the rise business leaders are applauding his call for tax cuts and consumer confidence in the US economy is up it's actually way up but halfway through his crucial but here's the bottom half way through his crucial first hundred days in office it has been tough going for the new president's agenda that inspired much of that optimism so people are optimistic but the agenda is in trouble Republican infighting is bogging down a health care bill and the litany of legislative issues lined up behind it including an overhaul of the tax code a series of court rulings are stalling his immigration policy changes and his own tweets and White House comments are broadening several Pro into whether Russia tried to influence the outcome of last year's presidential election on behalf of the Trump campaign so let's take a look at this for a minute the one part that I immediately agreed with to some degree is that a series of court rulings stalled his immigration executive orders not necessarily his immigration policy changes because one of the things about those executive orders is they're kind of irrelevant but he doesn't need to do that stuff there's so much he can do by just calling up ice and saying enforce the law that would change everything but it is true that these judges who have struck down this latest executive order have betrayed their trust and I mean it's getting on the right people get a little bit what's the word hyperbolic maybe they you know the people shouting it's a coup it's a left-wing judicial coup it's a couple of bad decisions by a couple of dishonest judges you know they may be not corrupt but they're ideologically corrupt and that stuff tends to rebound it tends to blow up in your face so I'm not really as concerned about that I think that's gonna make these judges I don't look bad and it may even end with the Ninth Circuit being disbanded or rearranged in some way so you know I'm not that worried about this but let's let's talk about the for instance well first since it's happening now let's talk about these hearings okay the hearings about Russia it seems pretty clear now that there that there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia they keep saying Russia hack the elections so far all that boils down to is Russia fishing John Podesta and releasing some emails and all this stuff so that that is just now a lot of you know kind of slander just people saying this stuff about Russia so that's gonna kind of disappear I think over time it just if they had anything we wouldn't know it by now it would be a big scandal this is a lot of journalists making a lot of noise about something that does not seem to have actually happened I mean I do not believe first of all I don't believe the Putin could have possibly known that Trump was gonna win no one knew the Trump was gonna win he was looking for information against the person he thought was going to be the president he was looking to discredit Hillary Clinton because he thought she was going to be the president now there is this stuff about the Trump tweets that Obama bugged him okay and so today here's the latest thing we have is James Comey being questioned by Adam Schiff a partisan Republican Democrat on the Intel committee and Schiff is asking him about these allegations that Obama bugged Trump in here's Comey director Comey I want to begin by attempting to put to rest serve the claims made by the president about his predecessor namely that President Obama wire tapped his phones so that we can be precise I wanna refer you to exactly what the president said and ask you whether there was any truth to it first the president claimed quote terrible just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory nothing found this is McCarthyism unquote director Comey was the president's statement that Obama had his wires tapped in Trump Tower a true statement with respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI the Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the department justice and all its components the department has no information that supports those tweets so this is no big surprise right we knew we had already said in the Republican on the Intel committee Devin Nunez he also said the same thing but here's what I think obviously did happen and I say obviously I'm putting this together a little bit but it seems to me that that the narrative is pretty clear that what did happen is there were legal taps on foreign actors like the Russian ambassador that some of these actors as these people do you know there's nothing illegal or wrong about it some of them talk to people in the Trump campaign I think Obama decided that he was going to create this narrative maybe he believed the narrative I don't I don't know he picked this stuff out he Jerry picked the stuff where legally tapped Russians spoke legally to you know people in the Trump campaign he then changed the rules of who had this information just before he left office so that was spread around and someone along somewhere along the line the names were unmasked you're supposed to mask any American who gets swept up in these intelligence it bugs you know you're supposed to not release who the guy was talking to because he's an American citizen you have to get a warrant to tap his phone right so you supposed but obviously with Michael Flynn and possibly with others that didn't happen and that's where the criminal scandal really lies because essentially okay you know to say he tapped the phones it's not true and Trump is a loudmouth and he talked he's a loose talker and he talks the way people talk when they're in bars rather than the way you talk when you're in the Oval Office and that's one of the problems with his tweets it's his own fault he's distracting from his agenda it is true he is but I do not think it's criminal on Trump's part I have to stop and say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we have the Great and Powerful Michael Knowles we only we only get here by you know we have to pay him now to come on we haven't started paying Knowles oh oh thank god all right coming on come over the Daily wire calm you can hear the rest of the show or you could subscribe and you could watch it right on the site straight through
