1
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:02,699
WE WILL PROVE TONIGHT WHY SHE IS

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:03,533
ACTUALLY AN AMERICAN HERO.

3
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:06,169
WE HAVE ALL OF THIS TONIGHT AND

4
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,506
TONIGHT'S OPENING NEWS

5
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:11,374
MONOLOGUE.

6
00:00:11,374 --> 00:00:14,177
ALL RIGHT, THEY HAVE BEEN PUT ON

7
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,445
NOTICE, AMERICA WILL NO LONGER

8
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:17,214
BE BOWING DOWN TO THEIR

9
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:17,748
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS.

10
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:20,917
THE DAYS OF BLINDLY TRUSTING AND

11
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:21,585
TRYING TO BRIBE THIS ROGUE

12
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:24,521
REGIME ARE NOW OVER.

13
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:25,822
HOURS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE

14
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,958
OF THE COURAGEOUS TO PULL THE

15
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:32,595
UNITED STATES OUT OF THIS VERY

16
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:33,163
FLAWED IRANIAN NUCLEAR

17
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:33,530
AGREEMENT.

18
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,131
LET'S TAKE A LOOK HERE.

19
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:38,635
>> THE IRANIAN REGIME IS THE

20
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:41,271
THE DEAL ALLOWED I RAN IT TO

21
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:44,808
CONTINUE ENRICHING URANIUM AND

22
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,810
OVERTIME, REACH THE BRINK OF A

23
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,979
NUCLEAR BREAKOUT.

24
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:53,917
THIS DISASTROUS DEAL GAVE THIS

25
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,651
REGIME -- AND IT'S A REGIME OF

26
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:57,420
GREAT TERROR.

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,290
MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

28
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,392
SOME OF IT IN ACTUAL CASH.

29
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:05,595
TODAY, WE HAVE DEFINITIVE PROOF

30
00:01:05,595 --> 00:01:07,230
THAT THIS IRANIAN PROMISE WAS

31
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,198
ALL A LIE.

32
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,300
THEREFORE, I AM ANNOUNCING TODAY

33
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,738
THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL

34
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:15,372
WITHDRAW FROM THE IRAN AT

35
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,774
NUCLEAR DEAL.

36
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:19,776
>> Sean: THANK GOD.

37
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:21,378
NOW, NATURALLY, THE IRANIAN

38
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:22,546
PRESIDENT, HE RESPONDED WITH THE

39
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:24,514
THROAT SAYING THAT HIS ROGUE

40
00:01:24,514 --> 00:01:25,515
REGIME, THEY ARE READY TO START

41
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:29,519
ENRICHING AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF

42
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,120
URANIUM IF THE SECONDARY

43
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,754
NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT YIELD

44
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:34,558
POSITIVE RESULTS.

45
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:35,292
NOW, THIS EXPRESSION MAY HAVE

46
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,626
WORKED WITH OBAMA, BUT NOT

47
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:36,960
ANYMORE.

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,597
THIS IS A NEW AGE OF DIPLOMACY,

49
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:41,665
BASED ON THE CONCEPT THAT REAGAN

50
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:42,032
TAUGHT US.

51
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,533
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

52
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,968
IT WORKS.

53
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:45,368
WATCH THIS.

54
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:48,038
>> AS WE EXIT TO THE IRAN DEAL,

55
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:50,106
WE WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR

56
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:52,108
ALLIES TO FIND OUR REAL

57
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:56,146
COMPREHENSIVE AND LASTING

58
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,114
SOLUTION TO THE IRANIAN NUCLEAR

59
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:59,115
THREAT.

60
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:00,450
IN THE MEANTIME, POWERFUL

61
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,452
SANCTIONS WILL GO INTO FULL

62
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:04,721
EFFECT.

63
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,388
IF THE REGIME CONTINUES ITS

64
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,624
NUCLEAR ASPIRATIONS, IT WILL

65
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:10,526
HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN IT HAS

66
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,163
EVER HAD BEFORE.

67
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:15,966
>> Sean: IT NOW, OF COURSE, IF

68
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:19,903
IRAN IS SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING THE

69
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:20,804
IMMEDIATELY HALTING THEIR EFFORS

70
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:23,707
TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES,

71
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,308
THERE WOULD STILL BE TIME TO

72
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:25,675
NEGOTIATE.

73
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,844
MOST U.S. SANCTIONS WILL NOT BE

74
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:29,713
REINSTATED FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS.

75
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:31,248
OIL RELATED SANCTIONS WILL TAKE

76
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:31,915
180 DAYS TO COME ONLINE.

77
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:34,918
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR.

78
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:35,652
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING AND

79
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:38,188
READY TO NEGOTIATE, JUST LIKE HE

80
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:38,855
IS WITH LITTLE ROCKET MAN.

81
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:41,324
TAKE A LOOK.

82
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:42,058
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THEY ARE

83
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,794
GOING TO WANT TO MAKE A NEW AND

84
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,931
LASTING DEAL.

85
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:48,965
ONE THAT BENEFITS ALL OF IRAN

86
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,700
AND THE IRANIAN PEOPLE.

87
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,837
WHEN THEY DO, I AM READY,

88
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:56,740
WILLING, AND ABLE.

89
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,075
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR IRAN

90
00:02:59,075 --> 00:02:59,542
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR IRA

91
00:02:59,542 --> 00:02:59,843
IRAN.

92
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,212
AND GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN FOR

93
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:04,948
THE PEACE AND STABILITY THAT WE

94
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:07,517
ALL WANT IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

95
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,519
TO BE ONE ALL RIGHT, IT IS

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,153
REALLY SIMPLE.

97
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:11,788
IF IRAN WANTS HIS PEOPLE TO

98
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:12,489
PROSPER WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF

99
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,724
U.S. SANCTIONS, THEY JUST HAVE

100
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,559
TO COME TO THE TABLE.

101
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,928
NOW, THE LEADERS OF IRAN, THEY

102
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:20,430
ARE CORRUPT, THEY ARE IMMORAL,

103
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,064
THEY ARE RADICAL.

104
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:24,534
THIS IS A ROGUE THEOCRACY, AND

105
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,202
THEIR SUFFERING PEOPLE KNEW

106
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,337
HERE IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

107
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:28,305
TO SAY ABOUT THAT VERY SUBJECT

108
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,140
ALSO EARLIER TODAY IN THIS

109
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,409
HISTORIC SPEECH.

110
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,844
>> I WANT TO DELIVER A MESSAGE

111
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:37,580
TO THE SUFFERING PEOPLE OF IRAN.

112
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,616
THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA STAND WITH

113
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,117
YOU.

114
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,886
IT HAS NOW BEEN ALMOST 40 YEARS

115
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,622
SINCE THIS DICTATORSHIP SEIZED

116
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:48,892
POWER AND TOOK A PROUD NATION

117
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:49,926
HOSTAGE.

118
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:50,593
MOST OF IRAN'S 80 MILLION

119
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:55,832
CITIZENS HAS SADLY NEVER KNOWN

120
00:03:55,832 --> 00:04:00,403
AND IRAN THAT PROSPERED WITH ITS

121
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:06,609
NEIGHBORS AND DEMANDED THE --

122
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,944
JOHN CAREY OF COURSE HAS BEEN

123
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:10,580
BUSY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE

124
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,415
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BY

125
00:04:12,415 --> 00:04:13,717
CONDUCTING A POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL

126
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:14,217
SHUTTER DIPLOMACY.

127
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:18,188
HE SAID THE IRAN DEAL MADE OUR

128
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:21,958
ALLIES AGREE.

129
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,159
RELEASED AN INCREDIBLY BORING A

130
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,428
HOLIER THOU SANCTIMONIOUS

131
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,963
STATEMENT CALLING THE

132
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:27,697
PRESIDENT'S DECISION MISGUIDED.

133
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:28,365
WE WILL SPARE YOU ALL THOSE

134
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,533
BORING DETAILS.

135
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,668
THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT NEED IT

136
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,137
DIPLOMATIC INPUT FROM A

137
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:34,771
PRESIDENT WHO OVERSAW THE

138
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:37,507
COLLAPSE OF THE MIDDLE EAST, THE

139
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,576
UNFETTERED EXPANSION OF RUSSIAN

140
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:41,711
AGGRESSION, AND A SITUATION ON

141
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,513
THE KOREAN PENINSULA THAT WAS

142
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:44,114
TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

143
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:46,349
OH, AND HE GAVE THEM

144
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:46,750
150 BILLION.

145
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,485
OF COURSE, WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE

146
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,421
COMPLAINING, AMERICA'S CLOSEST

147
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,655
ALLEY IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

148
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:54,357
ISRAEL, IS UNDER A DAILY

149
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:55,658
IMMINENT THREAT FROM IRAQ.

150
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:56,559
THEY ARE PLOTTING THE

151
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:57,460
PRESIDENT'S DECISION.

152
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,496
HERE'S WHAT THE ISRAELI

153
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,230
PRIME MINISTER HAD TO SAY ABOUT

154
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,466
THE PRESENT.

155
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,602
>> FULLY SUPPORTS

156
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,971
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS DECISION

157
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,006
TODAY TO REJECT THE DISASTROUS

158
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:14,444
NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.

159
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:17,047
I OPPOSED IT FROM THE START

160
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:20,650
BECAUSE WE SAID THAT RATHER THAN

161
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,854
BLOCKING IRAN, IT ACTUALLY PAVES

162
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:31,528
THE WAY TO AN ENTIRE ARSENAL.

163
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,028
ISRAEL THINKS THAT

164
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,730
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID A HISTORIC

165
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,197
MOVE.

166
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:38,301
AND THIS IS WHY ISRAEL THANKS

167
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:38,768
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

168
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:39,803
HIS COMMITMENT TO CONFRONT THE

169
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,938
TERRORIST REGIME IN IRAN, AND

170
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:45,508
HIS COMMITMENT TO ENSURE THAT IT

171
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:46,976
IRAN NEVER GETS NUCLEAR WEAPONS,

172
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,278
NOT TODAY, NOT IN THE DECADE,

173
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,280
NOT EVER.

174
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,216
>> Sean: IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK

175
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:57,587
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER REVEALED

176
00:05:57,587 --> 00:05:59,222
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PLAN, CONTINUE TO

177
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,724
DEVELOP A WEAPON SYSTEM THAT IS

178
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:02,792
CAPABLE OF DELIVERING NUCLEAR

179
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:03,259
WARHEADS.

180
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,995
STILL, WAY BEFORE HE WENT PUBLIC

181
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,864
WITH THIS INTELLIGENCE,

182
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,767
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD PROMISED IT

183
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,335
TO SCRAP WHAT A TERRIBLE DEAL HE

184
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:12,936
HAD INHERITED.

185
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:15,138
HE KEPT HIS PROMISE.

186
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:15,738
WATCH THIS.

187
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,807
>> MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO

188
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:18,541
DISMANTLE THE DISASTROUS DEAL

189
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,343
WITH IRAN.

190
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:22,745
I HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS A LONG

191
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:23,513
TIME, I KNOW DEALMAKING.

192
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,815
AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS DEAL

193
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,051
IS CATASTROPHIC.

194
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:30,453
FOR AMERICA, FOR ISRAEL, AND FOR

195
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:33,923
THE WHOLE OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

196
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:36,126
THIS WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE

197
00:06:36,126 --> 00:06:38,361
SIGNING OF THE IRAN DEAL, WHICH

198
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,799
GIVE BACK TO IRAN $150 BILLION

199
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,501
AND GAVE US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

200
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:49,272
IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS

201
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:52,976
ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER

202
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:56,946
NEGOTIATED.

203
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,381
NEVER, EVER EVER IN MY LIFE HAVE

204
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,884
I SEEN ANY TRANSACTION SO

205
00:07:00,884 --> 00:07:03,686
INCOMPETENTLY NEGOTIATED AS A

206
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,623
DEAL WITH THE IRAN.

207
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:09,926
AND I MEAN NEVER.

208
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,261
>> Sean: NOT TONIGHT, THE

209
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:12,629
PRESIDENT IS FULFILLING THAT

210
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:13,363
VERY IMPORTANT CAMPAIGN PROCESS

211
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:16,900
AFTER YEARS OF BOWING DOWN TO

212
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,869
DICTATORS, KISSING THEIR RINGS,

213
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,005
ONCE AGAIN ON THE WORLD STAGE OF

214
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:22,605
PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.

215
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:24,974
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF

216
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:25,875
HISTORY HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING,

217
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,945
IT IS THAT APPEASEMENT NEVER

218
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:29,312
WORKS.

219
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,513
YOU MAY REMEMBER NEVILLE

220
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:30,914
CHAMBERLAIN.

221
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:33,449
HE WAS A BRITISH PRIME MINISTER,

222
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,151
DECLARING PEACE AND OUR TIME

223
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:35,718
AFTER CAVING IN DURING

224
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,520
NEGOTIATIONS AFTER MEETING

225
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,021
HITLER AND MUNICH.

226
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:41,891
TAKE A LOOK.

227
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:45,228
>> THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE

228
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:47,797
PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOW BEEN

229
00:07:47,797 --> 00:07:53,803
ACHIEVED IS IN MY VIEW ONLY THE

230
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,638
PRELUDE TO A LARGER SETTLEMENT

231
00:07:55,638 --> 00:00:00,000
IN WHICH ALL OF EUROPE MAY FIND
