THE CLEVELAND BROWNS
HAD PASSED ON COLIN KAEPERNICK.
IN FACT I WOULD TRY DISTRACTION
AND SEE HOW IT TURNED OUT?
SO,
IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY ñ HE
IS AN INTERESTING PLAYER AND YOU
KNOW THAT HE IS CERTAINLY AMONG
THE TOP 96 QUARTERBACKS IN
THE LEAGUE, AND CERTAINLY WOULD
MAKE THE BROWNS.
BUT I AM ABOUT
TO GIVE THEM CREDIT.
THEIR COACH
HAD SAID DON'T BOTHER ME WITH
THIS KNEELING STUFF.
I WILL TELL
YOU WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GAME.
BUT 
BEFORE WE GET THERE.
EVEN
THOUGH HE IS NOT IN THE LEAGUE
YET, OTHERS HAVE PICKED UP HIS
CAUSE, INCLUDING MARSHAWN LYNCH
WHO IS NOW RAIDER.
ALSO MICHAEL
BENNETT WHO IS A REALLY GREAT
DEFENSIVE PLAYER FOR THE
SEAHAWKS, WAS ALSO KNEELING.
HE
SAID THIS.
SO, IS HE RIGHT?
WE
ARE ABOUT 
TO FIND OUT.
HERE,
LET'S DO IT.
WE HAVE OUR FIRST
WHITE PLAYER KNEELING.
THERE YOU
GO.
I DON'T WANT TO JUST
CELEBRATE THEM, LET'S JUST TAKE
A LOOK AT THE PICTURE.
MEMBERS OF THE BROWNS TOOK A
KNEE DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY WERE HUDDLED
TOGETHER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE
PRAYING.
THAT IS A NICE TOUCH.
THAT INCLUDED THEIR RUNNING
BACK, DUKE JOHNSON, AND SOME OF
THE BETTER PLAYERS.
IT ALSO HAD
A NUMBER OF TEAMMATES, BLACK AND
WHITE, HOLDING ONTO THEIR
SHOULDER PADS.
THIS IS AS BIG A
TEAM STATEMENT AS WE HAVE SEEN
ON THIS ISSUE.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
ONE OF THE PLAYERS IS A WHITE
PLAYER.
I AM A HUGE FOOTBALL
FAN.
I WILL LOOK UP THAT GUY
BEFORE THE DRAFT.
HE EXPLAINS
THIS.
BLESS HIS HEART.
HERE IS
WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET YOU
TO PAY ATTENTION TO.IF PEOPLE
START GETTING FEARFUL AND
LASHING OUT FOR A SECOND THEY
MIGHT REALIZE THAT IT IS A FAIR
POINT.
WE HAVE A SITUATION IN
AMERICA WHERE WAY TOO MANY
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SHOT AND
KILLED BY POLICE WHEN THEY ARE
UNARMED.
WHEN KAEPERNICK DID IT
HE WANTS TO PROVE A POINT THAT
IT WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN.
IS NOT A
LEGITIMATE ISSUE FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICANS?
OF COURSE.
IF
SOMEONE IS TAKING A STAND IN
THIS CASE KNEELING TO BRING OUT
AN ISSUE, FOR ANYONE
IN AMERICA, SHOULD THEY GET
CREDIT?
THEY KEEP CLAIMING THAT
THE FANS ARE AGAINST IT.
BUT DID
YOU EVER POLL THEM?
WHAT ABOUT
PEOPLE THAT ARE FOR IT?
DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA WHICH ONES ARE THE
MAJORITY?
IT IS 32 INCREDIBLY
WITCHY GUYS 
THAT ARE GETTING
THIS DECISION.
MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE YOU
DID, OR THIS PERSPECTIVE.
YOU
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK INTO THEIR
PERSPECTIVE.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
RESPECT THEIR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
THE CLEVELAND BROWNS OR NOT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU'LL
HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR SPEECH,
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE.
IT WOULD
BE A GOOD MOMENT FOR THE TEAMS
TO SAY THIS IS WHAT OUR PLAYERS
CARE ABOUT.
MAYBE IT IS
IMPORTANT?
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU HATE AMERICA OR HATE THE
TROOPS.
WHENEVER THEY WANT AN
EXCUSE TO SHUT DOWN SOMETHING,
THEY SAY TROOPS.
I WANT TROOPS
TO DIE FOR NO REASON.
NOW WE SAY
WE DON'T WANT OUR CIVILIANS TO
DIE FOR NO REASON SO WE NEED
BETTER POLICE TRAINING.
IF YOU
SAY HEY YOU'RE BEING
DISRESPECTFUL TO POLICE, I WILL
CALL THAT NEARLY EQUALLY INSANE.
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.
YOU ARE
TELLING ME THAT NO GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS SHOULD BE CRITICIZED
IN AMERICA?
YOU ARE SAYING NO
GOVERNMENT BODY SHOULD BE
IMPROVED IN AMERICA?
THERE IS A
ONE GOVERNMENT BODY THAT IS
PERFECT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH
IT.
OH, YOU WANT TO CHECK BIG
GOVERNMENT.
YOU CLAIM YOU ARE
FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE RALLIES ñ THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE CHANTING
SOMETHING ELSE.
WHEN IT COMES TO
REAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH, DON'T
PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON IT.
BY THE
WAY GOD BLESS THE CLEVELAND
BROWNS ABOUT PLAYERS, THE
COMMANDER MADE A BIG STAN.
MY
GUESS IS THAT FAR FROM HAVING
THIS ISSUE GO AWAY, THIS IS
GOING TO GET LARGER AND LARGER.
BY THE TIME A QUARTER OF THE
LEAGUE IS KNEELING FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, IT WILL LOOK
AWFULLY STUPID THAT THEY DIDN'T
HAVE THE HERO WHO STARTED THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE
LEAGUE.
MY GUESS IS THAT IF THIS
KEEPS GOING, SOMEONE WILL SAY
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO FIRE
HUNDREDS OF THEM?
OF COURSE
KAEPERNICK YOU ARE ONE OF THE
BEST QUARTERBACKS IN THE
COUNTRY, COME SAVE US.
IS 
THERE
ANYONE BLAKE MORTALS HAS NOT
OVERTHROWN?
AND IF OWNERS,
ESPECIALLY THE JAGUARS, PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL KAEPERNICK.
THAT SHIP HAS NOW COMPLETELY
SAILED, SO HOPE YOUR FOOTBALL
TEAM A LITTLE BIT.
FOR THE REST
OF US, YES, WE ARE LIKELY
LOOKING TO A GOVERNMENT BODY
THAT HAS GUNS AND BADGES WE GAVE
THEM, TRY AND IMPROVE IT.
