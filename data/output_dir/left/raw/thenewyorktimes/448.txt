1
00:00:09,878 --> 00:00:12,442
The tents, they were 
inside of the building.

2
00:00:12,442 --> 00:00:16,492
Everyone chooses a space.
They made it like a house.

3
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,810
My name is Mirwaiz.
I’m from Afghanistan.

4
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,080
This is an old airport.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,530
It’s used for refugees, 
as a camp.

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,720
The first time we arrived here,
the facility wasn’t good.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,459
But step by step, Greek people, 
they helped us.

8
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,628
Help with clothes, foods.

9
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:14,162
We sleep in the airport, we are in the 
terminal of the airport.

10
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:17,572
But we can’t travel to any places.

11
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:23,896
I wish that one day my family and I 
could travel without any problems.

12
00:01:23,896 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean not illegally, legally.
