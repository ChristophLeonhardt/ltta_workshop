that's why I'm out here man because I'm a father of two they killed Stephan Clarke they killed out that they can continue to kill us and it could be any of us you know now having a little bit of color to your skin means you're guilty and that shouldn't be the case good morning and for those of you celebrating happy Easter and Happy Passover from am joy well the world continues to watch as young Americans drive the national debate over guns but a key component of gun violence often goes overlooked Kyra Simon a parkland student delivered that point on our show yesterday initially after the shooting it began with school shootings and then it brought an out to gun violence throughout America there is police brutality there's gun violence every day in inner-city communities and it's not getting the sort of attention but police brutality against black men women and even children even if it was missing in the debate following the Parkland shooting couldn't stay out of the headlines for long exactly two weeks ago Stefan Clark a 22 year old father of two was killed by Sacramento police in his grandmother's backyard he was unarmed according to a private autopsy requested by the family Clark was shot eight times with all but one of those shots striking him in the back police were in the area responding to a report of vandalism meanwhile in Baton Rouge Louisiana police just released body cam footage showing officer Blaine Salamone screaming profanities and threatening to kill Walton sterling before fatally shooting him six times in July of 2016 the footage was released just after the state announced it will not press charges against the officers involved in the shooting and joining me now is Philippa Tebow goth of the John Jay College and the Center for policing equity Maya Wiley senior vice president for social justice at the new school Jamil Smith of Rolling Stone and Eugene Scott of the Washington Post thank you all for being here and Phillip we're gonna start with Alton sterling because you have new information that you just gleaned this morning why don't you share that with us that's right joy I was able to speak with two individuals associated with the Baton Rouge Police Department and this is in the broader context whenever there's an investigation we get the outcome either sustained or unsustained but we've often don't get transparency into the facts of the investigation so I we work in Police Department's all over the country it's not uncommon for law enforcement to reach out to us today I heard a number of disturbing elements the first there are those in the Baton Rouge Police Department and those who were recently retired from who believe that this case was held until after the election with the hopes of a more favorable outcome for the officer after the presidential election in addition they felt the federal prosecutor showed up with the desire to prosecute Blaine Salamone and were essentially told not to and perhaps most disturbingly there are folks inside the department that want it to be known that the director of training in Baton Rouge Police Department has said this individual is going to kill someone unless we have a hold on him meaning he not Alayne Salamone well that exact statement happened before the shooting which is to say and this is not uncommon police departments often are not surprised by the individuals who were involved in this that they know and that there is motivation not to have that be spread elsewhere I also want to say that one of the people I spoke to is a 30-plus year veteran on a force right that this individual in Baton Rouge and around Louisiana understands that black community is a hundred percent have the back of many law enforcement and as a result it's really important for law enforcement to have the communities back hundred percent yeah right that that's it that's an element that shared across law enforcement and it is heartening for the officers that's why they're reaching out yeah right that frankly they don't feel they want to be serving with these kinds of people and that there are situations larger than them and conspiring to make these elements of the case silent yeah and I can tell you just from personal experience friends of mine who are on the police force and who are at very high levels in police force do not want people like Blaine Salamone serving anywhere near them that it's very you know police officers don't want these guys around either because they make they put everybody's lives in danger I just want to play one more time and I realized it's Eastern Passover and normally I wouldn't do this on a Sunday when I know a lot of people are you know in a religious mind but I want to play just a little bit of this body cam video just to drive home the point of who Blaine Salamone is and was on the day that he killed that he that he committed what a lot of people believe was a a a law a purposeful killing of Alton sterling let's take a listen on the call what James on the Karma shoot you in your Ned you understand me Maya the investigation that was done in internally resulted in blame family being fired from the police department but the attorney general's report Samuelson Yan Wei who I recommend everybody follow on Twitter went through that report in prima in detail the two experts who were hired to go through the report are both former police officers one from the notorious Baltimore PD they found that even that screaming obscenities at Alton sterling ninety seconds before killing him threatening and put a gun putting a gun to his head they found that none of that was dispositive of anything being done wrong or the officers not being caught in fear for their life of a man who's pinned on the ground and who cannot access a gun your thoughts on upon including upon hearing what what filiberty birkoff has had to say this morning police thing in the United States is in trouble it's in trouble if we have the kinds of scenarios that we're seeing playing out on videos across the country going unaddressed from a standpoint of transparency and accountability for the behavior of individual police officers and I think Phil is absolutely right in saying individual police officers because as we know there are many police officers who are actually building trust and relationships yes community and recognize that their safety is actually tied to those relationships that they themselves will be safer but what's really happening here is a mentality that happens far too often in police departments which is a feeling of we have to protect our own to protect ourselves when in fact it makes police more vulnerable yeah absolutely and you know I want to go up to Eugene on this just as a matter of putting and I want to let our view know that we we have reached out to the office of the Attorney General in Louisiana who by the way is a former member of the Tea Party caucus he was a congressman and he was a Tea Party House member before he had the job that he has now but we have reached out to the attorney general's office for comment and if we get that comment we will bring that to you Eugene this is also you know particularly with what Philip has had to say this morning the idea that police departments who are investigating cases that could be excessive force or even a criminal matters preferring and hoping that Donald Trump would be elected and that the Attorney General would be someone like Jefferson sessions rather than someone like you know Loretta Lynch or Eric Holder is that something that among people in Washington was a common thought that people believe that policing would get a different look from a Republican administration is that something you've heard on Capitol Hill absolutely if you recall from the 2016 election there were several large police unions that actually endorsed Donald Trump they wanted him to enter the White House because they knew the approach that he was going to take to policing regardless of who his Attorney General was was going to be significantly different from what was happening during the Obama administration and we saw that happen even in addition to getting Jeff Sessions and said the Department of Justice president Trump attracted a lot of criticism for telling police to be rougher on suspects when arresting them not to be as nice and it's quite a different take that he took actually during the election if you go back he actually spoke out about there possibly being some racial bias and there possibly being an issue with the discrimination in America between police officers and people of color and people believe that he'd said those things in part to attract black voters during his whole what in the hell do you have to lose pitch but we have seen since entering the White House that the White House is review let's refer to these things as local matters and has displayed no interest in addressing things on a national level we still have not heard the president response in this case or Stephon Clarke and Jamil Smith I want to go to you because one of the things that we have seen happening is that Blaine Salamone is appealing his firing by the Baton Rouge Police Department in theory he could if he doesn't get his job back there go to another Police Department and get a job there we've seen a number of these cases where an officer is turfed out in one place and turf's out of another the Tamir rice case was one of them where an officer who was pushed out of another department comes in to Cleveland gets a job there and then ends up killing Tamir rice also not prosecuted also in Cleveland and you are a Cleveland native some to come to you on this there was a Michael brelo case and these this was a police officer who's acquitted of manslaughter in the 2012 deaths of Melissa Williams and Timothy Russell after a police chase officers mistook the car backfiring for gunshots officer Michael brelo fired 49 times at the car jumped onto the hood of the car after officers stopped firing kept shooting in total police officers fired over 137 rounds into that car killing two people neither of them were convicted of a crime both of whom all of whom were able to return to work your thoughts Jamel well neither were convicted of a crime but they certainly got the death sentence I think certainly what you saw in my hometown was emblematic of what we see in too many communities throughout this country which is of course this systemic bias and you know gets your implicit bias within police departments against communities of color now in Sacramento where I've been reporting for this entire week you see a community that is you know simply had enough of this you see people who are you know traumatized not simply by the killing of Stephan Clarke but also by past killings certainly we had there was a march on the day of his funeral on Thursday and a young woman who I spoke with was stuck in traffic by the March and she got out and supported them because her cousin had been killed by police in Chico California which is nearby so we're talking about a nationwide issue here and I think Eugene's column you know spoke well to that point and so did April Ryan you know I think what the White House is attempting to do here by saying that it's a local matter is to deny the systemic nature of the problem to say that it's a few bad apples when in fact we know that's not the case and we should note that there has been an incident yesterday the New York Times reporting that a sheriff's vehicle hit a woman at at the Stephon Clark protests in Sacramento Phil you're seeing cities paying out multi-million dollar settlements rather than seek you know redress in the criminal justice system tell me arise case over six million dollars paid out Walter Scott over six million dollars paid out Eric garner nearly six million Michael Brown Akai Gurley's Sandra bland you see it over and over again these cities in a way would rather pay out of their coffers than actually encourage the attorneys general to actually seek prosecutions and it begs the question is that really the worth of a black life because the criminal system right is saying people don't have to go to jail but the civil system right either through negotiations there or through actual findings is saying actually there was wrongdoing people are getting fired yeah so is that the worth of a black life I have to say I have to echo what I heard all this morning from everyone I spoke to him Baton Rouge where else are these communities supposed to go if you don't think that this is a national issue right but somehow you say that you're concerned about public safety when you see this over and over and over again where are you supposed to go and I've got line officers lieutenants chiefs calling saying I don't want you to have to qualify anymore that many are good but all right I want you to be able to talk about the many many good things that we actually do without this dark stain on our career and and these are people's lives that they've committed to this we're talking about thirty and forty year veterans on this saying I don't want to have my city pay out six million dollars for an officer that we knew should've been on the job in the first place because I got anger control issues because I want to go into a barrel roll when they go to a kid's birthday party that's insane it's it's it's beneath the dignity of a noble profession and I work with too many good chiefs and too many good law enforcement officers for us to decide that this is a local issue as if we're too dumb to see a national pattern yeah absolutely very quick I know we are out of time but I want to play everyone is talking about the local issue thing and it in case our viewers don't know what our guests are referring to this is April Ryan reporter April Ryan asking Sarah Huckabee Sanders if the White House ceases of the National entry really quickly if we can play that what does he say about weeding out bad policing when you continue to see these kinds of situations occur over and over again in these specific cases and these specific instances those would be left up to local authorities to make that determination and not something for the federal government to win by Mary Garner they cried out eleven times I can't breathe his mother is still looking for something an indictment of the police officers in New York because the president is he asked them what's the status is it something loose something's going to happen I'm not aware of any specific action once again these would be local matters that should be left up to the local authority very quickly Eugene Scott any any thought then at the Justice Department's gonna have any changes on that absolutely not because sir this white house these still are local isolated issues despite we're being able to name incidents from all across the country usually in places that the president has not won himself we should not expect significant change anytime soon very quick I want to give some last words Jimmy Smith black lives matter has been a lot less active in the Trump era any reporting on on why and whether or not the intimidation factor from the federal government is playing a role certainly I don't think that's the case in Sacramento they've been they've been key to the build black movement that's building they're certainly partnering with other local organizations to do so so I don't think that that's necessarily an accurate assessment myah three times more likely to be shot by a police officer if you're black three times the reality is the law says when you can use lethal force it doesn't say when you should use lethal force so the critical question here is public accountability on how police departments are going to train and enforce rules around when you should not just whether you can I'm filthy if you could please keep us posted on the things that you heard today the breaking news or the updates that we've gotten today that potentially this the investigation into the alton sterling case was deliberately held after until after the election in the hopes that a more favorable administration meaning donald trump would come into office that federal prosecutors may have wanted to prosecute but were instructed not to do so and that the director of training in baton rouge may have issued a very dire warning about Salamone the officer heard screaming obscenities at Alton's sterling 90 seconds before he killed him Maya Wiley will be back with us many thanks Phillip at e book off who did two days this weekend and we really appreciate your time Jamil Smith and Eugene Scott think he will have you all backing up next more and Roy hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe
