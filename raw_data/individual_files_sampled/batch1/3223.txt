the city of Detroit has had a long-lasting loved hate relationship with the People Mover People Mover is great I don't think it's a good investment no the People Mover is a unique light rail system in downtown Detroit and even during the Auto Show the busiest time of year for Detroit the People Mover trains were usually pretty empty or gas station Broadway station I wish it were broader I wish it went out further the people mover makes 13 stops through downtown Detroit and it only covers a 2.9 miles circumference not to mention it only goes in one direction so if you want to go from Times Square to Cobo Center using the people mover you have to go all the way around downtown Detroit stopping at 10 stations along the way or you can just walk in get there in about the same time but I just 75 cents a ride the fare is really cheap and it does have its uses for those who live work and play in downtown Detroit there's people that live downtown and that's how they get to work every morning real convenient I think it's a great thing for the city in troit I think it's very underutilized though in fact it's so underutilized that the Detroit transportation Corporation the company responsible for the people mover is spending nearly $4 for each and every trip taken on the people mover it's like anything - in the city Detroit nothing makes money here so how do we go about explaining this love-hate relationship between Detroit and the people mover Detroit is a car town so anything any public transportation has a long push to to get adapted by us we're used to getting in their cars and driving you even if it's two blocks that's what we do
