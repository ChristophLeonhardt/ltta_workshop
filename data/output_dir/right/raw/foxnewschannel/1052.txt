00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:10,047
>> WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.

6
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:12,049
THE ART EXHIBIT IN THE

00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,150
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED

00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,252
THIS, HERE IS WHAT THEY SAID.

10
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:17,754
MODERN, I AM SAYING, MODERN ART

11
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,823
IS WHAT IT REPRESENTS IN THIS

12
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:20,858
CASE.

13
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:27,231
YOU ARE LOOKING AT ENORMOUS TERD

14
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:27,998
SCULPTURES.

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" DESCRIBED

16
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,601
IT THAT WAY.

17
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,636
IT IS AN EXHIBITION WHERE YOU

18
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:34,805
CAN WALK THROUGH THE EXCREMENT.

19
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:38,442
WHEN BODY FUNCTIONS BECOME, WHEN

20
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,142
BODILY FUNCTIONS ARE THE FOCUS

21
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:40,844
OF ART, WE ARE IN TROUBLE.

22
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:44,281
HOW DO WE GET FROM THE PIETA TO

23
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,983
FECAL MATTER.

24
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:48,819
THESE ARE ENORMOUS --

25
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,187
>> Laura: WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED

26
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:50,621
TO TELL US?

27
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:55,092
THAT LIFE IS BIG TERD?

28
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:57,094

00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,266
IT IS AN ENORMOUS DOG JUST DROP

31
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:02,566
THIS.

32
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,034
WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHY IT IS

33
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,669
HERE, I DO NOT KNOW.

34
00:01:05,669 --> 00:01:07,004
BUT THEY HAVE DONE SCULPTURES IN

35
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,873
THE PAST IN 2005, THEY DID A

36
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:13,844
SCULPTURE OF FROZEN URINE.

37
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:16,647
THE ONLY THING I LIKE ABOUT THE

38
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:17,414
EXHIBIT, EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME

39
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:17,848
DETERMINATION.

40
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:21,919
IT IS CRAP.

41
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,820
>> Laura: NOW A NEW EXHIBIT,

42
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,157
SPEAKING OF EXHIBITS THAT IS NOT

43
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,626
CRAP.

44
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:30,327
AT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MUSEUM

45
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:33,196
IN WASHINGTON, OPRAH WINFREY HAS

46
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:36,033

00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:45,976
WITH GAYLE KING.

50
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:50,047
IT IS CALLED WATCHING OPRAH.

52
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:52,349

00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,553
I LOVE IT.

00:01:56,553 --> 00:01:59,623
>> LOOK AT THAT.

55
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:00,924

00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,292
THAT I LOVE MYSELF SO FIERCELY

57
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:05,028
AND KNOW THAT MY VOICE MATTERS.

58
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,030
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO CRY.

59
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,433
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WAS

60
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,033
YOUR GIFT AND OUR GIFT TO

61
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:11,368
AMERICA.

62
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,004
SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

63
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,640
>> THE GUY WHO WAS DRIVING ME

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,741
THIS MORNING, HE STARTED

65
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:18,475
WATCHING THE

66
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:19,142
"OPRAH WINFREY SHOW" AND HE

67
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:20,310
WOULD SEE HER WALK IN THE AISLE

68
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,478
WITH THE AUDIENCE AND SOME OF

69
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,613
THE ISSUES THAT SHE WOULD COVER

70
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:24,381
AND HE SAID, I KNEW THAT SHE WAS

71
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:27,050
A GOOD HUMAN.

72
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,452

GETTING TO ME.

75
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,624
AT THE BOTTOM LINE, SHE REALLY

76
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,625
IS A GREAT HUMAN WHO JUST WANTS

77
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:40,464
TO DO GOOD IN THE WORLD.

BUT SHE DESERVES IT.
