1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go on any trip it's useful to</font>

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,419
get some books out we double where I'm

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,009
going just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some kind of</font>

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge and for me as well it's often</font>

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,370
been the case that i'll find out fact

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,800
about a city after I've gone there want

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back the con so I just got out a</font>

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,360
lot of books and this one was kind of my

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,910
main inspiration for the trip it's got

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,100
all these different itineraries for<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,350
York Washington DC and the mid-atlantic

12
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,300
is a book from lonely planet and their

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,980
trip for Pittsburgh was all about Andy

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,470
Warhol who was born there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

15
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,849
there then I got some books out about

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,740
architecture architecture is not my

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,140
strong feel but my older system knows a

18
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,570
lot about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has kind of in some</font>

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,219
way to spread my interest about it also

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
my grandfather on my mother's side was

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,850
an architect so it's something that's

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">always been kind of interesting to me</font>

23
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:44,820
another thing that I really like is

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,530
there photo books this one's called

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dream Street and it's all made up of W</font>

26
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eugene Smith's Pittsburgh project it was</font>

27
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,590
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a photo essay of</font>

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,760
Pittsburgh would then he had all these

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,489
photos left over that sound collected

30
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,469
and put them in this book the last one

31
00:00:58,469 --> 00:00:59,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a book about Andy Warhol the</font>

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,379
autobiography<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sex life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Andy</font>

33
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,730
Warhol this one's really interesting

34
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,379
it's all made up of interviews and the

35
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,000
videos cut off there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some entirely</font>

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,799
inexplicable reason but what I was going

37
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,210
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that what's interesting about</font>

38
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it given that the title is the</font>

39
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,689
autobiography<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sex life</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of andy</font>

40
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,610
warhol's composed entirely of interviews

41
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,759
with other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ran into</font>

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,470
andy warhol and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree all</font>

43
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,299
throughout his life so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not written</font>

44
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,070
by Andy Warhol himself that's written

45
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,990
through the voices of other people to

46
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,460
some extent<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would argue that cities</font>

47
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write themselves they are written</font>

48
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">by other people as well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

49
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,689
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember when you read</font>

50
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,090
these books and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing your kind</font>

51
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,829
of research are in place before<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

52
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,020
a very open mind and not to have your

53
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,970
preconceptions of it completely built

54
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,619
and completely fixed before you go into

55
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there are many ways in</font>

56
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,840
which texts and images and all sorts of

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,210
guidebooks can evoke certain aspects of

58
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,549
a place but it can never contain the

59
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,380
place fully it can give the illusion

60
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,020
that it does but I don't know I think

61
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in with a open mind</font>

62
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,110
but it's also good to do some research I

63
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,090
would say as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin to draw to the</font>

64
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">close of the Pittsburgh edition of zorro</font>

65
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,719
can't drive I'll just let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,270
I will be tackling LA and seattle and

67
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,060
then miami in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of eight</font>

68
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,470
weeks or so look up for

69
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,210
those videos more Pittsburgh videos to

70
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,830
