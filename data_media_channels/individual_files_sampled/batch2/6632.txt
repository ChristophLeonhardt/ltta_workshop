when we first started I was making a comment that it was over 600 days since Paul Ryan had a public town hall his campaign got a hold of that they didn't like hearing that interviews so they demanded that PolitiFact check up on it they're like what we do we have these teleconferences you know tax payer payer funded deals or he has a friend that owns a business that donates to him that don't have a captive audience that he'll go talk to he's like we do other things instead of these are public town halls so politifact came back and they said I had that we had to correct ourselves that it wasn't 600 days since Paul Ryan at a town hall it was 650 days since Paul Ryan had a public tunnel and that since gone up to over two years and over two years since Paul Ryan has had a public town hall in the light of his champion his bill that he's champions so I'm assuming he's not gonna want to debate you either I don't you know I'd be happy if he would just be in the district to be answerable so that people could ask him questions right now but he's not congressman mark Pocan has had has had five town halls in his absence and he's going I mean to every county to have a Town Hall since Paul Ryan that'd be there he's afraid of people and with the horrible policies that he's pushed in I don't blame him how can you claim to care for people that you don't even want to see you know and now the fundraisers that they do you know and that's the thing too I understand the fundraising aspect of it and if his position as Speaker to help other people oh that's fine but if you're gonna do fundraising for other candidates you at least need to be you know accountable to the people of your district at least show up there so that's why we're able to and that's why I find it kind of amazing we were able to all raise in three two one and still have events in it in the district because we care
