OWN PEOPLE FIRST. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. HILLARY CLINTON RECENTLY CONDEMNED THE POLICIES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AS HORRIFIC WHICH IS STILL SURELY COMING AS NEWS. IN 2003 THIS IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON SAID ABOUT THE CRISIS ON THE BORDER. WATCH THIS. I AM ADAMANTLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP EMPLOYING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN OF COURSE EXCEPT FOR HER PARTY'S CALCULATIONS THAT I COULD ONLY WIN BY IMPORTING A NEW CLASS OF VOTERS, WHICH THEY ARE TRYING YOUR BEST TO DO. MARK STEYN IS AN AUTHOR AND A COLUMNIST AND HE JOINS US TONIGHT. MARK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PREPARED TO TAKE A LECTURE ON A BIBLE FROM HILLARY CLINTON OR ABRUPT ON MIKE BARBARA BOXER OR THE REST, BUT DO YOU FEEL EDIFIED BY THIS? IT'S INTERESTING, I THINK BEING RATHER SELECTIVE IN THIS IN THE FOCAL FERVOR. IT'S IMPORTANT TO THE LEFT, AND THAT'S WHAT IMMIGRATION IS. IT'S PUBLIC POLICY. HILLARY AND OF THE REST OF THE LEFT, AND I REGRET NOW AN ENTIRE PHALANX OF FIRST LADIES HAS DECIDED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SENTIMENTAL IS A STUB PUBLIC POLICY. THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY ON ORANGE ALERT. OVER HALF OF THE ILLEGAL ALIENS PRESENT BROKE INTO A COUNTRY ON ORANGE ALERT. THAT MEANS THEY COME HERE SINCE 9-11. THE SECURITY DEMANDS TO KNOW THE CONSISTENCY OF THAT PUMPKIN PIE IF THEY ARE FLYING HOME TO THANKSGIVING FROM NEW YORK TO CLEVELAND, BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS ENTITLED TO WALK ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE IF THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE A LITTLE MUPPET INTEL WITH THEM.

IF I MAKE A DOMESTIC FLIGHT, THEIR BORDERS ARE OPEN AND I MAY BE THE HARSHEST PERSON HERE SPEAKING TONIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW AS A LEGAL IMMIGRANT HOW HEARTLESS AND RUTHLESS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION POLICY, AND THESE DEMOCRATS, LAURA BUSH NEVER HAS A WORD TO SAY ABOUT THAT. Tucker: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU SHOWED UP TO THE AIRPORT WITHOUT A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SAID IT, I HAVE A MORAL RIGHT TO GET ON THIS PLANE INTO A RACIST FOR NOT LETTING ME ON. WHAT THAT WORK? WE ARE BIFURCATING INTO A SOCIETY WHERE THE LAW-ABIDING ARE SUBJECT TO EVERMORE WHILE THE LAWLESS HAVE SOMEHOW VENERATED AND FETISH US. Tucker: BUT YOU ACTUALLY ARE FOREIGN BOARD BORN. AND I WAS CROSSING DERBY LINE, AND RATHER THEY THREATEN TO CALL EYES AND HAVE MY DAUGHTER DEPORTED. THEN SHE'D BE IN CANADA AND HE WOULD BE STUCK HERE IN AMERICA, AND I SAID I WOULD BE MUCH OF A FATHER IF I DID THAT BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU 10 MINUTES AFTER YOU DEPORT HER, I WILL BRING HER BACK TO WHATEVER COUNTRY YOU DEPORT HER TOO. BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND BEING IN AMERICA IS THAT I HAVE TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY CHILDREN, THEN I PASSED. AND I'M SURPRISED, FRANKLY, AND ALL OF THESE HARDWORKING PEOPLE ARE BEING SNATCHED FROM THE BOSOMS OF THEIR MOTHERS. IT'S SOULFUL AND HEARTBREAKING, WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY AT THE BORDER, YOU CAN COME IN BUT IF YOU DO YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE TAKEN FROM YOU. THEN PEOPLE WILL SAY I DON'T WANT TO BE SEPARATED FOR MY CHILDREN, CAN I GO BACK ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE TO THE SOUTHERN SHORE. THAT'S A DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE
