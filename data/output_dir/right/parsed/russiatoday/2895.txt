now on the question of a second
independence referendum the question
isn't whether there could be a
referendum but whether there should be a
referendum I don't think people want a
referendum today we believe it'll be
about 300,000 pounds 300,000 pounds
sorry 3,000 police or eternam no I mean
sorry how much will they cause
the Secretary of State's for
international development
Priti Patel has resigned calls have
mounted for her to step down after she
held meetings with Israeli politicians
while on holiday without telling Downing
Street I have decided not to proceed
with the class for next measures set out
in the budget
there will be no increases in National
Insurance contribution rates in this
Parliament we agreed that the government
should call a general election to be
held on the 8th of June
Britain's morning headlines described
the election as a gamble that failed
causing mayhem legitimacy and ability to
provide that certainty
as we do we will continue to work with
our friends and allies in the Democratic
Unionist Party in particular at least
someone got a landslide the list has
emerged of 36 Tory MPs accused of
inappropriate behavior in the wake of
the Harvey Weinstein scandal Michael
Fallon was the first cabinet minister to
be named while our opponents flirt with
a foreign policy of neutrality and
prepare for a run on the ground some
people say a public sector working
together we have bounced back we've
created record numbers of jobs so why
why we will never ever excuse me
we will never hesitate to act where
businesses aren't operating as they
should let this party celebrate the
wealth creators the risk takers the
innovators and entrepreneurs that were
shared around the globe
