CONFIRMATION, THERE IS THE 
RIGHT ON THE PART OF EVERY 
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE TO 
RELEASE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE OR 
HE BELIEVES ARE APPROPRIATE, IN 
MY VIEW. 
AND TO DELEGATE THIS DECISION 
TO AN UNAPPOINTED AND 
UNCONFIRMED AND LARGELY UNKNOWN 
FIGURE, BILL BURKE, WHO USED TO 
WORK FOR THE NOMINEE, IS THE 
HEIGHT OF 
>>> I WAS CONCERNED AND WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN A WITNESS 
IS QUESTIONED ABOUT A DOCUMENT, 
THE WITNESS HAS ACCESS TO THE 
DOCUMENT. 
IS NOT FARE TO THE WITNESS WHO 
HAS, OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
CAREER, BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 
AUTHORSHIP, THE REVIEW OF NOT 
JUST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, BUT 
MANY MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS IN 
HIS LIFETIME. 
THAT WISNER'S -- THIS WITNESS 
OR ANY OTHER, TO NOT GIVE THEM 
A COPY AND ALLOW HIM TO RESPOND 
WHILE HE IS BEING QUESTIONED 
ABOUT IT. 
THAT'S WHY I OFFERED TO SENATOR 
BOOKER AND SENATOR AND BOOKER 
-- SENATOR BOOKER AND I HAD A 
HELPFUL CONVERSATION. 
WE RELEASED THE SAME DOCUMENT 
NOW THE SAME SUBJECT. 
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE 
THESE AVAILABLE, TO MAKE THEM 
PUBLIC. 
WE CAN BE FAIR TO THE WITNESS, 
TO THE NOMINEE. 
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT SINCE 
THE CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT 
THE PROCESS IS RIGGED AND 
CHARGED AND UNFAIR, THAT IT'S 
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS, I 
COMPLETELY DISAGREE. 
WE ARE NOT DEALING IN A LAWLESS 
ENVIRONMENT, WE ARE DEALING 
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 
ACT. 
WE HAVE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE THE 
SUBJECT OF PRIVILEGES, THAT 
HAVE TO BE ASSERTED. 
BILL BURKE IS THE DESIGNEE FOR 
THAT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION
AND HAS THE PREROGATIVE OF 
ASSERTING PRIVILEGES. 
BUT, THROUGH AN ACCOMMODATION 
WITH THE SENATE, THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO ALLOW US 
TO GAIN ACCESS TO OTHER 
DOCUMENTS TO WHICH WE WOULD NOT 
HAVE ACCESS, THEY HAVE AGREED 
TO HAND THOSE OVER WITH THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE THIS 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS 
AND THERE ARE MEANS BY WHICH WE 
CAN CLEAR DOCUMENTS THAT WE 
WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO 
CLEAR. 
IT WORKED HERE AND IT'S BEEN 
CLEARED AND I THINK WE SHOULD 
MOVE FORWARD. 
THANK YOU. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> SENATOR URBAN OR FEINSTEIN, 
WHICHEVER CAN GO FIRST. 
>> I WILL ACCEPT, THANK YOU. 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BY 
AGREEMENT WITH PRIVATE LAWYER, 
BILL BURKE, THE CHAIRMAN HAS 
DESIGNATED 190,000 PAGES OF 
KAVANAUGH'S RECORD RECORD, 
COMMUNITY CONFIDENTIAL AND 
THEY'VE ARGUED THEY CAN USE 
THESE DOCUMENTS AT THE HEARING 
OR RELEASE THEM TO THE PUBLIC. 
UNLIKE THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE, AND I'VE BEEN A 
MEMBER FOR ABOUT TWO DECADES, 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DOESN'T 
HAVE ANY STANDING RULES ON HOW 
AND WHEN DOCUMENTS ARE 
DESIGNATED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
PREVIOUSLY, THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE HAS MADE MATERIAL 
CONFIDENTIAL ONLY THROUGH 
BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT AND THAT 
HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN THIS CASE. 
THIS IS, WITHOUT PRECEDENT, THE 
REPUBLICAN'S CLAIM THAT 
CHAIRMAN LEAHY ACCEPTED 
DOCUMENTS ON A COMMUNITY 
CONFIDENTIAL BASIS DURING THE 
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION, IT'S MY 
UNDERSTANDING THEY WERE 
PROCESSED THROUGH THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES, NOT PRIVATE PARTISAN 
LAWYERS AND REPUBLICANS AGREED. 
99% OF THE KAGAN WHITE HOUSE 
RECORDS WERE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE 
AND COULD BE USED FREELY BY ANY 
MEMBER. 
BY CONTRAST, THE COMMITTEE HAS 
ONLY 7% OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
WHITE HOUSE RECORDS AND ONLY 4% 
OF THOSE ARE AVAILABLE TO THE 
PUBLIC. 
NO SENATE OR COMMITTEE RULE 
GRANTS THE CHAIRMAN UNILATERAL 
AUTHORITY TO DESIGNATE DOCUMENTS
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THAT STAMP, 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL, GOT ON 
THESE DOCUMENTS. I SENT A LETTER
AUGUST 10, 2018 OBJECTING TO 
THE BLANKET DESIGNATION OF 
DOCUMENTS AS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL AND I OFFERED TO 
WORK WITH THE CHAIR. 
HE REFUSED. 
JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS SAID THE 
CHAIRMAN A LETTER ON AUGUST 
28TH, RESTATING THE OBJECTION 
TO THE CHAIR'S DESIGNATION AS 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL AND 
REQUESTING PUBLIC RELEASE. 
AS I'VE LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT ARE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL,
THEY DO NOT AFFECT ANY OF THE 
USUAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD DENY 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIALITY AND, 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I THINK THAT IS A 
PROBLEM. 
I THINK WE ARE ENTITLED TO ALL 
RECORDS AND I THINK THE PUBLIC 
IS ENTITLED TO ALL RECORDS. 
ALL RECORDS THAT ARE 
APPROPRIATE AND DO NOT PUT 
FORWARD PERSONAL INFORMATION OR 
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD 
OTHERWISE NOT BE DISCLOSED. 
SO, I DO THINK WE HAVE A 
PROBLEM AND I THINK, FOR THE 
FUTURE, WE OUGHT TO SETTLE THAT 
PROBLEM WITH SOME KIND OF A 
WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
TWO SIDES. 
WHETHER THAT IS AN AGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE 
ENTIRE COMMITTEE, OR BETWEEN 
THE CHAIRMAN IN THE RANKING 
MEMBER, I THINK IT DOESN'T 
MATTER MUCH. 
I THINK THE FACT IS THAT WE 
SHOULD AGREE ON WHO DETERMINES 
SOMETHING IS COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENIAL. 
WHAT IS THE CRITERIA AND THE 
RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC? 
PARTICULARLY, IN THE EVENT OF A 
SUPREME COURT HEARING. 
>> SENATOR, SENATOR DURBIN? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE, SENATOR 
WHITE HOUSE, I DON'T WANT MY 
SILENCE TO BE INTERPRETED AS 
CONSENT TO THE PROCESS THAT WE 
HAVE FACED BEFORE THIS SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
IT'S UNLIKE ANY PROCESS I HAVE 
EVER SEEN. 
THIS DESIGNATION OF COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL SHOULD BE PUT IN 
HISTORIC CONTEXT. 
THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR US LATER THIS AFTERNOON TO 
MEET IN CONFIDENTIAL AND SECRET 
PRIVATE SESSION TO DISCUSS THIS 
NOMINEE. 
THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL. 
IT'S DONE FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY 
NOMINEE AND SOME MEETINGS ARE 
LITERALLY LASTING A MINUTE OR 
TWO AND WE SAY THERE IS NOTHING 
TO TALK ABOUT AND WE ARE 
LEAVING BUT IT'S HAPPENED IN 
THE PAST THAT WHENEVER WE'VE 
DEALT WITH COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL IT WAS SOMETHING 
VERY SPECIFIC AND USUALLY VERY 
PERSONAL TO A NOMINEE AND IT 
WAS DONE BY BIPARTISAN 
AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD PROTECT 
THE NOMINEE FROM ASSERTIONS OR 
COMMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE ANY 
TRUTH TO THEM, WHATSOEVER. 
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION AND THAT IS A FAR 
CRY FROM WHAT WE'VE FACED WITH 
THIS NOMINEE. 
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND I SAID 
THIS IN MY OPENING STATEMENT 
HERE -- THE AUTHORITY WE'VE 
GIVEN TO A MAN NAMED BILL 
BURKE, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE 
NOMINEE, THAT WE HAVE SAID TO 
MR. BURKE, YOU, YOU WILL DECIDE 
WHAT AMERICA GETS TO SEE ABOUT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND YOU WILL 
MAKE THE DECISION AS TO WHICH 
DOCUMENTS WE WILL BE ALLOWED TO 
DISCUSS OPENLY AND PUBLICLY IN 
WHICH DOCUMENTS WE CANNOT. 
WHO IS THIS MAN? 
BY WHAT AUTHORITY COULD HE 
POSSIBLY BE DENYING TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, INFORMATION 
ABOUT A MAN WHO IS SEEKING A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT TO THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND? 
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IS 
USUALLY THE STARTING POINT OF 
THIS PROCESS. 
I PUT IN THE RECORD YESTERDAY, 
A STATEMENT FROM THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES DISAVOWING THIS WHOLE 
PROCESS, SAYING THIS IS NOT THE 
WAY WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE 
PAST. 
WE USUALLY INITIATE THIS. 
PLEASE GIVE US A FEW WEEKS TO 
DO THIS IN AN ORDERLY WAY BUT 
THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION NOT TO GO DOWN 
THAT PATH AND NOT TO TAKE THE 
SAME COURSE WE HAVE ON PREVIOUS 
NOMINEES. 
INSTEAD, TO ALLOW, TO THIS 
GENTLEMAN, BILL BURKE, A PRIVATE
ATTORNEY, THE AUTHORITY TO 
DECIDE WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
CAN SEE ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND OTHER 
CAPACITIES. 
WHO IS BILL BURKE? 
ALL I KNOW IS HE WAS ONCE AN 
ASSISTANT TO THE NOMINEE AND 
I'M TOLD HE IS NOT ONLY THE 
ATTORNEY FOR GEORGE W. BUSH, 
BUT ALSO FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL, MR. MCGHAN. 
MR. PRIEBUS, THE FORMER CHIEF 
OF STAFF TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES, AND STEVE 
BANNON, A MAN WHOM I COULDN'T 
CHARACTERIZE IN A FEW WORDS. 
HE IS THE PERSONAL ATTORNEY AND 
IN THIS SITUATION, HE IS NOW 
THE LITMUS TEST ON THE FILTER 
TO DECIDE WHAT THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE WILL SEE ABOUT THIS 
NOMINEE AND THAT'S WHY WE BRING 
THIS ISSUE BEFORE YOU. 
LEST YOU THINK WE ARE CARPING 
ONA TRIFLE HERE, WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT WEATHER THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT 
TO KNOW. 
WE NOW KNOW THAT LESS THAN 10% 
OF THE DOCUMENTS REFLECTING THE 
PUBLIC CAREER OF MR. KAVANAUGH 
HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
I JUST WANT TO SAY TO MY 
COLLEAGUES, PARTICULARLY MY 
COLLEAGUE FROM NEW JERSEY, I 
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I 
CONCUR WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
AND LET'S JUMP INTO THIS PIT 
TOGETHER. 
I HOPE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL 
JOIN ME, SO THAT THERE IS GOING 
TO BE SOME RETRIBUTION AGAINST 
THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY, 
COUNT ME IN. 
I WANT TO BE PART OF THIS 
PROCESS. 
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW BILL 
BURKE, THIS PRIVATE ATTORNEY, 
HAS THE RIGHT TO SAY -- IS ONE 
OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED -- 
THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A 
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT. 
A TOP SECRET DOCUMENT. 
A DOCUMENT RELATING TO THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE U.S. BY
WHAT RIGHT, BY WHAT AUTHORITY 
CAN MR. BURKE POSSIBLY 
DESIGNATED DOCUMENT AS 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL? 
HE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. 
HE ONLY HAS AUTHORITY BECAUSE 
HE HAS THE CONSENT AND THE 
COOPERATION OF THE PUBLIC -- 
THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT 
BRINGS US TO THIS MOMENT. 
LET ME SAY IN CLOSING, ONE LAST 
THING. 
I'M SORRY THAT ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES HAS CHARACTERIZED 
ALL OF THIS ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THIS 
HEARING AS CONTEMPTUOUS. 
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT SAID 
BEFORE IN A FULL COMMITTEE 
MEETING BUT IT'S BEEN SAID AND 
DONE PARTICULARLY SORRY THAT HE 
SINGLED OUT ONE OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES ON THIS SIDE AND 
ACCUSED HIM OF CONDUCT 
UNBECOMING A UNITED STATES 
SENATOR. 
I THINK STATEMENTS LIKE THAT 
ARE PERSONAL AND DISPARAGING 
AND THEY QUESTION THE MOTIVE OF 
THE COLLEAGUE. 
IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD DO OUR 
VERY BEST TO AVOID IN THE U.S. 
SENATE, IF WE ARE EVER GOING TO 
RESTORE THE REPUTATION OF THIS 
BODY. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> MAY I MAKE A BRIEF POINT? 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I'M LOOKING AT A 
WALL STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE 
BACK DURING THE ELENA KAGAN 
NOMINATION AND IT SAYS, 
DOCUMENT PRODUCTION FROM ELENA 
KAGAN'S YEARS IN THE CLINTON 
WHITE HOUSE, COUNSEL'S OFFICE 
WAS SUPERVISED BY BRUCE 
LINDSAY, WHOSE WHITE HOUSE 
TENURE OVERLAPPED WITH MS. 
KAGAN. 
BILL CLINTON DESIGNATED MR. 
LINDSEY TO SUPERVISE RECORDS 
FROM HIS PRESIDENCY IN 
COOPERATION WITH THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES AND RECORDS IN 
ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. 
PRESIDENT BUSH, BY CHOOSING MR. 
BURKE, IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT 
PRESIDENT CLINTON DID IN 
CHOOSING BRUCE LINDSAY FOR THAT 
SAME PURPOSE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> I THINK MY COLLEAGUE -- COUNT
ME IN, TOO. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I, TOO, REFERRED 
TO A SO-CALLED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT DEEMED 
SUCH BY ONE BILL BURKE AND WHAT 
WE ALL KNOW, WE KNOW WHO HE IS, 
AT THIS POINT. 
HAD THE NOMINEE ASKED ME FOR A 
COPY OF THAT SO-CALLED COMMITTEE
CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT, I WOULD 
HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO RELEASE IT 
TO HIM OUR GIVE IT TO HIM. 
I'M RELEASING THAT DOCUMENT TO 
THE PRESS AND I WOULD DEFY 
ANYONE READING THIS DOCUMENT TO 
BE ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS 
SHOULD BE DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL 
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. 
THANK YOU. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? I 
KNOW YOU'VE MENTIONED A NUMBER 
OF TIMES THAT I WENT THROUGH 
THE PROCESS. 
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, HOWEVER,
THAT I ALSO WAS ON NUMEROUS 
LETTERS ASKING FOR ALL THESE 
DOCUMENTS TO BE RELEASED. 
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE REPEATEDLY 
ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS TO BE 
RELEASED. 
I GO BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED ON 
THE FIRST MORNING OF THIS 
HEARING IN THAT IS THAT WE 
POINTED OUT THAT WHEN THERE ARE 
42,000 DOCUMENTS THAT ARE 
DUMPED ON US IN ONE NIGHT, 
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ADEQUATELY 
BE ABLE TO REVIEW THEM AND AS 
THEY REVIEW THEM, THEY WILL 
FIND DOCUMENTS THEY WANT TO BE 
MADE PUBLIC AND THAT THEY WANT 
TO ASK THE NOMINEE ABOUT. 
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS 
BECAUSE THIS HEARING WAS RAMROD 
THROUGH AND WE WEREN'T GIVEN 
THE MONTH IT WOULD TAKE TO LOOK 
AT THESE DOCUMENTS, WE ARE 
WHERE WE ARE. 
MY REMEDY FOR THIS, IN ADDITION 
TO MAKING IT CLEAR THAT I JOIN 
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE SUPPORT ú 
IS THAT WE MUST SOMEHOW 
EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF EVERY 
SINGLE DOCUMENT AND WE MUST 
HAVE SOME KIND OF RULES IN 
PLACE TO GET THEM OUT. I 
UNDERSTAND YOU WOULD WANT TO 
TAKE OUT SOCIAL SECURITY 
NUMBERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 
THAT'S NORMAL BUT WE SIMPLY 
CANNOT HIDE THESE DOCUMENTS 
FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. 
IT IS THE HIGHEST COURT OF THE 
LAND. 
LOOKING BACK, EVERYONE WAS 
CITING THE FOUNDERS OF THIS 
COUNTRY AND I FOUND A QUOTE 
THAT REALLY WORKS FROM MADISON. 
A POPULAR GOVERNMENT WITHOUT 
POPULAR INFORMATION OR THE 
MEANS OF ACQUIRING IT IS BUT A 
PROLOGUE TO A FARCE OR A 
TRAGEDY. 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT HERE. 
BY RAM RIDING THIS THROUGH FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS, WE ARE 
DENYING THE ACCESS TO THE 
DOCUMENTS, WE ARE DENYING THE 
PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO SEE WHAT IS 
OUT THERE AND IT'S JUST NOT HOW 
WE DO THINGS IN MY STATE AND 
NOT HOW WE'VE DONE THINGS IN 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> I'M GOING TO CALL ON SENATOR 
LEE AND THEN YOU. A 
COUPLE OF THINGS SHE JUST 
REMINDED ME OF IN HER COMMENTS 
-- NUMBER ONE, TO TAKE CARE OF 
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T ACT 
PROMPTLY LIKE YOU DID, SENATOR 
KLOBUCHAR, THAT IS WHAT WE 
EXTENDED IT AND GIVE THE 
COURTESY OF DOING WHATEVER 
ANYBODY ELSE WANTS, NOW. 
THOSE CAN EITHER BE BROUGHT UP 
NOW OR THOSE THAT YOU'VE GOT 
CAN BE BROUGHT UP RIGHT NOW TO 
HIM AND THE THINGS THAT AREN'T 
CLEAR, THAT YOU WANT TO BRING 
UP WITH THE JUDGE, YOU CAN 
BRING UP IN THE CLOSED SESSION 
TODAY. 
THE OTHER THING IS, WHEN YOU 
TALK ABOUT GETTING ALL THE 
DOCUMENTS, I DON'T KNOW WHO 
MIGHT WORK FOR MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE SOMETIMES TO WANT TO 
BE ON THE SUPREME COURT, AND, 
FOR INSTANCE, WE DIDN'T ASK FOR 
ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT KAGAN 
HAD AND THE EMAILS OR WHATEVER 
COMMUNICATIONS SHE WOULD HAVE 
HAD WHEN SHE WORKED WITH 
SENATOR KENNEDY. 
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO 
THAT SORT OF THING? 
IF YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO BE 
MADE PUBLIC, OR ALL THE EMAILS 
THAT YOU HAVE -- I THINK THEY 
ARE PROTECTED FOR 50 YEARS FOR 
THE U.S. SENATORS. 
SO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW. 
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE UP YOUR 
EMAILS RIGHT NOW AND MAKE THEM 
PUBLIC? 
I DON'T THINK YOU DO. 
SENATOR LEE? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, MR. CHAIRMAN, 
I WANT TO SAY I'M DEEPLY 
SYMPATHETIC TO THE FRUSTRATION 
PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY DON'T 
HAVE ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS THEY 
WANT. 
AS A U.S. SENATOR, I'VE PASTED 
THIS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. 
WE'VE BEEN CALLED UPON TO VOTE 
LITERALLY AT THE MIDNIGHT HOUR 
OR LATER AND WE HADN'T SEEN THE 
IT WAS VOTED ON. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TIMES, I KID YOU 
NOT, WHEN I'VE BEEN ASKED TO 
VOTE ON LEGISLATION THAT HAS AN 
ANNEX AND I'M TOLD I CAN'T SEE 
THE ANNEX BECAUSE IT'S 
CLASSIFIED AND CLASSIFIED IN A 
WAY I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO 
BECAUSE OF A COMMITTEE 
ASSIGNMENT THAT I DO NOT HAVE. 
IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. 
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE LOOK 
FOR A DEMON. 
THERE ARE DEMONS IN THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY ARE TOO 
NUMEROUS TO NAME HERE. 
IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, THERE IS 
A DEMON BUT THAT DEMON IS A LAW 
OF OUR OWN CREATION. 
CALLED THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS 
ACT. 
THAT'S THE DEMON THAT YOU ARE 
AFTER HERE AND THE ONLY REASON 
WE'VE GOT THIS ISSUE. 
NOW, THE CUSTODIAN OF THOSE 
DOCUMENTS HOLDS AND EXERCISES A 
PRIVILEGE ON BEHALF OF THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THESE ARE DOCUMENTS WE WOULD 
OTHERWISE NOT HAVE ACCESS TO 
BECAUSE THEY ARE PRIVILEGED. 
PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT TO THE 
SENATE AND AN ACCOMMODATION TO 
THE SENATE, THE CUSTODIAN HAS 
AGREED, NOTWITHSTANDING THE 
NATURE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS, TO 
HAND THEM OVER TO US WITH THE 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN THERE 
WAS A NEED THAT ARISES WITH 
RESPECT TO ONE OF THOSE 
DOCUMENTS TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC, 
WE CAN, AS A COMMITTEE, GO 
THROUGH THE PROCESS TO DO THAT 
AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT 
HAS WORKED AND IT'S WORKED HERE 
TODAY. 
IF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED WITH THE 
DOCUMENTS, LET'S REVIEW THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. WE ARE
JUST DOING WHAT THE LAW ALLOWS 
US TO DO. 
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE NOT OURS. 
THEY BELONG TO SOMEONE ELSE. 
IT IS NOT WRITTEN INTO THE 
CONSTITUTION AND IT IS NOT 
WRITTEN ON STONE TABLETS 
ANYWHERE THAT WE ARE ENTITLED TO
DOCUMENTS THAT DON'T BELONG TO 
US. 
IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT WILLIAM 
HOWARD TAFT ISN'T RELEASE HIS 
PRESIDENTIAL PAPERS AND IT'S 
SIGNIFICANT THAT ROBERT 
JACKSON, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, 
DIDN'T SOLVE -- DIDN'T SHOW THE 
PAPERS HE HAD. 
I ASSUME IT HAD A LOT TO DO 
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T 
BELONG TO US, AS THE SENATE. 
IF WE WANT TO PROCESS WITH THIS 
ADMINISTRATION AND EVERY 
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION, 
DEMOCRATIC OR REPUBLICAN OR ANY 
OTHER STRIPE IN THE FUTURE, WE 
NEED TO RESPECT THE PROCESS AND 
RESPECT THE PRIVILEGE THAT IS 
ACCORDED TO DOCUMENTS THAT DO 
NOT BELONG TO US. 
THAT'S ALL WE ARE ASKING AND 
THE PROCESS IS WORKING. 
LET'S MOVE FORWARD. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
ON BEHALF OF THIS SIDE, I WOULD 
LIKE TO SAY COUPLE OF THINGS. 
THERE IS NO PROCESS FOR THE 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 
IT USED TO BE THAT BOTH SIDES 
HAD TO CONCUR. THE CHAIR AND 
THE RANKING MEMBER. 
NOW, THIS IS JUST SIMPLY NOT 
THE CASE. TO SOME EXTENT, WITH 
THIS KIND OF THING, COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL BECOMES A KIND OF 
A CROCK AND IT SHOULDN'T. 
I THINK WE NEED TO SIT DOWN. 
WE NEED TO HAVE A RULE ON HOW 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL IS 
DETERMINED, ON WHAT IT MEANS 
AND WHO MAKES THAT DECISION. 
FOR ALL I KNOW, SOME REPUBLICAN 
STAFFER COULD HAVE MADE THE 
DECISION. 
I JUST DON'T KNOW. 
DOCUMENTS APPEAR AND OUR SITE 
HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO 
WITH THE DESIGNATION OF 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL. 
IT BECOMES A WAY, IF THERE IS NO
RULE, FOR THE MAJORITY TO, 
ESSENTIALLY, PUT ALL 
INFORMATION THROUGH A STRAINER. 
SHOULD WE LET THIS GO OUT AND 
BE PUBLIC, OR SHOULD WE NOT? 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT THIS 
COMMITTEE IS ABOUT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> YOU KNOW, IN THE ABSENCE OF 
A MAJORITY OF A COMMITTEE 
OPPOSED, THE CHAIRMAN ACTS ON 
BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE AND 
CHAIRMAN LEAHY ACCEPTED 
DOCUMENTS ON A COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL BASIS DURING 
JUSTICE KAGAN'S NOMINATION AND 
THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT THE 
RANKING MEMBER AGREED TO THAT, 
AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. 
SENATOR 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
TWO QUICK POINTS, IF IT COULD. 
THE QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED, 
WHOSE DOCUMENTS ARE THESE? 
THESE ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S 
DOCUMENTS. 
THEY ACT FOR RECORDS GIVES US 
THE ACT OF RETAINING THEM AFTER 
THE REVIEW OF PROFESSIONALS AT 
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND BILL 
BURKE IS NOT A PROFESSIONAL AT 
THE ARCHIVES. 
THE ARCHIVES HAVE SAID IT'S NOT 
THEIR PROCESS. 
EQUALLY AND IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE
SOME WILL MAKE DIRE PREDICTIONS 
ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE RELEASE 
OF THESE DOCUMENTS, BILL BURKE, 
HIMSELF, IN HIS LETTER TO US ON 
AUGUST 31 SAID -- I QUOTE -- 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT 
WHICH PROTECTS AGAINST THE 
DISCLOSURE OF CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION, DID NOT APPLY TO 
ANY DOCUMENTS OUR TEAM 
REVIEWED. I 
AGREE WITH SENATOR BOOKER. 
THIS CONFIRMATION IS TOO 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONCEAL 
DOCUMENTS THAT MAY REVEAL THE 
NOMINEE'S VIEWS AND I THINK WE 
SHOULD BE PROCEEDING UNDER 
THESE GROUNDS. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
MAY I BE RECOGNIZED, SIR? 
>> I HOPE YOU DON'T SAY THE 
SAME THING AGAIN. 
>> SIR, I WILL NOT. 
I WILL SAY SOMETHING I HAVEN'T 
SAID. I 
APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE YOU'VE 
BEEN SHOWING AND I ALSO WANT TO 
SAY THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS 
FROM SENATOR KENNEDY AND 
SENATOR LEE WERE RIGHT ON 
POINT, THEY STOOD STRONG LAST 
NIGHT AND CHALLENGED ME. 
THEY NOT ONLY WERE COLLEGIAL 
BUT THEY LOOKED TO FIND A FAIR 
WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROCESS 
AND I WANT TO EXPRESS MY 
APPRECIATION. 
I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING 
THAT I'VE SAID BEFORE. 
THERE IS NO SENATE RULE THAT 
ACCOUNTS FOR THIS PROCESS, 
PERIOD. 
THIS IS NOT A SENATE RULE. 
I DID NOT VIOLATE A CENTER -- A 
SENATE RULE. I 
WILL PAUSE. 
THERE IS NO SENATE RULE THAT 
ARE VIOLATED BECAUSE THERE IS 
NO SENATE RULE THAT ACCOUNTS 
FOR THIS PROCESS. 
I SAY TO A CHAIRMAN THAT I 
RESPECT AND I BELIEVE HAS BEEN 
FAIR AND GOOD TO ME, I WILL SAY 
THAT I DID WILLINGLY VIOLATE THE
CHAIR'S RULE ON THE COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS. I 
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
VIOLATING THAT, SIR. 
I VIOLATED IT BECAUSE I 
SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE 
PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW THIS 
NOMINEE'S RECORD. 
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, HIS 
RECORD ON ISSUES OF RACE AND 
THE LAW AND I COULD NOT 
UNDERSTAND AND I VIOLATED THIS 
RULE KNOWINGLY, WHY THESE 
ISSUES SHOULD BE WITHHELD FROM 
THE PUBLIC. 
NOW, I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS 
OF MY COLLEAGUES. 
IT'S ABOUT THE CLOSEST I WILL 
PROBABLY EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE 
TO A SPARTACUS MOMENT. 
MY COLLEAGUES, NUMBERS OF THEM, 
SAID THEY EXPECT -- ACCEPT THE 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
THERE WERE SERIOUS CHARGES MADE 
AGAINST ME BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM 
TEXAS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY 
WERE POLITICAL BLUSTER OR 
SINCERE FEELINGS. 
IF WHAT HE SAID WAS CONSIDER, 
THEIR ACTUALLY ARE SENATE RULES 
GOVERNING THE BEHAVIOR OF 
SENATORS. 
IF HE FEELS THAT I AND MY 
FELLOW COLLEAGUES WHO ARE WITH 
ME HAVE VIOLATED THOSE RULES, 
THAT HE IS NOT A TEMPEST IN A 
TEAPOT BUT SINCERELY BELIEVES 
THAT, THEN BRING THE CHARGES. 
GO THROUGH THE SENATE PROCESS 
TO TAKE ON SOMEBODY THAT YOU 
SAID IS UNBECOMING TO BE A 
SENATOR. 
LET'S GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS 
BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC 
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE 
MOMENT SOMEBODY IS UP FOR A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, THAT THIS 
ISSUE, DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE A 
RIGHT TO KNOW? 
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS ACT OR A VIOLATION OF 
THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. 
IT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF SENATE 
RULES BUT IF SOMEBODY WILL LAND 
THOSE CHARGES, I HOPE THAT THEY 
WILL FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ME AND 
SENATOR DURBIN, SENATOR SENATOR 
WHITE HOUSE AND SENATOR HER ONO 
AND SENATOR BLUMENTHAL AND NOW 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
I HOPE THEY WILL BRING CHARGES 
AGAINST US AND I'M READY TO 
ACCEPT THE FULL RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE, THE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT I HAVE 
DONE AND I STAND BY THE 
PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO HAVE ACCESS 
TO THIS DOCUMENT AND KNOW THIS 
NOMINEE'S VIEWS ON ISSUES ARE 
PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT, LIKE RACE 
AND THE LAW, TORTURE AND OTHER 
ISSUES. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MAY I READ THE 
SENATE RULE 295, THE STANDING 
RULES OF THE SENATE FOR THE 
BENEFIT OF ALL SENATORS? 
AND A SENATOR, OFFICER OR 
EMPLOYEE OF THE SENATE WHO 
SHALL DISCLOSE THE SECRET OR 
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS OR 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE SENATE, 
INCLUDING THE BUSINESS AND 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEES, 
SUBCOMMITTEES AND OFFICES OF 
THE SENATE SHALL BE LIABLE IF A 
SENATOR SUFFERS EXPULSION FROM 
THE BODY AND IF AN OFFICER OR 
EMPLOYEE, DISMISSAL FROM THE 
SERVICE OF THE SENATE AND 
PUNISHMENT OR CONTEMPT. 
I WOULD CORRECT THE SENATOR'S 
STATEMENT THERE IS NO RULE. 
THERE CLEARLY IS A RULE THAT 
APPLIES. 
>> APPLY THE RULE AND BRING THE 
CHARGES. 
>> ALL OF US ARE READY TO FACE 
THAT RULE ON THE BOGUS 
DESIGNATION OF COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
JUST BECAUSE, THERE IS A SENATE 
RULE, DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN BE 
MISAPPLIED OR MISCONSTRUED OR 
MISUSED. 
I THINK EVEN THE THREAT RAISED 
BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE IS 
UNFORTUNATE AND THAT IS A KIND 
WAY OF PUTTING IT WITH ALL DUE 
RESPECT. 
I WOULD JUST MAKE ONE OTHER 
POINT. 
WE ARE DEALING WITH A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT. 
NOTHING WE DO HERE IS MORE 
SERIOUS THAN CONFIRMING A 
JUSTICE ON THE U.S. SUPREME 
COURT. 
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE HERE IN 
THE MOST SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY 
WE HAVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 
WE NEED THE FULL TRUTH, JUST AS 
THIS NOMINEE IS SWORN, TO GIVE 
IT TO US. 
WE ARE ENTITLED TO IT FROM OUR 
COLLEAGUES IN THE QUESTION IS, 
WHAT ARE THEY CONCEALING BY 
THIS PROCEDURE? 
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SEE AND 
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID WE WOULD 
ASK OF THIS NOMINEE IF WE HAD 
ALL OF THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT 
HAVE BEEN DENIED US IN THIS 
SHAM AND CHARADE? 
>> SENATOR LEE AND THEN SENATOR 
TILLIS. 
>> THE DOCUMENT YOU ARE TALKING 
ABOUT HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED 
THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESSES 
AND MADE PUBLIC. 
THE PROCESS WORKED AND I 
PLEDGED TO WORK WITH EACH AND 
EVERY ONE OF YOU. 
IF YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT, AS TO 
WHICH A PRIVILEGE HAS BEEN 
ASSERTED SUCH THAT IT IS NOT 
PUBLIC, YET, I WILL WORK WITH 
YOU TO TRY TO MAKE A PUBLIC. 
LET'S DO IT. 
I THINK WE CAN DO THIS. 
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND WE 
HAVE DONE THIS AT LEAST THREE 
TIMES, NOW. 
WE CAN DO IT MORE. 
THE PRIVILEGE THING IS REAL, 
THOUGH. 
IT'S NOT OUR PRIVILEGE WE ARE 
DEALING WITH. 
IT'S A PRIVILEGE THAT BELONGS 
TO SOMEONE ELSE. 
THE PRIVILEGED NATURE OF 
DOCUMENTS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A 
LONG TIME, SINCE THE EARLY DAYS 
OF THE REPUBLIC. 
THE RECORDS AND NOTES TO THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WERE 
ORDERED SEALED FOR 30 YEARS 
AFTER THE CONVENTION IN 1787. 
I'M NOT SURE OF THE REASONS WHY 
BUT THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED 
DECIDED THE RULE. 
SEALED FOR 30 YEARS AND THOSE 
DOCUMENTS DIDN'T BELONG TO 
ANYONE ELSE. 
THEY BELONGED TO THOSE THAT 
CONTENT -- TO THOSE THAT 
ATTENDED THE CONVENTION AND 
PARTICIPATED IN IT. 
THERE WERE TWO, OLIVER 
ELLSWORTH AND JAMES WILSON, WHO 
WERE SUBSEQUENTLY NOMINATED TO 
SERVE ON THE U.S. SUPREME 
COURT. 
NO ONE DEMANDED, TO MY 
KNOWLEDGE AND NO ONE COULD HAVE 
GOTTEN -- NOTWITHSTANDING THE 
THIRTY-YEAR SEAL AGREEMENT -- 
THE NOTES TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
CONVENTION, EVEN THOUGH THOSE 
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PROBATIVE AS TO HOW THOSE 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SERVED ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
NO ONE ACCUSED THE U.S. SENATE 
OF BEING A RUBBERSTAMP FOR THE 
WASHINGTON ADMINISTRATION OR 
ANYONE ELSE. 
IN 1795, THE U.S. SENATE 
DISAPPROVED OF AT LEAST ONE OF 
PRESIDENT WASHINGTON'S SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEES. 
THIS WAS NOT A RUBBERSTAMP. 
THE RESPECT OF THE FACT THAT 
THEY DIDN'T OWN EVERY DOCUMENT 
AND THAT OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT OWN 
THEM. 
WE DON'T OWN THESE AND WE HAVE 
TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS, 
PROCESS ORDAINED BY A LAW THAT 
WE PASSED AND THAT ONLY WE HAVE 
THE POWER TO CHANGE. 
LET'S FOLLOW THAT LAW. 
WE CAN FOLLOW THE LAW AND 
RESPECT THE PROCESS AND THE 
RIGHTS OF EACH OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES AND THE RIGHTS OF 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO REVIEW 
DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT
HERE. 
LET'S GO THROUGH THE 
APPROPRIATE PROCESS TO DO IT. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
>> I THINK I OUGHT TO BE FAIR 
TO THE REPUBLICAN. 
>> I THINK WE SHOULD, TOO. 
>> SENATOR TILLIS? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I TOOK NEARLY 17 
YEARS TO GET MY COLLEGE DEGREE. 
I WENT TO FIVE DIFFERENT 
INSTITUTIONS THAT I'M PRETTY 
SURE NONE HAVE BEEN ELEVATED TO 
THE IVY LEAGUE. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
I DON'T EVER PLAN ON RUNNING 
FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 OR ANY 
POINT IN THE FUTURE. I 
WANT TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT 
AND ONE REQUEST. 
THE COMMENT, AS I HOPE 
EVERYBODY WILL RECORD A 
TRANSCRIPT OF WHAT IS GOING ON 
RIGHT NOW. 
SENATOR LEE EXPLAINS THINGS, I 
THINK, AND ELOQUENT LEGAL TERMS 
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF MAKING THIS AN 
UN-TRUSTED BODY TO RECEIVE 
DOCUMENTS UNDER THE 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. 
YOU MAY RUE THE DAY THAT YOU DO 
THAT BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY WILL 
GET FEWER DOCUMENTS IN THE 
FUTURE. 
NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO, 
IS ASK ALL OF OUR MEMBERS, 
PERHAPS WE CAN ACTUALLY 
DEMONSTRATE TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO 
EXPOSE OUR OWN RECORDS. I 
WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF THE SCOTUS 
NOMINATION THAT ALL OF US WAIVE 
ANY RIGHT TO THE SPEECH AND 
DEBATE CLAUSE AND THAT WE ALLOW 
ALL OF OUR EMAIL RECORDS 
RELATED TO THIS SCOTUS 
NOMINATION TO BE MADE PUBLIC ON 
AN IMMEDIATE BASIS. 
I, FOR ONE, AND READY TO SIGN 
UP FOR IT NOW AND I HOPE THE 
OTHER MEMBERS WILL DO THE SAME 
THING. 
IN THE INTEREST OF 
TRANSPARENCY, CERTAINLY, IT 
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR EVERYONE 
OF US. 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE WANT TO 
DO IN THE FUTURE, TO EXPOSE 
THAT INFORMATION TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
>> ARE YOU DONE? 
I WILL START WITH MY 
QUESTIONING. 
BY THE WAY, WE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO -- SO EVERYBODY GETS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE FBI 
AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO 
ASK -- AT 1:00, WE GO INTO 
EXECUTIVE SESSION AND GET THAT 
DONE BEFORE, IF THE SENATE DOES 
CLOSE DOWN AT 2:00. I 
MEAN, IF THEY DON'T GIVE US 
PERMISSION TO MEET AFTER 2:00. 
WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT OUT OF THE
WAY AND WE WILL DO THAT AT 
1:00. 
>> MAY I JUST -- 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, DID YOU YIELD 
A QUESTION ABOUT PROCEDURE? 
>> I USED THE WRONG WORD, 
CLOSED. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- CLOSED 
INSTEAD OF EXECUTIVE SESSION. 
>> WOULD YOU YIELD TO A 
QUESTION ABOUT PROCEDURE, MR. 
CHAIRMAN? 
>> GO AHEAD. 
>> YOU EXPLAINED WHY WE ARE 
HAVING TO TRUNCATE THE HEARING 
TODAY? 
>> I'M NOT SURE WE DO HAVE TO 
TRUNCATE IT. 
JUST IN CASE, IT WOULD BE 
BECAUSE THE MINORITY MAY OBJECT 
TO THE UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
REQUEST. 
THE LEADER WOULD MAKE IT FOR 
THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO 
WORK WHILE THE SENATE IS IN 
SESSION. 
>> LET ME BE SURE I UNDERSTAND. 
SENATOR SCHUMER IS SAYING THAT 
WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN WHILE THE 
SENATE IS IN SESSION? 
DO WE NOT GENERALLY WAIVE THAT 
RULE? 
>> YES. 
GENERALLY, IT IS WAIVED. 
IF SUBJECTED TO IT, WE CAN'T 
MEET. 
THAT MEANS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE 
URE THAT WE GET THE EXECUTI 
-- THE CLOSED SESSION OUT OF 
THE WAY. 
>> MAY I ASK WHY SENATOR 
SCHUMER IS DOING THAT? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
>> WE HAVE A NOMINEE TO THE 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT 
TRANSPARENCY. 
WHAT IS HIS BASIS FOR DOING 
THAT? 
>> YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM. I 
DON'T KNOW. 
>> IF I MAY, I WOULD JUST LIKE 
TO PUT A DOCUMENT IN THE RECORD 
THAT THE COMMITTEE WAS TOLD 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
DECIDED TO WITHHOLD 102 PAGES 
OF KAVANAUGH'S WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL RECORDS. 
102,000. 
WHAT DID I SAY? 
>> THANK YOU. 
102,000 PAGES OF KAVANAUGH'S 
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL RECORDS AND 
ASSERTED A NEW CLAIM OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE. 
OF COURSE, THAT HASN'T BEEN 
DONE BEFORE AND I'M TOLD THERE 
IS NO SUCH PRIVILEGE. 
THERE IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, 
OUTLINED IN PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS
AND REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT TO 
NOTIFY CONGRESS AND THE 
ARCHIVIST, WHICH WAS NOT DONE 
HERE. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT 
MORE TO IT BUT I'D LIKE TO PUT 
THAT IN THE RECORD. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, THAT WILL 
BE PUT IN THE RECORD. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WE'VE HEARD A 
LOT YESTERDAY ABOUT YOUR RECORD 
OF INDEPENDENCE AND 
IMPARTIALITY. 
YOU'VE DONE MORE THAN TALK 
ABOUT YOUR INDEPENDENCE AND 
IMPARTIALITY, YOU'VE 
DEMONSTRATED JUDICIAL VALUES OF 
THE BENCH BY MY ACCOUNT, YOU 
RULED AGAINST EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
AGENCIES 23 TIMES BETWEEN MAY 
2006, JANUARY 2009. 
OF COURSE, PRESIDENT BUSH WAS 
NOMINATED -- WHO NOMINATED YOU 
TO THE BENCH, WAS THE HEAD OF 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
YOU HAD NO PROBLEMS RULING 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT WHO 
APPOINTED YOU. 
IF THAT'S WHAT THE LAW ARE 
REQUIRED. I 
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WOULD DO 
THE SAME ON THE SUPREME COURT 
IF THAT'S WHAT THE LAW 
REQUIRED. 
YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED 
IMPARTIALITY. 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TRIED TO 
DEPICT YOU AS HOSTILE TO THE 
LITTLE GUY AND ALWAYS WILLING 
TO RULE FOR THE POWERFUL. 
YOUR RECORD SHOWS THAT YOU RULE 
FOR THE PARTY THAT HAS THE LAW 
ON THEIR SIDE. 
SO, THAT MAKES YOU OUT TO BE NOT
A PRO PLAINTIFF JUDGE OR PRO-
DEFENDANT JUDGE. 
BUT, TO BE A PRO LAW JUDGE. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A FEW OF 
YOUR CASES THAT I THINK 
DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU WILL 
VINDICATE THE RIGHTS OF THOSE 
WHO ARE LESS POWERFUL IN OUR 
SOCIETY. 
AFTER ALL OUR ASPIRATIONS AS 
AMERICANS, IT'S EQUAL JUSTICE. 
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 
>> SHAME! SHAME! 
>> SO, I WILL ASK YOU ON EACH 
ONE OF THEM, BUT JUST SO YOU 
KNOW, THE THREE CASES I'M 
THINKING ABOUT HIS RUE ZELLO, 
ESSEX INSURANCE AND UNITED FOOD 
AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. 
IN THE FIRST ONE, THE CASE IN 
WHICH YOU RULED FOR THE WOMEN 
WRONGFULLY DENIED SOCIAL 
SECURITY BENEFITS, TELL US YOUR 
APPROACH TO THAT CASE? 
>> THIS CASE, MR. CHAIRMAN, WAS 
A CASE IN WHICH THE SOCIAL 
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION HAD 
DENIED BENEFITS. 
>> THERE IS A CASE WHERE THE 
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
DENIED BENEFITS TO A WOMAN WHO 
HAD THE HISTORY OF MENTAL 
ILLNESS AND THEY DID SO BECAUSE 
AT ONE POINT IN TIME, SHE HAD 
BEEN EMPLOYED FOR A BRIEF 
PERIOD OF TIME WITH A FAMILY 
MEMBER BUT IT HAD BEEN 
SUBSIDIZED. 
IN MY VIEW, THIS WAS THE HEIGHT 
OF ARBITRARY DECISION-MAKING. 
THE CASE HAD GONE ON FOR 15 
YEARS, IT WAS A HALL OF MIRRORS 
FOR THE WOMAN AND I WROTE AN 
OPINION REVERSING THE DENIAL OF 
BENEFITS FOR THE WOMAN AND ALSO 
MAKING CLEAR TO THE SOCIAL 
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION THAT 
ANY FURTHER DELAY WOULD NOT BE 
TOLERATED AND THAT THESE KINDS 
OF DELAYS IN DENYING BENEFITS 
WITH PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS 
WERE UNACCEPTABLE. 
>> 'S -- 
>> LET'S GO WITH THE ESSEX 
INSURANCE COMPANY. 
IN THE ESSEX CASE, IT WAS THE 
CASE OF A CHILD, FAMILY AND AN 
INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE CHILD 
HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL 
ABUSE ON THREE OCCASIONS AND 
THE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS 
TRYING TO PAY OUT SIMPLY 
$100,000 FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER 
FOR THE ABUSE. 
AND THE INSURANCE POLICY SAID 
$100,000 FOR EACH OCCURRENCE, 
IN ESSENCE. 
WE RULED THAT THE INSURANCE 
COMPANY HAD TO PAY $100,000 FOR 
EACH OCCURRENCE, EACH INCIDENT 
OF THE ABUSE AND THEREFORE, A 
TOTAL OF $300,000. 
IN THAT CASE, THE RULES, FOR 
THE VICTIM OF ABUSE AGAINST THE 
INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS 
SEEKING TO SQUEEZE THE BENEFITS 
THAT WERE PAID UNDER A POLICY 
THAT WAS OWED TO THE PLAINTIFF 
IN THE CASE. 
>> THE UNITED FOOD AND 
COMMERCIAL WORKERS? 
>> THAT IS THE UNION CASE 
AGAINST WALMART AND THE CASE 
CAME FROM THE NLRB IN THE CASE 
WAS WHETHER WALMART HAD ENGAGED 
IN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES 
AGAINST A UNION, IN THAT CASE 
AND IN THAT CASE, WE RULED FOR 
THE UNION AGAINST WALMART IN 
THAT CASE, ON THE GROUND THAT 
THE FACTUAL RECORD SUPPORTED 
THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMPANY 
HAD ENGAGED IN UNFAIR LABOR 
PRACTICES AND THEREFORE 
VIOLATED THE RIGHTS OF THE 
UNION MEMBERS. 
>> NOW, TO SOMETHING I BELIEVED 
I'VE DISCUSSED WITH EVERY 
NOMINEE TO THE SUPREME COURT 
PROBABLY FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. 
IT'S NOT ABOUT A CASE OR YOUR 
APPROACH TO THE LAW AND IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR KENNEDY 
TALKED TO YOU ABOUT YESTERDAY. 
IT ISN'T A VERY POPULAR SUBJECT 
WITH SOME OF THE CURRENT AND 
FORMER JUSTICES. 
I THINK I MAKE CHIEF JUSTICE 
ROBERTS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN I 
AISE THIS ISSUE WHEN I SPEA 
WITH THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE 
AND THERE WAS WHEN JUSTICE 
SOUTER WAS ON THE SUPREME 
COURT, HE MADE A FAMOUS QUIP 
ABOUT TELEVISION CAMERAS THAT 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ROLL OVER 
HIS DEAD BODY. 
I COULD RESPECT THAT VIEW. 
I THINK IT'S PLAIN WRONG. 
I AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES 
BELIEVE THAT ALLOWING CAMERAS 
IN THEIR COURT WOULD ALLOW 
COURTS TO THE PUBLIC AND BRING 
ABOUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE COURT AND ITS WORK. 
YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT FOR A 
NUMBER OF YEARS, I'VE SPONSORED 
A BILL, THE SUNSHINE IN THE 
COURTROOM ACT WHICH GIVES 
JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO ALLOW 
MEDIA COVERAGE OF FEDERAL COURT 
PROCEEDINGS. 
WOULD YOU KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON 
CAMERAS IN THE COURTROOM, OR IF 
YOU HAVE STRONGLY HELD VIEWS ON 
IT? 
DON'T BE AFRAID TO TELL ME. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I APPRECIATE 
YOUR LONG-STANDING INTEREST IN 
THE ISSUE AND TRANSPARENCY 
WHERE THE COURTS, OF COURSE. 
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE DONE 
ON MY COURT, BRIEFLY AND THEN 
TELL YOU SOME GENERAL THOUGHTS, 
GOING FORWARD, IF I WOULD BE 
CONFIRMED. 
ON OUR COURT, WE'VE GONE FROM 
AUDIO RELEASE AT SOME DATE MUCH 
LATER AND THEN WE WENT TO AUDIO 
RELEASE THE SAME WEEK AND THEN 
WE WENT TO AUDIO RELEASE THE 
SAME DAY AND NOW, WE ARE 
ALLOWING AUDIO TO GO OUT LIVE 
WITH THE ORAL ARGUMENTS. 
THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN ONE IN 
WHICH THE JUDGES HAVE LEARNED 
EXPERIENCE WITH ADDITIONAL 
TRANSPARENCY WITH AUDIO OVER 
TIME. 
THAT PROCESS HAS WORKED WELL IN 
OUR COURT. 
THE SUPREME COURT, THE BEST 
APPROACH FOR ME IS TO LISTEN TO 
THE VIEWS OF PEOPLE LIKE 
YOURSELF, MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN 
THAT, TO LEARN, IF I WERE TO BE 
CONFIRMED FROM THE EXPERIENCE 
THEY ARE AND THE EXPERIENCE 
THAT IS LIKE. 
TO BE PART OF A TEAM, I'D WANT 
 
JUSTICES WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT 
THIS. 
SEVERAL, AS YOU KNOW WELL, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, WHEN THEY ARE IN MY 
SEAT, THEY EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR 
ORAL ARGUMENTS AND WHEN THEY 
WERE THERE FOR A FEW YEARS, 
SWITCHED AFTER EXPERIENCING IT. 
I'D WANT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT 
THAT. 
AS I SAID TO SENATOR KENNEDY, 
I'D WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORAL 
ARGUMENT AND THE ACTUAL 
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE DECISIONS. 
THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS 
AND THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH 
FOCUS ON THE POSSIBILITY OF 
LIVE AUDIO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
DECISION ANNOUNCEMENTS OR VIDEO 
OF THE DECISION ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
I'D BE INTERESTED IN THINKING 
ABOUT THAT IN TALKING TO MY 
COLLEAGUES IF I WERE CONFIRMED. 
I'D HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND I DO 
THINK WHEN YOU ATTEND AN ORAL 
ARGUMENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT 
AS I HAVE MANY TIMES OR ATTEND 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DECISIONS, 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPRESSIVE 
TO WALK INTO THAT BUILDING AND 
THE MAJESTY OF THAT BUILDING, 
THE BUILDING, ITSELF, CONVEYS 
THE STABILITY AND MAJESTY OF 
THE LAW. 
AND, TO GO INTO THE COURTROOM 
AND TO SEE THE JUSTICES WORKING 
TOGETHER AS THEY RESOLVE CASES, 
IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY 
IMPRESSIVE. 
TO SEE THEM IN ACTION, I DO 
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OF VIEW 
ON THIS AND I WOULD CERTAINLY 
KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON IT AND 
LISTEN TO YOU AND LISTEN TO THE 
OTHER JUSTICES ON THE COURT, OF 
COURSE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO ROE. 
BECAUSE, MOST OF US LOOK AT YOU 
AS THE DECIDING VOTE. 
I ASKED YESTERDAY IF YOUR VIEWS 
ON ROE HAVE CHANGED SINCE YOU 
WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU SAID SOMETHING TO THE 
EFFECT THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW 
WHAT I MEANT TO. 
WE HAVE AN EMAIL THAT WAS 
PREVIOUSLY MARKED CONFIDENTIAL, 
BUT IS NOW PUBLIC. 
IT SHOWS THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT 
MAKING EDITS TO AN OP-ED THAT 
READ THE FOLLOWING -- AND I 
QUOTE -- FIRST OF ALL, IT IS 
WIDELY UNDERSTOOD, ACCEPTED BY 
LEGAL SCHOLARS ACROSS THE 
BOARD, THAT ROE V. WADE AND ITS 
PROGENY ARE THE SETTLED LAW OF 
THE LAND. YOU RESPONDED BY 
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, I'M NOT 
SURE THAT ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS 
REFER TO ROE AS THE SETTLED LAW 
OF THE LAND AT THE SUPREME 
COURT LEVEL SINCE COURT CAN 
ALWAYS OVERRULE ITS PRECEDENT 
AND THREE CURRENT JUSTICES ON 
THE COURT WOULD DO SO. 
THIS HAS BEEN VIEWED AS YOU 
SAYING THAT YOU DON'T THINK ROE 
IS SETTLED. 
I RECOGNIZE THE WORD SAID IS 
WHAT LEGAL SCHOLARS REFER TO. 
PLEASE, ONCE AGAIN, TELL US WHY 
YOU BELIEVE ROE IS SETTLED LAW. 
IF YOU COULD, DO YOU BELIEVE IT 
IS CORRECTLY SETTLED? 
>> SO, THANK YOU SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN. 
IN THAT DRAFT LETTER, IT WAS 
REFERRING TO THE VIEWS OF LEGAL 
SCHOLARS. 
I THINK MY COMMENT IN THE EMAIL 
IS THAT MIGHT BE OVERSTATING 
THE POSITION OF LEGAL SCHOLARS 
AND IT WASN'T A TECHNICALLY 
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION IN WHAT 
LEGAL SCHOLARS THOUGHT AT THAT 
TIME. I 
BELIEVE CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST 
AND JUSTICE SCALIA WERE STILL 
ON THE COURT, AT THAT TIME. 
THE BROADER POINT WAS SIMPLY 
THAT I THINK IT WAS OVERSTATING 
SOMETHING ABOUT LEGAL SCHOLARS 
AND I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED WITH 
ACCURACY. 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS NOT QUITE 
THE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ALL 
LEGAL SCHOLARS BECAUSE IT 
REFERRED TO ALL. 
TO YOUR BROADER POINT, ROE V. 
WADE IS AN IMPORTANT PRECEDENCE 
OF THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 
HOOD HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED MANY 
TIMES. 
IT WAS REAFFIRMED IN PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY IN 1992 
WHEN THE COURT SPECIFICALLY 
CONSIDERED WHETHER TO REAFFIRM 
IT OR WHETHER TO OVERTURN IT. 
IN THAT CASE, AND GREAT DETAIL, 
THE THREE JUSTICE'S OPINIONS OF 
JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE 
O'CONNOR AND JUSTICE KENNEDY 
WENT THROUGH ALL THE FACTORS, 
ANALYZED THOSE AND DECIDED TO 
REAFFIRM ROLE. 
THAT MAKES KC PRECEDENT ON 
PRECEDENT AND IT'S BEEN RELIED 
ON AND CITED AS AUTHORITY AND 
SUBSEQUENT CASES. 
THAT PRECEDENT IS QUITE 
IMPORTANT AS YOU THINK ABOUT 
STARE DECISIS IN THIS CONTEXT. A
SIMILAR ANALOGY, THE U.S. VERSUS
DICKERSON CASE IN 2000 WHERE 
THE COURT CONSIDERED WHETHER TO 
OVERTURN MIRANDA VERSUS ARIZONA 
OR TO REAFFIRM IT. 
IN THAT CASE, THE COURT THROUGH 
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, 
SPECIFICALLY, REAFFIRMED 
MARANDA DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST HAD 
BEEN A CRITIC OF MIRANDA IN THE 
EARLY DAYS AND HAD WRITTEN SOME 
OPINIONS QUITE CRITICAL OF IT. 
THE DICKERSON CASE IS SIMILARLY 
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT, WHICH 
IS IMPORTANT, GOING FORWARD, AS 
YOU THINK ABOUT THE STARE 
DECISIS CALCULATION FOR A CASE 
LIKE MIRANDA. 
THAT'S WHY BOTH OF THOSE CASES, 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY 
AND DICKERSON ARE CASES THAT I 
REFER TO AS PRESIDENT ON 
PRECEDENT. 
>> SO, YOU BELIEVE IT IS 
CORRECTLY SETTLED, BUT IS IT 
CORRECT LAW IN YOUR VIEW? 
>> SENATOR, ON THAT CASE OR ON 
DICKERSON OR ON CASES LIKE 
CITIZENS UNITED OR U.S. VERSUS 
LOPEZ OR KILO, THE WHOLE BODY 
OF MODERN SUPREME COURT CASE 
LAW, I HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT THE 
NOMINEES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THIS 
SEAT BEFORE HAVE DONE. 
>> JUDGE, A YES OR NO WILL DO. 
>> JUSTIFY COULD BRIEFLY 
EXPLAIN -- 
>> YES, YOU CAN. 
>> A WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. 
WHEN YOU ARE IN THIS SEAT, I'M 
NOT JUST SITTING HERE FOR 
MYSELF, I SIT HERE IS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JUDICIARY 
AND THE OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
JUDICIARY, WHICH I KNOW YOU 
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. 
WHAT I'VE DONE IS STUDY VERY 
CAREFULLY WHAT NOMINEES HAVE 
DONE IN THE PAST. I 
REFER TO IT AS NOMINEE 
PRECEDENT. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG AND ALL THE 
JUSTICES HAVE NOT GIVEN HINTS 
OR FORECASTS OR PREVIEWS. 
JUSTICE KAGAN, I THINK, 
CAPTURED IT WELL, AS SHE OFTEN 
DOES, IN TALKING ABOUT 
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT WHEN YOU 
ARE ASKING. 
YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMBS-UP OR 
THUMBS DOWN AND MAINTAIN THE 
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. 
I NEED TO FOLLOW THAT NOMINEE 
PRECEDENT HERE. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, CAN I ASK THAT 
THE EMAIL ISSUE BE MADE PART OF 
THE RECORD? 
>> PARDON ME? 
>> I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT THE 
EMAIL AT ISSUE BE MADE PART OF 
THE RECORD. 
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. 
THANK YOU. 
DURING HER TIME IN THE BUSH 
WHITE HOUSE, THE ADMINISTRATION 
ACTIVELY TOOK STEPS TO LIMIT 
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES 
INCLUDING REIMPOSING THE GLOBAL 
GAG RULE TO PREVENT FOREIGN 
ORGANIZATIONS FROM SPENDING 
THEIR OWN MONEY ON REPRODUCTIVE 
HEALTH AND TRYING TO PREVENT 
THE FDA FROM MAKING PLAN B 
CONTRACEPTION AVAILABLE OVER-
THE-COUNTER. 
DURING YOUR SERVICE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, 2001-2006, DID YOU 
WORK ON ANY ISSUES RELATED TO 
WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OR 
CHOICE? 
>> PRESIDENT BUSH WAS A PRO-
LIFE PRESIDENT. 'S POLICY WAS 
PRO-LIFE AND THOSE WHO WORKED 
FOR HIM, THEREFORE, HAD TO 
ASSIST HIM, OF COURSE, WHEN 
PURSUING THOSE POLICIES, 
REGULATORY, PARTIAL-BIRTH 
LEGISLATOR'S ELATION THAT WAS 
PASSED. 
SOME OF THOSE THINGS MIGHT HAVE 
CROSSED MY DESK. 
I CAN'T REMEMBER SPECIFICS. 
I THINK THIS CAME UP IN JUSTICE 
KAGAN, WHEN SHE WORKED FOR 
PRESIDENT CLINTON, HE HAD A 
DIFFERENT VIEW THAN PRESIDENT 
BUSH ON THAT ISSUE AND SHE HAD 
SOME WORK FOR PRESIDENT 
CLINTON. 
I CONSIDER MYSELF WORKING FOR 
PRESIDENT BUSH, I WAS THERE TO 
ASSIST HIM. 
>> LET ME GO TO TORTURE. 
DURING THE TIME YOU WORKED IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE, THE OFFICE OF 
LEGAL COUNSEL CONCLUDED THAT 
HARSH INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES 
WERE ILLEGAL, EVEN THOUGH 
CONGRESS HAD PASSED A LAW IN 
1994 BANNING TORTURE. 
THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL 
TOOK A SWEEPING VIEW OF 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER AND CONCLUDED
THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD 
OVERRIDE THE STATUTE. 
IN RESPONSE, IN 2005, CONGRESS 
ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT CHAMPIONED 
BY OUR COLLEAGUE, SENATOR 
McCAIN. I 
WAS A COSPONSOR. 
IT STATED THAT ONLY 
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES THAT 
CAN BE USED ARE THOSE 
AUTHORIZED IN THE ARMY FIELD 
MANUAL. 
WAS THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL 
CORRECT WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT 
THE PRESIDENT COULD IGNORE THE 
TORTURE BAN? 
>> THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, 
SENATOR, SUBSEQUENTLY WITHDREW 
THOSE MEMOS, AS YOU KNOW. 
AS I'VE MADE CLEAR IN SOME OF 
MY WRITINGS, THE REVIEW OF 
JUDGE DAVID BEHRENS' BOOK, SOME 
OF MY OPINIONS, AS WELL, THE 
PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO DISREGARD STATUTES 
PASSED BY CONGRESS REGULATING 
THE WAR EFFORT EXCEPT IN 
CERTAIN VERY NARROWLY DESCRIBED 
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE 
HISTORICALLY ROOTED. 
THE COMMON EXAMPLE BEING 
úCOMMA 
AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE
LAW. 
THE PRESIDENT IS SUBJECT TO THE 
LAW INCLUDING IN THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY CONTEXT. 
THAT IS THE LESSON, I THINK, OF 
THE YOUNGSTOWN STEELCASE, OF 
JUSTICE JACKSON'S CATEGORIES. 
CATEGORY 3 AS I'VE SAID IN MY 
WRITINGS, CONGRESS PROHIBITED 
THE PRESIDENT FROM DOING 
SOMETHING, IT'S CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE RULE 
OF LAW, AS JUSTICE JACKSON 
SAID. 
THAT IS THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE 
COUNTRY, IT'S AT STAKE AND 
CATEGORY 3. I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT 
THAT QUITE FREQUENTLY. 
>> GOT IT. 
THANK YOU. 
TODAY, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO 
SAID HE COULD AUTHORIZE WORSE 
THAN WATERBOARDING. 
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 
COMMENT AND DON'T THINK I CAN, 
SITTING HERE, ON CURRENT 
EVENTS. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS. 
YOU'VE MADE THAT CLEAR. 
>> I KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS, 
SENATOR. 
>> I'VE ASKED SPECIFICALLY HOW 
YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT. 
>> I FEEL THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW 
THE LAW, AS A JUDGE. I 
KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS AND I KNOW 
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE, 
BOTH WITH THE REPORT YOU DID -- 
IT WAS THE THOROUGH 
DOCUMENTATION OF THINGS THAT 
HAPPENED -- AS WELL, 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE 
AND I KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP WAS 
SENATOR McCAIN ON THE 2005 ACT, 
AS WELL. 
I KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS AND I'VE 
WRITTEN ABOUT HOW THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS WORKS WHEN 
CONGRESS PASSES LAWS OF THE 
KIND THAT YOU HAVE. 
>> ONE LAST QUESTION ON THIS. 
IN DECEMBER OF 2005, PRESIDENT 
BUSH ISSUED A SIGNING STATEMENT 
REGARDING THE DETAINEE 
TREATMENT ACT OF 2005, 
RESERVING THE PRESIDENT'S RIGHT 
TO DISREGARD THAT THE LAWS BAN 
ON TORTURE -- DISREGARD THE BAN 
ON TORTURE IF IT INTERFERED 
WITH HIS CONSTITUTIONAL 
AUTHORITIES AS PRESIDENT. 
WHAT WAS YOUR INVOLVEMENT, IF 
ANY, WITH THIS SIGNING 
STATEMENT? 
>> I WAS STAFF SECRETARY, AND 
ANY ISSUE THAT REACH THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESK WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF A FEW COVERT 
MATTERS, WOULD HAVE CROSSED MY 
DESK ON THE WAY TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESK. 
I WOULDN'T HAVE PROVIDED THE 
POLICY ADVICE OR THE LEGAL 
ADVICE, BUT WHAT IT WOULD HAVE 
CROSSED MY DESK. 
IN THAT CASE, THE SIGNING 
STATEMENT, THE DRAFTS OF IT, 
THAT PROCESS WOULD HAVE CROSSED 
MY DESK, AT SOME POINT. 
>> OKAY. 
IN A 2013 PANEL DISCUSSION, YOU 
DID NOTHING ABOUT IT, THOUGH -- 
IT CROSSED YOUR DESK AND THAT 
WAS THAT. 
>> WELL, THERE WAS DEBATE, AS I 
THINK I'VE MENTIONED, ABOUT 
THAT. 
THE COUNCIL TO THE PRESIDENT, 
MS. MYERS AT THE TIME, WAS THE 
ULTIMATE ADVISOR ON THAT MATTER 
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND THUS, 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO 
PRIMARILY DEALT WITH THAT WITH 
THE PRESIDENT. 
IT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE JOB I 
HAD, NOT TO SUPPLANT THE POLICY 
OR LEGAL ADVISORS. 
THAT WAS NOT MY JOB. 
MY JOB WAS TO MAKE SURE THE 
PRESIDENT HAD THE BENEFIT OF 
THE VIEWS OF HIS POLICY AND 
LEGAL ADVISORS. 
>> ONE MORE BUSH ERA QUESTION ON
THIS. 
IN A 2000 PANEL DISCUSSION AT 
NYU LAW SCHOOL, REGARDING BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION AND ANTI-
TERRORISM POLICIES, YOU SAID 
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WENT, 
QUOTE, RIGHT UP TO THAT LEGAL 
LINE TO DEFEND THE SECURITY OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
IT IMPLIED THAT BUSH POLICIES 
DID NOT CROSS THE LEGAL LINE. 
DO YOU MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT BUSH
ADMINISTRATION'S POST-9/11 
PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE CIA 
TORTURE PROGRAM, WERE LEGAL? 
>> KNOW, SENATOR. 
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS 
SUGGESTING THERE. 
LET ME TRY TO PROVIDE YOU AN 
EXPLANATION. 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S VIEW, AS HE 
HAS SAID PUBLICLY, WAS IN 
TRYING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, HE 
WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING HE 
COULD WITHIN THE LAW. HE RELIED 
ON HIS LAWYERS TO PROVIDE THE ú 
AND THEN HE WOULD GO UP TO THAT 
LINE AS HE THOUGHT EFFECTIVE, 
AS A MATTER OF POLICY. 
IT WAS UP TO THE LAWYERS, 
THEREFORE, TO MAKE SURE THEY 
WERE GIVING SOUND ADVICE AND 
HAVING THE BACKBONE. 
THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR 
LEGISLATION REINFORCES. 
LAWYERS NEED TO HAVE BACKBONE 
EVEN IN PRESSURIZED MOMENTS TO 
SAY NO. 
I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT MANY 
TIMES. 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN 
úEXECUTI 
PASSIONS OF THE MOMENT WHEN THE 
PRESSURE IS ON OR IF THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO 
SOMETHING, PERHAPS, IS TO GO 
INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAY 
NO. 
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS. 
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE WRITTEN 
ABOUT, TALKED ABOUT AND 
EXPERIENCED IN MY TIME WITH 
PRESIDENT BUSH AND I'VE 
ENCOURAGED YOUNG LAWYERS TO 
HAVE THAT BACKBONE AND 
FORTITUDE TO SAY NO. 
THAT'S ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING. 
>> THANK YOU. 
A QUICK CHANGE OF SUBJECT. 
YOU SAT ON A CASE WHERE A 
TRAINER, WAS KILLED WITH 
INTERACTING WITH A KILLER WHALE 
DURING A LIVE PERFORMANCE. 
FOLLOWING HER DEATH, THE 
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 
ADMINISTRATION FOUND THAT 
SEAWORLD HAD VIOLATED WORKFORCE 
SAFETY LAWS. 
THE MAJORITY AGREED WITH THE 
AGENCY THAT SEAWORLD HAD 
VIOLATED THE LAW AND ACCORDING 
TO WHAT I KNOW, YOU DISAGREED. 
IN YOUR DISSENT, YOU ARGUED 
THAT THE AGENCY LACKED THE 
AUTHORITY TO REGULATE EMPLOYER 
TO PROTECT PARTICIPANTS IN 
SPORTING EVENTS OR ENTERTAINMENT
SHOWS. 
HOWEVER, THE STATUTE, AS 
ENACTED, APPLIES TO EACH 
EMPLOYER AND IT DEFINED 
EMPLOYER AS ANYONE ENGAGED IN 
BUSINESS AFFECTING COMMERCE WHO 
HAS EMPLOYEES. 
WE ARE IN THE TEXT OF THE LAW 
DID CONGRESS EXEMPT EMPLOYERS 
FROM ANIMAL TRAINERS? 
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. 
THAT DID NOT INVOLVE POTENTIAL 
CONVERSATION FOR THE FAMILY IT 
WAS HANDLED THROUGH THE STATE 
OR THEATER -- THROUGH INSURANCE 
OR A SETTLEMENT WITH SEAWORLD 
AND THE FAMILIES. 
THE CASE BEFORE US HAD NOTHING 
TO DO WITH COMPENSATION OF THE 
FAMILY, AND HAD TO DO A 
SEPARATE REGULATION OF 
SEAWORLD. 
THE ISSUE, SENATOR, WAS 
PRESIDENT. I 
FOLLOW PRECEDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE LABOR 
DEPARTMENT, AS I READ IT, WAS 
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT UNDER THIS 
STATUTE WOULD NOT REGULATE WHAT 
IT CALLED THE INTRINSIC 
QUALITIES OF A SPORTS OR 
ENTERTAINMENT SHOW. 
LOTS OF SPORTS AND 
ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS HAVE 
SERIOUS DANGERS, WHETHER 
FOOTBALL OR THE BALANCE BEAM IN 
GYMNASTICS OR THE HIGHWAY OR 
ACT AT THE CIRCUS OR THE LION 
TAMER SHOW. 
THE SEAWORLD SHOW WAS, AS I SAW 
IT, WITHIN THAT PRECEDENT, IT 
SAID THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WOULD 
NOT REGULATE REGULATE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, WHETHER BASEBALL 
HELMETS HAD TO HAVE EAR FLAPS 
OR WHETHER TO PROHIBIT THE PUNT 
RETURN OR TO MAKE THE BALANCE 
BEAM HAVE NUTS. 
THIS SEEMS TO BE COVERED BY 
THAT PRECEDENT, AS I SAW IT. 
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT AND THE 
ORAL ARGUMENTS TRIED TO 
DISTINGUISH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
DANGERS OF FOOTBALL FROM THE 
DANGERS OF THE SEAWORLD SHOW 
AND I DID NOT, AS I EXPLAINED 
IN THE OPINION, FIND THAT 
PERSUASIVE'S. I 
DID MAKE CLEAR TWO THINGS. 
ONE, CONGRESS COULD, OF COURSE, 
REGULATE THE INTRINSIC DECISION 
TO REGULATE THE QUALITIES OF 
SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT SHOWS. 
OR, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT COULD 
CHANGE PRECEDENT. 
AND, I MADE CLEAR THAT STATE 
TORT LAW, AS THE NFL EXPERIENCE 
WITH THE CONCUSSION ISSUE, STATE
TORT LAW ALWAYS EXISTS AS A WAY 
TO ENSURE OR HELP ENSURE SAFETY 
IN THINGS LIKE THE SEAWORLD 
SHOW. 
>>> YOU HAVE OBJECTED TO THIS 
LIMIT ON THE PRESIDENT'S POWER 
AND STRUCK DOWN FOR THE FOR 
CAUSE REQUIREMENT IN A CASE 
INVOLVING THE CONSUMER 
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. 
THE DC CIRCUIT DISAGREED AND 
OVERTURNED YOUR DECISION. 
IF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE THE 
HEADS OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES 
FOR ANY REASON, WHAT IS TO 
PREVENT POLITICAL INTERFERENCE 
IN THESE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES? 
>>  SENATOR, I HAVE FOLLOWED 
THE HUMPHREY'S EXECUTIVE. 
THAT IS THE PRECEDENT THAT 
ALLOWS INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AND 
PROTECTS THEM FROM AT WILL 
FIRING. 
AS A GENERAL MATTER, I HAVE 
AFFIRMED, OR FOLLOWED THE 
PRECEDENT OF HUMPHREY'S 
EXECUTOR. 
THE CONGRESS ESTABLISHED A NEW 
INDEPENDENT AGENCY THAT DID NOT 
FOLLOW THE TRADITION MODEL OF 
INDEPENDENT AGENCIES OF HAVING 
MULTIPLE MEMBERS. 
THAT'S ALL I THOUGHT WAS A 
PROBLEMATIC THERE. 
AND I DID NOT INVALIDATE OR DID 
NOT SAY THE AGENCY SHOULD STOP 
OPERATING. 
I SAID THE AGENCY CAN CONTINUE 
PERFORMING ITS IMPORTANCE 
FUNCTIONS ON BEHALF OF 
CONSUMERS, BUT EITHER IT HAD TO 
BE RESTRUCTURED AS A 
MULTIMEMBER AGENCY OR THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO BE ABLE TO 
REMOVE THE SINGLE HEAD AT WILL. 
>>  THE LIMITED SET OF 
DOCUMENTS WE'VE RECEIVED 
INDICATES THAT YOU WERE HEAVILY 
INVOLVED IN THE BUSH WHITE 
HOUSE'S RESPONSE TO 
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS 
AFTER THE ENRON SCANDAL. 
IS THAT ACCURATE? 
>>  THAT IS ACCURATE. 
WE HAD A DOCUMENT FROM SENATOR 
LIEBERMAN'S COMMITTEE. 
I WAS A LEADER THAT HAD TO HELP 
GATHER THE DOCUMENTS FROM 
PEOPLE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND NEGOTIATE DOCUMENTS. 
I HAD TO NEGOTIATE DOCUMENTS 
WITH SENATOR LIEBERMAN'S STAFF. 
>>  RIGHT. 
SO YOU KNOW THAT ENRON WAS ONE 
OF THE GREATEST CORPORATE 
SCANDALS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
I CAN TELL YOU AS A SENATOR 
FROM CALIFORNIA, NOT ONLY DID 
MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS LOSE 
EVERYTHING FINANCIALLY WHEN 
ENRON COLLAPSED UNDER THE 
WEIGHT OF ITS ACCOUNTING FRAUD, 
BUT THE FRAUD AND MARKET 
MANIPULATION CONTRIBUTED TO AN 
ENERGY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. 
WHITE HOUSE E-MAILS SHOW THAT 
YOU WERE ASKED TO REVIEW A SET 
OF DRAFT TALKING POINTS FOR 
PRESS SECRETARY, FLIESHER, THAT 
ADDRESS THE ROLE OF 
MANIPULATION IN THE CALIFORNIA 
ENERGY CRISIS. 
ESSENTIALLY, THE TALKING POINT 
SAID IF THERE WAS ANY 
MISCONDUCT BY ENRON, IT WAS UP 
TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY 
REGULATORY COMMISSION TO 
INVESTIGATE AND PUNISH THE 
COMPANY. 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU IF YOU 
REMEMBER THE SPECIFIC DOCUMENT, 
BUT WAS THAT YOUR VIEW THAT THE 
REGULATORY BODY THAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO STOP THIS SORT OF 
MISCONDUCT? 
>>  I'M NOT RECALLING THE 
SPECIFICS ON THAT. 
SENATOR, MY ROLE AS A GENERAL 
MATTER WAS TO HELP GATHER 
DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO 
SENATOR LIEBERMAN'S REQUEST, AS 
I RECALL. 
AND I KNOW FERK WOULD HAVE A 
ROLE. 
I DON'T THINK THAT WAS MY AREA 
OF EXPERTISE. 
I'M NOT RECALLING IT 
SPECIFICALLY, SENATOR. 
>>  THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>>  APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU 
CONDUCTED THESE HEARINGS, 
INSPITE OF THESE IRRESPONSIBLE 
OUTBURSTS. 
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I WOULD LIKE 
TO COMMEND YOU FOR HOW YOU 
PRESENTED YOURSELF. 
YOU DISPLAYED THE LEVEL 
HEADEDNESS THAT SO MANY OF YOUR 
FRIENDS TELL US EXIST. 
I WOULD SAY YOUR FRIENDS OF 
FOREIGN COLLEAGUES DESCRIBED IN 
THEIR LETTERS TO THIS 
COMMITTEE, I WISH YOU COULD SAY 
THE SAME ABOUT EVERYONE WHO 
ATTENDED THIS HEARING OR 
COVERED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 
BUT I CAN'T. 
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE THEE 
YOURS TRULY TEATRICS WE HAVE 
SEEN. 
I'M THE FORMER CHAIRMAN. 
NEVER HAVE I SEEN THE CONSTANT 
INTERRUPTIONS WE WITNESS AT 
THIS HEARING. 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HEAR 
FROM THE NOMINEE. 
UNFORTUNATELY, IT SEEMS THAT 
SOME ON THE POLITICAL LEFT 
DECIDED TO TRY TO TURN THIS 
HEARING INTO A CIRCUS. 
NOW I WORRY ABOUT THE PRECEDENT 
THIS IS SETTING FOR FUTURE 
CONFIRMATIONS. 
THAT'S NOT THE WORST. 
NOW THE WORST OF IT ARE THE 
ATTACKS AGAINST PEOPLE WHO 
AREN'T EVEN UP FOR 
CONFIRMATION. 
WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE HERE IN 
THE ROOM TO SUPPORT THE 
NOMINEE. 
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATIONS HAVE TURNED 
INTO ALL OUT WAR AGAINST THE 
NOMINEE. 
HAVE WE REALLY REACHED A POINT 
WHERE ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS OR 
EVEN SITS BEHIND A NOMINEE MUST 
ALSO BE DESTROYED? 
HAVE WE REACHED THAT LOW? 
TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN 
UNFAIRLY CAUGHT UP IN THE MOB 
MENTALITY, I WANT TO SAY, YOUR 
RIGHT TO BE HERE. 
SUPPORTING SOMEONE YOU BELIEVE 
IN. 
DON'T LET THE FACT THAT THERE 
ARE A LOT OF FRANKLY, SICK 
PEOPLE OUT THERE, CAUSE YOU TO 
LOSE FAITH IN OUR POLITICAL 
PROCESS. 
WE NEED GOOD, DECENT PEOPLE TO 
STEP FORWARD, TO CONTRIBUTE. 
EVEN WHEN IT'S UGLY. 
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S UGLY. 
NOW TO MY QUESTIONS. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
AS I DID YESTERDAY, I WOULD 
LIKE TO ASK YOU TO KEEP YOUR 
ANSWERS CONCISE, SO WE CAN GET 
THROUGH AS MANY AS WE CAN. 
LATE LAST NIGHT, ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES ASKED YOU A SERIES 
OF OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT 
ANY CONVERSATIONS YOU HAVE HAD 
WITH ANYONE AT A 350 PERSON LAW 
FIRM ABOUT SPECIAL COUNCIL, BOB 
MUELLER, OR HIS INVESTIGATION. 
YOU SAID YOU DO NOT REMEMBER 
HAVING HAD ANY SUCH 
CONVERSATIONS. 
MY COLLEAGUE DID NOT CLARIFY 
WHY MY COLLEAGUE WAS ASKING THE 
QUESTIONS AND DID NOT ALLOW YOU 
TO COMPLETE YOUR ANSWERS. 
I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 
RESPOND, IF YOU'D LIKE TO. 
>>  SENATOR, I DON'T RECALL ANY 
CONVERSATIONS OF THAT KIND WITH 
ANYONE AT THAT LAW FIRM. 
I DIDN'T KNOW EVERYONE WHO 
MIGHT WORK AT THAT LAW FIRM. 
BUT I DON'T RECALL ANY 
CONVERSATIONS OF THAT KIND. 
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY INAPPROPRIATE 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT 
INVESTIGATION WITH ANYONE. 
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN ANYONE ANY 
HINTS, FORECASTS, PREVIEWS, 
WINKS, NOTHING ABOUT MY VIEW AS 
A JUDGE OR HOW I WOULD RULE AS 
A JUDGE ON THAT OR ANYTHING 
RELATED TO THAT. 
SO, I THANK YOU FOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY AND 
REASSURE YOU ON THAT. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
WITH ALL OF THE ACCUSATIONS AND 
INSINUATIONS YESTERDAY, THERE 
IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO COME 
CLEAN ABOUT. 
I'M ON THE BOARD OF VISITORS TO 
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY. 
IT'S TRUE. 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR 
WITH THE FEDERAL SOCIETY, 
GENERALLY HOLDS DEBATES AND 
PUTS TOGETHER PANELS ON LEGAL 
ISSUES COVERING ALL SIDES OF 
THESE ISSUES. 
THE LIBERAL, THE CONSERVATIVE, 
ETCETERA. 
IT'S A VERY RESPONSIBLE 
ORGANIZATION. 
THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION 
SOCIETY, THE DEMOCRATIC 
ORGANIZATION DOES MUCH THE SAME 
THING. 
I RESPECT THEM. 
EXCEPT IT FOCUSES ON LIBERAL OR 
PROGRESSIVE LAWYERS. 
SO, THIS IS FAMILIAR TO MY 
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH 
ACS FROM KEYNOTING THE ANNUAL 
CONFERENCE TO BEING AN HONORARY 
HOST COMMITTEE CHAIR. 
FOR SPEAKING ON PANELS, TO 
WRITING BLOG ENTRIES FOR THE 
ORGANIZATION. 
I EVEN HEARD A NASTY RUMOR THAT 
ONE SPOKE AT A FEDERAL SOCIETY. 
WHEN IT CAME TO YOUR 
NOMINATION, YOU SPOKE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, 
AND THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL, 
NOT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. 
I DON'T NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
THAT. 
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS. 
WHAT HAS YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH 
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY BEEN? 
>>  SENATOR, THANK YOU. 
THE FEDERAL SOCIETY AS YOU 
NOTE, PROVIDES -- HOLDS DEBATES 
AT LAW SCHOOLS. 
>>  ON BOTH SIDES. 
>>  ON BOTH SIDES. 
THE TYPICAL PROGRAM OF A 
FEDERAL SOCIETY EVENT AT A LAW 
SCHOOL WILL HAVE TWO SPEAKERS 
AND A MODERATOR THAT IS TYPICAL 
WITH THE TWO SPEAKERS 
PRESENTING DIFFERENT VIEWS ON 
AN ISSUE. 
IT COULD BE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
FOURTH AMENDMENT PRIVACY, WHERE 
YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS A 
DIFFERENT VIEW ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY RELATED FOURTH 
AMENDMENT ISSUES OR ON FREE 
SPEECH ISSUES. 
ALL SORTS OF LEGAL ISSUES. 
THEY TRY TO HAVE DEBATES WHERE 
BOTH SIDES ARE PRESENTED AT THE 
LAW SCHOOL EVENTS THAT I'VE 
BEEN TO. 
AT THE CONVENTIONS, THEY WILL 
ALWAYS HAVE PANELS OF FOUR OR 
FIVE WITH A MODERATOR. 
THEY'LL HAVE A SPECTRUM OF 
VIEWS REPRESENTED ON A 
DIFFERENT TOPIC. 
THEY ARE VERY ENRICHING IN 
TERMS OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE 
LAW. 
AND THEY ARE ALSO ENRICHING, I 
BELIEVE, IN TERMS OF PROVIDING 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THE 
LAW AND THEY WELCOME PEOPLE AND 
ACTUALLY INSIST ON HAVING 
PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVES AT THE EVENT. 
SO, IT IS VERY BENEFICIAL TO 
THE LAW, I THINK. 
THE PROGRAMS THEY HAVE AT THE 
LAW SCHOOLS, THEY ARE VERY 
EDUCATIONAL. 
THEY PROVIDE SOME OF THE BEST 
DEBATES THAT ARE HELD AT THE 
LAW SCHOOLS, I BELIEVE. 
SO I THINK THE ORGANIZATION, 
WHICH ITSELF DOES NOT LOBBY AND 
DOES NOT FILE BRIEFS OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
DOES A VERY VALUABLE SERVICE AT 
LAW SCHOOLS IN THE LEGAL 
COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE FOR 
BRINGING TOGETHER DIFFERENT 
VIEWS ON IMPORTANT LEGAL ISSUES 
AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR THEIR 
EFFORTS TO BRING SPEAKERS TO 
CAMPUS AND PROVIDE LEGAL 
DEBATES ON CAMPUS AND IN 
LAWYERS CONVENTIONS. 
>>  YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IT QUITE 
WELL. 
ORAL ARGUMENT IN MICROSOFT 
VERSUS UNITED STATES, ALSO 
KNOWN AS THE MICROSOFT IRELAND 
CASE. 
NATURALLY, I WAS VERY 
INTERESTED IN THAT. 
AT ISSUE IN THE CASE WAS THE 
MEANING OF THE STORED 
COMMUNICATIONS ACT, AND WHETHER 
A WARRANT FOR DATA STORED 
OVERSEAS BUT ACCESSIBLE IN THE 
UNITED STATES FALLS WITHIN THE 
CONFINES. 
I HAD INTRODUCED LEGISLATION 
KNOWN AS THE CLOUD ACT, TO 
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. 
FOLLOWING ORAL ARGUMENT, 
CONGRESS PASSED THE CLOUD ACT, 
MUTING THE CASE BEFORE THE 
COURT. 
NOW THE SPECIFIC QUESTION AT 
ISSUE IN THE MICROSOFT, IRELAND 
CASE, HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY MY 
LEGISLATION. 
BUT THE CASE ALSO RAISED A 
BROADER QUESTION THAT I WOULD 
LIKE TO ASK YOU. 
WHEN THE STORED COMMUNICATIONS 
ACT WAS PASSED IN 1986, NO ONE 
IMAGINED A WORLD WHERE DATA 
COULD BE STORED OVERSEAS, BUT 
ACCESSIBLE  INSTANTANEOUSLY IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
IT WAS CLEAR THE DATA STORED IN 
THE UNITED STATES. 
BUT IT WAS LESS CLEAR THAT IT 
EXTENDED   TO DATA STORED 
ABROAD, USING TECHNOLOGIES NOT 
AVAILABLE IN 1986. 
HOW DO WE INTERPRET OUR LAWS IN 
LIGHT OF CHANGING TECHNOLOGY? 
HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE 
AUTHORS AND ENACTORS OF 
LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE INTENDED 
THE LEGISLATION TO COVER NEW  
TECHNOLOGIES IN UNFORESEEN 
SITUATIONS? 
>>  THERE, AS ELSEWHERE, THE 
JOB OF A JUDGE IS TO FOCUS ON 
THE WORDS WRITTEN IN THE 
STATUTE PASSED BY CONGRESS. 
SOMETIMES CONGRESS WILL WRITE A 
STATUTE WHERE THE WORDS ARE 
VERY PRECISE AND QUITE CLEAR. 
IT COVERS ONLY SOMETHING THAT 
MIGHT BE IN EXISTENCE AT THE 
TIME. 
SOMETIMES CONGRESS WILL WRITE 
BROADER WORDS AS DOES THE 
CONSTITUTION AT TIMES THAT CAN 
APPLY TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES, FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE FOURTH AMENDMENT, 
OF COURSE, IN THE CONSTITUTION 
APPLIES TO THINGS THAT WERE NOT 
KNOWN AT THE FOUNDING, 
INCLUDING CARS AND 
COMMUNICATION DEVICES THAT WERE 
NOT KNOWN AT THE FOUNDING. 
SO TOO WITH STATUTES. 
IT DEPENDS ON HOW BROADLY OR 
NARROWLY YOU HAVE WRITTEN IT. 
IT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION. 
THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY AND 
LIBERTY ON THE ONE HAND VERSUS 
SECURITY, LAW ENFORCEMENT ON 
THE OTHER IS AN ENORMOUS ISSUE 
GOING FORWARD FOR THE CONGRESS 
IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, I 
BELIEVE, AND ALSO FOR THE 
FEDERAL COURTS, INCLUDING THE 
SUPREME COURT GOING FORWARD. 
THE CARPENTER CASE IS A GOOD 
EXAMPLE, WRITTEN BY CHIEF 
JUSTICE ROBERTS. 
AS I LOOK AHEAD OVER THE NEXT 
10 TO 20 YEARS, THAT BALANCE OF 
FOURTH AMENDMENT, LIBERTY AND 
PRIVACY VERSUS SECURITY AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT IS AN ENORMOUS 
ISSUE. 
>>  I APPRECIATE THAT. 
ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT, THERE'S 
BEEN DEBATE FOR SOME TIME NOW 
IN CONGRESS ABOUT WHETHER OUR 
LAWS SHOULD BE UPDATED. 
TO REQUIRE A WARRANT FOR THE 
CONTENT OF ELECTRONIC 
COMMUNICATIONS REGARDLESS OF 
HOW OLD THOSE COMMUNICATIONS 
ARE. 
AS YOU MAY KNOW, THE ELECTRONIC 
COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT 
CURRENTLY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN 
COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE LESS 
THAN 180 DAYS OLD AND THOSE 
THAT ARE MORE THAN 180 DAYS 
OLD, REQUIRING A WARRANT FOR 
THE FORMER. 
BUT NOT THE LADDER. 
CAN YOU SPEAK GENERALLY TO THE 
IMPORTANCE OF WARRANT 
REQUIREMENTS OF WHY THEY ARE AN 
IMPORTANT WORK AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT OVERREACH. 
>>  THE WARRANT REQUIREMENT 
HELPS ENSURE, AS A GENERAL 
MATTER, THAT THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH IS NOT UNILATERALLY ABLE 
TO INVADE SOMEONE'S PRIVACY, 
SOMEONE'S LIBERTY WITHOUT 
JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT THAT ENSURES 
THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE OR 
WHATEVER THE STANDARD MIGHT BE 
IN A STATUTORY SITUATION TO GET 
SOMEONE'S RECORDS OR 
INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE INVADE 
THEIR LIBERTY OR PRIVACY. 
THAT JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT IS PART 
OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES OF 
THE CONSTITUTION AND CONGRESS 
HAS WRITTEN THAT ALSO INTO 
SEVERAL STATUTES, AS YOU KNOW, 
SENATOR. 
>>  I WANT TO RETURN TO THE E-
MAIL SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS 
ASKING YOU ABOUT. 
YOU WERE ASKED FOR YOUR 
COMMENTS ON AN AD THAT WAS 
GOING TO BE PUBLISHED BY PRO 
CHOICE WOMEN IN REGARDS TO THE 
NOMINEE. 
YOU SAID, QUOTE, I AM NOT SURE 
ALL LEGAL SCHOLARS REFER TO ROE 
AS THE SETTLED LAW OF THE LAND 
AT THE SUPREME COURT LEVEL. 
SINCE COURT CAN ALWAYS OVERRULE 
ITS PRECEDENT, END QUOTE. 
YOU ALSO ADDED, THE POINT THERE 
IS IN THE INFERIOR COURT POINT, 
UNQUOTE. 
WERE YOU GIVING YOUR OPINION ON 
ROE THERE OR WERE YOU TALKING 
ABOUT WHAT LAW SCHOLARS MIGHT 
SAY? 
>>  I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT 
LEGAL SCHOLARS MIGHT SAY. 
>>  OKAY, SO WE GOT THAT 
CLEARED UP. 
YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL ABOUT 
SENTENCING DEFENDANTS BASED ON 
UNCHARGED OR ACQUITTED CONDUCT. 
WITH REGARD TO ACQUITTED 
CONDUCT IN PARTICULAR, I AGREE 
THAT THE NOTION THAT A JUDGE 
CAN SENTENCE A DEFENDANT TO A 
LONG PRISON TERM FOR A CRIME 
THAT A JURY ACQUITTED THE 
DEFENDANT OF IMPLIES IN THE 
FACE OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY 
TRIAL. 
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT YOU 
BELIEVE, QUOTE, IT LIKELY WILL 
TAKE SOME COMBINATION OF 
CONGRESS AND THE SENTENCING 
COMMISSION TO SYSTEMATICALLY 
CHANGE FEDERAL SENTENCING TO 
PRECLUDE USE OF AN ACQUITTED OR 
UNCHARGED CONDUCT, UNQUOTE. 
WHY DO YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH THE 
USE OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT AT 
SENTENCING AND WHY DO YOU 
BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT 
WILL LIKELY REQUIRE 
INTERVENTION BY CONGRESS TO 
RESOLVE? 
>>  THE OPINIONS I'VE WRITTEN 
ON THIS, AND I'VE WRITTEN 
SEVERAL, IN ESSENCE THE 
FOLLOWING, SENATOR. 
WHEN A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY IS CHARGED 
WITH TEN COUNTS, LET'S SUPPOSE, 
AND ACQUITTED ON NINE AND 
CONVICTED ON ONE. 
AND THEN THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT 
IS SENTENCED AS IF HE OR SHE 
HAD BEEN CONVICT OF ALL TEN. 
BECAUSE THE JUDGE JUST SAYS 
WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU 
DID X OR Y AND UNDER MY 
DISCRETION, WHEN YOU HAVE UNDER 
THE SUPREME COURT'S CASE LAW 
FOR SENTENCING, I'M GOING TO 
SENTENCE YOU THE SAME ANYWAY. 
DEFENDANTS AND THE PUBLIC, THE 
FAMILIES OF THE DEFENDANTS 
UNDERSTANDABLY SAY THAT SEEMS 
UNFAIR. 
I THOUGHT THE POINT OF THE JURY 
TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER 
I WAS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY ON 
ALL THOSE CHARGES. 
IF I'M GETTING SENTENCED AS IF 
I WERE GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES, 
IT SEEMS A VIOLATION OF DREW 
PROCESS. 
I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 
FAIRNESS AND PERCEIVED FAIRNESS 
OF THE USE OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT 
AT SENTENCING. 
JUDGE MOLETT AND I HAVE WRITTEN 
ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES AND MADE 
CLEAR OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE USE 
OF ACQUITTED CONDUCT AND HOW IT 
AFFECTS THE SENTENCING SYSTEM. 
WHY I'VE SAID CONGRESS MIGHT 
NEED TO LOOK AT IT, ALTHOUGH I 
ALSO POINTED OUT INDIVIDUAL 
DISTRICT JUDGES CAN LOOK AT IT, 
IS BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT 
SYSTEM, SENTENCING JUDGES HAVE 
WIDE DISCRETION IN PICKING 
SENTENCES. 
IT'S HARD FOR AN APPEALS COURT 
TO SAY THAT YOU INFRINGED YOUR 
DISCRETION. 
I DON'T LIKE THE PRACTICE AND I 
MADE THAT CLEAR IN MY OPINION. 
I'M REPEATING MY OPINIONS HERE, 
BECAUSE OF THE UNFAIRNESS AND 
PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS OF IT. 
>>  OKAY. 
THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN CHASING 
AN ELUSIVE DEAL ON CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE REFORM FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME NOW. 
ONE PARTICULAR FOCUS OF LINE IN 
THIS AREA HAS BEEN MEN'S RAYA 
REFORM. 
WITHOUT PROTECTIONS, THAT IS 
WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT A 
PERSON KNOW HIS CONDUCT WAS 
WRONG OR UNLAWFUL. 
EVERY DAY CITIZENS CAN BE HELD 
CRIMINALLY LIABLE FOR A CONDUCT 
THAT NO REASONABLE PERSON WOULD 
KNOW WAS WRONG. 
CRITICS IN MY LEGISLATIVE 
EFFORTS TO BRING CLARITY CLAIM 
THE EFFORT IS A PLOY TO GET 
CORPORATIONS AND WHITE COLLAR 
DEFENDANTS OFF THE HOOK. 
BUT STRONGER MEN'S RAYA 
REQUIREMENTS PROTECT THE 
LIBERTY OF ALL DEFENDANTS IN 
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE 
NOT CORPORATIONS OR WHITE 
COLLAR DEFENDANTS. 
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF REQUIREMENTS, 
INCLUDING IN CASES INVOLVING 
UNSYMPATHETIC DEFENDANTS LIKE 
AN ARMED ROBBER OR A CONVICTED 
MURDER. 
WHY IN YOUR VIEW ARE 
REQUIREMENTS SO IMPORTANT? 
>>  REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPORTANT, 
BUT BECAUSE UNDER THE DUE 
PROCESS CLAUSE AND THE 
PRECEDENCE OF THE SUPREME 
COURT, IT IS NOT RIGHT TO 
CONVICT SOMEONE BASED ON A FACT 
THEY DID NOT KNOW. 
IT'S JUST AN ELEMENTAL POINT OF 
DUE PROCESS. 
JUSTICE JACKSON DESCRIBED THIS. 
IT SAYS ELEMENTARY, AS HE SAID, 
IS THE SCHOOL CHILD'S, I DIDN'T 
MEAN TO. 
I DIDN'T KNOW. 
AND IF SOMEONE TRULY DIDN'T 
KNOW A FACT THAT IS RELEVANT TO 
THEIR CONVICTION TO NONETHELESS 
CONVICT THEM, IS CONTRARY TO 
DUE PROCESS. 
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE WAS 
ELEVATED FROM 10 YEARS TO 30 
YEARS. 
30 YEAR MANDATORY MINIMUM BASED 
ON A FACT THAT THE DEFENDANT 
DID NOT KNOW. 
I DECENTED IN THAT CASE, AND 
JOINED BY JUDGE TATAL, WHO IS 
AN APPOINTEE OF PRESIDENT 
CLINTON TO OUR COURT, SAYING -- 
I WROTE A LENGTHY -- THAT WAS 
NOT A SYMPATHETIC DEFENDANT, 
GIVEN WHAT HE HAD BEEN 
CONVICTED OF. 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLETE 
VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS AND 
PRINCIPLES THAT WERE LONG 
STANDING TO GIVE HIM A 30 YEAR 
MANDATORY MINIMUM FOR A FACT HE 
DID NOT KNOW. 
I HAVE ALSO WROTE, OR JOINED AN 
OPINION AND WROTE A SEPARATE 
OPINION REVERSING A MURDER 
CONVICTION OF SOMEONE WHERE THE 
JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE UNCLEAR 
ABOUT THE MENTAL STATE OF THE 
MURDER. 
IT WAS A QUESTION OF 
MANSLAUGHTER VERSUS 2nd DEGREE 
MURDER. 
THAT WOULD HAVE A HUGE 
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEFENDANT'S 
SENTENCE. 
AND I WROTE AN OPINION SAYING 
THIS WAS NOT A SYMPATHETIC 
CASE, GIVEN THE FACTS. 
THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE 
FLAWED ON THE ISSUE OF THE 
MENTAL STATE. 
AND MY EXACT LINE WAS, I'M 
UNWILLING TO SWEEP THAT UNDER 
THE RUG AND THAT'S HOW I FELT 
ABOUT THAT CASE. 
THERE WAS A DECENT IN THAT 
CASE. 
BUT I WAS IN THE MAJORITY. 
NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE IN MY 
COURT, IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT 
ARGUMENT ON THE LAW, I'M GOING 
TO RULE IN YOUR FAVOR AND IT'S 
FOUNDATIONAL TO DUE PROCESS. 
I HAVE WRITTEN THAT REPEATEDLY 
AND I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT 
REFORM, SENATOR HATCH. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION. 
SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK THAT 
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT 
WORK IN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY 
SWEAR ALLEGIANCE TO THEIR 
CHURCH, NOT THEIR COUNTRY, 
NECESSARILY. 
I HAVE FAITHLY SERVED OVER 40 
YEARS. 
I BELIEVE I'M A RELIGIOUS 
PERSON. 
NOW RELIGION IS ALSO A BIG PART 
OF YOUR LIFE. 
YOU WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL. 
YOUR CHILDREN GO TO CATHOLIC 
SCHOOL. 
AND YOU REGULARLY ATTEND CHURCH 
AND SERVE AT A CHURCH SUPPORTED 
SOUP KITCHEN. 
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU 
HOW YOUR PRIVATE BELIEFS AFFECT 
YOUR PUBLIC DECISIONS. 
CAN YOU BE DEVOUT IN YOUR FAITH 
AND STILL UPHOLD THE LAW? 
>>  SENATOR, MY RELIGIOUS 
BELIEFS HAVE NO RELEVANCE TO MY 
JUDGING. 
I JUDGE BASED ON THE 
CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
I TAKE AN OATH TO DO THAT. 
FOR 12 YEARS, I LIVED UP TO 
THAT OATH. 
AT THE SAME TIME, OF COURSE, AS 
YOU POINT OUT, I AM RELIGIOUS 
AND I AM A CATHOLIC AND I GREW 
UP ATTENDING CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. 
AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 
UNITED STATES FIRST SAW 
RELIGIOUS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE NOT RELIGIOUS, ARE ALL 
EQUALLY AMERICAN, AS I'VE SAID, 
NO MATTER WHAT RELIGION YOU ARE 
OR NO RELIGION AT ALL, WE'RE 
ALL EQUALLY AMERICAN AND THE 
CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES ALSO SAYS IN ARTICLE 6, 
NO RELIGIOUS TESTS SHALL EVER 
BE REQUIRED AS A QUALIFICATION 
TO ANY OFFICE OR PUBLIC TRUST 
UNDER THE UNITED STATES. 
THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PROVISION 
TO HAVE IN THE FOUNDING 
CONSTITUTION TO ENSURE THAT 
THERE WAS NOT DEDISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAD A 
RELIGION OR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T 
HAVE A RELIGION. 
IT'S A FOUNDATION OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE'RE ALL EQUALLY AMERICAN. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  SENATOR LEAHY. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
AS I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER, 
I HAVE A NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT 
HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE PLACED, 
AS WELL AS E-MAILS AT 3:00 THIS 
MORNING. 
THEY BE PLACED IN RECORD. 
>>  WITHOUT OBJECTION. 
>>  THANK YOU. I KNOW THERE WAS 
CLAIM THIS MORNING THE 
COMMITTEE WAS FOLLOWING MY 
PRECEDENT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, NOT 
SO. 
JUSTICE KAGAN, WE HAD 99% OF 
HER DOCUMENTS AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND OF COURSE, WE DO NOT 
HAVE -- WE HAVE LESS THAN 10% 
OF YOURS. 
THERE WERE 860 DOCUMENTS 
DESIGNATED BY THE NONPARTISAN 
ARCHIVES THAT WAS DISCUSSED 
WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS 
ON THE COMMITTEE. 
NOBODY OBJECTED TO THAT. 
LET'S GO TO OUR QUESTIONS 
YESTERDAY. 
WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 
WHILE YOU WORKED ON NOMINATIONS 
IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE, YOU 
RECEIVED STOLEN MATERIAL FROM A 
REPUBLICAN STAFFER NAMED MANDY 
MIRANDA. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DIGITAL 
WATER GATE. 
HE STOLE 4,670 COMPUTER FILES 
FROM SENATORS. 
HE WAS DOING THIS IN AN EFFORT 
TO CONFIRM PRESIDENT GEORGE W. 
BUSH'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL 
JUDICIAL NOMINEES. 
SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTION 
FIGHTS OF THE DAY, AND THIS 
REPUBLICAN STOLE 4, 670 
COMPUTER FILES. 
IN 2004 AND 2006, YOU TESTIFIED 
A NUMBER OF SENATORS, BOTH 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ASKED 
YOU, YOU SAID YOU NEVER 
RECEIVED ANY STOLEN MATERIALS. 
THAT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE 
ACCURATE. 
YOU ALSO TESTIFIED THAT YOU 
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE SCANDAL 
UNTIL IT WAS PUBLIC AND IF YOU 
HAD SUSPECTED ANYTHING, YOU 
WOULD HAVE REPORTED IT. 
YOU ALSO TESTIFIED TO SENATOR 
HATCH THAT YOU NEVER RECEIVED 
ANY DOCUMENT, EVEN APPEARED TO 
HAVE BEEN DRAFTED OR PREPARED 
BY DEMOCRATIC STAFF. 
I ALSO ASKED YOU YESTERDAY, 
WHETHER MR. MIRANDA ASKED TO 
MEET PRIVATELY OFFSITE TO HAND 
YOU DOCUMENTS RELATED TO 
SENATORS BIDEN AND FEINSTEIN. 
I ALSO ASKED ABOUT SENDING YOU 
QUOTE, INTELL. 
WITH EXTRAORDINARY DETAILED 
SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT I WAS 
GOING TO ASK, A HIGHLY 
CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE JUST DAYS 
LATER. 
SOMETHING I NEVER SAID 
PUBLICLY. 
I ALSO ASKED ABOUT YOU 
RECEIVING A DRAFT IN NONPUBLIC 
LETTER OF MINE, BEFORE ANY 
MENTION IT WAS MADE PUBLIC. 
YOU TESTIFIED YOU DIDN'T RECALL 
ANYTHING SPECIFIC, BUT YOU 
THOUGHT SHARING INFORMATION 
BETWEEN STAFF WAS COMMON. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU WHAT 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE BEEN 
ADVISED TO DO BY OUR STAFF AT 
THIS HEARING? 
>>  I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT 
OF -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT 
INDIVIDUAL SENATORS MIGHT BE 
INTERESTED IN. 
WHEN I MET -- 
>>  I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU 
HAVE TO SAY, JUDGE, PROTESTERS 
-- PLEASE GO AHEAD. 
ANY DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HAVE 
BEEN ADVISED TO DO AT THIS 
HEARING? 
>>  WHEN I MET INDIVIDUALLY 
WITH THE 65 SENATORS, INCLUDING 
ALMOST EVERY MEMBER OF THE 
COMMITTEE, A LOT OF THE 
SENATORS, A LOT OF YOU IN THE 
MEETINGS TOLD ME ISSUES YOU ARE 
INTERESTED IN. 
I THINK YOUR STAFF WAS PROBABLY 
TALKING TO -- 
>>  HAS ANYBODY SAID TO YOU, 
FOR EXAMPLE, SENATOR LEAHY'S 
STAFF IS ASKING HIM TO DO THIS 
AT THE HEARING TOMORROW. 
>>  WELL, I THINK YOU, 
YOURSELF, TOLD ME WHAT YOU WERE 
GOING TO ASK. 
>>  NO, I TRIED TO GIVE YOU A 
GOOD HEAD'S UP. 
I APPRECIATE THE MEETING. 
BUT HAS ANYBODY ELSE TOLD YOU, 
THIS IS WHAT LEAHY'S STAFF IS 
ASKING HIM TO ASK AT THE 
HEARING TOMORROW. 
>>  AGAIN, I THINK THIS MIGHT 
BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESS. 
YOU ALL WERE VERY TRANSPARENT 
WHEN I MET WITH YOU. 
I'M LOOKING AROUND AND SAYING 
HERE'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON AND 
HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK 
YOU AT THE HEARINGS. 
YOU WERE ACCURATELY TELLING ME 
YOUR CONCERNS. 
>>  YOU ARE SAYING THAT'S 
NORMAL. 
ANYBODY HAND YOU ANYTHING 
MARKED HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL 
ABOUT ANY ONE OF THESE 
SENATORS? 
>>  NO. 
NOT REMEMBERING ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT. 
YOU ALL DID TALK ABOUT THE 
ISSUES. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE NO 
SURPRISES. 
YOU KNOW, YOU GAVE ME A BASIC 
CONCERNS AND ISSUES. 
>>  I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE 
CLEAR ON THIS. 
NOBODY HANDED YOU SOMETHING 
MARKED HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
BUT THAT IS MATERIAL YOU 
RECEIVED FROM MIRANDA.
FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 18, 2002, 
DAYS BEFORE AN EXTREMELY 
CONTROVERSIAL HEARING FOR THIS 
SUR CIRCUIT. 
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
ASKING BIDEN NOT TO ATTEND THE 
MEETING THAT DAY. 
ON MARCH 18, 2003, MR. MIRANDA 
SENT YOU SEVERAL PAGES OF 
TALKING POINTS. 
THEY WERE STOLEN VERBATIM. 
STOLEN FROM DEMOCRATIC FILES. 
TALKING POINTS REVEALED 
ARGUMENTS DEMOCRATS WERE MAKING 
ON ANOTHER CONTROVERSIAL 
NOMINEE, MIGUEL ESTRADA. 
THE SUBJECT LINE SAID NOT FOR 
DISTRIBUTION. 
MEANING MR. MIRANDA WAS ASKING 
YOU NOT TO SHARE THE 
INFORMATION. 
THIS HAS NOW BEEN AS OF 3:00 
THIS MORNING, MADE PUBLIC. 
SO YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED YOU 
ABOUT THE SPECIFIC EVENTS, YOU 
SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
RECOLLECTION. 
SO, I'M NOT GOING TO ASK IF YOU 
REMEMBER RECEIVING THIS E-MAIL. 
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THIS. 
WHY WOULD YOU EVER BE ASKED TO 
KEEP A SECRET, DEMOCRATIC 
TALKING POINTS, IF THEY ARE 
LEGITIMATELY OBTAINED? 
>>  I AM LOOKING AT THESE, 
SENATOR, IT SAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT BIDEN STAFF 
IS ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND THE 
HEARING. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY -- 
>>  LOOK HOW YOU RECEIVED IT. 
>>  I KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHY 
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL. 
>>  WHETHER IT IS OR NOT, WOULD 
YOU CONSIDER THAT UNUSUAL TO BE 
RECEIVING FROM A REPUBLICAN 
STAFF MEMBER, SOMETHING MARKED 
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL, TELLING 
WHAT HE HAS FOUND OUT WHAT THE 
DEMOCRAT WILL DO? 
>>  AS I EXPLAINED YESTERDAY, 
SENATOR, MY UNDERSTANDING OF 
THIS PROCESS IS THAT THE STAFF 
DO TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
THEY ARE NOT CAMPS WITH NO 
COMMUNICATION. 
AND THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE WHEN 
I WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE BIDEN STAFF IS 
ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND THE 
HEARING WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY 
STANDARD INFORMATION. 
>>  NOT REALLY. 
YOU READ THIS. 
I WOULD BE AMAZED IF SOMEBODY 
HANDED ME A MEMO SAYING THIS IS 
A CONFIDENTIAL MEMO. 
SENATOR GRASSLEY'S STAFF 
PREPARED FOR HIM. 
I WOULD BE ON THE PHONE 
IMMEDIATELY TO SENATOR GRASSLEY 
SAYING, I'M BRINGING SOMETHING 
OVER THAT JUST ARRIVED TO ME, 
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT. 
YOU RECEIVED, ON JULY 28, 2002, 
AN E-MAIL FROM MIRANDA THAT 
SAID MY STAFF DISTRIBUTED A 
CONFIDENTIAL LETTER TO 
DEMOCRATIC COUNSELORS, NOT TO 
REPUBLICANS. 
MR. MIRANDA SAID, I RECEIVED 
THAT LETTER IN THE STRICTEST 
CONFIDENCE. 
YOU WERE ASKED EXPLICITLY BY 
MR. MIRANDA TO TAKE NO ACTION 
ON THE E-MAIL WITHOUT HIS, HIS 
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 
NEVER ASKED HOW HE OBTAINED THE 
LETTER TO ME. 
AND JULY 30, 2002, YOU RECEIVED 
AN E-MAIL FROM MIRANDA SAYING 
THEY HAD 100% INFORMATION THAT 
I WAS GOING TO BE THE COMMITTEE 
ABOUT A CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE 
AND THEN FURTHER IN AUGUST, E-
MAILING TAKEN FROM MY INTERNAL 
E-MAILS WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO. 
DID ANY OF THIS RAISE A RED 
FLAG IN YOUR MIND? 
>>  IT DID NOT, SENATOR, IT ALL 
SEEMED CONSISTENT WITH THE 
USUAL KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS THAT 
HAPPEN. 
SOMETIMES, PEOPLE DO SAY THINGS 
OF, HERE'S WHAT MY BOSS IS 
THINKING, BUT DON'T SHARE IT 
AROUND. 
I MUST HAVE HAD, YOU KNOW, SO 
MANY CONVERSATIONS IN THE 
COURSE OF MY LIFE LIKE THAT, 
WHERE SOMEONE IS SAYING LIKE 
THAT ABOUT SOMETHING. 
IN OTHER WORDS, TRYING TO GIVE 
YOU A HEAD'S UP ON SOMETHING. 
AND THAT JUST SEEMED STANDARD 
SENATE STAFF. 
SO THE DIRECT ANSWER TO YOUR 
QUESTION IS, FOR EXAMPLE, BIDEN 
-- LOOKS LIKE BIDEN'S STAFF IS 
NOT ASKING HIM NOT TO ATTEND 
THE HEARING. 
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED 
ANYTHING AT ALL FOR ME. 
OTHER THAN -- 
>>  ON JUNE 5, 2003, YOU 
RECEIVED AN E-MAIL FROM 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR STAFFER 
HOSE SUBJECT LINE, SPYING. 
THAT IS NOT OVERLY SUBTLE. 
THIS STAFFER APPEARS IN OVER 
1,000 DOCUMENTS. 
RECEIVED TOGETHER WITH YOU AND 
MR. MIRANDA, SHE HAS A  MOLE 
FOR US, AND SO FORTH. 
NONE OF THIS RAISED A RED FLAG 
WITH YOU? 
>>  IT DID NOT, SENATOR. 
AGAIN, PEOPLE HAVE FRIENDS 
ACROSS THE AISLE WHO THEY TALK 
TO. 
AT LEAST THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE 
BACK THEN. 
MAYBE IT'S CHANGED. 
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF 
BIPARTISANSHIP ON THE 
COMMITTEE. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF 
BIPARTISANSHIP AMONG THE 
STAFFS. 
A LOT OF FRIENDSHIPS AND 
RELATIONSHIPS WHERE PEOPLE 
WOULD TALK TO -- I HAVE A 
FRIEND ON SENATOR KENNEDY'S 
STAFF, OR I HAVE A FRIEND ON 
SENATOR HATCH'S STAFF. 
OR I HAVE A FRIEND ON SENATOR 
SPECTOR'S STAFF. 
SO IT DID NOT RAISE A FLAG. 
>>  JUDGE, I WAS BORN AT NIGHT, 
BUT NOT LAST NIGHT. 
IF I HAD SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE 
SAID, WE STOLEN THIS, OR DON'T 
TELL ANYBODY WE HAVE THIS. 
I THINK IT WOULD RAISE SOME RED 
FLAGS. 
NOW, WE ONLY HAVE A FRACTION OF 
YOUR RECORD. 
I DO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR 
OPENING THESE UP AT 3:00 THIS 
MORNING. 
AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE, THE FIRST 
TIME WE'VE HAD TO FACE THIS ON 
A NOMINEE FROM EITHER 
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 
OF 102,000 PAGES OF MATERIAL. 
102,000, FROM JUST YOUR TIME IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THAT INCLUDES JUDICIAL 
NOMINATIONS. 
CAN YOU CONFIRM FOR ME TODAY 
THAT IN THAT 102,000 PAGES, 
THERE ARE NO E-MAILS FROM MR. 
MIRANDA MARKED HIGHLY 
CONFIDENTIAL OR DO NOT SHARE OR 
TAKE NO ACTION ON THIS, 
DESCRIBING WHAT HE HAS FOUND 
OUT THE DEMOCRATS ARE THINKING. 
>>  SENATOR, I AM NOT INVOLVED 
IN THE DOCUMENTS PROCESS. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THEM. 
>>  THAT IS CONVENIENT. 
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN 
THEM EITHER. 
WE HAVE NEVER HAD SO MUCH 
WITHHELD BEFORE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN ALL 
THE DOCUMENTS. 
THEY ARE STILL BEING GONE 
THROUGH BY THE ARCHIVES. 
BECAUSE THIS IS BEING RUSHED 
THROUGH. 
WE DON'T GET A CHANCE TO SEE 
THEM. 
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO US, AND 
FRANKLY, JUDGE, IT'S NOT FAIR 
TO YOU. 
YOU HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TOLD -- 
I CARE. 
I CARE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
I CARE ABOUT WHO IS ON THERE. 
I THINK YOU SHOULD CARE WHAT'S 
IN THAT, JUST AS WE SHOULD CARE 
WHAT'S IN IT. 
MORE DOCUMENTS THAN I HAD TIME 
TO DISCUSS TODAY. 
I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO 
RECONCILE, REGULARLY BEING TOLD 
YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU 
RECEIVED NOTHING STOLEN HAD NO 
REASON TO SUSPECT ANYTHING WAS 
STOLEN WHEN FRANKLY, AS WE NOW 
KNOW, REPUBLICAN STAFFER, 
MIRANDA, STOLE THINGS. 
SOME OF THE THINGS HE STOLE 
WENT DIRECTLY TO YOU. 
LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER ONE. 
YOU TESTIFIED IN 2004 THAT THE 
PRACTICE OF BEING IN A COURT 
ARGUMENT, YOU DID NOT WORK WITH 
THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE WILLIAM 
PRIOR. 
HE WAS A CONTROVERSIAL NOMINEE. 
HE CALLED ROE V WADE THE 
BIGGEST ABOMINATION. 
SAME SEX INTIMACY WOULD EXTEND 
TO PED BEASTOLOGY. 
YOU DIDN'T WORK ON HIS NO  
NOMINATION PERSONALLY, BUT YOU 
DID WORK IN THE WORKING GROUP, 
DID YOU NOT? 
>>  WE ALL WERE -- JUST SO YOU 
KNOW THE PROCESS. 
THE WHITE HOUSE, I THINK 
JUDICIAL SELECTION COMMITTEE. 
AND JUDGE GONZALEZ, THE COUNCIL 
TO THE PRESIDENT CHAIR OF THAT 
COMMITTEE. 
THAT STARTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
PRESIDENT BUSH CAME INTO OFFICE 
IN 2001. 
WE WOULD MEET WITH MEMOS AND 
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE STAFF 
WOULD BE ASSIGNED -- 
>>  DID YOU INTERVIEW WILLIAM 
PRIOR? 
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE SO. 
IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT I DON'T 
BELIEVE SO. 
IF I DID, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PART OF THE GENERAL PROCESS 
WHERE PEOPLE CAME IN. 
>>  I PUT IN THE RECORD, 
EXHIBIT C, YOU DID INTERVIEW 
HIM. 
>>  IT'S POSSIBLE. 
WE INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF 
NOMINEES, AS I SAID, SENATOR, 
AND WE MET EVERY WEEK FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS TO GO OVER 
NOMINEES. 
WE WORKED CLOSE WITH THE 
SNATORS. 
I HAD VARIOUS STATES. 
I HAD ILLINOIS, I HAD 
CALIFORNIA. 
I WORKED ON SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 
STAFF. 
BUT THEN WE WOULD SIT IN, 
SOMETIMES, ON INTERVIEWS OF 
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WOULD COME IN 
AND MEET AND GO OVER THE MEMOS. 
THEN WE WOULD MEET WITH THE 
PRESIDENT. 
WE MET EVERY WEEK WITH THE 
PRESIDENT BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11. 
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11, THOSE 
MEETINGS BECAME LESS FREQUENT. 
>>  YOU WOULD RECOMMEND HIM 
INTERNALLY FOR THE 11th CIRCUIT 
SEAT, HAD YOU NOT? 
>>  I HAVE NO REASON THAT I 
WOULDN'T HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM, 
BECAUSE HE WAS A HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
ALABAMA AND SENATOR SESSIONS, 
OF COURSE, KNEW HIM WELL AND HE 
WAS WELL RESPECTED. 
>>  THE ONLY REASON I ASK, ONE 
OF THE E-MAILS WE HAVE, IT SAYS 
BRETT, AT YOUR REQUEST, I ASK 
MATT TO SPEAK WITH PRIOR ABOUT 
HIS INTEREST. 
I'M NOT ASKING THESE QUESTIONS 
TO -- TO GET YOU IN A BIND, 
JUDGE. 
I'M ASKING THEM BECAUSE IT IS 
SO EASY ON THESE HEARINGS TO 
SAY, I DON'T REMEMBER. 
AND OFTENTIMES THAT'S THE CASE. 
BUT YOU MENTION MR. GONZALEZ. 
HE HAD DIFFICULTY REMEMBERING 
WHEN HE CAME HERE. 
HE HAD ONE HEARING, SO HE 
WOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM. 
I GAVE HIM 35, 45 OF THE 
QUESTIONS AHEAD OF TIME. 
EVERY ONE OF THEM HE SAID, I 
DON'T REMEMBER. 
I DON'T RECALL. 
AND THEN EVERY QUESTION HAS 
ALMOST EVERY QUESTION ASKED BY 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SAY, 
I DON'T RECALL. 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, HE WENT TO 
PRIVATE PRACTICE.
I THINK IT IS SO DIFFICULT THAT 
YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE THINGS 
DONE BY SOMEBODY WHO, I THINK 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, WE 
WOULD AGREE IS THE MOST 
AGREGOUS, WHEN MIRANDA STOLE 
MATERIAL FROM HERE. 
STOLE IT. 
TO SEND IT TO YOU AND OTHERS AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
YOU HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF 
THAT? 
>>  I OBVIOUSLY RECALL THE E-
MAILS, OR HAVE SEEN THE E-
MAILS. 
YOUR LARGER QUESTION WAS, DID 
THAT RAISE A RED FLAG AND I'VE 
ANSWERED THAT, NO. 
>>  WELL -- WHEN YOU WERE IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE, WAS PART OF 
YOUR JOB TO COACH PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES HOW TO 
ANSWER DEMOCRAT QUESTIONS ABOUT 
ROE VERSUS WADE? 
>>  PART OF OUR JOB WOULD HAVE 
TO PREPARE NOMINEES. 
IT WAS COMMON FOR SENATORS TO 
ASK THAT QUESTION. 
SO, I ASSUME THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED IN GOING THROUGH 
MOCK SESSIONS. 
I KNOW WE WERE INVOLVED IN 
GOING THROUGH MOCK SESSIONS. 
WHICH IS VERY STANDARD. 
>>  YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH 
MOCK SESSIONS WITH AT LEAST ONE 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM THIS 
COMMITTEE AND OTHER REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS. 
I'M NOT SAYING THAT AS A GOT 
YOU THING. 
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO 
THAT. 
YOU DID ADVISE OWEN HOW SHE 
SHOULD RESPOND TO THAT, 
ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE E-
MAILS. 
MY LAST QUESTION, DO YOU AGREE 
THAT A PLASTIC FIREARM CREATED 
WITH A 3D PRINTER, SO WE WOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE MINDS OF 
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS IN THE  
18th CENTURY, WOULD YOU AGREE 
THAT COULD BE REGULATED OR 
BANNED WITHOUT CREATING ANY  
2nd AMENDMENT QUESTIONS? 
>>  I THINK THERE MIGHT BE 
LITIGATION COMING ON THAT, 
SENATOR. 
CONSISTENT WITH JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE, PRINCIPLES, I 
SHOULDN'T COMMENT ON A 
POTENTIAL CASE LIKE THAT. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  I HAVE WRITTEN OUT HERE 
YOUR ANSWER AHEAD OF TIME. 
AND I JUST WROTE IT SO YOU DID 
NOT SEE WHAT I WROTE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO 
THE RECORD AN AD FROM THE L.A. 
TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD, CAN THE 
SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION EVER 
BE REPAIRED? 
THAT LETTER FROM KAVANAUGH'S 
CLASSMATES AT YALE. 
A LETTER SIGNED BY HUNDREDS OF 
FACULTY AND ALUMNI. 
A LETTER BY KENT, IN DECLARING 
LEDGER BY MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR. 
SO, I ASK THAT BE ALLOWED. 
JUST SAY WITHOUT OBJECTION. 
THAT'S GOOD. 
OKAY. 
THANK YOU JUDGE. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I WANT 
TO GO OVER WITH YOU. 
ONE, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT 
SENATOR LEAHY, HE WORKED WITH 
SENATOR GRASSLEY TO GET WHAT 
HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL RELEASE TO THE 
PUBLIC. 
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS AROUND 
HERE. 
YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU 
WANT, BUT YOU TRY TO WORK WITH 
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND MANY TIMES, 
YOU CAN SUCCEED. 
FROM A PUBLIC'S POINT OF VIEW, 
IT HAS TO WORK THIS WAY. 
YOU JUST CAN'T DO EVERYTHING 
YOU WANT IN A LEGISLATIVE BODY. 
THERE ARE RULES AND IT'S 
FRUSTRATING TO BE TOLD NO ON 
SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE 
ABOUT. 
BUT I'M OFTEN ASKED, PEOPLE 
WONDER, ARE THESE HEARINGS 
TURNING INTO A CIRCUS? 
AND I WANT TO DEFEND CIRCUSES. 
CIRCUSES ARE ENTERTAINING AND 
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO 
THEM. 
THIS HEARING IS NEITHER 
ENTERTAINING NOR APPROPRIATE 
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. 
NOW, SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES I 
RESPECT GREATLY ARE TRYING TO 
MAKE A POINT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT POINT 
IS. 
BUT I DO KNOW THIS. 
IF YOU WANT TO BE PRESIDENT, 
WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT, IS 
HARD. 
AND WHAT YOU DO WILL BE THE 
EXAMPLE OTHERS WILL FOLLOW. 
BACK TO THE SUBJECT MATTER. 
THE MORRISON CASE. 
WAS THAT ABOUT SEPARATION OF 
POWERS? 
>>  THAT WAS THE SEPARATION OF 
POWERS CASE. 
>>  OKAY. 
IT WAS ABOUT A CONGRESSIONAL 
STATUTE AND THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND HOW 
THEY INTERACTED. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
AND A VERY SPECIFIC STATUTORY 
SCHEME THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED 
HAD THE JUDICIARY INVOLVED IN 
APPOINTING THE COUNCIL. 
>>  APPARENTLY, KAGAN AND 
SCALIA AGREED, BUT KAGAN AGREED 
WITH SCALIA'S DECENT. 
>>  SHE CALLED IT THE GREATEST 
EVER WRITTEN, AND SHE ADDED, IT 
GETS BETTER EVERY YEAR. 
>>  I DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE 
HABIT OF LISTENING TO KAGAN, 
BUT I WILL HERE. 
BECAUSE SHE'S A FINE PERSON. 
THE SITUATION WE HAVE BEFORE US 
ABOUT MR. MUELLER, THAT'S NOT A 
SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE, IS 
IT? 
AREN'T THESE DIFFERENT FACTS 
THAT MR. MUELLER WAS APPOINTED 
THROUGH DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
REGULATIONS. 
>>  SENATOR, I DON'T WANT TO 
TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CURRENT 
EVENTS, BUT I WILL REFER BACK 
TO WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN 
PREVIOUSLY ABOUT SPECIAL 
COUNSEL. 
DO YOU WATCH TELEVISION? 
THE COUNSEL DOESN'T EXIST 
ANYMORE, DOES IT? 
>>  THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
STATUTE DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE 
SINCE 1999, THE TRADITIONAL 
SPECIAL COUNSEL SYSTEM I HAVE 
WRITTEN ABOUT IS THE ORDINARY 
WAY THAT OUTSIDE 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
>>  IS THAT AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
FUNCTION? 
>>  THAT IS ORDINARILY 
APPOINTED BY THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL -- 
>>  WHO IS A MEMBER OF WHAT? 
>>  THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
>>  LAST TIME I CHECKED, THAT'S 
NOT A SEPARATION OF POWERS 
ISSUE. 
>>  THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN 
AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
>> NOW THE QUESTION IS, IF 
SOMEONE IS APPOINTED AS SPECIAL 
COUNSEL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE REGULATIONS WHO HAS 
AUTHORITY OVER IMPLEMENTING 
THOSE REGULATIONS AND 
OVERSEEING THOSE REGULATIONS. 
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IS 
DIFFERENT. 
LEGALLY AND FACTUALLY, THAN THE 
MORRISON SITUATION, WHERE YOU 
HAD A STATUTE. 
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THE LAW REGARDING THE 
PRESIDENT. 
CLINTON TELLS US, SEE IF I'M 
CORRECT. 
THAT YOU CAN BE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
YOU CAN STILL BE SUED FOR 
CONDUCT BEFORE YOU'RE A 
PRESIDENT. 
WHEN YOU INVOKE EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE, THE COURT SAID NO, 
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU HAVE TO SHOW 
UP AT A DEPOSITION, BECAUSE IT 
HAPPENED BEFORE YOU WERE 
PRESIDENT. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  A CIVIL SUIT, THE CLINTON 
VERSUS JONES CASE, A SUIT THAT 
HAD INVOLVED ACTIVITY BEFORE 
PRESIDENT CLINTON BECAME 
PRESIDENT. 
>>  SO, IT'S PRETTY WELL 
UNDERSTOOD THROUGH SUPREME 
COURT PRECEDENT THAT IF YOU'RE 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, AND YOU ENGAGED IN 
CONDUCT THAT ALLOWED YOU TO BE 
SUED BEFORE YOU GOT TO BE 
PRESIDENT, YOU CAN'T AVOID YOUR 
DAY IN COURT ON THE CIVIL SIDE. 
THE NIXON HOLDING SAID WHAT? 
>>  THE NIXON HOLDING SAID IN 
THE CONTEXT OF THE SPECIFIC 
REGULATIONS THERE, THAT A 
CRIMINAL TRIAL SUBPOENA TO THE 
PRESIDENT FOR INFORMATION, IN 
THAT CASE, THE TAPES, COULD BE 
ENFORCED. 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE THAT WAS RECOGNIZED 
IN THAT CASE AS ROOTED IN 
ARTICLE 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
>>  SO, THAT'S THE LAW OF THE 
LAND AS OF THIS MOMENT. 
>>  THAT UNITED STATES VERSUS 
NIXON IS THE LAW OF THE LAND. 
>>  NOW, WHETHER OR NOT A 
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED WHILE 
IN OFFICE HAS BEEN A DISCUSSION 
THAT HAS GONE ON FOR A LONG 
TIME. 
IS THAT TRUE IN THE LEGAL 
WORLD? 
>>  THAT'S CORRECT. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR 
THE LAST 45 YEARS, HAS TAKEN 
THE CONSISTENT POSITION THROUGH 
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC 
ADMINISTRATIONS THAT A SITTING 
PRESIDENT MAY NOT BE INDICTED 
IN OFFICE. 
THE MOST THOROUGH OPINION IS 
WRITTEN BY RANDY MOSS, WHO WAS 
HEAD OF PRESIDENT CLINTON'S 
OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL IN 
2000. 
HE IS NOW A DISTRICT JUDGE 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ON 
THE DISTRICT COURT IN D.C. 
>>  I ANY YOU HAVE WRITTEN ON 
THIS TOPIC. 
>>  I HAVE NOT WRITTEN ON THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY. 
>>  WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE 
WISE TO DO THIS. 
>>  I MADE MY THOUGHTS KNOWN 
FOR CONGRESS TO EXAMINE, 
BECAUSE IN THE WAKE OF 
SEPTEMBER 11, I THOUGHT ONE OF 
THE THINGS CONGRESS COULD LOOK 
AT IS HOW TO MAKE THE 
PRESIDENCY MORE EFFECTIVE. 
>>  I JUST WANT MY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES TO REMIND YOU THAT 
WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS 
BEING INVESTIGATED, YOU TOOK 
THE POSITION THAT HE IS NOT 
ABOVE THE LAW, BUT IN TERMS OF 
INDICTING A SITTING PRESIDENT, 
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE 
COUNTRY TO WAIT AND THE PERSON 
WHO ECHOED THAT THE MOST, OR AT 
LEAST EFFECTIVE FROM HIS POINT 
OF VIEW WAS JOE BIDEN. 
SO THERE'S NOTHING NEW HERE, 
FOLKS. 
WHEN IT'S A DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENT, THEY ADOPT THE 
POSITIONS THAT THEY ARE ARGUING 
AGAINST NOW. 
THAT'S NOTHING NEW IN POLITICS. 
I'M SURE WE DO THE SAME THING. 
SO, THIS MAN, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
IS NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG BY 
TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE THE 
WAY HE TALKS ABOUT IT. 
WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IS 
BLENDING CONCEPTS. 
TO JUSTIFY A VOTE THAT WILL BE 
INEVITABLE. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY THESE 
GAMES TO VOTE NO. 
JUST SAY YOU DON'T AGREE WITH 
HIS PHILOSOPHY. 
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S QUALIFIED, 
BUT THE THING I HATE THE MOST 
IS TO TAKE CONCEPTS AND TURN 
THEM AROUND, UPSIDE DOWN, TO 
MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE THERE IS 
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU. 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU. 
THE FAULT LIES ON OUR SIDE. 
MOST AMERICANS AFTER THIS 
HEARING WILL HAVE A DIMMER VIEW 
OF THE SENATE. 
RIGHTLY SO. 
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BELIEVE 
THAT YOU STOLE ANYTHING. 
DID YOU STEAL ANYTHING FROM 
ANYBODY WHILE YOU WERE WORKING 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID YOU KNOW THAT ANYBODY 
STOLE ANYTHING OR DID YOU 
ENCOURAGE THEM TO STEAL 
ANYTHING? 
>>  NO. 
>>  DID YOU USE ANYTHING 
KNOWINGLY THAT WAS STOLEN? 
>>  NO. 
>>  SO, YOU CAN TALK ABOUT MR. 
MIRANDA, BUT I DON'T WANT THE 
PUBLIC TO BELIEVE THAT YOU DID 
ANYTHING WRONG, BECAUSE I DON'T 
BELIEVE YOU DID. 
SO, IT'S OKAY TO VOTE NO. 
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO TAKE LEGAL 
CONCEPTS AND FLIP THEM UPSIDE 
DOWN AND ACT LIKE WE'RE DOING 
SOMETHING WRONG ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE WHEN YOU HAD 
THE EXACT SAME POSITION WHEN IT 
WAS YOUR TURN. 
ROE V WADE, YOU'VE HEARD OF 
THAT CASE, RIGHT? 
>>  I HAVE, SENATOR. 
>>  NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE 
IT. 
A  LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T. 
IT'S AN EMOTIONAL DEBATE IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE 
CONSTITUTION ABOUT A RIGHT TO 
ABORTION? 
IS ANYTHING WRITTEN IN THE 
DOCUMENT? 
>>  SENATOR, THE SUPREME COURT 
IS RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT TO 
ABORTION SINCE THE 1973 ROE V 
WADE CASE. 
REAFFIRMED IT MANY TIMES. 
>>  MY QUESTION IS, DID THEY 
FIND A PHRASE IN THE 
CONSTITUTION THAT SAID THAT THE 
STATE CANNOT INTERFERE WITH A 
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE UNTIL 
MEDICAL VIABILITY OCCURS? 
IS THAT IN THE CONSTITUTION? 
>>  THE SUPREME COURT APPLYING 
THE LIBERTY. 
>>  IT'S A SIMPLE. 
NO, IT'S NOT, SENATOR GRAHAM. 
THOSE WORDS. 
>>  I WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL, 
BECAUSE THIS IS A TOPIC ON 
WHICH -- 
>>  IF YOU'LL JUST FOLLOW ME, 
I'LL LET YOU TALK. 
THE POINT IS, WILL YOU TELL ME 
YES OR NO, IS THERE ANYTHING IN 
THE DOCUMENT ITSELF TALKING 
ABOUT LIMITING THE STATE'S 
ABILITY TO PROTECT THE UNBORN 
BEFORE VIABILITY? 
IS THERE ANY PHRASE IN THE 
CONSTITUTION ABOUT ABORTION? 
>>  THE SUPREME COURT HAS 
FOUNDED UNDER THE LIBERTY 
CLAUSE, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT -- 
>>  IS THERE ANYTHING TALKING 
ABOUT ABORTION? 
>>  THE LIBERTY CLAUSE REFERS 
TO LIBERTY. 
>>  LAST TIME I CHECKED, 
LIBERTY DIDN'T EQUATE TO 
ABORTION. 
THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT DID, 
BUT HERE'S THE POINT. 
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON THIS 
CONCEPT? 
YOU HAD FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, 
EIGHT, OR NINE JUDGES. 
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON THE 
ABILITY OF THE COURT TO FIND 
RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO A 
PARTICULAR SITUATION. 
WHAT ARE THE CHECKS AND 
BALANCES OF PEOPLE IN YOUR 
BUSINESS, IF YOU CAN FIND FIVE 
PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH YOU, TO 
CONFER A RIGHT WHETHER THE 
PUBLIC LIKES IT OR NOT, BASED 
ON THIS CONCEPT OF RIGHTS. 
WHAT ARE THE OUTER LIMITS TO 
THIS? 
>>  THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 
GLUCKSBERG CASE, IS THE TEST 
THAT THE SUPREME COURT USES TO 
FIND RIGHTS UNDER THE LIBERTY 
CLAUSE OF THE DUE PROCESS 
CLAUSE OF THE 14th AMENDMENT:  
AND THAT REFERS TO RIGHTS 
ROOTED IN THE HISTORY AND 
TRADITION OF THE COUNTRY, SO AS 
TO PREVENT -- 
>>  LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
IS THERE ANY RIGHT ROOTED IN 
THE HISTORY AND TRADITIONS OF 
THE COUNTRY WHERE LEGISLATIVE 
BODIES COULD NOT INTERCEDE ON 
BEHALF OF THE UNBORN BEFORE 
MEDICAL VIABILITY. 
IS THAT PART OF OUR HISTORY? 
>>  THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 
HAS RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT TO 
ABORTION. 
>>  I'M JUST SAYING, WHAT PART 
OF THE HISTORY -- I DON'T THINK 
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS, PEOPLE 
MENTIONED OUR FOUNDING FATHERS. 
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT BEING 
PART OF AMERICAN HISTORY. 
SO, HOW DID THE COURT DETERMINE 
THAT IT WAS? 
>>  THE COURT IMPLIED THE 
PRECEDENT THAT EXISTED AND 
FOUND IN 1973, THAT UNDER THE 
LIBERTY CLAUSE. 
>>  BEFORE 1973, I MEAN, WHEN 
YOU TALK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF 
THE UNITED STATES, THE COURT 
HAS FOUND THAT PART OF OUR 
HISTORY IS FOR THE LEGISLATIVE 
BODIES, NOT TO HAVE A SAY ABOUT 
PROTECTING THE UNBORN UNTIL 
MEDICAL VIABILITY. 
I HAVEN'T -- WHETHER YOU AGREE 
WITH THAT OR NOT, I DON'T THINK 
THAT'S PART OF OUR HISTORY. 
SO, FILL IN THE BLANK. 
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF PEOPLE 
IN YOUR BUSINESS APPLYING THAT 
CONCEPT TO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT 
YOU THINK TO BE LIBERTY. 
>>  THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT 
SOME HAVE EXPRESSED ABOUT THE 
CONCEPT OF RIGHTS. 
>>  HERE'S THE CONCERN I HAVE. 
YOU HAVE ONE WORD THAT HAS 
OPENED UP THE ABILITY FOR FIVE 
PEOPLE TO TELL EVERYBODY 
ELECTED IN THE COUNTRY, YOU 
CAN'T GO THERE. 
THAT THIS IS OFF LIMITS FOR A 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ROE V 
WADE OR NOT, JUST THINK WHAT 
COULD HAPPEN DOWN THE ROAD IF 
FIVE PEOPLE DETERMINED THE WORD 
LIBERTY MEANS X. THE ONLY REAL 
CHECK AND BALANCE IS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO 
CHANGE THE RULING. 
DID YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>>  SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 
COMMENT ON POTENTIAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. 
>>  IF WE PASS THE STATUTE 
TOMORROW IN CONGRESS, SAYING 
THAT THE CONGRESS CAN REGULATE 
ABORTIONS BEFORE MEDICAL 
VIABILITY, WOULDN'T THAT FLY IN 
THE FACE OF ROE V. WADE? 
>>  THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 
-- 
>>  ALL OF US COULD VOTE, FIVE 
PEOPLE HAVE SAID LIBERTY MEANS 
RIGHT TO AN -- THE STATE HAS NO 
INTEREST HERE BEFORE MEDICAL 
VIABILITY. 
THAT WE CAN PASS ALL THE LAWS 
WE WANT, BECAUSE THEY FALL. 
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CHANGE THAT 
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
PROCESS THAT REQUIRES 2/3 OF 
THE HOUSE. 
2/3 OF THE SENATE. 
3/4 OF THE STATE. 
IS THAT A PRETTY CORRECT LEGAL 
ANALYSIS? 
>>  WHEN THE SUPREME COURT 
ISSUED A  RULING -- 
>>  SO HERE'S THE POINT. 
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ROE V. 
WADE OR NOT, THE REASON SOME 
LEGAL SCHOLARS OBJECT TO THIS 
CONCEPT IS BREATHTAKINGLY 
UNLIMITED. 
WHATEVER FIVE PEOPLE BELIEVE AT 
ANY GIVEN TIME IN HISTORY, IN 
TERMS OF THE WORD LIBERTY, THEY 
CAN REWRITE OUR HISTORY AND 
COME UP WITH A NEW HISTORY. 
I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR 
DEMOCRACY TO MAKE HISTORY IS TO 
HAVE THE COURTS INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION, A CHECK AND 
BALANCE ON US, BUT NOT TAKE ONE 
WORD AND CREATE A CONCEPT THAT 
IS BREATHTAKING IN TERMS OF THE 
APPLICATION TO RESTRICT THE 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. 
NOW, WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME 
OR NOT, I THINK THERE'S A 
GENUINE DEBATE. 
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME IF IT 
WAS SOMETHING YOU LIKED OR YOU 
WERE SUPPORTING THAT GOT SHUT 
OUT. 
OR YOU OPPOSED YOU COULDN'T DO. 
I HOPE THAT ONE DAY THE COURT 
WILL SIT DOWN AND THINK LONG 
AND HARD ABOUT THE PATH THEY'VE 
CHARTED. 
NOT JUST ABOUT ABORTION. 
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S RIGHT FOR 
PEOPLE IN YOUR BUSINESS ON ANY 
GIVEN DAY BASED ON ANY GIVEN 
CASE OF CONTROVERSY, TO SAY 
THAT THE WORD LIBERTY LOOKING 
AT THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY 
AND THE RIGHTS MEANS X. AND IT 
SHUTS OUT ALL OF US WHO HAVE 
GONE TO THE BALLOT BOX AND GONE 
THROUGH THE TEST OF BEING 
ELECTED. 
I'LL ASK THAT YOU THINK ABOUT 
IT. 
I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT. 
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE ON 9/11. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  THAT IS CORRECT, SENATOR. 
>>  DID YOU BELIEVE AMERICA WAS 
UNDER ATTACK? 
>>  YES. 
IN A WAY, IT WAS UNDER ATTACK. 
>>  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IF THE 
TERRORISTS COULD STRIKE ANY 
CITY IN THE WORLD, AND YOU GET 
ONE SHOT AT THE WORLD, BASED ON 
YOUR TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE, 
DO YOU BELIEVE THEY WOULD PICK 
AN AMERICAN CITY OVER ANY OTHER 
CITY? 
>>  WELL, IT CERTAINLY SEEMED 
THAT NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON, 
D.C. WERE THE TWO TARGETS. 
>>  THE ONLY REASON I MENTION 
THAT TO MY GOOD FRIENDS, AND 
THEY ARE, WHO BELIEVE THAT 
AMERICA IS NOT PART OF THE 
BATTLEFIELD, SURE WAS ON 9/11. 
THE LAW. 
IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN GOES TO 
AFGHANISTAN AND TAKES UP THE 
FIGHT AGAINST OUR FORCES AND 
CAPTURED IN AFGHANISTAN, THE 
CURRENT LAW IS YOU CAN BE 
HEALED  HELD AS AN ENEMY. 
>>  THAT'S WHAT THE SUPREME 
COURT SAID, WITH THE 
APPROPRIATE DUE PROCESS 
FINDINGS. 
>>  ABSOLUTELY. 
APPROPRIATE DUE PROCESS 
FINDINGS. 
HERE'S WHAT I WANT PEOPLE IN 
YOUR BUSINESS TO THINK ABOUT. 
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE FACT THAT 
THE RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS ARE 
TRYING TO RECRUIT AMERICANS TO 
THEIR CAUSE? 
OVER THE INTERNET, TRYING TO 
GET AMERICANS TO TAKE UP JIHAD? 
>>  YES. 
>>  THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN 
AMERICAN CITIZEN JOINING THEIR 
CAUSE IS REAL. 
BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED IN THE 
PAST. 
THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT HAPPENING 
IN THE FUTURE, I THINK, IS 
HIGHLY LIKELY. 
IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 
ATTACKING THE EMBASSY IN COBLE 
CAN BE HELD AS AN AMERICAN 
CITIZEN, HERE'S THE QUESTION. 
CAN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN 
COLLABORATING WITH OTHER 
TERRORISTS BE HELD FOR 
ATTACKING THE CAPITAL? 
AND IF THEY CAN'T, YOU ARE 
INCENTIVIZING THE ENEMY, 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PRIVILEGE 
THAT NO OTHER TERRORIST WOULD 
HAVE. 
SO, YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY 
COMPELLING TO ME. 
THAT YOU APPLY THE LAW AND YOU 
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT 
AFFECTS PEOPLE. 
RIGHT? 
>>  YES, SIR. 
>>  I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND 
THAT THIS WAR IS NOT OVER. 
THE WAR IS COMING BACK TO OUR 
SHORES. 
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME 
BEFORE THEY HIT US AGAIN. 
BECAUSE BUT HAVE TO BE RIGHT 
ALL THE TIME AND THEY HAVE TO 
BE RIGHT ONE TIME. 
I HOPE WE DON'T CREATE A 
PROCESS WHERE IF YOU CAN COME 
TO AMERICA, YOU GET A SPECIAL 
DEAL. 
MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO DEAL 
WITH YOU AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU 
KNOW. 
WE TREAT YOU AS A COMMON 
CRIMINAL VERSUS THE WARRIOR 
YOU'VE BECOME. 
THAT'S JUST MY PARTING THOUGHT 
TO YOU. 
AND YOU'LL DECIDE THE WAY YOU 
THINK IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. 
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO 
SAY ABOUT THIS PROCESS THAT 
WOULD HELP US MAKE IT BETTER? 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET CONFIRMED. 
I WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE COMING 
AFTER YOU. 
EVERY TIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE 
HEARINGS, IT GETS WORSE AND 
WORSE AND WORSE. 
YOU SAT THERE PATIENTLY FOR A 
COUPLE OF DAYS. 
MY COLLEAGUES ASKED YOU TOUGH 
QUESTIONS. 
SOMETIMES UNFAIR QUESTIONS. 
YOUR TIME IS ABOUT OVER. 
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. 
YOU WOULD BE SMART NOT TO 
ANSWER AT ALL. 
I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO 
TELL US, WHAT COULD WE DO 
BETTER, IF ANYTHING? 
>>  SENATOR, I'M GOING TO THANK 
ALL THE SENATORS ON THE 
COMMITTEE AND ALL THE SENATORS 
NOT ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR 
TIME AND CARE. 
AS I SAID, EACH SENATOR IS 
COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND 
THE PUBLIC GOOD, IN MY OPINION, 
AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME 
OF THE SENATORS AND I'M ON THE 
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN 
AND OPTIMIST ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>  BEFORE WE BREAK, I WANT TO 
BRING UP SOME INFORMATION, 
BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING HOW 
LONG IT WOULD TAKE THE NATIONAL 
ARCHIVES TO GET THE MATERIAL 
THAT WE NEEDED, BECAUSE YOU'VE 
HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THAT THE 
ARCHIVES, IT'S THEIR 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES HAS 13 
ARCHIVISTS WHO HANDLED GEORGE 
W. BUSH'S PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS. 
THEY CAN ONLY REVIEW ABOUT 
1,000 PAGES PER WEEK. 
WE COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THESE 
DOCUMENTS FOR 37 WEEKS. 
IF WE DIDN'T GET PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S TEAM TO EXPEDITE THE 
REVIEW PROCESS FOR THE BENEFIT 
OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE. 
WE RECEIVED ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
WE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE 
ARCHIVIST, JUST AS A FASTER AND 
FASTER TIME. 
WE'LL NOW TAKE 15 MINUTES AND 
RESUME AT 12:22. 
>>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING IS TAKING 
A BREAK. 
A 15 MINUTE RECESS. 
TODAY WAS NOT PERHAPS AS 
PASSIONATE AS YESTERDAY WAS. 
THERE WERE A FEW PROTESTERS, 
BUT NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WE SAW 
YESTERDAY. 
BUT IT STARTED WITH SOME 
FIREWORKS WITH COREY BOOKER, 
AND WE DIDN'T KNOW AT THE TIME 
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 
RELEASE OF A MEMO THAT WAS 
LEAKED AS THE CONFIRMATION 
HEARING WAS UNFOLDING. 
>>  THE MEMO, IN FACT, HAD TO 
DO WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
WRITINGS. 
THE CONTROVERSIAL ROE V. WADE 
DECISION, AND ALSO WITH 
SOMETHING RELATED TO 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. 
COREY BOOKER WANTED TO RELEASE 
THE MEMO OF THE OTHER SIDE 
ARGUED THAT IT WASN'T BEING 
RELEASED BECAUSE OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY INTERESTS. 
HE GOT INTO IT A LITTLE WITH 
SENATOR JOHN OF TEXAS. 
COREY BOOKER ESSENTIALLY 
SAYING, I'M WILLING TO GIVE UP 
BEING A SENATOR TO RELEASE THIS 
INFORMATION AND IF YOU WANT TO 
GO AFTER ME FOR BEING A 
SENATOR, BRING IT, IS THE QUOTE 
HE SAID. 
ULTIMATELY, IT WAS INTRODUCED 
INTO THE RECORD AND SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN ASKED HIM ABOUT IT 
AND AS HE HAS OVER THE COURSE 
OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HE 
SORT OF USED JUDICIAL PRECEDENT 
IN NAMING THE FACT THAT THE 
CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME 
COURT HAVE NOT ANSWERED 
QUESTIONS REGARDING THE CASES 
THAT COULD COME UP BEFORE THE 
BENCH, ALTHOUGH HE DID ADDRESS 
WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SAY IN 
THE E-MAIL. 
>>  I THINK WE HAVE THAT 
EXCHANGE. 
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT EXCHANGE 
WITH COREY BOOKER, IF WE COULD 
PLAY THAT, SO PEOPLE GET AN 
IDEA. 
>>  NO SENATE RULE AND NO 
HISTORY OF THE SENATE ACCOUNTS 
FOR WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 
THAT WAS FOLLOWING THIS ARCHIVE 
PARTISAN OPERATIVE, FOLLOWING 
HIS VOMIT  PROCESS. MANY OF 
THESE DOCUMENTS WERE DUMPED IN 
THE LAST MINUTE. 
THE SENATOR MADE A GOOD POINT. 
I KNOWINGLY VIOLATED THE RULES 
THAT WERE PUT FORTH AND I'M 
TOLD THAT THE CONFIDENTIAL 
RULES HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES. 
SO, SIR, I COME FROM A LONG 
LINE AS AMERICANS, UNDERSTAND 
WHAT THAT KIND OF CIVIL 
DISOBEDIENCE IS. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 
CONSEQUENCES. 
I AM RIGHT NOW BEFORE YOUR 
PROCESS IS FINISHED, I AM GOING 
TO RELEASE THE E-MAIL ABOUT 
RACIAL PROFILING. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PENALTY 
COMES WITH OUSTING FROM THE 
SENATE. 
AND IF SENATOR CORNYN BELIEVES 
I VIOLATED SENATE RULES, I 
OPENLY INVITE AND ACCEPT THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF MY TEAM 
RELEASING THAT E-MAIL RIGHT 
NOW. 
I'M RELEASING IT TO EXPOSE 
NUMBER ONE, THE E MA ILLS ARE 
BEING HELD FROM THE PUBLIC, 
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH 
NATIONAL SECURITY. 
>>  SO, ULTIMATELY, THAT E-MAIL 
WAS RELEASED INTO THE PUBLIC 
RECORD. 
WE ALSO WANT TO PLAY FOR YOUR 
OUR AUDIENCE, IN EXCHANGE WITH 
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
>>  ULTIMATELY, A PORTION OF IT 
HAS TO DO WITH ROE V. WADE, AND 
WHETHER OR NOT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
BELIEVES IT -- A COMMENT HE 
SUGGEST BE REMOVED FROM A MEMO. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN ASKED HIM 
ABOUT THAT. 
>>  SO YOU BELIEVE IT IS 
CORRECTLY SETTLED. 
IS IT CORRECT LAW IN YOUR VIEW? 
>>  SENATOR, ON THAT CASE, OR 
ON DICKERSON OR ON CASES, LIKE 
CITIZENS UNITED OR UNITED 
STATES VERSUS LOPEZ, JUST THE 
WHOLE BODY OF MODERN SUPREME 
COURT CASE LAW, I HAVE TO 
FOLLOW WHAT THE NOMINEES WHO 
HAVE BEEN IN THIS SEAT BEFORE 
HAVE DONE. 
>>  JUDGE, A YES OR A NO WILL 
DO. 
>>  BRIEFLY, I'LL TRY TO BE 
BRIEF. 
WHEN YOU'RE IN THIS SEAT, I'M 
NOT JUST SITTING HERE FOR 
MYSELF. 
I'M SITTING HERE AS A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE JUDICIARY 
AND THE OBLIGATION TO PRESERVE 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE 
JUDICIARY, WHICH YOU CARE 
DEEPLY ABOUT. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE DONE IS 
STUDIED CAREFULLY WHAT NOMINEES 
HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. 
WHAT I REFERRED TO AS NOMINEE 
PRECEDENT. 
REALLY ALL THE JUSTICES HAVE 
NOT GIVEN HINTS OR FORECASTS OR 
PREVIEWS AND JUSTICE KAGAN 
CAPTURED IT WELL, AS SHE OFTEN 
DOES, WITH TALKING ABOUT 
QUESTIONS LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE 
ASKING. 
YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMB'S UP OR 
THUMBS DOWN AND MAINTAIN THE 
JUDICIARY. 
I NEED TO FOLLOW THAT NOMINEE 
PRECEDENT HERE. 
>>  SO, THE NOMINEE PRECEDENT 
SAID, DON'T GO ON THE RECORD 
ABOUT ANYTHING, IF YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO. 
>>  SO, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 
RIGHT NOW. 
WE EXPECT THAT THIS HEARING 
WILL PICK UP IN ABOUT 15 
MINUTES OR SO. 
BUT WHILE WE AWAIT FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO GET BACK INTO THAT 
SENATE HEARING ROOM, LET'S GIVE 
YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT'S 
HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF 
WASHINGTON, D.C., INCLUDING 
THIS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN 
CINCINNATI. 
SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED 
DURING THE COURSE OF THAT 
SHOOTING. 
IT HAPPENED EARLIER, THIS 
MORNING AT A BANK IN THE 
DOWNTOWN AREA. 
WE LEARNED FOUR PEOPLE ARE 
DEAD, INCLUDING THE SUSPECT. 
>>  IT'S UNCLEAR IF HE TOOK HIS 
OWN LIFE OR IF POLICE KILLED 
HIM. 
OFFICERS ADDRESSED THE SHOOTING 
EARLIER. 
>>  WHAT I CAN SAY, OUR 
OFFICERS RESPONDED VERY 
QUICKLY. 
THEY ENGAGED THE THREAT AND 
THEY NEUTRALIZED THAT THREAT. 
HOWEVER, THERE WERE TRAGEDIES 
THAT OCCURRED. 
THESE ARE THINGS WE SEE 
HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
WE ALL HAVE TO BE VIGILANT AND 
BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THESE 
SITUATIONS. 
FROM WHAT I SEE PRELIMINARILY, 
THE BANK RESPONDED WITH THEIR 
LOCKDOWN PROCEDURES AS WELL AS 
OUR OFFICERS RESPONDING TO THE 
DANGER. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE TO COME AS 
SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. 
>>  THE FBI AND THE ATF ARE ON 
THE SCENE HELPING LOCAL POLICE 
INVESTIGATE. 
SO STAY WITH US THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY AND WE'LL GET MORE 
INFORMATION AS THE STORY 
DEVELOPS. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK
