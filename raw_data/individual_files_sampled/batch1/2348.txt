the goal of having lighthouse is to give us a space where we can put the best product people the best designers the best developers the best engineers and the best modern manufacturing equipment all in one place so we can actually improve the processes and ultimately the product that people see so we can make the most advanced most innovative and best product that's ever been made so welcome to the lighthouse behind me we have our automated cement line and this cement line has a robot that is automatically programmed based on any size midsole that I place on this belt to clean prime and cement in a matter of seconds every midsole that's placed on this belt and once that is complete now we're ready for the upper to be placed onto the midsole and the process is complete the production setup would do 2,400 pairs in 8 hours in today's process in Asia that would be the equivalent of 200 people to accomplish that same quantity of shoes this is our 3d body scanner this is technology that was adapted from the medical industry and this scanner has 54 cameras that capture seven frames a second and allows us to capture both the volumetric the angular and the linear data on all of our athletes and it creates an avatar that allows our designers to design in 3d and so we will be able to create and understand how their bodies are shaped and also not just in instill but also in motion which will allow designers to understand how the fabric is draped on them as they perform the actual motion of their sport this is our prototyping area this is where our designers working with our technicians working to develop the next processes we have four cells in here we have a so free cell we have a knit and woven's cell and then we have a broad intimate cell back here the unreleased product that I'm most excited about are always the ones that are going to take us to another level where nobody else's is really playing but I think we have a number of things across footwear apparel and accessories that are really going to change the game as it relates to the consumer and the consumer benefit of that innovation and that's really what we love is like it's great to give somebody something that they love because of the way it looks it's even better if we can give them both it's something that looks beautiful that they'll buy just because it looks so beautiful with the way it performs actually allows them to feel the difference in that innovation and that's what we call consumer valued innovation that's what we always strive for and we've got a number of things coming that we're really excited about there
