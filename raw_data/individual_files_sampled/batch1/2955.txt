as a businessman and real estate developer I have legally used a tax laws to my benefit Donald's father Fred made his fortune his very large fortune in real estate development in brooklyn and queens never saw a loophole or an abatement or you know any possible advantage that he didn't run right through he was very famous for being very aggressive about pushing every possible way that he could have government support it's not illegal but he absolutely pushed it to the limit and at one time actually he had to testify in congress over his windfall profits that he got out of these federal housing subsidy programs where he had to estimate the cost and then what do you know he would come in way under and he would get to keep what was left out of those subsidies sound familiar he did very well with that and he had to testify in congress about this and he said you know essentially what's wrong with making a profit and you know yes i did push everything and what's the matter with that and that's a kind of model for how Donald has operated his businesses of every time there was an abatement a possibility of some sort of tax forgiveness or you know in some way that government funds could be used in the course of building his real estate empire used it he was extremely aggressive about that I have brilliantly used those laws we of course speak of this as if Donald Trump was sitting there with an adding machine and a paper and pencil and figuring out his tax returns of course not oh I did all the tax preparation he never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature one of the things that he's done that his father did they paid a lot of attention to hiring good lawyers a legal team that would be able to pursue very often seemingly arcane matters about zoning law and abatements and tax issues and things that seem highly you know in the weeds kind of stuff that in fact or the kind you know how people make a lot of money and he has been very careful to lawyer himself up if I can make a verb out of an accountant himself up and his father did likewise
