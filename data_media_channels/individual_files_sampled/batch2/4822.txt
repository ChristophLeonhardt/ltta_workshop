across the country hundreds of children still remain separated from their parents and in many cases it's solely red tape keeping families apart I want to take a show you these pictures this is a Lydia Sousa her nine-year-old son Diogo Sousa was in detention but then she was released after the government determined she did in fact have a credible fear of persecution in Brazil but now more than two weeks later her son remains detained in Chicago Jeff Goldman is an immigration attorney in Massachusetts and represents MS Souza thanks so much for being with us as I understand it Lydia was released on June 9th to join relatives in Hyannis Massachusetts the ninth it's now the 25th her son is still being held more than a thousand miles away from her as best as you can tell why is she not been reunited with her son red tape the government has changed this story many many times on on the process to release Joe Joe and the latest yesterday is that the Department of Health and Human Services wants a full background security check done in miss Souza and anyone who is living in her home they've now scheduled fingerprints to be done July 6th and then said it will be 22 additional days before the paperwork will be processed and that's when they see that Joe Joe would be released and based on that we're filing suit in federal court this morning Wow I mean you know I thought it was bad when they said call us back in a week now they're telling you get back to us on July 28th I mean I know that this morning right you filed a suit in federal court did have you done that and what what do you think you can accomplish here we think we can get a temporary restraining order prohibiting the government from holding Joe Joe he needs to be reunited with his mother and he doesn't need to be treated like a piece of chattel which is really what's happening here I understand there are procedures and processes that have to be followed oh yeah this is the otic case his actual mother and we want to make sure he's going to a safe home but what is all this paperwork 37 pages of paperwork they sent that she needed to fill out which we helped her do we returned that at least four days ago and it took them two days to get back to us to say okay now we're going to have background security checks done fingerprints need to be done who were the two people in the home where she's living mind you they released her because she has a valid claim for political asylum but they she does not have the right to work she has no money she's borrowing a couch in the home of a family who has let her stay and now that family is subject to background to church security checks we offered to bring Lydia to Chicago where Jojo is and have the two of them stay in a hotel for the 22 days that the government needs to process this and they said no so Jojo spent his ninth birthday away from his mother I understand they did at least get a phone call but I wonder what went through your mind when you heard the president suggesting on Twitter that we should just eliminate due process send these migrants back to their countries no judges no court cases to clarify Jojo did not get to speak to his mother on his birthday I was outraged birthday they refused the the the people who are at the detention center refused to let the mother speak to him on his birthday as far as president Trump's latest statements it is so disheartening so frustrating he's talking to talk he's talking to his base he doesn't even know the facts or what's going on here the statement most recent statement says that these children will be held until the parent finishes the deportation proceeding this could be weeks months years if you are asking for political asylum the president doesn't even know that he doesn't address that and and this this is really a crime what's going on hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
