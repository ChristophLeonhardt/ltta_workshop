1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
Reporter: Why Rich, specifically? Why'd you invite him?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,940
Tony: He's my bud!
(Laughs)

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,900
I'm Rich Feloni,
senior reporter at Business Insider.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,020
Tony Robbins is a, what he likes to call,
"performance coach." He's coached people

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,269
like Serena Williams, Marc Benioff at
Salesforce, Paul Tudor Jones who's a

6
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,189
billionaire investor. Over the last few
years, I've had several opportunities to

7
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,280
interview him. His team reached out to me
and said Tony is going to be at his

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,770
resort in Fiji. He was going to be
hosting the winners of Shopify's "Build a

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,890
Bigger Business" competition and so we
decided that yeah this would be a great

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,040
opportunity to see what Tony is actually
like. We headed out from JFK in New York City

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,780
to LAX and then from LAX we took
Fiji Airways to the main airport in Fiji.

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,200
It's called Nadi.

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,420
As we're waiting to
get on this little island hopper, we

14
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,620
noticed that on the runway is Tony's
private jet and it has a big TR logo on it.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,060
I'm going to admit that I was pretty
scared. I haven't really been in a plane

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,040
that small before.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,660
This is the only time
I've ever actually checked the life vest under a seat.

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,219
As we were going into the Savusavu Airport — 
well, it's called an airport.

19
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,549
There was a tiny little shack
that was the airport, but it was

20
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,480
basically a cow pasture.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,360
From there, 
off to Namale.

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,800
Namale is Tony Robbins' resort.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,250
This was one of his first major
investments, so he was able to get it

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,500
kind of cheap and then over the last 30
years, he's just really built it up into

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,520
a beautiful resort that's basically
in the middle of the jungle

26
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,020
by a bunch of coral reef.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,460
One of our first stops was
Tony's house.

28
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,600
Tony: Well, nice to see you on the other side of the world. (Laughs)

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
How are ya?
Rich: Nice to see you, Tony.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,540
Tony: Great. Good to see you too.
Come on in.

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,340
He basically has this

32
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,940
decked out hut in like the secluded part
of his resort.

33
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,480
Tony: You ready for my morning routine?
Rich: Yes, perfect

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,420
So Tony has this really
elaborate morning routine. I thought he

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,569
was going to kind of give us a demo or
something, but he said, 'Why would I give

36
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,720
you a demo when I could just guide you
through the whole thing yourself?'

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,160
So we started off with priming, which is kind
of like his take on meditation and yoga.

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,380
Tony: Begin to think of a moment in your life
you could feel really grateful for if

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,100
you wanted to. Enjoy it. Feel it. 
Fill up with it.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,320
Yeah I'll admit it was pretty weird

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,010
but I just gave in totally and was like

42
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,040
you know what, we came all the way to
Fiji, I'm just gonna go all in.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,510
So after his priming exercise, Tony took
us inside and I was surprised to see his

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,720
personal trainer Billy, this incredibly
energetic guy who's always laughing.

45
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,389
He made this little cocktail that was
called like an adrenal cocktail or

46
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:21,700
something. I didn't really know what it
was, but I just decided to drink it.

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,980
Tony: How was that?
Rich: Tastes pretty good (Laughs)

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,000
And that fueled me for the rest of the
day and everything that was to come.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,900
So next, it's time to check out what Billy
and Tony called the "electric taco."

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Billy: We're gonna work as a team. You tell me when
you feel it — even if it doesn't hurt —

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,840
just tell me when you first feel it, and we'll
gradually go up.

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,760
Rich: So right now, it feels like I'm getting
punched in the chest on both sides.

53
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,620
Tony was saying that this is something that
he does essentially every morning and it

54
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,700
basically stimulates your muscles to the
point where it feels like you're getting

55
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,609
a deep tissue massage. I immediately felt
all of the tightness in my back first

56
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,440
get really, really intense and then
loosen up.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,520
After the electric taco, we went to

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,940
Tony's personal gym. It was
filled with these weird contraptions

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,120
that looked kind of like something out
of "Saw" or a medieval torture chamber.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,940
Tony: If you want, we'll put you on the little
torture machine.

61
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,640
Full tilt. All the way.
Push as hard as you can.

62
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,860
The most
medieval looking of all of these things

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,540
is called the four-minute machine.

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,940
Tony: Push! Push! Push! Push! Push!

65
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,140
Around two minutes in, I really didn't

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,000
think that I could do it.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,460
Tony: Whatever you got! This is it!

68
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,420
Tony was screaming at me 
and I just felt like

69
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,200
I couldn't embarrass myself there. So just
driven by ego, I had to finish it.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Billy: Push!
Yes!

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,940
Tony: Isn't that wild?

72
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,180
It felt as if I had spent like an hour in the
gym.

73
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,699
Tony took us to the next thing that

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,500
he does every morning, which is

75
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,240
spend some time in the sauna 
and then a cold plunge.

76
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,199
To be honest, it felt great. Basically,
it's part of the workout because your

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,280
heart rate is accelerated the whole time.

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,889
Tony: You'll find your body really relaxing

79
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,820
because you've taken it to such extremes.
You'll drop down to a different level.

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,100
Like if you went and meditated now, 
you're gonna meditate deep.

81
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,800
So the week went by.

82
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,039
We got some great opportunities to see Tony in
action and coaching entrepreneurs.

83
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,580
We realized that we needed some extra
footage that we didn't get to kind of

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,140
just wrap everything up 
before we headed back home.

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,440
Tony: How you guys doing?

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,540
We were really only expecting 5 or 10 minutes.

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,539
He starts giving us a
tour and after just a few minutes, he

88
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,620
points out something and says

89
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,660
Tony: Did you go up
to the waterfall?

90
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,540
Rich: Have we gone to the waterfall?
Reporter: No we didn't make it to the waterfall.

91
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,680
Tony: OK we should run you up to the
waterfall. Will you call them and ask

92
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,660
them if they've got — 
my car's broken down, I think

93
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,760
I don't know if I can fit in this car.

94
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,060
So a five-minute trip for extra footage

95
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,800
ended up being an adventure that 
lasted over an hour.

96
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,800
Tony: I love this.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,940
At the top of this mountain
was a waterfall.

98
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,800
I really wasn't expecting him to just
dive into the water

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
throw his shirt off

100
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,520
and then scream like Tarzan.

101
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,380
(Tony yells)

102
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,280
I dove into the water after Tony.

103
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,460
It's a pretty surreal experience.

104
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,060
What I got from this
last adventure was that Tony is a guy

105
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,080
who if you give him five minutes and
you're able to get in front of him

106
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,300
if he's able to 
make a connection with someone

107
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,780
he's really going to engage fully.

108
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,960
In Fiji, you could tell that he's
like completely relaxed. This is his home turf.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,020
And I could see that he still kind
of had like a

110
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,780
kids approach to the whole thing.

111
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,560
Tony: Are we on time? Am I late?

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,400
They had to catch a flight to Australia.

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,420
A group of people who worked at Namale
had formed a semicircle

114
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,840
to sing a traditional Fiji farewell song.

115
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,060
Tony: Time to say goodbye again. 
I'm so sorry

116
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,240
but I look forward to coming back home 
to see all the family again.

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,800
It's been a beautiful, beautiful trip. Bula vinaka.

118
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,680
(Singing)

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,120
When you're in Tony's presence, you kind
of get sucked into this —

120
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,700
He's got a very magnetic personality.

121
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,540
Totally, he's not for everyone.

122
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,940
There are plenty of people who 
wouldn't be into this stuff.

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,160
Whether it's through his work 
or his philanthropy

124
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm convinced that Tony is
someone who is a genuine guy.

125
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,120
Yes, he's able to make a ton of money because he
has very clearly defined business goals

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,000
but everything that he's preaching
and teaching people, he genuinely

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,880
believes himself. So after this trip, I've
become convinced that anything in his

128
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,240
material that he's teaching, this is
something that he fully believes.

129
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,060
He's fully invested in.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,960
And I think that
makes a big difference

131
00:08:17,960 --> 00:00:00,000
whether you're in or whether you're out.
