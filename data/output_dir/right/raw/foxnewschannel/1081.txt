00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,911
IT'S FILTHY, FULL OF WASTE AND

7
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,179
WE SAID AS MUCH ON THE SHOW.

8
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,181
HAVE YOU BEEN TO PENN STATION

9
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:30,849
RECENTLY?

10
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:31,516
IT'S LIKE A HOMELESS SHELTER

11
00:00:31,516 --> 00:00:33,585
IT'S DISGUSTING.

12
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,720
YOUR GIVING SPEECHES, TRUMP IS

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,189
BAD AND IGNORE THE GUY LIVING

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,769
TO OUR SURPRISE AND HAPPINESS,

19
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,604
AMTRAK CALLED US AND SAID THEY

00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:53,405
HAD REVAMPED THE PLACE AND

21
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,573
CLEANED UP ITS MEN'S ROOMS.

22
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,676
WE WANTED TO SEE IF THAT WAS

23
00:00:57,676 --> 00:00:59,010
TRUE SO WE SENT THE INTREPID

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,945
BRETT MARSON TO INVESTIGATE,

25
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:02,614

3:00 A.M.

37
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,803
HOW COULD WE PASS THAT UP IN THE

TECHNOLOGY IS FUN.

43
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:45,523
>> PENN STATION IS NOTORIOUS FOR

44
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,226
ITS PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS,

45
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,594

>> NO CHANCE OF GETTING AN ARM

57
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,386
OR LEG UNDER THAT THING.

58
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:16,187
AMTRAK WAS EASIER TO TELL US HOW

59
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,189
THEY EVOLVED, HOW PENN STATION

60
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,357
