1
00:00:03,145 --> 00:00:05,113
SHE WILL BE BACK WHEN THE

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:07,549
HEARING RESUMES ABOUT 10 MINUTES

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,150
FROM NOW.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,285
>> Martha: WE ARE TOLD

5
00:00:10,285 --> 00:00:10,919
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:13,722
WATCHING CLOSELY.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,356
THAT U.N. MEETINGS HE WAS

8
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:17,125
RESIGNING OVER, JOHN ROBERTS

9
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,695
JOINS US FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

10
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,296
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT

11
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:23,198
THE REACTION OR THE MOOD OVER

12
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:23,565
THERE?

13
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,668
>> RIGHT NOW THE MOOD IS WAIT

14
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,135
AND SEE.

15
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:28,337
I THINK THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK

16
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,272
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT AN

17
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:32,975
HOUR AGO AND WENT INTO THE

18
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:33,909
RESIDENCE, HE HAD BEEN WATCHING

19
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,579
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE.

20
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,914
I DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

21
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,015
IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHICH MEANS

22
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,750
HE COULD STILL BE UP IN THE

23
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,319
RESIDENCE WATCHING.

24
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,521
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE

25
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:48,090
PRESIDENT'S IS DOING AT THIS

26
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,725
PARTICULAR MOMENT.

27
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:51,226
THERE WERE SOME REPORTS THAT THE

28
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,128
PRESIDENT IS RAGING ABOUT THE

29
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,330
TESTIMONY, I'M TOLD THAT'S NOT

30
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:55,631
TRUE.

31
00:00:55,631 --> 00:00:58,534
HIS REACTION TO WHAT HE'S BEEN

32
00:00:58,534 --> 00:00:59,034
SEEING, IT WAS NOT

33
00:00:59,034 --> 00:00:59,768
CHARACTERIZED.

34
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,736
THE PERSON I TALKED TO SAID WE

35
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:01,970
WILL WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE

36
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,307
DAY UNTIL WE COMMENT.

37
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:06,341
I GET A SENSE THAT THE PEOPLE

38
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,945
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHO ARE

39
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:10,913
MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AS WELL AS

40
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:12,481
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN

41
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,215
THE CONFIRMATION PROCEEDINGS OF

42
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:18,387
BRETT KAVANAUGH ARE LOOKING AT

43
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:23,625
THIS AS AN EMOTION VERSUS FACT

44
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,194
TYPE OF SCENARIO, THAT THERE ARE

45
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,363
A LOT OF GAPS IN HER

46
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:28,063
RECOLLECTION OF WHAT HAPPENED

47
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:31,166
BACK IN AND AROUND 1982.

48
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,935
BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS VERY

49
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:33,602
EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT AND ONE

50
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:37,006
PERSON I TALKED TO HERE AT THE

51
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:37,740
WHITE HOUSE DESCRIBED HER AS A

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,308
VERY CREDIBLE WITNESS.

53
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:43,012
THEY KNOW THAT SOME DAMAGE IS

54
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:45,047
BEING DONE TO THEIR NOMINEE

55
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,082
RIGHT NOW AND IT REALLY WILL BE

56
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,918
UP TO BRETT KAVANAUGH TO PUSH

57
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,753
BACK IN A COMPELLING WAY AGAINST

58
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:53,322
WHAT IS BEING SAID THIS MORNING.

59
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,957
WHAT IS GOING TO GET DOWN TO IS

60
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:55,958
WHAT MANY OF YOUR ANALYSTS HAVE

61
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:59,729
BEEN SAYING THIS MORNING, 11

62
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,463
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO DECIDE

63
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:02,065
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO VOTE

64
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,366
FOR THIS NOMINEE BECAUSE YOU

65
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,333
ALREADY HAVE TEN DEMOCRATS WHO

66
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,936
HAVE DECIDED THEY ARE NOT GOING

67
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:08,604
TO VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

68
00:02:08,604 --> 00:02:11,140
I THINK AT THIS POINT THE JURY

69
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,342
IS OUT ON HOW THIS IS GOING.

70
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,078
THEY CLEARLY THINK THAT SHE HAS

71
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,014
BEEN A CREDIBLE WITNESS FOR THE

72
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:18,715
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND NOW

73
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:21,784
LET'S SEE AFTER SHE FINISHES UP

74
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:22,719
WHAT BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS TO SAY

75
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,520
WHEN THEY COME BACK ON THE OTHER

76
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,821
SIDE.

77
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:25,521
>> Bret: THERE'S ANOTHER EVENT

78
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,757
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN TODAY THAT

79
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:29,325
WAS GOING TO BE BIG NEWS TODAY

80
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,293
AND THAT IS THE PRESIDENT

81
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:34,197
MEETING WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN, THE

82
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:42,539
PRESIDENT TWEETING OUT...

83
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,007
OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A CHOICE TO

84
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,009
PUT THE FOCUS BACK ON BRETT

85
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:48,111
KAVANAUGH.

86
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:50,146
>> WHAT WE HEARD EARLIER THIS

87
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:52,015
WEEK AFTER THE WHOLE KERFUFFLE

88
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:52,749
ON WHETHER ROSENSTEIN WAS GOING

89
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:55,518
TO GET FIRED ON MONDAY, THE

90
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,620
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO MEET ON

91
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,157
THURSDAY, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING

92
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:01,824
ELSE THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY

93
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,927
WANTS TO PAY ATTENTION TO ON

94
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:04,294
THURSDAY?

95
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:07,730
THE PRESIDENT DID TALK TO

96
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,665
ROSENSTEIN, EITHER JUST BEFORE

97
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:09,933
HE LEFT NEW YORK OR ON THE WAY

98
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,634
HERE AND SAID LET'S PUSH IT OFF

99
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,770
UNTIL NEXT WEEK, THERE'S TOO

100
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,771
MUCH GOING ON.

101
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,538
THE SENSE WE GOT YESTERDAY WAS

102
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:18,508
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, ROSENSTEIN

103
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,709
MAY KEEP HIS JOB.

104
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:20,476
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S NOT HIS

105
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:23,046
PREFERENCE TO FIRE HIM.

106
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:24,247
I THINK WITH THE PRESIDENT WANTS

107
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,483
TO DO IS HAVE A GOOD, LONG CHAT

108
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:28,485
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS GOING ON

109
00:03:28,485 --> 00:03:31,354
LAST YEAR.

110
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:32,088
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" STORY THAT

111
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,924
WAS OUT LAST WEEK SAID

112
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:36,026
ROSENSTEIN WAS TRYING TO GET

113
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,827
SUPPORT FOR THE 20 FOR THE

114
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:38,595
AMENDMENT REMOVAL OF THE

115
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,130
PRESIDENT, GOING SO FAR AS TO

116
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,832
WHERE A WIRE TO GET EVIDENCE ON

117
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,334
HIM.

118
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,069
BY THE WAY, WE DID FIND OUT AS

119
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,706
WELL THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT WE

120
00:03:49,706 --> 00:00:00,000
DIDN'T TO KAVANAUGH THIS MORNING
