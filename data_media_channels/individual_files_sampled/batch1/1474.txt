in the weeks following Hurricane Maria more than 30,000 storm weary Puerto Ricans registered at this Disaster Relief Center at Orlando's airport u.s. citizens by birth they came to Florida looking for help months later many are still in limbo like hundreds of others Naomi Gonzalez has been stuck in a hotel since January but time is running out federal assistance programs are temporary and Naomi has nowhere else to go nobody understands what we're feeling okay because many people there in their homes they're okay they could laugh they they've got their place but when you don't have a place well it it gets to you it's really tough for families that have already been in these hotels for months there's the constant fear that government aid will end and that is inevitable many simply don't have anything to go back to in Puerto Rico but for those that want to make a life here there's an even bigger problem 97% of all rental accommodation is already filled that that remains it's prohibitively expensive we're getting calls from people who care about others Orange County's commissioner says resources are stretched and many evacuate all joys but to stay faced an uncertain future when you lose everything and you can't pay your mortgage and now your credits getting ruined and now you're here in Orange County you're trying to find an apartment they're looking at your credit scores and you can't get approved that's just a domino effect from something that happened to them six months ago so what's happened who do people normally request when they come to the country the Community Hope Center in Kissimmee has helped some families find homes but say they too can't help everyone resources in this part of Florida already dealing with an exodus of Puerto Ricans who left before the storm unlimited as they come in the expectations for the families I feel may be higher than what we actually can provide at times I know that there's there's huge frustration and I know that there is just there's hurt and trauma Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last September but the island is still struggling those that came to Florida were looking for a new start many are still waiting and the gallic are aljazeera Simmi Florida
