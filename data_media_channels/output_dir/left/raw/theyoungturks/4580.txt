1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,830
>> HOBBY LOBBY IS BACK IN THE
NEWS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,630
ON A LIMB AND SAY THIS IS THE
WEIRDEST REASON TO BE IN THE

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,190
NEWS THAT I CAN THINK OF.

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,730
THEY
WERE CAUGHT TRYING TO IMPORT

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:19,320
$1.6 MILLION WORTH OF ANCIENT
ARTIFACTS, THEY GOT CAUGHT FOR

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,410
BECAUSE THINGS WERE LABELED
WEIRD.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,760
THEY ARE BEING FORCED TO

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,850
PAY $3 MILLION IN FINES, GIVE
ALL OF THE ARTIFACTS BACK TO THE

9
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,930
GOVERNMENT, AND CHANGE THEIR
WAYS TO MAKE SURE WHEN THEY ARE

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,320
IMPORTING ANCIENT ARTIFACTS THEY
DO IT TO THE WAYS OF CUSTOMS AND

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,890
BORDER PATROL.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:01:02,579
THIS ALL STARTED
BACK 

13
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,930
IN 2010.

14
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:49,590
JUST SO YOU KNOW

15
00:01:49,590 --> 00:02:06,950
THEY PROCEEDED WITH THIS DESPITE

16
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:23,150
THE MANY 

17
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:32,109
RED FLAGS.

18
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:43,220
>> IT IS A REALLY SERIOUS CRIME
IF YOU BUY AN ARTIFACT THAT IS

19
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,830
ACTUALLY STATE PROPERTY OF
ANOTHER GOVERNMENT.

20
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,220
SO WHEN THEY

21
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:55,349
SAY SEND IT TO THE SEVEN
DIFFERENT BANK ACCOUNTS, OF

22
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,349
COURSE IT IS ILLEGAL.

23
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,910
>>ALSO THE PEOPLE WHO SHIPPED IT
LABELED IT STUFF NOT LIKE

24
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,739
ANCIENT ARTIFACTS ñ YOU NEED TO
LABEL IT WHAT IT IS SO THEY MAKE

25
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,280
SURE IT IS NOT LOOTED.

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,400
THEY JUST
LABELED IT CERAMICS, WHICH

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,650
TECHNICALLY IT IS, AND TILE
PIECES WHICH I GUESS SOME OF

28
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:26,510
THESE COULD BE CONSTRUED
AS THAT.

29
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,110
WHY ARE THEY BUYING ALL THIS
STUFF?

30
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,370
>> THAT IS THE BEST PART.

31
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,030
SINCE
2009 HOBBY LOBBY ñ YOU GUYS

32
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,060
MIGHT REMEMBER THEM.

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,400
THEY WANTED
TO IMPOSE THEIR RELIGION ON

34
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,540
THEIR EMPLOYEES.

35
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,740
THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO COVER INSURANCE THAT

36
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,860
COVERS ABORTIONS BECAUSE JESUS
DIDN'T LIKE ABORTIONS, ALTHOUGH

37
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,370
HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. 2009
BECAUSE THEY LOVED JESUS AND THE

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,569
BIBLE, THEY STARTED BUYING
HISTORICAL BIBLES AND OTHER

39
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:00,569
ARTIFACTS.

40
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,140
SO FAR, GREAT, NO
PROBLEM.

41
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,010
IT TURNS OUT THEY GOT

42
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,240
REALLY INTO IT AND STARTED
BUYING MORE AND MORE.

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
THEN THEY

44
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,029
STARTED DOING IT LEGALLY
HERE, WHICH THEY HAVE

45
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:24,240
ADMITTED.FOR SOMEONE WHO IS
PASSIONATE ABOUT THE BIBLE, I'M

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,100
PRETTY SURE THOU SHALT NOT STEAL
IS IN THE BIBLE.

47
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,119
IT IS SUCH A

48
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:40,779
PERFECT MICROCOSM OF 
A

49
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:45,439
FUNDAMENTALIST IDEOLOGY.

50
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,189
>> IF IT WAS PLACED THERE BY
GIDEONS IN THE HOTEL ROOM,

51
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,299
I'M SURE THEY WOULD TAKE IT.

52
00:04:52,299 --> 00:05:01,270
>> IF YOU STILL IMPORTANT
ARTIFACTS AND LIE ABOUT IT ON

53
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,159
PURPOSE, THAT IS PRETTY
UNCHRISTIAN.

54
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,729
>> LET'S GO TO GRAPHICS SEVEN.

55
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,490
THIS IS WHAT HOBBY LOBBY HAS

56
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:21,819
AGREED TO IN THE WAKE 

57
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:26,449
OF THIS.

58
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:50,259
IS 
SO 

59
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,659
FRUSTRATING ñ HEY, YOU

60
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,249
WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BIRTH
CONTROL BUT WE HAVE $1.6 MILLION

61
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,360
TO SPEND ON MESOPOTAMIAN
CUNEIFORM.

62
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:16,779
>> HE'S RIGHT, HE MAKES IT SEEM
LIKE IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

63
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,740
YOU HAD AN ANCIENT ARTIFACT THAT
YOU DISPLAYED IN A SUPER WEIRD

64
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,270
WAY, AND WE MISLABELED AND
SENT IT OVER HERE.

65
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,759
OOPS.

66
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,470
GUESS WE WON'T MAKE THAT HONEST
MISTAKE AGAIN.

67
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,490
>> WHERE THESE GO WHEN THEY GET
CONFISCATED BY THE GOVERNMENT?

68
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,229
>> I HOPE THEY WOULD HAVE A
PROCESS BY WHICH THEY

69
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,300
DETERMINE WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAME
FROM AND RETURN IT.

70
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,819
>>PART OF ME HOPES TO GET PUT ON
A FORKLIFT AND GETS PUT NEXT TO

71
00:06:43,819 --> 00:07:09,270
THE ARK OF THE COVENANT LIKE THE
LAST SCENE IN THE RAIDERS

72
00:07:09,270 --> 00:00:00,000
OF THE LOST ARK.
