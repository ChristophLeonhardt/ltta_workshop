it's called cooking fever and it kind of
reminds us of when we used to work it
good
McDonald guys guess we used to work at
Mac because it's our first job and
Olympia it reminds us of it because you
are actually serving customers and these
customers get angry in fact as my
customers used to grab like you're in a
kitchen and you're like creating burgers
and hotdogs and you have to serve the
customers and you have a certain amount
of time to get the food out to them it's
one of those challenging games it's like
you just get addicted any wanna keep
complaining levels because each level
you get like a new food and you get
different customers wanting different
things so it's kind of stressful but
it's like a positive stress if you know
what I mean it starts up easier to and
then it gets harder which is so good any
my gosh I just updated my kitchen and
the patties in the sauce
being completely thankful for me I spend
a lot of money guys in my kitchen
oh my god I'm betting it Betty I
actually don't even put tomato and you
don't like about it and then you can't
like get rid of it you have to just wait
