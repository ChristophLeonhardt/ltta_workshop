1
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:14,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">gee thanks for being with us today what</font>

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,920
was the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> vision behind break and</font>

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,570
how has that evolved I think you guys

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,430
launched in 2005 ribbon around since

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,060
2005 yeah so originally we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> online space and realized there was</font>

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,840
opportunity to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new brand for</font>

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,510
young men at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the websites for</font>

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,790
maximum Comedy Central spike were really

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,530
underwhelming and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought if we could</font>

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,820
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there is great</font>

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,340
content and an attitude and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice that</font>

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,200
really resonated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people we'd be</font>

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,460
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aggregate a large audience by</font>

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,860
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're still more</font>

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,270
or less true to that vision editorially

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,700
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so seventy percent I think</font>

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're your viewership is is male</font>

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,649
between the ages of what 18 and 34<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote</font>

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,030
that has to be pretty attractive to

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,059
advertisers absolutely I think starting

22
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> break in 05 we really have done is</font>

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,260
take our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to program editorially</font>

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,940
for them and attract large audiences<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,519
guys and try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more broadly</font>

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,500
appeal to advertisers as well by doing

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">it not just in video but also in</font>

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,590
editorial and whatnot so over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

29
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,850
four years of companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> really evolved</font>

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,229
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> being just that one property of</font>

31
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Frankcom to a suite of eight properties</font>

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,009
that reach over 30 million unique

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,900
visitors a month all still targeting the

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,310
young male audience so how did

35
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,869
advertising hold up then last year I

36
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean people spend their dollars towards</font>

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
higher CPM so maybe giving you more

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,710
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> than then say other allotments in</font>

39
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,000
their budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely I think a</font>

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,890
revenue is up almost 40% last year and i

41
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,720
think it was in large part driven by a

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,240
recognition that we really do understand

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,799
this young male audience and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,479
can offer deep integrations across our

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,759
properties but we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we</font>

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,170
operate the fifth largest video network

47
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,780
the opportunity to offer scale and reach

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency to them from that aspect</font>

49
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,829
as well so so advertising is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are</font>

50
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:51,149
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> revenue streams what are the other</font>

51
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,040
revenue streams advertising is up till

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
now our primary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> soul revenue stream</font>

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,549
every once in a while we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually create</font>

54
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,799
and acquire a lot of content with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,939
in-house production group that is

56
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,399
actively producing acquiring and

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,619
licensing<font color="#CCCCCC"> user-generated content and</font>

58
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,090
then also making a vertical content and

59
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,710
we do license that out to other people

60
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,239
as well from using television across the

61
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:09,750
world

62
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,240
and a small part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business yeah</font>

63
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,950
what are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> break media's properties</font>

64
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,950
and publishers so the largest site

65
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,780
outside of break com is a lifestyle site

66
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,370
made man which we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> in june of</font>

67
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,800
last year we really identified a market

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,070
niche sort of the details GQ aspects of

69
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,900
the print business weren't really being

70
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,940
well translated to the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

71
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,200
hired a bunch of staff to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
literally create a men's lifestyle site

73
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,470
online which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done very well hitting</font>

74
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,700
almost two and a half million uniques

75
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,920
last month our<font color="#CCCCCC"> humorous side holy taco</font>

76
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,420
is probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next largest after that</font>

77
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,730
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just again young men</font>

78
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,489
attitude all humor base and that has

79
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,720
about two announcement repeats games

80
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,690
entertainment yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our other sites</font>

81
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,310
are and we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> NASCAR site called all</font>

82
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,200
left turns and mixed martial arts site

83
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
called cage potato<font color="#E5E5E5"> entertainment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sex</font>

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
called screen junkies we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

85
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,050
essentially is identify verticals where

86
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,760
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's both a user and an</font>

87
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,340
advertiser opportunity and build<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 pole</font>

88
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,570
properties in each of those verticals

89
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,310
and then we also partner with other

90
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,510
leading publishers in each of those

91
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,220
areas to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them monetize it more</font>

92
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,260
effectively so is there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest in</font>

93
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,209
going outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your core audience base</font>

94
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,549
or there you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> women's sites already</font>

95
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,230
out there that are successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the glam</font>

96
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,760
sand yeah why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,230
programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and editorial standpoint</font>

98
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,640
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people serving other</font>

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
markets but<font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly we just do what we</font>

100
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,780
do really well from a program editorial

101
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,000
standpoint for men I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as we look</font>

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,709
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our video network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business where</font>

103
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,780
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> were the fifth largest we do</font>

104
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,160
attract a broader audience and our

105
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,900
potential reaches much larger and other

106
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,940
demos as well there were servicing

107
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,140
advertisers who are interested in

108
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,670
reaching a different segments of the

109
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,230
male audience in particular and also

110
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,790
occasionally those who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

111
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,620
reaching females again like we have the

112
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,329
inventory we have they reach four reach

113
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,070
and frequency level but are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

114
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,660
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a fairly large internal content</font>

115
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">team makes videos that writes articles</font>

116
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,070
that's all young male oriented and

117
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,720
that's where the primary bulk of our

118
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,760
research about what people want is based

119
00:03:56,760 --> 00:00:00,000
on great thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> t thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
