I want us all to just react to this out of the gate because yeah go to you first both the president's tweets which are definitely crafted by someone I shouldn't say definitely they don't sound like the president's normal let it rip tweets and even rod Rosen Stein's response there seems to be lots of if and legalese like how do you read all of this well a couple different ways first of all rod Rosen's town I think is trying to move on from this and he's trying to manage a situation that's very difficult and potentially destructive and he's doing it in a way where I think he doesn't think this is the the sword to fall on to defend the rule of law and because there is actually no evidence right now that anything was done improperly for political purposes the president is right you cannot investigate for political purposes but one would think if this is not a situation like with the Muller investigation where we don't know very much if something is done for political purposes related to the 2016 election the only way that could have happened is if we knew about it before the 2016 election so this is not oh maybe it happened maybe it didn't and therefore what I think rod Rosen Stein is doing is he's just sort of folding it into an ongoing Inspector General issue he's not confronting the president he's building his credibility he's seeming amiable and seeming seemingly you know able to placate the president on the one hand and save the fight for another day if it ever comes Sam what's your take here because as the president continues to call this a witch-hunt you've got Paul mounted for its son-in-law who is pleading guilty as a Friday you've got the Skadden Arps lawyer already in jail and as far as pleading guilty take your pick you want to go Mike Flynn or you want to go George papadopolis nothing doing with Russian collusion any of those indictments I'm sorry having new and even the Russian indictments by the way they indicted companies that didn't exist this lawyer is picking them apart he's saying he didn't fall federal rules and procedures but I just wanna go back to rows and see I think what Rosen Singh did is a guy it's not know about Rosenstein Rob Rosen Stein okay Ron excuse me I hope he's not upset I think he did the exactly correct thing because what we need to find out is I have a big issue and I think Americans need to know how many of these informants were planted because I don't believe and maybe I'm wrong there was only one I think that they probably tried multiple if they were worried that there was an intelligence of Russian intelligence operation going into the campaign I'm sure they didn't just try this guy who wasn't successful at it and I think that we should know that I don't think there's a problem why why should we know that though why shouldn't we because it's an confidential investigation based on evidence and based on some sort of evidence by the way that is that started this whole thing besides the fact that Comey leaked out his memos for the special counsel it's evidence going into the fact that he was going to continue to investigate the president for his election so I think we need to know how the FBI conducted itself I don't think that there's anything wrong with the American people knowing that I don't you know well there is something wrong with the American people knowing about confidential informants and what the FBI director ray said at that hearing last Wednesday is exactly right it's not just this particular person or anyone else in the particular investigation of this of the Muller probe it relates to human sources which are the lifeblood of the FBI and the CIA particularly in the counterintelligence realm and if you cannot as a former law enforcement official if you cannot guarantee to potential cooperating witnesses or confidential informants that they their identity will remain confidential then you we lose and you do not get people to cooperate you do not get people to give us information and that is harming the signal security of our country we had a very good point exactly the FBI was running a counterintelligence operation against the presidential campaign it originally was a counterintelligence investigation and then as with many counterintelligence investigation when there are when there evidence of crimes arise if they then bring in the criminal side of the FBI to investigate it from a criminal standpoint and they try to put a spy into the campaign they might call them a spy you'll say yeah that's right but it doesn't matter I mean you can call it a spy you can call an informant it's a semantic difference that's a perfectly permissible law enforcement tactic that is used in thousands of cases around the country if they put a spy in for political purposes I 100% agree with you if there was a you call it a spy I'll call it a spy if they put an informant in because they wanted to sabotage the campaign that is completely improper mm-hmm but don't you agree Sam that if they did that we would have heard about this investigation prior to the election I don't necessarily know that but I would agree with you I hope we would how would it have been political otherwise how would it well look Comey in his book this book I had to read unfortunately because I get called into the grand jury this was like the worst book I've ever read but call me writes that he made a political decision when he held the press conference on Hillary Clinton because he assumed that she was going to win the election and he wanted to give her a clean bill of health I can only then assume because of commis own words that he assumed he would still be FBI acting director and he was going to then bring this investigation and bring charges against Donald Trump he obviously didn't like Donald Trump very much and it goes back to Comey and that's the issue that I agree with you if this was not political let's find out and I think that's Brad Rosen Stein is saying let's do that because we know what assuming does well here's what this story has done it has been successful at distracting us distracting us from this other story New York Times reporting this second meeting Donald Trump jr. had at Trump Tower this time with the representative from the UAE Eric Prince you know former head of Blackwater brother of Betsy DeVos and an Israeli social media specialist Ken what more are we learning about it because Donald Trump Jr's lawyer can say all day long Donald Trump decided not to work with him but they continued to have a relationship that social media specialist made his way into the White House after the president was elected so explain it all to us that's right Stephanie and we don't know the New York Times says they don't know and we don't know whether that plan was executed plan to to offer the campaign social media manipulation from a foreign source which would be a crime it's illegal for foreigners to participate to offer things of value to American presidential campaigns now the participants on the Trump side say that it was never executed but we don't know the answer to that but more importantly Stephanie I think you made the crucial point which is that the president is using this informant as a point of leverage to distract from this very dangerous turn that this this story suggests the investigation is taking which is Muller is now looking at whether other foreign countries intervene on behalf of Donald Trump specifically Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Jorge nadir who is at this meeting is cooperating with Muller he represented these governments this is hugely important because look at what these governments have gotten from the Trump administration Trump administration took their side in a dispute with Qatar they blockaded Qatar that the leader of Saudi Arabia put his political opponents in a de facto jail on the ritz-carlton there were allegations of torture the US government said very little about that the Trump administration has taken aside and if these governments were helping Donald Trump during election that is good that is a significant new development in this investigation it's pretty clear that Muller is focusing on that what position does this put Eric Prince in because just a few months ago I spoke to Eric Prince about that meeting in the Seychelles and he tried to make the argument to me oh it was just me and a Russian money manager it doesn't mean there's any ties to Putin first of all you and I both know there are no Russian money managers that are not tied to Putin and the fact that Nader is now cooperating with Muller certainly makes at least his comments to us our prince is disingenuous and to the House Intelligence Committee Stephanie which is hugely significant I mean look his story is looking rather shaky that's seychelles meeting robert muller is investigating whether that was a back channel between the UAE and the russians and the Trump campaign as part of this election interferential we don't know whether that's the case but that's certainly what the special counsel is looking at and if that is how it shakes out that's bad for Eric Prince because that's not what his story is Daniel what does it mean that Nader is now cooperating Ken's right that's hugely important when someone coop like George Nader either based on immunity or because he's admitted to crimes and is going to become a cooperating witness they have to disclose every single thing that they know about their own misconduct or anyone else so Bob Muller has presumably assuming Nader's telling the truth and they're not going to go forward with him unless they believe that he's telling the truth through corroborating evidence Bob Muller now knows every single conversation that George Nader ever had with Eric Prince with any Russian oligarchs or emissaries with the UAE with Saudi Arabia he has the full story from Jorge nadir who increasingly appears to be at the center of a lot of what was going on during and right after the election and the campaign and the election not just with the Saudis in the UAE but also with Russia and their reporting in the in the post or the times rather I also indicated that he regularly met with Trump campaign officials so we don't know what he said we don't know what he was doing but you have to assume that Bob Muller knows everything that occurred in all of those meetings all right Sam I don't know Roger stone you do he's a good friend of yours give us some insight if you can into Roger stones thinking because whether it was on Twitter or in interviews that went you know well into 2016 he was almost gleeful in sort of his WikiLeaks predictions and sort of talking about how he had an inside track with Julian Assange and I watched him yesterday on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd and I want to share what he said I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure time of the WikiLeaks disclosures Assange went on CNN in June and said he had a treasure trove of material on Hillary I did have a source who told me that Assange really had what he said he would have and then it would be delivered in October this is exactly why I continue to warn Roger that summer not to do that crap and it was crap you know what wasn't for him to start going around pretending that he had some insight for knowledge or any knowledge or any connection to what you think he was he was biessing back on 2016 that's what correct that's look it's look we're we're performance artists this is a game and he's going not a game it's in it for the election and it was presidential election is not a game sir well in any event he was going around saying that he had this knowledge like he had the inside track I had this conversation with him and the conversation was one I said at that point she's gonna win and she's gonna destroy you for this to even if the president wins he's not gonna help you when you start getting prosecuted for this and you get investigated for this because you know that's his MO and ice and then I said to him why do you want to be associated with Julian Assange with that said all public evidence and these two What did he say good question good question and you know he said to me he said well I don't believe that the Russians gave a signs and stuff and I said to him here's what I said I do believe they did by the way they said to him that's fine why don't you argue with 19 what was in nineteen intelligence agencies go argue with them have fun and this is what and this is what happened and I don't blame robert muller for looking into this but i do think in the end he'll see and this is a lead a legitimate lead for them to look into i at least from my participation everything that I've known considering the fact that he told me that there were going to be emails released from the Clinton Foundation of Clinton Foundation I had asked him if the rebenga Z he never told me anything about Podesta and about Podesta being hacked so that that's in if you've heard Assange who and by the way he's not a good source he's even complained that stone was doing this you know and this is the problem and I think that Rodger at the end of the day the other problem is is that when we have these special counsels is then you get like these forensics because I could tell you in my voluntary interview one of the first questions I got within the first 15 minutes or so to the best of my recollection was who the Roger still work for who do you know that Roger stones worked for and I said to and I said to this special prosecutor who truly professional I have no criticism of him or his abilities and I said sir do you mean who did he work for in 2015 in 2016 he goes no in your history of knowing Rogers and I'm powerful like who was he getting paid by meaning like since 2010 like and I didn't understand why that would be relevant to this investigation but of course it's relevant to the investigation you always want to understand what someone's motivated by and who pays them well I don't think that it was if for instance that they should have some forensic like this until you're into their financials if they were just looking into what I told him was that I've never seen or heard him working for Russians so that was or working for anybody like manna Ford or by the way Tony Podesta worked for okay then we'll leave it there I just want to make sure I understand you understand why given what Roger stone has said before you understand why mother would be interested in asking him questions but at the end of the day you think Roger will be found to be a big a guy who's full of baloney but nothing no wrongdoing on this yes I would say he's full of baloney he may not like me saying that he may attack me again but that's the best thing he has going for him here is that I think he was full of I won't send word when he started telling me baloney thank you very much Daniel Sam Ken we're gonna leave it there hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of
