of a new Bundestag president Wolfgang Chopra is facing an angry backlash after demanding that MPs do not use Twitter during sessions in the German parliament his Peter Oliver with more Wolfgang sure bled the experienced former Finance Minister and now president of the Bundestag has sent a message to his fellow parliamentarians stop tweeting during Bundestag sessions and they have responded and they're not happy with the Bundestag president gadgets for tweeting are unwanted you can watch the session live but we can't tweet anything about the plenary session so if you go outside the plenary Hall it will be okay our Facebook and Instagram fine to use what a handwritten letter be okay that makes no sense I won't let joy blare bump Sweden from the Bundestag heckling is a part of parliamentary debates at wit is silent heckling so what you shouldn't have to go outside for that I have little understanding why twittering is banned in the Bundestag transparency also includes commenting on current events Wolfgang schäuble laid out his problems with tweeting in a letter to all members of the Bundestag he said it was inappropriate didn't mention any other platforms by name but I think it's implied that he meant they weren't supposed to post things on Instagram or Facebook as well some of the wording raises a little smile he says in this letter that a parliamentarian should conduct themselves in a manner that is appropriate to their participation in a plenary session all very good things to say so here's some pictures of Wolfgang schäuble playing Sudoku on a tablet during one of those Bundestag sessions very much I do as I say not as I do from the Bundestag president there he's not alone in being caught on camera with a device in his hand Chancellor Merkel has been pictured quite a few times on the phone while she's in the chamber as well not tweeting though that's hardly Angela Merkel's style but the fact that schürrle has put out this letter it does show the tense state of German politics at the moment there's no government coalition talks broke down last last weekend at the beginning of this week coalition talks collapsing there is the slim hope of a grand coalition being rekindled but that is still a long way off and all the time that there's no government here in Germany we get closer to there being a call for fresh elections
