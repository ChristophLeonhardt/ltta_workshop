it's a classic fable that dates back
centuries but the moon I regret to
inform you is not actually made of
cheese but what if it worked
what if we could instantly transform all
160 sextillion pounds of the moon into a
floating sphere of cheese
well first since cheese is less dense
than rock it would expand quite a bit
the mantle now has hundreds of miles of
cheese crushing down upon it
the pressure will quickly separate the
cheese into its main components water
and proteins called caseins
the denser caseins will sink towards the
core while the water ascends to the
surface as the casings compress they'll
generate heat and prevent the water from
freezing as pressure and heat increase
near the core casings will be broken
down further into molecules of carbon
nitrogen and hydrogen nitrogen and
methane will rise and start to build a
thick atmosphere which will eventually
trap sunlight and warm the surface so
deep that vast oceans can form for a
short time the moon will look more like
earth from the desolate frozen desert we
have now but this paradise moon won't
last forever
the moon's gravity is too weak to
sustain an atmosphere so over time the
nitrogen and ethane will escape into
space without a protective atmosphere
the oceans will freeze and eventually
sublimate away what remains will be a
core of carbon with residual casings
peppering the service all of the moon
cheese will be lost to space and all
we'll have left is the shell of the
dairy paradise that once was
