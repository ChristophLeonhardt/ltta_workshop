so the Attorney General catching apparently catching the president's sickness this sort of lying disease to lie Diesel's not Lyme disease why mine why lying to the American people knowing that that lie will be proven by just pulling the video tape of him speaking before me was talking about I think he was quoting Bible verses last week I know saying that it was Jesus's will that families be separated in March she was saying that families were going to be separated and that was and then I he went to speak to evangelicals yesterday on the Christian broadcast networks a while that was never our intention to set what did separate well I don't understand what you were saying that maybe I can find another Bible verse to twist and wrench from its proper context let's listen to the sound right now okay it hasn't been good man the American people don't like the idea that we're separating families we never really intended to do that what we intended to do was to make sure that adults who bring children into the country are charged with the crime they've committed instead of giving that special group of adults immunity from prosecution which is what in effect we were doing so I think it's the right thing we'll work our way through it and try to do it in the most compassionate way possible no mr. attorney general you actually did intend to separate children from their families here's what you said when you meant it before take a look if you don't want your child to be separated then don't bring them across the border illegally it's not our fault our policies that can result in short-term separation of families is not unusual or unjustified and it's really a very short period of time having children does not give you immunity from arrest and prosecution bringing children with you doesn't guarantee you won't get prosecuted I would say due to the Apostle Paul and his clear and why's command in Romans 13 - oh babe of the government because God is obtained ordain the government for his purposes well really that was the plan and their plan was to separate it was a new plan and I think again the thing that is constantly maddening to any rational human being any person who actually gives a damn about the truth is that you actually could go on Twitter or Facebook or get texts from friends who were Trump supporters who actually pretend as if this were Barack Obama's policy or this were george w bush's policy and say well and saying all along oh we couldn't do anything he couldn't do anything to change this he couldn't do anything to change us and then with the stroke of a pen donald trump changes it and then they go thank god he changed it it's just you you can't you can't really even reason or debate with people who care so little about the truth in this administration Joe as we've shown time and time again words are completely disposable you can say one thing one day and come back the next day and say something completely different despite the fact it's all on tape the fact that despite the fact that it's all in the newspaper and that's exactly what Jeff Sessions did not only did they plan to separate families it was a stated strategy as a quote tough deterrent it was a way they were gonna stop people from crossing the border by separating from their children so it wasn't like he just threw that out there and now can unwind that that was the goal of this all along Mika well and now we have the effects the chaos the mystery behind where some of these children are where these babies are where the girls are who's with them what's happening to them will some never see their parents again I think there's some distinct possibilities but that that's possible they may never see their families again it is so chaotic and disorganized thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of around us to watch more for morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
