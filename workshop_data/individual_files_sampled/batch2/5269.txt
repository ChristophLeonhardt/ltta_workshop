our justice correspondent Pete Williams is standing by Pete we know that the Deputy Attorney General has been summoned to the White House what more do we know well here's what we're told the White House is saying that he is coming to the White House to resign what we're hearing in fact from the Justice Department is that he has been summoned to the White House and that if he's asked to resign he will refuse to do so and that what he's prepared to do is dis is to tell the chief of staff John Kelly with the person with whom is presumably meeting that if the president wants him out the president will have to fire him which of course the president has the authority to do so will this result this meeting result in one way or the other rod Rosenstein being out will it be a standoff nothing will happen or what it would appear that the president wants rod Rosenstein out one way or the other and that if he won't quit it does sound like the White House is prepared to fire him but we just don't know how that's going to go now it's as we've been saying here Craig it's more than just a senior official at the Justice Department which is unusual and newsworthy and important in and of itself but rod Rosenstein because jeff sessions has recused rod Rosenstein is the person running the russia investigation supervising the investigation he's the person that a that approves all the major moves by robert muller he's the person to whom Muller would issue a report and then the Deputy Attorney General would make a decision on whether to further that report to Congress make it public and so forth so the person in that job is pivotal to the Russia the future of the Russia investigation if Rosenstein is out then there's a question about who would take over supervising the Russia investigation and I think there are several options one of them is that Knoll Francisco who is currently the Solicitor General that's the government's top courthouse lawyer the person who oversees all basically all the government's litigating in court especially in the appeals courts in the Supreme Court whether he would take over he's a person who's been in private practice and it really enjoys the job of Solicitor General I think he would be a reluctant soldier if he was drafted for that job or what would someone else take the day-to-day overseeing of this of the deputy's job and someone else would oversee the rush investigation to be determined because we've never been in this situation before we've had very few special counsels in our history since the end of the Independent Counsel law and we've never had a situation like this so we they would be feeling their way through this but this this is a an important moment a crucial moment in the history of the Russia investigation and you know what we're gonna have here is in just another two months we're gonna have an entirely new set of leaders that the Justice Department appears a new deputy and my guess would be that Jeff sessions would be out after the midterm elections it certainly appears that that's his expectation and all of this happening as the White House is treading on eggshells deciding what to do about Brett Kavanaugh I must say this surprises me that the White House is willing to to break all this China as there were in this critical moment with the Cavanagh nomination given the importance that the president has put on the fact that he can get his nominees on the Supreme Court so it's a it's all these things coming together there are a lot of vectors pointing in one direction here I rarely hear Pete Williams say that there's something that surprises them so that's that that's that's noteworthy to be clear here hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
