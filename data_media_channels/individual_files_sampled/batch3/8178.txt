PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNING. Tucker: INTERESTING. MARK STEYN, GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANKS, TUCKER. Tucker: DEMOCRATS ARE UPSET ABOUT SPEECHES LIKE THAT AND ABOUT THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY ITSELF OF COURSE. BUT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, THEY HAVE CONSOLED THEMSELVES BY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE MID-TERMS. THE 2018 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION. THEY THOUGHT WE'RE GOING TO WIN BIG. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK POWER. THEY MAY. RECENT POLLS SHOW THAT DEMOCRATS ONE MASSIVE LEAD IS SHRINKING. NOW TO ALMOST NOTHING. A NEW POLL OVER AT CNN SHOWS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE ONLY A 3-POINT ADVANTAGE ON A GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT. IS THIS REAL? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? TOM BE VIN FOLLOWS THIS CAREFULLY AND JOINS US TONIGHT. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT, TOM? IS IT REAL? I THINK IT'S REAL, TUCKER. YOU GO BACK AND LOOK IN MID DECEMBER. THE DEMOCRATIC LEAD IN MID DECEMBER, WOULD YOU VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, DEMOCRATS HAD A 13-POINT LEAD. AS OF TODAY, IT'S DOWN TO 6. IN OUR REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE. THE CNN POLL WENT 16 POINTS DOWN TO THREE. ANOTHER POLL SHOWING IT DOWN TO ONE POINT. SO THIS IS REAL. IT IS JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE, IN 2006, WHEN DEMOCRATS WON 30 STATES, THEY FINISHED WITH A 7.9 PERCENTAGE LEAD. SO I THINK THEY'RE IN THAT RANGE WHERE IT'S MAKING THEM VERY NERVOUS. Tucker: SO REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN ASSUMING FOR MONTHS I TALKED TO THEM THAT THEY WOULD LOSE BIG AND NANCY PELOSI WOULD BE THE SPEAKER. NOW THEY HAVE A SHOT BUT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT VOTER INTENSITY ON THE LEFT IS STRONG. HOW MEANINGFUL IS THAT INTENSITY? IT'S MEANINGFUL, PARTICULARLY IN A MID-TERM ELECTION WHERE IT'S ABOUT TURNING OUT THE BASE. THE BECOMES HAVE HAD AN ADVANTAGE THERE. BUT BACK TO THE CNN POLL. THAT WAS ANOTHER FINDING THAT WAS DISTURBING FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY SHOWED THE REPUBLICAN INTENSITY IS UP NOW AND MATCHING THE LEVEL OF THE DEMOCRATS. IF THAT'S THE CASE, IT'S NOT AT ALL A SURE BET THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD TAKE BACK THE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER. Tucker: A LITTLE CONFUSING IN TRUMP'S PERSONAL APPROVAL NUMBERS ARE CONFUSING GIVEN THE STORMY DANIELS STORY, WHICH IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STORY EVER COVERED BY THE AMERICAN NEWS MEDIA, HAS DOMINATED THE COVERAGE FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS, MONTHS, I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN. THAT HASN'T HAD AN EFFECT. NO. IN FACT, IT'S THE OPPOSITE, TUCKER. IN MID DECEMBER WAS TRUMP'S LOW POINT IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS RATING. HIS AVERAGE WAS 37. HE'S AT 43.4. HE'S GAINED 6 1/2 POINTS OVER THE COURSE OF THAT PERIOD. AS YOU MENTIONED, THE ENTIRE TIME, IT'S THE STORMY DANIELS ONSLAUGHT. NOT ONLY HAS IT HURT HIS NUMBERS, HIS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN TICKING UPWARDS THE ENTIRE TIME. AGAIN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE DEMOCRATS. YOU TALK TO THEM. THEY'RE ANNOYED BY THIS. TALK TO NANCY PELOSI AND OTHERS, THEY SAY IT'S DISTRACTING FROM OUR MESSAGE. THEY WANT TO REACH VOTERS. VOTERS HAVE TUNED THAT OUT AND PAYING ATTENTION TO THE OTHER STUFF WHICH TRUMP HAS HAD A GOOD FEW WEEKS. Tucker: AMAZING. THEIR MESSAGE. WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO TELL ME WHAT THAT IS. I APPRECIATE IT, TOM. THANK YOU. YOU BET. Tucker: YOU JUST HEARD THE NUMBERS ON THE UPCOMING ELECTION ARE INTERESTING. THE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL AHEAD BUT NOT NEARLY AS POPULAR ACTION THEY WERE SIX MONTHS AGO. IT'S WEIRD THE PRESIDENT IS UNLIKED BY HALF THE COUNTRY. DEMOCRATS OUGHT TO BE WAY AHEAD. AS YOU JUST HEARD, THEY'RE NOT. WHY IS THAT? COULD IT BE THAT FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE, AND THEY'RE REAL, DEMOCRATS ARE PERCEIVED AS LESS APPEALING? LOOKS THAT WAY. THE QUESTION IS WHY. WE HAVE THEORIES. WE CAN SHOW YOU A MILLION EXAMPLES. HERE'S ONE FROM YESTERDAY THAT CAME TO MIND. WATCH AS THIS MSNBC PANEL, WHICH IS CLOSE TO A DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOCUS GROUP YOU'LL FIND, GUSHES OVER THE PORN LAWYER WHOSE EYES ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER. WATCH THIS. MICHAEL AVANETTI IS A BEAST. HE'S A BEAST. HE KEEPS POPPING DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF HIS FOLKS IN THE MOUTH. JOHN MEACHEM SAYS HE MAY BE THE SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC. HE KILLED THE NEWS OF THE IRAN DEAL IN ONE BIG STROKE. HE IS A MASTER OF THE MEDIA CYCLE. I OWE MICHAEL AVANETTI AN APOLOGY. I SAID I'VE SEEN YOU EVERYWHERE. I WAS WRONG, BROTHER. YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY. THE DEMOCRATS COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM YOU. YOU'RE MESSING WITH TRUMP A LOT MORE THAN THEY ARE. Tucker: HERE'S A POLITICAL RULE OF THEM. IN THE CREEPY PORN LAWYER IS THE SAVIOR OF THE REPUBLIC IN YOUR VIEW, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT TRYING VERY HARD TO MIDDLE AMERICA. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT. IN THE LAST 1 1/2 YEARS, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS DOUBLED DOWN ON EVER REBEHAVIOR THAT GOT TRUMP ELECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THEY PREFER ILLEGALS TO U.S. CITIZENS. THEY'RE OPEN ABOUT IT. IN SCHOOLS AND SPORTS, THE MILITARY, THEY DENOUNCE THE IDEA OF BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. THAT SOMETHING THAT EVERY CULTURE FROM ANCIENT EGYPT UNDERSTAND. TWO NIGHTS AGO, "THE NEW YORK TIMES" CRITICIZED MIKE POMPEO AND HIS TRIP TO NORTH KOREA. THEY RAN THE HEADLINE, AT A KEY MOMENT, TRUMP'S TOP DIPLOMAT IS A THOUSAND MILES AWAY LIKE IT'S A SIN. THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT IS TO SECURITY THE RELEASE OF THREE AMERICAN PRISONERS. THE TIMES IS NOT IMPRESSED BY THAT. MIKE POMPEO WORKS FOR TRUMP SO IT MUST BE BAD. WHAT EVER ELSE HE'S DONE, TRUMP HAS DRIVEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFF THE DEEP END AND IT'S SHOWING IN THE POLLS. AND CHRISTY, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A LONG TIME. SHE JOINS US TONIGHT. YOU'VE HEARD TOM BEVINS SAYING THEIR MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING AUTOMATIC. TRUTH IS IT'S BAD. IT'S MORE OF AN ANIMAL REACTION. WHATEVER THE MESSAGE IS, IT'S WORKING. LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL AND STATE ELECTIONS SINCE NOVEMBER 2016. DEMOCRATS HAVE FLIPPED 40 PLUS SEATS AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE. OFTEN IN DISTRICTS WHERE TRUMP WON BY 20 OR 30 POINTS. SO WE CAN QUIBBLE AND THE MESSAGE BUT WE CAN'T QUIBBLE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S WORKING. IT CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE. Tucker: TO SOME EXTENT, TRUMP IS LOATHED BY HALF THE POPULATION. IT'S HIS FIRST MID-TERM. HISTORICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO GET SEATS. THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE WAVE. ONE OF THE MESSAGES IS, THERE'S NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SEXES. BIOLOGICAL REALITY IS LIKE FAKE. NOBODY IS SAYING THAT. Tucker: WE NEED TO REORGANIZE SOCIETY. IT'S MORE RADICAL THAN ANYTHING TRUMP HAS SAID. SUGGEST YOU TO POINT ME TO THE CANDIDATE IS SAYING THAT. DEMOCRATS ARE BEING REASONABLE Tucker: WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR A DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR OFFICE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TO SAY THERE'S TWO BIOLOGICAL SEXES, MALE AND FEMALE? THAT'S IT. IF YOU SAID THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THEY TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? ARE YOU JOKING? THEY'RE THE ONES PUSHING THE CHANGES ON THE REST OF US, INCLUDING BATHROOM THING. YOU CAN'T SAY THAT IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I'M SERIOUS. IT'S REPUBLICANS DOING THE BATHROOM THING. NORTH CAROLINA, THAT WAS A ENTIRELY Tucker: NOBODY IMAGINED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO SEXES UNTIL 20 MINUTES AGO. IT WAS DEMOCRATS. IT'S A BIG CHANGE. MAYBE BIOLOGY ISN'TS REAL. IT'S NOT A MAINSTREAM POSITION. THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IT. DOES IT HELP? IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE ARGUMENTS THIS DEMOCRATS SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ANT IMPEACHMENT, STORMY DANIELS AND HER LAWYER. WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO. THERE'S NO MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE Tucker: REALLY? YOU CAN SAY AS A DEMOCRAT SERIOUS. I THINK IT'S RE-ORDERING SOCIETY IS A BIG DEAL. AND PRETENDING BIOLOGY IS FAKE, TOO. YOU COULD HAVE A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE SAYING THERE'S TWO BIOLOGICAL SEXES AND HE COULD GET AWAY WITH THAT? I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IS WHAT I'M SAYING. I THINK AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK BACK TO THE WAYS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN PERFORMING UP TO THIS POINTS, WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE DOING IS WORKING. THERE'S FAR NOR ENERGY, THERE'S MORE SMALL DOLLAR DONATIONS AND THAT LEADS TO MORE VOLUNTEERS AND LEADS TO A BETTER SLATE OF CANDIDATES IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. Tucker: A LOT OF IT IS TRUE. YOU'RE RIGHT. PROBABLY MORE ENERGY AND ALL
