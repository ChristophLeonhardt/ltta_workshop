"THE FIVE" ." WHO ARE THE LIBERALS BLAMING THE BRETT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION ON? WHO ARE THE LIBERALS BLAMING THE BRETT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION ON? THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THOSE FOUNDERS JUST AREN’T AS SMART AS ROB REINER? HOW IS IT THAT STATES EACH HAVE TWO SENATORS? NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE 25 EACH AND YOU ARE HOME, ZILCH. FAILING THAT, THERE’S ALWAYS IMPEACHMENT. DO YOU RULE OUT THIS IDEA OF IMPEACHING KAVANAUGH? THIS IMPEACHMENT THING, I AM FOCUSED ON THE HERE AND NOW. YOU WON’T RULE OUT IMPEACHMENT. I AM MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHICH IS GET CONTROL. Greg: WHY NOT JUST REAL "THE NEW YORK TIMES" CLAIMING KAVANAUGH ON GENDER TRADERS. WHITE WOMEN BENEFIT FROM PATRIARCHY BY TRADING ON THEIR WHITENESS TO MONOPOLIZE RESOURCES FOR MUTUAL GAIN. WHO TALKS LIKE THAT HAS A JOB? THE LEFT DEVOURS ITS OWN AS RAGE BOTS. YET AS THEY SHARPEN THE PITCHFORKS, DEMOCRATS HAVEN’T DISOWNED AVENATTI WHO USE WOMEN AS STEPPING-STONES. IT SEEMS WE ARE AT AN IMPASSE WHICH IS FRENCH FOR NOWHERE GOOD. ONE PARTY SAYS HE MUCH BELIEVE ALL ALLEGATIONS AND THE OTHER SAYS YOU MUST PRESUME INNOCENCE. ON ONE SIDE ARE THESE WOMEN AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THIS GAME. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION? IT IS SIMPLE. IF DEMOCRATS PREFER BELIEF OVER DUE PROCESS, PUT A RING ON EDGE. FROM HERE AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD BELIEVE ANY ALLEGATION AGAINST THEMSELVES BECAUSE 50% OF BELIEVING IS BETTER THAN NONE. NO PROCESS, JUST PUNISHMENT. THE REST OF US IDIOTS WILL RELY ON STUPID STUFF LIKE EVIDENCE AND DUE PROCESS. MAKE SENSE, DEMOCRATS? THE, THE PARTY OF PITCHFORKS. MAYBE THEN WE’LL WILL BELIEVE IT’S NOT JUST POLITICS. DAGAN, WELCOME TO THE SHOW. WE SHOULD HAVE J: THIS IS WHY THEY TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. THEIR AGENDA IS ANTI-TRUMP OR ANTIWOMAN. WHAT KIND OF SENATOR IS MAZIE HIRONO TO LET THE ANCHORMAN CULTURE LIKE THAT. Greg: HE WAS MAN-SPLAINING. THE DEMOCRATS ALWAYS OVERSTEPPED. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE HERE IS IT STRIKES EVEN MORE CLOSELY INTO THE CORE OF AMERICAN VALUES BECAUSE DUE PROCESS HAS BEEN THROWN OUT. THE IDEA OF FAIRNESS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN TRAMPLED ON AND IF YOU ARE A MAN, YOU ARE GUILTY COUNTRY HAS BEEN TRAMPLED ON AND IF YOU ARE A MAN, YOU ARE GUILTYUNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND IF YOU UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT AND IF YOU ARE A WOMAN, YOU JUST BETTER SHUT UP AND ACT AS AS A MONOL SHUT UP AND ACT AS AS A MONOT SHUT UP AND ACT AS AS A MONOI SHUT UP AND ACT AS AS A MONOC GROUP AND FOLLOW-UP THE DEMOCRATS TELL YOU. PEOPLE ARE REJECTING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD. Greg: JUAN, YOU LOOK AT NORTH DAKOTA AND SAY WHY DO THEY HAVE TWO SENATORS? YOU HAVE SAID THAT TO ME. I THINK IT’S A DIRECT QUOTE. YOU THINK THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR, RIGHT? THAT EACH STATE HAS TWO SENATORS WHEN THEY ARE LESS POPULATED. Juan: I LIKE IT. WHAT I DON’T LIKE AND I THINK WHAT I HAVE SAID HE WAS 18% OF THE COUNTRY IS REPRESENTED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE SENATE. IN OTHER WORDS, 82% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY THE MAJORITY. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THIS BOILS DOWN TO TEAR ANY. THAT WAS THE WORD YOU WERE SIDING BEFORE. IN THIS CASE, THE PEOPLE WHO MOST ENJOY TALK OF IMPEACHMENT ARE REPUBLICANS BECAUSE IT STIRS UP THEIR BASE. THEY ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT IT. LOOK AT THE LEADERSHIP ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SCHUMER AND PELOSI, THEY DON’T TALK ABOUT IT. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE, THE LEFT FLANK OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I AM TALKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY NEWLY ELECTED THEY HAVEN’T QUITE BEEN ELECTED YET BUT WHEN THERE’S ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE LIKE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, LISA PRESLEY, UP IN MASSACHUSETTS. THEY SAY LISTEN, IT’S TIME FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BE A STRONG, AS CONSISTENT, AS BULLISH AS YOU SAW FROM MITCH MCCONNELL WHEN HE RAN OVER EVERYBODY, HELD THE SENATE SEAT SORRY SUPREME COURT SEAT OPEN. Greg: THAT IS THE NEXT BLOCK. A Juan: IF REPUBLICANS PLAY HARDBALL, THEY SAY HEY, DEMOCRATS, STOP BEING SO SQUISHY. Greg: YOU END UP WITH A AVENATTI WHO GOES TOO FAR AND DANA I BET YOU HAVE A GOOD POINT ABOUT WHY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS IMPORTANT. IT’S A CLASSIC ARGUMENT. THEY WANT TO RELY ON A METROPOLITAN CANDIDATE AT THE EXPENSE OF SMALL TOWN RURAL AREAS, WHERE YOU ARE FROM. Dana: WYOMING HAS TWO SENATORS AND ONE REPRESENTATIVE SO I HAVE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I KEEP SEEING IT POP UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I NOTICED IT IN THOUSAND ZERO, BUSH V GORE. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ TWEETED THIS WEEKEND THAT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS RACIST. SHE SUGGESTED THE FOUNDING FATHERS WANTED TO PROTECT SLAVERY AND THAT’S WHY THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THAT’S NOT TRUE. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AT ALL. ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHO WAS PRESIDENT THAT ENDED SLAVERY, HE DID NOT WIN THE POPULAR VOTE. HE GOT 37% BUT HE WON IN THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAT HELPED END SLAVERY. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE THAT HELPED END SLAVERY. Greg: EXCELLENCE. Jesse: IF YOU’RE GOING TO ELIMINATE EVERY INSTITUTION THAT HAD ITS ROOTS IN SLAVERY, YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. LOOK AT THE HISTORY OVER THERE ON YOUR SIDE, JUAN. NOT TOO GOOD. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY ENDED SLAVERY. Greg: WE SHOULD MOVE ON FROM THAT. Dana: IT’S TRUE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO THE COAST, CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, TEXAS, NEW YORK, THOSE ARE BIG STATES. IT COULD CHANGE. NEW YORK IS SEEING POPULATIONS LEAVE IN DROVES BECAUSE OF TAXES. Jesse: THESE THINGS HAVE A WAY OF BALANCING OUT. IF YOU SAY THAT THE SENATE IS TYRANNY, YOU HAVE THE HOUSE. CHECKS AND BALANCES, THE WHITE HOUSE, SUPREME COURT, OTHER THINGS. JUAN IS SAYING THAT THE REPUBLICANS RAMMED IT HOME SO HARD ON THE DEMOCRATS WERE SOFT. I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME REPUBLICANS SHOWED UP TO A GUNFIGHT WITH A GUN INSTEAD OF A KNIFE. VOTERS ARE GOING TO REWARD THEM FOR THAT. THE IMPEACHMENT THING, I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. IT’S GOING TO FIRE UP THE REPUBLICAN BASE AND THE DEMOCRATS LOOK CRAZY AND EXTREME. AFTER A WHILE, THE VOTERS ARE GOING TO SAY HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION COSTS, WAGES. WHAT IS AN IMPEACHMENT FIGHT OVER A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DO FOR ME AT ALL. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO GET WAY CAUGHT OUT THERE NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT THE ACTUAL PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THINK. THE OTHER THING IS THAT DEMOCRATS AND THE MEDIA LOOKED SO ANGRY AND HATEFUL AND DESPERATE AND WERE FLOUTING ALL THE RULES. THE VOTERS IN AMERICA I BELIEVE ARE GOING TO LOOK AND SAY IF THE DEMOCRATS GET POWER BACK AFTER THE MIDTERMS, THEY ARE GOING TO GO NUTS WITH IT. WE HAVE SEEN HOW DANGEROUS THEY CAN BE OUT OF POWER. Juan: SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS MEAN SOMETHING. THEY MEAN SOMETHING IN POLITICAL TERMS. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY DOUBT PEOPLE THINK AS OF TODAY WITH KAVANAUGH ON THE COURT, IF YOU LOOK AT ABORTION RIGHTS, GUN-CONTROL, VOTER RIGHTS IN THE COUNTRY. THERE IS A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, VERY CONSERVATIVE ON ALL THOSE ISSUES. MUCH MORE OPEN TO PUTTING, IN THE CASE OF ABORTION, LIMITS AND IN THE CASE OF VOTING RIGHTS, LIMITS. IMMIGRATION. WE ARE GOING TO RUBBER-STAMP ANY CONSERVATIVE Dagen: MAYBE NOW THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO ELECT PEOPLE TO LEGISLATE AND PASS LAWS RATHER THAN USING OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO DO IT. Juan: I DON’T THINK THAT’S THE ISSUE. Dagen: NOW THAT YOU HAVE A COURT THAT’S CONSERVATIVE, FOCUSED ON THE ACTUAL CONSTITUTION RATHER THAN MAKING LAWS TO THE COURT SYSTEM AND JUDICIAL. Juan: THEY HAD TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION AND VIEW IT NOT AS STRICT CONSTRUCTIONIST. Dagen: I AM Greg: DO YOU LIKE MY IDEA THAT THE DEMOCRATS SHOULD PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS AND SUSPEND DUE PROCESS FOR DEMOCRATS? Juan: THIS IS SILLY. I CAN SEE THAT IT DELIGHTS YOU. Greg: I THINK IT IS GENIUS. Juan: THIS GUY HAD HIS LIFE ON THE LINE? THIS WAS NOT ABOUT DUE PROCESS. THIS WAS ABOUT A TEST OF CHARACTER. Dana: TALK ABOUT A TEST OF CHARACTER. Jesse: CHARACTER ASSASSINATION. Dana: DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WANT TO BE MORE CYNICAL LIKE THE REPUBLICANS, I THINK THIS PAST FEW WEEKS HAS SHOWN THEM TO BE THE MOST CYNICAL, AND EXTREME OF WANTING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO WIN. THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE
