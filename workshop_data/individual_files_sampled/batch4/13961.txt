big moves yesterday is that Benjamin Netanyahu the Prime Minister of Israel got up and did a 20-minute speech in which he announced that Israel had done something unbelievable Mossad had somehow gotten hold of 100,000 physical files from the Iran in government about their nuclear program it has an amazing thing just think of how many boxes of materials that is you had to deliberately smuggle out of Tehran how exactly did that happen it's pretty incredible thing about what's in the files is even more stunning so number one the files detail the extent of the Iranian nuclear program prior to the Iran nuclear deal Iran has always lied about that they've said they weren't developing nuclear weapons they just wanted a peaceful nuclear program the files show that that is in fact a lie also the fact that these files had been smuggled to a secret location demonstrates something else which is that Iran had no intention of dismantling its nuclear program as Barack Obama seemed to suggest instead they were just taking all of their files moving them to the back room continuing on with their secret nuclear program probably or at the very least putting other parts of that nuclear program on hold for the moment while they develop all the technology all the centrifuges and all of the and all of the ballistic missile technology and then in ten years after the deal of science and now eight years once that happens they go right back to where they left off they pick up all their own files they have all the same people who've been working on this stuff and boom in six months they have a bomb right that is the point of the Iran deal from where the Iranians ton that's always what people who have opposed the Iran deal have claimed is what the Iranian it's were attempting to do in the Iran deal and now it's been pretty well documented here's what it looked like yesterday and sounded like when Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in front of the world about the files that they had gotten ahold of from the Iranians well tonight I'm here to tell you one thing Iran lied big-time after signing the nuclear deal in 2015 Iran intensified its efforts to hide its secret nuclear files and this is one of the big questions so why exactly did they bother hiding the nuclear files if in fact they were intent on dismantling their nuclear program or even on putting it on hold why would they smuggle those files to someplace eke rrett why would they continue to have a defense program staff by exactly the same people who are running the nuclear program if they put their nuclear plans on hold the answer of course is they're lying and at the very least they are planning to reinitiate that nuclear program as soon as the deal is up or at the very most they may be pursuing nuclear plans in secret here's Netanyahu talking a little bit about the smuggling of the files in 2017 Iran moved its nuclear weapons files to a highly secret location in Tehran this is the sure about district in southern Tehran this is where they kept the atomic archives right here so again pretty amazing intelligence operation now all of the Obama acolytes are claiming that we already knew all this stuff that we knew that Iran was lying about its nuclear weapons for years that's why we tried to sign the Iran deal in the first place because we knew that they'd been developing nuclear weapons why would we have attempted to sign a deal with people if we thought that they weren't developing nuclear weapons okay fair enough except for the fact that Iran then lied to the International Atomic Energy Agency when it came time to make the deal so one of the provisions of the deal is that Iran had to give all the details up of what exactly they'd been doing with their nuclear program in order for the deal to go through they didn't do that they lied about what they were doing they took all those files they hid them because again they plan on opening those files right back up as soon as this deal is up and then developing a nuclear weapon within six months that is their big plan here the fact that all of the Obama friends are out there defending Iran today and suggesting that Iran is honest and that Bibi Netanyahu is a liar tells you pretty much what you need to know about the Obama folks remember that Iran deal which is an awful awful deal does not include ballistic weapons technology so it means that the Iranians can continue to develop long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles without violating the terms of the Iran deal it does not cover the use of money given by the West back to Iran for purposes of terrorism and so Iran has funneled an enormous sum of cash to Bashar Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon the Iran deal did not cover any of that Obama and Kerry openly admitted that we the United States are currently funding Iranian terror projects but that is something that is currently happening and yet we are told that that Iran's deal is so important that we have to maintain it we're told it's really deeply important for us to maintain the Iran deal in a second I'm gonna make the case for those on the right who say we should maintain the Iran deal versus those who say we should just scrap the thing but it is important to note the other place in which the Obama administration lied they lied openly openly about the supposed moderation of the Iranian regime so the story that was sold by Ben Rhodes who is a fiction writer who somehow ended up his national security adviser under Barack Obama it's amazing all these people who say that Trump surrounds himself with unqualified people okay there's no way in the world the Jared Kushner is less qualified than Ben Rhodes because it's impossible for anyone to be less qualified than Ben Rhodes Ben Rhodes went from writing bad short stories that were unpublished his Brooklyn apartment to being National Security Adviser because Barack Obama was friends with him and then Ben Rhodes constructed an entire narrative sold by Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic was a garbage human being and in a terrible reporter the same guy who fired Kevin Williamson Jeffrey Goldberg is the guy who played stooge for the Obama administration as they proclaimed that Iran was promulgating a new moderation they claimed that Iran had gone moderate that the election of Hassan rouhani as opposed to mouth food Ahmadinejad was actually a moderate move and now Iran wanted to make a deal because Iran obviously was moving toward the center and if we just fostered that by reaching out to them then very soon around with moderate obviously that has not happened instead the mullahs have been reinsuring in power and strengthened in their power by the Iran deal they have millions of dollars flowing in they never would have seen before I mean we shipped literally pallets of cash was it 150 billion dollars something like that we shipped pallets of cash to the Iranians first of all the reason we ship pallets with cash as opposed to just wiring the money is because then it's untraceable the Iranians know that we knew that the Obama administration lied about the Iran deal and they did it routinely so the question is why is we be doing this now the answer is that Bibi is doing this now the Israeli Prime Minister is revealing these documents right now because Netanyahu is attempting to make the case for scrapping the Iran deal two weeks before the Trump administration has to decide whether or not to recertify the Iran deal and the Israelis have been coordinating with the Americans all throughout this process it turns out that Netanyahu told Trump about all of these documents two months ago and shockingly Trump actually kept his mouth shut about them which is pretty pretty amazing in and of itself the Israeli ambassador says that the US has shared the documents with the United States and in fact the US has authenticated them I can guarantee you that if people had that information in 2015 this deal would have never happened at the time because it shows there's hard evidence there that Iran has a military nuclear program and that had falsified all their reports to the IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency what Netanyahu did today he did not present simply a smoking gun he presented a smoking bomb okay and there's something else that's happened in the Middle East - and you have to be reading all of the tea leaves to see what's really happening here there is a Sunni alliance that is forming against the rise of Shia Iran that is exactly what is happening here now does this mean that the United States gonna go war with Ron no it doesn't mean the United States is gonna go to war with Iran I don't think the President Trump is interested in using American military might in order to topple the Iranian regime nor am i certain that he should in fact I think there's a pretty good case that the United States should not be involved in using military force in order to topple the Iranian regime if there is any way to avoid it that's why I think that Trump is taking a step back and he's basically saying let's weaken the Iranian regime and then if Israel has to do it Israel has to do then they have to do it they have to do and they've obviously been working hand in glove with the Saudis how do we know that because the Saudis came out in the last two days and Mohammed bin Sultan who is the new Prince over there yeah he had the new king he has he sent something incredible all right he came for and he said that the Palestinians basically ought to take whatever the Trump administration offers them in a deal with Israel or sit down and shut up and the reason that they're saying this is because the Trump administration has said to everyone in the region look you want to stop Iran you're gonna have to get on the same page hey you have to stop using the Palestinians as a baton to wield against the Israelis you have to stop supporting Hamas you have to stop supporting the Palestinian Authority and Islamic Jihad you have to stop all of that and instead you need to understand that you guys face a common enemy and the Saudis understand that the Israelis obviously understand it too so what we have now is a working alliance between Jordan Egypt Saudi Arabia and Israel against Iran and that alliance has been formulated with the end of the Iran deal in mind I'd be very surprised at this point if the Trump administration does not in fact tip over the Iran deal in a couple of weeks now the case against tipping over the Iran deal is that Iran is quote-unquote abiding by the agreement which means that they are not actively developing their nuclear program for the moment and the question is really timing right is everybody ready for what comes next if the Iran deal ends so if the Iran deal ends presumably the United States reimpose the sanctions on Iran the Europeans do not there's been of a foreign policy snafu there because Obama has of course put the onus on the West not on the Iranians to prove that Iran is is line which is I think kind of ridiculous because Iran has been lying continuously about the stuff for decades and so the question becomes okay what happens after that and the answer is that once that once the sanctions are reinforced once the Iran deal is off the table the real purpose of that is to allow Israel to work with Saudi Arabia to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities and that's really what this is about so will that kind of feel great into a larger war I don't think so I think the chances of that spiraling out of control with the Iranians attacking the United States for example they'd be fools to do so and the Russians are not going to jump in against the Israelis and the Saudis because they understand that that would precipitate American military action so this would be probably a very contained military response by Israel and by Saudi Arabia which should have been pursued years and years and years ago if this Iran deal were to end if it's not to end I guess the only reason for doing that is because they haven't come up with a foolproof military plan at this point and so the goal here is to kick the can down the road until they actually have something ready to go well with all of that and and I have I think a pretty good sign that what I'm saying is true which I'll explain to you in just one second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Barroso think about it all of your modern and luxury items come in boxes your mattress your clothes your eyeglasses well now luxury

purchase again they make the luxury couch for real life their burrow furnitures just terrific burrows calm / Ben Shapiro for that deal and to let them know that we sent you so I've said that I think the indicators are pretty good that the White House is going to pull out of the Iran ziyal what is the chief indicator well yesterday there was a statement that came out from the press secretary the office of the press secretary from the White House and here's what it said the United States is aware of the information just released by Israel and continues to examine it carefully this information provides new and compelling details about Iran's efforts to develop missile deliverable nuclear weapons these facts are consistent with what the United States has long known Iran has a robust clandestine nuclear weapons program that it has tried and failed to hide from the world and from its own people okay so they're a bunch of reporters who pointed out this is a pretty stunning statement right they're not saying that Iran had a robust clandestine nuclear weapons program they're saying that it has an active weapons program which would obviously be a violation of the deal and mean that we have to pull out of the deal immediately well the White House came out afterward and they changed the language they changed to Iran had a robust clandestine weapons nuclear nuclear weapons program the White House said it was a clerical error but there's very little there's very little question as to where the White House's head is at right the White House believes that the nuclear deal is bad Barack Barack Obama knew it was bad but did it anyway and lied to the American people about it Trump has been saying for years that the Iran deal is a disaster and President Trump is right now as I say none of this means the United States has to go to war the United States can do a lot of things short of going to war we can reimpose sanctions we can help facilitate the use of Saudi airspace by the Israelis we can ensure that Israel is defended in case of retaliatory strike but that doesn't mean that we have to go to active war with the Iranians we can support revolutionary movements within Iran in a stronger possible fashion if we have the sanctions reinforced it's very difficult to support people trying to topple a regime when you have a deal with the regime that's why I've always found the Obama line that it was either his deal or war to be so foolish and such a lie he's not the only one saying it of course pat buchanan who really despises israel he's been saying the same thing here is buchanan making that case so you didn't watch TV Netanyahu's evidence and believe it today because I believed every word of it I believe Netanyahu with due respect wants the United States to fight a war against Iran when Israel but he's talking about fighting a war my country getting into another another war either okay again this is a lie when you have people like Pat Buchanan saying that everything is inevitably going to lead to war that's nonsense it is worth noting by the way that the Israel was very tepid about the Iraq war in the first place for all the people who keep saying that Israel was the cause of the Iraq war go back and look at the evidence the Israeli government was really not something for the Iraq war they were very very torn about whether the United States should go to war in Iraq in the first place that was a George W Bush initiative I think it was right initiative at the time based on the evidence that he had in front of him but yeah again the sort of pat buchanan it this is a war on behalf of the jews routine i don't think that's right especially because as iranian influence goes in the region that threatens a lot of american interests aside from israel including Saudi Arabia including the the fate of Europe including American troops that are stationed around the world Iran developing the sort of technology is extraordinarily dangerous especially considering that Iran has such close relationships with a bunch of terror groups you talk about Iran as the greatest state terrorist state terror sponsor on planet earth that is obviously the case okay now meanwhile in other news I just have to comment on Maxine Waters so Maxine Waters came out yesterday and she's talking about Kanye West now I'm growing tired of talking about Kanye West I think the Kanye West did something great and over the past few days he's been tweeting out quotes from Thomas Sowell and all of that's really good so I think Kanye's a political expert no I don't think he's a political expert but again kudos to Kanye for attempting to have conversations about politics in a fashion that doesn't fit directly into the jigsaw puzzle that the Democrats had built for him he's been saying that you know you should think for yourself on politics he's been saying that we don't have to be stuck on a particular political plantation honestly good for him for saying all of that while Maxine Waters has had enough the representative from California who is one of the more adult ish members of Congress I mean she is she's really stupid human being Maxine Waters tore into Kanye West and here's what she said she said quote Kanye West is a very creative young man but we also think that sometimes West talks out of turn and perhaps he needs some assistance in helping him to formulate some of his thoughts his he Kanye West needs Maxine Waters to guide him because he's too stupid we don't think that he actually means to do harm but we're not sure he really understands the impact of what he's saying at the time that he's saying it and how that weighs on particularly African American community and for young people in general and then she continued quote I understand that he is getting pushback from a lot of young people on the Internet we're hopeful that his creativity will continue to be demonstrated in his work and I think maybe you should think twice about politics and maybe not have so much to say so this is pretty amazing because she's essentially telling Kanye West to shut up and sing that's exactly what that last sentence is he should think twice about politics and maybe have not so much to say and he should continue to show his creativity and his work so let's get this straight when Laura Ingraham said to LeBron James shut up and dribble that was racist when Maxim water says to Kanye West shut up and sing that's just her what being great advisor a great adviser to Kanye West first of all for her to claim that anyone is ignorant is insane okay again Maxine Waters is one of the more corrupt stupid members of Congress as a woman who while she's sitting on the House Financial Services Committee was named by Judicial Watch the most corrupt member of Congress I think four times because she was attempting to use the House Financial Services Committee allegedly to funnel money and make exceptions for her husband's Bank one United Bank he had a bunch of stock in the bank as for her stupidity there's a lady who once said that Vladimir Putin was going to invade Korea not Crimea she said she once said that she was she said I was once a millennial no she was not she promoted abortion by saying I have to March because my mother could not have an abortion which is a good reason for you not to March because if your mom had had an abortion you wouldn't be there but again Maxine Waters the entire left a lot of folks on the Left very very upset with Kanye West for daring to step outside of the of the typical box that has been built for all of these folks on the left here in Hollywood this box has been built for you if you are a black person this box has been built for you and so if you step outside the box that Maxine Waters will clock you again if you step outside any box the left will clock in the resistance to this I think is growing exceedingly strong then a lot of people right now who are feeling like you've been hemming me and I think by the way a lot of trumps appeal in 2016 was based on the idea that he was breaking out of the box of political correctness I think a lot of the stuff he said wasn't politically incorrect I think it was dumb but the fact that he was willing to say things that were politically incorrect from time to time was one of his chief appeals that Hillary Clinton made a huge mistake politically by reinforcing the perception of a lot of mayor of a lot of Americans that the left wants to build a small box for you to live in and if you go outside the box then she will call you a deplorable and Donald Trump said listen I hate boxes boxes are stupid the corners hurt I don't want them and then he just blew up the box yeah I think that a lot of people felt the appeal of that and a lot of people are feeling the appeal of that now which is great which is great I think Kanye West is one of the people feeling the appeal of that now does there still have to be some sort of box for acceptable opinion and unacceptable opinion I think most people agree then not all opinion is created equal and not all opinion is equally valuable but I think that if we're willing to err on the side of the size of the box we have to err on the side of a large box a box that fits a lot of opinions and again a black person saying they want to vote Republican or consider Republican voting is is not the end of the world it and it's also worth noting that there's a lot of disinformation being put out that the Democratic left in an attempt to win Kanye West back like they keep putting out the myth that the Republican and Democratic parties switch places on race in the 1960s that is eminently untrue it's been disproved by people ranging from Shawn trend of Real Clear Politics to a couple of professors I believe at Princeton and the statistics just do not bear this out but good for Kanye West and bad for Maxine Waters again cudgelling people into line seems to be the the main priority of so many folks on the Left which is really really unfortunate these days okay so before I go any further and I have to talk about the New York Times which is celebrating Karl Marx's birthday I am not kidding first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at thrive market so check out thrive market calm slash Shapiro for great savings on all the

box everybody in with identity politics they are also attempting to revivify the the ghost of karl marx so the New York Times has written a bunch of pieces in the last year about why Marxism is awesome which is pretty amazing because then they charge you a pretty high subscription for you to be over at the New York Times but well they've written op eds in the last year titled when communism inspired Americans socialism's future maybe its past and why women had better sex under socialism which seems wildly untrue considering that the better sex under socialism of China involves forced abortion which seems like that might kill the mood a little bit in any case there's another piece out yesterday that I just love from a guy named Jason Barker he's an associate professor of philosophy over at a South Korean University and the piece is called happy birthday Karl Marx you were right and there's a picture of a giant statue of Karl Marx I mean not only was Karl Marx not right Karl Marx's idiotic philosophy led to the deaths of well over a hundred million people during the 20th century alone so if that's right then I don't want to be right anytime soon but here is what this professor writes he writes on May 5th 1818 in the southern German town of Trier in the picturesque wine-growing region of the Moselle Valley Karl Marx was born at the time Trier was one tenth the size it is today with a population of around 12,000 according to one of marks his recent biographers Jurgen F sure is one of those towns where although everyone doesn't know everyone many know a lot about many such provincial constraints were no match from Marx's boundless intellectual enthusiasm rare were the radical thinkers of the major European capitals of his day that have either failed to meet or it failed to break with on theoretical grounds and then he talks about all of his all of his intellectual influences and he says in nineteen in 1837 Marx reneged on the legal career that his father himself a lawyer had mapped out for him and immersed himself instead in the speculative philosophy of GWF Hegel at the University of Berlin if you've never read Hegelian philosophy don't worry about it it's incredibly abstruse and difficult to read but the basic idea of hegelian philosophy is that God is present in history and that history is essentially a progression from synthesis and from from thesis and antithesis to synthesis in other words there's one position the opposite position they fight with each other and the result is a synthesis of the best of both positions and therefore history is constantly moving in a progressive direction that is Hegelian ism in two sentences right there okay but what Marx took from that is that history was going to move inevitably away from capitalism and instead toward communism so here is what Barker writes is if there was ever a convincing case to be made for the dangers of philosophy then surely it's Marx his discovery of Hegel whose grotesque craggy melody repelled him at first but which soon had him dancing deliriously through the streets of Berlin as Marx confessed to his father in an equally delirious letter in November 1837 I wanted to embrace every person standing on the street corner and here's what Barker writes as we reach the Bicentennial of Marx's birth what lessons might we draw from his dangerous and delirious philosophical legacy what precisely is Marx's lasting contribution today the legacy would be it would appear to be alive and well if my live and welcome in the Soviet Union no longer exists after a century of oppression and that the Chinese have embraced non Marxist philosophy and that the last standing vestige of true Marxism on planet Earth is probably in Cuba and North Korea to gulag states then sure everything is going great for Marxism oh yeah and there's Venezuela also which has just been a boon since the turn of the millennium countless books have appeared from scholarly works to popular biographies writes this professor in the New York Times broadly endorsing Marx's reading of capitalism and its enduring relevance to our neoliberal age in 2002 the French philosopher Alain Badiou declared at a conference I attended in London that Marx had become the philosopher of the middle class what did he mean I believe he meant that educated liberal opinion is today more or less unanimous in its agreement that Marx basic thesis the capitalism is driven by a deeply vicen class struggle in which the ruling class minority appropriates the surplus labor of the working-class majority as profit is correct even liberal economists such as Nouriel Roubini agreed that Marxist conviction that capitalism has an inbuilt tendency to destroy itself remains as prescient as ever well okay a couple of things that are wrong with this one Marx's basic theory which is that rich people exploit poor people for their own profit is idiotic okay unless you can demonstrate that there is force that is being used the fact is that capitalism has raised more people out of poverty than anything else in the history of humanity and it is not closed okay in 1980 twice the number of people as today we're living in abject poverty on planet Earth today less than 10 percent of all people on planet Earth are living in what they call extreme poverty by UN standards that is solely due to free trade in capitalism is it this idea that Marx's thesis is right that it's all about class warfare no if you're an educated person and you've actually studied the issues you don't believe this you have to be a fool to believe this you have to be a college educated Bernie Sanders spouting idiot to believe this stuff but here's the part that I that I love about Barker so here's what he talks about he says Marx arrives at no magic formula for exiting the enormity enormous social and economic contradictions that global capitalism entails what Marx did achieve however through his self-styled materialist thought were the critical weapons for undermining capitalism's ideological claims of the only game in town so what exactly does he say is the way that capitalism is going to fall Marx according to this professor in the New York Times celebrating Marx well Marx was convinced the capitalism and to make relics of Kappa that capitalism is who make relics of all of these workers all these various type of workers the inroads that artificial intelligence is currently making into medical diagnosis and surgery for instance bares out the argument in the manifesto that technology would greatly accelerate the division of labor or the descaling of such professions okay first of all here he is picked an incredibly poor example my wife has mentioned many times on the show is a doctor the fact that she is capable of using medical technology to diagnose has made her a better doctor it has not declined it is not it does not reduce the demand for doctors we saw the shortage of doctors in the United States largely thanks to the regulatory policies of the federal government okay but I visit this is my favorite part so then he talks about how how what we really need here is something new he says we need a classless and stateless society raises we're Hagel had stopped it advocating a rational liberal state Marx would go one stage further since the gods were no longer divine there was no need for a state at all so it's not that the state existed in history and the God existed in history it's there was no need for a state instead we could have a classless stateless society that would come to define both Marx and Engels idea of communism and of course the subsequent and troubled history of the communist states that materialized during the 20th century and I love this part he says there are still a great till to be learned from their disasters but their philosophical relevance remains doubtful to say the least so just to get this straight according to this particular professor of philosophy at a South Korean University writing in the New York Times the history of Marxism can be completely separated off from the history of the USSR China North Korea Cuba Venezuela and every other state that has attempted state-sponsored communism right none of that has any philosophical relevance right there sort of Herot historical curiosities weird that they all thought they were interpreting Marx too but apparently this guy's the only guy who understands Marx this is the best part right he's so here he talks about where Marxism really exists and this is actually important hey here's the part that's important not just that the New York Times is celebrating Marx this part then Bowser hu is important because you need to understand that what he says here is true the Marxist roots of identity politics are very clear and they're very disturbing he of course thinks it's great he says the key factor in Marx's intellectual legacy in our present-day society is not philosophy about critique or what he described in 1843 as quote the ruthless criticism of all that exists ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of the conflicts with the powers that be the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways the point is to change it Marx wrote in 1845 here's the paragraph that matters racial and sexual oppression have been added to the dynamic of class exploitation social justice movements like black lives matter and me to owe something of an unspoken debt to Marx through their unapologetic targeting of the eternal truths of our age such movements recognize as it marks that the ideas that rule every society are those of its ruling class and that overturning those ideas is fundamental to true revolutionary progress we have become used to the go-getting mantra that to effect social change we first have to change ourselves but enlightened or rational thinking is not enough since the norms of thinking are already skewed by the structures of male privilege and social hierarchy even down to the language we use changing the Norm's entails changing the very foundations of society so in just a second I'm gonna explain why what I just said there why that those two segments those two paragraphs are deeply deeply important first you're

leave us a review we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so back to this in this piece from the New York Times what is admitted in this piece upholding Marxism is something really stunning what he basically is saying is that when you look at all these ethnic solidarity movements or the female solidarity movement or any of these identity politics movements these are newfangled attempts to use Marxist critiques to bring down society this is true okay if you go back to the 1960s and you look at the work of a lot of members of the Frankfurt School people like everybody Marquess and you and you she read them what they are saying is that the new stand-ins for the for the lower classes that are gonna rise up the proletariat we're gonna rise up and take over the system instead of doing it by class he says we're gonna separate you by racial group we're going to say that you black people have been victimized by American society and you gay people have been victimized by American society and you Hispanic people and you Jewish people and you women and you transgenders you've all been it you've all been hurt by American society now rise up and tear down your oppressor the new Marxist revolution is happening but it's not happening on the basis of class it's happening on basis of identity and Marxist know that now their whole goal here is to tear down the system and what they say is that once we have a classless society and all this will go away and this is why when you hear Bernie Sanders talk it's really kind of ironic and hilarious when Bernie Sanders talks he is talking the language of Marxism on behalf of identity politics but the identity politics movement has grown so strong that it's now at war with some of its Marxist roots what I mean by that is that when you listen to Bernie what Bernie basically says is look all these identity politics groups are being oppressed they're being oppressed the way they are not going to be oppressed anymore is when there is a socialist utopia when we have a socialist utopia in which income is redistributed and in which people at the top are stamped on and people at the bottom are uplifted men there will be no more racism there will be no more sexism there'll be no more homophobia and transphobia everyone will get along everyone will love his brother socialism will be the solution well that was the message that was being put forth by all of the advocates of identity politics who originally started the identity politics at identity politics advocacy in the 1960s and 70s okay so Bernie is just spouting what he knows from his 1960s commune time but the identity politics advocates they say well bernie is not paying enough attention to us it demarks i started paying enough attention to us they don't understand even if we tear down the current cap the system and we put in its place a socialist system that's not enough identity politics tribalism actually overcomes Marxism in their rubric and so what you're seeing right now and it's fascinating to watch is if an ongoing fight between the identity politics wing of the Democratic Party and the Marxist wing of the Democratic Party and they're going to war with each other even though the Marxist wing created the identity politics wing it's really quite fascinating but it is important to note that the goal of all of this the common cause is to tear down the capitalist system to tear it down the social hierarchies that lys opposes social hierarchies based on race not on merit right none of that is true okay what exists in the United States right now is a meritocracy what exists in the United States by and large without government regulation is a free and open country where he can fall or rise on your own merit yeah that's a very good thing but Marx just believed that all of that has to fall and they are using identity politics as a tool in tearing down the social order the final paragraph from jason barker over the new york times is pretty amazing he says the transition to a new society where relations among people rather than capital relations finally determine an individual's worth is arguably proving to be quite a task first of all it's hard to say what exactly that's supposed to mean you know I do judge all the individuals around me not based on how much money they make but whether they are good people in fact that's been a religious principle since the beginning of religion you're supposed to judge people not on the amount of money that they make you're not supposed to judge their worth by their income but by how they are as human beings but Marxism says that we can somehow quantify that in such a way that we can pay people in accordance with their virtue which is really weird and I think untrue but Barker concludes Marx as I have said does not offer one-size-fits-all formula for enacting social change but he does offer a powerful intellectual acid test for that change on that basis we are destined to keep citing him and testing his ideas until the kind of society that he struggled to bring about and that increasing numbers of us now desire is finally realized so we're just gonna keep repeating Marx's routine until Marx's dream is realized Marx's dream was realized and it was a dystopian nightmare but the New York Times and left us to all over the world refuse to recognize that because that is their last best hope for the replacement of a judeo-christian value system with a system of their own making they tried bureaucratic centralization and top-down running things that didn't work in the early 20th century they tried fascism okay fascism was a left-wing movement Mussolini began by Marx okay Hitler to began by being entranced with some of the ideas of Marx and Hegel all of these things were left with movements by European standards they became right-wing movements because they became counter communist but that does not mean but by American standards these were right-wing movements okay fascism Italian fascism if place in the United States would have been much closer to FDR than would have been close to Wendell Willkie and the same thing is true of Hitler's politics but the fact is that the left is never going to let go of the Marxist dream because the left looks at human beings they say human beings suck the only way to transform them is by transforming the system religion looks at human beings and says human beings suck the only way to transform human beings is for human beings to transform themselves and to become better human beings it's not about the system it's about you one of those philosophies leads to better human beings the other philosophy leads to horrible societies horrible societies as a general rule okay so in just one second I want to talk about some big breaking news and that of course is chaos in the Muller investigation as some of Muller's questions are elite before I get some old questions though I just have to note one quick thing that's pretty amazing so you know I live in Los Angeles I've spent a lot of time at my entire life basically in left-wing areas Los Angeles Cambridge Massachusetts and that means that I know a lot of folks on the left and a lot of folks on the Left who like to talk about how terrible the United States is how racist and awful it is and spend all of their time I was trying to effectuate social change spend all of their time trying to fix the ills of society trying to tear down the hierarchies in order to build a new beautiful classless society a lot of those people are totally full of crap how do I know this because when it comes time for those same rules to be applied in their backyard suddenly becomes not so interested hey the latest case in point here is white residents of New York City's Upper West Side complaining about the idea that they're going to have to take in a bunch of low-income minority people into their school so the college fix is reporting the Ross story which is not a bright leanin news organization caught this meeting on tape there's a meeting of residents in the New York's Upper West Side at a meeting of the local school district and progressive parents find out that their schools will soon have to reflect the demographics of New York as a whole and the schools in the area are currently predominantly white and they get really mad watch as these white parents become very upset about the idea of having to allow low-income minority children into their school an emotional meeting on the Upper West Side parents objecting to a proposal to require each of the 17 local middle schools to reserve a quarter of their seats for students scoring below grade level on state English and math exams some parents warning that high performing students would be shut out of the most desirable schools okay so I love that all these people who presumably voted for Bill DeBlasio and love the idea of forced busing is a little so long as it's not in their neighborhood as soon as it comes into their neighborhood that's like no no no no no no right these are the same people who say that everyone down south is racist but on the Upper West Side of New York they're saying we don't want those low-income black kids in our school cuz gonna ruin our school this is by the way is why I believe that public education in general is a serious problem that has to be rectified by local answers I can't be rectified by government at a broader level these all that's gonna happen by the way here's what's really gonna happen is that there will be demographic changes in these schools the parents will just pull their kids out and put them in private school right that's exactly what's going to happen because that's what's been happening in the United States for years and years and years and years beyond which I'm not sure that the schools are generally the problem I think that very often the circumstances in which people grow up are much more defining is whether you're gonna be a success later in life than the school to which you went as an elementary school student I think one of the great myths of our public education system is that if you went to a really solid public school when you were five that that is more indicative of your success level than whether you had a single mom or grew up in poverty in an area with with a lot of crime I just don't think that's right I think that generally the two things tend to be linked but that's more of a statement about the the culture and society in which you grew up again not having nothing to with color because there plenty of poor white societies that have crappy public schools as well dumping more money and gonna fix it I'm not sure the force bucks busing is gonna fix it either but I want a point but I can say that because that's what I believe I'm not sure the people on the Upper West Side who'd say that I'd be horrible for saying that are allowed to say that and all the people on the Upper West Side who are listening to this okay if you think that it's horrible and racist to suggest that maybe I should be able to put my kid where I want to put my kid in school and that kids should have school vouchers so they can put their kids where they want they can put they can go where they want to school if you think that that is racist an awful let me just suggest that if you go to your local school meeting and rant and rave about a bunch of black kids coming to your school because you think it's gonna lower the educational credentials your school maybe you ought to take a look in the mirror maybe you ought to take a look in the mirror and I'm not suggesting those black kids can't come to your school at all in fact I think they should be able to pay to come to the school of vouchers I'm suggesting that there are these gated communities that exist with public tax dollars that are a serious problem in a lot of these areas and and that your objection on the left some people going to private school is really an objection that you should be applying to yourself because at least people who go to private school aren't taking advantage of public money to send their kids to gated communities okay so in just a second I want to discuss the situation with with with robert muller so here's the situation here's the here's the latest okay so on monday there's a new report from the New York Times and revealed dozens of questions special counsel Robert Muller wanted to ask President Trump if he agrees to an interview for the Russia probe so this is reported by Ryan's ephedra over at Daily wire some of the questions Mulla reportedly wants to ask Trump include what did you know about phone calls that former national security adviser Michael Flynn made with the Russian ambassador circuitously AK in December 2016 what did you know about Sally Yates his meetings about mr. Flynn how is the decision made to fire mr. Flynn what was your opinion of James Comey during the transition what did you think about commis intelligence briefing On January 6 2017 about Russian election interference what was the purpose of your calls to mr. Comey why did you decide to fire him now here is the big problem with all of this okay there is pretty much not a lot here about supposed connections to Russia so here's some of the questions being asked about the original Trump Russia collusion right there remember this whole investigation was originally about the idea that Vladimir Putin had been working with Donald Trump to steal the election here are some of the questions he's going to ask when did you become aware of the Trump Tower meeting this is the one between Donald's from jr. and a couple of Trump officials and a Russian lawyer what involvement did you have in the communication strategy including the release of Donald's from Jr's emails during the 2013 trip to Russia what communication and relationships did you have with the Aguila ROVs and Russian government officials during the campaign what did you know about Russian hacking use of social media or other acts aimed at the campaign what knowledge did you have any outreach by Matt Paul Manafort to Russia so we'll have to see whether this is more aimed at collusion or whether this is more aimed at obstruction it seems like very little about his aims at the collusion because if they actually had evidence of collusion then they'd be going after Trump and his people already I assume I mean if they actually had evidence evidence of conspiracy to violate campaign law then I assume they would already be going after people so this really goes to intent right what they're really trying for here is that Trump intended to do stuff and then he was obstructing justice by firing people but it doesn't sound like they have the goods just from a list of questions that they have that they have put forth again I feel like Trump would be a fool to get in a room with Muller because Muller could catch them in some sort of perjury trap but you know maybe Rudy Giuliani thinks differently we will find out okay time for a thing I think I both like and hate will do a combined thing I like and hate so here's the thing that I both like and hate Avengers infinity war so I have many thoughts on Avengers infinity war and if you haven't seen the movie yet now is the time for you to cut too short today's podcast and then go back and listen to it a little bit later after you've actually seen the movie from one of the five people in America who have not seen the movie yet sorry for those in the room who have not yet seen the movie I'm about to spoil a bunch of crap for you so Mathis it's time for you to turn off your your earphones and then walk out of the room if you don't want to be spoiled because I'm about to say a lot of stuff that's about to spoil the movie okay so first of all the movie is well-made it's it's really well-made considering they have to juggle about 83 different plot lines and you can see from the poster that it's every person in the world in one movie the truth is the real focus of this movie the real focus of this movie is Iron Man Thor and the guardians of the galaxy those are those are really the people who you're following during this film Captain America is not in the film very much at all here's a little bit of preview from one of the five people in America who didn't see the preview here's a little bit of what the movie looks like the entire time I knew he only ever had one goal to wipe out half the universe if he gets all the Infinity stones she can do it with the snap of his fingers just like that tell me his name again danos we got one advantage she's coming to us we have a dance once so that's what we use okay so everybody's in the movie like everyone including my mother like everyone is in this film but well here here's my problem with the movie so I have a couple of problems with them here's a first the stuff I like the stuff that I like is everything with Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth is hysterical Chris Hemsworth is the best thing in any of the Marvel movies now he is really really funny everything he does here is very thor ragnarok based and it's there there's one scene in particular between Chris Pratt and Chris Hemsworth that is just hysterically funny and and really really good Chris Pratt is really good in this I it's pretty obvious who the stars are and this here in land and beyond that Thanos as a character is is a good character so Josh Brolin turns in a really solid performance as Thanos you don't notice the CGI at all and his entire character is CGI'd so that's a pretty cool thing there are a couple problems with Diana's character problem number one is that his motivation is insufficiently spelled out so they say that he had a home planet his home planet was basically overpopulated and the entire planet died in poverty he had said let's randomly kill half the planet and then we can fix and then we can prevent a shortage on on pianos on pianos his home planet that's Malthusian nonsense so first of all somebody should have explained to him that perhaps with additional creativity of humanoid creatures comes additional propensity to create awesome resources so back in the 1960s Paul Ehrlich predicted that by the year 1990 half the population would be starving basically none of that ended up being true so Thanos is basically Paul Ehrlich the Stanford professor with less hair and Pollack was totally wrong he's wrong but everything people are more prosperous now there are more of us now than ever before in human history by a long margin and yet things are okay somebody should have honestly this movie could have been solved if somebody sat Thomas Sol down with Thanos like that would have fixed everything they showed you gotten Julian Simon's ghost to sit down with Thanos and they could have had a nice conversation about scarcity of resources and allocation of those resources also if it turns out that overpopulation is a thing among humanoid creatures typically people just have fewer kids which is what has happened in throughout human history which is why as countries get richer it's actually interesting as countries get richer people have fewer kids but aside from the philosophical problems with a nose the movie revolves around Thanos so every beat of the movie is involved with thanasis story it really is not Avengers infinity war it really more is Thanos the origins because this is all lead up to Avengers infinity War part two and this is my big problem with the movie my big problem with the movie is that the entire thing is leading up to this giant climax where a bunch of people are gonna get killed and suffice it to say without telling you who gets killed a bunch of major characters get killed there are some characters who get killed for real but it is very obvious by the end of the movie and some of the characters who have been killed are not going to remain dead zone okay now the reason that I know this is because I'm not a stupid human and when I watch the end of infinity war and bad stuff happens let's just I won't fully spoil it bad stuff happens to many of the major characters there are certain characters where you go oh man I can't believe they killed that guy off and then they kill off a couple of characters you're like nah nah these it turns out that Marvel is a Disney property and Marvel is not gonna kill off all of its most bankable stars because they have movies already slated on the books with these stars okay so they're not gonna kill off like you're you know who I'm talking about but there's there's one character in particular who's been in a film that made a lot of money as in all the money they're not gonna kill off that character right and when you're watching it and you're and you're thinking about it the minute it happens it takes you immediately out of the movie because you're thinking nah this is not true so in other words we got a two hour 40 minute movie leading up to the worst red herring in the world in which presumably all these characters are dead but we know they're not really dead because they're gonna reverse and they're gonna write back all the characters that annoys the living crap out of me because if you're going to create this idea that there are major stakes in the movie if you're gonna create this idea that deep horrible things are going to happen then you can't do it with me as the audience knowing that you're faking with me as the audience no you're lying like the first time it happens the first time somebody dies and it's a major character at the end of the film they're a couple major deaths before that in the film and those ones I think are real but by the time they get to the end of the film when a major character dies and you know that that person is not going to die you're like but what so why couldn't we've just had like a seven minute movie like sure it was fun and all but we could have had like a seven minute movie and the seven minute movie would have gone something like this right it would have gone something like this it would've been a Star Wars crawl it says Thanos scourge of the universe has found a box with six Infinity stones in it flashback to Danno on his home planet debating with his friends and family about whether they should kill off half the population him losing the debate half the population dying right just like jor-el on Krypton right and then next thing you know it shows Stannis with his magic glove on right he snaps and then you get the end of the movie so the whole thing could've been eight minutes long and that actually would have been the prologue to the second infinity war which is where this stuff actually is going to happen because this is all why the next infinity war is where the remaining characters are going to go about reversing everything that just happened in this movie don't do that that's that's cheating okay you cheated me out of thirty five bucks because I had to spend a bunch of money go to the ArcLight with my wife to see this thing so I could talk about it and again did I not enjoy I enjoyed it I enjoyed it but you can't make me feel emotionally like there's one particular death where they do it and they are so attempting to strangle you as an audience member there's still attempting to strangle tears out of you as an audience member in the way this character dies and you're like but he's not dead like I know he's not dead I know for a fact he's not dead because there's a movie slated on the books with this star a year from now so he's not dead right so you're lying to me you're trying to like if there's a scene in in the show friends where there's a there's a a an anniversary for Ross and r84 for Ross and what's Courtney Cox's character's name and it's not Rachel it's the other one the ending in any case Monica thank you with Ross and Monica's parents and Monica is and Ross can always make the parents cry at the at the anniversary and Monica desperately wants to make the parents cry so she does a speech and the parents aren't crying at all and she just starts telling stories about like when the dog died and all this sort of thing like there is that moment in Avengers infinity war where one of the characters is like basically the producers are saying like you need to cry now if you're not crying out is your bad person why aren't you crime why aren't a crime it's wrong with you aren't you and I'm not crying I know he's not dead that's why I'm not crying you okay so was it bad no it was enjoyable but am I going to give them the the credence of pretending am I going to pretend along with them that any of these people are really dead no because I'm not a stupid idiot okay so there's my infinity war summation and and now if I've spoiled the movie for you sorry but I gave you fair warning you could have tuned out earlier and then listen to it later anyway we'll be back here tomorrow with all the rest of the news and hopefully I will have I will have vented my spleen about Avengers infinity bar by then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Plummer executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey
