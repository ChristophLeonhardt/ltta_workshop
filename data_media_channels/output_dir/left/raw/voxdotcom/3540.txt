1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,000
Imagine it's 1980.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,640
Mullets are cool.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,080
The Empire Strikes Back is playing in theaters.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,099
And International Business
Machines or IBM is the world's dominant

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,520
technology firm.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,120
It embodies the American
Dream with a progressive agenda of equal

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,920
opportunity and prides itself on a
stable workforce.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,700
It's so thrilling to

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,840
see the new IBM personal system - in the
hands of an old master.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,960
According to this

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,780
handbook in over 40 years, full-time
employees haven't been touched by layoffs.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,860
People are a treasured resource
and are treated like one.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,400
Fast forward to the present.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,399
ProPublica estimates IBM has eliminated

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,640
20,000 American employees age 40 and
over in just the past five years.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,320
That's about 60 percent of its estimated US job
cuts during that time.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,260
How did IBM go

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,800
from valuing its older workforce to
systematically getting rid of them?

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,880
Through the '80s,

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,620
technology started shifting rapidly.

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,140
Among other things, Apple
introduced the first Macintosh and took

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,140
a direct shot at IBM.

23
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,340
It appears IBM
wants it all.

24
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,780
By the early 2000's IBM fell

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,500
further as new rivals like Google,
Facebook, and Amazon took the lead.

26
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,480
In our world the speed and tempo of modern
living are increasing at an

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,780
ever-accelerating rate.

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,500
And as it slipped,
IBM had to deal with something most of

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,140
these competitors didn't have: a large
number of experienced and aging

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,340
employees.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,360
They reacted to new setbacks
with layoffs

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,660
and many of them were older workers.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
ProPublica heard from over 1,400 former IBM employees.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,380
Here's what we know.

35
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,300
In making staff cuts, IBM has side-stepped

36
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,220
US laws and regulations intended to
protect workers from age discrimination.

37
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,620
In the past, they would get two lists
from IBM. One that had ages of people

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,120
staying and another with ages of those
being let go.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,180
In 2014

40
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,580
IBM stopped giving that information.

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,790
On top of that, the company required people

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,320
to sign away their rights to sue for age
discrimination in court, in exchange for

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,540
their severance packages.

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,390
By signing the
documents, laid-off employees waived the

45
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,660
right to go to court.

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,290
They could only
pursue their age cases through

47
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,780
confidential arbitration.

48
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,120
They also have
to do it solo, so they couldn't combine

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,100
forces with other workers who may be
claiming similar age discrimination.

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,020
Studies show arbitration overwhelmingly
favors employers.

51
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,500
Workers win only

52
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,160
19% of the time, when their
cases are arbitrated versus 36%

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,900
of the time when they go to
federal court and 57% in state courts.

54
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,370
IBM has also laid off and fired
some older workers with review

55
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,140
techniques that effectively made their
age a disadvantage.

56
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,410
Take the case of one

57
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,200
business unit that was using a point
system to evaluate workers.

58
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,200
The more

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,080
points a person got, the more protected
they were from negative changes to

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,740
employment.

61
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,120
But the system itself
appeared biased.

62
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,060
Employees were given

63
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,860
points for being relatively new at a job
level, so those who worked there fewer

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,950
years earned more points than long time
IBMers.

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,540
The bias against older workers is
evident when you compare the number of

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,200
points to years of service.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,339
Those with no
points worked there an average of more

68
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,539
than thirty years.

69
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,080
Those with higher
points average fifteen years.

70
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,800
But the numbers don't
reflect worker skills.

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,860
80% of older, more

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,080
long-term employees, the ones with lower
points, were rated by the company itself

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,760
as "good enough to stay at current job
levels or be promoted",

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,259
while only a small

75
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,460
percentage of younger employees with
high numbers had similar ratings.

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,919
They've also converted many layoffs into
retirements, forcing ex-employees to

77
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,581
accept a retirement package or leave
with no benefits.

78
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,870
They've told remote

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,820
workers, including older ones who had
worked from home for years, to relocate

80
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,940
to offices potentially thousands of
miles away from their homes.

81
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,660
Their options were relocate or resign.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,860
In response to all of these findings IBM

83
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,270
has said "we are proud of our company and
our employees ability to reinvent

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,040
themselves era after era while always
complying with the law."

85
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,400
The problem is

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,800
protection for workers under the law is
eroding.

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,860
In the past few decades, rulings

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,240
in age discrimination cases have said
former employees must prove that there

89
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,860
were no factors other than age involved
in their job changes, but companies like

90
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,620
IBM have made it near impossible to
prove that.

91
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,520
With nearly 400,000 employees

92
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,820
worldwide, IBM is still a tech giant.

93
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,500
And how it handles its older workforce could

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,220
encourage other companies to follow suit,
even though a lot of these companies

95
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,520
have a younger workforce now.

96
00:05:53,520 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's the thing about aging: it happens to everyone
