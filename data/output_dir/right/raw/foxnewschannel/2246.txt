00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:01,599
KNOWN IN 2015, BARACK OBAMA

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:02,800
NEVER WOULD'VE GOTTEN THE DEAL

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,035
THROUGH.

4
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:04,969
CHANTED RATES IRAN MUCH TO

5
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:05,370
CONTEMPLATE.

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,872
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

7
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:09,140
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

8
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,708
NOT TAKING TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT

9
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:11,075
SLIGHTLY.

10
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:13,711
INSTEAD, SPEAKING TO PROTECT A

11
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:15,913
DEAL THEY STRUCK WITH THE

12
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:16,280
AYATOLLAH.

13
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,148
SOME WARNING THAT TAKING APART

14
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:17,849
THE IRAN DEAL WILL SEND THE

15
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,751
WRONG MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA, AS

16
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:22,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP HEADS TOWARDS

17
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:23,488
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ROGUE

18
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:24,489
MACHINE.

19
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:25,490
LET'S TALK ABOUT WITH YJ

20
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,858
FISCHER, FORMER STATEMENT

21
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,693
OFFICIAL UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA.

22
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,695
WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE IRAN

23
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:30,995
DEAL.

24
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:31,696
JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS

25
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:32,897
CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER HOUSE

26
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:33,598
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN.

27
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:34,999
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

28
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:37,101
>> THANK YOU.

29
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,169
>> Shannon: I WANT TO CONTRAST

30
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,637
A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

31
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:40,905
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IN 2015 IS

32
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,840
THE DEAL CAME TOGETHER WITH WHAT

33
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,574
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAD TO

34
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:46,511
SAY TODAY.

35
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:48,579
>> THIS FRAMEWORK WOULD CUT OFF

36
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,314
EVERY PATHWAY THAT IRAN COULD

37
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:51,716
TAKE TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR

38
00:00:51,716 --> 00:00:52,050
WEAPON.

39
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,085
>> THE NUCLEAR DEAL GIVES THE

40
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,822
IRAN A CLEAR PATH TO AN ATOMIC

41
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:58,890
ARSENAL.

42
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,358
>> Shannon: WHY JAY, WE WILL

43
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:01,492
START WITH YOU.

44
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:06,064
WHO IS RIGHT AND WHO IS WRONG?

45
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:09,500
>> IT'S WHAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE

46
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,505
HAS BEEN SAYING.

47
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,507
BEBE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.

48
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,910
HE HAD THE SLIDE THAT SAYS "IRAN

49
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,310
LIED."

50
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,311
OF COURSE THEY LIED.

51
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,113
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE THE DEAL.

52
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,114
IF THEY DIDN'T LIE WE COULD

53
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:23,514
TRUST THEM.

54
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,916
WE WOULD NEED THE DEAL.

55
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,517
IT COULD BE BASED ON FAITH AND

56
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:26,884
GOODWILL.

57
00:01:26,884 --> 00:01:29,487
THE REASON WE HAVE THE DEAL WITH

58
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:30,154
ITS INTENSE VERIFICATION WAS

59
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:31,889
GENERAL MATUS WAS CALLING ROBUST

60
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,691
IS BECAUSE THIS IS A GOVERNMENT

61
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,526
THAT WE DON'T TRUST AND WE HAVE

62
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:35,960
NEVER TRUSTED.

63
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,128
GENERAL MATUS HAD A GREAT MIND

64
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,297
ABOUT WHEN HE WAS LOOKING AT THE

65
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,131
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL.

66
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,966
HE WAS SAYING THIS WAS WRITTEN

67
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:42,934
WITH AN INTENT THAT IRAN WAS

68
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:44,602
GOING TO TRY TO CHEAT AND TRY TO

69
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:45,303
LIVE.

70
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,772
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE VERIFICATION

71
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:48,673
OF 24/7 ACCESS TO KEY

72
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:49,540
FACILITIES.

73
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,310
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CONTINUOUS

74
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,945
CAMERA ACCESS OF LOTS OF

75
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,179
DIFFERENT POINTS OF ENTRY.

76
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:57,515
THAT'S WHY THE IAEA INSPECTORS

77
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,885
HAVE ACCESS TO ANY SITES,

78
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,453
DECLARED OR UNDECLARED, CIVILIAN

79
00:02:02,453 --> 00:02:02,887
OR MILITARY.

80
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:06,691
THIS IS A DEAL THAT'S WORKING.

81
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,326
>> Shannon: YOU KNOW THERE ARE

82
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:09,860
PLENTY OF CRITICS, INCLUDING THE

83
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,129
PRIME MINISTER TODAY SAY THEY

84
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,063
HAVE LIED TO INSPECTORS, THAT

85
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,064
THERE IS NOT IMMEDIATE ACCESS.

86
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,532
THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF DAYS OR

87
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,200
WEEKS IN WHICH THEY MAY MOVE OR

88
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,768
HIDE THINGS.

89
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:19,304
HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

90
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,705
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DESTROY

91
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,740
WHEN THE DEAL CAME BACK TOGETHER

92
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,074
IN 2015.

93
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,109
IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE

94
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,144
PROGRESS OF THEIR PROGRAM, AND

95
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,345
INSTEAD THEY DID NOT.

96
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,480
ACCORDING TO THE ISRAELIS IN

97
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,715
THESE DOCUMENTS, THEY ADMIT THEY

98
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,684
STOLE, THEY SAY WHAT THEY HAVE

99
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:33,518
SHOWS THINGS WEREN'T DESTROYED,

100
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,652
THE PROGRAM WAS KEPT AT THE

101
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:39,290
READY SO THAT WHEN THESE

102
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,525
SANCTIONS ON THEM OR OTHER

103
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,526
SAFEGUARDS ON THEM EVENTUALLY

104
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,061
EXPIRED, THEY WOULD BE READY TO

105
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,095
RAMP IT BACK UP.

106
00:02:44,095 --> 00:00:00,000
JASON, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FELT
