if you take your hand and you go open and close you can feel the muscles in your forearm contract when you have a fist your forearm is small when you have your hand open your forearm is big so you want to create slack by open hands and then you're going to pull those hands your elbows and you're going to shoot them past your rib cage as hard and violently as you can and it turns your body into a wedge in the tape will shear it'll look like it's been cut with scissors that will work for duct tape and zip ties but anything beyond that you have to get more creative wiggle or use tools around you a friction you know you can you can use the corner of a wall and cut your way out if you find yourself being bound the good idea is to get big take a big breath if they're trying to wrap around your chest flex your muscles make everything as big as possible that way when it's time to escape you get small and all of a sudden all that slack appears and now you can wiggle out or get out of the restraints however you can probably the easiest thing to do to be more pre-emptive and proactive is carry a razor blade and carry a handcuff key you can hide them in your shoes that way if you're bound in front or bound from behind you can still squat down and get to your shoes and free yourself if you don't have any of those on here you can't get to your tools you really just have to think outside the box and find different things in your environment that you can either you know friction through it burn through it cut it share it whatever it takes to get it going so that you can free yourself
