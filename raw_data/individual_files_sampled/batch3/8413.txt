AN ETERNITY FOR DIPLOMACY. MARTHA? Martha: TRACE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. HERE NOW GENERAL JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST AND CHAIRMAN OF THE INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF WAR. GENERAL, THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN QUITE AN INTERESTING ROLLER COASTER TO WATCH. MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEEN TWICE NOW TO NORTH KOREA. SO I GUESS ON THIS ROUND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU’RE GOING TO COME TO US IN NEW YORK. WE’RE GOING TO TALK THERE. WHILE ANOTHER DELEGATES HAS GONE OVER TO DISCUSS DENUCLEARIZATION AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WHERE DOES THIS ALL STAND IN YOUR MIND? WELL, I THINK THE VISIT OF THE NORTH KOREAN ENVOY HERE IS SOMETHING OF THAT STATURE WHO CLEARLY HAS BEEN ALL THE MAJOR NEGOTIATION POINTS, HE IS OBVIOUSLY CARRYING A MESSAGE. AND I THINK FIRST, THAT MESSAGE IS THAT KIM JONG UN DEFINITELY WANTS THE SUMMIT GO FORWARD. THE PRESIDENT DEFINITELY HASN’T MADE THAT FINAL DECISION YET. HE STUNNED THE CHINESE AND NORTH KOREANS AND SOUTH KOREANS AS WELL WHEN HE STAGED THE SUMMIT. LACK OF SERIOUSNESS ON THE PART OF THE NORTH KOREANS UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE CHINESE. IS HE CARRYING THAT MESSAGE WE WANT THIS SUMMIT TO GO FORWARD. AND I THINK LIKELY HE IS TRYING TO GET THE ACTUAL CONTENT OF THE SUMMIT BACK ON TRACK THAT KIM JONG UN IS SERIOUS ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION WHETHER HE TRULY IS OR NOT, REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WHAT THESE GUYS SAY AND WHAT THEY DO LARGELY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I THINK IS HE LARGELY TRYING TO CONVEY A MESSAGE THAT KIM JONG UN IS ABSOLUTELY COMMIT YOU HAD FROM THE UNITED STATES MAJOR CONCESSION TO HIM IS THAT THE SECURITY OF HIS REGIME INDEFINITELY. BUT I DO THINK THE KEY MEETING IS ALSO GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND IS TAKING PLACE YESTERDAY WITH OUR DELEGATES AND DELEGATION. THAT’S WHAT IT ALL COMES DOWN, TO WHAT DOES DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN? WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? IS IT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN A COUPLE OF STAGES BECAUSE IN THE PAST WE HAVE BEEN PROMISED THAT AND GOTTEN NOTHING. WE HAVE SEEN THOSE FACILITIES REOPENED, REOPERATING IN NO TIME AFTER THEY GOT THEIR MONEY ESSENTIALLY. WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO LOOK LIKE IN YOUR MIND? WELL, I THINK WHAT THE LEADER OF OUR DELEGATES, KIM IS PROBABLY ASKING THE NORTH KOREANS AND WANTING FROM THEM, IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, GIVE US A FULL ACCOUNTING OF YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND YOUR MISSILES, WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED. WHERE THE STORAGE SITES ARE. WHERE THE FUEL SITES ARE ET CETERA. LET’S PUT TOGETHER A PROCESS TO VERIFY AND OUR ABILITY TO OVERSEE YOUR DISARMING AND DISMANTLING THAT ON SOME KIND OF A SCHEDULE THAT MAKES SENSE. NOT SOMETHING THAT’S GOING TO TAKE MANY YEARS BUT SOMETHING THAT’S REASONABLE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. I’M CONFIDENT DELEGATION WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT FROM THE NORTH KOREANS. WHETHER THEY WOULD WANT TO PUT THAT ON THE TABLE OR NOT IS ANOTHER MANNER. LIKELY THERE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENCES, MARTHA. THE SUMMIT HINGES ON WHETHER OUR DELEGATION IN THEIR MINDS CAN RESOLVE SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCES THROUGH NEGOTIATION WHERE THE SUMMIT CAN AT LEAST HAVE THE STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND BEGIN A PROCESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IF THEY THINK IT’S NOT RESOLVABLE, THEN I THINK THE SUMMIT WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL WE’RE ABLE TO CHANGE THOSE CONDITIONS A LITTLE BIT. Martha: FASCINATING. YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THEY ALREADY KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN’T APPROVE OF THE IRAN MODEL. SO THAT’S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. AND IT’S PROBABLY THE MODEL THAT THEY WOULD MOST LIKE SO WE’LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES. GENERAL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. MARTHA, ONE MORE THING. THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT THEY CAN’T PLAY DONALD TRUMP. CHINA, NORTH KOREA, AND EVEN SOUTH KOREA HAVE ALL TRIED THAT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT. Martha: NANCY PELOSI SAID HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE FIT OVER THIS LETTER KIM JONG UN, SHE IS NOTICEABLY
