>>> THIS SIS AN ABC NEWS SPECIA 
REPORT.
CRISIS IN SYRIA.
NOW REPORTING.
DAVID MUELLER.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
DAVID MUELLER REPORTING TONIGHT 
FROM BEIRUT.
WE COME ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SET TO 
ADDRESS THE NATION MOMENTARILY.
IT'S BELIEVED HE WILL ADDRESS 
THE NATION ABOUT SYRIA.
AS YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID A MILITARY STRIKE COULD BE 
COMING.
HE HAS SAID THAT EARLIER IN THE 
WEEK AND CONTINUED TO MEET WITH 
HIS TOP NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISERS THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.
I DO WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AT THE
WHITE HOUSE MONOITORING 
DEVELOPMENTS.
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ADDRESSING
THE NATION FROM THE DIPLOMATIC 
ROOM.
WHAT DO WE KNOW AT THIS POINT?
>> Reporter: THERE'S A LOT OF 
ACTIVITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO'S 
TRAVELING ABROAD AND POOL 
REPORTERS TRAVELING WITH HIM 
WERE UNEXPECTEDLY RUSHED BACK TO
THEIR HOTEL.
DEFINITELY SOME ACTIVITY 
HAPPENING HERE.
THIS IS ALL COMING, OF COURSE, 
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
ROUNDLY CRITICIZED FOR DOING 
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD 
NEVER DO.
WHICH IS BROADCASTING HIS PLANS 
FOR AN ATTACK IN SYRIA.
OF COURSE, THAT TWEET THIS WEEK,
WHERE HE SAID BE READY, RUSSIA, 
NICE, NEW, SMART MISSILES WILL 
BE COMING.
INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HE SAYS 
HERE THIS EVENING, DAVID, HOW 
MUCH RUSSIA PLAYS INTO THIS.
>> ALL RIGHT, CECILIA, STAY WITH
US AS WE PREPARE TO HEAR FROM 
THE PRESIDENT.
SECRETARY MATTIS IS OVER AT THE 
PENTAGON.
THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE 
NATION FROM THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM.
>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS, B A 
SHORT TIME AGO, I ORDERED THE 
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO 
LAUNCH PRECISION STRIKES ON 
TARGETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES OF
SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR AL ASSAD.
A COMBINED OPERATION WITH THE 
ARMED FORCES OF FRANCE AND THE 
UNITED KINGDOM IS NOW UNDER WAY.
WE THANK THEM BOTH.
TONIGHT, I WANT TO SPEAK WITH 
YOU ABOUT WHY WE HAVE TAKEN THIS
ACTION.
ONE YEAR AGO, ASSAD LAUNCHED A 
SAVAGE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK 
AGAINST HIS OWN INNOCENT PEOPLE.
THE UNITED STATES RESPONDED WITH
58 MISSILE STRIKES THAT 
DESTROYED 20% OF THE SYRIAN AIR 
FORCE.
LAST SATURDAY, THE ASSAD REGIME 
DEPLOYED CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO 
SLAUGHTER INNOCENT CIVILIANS 
THIS TIME IN THE TOWN OF DOUMA 
NEAR THE SYRIAN CAPITAL OF 
DAMASCUS.
THIS MASSACRE WAS A SIGNIFICANT 
ESCALATION IN A PATTERN OF 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE BY THAT 
VERY TERRIBLE REGIME.
THE EVIL AND THE DESPICABLE 
ATTACK LEFT MOTHERS AND FATHERS,
INFANTS AND CHILDREN, THRASHING 
IN PAIN AND GASPING FOR AIR.
THESE ARE NOT THE ACTIONS OF A 
MAN, THEY ARE CRIMES OF A 
MONSTER INSTEAD.
FOLLOWING THE HORRORS OF WORLD 
WAR I A CENTURY AGO, CIVILIZED 
NATIONS JOINED TOGETHER TO BAN 
CHEMICAL WARFARE.
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE UNIQUELY 
DANGEROUS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY 
INFLICT GRUESOME SUFFERING, BUT 
BECAUSE EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS CAN 
UNLEASH WIDESPREAD DEVASTATION.
THE PURPOSE OF OUR ACTIONS 
TONIGHT IS TO ESTABLISH A STRONG
DETERRENT AGAINST THE 
PRODUCTION, SPREAD, AND USE OF 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
ESTABLISHING THIS DETERRENT IS A
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST
OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE COMBINED AMERICAN, BRITISH, 
AND FRENCH RESPONSE TO THESE 
ATROCITIES WILL INTEGRATE ALL 
INSTRUMENTS OF OUR NATIONAL 
POWER, MILITARY, ECONOMIC, AND 
DIPLOMATIC.
WE ARE PREPARED TO SUSTAIN THIS 
RESPONSE UNTIL THE SYRIAN REGIME
STOPS ITS USE OF PROHIBITED 
CHEMICAL AGENTS.
I ALSO HAVE A MESSAGE TONIGHT 
FOR THE TWO GOVERNMENTS MOST 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING, 
EQUIPPING AND FINANCING THE 
CRIMINAL ASSAD REGIME.
TO IRAN AND TO RUSSIA, I ASK, 
WHAT KIND OF A NATION WANTS TO 
BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MASS 
MURDER OF INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN, 
AND CHILDREN?
THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CAN BE 
JUDGED BY THE FRIENDS THEY KEEP.
NO NATION CAN SUCCEED IN THE 
LONG RUN BY PROMOTING ROGUE 
STATES, BRUTAL TYRANTS AND 
MURDEROUS DICTATORS.
IN 2013 PRESIDENT PUTIN AND HIS 
GOVERNMENT PROMISED THE WORLD 
THAT THEY WOULD GUARANTEE THE 
ELIMINATION OF SYRIA'S CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS.
ASSAD'S RECENT ATTACK AND 
TODAY'S RESPONSE ARE THE DIRECT 
RESULT OF RUSSIA'S FAILURE TO 
KEEP THAT PROMISE.
RUSSIA MUST DECIDE IF IT WILL 
CONTINUE DOWN THIS DARK PATH OR 
IF IT WILL JOIN WITH CIVILIZED 
NATIONS AS A FORCE FOR STABILITY
AND PEACE.
HOPEFULLY SOMEDAY WE'LL GET 
ALONG WITH RUSSIA AND MAYBE EVEN
IRAN, BUT MAYBE NOT.
I WILL SAY THIS.
THE UNITED STATES HAS A LOT TO 
OFFER.
WITH THE GREATEST AND MOST 
POWERFUL ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY 
OF THE WORLD, IN SYRIA, THE 
UNITED STATES, WITH BUT A SMALL 
FORCE BEING USED TO ELIMINATE 
WHAT IS LEFT OF ISIS IS DOING 
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
OVER THE LAST YEAR, NEARLY 100% 
OF THE TERRITORY ONCE CONTROLLED
BY THE SO-CALLED ISIS CALIPHATE 
IN SYRIA AND IRAQ HAS BEEN 
LIBERATED AND ELIMINATED.
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO 
REBUILT OUR FRIENDSHIPS ACROSS 
THE MIDDLE EAST.
WE HAVE ASKED OUR PARTNERS TO 
TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
SECURING THEIR HOME REGION 
INCLUDING CONTRIBUTING LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR THE 
RESOURCES, EQUIPMENT AND ALL OF 
THE ANTI-ISIS EFFORT.
INCREASED ENGAGEMENT FROM OUR 
FRIENDS INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA, 
THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, QATAR,
EGYPT, AND OTHERS, CAN ENSURE 
THAT IRAN DOES NOT PROFIT FROM 
PR THE ERADICATION OF ISIS.
AMERICA DOES NOT SEEK AN 
INDEFINITE PRESENCE IN SYRIA 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES.
AS OTHER NATIONS STEP UP THEIR 
CONTRIBUTIONS, WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO THE DAY WHEN WE CAN BRING OUR
WARRIORS HOME AND GREAT 
WARRIORS, THEY ARE.
LOOKING AROUND OUR VERY TROUBLED
WORLD, AMERICANS HAVE NO 
ILLUSIONS.
WE CANNOT PURGE THE WORLD OF 
EVIL OR ACT EVERYWHERE THERE IS 
TYRANNY.
NO AMOUNT OF AMERICAN BLOOD OR 
TREASURE CAN PRODUCE LASTING 
PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE
EAST.
IT'S A TROUBLED PLACE.
WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT BETTER, 
BUT IT IS A TROUBLED PLACE.
THE UNITED STATES WILL BE A 
PARTNER AND A FRIEND, BUT THE 
FATE OF THE REGION LIES IN THE 
HANDS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE.
IN THE LAST CENTURY, WE LOOKED 
STRAIGHT INTO THE DARKEST PLACES
OF THE HUMAN SOUL.
WE SAW THE ANGUISH THAT CAN BE 
UNLEASHED AND THE EVIL THAT CAN 
TAKE HOLD.
BY THE END OF WORLD WAR I, MORE 
THAN 1 MILLION PEOPLE HAD BEEN 
KILLED OR INJURED BY CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS.
WE NEVER WANT TO SEE THAT 
GHASTLY SPECTER RETURN.
SO TODAY, THE NATIONS OF 
BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA, HAVE 
MARSHALLED THEIR RIGHTEOUS POWER
AGAINST BARBARISM AND BRUTALITY.
 TONIGHT I ASK ALL AMERICANS TO 
SAY A PRAYER FOR OUR NOBLE 
WARRIORS AND OUR ALLIES AS THEY 
CARRY OUT THEIR MISSIONS.
WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL BRING 
COMFORT TO THOSE SUFFERING IN 
SYRIA.
WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL GUIDE THE 
WHOLE REGION TOWARD A FUTURE OF 
DIGNITY AND OF PEACE.
AND WE PRAY THAT GOD WILL 
CONTINUE TO WATCH OVER AND BLESS
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU, AND GOOD NIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING 
THE NATION TONIGHT, REVEALING TO
THE NATION WE HAVE NOW LAUNCHED 
PRECISION STRIKES ON SYRIA AIMED
AT THEIR CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
HE REVEALED THIS IS A COMBINED 
OPERATION OF BOTH THE U.S., THE 
UK, AND FRANCE.
HE'D BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH 
LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.
HE TALKED ABOUT PRESIDENT ASSAD 
IN SYRIA SAYING THESE ARE THE 
CRIMES OF A MONSTER, DESCRIBING 
THE MOTHERS, THE CHILDREN, THE 
PARENTS WE SAW IN THOSE IMAGES 
GASPING FOR AIR.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF 
GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT 
MARTHA RADDATZ WHO'S BEEN 
MONITORING THIS ALL WEEK.
NOW THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH 
TONIGHT, MARCIA.
WHAT KIND OF STRIKE IS UNDER WAY
AT THIS HOUR.
HE'S REVEALED HE'S WORKING WITH 
ALLIES BOTH FROM THE UK AND FROM
FRANCE TONIGHT.
>> HE CERTAINLY IS.
AND THERE ARE WARPLANES IN THE 
AREA AND WARSHIPS AS WELL.
THE WORDS HE USED WERE THEY 
WOULD GO AFTER CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
CAPABILITIES.
AND I THINK THAT COULD BE 
ANYTHING FROM AIRFIELDS TO 
AIRCRAFT.
THEY BELIEVE THESE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED FROM 
BARREL BOMBS, FROM HELICOPTERS.
SO THEY WILL CERTAINLY GO AFTER 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE ALL 
BEEN WATCHING, DAVID, THIS WEEK,
IS HOW STRONG AN IMPACT IT WILL 
HAVE.
LAST YEAR, THEY DID BOMB THAT 
AIRFIELD AND WITHIN DAYS IT WAS 
WORKING ONCE AGAIN.
THERE WERE AIRPLANES LAUNCHED.
SO WHAT THEY WENT AFTER TONIGHT,
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
THE PENTAGON WILL HAVE A PRESS 
BRIEFING IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND
FILL US IN ON EXACTLY WHAT WAS 
HIT AND HOW STRONG AN IMPACT 
THEY THINK IT WILL HAVE.
ONE OF THE THINGS SECRETARY 
MATTIS SAID JUST YESTERDAY WHICH
GIVES YOU SOME IDEA OF WHAT 
THEIR CONCERNS WERE IS HE SAID 
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T 
ADD ANY CIVILIAN DEATHS.
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THE MURDER 
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE, BUT ON A 
STRATEGIC LEVEL, IT'S HOW DO WE 
KEEP THIS FROM ESCALATING OUT OF
CONTROL AND THAT HAS BEEN A REAL
CONCERN OF SECRETARY MATTIS.
HE DOES NOT WANT THIS TO 
ESCALATE.
HE DOES NOT WANT IT TO GO BEYOND
THE BORDERS.
>> AND MARTHA, AS YOU POINT OUT,
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES.
LET'S BRING IN STEVE TONIGHT 
WHO'S WATCHING THIS UNFOLD WITH 
US, RETIRED COLONEL GANIARD.
WHAT KIND OF STRIKE DO YOU THINK
IS TAKING PLACE, WILL THIS BE A 
RESCISSION STRIKE IN ONE 
SPECIFIC LOCATION, OR DO YOU 
GATHER GIVEN HE TALKED ABOUT 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CAPABILITIES 
THIS COULD BE MULTIPLE SITE 
WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT?
>> DAVID, THIS WAS A COORDINATED
CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK BY THE SEA
AND AIR BY U.S., FRENCH, AND 
BRITISH FORCES AGAINST NUMEROUS 
TARGETS WITHIN SYRIA.
>> NUMEROUS TARGETS.
HOW MANY DO YOU BELIEVE AND WHAT
KINDS OF TARGETS?
>> WELL, WE'LL WAIT ON DETAILS 
FROM THE PENTAGON, DAVID, BUT AS
MARTHA NOTED RIGHT AT THE TOP OF
THE LIST WILL BE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS STORAGE FACILITIES.
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ASKED FOR A BROADER 
SET OF TARGETS THIS TIME.
HE WANTS TO DEAL A CRIPPLING 
BLOW TO THE ASSAD REGIME.
SO WE MAY SEE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT
ALSO SEE MILITARY COMMAND AND 
CONTROL, INTELLIGENCE 
HEADQUARTERS, AND DAVID, IF YOU 
LOOK OUT THERE TO THE EAST OF 
DAM
DAMASCUS AT DUMARY AIR BASE, 
WHERE THE ATTACK ON DOUMA CAME 
FROM.
THAT AIRFIELD WILL LIKELY BE ON 
THE LIST OF TARGETS TONIGHT. 
>> COLONEL, YOU HEARD THE 
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT THE U.S. 
STRIKE JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
MARTHA POINTED OUT THAT THE 
AIRSTRIP WAS BEING USED 
LITERALLY WITHIN DAYS OF THE 
STRIKE.
DO YOU GATHER THE STRIKE THIS 
TIME AROUND OR SERIES OF STRIKES
WILL BE FAR MORE POTENT?
>> I THINK IT WILL HAVE TO BE.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD TO 
MAKE A STATEMENT AND THE 
STATEMENT WE MADE LAST TIME WAS 
NOTHING MORE THAN A WARNING.
I THINK THIS TIME WHAT'S 
INTERESTING IF YOU NOTE THESE 
RINGS ON THE MAP HERE, THESE ARE
RINGS THAT REPRESENT THE MAXIMUM
EFFECTIVE RANGE OF TWO VERY 
SOPHISTICATED RUSSIAN SURFACE TO
AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS THAT 
MILITARY PLANNERS ARE TRYING TO 
HAVE TO AVOID.
THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE RUSSIANS 
ARE GOING TO TRY TO SHOOT DOWN 
THE ALLIIED CRUISE MISSILES IN 
FLIGHT.
MILITARY PLANNERS HAVE HAD TO 
FLY THE MISSILES LOW THROUGH THE
MOUNTAINS OF LEBANON TO GET TO 
THEIR TARGETS IN DAMASCUS, 
LITERALLY FLYING UNDER THE 
RADAR.
>> YEAH, WE SIMPLY DO NOT KNOW 
AT THIS HOUR IF THE RUSSIANS 
WILL TAKE COUNTERMEASURES THOUGH
THEY THREATENED TO DO SO EARLIER
IN THE WEEK.
I WANT TO BRING IN OUR SENIOR 
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT WITH US 
FROM ENGLAND.
YOU HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SINGLE
OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN, BUT IN 
PARTICULAR VLADIMIR PUTIN.
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IT WAS 
RUSSIA'S RESPONSIBILITY TO 
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS WOULD NOT BE
LONGER IN SYRIA.
YET WE WITNESSED THIS ATTACK IN 
THE LAST WEEK.
>> LET'S NOT FORGET, ABOUT, 
PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW HIS RED 
LINE IT WAS RUSSIA THAT ACTED AS
AGUARANTOR.
THE ACCUSATION TONIGHT IS IT 
DIDN'T HOLD TRUE TO ITS WORD.
HOWEVER, THERE SEEMED TO BE AN 
OLIVE BRANCH TO IRAN AND RUSSIA.
WASN'T QUITE AS HARD LINE AS THE
TWEETS WE SAW EARLIER.
TALKING OF TWEETS WE'RE SEEING 
EARLY SOUNDS OF PEOPLE REPORTING
SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS AROUND 
DIFFERENT PARTS OF DAMASCUS AND 
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
THIS EVENING NONE OF THAT IS 
VERIFIED AT THE MOMENT, BUT AS 
COLONEL GANIARD SUGGESTED, THIS 
IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER ATTACK, 
BIGGER STRIKE THAN WE SAW ONE 
YEAR AGO.
I MEAN, IT HAS TO BE IF IT'S 
GOING TO TRY AND ACHIEVE THEIR 
OBJECTIVE.
>> LIKELY A LARGE LAR ATTACK THA
YEAR AGO.
OUR THANKS TO YOU.
I WANT TO BRING IN CECILIA VEGA.
YOU'VE BEEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
ALL WEEK.
EARLIER THIS WEEK PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SENT OUT THE TWEET SAYING 
MISSILES WERE COMING TO BE 
READY, THEY'D BE NICE, NEW, 
SMART.
HE WAS CRITICIZING FOR 
TELEGRAPHING TO THE WORLD WHAT 
WAS COMING WHEN HE SAID SO OFTEN
DURING THE CAMPAIGN HE'D NEVER 
DO THAT.
THERE SEEMED TO BE A BIT OF A 
SLOWDOWN AS THE WEEK PROGRESSED 
AS HE BEGAN TALKING WITH 
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE TOP SECURITY TEAM
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> Reporter: HE WAS SO ROUNDLY 
CRITICIZED, DAVID, FOR DOING 
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE WOULD 
NEVER DO WHICH IS BROADCASTING 
HIS MILITARY PLANS AND AS YOU 
SAID EXACTLY SEEMED TO SORT OF 
DIAL THAT BACK.
EARLY ON IN THE WEEK THE 
PRESIDENT SAID A DECISION WOULD 
BE 24-48 HOURS.
WE ARE NOW DAY FROM THAT.
FINALLY THIS DECISION MADE.
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WATCHING TO 
SEE WHETHER HE WOULD TAKE A HARD
LINE WITH PUTIN AS HE DID OVER 
TWITTER AGAIN THIS WEEK NAMING 
HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME BY NAME 
CALLING HIM OUT IN HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH SYRIA'S BASHAR
AL ASSAD.
I GOT TO TELL YOU, DAVID, YOU 
KNOW, ALL OF THIS, OF COURSE, 
HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER FOR 
THIS WHITE HOUSE.
IT COMES VERY MUCH WITH SO MANY 
DISTRACTIONS, WHAT THEY ARE 
DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW.
THIS MAJOR FIGHT BREWING BETWEEN
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
IT'S HARD TO -- IT HAS BEEN 
HARD, I THINK, FOR THEM TO 
CONCENTRATE, FOCUS ON SYRIA, 
WITH ALL OF THAT GOING ON IN THE
BACKGROUND.
>> AND YET THOSE STRIKES HAVE 
BEEN LAUNCHED TONIGHT AS THE 
PRESIDENT BALANCES ALL OF THIS.
CECILIA, OUR THANKS TO YOU AS 
WELL.
AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ADDRESSING THE NATION JUST A 
SHORT TIME AGO.
REVEALING TO THE COUNTRY THAT WE
HAVE LAUNCHED PRECISION STRIKES 
AGAINST SYRIA AIMED AT 
DECIMATING THEIR CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS CAPABILITIES.
IT'S BELIEVED THESE STRIKES WILL
BE MUCH STRONGER AND THE STRIKES
JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
WE WILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT UNFOLDS
TONIGHT.
NO REACTION FROM RUSSIA AS OF 
YET, BUT THE PRESIDENT DID 
REVEAL THIS IS THE WORK OF NOT 
ONLY THE U.S. MILITARY, BUT THE 
UK AND FRANCE.
TWO OF OUR STRONGEST ALLIES AT 
WORK TONIGHT IN THE SKIES OVER 
SYRIA.
I'M DAVID MUIR REPORTING FROM 
THE REGION HERE IN BEIRUT.
WE WILL HAVE CONTINUING 
DEVELOPMENTS ONLINE AND FOR 
THOSE OF YOU WATCHING IN THE 
WEST TONIGHT, A SPECIAL EDITION 
OF "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" COMING 
UP SHORTLY.
FOR THE REST OF YOU, ENJOY THE 
REST OF YOUR EVENING.
I'M DAVID MUIR.
GOOD NIGHT.
