crises crises everywhere no no no I'm not talking about starvation or war genocide civil unrest rape murder or poverty no no no what I'm talking about is a tape in which a guy that we know pays off

stuff the big topic today we're talking about the tape Michael Cohen did he flip did Fredo flip I know it was you Michael never take sides against the family again was it let's see let's listen to the bombshell tape the CNN got and that all the mainstream media outlets are reporting on what it means for Trump what it means for the Muller investigation what it means for all of this and all of the terrible crises in our country here is the Michael Cohen super secret Donald Trump tape I've spoken to Alan weiselberger about to set the whole thing up with funding yes and it's all the stuff I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so that I'm gonna do that right away I've actually come up with me so I'm all over that and I spoke to Alan about it when it comes time for the financing which will be easy listen what financing will have to do so I got no no okay there it is and so you can hear they're making a lot out of this they say okay we got to pay are we gonna pay and Trump you can't hear because it's all muffled says cash and Cohen says no no no no we're gonna pay and Trump says check right so what they're alleging what Michael Cohen's lawyer is alleging what the anti-trump forces are alleging is that Trump wanted to pay cash to pay off these girls that he had allegedly slept with and Cohen said no no no no no but when you hear the tape it's pretty clear he's saying annoy with cash don't pay with cash is now what Trump's team is saying and that seems plausible look I I will admit when President Trump is a twisting language a little bit you know in Helsinki he said I meant to say wouldn't but I said would I this is not one of those cases this is one it is clearly saying something oh no no no cash no no no I got this check it does it don't you're not gonna pay with cash no no no you pay with cheque right okay so that's fine now this is the big bombshell right it comes out it actually tells us a lot about Trump's media strategy but let's check in on the legality of all this does this constitute a crime you know there's a girly-girl alleges that President Trump slept with her and he's basically before the election he's just paying these people off to keep quiet they're a couple of things that are pretty funny about this one it reminds me of that Mark Wahlberg movie for brothers where they say I'll try to clean up the language they say you don't pay a ho to sleep with you you pay her to go home and that's what we're pretty interesting in this story both with stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal the new Playboy Playmate that allegedly slept with Trump ten years ago they say that they after their romantic tryst Trump offered to pay them and both stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal when they're talking to the media they say I was so offended by this he I'm not that kind of girl I can't believe you would call me that kind of girl to pay me to sleep with me I can't believe you would allege that but then then they took all the money later isn't that interesting they said you know they they said no I don't hand me an envelope full of money that makes me feel like a prostitute I want you to hand me a lot lot more money later on to keep quiet then I won't feel like a prostitute it's pretty funny because you know I don't know what was Trump gonna pay them to sleep with them I can't imagine that much money but then later on they say no no I don't want that money I want $150,000 to keep quiet so really it's funny because they're all these tears on camera oh I cried I couldn't believe he thought that I would accept money because I had sex with him and I said well darling didn't you accept $150,000 well yeah but that was different because that was a little later okay fine was there a crime committed that's the question we talked to a wonderful brilliant law Professor Alan Dershowitz on the show last week here as Alan Dershowitz weighing in on whether this demonstrates a crime no it sounds very plausible especially since they did seem to use the word plural that perhaps what the president and Cohen were discussing is in the run-up to the election there were probably going to be lots of people who will come and demand cash in order not to embarrass the president just before the election and they were discussing how to set up a corporation to make payments if necessary to keep it from influencing the election that happens all the time that happens all the time Dershowitz this point is this doesn't demonstrate a crime he's now there the one flipside one argument that some of the anti-trump people are making is that this is similar to John Edwards you remember John Edwards former senator or vice presidential candidate Democrat he he was paying paying off his mistress and this was a campaign finance violation and it really got him for it but if that is the the line that they're drawing if that's the analogy here this bodes very well for Donald Trump because the prosecution never got John Edwards he never he never convicted of anything that's what that worked out just fine for him and what really hurt John Edwards is he portrayed himself as this good Christian man as upright citizen that's wonderful you know and then it turns out he was cheating with this mistress on his wife who was dying of cancer that really blew up his entire career obviously with Donald Trump you don't have that problem what's the new information President Trump paid off women that allege that he slept with them president Trump is bragged about that there's no new information conveyed it's not going to destroy his political career certainly and what's the legal problem if John Edwards wasn't convicted for these crimes what how are they going to get Donald Trump on this so half decide with Alan Dershowitz here this can't be this doesn't seem to present a really big issue for him it doesn't presume to present any new information either we know that he slept with these women ten years ago we know that he likes Playboy Playmates okay no new information now this brings up the next question why did he allow this tape to come out because the media aren't really reporting on this President Trump has attorney-client privilege here these were tapes Michael Cohen recorded him his lawyer recorded this conversation why did Trump waive attorney-client privilege Trump allowed this tape to come out well there are a few reasons clearly President Trump doesn't think that this is going to kill him if he thought this was going to kill him he wouldn't have waived attorney-client privilege Trump is now coming out and playing this against Michael Cohen so he tweeted out he said what kind of lawyer would tape apply him so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated well I was presumably saying positive things I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad so he's he's insinuating that Michael Cohen as a bad lawyer he's a crooked lawyer there's something wrong with him fair enough I don't know what kind of lawyer tapes his client like that and would betray his benefactor I mean you know Dante puts the people who betray their benefactors in the lowest circle of hell this is a really bad thing and Michael Cohen is apparently turning on Trump he says the truth is gonna come out he's hired Lanny Davis were going after Donald Trump so it does raise questions about Cohen and raises questions about his integrity if he if he has any integrity I don't know that people ever thought he had integrity but the fact that he would tape Trump the fact that he's turning against his benefactor really does raise those questions and so I think that plays to Trump's advantage in all of this but doesn't everything else play to Trump's advantage here the the there was public polling that shows that the vast majority of Americans do not care about the stormy Daniels story they don't care about it at all there's also there was a new poll out from Quinnipiac it showed that twenty point one percent of the entire American electorate considers the mainstream media the enemy of the people if they consider this story ginned up by the media this is a media and non traversée 21 percent of all voters and 18 percent of independents so that number holds strong there that seems pretty strong you know I was listening to Rush Limbaugh earlier who is one of the best observers of politics of course but he said without this sex stuff the stormy Daniels all of the in Mulder investigation he thinks that president Trump's approval rating could be at 60% it's already very high it's already at 45% but it could be at 60 I have to disagree with Rush here I'm not sure about that I think if if people weren't focused on the sex stuff if people weren't focused on Russia on the Moller investigation the witch-hunt they'd be focused on something else they gin up some other crisis they've try to focus on the border the you know the the people being ripped from their families at the border or they'd focus on some company going out of business even though we have a record low unemployment and a booming economy they just focus on other real things and for President Trump this is manageable the sex stuff is manageable it doesn't really hurt him it's already hurt him whatever effect that's gonna have on him it's already have this Russia investigation it doesn't hurt him public polling consistently shows the American people don't care about Russia don't care about stormy Daniels don't care or the new girl Karen McDougal I do google her name because I don't even who cares it's just kind of floating in the air not not the worst thing in the world so I I do i I do want to find out how intentional this is is this really the you know the lawyer turning on Trump and Trump turning on the lawyer it's gonna or is this more good TV I you know everything with Donald Trump is it seems to be a manipulation of the media I'm not saying he plays for teach I'm not saying he's met her dick or something I'm saying that he's really good at the media he has been for decades and this could be another example of this as long as the spotlight is on the sex and the Russia it's not on other things and president Trump gets to go on with his with his very effective administration you know there's a reason that his approval rating is so high it's a 45% and they seem to be doing something right here to help me analyze this maybe I'm just looking at the glass half-full here let's bring on it Chad Prather you know Chad Prather from his viral video it's pretty where you first saw him unapologetically southern you might have seen him do a hit with me on Fox and Friends and you might know him from the Chad pray their show his podcast he's got a comedy tour going on let's bring on Chad you there hey Michael good to hear from you man good to see you again Chad thanks for coming on I appreciate it so you're on the road right now is that right you're you're doing your comedy tour I am so it's always great when your assistant or white male walking around San Jose with a cowboy hat on he gets some eyes you know I love saying whoo I love saying who gets triggered yeah just all of them yeah it's another good example of owning the libs which I strongly encourage I'm a big proponent of that I want to know with this Trump stuff you are touring around you're on the road you're you're in places that constitute sometimes real America how do you think this plays the tape and the Michael Cohen and the Muller investigation and this sex and the Russia and the blah blah blah what is your sense do people care about this or they really worked up about this how is Trump playing it not a bit there you know people are gonna come to my shows and it doesn't matter it's funny Michael because I've done shows now I've got two shows tonight tomorrow night in San Jose California obviously not a conservative bastion in America I've got I've had sold-out shows in Portland Oregon Eugene Medford Oregon Seattle Washington New York New Jersey you get my point and people drive in to these places and they sit down and they enjoy a show and not a single person is distracted by these things yeah occasionally you might hear somebody who says I wish the president wouldn't tweet that you know some some ladies ring in her hands god I just wish you wouldn't do that but all that's just that's just Trump and I think that's everybody's attitude you know the thing is we what we're facing and you know this so well it's just distractions and if it wasn't this distraction it would be another distraction and that's what that's what the media and and the left is continually berating out here is can we put out another's distraction and I think at this point really and I've said this over and over again it gets me in trouble it's become white noise people say I can't believe you don't care more about this now that's just white noise it's just a buzz Caucasian noise you mean Caucasian pretty much you know it is I do think it's all just noise out there and I look at the other crises the big crises of the day one of them is straws apparently if people are using too many straws this is a big concern for people people are having sex with with rubber doll that's another one and I have to wonder is this the most decadent time in the history of the world does anybody have any actual problem it's pretty amazing I mean when they're saying that that mankind or as Trudeau would say people kind is going to be finished in in 50 years if we don't stop using plastic straws like are you really drumming up a problem in does anyone care that they are dismantling nuclear facilities in North Korea right now I mean are we really that ready I had I had a mentor of mine whose father-in-law passed away 20 years ago and when they were developing this new development in my hometown they were tearing up they were cutting down all these trees to build and he was so worried just wringing his hands he drive by said what's gonna happen when we don't have any more trees and my mentor told him one day he said well there will be enough wood to build a box to put you in it and put you in the ground and sure enough 25 years ago that's what happened and blesses our so everybody you know the sky is falling the sky is falling it's absolutely ridiculous and then KOMO comes out with this new tape and all that and it's such a you know nothing there's absolutely nothing there is nothing to it they were bored with it that's that's what I think it is I think all of this actually comes up because we're bored if we had real problems you wouldn't be worrying about the straws you know I had my priest Father Rutger come on the other day he said when the Barbarian invades there are no safe spaces you can't worry about these little tiny things anymore what is it have Americans grown soft I'm reminded of Teddy Roosevelt saying Americans are soft we need a war in some action struggle to make people serious again what is it as the country just going to soft you know if you go back to the idealism of say 1914 and right at the as the precursor to World War one everybody was looking in the mirror and saying to themselves over and over and every day in every way I'm getting better and they have this ideal at view of the world World War one hit and it was for devastating years and everyone was affected by especially Europe you know ten million men are dead in France and all of a sudden people come marching back for more and they see what real tragedy is like and I think we're living in a day where we don't understand what real tragedy is anymore we don't understand yes yes we see the things because the bad news is constantly paraded in front of us 24/7 and like you said it's it makes for quote good TV tragedy and bad things make for good TV but people haven't faced anything that has toughened us up so now you know you read a magazine a cover that says the rise of the beta male I mean are you kidding me this is what we're talking about this is what we're discussing you'll really arrive it's more like a more of a slouching of the beta male sort of like often I was into it ease into it you know yes yes yes slaves yes you know this reminds me Steven Pinker has this book out enlightenment now and he talks about this I saw him give a lecture on this in Orange County which is that everything materially is better diseases down war is down life expectancy is up infant mortality is down poverty is down starvation is down everything materially is getting better and people are getting more depressed they're loose they're getting more anxious they're getting more neurotic they're the suicide rate is going up if this doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to Steven Pinker or to other people who are atheists or materialists but it seems to me they're missing the cultural aspect so materially everything might be getting better we're getting cheap t-shirts from China and you know we get a movie pass and get to see movies for free and like all of that is great but in a cultural level there does seem to be some decay are you seeing that and do you think there is any way to to reverse that trend I I think people are disillusioned I think they're disengaged from reality and you know we we live within a world where the statistic one of the highest growing demographics in America today are people turning 100 I mean people are living longer they're doing but yet but yet you have an epidemic of opioid crisis and you have an epidemic of suicides amongst teenagers and these things because there is this sense of okla sness i always say yeah and i'll take all the heat for it i think that there has to be a return to a foundation of faith both faith in God faith in yourself faith in the people around you faith in the culture faith in the Constitution we could list these things out there there's a reason America has done what it's done the last 250 years even with the scars even with the things we've done wrong the things in our history that we need to mend heal in a race we still have done a lot of things right and we have to go back and have faith in that faith in the process and it's amazing to me people who want to come along and they want to say well the only reason Trump won is but those are the electoral college well that's the only reason any president in history everyone the presidency that that's the process and then you want to say well you know we're living in a day and age where you know we maybe we need to look at democratic socialism and that you know that's that's not an answer why are you going to change a process that's worked so well and go embrace something that historically has proven itself to be tragic just so you can now be different so I is there hope for it I think it's gonna take a massive amount a massive amount of of coming back in together to dialogue and discuss you know it and I've said this the old adage the example of a healthy bird has two healthy wings and it flies in a direction if you have one big wing on one side or the other it's just gonna fly in circles and not get anywhere but I think the tendency is everybody wants to interpret one another as being out on the tips of the wings we got to get back into the vitality of the bird if you will get right into where the heart beat in the end of in the body and the muscle and the moment moving the motion in the brain is and until people are willing to do that because you know I say it all the time I say we live in this world where we don't know each other anymore and we have a real world you don't walk into the average restaurant you know I'm in LA all the time I'm working on projects in LA I go to LA just like this cowboy hat on walking through WeHo and and people give me the look but I can walk in a restaurant we don't immediately start having a conversation or a debate about politics hi how are you good to see it we don't do that but yet we think we can go in at the end of the afternoon and we drive in our garage the door goes down we go in we pull out our device and we think we can debate politics with a stranger from seven states away and that be effective it's just not we've lost the concept of being neighbors and we don't know each other anymore and that's just a shame that's what's got to change that is so true this is actually why ironically I'm defending the you know owning the libs against some of the attacks on it is not because we need to be mean to our countrymen who see things wrongly but it's because comedy is a great tool comedy is the great tool to do this you know you do it you know you can either yell at people and be really angry or whatever but owning the libs is when you tell a joke owning the libs is when you smack down some stupid idea and it's funny that creates some absurdity it shows some incongruent and that's fun I'd much rather convince my fellow countrymen to come over to my point of view by laughing and having a little joy a little joy goes a long way and you're you're literally doing that I mean you are taking comedy and you're going to Portland and you're going to New Jersey how is one how's the tour going where can people find you and and do you think that the left which has been so humorless for a while is gonna get their sense of humor back I I think they're gonna have to you know we live in a day and age where a guy who's who's simple and ingenious as Jerry Seinfeld refuses to go on a college campus and do comedy anymore because he knows that everybody gets offended that's a shame but I the tours going great you can find dates at watched addcom and and people are packing these theaters it's really great all the way across the country and it's been a lot of fun to watch because I'm I am an equal opportunity offender if I see something worth making fun of I'm gonna make fun of it if whether it's you know making a joke about the worthlessness of Barack Obama giving a keynote speech at the NRA convention or you know the fact that Donald Trump is married to a supermodel because of his money you know I get the groans from that and I'm like but come on that woman never said Oh Donald I love your hair you know she been trying to rub her fingers through it in the hairsprays hold on her fingers you got to be able to poke fun at that stuff and laugh at it if you don't you're gonna wind up crying because I think that laughing is is a great you fire but you know the thing the thing is we've lost a culture of comedy because of this culture of offended 'no stand people can't you know it's comedy for comedy sake is okay i I even want to defend a lot of these things that we come out and we get on to people about say yeah but it's being done in the vein of comedy you know in let it go just let it go don't be so sensitive to it anymore so I tell people learn how to laugh I think it was Horace Walpole said life is a comedy to the man who thinks and a tragedies the man who feels but facts don't care about your feelings folks so lighten up and laugh Chad go to watch Chad calm check out the Chad Prather show I got to let you go you get back on the road and keep offending everybody out there in San Jose yeah well good to talk to you I have to have you back on you too see you soon Michael that's a good perspective that's that's like you know guys take yourself a little lightly every so often the reason surgeon said this the reason that angels can fly is because they can take themselves lightly if you're so heavy and weigh down all the time you're not going to have a good life and and this brings us to our crises all of the crises that we're in right now like the straw crisis this is if you can't laugh at the straw crisis what are you doing but they take it very seriously the left right now is banning plastic drinking straws right now in San Francisco they've banned plastic drinking straws in Santa Barbara not too far up from us I was just up there a couple weeks ago they've they've banned waiters at restaurants from giving out plastic drinking straws they're going to enforce this with a $1,000 fine or six months in jail so if you go to a restaurant in Santa Barbara you are given a plastic drinking straw that waiter can go to jail for six months and or get a thousand dollar fine and it compounds on itself it's not like that's the limit if you go with your family you sit down it's a table of four that guy gives you people straws in your water this guy could go to jail for two years if you have a party in there you know you you you have a party you invite your big family you know you get a let's say it's 40 people or something that guys doing 20 years in the clink because he gave out plastic drinking straws that is some crazy stuff now simultaneously it's no longer a felony in California to knowingly give somebody aids that's no longer a felony that's not a crime give somebody aids that's fine give them a plastic drinking straw so they can enjoy their drink like a civilized person you go to jail and you pay and you pay money in New York City New York has decriminalized public urination so you go to California you can give somebody aids go to New York City you can urinate in the middle of the street that's okay if you give somebody a plastic drinking straw that is the crime these are really backwards priorities here in California they just tried to pass a bill to decriminalize heroin to allow people to shoot up heroin in certain safe places but you can't have drinking straws this is a really backwards thing and it's a culture that's obviously turned upside down you know in the way this whole thing started by the way is because of a nine-year-old kid I kid you not a nine-year-old kid didn't like that people were using drinking straws he thought that was wasteful he had been indoctrinated into some environmentalist thing so he called some restaurants and made up this number he said we use 500 million straws a day in the United States maybe I don't know if that's true and now as a result there's this major anti straw movement it's this it's that urging the left to just invent crises to invent problems it has to do with their politics you know the way the Left views politics the way that rationalists view politics is they just see its problem after problem after problem and we just we always need a problem and you always need a solution that's all politics is conservatives tend to take a nicer view of politics a more broad view politics is a political tradition we're living through a political tradition we can rely on institutions we can rely on traditions to get us through our politics it's not the foremost thing in life but when you have to rationalize everything in politics like the left does and some elements of the right then all of a sudden it's every little problem and when things are going too well when when you know everything is tickety-boo to quote Indra Clavin then you have to make up problems like this problem of the drinking straws and you become very hysterical case in point is one senator Cory Booker do I have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube where can I get to a Cory Booker I get to Cory Booker okay good here it was Cory Booker the The Crying of Senator in the United States here is Cory Booker talking about the day sure of appointing Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court just what they should know to understand then in the moral moment there is no there is no neutral in a moment there's no bystanders you are either complicit in the evil you aren't either contributing to the wrong or you are fighting against there's a save from the Abraham preface in one of the Psalms it says they don't meet walk through the valley of the shadow of death we don't walk you through the valley of the shadow of death but that doesn't say though I sit in the valley of the shadow of death it doesn't fit I'm watching on the sidelines of evaluate it says I'm walking through the valley of the shadow of death it's just I am taking agency I make it through this crisis so I understand cory booker is really turning the hysteria up to 11 you know there's a line on the internet which is everybody I don't like his Hitler that's how people engage in Internet discourse cory booker sees your everybody I don't like his Hitler and he raises you and everybody I don't like his Satan he is turning it up to say you are evil and what what is the evil act if you are okay with a completely boring you know sort of Brooks Brothers tie-wearing judge who went to Yale Law School if you're if you're okay with that guy being a judge he's already a judge has been a judge for a long time if you're okay with him being a judge you're evil you're Satan you're evil and it's so it's so funny in the background of this video of Elizabeth Warren and a couple other 60 year old women white women standing there just like yeah preach aim yeah like not not a good look ladies doesn't doesn't really look great not you know I'm not feeling electricity going through here and Cory Booker look this is a very cynical move by Cory he's trying to position himself for 2020 and so he's turned up this emotion thing he he I remember in one of the hearings he said I cried tears of rage and is all this yelling and emotionalism he used to be a kind of normal guy by the way he used to be the guy who in 2012 was defending Mitt Romney he said old Mitt Romney's not that bad this was the guy when they were saying MIT Romney was the devil the last time the Democrats had a devil he said oh he's not that bad he's okay let's come on everybody take it down but Cory is now thinking that his only ticket to the White House in 2020 is if he becomes one of these screeching emotional hysterical people the shtick does not play well he's just not good at it other politicians are good at that Obama was pretty good about pulling on the heartstrings Cory Booker is not this is not his strength if he wants to have a prayer at the White House he's he's got to try something else this is not not gonna work that they have to create this crisis they've backed themselves into this corner where there is a crisis and everything has to turn it up turn it up turn it up to 11 but nobody really believes that nobody thinks that Brett Kavanaugh is the devil nobody thinks that appointing a judge to a court is that's the end of the you know that Satan's victory over his eternal victory over the world no nobody thinks that and and so it doesn't ring true I don't I don't really see this strategy working well for for Democrats in the future but they're gonna they're gonna have to do it the only person who's actually sort of pivoting and and doing it pretty wisely is Alexandria Ocasio Cortes we'll get to that a little bit later still a lot to get to the last important crisis is the sexbots sexbots are taking over the world they might turn us into an endangered species that's a new report out today that the Japanese might become any danger dre s because of the prevalence of sex robots there we'll talk about that we'll talk about the first test-tube baby born on this day in history in 1978 what that gets to and why alexandria Ocasio cortez made a brilliant media move in turning on turning on Ali's Stuckey or friend of the show we'll explain how that happened but you got to go to I'm sorry what do you want me to do go to daily wire.com we have a lot more to get to it's 10 bucks a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the under Clavin sure you get the Ben Shapiro show you have to ask questions and the mailbag get them in that will be tomorrow you blah blah blah blah blah you get this get you get them up by the way a pretty soon I don't know I haven't talked to the department that makes these tumblers yet we need to start including plastic straws in them I know that you can sip it you know but that's what it tastes good when you sip it we need to and maybe we'll put two plastic straws in them and see you go over get the it'll be like it'll be a meta leftist year's tumbler it itself will produce the leftist tears it will be a perpetual motion machine all that for your daily wiring membership go to daily wire comm we'll be right back with a lot more sexbots this is the last decadent crisis that we've got to deal with today before we get to the cultural aspect at the heart of all of this talk about a decadent crisis the big crisis plaguing mankind right now is that we created robots to have sex with and we're doing it too much that this is endangering the population of Japan always Japan you know those guys are always a little ahead of the curve aren't they they had VCRs or produce all this technology and now they're having sex with all of the technology that they've created so this is the the problem sex robots are now available to people they're not totally widely used yet but in Japan they've really taken a liking to them Japan has had a declining population for a long time now they're below replacement rate and for the first time in history now for the first time in recent history they're their birth rate is below the million mark the and it's below replacement so what's happening is in Japan men prefer to have sex with silicon devices rather than with their wives we've heard this for years two men public opinion poll showed that men would prefer to look at pornography than to go out and be with an actual woman and this makes perfect sense it actually does make perfect sense because when you're with a woman she's a person you know she has desires demands rights things you know you've got to kind of you know unless you're a total psychopath you've got to kind of do how do you feel do you like this okay I don't know you know you got to buy them dinner you don't have to buy a robot dinner and it's this utter narcissus I mean is this utter egotism and selfishness - one - just take pornography over a woman but then certainly this robot I mean it is a really perverse thing and we can joke about it it's a ridiculous news story but it is a real fear because if men can just have sex with robots a good number of them are going to do it you know the robots okay they're they're a little more flexible I mean you know the list of potential advantages goes on and on and on but it's a real worry it brings up bioethical concerns not a joke I mean they're people say the libertarian point of view is oh let people do whatever they want let people come on just freedom just let people do whatever they want that isn't freedom and I don't think conservatives should advocate that kind of freedom conservatives from the time of Edmund Burke certainly onward have advocated ordered liberty that word ordered is important not liberty nism not just like sex drugs and rock and roll but liberal a true liberty and you and you know Christ says the man who sends us a slave to sin and there's this connection between sin and vice and your freedom if you are caught if you're addicted to some substance then you're not really free are you because that appetite is controlling you the reason that you have a classical education is to instead to instill virtues in you and to practice the virtues and to be able to not become a slave to sins like this and that's the case with these sex robots that it's it's just another addiction it's like heroin it's like meth pornography as an addiction it's booze whatever whatever pick your poison those are addictions and if you're addicted to something then you're not really free oh I don't know if there will be some law passed against this I don't know it probably will require a lot more than a law probably will require an education and a moral education but right now in the West around the world immoral or moral senses really decayed it's really rotted and the right is a little bit guilty of this too when we buy into that ridiculous libertarian notion of oh you know man whatever if it doesn't hurt anyone else just do it no that's not how you have a good society John Adams said that the United States is only built for a moral and religious people you can't have Liberty if you're not going to govern yourself someone will instill order either you can order yourself and discipline yourself and carry yourself like an adult or the government's going to do it for you but order will be preserved we will not have chaos Society will not tolerate that so a little word of warning as I know I know what you're thinking out there you you behind that computer screen you demographically speaking most likely young male viewer of this program you are thinking on a sex robot that doesn't sound so bad Oh I wonder if they could do oh they can't do that thing over there were some real pitfalls here it's a real a real worry and and we've had bioethical concerns like this before that we haven't dealt with very seriously and and you know it's in those small things that the rock begins this brings us to this day in history because on this day in history in 1978 the first test-tube baby was conceived this is what it was the baby's name Louise joy brown first baby conceived artificially and people all wonder they said is this okay is this ethical what do we do I will there be problems will there be birth defects will they be sterile whatever now in vitro fertilization exists all over the place this is a mainstream procedure people don't seem to have much of a problem with it the Catholic Church still frowns on it the Catholic Church still prohibits it but a lot of even other Protestant organizations they say it's okay and we haven't dealt with the ethical implications of this I mean infertility is a multi-billion dollar industry just the business of egg donations is a multi-billion dollar industry to say nothing of all of the other procedures and look at the procedure itself IVF is very expensive it's can cost twenty five thousand dollars to create a child through this process and there are some problems that come along with it you know there's twice the rate of birth defects according to one study that was published in the New England Medical Journal and but then there's the the question of pro-life because so frequently IVF involves the destruction of embryos of little babies that have been conceived and the pro-life movement doesn't talk about it a whole lot but they should there was a wopo piece about this and they said how come the pro-lifers don't talk about in vitro fertilization when you do in-vitro fertilization because it's so expensive usually they'll fertilize four to eight eggs and so you'll you'll conceive four to eight little babies and you'll freeze some of them and then you'll implant the other so if you implant let's say you implant four in the womb then you see which ones take some of them statistically speaking won't take and they'll be destroyed and then if they all take what frequently happens is selective abortion so then the parents will say oh no well we don't want four so let's kill off three of them and oh let's do it by okay we don't want them to have that disease okay cuz you've been screened for these things now we don't want it to be that gender we don't want to write we don't want you you can make a design or baby we're much further along to that as possible so much further along to that than we'd like to admit to ourselves so you've got this situation where we're protesting against Planned Parenthood because they're killing babies in the womb but we're not concerned about this process IVF because it's so nice we only see the nice stories on the news Oh a couple that couldn't conceive now they can conceive a child and isn't that nice I know people who were test-tube babies you think I like my friend so I I think this process should be allowed to continue but there is a cost to this I mean you are conceiving children and killing them or donating them to medical research or locking them in a way in a freezer forever and if you really believe that life begins at conception if you believe that some insolvent happens at that point then you're freezing them away forever that is a pretty horrific thing yeah but we don't think through these easily enough we only think about the nice aspect or the frivolous aspect or the glib aspect oh you know oh it's a sex robot who cares well let the guy let the guys in Japan have fun there are implications there were unintended consequences about this and when you have a moral regime that is so insane if you've got a moral structure that basically today in the West is if it feels good do it then you're not going to be able to think through those things and you could have it could have really disastrous effects all of the futurists that we talked to all of these you know public intellectuals who come out and they say I'm terrified about AI I'm terrified about the extinction of the human species I'm terrified about this I'm terrified about that perhaps we should start taking that seriously because otherwise we're going to end up in a position where you've you've got people blathering like Cory Booker you know about evil and the evil and the evil but we don't see the evil right in front of our face which is usually the case alright enough about IVF I know I've got to go very soon before I go I've got I want to end on a happy note which is the mainstream media meltdown over Ali Stuckey's video making fun of Alexandria Ocasio Cortes so the mainstream media went bomb with this alley Stuckey we played the video yesterday she did this obvious satire video of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's stupid interview with Margaret Hoover you could tell it obviously was satire was on a different set she was very different clothing than the woman in the video the the other video the first video had gone completely viral everybody had already seen that but what the mainstream media did is instead of saying okay you know this parody whatever we liked it or we didn't like it or what what have you they decided to call it fake news they played dumb they were obtuse they said this wasn't satire this was a fake in tribute designed to deceive people so the Washington Post ran the headline they said after a fake interview of Alexandria Cassio Cortez went viral its maker said it was satire what they said was satire in the first place she when they posted it there was a little winky emoji the intercept another website said fake interview with Alexandria Cassio Cortez was satire not hoax conservative pundit says as though you know this is a big conspiracy as though Allie Stuckey you know is was trying to deceive people which obviously isn't the case the Washington Times said Alexandria Cassio Cortes calls out Allie Stuckey for parody interview and it's true aquezio Cortez is calling her out for it you know The Verge a million Facebook users watched a video that blurs the line between bad satire and fake news no it was just funny satire doesn't blur any line it wasn't bad with it's just wasn't fake news and then ago the rap gets even better they say see our TV host of doctored Ocasio Cortez video doubles down of doctored what doctored video it was satire and then ocasion Cortez comes with her punch and she landed it this was a good punch she said Republicans are so scared of me that they're faking videos and presenting them as real on Facebook because they can't deal with reality anymore here's one bonafide truth election day is November 6th which I don't actually don't know if that's true this year we should look that up that'd be I would not put it past okay SEO Cortes to get the election day wrong in that but okay okay honey all right okay zo Cortez I'm we're not if we're of you here's my proof of that you are welcome on my show anytime please come on my show it'll be live or live to tape we won't we won't dr. anything we can just have a frank conversation you and me we come from very similar backgrounds both poor you know grew up in poor neighborhoods in New York and we were little babies and then before elementary school move to the suburbs we grew up one town away from one another Yorktown Heights and Bedford Hills went to adjacent high schools we have such a similar background it'll be a fair fight just come on just do it I mean the difference is you lied about your upbringing and I didn't lie about mine but just come on I won't be afraid you won't be afraid of me I won't be afraid of you will we'll have a discussion about democratic socialism come on the show do it Alexandria we'll put it all behind us of course you won't do that she won't come on the show she saw this opportunity and so did the mainstream media to vindicate herself on that Margaret Hoover program so what happened is she went on the Margaret Hoover show and she looked so foolish she didn't know anything she didn't know the answer to basic questions she appeared to get glib and giddy and utterly ignorant proudly ignorant and she said they murder Hoover asked her a basic question about Israel and she said oh well I'm not the expert on geopolitics hee hee hee even though she has a degree in international relations from a private university that cost a quarter million dollars to attend she looked so stupid it could have destroyed her candidacy it made Democrats look like idiots and then the media and the Democrats seized on this opportunity when Allie Stuckey made a pretty funny satire video they said what we can do now is pretend that the satire video is real is a real attempt at fake news and then when people call Ocasio Cortez an idiot will blame it on Allie Stuckey will blame it on CR TV will say no no the Republicans just made her look like an idiot the Conservatives just made her look like an it no no she did she did it all herself she did it just fine but I gotta hand it to the Democrats this was a very slick political move there they're blurring the two they're saying oh forget the more wood Hoover thing forget about that we're talking about the ally Stuckey video they did it it was nefarious don't go back and watch the original tape she looks great on the original tape but in that one they made her look stupid really brilliant good opportunity I can't can't knock him for it I would have done the same thing if I were running a totally ignorant and and radical and extreme candidate like Alexandria Cassio Cortez of course I wouldn't do that because I'm a conservative but well done they took their dirty trick well we'll see how it plays I think they landed it Alexandria if you want if you're really earnest about this if you're earnest about not being afraid going just speaking very frankly come on the program please hashtag hashtag don't be afraid I don't know get some get some campaign going I really I really would love to speak with her we can talk about we can talk about democratic socialism but I bet you won't do it okay that's our show get your mailbag questions in for tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is
