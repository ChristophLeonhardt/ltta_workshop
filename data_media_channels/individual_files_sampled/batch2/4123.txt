but I noticed over the last few months that he's kind of used sport to kind of divide us and that's something that I can't relate to force has never been something that divide people has always been something that brings someone together if you thought the president could resist responding you would be wrong here it is if you missed it quote LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television Don Lemon he made LeBron look smart which isn't easy to do I like Mike which seemed to be a reference to Michael Jordan and this ongoing debate over which player is actually the greatest of all time so again it's this issue of the president Fanning the flames of what is seen as a cultural war by some join me now New York Times culture reporter soap and EV and Republican political consultants sure Michael singleton thank you both for being on soap so this is like the Nexus of everything you love right basketball politics culture it all comes together in this and I'm curious what you have seen in the reaction from for example NBA players athletes people and sort of the broader community sphere to this where you could call back and forth between the president and LeBron well there are a couple interesting things here the first of which is that the NBA is by far out of all the professional sports the most socially active sport and that goes back decades Bill Russell you know March with Martin Luther King and he was the first black coach in American sports so you know activism didn't start with LeBron it goes back in many many years but especially now NBA players are encouraged to be socially active they are they are very big if you member after Trayvon Martin the Miami Heat players came out wearing hoodies so it's no surprise that when Donald Trump went after LeBron James several NBA players include karl-anthony towns Donovan Mitchell all stepped up in defense of LeBron James but you know the thing is if you notice after Trump sent out his tweet LeBron James never said anything about it I think the truth is LeBron James doesn't need a nap is LeBron James does not need anyone to defend him you know he he's doing quite fine and the but it's a it's a difference in leagues right in the NFL the players you know they come out and they're activists and they're you know essentially punished for it in a way I like to look at Colin Kaepernick but in the NBA it's it's very much encouraged so it wasn't surprised to see so many NBA players - defend LeBron James that's interesting it's so pain you're right LeBron didn't respond to the president and said he just tweeted about his school right he showed pictures of that school he's been working on this school that Melania Trump spokesperson has talked about he didn't throw elbows sure Michael he gave a cold shoulder ignoring the president's insults when you look though at the way that the president used to talk about LeBron he used to be different years ago he tweeted about what a great guy he was great players and LeBrons time is now that was then that was before the 2016 campaign right when LeBron came out in back Tillery Clinton do you think that for the president's base his supporters LeBron's high road here is going to have an impact it's gonna make any difference to the way that they view this interaction no III don't think so I mean there's a reason the president continues to go back to these cultural and racial issues for a reason because there is a significant portion of our country where this does resonate with those particular individuals you know I think as it relates to race as it relates to culture I mean there are a lot of issues in our country that we have to use this analogy we've merely sort of swept them under the rug we know they still exist there you don't have to necessarily look at them or deal with it all the time and here comes Trump he lifts the rug off of the floor what happens it spreads like wildfire and so I think it's it's really unfortunate because when you elect a leader you have the expectation that the leaders are going to lead all of the people not just to individuals who voted for him and unfortunately the president just isn't doing that we hit good I was gonna say one thing I want to add here is that this isn't about LeBron James intelligence remember whenever you hear something like shut up and dribble from Laura Ingraham a couple months ago or you know LeBron James would still stick to basketball it's not actually that you know people want them to stick their lanes it's about disagreement you know if LeBron James came out and said you know Donald Trump's the greatest pressure in the world you wouldn't hear things like you know they should stick to basketball you know last year during the campaign Donald Trump you sent out the endorsement of Mike Tyson you know he had Don King out there with them Johnny Damon Paul O'Neill were at Trump events you know NASCAR folks you know Jack Nicklaus I think endorsed Trump and I think Trump touted that so it's not you know Donald Trump doesn't have a problem with athlete activism provided it is on his behalf well if I could just push back against that I mean there are a lot of other individuals who are not minorities who are not African Americans you've said very negative things about President Trump ie mm he said nothing disparaging about those individuals when you talk about intellect that's something that goes all the way back to the early 1930s 40s where races individuals would attack the intellectual faculties of african-americans are saying we are less than so I just don't buy that argument okay sure Michael single taupe and Deb thank you for this conversation Thanks we're gonna keep talking about especially by the way is NFL season kicks into high gear here in the next few weeks thanks for being on guys thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
