00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:02,989
HIMSELF AT THE OUTSET OF

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:04,490
THIS HEARING TODAY HE LOOKED

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:04,857
UNHINGED.

4
00:00:04,857 --> 00:00:06,859
>> HE LOOK PASSIONATE AND

5
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:07,260
UNSCRIPTED.

6
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,794
>> HERE TO REACT TO

7
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:09,495
YESTERDAY'S MEETINGS SOCIAL

MEDIA SUPER STARS AND DONALD

TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIAMOND AND

10
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,267
SILK.

11
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,635
SO, LADIES, WELCOME BACK.

12
00:00:15,635 --> 00:00:18,704
YOU SAW A PANEL OF PEOPLE

13
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:19,839
LIKE MINDED PEOPLE SAYING

14
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,807
HOW UNHINGED BRETT KAVANAUGH

15
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:22,308
WAS.

16
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:23,309
MAN, WAS HE DIFFERENT THAN

17
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,044
HE WAS WITH MARTHA

18
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:25,411
MACCALLUM.

19
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,846
DID HE HELP HIMSELF?

20
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:28,881
>> HE HELPED HIMSELF BECAUSE

21
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:30,049
HE SPOKE FROM THE HEART.

22
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:30,549
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

23
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,585
>> HE DREW US ALL IN AND HAD

24
00:00:32,585 --> 00:00:34,620
US ALL CRYING.

25
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,455
WE FELT EVERYTHING THAT HE

26
00:00:36,455 --> 00:00:37,924
FELT AND I BELIEVE THAT HE

27
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:39,458
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED.

28
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,660
I BELIEVE HIM.

29
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,362
AND WE STAND WITH BRETT

30
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:43,729
KAVANAUGH.

31
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:45,598
THAT'S WHO WE STAND WITH.

32
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:46,432
STEVE: LADIES, WHAT ABOUT

33
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:47,166
DR. CHRISTINE FORD?

34
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,701
BECAUSE SHE WAS FIRST UP AND

35
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:50,436
SHE TESTIFIED YESTERDAY SHE

36
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:51,304
READ HER STATEMENT.

37
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:52,638
IT WAS HEART-FELT.

38
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,040
AND THEN SHE WAS ASKED A LOT

39
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,374
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

40
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:55,741
HAPPENED.

41
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:57,410
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY REAL NEW

42
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,578
DETAILS AND, IN FACT, THE

43
00:00:58,578 --> 00:01:00,846
FOUR PEOPLE SHE QUOTED HAVE

44
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:01,881
IN SWORN TESTIMONY DENIED

45
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,683
THAT IT HAPPENED.

46
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:05,117
HER BEST FRIEND DENIED THAT

47
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:06,819
SHE HAD EVEN MET BRETT

48
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:08,087
KAVANAUGH AND MS. FORD HAD

49
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,722
SAID THAT SHE WAS THERE THAT

50
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:10,022
NIGHT.

51
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:12,792
WHAT ABOUT HER TESTIMONY

52
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:13,192
THOUGH?

53
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:16,529
>> HER TESTIMONY MAY HAVE

54
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,231
BEEN HEART-FELT, THERE WERE

55
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,332
TOO MANY HOLES IN HER STORY

56
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,467
AND HER STORY WAS FALLING

57
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:21,768
APART.

58
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:23,002
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T CRY WITH

59
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:23,269
HER.

60
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:23,970
I CRIED WITH HIM.

61
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,306
I FELT HIS PAIN.

62
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:27,473
I DIDN'T FEEL ANY EMOTION

63
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:28,374
FROM HER BECAUSE SHE

64
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,609
COULDN'T KEEP HERSELF

65
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:29,976
TOGETHER.

66
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:30,476
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

67
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:31,711
>> PAPERS WAS ALL OVER THE

68
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,011
PLACE.

69
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:33,379
SHE HAD HER LAWYERS

70
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,914
DICTATING WHAT SHE SHOULD

71
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:36,382
SAY, WHAT SHE SHOULDN'T SAY.

72
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:37,784
I LOOK AT ALL OF THAT I PAID

73
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:38,618
ATTENTION TO ALL OF THAT.

74
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:38,952
>> YEAH.

75
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:40,553
>> SHE DIDN'T DRAW ME IN.

76
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:42,088
HE DREW US ALL IN AND WE

77
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:43,623
BELIEVE HIM.

78
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:44,557
STEVE: LADIES, IT SEEMS LIKE

79
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,892
SHE BELIEVES THAT BRETT

80
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,327
KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER BACK

81
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:47,760
IN 1982.

82
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,728
>> OKAY.

83
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:49,996
BUT, LISTEN, I BELIEVE THAT

84
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:51,798
SHE WAS ABUSED AND LOOKING

85
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:52,932
AT HER FROM YESTERDAY,

86
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,834
LOOKING AT HER DEMEANOR AND

87
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:55,802
DISPOSITION, I BELIEVE SHE

88
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:58,404
WAS ABUSED PROBABLY EARLIER

89
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:59,806
THAN 15 YEARS OLD.

90
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:01,407
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

91
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:01,975
BRETT KAVANAUGH DID.

92
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:02,375
THIS.

93
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,009
>> RIGHT.

94
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,111
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND

95
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,846
SHAME ON THE DEMOCRATS FOR

96
00:02:06,846 --> 00:02:08,314
EXPLOITING HER AND

97
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:09,115
EXPLOITING HER STORY.

98
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:10,517
AND IF THEY REALLY CARED

99
00:02:10,517 --> 00:02:11,918
ABOUT DR. FORD, WHY DIDN'T

100
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:13,253
THEY GO TO THE POLICE?

101
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:14,421
WHY DIDN'T THEY GO TO THE

102
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:14,688
FBI?

103
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:15,322
>> EXACTLY.

104
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,756
>> THE ONE THING THAT I NEED

105
00:02:16,756 --> 00:02:18,525
TO SAY TO ALL AMERICANS,

106
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:19,726
YESTERDAY IT WAS KAVANAUGH.

107
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:20,660
TODAY IT COULD BE YOUR

108
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,696
BROTHER, YOUR SON, YOUR

109
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:24,030
FATHER OR YOUR HUSBAND.

110
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,434
SO VOTE RIGHT SO YOU WON'T

111
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:27,801
GET LEFT.

112
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:28,868
VOTE REPUBLICAN BECAUSE THE

113
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,237
CIRCUS AND THE CHARADES THAT

114
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,838
THE DEMOCRATS JUST PULLED, I

115
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,607
DON'T EVER WANT TO VOTE FOR

116
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:34,608
ANOTHER DEMOCRAT.

117
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,109
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

118
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:36,843
AINSLEY: IT'S AN INTERESTING

119
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,112
TIME BECAUSE IT'S THE ME TOO

120
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:39,980
MOVEMENT AND IF YOU ARE A

121
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,481
MAN AND ACCUSED A LOT OF

122
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:42,816
PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME

123
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,884
YOU ARE GUILTY UNLESS YOU

124
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:45,952
CAN PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE

125
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:46,586
WHICH IS AGAINST WHAT THE

126
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:47,287
LAW SAYS.

127
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,388
AS A WOMAN, WHAT DO YOU

128
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:51,458
THINK IS REALLY HAPPENING

129
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:51,758
THEN?

130
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,293
I WATCHED HER TESTIMONY AND

131
00:02:53,293 --> 00:02:54,728
THOUGHT GOSH, THIS IS REALLY

132
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:55,128
BELIEVABLE.

133
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,163
WE ALL KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN

134
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,831
THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN

135
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:58,999
SITUATIONS AND DAMAGED THEM

136
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:03,003
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

137
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,037
SO, VERY BELIEVABLE BUT THEN

138
00:03:04,037 --> 00:03:05,572
YOU HEARD FROM HIM AND YOU

139
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:06,640
SAW HOW UPSET HE WAS.

140
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,308
AND IT WAS VERY BELIEVABLE,

141
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:08,575
TOO.

142
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:09,376
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

143
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:10,143
TRUTH IS?

144
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:11,078
WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS

145
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:11,445
HAPPENING?

146
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:13,247
>> WELL, THE TRUTH -- FIRST

147
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:15,382
OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO HAVE

148
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:15,749
EVIDENCE.

149
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:16,883
KAVANAUGH HAD THINGS TO

150
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:17,317
SUBSTANTIATE.

151
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:19,052
HE KEPT CALENDARS.

152
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,988
I WAS JUST SO TAKEN ABACK BY

153
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:22,456
THAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP HER

154
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:22,923
STORY TOGETHER.

155
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:23,490
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

156
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,392
>> SHE HAS NO PROOF.

157
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,794
ACCUSATIONS, ALLEGATIONS

158
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:27,761
WITHOUT ACCURATE INFORMATION

159
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,697
IS MERELY SPECULATION.

160
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:30,931
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

161
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:31,999
AINSLEY: DO YOU THINK SHE IS

162
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:32,299
LYING?

163
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,500
ARE YOU SAYING SHE LIED?

164
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,202
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHE

165
00:03:35,202 --> 00:03:35,502
LIED.

166
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,804
I'M NOT SAYING THAT SHE

167
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:37,137
LIED.

168
00:03:37,137 --> 00:03:38,572
I BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS

169
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,507
ABUSED SOMEWHERE BUT IT WAS

170
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:41,475
NOT BY BRETT KAVANAUGH.

171
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:41,975
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

172
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,143
>> IT WAS NOT BY HIM.

173
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,478
>> YESTERDAY, HIS FATHER,

174
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,547
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S FATHER

175
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:48,415
SAVED HIS LIFE AND IT WAS SO

176
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:50,751
GOOD TO FINALLY SEE

177
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,119
REPUBLICANS SAYING AND BAN

178
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,721
AND NOT FALL AND GO COLD.

179
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,523
IT WAS FINALLY GOOD TO SEE

180
00:03:55,523 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS CALL OUT THE
