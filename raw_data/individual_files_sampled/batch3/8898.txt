SOME UNDECIDED. AFTER THIS DEBATE WE'LL SEE. Bill: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON THE ROAD FOR THE MID-TERMS. HE IS ACCUMULATING A MASSIVE WAR CHEST FOR 2020 ALREADY RAISING $100 MILLION. JOSH HOLMES ON THE A-TEAM. MATT BENNETT AND BRIAN BRENBERG. GENTLEMEN, NICE TO SEE YOU ALL. ARIZONA, NEVADA, MONTANA AT THE END OF THE WEEK. $100 MILLION IN A WAR CHEST. SOMEONE IS BOOKING DOWN THE ROAD, HUH? ORDINARILY A PRESIDENT WOULD RAISE HEAT WHILE RAISING $100 MILLION. THERE IS NO PRT IN MODERN HISTORY WHO HAS DONE MORE IN A MID-TERM IN TERMS OF DOWN TICKET AND HOUSE REPUBLICANS BUT THE POLITICAL TRAVEL. AS YOU SAID HE IS EVERYWHERE. Bill: ALWAYS ON THE ROAD. ALWAYS ON THE ROAD. TONS OF ENERGY AND EVERYBODY WANTS HIM. Sandra: IS THAT A GOOD THING. DOES IT SCARE DEMOCRATS? I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JOSH, HE HAS DONE A LOT FOR DOWN BALLOT CANDIDATES, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. WHEN HE GOES ON THE ROAD HE HELPS US AND WE LOVE TO SEE IT. Sandra: HOW SO? LOOK, HE IS UNBELIEVABLY UNPOPULAR, AS MANY MID-TERM PRESIDENTS ARE. THE HOUSE IS VERY LIKELY TO FLIP BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT IS STRUGGLING SO BADLY IN THE MIDWEST AND NORTHEAST AND CALIFORNIA AND LOTS OF PLACES. WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE SENATE RACE IN TEXAS. MUCH OF THAT IS THE FACT THAT HE RAISED $100 MILLION BECAUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE HANDED IT TO HIM WITH THE HYSTERIA WE'VE SEEN. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR THIS. PEOPLE LOOK AT THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND SEE THE KINDS OF THINGS BEING SAID, THE KAVANAUGH DEBACLE AND SAY WHO CAN WE GIVE MONEY TO HELP REACH OUR INTERESTS? GIVE IT TO THE PRESIDENT. THE REALITY IS YOU GET SOME STATES OFF THE CYCLE WITH NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA, WEST VIRGINIA, ARIZONA, THESE ARE ALL PLACES THE PRESIDENT IS DOING JUST FINE. THERE IS CONCENTRATION OF SUBURBAN AREAS THAT DEMOCRATS AND MATT ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHERE THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATING IS NOT WHERE REPUBLICANS WOULD WANT. WHAT MATTERS IN 2018 IS WHERE REPUBLICANS WANT IT AND LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. LET'S KEEP IN MIND $100 MILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY. BETA O'ROURKE IN ONE MONTH RAISED $31 MILLION. Bill: WE'LL GET TO THAT. DOESN'T WANT TO SHARE IT, EITHER. ELIZABETH WARREN MADE A LOT OF WAVES YESTERDAY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS STORY GOES. I THINK IT WENT IN WAYS THAT EVEN SHE DID NOT EXPECT. HERE IS THE TWEET FROM THE PRESIDENT. NOW THAT HER CLAIMS OF INDIAN HERITAGE TURNED OUT TO BE A SCAM AND LIE ELIZABETH WARREN SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR PERPETUATING THE FRAUD AGAINST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. HARVARD CALLED HER A PERSON OF COLOR, AMAZING CON AND WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN HER OTHERWISE. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS DOES TO HER CHANCES IN 2020? DID IT CLOUD IT MORE THAN SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD CLARIFY? THE BEST THING FOR HER IS LET THE ISSUE DIE. INSTEAD SHE LIFTS IT UP AND GIVES IT NEW LIFE. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT. Sandra: SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING. THIS IS NOT THE TOPIC YOU WANT TO DO IT. Sandra: HER NAME IS UP IN THE FIELD WITH 2020. THE FIELD, JOE BIDEN IS UP 33%, BERNIE SANDERS 13%, KAMALA HARRIS AND ELIZABETH WARREN GETTING 8% ON THAT PARTICULAR POLL. SO SHE SEES HER CHANCES INCREASING. PERHAPS SHE FELT SHE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING. THE PRESIDENT WOUND WOULDN'T LET IT DROP. HE HAS A NICKNAME THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS FOR HER AND SHE WANTED TO CALL HIS BLUFF. SHE HAS SAID PRETTY CLEARLY THAT SHE IS NOT DOESN'T HAVE A DIRECT AND CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO NATIVE AMERICAN BLOOD BUT SHE SHOWED Sandra: SHE OFFENDED THE TRIBE AND THEY'VE RESPONDED SAYING THEY DID NOT LIKE HER HANDLING OF THIS DNA TEST. FULLY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO DO THAT. SHE WAS RESPONDING NOT TO THEM BUT TO TRUMP. Bill: TRUMP SMOKES YOU OUT OF YOUR HOLE. ABSOLUTELY. THE FUN LITTLE BEHIND THE SCENES STORY IS THAT DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020 ARE IN THIS BATTLE WITH THEMSELVES TO SEE WHO CAN MAKE A BIGGER FOOL OUT OF THEIR HANDS. WARREN TOOK THE BATTLE FROM SPARTACUS. THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING. IT IS A BIG FIELD AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE. THE REASON THEY'RE DOING THESE THINGS THAT ARE COMPLETELY FOOLISH IS THEY'RE TRYING TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES. Bill: WE AGREE STHE IS RUNNING. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS HAVE A LOT OF YOU'RE 22 DAYS AS OF YESTERDAY FROM THE MID-TERM ELECTION. YOU CHANNEL THE ENERGY IN THE DIRECTION IN THAT WAY. I THINK JOE BIDEN IS RUNNING. Sandra: DO YOU THINK? Bill: YEAH. WHAT KIND OF CANDIDATE DOES HE MAKE 75, 76? RELATIVE TO THE FIELD WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW HE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE THE SANE CANDIDATE. HE LOOKS LIKE THE SAFE CANDIDATE. THE CANDIDATE THAT'S CARING FOR THE BEST OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HISTORICALLY. THAT'S ODD FOR ME TO SAY. BUT IN THIS FIELD WHICH IS GOING TO TEAR ITSELF APART, BY THE WAY, ALL THE WAY TO THE CONVENTION, I THINK BIDEN WILL LOOK LIKE A STEADY HAND. THERE ARE DISQUALIFYING HIMSELF FOR THE NOMINATION. SURE, THE WELL OF BIDEN IS AS DEEP AS IT IS FOR ANY CANDIDATES. PEOPLE LOVE HIM. HE WILL HAVE TO PROVE THAT HE SHOULD BE THE ONE. THERE IS A BIG FIELD, AS YOU SAY. HE WILL HAVE TO COMPETE FOR IT FOR A YEAR IF HE RUNS AND PROVE THAT HE SHOULD BE OUR NOMINEE. Bill: WE'LL SEE HIM ON MONDAY IN NEVADA IN A CLOSE ELECTION. TRUMP HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL TO OUR CANDIDATES AS WELL.
