there were some very interesting films in 2017 from huge box of successes like the last Jedi and beating the beasts to groundbreaking achievements in cinematography for movies like Blade Runner 2049 and Dunkirk the Oscar nominations for 2017 are out but I want to mention a film that may have taken home a prize if there were a category for a religious film and that is the case for Christ and is the true story of how Lee Strobel an award-winning journalist and reporter set out to disprove the resurrection of Jesus Christ I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood the case for Christ was released April 7 2017 and grossed just over 17 million dollars worldwide the budget for this film was not released but if you sit down and watch it you will notice right off the bat the quality which also means money and I would guess it's probably around 15 to 17 million dollars as it's now as far as box-office goes the case for Christ lanes at 21st all-time for Christian films beating out a movie I was just in a couple years ago called I'm not a shame which was also released by pure flix shout out to all you guys but was beat up by two of my favorite films have been a part of war room and courageous that sit at 14th and 6th and then are all still trying to catch the granddaddy of them all The Passion of the Christ that grows 600 million dollars worldwide might take a while I have to say off the bat I do not want a separate category for religious films I think that's just stupid plain saying oh this is the best movie with a female lead like some category when it should just be about the story the characters the narrative and how well you told the story however you cannot ignore the very clear bias that many critics have towards Christian films themselves I mean you think they were great in these things with disdain like they do for most DC superhero movies now before I begin obviously I'm a Christian and this is a Christian movie and I will try to be objective as possible but I know I have biases but I want to encourage people to watch this movie even if you're not a Christian and please watch it alongside a movie that's been the box office buzz of the year three billboards outside Epping Missouri just watch these two movies both as is try to ignore the fact that one is a Christian movie and one is a clear example of leftist propaganda and just tell me which movie you liked the best and in one hand you have an Oscar buzz movie everyone's talking about and one movie you probably never heard about why is that alright so I've already talked way too much let's just dive into this please before I go ahead spoiler alert now for my viewer review I'm gonna give this movie a four out of five I don't want to reiterate this fact despite the fact that I've been in a lot of faith-based movies this is not a genre i watch like literally this is bottom of my list of things that I did go out to see however this film is wonderful their relationship is very interesting but I always like the detective stories anyway you always want to get to the bottom of what's going on and let's go like a really cool Law & Order episode getting to see this guy struggle into this but what's great is it is so unforced you can see a very real and awesome relationship between these two people and a guy that has a clear and wonderful path in this journalism career that he has hitting a massive crossroads now I think it is very interesting and refreshing for the skeptic community as whole because Lee obviously starts out as the devout atheist he's gonna try to disprove the resurrection of Christ he doesn't dive into it out of an area of just disdain and disgust for these people he wants to prove them wrong no it's out of a real place of love and curiosity he wants to save his marriage and that's what sets him on this path to disprove the resurrection of Jesus and because it is so not heavy hand and all the characters a believable the situation's are in and you'll like everyone on screen you cannot help but be overwhelmed the story in the process of selling it the performances are also great Mike Vogel plays Lee Strobel and he is very charismatic entertaining to watch the entire time they're so a great emotional roller coaster that goes on in this movie erika christensen also does a terrific job playing the wife of lee and my personal favorite is a supporting actor who i wish could have been nominated in some small category mike pinnace kia probably mispronounced his name who plays lee's co-worker kenny london now obviously the movie is not perfect there's some things I think they could have done a little bit better you can always hope a movie gets a little tighter and there's no air in it at all there's a few scenes that drag specially towards the end there's one specific scene and it's tough to recover from a dragging scene at the end because you want to finish on a crescendo and you've already done this much so much work it was seen drags in the beginning kind of make up for it but at the end there's a few unnecessary flashbacks I believe but as a whole it's still a wonderful movie you'll laugh you'll cry will be intrigued to be on the edge of your seat in a few places it's great really well done movie and for my critic review only give it a three out of five now particularly in narrative driven stories the characters and the performances are key to move the process forward to move the plot forward but the score is always so important when it's just two people talking to really engage the audience help you feel and just create power and presence and every scene and the score by will muster is awesome it's absolutely phenomenal he watch the movie the shot selection by John was also very well done as well as having something just a conversation piece when it's two people trying to give exposition information about the resurrection of Christ it gets very boring but it a good job of pacing the characters around the room creating interesting shots and also cutting together with a beef story that's pretty interesting as well the movie itself has all the necessary beats we love the catalyst the loss of hope the no turning back they're just great moments and then strung out throughout as well as relations that you enjoy the romance it has everything you'd want in a good well done movie my faith in values we give this movie a 5 out of 5 but Jude see that going now what I think is wonderful about this film is the antagonist it's not man versus man it's not a guy versus some angry professor trying to kill him in all of his beliefs it's a man struggling with himself his own the Bible says we don't struggle with flesh and blood we struggle with principalities and outside forces and in this movie you see a man struggling with these ideas and using his gifts as a journalist and a reporter to dig into the genesis of Jesus and why as a religious figure he sets himself apart from all others in the movie doesn't get into theology and spirituality because there's so many movies that do that better anyway but this movie did fantastic job of his staying in his Lane it didn't bite off more than can chew even from a religious standpoint and one of the reasons I think it's such a great meeting ground between people that are agnostic or atheist or just my favorite conversations honestly to have when everyone respects each other and can find some common ground is you see a guy in both positions you get to see guy on both spectrums and you get to see the process in between but you can have that conversation through and this is done through following facts and truth now obvious the most important element of faith even in Christianity is going to be faith and it talked about this a lot in the Bible however just because there's always gonna be an element of faith it also doesn't mean the evidence and the truth is not gonna point you directly to God and Jesus Christ and that's what it's so interesting in this movie you see it got focusing on one point just the resurrection you can see these arguments these complex events and all the information kind of compiled all at once and that's really what I like about this movie it gives you some common ground it gives you a place to meet for people that are on different levels maybe in their spiritual walk or that don't believe at all to stand together in a little bit of respect just standing on facts and truth in general that I didn't think when people do find that level that rock that commonplace they can launch into deeper and even more important conversations whether you are a believer or not I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood if you like this video and others like it please consider
