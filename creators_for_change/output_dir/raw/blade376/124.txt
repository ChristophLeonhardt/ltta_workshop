00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,080
last 24 hours have been pretty pretty

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,140
tough for me but I've been quite a tough

cookie the past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I've always</font>

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,820
had a positive mind to<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,320
solutions when stuff happens in the

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,510
world and you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people say</font>

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,510
well some people say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know miles one</font>

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,640
person can't change it I'm like what no

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,260
that's that that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,450
person can change the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

15
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">about creating momentum and with</font>

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,700
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the world right</font>

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,250
now it requires mankind humans around

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,780
the world to unite and take action but

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">it has to start somewhere and me and</font>

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,479
many other people have taken initiative

21
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,720
to try and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen but</font>

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,600
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,299
was the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in many many mumps</font>

24
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:24,490
that I'd cry and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't like I just</font>

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,030
broke into<font color="#E5E5E5"> tears it was gradual but I am</font>

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,950
completely heartbroken by the course

27
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is taking for two years now</font>

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,580
I've been looking at the economic and

29
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">political and social trends of this</font>

30
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,520
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me as it was</font>

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,970
too many other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the infinite</font>

32
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,340
growth paradigm that we live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,030
sustainable and that when you have the

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,890
one percent verse of ninety-nine percent

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,500
the way I describe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this you have a</font>

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,979
deck of cards you make a house of cards

37
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:06,740
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say and the very top is the one</font>

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,389
percent now what happens if you take

39
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,519
away the cards from the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

40
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:12,440
just add on to the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> it collapses</font>

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the society cannot function if</font>

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,320
the overall population isn't taken care

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,940
of I mean if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it</font>

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,160
trivoli if if bankers early ones that

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,780
are left with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money who's going</font>

46
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the doctor to help them when they</font>

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,440
get it on that you know but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue i</font>

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,920
have right now is much deeper than just

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's the poor an emotional level because</font>

50
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:44,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">i am so disappointed with people that I</font>

51
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,670
know friends people that

52
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,450
I've grown up with the past five years

53
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,930
while using YouTube a great tool the

54
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,310
internet is only began to explode with

55
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,410
its social media potential the past five

56
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,060
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those that have</font>

57
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,700
grown up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it are the key holders to</font>

talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> it any sense because we talk about</font>

60
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,060
mainstream media that doesn't get the

61
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,190
internet and that's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

62
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,870
mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> media is being put out of</font>

63
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,540
business by the internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a</font>

64
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">cameraman turns up to a protest rally</font>

65
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,640
with whatever news channel with an

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,400
agenda and they interview<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone and</font>

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,709
the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives a good representative</font>

68
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,500
so it gives a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to what they</font>

69
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">are protesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about until I all know</font>

70
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,790
let's not show that there's someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

71
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,410
with a camera who's been filming it and

72
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,560
can upload<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uncensored online when</font>

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,250
people commit police brutality like an

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,220
Iraqi war veteran who served two terms

75
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,030
two tours in Iraq comes home cry test

76
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,970
for freedom and gets smacked in the head

77
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,390
by police it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking disgusting and</font>

78
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,850
what angered me most out of all of this

79
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,430
is that I'm just one person who's grown

80
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,130
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this technology but there are so</font>

81
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,320
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there who have way more</font>

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,140
exposure than me people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past</font>

83
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,320
year I actually made an effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I drove</font>

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,168
or I took trains to see people yeah

85
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,460
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to catch up but but</font>

86
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,410
specifically to tell them what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

87
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,419
coming around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner some of them</font>

88
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,039
turned away and weren't interested which

89
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,140
is just a usual way for humans to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

90
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font>

91
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,789
you will not act until it affects you

92
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,960
but then as other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were</font>

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,699
saying like about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our Universal</font>

94
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,860
solutions project which is a tool to

95
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,910
educate people and reduce corruption and

96
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,710
reduce speculation and less evidence is

97
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,009
there to free people and allow people to

98
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,410
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best opportunity in life this</font>

99
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,810
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole campaign with protest is not</font>

100
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,000
about making everyone equal it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,729
making everyone has equal opportunity

102
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,690
because some people in society are

103
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,979
geniuses you have so much to contribute

104
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,479
but just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

105
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,360
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the degree and the</font>

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,919
credentials next to name they are denied

107
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,800
that possibility of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,479
contribute something significant to

109
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,319
society and it's outrageous the last

110
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,699
thing to a friend who says all I like I

111
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,400
like your idea I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

112
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">how I can use it to make money it</font>

113
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,349
fucking makes me sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and at the time I</font>

114
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">just shrug it off and go you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

115
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,080
fair enough but every day every monument

116
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,849
II when I'm at work I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

117
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">these people that are put in their heads</font>

118
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,620
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line for our freedoms whilst the</font>

119
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,430
majority just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get on them find</font>

120
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,650
holes in their argument when they're not

121
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,030
realizing the people they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

122
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,979
pointing the finger at is the government

123
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,090
the people that should have been looking

124
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,030
after the world the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

125
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,370
bed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corporations because money</font>

126
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,660
is what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in life</font>

127
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,510
and yeah sure people can have some free

128
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,100
time and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whatever whatever</font>

129
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,660
they want but when all they talk about

130
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,750
is just entertainment and popular

131
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,080
culture what the fuck are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they doing</font>

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,050
like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have choices but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we also</font>

133
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,660
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibilities and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

134
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,550
this culture in which people think you

135
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm all right so I don't have</font>

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,870
to worry and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not acceptable the</font>

137
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,000
point I made especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing stick aid</font>

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,220
to people you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people nod and agree</font>

139
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it but do they actually acknowledge</font>

140
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,300
it through their actions is you know you

141
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,030
can the fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have voices the fact we</font>

142
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,130
have the internet such a great tool

143
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,350
which is it is is under threat at the

144
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,270
moment there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been reports of the</font>

145
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,000
u.s. police telling Google to take down

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,550
any footage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of police brutality and you</font>

147
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,620
know what if this revolution doesn't go

148
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,240
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the government will do</font>

149
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,770
whatever they can to ensure it doesn't

150
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,870
happen again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that means net</font>

neutrality<font color="#CCCCCC"> for internet censorship and</font>

152

155
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,080
might not have any money because savings

156
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,900
pensions are all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go because at</font>

157
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,760
the moment if we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the e for</font>

158
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,680
example they cain't printing out money

159
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,500
they keep saddling more debt to a

160
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">country which can't have the debt it has</font>

161
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,970
already as if that's the plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font>

162
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,220
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are making decisions without</font>

163
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,470
any dialogue with the general population

164
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't think it's their</font>

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,250
responsibility he will think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

166
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,940
politicians will take care of it

167
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,160
politicians are human beings too they're

168
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,380
collapsible there in a culture where

169
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,030
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do whatever they think without</font>

170
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,220
any real consideration to the bigger

171
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,460
picture short-term fixes not looking for

172
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,890
long-term prosperity that is the problem

173
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,630
we have and I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get angry a part</font>

174
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,750
of it you know I say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

175
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,930
you're angry<font color="#CCCCCC"> or sad or disappointed it's</font>

176
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,169

high

178
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,130
we've had to higher expectations of the

179

world humanity your friends because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

180
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,199
weren't met and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why you're</font>

disappointed if I was more realistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

182
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,130
if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have high expectations</font>

they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even attempt for reaching</font>

184
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,000
for him it's like humanity has

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,040
progressed so much you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I provide us</font>

186
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,289
a solution for the world's<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that</font>

187
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,729
my own like a resource-based economy and

most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go oh it's utopian the only</font>

189
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,120
reason it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you typing is because</font>

190
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,799
they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ideal situation</font>

191
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the truth is if we even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made twenty</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be a better world than it is today and</font>

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
this world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting better right</font>

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,220
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not flat lining it's getting</font>

197
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,900
worse and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to wake the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fuck</font>

198
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,370
up because there's gonna be a point

199
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,230
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> security is ripped from underneath</font>

200
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,150
your feet and you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in</font>

201
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,310
a strong position to defend<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself or</font>

202
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,830
defend people around you so how the hell

203
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,660
do people I respect you know who I've

204
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,260
explained I spend hours at a time

205
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,060
speaking to people saying the same thing

206
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,370
ensuring they understand it and they

207
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,350
understand it but it doesn't block

208
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,089
anything they just think well that's

209
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,459
great to know if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need it but i'll just</font>

210
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:24,680
go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the life i normally have and</font>

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,310
I'm just and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think another part of my</font>

frustration it's for two years now I

213
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:37,220
have been held a paranoid by someone

214
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,200
who's completely out of touch a

215
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,630
conspiracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> theorist like so many other</font>

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,080
about it because if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

minute get a suit think if we power you

are already proven

226

to be messing around corporations that

227
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,500
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are wrong more than one the big</font>

police brutality's<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

away the economy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just going to</font>

collapse one day you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

236

to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the government a part</font>

237
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,480
of the complacency of actually looking

238
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,550
for real solutions and just delaying the

239
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,610
inevitable you know and let in the ship

240
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,130
sink slowly what's all the rich people

241
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,290
siphon as many coins as they can on to

242
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,150
their life raft if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

243
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,860
metaphor that's what is happening and

244
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,440
all i ask is people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't just listen to</font>

245
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,750
what I'm saying now people go online and

246
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,030
research yet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i are i was on</font>

247
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,590
complaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my last video i did on</font>

248
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,480
youtube which was about ignoring

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,300
mainstream media and saying oh I had to

250
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">look for ages before I found anything</font>

251
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,660
you should have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking told me</font>

252
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,790
what you know what you need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

253
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,110
life because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think that</font>

254
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,060
everything you're told is true and that

255
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,830
you should be spoon-fed then you're a

256
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,570
part of the problem people need to wake

257
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,850
up people need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take responsibility</font>

258
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,050
people need to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

259
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,600
individuals together<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,360
responsibility to<font color="#CCCCCC"> educate ourselves and</font>

261
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,110
come to decent solutions and sure the

262
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,180
protests don't have around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

263
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,040
specific demands but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because</font>

264
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,380
there are such a wide variety of

265
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,270
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you look for the root</font>

266
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,370
cause of it all it all comes to one

267
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,460
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its money it's money and right</font>

268
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,290
now people go oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's about communism</font>

269
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,420
and it's about socialism it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

270
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">any of the isms there's going to be a</font>

271
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,870
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where people lose everything and</font>

272
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,400
it's not going to be about once anymore

273
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,990
it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be about needs and maybe</font>

274
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,160
that's the revolution we're going to

275
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,740
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take but all I want I just want</font>

276
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,360
it you know I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> loads of people</font>

277
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,700
stand by me I'm and this isn't aimed at

278
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,580
them I really appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but when</font>

279
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,260
you've grown<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with people who you've</font>

280
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,149
supported to help him<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know get</font>

281
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,690
exposure and it's just so they can do

282
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,810
what they want for fun or other one it

283
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,930
is some real return on that so when

284
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,089
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter they can help us</font>

285
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,350
make the world a better place and you

286
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,270
know decades an example where that has

287
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,580
happened but as i said before stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> head</font>

288
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,959
is only a part of the bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

289
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,910
because if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the money just</font>

290
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">throwing money at kids who are starving</font>

291
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,680
and suffering every time they that they

292
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,300
call an emergency is going to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

293
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,279
then then you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reconsider because</font>

294
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,870
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to have preventive</font>

295
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,160
measures we need to think about all of

296
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,980
this and as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse the</font>

297
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,390
US and<font color="#E5E5E5"> them mentality it's going to get</font>

298
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,550
worse it's going to get harsher and

299
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,080
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come a lot more</font>

300
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,260
irrational which is why we have to act

301
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,880
now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost I'm and I might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regret</font>

302
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,100
recording this but I feel a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot better</font>

303
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,209
because i feel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone at the moment</font>

304
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,190
not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am alone it's about what</font>

305
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,420
you feel this about perceptions and you

306
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,250
know i still sparking people as always

307
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,620
from time to time people saying oh yeah

308
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">i acknowledge it but that's it that's</font>

309
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,160
all they do they acknowledge it it's

310
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,870
like the cases you see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street</font>

311
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,320
where sonic knowledge is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony's falling</font>

312
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,579
over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt themselves but that's what</font>

313
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,260
they do they acknowledge it her

314
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,880
society's not about acknowledging the

315
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,820
problems is about doing saying about it

316
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,050
and it's not to say that you need to

317
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,820
have a solution come forward it's about

318
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,800
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> people make them aware because</font>

319
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,740
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> initiative we are</font>

320
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,459
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be forever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spoon fed and tribe</font>

321
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,459
alized by mainstream media politicians

322
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,839
and corporations because together they

323
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,980
have one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind and that it's</font>

324
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,649
self-preservation if anyone wants to

325
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,260
chat i do it live show on sundays at

327
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,399
benign p.m. gmt I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

328
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,610
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> post it that if I'm even going</font>

329
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,120
to post it

330
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hate using the rhetoric on people</font>

331
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,860
to wake up well I'm sorry you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

332

333
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,170
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will become perfectly clear that</font>

334
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,280
we are living beyond our means right now

335
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,050
because television entertainment pop

336
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,630
culture isn't going to matter when your

337
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,430
savings are gone when unemployment goes

338
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,020
through the roof<font color="#CCCCCC"> and money is worth</font>

339
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,750
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no system we can put</font>

340
00:14:47,750 --> 00:00:00,000
in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to replace that with a now</font>
