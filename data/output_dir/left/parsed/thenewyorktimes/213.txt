Hi, I’m Joe Russo.
And I’m Anthony Russo.
And we are the directors of
“Avengers: Infinity War."
This scene takes
place about 20 minutes
into the film in Dr.
Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum.
And Tony Stark is looking
at the burner phone
that Steve Rogers gave to him,
trying to decide whether or not
he’s actually going to
contact Steve about what’s
occurring in the movie when
he is interrupted by a sound.
"Say, Doc.
You wouldn’t happen to be
moving your hair, would you?"
"Not at the moment, no."
Part of the creative
appeal of this movie
was us bringing together
disparate characters
throughout the MCU and kind
of smashing them together
in a crisis situation.
The intention was to create
propulsive narrative, where
the plot is driven
by the villain,
and he keeps interrupting
the heroes because he’s
one step ahead of them.
This is one of those incidents.
And this shot, you
know, part of what
we tried to bring to the MCU
as filmmakers on a tonal level
ever since our first
film, “Captain America,
Winter Soldier” is just a
grounding and a real world
patina over who these
people are to try
to bring out their humanity
a little more in contrast
to their powers.
And this shot here is in
that vein in the sense
that it’s a very long shot.
We stay in the perspective
of these characters
as they walk out into
Greenwich Village
and discover the scene
of chaos unfolding.
And we discover it as they
discover it, and the scope
of it as they discover it.
It’s a way to increase tension
as they walk down the sidewalk.
What are they going to see?
What is the audience
going to see?
And then here is
probably the most asked
about VFX shot in the
movie is the hair standing up
on Peter Parker’s arm.
We’ve been asked
hundreds of times
how we got Tom Holland’s
hair to stand up his arm.
And it was a very gentle blowing
on his ear actually did it.
 It’s a CG shot.
But this fulfilling the
promise of “Infinity War”
is that all of the characters
are working together
in this movie to try to stop
Thanos, including Stan Lee.
"What’s the matter with you kids?
You never seen a
spaceship before?"
While this is a
multi-perspective film,
Thanos is the glue that binds
all the characters together,
as we watch Peter Parker swing
off towards the incident in New
York.
