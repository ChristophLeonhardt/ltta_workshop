now that Alexandria Acacio Cortez has won the congressional primary in New York's 14th district people are taking her a lot more seriously which means she's gonna get a lot more smears now some of those smears are coming from the right wing and the most recent example features a man by the name of John cardio he is a host of Newsmax America talks live and he apparently showed a picture shared a picture of a kasnia Cortez his childhood home on Twitter and made all sorts of assumptions about her and even the school that she went to so let's take a quick look at the tweet that he shared and again it shows a picture of her childhood home and he says this is the Yorktown Heights very nice area home Acacio Cortez grew up in before going off to Ivy League Brown University a far cry from the Bronx hood upbringing she's selling well no you got a lot of things wrong and so look I back in the day you have some pretty weak people on the Left who just kind of let those attacks stand but not with her kasnia cortez and i love the way that she responded to him so let's go to her response on Twitter she says hey John 1 I didn't go to brown or the Ivy League I went to bu Boston University try Google - it is nice growing up it was a good town for working people my mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here and I grew up seeing how the zip code how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity and then her third point goes as follows she says your attempt to strip me of my family my story my home and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of those things damn get it okay we said that is okay so now but did Alexandria hide that fact though and now revealed by the right-wing aha no she said it in a lot of the interviews we did with her way before the election in fact Emma big 'land of rebel headquarters went and interviewed her and spent a day with her and in this April 3rd 2018 obviously several months before the election video she explains exactly where she came from so watch kind of between two worlds I grew up half in the Bronx my dad had a business here I was born in this neighborhood but then I also grew up half a little bit more upstate as well because when I was a young kid my mom saw the state of public schools in the Bronx and we couldn't afford private school we couldn't really afford tuition anywhere else so my whole family had kind of chipped in for a tiny little house upstate and I went to public school about 40 minutes north of here he's told that in almost all the interviews that we did with her at the young turks for months and months before the election why she says look we got to do better for the Bronx so that people don't have to go 40 minutes away so that they don't have to you know just kill themselves to afford a tiny little home somewhere else to get a good education right why don't we bring the good education of the Bronx she never had that she was absolutely clear it's actually one of the reasons she won but the right wing they don't have an off button on smear yeah that's so true that's so true and look she came at him strong and she corrected him and he had to correct you know the record on his Twitter account which is good so he he says I stand corrected but then he still pushed this notion that she lived in like a fancy house you know and that she didn't really have the kind of childhood that she described no she had the kind of childhood she described I mean what did you do you want her living out on the streets her entire life to prove prove her point I love that she's hitting back and she's doing so in a powerful strong way all the power to her let's go get them two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you are notified of our videos
