2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,240
video was going to be a follow-up to the

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,160
questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> vice video that I started</font>

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple of videos ago but that was a</font>

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,030
lie I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love you please have me</font>

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,110
still and instead because I've kind of

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,340
hit a wall in the ass thing that I'm

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to write at this precise moment</font>

9

in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a</font>

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,020
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that have been going on past</font>

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaves at first I watched the J</font>

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,830
rolling and Oprah interview which I

13
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,359
thought was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good because I'm in the</font>

14
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,740
USA i could watch on the television

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,449
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice but otherwise you</font>

16
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:28,740
can catch it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the new key video</font>

galleries check out the link in the

18
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,159
description bar I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was well</font>

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,329
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I felt some of the questions</font>

20
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,710
we're really annoying I thought that

21
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was very random questions about</font>

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,730
your to be asking and I mean this is

23
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,469
coming from someone who Oprah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just means</font>

24
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,300
nothing you know like that she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

25
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,829
part of my life at or where she never

26
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,360
really has been i knew nothing about

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,399
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> her life story until recently this</font>

28
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is coming from someone who's a fan of</font>

29
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,120
the jonathan ross Stephen Fry and

30
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">Richard and Judy interviews with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jay</font>

31
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,270
rolling like it's not kind of

32
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,530
interviewing these two and the thing

33
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">that really bugs me is how many times it</font>

34
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,609
kept saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> billion-a-month because</font>

35
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,809
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not her achievement her</font>

36
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,090
achievements<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the wealth because</font>

37
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,220
she's a mother or anything like that it

38
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,080
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was odd that kind of got away no</font>

39
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,850
just annoyed me I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hated that that</font>

40
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,650
had to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the level which people related</font>

41
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,850
to the interview it should have been

42
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,460
more of a kind of human<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions rather</font>

43
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,619
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> your rich and your mother another</font>

44
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,119
couple of things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just finished reading</font>

45
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,130
Jays of Conrad's a secret agents just

46
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good actually because at five times</font>

47
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">come right in not so great slightly</font>

48
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,830
satirical kind of funny about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

49
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,049
secret agent married and have these

50
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:30,210
domestic arguments all the time and it's

51
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,009
not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good secret agent of sits</font>

52
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,990
around doing nothing etc but it turns

53
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,450
into a really really good read I<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

54
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,790
that very moved by it at the end I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

55
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,290
I don't know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would read it it's not</font>

56
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,030
like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as dense as heart of</font>

57
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,560
darkness or anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't get</font>

58
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,329
a not strong the way as easily as you do

59
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,770
for heart darkness but I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

60
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,250
good secondly i recently read

61
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,770
winter girls by<font color="#CCCCCC"> laurie halse anderson</font>

62
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,990
has the same things me a book that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font>

63
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">been kind of slightly wanting to reach</font>

64
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,350
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had been putting off</font>

65
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,610
because I if there's a lot of people

66
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">close to me you have eating disorders</font>

67
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,990
and who have had leaching disordered so

68
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,120
it's something that I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to read</font>

69
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,070
about because I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

70
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's portrayed very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patronising the old</font>

71
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:12,260
card without a sense of understanding or

72
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,790
just gets everything wrong and it's

73
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,260
giggling and especially when people are

74
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,420
writing almost routine audience they

75
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,610
definitely patronize it when they

76
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,680
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing it like they wash it</font>

77
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,820
down when they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing saying</font>

78
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,709
that's done i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think when two girls was</font>

79
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:27,080
really exceptional really well done done

80
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,390
bit slick which genuinely just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

81
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,430
grabbed home to me kind of shook me it

82
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,470
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it was really really jarring i</font>

83
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,360
think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just very well done it's</font>

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,380
probably the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best young LOL portrayal of</font>

85
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,820
eating disorders that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've read I mean</font>

86
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be another one but it is one</font>

87
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,470
like to tread cautiously with especially

88
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,900
if you know someone with an engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

89
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,940
have a history of it because it is it is

90
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,790
jarring but i will say now I must stop

91
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,739
procrastinating get back to my essay but

92
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,330
before I say that thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all your</font>

93
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,950
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> government's on my last video</font>

94
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,250
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really i have no faith in</font>

95
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,799
my ability to sing or write songs but a

96
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,570
lot of you said really nice things and

97
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,790
that's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> great but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laughed myself</font>

98
00:03:07,790 --> 00:00:00,000
all the time see any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>
