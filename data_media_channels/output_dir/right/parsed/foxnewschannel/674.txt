>> Ed: A FOX NEWS ALERT.
GORDON.
HE IS A FORMER COACH OF THE
OHIO STATE WRESTLING TEAM.
HE IS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL WHEN HE
SAYS HE DID NOT KNOW THE TEAM
DOCTOR WAS SEXUALLY ABUSING
ATHLETES.
HERE'S WHAT HE IS SAYING ABOUT
>> ALLIGOOD DO IS TELL THE TRUT
TRUTH.
INVESTIGATION.
I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THEY
CAN'T FIND HIS EMAIL ADDRESS.
THEY CAN'T TELL US WHO THEY TALK
TO WHEN THEY CALLED HER OFFICE.
BUT YET, THEY CAN TELL THE PRESS
THAT THEY REACHED OUT TO US AND
WE DIDN'T RESPOND.
HE'S HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN.
FIRST OF ALL, THESE KINDS OF
ACCUSATIONS ARE VERY SERIOUS.
I WONDER ON THE SUBSTANCE OF IT,
WHAT IS HE SAYING?
YOU HAVE A FOURTH WRESTLER
SAYING HE WAS GROPED BY THE TEAM
DOCTOR.
THAT BASICALLY THEY TALK TO
THEM, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
>> HE AND HIS OFFICE HAVE BEEN
DENYING IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
WHAT WE DO HAVE HERE ARE THESE
EMAILS NOW, HE WRESTLED UNDER
JIM JORDAN.
THE REASON HE STARTED TO SEND
THESE EMAILS, IF YOU READ
THROUGH THEM THEY ARE PEPPERED
WITH EMOJIS.
AND REACH OUT TO SOMEBODY LIKE
JIM JORDAN.
HE STARTED TO DO THIS IN MARCH,
HE FOLLOWED UP AND MAIL IN JUNE.
HE'S IN A HIGH PROFILE POSITION.
HE NEEDS TO LEAD.
IN ONE EMAIL HE CALLED HIM
REVEREND JAMES.
A SQUEAKY CLEAN IMAGE.
>> Ed: THEY ARE SAYING SPEAK
OUT NOW.
WHAT EVIDENCE IF ANY IS OR THAT
HE KNEW OR DIDN'T KNOW YEARS AGO
IN THE 90s THAT THIS
SEXUAL ABUSE WAS GOING ON?
IS THERE CUSTOMER >> THERE
ISN'T, AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM.
HOW DO YOU GO BACK AND SAY I
KNEW SOMETHING 35 YEARS AGO.
HOW DO I PROVE THIS?
THIS IS WHAT WILL HANG OVER HIM.
HE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT HE WANTS
TO RUN FOR LEADERSHIP NEXT YEAR.
>> Ed: HE COULD BE THE NEXT
FIGURE OF THE HOUSE.
>> THERE COULD BE SOMETHING
THERE IF THEY LOSE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THE LEADERSHIP
WILL DO IT.
>> Ed: WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY
EVIDENCE THAT PROVES THAT HE
KNEW ABOUT THE SEXUAL ABUSE.
ALSO, INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN
GUILTY.
IS THERE ANY HINT IN THE EMAILS,
I KNOW IT IS EARLY IN THE
INVESTIGATION THAT THIS PERSON
OUT THERE WAS TRYING TO
BLACKMAIL HIM?
SUGGESTING, YOU HAVE SOMETHING
HIS POSITION.
YOU WERE SOMEONE AT THE TIME
THAT THIS WAS GOING ON, IF YOU
HEAD WRESTLING COACH.
ARCHIE GRIFFIN, THE TWO-TIME
HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER.
ALL OF HER LUCK, THE FATHER OF
BOTTOM LINE, PEOPLE AROUND HIM,
HE'S BEEN GOING AFTER THE FBI.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
HE IS DEMANDING ANSWERS AND THE
TRUMP AND CLINTON INVESTIGATIONS
TRUMP AND CLINTON INVESTIGATION
INVESTIGATIONS.
MAYBE SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IS
TRYING TO GET BACK AT HIM.
>> HE IS USE THAT NARRATIVE.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME SMOKING
GUN THAT CONNECTS THOSE THINGS.
THERE IS NOTHING.
WHAT YOU COULD BE HAVING HERE IS
THAT HE WANTS TO MOVE UP, HE'S
BEEN VERY VOCAL ON THE FBI.
WHAT THEY KNEW THAT THE DOJ.
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, YOU GET A
BIGGER TARGET ON YOUR BACK.
IF YOU HAVE THIS DAMOCLES
HANGING OVER YOU THAT NOBODY CAN
PROVE OR DISPROVE, THAT COULD
UNDERCUT YOU IN A POTENTIAL
LEADERSHIP RACE.
>> Ed: AGAIN, NO EVIDENCE THAT
HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.
15 SECONDS.
YOU WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANY OF
THIS?
WHAT IS THE NEXT MOVE.
>> THINGS WILL HEAT UP WHEN THEY
COME TO SESSION NEXT WEEK.
CONGRESS IS OUT UNTIL TUESDAY.
