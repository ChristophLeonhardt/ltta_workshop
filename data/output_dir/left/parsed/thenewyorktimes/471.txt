It could take anywhere between two and 
a half to four weeks to weave a wig.
That's working eight hours a day until
your eyeballs
contract and you can't see anymore.
The easiest weaves is when you
grab as much hair as you can
and you knot it.
If I go overboard,
a hundred pounds of hair,
It's like feeding a baby a steak.
That's an overkill.
A nondescript head of hair is the 
most difficult thing to accomplish.
This was made for you, 
even before I met you.
So I've been doing this 
now for about 45 years,
and I started in 19...
'69, ’70.  I can’t even remember when.
Wigs and hair pieces and hair ornaments
were the standard with people of wealth.
All the wigs were constructed.
They were like, embalmed.
Synthetic hair came in the late sixties.
It allowed everybody to be able to 
afford a wig that was like a joke.
This is just hair,
and water.
Just like what you do with your hair.
Take the top back, and then
a little to the side.
She likes a little height.
So, what I do in the morning:
I wet it and I just bend 
down and I go like this.
It's like it's my hair. 
And I just go crazy over it.
I'm wearing a wig because I'm alopecia.
The more successful I am,
the more  the lady just looks 
like she's got a head of hair.
Some of the wigs are made for 
people undergoing chemotherapy,
male pattern baldness.
Some of the wigs are made 
for religious clients,
which would be an orthodox 
Jewish person.
Some of the wigs are made
for theatrical people.
We did a wig recently for the 
cover of New York Magazine.
>The hardest hair to get,
and the most expensive,
Is your natural light colors from Europe.
My wigs are 99 percent European hair
because that's what my clientele requests.
A lace front wig like this 
in my shop could go from,
$5,500 to about
$8000.
I need to weave the 
hair one strand at a time
>to create that godly effect
It's tremendous labor,
and all the labor is art.
