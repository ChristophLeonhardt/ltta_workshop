is all politics local or has the entertainment news industry made all politics national we discuss with the mayor of the village of Greenwood Lake New York population 3301 Jesse Dwyer then the daily callers a number Athey and The Daily wires Amanda presto Giacomo joined the panel of deplorable z to talk Ted Cruz's porn preferences uncontacted Amazon jungle tribes and my cousin hillary clinton's latest tinfoil hat rantings at the launch of her terrible book i'm michael knowles and this is the michael knowles show I couldn't even get it out of my mouth my second cousin once-removed Hilary's book it's so it's such an upsetting event that she's going to be going on this tour and showing her face but probably it's good for Republicans so anyway today we always talk about national politics we talk about President Trump we talk about big trends we talk about the sky high view we never talk about local politics we never talk about politics on the ground what it's really like for people who were going out there pressing palms go on a spaghetti dinner is and what regular Americans in that little sliver of the country between LA and New York or thinking and what their lives are like and what they're talking about beyond just the latest Trump tweet and all of the reaction to it so I would like to talk about local politics today I want to talk about the real nitty-gritty because I think basically the problem with all political shows right now is that the reason that they like sports predictors very often get their predictions wrong is because they don't actually go out there and talk to voters and so they miss that huge swath that's but not us because we press the palms and we've got these great experts who are coming in so you know I think it's former House speaker Tip O'Neill really made the blanket statement on this when he said all politics is local now he's a Democrat so he's probably wrong and here is Newt Gingrich explaining why he's wrong first of all O'Neill was wrong all politics was not local it wasn't even local when he was speaker when when in the Vietnam War the draft was extended to college students every college student in every congressional district in the country noticed at the same weekend so it wasn't local its impact may be local second we live in a national media in the last month of the campaign Rush Limbaugh will talk to a national audience Sean Hannity will talk to a national audience a national audience will read The Wall Street Journal editorial page of the New York Times editorial page people will wake up and turn on the Today Show and Good Morning America and Fox and Friends on CBS Morning News and they're going to get a national conversation so if one party has a huge advantage in that national conversation party has big advantages in turnout now it is my distinct pleasure to bring on my friend of many years the mayor of Greenwood Lake New York and also partner of red pillar political consulting mr. Jesse Dwyer Jesse thanks for coming on Michael thanks a lot for having that so Jesse it's funny you mention those because I'm pretty sure you and I I should I should for the people who are listening and watching I should say Jesse and I have worked on about a hundred million campaigns together in suburban New York in rural New York we have been to a million spaghetti dinners we have been to train stations we have talked to a lot of voters on a lot of campaigns some of those campaigns unexpectedly won a lot of those campaigns did not win because New York is left of Lenin but Jesse that's why I wanted to bring you on I feel like you can bring a great perspective that is completely missing from political news shows which is it is all politics local or is all politics national you know the national media they're gonna focus on national issues and unfortunately it's turned into the WWF and increased ratings and trying to get everybody's attention and everything is really erratic and everybody's it's high stress levels and they're getting ratings and they're getting viewers because of this high stress so that's getting into local people's television but that doesn't mean that local people in rural areas and middle-class areas really care too much about national issues it may grab their attention but they're certainly not voting on it it's not affecting their school taxes it's not affecting their roads that are in front of their house but affecting you know property dispute it's not affecting what I believe to be things that will drive middle-class people to the polls on both local as well as national issues you know it's a you've got two different things here you've got the Democratic machine in the inner cities where it doesn't matter about national politics they do exactly what they're told they're gonna vote Democrat then you've got everywhere else in America which I would say is predominantly the Republican Party right that's where everybody else who voted for Trump outside of the major cities they're more focused about school taxes school issues getting jobs and the things that matter most them and I would argue are more local issues than nationally and the the national news media and the big political shows they never talk about it because you're right it's like the WWF and and it's probably for I think a lot of people and a lot of small towns it's like the WWF also in that you can talk about it you talk about it just like you watched a ballgame or you watched a reality TV show or you watched some event it's fun it's gossip it's entertaining but it isn't your property taxes it isn't your school taxes it just does not affect your life right you watch Fox News or CNN and they're both all about entertainment and - you know look at the storm the storm was literally a 10-day extravaganza hype it up and as much people you know as many people scared as possible and it does serve a valuable purpose you know you're learning people - the potential danger but they literally will drag out any piece of energetic or stressful information as long as they possibly can and it does get attention at those bring people together and I think speaker Gingrich was correct and people are following this information but I certainly don't think it is what genuinely drives people to the polls and will determine elections on that point I think we should point out rush limbaugh was absolutely right and vindicated here he predicted a week ago that hurricane Irma was being hyped for ratings when he was forced to evacuate they raked him over the coals they called him a hypocrite they said was awful and then it turns out he was absolutely 100% right so another another choc for Rush Limbaugh now Jesse as a mayor what are your priorities you're a mayor of a local government small town what are your priorities I assume it's Melania Trump shoes right which shows are they wearing the sneakers right it's ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous and I know you're gonna talk about Ted Cruz's little porn incident like who cares about that it was an accident earlier has an example show Bob Menendez folks think about Bob Menendez trial they're looking at you know Ted Cruz some staffer tweeted this out because it's interesting people are gonna see the lengths they're gonna click on it and the drive viewers gonna get support people in my community they don't care about that stuff you mentioned Ted Cruz they probably have them don't even know who he is and you ran for president they just don't care you know they care about the lake they care about the infrastructure in our community they care about our schools and roads you know those are the issues they care about when you hear someone like Donald Trump talking about those issues talking about infrastructure and jobs you know that's those are local issues that affect people locally they're not talking about winning and atthe room you can use or which gender you think you are talking about things that the matter jobs the infrastructure right those are those are inner-city issues where the Democrats I would argue are you know focus on those things and and they're following the Democratic agenda for the most part and I was out here in rural America and the middle class and the Republican Party we care about the real things you know the jobs what kind of a future our kids are gonna have in the school districts and things like that thank you for validating a perspective I've had now for I guess six months or nine months which is whenever Donald Trump tweets something people lose their minds their heads explode they say oh my gosh it's gonna get us into war it's going to undermine this bill it's going to stop this legislation yada yada yada yada and my reaction almost across the board is that I don't care other than the Kofa a tweet which I really loved but I just don't who cares I mean I enjoy it I find it entertaining in so much as he affects conservative policy I'm happy in so much as he does nothing I'm also happy as a conservative myself but I think that the point that half of your constituents might not have even heard of Ted Cruz I think that is true around the country and it's so easy for us in political media to lose sight of the fact that I guarantee you nobody in your community and very few people in any other community have ever heard of Jim Gilmore he ran for president too the only reason they heard of George Pataki is because the govern of their state that those priorities do you think that plays into why political pundits on the national level are so often wrong you know I think I think they're probably wrong is because they constantly have to find the next thing they constantly had to I have the ten-day news cycle showing the this storm and they have to predict it because they have to be on TV to have to be talking about it and they're doing that for everything they're making predictions they're always making some sort of a guess and they're sticking by it they're following through with it and I think it's because they feel compelled to just constantly have some sort of a stressful energetic component on the TV that's what they're doing so I think they're do you think pundits need to go press the flesh and go work on a few campaigns and eat spaghetti dinners like you and I have done do you think that would help their predictions or do you think these crazy predictions are just built into the system there are senior citizens literally sitting in front of Fox they were scared to death that something is gonna happen and they feel that their success rating is gonna go up if they can make that senior citizen constantly watch them or you know the taxpaying citizen can't pay their bills and they're just gonna watch these things I'm a twenty-seven you're honest it constantly watches these things too I don't really watch it I don't watch news all the time and most of the time I don't watch Fox News or CNN because it's constantly this aggravating loud music stressful you know they're trying to get your attention to trying to make you believe that the problems are far worse than they really are and I don't want to do that I have enough problems that we're dealing with in my community for me to not give a crap about what's going on and in Florida quite frankly you know it doesn't matter it an interesting thing that I'd like to see every once in a while but my priorities the local mayor is ensuring that our our lake is clean that our roads are swept that our roads are properly paved and then the neighbor disputes are handled properly you know I don't really care I have sympathy for the residents of Florida but I don't need to hear about it for ten days that's what their local media should be focusing on but I don't need I don't need to see that up here in New York yeah I really couldn't care less I under there are a lot of people who have houses in Florida but you know that's what it is in my opinion they feel compelled to drag out whatever news they get an elaborate on it as much as they possibly can because that's what gets people interested and Jesse you'll forgive me but on this round I'm just I'm just writing down some of the advice you're giving me from my own show I need louder music I need to scare senior citizens do I get you through salary yeah we're gonna scratch that one so that everything you've said makes perfect sense I've always assumed this to be the case having been on the campaign trail with a number of politicians and with you as well now going back to the national politics that we constantly have to talk about to scare senior citizens what is your impression if I watch Fox News or CNN or MSNBC especially if I read the New York Times or Washington Post I get the feeling that not a single person in this country supports President Trump that they all are outraged he's gonna lose in a landslide in 2020 what is your reaction on the ground talking to your constituents do you do you think that they're they support the president do you think it's mixed or everyone's against him but what do you really feel just if you really think if this WWF personality that fits perfectly into hyping everything up but if you look at his accomplishments what he did before he became president what he's doing as president you can certainly see that he's very well qualified for the position he has the he has the smarts he has to know how the negotiating skills he was put into a very complicated situation coming in with the Congress to I think almost unanimously opposed Donald Trump so he wasn't really able to accomplish much with their support but we'll obviously take that up with our local congressman when it comes for the election but you know listen I think Donald Trump's doing a great job as president he's handled these hurricanes very well he's been down there and even though he's getting criticized left and right about shoes and hats and all these other big those things did a very good job you can hear that all of the elected officials in both Texas and Florida and he's got a long way to go he's got a long road ahead of him and I think he's going to do a great job considering the circumstances that he's in and I'm certainly looking forward to seeing some of the primary makers of our country well you know what you have just said is something it is exactly the opposite of what every smart elite political pundit is saying with the exception of an culture and culture made the same point which is I think the common view right now is that President Trump is effective and was elected because of his personality because he's mean he's a bully he takes the fight to the Democrats and he wasn't elected because of his issues people don't really care about the issues people don't really care about what he'll affect all they care about is that fun mean angry personality and what you've said and what a lot of people that I've talked to in local politics have said and also Ann Coulter is it's exactly the opposite he was elected despite his personality because his issues were so popular putting America first on manufacturing as he says or renegotiating certain trade deals we're just turning the whole focus on to jobs and deregulation and constitutional originalism and all of the other stuff is just a circus to surround what people really care about well the Democrats and other sore losers who didn't vote for him and didn't support him and who are bitter they're never gonna like they didn't like him to begin with they're not gonna like him now they're not gonna give them chances but if you look at middle-class America and people like many people like you you and dr. Hayworth on yesterday we're giving them a chance because he is our president and the future of our country depends on his success we had to help them we have to encourage him we have to support him whether you agree or disagree you have to support our president and you know he's not getting much help with Congress he's not getting much help with certain state leaders but at the end of the day we need to support him and I'm certainly optimistic because you know I didn't vote for him I do think that he's uh he's doing a great job so far but he's not getting he's not getting a very good bring up his head trouble with Congress he has had trouble with Congress he's sort of new to politics he's never held elected office before you're not new to politics you've you're a veteran of it compared to the president do you have any advice for the guy on how to make better deals with Congress and get some legislation passed so I had a professor in college who became a friend of mine and a mentor he gave me this advice when I first got into politics he said local politics contrary to congressional politics and national politics it's hand-to-hand combat so it is vastly different what I have to do that was say the President or a congressperson art assembly has to do in that I work and live and represent along my individuals you know I'm here every day working with them you're gonna see that I literally will pass I will pass someone on the street and they'll either give me a high-five or wanna you know slap me in the face I fingered high-five yep right but you know advice that I could give to the president is very difficult because this his position that he's in now is vastly different than business is vastly different than his experience that he had he's uniquely qualified in that no one could essentially assume the office of the presidency and have all of the tools necessary to be prepared if somebody saw some great government very large state but I would say that you know he is prepared with all the business skills far more than I was to become mayor although I run a business myself but you know he's dealt with lobbyists he's dealt with Congress he's dealt with all these things he can certainly get things done and I think if he were a different man who had a different background and didn't say crazy things before he was elected he would have had a little bit more assistance and accomplishing things in the outset of his presidency it's hard to tell how much of the personality helps him how much of it hurts him one good bit of advice that he gave to himself of course is despite the constant negative fresco feffy that might sum it up we need to bring on Jesse will you stick around for our panel all right we got to bring on the panel of deplorable z we have a great one today we have amber Fe from The Daily Caller and we have Amanda presto Giacomo from The Daily wire and I won't listen we've had just been to schlubs talking the whole time now we have these ladies who are coming on the but if you don't subscribe to the daily wire you can't see the rest of the show I'm sorry but you got to go to daily wire comm right now it's ten bucks a month 100 dollars

there's another incentive go over there right now and we'll be right back Ted Cruz broke the internet this morning when someone screenshotted an apparent like from his Twitter account that suggested senator Cruz had been interacting with smut with that I bring on my panel I bring on mixed company amber thank you for coming your first time on the panel it is a great story but was it cruise or was it just some staffer are almost entirely run by their constructors or lower-level staffers that sort of take care of everything so I don't know if it was done intentionally I'm sure that the Cruz Twitter account doesn't follow any porn sites so my guess is that maybe they were on some kind of TweetDeck or they were searching for some kind of hash tag and their finger accidentally brushed a like button so you know things that it was some staffer who was up to no good in the halls of one of the buildings up on Capitol Hill I think this is a whole lot to do about nothing Amanda can you please bring back some smut after that real letdown what do you think it makes any sense whatsoever that senator Cruz was perusing pornography and interacting with pornographers on Twitter does that story hold together at all um well I mean Rafael Cruz okay that's true Cruz maybe maybe he is promoting porn I wouldn't put it past this family to do something like relatively the porn is pretty innocent compared to murdering a president true so again past this the Cruz family but but in all seriousness Amber's correct I mean these things are not actually run by these senators or I mean if you remember Hillary Clinton's like her your email her Twitter it was all like millennial pop stuff so again there's just like young interns it was not it was not Ted Cruz unfortunately that would be a great story all right Jesse doesn't MIT assume that ted cruz was looking at some naked ladies on his computer does it matter does it change our view of cruz will it affect his job as a senator is there any certainly it's a it's a scintillating story but is there any implication for him as a politician first and that's that I'm pretty confident that Trump's Twitter handle with all the grammatical errors I know firsthand its congressmen and Senators and sometimes a dozen people if not more running their Facebook he is the exception though I'm not sure when he tweeted out my book reasons to vote for Democrats he people asked what was the strategy who he did he have to do it and what he just did it when I was on Fox and Friends I was on Fox and Friends I said something nice about him and he immediately tweeted it there was no meeting about this so good on him I love that he's running his own and we haven't seen any porn on there but back to mr. Cruz Jesse no I mean look everyone look at look at all these senators and all these congressmen they're all doing crazy things and I don't think that something that minor would have really affected his career especially in in Texas I don't think he has really a tough time getting reelected in the state of Texas but to be honest with you and I mean it's just not that big of a deal in this day and age is adjusting that many more people will get internet pornography that it's a many billions of dollars a year industry I am clutching my pass I would not absalom sure you've never done it you know that but I think again I mean there's so many issues if you look at all these congressmen at all these senators across the entire country we're all the crazy things they're doing Bob Menendez is literally under trial right now for federal bribery and I'm sure he's going to be fine unless he gets convicted in which case he would probably have to resign but during that entire process he'd probably get reelected you know it's like these people that use and that's another point to bring it back home all politics is local people don't care about Ted Cruz a little you know click on a possible porn site which we all know he didn't do and people aren't right now caring too much about Bob Menendez they're worrying about local issues their school taxes and what really affects that most not that everybody hates Congress but they love their Congressman moving on from civilization into the jungles of Brazil the New York Times is reporting that uncontacted tribes men have been killed in the jungles of Brazil this is the second attacked on the uncontacted tribes this year in Brazil which government has promised to protect them so Amanda there's this great documentary on Netflix coincidentally I just watched a couple days ago it's a new documentary on there and it's called first contact Lost Tribe of the Amazon so one of these guys he's just come out of the jungle and he describes a Jaguar eating his grandmother he describes going days at a time for days at a time without eating so much as a bite of food so the first question that comes into my mind is why haven't we brought these uncontacted isolated tribes into civilization what is it that's keeping us from bringing them into the nice luxury and glories of the civilized world I think this is like a good example of this fear that people have being labeled like you know xenophobic or no all cultures are the same imperialism you can't be imperialistic exactly and I think this is like a prime example of that that you know everything is equal no not all cultures are the same and this is that example where people are just so scared to you know show actual civilization you don't feel live like a barbarian but can't do that it'll be a xenophobe and imperialistic so it's really sad honestly and it's it's a romantic idea amber it's this romantic Western idea that there's the noble savage who hasn't been tainted or corrupted by our civilization which is so awful if only we could go back and live in the trees in nature but we know it's a terrible life they eat bugs whenever they can find them they're hunted down they have low life expectancies in so much as we can measure how long they live very any of these tribes particularly in the Amazon can't count above ten so the tribes who have come at that we've contacted have almost universally said they don't want to go back they love clothing they like having pots and pans and and food to eat regularly so what does it say about us that we think that the jungle tribesmen have it better than us who have electricity and our problem is that we're too fat not too skinny well I think it's sort of this moral relativist thing that Amanda was talking about where I find this is really an issue with liberals where they sort of fetishize these tribes and they view them more as almost endangered species than they do actual human beings I'm sorry to interrupt but great use of the word fetish right after we were talking about Ted Cruz's porn preferences very well we actually are viewing these people as human beings with actual human rights and we would recognize that on the whole it's better for these people to be integrated into society and there's a reason why we ask immigrants for example to assimilate to our culture it's because if you don't you start to see these blatant violations of human rights you'll notice that for example female genital mutilation has been on the rise in the United States that's been shockingly a major issue and so this isn't all just people being imperialist and being racist there's a really good reason why we asked people to assimilate to a certain kind of culture in a certain human right standard and it is so dehumanizing your right to say well those people that look how cute they are running around naked in the jungle let we need to preserve them so that we can go and watch them how interesting and adorable at all is Jessie let's bring it back to local politics you solve a lot of local disputes in these isolated areas villagers often report that the tribesmen will raid their villages they'll steal their things they'll kill some of them they'll attack the local villagers but the villagers are not allowed to respond in kind because the uncontacted tribes are totally protected by those governments so how should the in these totally far-flung areas how should these disputes be resolved I personally believe that we we shouldn't have much of an involvement in it I don't think that we have a right or an obligation to get involved in any situation that's over there the Amazon other than any sort of a business interest that our nation may have in that area which obviously there are many but I happen to believe in an anti-imperialist at you and I don't think that we should be involved in a lot of other cars think of Eastern comics do you think the local governments should go in and try to mediate this or or bring the tribes out of isolation or basically sale is a fair live-and-let-live you know just don't do it in the streets and scare the horses yeah I think there are a lot of variables we just don't understand or comprehend from where we're sitting in America you know that I would say more than likely yes it should be up to the local government to determine the outcome of any local tribes just like we would handle certain situations like that here in America local looting of the local mayor hmm right right he's trying to bring it right back yeah exactly yeah autonomy we want in our village III would say that we we over here we shouldn't have anything to do with it it should be left up to the local governments of Brazil or wherever this was found and I don't think that we have enough information from where we're sitting or enough perspective to give on how that should be handled you know it's great to bring people into a civilized world but that's what we define as a civilized world just because their life expectancy isn't as high as what standards might you know we might expect it to be that doesn't mean that that's the life they want to live and all those song had to come out and said that they wouldn't want to go back to living that way who is to decide that that's the way that they should look there's a fair you isolationist Republican but you bring up the point of of this these villages in this local government and speaking of it taking a village my second cousin twice removed Hillary Clinton now says she is convinced that Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to defeat her on the release day of her new book presumably a terrible book what happened amber what do we even mean by collusion at this point what is that what does that even imply well it's not even a legal term what it means is that members of the Trump administration allegedly were in some kind of contact with the Russian government to sway the election against Hillary Clinton but let's be honest this is just another blame game from Hillary she's done this time and time again she's blamed everything from Bernie Sanders to sexism to white nationalists the list goes on and on and on of course it's very convenient for her to say that she is convinced that Trump has polluted with the Russians it's just another part of her blame game narratives Jessie Hillary's approval rating is lower than Donald Trump's it's according to an NBC News poll recently it's at 30% the lowest ever recorded for her is she trying to rehab her image with this book tour and is that will that work well unfortunately you know I hate to say it but I'm pretty sure she's too old to really make anything of her political career but why do you think she's trying for say never jesse is about the salvage I'm praying that she does nothing further with her political career but I do think she's trying to salvage the Democrats and try to really put more of the blame on on Donald Trump and again she falls in the class of sore losers I would also say who cares if the people in the Trump administration of our trauma team campaign team didn't work with Russians to get information which proved that Hillary Clinton was a slimy blur when criminal and just brought it out to the American people the allegations they just talked about or what's in the documents they just talked about how they were gotten but you know this does not shine a very nice light on Hillary Clinton it's it's all been acknowledged that wasn't illegal even if they do find that they were colluding that some people from the campaign we're colluding with Russia or attorneys or people from from the Russian government but again they literally just proved that Hillary Clinton was not fit to serve as our president just absolutely a deplorable her career her entire career was deplorable and the fact that she made it so far is horrendous and you know I don't think that they did anything wrong if they did we've used really sleek tactics to try to get information on our opponents when we work with it's a diplomatic allure to say that it's the nature of the beast like you do and and I think that the ends justify the means in this case as long as the the means we're not illegal and it as long as long as the ends is getting Hillary Clinton as far away from the Oval Office as possible Amanda a book is currently number one on Amazon though it's only been a few hours what sort of person is ever gonna buy this drivel no one's gonna read the book right they're just gonna put it on their bookshelves in virtue signal I think I think maybe it's like a lot of conservative journalists spike it up right now I actually disagree I would love for Hillary to stay in politics as long as possible she is terrible she's hurting the brand I want her to run forever I wish her the best of hell yeah so I think it's bright now there's conservatives buying the book and just laughing at her and promoting the heck out of it and then we'll see and also I would like to bet that there's like a stack of these books and Hillary's you know mansions or Chelsea's apartment you know so that's true Bubba has to step over them on his way to the humidor absolutely right you bring up a great point run Hillary run panel of deplorable thank you so much for being here Daily Caller zambra a daily wires Amanda presto Giacomo and my buddy the local mayor Jesse Dwyer now it's time for the final thought political analysts are like sports commentators they only focus on the major leagues and they keep showing up to work no matter how many times their predictions turn out to be wrong now these two character traits are related most Talking Heads have never passed out pom cards to commuters at a train station or sat through a summer of spaghetti dinners at the VFW hall instead they attend cocktail parties with their fellow political media and donor class elite and that's all well and good I like cocktail parties they've read all of the philosophic and social scientific literature they've the numbers and they devour every myopic op EDM who have even less perspective on the voting populace than they themselves now those data points are not without value but all politics is particular politics comprises particulars effected through particular people caused by particular issues there is a significant a substantial group of voters that cannot be reached by opinion polls Richard Nixon called them the silent majority george w bush called them Values Voters and Hillary Clinton called them deplorable 's far-distant elites cannot pin them down and yet they often decide American elections god bless america I'm Michael Knowles is the Michael Nolt show come back tomorrow we'll do it all again
