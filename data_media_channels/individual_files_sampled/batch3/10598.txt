while hundreds of people have been protesting in the Spanish capital against violence towards migrants and refugees coming to the country the outcry was sparked by the government's decision to temporarily house newcomers in a jail in Malaga protesters demanded the closure of the prison holding banners reading no detention centers no borders just over a week ago one migrant was found dead in his cell at the site now some media outlets reported the death as suspicious the Spanish police however say the man hanged himself in his cell while his relatives alleged that police brutality in the prison is more likely the cause of his death now the Algerian migrants death added to the controversy surrounding the use of the prison as a refugee processing centre the Spanish authorities say they have resorted to using it only as an exceptional and temporary measure they also stressed that the facility is brand new and has never been used as a prison but local activists insist that a place like this should never be considered as a refugee camp like I feel no it is not even acceptable to hold prisoners there as there's no drinking water yet the government has used this prison for 578 male migrants from Algeria since November this is totally illegal first a Spanish state is prohibited from holding migrants in a prison second the conditions under which the migrants live are illegal they are guarded by riot police and have been unable to see their relatives we're not given any clothes for the first few weeks some have defended the Spanish government's argument that there simply isn't enough space to house all the new arrivals however the mayor of Archy Donna the town where the jail is located says that's no excuse we do not agree with the Spanish government's unilateral decision to house almost 600 immigrants in the prison they're not criminals and more appropriate accommodation could be found but it's not just one Spanish region that has been facing difficulties with the migrant influx a recent figures show that more than 20,000 refugees have crossed into Spain via the Mediterranean in just the past year that is more than double the number of 2016 and we spoke to Maria hey-zeus Vega from the UN Human Rights Council in Spain and she compares the Spanish crisis to similar cases in other European countries but still claims authorities can do more UNHCR has been always saying that refugees and asylum seekers should not be kept in in detention Archy Dona is just the top of the iceberg of a situation that is not properly handled and a situation that has been under a high level of improvisation for a long time the figures in 2017 have increased over 100 percent compared to the previous years but still we are talking about really manageable numbers there is no more than 27,000 people written in one year when in the past we've seen freeze with 1 million or Italy receiving over 100,000 people on a yearly basis so we therefore believe that Spain should and could be doing much more in this regard
