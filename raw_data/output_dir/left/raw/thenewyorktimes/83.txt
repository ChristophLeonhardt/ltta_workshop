1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,800
Hey, this is Jon
M. Chu, director

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,969
of “Crazy Rich Asians."

3
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,650
And this is in the beginning
of the movie, where

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,024
we get to meet
Rachel Chu, played

5
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,400
by the incredible
Constance Wu,

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,730
and Nick Young, played
by Henry Golding, who,

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,620
this is his first movie.

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,660
We found him from our
accountant in Malaysia.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,481
He was a travel host there.

10
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,730
Never done a movie before,
so this is his first movie.

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,470
This is his second
day shooting.

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,840
And he really improved
every day he was there.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,860
He’s an incredible actor,
actually, and super natural.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,372
And you’re going
to see him a lot.

15
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,830
And he plays the
lead in our movie.

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,100
And here, he’s inviting her to
Singapore to meet his family.

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,950
What she doesn’t know
is that his family

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,780
is the richest in Singapore.

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,540
And so she’s about to fly into
a hornet’s nest, as they say.

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
This is a very popular
section in the book.

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,410
In our script, it’s
about two sentences.

22
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,080
So we had to design
from the ground up.

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,260
But in the book, they talk
about how all the gossip

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,120
spreads through Radio 1 Asia.

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,240
And you can see
her slyly taking

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,620
a cell phone pic there.

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,290
And she’s going to pass
it on to all the friends,

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,870
socialites, ex-girlfriends,
family members

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,950
to destroy this American girl
coming to Singapore to take

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,539
their man.

31
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,580
How did we communicate
this stuff is through text

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,900
message and social media.

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,130
And there’s so much and so
many ways you can do it.

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,510
We really didn’t want to
shoot people’s screens.

35
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,880
So we tried to come up
with the most buoyant way

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,640
that even the book describes
of how information passes.

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,330
So we had these wispy,
colorful things,

38
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,030
sort of in the colors
of the book covers,

39
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,940
that spread through all the
people throughout Singapore.

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,330
And we had a great
company, Aspect Ratio,

41
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,080
to help design it.

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,660
There’s my baby in
the second there,

43
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,770
screaming “no," that was
born about two weeks after we

44
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,210
finished shooting.

45
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,682
And then we really
wanted to show

46
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:58,140
that this information
was spreading

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,300
all around the
world and ending up

48
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,320
at this beautiful home,
during this Bible study, where

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
we meet Michelle Yeoh, who
plays Nick Young’s mother

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,750
and wants nothing to do with
this American girl coming

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,170
to Singapore, which is very
relatable to my experience

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,450
as an Asian-American going
to Asia for the first time,

53
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,220
where it feels sort of like
home but not like home.

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,610
And that’s really what our
movie is about is this dual

55
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,830
cultural identity that
we all go through,

56
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,980
especially in this
generation of no matter where

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,380
you’re from — whether
you’re Asian or not —

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,340
everyone’s figuring out who
we want to be for the future.

59
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,450
And so text messaging
is a great way

60
00:02:42,450 --> 00:00:00,000
to show all the ways
that those things spread.
