>>  BOOOO.

9
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:30,032
PRESIDENT TRUMP: YOU, NOT ME,

YOU LAST NIGHT, YOU SAW IT.

11
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:38,207
KIM JONG-UN DID A GREAT SERVICE

12
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:40,877
TO HIMSELF, TO HIS COUNTRY BY

13
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:43,546
DOING THIS, BUT THOSE HOSTAGES

14
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,082
CAME OUT WITH RESPECT, WE DIDN'T

15
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:48,784
PAY FOR THEM.

16
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:49,585
STEVE: JUST SOMETHING THE

17
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:50,786
PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST

GOOD MORNING.

24
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:02,098
AINSLEY: HE DID SOMETHING THAT

25
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:03,099
PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD NEVER DO

26
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,934
HE BROUGHT HOME OUR HOSTAGES FOR

27
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:05,233
FREE.

28
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,303
>>  WELL YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT

29
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:08,137
IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

30
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:10,473
YOU KNOW, OBAMA PAID BILLIONS

31
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:12,308
FOR HOSTAGES.

32
00:01:12,308 --> 00:01:15,378
HE TRADED OFF TERRORIST FOR

33
00:01:15,378 --> 00:01:16,112
AMERICAN HOSTAGES BUT PRESIDENT

34
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:17,246
TRUMP DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

35
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:18,748
YOU KNOW, OBAMA I KNOW HE'S

36
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,283
UPSET BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT HIS

37
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,584
LEGACY IS BEING TARNISHED BUT

38
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,452
HIS LEGACY DIDN'T HAVE A LEG TO

39
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:23,853
STAND ON.

40
00:01:23,853 --> 00:01:24,787
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

41
00:01:24,787 --> 00:01:27,423
>>  PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T BACK

42
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,559
DOWN AND MINCE HIS WORDS

43
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,693
AND WE HAVE AMERICANS BACK ON

44
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:32,028
OUR SOIL WHERE THEY BELONG.

45
00:01:32,028 --> 00:01:33,629
PETE: WHY DO YOU BOTH FEEL LIKE

46
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,498
THEY WON'T, SOME OF THE LAST OF

47
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,600
THE SO-CALLED MAINSTREAM MEDIA

48
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,669
STILL WON'T GIVE HIM ANY CREDIT

49
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:41,037
THEY'RE SAYING THIS APPROACH IN

50
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:42,505
NORTH KOREA ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

51
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:43,639
WHY WON'T THEY EVER DO THAT?

52
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,074
>>  BECAUSE THEY'RE JEALOUS,

53
00:01:45,074 --> 00:01:47,109
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ABLE TO DO

54
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:48,244
BETWEEN 16 TO 18 MONTHS WHAT

55
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:49,445
OBAMA COULD NOT DO IN EIGHT

56
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:49,745
YEARS.

57
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:50,780
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

58
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,214
THAT'S WHY THEY WON'T GIVE HIM

59
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:52,548
CREDIT.

60
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:53,583
LISTEN THIS PRESIDENT IS NOT TO

61
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,750
BE PLAYED WITH.

62
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,919
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN WE

63
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,020
CALL HIM PRESIDENT DONALD J.

64
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,455
TRUMP AND HE IS NOT PLAYING.

65
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:00,990
HE'S GOING TO GET THE JOB DONALD

66
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,191
THEY ARE JEALOUS BECAUSE THEY

67
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:02,925
COULD NEVER DO THAT.

68
00:02:02,925 --> 00:02:04,860
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

69
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,262
STEVE: WELL LADIES YOU'RE DOWN

70
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:07,396

FOR GINA HAS PEOPLE TO BE THE

73
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,301
NEXT CIA DIRECTOR, THE WHOLE

74
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,437
CONVERSATION HAS TURNED TO

75
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:16,505
ENHANCED INTERROGATION AND WATER

76
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:17,306
BOARDING WHICH NOW THE

77
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,541

78
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,743
LISTEN TO THIS HERE IS WHOOPIE

79
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,012

WITH THE PLAN.

81
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,116
>>  REMEMBER HOW THE GENTLEMAN

82
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:28,351
IN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT

83
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,785
TORTURE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?

84
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,287
WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY IS I WOULD

85
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:32,955
LIKE YOU TO TRY IT.

86
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:34,824
I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

87
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,525
BEEN TORTURED, WHO ARE SAYING

88
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:38,227
THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU

89
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:39,395
SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM BECAUSE

90
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,465
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED AND

91
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,966

WHOOPIE GOLDBERG TRY IT?

95
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,171
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

96
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,873
>>  SHE NEEDS TO TRY RESPECTING

97
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:51,641
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

98
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,242
STATES IS WHAT SHE NEEDS TO TRY

99
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:53,843
TO DO.

100
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:54,543
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

101
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:56,078
STATES IS NOT A TERRORIST.

102
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,113
HE'S AN AMERICAN.

103
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,447
HE'S OUR PRESIDENT, SO WHY WOULD

104
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:00,116
WE WATERBOARD HIM?

105
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:02,118

00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,198
YOU SHOULD BE CHAMPIONING AROUND

113
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,500
THIS WOMAN THAT GETS THIS HIGH

114
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,968
POSITION IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE

115
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:19,268
DOING.

116
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:20,936
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

117
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:21,904
STEVE: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT

118
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,407
ABOUT THE GARDEN STATE, PETE AND

119
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:25,574
I LIVE THERE AND NOW LADIES AS

120
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:27,610
IT TURNS OUT WE ARE SUBSIDIZING

121
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,944
THINGS FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS

122
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:30,346
BECAUSE THE GARDEN STATE IS NOW

123
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:34,216
ALLOWING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS TO

124
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:36,986
APPLY FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID AT

125
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:39,555
THE UNIVERSITIES AND HERE IS THE

126
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:40,656
BEST PART, FOR INSTANCE AT

127
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:42,191
RUTGERS WHICH IS JUST ACROSS THE

128
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,392
RIVER FROM WHERE WE'RE SITTING

129
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,095
DOWN A COUPLE MILES, ILLEGALS

130
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:48,431
CAN QUALIFY FOR IN-STATE TUITION

131
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,966
NOT IN THE COUNTRY, BUT THEY GET

132
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:51,467
IN-STATE TUITION.

133
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:52,835
>>  YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S

134
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:53,335
VERY SAD.

135
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:54,036
>>  VERY.

136
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:56,172
AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THIS,

137
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:56,972
AMERICANS TAX DOLLARS.

138
00:03:56,972 --> 00:03:58,507
WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN STUDENTS

139
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,642
WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT

140
00:03:59,642 --> 00:04:01,577
GO TO SCHOOL THAT HAVE TO PAY

141
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:04,113
STUDENT LOANS UNTIL THEY ARE

142
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,347
ABOUT 60 YEARS OLD?

143
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:06,482
YES, WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO CROSS

144
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:08,718
OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY AND NOW WE

145
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,953
GIVE THEM HAND-OUTS LIKE GRANTS

146
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,288
JUST TO GO TO COLLEGE?

147
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:13,589
WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE I

148
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,157
THINK IT'S SAD, I THINK IT'S

149
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:16,257
SICK, I THINK EVERY AMERICAN

150
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,728
THAT GOES FOR COLLEGE SHOULD BE

151
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,095
OUTRAGED.

152
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,262
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.

153
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,031
AND THEY COMMITTED THEIR FIRST

154
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,332
CRIME WHENEVER THEY CROSSED THAT

155
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,433
BORDER ILLEGALLY WHEN AN

156
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,068
AMERICAN CITIZEN DO SOMETHING

157
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:29,972
ILLEGALLY, THEY ARE GIVEN THREE

158
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,474
BEHIND A LOCKED CELL BLOCK, NOT

159
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:32,575
NO FUNDING.

160
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,243
STEVE: LADIES WHAT ARE YOU DOING

161
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:34,877
IN WASHINGTON TODAY?

162
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:36,479
>>  OH, WE WAS IN WASHINGTON FOR

163
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,348
AN EVENT LAST NIGHT WITH SARAH

164
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:39,648
PALIN.

165
00:04:39,648 --> 00:00:00,000
>>  IT WAS AMAZING.
