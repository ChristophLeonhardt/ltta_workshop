AS YOU CAN SEE, THE RAIN HAS BEEN COMING DOWN RELENTLESSLY.

16
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:28,128
BEEN COMING DOWN RELENTLESSLY. I’M ACTUALLY STANDING ON A ROAD,

17
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:30,564
I’M ACTUALLY STANDING ON A ROAD, A ROAD THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY

18
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:33,133
A ROAD THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY WASHED AWAY AND CLOSED.

19
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,234
WASHED AWAY AND CLOSED. TAKE A LOOK HERE.

00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:36,203
TAKE A LOOK HERE. THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT IS

21
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:37,437
THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT IS BEING COMING THROUGH AND THE

22
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,705
BEING COMING THROUGH AND THE POWER OF THIS WATER, IT’S

23
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,009
POWER OF THIS WATER, IT’S ACTUALLY TURNED THIS ROAD INTO A

24
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,309
ACTUALLY TURNED THIS ROAD INTO A RIVER.

25
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,844
RIVER. IT IS NOT STOPPED RAINING HERE.

26
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,612
IT IS NOT STOPPED RAINING HERE. WE’RE IN CONWAY, WHICH IS ABOUT

27
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,247
WE’RE IN CONWAY, WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MIMES INLAND.

28
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:48,448

SOME ROADS WASHED AWAY. AND THIS RAIN IS RELENTLESS,

33
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,257
AND THIS RAIN IS RELENTLESS, WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM.

34
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,126
WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM. THEY’RE SAYING ONE OF THEIR

35
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,761
THEY’RE SAYING ONE OF THEIR MAJOR CONCERNS IS THAT THE THREE

36
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,664
MAJOR CONCERNS IS THAT THE THREE MAIN RIVERS IN THIS COUNTY WILL

37
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:03,964
MAIN RIVERS IN THIS COUNTY WILL CREST.

38
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,799
CREST. AND IF THAT HAPPENS, IT WILL

39
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,167
AND IF THAT HAPPENS, IT WILL WASH OUT THE MAIN ROAD IN AND

40
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:08,135
WASH OUT THE MAIN ROAD IN AND OUT OF MYRTLE BEACH.

41

OUT OF MYRTLE BEACH. WE SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR A SHORT

00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:10,871
WE SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR A SHORT WHILE AGO.

43
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,740
WHILE AGO. HER BIG CONCERN IS THAT IF IT

44
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,541
HER BIG CONCERN IS THAT IF IT WASHES OUT THE MAIN ROAD, THE

45
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:15,876
WASHES OUT THE MAIN ROAD, THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE IN MYRTLE

46
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:17,478
RESIDENTS THAT ARE IN MYRTLE BEACH RIGHT NOW WON’T BE ABLE TO

47
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:17,778
BEACH RIGHT NOW WON’T BE ABLE TO LEAVE.

48
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,647
LEAVE. THE RESIDENTS THAT EVACUATED,

49
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,248
THE RESIDENTS THAT EVACUATED, WHICH IS ABOUT 60% OF THE

50
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:22,283
WHICH IS ABOUT 60% OF THE COUNTY, THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO

51
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,317
COUNTY, THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN.

52
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,485
GET BACK IN. SO, THEY’RE DEFINITELY KEEPING

53
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,453
SO, THEY’RE DEFINITELY KEEPING AN EYE ON THAT.

54
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:26,787
AN EYE ON THAT. THEY’RE WORRIED THIS COULD

55
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:27,988
THEY’RE WORRIED THIS COULD HAPPEN IN THE NEXT THREE TO

56
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:28,789
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT THREE TO SEVEN DAYS.

57
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,157
SEVEN DAYS. DAVID, I’M GOING TO TOSS IT BACK

58
00:01:30,192 --> 00:00:00,000
