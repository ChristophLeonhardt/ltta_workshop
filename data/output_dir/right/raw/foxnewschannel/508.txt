1
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:07,895
>>> YOU KNOW, WE HEAR FROM THE

2
00:00:07,895 --> 00:00:08,896
WITNESSES.

3
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:10,164
BUT THE F.B.I. ISN'T

4
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,198
INTERVIEWING THEM.

5
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,267
AND ISN'T GIVING US ANY FACTS.

6
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:14,635
SO, ALL WE HAVE --

7
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,672
>> YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME.

8
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:18,873
YOU'RE INTERVIEWING ME.

9
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:20,274
YOU'RE DOING IT, SENATOR.

10
00:00:20,274 --> 00:00:21,275
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

11
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:21,876
YOU'RE DOING IT.

12
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:24,145
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIONS

13
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:24,578
REACHED.

14
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:25,946
>> Tucker: THAT WAS

15
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:27,948
KAVANAUGH RESPONDING TO

16
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:28,916
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN OF

17
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,685
CALIFORNIA IN TODAY'S HEARING.

18
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:32,619
WE SPOKE TO RETIRED PROFESSOR

19
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,055
ALAN DERSHOWITZ AHEAD OF THE

20
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:34,422
HEARING.

21
00:00:34,422 --> 00:00:36,257
NOW THAT IT IS OVER WHAT DID

22
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:37,625
HE THINK THE OUTCOME?

23
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,693
ALAN DERSHOWITZ ALSO THE

24
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:40,761
AUTHOR OF "THE CASE AGAINST

25
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,865
IMPEACHING TRUMP."

26
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,600
AND HE HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,701
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

28
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,970
YOU WATCHED THE HEARING FROM

29
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:49,804
BEGINNING TO END.

30
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:51,272
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT?

31
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:54,408
>> I WATCHED HER AND I THOUGHT

32
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:56,344
SHE WAS EXTREMELY CREDIBLE AND

33
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,446
I HAD GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER HE

34
00:00:58,446 --> 00:00:59,947
COULD WIN THE CREDIBILITY

35
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:00,281
CONTEST.

36
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:02,049
BUT HE MADE A REMARKABLE

37
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,352
COMEBACK AND HE REALLY

38
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:07,355
TESTIFIED IN A COMPLETELY

39
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,290
COMPELLING MANNER.

40
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,492
SO I THINK IN THE END THERE IS

41
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,060
A TIE WHEN IT COMES TO

42
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,995
PERSONAL CREDIBILITY.

43
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:15,796
SO HOW DO YOU BREAK THE TIE?

44
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:18,933
I THINK ONE WAY IS TO LOOK FOR

45
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:19,367
CORROBORATION.

46
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,736
AND HE HAS MUCH MORE

47
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:23,671
CORROBORATION ON HIS SIDE.

48
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,575
NOW THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE

49
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:28,709
THAT CORROBORATION IS ACCURATE

50
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,511
IS FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CALL

51
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,680
THE OTHER WITNESSES.

52
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,448
AND LET THE F.B.I. CONTINUE

53
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:35,917
ITS BACKGROUND CHECK.

54
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,452
AND I THINK IN THE END, IT

55
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:42,557
WILL DO HIM MORE GOOD THAN

56
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:42,957
HARM.

57
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,692
>> Tucker: NOW WHEN WE SPOKE

58
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:45,760
YESTERDAY, YOU SAID THAT YOU

59
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,361
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

60
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:50,965
CHOICE OF RACHEL MITCHELL FROM

61
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:51,966
MARICOPA COUNTY SEX CRIMES

62
00:01:51,966 --> 00:01:52,600
INVESTIGATION OFFICE IN

63
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,402
ARIZONA TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF

64
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,070
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IF THEY

65
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,904
QUESTION CHRSTINE BLASEY FORD.

66
00:01:56,904 --> 00:01:58,506
YOUR POINT -- WELL, WE HAVE A

67
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,273
CLIP.

68
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:01,209
I'LL SHOW YOU YOUR POINT.

69
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:01,642
>> SURE.

70
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:04,078
>> I SEE THE GREATEST ENGINE

71
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,282
OF TRUTH EVER INVENTED USED

72
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:10,084
EFFECTIVELY, CROSS

73
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:10,485
EXAMINATION.

74
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:11,719
I WORRY WE DON'T HAVE THE

75
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,153
RIGHT PEOPLE.

76
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,922
THE WOMAN HIRED TO CONDUCT THE

77
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,357
CROSS EXAMINATION PROBABLY

78
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:17,392
RARELY EVER CROSS EXAMINED

79
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:17,759
ANYBODY.

80
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:18,559
SHE IS A PROSECUTOR.

81
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,862
I DON'T THINK SHE IS THE RIGHT

82
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:25,633
PERSON WHO QUESTION DR. FORD.

83
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,937
>> Tucker: YOU KNOW YOU WERE

84
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:29,304
RIGHT.

85
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:30,505
>> I WAS CRITICIZED FOR MAKING

86
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:32,173
THAT POINT I TURNED OUT TO BE

87
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:32,874
100% RIGHT.

88
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:36,077
SHE WAS TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY

89
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:40,415
INCOMPETENT IN TERMS OF ASKING

90
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,216
CROSS EXAMINATION QUESTIONS.

91
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,118
SHE HAS LITTLE EXPERIENCE.

92
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,620
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAIN ISSUE

93
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,089
NOW IS WHETHER OR NOT SHE

94
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,257
RECOGNIZED KAVANAUGH

95
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:49,791
CORRECTLY.

96
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,427
SHE WAS NEVER ASKED WHETHER

97
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:53,828
HOW WELL SHE KNEW HIM, HOW

98
00:02:53,828 --> 00:02:56,364
MANY TIMES SHE ENCOUNTERED HIM

99
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:57,465
BEFORE THIS.

100
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,334
HOW CLOSE WAS THEIR

101
00:02:59,334 --> 00:02:59,768
RELATIONSHIP?

102
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,370
THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD

103
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,605
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

104
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:05,173
EVEN IF SHE BELIEVES SHE IS

105
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:07,676
TELLING THE TRUTH, SHE MAY

106
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:09,177
HAVE MISIDENTIFIED.

107
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:11,446
SO SHE JUST DID A TERRIBLE

108
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:11,880
JOB.

109
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,282
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS

110
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,417
REALIZED THAT AND THEY CANNED

111
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:16,685
HER IN THE MIDDLE.

112
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,954
BUT IT WAS A VERY BAD CHOICE.

113
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:21,523
>> Tucker: SO CAN I -- THOSE

114
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:24,059
OF US WHO ASK QUESTIONS FOR A

115
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:26,228
LIVING SAT AND WONDERED WHAT

116
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:27,195
IS THE POINT OF THIS.

117
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:28,630
NOT THAT SHE IS A BAD PERSON

118
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,564
OR STUPID.

119
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,966
YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND

120
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,566
CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY

121
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:31,900
BEFORE.

122
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,802
YOU HAVE TESTIFIED.

123
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,004
WHEN YOU WERE ASKING QUESTIONS

124
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,839
OF A WITNESS, AREN'T YOU DOING

125
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,142
SO IN ORDER TO PROVE A POINT,

126
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:42,010
TELL A STORY, YOU'RE DOING IT

127
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,845
FOR SOME REASON, AREN'T YOU?

128
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,014
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE A THEORY.

129
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:47,716
EVERY QUESTION HAS TO BE PART

130
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,484
OF A TACTIC.

131
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:51,119
YOU ASK QUESTION "A" IN ORDER

132
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,255
TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR "B."

133
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:56,158
SHE WAS JUST ASKING QUESTIONS.

134
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:57,659
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO GO

135
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,026
ANYWHERE.

136
00:03:58,026 --> 00:03:59,761
SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A

137
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:00,095
POINT.

138
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:02,097
AND IN THE END, SHE

139
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:03,331
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING.

140
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:04,266
>> Tucker: BRETT KAVANAUGH

141
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:04,900
DEFENDED HIMSELF.

142
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,700
NOBODY ELSE WAS.

143
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,635
OTHER THAN LINDSEY GRAHAM.

144
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:07,769
THANK YOU.

145
00:04:07,769 --> 00:00:00,000
PROFESSOR, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
