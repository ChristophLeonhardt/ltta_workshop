1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,720
Quite often, I've been driving down some highway
and I'll see a road that

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,640
juts off of that highway

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,660
and wondered where does that road go?

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,300
Travel is extremely important.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,680
It's not a luxury.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,840
It's a necessity.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,700
I feel getting out into the middle of nowhere
helps you recharge.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,460
My name is Britton Purser.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,640
I own a company called Vintage Overland.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,100
We build teardrop camp trailers.

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,380
We, being my two younger brothers and myself.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,620
And we are located in Grand Junction, Colorado.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,140
This is Britton's business.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,680
This is his idea.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,720
This is his product that he's come up with.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,100
He started getting phone calls.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,840
A lot.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,299
I have a long-standing, crazy love for these
vintage trailers.

19
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,380
I just love them.

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,479
It felt like in the realm of destiny.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,060
Like I got to go do this.

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,500
Teardrops were first introduced after World War Two.

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,150
The reasons they have the materials that they
use: the jeep wheels,

24
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,840
the aluminum, things of that nature,

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,660
is quite simply they were using army surplus.

26
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,159
Between the three of us, we've done it all.

27
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,479
All the trades.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,700
Carpentry, tile work, sheet rock, electric,
plumbing, you know all of that, cabinetry.

29
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,720
Phase one is the woodworking phase.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,200
So we put the pattern down on here.

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,220
And, we've traced our lines.

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,460
And I cut it rough with the jigsaw.

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,200
Very imprecise.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm just getting most of the material out
of the way.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,840
And now I'm going to put the pattern, clamp
the pattern back on here.

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,380
And I'm going to rout out to a finer degree
with the router against our pattern

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,920
to make it more precise and smooth.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,120
What I'm doing right now is building what
we call the H frame.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,720
It's really the spine of the trailer.

40
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,740
In the shop it's mostly Cullen and me.

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,980
Britt doesn't have time.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,500
He's making phone calls and answering phone
calls and selling.

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,959
So we cut out the wood, finish everything.

44
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,060
Put the box together.

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,020
So now we have a wooden box.

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,420
A lot of people don't understand hand tools.

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,860
But they're absolutely the quickest to get
things done a lot of times.

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:37,799
I try to do the maximum amount of quality
with the bare minimum of tools.

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Building each caravan, it takes approximately
two weeks to assemble and finish.

50
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:52,840
The second step is, we insulate the box and
then we skin it with aluminum.

51
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,240
It's a soft aluminum, so we have to be very
careful in the shop.

52
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,496
We dent the side of the trailer, we got to

53
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,690
pull that piece of skin off and put a new 
 one back on.

54
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,590
So it's just learning to work very precisely
and carefully.

55
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,500
Cody's role in this has been to be an absolute
pain in the butt.

56
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Like, like never happy.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,798
It is never good enough.

58
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,139
Are you flush?

59
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,410
It's good.

60
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,410
OK.

61
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,660
If it was Britton and myself, they'd be pretty
neat, they'd be pretty nice, but with Cody

62
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,600
in the mix, they're unbelievably over the
top.

63
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,960
This just came back from the Powder Coater.

64
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,860
We put the completed box on a frame.

65
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,640
Then we jack that frame up and put the wheels
on.

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:01,120
Cullen starts making the side doors and then
we work on the rear hatch door.

67
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,640
After that, it's finishing details.

68
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,080
I get inside and we put in some trim.

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,350
Add the switches.

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,870
And I just test the lights.

71
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,870
Dome lights.

72
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,870
Beautiful.

73
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,870
Test the fan.

74
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,870
Beautiful.

75
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,760
All three speeds.

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,140
And we put in a slide-out table.

77
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,600
And then after that, we peel all the protective
plastic off the aluminum.

78
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,500
We have to be very careful because these knives
will scratch the surface.

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,910
Put on the decals.

80
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,020
Just lightly put it in place.

81
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,140
And then peel off this real slow.

82
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,550
And the very last step is to put the hub caps on.

83
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,520
Because they're chrome, we want there to be
no scratches.

84
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,750
And we just put them on and it goes pop.

85
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,770
That's a sense of relief.

86
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,940
And now we can get on to the next one.

87
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,000
What I envision, is you take that caravan
and not with a new vehicle.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,410
You take it with an old vehicle.

89
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,340
You take it with an old Jeep, you take it
with an old Land Rover.

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,360
Our caravans are built to be taken off road.

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,120
It takes you to areas that not everyone can
get to.

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,500
The thing about these trailers is not what
they are, but what they aren't.

93
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,300
They are not an RV.

94
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:53,400
These are symbols of simplicity; they're symbols
of sanctuary, of solitude.

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,660
You get inside them, and I don't know if it's
the feeling of a womb,

96
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,280
but the roundness inside and the warmth of wood...

97
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,440
They're a retreat that goes with you.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,280
The whole goal is for someone who purchases
a caravan from us, not to go somewhere.

99
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,890
That's not the point.

100
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,830
The point is to go nowhere.

101
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,560
You are in the middle of nowhere.

102
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,750
You go out and you camp.

103
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,120
And you look at a fire.

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
And you realize that all that matters is food
in your belly, warmth, protection.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,190
And it's just good to go remember that.

106
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,540
And then you go back
into the nonsense and it doesn't threaten

107
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,220
you quite as much.

108
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,340
It's freedom versus security.

109
00:07:47,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and we choose freedom.
