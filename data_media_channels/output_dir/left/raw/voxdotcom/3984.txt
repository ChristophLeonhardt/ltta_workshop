1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,830
When you think of styles of hip hop, braggadocio,
gangsta, and conscious hip hop might come

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,119
to mind. But what about Art Rap?

3
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,620
Art rap is a style of hip-hop that Open Mike
Eagle has embraced throughout his entire career

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,930
The first thing you need to know about Mike
to understand his style of rap is this: he

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,590
loves the band They Might Be Giants

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,240
I will talk about them all day. All day!

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,460
They Might Be Giants is a weirdo art-rock
band from Brooklyn formed in 1982.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,140
They’ve released 19 studio albums including
a handful for kids.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,960
Mike Eagle II is a hip hop artist born in
1980. He’s from the South-Side of Chicago.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,170
I went to school in the projects and that
wasn’t always an easy conversation to have

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,500
with people. I used to lie about it a lot.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,449
When Mike was about 9 years old he heard Birdhouse
in Your Soul for the first time.

13
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,050
Musically that song is just thrilling to me.

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,940
“Birdhouse in your Soul” is a song about
a night light. It changes keys 18 times in

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,000
3 minutes.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,829
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you Make a little birdhouse

17
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,700
in your soul

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:15,030
If you ever listen to their songs. The feeling
of their songs is very happy, jovial, high

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,250
energy. But if you ever read the lyrics they
say some fucked up shit.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,200
One of Mike’s favorite verses comes from
“Where Your Eyes Don’t Go”

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,070
Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow
waves its broomstick arms

22
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,210
And does a parody of each unconscious thing
you do When you turn around to look it's gone

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,530
behind you On its face it's wearing your confused
expression

24
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,610
Where your eyes don't go

25
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,030
That to me that’s just like that’s just
perfect.

26
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,620
Mike’s childhood obsession with They Might
Be Giants can really be felt in his music.

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,860
My antenna span's killin'
I'm all full of data like a Spiderman villain

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,940
I'm part flesh and part energy
The last text I sent you was from the heart

29
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,320
literally

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,960
I was inducted into the hip-hop tradition
in the South Side of Chicago. And what that

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,050
meant was the style in this time space was
this punchline style.

32
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,650
We got Juice from Chicago in here.
Cause I mack right I track light like photosynthesis.

33
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,880
Rappers is wack as hell and I'm gonna put
it in parenthesis. No pause or comma cause

34
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,950
I'm gonna keep you fearing this. You got a
question mark I'm the n**ga here period.

35
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,080
Mike has turned the whimsical and dark style
of They Might be Giants and the punchline-y

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,030
style of Chicago hip hop into a really special
style of rap.

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,310
On his latest album he’s managed to turn
really serious topics like addiction and racism

38
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,300
into pointed and humorous verses.

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:50,180
Today I saw a lady say hi to a stranger / Then
avoid my eyes like I'm a white-person strangler

40
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,820
/ Walking past voters in a democratic blocks
that hit / The windows and the automatic locks

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,030
if not / Reparations give me free black therapy
/ And tell people you're scared of them it

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,190
makes them act scarily

43
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,510
A lot of these ideas and premises they came
from these really vulnerable places. So if

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:11,710
I say something heavy in a way that makes
me chuckle then it makes me feel better about

45
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,560
it.

46
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,760
The final song I’ll leave you with is haunting
and beautiful. The beat is uplifting, the

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,770
lyrics are dark.

48
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,360
We've gone too far
We don't want to go back home

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,260
We don't like to see each other but
We don't want to go back home

50
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,630
It’s about this group of people who go to
a dive bar because they don’t want to go

51
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,900
back home. It runs counter to the idea of
a support group because typically that’s

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,360
about people trying to be sober.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:47,300
Ma I"m done I call up the homie
I borrow his gun, I'm not gonna run

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,630
I'm my father's son
I hold up the legacy

55
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,650
Macho, masculine all in my pedigree
Angry and cold

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:04,830
Bolder than tensile
Trying not to be overly sensitive

57
00:04:04,830 --> 00:00:00,000
Fail, fail, everyday, damn...
