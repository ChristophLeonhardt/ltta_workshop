Coal mining isn't coming back,
and it’s time to get
real about it.
I'm a fifth-generation coal
miner and a ninth-generation
Appalachian from Virginia.
I spent four years
in the coal industry.
The work was
dangerous and came
with a lot of long-term health
impacts.
We love our coal miners.
And they're not being mistreated anymore.
Miners are going back to work, folks.
Those are false
promises that are only
going to line the pockets
of coal executives
while delaying the inevitable.
If Trump really wants to
help Appalachian mining
communities that support him,
lowering emissions standards
is not the way to do it.
The industry has never been
on the side of the coal miner.
The coal companies
were quick to create
a culture around coal
mining, around the hard work
and patriotic duty and
sacrifice for families.
But they did it with a total
disregard for our safety.
We’re still having to fight
for things like black lung
benefits, workman’s
compensation and disability
from injuries in the mines.
You might think of Appalachia
as a very conservative place.
But in 2000, the majority of
Appalachia's coal-producing counties
voted for Al Gore.
Our families used to vote
Democrat for labor rights.
But economic desperation
has driven us to vote otherwise.
We’re defending ourselves
against liberal elite
stereotypes that
we're unintelligent deplorables.
And beautiful clean coal,
clean coal, really clean coal.
Coal cannot be clean.
We know that firsthand.
Acidic mine drainage is real.
It’s coming out of our
family spring.
Coal slurry impoundments are real.
They’re leaching into
our creeks, our rivers
and our lakes.
Miners don’t want to be told about
climate change.
But at some point,
we have to realize
that the environmental
impacts of the industry
aren’t a partisan
issue.
They're a matter of life and death.
We don’t need short-term
revivals of an industry that
has always mistreated us.
We need long-term investments
into our communities.
This is the only way to give
justice to the communities
who have sacrificed so
much to provide the energy
and steel that has
made this nation so great.
