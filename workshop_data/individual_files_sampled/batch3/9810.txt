Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE CALLING FOR CIVILITY AFTER STOPPING A CORRESPONDENT FROM ATTENDING AN OPEN EVENT WITH SHOUTED QUESTIONS AND REFUSED TO LEAVE DESPITE REPEATEDLY BEING DID MICHAEL COHEN BETRAY YOU, MR. PRESIDENT? COHEN BETRAY YOU? THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL WOE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MICHAEL WO WOE COHEN WILL SAY TO PROSECUTORS? ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE TAPES? THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU. WHY HAS VLADIMIR PUTIN NOT ACCEPTED YOUR INVITATION? THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. COME ON. LET'S GO. THANK YOU. WHY HAS VLADIMIR PUTIN NOT ACCEPTED YOUR INVITATION, Shepard: THE REPORTER YOU HEARD WAS KATELYN COLLINS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR CNN. SHE WAS THE POOL REPORTER AT THE TIME MEANING ON THAT DAY IN THAT SETTING, SHE REPRESENTED ALL OF A FEW HOURS LATER, SHE SAID WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD HER THE QUESTIONS WERE INAPPROPRIATE AND SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND THE PRESIDENT'S JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE ROSE GARDEN. THE PRESIDENT OF THIS STATEMENT QUOTING THE PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S ASSOCIATION ISSUED A STATEMENT. IT READS IN PART WRONG-HEADED AND WEAK. CHIEF OF STAFF FOR COMMUNICATIONS. BILL SHINE, FULL DISCLOSURE, IS MY PERSONAL FRIEND. HE WAS A PRODUCER, SENIOR EXECUTIVE IN THIS NETWORK AND IN THAT CAPACITY, HE WAS MY BOSS. DID YOU BAN HER? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, BILL? WHAT WORLD WOULD YOU USE? WHEN YOU ASKED HER IF WE USED THE WORD BAN, THEN I YOU ASKED HER FOCUS NOW. YOU ASKED HER IF WE EVER USED THIS IS A DIFFERENCE WITHOUT A DISTINCTION. COLLINS REPORT SHINE AND THE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS DISINVITED HER FROM A ROSE GARDEN EVENT. KELLYANNE CONWAY SHOWS THE WHOLE THING THE MEDIA NEEDS TO CHANGE ITS APPROACH. THAT YOU CALL FOR SOMETIMES IN YOUR BROADCAST, SHOULD START HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND SHOW MORE RESPECT. CIVILITY. CNN MAINTAINS THE CORRESPONDENCE ASSOCIATION AGREES AND WE AT FOX NEWS OBSERVED THAT COLLINS WAS CIVIL. THAT SHE ASKED RELEVANT AND TIMELY QUESTIONS OF A PRESIDENT THAT OFTEN ANSWERS QUESTIONS UNDER IDENTICAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN THE SAME SETTING. FOR A PERSPECTIVE A COUPLE DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS DON'T BELIEVE THE CRAP YOU SEE FROM THESE PEOPLE. THE FAKE NEWS. AND WHAT YOUR READING IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN CALLING MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA FAKE AND DISHONEST SINCE HE ANNOUNCED HE PRESIDENT HAS ADOPTED A NEW PHASE. THEY INTERVIEWED TEN WOMEN ON ONE OF THE OPPOSING NETWORKS, THE ENEMY. THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE I CALL THEM. THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE. THIS PROGRAM TO OFFER THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER. SHINE DECLINED WHILE THANKING ME FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. WE ALSO INVITED OUR COLLEAGUE, JORDAN FABIAN, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE HILL. WE ASKED HIM BECAUSE DURING A WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING LAST WEEK THIS HAPPENED. I'M GOING TO MOVE TO JORDAN. YOU TOLD THE PRESIDENT ONCE AGAIN, I'M MOVING TO HALLIE, GO AHEAD. THANKS ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO TAKE A QUESTION FROM JORDAN. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST? WELL, SHEP, I CAN TELL YOU, I KATELYN COLLINS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. COVER THE WHITE HOUSE. IT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS AND EVER WORKED. I HOPE IN THE FUTURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. LOOK, I MEAN, UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN DUST-UPS IN THE PAST. I REMEMBER THIS NETWORK WAS INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF SITUATION WITH THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHERE IT WASN'T Shepard: AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? THAT'S RIGHT. JAKE TAPPER OF CNN STEPPED IN TO BACK YOU GUYS UP AND SAID THAT WE WOULDN'T REALLY ATTEND THAT ROUND OF INTERVIEWS UNLESS FOX NEWS WAS INVITED. SO IN TIMES LIKE THIS, I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE PRESS CORPS TO UNITE AND REALLY RALLY AROUND ONE ANOTHER. I'M SEEING THAT HAPPEN AGAIN. I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST. Shepard: IN THAT CASE, IT HAPPENED AFTER A SERIES OF FOR ALL OF US, WAS WORKING FOR US AT FOX NEWS AND YOU AT HOME AT THAT MOMENT TRYING TO GET ANSWERS FROM THE PRESIDENT. SHE REPORTS THAT SHE WAS BROUGHT IN TO A OFFICE OF BILL SHINE. CAN YOU TELL US YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT EVENT? I WASN'T THERE FOR THE MEETING. THE FACT THAT THIS IS EVEN A PRESS CORPS. THE POOL IS VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S FOR ALL OF NEWS THE NEWS MEDIA BECAUSE THERE'S LIMITED SPACE TO HAVE EYES AND EARS WHAT'S GOING ON AT ALL TIMES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OR WHATEVER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEM TO TAKE ANY STEP TO RESTRICT THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE PRESS IS GOING TO STAND FOR. THE BACKGROUND REASON ON THAT IS THAT IF A PRESIDENT, ANY PRESIDENT, IS ALLOWED TO CALL ON THOSE THAT HAVE SEEN SEEMED FRIENDLY TO HIM OR ACCEPTABLE TO ANSWERS THAT MIGHT FLY IN THE FACE OF FACT, HAVING A PROCEDURE WHICH INCLUDES DISALLOWING THOSE THAT WOULD ASK QUESTIONS OF SUBSTANCE AND UNIVERSAL NOT FOR THE GREATER GOOD. RIGHT. LIKE YOU SAID, THE PRESIDENT IS FREE TO NOT ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. YESTERDAY WE SAW HIM ON TWO OCCASIONS NOT ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN OR RUSSIA. THAT'S TOTALLY PREROGATIVE. IT'S THE PRESS' JOB TO ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. ANY REPORTNER THAT SITUATION WOULD HAVE ASKED THE SAME OR SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO WHAT BACK THAT SHE WAS NOT BEING EVERY DAY. OFTEN THE PRESIDENT TAKES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER IF QUESTIONS, THIS IS PART OF OUR JOB. THANKS, JORDAN. THANK YOU. YOU TOO. Shepard: FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME, IF I MAY, JOURNALISTS ARE NOT THE ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE. IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE. OUR PROFESSION IS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THE FOURTH ESTATE HOLDS THE ESSENTIAL JOB OF BEING YOUR EYES AND OFTEN EARS AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, YOUR VOICE. IT'S A CORNERSTONE OF OUR REPUBLIC. OVER 22 YEARS AT THIS NETWORK, IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE COLLEAGUES AT COMPETITORS AT CNN AND MSNBC, NBC, ABC AND CBS, BLOOMBERG AND PBS, THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL," THE "NEW YORK POST," "THE WASHINGTON POST," ALL OF THEM OPERATE IN THE PUBLIC INTERESTS. WE WORK TO DISCERN WHAT IS TRUTH. THEN TO PRESENT IT TO YOU IN CONTEXT AND WITH PERSPECTIVE. AS YOUR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PEOPLE'S HALLS, REPORT TO YOU WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR WHILE THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WE DO. IT'S OUR REASON FOR BEING, OUR PURPOSE. PLEASE KNOW THIS. I ACKNOWLEDGE MANY THOUSANDS OF YOUR COMPLAINTS AND PROTESTATIONS AND IN DOING SO, I OFFER THIS. NEVER HAVE I PERSONALLY MISREPRESENTED THE TRUTH THOU. OUR REPORTS ARE CHECKED AND RECHECKED AT THE EDITORIAL IN THE EVENT I MAKE A MISTAKE AND I TELL YOU AND CORRECT IT IN A TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. AS AN ASIDE, WHEN THE PRESIDENT DISCOVER THE UNDERLYING REASON PURVEYORS OF TRUTH. WE ARE ON GUARD AND WE HOPE
