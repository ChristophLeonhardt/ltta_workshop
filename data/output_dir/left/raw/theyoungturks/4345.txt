1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,990
REINCE PRIEBUS, CHIEF OF
STAFF, YOU HAD HEARD RUMORS THAT

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,870
HE WAS GONE -- THEY ARE TRUE.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,180
HE
IS GONE.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,000
TRUMP HAS REPLACED HIM

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,070
WITH THE HOMELAND SECURITY
SECRETARY JOHN F.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,760
KELLY -- TAKEN AWAY, CENK.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,860
DOWN GOES PRIEBUS!

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,030
DOWN GOES
PRIEBUS!

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,030
I WOULD NORMALLY PLAY

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,190
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE GOT HIM,
BUT WE MOST CERTAINLY DIDN'T.

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,029
THEY GOT THEMSELVES.

12
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,020
I GOT A
GREAT IDEA, LET'S ALL GET IN A

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,910
CIRCLE -- LET'S USE A NICER
ANALOGY -- PUNCH EACH OTHER IN

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,910
THE FACE.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,600
THE MOOCH, SCARFACE,
CAME IN AND SAID WHAT IS GOING

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,649
ON WITH THIS PRIEBUS GUY?

17
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,330
THEN
WE HAD A GOOD QUESTION AS TO WHO

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,420
WAS GOING TO LEAVE, MOOCH OR
PRIEBUS, WE HAVE OUR ANSWER,

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,511
PRIEBUS IS GONE, I'M NO FAN OF
REINCE PRIEBUS AND I'M HAPPY TO

20
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:04,309
SEE THIS HAPPEN, BUT THE REALITY
IS THERE ARE NO WINNERS HERE.

21
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,290
AND MAYBE IN SOME IRONIC WAY
REINCE PRIEBUS MIGHT BE WAY

22
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,420
BETTER OFF LEAVING NOW.

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,479
EVEN
THOUGH IT'S A TERRIBLY

24
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,250
EMBARRASSING FIRING TODAY, LATER
HE MIGHT THINK, THANK GOD I GOT

25
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,619
OUT OF THERE.

26
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:27,090
THIS IS GREAT, FIRST IT WAS
LIKE LET'S LET MY DOGS FIGHT

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:35,270
EACH OTHER AND SEE WHICH ONE
WINS OUT, AND THE MOOCH WON OUT.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:41,250
HERE IS THE OFFICIAL TWEET,
YOU MIGHT THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP

29
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,409
WOULD DO THIS DURING A PRESS
CONFERENCE, WELL ORCHESTRATED --

30
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,910
NO, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT, HE DID
IT VIA TWEET.

31
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,299
HE FIRED REINCE

32
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,241
PRIEBUS DURING A TWEET, HE SAID
I'M PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT I

33
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:56,399
HAVE JUST NAMED JOHN KELLY AS
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, HE'S

34
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,810
A GREAT AMERICAN AND A GREAT
LEADER, JOHN HAS ALSO DONE A

35
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,229
SPECTACULAR JOB AT HOMELAND
SECURITY, HE HAS BEEN A TRUE

36
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,409
STAR OF MY ADMINISTRATION.

37
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,179
I
WOULD LIKE TO THANK REINCE

38
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,459
PRIEBUS FOR HIS SERVICE AND
DEDICATION TO HIS COUNTRY.

39
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,459
WE

40
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,799
ACCOMPLISHED A LOT TOGETHER AND
I'M PROUD OF HIM!

41
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:21,510
FOR BEING A HUMAN CARPET FOR
THE LAST YEAR OVER WHICH TO WALK

42
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,569
ON.

43
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,730
MY GOD -- LOYALTY IS NOT
EVEN LOYALTY ANYMORE.

44
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,730
WE NEED

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,189
NEW WORDS.

46
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:33,329
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN
THE MOB YET -- GIVE ME TIME --

47
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:40,980
SCARAMUCCI MIGHT CALL ME UP, BUT
HOW DO YOU GET MORE LOYAL THAN

48
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
PRIEBUS?

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:50,310
HE STAYED QUIET THROUGHOUT THE
ELECTION, WHEN THE SEXUAL

50
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,689
ASSAULT STORIES CAME UP PRIEBUS
SAID THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE

51
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:00,290
-- ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES, OF
WHOM YOU WOULD THINK PRIEBUS IS

52
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,390
ONE, MITT ROMNEY, ETC., SAID WE
NEED TO ABANDON TRUMP DURING THE

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,810
ELECTION, THERE WAS THE NEVER
TRUMP ATTEMPT TO MAYBE GET

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,849
SOMEONE IN -- NO, SAYS REINCE
PRIEBUS, HE IS WITH ME, I'M WITH

55
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,029
HIM, AND NOW DOWN GOES PRIEBUS.

56
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:21,109
YOU FORGOT THE LAST TWEET
WHERE TRUMP THANKED PRIEBUS FOR

57
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:28,470
RETURNING THE KNIFE IN HIS BACK
ON THE WAY OUT.

58
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,799
TO GIVE YOU A

59
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,099
MORE THOROUGH SENSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED HERE, REINCE PRIEBUS

60
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,979
WAS HEAD OF THE RNC, AND HENCE
MOST DEFINITIVELY A PART OF THE

61
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,030
REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT.

62
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,109
TRUMP
DEFEATED THE ESTABLISHMENT SO HE

63
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,180
COULD PUT ANYONE IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION HE WANTED TO, BUT

64
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,200
HE MADE PEACE WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT AND BROUGHT IN

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
REINCE PRIEBUS.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,719
DID SOME FOLKS
IN THE ESTABLISHMENT CAMP LEAK

67
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,159
INSIDE THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE?

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,370
THEY DID.

69
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,370
WAS TRUMP RIGHT TO BE

70
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,389
FRUSTRATED BY THAT?

71
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:05,029
I WILL GIVE
HIM CREDIT, HE WAS.

72
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:06,029
I WOULD BE

73
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,029
FRUSTRATED TOO.

74
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:10,000
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,680
I WILL NAME THEM ALL. AND I
WILL KILL THEM.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,720
I WILL START WITH "A," ADRIAN,
YOU ARE GONE.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,190
MOOCH SAID ALMOST THE SAME
THING TO RYAN LIZZA THE OTHER

78
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,190
DAY.

79
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:29,949
MAKING PEACE WITH THE
ESTABLISHMENT DIDN'T WORK.

80
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:30,949
ON

81
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,479
THE OTHER HAND, TRUMP HAS TWO
ENORMOUS PROBLEMS.

82
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,479
I JUST TOLD

83
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,770
YOU THEY WERE LEAKING ON HIM, NO
QUESTION ABOUT THAT, BUT ON THE

84
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,650
OTHER HAND, WHAT KIND OF A
HORRIFIC MANAGER ARE YOU THAT

85
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,370
YOU ALLOW YOUR TOP LIEUTENANTS
TO FIGHT IN PUBLIC?

86
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,370
YOU MADE A

87
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,020
MOB REFERENCE, FRANCESCA --
THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THAT,

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,510
THIS IS WHAT MOB BOSSES DO.

89
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,840
OKAY, TONY --

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,229
FOR THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE
OF ITALIAN VOTERS, THIS IS A

91
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,509
SOPRANOS REFERENCE.

92
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:07,620
I'M COOL WITH IT, YOU HAVE TO
BE.

93
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,210
LET'S SAY ROBERT AND FRED.

94
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,069
ROBERT AND FRED, YOU HAVE TO

95
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,099
FIGHT.

96
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,020
LET'S SEE WHO -- AND THE
MOOCH CAME IN AND HE WAS MORE

97
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,199
VICIOUS, AND THE MOB BOSS WAS
LIKE, NICE JOB.

98
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,639
I USE THAT AS AN

99
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,550
ANALOGY, IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT
TRUMP IS IN THE MOB RIGHT NOW --

100
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,930
HE DOES USE THE SAME LAWYERS AS
FIVE OUT OF THE TOP SIX ITALIAN

101
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,159
MOB LAWYERS IN NEW YORK AND HE
HAS CONNECTIONS TO THE RUSSIAN

102
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:48,750
MOB -- ANYWAY, ONE, HORRIFIC
MANAGEMENT TO DO THIS ALL IN

103
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,800
PUBLIC, IT'S SUCH A MESS, IT'S
UNBELIEVABLE.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
THEY ARE NOT

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,729
WINNING WITH THE STRATEGY, THEY
LOOK RIDICULOUS, THEY LOOK LIKE

106
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,430
FOOLS.

107
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:03,919
AND A GOOD BOSS AND A GOOD
LEADER TO ALLOW THEIR NUMBER TWO

108
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,490
AND THREE GUYS TO GO AFTER EACH
OTHER, BECAUSE THEN YOU ARE

109
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,280
WITHOUT EITHER A NUMBER TWO OR
THREE GUY.

110
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,449
AND YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

111
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,979
YOU
DON'T LOOK LIKE A STRONG LEADER.

112
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,650
IF YOUR ENTIRE TEAM IS IN
DISARRAY --

113
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,940
YOU MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE A
STRONG LEADER BUT YOU ARE BEING

114
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,319
LOOKED AT, AND IT JUST FEELS SO
MUCH LIKE A REALITY SHOW.

115
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,319
IT

116
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,409
FEELS LIKE IT'S DONE FOR
RATINGS.

117
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:27,530
HE BROUGHT IN

118
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,289
SCARAMUCCI, SCARAMUCCI, SIC 'EM.

119
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,340
HE LIKES HAVING THESE ATTACK

120
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,050
DOGS AND HE LOVES THE ATTENTION,
NOT JUST FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC

121
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,090
WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT, BUT FROM
THE PEOPLE UNDER WHO ARE

122
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,129
FIGHTING SO HARD TO BE JUST
LIKE, LOOK AT ME, LOVE ME, I

123
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:44,879
WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.

124
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,530
IT FEELS SO
MUCH LIKE GAME OF THRONES.

125
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,530
THERE

126
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,129
IS A MOMENT IN GAME OF THRONES
SEASON 3 THAT I WILL SPOIL IF

127
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:56,930
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, THERE IS A
PERSON WHO TAKES OVER

128
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:05,729
WINTERFELL, AND THERE IS SOMEONE
WHO IS NOT SWORN TO ANY ARMY,

129
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,999
JUST SWORN TO LOOK OVER
WINTERFELL -- TO ME THAT'S

130
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:10,699
REINCE PRIEBUS.

131
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,999
LISTEN, MY JOB
IS TO MAKE SURE THE REPUBLICAN

132
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,659
PARTY STANDS AFTER ALL THESE
CASTLES HAVE BURNED TO THE

133
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:19,060
GROUND.

134
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,669
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS
VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS,

135
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,780
WHERE DONALD TRUMP, THE THEON
GREYJOY -- IT'S SO AFTER,

136
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,099
SOMEONE TRYING TO LIVE UP TO HIS
DADDY'S EXAMPLE -- HAS SOMEONE

137
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:44,909
JUST STABBED THE MAESTER IN THE
GUT, AND NOW THERE 

138
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,909
IS NO

139
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,840
ONE IN CONTROL ANYMORE.

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,860
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF
THAT, BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT

141
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,590
EMPEROR PALPATINE HERE.

142
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,749
AND WE
KNOW WHO THAT IS, RIGHT?

143
00:07:58,749 --> 00:07:59,749
WHERE

144
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,240
IS THE DARK LORD IN ALL THIS?

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,319
BECAUSE FOR ME -- AND I'M JUST

146
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,370
READING -- LISTEN, I DON'T READ
EVERY ONE OF TRUMP'S TWEETS BUT

147
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,159
THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN
INTERESTING, I THINK THE EMPEROR

148
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,539
PALPATINE USES A LOT OF
ELLIPSES.

149
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:16,211
THE BANNING OF TRANS

150
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:22,659
PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY, LOTS OF
ELLIPSES -- TRUMP DOESN'T USE A

151
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:23,860
LOT OF ELLIPSES.

152
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:32,140
I THINK BANNON, THE DARK LORD,
IS BEHIND THESE TWEETS.

153
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,729
I THINK YOU ARE MAKING A
MISTAKE.

154
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:36,969
IN STAR WARS THERE ARE

155
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:39,169
THE FORCES OF LIGHT AND
DARKNESS, THERE ARE SMART PEOPLE

156
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,870
ON BOTH SIDES -- IN THIS CASE
THERE IS NO GUY BEHIND THE

157
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,709
CURTAIN, IT'S JUST THE SAME
ORANGE BUFFOON.

158
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:47,790
YOU OPEN THE

159
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,370
CURTAIN, HE'S LIKE, I WAS IN THE
MIDDLE OF TWEETING.

160
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,370
THERE IS NO

161
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,370
PLAN HERE.

162
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,089
IF IT WAS STEVE
BANNON, MOOCH HATES STEVE

163
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:03,570
BANNON WE KNOW, BECAUSE MOOCH
JUST TOLD RYAN LIZZA ON THE

164
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,350
RECORD THAT I'M NOT LIKE STEVE
BANNON, WHO LIKES TO SUCK HIS

165
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,820
OWN COCK.

166
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,779
IF YOU WATCH THE PREQUELS,
EMPEROR PALPATINE CAN SUCK HIS

167
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,800
OWN PENIS.

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,580
I 
WAS ALSO GOING TO USE A STAR

169
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,660
WARS ANALOGY -- THERE IS THIS

170
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,650
EMPEROR PALPATINE, AND IT'S THE
REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT.

171
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,650
NOT

172
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,310
THESE GUYS WHO HAVE TAKEN OVER
FOR A SECOND.

173
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,610
THE EWOKS.

174
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,149
TRUMP IS MORE LIKE SPACEBALLS.

175
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,199
HE'S GOT THE GIANT HAT ON, HE'S

176
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,690
LIKE, AM I DOING THIS RIGHT?

177
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,110
AND HE'S SURROUNDED BY
ASSHOLES.

178
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:59,190
THE EMPIRE WILL STRIKE BACK --
HE HAS BURNED TOO MANY BRIDGES.

179
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,820
NOW SPICER HATES HIM, PRIEBUS
HATES HIM, MCCAIN HATES HIM --

180
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,130
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON OF ALL
THE PEOPLE WHO HATE HIM.

181
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,230
REMEMBER, IF HE'S GOING TO
PROTECT AGAINST IMPEACHMENT, IF

182
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,500
PERHAPS HE DID THE DEAL WITH THE
RUSSIANS AND THE INVESTIGATORS

183
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,550
COME OUT OF HIM, DEMOCRATS WILL
OBVIOUSLY VOTE YES TO GET RID OF

184
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,550
THEM.

185
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,089
HE MUST HOLD THE
REPUBLICANS, AND IF HE HAS

186
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:35,260
SHIVED EVERY REPUBLICAN, HE
WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD THEM.

187
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
BUT

188
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,200
THIS SPACEBALL DOESN'T EVEN GET
IT, BECAUSE HE HAS NO STRATEGY.

189
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,550
HE'S PROFOUNDLY DUMB, AND HE'S
ENORMOUSLY DISLOYAL.

190
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,550
REINCE

191
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,160
PRIEBUS FOUGHT FOR HIM TO AND
NAIL TO MAKE SURE HE GOT

192
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,300
ELECTED, EVEN THROUGH THE TAPES
WHERE HE GRABS THE WOMEN AND

193
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,190
STUFF, PRIEBUS IS LIKE IT'S NO
BIG DEAL, SEXUAL ASSAULT,

194
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,190
WHATEVER --

195
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,759
WE ALL SAY STUFF TO IMPRESS
BILLY BUSH.

196
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,759
TELL ME YOU

197
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,759
WOULDN'T.

198
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,910
AND RECENTLY IN JUNE, TRUMP
AGAIN -- I KEEP TALKING ABOUT

199
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,959
MOB BOSSES BECAUSE THERE'S NO
MANAGEMENT STYLE IN BUSINESS

200
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,660
LIKE THIS THAT'S EFFECTIVE, OR
POLITICS, THIS IS THE MANAGEMENT

201
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,839
STYLE OF THE MOB.

202
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,420
HE HAD ALL HIS LIEUTENANTS COME
OUT IN JUNE AND SAY GOOD

203
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
THINGS ABOUT HIM.

204
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
THEY KISSED HIS RING.

205
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,810
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO
THE WEDDING OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

206
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,810
EXACTLY.

207
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,940
AND IN THAT PARADE OF
FOOLS -- SESSIONS JUST DID IT

208
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
TOO.

209
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,070
HE KEEPS PUNCHING SESSIONS
IN THE FACE, AND HE'S LIKE, I

210
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,570
WANT ANOTHER ONE.

211
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,970
I'VE SEEN THIS
MOVIE BEFORE, LITERALLY.

212
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,970
AT THAT

213
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,750
TIME PRIEBUS HAD SAID ON BEHALF
OF THE ENTIRE SENIOR STAFF

214
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,750
AROUND YOU, MR.

215
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,839
PRESIDENT, WE
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

216
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,751
AND THE BLESSING YOU'VE GIVEN US
TO SERVE YOUR AGENDA AND THE

217
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,089
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

218
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,509
THAT WAS LAST
MONTH.

219
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,579
AND DONALD TAKES HIM

220
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,040
ASIDE LIKE, I APPRECIATE THAT,
YOU ARE GOOD BOY.

221
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,660
OH, HE'S

222
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,529
BLEEDING OUT -- MOOCH, CLEAN
THAT UP.

223
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,720
THERE IS ONE RUMOR AS TO WHY
SCARAMUCCI HATES PRIEBUS SO

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
MUCH, IT WAS BECAUSE SCARAMUCCI
ANGLED DURING THE TRANSITION TO

225
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,430
GET A HIGH-PROFILE JOB IN THE
ADMINISTRATION AND PRIEBUS AT

226
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,810
THE LAST MINUTE PULLED TRUMP
ASIDE AND SAID LISTEN, HE JUST

227
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,769
SOLD HIS COMPANY TO A LOT OF
CHINESE INVESTORS FOR MORE THAN

228
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,819
IT WAS WORTH, AND AS A RESULT I
THINK THAT DEAL LOOKS FISHY, AND

229
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:47,709
THE QUOTE FROM THE HUFFINGTON
POST WAS, REINCE PRIEBUS TELLING

230
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,420
TRUMP THAT YOU GOT PLAYED.

231
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:56,060
I'M
NOT SAYING IT'S TRUE, BUT THESE

232
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,579
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS FLOATING
AROUND, WHICH IS ALL WE HAVE.

233
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,569
LIKE, DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
RUSSIA?

234
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,990
OOH, CHINA --

235
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:12,830
AND FINALLY, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY ALL THIS WENT DOWN.

236
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,830
IT'S

237
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,110
CONFIRMED THAT REINCE PRIEBUS
BLOCKED SCARAMUCCI, WHETHER HE

238
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:23,440
DID IT WITH THOSE EXACT
STRATEGIES IS NOT KNOWN, BUT

239
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,279
SCARAMUCCI HAS CONFIRMED THAT
PRIEBUS BLOCKED HIM FROM GETTING

240
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,990
TO THE ADMINISTRATION AFTER HE
SOLD HIS COMPANY, CHANGED HIS

241
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,089
LIFE.

242
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,139
PRIEBUS HAS BLOCKED HIM
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE, AND IN

243
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,279
MOOCH'S COLORFUL LANGUAGE HE
TOLD A REPORTER, HE COCKED

244
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,350
BLOCKED ME.

245
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,170
REMEMBER WHEN THEY
COMPLAINED THAT OBAMA WASN'T

246
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,180
BEING CLASSY ENOUGH IF OFFICE?

247
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,870
IF SCARAMUCCI EVER GOT NEAR
ANYONE OF MY FRIENDS, I WOULD

248
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,250
THROW MYSELF AT THEM.

249
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,339
THE DUDE
IS JUST ASKING TO BE COCKED

250
00:14:05,339 --> 00:00:00,000
BLOCKED.
