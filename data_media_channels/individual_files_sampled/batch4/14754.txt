the fact that you're willing to stand up for the UK tells us that we should stand up for Canada and Australia and America I think that the more people get to know you around the world the more they they see you as an inspiration and I'm saying that personally - I mean you fight hard at great cost let me ask a question about the future I say again every time I come to the UK I see things that trouble me and worry me and you know we study the UK in Canada is the mother country former seat of the Empire it doesn't feel like it's that same UK are you optimistic for the future can we save we turn the UK around from a depressing God in these issues like I always say to people if you listen to me all the time you're going to be depressed on the situation we're in because it's a reality the reality is we've got some dark dark times coming in the UK will we pull through them we have to but I think there's a hell of a lot of dis death destruction and chaos yet to come you know what I wish I could disagree with you that's to praise the press of it mr. president people it is to press in but that's the reality and to say that once you understand once you get to the point where you understand how bad the situation has been over the last four months for for terrorist attacks and we're aware that the situation is only going to get worse what's the 23,000 G Paddy's 2000 23,000 nine jihad he's on a monitor list you can't monitor 23,000 possible they have to they have to they have to grade them and they monitor at the top 3,000 that they believer at risk that's all they can afford to do at nine billion pounds a year but then the last three attacks the last three were all known all the people known all within that 23,000 barrier but weren't in the top 3000 so the people who went out and blew people up and and slit people's throats and killed kids they were all known but they weren't at the top 3,000 so imagine what the top 3,000 are potentially wanting to do to us and that if they're the highest ranking so once you understand that once you accept that we have three to four million Muslims in this country for me five actually and there's a big percentage of those people who will never want to integrate or assimilate in any sort of way and will only be committed to bringing about Islam and Sharia on this nation and those numbers are multiplied and I'm multiplying an uncontrollable ray once you understand that I want you accept that then you accept we've got a depressing a bleak future that's an excerpt from a daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
