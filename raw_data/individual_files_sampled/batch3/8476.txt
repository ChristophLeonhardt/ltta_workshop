REPORTING. WILLIAM, THANK YOU. â™ª Mike: ON TONIGHT'S WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SEGMENT NATALEE HOLLOWAY THE TEENAGER WAS ON A TRIP TO ARUBA WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED BACK IN 2005. HER CASE IGNITED A MEDIA FRENZY WHICH FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY REAL ANSWERS. CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN SERRIE TELLS US WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER GET OUT OF YOUR MIND. 13 YEARS AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS DAUGHTER NATALEE, DAVE HOLLOWAY IS STILL SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS. YOU ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AND WHAT HAPPENED. IN 2005, THE 18-YEAR-OLD FROM BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, VANISHED FROM A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION TRIP TO ARUBA. NATALEE, IN A SENSE, BECAME AMERICA'S CHILD ARUBA BECAME THE CENTER OF INTERNATIONAL MYSTERY. LAST SEEN LEAVING A POPULAR BAR WITH THEN 17-YEAR-OLD JORAN VAN DER SLOOT. JORAN VAN DER SLOOT WAS NOT ARRESTED UNTIL 10 DAYS AFTER NATALEE WENT MISSING. AND I THINK THE NEWS MEDIA THEIR INVOLVEMENT FORCED THIS. THE NEWS CREWS DEFENDED ON THE TINY NATION AS THE MYSTERY AROUND NATALEE'S DISAPPEARANCE BECAME A MAJOR THE ENORMOUS AMERICAN MEDIA PRESSURE IS I THINK WHAT DROVE THE ARUBAN GOVERNMENT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CASE WAS NOT THE ORDINARY CRIMINAL CASE. VAN DER SLOOT WAS NEVER CHARGED. JORAN VAN DER SLOOT, THE PRIME SUSPECT WAS SUCH SLEAZE. IT WAS CLEAR HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. T.J. WARD AS AN INVESTIGATOR HIRED BY THE FAMILY IN 2005. HE CONTINUES TO WORK ON THE CASE TODAY. I DO BELIEVE JORAN VAN DER SLOOT IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF NATALEE HOLLOWAY? ABSOLUTELY. VAN DER SLOOT IS PERUVIAN PRISON FOR THE 2010 MURDER OF 21-YEAR-OLD STEPHANY FLORES RAMIREZ STRANGLED IN A LIMA MOTEL ROOM ON THE 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATALEE'S DISAPPEARANCE. AND I THINK ARUBA HAS TAKEN THE POSITION NOW WHY OPEN PANDORA'S BOX NEXT 20 YEARS HE WILL BE IN PRISON AND THEN HE HAVE TO FACE FEDERAL COMARGES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR EXTORTION. THAT'S BECAUSE BEFORE LEAVING FOR PERU VAN DER SLOOT DEMANDED PAYMENTS FROM NATALEE'S MOTHER BETH FOR INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF HER DAUGHTER'S REMAINS. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A CHILD GO MISSING. IN 2010 BETH HOLLOWAY LAUNCHED THE RESOURCE CENTER A NONPROFIT FOCUS ON OTHER FAMILIES NOT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT SHE AND HER EX-HUSBAND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE PAST 13 YEARS. AS A PARENT, YOU WANT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE NATALIE AND WE DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN REALLY FROM THE FIRST
