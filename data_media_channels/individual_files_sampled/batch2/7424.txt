the federal government is considering sanctions against China now these sanctions allegedly have nothing to do with the trade war that we're currently engaged in with China in fact US lawmakers are arguing that we need to sanction China over its treatment of Muslims in the country in fact they have been detaining Muslims weaker muslims specifically and making them change their ideology rid themselves of their Muslim religion and these are essentially camps detainment camps that they're putting these individuals into so Chinese Muslims in the camps are forced to attend daily classes denounce aspects of Islam study mainstream Chinese culture and pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party some detainees who have been released have described torture by security officers now this has been a story that's been going on over the last year more and more reporters are becoming aware of what's happening in China with this Muslim minority in the country in fact PBS newshour did a story on it and they give more detail into what's going on so take a look Radio Free Asia journalist Kuchera hoja told Congress last month her family's in camps where we Gers are reportedly subject to torture and indoctrination I learned in February that my aunt's causes their children more than 20 people had been swept up by authorities in the same day that hearing was called by Senator Marco Rubio yesterday he and 16 other Senate and House members sent the state and Treasury Department's the letter accusing China of arbitrary detention torture and egregious restrictions on religious practice and culture and calling for sanctions on senior Chinese officials today China's foreign ministry spokesman said Chinese minorities have freedom of religion and the US had no right to criticize Chinese ethnic minority policies and the rights and equality ethnic minorities enjoy I even stronger than in the United States China says it's responding to what it calls Weger terrorism and a weaker separatist movement in Xinjiang many Weger seek an independent homeland and clash with police china says it's trying to maintain stability and does not detain anyone arbitrarily so what's fascinating about this story is who we're hearing from in terms of u.s. politicians Marco Rubio is one of the politicians who's actually speaking out against this he says the scale of it it's massive it involves not only intimidating people on political speech but also a desire to strip people of their identity ethnic identity religious identity on a scale I'm not sure we've seen in the modern era so while some US politicians are speaking out against this and and calling for sanctions Trump has been resistant to it and it appears that he's softening on the idea of implementing some of these sanctions and this is my thoughts on it but my suspicion is that Trump is salty toward China because of the trade war that we're involved in I don't think that these two things are separate when it comes to Trump's decision-making Trump keeps ramping up you know the tariffs on China China retaliates in a similar fashion it just keeps getting worse and I think that's one of the reasons why Trump has softened his ideas on implementing some sanctions so mixed news here for Republicans I'm about to give some of them credit in a second but notice what the Chinese are doing in these camps and by the way the scope of the camps is unreal hundreds of thousands maybe up to a million people in what could be considered I mean internment camps detention camps I don't want to use the other word but apparently there's torture there now they are forced into patriotism pledging loyalty to their country forced integration into the culture you must assimilate into Chinese culture and you mustn't denounce Islam who does that sound like when you turn on fox news any day of the week and they'll tell you why won't these ethnic minorities assimilate into American culture why won't they do it we should we should make them do it otherwise they should get kicked out of the country no but that's the reason why I this story was shocking to me that our current government is considering sanctioning China over their treatment of Muslims I mean look we're not imprisoning Muslims here but we are certainly contributing to what's happening in Yemen right now all those civilians getting murdered in Yemen right now we've teamed up with Saudi Arabia and and I mean look to what it what there was a point made in that PBS Newshour video by a Chinese official who said you know said something about the US human rights abuses we are guilty of human rights abuses not maybe not in the United States but certainly in other countries I mean if you want to talk about you know our actions leading to the deaths of innocent individuals abroad and we are we're guilty of stuff here as well I mean look at how unarmed black men get treated in this country and the list goes on but our and we're separating families at the border now and then they have their own detention camps right etc that doesn't make what China is doing right and by the way it also doesn't mean that it's on the same scale there's 11 million Weger in China now these reports say up to 1 million of them 10 percent of them are put into these detention main camps with brainwashing a potentially torture etc etc so and you want to I mean you don't talk about denouncing Islam Trump is famous for during the campaign saying we have to have a total ban on Muslims until we figure out what the hell is going on that is why you'll excuse us if we're a little skeptical that Trump is doing this because of his newfound respect for the Muslim religion right that would be borderline shocking and by the way take Muslims out of it for a second and and by the way let me just correct myself because you're right we are guilty of human rights abuses here as well I mean the zero tolerance policy was the latest example of that but you know Trump has an affinity for dictators throughout the world who carry out human rights abuses I mean he bragged about how kim jeong-hoon how the people of North Korea you know salute Kim jong-un because they're forced to right I mean he loves that kind of stuff so that's why I think when it comes to Trump there's an ulterior motive I don't think it's really about human rights abuses so but by the way another pronunciation of we are is you ger like my last name it is the same thing now I am NOT an ethnic you ger but our family was named after them I could be I've told that story before in a postgame I can tell to you again today and another postgame that's for the members T YT comm slash joined become a member will that way we get to have more time to discuss these things but it's not about me so this story about the however you pronounce of the weaker sir you verse now let me turn around and give Republicans credit now look if you tell me Trump actually cares about human rights abuses wants to go after dictators and protect Muslims you're not ever gonna get me to believe that okay so it's but what is but the Trump administration so far is doing this even if they're doing for a bad purpose where they want to punish China about trade and not really about human rights abuses I'll take it even if Trump didn't want to do it but he was forcing to do it by the rest of his administration but they actually carried this out and fight for human rights causes I'll take it and I'll give Trump credit if he actually does this and and fights for those people I don't care why he did it I don't care who forced him to do it at the end of the day he's the president and I will give him credit and obviously there are people inside the administration that want to do this and it's the right thing to do give them credit and of all people Marco Rubio who I cannot stand why thing is a fake politician and all that stuff he is fighting for this that that's clear yep and I and I really don't care about his motivations in this regard so he's fighting for a million people that are sitting in a detention camps right now trying to be while the Chinese government tries to destroy their ethnicity and their identity okay and the fact that Rubio is fighting for them he deserves a lot of credit and so did the Senators that all signed on to that letter Democrat and Republican so man what look if Republicans do the right thing why wouldn't we give them credit bless their hearts that's fantastic that's what we want just doesn't happen that often but in this case it is so Rubio does deserve the credit and people inside the Trump administer do as well now finally you know there's a propaganda whether it's from the Chinese government and by the way they do like let me say this as I do with every country the Chinese government does not represent all the Chinese people and so just because they have a right-wing government in there they can call themselves communist but they are uber capitalists all obsessed with their own wealth right and run a basically a dictatorial government and so they do not represent all the Chinese people in China or across the world as I tell you all the time the Israeli right-wing government does not represent all the people in Israel and the American government under Trump Bush etcetera did not represent us under Cheney did not represent us they represent yes a section of the people in China it's even a smaller section well here in America they basically are politicians represent our donors in China they represent the Politburo okay basically so but look at what's happening in the world as the Chinese government says the Muslims are bad and they're separatists etc and we have to go and crush the Muslims Fox News tells you every day and Donald Trump tells you the Muslims are the problem we got to go get the Muslims the Muslims are the problem meanwhile it's the Muslims that are in detention camps it by the hundreds of thousands perhaps million in China it's the Muslims who were displaced in Myanmar mass murders rapes 700,000 people live in squalid conditions right now in Bangladesh because they were driven out by massacres in in Myanmar but yet the talking points never change Muslims are the bad guys it's in their nature it's in their religion they're ants a lot of people make the argument no no no Islam is worse than all the other religions it is irredeemable now when other religions do it or non religions do it no no that was just a one-off that was just coincidence when Muslims get crushed whether it's in Myanmar China or by the way Yemen from other Muslims Iraq Syria from other Muslims aided and abetted by the United States of America the Russians in the case of Syria etc no no look away look away no Muslims are always a guilty one not the victims the reality is no the world is not black and white Chinese people are not all bad they don't all hate Muslims that's insane well all Muslims are not bad they're not just victims and they're not just the aggressors it depends do they have power do they not have power what is the politics of the situation what's the economic situation so please what we're asking to do is to take a look at the world as it is and yes it is complex and it has many different factors don't go to honestly the same way of thinking as this Chinese government saying Muslims bad put them into camps make them non-muslims right and unfortunately some of our right-wing think along similar lines but for those that don't they deserve credit yeah and and by the way I just really want to emphasize that they're not just putting adults in these camps they're putting children in these camps as well doesn't matter what their age is if they're categorizes as Weger Muslims they're being forced into these camps and in some cases tortured the TYT Plus app is now available on iOS and Android download to get more TYT content at TYT dot-com slash app
