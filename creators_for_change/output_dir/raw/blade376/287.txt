your advice I mean you saw that poster

97
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,030
on my wall and therefore were able to

98
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,370
make and calculate a lot of assumptions

99
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,410
which led you to believe that I do smoke

100
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,980

130
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,330
your videos in the US have been so

131
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,080
anti-american because you've shown

132
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,690
problems oh maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you actually look</font>

133
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,610
to all my videos you'd realize there was

134
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,590
some positive stuff and negative because

135
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,759
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my trip was to give a</font>

136
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,770
balanced view point from an outsider oh

137
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,440

143
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:48,120
absolutely appalling that you bleep out

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,080
your swear words just to to emphasize

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,969
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're using such vulgar</font>

146
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,039
language did it ever cross your mind

147
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I'd do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> censor the language</font>

148
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,270
because maybe I have a broad audience

149
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,099
with some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do get offended</font>

150
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,949
like you oh do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake videos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> border</font>
