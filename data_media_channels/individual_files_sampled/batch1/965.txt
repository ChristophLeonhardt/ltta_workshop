welcome to panic Europe's most polluted town the coal-fired power station dominates it's owned by one of Bulgaria's richest men Pernik sits in a valley on a still winters day the smoke haze sits over the town it reveals his true color when you wipe it off this stuff has consequences Galena lives here with her family they all have lung or chest problems like others here she assumes life will be short in every family I know I really can count on the fingers of one can people's I can say I'm big and strong and they are usually young people the truth is that the people here are you in die early people who complain about the dust that blows off the slag heaps or the opencast mines which scar the land say officialdom doesn't want to know they're told over and over that there is no problem so it had begun their own tests to try to prove their being poisoned people don't trust the authorities this is this is definitely the case in Bulgaria and we've seen so many times that basically the authorities are providing replied to to the civil demand for information like sorry you don't have the knowledge to interpret the data that would give you the mine owners store the coal in underground bunkers lker owns this house above one it's begun to sink into the ground she was refused compensation by the local authority and the mine owners so in the last two months this has sunk even more careful when you come in because I mean I mean the whole house could just collapse into the ground on every level it appears coal is harming the town campaigners say it's a metaphor for a much wider problem as a political bloc the European Union is trying to show its unity and commitment to tackling climate change and defending the Paris Accords particularly given the hostility of Donald Trump you do wonder therefore how helpful it is to the EU that the current presidents is Bulgaria a country which has indicated that it wants to continue to use coal as its primary power source into the indefinite future the Environment Minister who refused to speak to us is a node admirer of Trump and the climate change denier other voices in government happily defend Bulgaria's love of cold there shouldn't be any rush to implement restrictions on coal otherwise we will risk the energy balance of Europe it should be discussed at the highest levels of the European Council and countries should decide for themselves what they want to do to make things worse for the European Union Bulgaria has said it will support Poland in trying to water down existing EU rules from toxic emissions perhaps the biggest irony is that this country enjoys more than 300 days of sunshine a year it could heat every home with a solar panel but instead he's going the other way entirely Lauren Slee al-jazeera panic Bulgaria
