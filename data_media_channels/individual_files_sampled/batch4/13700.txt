Halloween is coming and you know what that means yes it's time for leftists to start whining and moaning in in their ceaseless attempt to squeeze every ounce of joy out of our harmless traditions until we're all miserable after which they'll ask us to vote for them so they can make things even worse so happy Halloween now with some holidays it's easy for leftist to know what to ruin Christmas for instance marks the incarnation on the earth of a God who loves and forgives us and is celebrated with beautiful music family gatherings and the exchange of gifts so there's just so much there for the left to crap all over but Halloween is different because it deals with the darker elements of the spirit world many of whom are currently running for Congress on the Democrat ticket how can the Left attack vampires when vampires suck the life out of everything and are therefore the natural mascots of socialism how can they ban zombies when zombies are the Living Dead who devour people's brains which describes the entire on-air staff of CNN and how can they insult witches who are malevolent females who curse the innocent and therefore represent about 50% of the Democrat base but after giving a lot of thought to a joyful aspect of Halloween they could destroy left this finally had a brainstorm and started picking on children's costumes left us now on a dictate what costumes we can and can't wear an American can't dress up as a terrorist for instance because that's appropriating Islamic culture I'll pause for you to get that joke likewise a white person can't dress up as a red Indian unless she's a Democrat senator hoping to run for president and a man can't dress up as a woman unless he really really means it now this raises an important question who the hell cares what these chuckleheads think of our costumes the next time some left this tells you what you're allowed to wear on Halloween why not just respond with three simple words and no I don't mean trick-or-treat trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin Chuck all right it's mailbag day all your problems will be solved in the course of the next hour - we shouldn't use zipper crews and we get stuck with Austin I well as as we're speaking some evil lunatic is sending bombs to a bunch of prominent Democrats who was got him Hillary Clinton got one the Clintons got one and as George Soros got one a couple of days ago and at CNN John Brennan I think it was got one so we'll just watch that they all have the return address of debbie Wasserman Wasserman Schultz I'm not actually making it up that they actually do you know what I what I would like to see I mean this is what our nation this is whether our national conversation was lacking before we were missing an evil lunatic you know we had everything going for us except the evil lunatic but I would like to see is I would like to see leftist commentators refrain from blaming this on Donald Trump and right wing commentators refrain from deducing that it's secretly a left winger until we find out who it actually is I would also like to see a leprechaun riding a unicorn but I don't think I'm gonna see any of those things we will leave this I don't know it's just a guess when you think who's gonna solve this case the police or some guy on Twitter I says I just I guess I think it's gonna be the cops well let them do their jobs and find out who this is and then I hope they throw in an oubliette because we this is the one thing we definitely don't need from either side battle box we got to talk about battle box I love these

que la vie a and you know I want to start I was gonna start by talking about the important news of the day but I want start but I'm talking about something trivial because sometimes trivial incidents actually do tell an important story and I've got a I've got it before I talk about this I'm gonna have to play some video so listen listen to it because it actually does you got to hear it before you know what I'm talking about I want to talk about this thing with megyn kelly if you haven't heard about this she went on her show and they were discussing Halloween costumes and of course I well you know I'm not joking the left just wants to suck the joy out of everything we do everything is problematical everything has to be reconsidered everything has to be looked at in the light of their woke brilliant righteousness megyn kelly went on and she was talking about getting being in costumes talking about somebody who had put on a white woman who would put on a costume of Diana Ross and made her skin look a little darker so she'd look more like Diana Ross and she said gee I think this would be okay and the people on the show with her said they didn't agree because of the old days when people would do minstrel shows and they would do kind of cliched stereotyped versions of black people with the white lips and all this stuff megyn kelly then got slammed of course by the Stalinists on twitter and she had to apologize now so before I talk about this because I'm about to tell you why we should very very much dress up in blackface or white face or any other damn thing we please but first I want to hear I want you to hear the usual it really is like these Stalinist show trials they drag you in front megyn kelly had to go on and apologize for this which she did with like her eyes filled let's play that first i'm meghan kelly and i want to begin with two words i'm sorry you may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face lighter or a white person making theirs darker and make a costume complete i defended the idea saying as long as it as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay well i was wrong and i am sorry one of the great parts of sitting in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface being used in awful ways by racists in this country it is not OK for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise okay I want to play before I talk about this I want to play one more clip just so you have the whole picture because of course with this stuff no apology is ever enough they are after blood they are not happy and you know it's not like at okay Megan you made a mistake you know I disagreed with you now you I convinced you you come over to my side never it is never ever enough I'm not gonna play Don Lemon head because who cares what he thinks but this is on our own network right other on our own network they come on and they have two commentators one of them al roker the weatherman discussing this and why even this is not enough most of the online criticism addressed the fact that there were no people of color represented in that panel pointing out that what we saw was a conversation that people generally have in a private space where there are no repercussions but this learning moment really gifted us the opportunity to have this conversation in a public discourse so we now have the courage and we have the platform to have conversations like this even when they're uncomfortable because we can see they're still necessary well it is uncomfortable obviously because Megan is a colleague at NBC News but it's um the fact is while she apologized to the staff she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country because this is a history going back to the 1830s minstrel shows to mean and denigrate a race wasn't right well I'm old enough to have lived through Amos and Andy yeah where you had white people in blackface playing to black characters and with just magnifying the worst stereotypes about black people and that's what the big problem is so I'm a person of color my color is white and here's what I want to say about this this is crap are you telling me are you telling me that a little black kid of his hero is Batman he can't put on a Batman mask and be Batman are you telling me that a little white boy if he wants to be what's his name this guy Black Panther he can't dress up his Black Panther you know there's a movie about about Jackie Robinson the great baseball player obviously first black guy in the major leagues and there's a scene in this movie genuinely moving scene where they're traveling on a train they look out the window and there's a little boy playing baseball doing what we all did what all of us I did certainly when I was a little boy pretending to be his hero and his hero is Jackie Robinson and he's a white boy pretending to be a black man that's a victory that's a victory we know it when we see the movie we understand this is a victory the good guys won that's the whole point the good guys won this battle look of course there are costumes that wouldn't be right if they express hatred if they were expressed disrespect I don't want to see anybody dressing up as a Klansmen or a Nazi or anything like that that's not the point that is not the point but what about your hero what if he's a ballplayer what if your hero's a ballplayer and you're a white kid and you want to dress up as a black ballplayer if you want to wear his jersey and that's not all right you know Al Roker listen I'm not this is not a personal attack on Al Roker he shook hands were the ones he seems like a lovely guy he's my age okay we're on the ramp of life it's not the job of old people to transfer the pain of history to young people you should learn history should know history but you don't repeat it but you don't have to live in history my father hated Germans he hated German people well I could understand that he fought in World War two of course he hated German people the Holocaust was a raw nerve for him you know I I totally get that it's not my job to hate German people those people are all dead the people who did that stuff are dead the new people are not responsible we won when I say we I mean the good guys won this fight we understand there were injustice is in this country those and justices are over people felt ashamed people felt all the things that why won't they let the wound heal well it's obviously why because they think they get power from it you know if this was still amos and andy if this was still you know minstrel shows I'd say okay yeah so that's disrespectful but how is it disrespectful to have somebody who when your hero is somebody of a different color we should all be dressing up as one another you know why because we are one another there's no difference than we are one another we're all Americans we should be able to dress up as one another and to say Oh in the old days it used to be one thing that's there for it's still that thing you know the American people are much much smarter than their intellectuals though the American people are much much smarter than their commentators they're perfectly able to see things that aren't so to speak black and white this is ridiculous this is ridiculous and why these people think that they should have some power some say over what people do with their kids what their kids want to do if they're not their parents I have no idea and the idea that megyn kelly had to beat regular people on the right agreeing with this saying she said something stupid I don't think she said something stupid at all I'm a totally on her side like he doesn't you know one of the things that I I can't help but notice as this election comes on that I don't have any inside information nobody has any inside information on these midterms history and the polls we have so far say that the Republicans hold the Senate lose the house in my gut in my gut I feel that that's not what's gonna happen I mean I feel like when I see the panic on the left when I see the panic in the media when I see the crowds turning out for Donald Trump never seen anything like that before the enthusiasm just seems to be all on the right and I think I think there's a possibility that we hold both houses which would be revolutionary if that happens if that happens we're gonna see something well we've seen it now we're gonna see something now and I'll talk about that in just a second but first I have to talk about my teeth or your teeth anybody's teeth you want your teeth to look good he got to use an electric toothbrush I love my electric toothbrush my dental hygienist told me that was the way to go because I complained about the fact that my teeth weren't getting clean and she said he got to use an electric toothbrush she was right the problem with regular electric toothbrushes is they're big and ugly they look like bazookas they're hard to carry around qyp has solved that problem Equipe is an electric toothbrush that looks like it was designed I don't know by like Apple it's just so sleek and so nice and it's easy to pack and it makes brushing your teeth simpler more affordable and even enjoyable it's kind of built in 2 minute timer which pulses every 30 seconds and that reminds you to switch sides of which part of your teeth you're brushing which is the way you're supposed to do it and that makes you get a full cleaning at full and even clean it's 3 out of 4 of us use bristles that are old worn-out and effective but qyp is one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the American Dental Association and new brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just five bucks I love this thing I really do love it is I take it wherever I go whenever I'm traveling I'm constantly traveling I'm constantly traveling so I've always got it my Dopp kit they get they are backed by over 20,000 dental professionals they start quit starts at just 25 bucks and if you go to get quip comm slash Clavin right now you get your first refill pack for free with equip electric toothbrush that's get quip comm slash Clavin that's GE t qu IP dot-com slash Clavin and I know what you're asking yourself you're asking yourself how do you spell Clavin there are no ease and Clavin I just make it look easy it's que la vie a n so Donald Trump has so shattered the left so shattered their narrative that they are running around picking up individual war and trying to make put them back on the racist board they're trying to put him back on the race of anything he says it's got that I'll grab that word and it's got to be racist you want to see one of the you know sometimes I play these clips in a certain order because like just want you to see in real time what the press is doing how the press is taking they're taking each word he says and trying to attach racism toward it whether there's racism connected or not so we've got obviously this Caravan now it's they're saying it's like close to 14,000 people I don't know how many people it is but it's marching here and you know we've got of course that evil president this is cut 10 that evil president talking against these poor illegal immigrants all Americans not only in the state's most heavily affected but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country the jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants the public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers that's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before by cracking down on illegal hiring by borrowing welfare benefits to illegal aliens in the budget I will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the work face Austin don't you know when I say evil president you're supposed to play trump what is I this is the second time the second day in a row yesterday you played Obama when I said insulting the the poor the poor illegal aliens so Trump goes up and he makes a speech where he says he takes on he's always accused of being a nationalist and the first meaning of national well let's play this one quick clip is cut number seven cut seven where he's talking to the crowd and he says yes I'm a nationalist is a person that wants the globe to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can't have that you know have a word it sort of became old-fashioned it's called a nationalist and I say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I am I'm a nationalist okay now the first meaning of the word natural nationalist is basically a patriot to somebody who cares about his nation or the you know the the concerns of his nation it can also be used to mean a jingoist somebody who cares too much you know who's just America right or wrong America all the time you know who doesn't want to criticize when America does something wrong which goes beyond patriotism into just kind of you know obsession their chauvinism so Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta is in the Oval Office and he asks Trump well when you say you're a nationalist isn't that a dog whistle meaning that you are a white nationalist and here's this is cut number one cut number one here is the question and Trump's the beginning of Trump's response to so you hear that what kind of what he's saying just to follow up on your comments about the Nationalists there is a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle to some Americans out there that would really I've never even heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I'm a nationalist no I never heard that theory about being a nationalist I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany's paying 1% of GDP for NATO and we're paying 4.3 percent I don't like that that's not fair so so he says it says the Trump do you mind if I take your word and translate it to mean that you're a racist they do Trump said nothing about race he said so you don't mind do you if I if I appropriate the word take it out of your mouth and now redefine it to mean you stink right that's what he wants to and Trump's response is detai it goes on and on from there I didn't want to play the whole thing he says we're not being treated fairly I want to take care of America first I want to make sure that I'm the press he's the president of the United States he's not the president of the world he wants to take care of the country that's why we hired him that's why we pay him although he doesn't take the money that's his job okay so now what's been explained the Costas asked his question he got the answer here is Jim Acosta later going on CNN right to tell Trump that Trump got no no Trump got it wrong Acosta knows what Trump is saying not Trump I pressed him on this in the Oval Office asked him well are you trying to say that you're a white nationalist what about these concerns out there that you're dog whistling to your base that you're sending coded messages to your base and he says well I haven't heard a theory about that and then he went on to say well you know there are trade issues and and so on as to why he he is attaching this label to himself but Anderson when you're demonizing immigrants migrants coming up from Central America trying to make their way to the United States and apply for asylum when you're demonizing Middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're their terrorists and so on in that Caravan without offering any proof and then calling yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist you don't know what you're saying I know what you're saying I'm here to tell you what you're saying reminds me of when David Brooks told us that the Islamists weren't killing us because of Islam they were killing us because that we were we were racist the Islamists are saying no no we're kidding we're killing you because of Islam you know no no no no I know I know what you're saying I'm a journalist but a trained journalist I know what you say they will take any word they can find lying on the ground and stick it back on that racist board they do not want these wounds to heal they don't want them to heal they get politically think they get political energy out of it they think they get political traction out of it so Jim Acosta Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta his question is the important thing not the president's answer right you survive journalists are supposed to ask questions in order to get answers no no no Jim Acosta asked questions because his questions contain all the information you need now luckily luckily Joe Scarborough has looked into this we didn't play this guy yesterday there we know Joe Scarborough has looked into this and he has got it all figured out he has figured out the trick a behind Donald Trump here it is but this is what they had for Adolf Hitler's psychological profile and for those of you in the midst of reading World War two government reports you'll find it fascinating his primary rules were never allow the public to cool off never admit a fault or wrong never concede that there may be some good in your enemy never leave room for alternatives never accept blame concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything that goes wrong get it wink wink Joe Scarborough in a mate with doing amazing research has figured out that Trump is literally Hitler Trump is literally there's a guy bruce bartlett a CNN commentator he's an historian he sends out a tweet Nikita I wish I were making this I really do wish I were this funny key differences between Donald the key differences between Donald Trump and Adolf Hitler Hitler served honorably in the military Trump didn't Hitler was faithful to his wife Trump cheated off all his wives Hitler wrote a book trumps were all ghostwritten Trump is worse than Hitler he's worse than Hitler by the way the reason Hitler was faithful to his wife as he married her and then killed himself that was like if they were married for 20 minutes but trumpet for these guys they're so desperate they're so desperate they have turned themselves into a Greg Gutfeld monologue except not as funny you remember Greg you used to run those monologues and they would all end in if you disagree with me you're literally Hitler this is hit if you disagree with them and one more thing before we get to the mailbag we want to get to the mailbag because I know you have a problems that I will all of which I will solve they keep saying this thing Oh Trump is speaking about with without any proof that there are criminals in the this Caravan he's first of all they're they're all want to be criminals because they want to break into our borders but but he's talking about there's there's no proof so far be it from Jim Acosta to do some I don't know reporting and go down to the caravan and find out but here we have an interview with a guy on the caravan cut number nine here's what he says is everywhere okay it's criminals in here I mean it is but it's not that many I mean peace is good people here trying to get through true Mexico and then get to the United States but that doesn't mean that everybody is a criminal thank you Jim don't you don't have to thank me I got the proof for you there it is there's the proof that's that guy I mean believe all migrants right so we got to believe the guy when he tells you he's surrounded by criminals scott adams had a great tweet today he said he said the you know he always talks about persuasion and who's doing the better persuasion he said the republicans slogan is job's not mobs and the democrat slogan is well not everybody in the caravan so so that's why I don't know like I said I got no more inside information about the midterms than anywhere anyone else but I don't know man I do not believe I certainly don't believe there's gonna be a blue wave and I feel there may be something very very different coming down the pike and I certainly hope so because I think if they get that message if Chuck Schumer who's just a political animal Nancy Pelosi just a political animal if she gets the message that this resistance stuff is blowing up their chances for re-election the resistance will fade away I do believe got the mailbag coming up we gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come

meanwhile you can come over and just listen to the rest of the show and we get to the mailbag in just a second all right the mailbag now he gets her right all right from Robert I think he just pitched forward his ending if the button needs is from Robert dear master screenwriter Clavin I just watched the Gosnell movie and I don't know if the theater was cold or if my skin was just crawling a lot of movies are exaggerated even when based on actual events how much of Gosnell was puffed up to making a movie please tell me a lot no I'm almost nothing I don't think I I don't think I made up anything except well their characters made up to represent you know various people like well the characters will be joined together but all the crime is real a lot of it I basically condensed the trial transcript I I spent a day with the cop woody who did the interview Dean Cain plays in the movie and talked to him about it and used things that he told me but no I didn't have I wish I had had to make it up it's all real from Ryan dear lord of the arts I do not want the US somebody today called me both a king and a gesture which I thought was just what I want to be and it saves money I can self entertain dear lord of the arts I do not want the u.s. to go into universal health care and I want the u.s. to rapidly decrease his welfare spending I believe I have good fiscal arguments for opposition to universal health care and welfare but I cannot think of a strong moral one how do people not have a right to health care and welfare when they do have a right to life how do they not have the right to entitlements to help support that life you know that's actually a bad argument I have to tell you you you have a when it says you have a right to life it means no one can take your life away that's what that means it means no one can take your life away without due process without due process you cannot have your luck you have the right to live you have the right to be left alone almost every right you have involves being left alone it doesn't involve me doing anything for you so I have the right to life I have the right to my life and my life is made up of time I use my time and in the way I use that time I might make money if you take that money for me you are taking my time you are taking my life you do not have the right to my property you don't have right - my time you don't have the right to my life so the thing is you have the right to be left alone and and live your life and when you live your life you have to take care of yourself that is the whole point of being free you you want to know what's moral what is moral is freedom that is your moral peg on which you hang your argument to once you say don't you have the right to everything that sustains life then I have to pay for your groceries I've got to pay for your medical care I've got to pay for your house I got pay for everything and then you're a socialist and once your socialist your time no longer belongs to you because everything you produce with your time belongs to the state and the state decides it how is it fair how is it fair that I go out and bust my chops to support my kids which I did and I go out and do the things that I have to do to support my kids and I get the check for my work my time my contribution and you because you're you have the guns of the government you get to say oh no no you don't get to spend that on what you want to spend it you have to spend it on what I want to spend it that's tyranny in order for us not to have tyranny each of us has to take care of himself and when people can't take care of themselves there should be systems to take care of them they don't have to be government systems in an ideal world and I know we're so far from this it's almost not worth talking about it but in the ideal world that is something we do voluntarily through our churches through our organizations and the reason is when I do something voluntarily for you I elevate both you and me i elevate me because I show that I have charity I show that I can get my open my hands and give you my money and I elevate you by making you responsible to do something with the money I gave you because you're looking me in the eye it's not an entitlement it's not something you're entitled to and you don't have to respond to it creates responsibility in you charity elevates entitlements degrade everybody it was really a shame what has happened to people under entitlements they have become dependent they have become less than they can be they become mediocre their lives become mediocre it is not moral to treat people like that just because you're ill doesn't give you the right to come to my house with a gun and take my money away and that is essentially what government healthcare does from Adam dear in Valcke infallible dome of chrome that's a new one I may I may have that put on my business cards I'm pro-life and I used to vehemently hate anyone associated with abortion including the women who had them when I found out that someone I love had an abortion which she regrets I was forced to re-examine my views I certainly haven't changed my stance on the issue as a whole but I find myself feeling far more sympathetic to the women and even more angry with the doctors and lawmakers that make abortion possible I was recently challenged on this with the question if it's murder then aren't the women murders and if they're murderers shouldn't they be in prison I couldn't answer how would you have responded we live in a very sick society on this subject and people good people have abortions and it is really a shame if you ever watch the movie The Giver there is a scene in that that is I I couldn't believe it actually got into a Hollywood film with where they it's it's um one of these dystopian stories and they kill a baby and somebody watching says how can he do that and he said they say he doesn't know what he's doing and I talk about this a lot and I won't go into it at length because I know I've said it before George Washington was a hero of Liberty one of the greatest heroes Liberty ever knew George Washington could not understand for a long period of his life why his slaves wanted to be free why because he lived in a society that was sick on the question of slavery and when you live in these societies when you live under that narrative it screws up your head it's hard to see the truth you know the statistics are something like worldwide there are forty to fifty between forty and sixty million million abortions a year that we can live in that society that I can sit here and talk to you and not be out like storming the barricades it's an indication of how sick the society is murder is some it murder includes intent if murder is not just killing somebody that's manslaughter murder includes an evil intent many of the people have abortions because they live in the sick narrative they don't have an evil intent they may even have a good intent they may feel that they're not doing anything wrong they know not what they do the question is not apportioning blame to people in this terrible situation the point is to heal the sickness of the society how do you do that laws do matter it doesn't matter that we should be able to discuss what laws we have that's why roe v wade such a travesty because it takes away our right to debate what laws we have in vote for what what laws we have if people have to argue about abortion if they had to debate abortion we'd be in a much much different situation if you could go on TV and say yeah this is what a baby looks like at 20 weeks look here's a picture we didn't have these before now we do now we know you know Thomas Aquinas said oh no a baby is not alive until it moves cuz wife because he didn't have an ultrasound he didn't have the gizmos we have now that can show us the truth if we can debate these things that's what we're looking for we're looking to change minds we're looking to change ideas we're looking to heal the sickness of the narrative of this society we're not looking to punish people who are infected with the sickness we're looking to free them from that illness and cure them Aaron dear grand ruler of the multiverse I've been listening to your show now for nearly two years and I have you and Ben to thank for my return to a state of mind of thinking about God and being more religious as before I always considered myself an agnostic I've got a relationship question for you that's really been weighing on my mind the last couple of months I've been dated this dating this girl for coming up on a year now and I have to say that objectively she seems like the kind of girl I should be proposing to with nearly all the same interest she's a former lefty who read pilled herself I find myself constantly having the urge to look elsewhere for female attention because I feel less and less attracted to her physically this feels incredibly shallow to me and I don't want to be the kind of guy that breaks up with a girl because she's not the body type I'm looking for I'm looking for some super idealized version I'm not looking for some super idealized version of a goddess woman but I think at best I find her cute I'm not sure if there's the kind of thing I should just push away and chalk up to me being a young guy with raging hormones or if this is a valid excuse to break up in a way I think I'm looking for permission listen you know I can only tell you on this I can only tell you how I would feel about this first of all I marry a woman to whom I was not attracted because I think when you fall in love with somebody you are attracted to them I have fallen in love with women who didn't look attractive to me before I fell in love with them they became attractive to me when I did so I would say as an indication your your attraction here seems to be an indication that you're not in love with her that you don't love her if you're not in love with her you should not propose to her and you should also stop dating her you should set her free to go and date somebody else it is not right to lead women on it's not right because you can't make up a decision to steal her time in her life so I would say you know to me this would be an indication that I wasn't in love with her that that that's what I can tell you personally and and now if I knew I wasn't in love with her and wasn't likely to fall in love with her becoming less and less attracted to her I would I would move on it's not shallow it's part of love part of love is eros part of love is attraction and physical attraction you know and hopefully that lasts you for your whole marriage and for your whole life and I don't think it's shallow at all from Rob to the leader of men and Noel's a longtime listener loved the show keep up the good work my question is regarding the Harvard lawsuit I have a this is about Asians saying they're being discriminated against I have a bud that went to Harvard and explained to me there's different angle in the situation students are not admitted solely based on academic marks but also in extracurricular activities yeah you know so what he's saying is how do we know that it's racism that's what the case is about basically it seems to me when I saw the news story and I read the news story about it it seemed to me that Harvard was using these extracurricular ways as ways of keeping Asians out because they didn't want to go all Asian basically because Asians do very well in school if that's the case and if they make that case in court successfully I do not believe that people should be chosen due to their race I don't believe it I don't believe that diversity in that sense is a strength I believe that having to compete and live up to the quality of the school is a strength and people should go to the schools they can get into and that they deserve to get into that's what the case is about now if the Harvard can prove no you know we didn't care that they were Asian it wasn't about that it was that they didn't have any extracurricular activities fine but I it sounded suspicious to me I got to say from and net dear Andrew I'm afraid my husband is an alcoholic we've been married for going on eight years we just had our fourth baby thanks to his hard work I'm able to homeschool our kids he's an underground minor works out of town one week away when we comb when he's home he drinks a lot upwards of six beers a day foof every day sometimes as many as 12 2:15 so he's an alcoholic he isn't belligerent or cruel in fact he becomes a big teddy bear he's never had any consequences I try very hard not to be a nagging wife but I find but I'm finding myself becoming one over this I ask him to slow down and he says he will limit himself to four a day and he's back up to six the very next night yeah he can't because he's an alcoholic I'm afraid there's something he's going through emotionally any advice would be a godsend I don't have many people I can reach out to because I make a point not to speak negatively about my husband to our friends or family and he refuses to speak to a pastor or counselor I'm not sure how much longer our relationship can sustain this wow that's really a tough problem this is what the Irish call a good man's weakness he's not he's not a bad person but he just drinks too much so you're in a tough spot and you're not gonna be able to talk him out of drinking you can't talk an alcoholic out of drinking it so nagging him forever is not a good idea you've got four kids you're taking care of the kids that's your priority that's what you got to do you've got to get some help you have got to get some help al-anam deals with this all the time and they can help you your pastor choose what your I so respect I have to tell you I so respect your commitment to not bad-mouthing your husband outside of the house I saw respect that you got to find at least one person or Aleman which is anonymous and they are committed to not going public you got to find somewhere where you can get support and understand how to live with this guy because he's not hurting your kids he's not hurting you you don't want your kids to lose their father but he's got a problem and that means you've got a problem it's a really tough problem to deal with I'm so sorry that you're dealing with it but you got to get help because you're not gonna be able to talk about it you can stop nagging stop nagging him cuz it's not gonna work there may come a time when the children have gone and you're in the clear or if he's doing something so bad that you have to do it there may come a time when you have to give them an open ultimatum I'm you either stop drinking or I'm gonna leave if you do that you're gonna have to live up to it but right now what I would say is fine one person or al-anon and get help because you are in a situation that you can't do it alone you need help and stop nagging them because it's just not going to work I'm running out of time but I'll do a couple more Jessie hi Indra I've been married for just over a year I love my wife very much I know she has some interest in having a child however I don't feel that we're in the best place financially to have a job and I don't see that changing in the near future I'm torn I want to give my wife a child but at the same time I want to be able to provide a good life and get prepared I know it that you are never really prepared for a child I've heard Ben say on this show that he thinks that couples who are married or morally obligated to bear children for the future generation and as such as a very Jewish thing that is that's really funny that's a real Jewish tenet of Jewish law what are your thoughts on this do you feel married couples are morally obligated to have children and also should I take our financial situation into account when determining when to have a child any advice will help I don't think you're morally obligated to have children I do think children are just a great gift and my father who didn't often give good advice but he he did give me one piece of advice that actually was good which he used to say children every baby brings its own loaf of bread into the world every baby is born with its own loaf of bread and what he meant by that is I you find some way you find a way when you have a child you don't just leave him out there you're a responsible guy in love with your wife you find a way she'll find a way to bring in more money listen I love kids I wish I had more I would happily have more and so I can't tell you to have a child obviously I can't advise you to have a child but I would put it before anything you know I would put it before anything and especially if your wife wants one she's only got a certain amount of time in which she can do it it means so much when when you get older and your child is grown and you have children out in the world and you start to have grandchildren you will be so happy you will be so happy you had those children if you truly feel that it's gonna crush you then maybe try to solve that problem first but I'd have I personally I did personally I was broke when I had my first kid I was absolutely broke I wasn't broke for long I wasn't broke for long and that kid showed up I thought man somebody's gotta feed this kid and it ain't gonna be anybody else but me and I got I got rich real fast there you know kids made me rich kids made me a man they made me rich you know you solved the problem you solved the problem so I wouldn't I wouldn't solve the problem first let the kid come that will solve the problem one more from Veronica here oh wow this is my this is the Hollywood question this is the great Hollywood question dearest Andrew how do we know when dreams are just dreams and when they are attainable goals I always feel like if I had just woken up an hour earlier studied more worked harder I could have would have should have how can I know the balance between accepting that life isn't Hollywood and I probably won't be that one-in-a-million and knowing when my lack of achievement is really my fault and I can do something different you can't you can't no artists people like me we risked our whole lives we risked yeah you know when when I when I first started getting big checks for my writing people would say wow you know your write a book and you make that much money I said no I wrote 10 books and I made that much money if you prorated over all the time I spent when I had nothing all the time I spent eating noodles and you know not having not taking the promotion that another guy took instead of me because I wanted to write because I didn't want to work harder and you take all that I'm being paid just enough just they can't pay me enough for the risks that I took and how do you know every kid in Hollywood is wondering that it really is true you come out here people come out here with their dreams they come up here and out here in sacrifice they live tough and a lot of people especially writers or smart people they could be lawyers they could be you know engineers and do other professions what I would say is this however there's always some little success that keeps you going and you truly truly do not want to get to be 50 and find out that you're an ex a wannabe writer a wannabe actor somebody who didn't get to do the thing you who wasn't made picked selected to do the thing that you wanted to do so what if you take two years and pour it in put pour all your efforts into it and wake up you know if you really feel you're not working hard enough that may tell you that you don't really want to do it enough right I always joke with people do you want to be a writer or do you want to have written a book you know it's a very very different thing I love what I do I sit down and I want to do it I die if I don't do it you know it's not the having written the book it's the writing the book that matters to me I would give yourself like a deadline I really would I'd give myself a deadline because one of the things that I noticed when I looked back on my career it didn't seem like this when I was living it but the minute I got sane I started to succeed I was crazy for a long time and I finally healed that the minute I healed that I started to succeed it was almost like instantaneous or the minute I wasn't if you're not getting some kind of real feedback and I'm not talking about oh this might work and oh I got a little goose here you know after two years three years this probably isn't your game it probably isn't your game what I would say is don't be an I don't know what your dream is don't be an X ballerina don't be an X actor move on to something else life is short but life is long there's plenty of time to do the other things in your life so live out another dream find the dream you know we a lot of us all of us I think all of us are busy trying to tell God who we are let God tell you who you are let him tell you who he made you to be go do that thing leave behind the dream go do the thing that you were meant to do you know the dream may come back around you never know you never know you know it's it's very possible that if you let go of the thing you'll have time to do it in some other way it'll come back into your life if you're meant to do it but I would give myself a deadline I would live up to that deadline and I'd walk away when the dead I you know listen I did this I did this and I would you know I would have walked away if I didn't make it I would have done something else I never wanted to be an X writer that's a excellent to be writer so it's a tough question I don't I wish I could give you an absolute answer but I would say give yourself a deadline starting now live up to it and when when it's done walk away all right I can't do any more tickety-boo news I'm actually out of time but I just want to mention this one thing this I there's one hobbyhorse I have this so boring then I try not to talk about it which is regulation and how much cost regulation levies on businesses and how much freedom it takes away from us to have these unaccountable unelected agencies pass what are essentially laws and if you don't obey their laws and you want to appeal you have to appeal to the agency I think that's unfair I think it's unamerican Obama loved those regulations he ran the country with regulations he forced people to do and think and say what he wanted using regulations Trump the evil Trump the evil authoritarian Trump was secretly Hitler who's literally that is literally Hitler doesn't want to run your life he's been cutting back on the regulation there was another difference he forgot about not only did Trump go straight his book but he also didn't kill any Jews that was another thing he actually moved the embassy to Jerusalem that's just a little difference you know oh you didn't kill anybody oh they oh yeah that's that's another difference they're just popping into my head now but aside from that aside from not being evil not killing people and loving the Jews he's Hitler but but Trump has been cutting back on these regulations and what is really interesting the people during Obama the people who said there was too much regulation on business and industry soared from the average of 37 percent during the eight years of the George W Bush presidency to a whopping forty eight percent almost half the country felt there was too much regulation but now after just 21 months of the Trump presidency it is back down to 39 percent and 33 percent there's just says just that there's just about the right amount that means that they're not feeling the burden and the reason I know it's not a regulation isn't interesting but the reason I talk about it is people like me don't feel regulation so much because of the First Amendment people who talk and write for a living news people journalists they don't feel this stuff because the First Amendment protects them from regulation but if you're a farmer if you're a rancher if you run a store if you just want to braid people's hair that government comes after you only you need a license to braid people's hair yeah you know you need a bulletproof vest too you know it's kind of stupid thing you don't need a license for that stuff all this stuff is just a way of controlling you just a way of getting money out of you just a way of feeling powerful as you're sitting in your ball in your office pushing papers around it's bad stuff Trump has really done a good job dialing it back is one of the best things he's done there not one of the most exciting all right back tomorrow we're gonna have a long clay ville this weekend but it doesn't matter anymore because you've got another Kingdom so right you said cuddle up to that but I'll talk about that
