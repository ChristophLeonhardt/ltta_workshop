MANY THANKS.

00:00:07,865 --> 00:00:09,666
ARKANSAS G.O.P.

00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,034
GOVERNOR HUTCHINSON WAS ONE OF

9
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,236
THE GOVERNOR 'S DINING WITH THE

00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:12,769
PRESIDENT TONIGHT.

11
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,371
BORDER SECURITY WAS ON THE MENU.

12
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,673
HE JOINS US NOW.

13
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:17,241
GOOD EVENING.

14
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,142
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

15
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:19,776

16
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:20,444
DINNER TONIGHT WITH THE

17
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:21,044
PRESIDENT?

18
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,045
>> HE WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS.

19
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,114
HE HAD WORKED HARD ALL DAY TODAY

20
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:26,049
WITH A LOT OF NEWS HAPPENING.

21
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,384
WE TALKED ABOUT BORDER SECURITY

22
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:29,520
WITH A HANDFUL OF GOVERNORS,

23
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,488
SOME OF THEM COMING FROM BORDER

24
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,056
STATES AND WE WERE ABLE TO

25
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,292
ANSWER THE PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR

26
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:39,229
THE STATES FOR NATIONAL GUARD

27
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:40,030
RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR

28
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,531
SECURITY EFFORTS.

29
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,999
I THINK THIS IS A WAY FOR THE

30
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,333
PRESIDENT TO THANK SOME OF THOSE

31
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:43,700
GOVERNORS.

32
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,236
I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE THERE

33
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:47,037
TONIGHT.

34
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:48,839
CLEARLY WE HAD AN INCREASE IN

35
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:49,640
ILLEGAL CROSSINGS.

36
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,842
I SEE THIS AS A SEARCH

37
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:52,643
OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BETTER

38
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:55,012
HANDLE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

39
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,281
DON'T SPIKE OR CONTINUE TO GO UP

40
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,849
AND THOSE ILLEGAL CROSSINGS.

41
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:59,816
>> Mike: THE REPORTS

42
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:02,686
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS COULD BE

43
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:03,420
HOUSED AT LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE

44
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,589
BASE, HERE'S HOW KIRSTJEN

45
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:08,425
NIELSEN EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM.

46
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:09,159
>> IF YOU BREAK THE LAW AND YOU

47
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,395
HAPPEN TO BE A PARENT YOU WILL

48
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:12,429
BE INCARCERATED.

49
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,131
IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN YOU WILL BE

50
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:14,498
SEPARATED.

51
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:15,232
THAT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN

52
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:17,467
WHAT WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES

53
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:18,335
EVERY DAY.

54
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,837
>> Mike: YOUR REACTION TO

55
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:21,505
PERHAPS SOME UNACCOMPANIED

56
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:22,439
MINORS BEING HOUSED AT A BASE IN

57
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,243
YOUR STATE POSSIBLY?

58
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:27,878
>> I KNOW THEY HAVE PUT ON A

59
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:29,012
LIST OF NUMBER OF MILITARY

60
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:30,781
INSTALLATIONS OR POSSIBLY

61
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,183
HOUSING UNACCOMPANIED MINORS.

62
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,285
WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT OF

63
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:36,153
INFORMATION BUT LITTLE ROCK

64
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:39,456
AIR FORCE BASE IS ON THAT LIST

65
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:40,824
AND WE ARE ANXIOUS TO COOPERATE

66
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:44,895
AND GET MORE DETAILS ON THAT.

67
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,730
CLEARLY, AND I'VE BEEN AT

68
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,397
HOMELAND SECURITY AND I'VE

69
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:49,399
LOOKED AT THAT BORDER AND HERE

70
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,202
YOU'VE GOT A DRAMATIC INCREASE

71
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:52,903
IN THE NUMBER OF UNACCOMPANIED

72
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,605
MINORS COMING ACROSS AND YOU

73
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:55,839
HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM, YOU

74
00:01:55,839 --> 00:02:01,244
HAVE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THEM

75
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:02,112
AND IF MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IS

76
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,046
AN APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THAT

77
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:04,514
THAN I UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNMENT

78
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:05,449
LOOKING AT THOSE.

79
00:02:05,449 --> 00:02:06,883
STILL AWAIT MORE INFORMATION ON

80
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:08,050
ADDRESSING THAT VERY CHALLENGING

81
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,884
ME THAT WE HAVE.

82
00:02:08,884 --> 00:02:10,120
>> Mike: YOU MADE REFERENCE TO

83
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,523
YOUR PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY, FORMER

84
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:14,558
UNDERSECRETARY OF DHS AND ALSO A

85
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:15,025
DEA BACKGROUND.

86
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,594
TALK TO US A BIT ABOUT THE

87
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:19,830
BORDER SITUATION.

88
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,665
FOR SOME NEW IDEAS DISCUSSED AT

89
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:22,666
DINNER TONIGHT OR DO YOU HAVE

90
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:23,500
SOME THOUGHTS FROM BEING OUTSIDE

91
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,202
THE WASHINGTON BUBBLE OF THINGS

92
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:28,472
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING?

93
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:29,873
>> SECRETARY NIELSEN WAS THERE

94
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:30,207
AS WELL.

95
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,175
GREAT CONVERSATION ON THE

96
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:34,411
CHALLENGES OF BORDER SECURITY.

97
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,313
THERE'S A LOT OF TOOLS THAT ARE

98
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:38,782
NEEDED THAT CONGRESS HAS NOT

99
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:42,219
PROVIDED OUR BORDER AGENTS AND

100
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,854
OUR IMMIGRATION JUDGES SO THAT

101
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:44,988
WE CAN DIS- INCENTIVIZE ILLEGAL

102
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,690
CROSSINGS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

103
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,226
THERE ARE SO MANY INCENTIVES

104
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,193
THAT IF YOU GET ACROSS THAT

105
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,995
BORDER AND YOU WIND UP IN COURT

106
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,264
AND YOU COULD BE RELEASED, YOU

107
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:58,035
COULD FADE INTO THE AMERICAN

108
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:58,402
LANDSCAPE.

109
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,836
YOU DON'T APPEAR IN COURT.

110
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:00,871
THOSE OF THE KIND OF THINGS THAT

111
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:01,938
HAVE TO BE CORRECTED.

112
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:04,207
AS LONG AS THERE IS AN INCENTIVE

113
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:06,109
FOR THOSE TO COME ACROSS

114
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:07,644
ILLEGALLY, THAT MAGNET IS GOING

115
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:08,478
TO DRAW THEM.

116
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,414
WE HAVE TO DIS- INCENTIVIZE THAT

117
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:10,914
WE HAVE TO DIS- INCENTIVIZE THA

118
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:11,214
THAT.

119
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:12,649
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

120
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,651
CONCENTRATING ON AND IT'S

121
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,952
SOMETHING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

122
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:16,286
SUPPORT.

123
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:16,853
>> Mike: DESCRIBED THE

124
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:17,954
PRESIDENT BEING IN GOOD SPIRITS

125
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,090
BUT HE SEEMS REALLY KIND OF

126
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,458
STRESSED ABOUT THE WHOLE PORTER

127
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:21,825
SITUATION.

128
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:24,294
DID YOU GET A SENSE OF THAT

129
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:24,895
ALTERNATE?

130
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:25,328
>> ABSOLUTELY.

131
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:27,297
HE'S INTENSE ON IT.

132
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:30,233
HE'S FRUSTRATED BECAUSE OF THE

133
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,234
OBSTACLES AND IT'S SOMETHING

134
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,502
THAT HE CAMPAIGNED ON, SOMETHING

135
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:35,005
THAT HE BELIEVES IN INHERENTLY

136
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:39,276
AND WE ALL BELIEVE IN IMMIGRANT

137
00:03:39,276 --> 00:03:40,077
FLOW TO OUR COUNTRY.

138
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:41,244
IT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY

139
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:42,646
AND OUR FUTURE BUT WE HAVE TO

140
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:44,081
HAVE THE LEGAL PATH.

141
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,449
YOU'VE GOT TO CONTROL THE

142
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,850
BORDER.

143
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,584
HE FEELS VERY INSTINCTIVE ABOUT

144
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,454
THAT, VERY COMMITTED TO IT AND

145
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:51,088
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT.

146
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,122
>> Mike: 50 GOVERNORS IN THE

147
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:53,356
COUNTRY, YOU WERE ONE OF THEM

148
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,257
INVITED TO DINNER TONIGHT.

149
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:56,259
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU

150
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,427
PERSONALLY?

151
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:57,961
>> IT MEANT A LOT.

152
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,230
PERSONAL TIME WITH THE

153
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,897
PRESIDENT, IT WAS WITH SOME

154
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:03,366
OTHER GOOD GOVERNORS TALKING

155
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:05,235
ABOUT SOME VERY SUBSTANTIVE

156
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,672
ISSUES, PEOPLE OF ARKANSAS, WE

157
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:11,842
HAVE INCREDIBLE VALUE IN THE

158
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,477
RULE OF LAW SO WE APPRECIATE THE

159
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:14,644
PRESIDENT BEING COMMITTED TO IT.

160
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:18,248
IT WAS A GREAT EVENING AND I

161
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,649
APPRECIATE THE PRESIDENT'S

162
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,851
PERSONAL SUPPORT OF OUR

163
00:04:20,851 --> 00:00:00,000
NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AS THEY
