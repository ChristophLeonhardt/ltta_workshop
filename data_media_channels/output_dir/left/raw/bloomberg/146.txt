1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,760
China’s President Xi Jinping has a dream
-- or you could call it a pet project.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,820
He wants to revive China’s ancient Silk
Road.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,349
That means spurring trade along the two thousand year old routes via a network of railways,

4
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,769
ports, pipelines and highways.

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:21,120
The Silk Road project is supposed to boost development and deepen economic ties across Central Asia.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,420
But critics see it as a way for China to spread its influence further west.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,900
Here’s the situation:

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,340
The original Silk Road began as a trade route that stretched from Central China as far as Europe.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,560
In its heyday silk, spices and porcelain were transported to the west.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,240
Today Xi wants to use steel and other materials from China's over-producing factories to

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,540
improve infrastructure along the route.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:52,000
Typical plans include the development of ports in Malaysia and Tanzania or highways in Pakistan and Tajikistan.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
To help bankroll Xi’s dream-- also known
as the ‘one belt, one road’ initiative

14
00:00:56,411 --> 00:01:00,690
the Chinese government created the $40
billion Silk Road fund.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,790
Xi has said more than 30 countries signed
formal agreements with China and 20 more were

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,270
cooperating on plans such as railways and nuclear power.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,030
But partner nations are weighing economic benefits against an increasingly dominant

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,930
superpower's demands.

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,310
A deal for a rail project in Thailand fell
through because, according to Thailand,

20
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,130
there were “strings attached” -- namely China demanding commercial property rights.

21
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,840
Here’s the argument:

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,410
China says the Silk Road initiative is a way to boost industrialization in the developing

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,159
nations sandwiched between East and West.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,540
Economists agree that the initiative has the potential to stimulate Asian and global economic growth.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,439
But there are also risks - like funds not
going where they’re supposed to in a region

26
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,570
beset by corruption - and long-shot developments turning into white elephants

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:00:00,000
There is also concern about China's increasingly assertive military, particularly in Asia's waters.
