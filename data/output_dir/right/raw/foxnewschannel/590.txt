HOLDER PRIORITY DURING TENURE

FOCUS ON LEGAL RIGHTS FOR

55
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,201
TERRORISTS TRYING TO SECURE

56
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:06,170

SUPPRESSED THE KILLING OF BLACK

58
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:09,740

SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT HAVE

77
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:59,790
HAPPENED IN RECENT MONTHS.

78
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:04,662
[INAUDIBLE]

79
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:08,499
>> WHY ARE YOU SEPARATING

80
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,935
FAMILIES?

81
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,369
[SHOUTING]

84
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,440
BUSINESS OWNERS.

85
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:18,175
I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE AT

86
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,176
THE RESTAURANTS WHERE SOME OF

87
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:20,778
THE THINGS ARE HAPPENING, LIKE F

88
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:29,653
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID WHEN THEY SEE

89
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:31,355
STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENING,

90
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:31,789
ROCHELLE?

91
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,157
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE, WHEN YOU

92
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:34,692
LOOK AT IT IT REMINDS ME WHEN IT

93
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:36,694
WAS HAPPENING IN CIVIL RIGHTS

94
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:38,829
ERA WHERE AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE

95
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,865
BEING HARASSED DURING SIT-INS, I

96
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:42,266
DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT.

97
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,567
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE

98
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,969
HARASSED WHILE EATING DINNER,

99
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,403
AGAIN, FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IT

100
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:48,472
WAS A PHOTO, BUT I THINK THE

101
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:50,307
FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP HAS A

102
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:51,675
GREAT CAMPAIGN, THE BE BEST

103
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:52,743
CAMPAIGN AND SOMETHING THAT WE

104
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:54,745
CAN ALL APPLY TO DAILY LIVES AND

105
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,113
WE SHOULD START WITH HER

106
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:56,447
HUSBAND.

107
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:57,781
JILLIAN: CHRIS, FINAL WORD.

108
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:58,849
>> I AGREE WITH ROCHELLE ON THE

109
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,551
FACT THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT

110
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:01,485
PEOPLE'S SAFETY, WE SHOULDN'T

111
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:03,153
HAVE THE DISCOURSE THAT WE DO,

112
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:04,822
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS A TOUGH AND

113
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:09,660
SORT OF GAMES WHERE HE IS PUT ON

114
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,731
ECONOMY SUP AND OTHER THINGS ARE

115
00:04:15,100 --> 00:00:00,000
DISCOURSE THING.
