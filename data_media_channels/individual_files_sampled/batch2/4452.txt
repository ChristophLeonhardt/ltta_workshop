in March the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint alert this March 2018 announcing that Russian government cyber actors were targeting critical infrastructure in the US this wasn't about Russia attacking our elections and political parties this Alert for March was that the Russian government was using its hackers to target America's energy sector are quote commercial facilities and our nuclear sector how about Congress hold hearings to investigate that that seems like a serious thing and that seems like something Congress could do right now if they were so inclined if they wanted to help find a way out of this national security crisis we we find ourselves in right now there's a whole bunch of super practical super specific stuff Congress could do if they're looking for ideas here's another idea for you for nothing last month in Singapore president Trump surprised everyone by announcing unilaterally that he had agreed to cancel joint US military exercises between the US military and our allies in South Korea now this is not a concession that he traded North Korea it's not like he got something from North Korea for that this is just something he unilaterally offered we later learned that not only had the president not consulted South Korea about the fact that he was going to make that announcement he hadn't consulted the US military about that before he made that announcement we know from Wall Street Journal reporting several months ago that canceling the canceling of US military exercises with South Korea is something that President Trump was actually asked to do by another world leader according to The Wall Street Journal Vladimir Putin had asked President Trump to cancel those joint exercises last year in a one-on-one phone conversation how about Congress holding hearings on that massive policy change and it's national security implications and how that policy change came about who was consulted on it how was the president advised where did that idea come from several days before that announcement from President Trump the president again surprised everyone with his announcement that it's the new position of the US government that the g7 should become the g8 again they should invite Russia to be part of that group again never mind all the reasons why Russia was kicked out in the first place Russia should be back in that international alliance now that is something that would obviously suit Russia very well but apparently again there's no indication that anybody else in the US government was part of that decision or was consulted about it or even had noticed from the president that he was about to make that radical u-turn in US policy and announced it publicly that's a radical change in an important US policy how about holding congressional hearings on where that policy change came from right where'd the president get that idea how were other foreign policy and national security officials in our government our government involved in that shock announcement and if they weren't why not if Congress is feeling up to it they might consider holding a hearing on why senior White House official Jared Kushner took a meeting during the presidential transition with the head of a sanctioned Russian bank who personally has a Russian intelligence background the White House and that Bank have given conflicting explanations as to why that meeting happened so we don't really know why that meeting happened I mean that was a soon-to-be White House senior official meeting with the sanctioned Russian entity and we don't know why how about a hearing on that I mean yesterday literally on the same day the criminal complaint was unsealed against a Russian citizen is accused of using the NRA as a conduit to influence US political leaders on behalf of Russia literally on that same day the Treasury Department and the Trump administration announced new rules that would allow the NRA to stop disclosing its donors to the IRS right I mean these red-hot concerns and and what appears to be open federal investigations into whether the NRA might have not just been used as a conduit for Russian influence but potentially is a conduit for Russian money into the presidential election on that same day we learned that a Russian spy was being criminally accused of having pulled that off that's the day the Treasury Department announces no no we no longer need to have any sort of window into what money is flowing through the NRA and where it came from I mean if Congress was looking for something constructive to do here instead of sending sad tweets they could set about stopping the Treasury from making that change at least not till we are clear on what's going on here hey if they're too scared to investigate anything directly related to the Trump administration maybe Congress could just be persuaded to investigate themselves a little bit in this scandal I mean in the indictment from Friday all those Russian military officers indicted prosecutors alleged that a candidate for US Congress solicited and received stolen hacked information from Russian military intelligence about his or her opponent in that congressional election reasonably speaking you might think that the House Ethics Committee could look into a charge like that especially once it's included in a unsealed federal criminal indictment right the Justice Department is effectively saying that hacked information presumably from the Democratic campaign committee was stolen by Russia and then used in a congressional campaign because as stolen information it was solicited by a person who was running in the general election for a seat in the US Congress reasonably speaking you might think that the ethics committee in Congress could hold a hearing or two on whether any serving member of Congress solicited that stolen information from Russian military intelligence and thereby knowingly benefited from that stolen information to secure their own election I mean that's a person who was in the general election who either won that seat or lost it if that's a sitting member of Congress shouldn't the ethics committee look into that whether or not that person knew it was Russian military intelligence he or she was soliciting the information from soliciting stolen information to try to win your election that's illegal right pick one all of these things are specific doable totally within Congress's comfortable wheelhouse any of these things could be put in motion at any time I mean you and I may occasionally feel helpless as citizens here in the midst of this crisis but you're in Congress boy there's a lot of stuff you could do take your pick I mean here's another example one thing Congress has been sort of willing to act on in the Trump era is enforcing and levying new sanctions against Russia right even when the Trump administration objects to that well here's one last year Michael Isikoff reported at Yahoo News with multiple on the record named sources that basically in the first days of the Trump administration they to unilaterally get rid of russia sanctions quote top trump administration officials almost as soon as they took office tasked State Department staffers with developing proposals for the lifting of economic sanctions the return of diplomatic compounds and other steps to relieve tensions with Moscow it was all done in the earliest days of the Trump administration unbeknownst to the public Congress even this Congress reportedly does care about sanctions on Russia how about a hearing on what happened there with the other echelon of the Trump administration the brand new White House brand newly arrived in Washington or during their first staffers at the State Department to figure out how to get rid of those sanctions on Russia unbeknownst to the public how about a hearing on that Congress cares about sanctions do you care about trying to undermine sanctions I mean there's stuff to do we are not beetles on our backs moving our legs with no way to flip over it's work to be done here if you actually want to help this country get out of this national security crisis your hands are not tied getting the truth getting clarity holding people accountable stopping more bad stuff from happening now and in the immediate future that's at hand it's not an impossible list it's practical stuff the question is whether anybody will do it theoretically none of those things I just mentioned has any partisan cast whatsoever there's no reason why Democrats and Republicans would not work together on you know why don't we have a cybersecurity chief anymore why did Russians hacker nuclear industry why is a sanctioned banker from Russia meeting with a White House official theoretically none of that stuff has any partisan cast whatsoever Republicans and Democrats you could imagine working together on stuff like that here in the real world though in order for any of that stuff to actually happen we are probably waiting on Congress to change hands and for Democrats to win control and tonight you see some of the energy that might fuel that across the street from the White House where there is now a second day of basically spontaneous protests against the president and him siding with Russia over the American government you're gonna see it with a lot more protests all over the country tomorrow we also saw it today in a rare sign of rational cooperation by liberal groups of a whole bunch of different kinds of persuasions a big joint effort announced called the last weekend to try to recruit everyday Americans who are freaked out about what's going on in the country they're trying to make the largest grassroots effort ever assembled for a midterm election to get people to do get out the vote for Democratic candidates but also to volunteer for Democratic candidates all over the country things do feel like they're at a boil right now which can be scary because hot water is hot but it can also be useful if it means things are really starting to get cooking got a lot more to get to tonight stay with us hey there I'm
