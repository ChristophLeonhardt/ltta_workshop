I'm thrilled to be here in the Badger State with the hard-working men and women of Foxconn working with you moments ago we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for much more than 13,000 Wisconsin workers okey dokey that was President Trump yesterday at the groundbreaking ceremony for Foxconn Manufacturing's newest plant opening in Wisconsin and there was thirteen thousand jobs he mentioned might actually cost this state more than it's worth are you scratching your heads for starters Wisconsin is actually paying Foxconn for jobs as much as 3 billion bucks in tax incentives in order to bring the company to their state that is in addition to the 134 million dollars in highway improvements near the new facility and seven hundred and sixty four million dollars in local city and county tax incentives for a grand total of almost 4 billion bucks that Wisconsin is giving to Foxconn and for their part Foxconn promises to invest 10 billion dollars with the potential potential to create 13,000 jobs that is a number that the president cited so let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps they do come through with a 13,000 new jobs that still means Wisconsin is offering Foxconn 370 thousand six hundred and ninety two dollars per job for an average salary of $54,000 in fact the government analysis shows this deal will not make the state any money until the year 2020 42 joining me now to talk about it too CNBC contributor on Insogna is back and Dan Nathan a principal at risk reversal advisors a run to you that's an awful lot of money it's a lot of money and and the question with the iron ironic part about this Stephanie is that we do not have a shortage of jobs in the United States irrespective of what the White House has been saying we have six point seven million open positions 6.4 million unemployed we have a massive skills gap that keeps the open positions from being filled so well it's always nice to see jobs being created in this particularly a state like Wisconsin which probably needs the diversification to other industries it is number one expensive but two flies in the face of the reality that we're searching for jobs and not searching for workers okay Dan people are skeptical about this deal because if you remember they made a promise to Harrisburg Pennsylvania for a project it never materializes why should Wisconsin trust their pledge of of ten of potential job numbers when they don't have a history of coming through well they shouldn't have me this is a cheap political stunt in my opinion and there's multiple angles here you know Kahn is a company that employs 1.3 million workers in China okay so they're talking about thirteen thousand potential jobs in Wisconsin a state that actually has an unemployment rate of 2.8% below the national average okay so it really doesn't make a lot of sense so you think about it there's there's really one flying a two point yes can I take this it's Apple Apple computers that company that makes yeah okay make the iPhone and it says design in California assembled in China okay so you know you know 45 percent of Foxconn sales come from Apple so this is Apple I'm sure putting some pressure on Foxconn saying we're not gonna build factories in America you know why we have 40 percent gross margins and we have the most profitable electronics business that has ever hit this planet okay so you're gonna do this cheap little stunt you're gonna put a factory in Wisconsin we're gonna have our situation in China where we have they have really favorable terms with the Chinese government CEO Tim Cook child labor to an extent well right and that was Foxconn at their own factories they had 15 suicides at Apple factories back in 2010 so I think there's a lot of angles here president Trump wants to bring jobs to America 13,000 it's nothing Foxconn really wants to get these favorable terms for a factory they're getting four billion dollars in subsidies there's more does that not look like corporate welfare that hurts the Wisconsin taxpayer and hooks up a company or investors I hate to state it this way but it we've seen nothing but corporate welfare over the last several years now a bit particularly with the tax bill where half of the ESPY profits that have been reported this year had been directly the result of lower tax rates and as I said earlier the share of corporate taxes as a percentage of government revenues has fallen to a historic low so yes it's just a continuation of what has been you know what's funny though Apple is a company that over the last few years has been paying 25% yeah in taxes anyway so now you have this corporate rate of 21% and you know what they also do they've just got a an amnesty I want 90 billion or no 190 billion that were overseas so they weren't even paying us on those taxes and now they're gonna pay at 11% on that so to me this is like a three-way sort of thing between Trump wanting to bring jobs foxconn looking for those subsidies in Apple any of this trickled down and helped wages go up because we do not have a job problem we have enough we have a wage problem does any of this help our wage problem if we could fill the jobs that we had we wouldn't actually have a wage problem Stephanie I was at a cybersecurity event the other day 40,000 open jobs and cybersecurity positions around the country that pay an average of $95,000 a year for a college graduate who's just come out of school we have welding jobs that pay $100,000 a year we have trucking jobs that pay $80,000 a year all of which are going wanting for workers so were those positions to be filled which are relatively decent wages you'd see an updraft in in wages were what we're seeing right now is this massive skills gap where the jobs just can't be filled or there are people who are just refusing to take those jobs okay then can I ask for a moment president going after Harley Davidson saying all that I did for you I for one can't figure out what it is that he did for Harley Davidson but is this an example of the president getting worried that the tariffs aren't gonna work out well I don't think they have a pretty clear strategy I think the juxtaposition in Wisconsin between Harley and this Foxconn thing is really interesting and this also goes back to rotala you know retaliatory measures Apple it faces massive potential issues especially when you think about the ZTE things et supposedly just paid our government 1 million dollars in fines for doing business with North Korea and and Iran right so so here's the thing what if China was to retaliate against Apple and that's why this is a really I think this is really the main story here I really do because Apple gets 50 billion dollars their sales from China they're the only technology American technology company that's been successful you know who's not in China Google's not Facebook is not I mean every major reason yeah obviously but what I'm saying is it's like this is a massive massive market for them so I think a lot of this comes back to Apple hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep
