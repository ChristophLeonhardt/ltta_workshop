1
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:09,793
>> Tucker: HOUSE REPUBLICANS

2
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:10,528
ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO HAMMER OUT

3
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:12,096
A DEAL ON IMMIGRATION AHEAD OF

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,597
THE FALL ELECTION.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,765
THEY FEEL THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

6
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,200
FOR SOME REASON.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,334
A CURRENT DRAFT FOR PROPOSAL

8
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,969
BEING CONSIDERED BY REPUBLICAN

9
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,004
LEADERS IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN

10
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,439
PRIOR PROPOSALS BUT IT FALLS

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,073
SHORT OF WHAT THE CURRENT

12
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,642
PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON.

13
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:31,015
IT WOULD TO GIVE AMNESTY TO SOME

14
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,184
DA CA RECIPIENTS, AND ALSO IT

15
00:00:33,184 --> 00:00:34,552
WOULD CREATE MORE MERIT-BASED

16
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:35,986
LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

17
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,389
BUT IT WOULD NOT IN CHAIN

18
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,723
MIGRATION CUT OVER MIGRATION

19
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,993
LEVELS OR CRITICALLY IMPLEMENT

20
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,362
E-VERIFY TO KEEP EMPLOYERS FROM

21
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,063
EMPLOYING ILLEGAL ALIENS.

22
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:49,567
WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS PLAN

23
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:49,900
EXACTLY?

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,236
LOU DOBBS IS OF COURSE THE HOST

25
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:52,970
OF LOU DOBBS TONIGHT ON

26
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,371
FOX BUSINESS AND IT MAY BE THE

27
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:56,006
ONLY OTHER PERSON IN LIFE THAT

28
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:57,608
HAS FOLLOWED THIS SO CAREFULLY

29
00:00:57,608 --> 00:00:59,610
OVER A DECADE.

30
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,312
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

31
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,580
IT'S COMPLEX THAT I KNOW YOU CAN

32
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,949
CUT TO THE HEART OF IT.

33
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,217
>> LET'S CUT THROUGH THE

34
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:08,786
COMPLEXITY BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL,

35
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:11,989
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN IT.

36
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,527
THERE HAS BEEN NO WRITING OF TAX

37
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:16,927
AMENDMENTS.

38
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:21,365
IT'S A PREPOSTEROUS CLOSED ROOM

39
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:25,936
DEAL, ENTIRELY DRAWN UP BY THE

40
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,372
SPEAKER, WHO IS OWNED LOCK,

41
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,674
STOCK, AND BARREL BY K STREET,

42
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,243
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, THE

43
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:35,179
BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE, THE KOCH

44
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:35,813
BROTHERS AND WALL STREET.

45
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,748
SO IT WON'T BE IN FAVOR OF

46
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:40,050
AMERICAN MIDDLE-CLASS AND

47
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,586
AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES, AND

48
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:48,926
INDEED, THAT IS HIS HALLMARK FOR

49
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:49,526
20 YEARS IN THE HOUSE.

50
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,595
HE WORKS FOR K STREET.

51
00:01:51,595 --> 00:01:54,198
>> Tucker: SO WHY THE PUSH TO

52
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,734
GET THIS THROUGH WITHOUT A

53
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:57,067
DEBATE?

54
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:58,769
IT SEEMS LIKE THE REPUBLICANS

55
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,037
COULD WIN THIS DEBATE IF YOU

56
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,338
LOOK AT ALL THE POLLING ON IT,

57
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:08,812
AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE

58
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:09,380
BASICALLY ON THE SIDE.

59
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,615
>> Lou: AS YOU HAVE REPORTED,

60
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,183
YOU CAN SLICE AND DICE THE

61
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:14,618
DEMOGRAPHICS ANYWAY WANT TO COME

62
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,186
AND MORE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED

63
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,821
AND APPALLED BY THAT DILATORY US

64
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,791
AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL

65
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,026
IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY,

66
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:24,028
AND THAT IS SIMPLY THE

67
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,029
STRAIGHTFORWARD FACT.

68
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,665
BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN RAISE A

69
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,334
VOICE THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY

70
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,803
COMPARABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF

71
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,004
THE ESTABLISHMENT AND GLOBAL

72
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,373
ELITES WHO ARE DEMANDING CHEAP

73
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:36,774
LABOR.

74
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,542
AND THAT IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

75
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:42,079
IT IS YOUR PURPOSE TO BRING MORE

76
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,816
IMMIGRATION INTO THIS COUNTRY

77
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:47,584
AND TO PRESERVE LOWER WAGES.

78
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,820
JUST AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

79
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,388
WAGES RISING, THE MIDDLE CLASS

80
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:51,955
IS NOW GROWING.

81
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:55,793
IT WAS STAGNANT AND IT DECLINING

82
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:58,228
FOR 20 YEARS UNTIL

83
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,563
PRESIDENT TRUMP MOVED INTO THE

84
00:02:59,563 --> 00:02:59,963
OVAL OFFICE.

85
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,099
>> Tucker: IS A YOU ARE SAYING

86
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,966
THE CURRENT REPUBLICAN

87
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,301
LEADERSHIP IS WILLING TO IGNORE

88
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,236
THE BASIC LEFTS ON THE LAST

89
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:07,538
ELECTION AND THE EXPRESSED WILL

90
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:08,405
OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION IN

91
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,240
ORDER TO SERVE THE INTEREST OF A

92
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,775
VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE TO

93
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,012
PAY THE BILLS.

94
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:15,779
B6 ABSOLUTELY.

95
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,915
AND RYAN IS A LAME DUCK SPEAKER,

96
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,317
HE WILL ONLY BE IN OFFICE UNTIL

97
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:22,786
JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR, HE

98
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,153
RESIGNED.

99
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,556
BUT THAT'S ALL THE REPUBLICAN

100
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:26,457
CONFERENCE CAN DO IN THE HOUSE

101
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,791
OF REPRESENTATIVES.

102
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,160
HE IS NOW IN FRANCHISE WITH THE

103
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,029
LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE AND ALSO

104
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,597
WHAT WOULD BE ASSUREDLY A LOSS

105
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:34,698
OF 50 SEATS IN THE MIDTERM

106
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,134
ELECTIONS AS A RESULT OF MOVING

107
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,635
INTO THE AMNESTY OF THIS.

108
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,238
THE PACE WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS

109
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,742
FOR ONE MINUTE, NO MATTER HOW

110
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:45,376
POPULAR THE PRESIDENT IS.

111
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,978
AND HE IS WILDLY POPULAR.

112
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,214
NO MATTER THE FICTIONS THAT ARE

113
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:53,183
SPUN UP BY RYAN AND HIS

114
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:57,321
SO-CALLED LEADERSHIP COUNCIL.

115
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,188
>> Tucker: DO THEY HAVE

116
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:00,624
POLLSTERS WHO ARE TELLING THEM

117
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:03,961
THAT POLITICALLY, THIS IS SMART?

118
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,429
>> Lou: NO.

119
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,497
THEY HAVE WELL-PAID STRATEGISTS

120
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:07,231
TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD RUN ON

121
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:10,167
THE TAX CUTS, RATHER THAN THE

122
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,737
TRUMP AGENDA, WHICH IS THE TAX

123
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,873
CUTS, DEREGULATION, BALANCING

124
00:04:15,873 --> 00:04:19,009
INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CREATING

125
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:19,810
JOBS, BRING IT BACK

126
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,478
MANUFACTURING, DEALING WITH ALL

127
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,581
THE IMPORTANT ISSUES IN FOREIGN

128
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:26,016
POLICY, WHETHER IT IS THE

129
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,317
IMMENSE AND     AN END SUCCESS O

130
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:27,951
IMMENSE AND     AN END SUCCESS F

131
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:27,985
IMMENSE AND     AN END SUCCESS T

132
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:28,218
IMMENSE AND     AN END SUCCESS E

133
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:29,420
SINGAPORE SUMMIT, WHICH IS JUST

134
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,193
ONE OF A LITANY OF ACHIEVEMENTS

135
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,629
THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS IN

136
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,634
UNPRECEDENTED ACHIEVEMENTS.

137
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:49,973
IT IS ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

138
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:51,475
>> Tucker:          >> Tucker: R

139
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:51,508
