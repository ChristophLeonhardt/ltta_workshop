MULTIPLE STUDIES HAD
INDICATED THAT AUTO LOAN
COMPANIES WERE MARKING UP LOAN
PRICES FOR MINORITIES AND AS A
RESULT, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU UNDER THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN 2013
PAST GUIDANCE INDICATING IF
ANYONE IS CAUGHT DOING THAT
THEY WILL BE SUED AND THEY WILL
HAVE TO PAY GIANT FINES.
NOW UNDER THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND BECAUSE OF A
CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION, THAT
DIRECTIVE WILL BE REPEALED.
LET ME GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
THIS DOESN'T ONLY HAVE TO DO
WITH RACE.
IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH GENDER SO
WOMEN WERE ALSO FOUND TO
GET CHARGED HIGHER INTEREST
RATES FOR INSTANCE WHEN IT
CAME TO THESE AUTO LOANS OR
HIGHER MARKUPS.
EVER SINCE THIS HAPPENED IN
2013,
THE AUTO INDUSTRY WAS LIKE WE
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS WE HAVE TO BE VERY
AGGRESSIVE AND THEY WERE AND
THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY
WANTED.
THE CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION WAS
A BIPARTISAN EFFORT.
DEMOCRATS WERE INVOLVED AS WELL
AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE
NAMES OF THOSE DEMOCRATS IN 
A
MOMENT.
THIS INFORMAL GUIDANCE WAS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THOUGH
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO GO AFTER THE
LENDERS THAT WERE CALLED TO
BRING THESE PREDATORY PRACTICES
SO FOR INSTANCE, ALLY FINANCIAL,
HONDA AND TOYOTA FACED LAWSUITS
AND HAD TO PAY $100
MILLION IN FINES FOR DOING THESE
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES.
ALLY FINANCIAL PAID 100
MILLION IN 2013
AND HONDA AND TOYOTA 10'S OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
THAT IS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY,
TO BE FAIR TO THE REPUBLICANS,
IT IS PAINTED IN THE PRESS AS
SOMETHING UNPRECEDENTED BECAUSE
THEY ARE TAKING WAY AND IN
INFORMAL POLICY BUT THAT
INFORMAL POLICY WAS USED TO LEVY
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN FINES SO IT IS AN IMPORTANT
PIECE OF POLICY AND THE
FACT THAT IT IS INFORMAL I DON'T
THINK REALLY HAD AN EFFECT.
THEY WANT UP USING IT ALL THE
TIME SO I DON'T THINK THAT
IS THE HEART OF THE ISSUE.
THE HEART OF THE ISSUE IS THERE
A STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWING
THEY DO DISCRIMINATE AND THAT IS
PART OF WHY THEY DEALER MARKUPS
BECAUSE THEY GET TO CHARGE
SOME PEOPLE EVEN MORE THAN
OTHERS, SO THIS IS TAKING AWAY
MONEY FROM THEM AND WHEN THEY
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE,
THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY A FINE.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET CAUGHT.
THE REPUBLICANS COME INTO THE
RESCUE GOING THESE POOR CAR
DEALERSHIPS, BEING ABUSED BY THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMANDING
EQUALITY.
WE WILL NOT LET THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE GET AWAY WITH IT ANYMORE.
YOU GO BACK TO A TIME OF
INEQUALITY AND LETTING THE
CAR DEALERSHIPS DO BASICALLY
WHATEVER THEY WON THE
STEELER MARKET MARKET*YOU GUYS
HAVE A?
IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN,
LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T SEVER
DISCRIMINATION, YOU ARE BLACK OR
WOMAN, BUT THE REPUBLICANS
NOW SAY TRUST THE CAR
DEALERSHIPS, LET THEM TO
THE DEALER MARKUP, THEY PROBABLY
HAVE YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND.
REALLY?
EVEN IF YOU HAVE A RED HAT ON,
YOU REALLY THAT STUPID?
DON'T WORRY, THEY WILL SELF
REGULATE.
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL
PROTECTION BUREAU IS
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO PROTECT
THE CONSUMER.
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT AND
CONGRESS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THERE TO REPRESENT YOUR BEST
INTEREST AS AN AMERICAN AND
AS A CONSUMER BUT THAT IS NOT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING HERE.
THEY ARE DOING THE EXACT
OPPOSITE.
IT IS OBVIOUSLY NO SURPRISE THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO REPRESENT
CORPORATE INTERESTS WHEN YOU
HAVE MONEY IN POLITICS AS
OPPOSED TO THE INTERESTS OF THE
PEOPLE BUT THIS IS, IT'S SO
BRAZEN.
NO, WE WANT TO GIVE THESE AUTO
LOAN COMPANIES THE ABILITY
TO MARKET INTEREST RATES FOR
PEOPLE BASED ON GENDER OR
RACE, WHY NOT?
WHY WOULD WE WANT THAT?
AGAIN, DEMOCRATS WERE INVOLVED
IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN SO THE
SENATE VOTED ON THIS AND JOE
MANSION WAS THE ONLY
DEMOCRATS SENATOR THAT VOTED
IN FAVOR OF REVEALING
REPEALING THIS DIRECTIVE AND
WHEN IT CAME TO THE HOUSE
THERE WERE 11 DEMOCRATS.
LET'S PUT THE GRAPHIC UP.
JIM COOPER.
LOU CORREA, JIM
COSTA, 11 DEMOCRATS.
THESE ARE ALMOST ALL BLUE DOG
DEMOCRATS, CONSERVATIVE
BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF
THEM HAVE PROGRESSIVES THAT
ARE PRIMARY THEM.
GO TO JUSTICE DEMOCRATS.COM
AND FIND OUT WHO THEIR
OPPONENTS ARE IN MAKE SURE YOU
VOTE FOR THEM.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TELLS ME
THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT OVER
PEOPLE LIKE STEPHANIE MURPHY.
NO, BECAUSE HER BOAT IS
IMPORTANT.
I KNOW, HER VOTE IS IMPORTANT
WHEN SHE HELPS REPUBLICANS
REBUFF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
NOT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT US AND
PROTECTING THE CITIZENS, SO I
KNOW WHICH WAY STEPHANIE MURRAY
VOTES AND JOE MANCHIN, REMEMBER
HOW HE PRETENDED TO BE
PROGRESSIVE AND VOTED AGAINST
TRUMP A LOT SO THE PRIMARIES ARE
OVER AND SO IS JOE MANCHIN
PRETENDING TO BE OF REGRESSIVE.
NOW HE IS VOTING WITH TRUMP IN
ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE.
ALSO, MICK MULVANEY WHO IS
THE HEAD OF THE CONSUMER
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU IS
HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND IS
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REPEAL OF
OTHER DIRECTIVES THAT WERE DONE
UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
TO PROTECT YOU, THE CONSUMER.
WE CAN ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.
BY THE WAY, COMPANIES DON'T PAY
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN FINES IF THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LAWYERS
AND THEY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT
AND THEN FINALLY REALIZED,
WE ARE TOTALLY CAUGHT,
TOTALLY GUILTY, WE WILL GET BACK
SOME OF THE MONEY THAT WE
RIPPED OFF FROM YOU BUT DON'T
WORRY, NOT ANYMORE.
THEY WON'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY
OF IT BACK, THEY CAN JUST KEEP
RIPPING YOU OFF BECAUSE
REPUBLICANS ARE IN CHARGE.
