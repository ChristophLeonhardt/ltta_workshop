“All of us who are seeing
these images
of children being pulled away
from moms and dads in tears,
we’re horrified.”
Ted Cruz has proposed
emergency legislation
to end the Trump administration policy
of separating families
that cross the border illegally,
a policy facing increasingly
bipartisan criticism.
“This has to stop.”
This is not the
first time
Cruz and Donald Trump
have found themselves
at odds with each other.
“Donald, you’re
a sniveling coward.”
“This guy's a liar.”
There was not much that
Cruz and Trump
left unsaid in the
lead-up to the 2016 election.
“Donald is a bully.”
“Lyin’ Ted.”
“Lyin’ Ted.”
“Lyin’ Ted Cruz.”
“This man is a
pathological liar.”
“Nobody likes him.”
“Utterly amoral.”
“A little bit of a maniac.”
“Donald, relax.”
“Go ahead, I'm relaxed.
You’re the basket case.”
It all came to a
spectacular showdown
at the Republican
National Convention
when Cruz refused
to endorse Trump.
“Vote your conscience.”
Even as the crowd
turned up the heat.
“Endorse Trump!
Endorse Trump!”
But then,
shortly before
the election,
he did a full 180,
voicing his support
for Trump after all.
Since then, the
epic feud
has been lost
in the annals of history,
as Cruz aligned himself
with the president.
“This is an
all-star cabinet.
You look at Judge Gorsuch.
And then you look at
the executive action.
Or on the economic side.
I think we’ve seen a lot of strong
substance
in this opening month.”
Fast forward to now.
Cruz’s main rival is
no longer Donald Trump,
but Representative Beto O’Rourke,
a Democrat now gunning
for Cruz’s Senate seat.
O’Rourke is breaking Texas
Democratic fund-raising records
and seeking to ride
a wave anti-Trump furor
all the way to Washington.
“No wall is needed.
The U.S.-Mexico border has
never been safer
than it is today.”
If O’Rourke won in the
November midterms,
he would be the first
Democratic senator
from Texas to be elected
in over two decades.
“Texans don’t want to see
a return to the high-tax,
high-regulation, high-spending 
days of Barack Obama."
And while Cruz still
has a significant lead
in the latest polls, the race
has been closer than expected
and Republicans
have taken notice.
So after Cruz extended a
hand into the future
in a radio interview
with Breitbart in April —
— Trump also let go
of any bad blood on his side.
“Full endorsement for this man.
Ted Cruz. Where’s Ted?”
And this is how,
with their eyes
set on the prize,
even two old rivals seem to
have seen the ancient wisdom
in party loyalties and
pragmatic alliances.
What remains to be seen,
is whether their alliance
can survive this latest controversy.
