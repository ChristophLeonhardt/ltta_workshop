1
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,399
So, inside the machine what happens
is that we have the granulate coming in.

2
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:31,340
It's been mixed with the dye
and then it's being melted,

3
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,748
heated up until about
250 degrees Celsius.

4
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:38,790
And so it's being pushed into the
machine and under very big pressure

5
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,210
it's being molded into Lego bricks and
then it's being spit out in the other end.

6
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,749
When the box is full, then
an A.G.V., which is a robot, it

7
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,210
will come and pick it up.

8
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:59,499
It will drive it over to a conveyor
belt, which transports it through

9
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:03,700
the entire factory to the high bay
warehouse, where it's being stored,

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,519
also by robots until it's
needed for packing.

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,810
So, once the box enters the high bay
warehouse, the crane, it puts it into

12
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,240
a random space area on the shelves, because
it always remembers exactly where

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,040
all the more than 420,000 boxes are.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,160
The fantastic part of the job is that we
do actually build with the Lego bricks.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,749
We do actually come up with
these crazy creative concepts.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,249
I think we're up to almost 300
designers, and

17
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,460
with that many people there
we need a lot of bricks.

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,439
So, we have every Lego brick that's
in production right now

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,440
and every color that's in production.
And to just see that quantity

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:00:00,000
and that variety of Lego bricks is
just â€” it's awe-inspiring.
