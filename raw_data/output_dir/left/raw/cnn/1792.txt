1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,370
and this is something I always had to
emphasize to my staff when I was

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:14,790
president better is good you laugh but
sometimes people forget that I will take

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:23,609
better every time so that's what's
needed today the engagement of everyone

4
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,730
who wants to see a better future for our
children and it can be frustrating I'll

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,899
take an example here in the United
States over the past eight years

6
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,989
thousands upon thousands of Americans
threw themselves into the collective

7
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,460
effort of reforming our health care
system those of you who live in

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,539
countries that already have universal
health care are trying to figure out

9
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:55,210
what's the controversy here I am too
these people

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,330
but you know the folks who did the work
it wasn't just policy wonks it wasn't

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,909
just politicians it was moms and dads
people who had the experience of a sick

12
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,290
child or crushing medical bills that
threatened to bankrupt them maybe a

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,330
parent who was lost to cancer that had
that person got a regular checkup it

14
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:34,440
might have been caught earlier and those
voices from every walk of life in every

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,700
court of the country against all odds
made a difference and for the first time

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,300
more than 90% of Americans know the
security of health insurance paying more

17
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,320
for insurance or being denied insurance
because of a pre-existing condition or

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,229
because you are a woman that's not a
thing anymore we got rid of that and

19
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:02,429
people are alive today because of it and
that's progress now the legislation that

20
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:10,169
we passed was full of things that still
need to be fixed it wasn't perfect but

21
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,450
it was better and so when I see people
trying to undo that hard-won progress

22
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,060
for the 50th or 60th time with bills
that would raise costs to reduce

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,380
coverage or roll back protections for
older Americans or people with

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,569
pre-existing conditions the cancer
survivor' the expecting mom or the child

25
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:38,660
with autism or asthma for whom coverage
once again would be almost unattainable

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,580
it is aggregated and all of this being
done without any demonstrable economic

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:54,450
or actuarial or plain common-sense
rationale it it frustrates and it's

28
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,830
certainly frustrating to have to
mobilize every couple of months to keep

29
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:05,629
our leaders from inflicting real human
suffering on our constituents but

30
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,049
typically that's how progress is won and
how progress is maintained on every

31
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,900
issue
we have to stand up for each other

32
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,760
recognize that progress is never
inevitable that it often can be fragile

33
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,850
it's in need of constant renewal and our
individual progress and our collective

34
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:38,370
progress depends on our willingness to
roll up our sleeves and work and not be

35
00:03:38,370 --> 00:00:00,000
afraid
