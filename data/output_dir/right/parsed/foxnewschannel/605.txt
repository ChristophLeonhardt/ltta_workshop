LITTLE MORE CASUAL.
I COME UP FROM WASHINGTON AND
GOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A STORY, A
FEDERAL JUDGE IN DC WANTED TO
RESTART THE DACA PROGRAM.
PRESIDENT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE
THE DACA TO SHIELD CHILDREN
BROUGHT BY THEIR PARENTS FROM
BEING DEPORTED.
THAT.
AND EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYS
CONGRESS, YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
THIS JUDGE SAYS THEY NEED TO
RESTART IT.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
>> MY FIRST THOUGHT IS I KNOW
MY POINT OF VIEW ON IMMIGRATION
IS DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF OUR
VIEWERS AND I EXPECT THE THREE
OF YOU AS WELL.
I AM FOR DACA.
COMPASSIONATE AND PRAGMATIC.
WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA DID, THESE
KIDS WERE BROUGHT HERE AT A
YOUNG AGE THROUGH NO FAULT OF
THEIR OWN, THE RIGHT THING TO
AND HE WANTS TO END THE
PROGRAM.
WHAT THE JUDGE DID IN THIS CASE
WAS NOT TO SAY THE TRUMP
FOR RESCINDING THE PROGRAM AND
THE REASON THEY PUT FORTH THE
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY AND
OTHERS WERE POLITICAL RHETORIC,
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE TRUMP
AWAY A RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE.
--
>> YOU EXPECT IT WAS.
>> ONLY IF THE RATIONALE IS
LEGAL.
NOT JUST SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT.
THE ARGUMENT WAS GIVEN, AND
EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATED THIS,
WHY CAN'T AN EXECUTIVE ORDER
AND DO IT.
YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
INVESTED IN THIS PROGRAM, THEIR
LIVES ARE SETTLED, THEY HAVE
BEEN HERE 10 YEARS OR MORE.
SOME ARE MARRIED, THEY HAVE
CITIZEN CHILDREN.
THIS IS A BAD ARGUMENT FOR
DONALD FROM.
DONALD FROM.
>> IF HE TELLS THESE DREAMERS,
IF YOU GIVE ME $25 BILLION TO
BUILD THE WALL THAT IS A
COMPROMISE THAT MAKE SENSE.
LET'S JUST MAKE IT A STRAIGHT
COMPROMISE DEAL.
>> A COMPROMISE DEAL IS A
REMINDER CONGRESS IS A HUGE
