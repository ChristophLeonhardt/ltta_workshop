Coble has been relatively peaceful in recent weeks but this was as bad as anything the city has witnessed in months the target was a private building in the shear part of town where young men and women were studying for university exams the classroom was destroyed for roof blown away Oliver the testament to the ferocity of the attack the suicide bomber is assumed to have targeted them because they were Shia then so suspicion immediately fell on ISIL ace has done this sort of thing before though not often with such devastating results added to that there were serious questions about the emergency response I'm a student at the training center I came out and just after 4 o'clock I heard a huge explosion I rushed back to my class I saw dozens of dead bodies and wounded people for about 30 minutes there was no police presence at all no ambulance service and people were carrying the wounded students to the hospitals for all that the ambulances did arrive to do what they could there by the time they got to hospital the lines of body bags told their own story there are six dead bodies in the morgue and all of them are female their bodies have been burnt and torn into pieces assuming this was the work of ISIL it only serves to demonstrate the level of threat civilians continue to face in Afghanistan with gazni having come under attack from the Taliban in recent days as well the country remains perilously unsafe Lawrence Lee al-jazeera
