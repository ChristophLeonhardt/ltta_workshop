1
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,090
“If you look at what’s
happening with trade in China,

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,300
it hasn’t been fair
for many, many years.”

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,410
When President Trump
rails against China,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,520
he says things like, “Our country
is being taken advantage of,”

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,520
or, “We lost years ago
by presidents and others

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,290
allowing this to happen.”

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,930
He’s probably referring
to the past four decades,

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,860
when China has grown faster than
any major economy in history

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,900
and gone from a poor,
developing country

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,350
to an economic powerhouse
that is challenging America’s

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,140
spot at the top of the
international food chain.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,920
“Its emergence as a global power
was so sharp and so extreme,

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
faster than the world
can handle,

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,300
in some ways faster than 
China can handle.”

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,070
The U.S. and other
Western nations

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,600
kick-started much of China’s
rise by opening up trade.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,230
What they haven’t
figured out

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,080
is how to get this fundamentally
different economic system

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,270
to play by free market rules.

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,660
A pivotal moment came in 2001
after 15 years of negotiations.

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,312
China joined the World
Trade Organization,

22
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:01,160
which sets the rules for 
free and fair trade

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,730
between member countries.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,190
“All of the countries that
were in the club at the time

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,490
put enormous demands on China
for what they needed to do.”

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,680
The Chinese committed to
sharply lower tariffs

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,760
and reduced some of the government’s 
role in how business gets done.

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,480
But they argued then, 
as they still do now,

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,630
that China is
a developing country

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,980
and so should be held to less
stringent free trade standards.

31
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,470
The hope was that these
first steps

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,180
would lead to even more 
sweeping changes.

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,430
“Why did we assume that?

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,280
The experience of communism was 
through the lens of the Soviet Union

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,924
and its satellite states, which
was ultimately not a success.

36
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:37,450
And so the presumption was,

37
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,590
China’s going to want
to become like us,

38
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,520
more market oriented.”

39
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,190
“After China joined
the W.T.O. in 2001,

40
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,900
you saw this enormous
surge of Chinese exports

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,760
to everywhere in the world,

42
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,250
and to the United States in particular.”

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,090
“They were kind of an elephant
hiding behind mice with respect

44
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,040
to other countries in global
trade negotiations at the time.”

45
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,570
The U.S. and other countries

46
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,660
complained that China was not
opening its markets enough,

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,360
and keeping the value of its 
currency artificially low

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,030
to make Chinese exports 
more attractive.

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,430
“China has been
making great strides

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,650
using tools that are
really not acceptable

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,630
under the global trade system.”

52
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,840
China has continued to operate
as a centrally planned economy.

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,180
The government owns,
influences or subsidizes

54
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,437
major industries, giving them
an artificial competitive edge.

55
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:35,520
There are heavy restrictions
on foreign investment,

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,978
and foreign companies
are pressured

57
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,370
to share their technologies.

58
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,690
“China has become
more market oriented,

59
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,160
but dating back to
probably 2007, 2008,

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,580
I think it was recognized
that China wasn’t on the path

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,890
to become more like us.

62
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,080
And so then countries
began to think about, well,

63
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,320
what do we do instead?”

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,030
“Some view the rise
of Asia-Pacific

65
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,430
with suspicion and fear.

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,700
America doesn’t.”

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,870
Enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

68
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,290
initiated by Bush, 
signed by Obama.

69
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,600
“When implemented, It 
won’t just boost trade

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
and support jobs in
our 12 countries.

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,980
It will help set
stronger rules for trade

72
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,600
across the Asia-Pacific.”

73
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,400
Put less politely, It was also
supposed to be a bulwark

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,540
to China’s growing
economic power.

75
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,720
“The idea was that China would
want to join this great trading pact,

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,020
and so they would
have this incentive

77
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,060
to reform their economy.”

78
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,940
“This is the one that
President Trump ripped up

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,920
on his third day in office.”

80
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,470
“The first one is 
withdrawal of the United States

81
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,470
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,910
“I had seen the erosion of popular
and congressional support

83
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,240
for trade for many years.

84
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,570
But I’d never seen anything
like Donald Trump.”

85
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,960
“Our founding fathers
understood trade

86
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,980
much better than our current
politicians, believe me.”

87
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,460
Trade is generally accepted
by economists as win-win

88
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,140
for countries on the whole.

89
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,910
But Trump says that
China is winning

90
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,040
and the U.S. is losing.

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,520
“He and people in
his administration

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,740
argue that past approaches to 
dealing with China haven’t worked.

93
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,070
It’s not actually that profitable 
to negotiate with them.

94
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,149
We need to focus on this
much bigger trade measure,

95
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,670
and then we can really hit
them with a very aggressive,

96
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,010
forceful action.”

97
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,400
“He seems intent on generating
a moment of crisis.”

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,710
“We put a $50 billion tariff on,
then we put a $100 billion tariff on.

99
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,580
And you know at a certain
point, they run out of bullets.”

100
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,050
But dynamics have changed.

101
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,690
Today, China sees its
economy is strong enough

102
00:04:39,690 --> 00:00:00,000
to withstand almost anything
the U.S. can throw at it.
