1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,520
HURRICANE MARIA HAS

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,620
COMPLETELY DESTROYED POWER AND
ELECTRICITY IN PUERTO RICO AND

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,559
AT THE MOMENT, WE DON'T HAVE A
NUMBER OF FATALITIES, HOWEVER,

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,410
AUTHORITIES ARE EXPECTING SOME
DEATHS AS A RESULT OF THIS HUGE

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,340
HURRICANE THAT HAS GONE FROM
CATEGORY FIVE TO CATEGORY FOUR,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,250
BACK TO CATEGORY FIVE AGAIN.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,150
SO
IT'S BEEN CREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,810
AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
PHOTOS YOU WILL GET A SENSE OF

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,060
JUST HOW SEVERE THE STORM WAS.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,820
UNOFFICIAL FOR THE GOVERNOR OF

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,920
PUERTO RICO HAS RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING THAT IN TERMS

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,489
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE, PUERTO
RICO WILL NOT BE THE SAME.

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,489
THIS

14
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,520
IS SOMETHING OF HISTORIC
PROPORTIONS AND HE ALSO SAYS

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,240
THAT IT'S A TOTAL DEVASTATION
AND THEY HAVE LOST 100% OF THEIR

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,460
POWER, MEANING THAT IT'S
DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,980
OFFICIALS THERE AND KIND OF GET
AN ESTIMATE IN TERMS OF THE

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,230
DAMAGE AND WHETHER OR NOT LIVES
WERE LOST, BUT IT'S TERRIBLE BY

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,230
ITSELF.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,840
THIS NATURAL DISASTER
IS BAD BY ITSELF, BUT YOU ALSO

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,210
HAVE TO TAKE THE ENTIRE CONTEXT
IN MIND.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,210
WHAT PUERTO RICO IS

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,530
DEALING WITH IN TERMS OF THEIR
ECONOMIC SITUATION AND THIS

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,270
JUST ADDS INSULT TO INJURY AND
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEM.

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,670
IT IS DEVASTATING.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,640
IN TERMS
OF HOW QUICKLY SOME HISTORICAL

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,200
FACTS ABOUT THIS HURRICANE IN
PARTICULAR, IT IS THE 10TH MOST

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,549
INTENSE HURRICANE THAT HAS COME
AND HIT OUT OF THE ATLANTIC AREA

29
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,549
EVER.

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,939
IT IS THE MOST INTENSE
HURRICANE, AND IN TERMS OF AN

31
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,110
DENSITY, THAT'S A MEASURE OF
BAROMETRIC PRESSURE NOT

32
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,409
WIND SPEED.

33
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:39,009
YOU HEARD THAT IT'S A
CATEGORY FOUR HURRICANE WHEN A

34
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,180
HIT LAND ALL BUT IT WAS JUST SHY
OF A CATEGORY FIVE WITH A

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,060
HUNDRED AND 55 MILE-PER-HOUR
WINDS.

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,820
ITÃ­S THE MOST INTENSE

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,870
HURRICANE TO HIT PUERTO RICO
SINCE BEFORE THE GREAT

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,549
DEPRESSION AND THE DEVASTATION
IS REALLY UNTOLD AND THERE WERE

39
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,840
PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD BY ONE OF
THE HEADS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
COMMITTEES TO EVACUATE OR DIE.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,119
THOSE OF THE WORDS THAT THEY

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,539
USED AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
TERRIFYING FOR THESE PEOPLE WHO

43
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,500
KIND OF, WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER
A HURRICANE, THERE ARE TWO SIDES

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,920
TO IT AND THERE IS THE LEADING
EDGE AND THE TAILING EDGE.

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
THE

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,620
LEADING EDGE HIT PUERTO RICO HEAD
ON BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEND IN

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,570
RESCUE WORKERS WHEN THEY HAVE
WINDS OF THIS SPEED BASICALLY

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,900
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY
LIKE EITHER BUNKER DOWN OR GET

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
OUT IF YOU CAN.

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,270
THE OTHER
PROBLEM WITH GETTING OUT IS EVEN

51
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:33,410
TOURISTY WERE IN THE AREA OR
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE ESCAPING

52
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,390
THE OTHER ISLANDS IN THE AREA
FROM THE PREVIOUS HURRICANE

53
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,860
WERE BASICALLY TRAPPED IN
PUERTO RICO AND THEY COULDN'T

54
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,290
LEAVE THE ISLAND.

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,920
THERE WERE TOURISTS THAT WERE
STUCK IN HOSTELS AND CNN SPOKE

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,410
TO A COUPLE OF THEM AND THEY
SAID, LUCKILY, THE PEOPLE

57
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,280
RUNNING THE HOSTILE OR TAKING
GOOD CARE OF US AND WE FELT

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
SAFE.

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,640
THERE WERE OTHERS WHO
SAID, THE BUILDING THAT WERE IN

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,690
FEEL STABLE BUT WHAT WERE REALLY
CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE FLOODING.

61
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,700
THEY SAID, IF YOU ARE IN A
FLOODPLAIN, A FLOOD PRONE AREA

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
YOU WILL DIE.

63
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,400
THEY SAID IF YOU
ARE IN A WOODEN HOUSE, YOU WILL

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
DIE.

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,830
IT IS TERRIFYING AND THAT
MIGHT BE A HYPERBOLE TO MOTIVATE

66
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,750
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE TO A
SAFER AREA, BUT YOU ARE TALKING

67
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,200
ABOUT THE LAST HURRICANE, DID
YOU HEAR ABOUT DELTA FLIGHT 431?

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,260
NO.

69
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,410
DELTA FLIGHT 431 WAS THE LAST
FLIGHT TO FLY IN PUERTO RICO TO

70
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,990
GET PEOPLE OUT AND THERE WAS HIS
AVIATION BLOGGER WHO WAS JUST

71
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,680
KIND OF PAYING ATTENTION AND
LOOKED AT THE AVIATION MAP OF

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,291
WHERE ALL THE PLANES WERE NEVER
ONE WAS HEADED AWAY AND HE

73
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,900
NOTICED ONE IS TOTALLY JUST
GOING TO PUERTO RICO AFTER

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,010
EVERYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND HAS
TURNED AWAY AND PEOPLE STARTED

75
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,010
FOLLOWING IT AND IT STARTED TO
TREND A LITTLE BIT AS EVERYONE

76
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,490
WAS LIKE, I SEE IT, THERE'S KIND
OF A BAND THAT THEY MIGHT BE

77
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,321
ABLE TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH
AND SO THEY GO IN AND THEY

78
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:55,340
LANDS, I'M GETTING CHILLS RIGHT
NOW TALKING ABOUT IT, THEY LAND

79
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,830
BETWEEN THE TWO BANDS AND THEY
GET IN AND FROM THE FLIGHT

80
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,800
ATTENDANTS ON BOARD, IT TAKES A
WHILE TO GET, AND THIS WAS A

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,280
FULL ON 737 OR EQUIVALENT.

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,580
THIS
IS A 3 X 3 PASSENGER MIDSIZE

83
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,520
JETS AND THEY GOT EVERYBODY OFF
AND ON IN A TIME THAT NO ONE

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,950
WOULD EVER THINK POSSIBLE.

85
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,839
THEY
SHIFTED THE DEPARTURE EARLY.

86
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,238
MOST PEOPLE ARE LIKE, ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

87
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:22,590
THEY WERE LIKE WE'RE LEAVING
EARLIER OR WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

88
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,590
YOU

89
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,120
CAN TRACK THE WHOLE THING
ONLINE.

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
YOU CAN WATCH IT TRY TO

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,590
TAKE OFF INTO THE WIND BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE WIND AND

92
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,080
YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT LIKE, THAT
IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR A PLANE

93
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,850
TO TAKE OFF, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
HEADWIND THAT IT CREATES THE

94
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,040
CORRECT PRESSURE FOR THAT PLANE
A TAKE OFF.

95
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,910
LOOKING YOU GETTING ALL
SCIENTIFIC.

96
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,100
IT'S NOT.

97
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,720
SOME AVIATION

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,040
PROFESSIONALS THAT TOOK THE LIFE
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND THEN

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,940
ALSO PLACED THEIR LIVES AND THE
LIVES OF OTHERS IN THE HANDS OF

100
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,560
OTHER AVIATION PROFESSIONALS TO
EXECUTE THAT AND IF YOU LOOK AT

101
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,150
IT, IT WAS A RIDICULOUS
TURNAROUND.

102
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,150
BUT IN TERMS OF

103
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,500
WHERE THIS ONE IS GOING FOR
PEOPLE WHO ARE WONDERING WHAT'S

104
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,560
HAPPENING NEXT, IT'S MOVING ON
BY THURSDAY.

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
IT SHOULD BE IN

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
TURKS AND CAICOS, SOUTHEASTERN
BAHAMAS AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING,

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,260
IT'S TOO EARLY AS GET TO
DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,280
ACTUALLY MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
UNITED STATES.

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
IT LOOKS LIKE

110
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,220
MOST MODELS ARE SAYING THAT IT
STAYS OUT.

111
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,341
IT GAINS A LITTLE
BIT

112
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:21,280
MORE STEAM ONCE IT MOVES ON FROM
WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW AND THEN

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,690
IT STARTS DISSIPATING AS IT'S
MOVES UP ALONG THE ATLANTIC

114
00:05:23,690 --> 00:00:00,000
COAST.
