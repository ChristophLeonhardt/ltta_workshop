The house is kind of asking you
all the time to
act slightly differently than
you normally would.
And you notice that you're
acting differently.
So then you interact with the
fact that you notice it.
I can feel the space working
on my feet.
So you know, it's kind of that your feet are
grabbing the floor all the time.
It is a geometric space, but it's
an inconsistent geometric space.
And that's my favorite feature
because it's constantly not
where you think it is.
It's weird that you are in a room
that you don't know where the room is.
I find myself using
the building to navigate myself.
Which usually you don't push
on the walls in your house when
you're walking in your house 
but in this house you do.
You push the walls, you pull the
pillars.
You know everything and
especially in the bathroom,
where you have to walk around
the tubular shower in a tubular space,
I'm always kind of, putting
your shoulder into the side of
the space to negotiate it.
Yes, that's kind of nice.
You know, you are kind of hugging,
hugging the space.
You don't hug a house usually.
