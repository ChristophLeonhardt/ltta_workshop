Elizabeth Warren apparently is now speaking out about how she is a Native Americans she's speaking to the Native American native Indian conference of some such or other I'm not sure what exactly is the National Congress of American Indians that's what it was she made a surprise appearance at the National Congress of American Indians and apparently she was just she was incredibly great I mean she was she was just full-on regalia she showed up with the headdress she showed up with it with the smoke and peace pipe the whole deal and again whenever I say things like this is not because I'm mocking Native American cultures because I'm knocking Elizabeth Warren for appropriating Native American heritage okay so here's what she said to the Native American Conference quote by all accounts my mother was a beauty I know Elizabeth Warren by the way and she is one of the more obnoxious humans on planet Earth by all accounts my mother was a beauty she was born in eastern Oklahoma on this exact date Valentine's Day in February 14th 1912 she grew up in the little town of Wetumpka the kind of girl who'd sit for hours by herself playing the piano and singing my daddy fell head-over-heels in love with her but my mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship so in 1932 when my mother was 19 and daddy had just turned 20 they eloped okay so she doesn't provide any evidence by the way that she is of Native American heritage at all like no like zero evidence and then she says this is my favorite line but I get why some people think there's hay to be made here you won't find my family members on any rolls and I'm not enrolled in a tribe right so she's openly admitting that she's not enrolled in a tribe that you won't be able to plant any of her family members on the Native American roles remember the record-keeping for Native American heritage is extremely good right it is very in-depth which is why you can have situations where legitimately the government will come and take somebody who's a quarter Native American out of their foster home and bring them back to a reservation because of how good the roles are right but this is the best part she says quote our stories are deeply woven into the fabric of who we are the stories of immigrants and slaves of explorers and refugees have shaped and reshaped our country right up to the present day for far too long your story has been pushed aside to be trotted out only in cartoons and commercials so I'm here today to make a promise each time someone brings up my family's story I'm gonna use it to lift up the story of your families in your communities and that last line there as Alex Griswold says at free beacon all right that is called using the Native America community is your political human shield every time someone calls her Foca haunt us every time president Trump watches it and calls her Pocahontas every time that happens she's simply going to shift it and say Native Americans are so important Native American heritage is so important ever mind the fact that we call her Foca haunt is because she's been lying about her Native American heritage I mean she's as Native American as Shaun King as black apparently hey the idea the Shawn came by the way his his father was white his mother was white on the birth certificate he says that his mom had an affair there's no evidence that any of this is true the same thing is true of Elizabeth Warren she suggests that she is Native American there is no evidence that at all that Elizabeth Warren is Native American how much would joke is her Native American heritage it's such a joke that Elizabeth Warren used as evidence of her Native American heritage the fact that you submitted a recipe to a cookbook called I kid you not powwow chow that was the name of the cookbook and the recipe that she actually submitted was a recipe for crab bisque hey which it turns out she she actually copied from a copy of Good Housekeeping or something it turns out that crab bisque is not actually a Native American heritage thing because crabs are not wandering across the fruited Plains of Oklahoma which is where his rum so she's a joke
