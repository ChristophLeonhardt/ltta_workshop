so our first question is why why is AOL having its layoffs dragged on and on and the the real reason is there's two separate layoffs going on here back in December there was the voluntary buyouts AOL said then that it needed to cut its workforce by about a third that's about 2,500 employees so it told its employees hey if you want to lay off yourself here's a package it's a little bit more generous than what will offer if we involuntarily fire you so only 1,100 employees took them like took the voluntary buyout and so that means that about 1400 still need to be fired that's what's going down this week and again they're dragging on a little bit more because a will fire some people on Monday it's letting more people know today and then most of the people it'll fire tomorrow you know that's a little bit damaging to drag it out like that I can't imagine why they wouldn't have just tried to do it in one day you know AOL lost offices in Sweden Spain it's going to sort of refocus its European efforts in the UK we've understood that fewer than 500 people will be fired in dulles and in New York and that has a lot to do with the WARN Act which gets us to tips for negotiating a big fat severance deal because look if you're an AOL or you should you should listen up we can help you get a better deal so don't sign anything right away that's that's the most important thing that you should consider no severance package is take it or leave it you need to negotiate but big thing is don't negotiate while you're still in shock go home watch a movie because your family come back the next day of the day after and here's another thing talk to other people who are getting laid off you need to find out who else is getting cut and what their severance package is like you you need to find out specifically if people who are higher tenure have longer tenure than you or shorter tenure than you slot them in figure out what they're getting and you need to make sure that if there's a pattern that's established that your your sentence packaged properly fits that pattern someone was a shorter tenure than you should not be getting a better it's packaged than you and if you see someone who is the you know the big thing here to remember is that it doesn't bet benefit anybody to not talk except for AOL they just fired you so talk to other people and figure out you getting the best deal so and here's the thing no how many people in your office getting fired because you know the WARN Act might apply they say it doesn't you might want to talk to a lawyer to make sure that they agree so make sure they continue your health benefits make sure make sure you're getting the bonus you earned last year and in fact make sure you're getting paid for all of your accrued benefits ask for outplacement services and get here's the big here's the big one get advice from a professional like you know we can try to help you here but really call someone talk to someone this is a big change in your life talk to someone to make sure that you're getting all the best advice you can so anyway this is you ask we answer i'm nicholas carlson thanks again for joining us talk to you next week
