00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:03,540
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about apple and first I want to</font>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,279
start the two big takeaways here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple we think is going to become more</font>

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a services business over the next</font>

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">several years that's going to take a big</font>

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,259
shift in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how they approach the</font>

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,759
market a negative impact on

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,560
profitability but ultimately a longer

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,369
impact on growth and visibility second

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:21,570
is we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are two big</font>

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,039
markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can go after which is</font>

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,980
augmented reality and also auto so there

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is hope around future market segments</font>

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,439
one big misconception is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple is</font>

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,329
missing everything and they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:34,649
growing and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes from</font>

17
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,239
investors looking at the growth rates

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,579
and it's been pretty low over the last

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,170
couple years if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the market</font>

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,850
cap of applets down four percent in the

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,710
last two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> where Google is up</font>

22
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty-two percent and Facebook is of</font>

23
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">fifty two percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that kind of fuels</font>

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">disbelief there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one thing that Apple</font>

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,079
has missed which is the low on phone

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,489
market and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the key takeaway</font>

27
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,620
there is that we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

28
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,270
approach that market with more of a

29
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,329
services first approach moving to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,190
iphone at sixty-six percent of revenue

is seventy-three percent of earnings

32
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,010
ultimately this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big segment for</font>

33
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,659
obvious reasons in terms of the growth

34
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,180
rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it stepped up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the iphone 6 and</font>

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty-seven percent its dropped back</font>

36
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,770
off with its down ten percent more

37
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,290
recently we do expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iphone to</font>

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,020
try to lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> often terms or steady off</font>

39
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,880
in terms of growth rate at ten percent

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,490
in part because the upgrade cycle we

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,960
think ultimately is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be more</font>

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,869
powerful the lag<font color="#CCCCCC"> between upgrades has</font>

43
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,060
been extending and people are holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

44
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,710
to their phones longer it's now 33

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,979
months versus before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was 28 months</font>

46
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">SPS on the iPhone jumped up with the</font>

47
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,189
iphone 6 but they've been kind of all

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,310
over the place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last two years</font>

moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> near-term one of</font>

50
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,460
the reasons why we're optimistic about

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,229
the iphone is that everyone still wants

52
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,579
an iphone it's not about a big feature

53
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,799
it's just in general tie on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wish</font>

list our consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams show that seven</font>

holiday versus five percent a year ago

57
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,540
that's the highest ranked product of any

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,070
product that's on the wish list<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

59
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,860
holiday the number two is the ipad<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the mac at two percent and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font>

61
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,649

62
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,959
this whole scene that<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple doesn't have</font>

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,420
exciting

64
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,130
products isn't necessarily resonating

65
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,300
with consumers and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

66
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that they're going to invest in</font>

67
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:19,360
unfortunate you're going to have to wait

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,830
for that iphone because the lead times

69
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,470
are a couple weeks one of the other

70
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons why we're positive about the</font>

71
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,610
iphone more longer term is this massive

72
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,560
wave of upgrades that's coming the

73
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,910
longer the people hold on to their

74
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">iPhones the bigger the base of the</font>

75
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,270
upgrades and we can go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and model</font>

76
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,890
that out and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> base is going to reach</font>

77
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">around 300 million units</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next few</font>

78
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,930
years to put that 300 million units into

79
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,690
perspective is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Apple has at their</font>

80
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,569
peak in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone 6 they did 235</font>

81
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,790
million so in other words is this big

82
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,519
base of<font color="#E5E5E5"> old iPhones essentially should</font>

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,140
carry the iphone growth for the next

84
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,569
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in terms of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone 10</font>

85
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,040
there's a lot of focus on what the

86
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,650
expectations obviously OLED which would

87
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,209
be a wraparound screen and would look

88
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,600
more futuristic<font color="#CCCCCC"> VR and AR as another</font>

89
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,360
piece Apple's been talking more about AR

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,250
recently and we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can</font>

91
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,530
shift from their typical playbook of

92
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,030
being a fast follower to actually

93
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,750
innovating around AR with the iPhone 10

94
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,690
the AR<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device of choice is going to</font>

95
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,670
be the phone for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next five years</font>

96
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,650
eventually it moves to a wearable but

97
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,570
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now with the iphone 7 plus the</font>

98
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,250
dual camera there's depth mapping so

99
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,709
they can do more with AR but look for

100
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,670
that to be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

101
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,500
differentiating features not just it

102
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,700
looks a little bit different but the

103
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,400
whole AR theme with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the iPhone 10</font>

104
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,780
shifting to services this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really our</font>

105
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,510
big takeaway is that services<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

106
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,579
is twelve percent of revenue it's going

107
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a 28 billion dollar business next</font>

108
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,510
year that compares to Facebook which is

109
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,670
expected to be a 36 billion dollar

110
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,489
business the primary part of the

111
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,950
services business is the App<font color="#CCCCCC"> Store and</font>

112
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,859
sixty percent the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> is iTunes and</font>

113
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,590
then the balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25% of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iCloud applecare</font>

114
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,630
and Google that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> google search</font>

115
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,450
revenue<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple pay is in there but it's</font>

116
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,819
so small it really doesn't add up the

117
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,739
growth rates are particularly impressive

118
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:11,470
around services<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though the numbers</font>

119
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,269
are getting higher and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to</font>

120
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,829
complicating more difficult the growth

121
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:16,750
rate has been accelerating we're

122
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,940
modeling forward to go from 17 to twelve

123
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,440
percent next year but that's pretty

124
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,479
conservative i think that there's reason

125
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,190
that this can be a much bigger business

126
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,630
as we talked about

127
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,210
there's a little boost that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

128
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,590
business is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get on December</font>

129
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,830
15th with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Super Mario run which will be</font>

130
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,660
a ten-dollar app there are also being

131
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,670
more aggressive in terms of buying apps

132
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,260
and trying to sell you different

133
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,920
services here's one for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 240 dollar</font>

134
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,590
year option for cloud storage but

135
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,120
overall apps are just generally getting

136
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">more expensive if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

137
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
selling apps on desktop right now

138
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,350
there's a $300 for final cut $200<font color="#CCCCCC"> Logic</font>

139
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dropbox has a 750 dollar pro option</font>

140
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,290
it's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> annual subscription apple takes</font>

141
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,880
fifteen percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so just over a</font>

142
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,740
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars and that's pure margin</font>

143
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,080
on the phone side it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

144
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,480
gaming just looking at pokemon you can

145
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,250
buy pokemon coins from a dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

146
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,740
to honor dollar packages but the concept

147
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,210
of how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are spending in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mouth</font>

148
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,450
of their spending is increasing the key

149
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,580
takeaway<font color="#CCCCCC"> from today's presentation is</font>

150
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,530
what we're suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple do not the</font>

151
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that they're going to do this but</font>

152
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,220
to shift to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a services model right now</font>

153
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,230
apples profit first which means they try

154
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,400
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of money when they cell</font>

155
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,340
phone that's resulted in small market

156
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,740
share in the world for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their phones but</font>

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,030
hardware profits overall they have a

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">20-percent operating margin profit first</font>

160
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,320
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different than the right</font>

161
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,480
approach which is product first that's

162
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what Google and Facebook do</font>

163
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,580
and in a product<font color="#CCCCCC"> first approach they try</font>

164
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,500
to build user<font color="#CCCCCC"> bases examples would be</font>

165
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,110
what's app and google maps<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by doing</font>

166
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,020
that it yields much higher margins so

167
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,270
when you put this together we think is

168
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple focuses more on services that can</font>

169
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,220
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more profitable business today we</font>

170
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it has a 40-percent operating</font>

171
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,030
margin about fifty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher than</font>

172
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,970
the overall<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple business so how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

173
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,190
they actually do this and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

174
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they could grow their current 1</font>

175
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,290
billion active devices and the thirty

176
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,630
seven dollars a year per user and the

177
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,190
way they do that is by reducing the

178
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">price of the iphone potentially doubling</font>

179
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,120
the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> share of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the iphone this</font>

180
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,640
would cause their current stronghold in

Latin America Eastern Europe and Asia

183
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,260
and ultimately we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to</font>

184
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a more profitable more sustainable</font>

185

193
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,980
asp's have been astonishingly resilient

194

they're down<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourteen percent during</font>

195
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,650
that time which is a surprise the ipad

now nine percent of revenue the growth

has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been all over the board it's</font>

bottomed out last year in 2015 at down

<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty two percent it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

to be down about ten<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent this year</font>

202
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,180
the ASP saw bump up with the iPad pro

203
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,330
but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the board the</font>

204
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,370
takeaway from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipad is that this is</font>

205
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,710
probably not really a growing business

be flat but it is an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of</font>

208
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,810
the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when we think about</font>

209

<font color="#E5E5E5">the services approach it's an important</font>

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,300
part of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people interact with the web</font>

compares to Fitbit which is about two

the top three grossing apps on appletv

at the top 100 retailers we've seen
