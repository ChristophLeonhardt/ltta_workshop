THE GOP IS ROLLED OUT THEIR
BLUEPRINT FOR THE TAX PLAN, AND
SEVERAL MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS
INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
AND NEW YORK TIMES HAVE GOTTEN
THEIR HANDS ON IT.
BEFORE WE GET
INTO THE DETAILS WE DO KNOW, LET
ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE MANY DETAILS WE DON'T
KNOW.
FOR INSTANCE, WITH THESE
MASSIVE TAX CUTS HOW DOES THE
GOP INTEND TO MAKE UP FOR THAT
LOST REVENUE?
ESSENTIALLY WHO
ENDS UP PAYING, THAT IS UNCLEAR,
AND ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE SAYING
WELL, WE ARE JUST GOING TO LET
THE TAX PEOPLE FIGURE THIS OUT.
AND IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.
BUT
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, THOSE
WHO EARN THE LEAST, WHO PAY
ABOUT 10% IN FEDERAL TAXES,
WOULD END UP PAYING 12% UNDER
THIS PLAN.
SO TAXES ACTUALLY DO
INCREASE FOR THE LOWEST EARNERS.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME MORE
DETAILS --
SO AGAIN, THOSE IN THE LOWER
END OF THESE TAX BRACKETS, THOSE
WHO PAY 10% IN FEDERAL TAXES,
WOULD END UP PAYING 12%.
BUT THE
GOP IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO
INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE
CAN DEDUCT SO THAT WILL MAKE UP
FOR IT --
SO PEOPLE 
WHO AREN'T THEIR
CHILDREN, FOR INSTANCE.
THERE'S MORE, THERE'S A LOT
MORE, BUT WHAT IS YOUR TAKE
ON THIS, GUYS?
FIRST OF ALL SIMPLIFYING THE
TAX CODE, HAVING SEVEN BRACKETS
AND DROPPING IT DOWN TO THREE,
THAT'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT -- THAT
DOESN'T MAKE IT SIMPLER.
IT JUST
MAKES -- IT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT
TO CUT MORE TAXES FOR MORE
PEOPLE, THAT'S ALL.
IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT THE OTHER BRACKETS
ARE, YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT ONE YOU
ARE IN, THERE COULD BE 38, JUST
FIND THE ONE YOU'RE IN AND
THAT'S THAT.
SO THEY ARE
PRETENDING, AND THEY WILL DRIVE
HOME THE SIMPLICITY OF IT, BUT
THE FACT IS THE TAX CODE WON'T
GET SIMPLER, THE RICHEST PEOPLE
WILL STILL END UP PAYING FAR
LESS, AND I SUSPECT ON THE
DEDUCTIONS THEY ARE PROBABLY
RIGHT, THAT RAISING IT FROM 10
TO 12 FOR THOSE AT THE VERY
BOTTOM WON'T DO ANYTHING,
BECAUSE THEY WILL ZERO OUT
ANYWAY AND THEY ARE CLAIMING
THAT MORE PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE
0% TAX BRACKET.
I'M DUBIOUS OF
ANYTHING THEY CLAIM BUT RAISING
THE STANDARD DEDUCTION IS
SIGNIFICANT.
BUT MERELY
PRESENTING A TAX PLAN WHERE YOU
RAISE THE LOWEST RATE AND LOWER
THE TOP RATE IN THE COUNTRY WITH
SCANDALOUS INCOME INEQUALITY
JUST SEEMS LIKE AS PUZZLING A
DECISION AS A MAJOR POLITICAL
PARTY COULD MAKE, BUT OF COURSE
IT'S THE DECISION WE KNEW THEY
WOULD MAKE.
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT
WHENEVER THERE IS A DEMOCRAT IN
OFFICE, FOR INSTANCE WHEN OBAMA
WAS IN OFFICE, THERE WAS A LOT
OF EMPHASIS ON THE DEBT.
WHAT
ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE DEBT AND
THE DEFICIT?
AND THEY CLAIM THEY
ARE FISCAL CONSERVATIVES, BUT IN
REALITY YOU HAVE TOM PRICE USING
PRIVATE JETS FOR TRAVEL TO
PLACES WHERE HE HAS PRIVATE
PROPERTY, AND NO PROBLEM WASTING
TAXPAYER MONEY ON STUFF LIKE
THAT, AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME
THEY ARE PUSHING FOR A HUGE LOSS
IN REVENUE.
NOW THIS STORY JUST
BROKE SO ANALYSIS HASN'T BEEN
DONE YET THE KIND OF FIGURE OUT
EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE U.S.
WOULD LOSE IN REVENUE, BUT I'M
SURE IT'S GOING TO BE
SIGNIFICANT, ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT
THEY ALSO WANT TO DO AWAY WITH
THE ESTATE TAX.
THEY ARE SO NONSPECIFIC ABOUT
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO TO COVER
THOSE LOSSES.
THEY WON'T BE
TAKING INASMUCH MONEY SO HOW ARE
THEY GOING TO PAY FOR THINGS
LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY?
I HAVE NO
IDEA.
SO IMMEDIATELY I THINK,
DON, I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
THE ESTATE TAX AND THE
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM WOULD BE
REPEALED, THEY WANT TO DO AWAY
WITH THE ESTATE TAX, THAT OF
COURSE WOULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF
REVENUE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AND
THEY WANT TO LOWER THE CORPORATE
TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 20%.
I
WOULD ACTUALLY BE MAYBE OKAY
WITH THAT, OR AT LEAST A LITTLE
MORE RECEPTIVE TO THAT, IF THEY
ACTUALLY DO AWAY WITH THE
LOOPHOLES THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN USING.
SO
IN SOME CASES SOME OF THE
LARGEST, MOST PROFITABLE
CORPORATIONS DON'T PAY ANYTHING
IN FEDERAL TAXES.
IN FACT IN
SOME CASES THEY ACTUALLY GET TAX
REBATES.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK
AT ON AVERAGE THE TAX RATE, THE
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, FOR THESE
CORPORATIONS, IT'S ABOUT 18.7%
AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE
LOOPHOLES AND DEDUCTIONS THEY
CAN USE.
SO IF YOU DO AWAY WITH
THE DEDUCTIONS AND MAKE THESE
CORPORATIONS PAY 20%
THEN WE ARE HAVING A
CONVERSATION.
AND THEY ARE JUST GOING TO
KEEP LYING, AND THAT'S THE KEY.
THERE ARE NO DETAILS HERE,
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ANYONE TO
RUN BECAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING WE
ARE GOING TO ELIMINATE MANY OF
THE PERSONAL DEDUCTIONS THAT
AFFLUENT FAMILIES USE -- WHICH
ONES?
SO WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT
WILL SCORE, BUT WE KNOW THEY
WILL LIE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
OBFUSCATE THE TRUTH.
TABLE KEEP
SAYING AMERICAN CORPORATIONS
CAN'T COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL
MARKETPLACE, BUT OUR ECONOMY AT
LEAST ON THE CORPORATE LEVEL IS
THRIVING.
THE DECEIT AND THAT IS
EVIDENT IN WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY
IN THE STOCK MARKET, IT COULDN'T
BE DOING BETTER.
SO THEY CAN
OBVIOUSLY STAND TO PAY MORE OF
THEIR FAIR SHARE.
BUT I AGREE,
IF THIS PREVENTS COMPANIES FROM
PAYING ZERO -- BUT OF COURSE IT
WON'T.
IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR US TO
SUPPOSE IT MIGHT, THERE IS
ZERO CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING.
AND TO BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE
OTHER COMPONENT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT, THE ARGUMENT IS THAT IF
WE JUST LOWER THE CORPORATE TAX
RATE THEN THESE CORPORATIONS
WILL DEVELOP NEW JOBS AND THAT
WILL HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS.
IT'S
PART OF THIS WHOLE NOTION OF
TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.
IT NEVER WORKS.
IT DOES NOT WORK, WE HAVE SO
MANY CASE STUDIES TO PROVE THAT.
IN JANUARY TO INTERCEPT IT A
GREAT JOB PROFILING SEVERAL BIG
CORPORATIONS -- CISCO, G.E.
--
WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THE TAX
BREAKS, WITH THAT EXTRA MONEY?
AND IN CALLS WITH THEIR
INVESTORS, IN LEGAL FILINGS, IT
SHOWS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT
ALL THEY DO IS USE THAT MONEY TO
CONSOLIDATE, ACQUISITIONS, AND
THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER
ACQUISITIONS?
THEY LAY A BUNCH
OF PEOPLE OFF, SO PEOPLE
ACTUALLY LOSE THEIR JOBS AS A
RESULT OF THESE TAX CUTS.
SO
IT'S JUST ABSURD.
THE BEST CASE STUDY FOR IT IS
THE 80S, THAT'S THE CASE STUDY
TO CITE, WHICH IS THAT THEY DID
ENACT THESE SORTS OF THINGS, IT
DIDN'T WORK, AND WE WERE PAYING
FOR IT WELL INTO THE 90S. AND
PROBABLY STILL TODAY, I'M NOT AN
ECONOMIST OBVIOUSLY -- BUT FOR
THEM TO GO BACK TO THIS, I KNOW
TRUMP HAS AN APPEAL TO PEOPLE
WHO LIKE THINGS SIMPLIFIED AND
THAT WAS KIND OF THE WAY HE RAN
AND THAT'S ABOUT AS NICE A WAY
AS I CAN SAY THAT, THIS WILL
LOOK SIMILAR TO PEOPLE.
SOMEBODY
CAN SAY I WAS PAYING X PERCENT
WHEN I WAS PAYING X PERCENT
BEFORE, BUT LIKE SO MUCH ELSE
THAT HAS COME SO FAR FROM THIS
ADMINISTRATION, MOSTLY DUE TO
EXECUTIVE ORDERS BECAUSE HE
CAN'T GET A DAMN THING PASSED,
IF IT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER THERE
IS SOMETHING HIDING BEHIND IT.
HERE IS THE DEAL, YOUR TAXES
ARE COMPLICATED.
THEY ARE
COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE RUN THE
COUNTRY WITH THE MONEY YOU PAY.
AND EVEN IF YOUR TAX RATE IS
25%, IT WILL BE 12% FOR SOME OF
THE MONEY YOU MADE IN 25% WHEN
YOU REACH A CERTAIN LEVEL
BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS HOW IT IS,
IT'S COMPLICATED.
YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOME MONEY INVESTED, IF YOU
DON'T HAVE MONEY INVESTED AND
JUST MAKE A SALARY YOUR TAXES
ARE ALREADY MORE SIMPLE, YOU
FILL OUT A 1040 EZ, THE WORD EZ
IS RIGHT IN THERE.
YOUR TAXES
ARE COMPLICATED BECAUSE RUNNING
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS
HARD, WE NEED TO RAISE BILLIONS
TO MAKE THE COUNTRY GO.
YOU
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT, YOUR
ACCOUNTANT DOESN'T, OR YOU FILL
OUT THAT SIMPLE FORM.
YOUR LIFE
WON'T BE MADE BETTER BECAUSE
INSTEAD OF SEVEN TAX BRACKETS
AND A BUNCH OF OTHER NUMBERS,
THERE ARE NOW THREE.
IT MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE, ONE NUMBER WILL ONLY
APPLY TO YOU.
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO
YOU, BUT IT'S NOT IN THE
COMPLICATION OR SIMPLICITY OF
YOUR TAXES.
IT MAKES A
DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE
TUITION YOUR KIDS PAY FOR
COLLEGE, BECAUSE PUBLICLY FUNDED
COLLEGES RECEIVE THEIR MONEY
FROM THE MOST PART FROM THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IT HAS AN
IMPACT ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN
YOUR STATE, THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT FUNDS PARTIALLY
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.
ALL
THESE THINGS PEOPLE ENJOY WILL
BE SACRIFICED IN ORDER TO GET
THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS A HUGE
TAX CUT, IN ORDER TO GIVE
CORPORATIONS A HUGE TAX CUT, AND
IT'S ALL BEING DONE WITH THIS
RIDICULOUS IDEA THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS ARE GOING TO MAYBE
TRICKLE-DOWN SOME OF THAT WELL
FOR YOU, MAYBE CREATE SOME JOBS.
BUT AGAIN, CASE STUDY AFTER CASE
STUDY PROVES THAT ISN'T THE
CASE.
CAN I READ A QUOTE THAT GOT
ME?
THIS IS FROM TALKING POINTS
MEMO -- CORPORATIONS SEE THEIR
TOP TAX RATE CUT FOR A PERIOD OF
FIVE YEARS COMPANIES CAN
REDUCE HOW MUCH THEY PAY BY
IMMEDIATELY EXPENSING THEIR
INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL GOODS.
THE
, NEW BENEFITS WILL BE GIVEN TO
FIRMS IN WHICH THE PROPHETS
DOUBLE AS THE OWNERS PERSONAL
INCOME.
THEY WOULD PAY AT A 25%
RATE DOWN FROM 39.6.
THIS
CREATES A POSSIBLE LOOPHOLE FOR
RICH INVESTORS, LAWYERS,
DOCTORS, AND OTHERS, BUT
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY
THEY WILL DESIGN MEASURES
TO PREVENT ANY ABUSES.
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT
THOSE MEASURES MIGHT BE.
AND ALSO, I'M TELLING YOU,
THEY WON'T. PAUL RYAN WON'T,
THEY WON'T. THEY AREN'T
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
AND THE
NOTION THAT THOSE SENTENCES
STILL EXIST -- THE
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THE TAX PLAN
IS FOCUSED ON MIDDLE-CLASS
FAMILIES, MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES
WILL FARE POORLY BECAUSE THEY
DON'T CARE.
DOES ANYONE THINK
THE KOCH BROTHERS ARE SAYING
WE'VE GOT TO GET MIDDLE CLASS
FAMILIES -- DAVID?
ONE OF THEM
IS NAMED DAVID?
DAVID SAYS TO
MYRON --
CHARLES.
WHERE IS MYRON?
THAT
CONVERSATION ISN'T HAPPENING
WITH MYRON OR CHARLES OR DAVID
KOCH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
BY THE WAY,
REALLY QUICK WHEN IT COMES TO
DEDUCTIONS, THEY AREN'T CLEAR
ABOUT WHICH DEDUCTIONS OR
LOOPHOLES THEY WILL DO AWAY WITH
IN ORDER TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS
OF REVENUE BECAUSE THEY DON'T
PLAN ON DOING AWAY WITH
DEDUCTIONS.
BUT THERE WAS ONE
DEDUCTION I WAS REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
DEDUCTION THAT REALLY DOES HELP
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES, AND
THAT'S THE MORTGAGE INTEREST
RATE DEDUCTION, RIGHT?
AND
LIKELY BASED ON THIS BLUEPRINT
THEY WON'T TOUCH THAT.
EVERY
TIME THIS TAX DEBATE COMES UP
AND REPUBLICANS SAY WE WANT TO
DO AWAY WITH SOME OF THESE
DEDUCTIONS, THE FIRST DEDUCTION
THEY TALK ABOUT IS THE MORTGAGE
INTEREST RATE DEDUCTION, BUT
THEY SAY THEY WON'T TOUCH THAT.
THAT IS HELPFUL TO PEOPLE BUT
THAT'S SOMETHING WE DECIDED ON
YEARS AGO.
IF WE WERE GOING TO
OVERHAUL OUR TAX PLAN, OUR TAX
CODE, WE COULD DO IT BUT I GOT
NEWS FOR YOU, IF LOGICAL PEOPLE
DECIDE IT THAN THE RICH ARE
GOING TO PAY MORE THAN WE MIGHT
DO AWAY WITH THE MORTGAGE
DEDUCTION AS PART OF A MASSIVE
OVERHAUL THAT ACTUALLY HELP THE
MIDDLE CLASS, BUT WE'VE HAD
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION GET
USED TO THAT MORTGAGE DEDUCTION
AND COUNT ON IT SO NOW IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S SOMETHING VITAL WE
WOULD BE TAKING AWAY SO IT'S
PROBABLY HERE TO SAY.
IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR
HOMEBUYING AND ALSO FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE IN THE BUSINESSES THAT
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT AS
WELL, THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING.
A COUPLE POLITICAL THINGS TO
REMEMBER, NONE OF THIS CAN
HAPPEN UNTIL THERE IS A BUDGET
PASSED AND UNTIL SOME OF THE
MOST EXTREME RIGHT-WING
CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE HERE WHAT IS IN THIS THEY
ARE GOING TO VOTE ON IT, AND
THEY WON'T APPROVE A BUDGET
UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT IS IN THIS
BECAUSE THEY WANT THIS TO BE
EVEN MORE HARSH THAN IT IS ON
PAPER NOW.
THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO
RUN OUT OF MONEY, THEY WANT US
TO NOT HAVE A BUDGET, THAT'S
THEIR DESIRE, IS TO HAVE THE
GOVERNMENT BE SO SHORT OF CASH
THAT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT -- THAT
EVENTUALLY THEY HAVE TO
PRIVATIZE ALL THE SERVICES THE
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES, BECAUSE
THAT IS THE COUNTRY THEY WANT TO
LIVE IN.
TO SOME EXTENT I ADMIRE
THE FEW WHO ARE HONEST ABOUT
THAT.
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THEM
WHO ARE THAT FRANK ABOUT IT.
I
TOTALLY DISAGREE, I THINK IT'S
HEARTLESS AND FOOLISH AND
UN-AMERICAN, AND CERTAINLY NOT
CHRISTIAN, WHICH I AM NOT BUT
THEY CLAIM TO BE --
AND WOULDN'T WORK.
THAT THE OTHER PART, IT
WOULDN'T WORK.
AND THE OTHER
POLITICAL STORY IS THAT THE
PERSON WHO IS HAPPIEST ABOUT
THIS IS MITCH MCCONNELL BECAUSE
IT'S NOW OVER IN THE HOUSE AND
HE CAN STEP AWAY FROM WHAT HAS
BEEN A HORRIBLE RUN FOR HIM, AND
NO BEGINS WHAT I IMAGINE WILL BE
A BAD RUN FOR PAUL RYAN.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
PHOTOS OF A HAPPY, JOYFUL MITCH
MCCONNELL FINALLY.
YOU WILL LOOK
LIKE THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THIS.
