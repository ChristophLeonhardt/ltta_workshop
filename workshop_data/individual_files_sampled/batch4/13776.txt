while the West is consumed with the saga of Kanye West I think that it is important to to give an update on the situation regarding Alfie Evans who's this two-year-old child in Great Britain so this two-year-old child in Great Britain almost two has been condemned to die by the British courts his parents want to remove him from Britain the Italian government has sent a plane the Italian government has said the day will provide for his medical care in Italy and the British government is saying no we will not let him out and this is like Pharoah we will not let him go we will not let him go to save his life because he must die with dignity and we say that death with dignity means dying in our Hospital at our behest number one the idea of dying with dignity is such an insulting term I mean just the very terminology of dying with dignity is really bizarre because everybody is gonna die and the suggestion that if you cling to life that somehow you lack dignity or the suggestion that if you meet your end be it being sad about your impending death that this means that you are somehow lacking encourage that there is a dignified way to go in the dignified way to go is in a hospital surrounded by people who are pumping juice into you or alternatively the dignified way to go is for us to unhook a baby and watch that baby suffocate to death because the baby can't breathe properly doesn't seem super dignified to me you know everybody has to face death your choice is an adult is how to face it but as a child there's no such thing as dying with dignity there just isn't because you're not capable of dignity as a two-year-old okay I have a two-year-old boy he's not capable of dignity he's capable of pooping in his pants and being cute okay this is what my two-year-old is capable of he's awesome I love him dignity ain't on the menu and but the idea that you're gonna take a two-year-old who's dying of a horrible brain disease and then say this child has to die with dignity it's such a stupid insulting term it's it's just a ridiculous term and beyond that the the arrogance of these folks to say that they know more than the parents about what is best for the child than what's best for the child is to die without this experimental treatment who the hell are they to decide that who are they to decide what sort of life is best worth living the medical profession used to be about the Hippocratic oath preserving life as long as humanly possible now the medical profession has become the great arbiter of the lives that are worthy this is true in Great Britain it's true in the United States as well people like Ezekiel Emanuel saying he wants to die at 80 because he doesn't want to live with disease well that's his choice he can do what he wants free country but the idea that his standard for a dignified life should be the standard for everyone even above the wishes of parents we're the ones who have to spend time with their child who have to sit the father last night was giving mouth-to-mouth to his son because the hospital would not give his son oxygen okay this is evil what we're watching in Britain it's evil and that's happening because the buraco the the bureaucracy the centralized bureaucracy of great states have decided they know more than the common man about virtue and vice they know more about dignity and death than the common person including a common person who has to actually visit the gravestone unnies doctors gonna be going to alfea's grave after the kid dies I promise you his parents will just horrifying
