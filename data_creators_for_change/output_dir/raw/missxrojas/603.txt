100
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,899
asleep I literally I read the first page

101
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,329
and fall asleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I haven't had</font>

102
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach which is the saddest thing</font>

104
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,060
America strike I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to walk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

105
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,530
bit because there's been a lot of them

106
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,000
like myths about it every day a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,310
articles to seem to say oh these guys

108
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,600
are really rich they didn't deserve to

109
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,550
prepare the EPI 200,000 pounds a year

110
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,100
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> load of crap if you</font>

111
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,810
have asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm sorry I put a link</font>

112
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,790
i'll put a link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a site over here</font>

113
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,790
which tells you i would say is closer to

114
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> truth and about it but it's not fair</font>

115
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the i'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like some kind of</font>

116
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,180
side because it means that laundry helps

117
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,670
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love my favorite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows and they</font>

118
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,470
won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to record anything past</font>

119
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,260
like the halfway mark and because they

120
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,000
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the episodes written yet but</font>

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,210
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely understand why has to be</font>

122
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,680
done it's not acceptable that they don't

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,710
get recognition and that they're just

124
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,120
basically laying off all their staff on

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,650
some of these um evening shows as well

126
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,480
it's like a shame that you support them

127
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,330
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's just me so that's it</font>

128
