Wow.

00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,341
The front door is locked,
but you can walk in there.

5
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:28,514
You could just-- can't you
reach in and unlock it?

00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:31,410
[? Then you ?] walk
right in there.

Why don't you just
open the door for me?

00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:43,340
[LAUGHS] Why do we both
have to crawl through?

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,120
We're gonna have to open up
the windows and air it out.

I'm glad we move
this, [? uh-huh. ?]

Yeah, I think about my mom.

She loved it here.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,230
She loved this place.

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,626
But we'll fix it up.

That's what we kept
it going, really--
