1
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:11,611
APPLAUSE ] TRUTHFULLY, IT'S 

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,812
BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD, MY LIPS 

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,045
STUCK. 

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:26,226
[ LAUGHTER ] SO IN HIS 

5
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,026
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HE DESCRIBES A 

6
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:27,426
HAPPY CHILDHOOD. 

7
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:28,695
HE WAS LOOKING AFTER CATTLE AND 

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,662
PLAYING WITH THE OTHER BOYS. 

9
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,697
EVENTUALLY, HE ATTENDS A SCHOOL 

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:31,931
WHERE HIS TEACHER GAVE HIM THE 

11
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,531
ENGLISH NAME, NELSON. 

12
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,169
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, HIS QUOTED 

13
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,370
AS SAYING WHY SHE BESTOWED THIS 

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,172
PARTICULAR NAME UPON ME, I HAVE 

15
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,241
NO IDEA. 

16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,644
THERE WAS NO REASON TO BELIEVE 

17
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:49,782
THAT A YOUNG BLACK BOY AT THIS 

18
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:55,488
TIME IN THIS PLACE COULD, IN 

19
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,858
ANY WAY, ALTER HISTORY. 

20
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,528
AFTER ALL, SOUTH AFRICA WAS 

21
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,831
LESS THAN A DECADE REMOVED FROM 

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,631
A FULL BRITISH CONTROL. 

23
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,899
ALREADY LAWS WERE BEING 

24
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:11,938
CODIFIED. 

25
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,273
TO IMPLEMENT RACIAL SEGREGATION 

26
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,375
AND SUBJUGATION. 

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,576
THE NETWORK OF LAWS THAT WOULD 

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,680
BE KNOWN AS APARTHEID. MOST OF 

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,352
AFRICA, INCLUDING MY FATHER'S 

30
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,686
HOMELAND, WAS UNDER COLONIAL 

31
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:28,988
RULE. 

32
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,957
THE DOMINANT EUROPEAN POWERS 

33
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,894
HAVING ADDED A HORRIFIC WORLD 

34
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:39,766
WAR JUST AFTER HIS BIRTH. 

35
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,403
THEY VIEWED THIS CONTINENT AND 

36
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,606
PEOPLES AS SPOILS OF THE 

37
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,510
TERRITORY AND ABUNDANT NATURAL 

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,980
RESOURCES AND CHEAP LABOR. 

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,548
AND THE INFERIORITY OF THE 

40
00:01:55,548 --> 00:02:01,720
BLACK RACE, AND INDIFFERENCE 

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,488
TOWARDS BLACK CULTURE AND 

42
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,858
INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS WAS A 

43
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:11,030
GIVEN. 

44
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,132
SUCH A VIEW OF THE WORLD, THAT 

45
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,636
CERTAIN RACES, CERTAIN NATIONS, 

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,105
CERTAIN GROUPS WERE INHERENTLY 

47
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,976
SUPERIOR, AND THAT OF VIOLENCE 

48
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,246
AND COERCION ARE THE PRIMARY 

49
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,880
BASES FOR GOVERNMENTS, BUT THE 

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,550
STRONG NECESSARILY EXPLOIT THE 

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:45,965
WEEK -- WEAK, THAT WAS HARDLY 

52
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:46,799
CONFINED TO RELATIONS BETWEEN 

53
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,800
EUROPE AND AFRICA OR RELATIONS 

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,707
BETWEEN WHITES AND BLACKS. 

55
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,742
WHITES WERE HAPPY TO EXPLOIT 

56
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,144
OTHER WHITES WHEN THEY COULD. 

57
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:03,249
AND BY THE WAY, BLACKS WERE 

58
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,717
OFTEN WILLING TO EXPLOIT OTHER 

59
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,920
BLACKS. 

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,921
AND AROUND THE GLOBE, A 

61
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,490
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVED AT 

62
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:20,099
SUBSISTENCE LEVELS. OFTEN THEY 

63
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,734
WERE SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS AND 

64
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:27,006
CRUELTIES OF DISTANT LEADERS. 

65
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,242
THE AVERAGE PERSON SAW NO 

66
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,678
POSSIBILITY OF ADVANCING FROM 

67
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,012
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR 

68
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,714
BIRTH. 

69
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,749
WOMEN WERE ALMOST UNIFORMLY 

70
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:42,622
SUBORDINATE TO MEN, PRIVILEGE 

71
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,656
AND STATUS WAS RIGIDLY BOUND BY 

72
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,625
CASTE AND COLOR AND ETHNICITY. 

73
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,928
AND RELIGION. 

74
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,730
AND EVEN IN MY OWN COUNTRY, 

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,235
EVEN IN DEMOCRACIES LIKE THE 

76
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,270
UNITED STATES FOUNDED ON A 

77
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,838
DECLARATION THAT ALL MEN ARE 

78
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,606
CREATED EQUAL, RACIAL 

79
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,875
SEGREGATION AND SYSTEMIC 

80
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:07,413
DISCRIMINATION WAS THE LAW AND 

81
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:12,285
ALMOST HALF THE COUNTRY. 

82
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,519
IT WAS THE NORM THROUGHOUT THE 

83
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,190
REST OF THE COUNTRY. 

84
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,394
THAT WAS THE WORLD JUST 100 

85
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,698
YEARS AGO. 

86
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,733
THERE ARE PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY 

87
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:36,476
WHO WERE ALIVE IN THAT WORLD. 

88
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,777
IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE 

89
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,444
REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATIONS THAT 

90
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,379
HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE THAT 

91
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,018
TIME. 

92
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:47,253
A SECOND WORLD WAR, EVEN MORE 

93
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,489
TERRIBLE THAN THE FIRST, ALONG 

94
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,458
WITH A CASCADE OF LIBERATION 

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,962
MOVEMENTS FROM AFRICA TO ASIA, 

96
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,598
LATIN AMERICA, THE MIDDLE EAST 

97
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,801
WOULD FINALLY BRING AN END TO 

98
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,070
COLONIAL RULE. 

99
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,971
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE'S HAVING 

100
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,307
WITNESSED THE HORRORS OF 

101
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,611
TOTALITARIANISM, THE REPEATED 

102
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,079
MASS SLAUGHTERS OF THE 20th 

103
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,482
CENTURY BEGAN TO EMBRACE A NEW 

104
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,519
VISION FOR HUMANITY, A NEW 

105
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,955
IDEA, ONE BASED NOT ONLY ON THE 

106
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,859
PRINCIPLE OF NATIONAL SELF-

107
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,495
DETERMINATION BUT ALSO ON THE 

108
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,731
PRINCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY AND 

109
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:38,237
RULE OF LAW AND CIVIL RIGHTS 

110
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,073
AND THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF 

111
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:47,146
EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. 

112
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:51,017
THOSE NATIONS WOULD MARK A 

113
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,286
BASED ECONOMIES, SUDDENLY UNION 

114
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:58,124
MOVEMENT DEVELOPED AND HEALTH 

115
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:58,924
AND SAFETY AND COMMERCIAL 

116
00:05:58,924 --> 00:05:59,759
REGULATIONS WERE INSTITUTED AND 

117
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,760
ACCESS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION WAS 

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,128
EXPANDED AND SOCIAL WELFARE 

119
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,030
SYSTEMS EMERGED, ALL WITH THE 

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,265
AIM OF CONSTRAINING THE 

121
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,102
EXCESSES OF CAPITALISM AND 

122
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:11,003
ENHANCING ITS ABILITY TO 

123
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,438
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST TO 

124
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,209
SOME BUT TO ALL PEOPLE. 

125
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,643
THE RESULT WAS UNMATCHED 

126
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,079
ECONOMIC GROWTH. 

127
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,780
AND THE GROWTH OF THE MIDDLE 

128
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,351
CLASS. 

129
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,552
AND IN MY OWN COUNTRY, THE 

130
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,654
MORAL FORCE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS 

131
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,823
MOVEMENT, NOT ONLY OVERTHREW 

132
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,658
JIM CROW LAWS, BUT IT OPENED UP 

133
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,530
THE FLOODGATES FOR WOMEN AND 

134
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,999
HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS

135
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,236
TO REIMAGINE THEM SELVES, TO 

136
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,072
FIND THEIR OWN VOICES AND MAKE 

137
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,540
THEIR OWN CLAIMS TO FULL 

138
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,779
CITIZENSHIP. 

139
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,250
IT WAS IN SERVICE OF THIS LONG 

140
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,186
WALK TOWARDS FREEDOM AND JUSTICE

141
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:05,391
AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY THAT 

142
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:12,965
NELSON MANDELA DEVOTED HIS LIFE.

143
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,300
AT THE OUTSET, HIS STRUGGLE WAS 

144
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,868
PARTICULAR TO THIS PLACE, TO 

145
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:16,536
HIS HOMELAND. 

146
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:21,007
A FIGHT TO END APARTHEID. 

147
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,008
A FIGHT TO ENSURE LASTING 

148
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,376
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AND 

149
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,811
ECONOMIC EQUALITY FOR ITS 

150
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,612
DISENFRANCHISED NONWHITE 

151
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:29,315
CITIZENS. 

152
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,152
BUT THROUGH HIS SACRIFICE AND 

153
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,856
UNWAVERING LEADERSHIP AND 

154
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:37,857
PERHAPS, MOST OF ALL, THROUGH 

155
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:44,564
HIS MORAL EXAMPLE, MANDELA AND 

156
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,798
THE MOVEMENT HE LED WOULD COME 

157
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,036
TO SIGNIFY SOMETHING LARGER. 

158
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,771
HE CAME TO EMBODY THE UNIVERSAL 

159
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,106
ASPIRATIONS OF DISPOSSESSED 

160
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:58,578
PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. 

161
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,812
THEIR HOPES FOR A BETTER LIFE, 

162
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,247
THE POSSIBILITY OF A MORAL 

163
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,250
TRANSFORMATION IN THE CONDUCT 

164
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:12,358
OF HUMAN AFFAIRS. 

165
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,661
HIS LIGHT SHONE SO BRIGHTLY 

166
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,031
EVEN FROM THAT NARROW ROBIN 

167
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:24,270
ISLAND CELL, IN THE LATE 70s HE 

168
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,607
COULD INSPIRE A YOUNG COLLEGE 

169
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,408
STUDENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 

170
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,745
THE WORLD TO RE-EXAMINE HIS OWN 

171
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,383
PRIORITIES. 

172
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,583
HE COULD MAKE ME CONSIDER THE 

173
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,820
SMALL ROLE I MIGHT PLAY IN 

174
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,092
BENDING THE ARK OF THE WORLD 

175
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,294
TOWARDS JUSTICE. 

176
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,597
AND WHEN LATER AS A LAW 

177
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,165
STUDENT, I WITNESSED HIM EMERGE 

178
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,502
FROM PRISON JUST A FEW MONTHS, 

179
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,305
YOU WILL RECALL, AFTER THE FALL 

180
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:05,011
OF THE BERLIN WALL. 

181
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,412
I FELT THE SAME WAVE OF HOPE 

182
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,446
THAT WASH THROUGH HEARTS ALL 

183
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:13,352
ALONG THE WORLD. 

184
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,153
YOU REMEMBER THAT FEELING. 

185
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,788
IT SEEMED AS IF THE FORCES OF 

186
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,990

226
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,278
BUT IT SET THE TERMS AND 

227
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,479

228
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,913

ENUMERATED IN A DECLARATION BY

252
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:35,221
THE GUIDING AND NORM FOR THE

257
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,397
EVEN WHEN THE HUMAN RIGHTS WERE 

258
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,198
VIOLATED, THOSE WHO VIOLATED 

259

740
00:32:57,541 --> 00:33:00,411
AND NATIONS COMPETE IN A ZERO 

741
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,647
SUM GAME CONSTANTLY TEETERING 

742
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,517
ON THE EDGE OF CONFLICT UNTIL 

743
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,419
FULL BLOWN WAR BREAKS OUT? 

744
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:14,625
IS THAT WHAT WE THINK? 

745
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:21,666
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE. 

746
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,000
I BELIEVE IN NELSON MANDELA'S 

747
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,233
VISION. 

748
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,636
I BELIEVE IN A VISION SHARED BY 

749
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,472
GANDHI AND KING AND ABRAHAM 

750
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:28,772
LINCOLN. 

751
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,374
I BELIEVE IN A VISION OF 

752
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,944
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE AND 

753
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,445
FREEDOM AND MULTIRACIAL 

754
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:34,745
DEMOCRACY. 

755
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:36,681
BUILT ON THE PREMISE THAT ALL 

756
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,249
PEOPLE ARE CREATED EQUAL. 

757
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:44,088
AND THEY'RE ENDOWED BY OUR 

758
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,621
CREATOR WITH CERTAIN 

759
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,524
INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND I 

760
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,625
BELIEVE THAT A WORLD GOVERNED 

761
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,727
BY SUCH PRINCIPLES IS POSSIBLE. 

762
00:33:50,727 --> 00:33:56,834
AND THAT IT CAN ACHIEVE MORE 

763
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,136
PEACE AND MORE COOPERATION IN 

764
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:02,206
PURSUIT OF A COMMON GOOD. 

765
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:02,874
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE. 

766
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:08,379
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE NO CHOICE 

767
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,179
BUT TO MOVE FORWARD. 

768
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,850
THAT THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE IN 

769
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,051
DEMOCRACY AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND 

770
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,687
A COMMON HUMAN INDUSTRY A 

771
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,523
BETTER STORY -- HUMANITY HAVE A 

772
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,757
BETTER STORY TO TELL. 

773
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:24,094
AND I BELIEVE THIS NOT JUST 

774
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:27,063
BASED ON SENTIMENT, I BELIEVE 

775
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:30,266
IT BASED ON HARD EVIDENCE. 

776
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:32,570
THE FACT THAT THE WORLD'S MOST 

777
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,337
PROSPEROUS AND SUCCESSFUL 

778
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,873
SOCIETIES, THE ONES WITH  

779
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:36,873
HIGHESTLYING STANDARDS AND THE 

780
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:41,045
LIE -- LIVING STANDARDS AND THE 

781
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,746
HIGHEST LEVELS OF SATISFACTION 

782
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:46,784
AMONG THEIR PEOPLE HAPPEN TO BE 

783
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:50,054
THOSE WHO HAVE MOST CLOSELY 

784
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,790
APPROXIMATE NATED THE LIBERAL 

785
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,659
-- APPROXIMATED THE LABEL REAL 

786
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,661
IDEAL. 

787
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,128
-- LIBERAL IDEAL. 

788
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,061
THE FACT THAT AUTHORITARIAN 

789
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:01,065
GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN 

790
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,734
TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BREED 

791
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:09,974
CORRUPTION, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 

792
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:10,908
ACCOUNTABLE. 

793
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,642
TO REPRESS THEIR PEOPLE. 

794
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:15,880
TO LOSE TOUCH EVENTUALLY WITH 

795
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,147
REALITY. 

796
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:23,621
TO ENGAGE IN BIGGER AND BIGGER 

797
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,491
LIES THAT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN 

798
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,794
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AND 

799
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,495
CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC 

800
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:30,795
STAGNATION. 

801
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,431
LOOK AT -- LOOK AT HISTORY. 

802
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,766
LOOK AT THE FACTS. 

803
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:40,338
THE FACT THAT COUNTRIES WHICH 

804
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,375
RELY ON RABID NATIONALISM AND 

805
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,578
XENOPHOBIA AND DOCTRINES OF 

806
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,245
RELIGIOUS OR RACIAL SUPERIORITY 

807
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,982
AS THAT YOU ARE ORGANIZING 

808
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,317
PRINCIPLE -- THEIR ORGANIZING 

809
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,986
PRINCIPLE. 

810
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,053
EVENTUALLY THOSE COUNTRIES FIND 

811
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,955
THEMSELVES CONSUMED BY CIVIL OR 

812
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:02,126
EXTERNAL WAR. 

813
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,360
CHECK THE HISTORY BOOKS. 

814
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,996
THE FACT THAT TECHNOLOGY CANNOT 

815
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:08,932
BE PUT BACK IN A BOTTLE. 

816
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:11,235
SO WE'RE STUCK WITH THE FACT 

817
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,671
THAT WE NOW LIVE CLOSE 

818
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,171
TOGETHER. 

819
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:17,908
AND POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE 

820
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:18,141
MOVING. 

821
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:18,742
AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES 

822
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,345
ARE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY ON 

823
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:21,946
THEIR OWN. 

824
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,181
SO THAT THE ONLY WAY TO 

825
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,516
EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS PROBLEMS 

826
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,853
LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR MASS 

827
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,686
MIGRATION OR PANDEMIC DISEASE 

828
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:34,625
WILL BE TO DEVELOP SYSTEMS FOR 

829
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,292
MORE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. 

830
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:35,559
NOT LESS. 

831
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:48,873
[ APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE A BETTER 

832
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
STORY TO TELL. 

833
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,244
BUT TO SAY THAT OUR VISION FOR 

834
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,546
THE FUTURE IS BETTER IS NOT TO 

835
00:36:55,546 --> 00:37:00,818
SAY THAT IT WILL INEVITABLY 

836
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:01,018
WIN. 

837
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:05,256
BECAUSE HISTORY ALSO SHOWS THE 

838
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,092
POWER OF FEAR. 

839
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,527
HISTORY SHOWS THE LASTING HOLD 

840
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,763
OF GREED AND THE DESIRE TO 

841
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:16,968
DOMINATE OTHERS IN THE MINDS OF 

842
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,704
MANY. 

843
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:20,104
ESPECIALLY MEN. 

844
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:25,176
[ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] 

845
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,644
HISTORY SHOWS HOW EASILY PEOPLE 

846
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,146
CAN BE CONVINCED TO TURN ON 

847
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,316
THSE WHO LOOK DIFFERENT. 

848
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:39,790
OR WORSHIP GOD IN A DIFFERENT 

849
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:39,990
WAY. 

850
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,893
SO IF WE'RE TRULY TO CONTINUE 

851
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,262
MADIBA'S LONG WALK TOWARD 

852
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,730
FREEDOM, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 

853
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,097
WORK HARDER. 

854
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,634
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE 

855
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:50,901
SMARTER. 

856
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,169
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN 

857
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:57,408
FROM THE MISTAKES OF THE RECENT 

858
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:57,608
PAST. 

859
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,143
AND SO IN THE BRIEF TIME 

860
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,812
REMAINING LET ME JUST SUGGEST A 

861
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,616
FEW GUIDE POSTS FOR THE ROAD 

862
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,250
AHEAD. 

863
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,452
GUIDE POSTS THAT DRAW FROM 

864
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,790
MADIBA'S WORK, HIS WORDS, THE 

865
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,460
LESSONS OF HIS LIFE. 

866
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,496
FIRST MADIBA SHOWS THOSE OF US 

867
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,297
THAT WILL IN FREEDOM AND 

868
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,032
DEMOCRACY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 

869
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:26,703
TO FIGHT HARDER TO REDUCE 

870
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:29,039
INEQUALITY AND PROMOTE LASTING 

871
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,144
ECONOMIC EQUALITY FOR ALL 

872
00:38:34,144 --> 00:38:34,879
PEOPLE. 

873
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,948
NOW I DON'T BELIEVE IN 

874
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:38,349
NICODERMISM. 

875
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:38,882
-- ECONOMIC DETERMINISM. 

876
00:38:38,882 --> 00:38:42,686
HUMAN BEINGS DON'T LIVE ON 

877
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,623
BREAD ALONE. 

878
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,857
BUT THEY NEED BREAD. 

879
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,459
AND HISTORY SHOWS THAT 

880
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,661
SOCIETIES WHICH TOLERATE VAST 

881
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,998
DIFFERENCES IN WEALTH FEED 

882
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,366
RESENTMENTS AND REDUCE 

883
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:59,637
SOLIDARITY AND ACTUALLY GROW 

884
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,507
MORE SLOWLY AND THEN ONCE 

885
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,678
PEOPLE ACHIEVED MORE THAN MERE 

886
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,213
SUBSISTENCE, THEY'RE MEASURING 

887
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,314
THEIR WELL-BEING BY HOW THEY 

888
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,749
COMPARE TO CHAIR NEIGHBORS AND 

889
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,450
HOW -- THEIR NEIGHBORS AND HOW 

890
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,785
THEIR CHILDREN CAN EXPECT TO 

891
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:15,786
LIVE A BETTER LIFE. 

892
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:16,987
WHEN ECONOMIC POWER IS 

893
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,322
CONCENTRATED IN THE HANDS OF 

894
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,357
THE FEW, HISTORY ALSO SHOWS 

895
00:39:20,357 --> 00:39:22,560
THAT POLITICAL POWER IS SURE TO 

896
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,229
FOLLOW AND THAT THAT DYNAMIC 

897
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,930
EATS AWAY AT DEMOCRACY. 

898
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,968
SOMETIMES IT MAY BE STRAIGHT 

899
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:31,335
OUT CORRUPTION. 

900
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:34,839
BUT SOMETIMES IT MAY NOT 

901
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,743
INVOLVE THE EXCHANGE OF MONEY. 

902
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:43,514
IT'S JUST FOLKS WHO WERE THAT 

903
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,015
WEALTHY GET WHAT THEY WANT. 

904
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:50,220
úAN 

905
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,487
FREEDOM. 

906
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:51,922
AND MADIBA UNDERSTOOD TOO, THIS 

907
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,758
IS NOT NEW, HE WARNED US ABOUT 

908
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:54,958
THIS. 

909
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:57,027
HE SAID WHERE GLOBALIZATION 

910
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,795
MEANS AS IT SO OFTEN DOES THAT 

911
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,631
THE RICH AND BE POWERFUL NOW -- 

912
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,800
THE POWERFUL NOW HAVE NEW MEANS 

913
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,534
TO FURTHER ENRICH AND EMPOWER 

914
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:07,238
THEMSELVES AT THE COST OF THE 

915
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,939
POOR AND THE WEAKER, THEN WE 

916
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,174
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO 

917
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,510
PROTEST IN THE NAME OF 

918
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,076
UNIVERSAL FREEDOM. 

919
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:13,544
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. 

920
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:18,148
[ APPLAUSE ] 

921
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:21,385
SO IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT 

922
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:24,054
UNIVERSAL FREEDOM TODAY, IF WE 

923
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,790

00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,675
FUNDAMENTAL REIMAGINING OF OUR 

1107
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,010
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL 

1108

TO PROTECT THE ECONOMIC 

1110
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:58,649
SECURITY AND THE DIGNITY THAT 

1111
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,583
COMES WITH A JOB. 

1112
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,219
IT'S NOT JUST MONEY THAT A JOB 

1113
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:02,986
PROVIDES. 

1114
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,955
IT PROVIDES DIGNITY AND 

1115

1116
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,490
AND A SENSE OF PLACE.

AND A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

[ APPLAUSE ] 

1119
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:11,428
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 

1120
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,064
CONSIDER NEW WAYS OF THINKING 

1121
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:18,335
ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS LIKE A 

1122
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,437
UNIVERSAL INCOME, REVIEW OF OUR 

1123
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,673
WORKWEEK, HOW WE RETRAIN OUR 

1124
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,809
YOUNG PEOPLE, HOW WE MAKE 

1125
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,577
EVERYBODY AN ENTREPRENEUR AT 

1126
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,043
SOME LEVEL. 

1127
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,212
BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 

1128
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:31,481
WORRY ABOUT ECONOMICS IF WE 

1129
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:38,355
WANT TO GET DEMOCRACY BACK ON 

1130
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:38,755
TRACK. 

1131
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,990
SECOND -- MADIBA TEACHES US 

1132
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,526
THAT SOME PRINCIPLES REALLY ARE 

1133
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:42,960
UNIVERSAL. 

1134
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,193
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS 

1135
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:45,862
THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE BOUND 

1136
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:49,365
TOGETHER BY A COMMON HUMANITY. 

1137
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:54,037
AND THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS 

1138
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,905
INHERENT DIGNITY AND WORTH. 

1139
00:47:55,905 --> 00:47:57,607
NOW IT'S SURPRISING THAT WE 

1140
00:47:57,607 --> 00:48:00,944
HAVE TO AFFIRM THIS TRUTH 

1141
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:01,445
TODAY. 

1142
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:02,912
MORE THAN A QUARTER CENTURY 

1143
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:04,781
AFTER MADIBA WALKED OUT OF 

1144
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:07,617
PRISON, I STILL HAVE TO STAND 

1145
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:11,254
HERE AT A LECTURE AND DEVOTE 

1146
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:13,190
SOME TIME TO SAYING THAT BLACK

ALL HUMAN. 

1152
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:31,008
THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE 

1153
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,409
SUPERFICIAL. 

1154
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:36,246
AND THAT WE SHOULD TREAT EACH 

1155
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,247
OTHER WITH CARE AND RESPECT. 

1156
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:39,082
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WE WOULD 

1157
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,152
HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT BY NOW. 

1158
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,554
I THOUGHT THAT BASIC NOTION WAS 

1159
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:44,954
WELL ESTABLISHED. 

1160

[ APPLAUSE ] 

1161
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,728
BUT IT TURNS OUT AS WE'RE 

1162
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,599
SEEING IN THIS RECENT DRIFT 

1163
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,734
INTO REACTIONARY POLITICS, THAT 

1164
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,837
THE STRUGGLE FOR BASIC JUSTICE 

1165
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:05,875
IS NEVER TRULY FINISHED. 

1166
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:09,146
SO WE'VE GOT TO CONSTANTLY BE 

1167
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:11,481
ON THE LOOKOUT AND FIGHT FOR 

1168
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,815
PEOPLE WHO SEEK TO ELEVATE 

1169
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:17,754
THEMSELVES BY PUTTING SOMEBODY 

1170

ELSE DOWN. 

1171

AND BY THE WAY, WE ALSO HAVE TO 

1172

ACTIVELY RESIST, THIS IS 

1173
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,863

1174
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,633

1177
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,773
RESIST THE NOTION THAT BASIC 

1178
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,409

BE BEAT UP AND JAILED BECAUSE 

1185
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:55,758
OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,596
SAY THAT SOMEHOW, WELL, THAT 

1188

DOESN'T APPLY TO US.

HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING 

1195
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:22,853
ABOUT. 

1196
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,222
IN 1964, BEFORE HE RECEIVED THE 

1197
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:26,923
SENTENCE THAT CONDEMNED HIM TO 

1198
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,560
DIE IN PRISON, HE EXPLAINED 

1199
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,695
FROM THE DOCK THAT THE MAGNA 

1200
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:36,032

1201

AND TO YOU. 

1218

1219
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,431
HIM THE MORAL AUTHORITY THAT 

1220
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:07,998

NEVER CLAIM.

MORE CAREFULLY THAN THEY HAD. 

1227
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:28,685
AND HE WENT ON TO SAY POLITICAL 

1228
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,986
DIVISION BASED ON COLOR IS 

1229
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,321

HE SAYS DEMOCRACY IS BASED ON 

1413
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:51,928
THE MAJORITY PRINCIPLE. 

1414
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,363
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN A

AT THE SAME TIME DEMOCRACY ALSO 

1420
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,705

IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE CIVIC

MORE CONSOLIDATION OF WEALTH 

1466
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:32,828
AND POWER AT THE TOP. 

1467
01:00:32,828 --> 01:00:36,666

1468
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,135
CONCEAL CORRUPTION AND ABUSE.

FOR ALL ITS IMPERFECTIONS, REAL 

1470

01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,209
THAT GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO SERVE

1476
01:00:55,984 --> 01:00:57,553
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS THE

01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,888
POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THAT IDEA 

1478

1482
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:08,965
STOP PAYING ALL OF OUR

MORE ON THE GRASSROOTS.

01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:16,672

NOT FROM ABSTRACT THEORIES, NOT 

1491
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:23,045

EXPECT FROM OUR LEADERS. 

1507
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,648
AND IT DEPENDS UPON CULTIVATING 

1508

1521
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,315

1527
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:42,959

FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS. 

1534
01:02:58,173 --> 01:02:58,740
BUT DEMOCRACY DEMANDS THAT 

1535
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,776
WE'RE ABLE ALSO TO GET INSIDE 

1536
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:02,879
THE REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:03,346
DIFFERENT THAN US.

1543
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,324

INSIST THAT THOSE THAT AREN'T

IN PRISON, HE STUDIED AFRIK AS 

1558

SO HE COULD -- AFRIKAANS TO HE 

1559
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:55,264
COULD UNDERSTAND. 

1560
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,500
HE KNEW THEY HAD TO BE A PART

01:03:58,734 --> 01:03:59,668

1579

THEY JUST MAKE STUFF UP. 

1644
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,846
WE SEE IT IN THE GROWTH OF 

1645
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,613
STATE SPONSORED PROPAGANDA. 

1646
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:02,718
WE SEE IT IN INTERNET DRIVEN 

1647
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,051
FABRICATIONS. 

1648
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:05,054
WE SEE IT IN THE BLURRING OF 

1649
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,956
LINES BETWEEN NEWS AND 

1650
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,491
ENTERTAINMENT. 

1651
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:12,328
WE SEE THE UTTER LOSS OF SHAME 

1652
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,028
AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS, WHERE 

1653
01:07:13,028 --> 01:07:13,963
THEY'RE CAUGHT IN A LIE AND 

1654
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:23,072
THEY JUST DOUBLE DOWN AND THEY 

1655
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:23,572
LIE SOME MORE. 

1656
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,208
IT USED -- LOOK. 

1657
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:26,508
LET ME SAY. 

1658
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:27,109
POLITICS HAVE ALWAYS -- 

1659
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:27,743
POLITICIANS HAVE ALWAYS LIED 

1660
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,979
BUT IT USED TO BE IF AUGITES 

1661
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:30,679
THEM LYING, THEY'D BE LIKE -- 

1662
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,114
IF YOU CAUGHT THEM LYING. 

1663
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,916
THEY'D BE LIKE OH MAN. 

1664
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:34,249
[ LAUGHTER ] 

1665
01:07:34,249 --> 01:07:41,556
NOW THEY JUST KEEP ON LYING. 

1666
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:51,233
THEY JUST -- [ LAUGHTER ] I 

1667
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,336
MEAN, THIS IS -- BY THE WAY, 

1668
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:57,673
THIS IS WHAT I THINK HE WAS 

1669
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,308
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF MAYBE 

1670
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:03,245
SOME SENSE OF HUMILITY THAT 

1671
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,947
MADIBA FELT. 

1672
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,482
LIKE SOMETIMES JUST BASIC 

1673
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:06,982
STUFF. 

1674
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,717
ME JUST NOT COMPLETELY LYING TO 

1675
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:09,618
PEOPLE. 

1676
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,555
I THINK IS PRETTY BASIC. 

1677
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,789
I DIDN'T -- I DON'T KNOW -- I 

1678
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:17,826
DON'T THINK MYSELF GREAT LEADER 

1679
01:08:17,826 --> 01:08:20,162
JUST BECAUSE I DON'T COMPLETELY 

1680
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,229
MAKE STUFF UP. 

1681
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:23,198
I MEAN, YOU -- YOU THINK THAT 

1682
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:28,671
WAS KIND OF JUST A BASELINE. 

1683
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:28,904
ANYWAY. 

1684
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:33,008
WE SEE IT IN THE PROMOTION OF 

1685
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:33,475
ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM. 

1686
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:36,010
AND THE REJECTION OF SCIENCE. 

1687
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,314
FROM LEADERS WHO FIND CRITICAL 

1688
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:42,885
THINKING AND ANALYSIS AND DATA 

1689
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:43,318
SOMEHOW POLITICALLY 

1690
01:08:43,318 --> 01:08:45,955
INCONVENIENT. 

1691
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,991
AND AS WITH DENIAL OF RIGHTS, 

1692
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:52,627
THE DENIAL OF FACTS RUNS 

1693
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:54,462
COUNTER TO DEMOCRACY. 

1694
01:08:54,462 --> 01:08:57,066
IT COULD BE ITS UNDOING. 

1695
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,734
WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO 

1696
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,435
ZEALOUSLY PROTECT INDEPENDENT 

1697
01:09:00,435 --> 01:09:00,669
MEDIA. 

1698
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,404
AND WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST 

1699
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,506
THE TENDENCY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA 

1700
01:09:04,506 --> 01:09:06,908
TO BECOME A PURELY A PLATFORM 

1701
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:09,345
FOR SPECTACLE AND OUTRAGE AND 

1702
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:09,712
DISINFORMATION. 

1703
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,514
AND WE HAVE TO INSIST THAT OUR 

1704
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:13,816
SCHOOLS TEACH CRITICAL THINKING 

1705
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,152
TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. 

1706
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:24,627
NOT JUST BLIND OBEDIENCE.

1707
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,595
WHICH I'M SURE YOU ARE THANKFUL 

1708
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:31,433
FOR LEADS ME TO MY FINAL POINT. 

1709
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,871
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW MADIBA'S 

1710
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,974
EXAMPLE OF PERSISTENCE AND OF 

1711
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,877
HOPE. 

1712
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:46,615
IT'S TEMPTING RIGHT NOW TO GIVE 

1713
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:50,586
INTO CYNICISM. 

1714
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,488
TO BELIEVE THAT RE¢ SHIFTS IN 

1715
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,921
GLOBAL -- RECENT SHIFTS IN 

1716
01:09:53,921 --> 01:09:55,224
GLOBAL POLITICS ARE TOO 

1717
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,060
POWERFUL TO PUSH BACK. 

1718
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,697
THAT THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG 

1719
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,698
PERMANENTLY. 

1720
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,434
AND JUST AS PEOPLE SPOKE ABOUT 

1721
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,536
THE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY, IN 

1722
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,104
THE '90s, NOW YOU ARE HEARING 

1723
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:13,242
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE END OF 

1724
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:13,942
DEMOCRACY. 

1725
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:18,113
AND THE TRIUMPH OF TRIBALISM 

1726
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,382
AND THE STRONG MAN. 

1727
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,885
WE HAVE TO RESIST THAT 

1728
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,687
CYNICISM. 

1729
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:29,325
BECAUSE -- BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN 

1730
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:29,825
THROUGH DARKER TIMES. 

1731
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:33,027
WE'VE BEEN IN LOWER VALLEYS. 

1732
01:10:33,027 --> 01:10:36,231
YES, BY THE END OF THIS LIFE, 

1733
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:40,169
MADIBA EMBODIED THE SUCCESSFUL 

1734
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,403
STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. 

1735
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:45,574
BUT THAT JOURNEY WAS NOT EASY. 

1736
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,308
IT WASN'T PREORDAINED. 

1737
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:51,380
THE MAN WENT TO PRISON FOR 

1738
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,082
ALMOST THREE DECADES. 

1739
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,782
HE SPLIT LIMESTONE IN THE HEAT. 

1740
01:10:54,782 --> 01:10:58,654
AND HE SLEPT IN A SMALL CELL. 

1741
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:02,424
AND WAS REPEATEDLY PUT IN 

1742
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:02,958
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. 

1743
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,662
AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO SOME 

1744
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:11,833
OF HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES, 

1745
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,303
SAYING HOW THEY HADN'T REALIZED 

1746
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,706
WHEN THEY WERE AT LEAST JUST 

1747
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:22,578
THE SIGHT OF A CHILD, THE IDEA 

1748
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:27,282
OF HOLDING A CHILD, THEY HAD 

1749
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:27,516
MISSED. 

1750
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:35,090
THEY -- IT WASN'T SOMETHING 

1751
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,192
AVAILABLE TO THEM. 

1752
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:37,559
FOR DECADES. 

1753
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,663
AND YET SOMEHOW HIS POWER 

1754
01:11:41,663 --> 01:11:42,063
ACTUALLY GREW. 

1755
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:42,530
DURING THOSE YEARS. 

1756
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:47,035
AND THE POWER OF HIS JAILERS 

1757
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:49,772
DIMINISHED BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT 

1758
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,141
IF YOU STICK TO WHAT'S TRUE, IF 

1759
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,810
YOU -- IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN 

1760
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,245
YOUR HEART AND YOU'RE WILLING 

1761
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:56,712
TO SACRIFICE FOR IT. 

1762
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:01,316
EVEN IN THE FACE OF 

1763
01:12:01,316 --> 01:12:02,017
OVERWHELMING ODDS, THAT IT 

1764
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:02,918
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN TOMORROW. 

1765
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:07,289
IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN NEXT WEEK. 

1766
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,991
IT MIGHT NOT EVEN HAPPEN IN 

1767
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:12,761
YOUR LIFETIME. 

1768
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:16,698
THINGS MAY GO BACKWARDS FOR A 

1769
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:16,999
WHILE. 

1770
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,400
BUT ULTIMATELY, RIGHT MAKES 

1771
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:18,934
MIGHT. 

1772
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:24,005
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. 

1773
01:12:24,005 --> 01:12:26,474
ULTIMATELY THE BETTER STORY CAN 

1774
01:12:26,474 --> 01:12:28,811
WIN OUT. 

1775
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,080
AND AS STRONG AS MADIBA'S 

1776
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,817
SPIRIT MAY HAVE BEEN, HE WOULD 

1777
01:12:35,817 --> 01:12:37,519
NOT HAVE SUSTAINED THAT HOPE 

1778
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,090
HAD HE BEEN ALONE IN THE 

1779
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,593
STRUGGLE. 

1780
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,628
PART OF WHAT BUOYED HIM UP WAS 

1781
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,564
THAT EACH YEAR HE KNEW THE 

1782
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:52,100
RANKS OF FREEDOM FIGHTERS WERE 

1783
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,901
REPLENISHING. 

1784
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,436
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN IN SOUTH 

1785
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,903
AFRICA BUT ALSO BLACK AND WHITE 

1786
01:12:55,903 --> 01:12:56,872
AND INDIAN FROM ACROSS THE 

1787
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:00,008
COUNTRY SIDE, ACROSS THE 

1788
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:00,308
CONTINENT. 

1789
01:13:00,308 --> 01:13:00,742
AROUND THE WORLD. 

1790
01:13:00,742 --> 01:13:02,644
WHO IN THOSE MOST DIFFICULT 

1791
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:07,583
DAYS, WOULD KEEP WORKING ON 

1792
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,750
BEHALF OF HIS VISION. 

1793
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,854
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED RIGHT 

1794
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:12,054
NOW. 

1795
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:16,558
WE DON'T JUST NEED ONE LEADER. 

1796
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:21,363
WE DON'T JUST NEED ONE 

1797
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,564
INSPIRATION, WHAT WE BADLY 

1798
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,100
RIGHT NOW IS THAT COLLECTIVE 

1799
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:25,333
SPIRIT. 

1800
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,636
AND I KNOW THAT THOSE YOUNG 

1801
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,471
PEOPLE, THOSE HOPE CARRIER, 

1802
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,606
ARE GATHERING AROUND THE WORLD. 

1803
01:13:31,606 --> 01:13:33,108
BECAUSE HISTORY SHOWS THAT 

1804
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:33,809
WHENEVER PROGRESS IS 

1805
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:35,644
THREATENED, AND THE THINGS WE 

1806
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:36,511
CARE ABOUT MOST ARE IN 

1807
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,280
QUESTION, WE SHOULD HEED THE 

1808
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,982
WORDS OF ROBERT KENNEDY WHO 

1809
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,750
SPOKE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. 

1810
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,752
HE SAID OUR ANSWER IS THE 

1811
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,252
WORLD'S HOPE. 

1812
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:51,059
IT IS TO RELY ON YOUTH. 

1813
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:54,263
IT'S TO RELY ON THE SPIRIT OF 

1814
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:54,563
THE YOUNG. 

1815
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:58,333
SO YOUNG PEOPLE, WHO ARE IN THE 

1816
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:58,967
AUDIENCE, WHO ARE LISTENING -- 

1817
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:03,071
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] 

1818
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:09,645
MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS SIMPLE -- 

1819
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:10,545
KEEP BELIEVING. 

1820
01:14:10,545 --> 01:14:12,547
KEEP MARCHING. 

1821
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:13,481
KEEP BUILDING. 

1822
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:15,617
