trees yeah all he's huge like hundred

141
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,389
year old trees in the yard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they took</font>

142
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,610
them all down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like much i get 2</font>

143
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,990
times bigger than that was maybe three

144
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,819
times we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the house now they've</font>

145
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,409
taken them all out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're putting</font>

146
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:43,719

149
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,499
think they're putting up in one tree for

150
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:59,289
us because I don't see any other trees

151
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:01,059

152
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,589
in our yard but you know why that's fine
