european union is fighting against US sanctions the target Iran being imposed after President Donald Trump scrapped the nuclear deal with Tehran as the deadline for the first round of punitive measures this approach the EU is enforcing special legislation in a bid to protect its businesses working with Iran so let's get more details now from a building correspondent Peter Oliver good afternoon again Peter look we do know don't we that the US and the EU are long-standing allies so many people are asking why are they so out of sync with each other on this issue well this particular issue all over the US is decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal has been the thorniest of issues between Brussels and Washington we heard an almost tearful federica mogherini when she was describing her well how much he didn't agree with what Donald Trump had to do when the decision was made earlier this year she said it had been the result of years and years of diplomatic work to get to this point and Donald Trump as well dismissed it all away so what we are going to see is on Tuesday the first round of US sanctions against Iran will start to come back into play now these will revolve around restrictions on dealing with the US dollar also restrictions on dealings on the metals markets the globals metals markets including precious metals well this has resulted in a statement from the High Representative for European foreign affairs federica mogherini backed up by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom Germany and France and they've give a resounding no to the u.s. decision we are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran this is why European Union's updated blocking statute enters into force on the 7th of August to protect EU companies during legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extraterritorial sanctions so what is the blocking statute well it's a piece of legislation it was first drawn up back in 1996 it was originally designed to get around a blockade of Cuba it was significantly rewritten earlier this year though specifically to deal with US sanctions against Iran ultimately what it means is that European companies can disregard sanctions by foreign nations namely the United States in this case and also the rulings of courts in foreign countries will have no bearing on EU companies but how that's put into practice we still don't know how that will there will take any form what we do know though is that this news has been welcomed in Tehran today the entire world has shown it disagrees with the US policies against Iran talk to anyone anywhere in the world and they will tell you that Netanyahu Trump and bin Salman are isolated not a run but that decision by Donald Trump to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal it's proving to be a real tough issue between Washington and Brussels and it's one that doesn't show any sign of going away because all those these sanctions are set to come in on Tuesday we're expecting more perhaps even much harsher sanctions to come in by the end of 2018 yeah it's definitely going to rumble on isn't it Peter that was that Peter Oliver there for us in Berlin you
