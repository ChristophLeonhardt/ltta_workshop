university is supposed to be far off and

76
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,239
for such a long time it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,799
towards which everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> was directed</font>

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,690
and everything will be solved that's how

116
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,850

122
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,760
a long time ago about branding they were

123
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,010
found in a state of crisis I'm obsessed

124
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the word crisis right now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

125
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human body in crisis is something</font>

126
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,970
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely like you don't really</font>

127
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,170
interest me because there are all these

128
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,300
crises that we have no life<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,340
you know death being a big one of them

130
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,710
that moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of panic and anxiety and not</font>

131
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,450
being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that isn't</font>

132
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,430
entirely asthma-related that is

133
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,390
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should keep looking</font>

134
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,680
more at now that we live in the consumer

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,020
driven society where we are told more

136
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,550
clearly than ever before what we should

137
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,140
be concerned about anyway she tweeted

this blog post about a black branding I

139

<font color="#CCCCCC">of crisis we're transferring everything</font>

141
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,380
from Harry Potter to YouTube in a way

142
