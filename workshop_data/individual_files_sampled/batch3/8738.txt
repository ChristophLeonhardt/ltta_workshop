THREATEN TO PULL OUT OF THE SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. DUE TO THE ON GOING MILITARY EXERCISES. THAT HE KNEW ABOUT WITH SOUTH KOREA AND THE U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE A MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT IN GAIN DMT KOREAN PENINSULA AND SOME WOULD ARGUE HIS TOUGH TALK AND MILITARY PRESENCE AND SANCTIONS ALL WORKED. TAKE A LISTEN. NORTH KOREA MUST NOT MAKE MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED STATES. THEY WILL MESS WITH FIRE AND FURY LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. THE UNITED STATES HAS GREAT STRENGTHS AND PATIENCE. IF IT IS FORCED DEFEND ITSELF FOR AL ICE. WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY DESTROY NORTH KOREA. ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUED MISSION FROM HIMSELF. AND FOR HIS REGIME. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HANDLED NOW. BUT I WILL HANDLE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HANDLE IT. LITTLE ROCKET MAN WE WILL DO IT BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE WHAT IS AMAZING THE PRESIDENT'S TOUGH RHETORIC PROVE WHAT IS REAGAN SPOKE ABOUT IN THE 80s EVIL THE SOVIET UNION AND PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH TRUST BY VERIFY. WELL IS ONE SIGN THE SOVIETS MAKE THAT IS UNMISTAKABLE. THAT WOULD VETERANS DRAMATICALLY THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM AND PEACE.

REAGAN IN THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRATE ANCHOR. OUR FRIEND. GOOD TO SEE WE ARE NOT FRIENDS EVERY NEWSPAPER LOCAL, INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL. THEY HAVE A SPORT'S SECTION. IF I WILL PAGE? YOU OTHER NEWS PAGE THIS IS A IS IRRELEVANT VANLT TO IRAN AND NORTH KOREA AND EVEN THE OPENING OF THE EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. REMEMBER THOSE TIME WHEN IS REAGAN WAS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE E VIL EMPIRE AND THE SHEEP OF HISTORY COMMUNISM WOULD BE JOKES AT TIMES GETTING CAUGHT LIKE THE BOMB WILL START TOMORROW. HEADS WERE EXPLODING IN WASHINGTON AT THE TEAM. SOUND FAMILIAR? HEADS ARE EXPLODING IN WASHINGTON IF JOHN 12TH HOLD AND IT IS SUMMIT HAPPENS. JUNE 12 IS HISTORIC. JUNE 12, 1987 THE GATE SPEECH. TAKE DOWN THIS WALL MR. GORBACHEV. THAT CHANGED THAT AND THE COLLECTION OF THEM. CHANGED OUR HISTORY. IT IS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW LOOK AT WHAT ALREADY THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT PLAYING IN CASH LIKE OBAMA DID OR CLINTON WITH THE ENERGY AID TO KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER THIS PRESIDENT TALKED TOUGH. PUT A MILITARY PRESENCE AND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT AND SANCTIONS IN PLACE. DIDN'T THAT REALLY ALL CREDIBILITY TO KIM JONG-UN'S DECISION HERE? I WOULD THINK SO. NOW THE CAVEAT IS THE NORTH KOREANS DON'T LIVE UP TO THEIR PROMISES THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL SITS AT TABLE AND WALK AWAY IF THE DEAL IS NOT RIGHT. THE SIMILARITIES ARE REALLY STARK. PERSONALITIES ARE DIFFERENT. I DON'T THINK REAGAN WOULD LOVE TWITTER WHO KNOWS. MAY BE HE WOULD. BUT HE DID SAY THOSE BOLD THINGS THAT CHANGED THE PAIR DIME AND MAY BE IT SHOULD BE NOW. THE THING IS THEY SAID HE WAS A CALIFORNIA COWBOY AND HE WOULD START WORLD WAR THREE AND SAID WOULD RESULT IN THE COLLAPSE OF THE ECONOMY. 21 MILLION JOB REMEMBER CREATE DOUBLE REVENUES AND THE LONGEST PERIOD OF PEACETIME IN HISTORY. I KNOW I'M BRAG A BIT IN OPINION. I DOT LAST WORD OF THIS BOOK I DRAW. GET TO THAT PAGE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORDINGS OF BIG SPEECHES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. SPEECH POLAND. THE UNITED NATION'S SPEECH. STATE UNION SPEECH. THEY HAVE PRAISE THEY HAVE PRAIS THEY HAVE PHRIS THEY HAVE PHRAS THEY HAVE PHRASES THEY HAVE PHRASES A THEY HAVE PHRASES AND TERMINOLOGY YOU COULD HEAR REAGAN DELIVERING. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT REAGAN. PRESIDENT REAGAN. VERY DIFFERENT BUT THEY HAVE SIMILAR MOMENTS AND CHALLENGES THEY ARE FACING. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH. TRUST BUT VERIFY. TAX CUTS NOW THE TRUMP TAX CUTS. ORIGINALISTS ON THE SUPREME COURT. SECURING THE BORDER. I I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PRESIDENT IS A NATIONALIST POPULIST. I BELIEVE HE IS A REAGAN CONFERRINGIVE THE THINGS I MENTIONED ENERGY INDEPENDENCE ARE ALL THINGS THAT REAGAN BELIEVED IN. YOU ARE NOT WRONGFUL I THINK THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS THE ABILITY TO REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS AND MAKE DEALS THAT REAGAN WOULD WITH TIP OSHG NEIL AND OTHERS. BOOK IS FASCINATING I'M SAYING THIS AS A FRIEND. IT IS AN AMAZING READ IT IS RELEVANT FROM TODAY'S HEAD LINES. GREAT BOOK. HOW MUCH CRAP DO YOU TAKE FOR ME BEING OPINIONATED? ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10? A GOOD, SIX. IT WILL EVERYBODY YOUR NEWS I'M OPINION AND EVERY PAPER IS NEWS,
