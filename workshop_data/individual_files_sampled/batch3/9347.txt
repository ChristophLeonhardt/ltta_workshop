GREG PALCOCK, NO BREAKS ON THE WEEKEND. THANKS, LAURA, FOR MORE GORDON CHANG, ASIA POLICY, AUTHOR OF NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD, GOOD SEE YOU. A MONTH AGO I HAD GONE TO YOU, THE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA ARE GOING TO MEET, THEY ARE GOING TO SHAKE HANDS AND MIGHT HAVE HUGGED, YOU MIGHT HAVE SAID YOU'RE CRAZY, ED, NOW THEY HAVE DONE IT TWICE. THIS IS AMAZING, THREE INTERKOREAN SUMMITS UP AND YEARS BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND NOW WE'VE HAD TWO IN SHORT SUCCESSION. MOON JAE-IN IS PRONORTH KOREAN, HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT NORTH KOREA TO TAKE OVER THE SOUTH SO I GET A BIT NERVOUS WHEN I SEE BOTH KIM AND MOON IN THE SAME PLACE BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE A NORTH KOREAN AND MUCH TOO COZY. WHAT DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DO TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT TOO COZY AND THE UNITED STATES GETS A GOOD DEAL? DEMOCRATS LIKE NANCY PELOSI, THE PRESIDENT SENT THIS LETTER, IT WAS ALL TICKLY WITH KIM JONG UN, ALL OF THE OVERDONE RHETORIC AND THEY SAID HE'S BLOWN THE SUMMIT AND HERE WE ARE, ACTUALLY KIM JONG UN SEEMED TO BE ON BENDED KNEE, HE DESPERATELY WANTS TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MAYBE PRESIDENT TRUMP PLAYED IT JUST RIGHT? FASCINATING, THURSDAY IN THE MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP WITHDRAWSDRAWS FROM THE SUMMIT, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO, YOU HAVE THE NORTH KOREANS ISSUE A STRING OF MESSAGES, SAYING THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO GO FOR THE TRUMP FACTOR QUOTE, UNQUOTE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING. WE HAVE NOW FOUND THE KEY TO DEALING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE THREAT OF FORCE AND ALSO THE SANCTIONS TO CUT THE MONEY TO NORTH KOREA AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S AS GOOD AS HIS WORDS. LOOK, I'M WILLING TO WALK AWAY. HE DID THAT WITH THE LETTER AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAD THE AT THE TIME, YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THIS IS WILL BE THE END TO HAVE PEACE PROCESS, THIS IS GOING TO BE THERMAL NUCLEAR WAR, WELL, NO IT WASN'T. KIM CAVED IMMEDIATELY. THAT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. LAST HOUR WE HAD A DEMOCRAT BILL RICHARDSON ON OUR AIR, YOU REACTED SHARPLY, I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF IT. I WISH IT NOT HAPPENED JUNE 12TH, BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO PREPARATION, WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO HAVE OUR MESSAGE BY ONE PERSON. I THINK THAT'S SECRETARY POMPEO, OBJECTIVE, A STRATEGY, I THINK WE ARE STILL NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE STRATEGY WE HAVE ON DENUCLEARIZATION. A VETERAN DIPLOMAT, DID A LOT OF GOOD, AMBASSADOR TO UN AND WHAT NOT, AS YOU AND I WERE TALKING, HE AND OTHERS BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, ADMINISTRATION AFTER ADMINISTRATION DID THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YET THIS PRESIDENT IS TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND APPEARS TO BE WORKING. CERTAINLY. RICHARDSON TALKS ABOUT PREPARATION, I CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE HAD LITTLE PREPARATION AND WE'VE THE NORTH KOREANS MAKE IMPORTANT CONCESSIONS, THEY RELEASED THREE AMERICANS AND MADE PUBLIC COMMITMENTS TO DENUCLEARIZING AND WE HEARD IN SUMMIT WHEN MOON SAID KIM WAS WILLING TO GET RID OF NUKES, KIM IS BEING CYNICAL. THE OTHER THING THAT RICHARDSON SAID IN THE INTERVIEW I THINK IS CRITICAL, HE SAID, LOOK, THE UNITED STATES AS IT PREPARES NEEDS TO WEAVE IN CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA, WELL, CHINA HAS BEEN A MALIGN FACTOR, BUSTING SANCTIONS OPENLY. IT'S ENCOURAGING KIM TO BACK AWAY FROM THE U.S., SO THE LAST THING IN THE WORLD, ED, WE NEED TO GET THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. WE NEED THE CHINESE OFF TO THE SIDE. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" STORY, THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY TWEETED IT WAS FAKE NEWS, DON'T BELIEVE IT, THE JEST OF IT, THERE'S A SPLIT ON THE ADMINISTRATION THEY CLAIM WHERE HARD-LINERS LIKE JOHN BOLTON, THERE HAS TO BE DENUCLEARIZATION BEFORE YOU COME TO THE TABLE WHERE THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE SECRETARY MATTIS IN PENTAGON, JUNE 129, WHATEVER DAY IT IS, SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF TALKS AND DENUCLEARIZATION COULD HAPPEN IN MONTHS OR YEARS? WE SHOULD DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IN THE PAST WE HAD THE FAZED ATTEMPT AND DIDN'T WORK FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. RIGHT NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN LOOK AT THE TABLE, KIM, YOU'RE GIVING THEM UP BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T I WILL START SANCTIONING YOU, NORTH KOREA, I'M GOING TO START SANCTIONING CHINA FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND I WILL GET THE RUSSIANS OUT OF THE PICTURE AND ISOLATE AND THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT NOW. THE SOONER THE BETTER. WE HAVE RICHARDSON SAYING, LOOK, COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZATION IS NOT POSSIBLE, THAT'S NOT YOUR OPENING BARGAINING POSITION AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE STRIVING FOR AND THE PRESIDENT SAID CLEARLY, THESE GUYS ARE GIVING UP ALL NUKES, THAT'S GOT TO BE OUR POSITION. NOT ONLY WHAT WE SAY IN PUBLIC BUT WE REALLY MEAN. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN SINGAPORE DO I GET A NONREFUNDABLE TICKET? NONREFUNDABLE TICKET. YOU THINK IT'S HAPPENING? LOOK, EVEN IF IT WASN'T HAPPEN ON JUNE 129, IT'LL HAPPEN SOON, THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TOO MUCH FROM THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW AND WE SHOULD STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY, NOT
