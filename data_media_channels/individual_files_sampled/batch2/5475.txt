Rudy Giuliani suddenly has more time on his hands the New York Times today reporting that he severed ties with his law firm by his telling it so he can focus on the president's legal woes but the firm has a different version of events one thing became abundantly clear this afternoon Giuliani had time to talk to us we spoke to the mayor for about 20 minutes he told us that Bob Muller is the very same man he first met when they worked together after 9/11 Giuliani was the mayor of New York City Muller the FBI director but he thinks Deputy Attorney General rod Rosen Stein who appointed him as special counsel quote put him in that position when I asked him what position he said quote to steamroll the president he also told us that he doesn't know if Bob Muller has the president's tax returns and what they would tell an investigator about the president's ties to Russia he said that he and Jay Sekulow another of the president's attorneys quote aren't there yet on recommending an interview for the president with the special counsel and that he didn't quote get tripped up during last week's media interviews when he suggested that the president knew about Cohen's payments to pornstars stormy Daniels and on that payment he insists that the president didn't violate campaign finance laws because one the payments would have been made even if mr. Trump were not a candidate to spare the family embarrassment and to the money was repaid by the President to Cohen and on this picture of Rudy at the Yankee game he told me he was texting Yankee friends not the President or Bob Muller but Giuliani also responded to the New York Times report which details a more abrupt departure from his law firm The Times reporting on tensions about his comments about Donald Trump's hush money payments to a pornstar writing quote firm partners had shaped over mr. Giuliani's public comments about payments that another of mr. Trump's lawyers Michael D Cohen made to secure the silence of a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with mr. Trump we also learned from The Times that this comment from Giuliani didn't sit well with his former colleagues that wasn't money that was paid by by his lawyer the way I would do out of his law firm funds Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of things like this for my clients his former employer now setting the record straight telling the Times quote speaking for ourselves we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client I read sections of that New York Times article to the former mayor who said to me about his former firms response quote they don't know what they're talking about we do this all the time they do this all the time for their clients here to talk about all of this New York Times reporter and MSNBC analyst Mike Schmidt Washington Post White House bureau chief Phil Rucker also an MSNBC analyst former Democratic congresswoman Donna Edwards and Matt Miller former chief spokesman for the Justice Department and an MSNBC analyst I came you I said inside really Rudy Giuliani said which were a divine pleasure but came at a time the day when I'm usually getting ready for the show but take us through what you reported and what you understand now to be two pretty different versions of events about his breakup with his law firm so we saw the comments that were out there that he had made and we realized that that was probably not how the firm was supposed to function when he says this is on my firm works and it didn't it didn't seem totally kosher the way he was describing it so we went to the firm we repeatedly asked him over the past few days is this how you guys do this is this is this your practice and they delayed and delayed and delayed telling us and then finally today after they put out the statement severing the relationship they give us this and they really sort of threw him under the bus so I was a bit surprised by that and it's crowded under there because he didn't turn around and turn through them on the bus it he said they do this all the time now they're firing at each other over this issue he says oh they're talking about different things and I think was pretty clear what he was talking about when he was on television so I'm not sure what his responses hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
