Neil: ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE ANTICIPATING THAT AFTER NOVEMBER, THAT COULD BE LOOKING LIKE A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE, THAT THIS BLUE WAVE THAT EVERYBODY ENVISIONS COMING IS GOING TO MEAN DEMOCRATS WILL AT LEAST CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. THEY'RE GUNNING FOR THE SENATE AS WELL. THAT MIGHT BE A DICEYER MOVE. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, A NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN, JOE CROWLEY. CONGRESSMAN, VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU. THANKS, NEIL. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. Neil: I REMEMBER LAST TIME WE CHATTED, YOU TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. SHOULD TAKE THINGS FOR GRANTED BUT MANY INSIST A BLUE WAVE IS COMING. THAT IS A CONSENSUS. DO YOU THINK THAT'S JUSTIFIED? WELL, I'D MUCH RATHER BEEN IN OPPOSITION THAN THE MAJORITY'S POSITION. I THINK DEMOCRATS ARE POISED TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE. IT'S ABOUT THE MESSAGE. PEOPLE HAVE TO KNOW THAT DEMOCRATS OFFER A BETTER DEAL. BETTER JOBS, BETTER WAGES AND A BETTER FUTURE. THAT'S WHY WE'LL BE SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBER. Neil: I NOTICE MANY OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT WON, CONGRESSMAN, HAVE BEEN MAKING NANCY PELOSI THE ISSUE OR COMMENTS ON CRUMBS WHEN IT COMES TO TAX CUTS, YOU KNOW, REPEALING THOSE TAX CUTS IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT BACK IN. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT? MY THOUGHTS ARE I HAVE VERY STRONG THOUGHTS ON THAT. THE REPUBLICANS ARE BANKRUPT WHEN IT COMES TO IDEAS. RUNNING AGAINST NANCY PELOSI AND THESE DISTRICTS IS JUST FALLING FLAT. IT'S NOT HAVING THE EFFECT THAT I DO THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO FOCUS ON IDEAS ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. I'M NOT HERE TO GIVE THEM ADVICE QUITE FRANKLY. I'D RATHER THEN GO ON THEIR OWN RECORD Neil: BUT THEY HAVE COME UP WITH IDEAS, CONGRESSMAN. THEIR TAX CUT IS WORKING. THE ECONOMY IS PROVING. SENTIMENTS SURVEYED SEEMS TO INDEPENDENT CASE THAT. OTHERS SAID WE HIT A CEILING. WE MAY BE RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS ARE TICKING UP. DO YOU WORRY WHEN YOU SEE THAT? I'M SKEPTICAL HOW WELL THE TAX BILL IS PLAYING IN TERMS OF THE REPUBLICANS GAME PLAN. THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. Neil: ARE YOU FOR REPEALING IT? I AM FOR ADDRESSING THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES LIKE SALT PROVISIONS THAT HURT NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS A POLITICAL ONSLAUGHT ON BLUE STATES, WHICH IS REPREHENSIBLE. Neil: VALID CRITICISM SOUNDS LIKE NANCY PELOSI SAID REASON THE WHOLE THING UP. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN IT. NOT EVERY PROVISION IS BAD. I DON'T THINK CORPORATIONS WERE EXPECTING A 21% RATE. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD GET BELOW 25%. THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT MORE FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE CLOSE Neil: WOULD YOU RAISE THE CORPORATE RATE FROM THE 21% I THINK THAT IS ONE AFTER THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. WE CAN LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THEY LOWERED THE MARGINAL RATE FROM THE WEALTHIEST FROM 39% TO 37%. WE CAN ADDRESS TAX REFORM AND AT THE SAME TIME ADDRESS ISSUES OF THE NEEDS OF WORKING PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY. LARGELY IT WAS FORGOTTEN IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. Neil: IF DEMOCRATS DID TAKE OVER, CONGRESSMAN, YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR NEW LEADERSHIP, THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN THERE IS TOO OLD? I THINK THAT OUR CAUCUS IS FULL OF WISDOM. NANCY PELOSI Neil: YOU'RE A MUCH YOUNGER GUY. YOU'RE FULL OF WISDOM. YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN ME. AND ANYMORE THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP SO SO I RECOGNIZE THAT. BUT I THINK ALL BOATS RISE IN A VICTORY AND WINNING BACK THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. Neil: SO IF NANCY PELOSI WANTED TO BE LEADER, YOU'D VOTE FOR HIM? I HAVE SAID, I DON'T THINK OTHER THAN SUPPORTIVE OF PELOSI. Neil: REALLY? YEAH. THE REALITY IS, DEMOCRATS THAT WIN BACK THE HOUSE, BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DISCUSS PALACE INTRIGUE. IT HAS A PLACE HERE IN WASHINGTON AND A LITTLE BIT BEYOND IT AS WELL. WE'RE FOCUSED ON NANCY, STENY AND MYSELF AND THE ENTIRE LEADERSHIP Neil: YOUR YOUNGER THAN THOSE GUYS. SO IF THEY CAME TO YOU, CONGRESSMAN AND SAID, YOU KNOW, WE LIKE TO SEE YOU ON THESE THINGS. WE LIKE THE WAY YOU CAN RELATE TO PEOPLE. WE WANT YOU. YOU WOULD SAY? I'M HONORED THAT I HAVE ELECTED ME OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS Neil: YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ANSWER MY QUESTION. I'M ENJOY THE ROLE I'M IN RIGHT NOW. Neil: STEPPING BACK, SIR, IS IT YOUR SENSE THE ECONOMY YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. BY ALMOST ALL MEASUREMENTS, IT'S PICKED UP STEAM. YOU THINK SO? THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN UPTICK. WE LOOK AT THE JOBLESS FIGURES. AT THE SAME TIME WE LOOK AT THE STAGNATION OF WAGES. THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT FEELING AS GOOD AS THEMSELVES AS WE WOULD LIKE TO. THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. INSTEAD OF TAPPED INTO THE NATION'S DEBT OF $2.7 TRILLION ON THIS TAX CUT AND REALLY I THINK AGAIN, GOING TOWARDS THE WEALTHIEST 1% AND THE LARGEST CORPORATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND THE RICHEST, WE COULD HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S WHAT WE STILL NEED TO DO. DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, WE WILL INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE Neil: DO YOU FIND IT ODD I KNOW YOU TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THE MONEY THAT GOES OUT. FOR ANY DEMOCRAT TO LECTURE A REPUBLICAN ON DEBT. I'M SORRY? Neil: DO YOU THINK IT ODD THAT ANY DEMOCRAT LECTURE REPUBLICANS ON PILING UP DEBT? WHAT I THINK IS ODD IS MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE THAT JUST SPENT $2.7 TRILLION WITH INTEREST SAYING THEY'VE BEEN DOING SOUL SEARCHING AND NOW THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE NATION'S DEBT Neil: WHY IS THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE TAX CUT A BIG ISSUE TO YOU BUT NOT THE EIGHT TO TEN TRILLION IN ADDED SPENDING NOT AN ISSUE? THERE'S MUCH THE BLAME TO GO AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLE. THAT WON'T FIX THE ISSUE ITSELF RIGHT NOW. WE LOOK AT THE TWO WARS THAT WERE UNPAID FOR. THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE PART D. WE LOOK AT OTHER THINGS. I'LL REMIND YOU, THE AFFORDABLE CARE ABLE WAS PAID FOR WHEN DEMOCRATS WERE IN CONTROL. Neil: THAT'S BECAUSE OF ANTICIPATED EVENTS THAT CHANGED THAT. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN PAID FOR. ALMOST 20 YEARS LATER AND WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE CAN'T DO IT ON THE BACKS OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN. LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH THIS TAX BILL. WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING THAT REALLY FORTIFIES, GIVES A WAGE INCREASE FOR THE PEOPLE STRUGGLING. Neil: I'LL PUT YOU DOWN AS A MAYBE ON THE TAX CUT. GOT YOU, NEIL. Neil: THANKS, JOE CROWLEY.
