BUSY DAY TONIGHT.

11

>> WE WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER

12
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:17,204
WAY.

13
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:19,206
LATE TODAY, THE HOMELAND

SECURITY SECRETARY KIRSTJEN

DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

18
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:25,446
OF PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER

19
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,213
ILLEGALLY.

20
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:27,614
MORE THAN 50,000 A MONTH FOR THE

21
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:29,283
PAST THREE MONTHS.

22
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:31,552
400% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

23
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:33,053
SO-CALLED FAMILY UNITS.

24
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:34,221
BUT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION

25
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:34,822
PRACTICE OF CRIMINALLY

26
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:36,824
PROSECUTING PEOPLE WHO COME

27
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:38,625
ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY HAS

28
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,827
CREATED A VERY LARGE POLITICAL

29
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:45,265
PROBLEM FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

30
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,767
WITH A STORM OF OUTRAGE GROWING

31
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:50,137
OVER THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN

32
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,672
PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY LAID THE

33
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:53,674
BLAME SQUARELY ON THE DEMOCRATS.

34
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:56,844
>> I SAY IT VERY STRONGLY.

35
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,879
IT IS THE DEMOCRATS' FAULT.

36
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,748
THEY ARE OBSTRUCTIONIST.

37
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:04,016
AND THEY ARE OBSTRUCTING.

38
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,519
>> DEMOCRATS OUTRAGED AT THE

39
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,687
ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY AT THE

40
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,056
BORDER WERE PEOPLE WHO CROSS

41
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,024
ILLEGALLY ARE HELD FOR CRIMINAL

42
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:11,959
PROSECUTION AND SEPARATED FROM

43
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,093
ANY CHILDREN THEY MAY HAVE

44
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:14,628
BROUGHT WITH THEM.

45
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:15,662
EVEN SOME REPUBLICANS ARE

46
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:17,164
CRITICAL.

47
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:18,365
IN A "WASHINGTON POST" OP-ED,

48
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,834
FORMER FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH

49
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:22,069
WROTE "THIS ZERO-TOLERANCE

50
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:22,636
POLICY IS CRUEL.

51
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:25,672
IT'S IMMORAL, AND IT BREAKS MY

52
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:26,473
HEART."

53
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:27,341
PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTS HE WAS

54
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:29,176
FORCED TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY

55
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,978
AFTER A DRAMATIC INCREASE THE

56
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:33,447
NUMBER OF PEOPLE, SOME

57
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:34,648
CRIMINALS, CROSSING THE BORDER

58
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:35,516
WITH CHILDREN.

59
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:37,084
>> THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE

60
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:41,188
A MIGRANT CAMP AND IT WILL NOT

61
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,426
BE A REFUGEE HOLDING FACILITY.

62
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,261
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN TO

63
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:48,462
THE UNITED STATES, NOT ON MY

64
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:49,263
WATCH.

65
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,098
>> ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY

66
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:52,833
THEY ARE MERELY ENFORCING LAWS

67
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,101
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS, SOMETHING

68
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,836
THEY SAY PREVIOUS WHITE HOUSE IS

69
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:56,637
FAILED TO DO.

70
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,472
BUT THE POLITICAL FIRESTORM HAS

71
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:00,340
HEATED TO THE POINT THAT THE DHS

72
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,108
SECRETARY HANDLED A LATE DAY

73
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,477
BRIEFING AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

74
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,245
>> CONGRESS AND THE COURTS

75
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:06,213
CRATED THIS PROBLEM AND CONGRESS

76
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,982
ALONE CAN FIX IT.

77
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:09,949
UNTIL THEN, WE WILL ENFORCE

78
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,518
EVERY LAW WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS

79
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,821
TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY AND

80
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:15,189
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.

81
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,623
>> THE WHITE HOUSE CALLING ON

82
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:19,426
CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE LAWS AND

83
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,161
REDUCE IF NOT ELIMINATE

84
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:22,229
ALTOGETHER THE NEED TO SEPARATE

85
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,630
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS.

86
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,698
ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION,

87
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:25,399
OFFICIALS WILL KEEP UP THE

88
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:28,936
PRESSURE ON LAWMAKERS THIS WEEK.

89
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:30,137
>> MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE

90
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:31,438
DEMOCRATIC SIDE SAY YOU ARE

91
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,173
USING CHILDREN AS A LEVER TO TRY

92
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,641
TO GET THEM TO TAKE LEGISLATIVE

93
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,242
ACTION.

94
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,044
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

95
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:38,645
>> I SAY THAT'S A COWARDLY

96
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,246
RESPONSE.

97
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,180
IT IS WITHIN THEIR POWER TO MAKE

98
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,682
THE LAWS AND CHANGE THE LAWS.

99
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,450
THEY SHOULD DO SO.

100
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,685
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WEIGHED

101
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:47,187
