1
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:10,105
>> THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT.

2
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:10,873
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT NOW FLYING

4
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:12,875
SPEECH AT A POLICE CONVENTION.

00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:16,845
HE HAS A SPECIAL GUEST ON

ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN.

00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:19,248
OH, THIS IS GOING TO GET

9
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:20,883
INTERESTING BREED THIS COMES

10
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:21,850
AFTER LAST MONTH'S

11
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,552
"NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT THAT

12
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:24,653
ROSENSTEIN HAD DISCUSSED

13
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:25,421
SECRETLY RECORDING THE PRESIDENT

14
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:26,956
AND POSSIBLY REMOVING HIM FROM

15
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:29,925
OFFICE UNDER THE 25TH AMENDMENT.

16
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,060
ROSENSTEIN DENIES THAT REPORT.

17
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:32,294
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT THIS

00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,697
MORNING.

19
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:36,098

RELATIONSHIP, OTHER THAN THERE

22
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:40,703
HAS BEEN NO COLLUSION, FOLKS.

23
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,073
NO COLLUSION.

24
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:44,840
NO, I DON'T.

25
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,475
I DIDN'T KNOW ROD BEFORE.

26
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:47,443
BUT I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM,

27
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:49,645
AND I GET ALONG VERY WELL WITH

28
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:50,479
HIM.

29
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,314
B5 ROSENSTEIN EXPECTED MEET WITH

00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:53,115
WHITE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ON

HERE'S HOUSE COMMITTEE DEVIN

NUNES WITH HIS QUESTIONS.

34
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:00,356
>> I THINK IT ALL COMES DOWN TO

35
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:03,959
WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS WILLING TO

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,294
WEAR A WIRE OR NOT.

37
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:08,464
IF HE WAS WILLING TO WEAR A WIRE

38
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:09,098
AND SECRETLY RECORD THE

39
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,434

00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:16,171
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY

43
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,541
WHERE YOU HAD PEOPLE AT THE

00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,076
TOP LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

PRESIDENT.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE 2016

TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

CONGRESSMAN KNEW THIS HAS THIS

00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,905
TO SAY ABOUT THAT -- >> AND I

THE DEMOCRATS IN THE CLINTON CAW

FEEDING INFORMATION DIRECTLY

TOP LAWYER AT THE FBI.

00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:03,652
BEFORE EVEN FISA WARRANT.

74
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,521
SO NOW YOU HAVE ABSOLUTE PROOF

75
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,955
THAT THAT WASN'T TOLD TO THE

76
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:07,656
FISA COURTS.

77
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,558
YOU WANT YOUR EVIDENCE OF FISA

78
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,059
ABUSE?

79
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,494
THERE IT IS, RIGHT THERE.

80
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:13,195
>> Kennedy: NANCY PELOSI SAYS

81
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:17,933
THAT SHE WANTS THE 302S.

82
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:20,669
DEVIN NUNES ONCE ALL THIS

83
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,837
INFORMATION REGARDING FUSION GPS

84
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,505
AND ANY SORT OF INTERFACE THEY

85
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,107
HAD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

86
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:25,741
JUSTICE OR FBI OFFICIALS.

87
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:27,976
ARE WE GOING TO GET TO SEE ANY

88
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:29,078
OF THIS?

89
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,446
>> Steve: I DON'T KNOW, BUT

90
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:31,213
I'M SORT OF REMINDED -- WITH ALL

91
00:02:31,214 --> 00:02:33,949
OF THE KAVANAUGH CONTROVERSY IN

92
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,084
THE PAST FEW WEEKS, THAT WHOLE

93
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:37,252
RUSSIA CONVERSATION STILL HASN'T

94
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,253
GONE AWAY.

95
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,656
ALL THESE NAMES MAKING HISTORY

96
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,157
NOW.

97
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:42,891
PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, HOW

98
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:43,559
LONG IS THAT SINCE WE TALKED

99
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,294
ABOUT THEM?

100
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:47,029
>> I ENJOYED THE BREAK.

101
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,864
>> Steve: ME TOO, FRANK LEE.

102
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:50,399
DEVIN NUNES -- ON YOUR QUESTION,

103
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,501
YES, WE SHOULD GET THE

104
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:53,068
INFORMATION.

105
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,269
IT'S QUITE CLEAR TO ME.

106
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,738
I THINK EVERYONE WATCHING THIS,

107
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,207
THERE ARE CERTAINLY GROUNDS FOR

108
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:58,574
SUSPICION.

109
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:02,444
THE PERMANENT BUREAUCRACY, THE

110
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:03,345
OBAMA HOLDOVER, BOTH BEFORE THE

111
00:03:03,346 --> 00:03:09,485
ELECTION AND AFTER, UP TO NO

112
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:09,785
GOOD.

113
00:03:09,786 --> 00:03:10,486
HOW ABOUT, HOW SERIOUS WE ARE.

114
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:11,086
WE NEED THE INFORMATION.

115
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:11,787
THE SOMETHING TO INVESTIGATE.

116
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:12,921
TO HIS POINT ON ROSENSTEIN, I

117
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:13,722
DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S

118
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,189
TALKING ABOUT.

119
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,658
IT'S NOT WHETHER HE ACTUALLY

120
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:17,359
WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

121
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,060
WEARING A WIRE OR NOT.

122
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,461
THE FACT THAT HE WAS EVEN

123
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:21,063
THINKING ABOUT IT, TALKING ABOUT

124
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:22,865
IT, DISCUSSING IT, SHOWS THAT

125
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,433
HE'S TOTALLY DISLOYAL AND HAS NO

126
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,634
PLACE BEING IN THE

127
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:26,101
ADMINISTRATION.

128
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:27,836
HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

129
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:28,504
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S QUITE

130
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:30,806
INTERESTING WHAT HE'S DOING.

131
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,975
IT FEELS AS IF, PRIOR TO THIS

132
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:34,843
REVELATION AND THIS REPORT IN

133
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:35,611
"THE NEW YORK TIMES," ROSENSTEIN

134
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:36,912
WAS IN QUITE A STRONG POSITION

135
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:37,613
WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESIDENT

136
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:44,453
BECAUSE HE WAS BASICALLY THERE

137
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,454
UNFIREABLE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

138
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:46,555
AN OUTRAGE IF YOU DO THAT.

139
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:48,524
NOW HIS POSITION IS MUCH, MUCH

140
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:49,258
WEAKER BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN

141
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:49,625
REVEALED.

142
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:51,260
>> AND LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO

143
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,060
HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

144
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,629
>> Steve: AND THE PRESIDENT IS

145
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,396
PROBABLY SAYING "ACTUALLY, I'VE

146
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,665
GOT A SKY WHERE I WANT HIM NOW.

147
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,833
HE IS MUCH MORE VULNERABLE THAN

148
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:58,767
HE WAS BEFORE."

149
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,770
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY, IT SEEMS

150
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,439
LIKELY, HE'S NOT GOING TO --

151
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,542
>> STEVE BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT.

152
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:08,243
IN THAT CONTEXT, WHEN YOU'RE IN

153
00:04:08,244 --> 00:04:09,578
A PRIVATE TEXT TO CHANGE WITH

154
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:10,412
YOUR PARAMORE OR YOUR FRIEND, I

155
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,080
THINK YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SAY

156
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:12,848
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

157
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,450
YOU CAN SAY "HEY, THIS WAS A

158
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,251
PERSONAL JOKE BETWEEN TWO

159
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:16,585
PEOPLE.

160
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:17,920
I DON'T HAVE TO DESCRIBE ANY OF

161
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,087
THIS."

162
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:20,889
BUT WHEN YOU ARE IN A WORK

163
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,057
CONTEST AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

164
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:23,659
THINGS LIKE REMOVING THE

165
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,460
PRESIDENT VIA THE 25TH

166
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:26,161
AMENDMENT, OR SECRETLY EITHER

167
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:26,962
WEARING A WIRE OR HAVING SOMEONE

168
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:29,832
ELSE WEARING A WIRE, THAT IS NOT

169
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:30,833
NECESSARILY FUNNY.

170
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,235
YOU ARE IN A WORK SETTING.

171
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:33,802
MAYBE THE PRESIDENT IS

172
00:04:33,803 --> 00:04:36,071
OFF-LOADING SOME OF THAT HEAVY

173
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:38,440
LIFTING TO CONGRESS.

174
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,341
THEY CAN HAVE THOSE TOUGH

175
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:39,708
QUESTIONS.

176
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:40,442
>> Harris: THAT'S A

177
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:41,143
POSSIBILITY.

178
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:42,411
I DO THINK THAT IT'S

179
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,246
INTERESTING, AS STEVE POINTS

180
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,280
OUT, THAT NOW THE LEVERAGE IS

181
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,250
GONE FOR ROSENSTEIN.

182
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,852
HE IS IN A POSITION OF

183
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:50,419
CAPITULATION, REALLY.

184
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,656
AND NOW HE'S ON AIR FORCE ONE.

185
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,490
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD

186
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,758
SAY FRONT OF YOUR BOSS AND WE

187
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,192
WOULDN'T SAY.

188
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:57,826
YOU'VE HEARD ALL SORTS OF

189
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:58,160
THINGS.

190
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:58,894
YOU BROUGHT UP THAT IT'S NOT

191
00:04:58,895 --> 00:04:59,761
FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

192
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:01,797
SUGGESTED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS A

193
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:02,564
JOKE, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

194
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,032
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

195
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,467
THAT IS THE SAME SORT OF

196
00:05:05,468 --> 00:05:08,670
NARRATIVE THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN

197
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:09,137
STRZOK AND PAGE.

198
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,339
GET RID OF THE PRESIDENT BEFORE

199
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,841
HE'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

200
00:05:12,842 --> 00:05:14,476
IS IT A QUESTION OF BIAS?

201
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:16,478
I AM CERTAIN THAT WOULD COME UP,

202
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,846
AT LEAST WITH CONGRESS.

203
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:21,183
DOES IT COME UP ON AIR FORCE ON

204
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:21,617
AIR FORCE ONE?

205
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,351
>> WHAT HAPPENS CHRIS MARKEY IS

206
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,252
OBVIOUSLY IN A PLACE WERE ROD

207
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:23,986
ROSENSTEIN CAN'T JUST SLAM THE

208
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:24,987
DOOR AND WALK OUT OF AN

209
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:30,025
UNCOMFORTABLE MEETING.

210
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:30,425
>> EXACTLY.

211
00:05:30,426 --> 00:05:32,261
>> HE'S GOING TO NEED A

212
00:05:32,262 --> 00:05:32,628
PARACHUTE.

213
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,229
>> I THINK IT'LL ACTUALLY BE FAR

214
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,565
MORE CORDIAL AND FRIENDLY --

215
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:37,733
>> WHAT YOU THINK THE POINT OF

216
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,033
IT AS?

217
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:42,404
>> Harris: WHAT LEVERAGE GOES

218
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:42,871
BACK AND FORTH?

219
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,740
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

220
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,042
ALSO ENJOYED A FEW WEEKS BREAK

221
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:49,278
FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

222
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,112
HE ALREADY SAID, "I THINK YOU

223
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:50,746
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

224
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:51,680
HIS A GOOD MAN."

225
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:53,849
HE NEEDS TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE

226
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,216
MIDTERMS.

227
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:54,917
I THINK HIS TEAM HAS MADE IT

228
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:56,919
CLEAR TO HIM, YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY

229
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
UPHEAVALS ON THE MUELLER SIDE OF

230
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,454
THINGS.

231
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:00,856
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS,

232
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:01,924
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE G.O.P. HAS

233
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,458
GOTTEN A BOOST OUT OF THE

234
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,192
KAVANAUGH HEARING.

235
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:07,229
IF HE GOES AND HE FIRE SOMEONE

236
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,263
LIKE SESSIONS OR ROD ROSENSTEIN,

237
00:06:08,264 --> 00:06:10,198
WHEN YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINION

238
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,434
POLLS ON THIS, YOU WILL INFLAME

239
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,069
A PART OF THE COUNTRY, THE

240
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,870
INDEPENDENCE THAT MIGHT HAVE

241
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,470
BEEN ON YOUR SIDE --

242
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,872
>> Harris: BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

243
00:06:16,873 --> 00:06:19,274
TO INVITE HIM ON AIR FORCE ONE.

244
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:19,808
THAT'S --

245
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:20,475
>> Jessica: I THINK IT'S TO

246
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:22,044
SAY "I'M IN CHARGE.

247
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,979
HE WORKS FOR ME, HE COMES INTO

248
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,080
MY FANCY CAR THE SCRIBE.

249
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:27,249
AND WE DO THINGS ON MY TERMS."

250
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,484
BUT I THINK IT WILL BE VERY LIKE

251
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,386
"YOU LIKE DIET COKE?

252
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:34,222
I LIKE TO COOK."

253
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:35,390
>> Lisa: OR CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR

254
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,658
MAYBE ICE CREAM.

255
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,392
THOSE ARE ALL DELICIOUS THINGS

256
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:40,462
AND I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT TRUM

257
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:40,929
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

258
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,663
I THINK HE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL

259
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:42,431
AFTER THE MIDTERMS AND FIRE HIM.

260
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,265
I DON'T TRUST THE GUY.

261
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,967
HE LAYS OF THE CASE FOR FIRING

262
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,903
JAMES COMEY, AND THEN HE

263
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:48,804
APPOINTS A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO

264
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:49,504
LOOK INTO THE FIRING OF JAMES

265
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:49,805
COMEY.

266
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,940
THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME, IT'S

267
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:52,407
SUPER SKETCHY.

268
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:53,942
ANOTHER THING THAT IS SUPER

269
00:06:53,943 --> 00:06:55,344
SKETCHY IS INFORMATION ABOUT

270
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:57,746
JAMES BAKER, WHO WAS HIS TOP FBI

271
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,880
ATTORNEY AT THE HEART OF THE

272
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,715
SURVEILLANCE.

273
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:01,049
NOW WE KNOW HE MET WITH THE

274
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,020
DEMOCRAT PARTY ATTORNEY.

275
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,355
A MEETING THAT HE DESCRIBED AS

276
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:07,089
ATYPICAL.

277
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,226
WEEKS BEFORE THEY LAUNCHED THE

278
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:11,960
SURVEILLANCE INTO CARTER PAGE

279
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,262
AND THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE

280
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,731
TRIM CAMPAIGN.

281
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:18,066
REMEMBER, ALSO, WE KNOW THAT THE

282
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,701
DOSSIER WAS USED TO OBTAIN A

283
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:21,370
FISA WARRANT, WHICH IS AN

284
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,037
OPPOSITION PIECE OF RESEARCH

285
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,639
STILL UNVERIFIED AND EVEN

286
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,374
CHRISTOPHER STEELE HAS ADMITTED

287
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,242
IN A LONDON COURT THAT PARTS OF

288
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,745
IT ARE FALSE AND FICTITIOUS.

289
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,580
>> MIND YOU, WE ARE STILL AT A

290
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,748
POINT WHERE CARTER PAGE IS NOT

291
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:33,849
BEEN CHARGED WITH ANYTHING AND

292
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,917
NOT A SINGLE PERSON ON THE TRUMP

293
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,185
SIDE HAS BEEN TIED TO ANY SORT

294
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:37,619
OF COLLUSION.

295
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,254
WE ARE HERE AND LOOKING AT ALL

296
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,756
THE SKETCHY THINGS COMING

297
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:41,123
TOGETHER.

298
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:41,790
>> Steve: VERY QUICKLY, I

299
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,592
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU BUT YOU

300
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,593
HAVE TO BE FIRED.

301
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:45,727
YOU CANNOT HAVE A SITUATION

302
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,798
WHERE SOMEBODY SO SENIOR AND SO

303
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,999
CLEARLY DISLOYAL, PLOTTING

304
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
AGAINST THE HEAD OF THE --

305
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,735
>> I THINK WITH THE PRESIDENT

306
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,004
DOES, HERE, IF HE KEEPS HIM

307
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:57,439
UNTIL AFTER THE MIDTERMS.

308
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,608
HE'S ONLY GOT A MONTH.

309
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,342
>> HE KEEPS THEM CLOSE.

310
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:01,643
>> THAN HE ALLOWS CONGRESS TO

311
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,211
ASK THOSE QUESTIONS, LAY THE

312
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:05,447
CASE OUT, GET SOME ANSWERS FROM

313
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:06,248
HIM, SHOW BLATANT HYPOCRISY, AND

314
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:08,283
THEN HE WILL HAVE GROUNDS TO

315
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,084
FIRE HIM.

316
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:11,053
>> Harris: LESSON LEARNED FROM

317
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:11,453
JAMES COMEY?

318
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:12,187
>> Kennedy: WE HAVE LEARNED SO

319
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:15,457
MANY LESSONS FROM HIM.

320
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,558
HE WROTE THIS GREAT BOOK --

321
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,192
>> Harris: HILLARY CLINTON

322
00:08:17,193 --> 00:08:20,395
WOULD HAVE FIRED COMEY RIGHT OUT

323
00:08:20,396 --> 00:00:00,000
THE GATE.
