14
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:31,024
>> WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE

15
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,493
PRESIDENCY IS THAT IT IS

16
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:34,828

00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:43,937
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS WHEN HE

22
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:46,206
DIDN'T COOPERATE WITH THE FAST

24
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,843
AND HE WOULD BE A FIRST- TIME

25
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:50,244
CANDIDATE.

38
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,504
THAT APPEARANCE OF CLOSENESS

39
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:18,605
WILL BE CRITICAL.

40
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,842
>> HE'S NOT A HOUSEHOLD NAME TO

41
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,944
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND THAT IS

42
00:01:23,944 --> 00:01:25,345
A BIG CHALLENGE.

43
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,447
BUT HE WILL TRY TO RIDE THE

44
00:01:27,447 --> 00:01:28,482
OBAMA WAVE.

45
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:38,125
THERE IS IT A LOT OF NOSTA LJA

46
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,159
FOR OBAMA.

47
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,528
>> TWO GUYS FROM QUEENS, THAT

48
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,596

50
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,035
