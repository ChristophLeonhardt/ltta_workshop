on Monday the supposedly bipartisan women's March tweeted out a happy birthday message to an actual honest-to-goodness terrorist Assata Shakur there's an image of her notices it's a drawing though Assata Shakur against the pink and purple background and above her head are the words a woman's place is in the struggle it says happy birthday to the revolutionary Assata Shakur today sign of resistance in Asada's honor is by Maloney espanha the tweet came complete with a picture of Shakur with the slogan is in the struggle pasted at the top in May 1973 Shakur was wounded in a shootout with state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike one trooper was killed execution-style she was convicted of the murder and then sentence to life in prison she'd also participate in a bunch of bank robberies apparently in 1979 she escaped from prison and then finally fled to Cuba where she's been living she is still on the FBI most wanted terrorist list there's a two million dollar reward on her head as David French points out in national review all told from 1970 to 1980 for the be la the Black Liberation Army was responsible for four bombings for hijacking thirty-two violent armed confrontations in the US 16 of those involved confrontations with law enforcement officers who were killed in other words by every reasonable contemporary definition of terrorism Shakur was a violent terrorist who belonged to a violent terrorist organization now Shakur has become a hero to leftist because she rejects the morality of Western civilization she was a member of that Black Liberation Army a more violent splinter from the Black Panther Party in Cuba she wrote a trite autobiography in which she made claims like this quote take hollows bandits yet every time most black people pick up our paychecks we are being robbed every time we walk into a store in our neighborhood we are being held up and every time we pay our rent the landlord sticks a gun into our ribs the rulers of this country and their flunkies have committed some of the most brutal vicious crimes in history they are the bandits they are the murderers and they should be treated as such this is pretty vile stuff but it stirred by the far-left brought up on Howard Zinn and trained to see America as the enemy no wonder Linda Sarsour is welcomed with open arms by the women's March by the way the women's March is now written a full explanation of their happy birthday message it is not helpful they tweeted women's March is a non-violent movement we have never and will never use violence to achieve our goals the far right is threatened by our movement and by our solidarity with other movements our power your success scares the far right they continue to try to divide us today's attacks on Assata Shakur the latest example here's a brief refresher on who Assata Shakur is and why we can a feminist figure Assata Shakur is a civil rights leader who used her leadership position to challenge sexism within the black liberation movement her resistance tactics were different from ours that does not mean that we do not respect her anti-sexism work I look forward to the women's March depending on Salman bin Laden on anti Islamophobia grounds i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show all righty so everything is awful yeah everything's pretty terrible so we will talk about why everything is so terrible in just a

care was this crappy Obamacare replacement bill that was really Obamacare 2.0 it did a couple of good things that restructured Medicaid so instead of it being just a need-based program or the federal government signs an open-ended check to a bunch of different states it actually was a grant based program where they were going to give block grants to the states it didn't cut Medicaid it cut it cut the rate of growth in Medicaid funding so if Obamacare had Medicaid funding going like this then Trump care had Obamacare funding for Medicaid going like that right leveling off after 2020 that was one of the good aspects of it the other good aspect of it was it cut a few of the taxes it didn't really do much to relieve the Obama care regulations and this was the problem Obamacare is the regulations Obamacare is forcing the insurance companies to offer a bunch of things on their plan now Mike Lee and Ted Cruz had come up with an amendment that would have allowed insurance companies to actually provide plans outside of the Obamacare regulations but when Mitch McConnell put it back in the bill the provision did not include that it was it was it said that you could get out of some of the regulations but then you were still subject to the Obamacare Marketplace exchanges which means that it artificially jacks up the prices for young healthy people who want to buy skimpier versions of health insurance yesterday Mike Lee and Jerry Moran who is the senator from Kansas they both came out and they said that they are not going to back the bill so Moran explained we should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy furthermore if we leave the federal government in control of everyday healthcare decisions it is more likely that our health care system will devolve into single-payer which will require a massive federal spending increase li said in addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle-class families nor does it create enough free space for the most costly from the most costly Obamacare regulations so that meant that there were four senators now who are not going to vote to advance the house bill with the tenant changes that be Rand Paul whose all along said this is not a free-market version of a bill I'm not voting for it Susan Collins from Maine who says it's not Obamacare so I'm not voting for it she's basically a Democrat and then you have jerry moran and mike lee said they're not going to vote for it but less anyone think that these four are really the only obstacle the fact is that there were supposedly eight to ten other senators who really tentative on it and that's because the thing had a twenty percent approval rating it was basically keeping a lot of the worst aspects of obamacare and getting rid of the funding mechanism which was all the taxes under obamacare and increasing subsidies in certain areas so that was it wasn't a great plan it had a lot of holes in it avec roy who loved the plan he liked it because of the Medicaid reform but he can do Medicaid reform through other means you don't have to do Medicaid reform as part of the health care reform bill they are not quite the same thing so this bill is dead so yesterday started on a bizarre note ok this was supposed to be made in America week for the Trump White House and president Trump leads off yesterday by sitting in a fire truck which of course led to one thousand terrible headlines for him tonight understand the roadblocks are foremost meant having the vice president president of the United States dancing around getting a fire the party had from a different kind of trunk now we have arrived expire from what president creating a fire in their little fire trucks my trees she got in the drivers doing the same thing doing things the President himself counseled a person on earth and they're like mr. stupid I did it again he's not the only President to do stupid photo ops but this is a really dumb photo op it's a particularly dumb photo op when he's in a fire truck at the wheel of the fire truck and literally a mile away his Trump care bill is on fire that actually is not a good look he then came out yesterday and John McCain one of the things that helped kill this was John McCain was probably going to vote in favor of the Trump care bill or at least that was the rumor and then he got sick and had to have a surgery and so Trump yesterday he was touting John McCain and saying that he needed his vote we hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him he's a crusty voice in Washington plus we need his vote okay that was true but it wasn't enough okay so Mike Lee comes out he explains why exactly hidden vote for this thing and he said this is not a full repeal of Obamacare we promise we're going to fully repeal Obamacare and isn't it I have made very clear from the outset of this discussion that what the American people asked for what they expected when they elected Republicans to the house to the Senate and of the White House was a full repeal of Obamacare that's what we ought to be doing no I'm not saying it's either perfection or nothing I but I am saying you've got to show me what this really does to undo Obamacare is deadly consequences for the forgotten man and the forgotten woman of America I don't see that in this bill what I do see is that we've walked away steadily from all kinds of promises this bill no longer repeals all of our cares taxes I think that's troubling this bill no longer release people of some of the most significant burdens regulatory speaking from Obamacare that have made the cost of health care go sky-high and we can do better but the American people have to demand it okay so I agree with everything that you heard Mike Lee just say so the question who is to blame for all of this because now Trump care has gone down we're going to explain what's coming next after Trump care has gone down because now Senator McConnell says that he wants to bring a full repeal bill to the floor of the Senate we'll explain whether that happens or not but who is to blame for all of this so you're seeing people like President Trump blames and a conservatives will say it's a few senators really stop this thing he said that Laura Ingraham came out today and she says well I guess the Trump is going to have to work with the Democrats now so no no no no everyone know everyone's stupid okay so here is who to who is to blame for this number one Senate moderates who lied when they said they were going to support Obamacare repeal and they demonstrated that they lied when they said this okay as I say Mitch McConnell says that now he's going to bring to the floor some sort of repeal bill he can he used the House bill that was passed as a basically the vehicle for a full repeal and the repeal would go into effect in two years so it'd basically be a ticking time bomb and then Republicans would have two years to get their act together and come up with some correctives for when the time bomb goes off after the elections right so it's actually a relatively smart play by McConnell but it also holds a bunch of Republicans feet to the fire trying to demonstrate who exactly was willing to vote for repeal and who is not already within 15 minutes of him announcing this already this morning there were three Republicans who said they would not vote for simple repeal remember for seven years we have heard nothing from the Republican Party but we need to repeal Obamacare not repeal and replace repeal and replace as a formulation pursued by Trump okay it was if it was a formulation pursued by moderate Republicans but they all said they were going to repeal and the the proof is in the pudding okay Rob Portman today the senator from Ohio he voted for a simple repeal bill in 2015 when Barack Obama was president today Mitch McConnell said we want to pass a simple repeal bill the exact same repeal bill we voted for in 2015 and Senator Rob Portman who is just a weak tea senator from Ohio here's what he had to say about it so I have to look and see what the so-called repeal bill entails but it is a bill that simply repeals I believe that will add the more uncertainty and the potential for you know Iowans to pay even higher premiums higher deductibles so what to see obviously we would look for a CBO analysis of that to see involves in terms of it's not just premiums inductive bulls but coverage so you know I'll take a look at it I'm concerned about something that would simply repeal and its impact on costs and choices in health care okay so there you have it he says that he is not going to vote for a simple repeal even though he did so in 2015 showing that Republicans are damn liars okay they are liars they say this kind of stuff and they don't mean it one iota or at least many of them don't and when they do minute like Mike Lee they get ripped up and down by a bunch of establishment lackeys and hacks who say that it's Mike Lee's fault that Obamacare is still on the books basically here was the deal the GOP made they said hey let's repeal Obamacare and everyone yeah that sounds awesome and they said how about if we don't repeal Obamacare but we say we did and then conservatives went no let's not do that and then the GOP turned around they said it's conservatives fault that Obamacare is staying see we told you it's all their fault they're unrealistic okay Rob Portman voted in 2015 that he would vote for repeal he said today that he probably will not Shelley Moore Capito who voted for exactly the same bill in 2015 said today as I have said before I did not come to Washington to hurt people for months I have expressed reservations about the direction of the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare I cannot vote for appeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians in other words repeal and replace was just an excuse for keep Obamacare that's what we had suspected all along Mitch McConnell is complicit in this he said while he was doing this bill that even the Medicaid reforms that everybody really loved he said that those Medicaid reforms would never materialize that's what he told the moderates it was not enough to get susan collins on board anyway okay so all of these people are totally full of it which means that the new Republican program is basically let's just complain about Democrats but when we have power we won't do anything here's Mitch McConnell lamenting the Democrats who are who are saying that they're happy that this thing went down in flames imagine many Democrats were celebrating last night I hope they consider what they are celebrating the American people are hurting they need relief and it's regretful that our Democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver relief okay so again you know he can say all he wants here but he's the guy in charge he's the guy in charge and this is on Senator McConnell for not getting it together so does he have a fractious Republican caucus of course his a fractious Republican caucus does he have a bunch of people on the Left who don't want to vote for Obamacare repeal yes does um bunch of people on the right who don't want to vote for anything soft yes but his job to get those things together if he can't then he shouldn't be in charge of the Senate end of story okay there's someone else to blame in all of this too and I know that we're never allowed to blame President Trump for anything I know that we have to play footsie around president Trump to treat him like he's a small child and he has to be guarded from the vicissitudes of life the fact is president Trump botched this okay he botched this in three separate ways he botched it repeatedly now I want to know that you'll just notice all over them be honest with you today okay it's difficult to be honest to people who listen we all want Trump to succeed I want Trump to succeed as a conservative I want him to do conservative things today if Trump were to push for repeal and get repeal I would be in the front row cheering I put on a damn Magna hat when he put when he picked Judge gorsek so this is not about ire at President Trump for anything except for he's not doing his job okay and I know everybody has to go out of their way to praise Trump because Trump's ego requires the praise all the time but the fact is that praising Trump in getting the job done okay Mike Pence said Trump is really engaged in the process no he's not he was in a fire truck while this thing was going down in flames okay there are three different ways that Trump screwed this thing up okay way number one during the election cycle he said over and over 1 bajillion times that he wanted to repeal Obamacare he then added no one would go uncovered you cannot say those two things simultaneously that meant that when he was elected he did not have a clear mandate to repeal Obamacare so that was mistake number one he spends his entire election cycle saying Obamacare has to go but I'd like to replace it with something that gives more coverage in other words Obamacare is not single-payer enough right that's actually what he was saying during the election cycle okay then after he gets an office he has an opportunity he has 100 percent approval rating among Republicans right everybody in the Senate is afraid of him what if he had come out day one and said Obamacare repeal that's it okay we'll figure out the replacement later we got to get this done fast before time runs out Obamacare repeal now presidents had Cruz president Rubio I think but President Cruz certainly would have done that right he would have exerted pressure right that's what Trump would have done he didn't do that instead he sat back he let Mitch McConnell take the reins he let Paul Ryan take the reins because Trump was not engaged because Trump doesn't care about isn't because Trump doesn't even know his own policy and because Trump doesn't even know what's in the bill if you ask from what's in this bill he would not be able to tell you which is why today President Trump offered in 12 hours three different strategies for what should happen after the death of this bill he tweeted Republicans should just repeal failing Obamacare now and work on a new health care plan that will start from a clean slate Devens will join in no they won't this is delusional okay Democrats are not going to work with President Trump his second proposal was blame Republicans he said we were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans most Republicans were loyal terrific and worked really hard we will return as I have always said let Obamacare fail and then come together and do a great health care plan stay tuned and literally within hours of him saying repeal and then figure it out Democrats he's now saying don't repeal let it fail and then figure it out with Democrats okay all of this confusion does not allow you to exert pressure on your own members of Congress the president has a job here the president's job here is actually pretty clear if you're in Congress let me start from the Congressional perspective if you're in Congress you're running for Senate you have two things you have to do to win a Senate seat first just win a primary and then you have to win in general winning a general generally requires you not to do anything controversial if you do something controversial you give material to your opponent so if you're a senator you have an actual stake in not doing things because then your opponent can't claim that you're doing anything really terrible right if you vote for a bill with 20% approval as this bill had and then Democrats crap all over you then you could lose a general election right so your interest is in doing nothing so what keeps you voting for unpopular bills and sticking inline with the party pressure from the party right the threat of defunding the threat of primaries President Trump has only threatened to primary one Republican senator since the election jeff flake of arizona okay that has nothing to do with obamacare it has to do if he doesn't like senator flake right he's not exerting pressure he's not doing what the White House has to do what if Trump were on the phone with all of these wavering senators day in and day out saying listen I will primary you I will come to your state and I will undercut support for you I will remove funding I will let you flail out there I will rip you by name publicly if you do this but that's not what Trump was doing Trump was busy playing firetruck and he was busy tweeting things okay so that is screw up number three right so screw up number one was his pitch screw up number two was he didn't actually embrace Obamacare appeal in the first place when he became president and screw up number three is that he has completely abdicated responsibility for this even while people are praising him for his engagement he has not been engaged if he were engaged then maybe it changes the math so again it's not all on Trump but to pretend that Trump is not involved at all in this is really silly okay it's from care it's a signature piece of legislation Obama was heavily involved in pushing his signature piece of legislation I don't think that we should expect anything less from President Trump it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me in any case but the media of course are in full Trump defense mode at least on the right because it's more important to please Trump than it is to actually push good policy which is one of my key criticisms here okay for fellow conservatives Trump can be all the things you want him to be you can love him dearly you can hope that he does really well he needs to fulfill what you said he was going to fulfill and what he said to you he was going to fulfill but watch Fox and Friends read Fox and Friends is basically the Trump show and here is them going after the Senators wouldn't vote for this original bill you have Rand Paul extreme conservatives slash libertarian Ted Cruz I'm going to get my hands dirty make this work somehow they got moderates like Senator Portman listen to his governor and you have senator Collins who said I got some huge blowback when I went back so these people are being through their school just not true to their party and maybe not true to their country the president said before this didn't before he knew that these two he had these two defectors reportedly according to Politico he goes if the Senate Republicans don't get this thing done they'll look like dopes do they look like dopes he's right it's not a question being true to your party or true to your country it's a question being true to your word they should not have elevated the issue for eight years among Republicans saying first thing two thoughts repeal and replace if they weren't capable of doing okay again all of this they're going to toss all this is defeated McConnell and Ryan deserve a heavy dose of blame both of them the Congress deserves a heavy dose of lame Trump does not get off scot-free he is the president of you out of state he's grown with the bully pulpit he's won with 82 percent approval rating among Republicans today despite his low approval ratings generally Republicans still love the guy he has leverage he didn't use that leverage it is that simple okay before I go any further and talk about what comes next I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at mbm T so my watch they wear every single day is an M VMT watch it is a fantastic-looking watch but they are not just making

happens from here so as I say the first proposal was let's just repeal Obamacare wholesale and a bunch of moderate senators said no we're not going to do that and then the proposal is okay we'll let Obamacare fail and then we'll come back to the table the problem with this is that they need the tax increase that they need the the revenue that was saved through Obamacare cuts in order to pass tax reform so it's not just that Obamacare repeal went down if the tax reform is now in danger remember everything has to be passed with a fifty one-vote reconciliation rule that means the CBO has to score everything is revenue neutral meaning that you can't lose money on it you can't create more debt more deficit in order to pass a bill what that means is that all of the savings that are going to have from the Obamacare repeal they were originally going to apply to tax reform if they don't get the repeal they don't get the tax reform and the entire legislative agenda is sung plus the issue isn't going away Obamacare continues to devolve into disaster and now the Republicans have put their grubby mitts on it it's going to be very difficult for them to remove their stink from it right it looks like they tried to fix it and I fail and so now Democrats are going to say listen they tried to fix it and fail they stink put us in charge and they're going to have a point especially after Republicans tried to push a Democrat light program all of this is about us and it demonstrates and in politics if you do not campaign on a program and if you are not clever enough to campaign on other things and then implement a program with the full weight of your authority you are going to be in in serious political trouble plus you're not going to get anything done and so the question is going to be come here can you pressure your Republican representatives and the president to do the right thing and so I'm going to do something I never do on this program okay here are the phone numbers for Senators Portman capito and Collins these are there these are their Senate office phone numbers I want people to call and flood their offices okay senator rob portman today the senator from Ohio he says he will not vote for pure repeal his number is to zero to two to four 33 53 that is his Senate office phone number I never do this - OH - to - for 33 53 senator Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia her number is 202 2 to 4 64 72 202 - to 464 72 and senator Susan Collins for whatever that it will do is 202 2 to 4 25:23 they all deserve to have their secretaries have a miserable day on the phones because they spent seven years lying to you seven full years lying to you and and Trump better figure something out quick care because he's the president okay his agenda that's on the line and maybe it doesn't matter maybe we've all become satisfied with tweeting CNN memes and all that and it's fun but you know if you actually wanna get something done it's going to actually have to get done at a certain point here okay as we continue we're going to move over to daily wire right now but I still want to talk about a bunch of things including whether the polls actually matter to President Trump is he immune to - pull it's a polling a little bit more Russia fallout plus things I like things I hate will deconstruct the culture but for they are going to have to go over to Daley

you leave us a review we always appreciate it we are the largest conservative podcast in the nation already so the question that there are two questions here one is what do we care about and the two and question number two is is there gonna be electron fallout so what do we care about question is something that I've now been asking for months okay do we care more about the we piss off the left routine or do we care more about pushing policy now there are certain people who say that the pissing off the left routine is part of the pushing policy routine I'd be warmer to that argument if we were actually pushing policy but clearly that didn't work so the question now is is not what do we care about because I think that we care about what we care about what is going to get done is what's going to get done the bigger question right now is is there going to be a leopard will fall out now it doesn't matter if there's electoral fallout if we don't pass anything I'm not sure that there is but right now the polls are not good for president Trump but there is an open question about the polls which is do they even matter do the polls even matter with matter with regard to President Trump now I'm at the point where there are certain polls that I generally trust in there certain polls that I do not so I think the Trump is more popular than he is unpopular no do I think that some of the polls that are more ridiculous are true no so for example there was a poll from Public Policy Polling yesterday it said only 45% of Republicans think the Donald Trump jr. met with the Russians okay Donald Trump jr. admitted to meeting with the Russians so he met with the Russians okay this is not under dispute but everybody on the Left had what was just demonstrates how all of the Republicans believe stupid things know what that question was questioning and what people were answering was not did Donald Trump jr. meet with the Russians do you care if Donald Trump jr. met with the Russians and only 45% of Republicans said yes again Republicans are smart enough to read the signals from the polls so when someone from ABC News calls up and says we have a poll question for you Republicans aren't just hearing the poll question they are hearing the subtext of the poll question and they're answering the subtext so if they're asked do you think the Donald Trump jr. did something wrong on the Russia stuff what they are hearing is do you think that Donald Trump colluded with the Russian government and so Republicans will say no Republicans are answering the questions they think are being asked and in reality are actually being asked by the media so I think that a lot of the people who are being pulled on the right side of the aisle have gotten too smart for the pollsters in other words when polls when pollsters call them up they are giving them answers that are designed to go right to the subtext so instead of them saying yes Donald Trump jr. met with the Russians but I don't think it matters instead they say he didn't meet with the Russians because screw you go to hell I think there's a lot of that in the polling now that is not true with approval rating so I don't think there are a lot of Republicans today who are saying you know I love president Trump but I'm gonna live the pollsters and say that I hate President Trump I don't think there's a lot of that I think there's more defiance than there is you know an attempt to purposefully screw up the polls but I'm not sure how much it matters because we haven't seen a lot of head-to-head polls between Trump and anybody else so today I saw a head-to-head poll between Trump and Mark Zuckerberg that showed him like 40% in Zuckerberg and 40 percent that means Trump wins reelection right the fact is that he was running head and neck and neck with Hillary and then he won so any Democrat who wins is going to have to be blowing him out in polls at this time I'd be curious to see like a Joe Biden Trump matchup at this point and see how that would go for him but some of the polling data for him is not great right 38% of Republicans say his conduct has been unpresidential rather than fitting and proper but they don't really care but word associations with Trump Suites 68% of people say that the Trump streets are inappropriate 65 percent say they're insulting 52 percent say dangerous 41 percent say interesting 36 percent say effective I think that Trump's floor is about 35 percent 35 36 percent it's a pretty good floor when floor is a lot stronger than George HW Bush's floor was in 2004 2005 2006 right his floor in 2006 like 20 percent 15 percent and that is specifically due to the reaction against the left and the feeling the left is out to get Trump Sheryl Atkinson says Trump is basically kryptonite smear it's very difficult to get him I think this is essentially correct explain in your book why you say Trump may be kryptonite to the smear I call him the anti smear candidate because every traditional smear tactic used against him very effective tactics against other people kind of bounced off of him you know the smear was just no good to him in fact he was able to grab it and co-opt it and turn it around in most every case and I argue that if he had apologized in summer of 2015 when the first attack that I noticed was after John McCain called some his followers crazies and Trump counter-attack by saying McCain wasn't a war hero Vietnam they were called the media want him to get out of the race and apologize I started airing more of him thinking the public would hate him if they saw more of them but the public liked him I think if he had apologized then he would never have made it but he did the opposite of what is intuitive to politicians but turned out to be the right thing for him to do for his followers so I don't think that his base is going to drop out anytime soon the question is how much of his basically turn out to vote and isn't enough for him to win re-election it's a little early to talk about reelection not every day is a battle for re-election for President Trump but if he let's say he passed it passes not much can he still win the answer pretty clearly is yes he can still win and so you know as long as his base sticks with him I don't think his base is going to drop away when they don't get policy wins I think that people who think that a bunch of people are going to drop away because he's not doing anything I don't think that's right because what Trump was actually elected to do is exactly what he's doing yell at people Trump was elected to be the avatar of our anger and he is doing that successfully and if their policy failures we're going to place them where we think the policy experts aren't from never purported to be a policy expert it's going to fall on McConnell and Ryan so I think that's totally deserved no I think the president has a role and this is the problem with electing someone who you expect their job is only going to be ba and great things and yellow things but do I think that trumps bottom is going to fall out here is he going to go down into the 20s no he's not he's already at rock bottom and 36 35 36 percent is not a bad place to be now it'll be interesting to see if he swivels to the left in the aftermath of the Trump carefully and tries to get some infrastructure stuff done the Democrats tries to pass more big government stuff and tries to bring in a different crowd yeah that is one strategy for getting to 50 he's going to need to get closer to 50 percent if he wants to win reelection but ironically one of the best things that might have happened to him in this entire in this entire cycle is Michael Lee killing the storm care bill because imagine if the Trump care bill actually passed and now Trump owns what comes next in the health care system well Trump I think Trump knows this by the way which is why he's not fully fulminating over the failure of Trump care I think Trump knows it would have been politically poisonous for him to pass something this unpopular and then sign it and he'd have that hanging around his neck for 2020 Michael he might have just saved Trump's presidency by killing this bill unfortunately it also the the Republican failure to kill Obamacare also demonstrates what what lackeys they are so you could easily see a situation in which Trump wins re-election after Democrats win the house in 2018 try to impeach him and the reaction is so strong that he wins re-election but you can see Republicans not being able to get anything done you know and maybe all we got out of this was Gorsuch and we'll find out if that's enough okay so with all of that said when the rush of fallout continues it is amazing that the Democrats are really grasping at straws here they don't need to the overreach is so great from the Trump administration the Democrats don't need to overreach but everyone is incompetent and everything so for example there's a Democratic Representative Mike Quigley he makes one of most bizarre statements I have ever heard about this Russia Trump Russia stuff listen to this statement I think that there was coordination I think you're starting to see public evidence of that coordination not just a meeting with Trump jr. but others as well you know Roger stone suggesting that he had a relationship with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and he knew that mr. Podesta was next in the barrel but actually a paint digital operation well I don't want to get into specifics in terms of the digital operation or any specifics that that are not in the public domain at this point in time I think you're seeing a clear pattern of people in the Trump campaign coordinating with Russians and I think what we're learning with the Trump jr. meeting is when you meet with any Russians you're meeting with Russian intelligence and therefore President Putin okay so the idea that if you mean with any Russian ever you're suddenly meeting with Vladimir Putin is totally insane and this is why people are responding with ire to all of this meanwhile the Trump administration is actual defense on Trump Russia is not very good right meaner Sean Spicer yesterday talking about this is literally yesterday okay talking about the Trump jr. meeting with the Russians here's what he had to say that is quite often for people who are given information during the heat of a campaign to to ask what that is that's what simply he did the president's made it clear through his tweet and and there was nothing as far as we know that would lead anyone to believe that there was anything except for discussion about adoption the Majin ski act okay there was results called Magnitsky act but hit but there was anything except for adoptions um how about like the entire email exchange that says it's not about adoptions how about that like that might lead you to believe that but again the democrats are so so crazy that they're willing to grasp it any straw here and this is what is driving support for Trump again it's a lot of reaction and not a lot of policy and so we're going to have to ask ourselves do we demand from President Trump that he gave us policy or as reactionary stuff enough maybe it is enough maybe it is enough but I'm not sure that it's enough for me I don't think it should be enough for conservatives because you know I whole group of people who spend their days reacting against the left I am one of those people the president's job should be partly to do that but it should also be to push policy that's actually good okay time for some things I like things I hate and then we'll deconstruct a little bit of culture so things that I like I just began it all so before I do that you know I want to I want to first say thank you to our sponsors over at the u.s. concealed-carry Association so you are at home it's late at night you hear somebody rumbling around your front door and then you see the end of a crowbar because somebody's try and get in your house so you go over you're done safety unlock it you grab your gun they break in your house and you shoot them what happens next nobody ever thinks about what happens after you shoot the guy right you're the hero of the movie except for when the police come and arrest you and then they ask a bunch of questions and they hold you up in the legal system for three years and it cost you tens of thousands of dollars to defend yourself this is why you need to go over and sign up with the u.s.

giveaway because that is super cool okay time for some things I like so now there's a book called dreamland by Sam Quinn ona's I heard about this on the commentary podcast I just started it is really good it is I think it won the the Pulitzer it's all about the heroin epidemic the opioid epidemic that you've heard so much about it traces the epidemic where it came from why it's affecting small towns in a different way than it's affecting big cities opioid episode addiction is a very different thing in many cases then a typical like cocaine addiction or or other hard drug addiction the reason for this is because most opioids are originally prescribed by dr. right you go into the doctor you want a painkiller they give you hydrocodone the next thing you know you're looking for an oxycontin and the next thing you know you can't get down to you're looking at black tar heroin this happens a lot it happens a lot we are a country that feels that pain is something that we should be able to do away with and so we over prescribe when it comes to opioids pharmaceutical companies have an interest in us to over prescribe and when it comes to opioids and then it is very difficult to get off of them I know this because my grandmother back in the 1970s actually experienced opioid addiction they put her on a painkiller she became addicted to it she thank God she went through cold turkey withdrawal which is absolutely brutal my dad had to help guide her through it was like 13 years old which is crazy but she was able to get off of it but opioid the opioid epidemic is one that actually can be dealt with in ways that some of the other epidemics cannot be because you can stop sometimes you might be able to stop it at the source in terms of prescriptions you know forget about heroin dealing and legalization of drugs the the prescription of drugs over prescribed and doctors have to be very careful in you as a patient should be very very careful before you started accepting prescription dosages of opioids because they are highly highly addictive okay other things that I like so for those who missed it over at Evergreen State College there was this insane story where a professor named Brett Weinstein refused to not go to work on the quote week without white or day without whites and who's forced to flee the college after he refused to participate right okay what Weinstein is a real leftist and he spoke informed in front of the Board of Trustees about what exactly happened to them pretty incredible do you know that the college descended into literal anarchy and that for days the campus was not under the control of the state it was under the control of protesters that there were assaults there were batteries there was pressure not to report crimes to the police people were by the legal definition I believe kidnapped and imprisoned that included faculty members and administrators others were hunted on the campus that lawless bands roamed the campus unimpeded police were physically and intentionally blocked by protesters police were cruelly systematically and personally taunted they were humiliated and forced to stand down by the president students that held different opinions were by the protesters own analysis stalked harassed and DOX to meaning that their names pictures and addresses and phone numbers were distributed online do you know that concessions made under intimidation and threat during the protests are now being enacted by the college that includes mandatory bias training for all faculty this has come about by an agreement between the faculty being good for this guy the one remember is a leftist ok Weinstein is a hardcore leftist and here he is testifying like a right wing or because the left is so insane this is why the hard left is eventually going to drive everybody into Trump's arms okay time for some things that I hate okay thing I hate number one when people who are not cool try to be cool so one of the things that I appreciate about myself because I'm awesome is that I don't try to be cool okay I don't try to be cool because I am NOT cool I'm super nerdy I'm a giant dork okay the fact is I know I am NOT cool and therefore I do not try to be hip and with-it and with the kids because that's stupid because I think a lot of the things the kids do our stupid so this apparently does not hold true for our congresspeople the Speaker of the House yesterday came out and said he loves emojis is he a teenage girl no just no you know I have you ever seen the shirt where it shows the evolution of man and you know it's got the the amoebas it's got the monkeys and then it goes all the way up to man well I have a whole thing about the evolution of language that basically we went from grunting at each other to hieroglyphics to short with the short phrases to full language now we are going back to short phrases through text messages and then back to hieroglyphics through three emojis I have a deep and abiding hatred for for over uses emojis and yet here's Paul Ryan the Speaker of the House talking about why he loves emojis we text and we talk every night I call home and to talk because they don't think of me as an emoji guy I go crazy on emoji because I mean I do like seven or eight of these things because I'll throw those out there and my kids in my wife I am just not the emoji type person so they think so that's why I just overkill on the emojis in the happy socket music is the part that really gets me and then it says happy world emoji day no no go do your stupid job you stupid people and stop it with the stupid emojis my goodness okay another things that I hate Caitlyn Jenner whose sole qualification for running for the Senate is apparently the Caitlyn Jenner is a dude who thinks that he is a lady and the rest of the world is going to humor him in this in this sad delusion says that he should run for Senate in California now listen if he runs for Senate in California as a Republican I will vote for him you know he still a dude but I'll vote for him because he's not a Democrat so fine I mean this the state is crazy enough I mean Arnold Schwarzenegger is our freakin governor and now we have a corpse walking our Governor Jerry Brown in actual living corpse is walking around as the governor who I don't know where I am I've been governor since like 1972 but who oh my heart Oh Governor of California so if Caitlyn Jenner runs for Senate I don't know I'll vote for him in a primary but in a general election it forced to do so I will do so here's Caitlyn Jenner saying that he will run for the Senate because why the hell not everyone showed got Kid Rock in Michigan and Caitlyn Jenner in California Arkham Asylum is now the United States Senate Al Franken is an actual senator from Minnesota and president Trump is the president I don't know what's going on again we entered the alternative timeline where Biff was able to actually bent on 1955 World Series baseball games and now he married Marty's mother okay here is Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn there's a rumor there's a rumor that you want to run for the United States Senate in California did you hear that rumor John I heard a way how did it get all the way back to you all the way from teleport a LeFort yeah I have considered it I like the political side of it if there's one thing I work very closely with the group called American unity fund that their sole purpose their mission statement is to get the Republican Party to do a better job when it comes to all LGBT issues that's kind of my issue obviously I'm more on the Tees portion of the LGBT and I want people to understand that but the political side of it all always been very intriguing to me over the next six months or so I got to find out where I can do a better job can I do a better job from the outside kind of work in the perimeter the political scene being open to you know talk to anybody or are you better off from the inside and we are in the process of determining that and yeah but I would look for a senatorial run um no okay so just know again I understand that nobody has to have any qualifications these days like being able to read legislation or you know have positions and that fame is a sole qualifier but this is not a door that I think is great that it's been opened all right whatever all right so let's deconstruct a culture for one second okay so the the news of the day is that according to BuzzFeed reporter Jim DeRogatis three sets of parents are claiming their daughters have been brainwashed and they're being held against their will in a cult by R&B star Robert R Kelly three former members of the singers inner circle back up such a council reveal even more disturbing details of actions allegedly perpetrated by the singer with a litany of sex related criminal accusations launched against them including child porn charges is according to Amanda prestige Acoma over at Daily wire they say the young women are reportedly being held by Kelly at properties he owned in Atlanta and Chicago the reports allege the girls are initially promised help with their music careers before Kelly lures them into an abusive sexual relationship the singer reportedly videotapes their sexual encounters forces the girls to calm daddy and wears only bet and we're only baggy attire to hide their figures permits them to communicate via cell phone with only him and routinely verbally and physically abuses the females punishing them for ridiculous infractions such as laughing at male cab drivers joked so this story made the rounds but it didn't turn into a front-page story can you imagine if this had been a country star who had done this I have a feeling that there would be a lot more ire if it were like Toby Keith who had done this because it would actually confirm a lot of left media bias with regard to right-wing people right that everybody who's actually sexist and brutal women and keeping them in the back room and using them as sex the hands made tail which is what this sounds like right The Handmaid's Tale is it wouldn't be it has to be coming from the right but our Kelly is a rapper now what's hilarious about this is that if you actually listen to a lot of rap songs which we have done in our in our deconstructing the culture segments before the idea of treating women as garbage is not particularly rare in in rap culture it's not a particularly respectful medium toward women and their autonomy so I'm not sure that we should be super shocked by anything our Kelly is doing it's also not unique to rap culture right it's in Hollywood the casting couch has been a thing forever the idea that directors use their sexual leverage over willing starlets in order to get in bed with them and then sometimes abuse them right I mean that sort of thing has been going on in Hollywood for years two things worth noting here one is that less cultures which is Hollywood and the rap culture left cultures that supposedly are offering quality when it comes to their actual activity very often or not and number two the the quest for fame in our culture has become so egregious and so negative that people are putting themselves into dangerous situations but they wouldn't otherwise because they want Fame okay Fame is not all that it is cracked up to be because the fact is that even once you are famous what you actually need is a is a place to be safe and away from the fame so you know I think that it is a I think that it is sad that we as a culture have decided to to value Fame over over genuine value as a human being that that is happening everywhere from politics to pop culture and I don't think it's going to change anytime soon okay so we will be back tomorrow and when we do come back we will have updates on Trump care hopefully president Trump will have an alternative plan who wants to pursue so that I can say nice things about him tomorrow that would be great I am Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
