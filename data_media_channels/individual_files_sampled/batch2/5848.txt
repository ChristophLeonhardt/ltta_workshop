Donald Trump can run but he cannot hide from the stormy Daniels story because tonight the porn star who says she was paid to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump is telling her story on 60 minutes Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford is suing to be released from a non-disclosure agreement she reached with Trump's attorney just before the 2016 election Trump has denied the allegations and while Daniels had said very little so far interest in tonight's interview went through the roof after her attorney Michael avenatti tweeted out this mystery photo of a disk writing if a picture is worth a thousand words how many words is this worth question mark question mark question mark question mark question mark he explained exactly what he meant to our very own Chris Matthews on hardball let me tell you this Chris that DVD contains evidence of this relationship and let me tell you why it sent the tweet I sent the tweet as a warning shot to Michael Cohen and any other supporter of the President to the President himself to the extent that they plan on disparaging my client lying about what happened or spinning facts that have no basis in reality after this 60 minute interview let that tweet be a warning to them joining me now Paul Butler NBC legal analyst and author of chokehold policing black men Natasha pare Trond staff writer for The Atlantic and Lisa bloom civil rights attorney for the Blum firm thank you very much and you just told me something Paul Butler about Michael avenatti that is interesting that I taught him criminal law he's a lawyer like Michelle Bernard your previous guest no I can't say I told him everything he knows yeah I think he's got a pretty good case with this contract if Trump didn't sign it there's this concept called statute of frauds which means that there's some contract and everybody has to decide where it's not good yeah I mean he's obviously also a very brilliant public advocate for his client I mean I don't know if it cuz look even if Trump wins he loses contain anyone imagine him actually going after this woman for millions and millions of dollars for something that he's having his people say he never did yeah absolutely okay no Natasha let's talk about just the expectations game that's being played here in terms of you know where Trump's mind is gonna be at I see they're keeping him golfing dutifully probably trying to keep them distracted Michael ever Nadya is somewhat tried to sort of temper expectations in a couple of tweets this morning he wrote one of them not all of our evidence will be mentioned displayed tonight that would be foolish we are not sure what CBS will include but we know a lot from the full interview will have to be cut because of time allowed and see tonight's not the end it's the beginning and then hash tag pasta which he's been putting on all his hat on his tweets and then the second tweet was the fact that a sitting president is pursuing over 20 million in bogus damages and quotes against a private citizen who's only trying to tell the public what really happened is remarkable likely unprecedented our history we are not going away and will not be intimidated another hashtag basta so is that trying to temper expectations because maybe you know I think a lot of people are saying that if they don't have something if it's Al Capone's vault then all of his credit were giving him will evaporate and then Trump is gonna go on a tweet storm declaring victory well this CBS interview is not the be-all end-all of this case and it would be very like he said it would be pretty foolish for them to show all of their cards tonight I mean this is this is a case that they intend to pursue very clearly and it could actually get to the point where Trump has to be deposed and that would of course be a very interesting thing to see yeah but I think that he's right about you know the fact that this is remarkable that Trump now is trying to sue store me for 20 million dollars if he wanted to keep this out of the public eye he really just breathes a lot of oxygen into it and if it were any other president in this he would have that president would've been writing her resignation letter by this point I mean the fact that a you know scandal came out where he allegedly had an affair with a porn star and Republicans are looking the other way and trying to ahead while having an affair with an affair with a Playboy bunny while married to his third wife who had given birth to his fifth child Oh America all at the same time right so this is Trump is obviously subject to a different set of rules but voters hopefully may care about the fact that he is now trying to bury her in legal in legal costs is trying to that he may have paid her hush money during the campaign violating campaign finance laws or illegally hiding a campaign donation so these are things that if they don't care about the affair that he had then they may care about that there's also a national security stance at angle to this which is that secrets worth paying over $100,000 for are very dangerous yeah and the fact that this is happening and it may come out that this actually was the case and it's looking more more likely that it was it makes you wonder well what other secrets are out there that they've tried to this is subject to potential black well Lisa you know the put his voters may not care and they clearly don't seem to care about much that he does but the courts do care that is a sort of the saving grace of the Republic and so I want to play you one of the other aspects of this that's become a big subject of contention which is the question of whether or not Trump also threatened ms/ms Clifford stormy Daniels here is Michael avenatti on hardball Chris here's what I'll tell you the threat was delivered in person my clients going to describe it in detail on Sunday the American people are going to hear from her they're gonna judge her credibility it was very frightening to her was the threat part of the reason she signed I think absolutely when when the president's fix her exerts pressure on you to sign a document you don't ask a lot of questions you do as you're told Lisa what could be the legal ramifications of that if that threat can be proven to be at least credibly true well I would love to see Michael avenatti who is doing an amazing job file an additional claim for those threats because that would take it out of the arbitration the secret agreement where he does not want to be and where Trump wants to be and I also want to say you know I know the conventional wisdom here is it's about the money it's not about the sex and the Trump doesn't have to follow the standards that everybody else has to follow but I think it is about the sex because both of these women stormy and Karen McDougal say that he was having unprotected sex with them over and over again while Melania was home with their infant son therefore disrespecting her and even potentially endangering her potentially getting these women pregnant I mean I think this is just consistent with all of his appalling behavior toward women that we already know about yeah and on the issue of getting her pregnant another thing that people have sort of noted in the the the NDA's these non-disclosure agreement that were signed there is this language about paternity is that just boilerplate in an NDA with your side girlfriend its language by a very careful lawyer who's trying to cover all of his basis but again it's it's not gratuitous they put this in for a reason right you will hear this tonight on 60 minutes but again a good lawyer doesn't show all of his courage so again I talked mister event day so I know he knows enough that he's got some stuff that he's not revealing yet but that could very well undermine the president lets up play Karen McDougal who also had a relationship that overlapped with the stormy Daniels relationship in which they were also having unprotected sexual relations this is the CNN interview with Karen McDougal saying that he tried to pay her for sex well after we had been in cement he he tried to pay me and I actually didn't know how to take that did he actually try to hand you money he did he didn't I said I mean I just had this look of I don't know just I don't even know how to describe it the look at my face must have been so sad because I had never been offered money like that okay we're running out I got to play one more soundbite though you guys that I'm gonna let everybody respond to it this is the same woman Karen McDougal saying that she was Donald Trump's girlfriend she was sleeping with him and that he compared her to somewhat interesting take a listen did he ever compare you to any of his kids you know he he's very proud of Ivanka as he should be I mean she's a brilliant woman she's beautiful she's you know that's his daughter and he should be prouder he said I was beautiful like her and you know you're a smart girl and there's a lot of comparing but there was some yeah I heard a lot about her yeah Lisa bloom I don't have a question I just want to let you comment on that yeah okay so you know I represented for Trump accusers including Jill hearth and she's been saying for years that when Trump assaulted her sexually he pulled her into Ivanka's bedroom at mar-a-lago I think Ivanka was about 11 years old at the time there's clearly a disturbing pattern here what I love about Michael avenatti is he has a legal strategy and he has a media strategy he's not putting everything out there in the first day so that this dies a one-day story he's keeping this in the news he's releasing a little bit day by day the legal part of this could go on for years because whichever side loses is going to go up on appeal but the media side is going to go as well because he says he has a lot of evidence and I believe him and he's going to release it when he wants to release it so I think this is going to stay in the news for a long time absolutely in Paul Butler we're now hearing some reporting that Soulja was questioning whether his advisors are correct and telling him not to respond to stormy Daniels is that smart he needs to keep his mouth shut again there's two issues here credibility if he's been having his people apparently lie about whether he had this affair if he lies again that's putting him in jeopardy and modus operandi this was clearly a campaign contribution by Michael Cohen to help Trump get elected and so that's supposed to have been reported so that's something that Muller could be interested in there's one part of this that's salacious and kind of sleazy there's another part that's very relevant to the Russia obstruction of justice investigations that expand of it just a little bit it's relevant because because it goes to his modus operandi again he's willing to accept campaign contributions and not report them a violation of the election law if Cohen spent a hundred and thirty K that's way more than legally allow to contribute to the campaign that's what called what's called an in-kind contribution it still has to be reported it was it that's a violation of federal criminal and civil law okay well I want to we got them something just just came across the transom out the the producers just put in front of me a new piece out by The Washington Post talking about Donald Trump and his sojourn in Florida why he's at mar-a-lago things that he's telling friends what Trump friends saying that the president told him to expect one or two more personnel changes I want to highlight out one part of this it says Trump according to associates also complained while he's there at mar-a-lago about the media attention that porn star stormy Daniels is receiving calling the entire episode a hoax that opponents are using to attack him he asked one friend how Daniels who scheduled to appear Sunday night on 60 minutes was going to affect his poll numbers your thoughts on Natasha this story has had remarkable staying power for a reason I mean it's it's there are a few times that we've seen those stories actually stuck to the president the way that this has and the fact that they are now trying to sue her for 20 million dollars for breach of this contract just shows that they take this very seriously and you know it's also it's not just a story about Trump it's a story about Trump's inner circle it's a story about the people that are loyal to him and what they're willing to do to keep his secrets and that I think it's a story that's going to remain in the public eye and it's going to be important to people as this moves forward it's interesting that he's if he's asking if it's going to affect his poll numbers because so far nothing has affected his poll numbers the evangelical white evangelicals have stood Foursquare by him last word all this to you Lisa bloom I'm wondering in theory here stormy Daniels does this interview she speaks at this interview does this now open her up to the the Trump side being able to say by giving this interview you've now clearly violated the non-disclosure agreement every word that you said in the sixty minutes interview means you're liable and then she will be on the hook for a lot of money yeah well if she's already liable because her attorney has spoken out multiple times so they clearly have decided to take that risk and they just don't care what I think is so interesting and what you just said if Trump is now saying this is a hoax if he is calling her a liar he's now potentially exposing himself to defamation that she could bring against him you know I just won in the California Supreme Court in my defamation case against Bill Cosby on behalf of Janice Dickinson and there's an active defamation case going on right now against Trump for calling women liars so good luck with that strategy and giving her new legal claims to assert against you Oh stormy Daniels is not going away everybody stormy Daniels she just might be the one with the Cape that people were been looking for all the longer her mother was one of the two of them Thank You Natasha birch fraud Paul Butler Lisa bloom nobody called me at 7 p.m. tonight because I'm going to be watching the fellas right coming up we'll discuss what Trump's foreign policy will look like with John Bolton running the show yay hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out
