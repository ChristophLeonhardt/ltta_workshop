bill cosby has been sentenced he's been sentenced to three to ten years and his bail has been revoked and so this has to do with the case involving andrea constand who was an employee at Temple University Cosby was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in state prison for drugging and sexually assaulting constand at his home 14 years ago the judge Steven oh now O'Neal was very opinionated in in handing down the sentencing he said that this is a serious crime mr. Cosby this has all circled back to you the day has come the time has come O'Neal also ruled that Cosby will be classified as a sexually violent predator a determination that requires lifetime registration lifetime mandatory sex offender counseling with a treatment provider and notification to the community that a sexually violent predator lives in the area now Cosby is 81 years old and so that is relevant given the rehabilitative efforts that will take place here but I just want to know what his spokesperson said his spokesperson Andrew Wyatt said this is the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States in history have you read any history okay I don't know what happened the trial that he thinks is sexist let alone racist but I know it ain't the most racist or sexist trial I mean that's a really offensive thing to say actually you know when you think about all the different trials that have happened in this country there was literally a trial on whether people should be slaves or not that was more racist 101 I think the mistake Cosby made was he didn't run for president soon enough because if he'd done that then he wouldn't have gotten any wouldn't write more maybe get appointed to the Supreme Court in which case they'd rush through the proceedings and and maybe put you on there anyway so I love the judge saying the day has come for you because remember of course does is and does a woman said that he had sexually assaulted or raped them and look as a guy who grew up in the 1980s still seeing him in handcuffs was a tough sight to see and and it's a in that sense it's a sad day crazy because it's he had that image right and and I think the thing that stands out for a lot of people who kind of found him questionable to begin with was the way that he addressed you know certain parts of the black community and how judgmental he was about the way they dress and how oh pull up your pants when in reality he was the one who should have been pulling up his pants you know like it's it's just crazy to see like that so-called quit squeaky-clean image you know turn into what it is now yeah it's like it's amazing that the people who are doing the most awful things behind closed doors are the ones who want to be front and center telling people to be moral and live their lives like it's so bizarre so like seeing him in handcuffs it wasn't even so much as a weird thing or bizarre thing for me to see because he was like quote-unquote America's dad it was just like how dare you go tour around the country telling black people how to be better black people when this is what you were doing for like 40 years I know yeah it's and you see it all the time it's projection and you see it in the televangelists and you know the the people the biggest moralists are the ones that usually have somebody locked up in their face right and lately it's actually literally been true the guy the former governor of Missouri who had to step down had a woman tied up in his basement and he ran on family values you know right and but you know I want everybody be clear that what's sad today is not that America's dad or Bill Cosby is going to prison and God we used to like him and it's sad for us no what's sad is that he did it in the first place right and so don't lose sight of that and it's great that that justice got him because natural limitations had run out on a lot of these cases because he'd been doing it for decades and decades but in this trial this was something that happened 14 years ago in the statute of limitations had not run out and at least five other women got to go testify against them because it showed a pattern of what he had been doing so they also got a measure of justice a lot of former victims today saying I can't believe it's come and you should be encouraged to come forward because this is a moment where you can see you can make a difference yeah I mean it's also important to point out that it took a comedian making a joke about this and pointing this out for people that really pay attention when women have been saying this was happening to them for four decades and I think it goes back to what we were saying about listen to women believe women when they tell you these things are happening because then you don't have to wait 30 years to see the person who assaulted you go to prison yeah look you know I don't know that the person who wrote this article is correct in what percentage etc but but I feel a little proud that we made a slight difference there was an article that came out that said Hannibal Buress made the joke then BuzzFeed and The Young Turks picked up the story and that's when it's no bald so if we add a little bit to do a tiny bit to do with bring justice today then that's a great day in America and and you know they now of course say always should be house arrest I'm tired of millionaires getting out I know I know no one ever makes that argument for non millionaires you know what I'm saying like everyone else gets demonized I also want to talk a little bit about andrea constand's testimony so she wrote a letter making her case and the judge said that he had given great weight to the victim impact testimony in this case he said that it was powerful and so she had written the following bill cosby took my beautiful healthy young spirit and crushed it he robbed me of my health and vitality my open nature and my trust in myself and others and if you remember his pattern was he would bring people in to either his hotel room his house etcetera and and say I'm gonna give you career advice and they'd be so excited oh my god this legendary Bill Cosby has shown interest in my career he thinks I have potential and then he would drug them and a lot of times they would wake up with him on top of her right and and they'd be like oh my god he never cared about me it's not that I had potentially he just wanted to you know he sexually assault me and and of course that's gonna be devastating and so that's what this justice is about and then one final statement from the spokesperson representing Bill Cosby because this was an insane comment as if the first one wasn't insane enough he says they persecuted Jesus and look what happened what I'm not saying mr. Cosby's Jesus but we yeah you did exactly but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries so again you know repeating the notion that this was done as an attempt to you know persecute a black man but it had nothing to do with race yeah Bill Cosby wasn't some like black person falsely accused of a crime like right you have a slew of people who like you did this to me you should go like the fact that you're doing this and saying that it actually feeds the other side when it when we are saying someone's been falsely accused of something or wrongfully convicted of something when you throw an actual guilty person in there in the mix of it like that's it's awful exactly yeah yeah and so in Clarence Thomas always said there's no racism until he got in trouble and all of a sudden is he said it was a high-tech lynching so now in the case of Bill Cosby it's a much more of a mixed bag he did a lot of great charitable work to be fair to him and to give you the full context and he wasn't saying that there was no racism but he did go around the country yelling at black people that they that they were doing something wrong and so now for him to hide behind the idea of racism when it doesn't even apply in this case is particularly galling and you know yeah maybe we should telling him maybe if you'd pulled your pants up yeah yeah I wouldn't be in this situation I'm thinking about doing a tour and they say well look this was a long time ago he's 81 this was 14 years ago that means at the time he was just a young 67 year old when he did it what do you know at 67 yeah people can read that's still learning things yeah it really changed yeah from that time to 81 thanks for watching this free clip of The Young Turks don't forget to become a TYT member today for more exclusive content join now at TYT dot-com /join
