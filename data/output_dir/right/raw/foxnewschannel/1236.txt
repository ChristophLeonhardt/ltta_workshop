COMEDIENNE SAMANTHA BEE IS

00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:14,338
SUFFERING PRETTY MUCH NO

00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:18,375
CONSEQUENCES AT ALL FOR HER

00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,944
REPUGNANT ATTACK ON IVANKA

6
00:00:20,944 --> 00:00:21,245
TRUMP.

7
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:25,082
AND JOY REID, OVER THE LAST FEW

8
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:27,518
WEEKS, HATEFUL NASTY BLOG POSTS

BY REID HAVE ALL SURFACED.

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,522
SHE'S REPEATLY APOLOGIZED FOR

11
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:32,289
THE POSTS.

12
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,625
THE NETWORK SAID SHE HAS

13
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:34,958
EVOLVED.

14
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,427
AND HER SHOW REMAINS ON THE AIR.

15
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:39,430
JOINING ME NOW, ONE OF REID'S

ANN, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,601
I'M SURE NONE OF THIS SURPRISES

19
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,068
YOU.

20
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:47,304
THIS IS WHAT YOU AND I HAVE

21
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:49,339
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO.

22
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:51,875
THE LIBERALS CAN SAY WHATEVER

23
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,944
THEY WANT ABOUT MINORITIES,

24
00:00:53,944 --> 00:00:55,712
JEWS, AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

25
00:00:55,712 --> 00:00:56,747
BUT YOU FOUND INTERESTING

26
00:00:56,747 --> 00:00:58,482
NUGGETS FROM HER PAST.

27
00:00:58,482 --> 00:01:00,918
>> IT ACTUALLY WENT UP ON DAILY

28
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:01,919
CALLER TODAY.

29
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,620
SHE WAS WISHING FOR YOU AND ME

30
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,824
TO BE LEFT IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE

31
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:09,259
IN IRAQ, WHICH I THINK IS

32
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,461
INTERESTING, BECAUSE I AGREE, I

33
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,162
WOULDN'T WANT TO GO TO A

34
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:13,030
MAJORITY MUSLIM COUNTRY.

35
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,832
I DON'T KNOW WHY LIBERALS WANT

36
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:15,599
TO TURN THIS COUNTRY INTO THOSE

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,936
COUNTRIES.

38
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:20,170
BUT YOU CONSIDER THAT REALLY,

39
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,272
YOU KNOW, THE WORST THING YOU

40
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:23,674
CAN DO TO US.

41
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,176
IN A SEPARATE POST, I GUESS SHE

42
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:29,279
LIKED OR RETWEETED SOMEONE

43
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,715
SUGGESTING THAT, I DON'T KNOW IF

44
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,450
IT WAS JUST ME OR BOTH OF US,

45
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,284
KILL OURSELVES.

46
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:36,987
AND THE ALWAYS POPULAR CALLING

47
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:41,325
ME A MAN FOR HAVING A BEAUTIFUL

48
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,726
SWAN-LIKE NECK.

49
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,027
LIBERAL WOMEN AS LONG AS WE'RE

50
00:01:44,027 --> 00:01:46,430
BEING FRANK HERE ARE NOT USED TO

51
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,831
THAT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE ROLLS OF

52
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,801
FAT ON THEIR NECK, TAKEN ABACK

53
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:53,136
BY MY BEAUTIFUL SWAN-LIKE NECK.

54
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,072
BUT THESE NASTY THINGS THAT GET

55
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:57,107
POSTED BY LIBERALS, IT SHOWS

56
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,276
THEY JUST WANT TO GET RID OF

57
00:01:59,276 --> 00:01:59,643
ROSEANNE.

58
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:02,513
I'VE BEEN TOLD MY ENTIRE LIFE,

59
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,681
OH, NO, NEWSPAPERS, TV STATIONS,

60
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,116
ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY.

61
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:07,784
IT'S WHATEVER THE PUBLIC WANTS.

62
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:08,919
NO, IT ISN'T.

63
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,454
IT HAS NEVER BEEN THAT.

64
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:13,690
LIBERALS SAY MUCH, MUCH WORSE

65
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,024
THINGS.

66
00:02:14,024 --> 00:02:14,658
BUT THEY'RE PART OF THE

67
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:15,592
POLITICAL AGENDA.

68
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,528
THE REASON THEY WANTED TO FIRE

69
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,196
ROSEANNE WAS, I MEAN, SHE USED

70
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,398
TO BE KIND OF A LEFT-WING LOON.

71
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:22,366
SHE BECAME A TRUMP SUPPORTING

72
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,668
STILL KIND OF A LOON.

73
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:26,637
BUT SHE HAD A WILDLY POPULAR

74
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,305
PROGRAM, AND APPARENTLY WAS

75
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,706
POPULAR WITH TRUMP SUPPORTERS

76
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,241
WHO ENJOY CALLING RACISTS.

77
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,910
>> Laura: CAN YOU SEE THEY'RE

78
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,778
MAYBE TRYING TO REBOOT THE SHOW

79
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:36,446
WITHOUT HER, WITH JUST HER

80
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:38,048
DAUGHTER, WHO IS OBVIOUSLY THE

81
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:40,884
MORE LIBERAL CHARACTER, WHICH

82
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,753
JOHN GOODMAN SAID, I WOULD BE UP

83
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:43,153
FOR THAT.

84
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,856
HALF OF THE COUNTRY WHO VOTED,

85
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,090
VOTED FOR TRUMP, ROUGHLY.

86
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,659
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

87
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,227
FOR SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T

88
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:51,862
OFFEND THEM ON A

89
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:52,629
MINUTE-BY-MINUTE BASIS.

90
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,498
THIS SHOW KIND OF HAD FUNNY

91
00:02:54,498 --> 00:02:57,067
MOMENTS, FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKED

92
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,302
TRUMP WASN'T RIDICULED EVERY

93
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,003
FIVE SECONDS.

94
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,338
POLITICAL OF A SHOW.

95
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:03,006
BUT I BET THE PRODUCERS, PEOPLE

96
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,142
BEHIND THE SHOW, THEY WERE TIRED

97
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:08,812
OF HAVING TO ANSWER FOR IT AT

98
00:03:08,812 --> 00:03:09,580
VARIOUS SOCIAL EVENTS IN L.A. OR

99
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,681
MALIBU.

100
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:13,116
THIS IS A NICE KIND OF UGLY WAY

101
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:14,818
OF SAYING, OH, THIS IS OFF THE

102
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,520
AIR, WE CAN GO BACK TO DOING

103
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,555
BUSINESS AS NORMAL, ANN.

104
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:19,189
>> RIGHT.

105
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:19,489
RIGHT.

106
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,658
I MEAN, I NEVER SAW THE OLD

107
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:24,094
SHOW, OR THE NEW SHOW, BUT WHEN

108
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:26,129
SHE WAS GETTING RATINGS LIKE WE

109
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,566
HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF, FOR 20

110
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,435
YEARS, TO BE DUMPING THAT SHOW

111
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:34,538
BECAUSE OF CRAZY TWEETS SHE WAS

112
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:34,871
SENDING?

113
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,206
SHE HAS ALWAYS SENT CRAZY

114
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:36,540
TWEETS.

115
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,210
THIS IS NOTHING NEW.

116
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,279
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT

117
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:45,349
TO BE SENT TO A CONCENTRATION

118
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:45,882
CAMP.

119
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,118
YES, I CONDEMN HER TWEET, BUT

120
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:49,753
SHE'S ALWAYS SENT CRAZY TWEETS

121
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,421
THAT DESERVED CONDEMNATION.

122
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,123
IF THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT

123
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,626
OFFENSIVE TWEETS, AND SO ON,

124
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,761
OBVIOUSLY SAMANTHA BEE AND JOY

125
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,129
REID WOULDN'T BE ON AIR.

126
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:01,298
>> Laura: ANN, I WANT TO TALK

127
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:02,766
ABOUT WHERE THIS PARTY IS GOING.

128
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:05,469
I TALKED EARLIER TO DINESH ABOUT

129
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:06,970
THIS, AND HOW EVERYTHING HAS

130
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,538
BECOME RADICALIZED.

131
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:09,906
THEY CLAIM TRUMP IS A RADICAL,

132
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:11,575
WHERE HE'S PRETTY MAINSTREAM AND

133
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,410
WANTS TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS ON

134
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,045
TRADE AND OTHER ISSUES.

135
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,113
YET WE SEE THE DEMOCRATS

136
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:18,214
LURCHING TOWARDS PERHAPS AN

137
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,450
ELIZABETH WARREN, MAYBE COREY

138
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,485
BOOKER IN 2020.

139
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:24,521
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OLD

140
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,922
ESTABLISHMENT FIGURES LIKE JOHN

141
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,324
BOEHNER, A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,

142
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:29,426
HE CAME OUT AND HE'S STILL

143
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:32,029
SNIFFING AND HA RUMFING CLEARLY

144
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:32,796
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

145
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:33,296
LET'S WATCH.

146
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:36,667
>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BUT

147
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,035
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

148
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:38,568
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

149
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:40,570
>> THERE ISN'T A REPUBLICAN

150
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,038
PARTY.

151
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:42,906
THERE'S A TRUMP PARTY.

152
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:43,607
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS KIND OF

153
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:46,543
TAKEN A NAP SOMEWHERE.

154
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:47,678
>> Laura: WHAT DO YOU THINK

155
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:50,180
ABOUT OLD BOEHNER'S COMMENT?

156
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,415
>> I HOPE IT'S NOT A NAP.

157
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,384
I HOPE IT'S DEAD.

158
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:56,653
I WANT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO

159
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:57,187
BE THE TRUMP PARTY.

160
00:04:57,187 --> 00:05:00,357
WE MIGHT START WINNING AGAIN.

161
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,125
BUT I THOUGHT JOHN BOEHNER WAS

162
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,695
OFF PROMOTING MARIJUANA OR

163
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:05,095
SOMETHING.

164
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:05,796
>> Laura: HE JOINED THE

165
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:06,963
MARIJUANA BOARD.

166
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,331
HE WAS ALWAYS AGAINST MARIJUANA,

167
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:11,068
UNTIL HE JUST BECAME AN ADVISORY

168
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,302
BOARD MEMBER OF -- IN OTHER

169
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:15,238
WORDS, KIND OF INFORMAL LOBBYIST

170
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:17,107
FOR LEGALIZING POT ACROSS THE

171
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:17,574
UNITED STATES.

172
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:18,508
>> AND YOU WONDER WHY I WANT THE

173
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,577
REPUBLICAN PARTY DEAD.

174
00:05:20,577 --> 00:05:21,845
JUST MOVE IT ASIDE.

175
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,881
I MEAN, IT SHOULD GO THE WAY OF

176
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,882
THE WIIGS.

177
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:27,884
THIS IS A GREAT TURNING POINT AS

178
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:29,386
IT WAS WHEN LINCOLN TOOK OVER.

179
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,887
THAT PARTY HAS SERVED ITS

180
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:31,221
PURPOSE.

181
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:33,557
ALL IT DID WAS LOSE ELECTIONS,

182
00:05:33,557 --> 00:00:00,000
SERVE CORPORATE INTERESTS.
