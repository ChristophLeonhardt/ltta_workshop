Sears was once America's golden retailer this is where everybody shop it was an aspirational store everybody's parents shopped there and you flipped through the catalogues for Christmas to circle your what you wanted for the holidays and now it has fallen to the point where you can you walk into a Sears store and you can't even find a cashier to check you out so we're seeing a lot of weakness across departments church right now but Sears is really standing out as the worst one their sales have been cut in half and they're closing a ton of storage they just recently announced they're closing about 150 stores this spring they haven't made money in years they've been bleeding cash and a big part of that is that they haven't been investing in their stores some shoppers have complained about quality going down in the products clothes are going to be kind of spread all over the shelves it's going to be very difficult to find someone to help you carpets are just ripped up ceilings are sort of caving in and it's just sort of the stores have fallen into disrepair I think that at the core of that is the CEO of Sears Eddie Lampert is a Wall Street guy he's all about driving profit margins which is great if you're an investor but long-term we see this over and over again it does not work in retail to only worry about the profit margins it's not good for the consumers you have to pour money into making it a good place to shop in order for people to want to go there and so retailers that don't invest into making their businesses better died and that's what's happening the Sears right now here is facing a ton of competition from other department stores like JCPenney which just recently got into appliance sales which was a huge category for Sears as well as other big-box retailers like Walmart and Target in addition to that there's also ecommerce retailers I mean you look at Amazon and you can buy almost anything on Amazon now and Amazon's also just recently got into fashion it's really hard to say what the future looks like for Sears I think that analysts are all trying and investors are all trying to figure out what's going to happen with Sears there are some people who think that the company could go bankrupt in six months there are some people who thought it would already be bankrupt but at this point it remains to be seen
