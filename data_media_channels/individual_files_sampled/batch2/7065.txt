Indiana's Attorney General recently had a meeting with Donald Trump and during this meeting he proposed a few solutions potential solutions on school campuses in case another mass shooter attempts to carry out what just tragically happened in parkland Florida now interestingly enough and perhaps unsurprisingly Donald Trump had a very difficult time comprehending what this Attorney General was attempting to tell him because the solutions didn't include armed teachers take a look the school created a model for security and in the security not only we have bulletproof doors bulletproof glass we have containment zones when the school when the students are in the classrooms the doors are locked so we don't have to go up on the locker from the outside mayor we talked about that earlier that was a concern you had on how that's done this is all done automatically the school is wired directly securely to the Sheriff's Department ten miles away so the Sheriff's Department can monitor in real-time what's occurring each teacher has a key fob so that when something occurs they can communicate effectively and immediately with someone off-site and the most of anybody inside with a gun that can take on the man that's right outside the door that by the way can shoot right through the steel doors as they did in your school well the bullets went right through those steel doors like they were butter you know let's let's watch the rest of it okay all right there one that's a part of what sets apart what's necessary but I can tell you this what else they have our counter measures counter measures that can be employed from the Sheriff's Department within seconds to contain the attacker and that's a critical piece I would invite you to come to Shelby County I just don't know what that means honestly I don't know what that means well I can tell you means when you're in the hallway if you have an active shooter in the hall and he's going around and he's looking for targets we've got the doors blocked we've got a locked up somebody's monitoring and for example they have smoke canisters that can come in and blind the shooter which des tracks him from the his party okay I'm sorry that was funnier than I expected because I read it before watching it and in reading it I was actually gonna say look to be fair to trump maybe he just never heard that tactic before and he's just a little confused by it that's okay and he's asking in front of the national audience I'm not sure that that's direction I'd go but you could argue it's earnest right hey like could you explain that to me and and how's that work etcetera but when you watch it no that's not what what okay what does that mean I don't even understand what you mean show Ana first what does that mean show I don't for a second but does the director have a gun that he can shoot from across the studio in case I have a gun because let me tell you something that that bullet can really shoot through the studio like butter so one more thing upon reading it I thought you know I think maybe there maybe got a little confused and maybe people are overhyping how confused he got upon watching it I realized it wasn't the confusion as much as he was mad that the proposed solution didn't involve teachers trying to execute the shooter like he's like where's the gun I don't I don't where's the gun it was strike he was strangely dismissive of the Attorney General Curtis Hill by the way is Indiana of Indiana yeah was I the only one thinking there might be a little bit of a racial dynamic there if I mean I'd look it went through my mind yeah because he wouldn't make eye contact with him and I thought it was so incredibly strange just if you're asking him a question just make eye contact with him talk to him as if he's a human being show that you're trying to comprehend what he's and he didn't seem to do any of that by the way Hill says more states need red flag laws that allow them to take guns away from people they believe to be dangerous Hill says Indiana is one of only five states with a red flag law it allows police to take guns away from people who present an imminent risk of injury to themselves or others including people diagnosed with mental illnesses who failed to take prescription medication or those with a documented history of violent or emotionally unstable behavior so his suggestions were all about containing this mass shooter finding a way to distract him from his target creating certain safeguards it's just that his solutions didn't provide what Trump wanted which is more weapons on campus III realizes you read that last part - apparently I'm having a lot of mid-segment epiphanies here I realized that as you were reading who would not get to have guns maybe Trump thought oh then I wouldn't get to have a gun mentally unfit people were a little unfair no dementia test with flying colors you can tell what a rhinoceros looks like he's nailed it I just and again look Indiana is not known for being the most liberal state so it's not like he was dealing with Nancy Pelosi's cousin who came in from San Francisco and is telling him this it should have been a friendly situation Mike Pence's vice president's from Indiana the Attorney General of Indiana is here he's got some proposed solutions that that he could brag has worked because his vice president helped to put them in place whatever right but instead the the child heard from an adult and the adult didn't confirm what he wanted to confirm but I wanted ice cream why isn't there any ice cream here yes so sad I'm torn watching that a little bit you know we've been talking to a lot of the gun groups the last couple days and one thing I'm kind of detecting is that there's an insider conversations happening and then there's what the people want which is an assault weapons ban right and banning high-capacity clips I think that this red flag law is probably right on the edge it's probably the the boldest thing within the insider speak you know there's so many solutions that we put on the table that are really not that bold and part of it it's like well why isn't he just accept that you know there's gonna be I guess canisters in the hallway with with a smoke smoke coming out to distract the gunman he's like okay that's good that's not the real solution we need the man it's like the last-ditch effort right right so hopefully that's not where the bipartisan consensus lands so I feel attention being like you know I kind of want to gang up with him but also the scope of conversation I want is actually not represented in this conversation right now right yeah it's so that's a great point from a policy perspective and and and one last thing about it in terms of Trumpets president is he doesn't do his homework so if he had done his homework he might know what the Attorney General was going to say and he would have a reaction to that and think it through like if somebody told me hey we didn't have a conversation with the Attorney General of any given state it's gonna be on national TV and he's gonna propose a solution my first question would be what's the solution and I'd like to understand that better so I don't get surprised in for the whole country Trump of course never bothered to read that never bothered to ask was totally unprepared so when he hears that he's like genuinely surprised and he keeps thinking like why isn't he giving me my ice cream I want guns I want the teachers to have guns and you're talking about intelligent you know solutions here that don't match what I wanted but if you've done your homework you'd already know that maybe you could have come up with look if you're unhappy with that you could have canceled it you know if you're a Republican out there you should be maybe mad at them for not canceling it not doing the homework or to more effectively challenge them and go hey I understand that but here is my point of view on it instead of yeah so sorry well we know that the you know president who has been applauded as a great deal maker is actually a terrible deal maker he's not interested in negotiating he's not interested in having a conversation he's interested in getting what he wants and he's also interested in validation but to your point Adam I hear what you're saying about you know the insider discussions and how the things being proposed aren't really legitimate solutions that would prevent this from happening again in the future my issue is that while they're playing patty-cakes with one another with these non solutions you do have members of the far-right who are not holding back in talking about how they want more guns more guns for teachers more armed guards on campus and by the way I don't think that most Americans have forgotten that there have been multiple cases of school resource officers who have gotten incredibly physical with students dragging them by their hair slamming them on the ground whenever they're misbehaving even a little bit are you comfortable with your students or your kids going to school with armed guards who could use lethal weapons to respond to incidents like that I don't know I wouldn't feel comfortable that's a great point we see the amount of deference that's given to police officers when they pull someone over for a broken taillight right and they kill them and the course let them off what does that mean for our kids until it's terrifying what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole
