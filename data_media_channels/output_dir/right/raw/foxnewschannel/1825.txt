IDAHO, NEBRASKA AND OREGON.

22
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,193

THE ANTI-INCUMBENT'S A IT'S

37
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:02,682
WORTH LOOKING AT TO SEE IF HE

38
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:03,350
MAKES IT THROUGH.

39
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,352
>>ELIZABETH: OBVIOUSLY, WE

40
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:06,086

RUSTBELT.

42
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:15,628
NOW WE'RE TALKING CLOSE TO

00:01:16,396 --> 00:01:16,830
PENNSYLVANIA.

45
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,564
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A

46
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:18,631
LOT OF FACTORS THAT HAVE

47
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:18,965
CHANGED.

48
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:19,733

49
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,467
NEWCOMERS.

50
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,201
SECOND OF ALL, THE LINES HAVE

51
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:21,968
BEEN COMPLETELY REDRAWN.

52
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:22,836
FOR SOMEONE AT HOME, WHY DOES

53
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:23,470
THAT MATTER?

54
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,439
>> THE DISTRICT ACTUALLY

55
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:36,483
CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE

56
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:37,117
REDISTRICTING.

57
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:37,851
THE STATE SUPREME COURT

58
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,152
THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT

59
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:39,819
DISTRICTS AND SAID IT WAS A

60
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,854
PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING THAT

61
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,755
FAVORED REPUBLICANS SO A LOT OF

62
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:42,522
THESE DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

63
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:43,923
REDRAWN TO WHAT THEY SAY IS

64
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:44,290
MORE FAIR.

65
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,991
>>ELIZABETH: WHAT DOES THAT

66
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:45,291
MEAN?

67
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,259
DOES THAT MEAN PEOPLE WHO

68
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,093
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN NECESSARILY

69
00:01:47,093 --> 00:01:48,762
HAD A MUCH WEIGHT HAVE MORE

70
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:49,996
WEIGHT NOW?

71
00:01:49,996 --> 00:02:04,144
>> THE IDEA IS THAT ALL VOTERS

72
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:08,982
>> THE IDEA IS THAT ALL VOTERS

73
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:09,515
WILL HAVE EQUAL SAY.

74
00:02:09,515 --> 00:02:10,583
IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, YOU WILL

75
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,785
STILL HAVE THE REPRESENTATION.

76
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:12,752
SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS UNDER

77
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:13,019
THE

78
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:13,720
'S ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOTING

79
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,788
PERCENTAGE FOR HILLARY CLINTON

80
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,289
IN THE 2016 ELECTION SO THEY

81
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,023
COULD BE MORE COMPETITIVE GOING

82
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:17,791
INTO 2018.

83
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,758
>>ELIZABETH: LOOKING AHEAD TO

00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:22,629
THE 18TH DISTRICT, CONOR LAMB

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,897
BEAT RICK SACCONE WHICH WAS A

89
00:02:23,897 --> 00:02:24,364
SURPRISING WIN.

90
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:30,570
HE'S A YOUNG CANDIDATE.

91
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,304
ARE THERE A LOT OF YOUNG

NEWCOMERS SPECIFICALLY IN

93
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:32,939
PENNSYLVANIA AND WHAT TYPE OF

94
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:36,576
IMPACT WILL THAT HAVE?

95
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:42,749
>> THERE'S A LOT OF NEWCOMERS

96
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:43,483
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

97
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:44,551
THERE'S A LOT OF WOMEN

98
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,585
CANDIDATES ESPECIALLY ON THE

99
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:46,920
DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

100
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,654
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OPEN

101
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:48,421
SEATS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

102
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:48,788
RETIRING.

103
00:02:48,788 --> 00:02:49,489
CHARLIE DENT FOR EXAMPLE.

104
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:50,290
PEOPLE LEAVING BECAUSE OF

105
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,859
#METOO SCANDALS.

106
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:53,827
CONOR LAMB AS YOU MENTIONED IS

107
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:54,694
RUNNING AT A NEW SEAT BECAUSE

108
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:55,528
OF REDISTRICTING.

109
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:56,563
HE IS FACING OFF AGAINST AN

110
00:02:56,563 --> 00:03:02,936
INCUMBENT CONGRESSMAN IN THE

111
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:03,670
18TH DISTRICT.

112
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,637
>>ELIZABETH: WHAT ARE YOU

00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:05,338
SEEING AS FAR AS ISSUES THAT

114
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:05,805
GET BROUGHT UP?

115
00:03:05,805 --> 00:03:06,539
WE TALKED A LOT WHEN THE BLAST

116
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:10,210
WAS IN OHIO.

117
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,511
THE PRESIDENCY, HOW IS HE

118
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:12,145
GETTING WOVEN INTO THESE

119
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:12,545
CANDIDACIES?

120
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:22,589

121
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:29,863
CANDIDACIES?
>> IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

122
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:30,964
PRIMARIES, REPUBLICANS RUNNING

123
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,132
TO THE RIGHT.

124
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:32,866
EVERYONE TRYING TO BE PRESIDENT

125
00:03:32,866 --> 00:03:33,433
TRUMP'S BEST FRIEND.

126
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,135
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, DEPENDS

127
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:35,768
ON WHERE YOU ARE RUNNING.

128
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:36,402
IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN THE

129
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:37,170
RUSTBELT, YOU ARE COGNIZANT OF

130
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,404
THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

131
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:39,205
IS POPULAR BUT YOU TRY TO

132
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:39,939
DISTANCE YOURSELF TOO.

133
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,807
IN SOME OF THESE MORE LIBERAL

134
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:41,641
AREAS, YOUR HEARING A LOT MORE

135
00:03:41,641 --> 00:03:42,809
FOLKS WERE TRYING TO DISTANCE

136
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:43,743
THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESIDENT

137
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,078
AND ARGUE THEY ARE PART OF THE

138
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,012
RESISTANCE WHO WILL OPPOSE HIM

139
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:46,579
IN CONGRESS.

140
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,413
>>ELIZABETH: SOME OF THE RACES

141
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,581
ARE GETTING REALLY NASTY.

142
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:48,948
WE CERTAINLY HAD

143
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:49,315
WE CERTAINLY HADTHE SAME

144
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:49,749
CONVERSATION .

145
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:53,553
I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE ADS WE

146
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,721
ARE SEEING IN PENNSYLVANIA.

147
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:55,488
IS IT GETTING QUITE AS

148
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,322
DOWNRIGHT NITTY-GRITTY AS WE

149
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,825
SEE IN STATES LIKE OHIO?

150
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:02,095
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING AS

151
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:03,363
NASTY AS IN WEST VIRGINIA OR

152
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,965
INDIANA.

153
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:06,900
WITH THOSE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES

154
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,536
LAST WEEK BUT IT'S STILL EARLY

155
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:10,403
AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE OF

156
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:12,338
THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY AS

157
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:17,142
THINGS GET MORE CONTESTED.

158
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:18,043
>>ELIZABETH: WHAT DO YOU THINK

159
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:19,245
WILL BE MORE SURPRISING AT A

160
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,480
TUESDAY IF ANYTHING AT ALL?

161
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,581
>> I'M LOOKING TO SEE HOW WOMEN

162
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,015
CANDIDATES DO.

163
00:04:22,015 --> 00:00:00,000
SO FAR WOMEN CANDIDATES HEAVILY
