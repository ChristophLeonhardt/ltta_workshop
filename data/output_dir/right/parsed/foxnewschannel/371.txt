>> Sandra: THE SENATE IS BACK
IN SESSION AND WE'RE LESS THAN
AN HOUR AWAY FROM A KEY VOTE ON
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
JOINING US LIVE IN CALIFORNIA
CONGRESSMAN DARYL ISSA, THIS IS
A BIG MOMENT.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN
WITH SOME OF THOSE UNDECIDED
REPUBLICAN SENATORS MAINLY
FLAKE, MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS
WITH THIS ONE-WEEK DELAY IN THE
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION?
>> I SERVED WITH BOTH JEFF
FLAKE AS A HOUSE MEMBER AND
WITH SUSAN COLLINS WHEN SHE WAS
MY COUNTERPART ON OVERSIGHT.
SHE VALUES AND JEFF ALSO SERVED
ON OVERSIGHT IN THE HOUSE.
THEY VALUE A GOOD INVESTIGATION.
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS HAD
SEVEN GOOD INVESTIGATIONS AND
THIS LAST ONE WAS EVERYTHING
THAT COULD BE ADDED TO WHAT HAD
ALREADY BEEN AN INCREDIBLY
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF HEARINGS
AND INVESTIGATIONS.
SO I THINK THEY ARE CONVINCED.
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE
CONVINCED WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE
OF KNOWING THAT THE DEMOCRATS
ARE ASKING FOR AN INVESTIGATION
TO GO ON.
NOT AN INVESTIGATION THAT
YIELDS ANY NEW INFORMATION.
>> Sandra: JOE MANCHIN IS STILL
AN UNDECIDED VOTE AS WELL.
AS HE WAS WALKING INTO THE SCIF
TO READ THE REPORT AGAIN THIS
MORNING HE CHATTED WITH
REPORTERS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND
SAID UNDECIDED.
I WILL PROBABLY BE UNDECIDED
UNTIL I WALK IN THE DOOR.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM HIM?
>> HE IS A THOUGHTFUL MEMBER.
I KNEW HIM WHEN HE FIRST CAME
TO THE SENATE AND HE CAME UP
AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF.
WE CHATTED.
AND WE GOT TO BE WHAT I WOULD
CALL FRIENDS.
HE IS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A PARTY
THAT HE WILL ALIGN WITH.
HE WILL ALIGN WITH THE TRUTH.
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS
HISTORY ON OTHER CONFIRMATIONS,
HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE
DEMOCRATS WHO, WHEN HE THOUGHT
SOMEBODY WAS QUALIFIED, VOTED
FOR THEM AND PERHAPS IS ONE OF
THE FIRST CROSSOVERS.
SO I'M NOT GOING TO PREDICT HIS
VOTE.
WHAT I'LL SAY IS HE IS A
THOUGHTFUL MEMBER WHO WILL VOTE
HIS CONSCIENCE.
>> Sandra: HE WAS ASKED WHAT
ARE YOU WEIGHING THE MOST?
HIS RESPONSE WAS EVERYTHING.
CONGRESSMAN FOR THOSE STILL
UNDECIDED AS THEY WALK IN TO
PLACE THEIR VOTES THIS MORNING,
THIS FIRST VOTE ON THE
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION, TO BE
CLEAR, MINDS CAN CHANGE AND CAN
CHANGE THE VOTE IN THE VOTE
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TOMORROW
AFTER THE 30 HOURS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE
UNDECIDED SENATORS ARE WEIGHING
THE MOST RIGHT NOW?
>> I THINK IF THEY'RE DOING
WHAT I HOPE THEY WOULD DO IS
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE LAST 25
YEARS OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND
THEY'RE ASKING I'M A SENATOR,
HOW WOULD I BE IF YOU HAD TO GO
BACK FURTHER THAN 25 YEARS?
IF YOU HAD TO GO BACK TO JUNIOR
HIGH OR HIGH SCHOOL?
AM I A GOOD SENATOR?
BECAUSE TODAY I DO MY JOB OR AM
I A GOOD SENATOR BECAUSE I'VE
NEVER DONE ANY WRONG AND NEVER
ANY MISTAKES INCLUDING AN EXTRA
BEER.
