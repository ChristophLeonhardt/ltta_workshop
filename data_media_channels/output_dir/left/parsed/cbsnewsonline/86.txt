COURT.  
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN 
ARRAIGNMENT IN COURT.  
HE FACES MULTIPLE MURDER 
CHARGES IN CONNECTION TO DEATHS 
OF HIS PREGNANT WIFE AND THEIR 
TWO DAUGHTERS.  
WE'VE GOT ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CASE 
JUST YESTERDAY.  
APPARENTLY HE'S ADMITTING TO 
KILLING HIS WIFE.  
HE SAYS HE DID IT IN A FIT OF 
RAGE AFTER SHE KILLED THEIR 
DAUGHTERS.  
THE STORY GETS MORE AND MORE 
INTERESTING AS WE GO ALONG.  
WE'LL BRING YOU THE DETAILS.  
HELLO EVERYONE.  
I'M ANNE-MARIE GREEN. 
THERE'S ANOTHER STORY BREAKING. 
MOLLIE TIBBETTS, THE BODY OF 
MOLLIE HAS BEEN FOUND.  
CBS NEWS LEARNED SHE HAS BEEN 
FOUND DEAD.  
SHE WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA 
STUDENT THAT WENT MISSING A 
MONTH AGO AFTER JOGGING IN AND 
AROUND HER HOMETOWN OF 
BROOKLYN, IOWA.  
WE NOW KNOW THAT HER BODY WAS 
FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY 
OF A NEARBY TOWN, ABOUT A 15 
MINUTE DRIVE AWAY.  
IT WAS FOUND EARLY THIS 
MORNING.  
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.  
WE'RE WAITING MORE DETAILS FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT.  
A LITTLE EARLIER, VLAD AND I 
SPOKE TO FBI EMPLOYEE PROFILER 
ABOUT THIS.  
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THE TOOLS 
INVESTIGATORS WILL USE TO USE 
AND TRACK HER DOWN.  
SADLY THE DISCUSSION BECOMES 
THE TOOLS INVESTIGATORS WILL 
USE WITH THE RECOVERY OF THE 
BODY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT 
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. 
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.  
THERE WILL BE TWO 
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING 
ON NOW.  
THE FIRST ONE, THEY'LL DO IT 
SIMULTANEOUS OF COURSE.  
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL COME 
IN AND DO THE AUTOPSY.  
THE WOUND PATHOLOGY WILL BE 
VERY IMPORTANT.  
IT WILL BE UP TO THE MEDICAL 
EXAMINER TO DETERMINE IF MANNER 
AND CAUSE OF DEATH.  
THE MANNER OF DEATH WOULD BE 
HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, ACCIDENTAL, 
UNDETERMINED.  
IF IT'S A HOMICIDE, HOW WAS 
THAT CARRIED OUT. 
THAT'S LEFT UP TO THE MEDICAL 
EXAMINER WHO WILL ALSO DO OTHER 
KINDS OF TESTING IN AN EFFORT 
TO IDENTIFY FORENSIC EVIDENCE 
ON HER BODY.  
THEN AT THE SAME TIME, 
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE 
THOROUGHLY GOING THROUGH THE 
SCENE WHERE MOLLIE'S BODY WAS 
RECOVERED TO TRY TO DETERMINE 
AND IDENTIFY FORENSIC EVIDENCE 
FROM THAT SCENE. 
>> AND THE NATURE OF HOW SHE 
WAS KILLED, IF IT'S DETERMINED 
IT'S NOT SUICIDE OR ACCIDENTAL, 
THAT CAN TELL US A LOT ABOUT 
THE PERPETRATOR. 
>> YES, IT REALLY CAN BECAUSE 
UNLIKE WHAT'S ON TV SHOWS, WHEN 
SOMEONE IS THE VICTIM OF A 
HOMICIDE, THE OFFENDER WILL 
UNKNOWINGLY AND UNWITTINGLY 
OFTEN TIMES LEAVE FORENSIC 
EVIDENCE ON THE CLOTHING AND 
BODY.  
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE HOPE AND 
EFFORT TO RETRIEVE DNA FROM THE 
CLOTHING AND BODY AS WELL.  
NOW DNA IS AT A POINT IT'S 
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL 
IDENTIFYING OFFENDERS.  
THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT 
EFFORT TO OBTAIN AND PROCESS 
THAT FORENSIC EVIDENCE. 
>> YOU'RE A PROFILER, SO YOU 
KNOW THAT BEYOND DNA, THERE ARE 
OTHER SORT OF THINGS YOU CAN 
DEDUCE ABOUT WHO THIS PERSON 
MIGHT BE BASED ON HOW THEY'VE 
HANDLED THE BODY, BASED ON WHAT 
THE WOUNDS LOOK LIKE AND THAT 
SORT OF THING. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.  
PENDING ON -- I DON'T MEAN MEAN 
TO BE TOO GRAPHIC, BUT 
DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF 
THE BODY, THEY'LL LOOK FOR 
DEFENSIVE INJURIES, POST MOR 
MORTEM MUTILATION.  
ANIMALS CAN LEAVE MARKS ON 
VICTIM'S BODIES IF THEY'RE LEFT 
OUTSIDE.  
THEY'LL HAVE TO SEPARATE THOSE 
TWO.  
THEY'LL DETERMINE IF IT IS A 
HOMICIDE, IF THAT WAS THE 
HOMICIDE SCENE AND BODY 
DISPOSAL SCENE.  
THAT'S ALSO TELLING.  
IF IT'S REALLY DETERMINED 
THAT'S ONLY WHERE MOLLIE'S BODY 
WAS LEFT, THEN WE HAVE A 
HOMICIDE SCENE.  
IF IT'S DETERMINED TO BE A 
HOMICIDE, THEN THERE'S ANOTHER 
SCENE OUT THERE THAT THEY'LL BE 
LOOKING FOR.  
AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
COLLECTIVELY CAN TELL US MORE 
ABOUT THE OFFENDER AND ALSO 
ABOUT THE MOTIVATION.  
I SHOULD SAY IF IT IS 
DETERMINED TO BE A HOMICIDE, 
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL ALSO 
BE LOOKING FOR INDICATIONS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
.

FREDRICK, COLORADO WHERE YOU 
CAN SEE CHRISTOPHER WATTS IN 
COURT FOR HIS ARRAIGNMENT.

IN THE CASE, RESERVE PROOF 
HEARING AND SET ABOUT 60 DAYS 
OUT. 
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, HE'S 
WAIVING HIS RIGHT TO HAVE A 
PRELIMINARY HEARING WITHIN 35

HE'S PRESERVING RIGHT TO HAVE 
HEARINGS IN THE FUTURE BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY 35 DAYS.  
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> YES, YOUR HONOR. 
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT MR. WATTS?  
DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS? 
>> NO, SIR. 
>> DO YOU HAVE OBJECTION TO 
THAT REQUEST? 
>> NO, YOUR HONOR. 
>> OKAY.  
LET ME GIVE YOU A DATE THAT.  
60 DAYS IS ABOUT OCTOBER 20th 
OR SO. 
I HAVE OCTOBER 11th. 
DOES THAT STATE WORK FOR THE 
PARTIES?  
I CAN GO FURTHER IF YOU'D LIKE. 
>> I THINK A LITTLE FURTHER 
WOULD MAKE SENSE, YOUR HONOR.  
THANK YOU. 
>> HOW ABOUT NOVEMBER 19th?  
WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR 
LAWYERS.  
LET ME LET THE COURT KNOW MR. 
WATTS IS WAIVING HIS RIGHT TO 
HAVE A PRELIMINARY HEARING

BE.  
NEXT COURT DATE IS IN INCLUSION 
16.  
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, 
COMMENTS, CONCERNS, ANYTHING 
THAT WE CAN ADDRESS TODAY 
BEFORE RECESSING? 
>> I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE 
THINGS OUTSTANDING.  
FIRST, I WANT TO ADDRESS ONE 
WITH RESPECT TO STANDING ORDER 
THAT THE COURT ENTERED 
YESTERDAY.  
BY ITS TERMS, WHEN THE COURT 
DETERMINES THE AREAS, THAT 
INCLUDES MY OFFICE.  
I WANT TO MAKE A REQUEST FOR 
CLARIFICATION, THIS DOES NOT 
REQUIRE THE CONDUCT OCCURS IN 
MY OFFICE. 
>> OTHERWISE, I HAVE A COPY OF 
THIS IN MY OFFICE AND WILL 
PROVIDE IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> ALSO NOT ISSUING A CASE 
MANAGEMENT ORDER LATER TODAY.  
IF YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED OVER THAT 
-- 
>> I DON'T KNOW IF COURT HAS 
DESIRE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE 
OTHER OUTSTANDING MOTIONS THAT 
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER' OFFICE 
FILE HAD THE WE ENTERED OR 
FILED RESPONSES TO.  
WE HAVE NOT ADDRESSED MOTION 2, 
3, 5, 7.  FOR THE RECORD, OUR 
RESPONSES WERE C,D, E, F. 
>> I KNOW A NUMBER OF ORDERS 
WERE ISSUED YESTERDAY. 
>> I RECEIVED WRITTEN ORDERS, 
BUT NOT AS IT RELATES TO THOSE 
FOUR.  
THEY HAVEN'T REACHED MY DESK 
YET. 
>> IF THEY HAVEN'T YET, I'LL 
ISSUE. 
>> DOES THIS INCLUDE -- I 
DIDN'T GET THE ORDER.  
MOTION 5 AND QUESTION 7.  DOES 
THAT INCLUDE MOTIONS 2 AND 3? 
>> REMIND ME 2 AND 3. 
>> MOTION 2 IS ALLOW 
CONFIDENTIAL EXPERTS TO BE 
PRESENT FOR ANY TESTING.  
WE DID HAVE A BIT OF ADDITIONAL 
ARGUMENT ON THAT IF THE COURT 
WANTED TO HEAR IT.  
MOTION 3 IS A PROTECTIVE ORDER. 
>> I PREFER THEY PUT IT IN 
WRITING.  
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S TIME 
SENSITIVE? 
>> I THINK IT COULD BE YOUR 
HONOR.  
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY, BUT IT COULD BE. 
>> I COULD TELL THE COURT 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MR. WALSH IS 
REFERRING TO IS NOT SOMETHING 
THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR IN THE 
NEXT DAY OR TWO.  
IT'S NOT TIME SENSITIVE IN THAT 
RESPECT. 
>> I WOULD LIKE IT IN WRITING. 
>> THIS COURT WILL ISSUE A 
DEADLINE FOR THAT? 
>> I CAN HAVE IT DONE IN A DAY 
OR TWO. 
>> OKAY. 
>> SO, YOU HAVE WHERE THE 
TESTING IS GOING TO OCCUR? 
>> ABSOLUTELY.  
I CAN MAKE CLEAR TO FORENSIC 
AGENTS PENDING THE RECEIPT OF 
COURT ORDER ON THIS FOR 
FORENSIC TESTING. 
>> THAT COULD BE GREAT. 
>> DO YOU HAVE TIME TO FOLLOW 
UP WITH RESPONSE? 
>> IF NECESSARY.  
IF I COULD HAVE THREE BUSINESS 
DAYS TO FILE A RESPONSE TO 
WHATEVER MR. WALSH FILES IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE DAYS.  
I'D APPRECIATE THAT. 
>> MR. WALSH FILED BY CLOSE OF 
BUSINESS ON MONDAY? 
>> YES, SIR. 
>> I'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO THE 
PARTIES. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> ANY OTHER ISSUES NEEDING TO 
BE RESOLVED TODAY? 
>> NO, YOUR HONOR. 
>> OKAY.  
WE ARE IN RECESS.  
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  
. 
>>> SO WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE ARRAIGNMENT HERE OF 
CHRISTOPHER WATTS.  
HE IS THE MAN ACCUSED OF 
KILLING HIS ENTIRE FAMILY.  
HIS WIFE SHANANN, TWO DAUGHTERS 
BELLA AND CELESTE.  
HE'S FACING FIVE COUNTS OF 
FIRST DEGREE MURDER.  
THREE COUNTS OF COURSE FOR THE 
THREE PEOPLE KILLED.  
ALSO TWO SPECIAL COUNTS OF 
MURDER THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE 
KILLING OF A MINOR WHEN YOU'RE 
IN A POSITION OF TRUST.  
THAT'S A SPECIAL CHARGE THERE. 
HE'S FACING A CHARGE FOR 
UNLAWFUL TERMINATION OF A 
PREGNANCY.  
HIS WIFE WAS 15 WEEKS PREGNANT 
WITH THEIR SON. 
YOU SAW CHRISTOPHER WATTS' 
FACE.  
HE WAS STONE FACED.  
DIFFICULT TO READ HIS EMOTIONS. 
THAT STANDS CONTRAST TO FACE 
AND EMOTIONS COMING FROM 
SHANANN'S FATHER WHO WAS 
SITTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD 
DOWN.  
IT CERTAINLY LOOKED AS IF HE 
WAS CRYING OR TRYING TO HOLD 
BACK TEARS.  
YOU KNOW, WE WATCHED 
CHRISTOPHER WATTS IN FRONT OF 
THE CAMERAS MAKE A DESPERATE 
APPEAL FOR RETURN OF HIS 
FAMILY.  
NOW WHAT THE PROSECUTION IS 
ALLEGING IS HE ISES RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THEIR DEATHS DESPITE THE 
FACT HE TOLD POLICE OFFICERS HE 
DID KILL HIS WIFE, THAT HE HAD 
TOLD HIS WIFE HE WANTED A 
SEPARATION BECAUSE HE WAS 
HAVING AN AFFAIR.  
HE SAYS HE KILLED HIS WIFE BUT 
ONLY IN A FIT OF RAGE BECAUSE 
AFTER HE INFORMED HER HE WANTED 
TO LEAVE HER, HE WITNESSED HER 
KILLING THEIR TWO DAUGHTERS. 
CLEARLY THE POLICE AND THE 
PROSECUTION ARE NOT BUYING THAT 
STORY BECAUSE THEY CHARGED HIM 
WITH MURDERS OF ALL THREE OF 
HIS FAMILY MEMBERS, HIS TWO 
BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS AND HIS 
WIFE AND ALSO HIS SOON TO BE 
BORN SON NIKO. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK FROM HERE.  
IF THERE'S INFORMATION ON THIS 
CASE OR ANOTHER CASE WE'RE 
WATCHING, MOLLIE TIBBETTS, HER 
BODY HAS BEEN DISCOVERED.  
WE'LL GET INFORMATION AND BRING 
THAT TO YOU.  
FOR NOW, YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
