BBC documentary about the devastating terror attack on the Manchester Arena has been praised for showing the courageousness of the survivors but the broadcaster's insight has left the UK police furious Greater Manchester's police chief has issued an open letter condemning what he calls wholly inaccurate reporting and the strongly worded statement has even accused the BBC of breaching its own guidelines the programme at least by inference wrongly suggested that GMP officers and staff were held back on the night of the attack this is untrue and is an unwarranted attack on GMP police officers who as the actual footage showed acted bravely in response to this horrific attack the police did not specify exactly which fragments of the BBC film they believe misrepresented their response on the night of that tragedy however the documentary does contain a lot of interviews with victims who are left frustrated by the police inaction large force of policemen come in not really any of them were helping they were there to just secure premises income police officers with guns pointing towards me add I said was at the console team son I'm here to try and save lives I was literally going come on I just remember going we can I could see it wasn't their decision of course airing criticism isn't an issue as long as Manchester police can give their side of the story the catches they can't do that during an active investigation the BBC production team were made aware of this but when Manchester authorities saw how the film showed their lack of comments they were far from happy the reference at the end of the program that GMP refused to cooperate is wholly misleading and was focused only on creating journalistic drama the BBC insists that they did report on the situation on Manchester police accurately and say that the caption on the screen only said Greater Manchester Police declined to take part in this film which they say is factually accurate the BBC actually say that it is the chief constables letter that is accurate defending their decision to include those criticisms claiming that they fully adhere to the BBC editorial guidelines this was a responsible accurate and thoughtful documentary which was an important piece of public service broadcasting however as this very public disagreement unfolds according to one former police officer there's good reason for GM P's response the treatment is that when this is perhaps all gay may seem harsh but the the priority for the police is to try to catch the perpetrators and anybody associated with them I think the reason that the the police disengaged from for any conversation in the formation this film was that they sensed that it was going to be prejudicial to the general good it's very easy to criticize with the wisdom of hindsight but they are actually doing it you know for the purposes of the public good and to try to keep us safe and arrest people that are doing dangerous horrible and wicked things with the battle over who's right and who's wrong likely to continue it's certain that the Rab between Britain's main broadcaster and law enforcement was not the effect a documentary remembering a tragic event intended to have Madeira Tudor our tea you
