CAPITOL HILL INVOLVING HOUSE REPUBLICANS, THEIR EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN FOOD STAMP WORK REQUIREMENTS, AND THE PUSH TO RESOLVE LINGERING ISSUES OVER IMMIGRATION. CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL TONIGHT ON THE TACTICS IN THE STRATEGY. Reporter: THERE COULD NOT BE A BETTER TIME TO TAKE ACTION TO HELP MORE PEOPLE JOIN OUR WORKFORCE. PART OF THE HOUSE SPEAKER'S PITCH FOR SUPPORT OF A FIVE-YEAR FARMVILLE EXTENSION. BUT AS G.O.P. LEADERS TRY TO ROUND UP THE FINAL VOTES TO PASS IT, DOWNSTREAM CAUCUSES TRYING TO FLEX SOME MUSCLE ON IMMIGRATION IN EXCHANGE FOR SUPPORT ON THE FARM BILL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE A VOTE ON IMMIGRATION BEFORE WE HAVE A VOTE ON THE FARM BILL. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CONVINCE ANY OF OUR MEMBERS TO GO FROM NO TO YES ON THE FARM BILL. SO WE WILL HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS TONIGHT WITH LEADERSHIP. AT THIS POINT, THERE IS NO DEAL TO BE MADE.

RANK AND FILE, AND EVEN REALLY MORE ESTABLISHING THOSE MEMBERS THAT HAVE IN THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SIDE HAVE COME TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN BILL, THAT THEY HAVE CONSTRUCTED, THAT THEY HAVE GAINED SUPPORT FOR, AND THAT THEY HAVE NOW MADE PART OF THE DISCHARGE PETITION. CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT AMUSED BY MODERATES MAKING THIS PLAY AT OUR SIGNALING WHAT THEY WANT. THE IDEA OF BEING SOMETHING CLOSE TO A SECURITY FIRST PLAN OFFERED BY JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN, BOB GOODLAD. THE FIX IS WE HAVE TO KEEP COMPROMISING AND FIND THE SWEET SPOT THAT WILL PASS INTO LAW. FOX HAS LEARNED THAT G.O.P. LEADERS PLAN TO OFFER THE FREEDOM OF CAUCUS DATE NEXT MONTH'S FOR THAT CONSERVATIVE BILL. IF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS DOESN'T TAKE IT, LEADERSHIP COULD PULL
