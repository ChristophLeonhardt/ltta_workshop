CORTEZ RSH *, IS SHE ALL SIZZLE AND NO SPEAK? HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID WHEN QUESTIONED ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN RELATIONS. WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT? I THINK WAY MEANT IS LIKE THE SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE INCREASING IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND PLACES WHERE PALESTINIANS ARE EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY IN ACCESS TO THEIR HOUSE AND HOMES. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD POND ON THAT. I AM NOT THE EXPERT ON GEOPOLITICS ON THIS ISSUE. JESSE: THAT'S FOR SURE. JOINING ME NOW, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, TOMI LAHREN. WE HAVE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE I'M SURE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, BUT WE ARE ABLE TO FIJT AND WING IT AND PRETEND TO HAVE A SEMBLANCE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SUBJECT. SHE IS ALSO RUNNING FOR OFFICE. SO THAT MAKES IT MORE DISTURBING. I USED TO LOVE IT WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WOULD COME ON TV BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE IT SO BUT THIS IS MY NEW GIRL. JESSE: I'M GOING TO DONATE TO HER CAMPAIGN. I WANT HER TO GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET. MAYBE SHE CAN BE BIDEN-CORTEZ. SHE IS A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO LOVE SOCIALISM. WHY DON'T WE TAKE BERNIE SANDERS AND ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ AND DROP THEM INTO THE SOCIALIST NATION OF THEIR CHOICE AND SEE HOW LONG THEY LAST. JESSE: I LOVE THAT IDEA. I WILL CALL THE EXECUTIVES AT FOX RIGHT NOW AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THAT ROLLING. LET'S HEAR WHAT HER OPINION WAS ON DIRECT ACTION IN THE STREETS. ROLL IT. WE HAVE TO HAVE A RAPID RESPONSE. AND I THINK EVERY DAY WE GO ON, ESPECIALLY A DAY WHEN SOMETHING THAT HEINOUS HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO OCCUPY ALL OF IT. WE NEED TO OCCUPY EVERY AIRPORT JESSE: SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE ISRAELI OCCUPATION BUT SHE WANTS TO OCCUPY EVERYTHING IN AMERICA. I DON'T THINK THIS TACTIC IS EFFECTIVE, DO YOU? IT GETS SOME PEOPLE RILED UP. BUT SHE SAID SHE'LL TAKE A LOT OF HER POLICY DIRECTION FROM ACTIVISTS. I HAVE A QUESTION, WHICH ACTIVISTS IN THE ACTIVISTS THAT RIOT, LOOT AND BURN THEIR LOCAL BUSINESSES OTHER ACTIVISTS THAT MARCH YOU ARE THE STREET WITH REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ON THEIR HEADS. WHICH ACTIVISTS IS SHE GOING TO TAKE DIRECTION FROM FOR HER POLICY. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF POLICY EXPERIENCE. THIS ISN'T HER STRONG SUIT. WHERE IS SHE GOING TO GET IT BERNIE'S HOUSE. LET'S LISTEN TO HER TAKE ON EVERYTHING IS FINE. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS TWO JOBS. UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING 60, 70, 80 HOURS PER WEEK. WHILE WE HAVE THIS NO HOLDS BARRED WILD WEST HYPER CAPITALISM MEANS PROFIT AT ANY COST. NOT ALWAYS EXIST IN THE WORLD. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WORKS. IT'S DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING. I DON'T THINK SHE GETS IT. SHE DOESN'T GET AT ALL. MOUTH. IT'S INTERESTING TO WATCH A TRAIN WRECK. SHE LOVES SOCIALISM SO MUCH SHE DOESN'T THINK CAPITALISM IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOREVER. LET'S DROP HER IN VENEZUELA. LET'S GIVE HER SIX MONTHS IN VENEZUELA. JESSE: I WOULDN'T GIVE HER SIX WEEKS. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF? REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO DO THE INTERVIEWS AND PEOPLE WERE CLUELESS? SHE REMINDS ME OF A GUEST ON. CAPITALISM. WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S THE MOST OF REGULATED ECONOMY OF ALL TIME. TRUMP KIND OF SLASHED REGULATIONS. SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND CAPITALISM IS WHAT ALLOWS US TO SHE DOES DAY IN AND DAY OUT. BUT I THINK WHAT SHE IS TRYING TO DO IS THROW OUT FLASHY WORDS LIKE SOCIALISM BECAUSE SHE THINKS ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL FLOCK TO HER BECAUSE THEY FLOCKED TO BERNIE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING SMARTER. AT LEAST I WOULD HOPE SO.
