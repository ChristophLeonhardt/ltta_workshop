President Trump by the way his voiced support for the Iranian protesters he tweeted out for major tweets about this he said many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with the regime's corruption its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism iranian government should respect their people's rights including the right to express themselves the world is watching later big protests in Iran people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism looks like they will not take it any longer the USA is watching very closely for human rights violations next tweet Iran the number one state sponsor of terror with numerous violations of human rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet not good and then finally Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them probably Obama administration the great Iranian people have been repressed for many years they're hungry for food and for freedom along with human rights the wealth of Iran is being looted time for change how ominous with that we bring on Iran expert Joshi Asma who has contributed reporting on these protests to a number of major outlets and so I brought on Josh to clear this up because nobody knows anything about Iran Josh thank you for being here thanks for having what's going on what should we know about this so these protests began late Thursday and they began rather small they began as an anti rouhani protests and so Ron is the the president rouhani is the current rebel leader president Hassan rouhani this is a guy who was touted by the Obama administration as a moderate and he didn't point out the fact that executions have skyrocketed under rouhani attacks acid attacks against women have skyrocketed this is not a good guy he's not a moderate the the whole hardline or moderate dichotomy just is pure fiction because this is all we heard from Barack Obama's there's a moderate in Iran rouhani is a moderate we should support him to liberalize Iran that's nonsense you're saying it's absolute nonsense and the reason why is every presidential candidate is vetted by the mullahs there's something called The Guardian Council and The Guardian Council of Vettes candidates and we saw back in 2009 they didn't like a candidate mo savvy and that's that's why we have the Green Revolution because the mullahs suppressed this candidate and they said that we're only going to put forth candidates that are vetted and that subscribe to the Islamist regime toe the party line to the Islamist line so how should the United States respond I think the Trump administration has been doing a good job so far it's funny that could just be the the mantra of my show the sense of the show began I think the Trump administration has been doing pretty good so far to be fair I've been a pretty avid stop Trump critic so I don't say that lightly he's been doing a good job nikki Haley spoke earlier today and she said that we're going to hold an emergency session at the United Nations we're going to support the Iranian people and they've been doing a good job at not inciting and not giving the ayatollahs an excuse to make it seem like there is Western interference blame all of this on the West it's just the West stirring up trouble yes and the ayatollahs were gonna do that anyway and they have been Khamenei he spoke out for the first time Tuesday and he blamed the the enemies of the Iranian regime so what practically I don't think we're gonna put boots on the ground but I do have greater faith in nikki Haley and Donald Trump to back up their threats with action something that Barack Obama never did what materially what tangibly can the United States do to support this movement so first and foremost we need to understand that this movement would not have happened several years ago the reason why is because now about 50 million Iranians have access to the Internet and this revolution if you could call it that is being fueled by an app called telegram telegram is huge irani ins use it it's very Farsi friendly videos are being uploaded and right now telegram is being blocked by the Iranian regime the Iranian regime is blocking internet in most major cities that are blocking social media twitter has been blocked since 2009 and what the United States needs to do they need to put pressure on companies like telegram they need to be pressure on social media outlets to keep the lines of communication open because that's the lifeline of the of the protest base that is life shut down the communication this thing I mean this is all over the country and some of the most religious cities exactly there's a city called home and them is the Shia heartland of Iran this is a place where in 1962 Ayatollah Khomeini began his Islamist revolution and you we had protesters there Friday Friday after prayer and this is when the people get riled up this is when the Imams come out and rile up the people and they went out in the clerical heartland of the city and said death that Islamic Republic death to Khamenei that's like let's go to Ayatollah exactly to revere on exactly it could be killed for that they could be killed and right now in Tehran 450 arrests the regime has already said that they face they face the death penalty there's a kill they have to kill them all they may kill them all or like they did in 2009 they could torture them really brutally Wow so speaking of Ayatollah Khomeini and it's a little confusing the old guy was Khomeini and the new guy is commie any comment comment yeah I don't care I don't do yeah you know I always noticed this my lefty friends they always try to pronounce things very exaggeratedly native so they'll say you know like like Muslim you know Pakistan or something but I don't go to Italian restaurants and say like ok I'd like to order the spaghetti and I cut a bone out a pit father would have been no you just you know so I like to very ostentatiously pronounced them in an anglicized now what their one thing they're chanting in the streets according to the reporting that we have is bring back the Shah the Shah who is ousted in the Iranian Revolution what what does that mean it's a way to defy the regime there is no topic more taboo in the Islamic Republic of Iran than the Shah this is this is why we had the 1979 revolution you had Islamist factions you had the working poor stand up and say we don't want the autocratic Shah and to be to be clear the Schad does not have immense support in Iran and he does not have him at support in the iranian exile community it's just like a screw you basic it's basically screw you and it's basically a way to invoke nostalgia for a time in a place that was better than now to make iran great again exactly the shot 2018 thank you Ron great again so the last thing I want to talk to you about the Obama fans are taking credit for this and they're saying look the deal gave them a ton of money and it exposed weaknesses in their economy which then led to another protest which were we still in power we wouldn't support it all but because we're not in power well take some credit for it is this all revisionist nonsense or is there something to it it's revisionist nonsense that's what I thought I'm glad you said there is I mean check Twitter the probably the most smug human being on the planet Ben Rhodes I knew you were gonna say been raised the smuggest he is he is awful he was smug in office yeah he was the one who joked about how he fooled the American people and they were all a bunch of rubes yeah Javad Zarif who is iran's Foreign Minister he negotiated the Iran nuclear deal with Kerry he's he was a smartest man in the room and he fooled he fooled Americans essentially and what we're seeing now is we're seeing a backlash by the Iranian people because Rohani over-promised yeah as a result of the nuclear do the nuclear deal he said that this is going to open up the world the banking system sanctions relief and he didn't deliver and Iran is still impoverished drug drug abuse is up prostitution is up and these people are suffering and the Obama administration did little to alleviate their misery rouhani has done very little to help the working poor and bear in mind that the the regime always blames these sorts of dissonant movements on the middle or upper classes right and because they draw a huge portion of their support from the working class and that's because they've made the working class dependent on the government's and welfare benefits it's all handouts for the work all handouts and they expect blind allegiance in return and this is very much a working-class revolution it looks like they started it now it seems from the reporting I read the working class started this as an economic movement and not only later did the middle classes jump on about political oppression and suppression but this began with the with the working poor in Iran that's exactly right it began as an anti rouhani protest that basically they express their grievances over the lack of economic growth but it's become an anti Ayatollah oh it has as of Friday it became a political movement so it's not it's right longer it's no longer just about the regime that happens to be running the government this is about the whole governmental system and structure of Iran they want to tear it all down Wow gotta love it it's kind of like in America we do that sometimes a little less bloody a little a little more fun you know we say tear down the establishment but clearly anti-establishment movements have spread even to Iran and maybe the United States will support it
