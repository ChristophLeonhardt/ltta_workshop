CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE BEEN DYING

35
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,460
TO TALK TO YOU.

36
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,027
THIS WAS A WILD DAY.

37
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,863
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE

38
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:29,230
OVERHYPED.

39
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,898
THEY HAD THE CAMERA ON THE CAR.

40
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,667
I WAS LIKE HIM AS HE CRAWLING TO

41
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:32,667
I WAS LIKE HIM AS HE CRAWLING TO

42
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,301
THE WHITE HOUSE?

43
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,571
IT IS ONLY SIX BLOCKS.

44
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,438
IT TOOK AN HOUR FOR HIM TO GET

45
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,139
OVER THERE.

46
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,507
IT BECOME A BIG DRAMA.

47
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,074
ENDED UP NOTHING.

48
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,010
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS ENDS UP

49
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,410
ON THURSDAY?

50
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,679
WHERE SHOULD IT END UP?

51
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,581
IS IT A TRAP TO FIRE ROSENSTEIN

52
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:48,783
NOW OR WHERE IS YOUR HEAD AT

53
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:49,084

54
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,719

>> LAURA, I DON’T KNOW THAT IT’S

56
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,186
A TRAP.

57
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,788
REALLY, WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS

58
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:53,788
REALLY, WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS

59
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:54,723
THAT ROD NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT

60
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:54,723
THAT ROD NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT

61
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,792
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

62
00:00:57,792 --> 00:01:00,195
THERE WAS NO PLAN TO FIRE HIM

63
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:00,629
THIS MORNING.

64
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,765
I KNOW THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF

65
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:05,400
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT WERE

66
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,436
OUT THERE BUT QUITE FRANKLY, IT

67
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:08,336
WAS MORE A RESIGNATION QUESTION

68
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:11,173
THEN A FIRING QUESTION TODAY.

69
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:12,507
YET OBVIOUSLY, ALL OF THAT

70
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:17,913
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T

71
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:17,946
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TH

72
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:17,980
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TN

00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:12,174
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TE

74
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:18,013
CHANGED.

75
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:18,247
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T.

76
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:18,247
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T.

77
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:18,947
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERENT

78
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,782
NARRATIVES COME OUT OF THE DOJ.

79
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,851
IF INDEED ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID

80
00:01:22,851 --> 00:01:21,583
THESE THINGS, WHICH MANY BELIEVE

81
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:25,521
THAT HE DID, MANY BELIEVE THAT

82
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:27,089
HE SAID IT IN A NONJOKING

83
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:29,024
MANNER, THEN HE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN

84
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:29,024
MANNER, THEN HE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN

85
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:30,192
THAT, NOT ONLY TO THE

86
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:31,427
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

87
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:32,194
BOTH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

88
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:35,798
WE ARE PUSHING VERY HARD TO MAKE

89
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:35,798
WE ARE PUSHING VERY HARD TO MAKE

90
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:37,933
SURE THAT HE COMES IN UNDER OATH

91
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:37,933
SURE THAT HE COMES IN UNDER OATH

92
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:40,169
TO CONGRESS AND LET THE AMERICAN

93
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:40,169
TO CONGRESS AND LET THE AMERICAN

94
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,070
PEOPLE JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES.

95
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,939
I CAN’T TELL YOU THAT IF HE DOES

96
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:43,939
I CAN’T TELL YOU THAT IF HE DOES

97
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,808
NOT, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF US

98
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,042

00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:47,042
THAT ARE STANDING BY REALLY WITH

100
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:50,413
IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS, THAT

101
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:51,881
SAID, WE CANNOT HAVE THIS KIND

102
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,416
OF ACTIVITY CONTINUE AT DOJ.

103
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:54,984
>> Laura: I DON’T GET THE

104
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:55,384
JOKE.

105
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:55,952
SAYING IT JOKINGLY?

106
00:01:55,952 --> 00:02:00,656
I THINK SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT

107
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:01,824
LEVEL OF POOR JUDGMENT, TO JOKE

108
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,059
ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT OR

109
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,994
WEARING A WIRE ON THE PRESIDENT,

110
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:04,994
WEARING A WIRE ON THE PRESIDENT,

111
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,196
NUMBER ONE, IT’S NOT FUNNY, TWO,

112
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:07,196
NUMBER ONE, IT’S NOT FUNNY, TWO,

113
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,464
NOT SOMETHING YOU TALK ABOUT.

114
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:12,502
EITHER HE HAS A REALLY BIZARRE

115
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:10,133
SENSE OF HUMOR OR HE SAID IT WAS

116
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,835
SERIOUS.

117
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,704
I DON’T BUY THAT IT WAS A HUGE

118
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:17,140
SET UP FOR TRUMP.

119
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,708
>>  TOTAL NIGHTMARE FOR DEPUTY

120
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,411
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

121
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,613
HE MELTED AND WET HIS PANTS UP

122
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:24,314
THE FIRST SECOND THE SENATE

123
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,216
ASKED HIM TO ANSWER SOME

124
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:27,384
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RUSSIA

125
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,218
INVESTIGATION.

126
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:29,085
THE WHOLE THING WAS -- I’M

127
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:29,619
SORRY.

128
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:30,687
I THINK IS ONE OF THE WORST

129
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:33,189
APPOINTMENTS EVER.

130
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,391
JAY SEKULOW, I WANT TO GET YOUR

131
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,226
RESPONSE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

132
00:02:36,226 --> 00:02:37,827
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID.

133
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,362
>> IF, IN FACT, ROD ROSENSTEIN

134
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,598
DOES END UP RESIGNING COME I

135
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:40,630
THINK IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

136
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,167
THERE WOULD BE A STEP BACK TAKEN

137
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:44,167
THERE WOULD BE A STEP BACK TAKEN

138
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:44,468
HERE.

139
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:44,968
A REVIEW.

140
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,403
I THINK IT’S A REVIEW THAT HAS

141
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:49,373
TO BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE, AND

142
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:49,373
TO BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE, AND

143
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:51,241
A REVIEW THAT HAS TO INCLUDE AN

144
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,042
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT HAS

145
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:52,809
TRANSPIRED WITH ALL OF THESE

146
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,444
STATEMENTS AND ALL OF THESE

147
00:02:54,444 --> 00:02:55,879
ALLEGATIONS, GOING BACK TO THE

148
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,114
PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE AND

149
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:01,018
BRUCE OHR AND BASICALLY A

150
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:02,019
TIMEOUT ON ON US AND COREY.

151
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,387
>> Laura: WROTE ABOUT THAT?

152
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:06,023
A TIMEOUT ON THE MUELLER PROBE?

153
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:06,557
IS THAT REALISTIC?

154
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:07,691
>> I DON’T KNOW THAT IT’S

155
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,593
REALISTIC BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

156
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,228
THERE SHOULD BE A TIMEOUT AND

157
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:11,695
ACCOUNTABILITY.

158
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,664
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE PRIME

159
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:14,565
EXAMPLE, LAURA.

160
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,967
WE’VE GOT A DOUBLE STANDARD.

161
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,169
HE GOT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT

162
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,204
WORK IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

163
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:21,372
THAT ARE REALLY BEING PROSECUTED

164
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:21,372
THAT ARE REALLY BEING PROSECUTED

165
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:23,808
FOR LYING TO THE FBI.

166
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,610
AND YET WE KNOW THAT FALSE

167
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,046
TESTIMONY WAS GIVEN TO BRUCE OHR

168
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:29,046
TESTIMONY WAS GIVEN TO BRUCE OHR

169
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,215
BY EITHER FUSION GPS OR

170
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:31,816
CHRISTOPHER STEELE.

171
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:33,284
WE KNOW THAT INDEED THEY

172
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:34,819
MENTIONED A PERSON BY THE NAME

173
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,388
OF CLAYTON MITCHELL AND HIS

174
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,123
WHOLE NARRATIVE, THE NRA,

175
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:41,125
ACTUALLY BEING INVOLVED IN A

176
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,994
RUSSIA COLLUSION, THEY ACTUALLY

177
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:45,763
SHARED THAT WITH A DOJ OFFICIAL,

178
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:45,763
SHARED THAT WITH A DOJ OFFICIAL,

179
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,031
AND YET THERE ARE NO PROSECUTION

180
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:47,031
AND YET THERE ARE NO PROSECUTION

181
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:47,765
THAT’S BEING DONE THERE.

182
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:51,002
IT WAS FALSE TESTIMONY, GIVEN TO

183
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:51,002
IT WAS FALSE TESTIMONY, GIVEN TO

184
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:51,602
A DOJ PERSON.

185
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,304
WE’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS

186
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:54,439
ONE STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY, AND

187
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,773
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ROD

188
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,809
ROSENSTEIN IS NOT IMPLEMENTING

189
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,078
THAT, AND IT’S TIME THAT WE HOLD

190
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:00,078
THAT, AND IT’S TIME THAT WE HOLD

191
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:00,612
HIM ACCOUNTABLE.

192
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:02,213
>> Laura: CONGRESSMAN, REAL

193
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:03,414
QUICK, WHY IS IT THAT THE

194
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,784
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO GO BACK ON

195
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,086
HIS DECISION TO DECLASSIFY THOSE

196
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:08,086
HIS DECISION TO DECLASSIFY THOSE

197
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,622
DOCUMENTS AND KICK IT OVER TO

198
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:11,022
THE IG?

199
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:11,723
I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT.

200
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,924
I UNDERSTAND ROSENSTEIN WAS THE

201
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,592
ONE WHO BROUGHT THE MESSAGE TO

202
00:04:14,592 --> 00:04:14,859
HIM.

203
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,195
THE PRESIDENT A SEATED TO HIS

204
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:17,529
WISHES.

205
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:17,796
WHY?

206
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:18,863
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

207
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:20,632
TRYING TO BE CAUTIOUS TO MAKE

208
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:21,733
SURE THAT SOURCES AND METHODS

209
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,400
ARE NOT OUT THERE.

210
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,503
I CAN TELL YOU, I TALKED TO THE

211
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:28,406
IG TODAY, THE BRUCE OHR 302s,

212
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,808
THERE IS NO REASON --

213
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,977
>> Laura: DOES HAVE TO BE

214
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:32,844
RELEASED.

215
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:34,813
>> TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE,

216
00:04:34,813 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON’T HAVE SECURITY
