1
00:00:10,337 --> 00:00:11,438
THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH

2
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:14,174
THE CARAVAN COMING UP.

3
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:18,045
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?

4
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,646
STEVE: WE ARE CERTAINLY

5
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,448
WATCHING.

6
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:25,886
BREAKING TONIGHT, CUSTOMS TURNED

7
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,988
AWAY A CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS

8
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:28,522
TONIGHT.

9
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:31,458
HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,294
GATHERING THERE LOOKING ASYLUM.

11
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:37,698
THEY WILL LIKELY TRY AGAIN

12
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:38,065
TOMORROW.

13
00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:39,733
THEY CALLED THE GROUP A THREAT

14
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:43,670
AND URGING FAMILIES TO GO

15
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,173
THROUGH PROPER LEGAL CHANNELS.

16
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:51,211
JOINING ME NOW IS ANN COULTER.

17
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,746
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:55,515
NICE TO SEE YOU.

19
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:59,252
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, STEVE.

20
00:00:59,252 --> 00:01:00,520
STEVE: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,255
GOING ON DOWN AT THE BORDER

22
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,156
RIGHT NOW.

23
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,959
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE CARAVAN?

24
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,427
>> WELL, I WISH TRUMP WILL STAY

25
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:10,297
ON THE ROAD LIKE HE WAS IN

26
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:11,832
CAMPAIGN MODE AGAIN.

27
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:13,767
HE GETS INSTANT FEEDBACK FROM

28
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:16,169
THE CROWD AND THAT'S WHEN HE

29
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:18,372
SAYS REALLY POPULAR THINGS THAT

30
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:20,107
GETS REPUBLICANS ELECTED AND

31
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:22,843
COULD DEFEND AGAINST A BLUE

32
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:23,143
WAVE.

33
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,679
THEN HE GETS BACK TO WASHINGTON

34
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,080
AND HE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,315
ABOUT THE CARAVAN.

36
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:32,352
HE SENT OUT A TWEET SAYING DON'T

37
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,554
WORRY, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

38
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,057
HAS STOPPED THE CARAVAN.

39
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,227
THE DAILY MAIL GOES AND SAY WE

40
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:45,365
ARE GIVING THEM 30 TO 20 DAY

41
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:45,699
PASSES.

42
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,167
THEY ARE SPREADING OUT SO THEY

43
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,903
CAN GO TO DIFFERENT ACCESS

44
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:50,237
POINTS.

45
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:52,439
THEY ARE 100% STILL COMING.

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,741
THEY JUST HAVE TO STEP ACROSS

47
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:55,575
THE BORDER.

48
00:01:55,575 --> 00:02:03,850
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LAWYERS FROM

49
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,287
COUNTRIES WITHOUT BORDERS.

50
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,089
THEY ARE ADVISED AND TOLD WHAT

51
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:09,923
TO SAY.

52
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,559
THEY STEP ACROSS AND SAY ASYLUM

53
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,927
AND THAT'S IT.

54
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:19,132
THEY WILL GET SHIPPED IN AND GET

55
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,535
ANOTHER ROUND OF MS-13.

56
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:23,336
TRUMP HAS A LOT OF POWER.

57
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:25,572
HE WAS THE ONE ELECTED.

58
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:26,807
IT'S REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS

59
00:02:26,807 --> 00:02:28,308
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE.

60
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,944
IF HE WANTS CONGRESS TO PASS

61
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,647
THIS LAW IT WOULDN'T BE VERY

62
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:33,947
HARD.

63
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:38,085
JUST SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON

64
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,220
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND

65
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,223
NOT MAKING SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH

66
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:46,059
KOREA GREAT AGAIN THEN HE COULD

67
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:48,261
DO SOMETHING FOR THE AMERICAN

68
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:48,595
PEOPLE.

69
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:50,997
YOU DON'T GET TO STEP-IN AND

70
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:54,034
CLAIM I'M CLAIMING ASYLUM AND

71
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:58,705
GET A BUS AND BOX LUNCH TO

72
00:02:58,705 --> 00:02:59,039
AMERICA.

73
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,073
STEVE: THERE IS ALSO THE POINT

74
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:01,174
ABOUT THE WALL.

75
00:03:01,174 --> 00:03:04,010
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING MORE

76
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,344
DIRECT.

77
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:07,481
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

78
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,949
HAPPENING.

79
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,584
>> NO, I MEAN THERE IS A REASON

80
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:11,518
THAT'S THE CHANCE.

81
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:14,121
IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT HIS

82
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:16,823
FAMOUS MEXICAN RAPIST SPEECH

83
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,192
ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY HE

84
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,728
THROUGHOUT TAX CUTS, OBAMACARE,

85
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,664
THE MILITARY, BLAH-BLAH-BLAH.

86
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:27,234
IT WAS FROM GOING OUT AND GIVING

87
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,202
THESE SPEECHES AND HAVING A TEN

88
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:30,570
THOUSAND PERSON FOCUS GROUP

89
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,706
EVERYDAY OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE

90
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,808
SAW WHICH LINES WERE THE POPULAR

91
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:35,108
ONES.

92
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:37,010
THERE IS A REASON THE AMERICAN

93
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,747
PEOPLE UNLIKE THE DONE

94
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:41,882
PEOPLE UNLIKE THE DONORS WANTED

95
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:42,983
A WALL.

96
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:45,318
YOU DON'T CHECK WITH THE PEOPLES

97
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,355
WHO JOBS WILL BE OBSOLETE.

98
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:52,192
WE DON'T JUST NEED MORE DRONES

99
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,193
AND BORDER POLICE.

100
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:58,165
WE WANT IT TO STOP THE HEROIN

101
00:03:58,165 --> 00:03:59,266
AND CARAVAN.

102
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:01,401
HIS NUMBER ONE DUTY IS TO

103
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,669
PROTECT THE BORDER.

104
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,472
IT'S NOT TO RESOLVE NORTH AND

105
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:08,241
SOUTH KOREA'S DISPUTES.

106
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,509
THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

107
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:12,279
NORTH KOREA IS CHINA'S PROBLEM.

108
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:16,817
SYRIA IS THE TRANSITS PROBLEM.

109
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:19,452
ARE EUROPEAN NEWS PAPERS

110
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:20,853
CONSUMED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING

111
00:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,789
WITH THE CARAVAN.

112
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,192
ARE CHINESE NEWS PAPER WORRIED

113
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:29,062
ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING

114
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,463
INTO AMERICA?

115
00:04:30,463 --> 00:04:35,335
NO, WHY ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT OUR

116
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:35,902
PROBLEMS.

117
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,138
>> YOU ARE THE TRUE PURIST.

118
00:04:38,138 --> 00:04:39,239
I LOVE IT.

119
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,341
YOU MENTIONED JOBS EARLIER.

120
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,777
YOU NOTICED SOMETHING IN THE

121
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:45,612
RALLY LAST NIGHT THAT HASN'T GOT

122
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:47,314
PICKED UP THAT MUCH.

123
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,249
LET'S PLAYER AND I'LL GET YOU

124
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,851
REACTION ON THE OTHER SIZE.

125
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:54,087
>> FOR THE FARMER, OKAY, IT'S

126
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,022
GOING TO GET GOOD.

127
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,158
WE'LL LET YOUR GUESSWORKERS COME

128
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,760
IN BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE STRONG

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,094
BORDERS.

130
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:03,396
WE HAVE TO HAVE YOUR WORKERS

131
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:05,332
COME IN.

132
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:07,334
THE UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE IS SO

133
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,835
STRONG WE HAVE TO LET PEOPLE

134
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:09,302
COME IN.

135
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:11,404
THEY WILL BE GUESSWORKERS.

136
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:14,608
THEY WILL COME IN AND HAVE THE H

137
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,876
2 B'S COME IN.

138
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,344
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.

139
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:20,480
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.

140
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,750
STEVE: WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

141
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,219
>> WELL, PLEASE NOTICE IT'S DEAD

142
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:29,155
SILENCE THROUGH THE ENTIRE

143
00:05:29,155 --> 00:05:30,857
BLATHER UNTIL HE GETS TO THEN

144
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,325
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.

145
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:36,363
[ LAUGHTER ]

146
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,865
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

147
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:39,733
YOU TELL ME.

148
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,669
THE WAY I REMEMBER WE DIDN'T

149
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:43,670
ELECT JEB BUSH.

150
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,706
I WAS COMPLETELY SURE WE ELECTED

151
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:47,807
DONALD TRUMP.

152
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,443
WHERE HE GETS THIS NONSIS.

153
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,146
THE H 2B HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE

154
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:56,182
THE WORSE YOU CAN COME UP WITH.

155
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,718
THEY AREN'T FARM WORKERS.

156
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,420
THEY CAN BUILD ROBOTS.

157
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,089
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU USED AN ATM.

158
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,891
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO MOVE

159
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,928
INTO THE 20th CENTURY.

160
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:12,132
IT'S FOR WORKING AT PLACES LIKE

161
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:17,904
THE RESORTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND

162
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:18,338
CONSTRUCTION.

163
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,741
THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS I'LL ADD

164
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,378
NOW THAT HE AND KANYE ARE

165
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:25,712
BONDING.

166
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:28,014
HE GAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL SPEECH IN

167
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,216
MILWAUKEE SAYING TO

168
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:31,351
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHAT HAVE THE

169
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:32,786
DEMOCRATS GIVEN YOU?

170
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:34,020
GIVE US A CHANCE.

171
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,090
THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD GETS

172
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,725
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND ALL

173
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:39,826
WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS A

174
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:40,160
CHANCE.

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,162
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR A TAX CUT.

176
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,663
THEY ASKED FOR JOBS.

177
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,099
THESE ARE JOBS AND HE'S TELLING

178
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:53,673
THEM IN A RALLY TO BRING IN H2B

179
00:06:53,673 --> 00:06:54,007
WORKERS.

180
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,976
THAT WAS THE WHOLE DISNEY THING.

181
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,011
I HEAR THESE SPEECHES AND ALL I

182
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:01,514
CAN SEE IS A HUGE BLUE WAVE.

183
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:03,283
A BLUE TSUNAMI.

184
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:05,785
THERE IS STILL TIME.

185
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:10,023
TRUMP CAN BRING BACK ONE PEACE P

186
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:11,725
TRUMP CAN BRING BACK ONE PEACE E

187
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,194
OF GOOD NEWS.

188
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:15,862
YESTERDAY WE SPOKE ABOUT AN

189
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:17,564
ARTICLE THAT TRUMP IS
