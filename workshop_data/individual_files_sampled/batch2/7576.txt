but Tucker for a guy who's as vigilant about protecting speech I am curious and again this is genuine why you don't support the free speech rights of Colin Kaepernick I've never challenged his speech rights I mean ever I've never challenged anybody's speech rights I mean you there's not a wacko I wouldn't defend on speech grounds and I have defended a lot of crazy people and speech grounds including Colin Kaepernick I think is a buffoon whatever and the Kaepernick thing is just like so profit is so cynical if you want have a conversation about police brutality I used to be a police reporter I think it's a super interesting topic I think anyone with power including cops can misuse it that's the worst case scenario I'm totally opposed to it okay let's be honest this is like it's a sideshow okay that makes a certain kind of person feel virtuous for supporting said about speech again I would never I would never challenge his speech rights in a million freaking years let's eat echo and I'm giving the perspective of other folks here which is that for you it seems like a sideshow but for African Americans who are being jailed and killed disproportionally it is not it's not a it's not a curiosity I'm just saying like this rich guy pretending to speak for African Americans like spare me you know what I mean no I get what you're saying but but who is going to speak for them is is the media going to is the media going to pay attention to a guy who a middle-class guy to a poor line date they pay no attention whatsoever and so people objected the way that Colin Kapernick did it well oh my god he did in the middle of the national anthem why did he do in the middle the national anthem to get your attention and the reality is that's the only thing that works when a rich guy who's a famous athlete does something in the middle of something that you're paying attention to and so now have that conversation about police brutality against African Americans perfectly done by Colin jeopardy
