PRESIDENT XI JINPING RECENTLY ELIMINATING TERM LIMITS FOR HIS OFFICE. DON'T THINK SHE LIKED THAT MUCH, ALLOWING HIM TO BE PRESIDENT FOR LIFE. JILLIAN: WOMEN TAKING UP THE FIGHT IN THE MIDTERMS WAS A RECORD NUMBER OF WOMEN FILED TO RUN IN SENATE RACES WITH 42 WOMEN THROWING THEIR NAMES INTO THE HAT. HOW WILL WOMEN SHAVE THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS AND WHAT CHALLENGES DO THEY FACE? HERE TO DEBATE THIS IS DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST SARAH AND AMERICA RISING PAC ALEXANDER SMITH. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S START WITH YOU. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS IMPACTING THE MIDTERMS? YOU HAVE WHAT YOU ARE RUNNING INTO REGARDLESS WHO THE CANDIDATE IS AND FEMALE OR MALE HAS TO RUN, BY DOUBLE DIGITS IN SOME CASES. THERE IS ENTHUSIASM AMONG WOMEN, IT IS A TOUGH ONE FOR DEMOCRATS. WHAT CHALLENGES DO THEY FACE? THEY ARE TRYING TO JUGGLE THEIR CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME OR THE WORKPLACE AND THE RIGORS OF THE CAMPAIGN. AT THE SEC, IT ALLOWED ONE CANDIDATE TO PUT CHILDCARE ON THE CAMPAIGN'S FINANCES IN A COMFORTABLE EXPENSE. JILLIAN: WOMEN WHO FILED TO RUN FOR OFFICE, 47 FOR GOVERNOR, THE FINAL AND CURRENTLY HOLDING OFFICE, 23 IN THE SENATE, 84 IN THE HOUSE, 6 FOR GOVERNOR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS WHAT STRIKES YOU? WOMEN MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE, LOOKING AT THOSE NUMBERS, THEY PROPORTIONATELY REPRESENT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING THE STORY FOR A LONG TIME, AND COMING UP IN 2010, 2014, WHERE A LOT OF YOUNG LEADERS WERE BORN AND CULTIVATED IN STATE RACES, CURRENTLY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE YOUNGEST ELECTED CONGRESSWOMAN, FROM NEW YORK'S 21ST DISTRICT.

WE SAW THIS ENERGY WITH THE WOMEN'S MARCH, 4 MILLION WOMEN MARCHED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND NOW THEY ARE TURNING THAT ACTIVISM TO ELECTORAL ENERGY. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A WOMAN AND HAVING THE WIND AT YOUR BACK AND BEING A WOMAN CANDIDATE BUT WHAT WE ARE RUNNING ON AND WE HAVE TO SPEAK CANDIDATE BUT WHAT WE ARE RUNNING ON AND WE HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES IMPACTING FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. JILLIAN: I WANT YOUR OPINIONS ON THIS. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOMEN IN POLITICS THE FACE OF OUR BIGGEST POLITICS THE FACE OF OUR BIGGES DEFEAT WHICH A LOT OF WOMEN FELL DEEPLY IN 2016, WE CAN'T GET DISCOURAGED IS WHEN WOMEN RUN ON MEDICARE FOR ALL, MAKING COLLEGE DEBT-FREE, EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY, THAT SPEAKS TO THE INTERESTS OF OUR FAMILY. THE BIGGEST THING WOMEN CAN LEARN FROM HILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING ON YOUR GENDER, WHICH SHE DID IN 2016 AS OPPOSED TO HER 2008 CAMPAIGN, DOES NOT WORK. SOME OF THESE SENATORS LIKE CLAIRE MCCASKILL IN MISSOURI, WHERE YOU HAD 61% OF WHITE WOMEN WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP SIMPLY BEING A WOMAN IS NOT ENOUGH AND SHE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR POSITIONS LIKE
