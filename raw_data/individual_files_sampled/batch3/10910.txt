three officers had arrived up the 22 year-olds apartment after a call from his neighbor which reportedly mentioned Tramel was threatening to hurt himself he was in the shower when police arrived and was tasered multiple times when he failed to respond to their commands in one instance for 34 seconds ultramel died less than an hour later according to the medical examiner's report the manner of his death is undetermined however it was also stated that the Taser used was a contributing factor despite that a county attorney found no evidence against the officers over his death and Adams case is far from the first to have thrown the heavy-handed use of Tasers into the spotlight we spoke to the founder of communities united against police brutality who believes taser regulation is a big problem in the u.s. the police violated a number of policies first of all they broke into his home without a probable cause to do so and secondly they tased him multiple times 18 times in fact while he was in the bathtub when a person is talese if their skin is wet much more electricity conducts through their body the sad reality is that tasers are very very poorly regulated in the United States we started out with them having some rules around using tasers now they literally stick a Taser on people if they don't like their answer to something and it's outrageous because these devices are dangerous in this case and in many other cases they've proven to be deadly more than 50% of the people who are killed by police in this country are in the throes of a mental health crisis so we can see there's really a problem and we really really need to stop using police as the way that we address mental illness in this country
