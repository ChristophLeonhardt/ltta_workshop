1
00:00:11,224 --> 00:00:11,891
>> President Trump: I HAVE

2
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:12,625
ALWAYS SAID THE MOST IMPORTANT

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,259
THING IS HAVING A GREAT

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:13,593
FAMILY.

5
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:14,994
THE FAMILY IS MOST IMPORTANT.

6
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,996
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE,

7
00:00:16,996 --> 00:00:18,331
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE

8
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,999
HAPPIEST THE WAY THEY HAVE A

9
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,633
GREAT FAMILY.

10
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:21,267
>> Martha: PRESIDENT TRUMP

11
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,503
TALKS ABOUT THE LOVE FOR HIS

12
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:24,037
FAMILY.

13
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,538
A NEW BOOK CLAIMS TO HAVE

14
00:00:25,538 --> 00:00:26,673
INSIDE SCOOP ABOUT WHAT IT'S

15
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:27,707
LIKE TO BE A TRUMP.

16
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:29,008
HERE NOW IS EMILY JANE FOX

17
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:30,677
AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK "BORN

18
00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:32,612
TRUMP: INSIDE AMERICA'S FIRST

19
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:32,945
FAMILY."

20
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:36,315
AS YOU POINT OUT IT'S A BOLD

21
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,917
COVER LIKE EVERYTHING TRUMP.

22
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:38,384
>> EXACTLY.

23
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:39,452
>> Martha: IT'S INTERESTING.

24
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:41,421
SO YOU ARE TAKING A LOOK AT --

25
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,722
I'M SURE THEY WOULD LOVE THE

26
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:43,423
TITLE.

27
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:44,590
"INSIDE AMERICA'S FIRST

28
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,525
FAMILY."

29
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:46,659
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY

30
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,094
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT HOW THEY

31
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:49,095
GOT HERE.

32
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:49,662
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

33
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,164
A STORY IN WHICH I DON'T THINK

34
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:52,665
ANY OF THEM TRULY THEMSELVES

35
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,133
BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE HERE.

36
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,035
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A DISSTINCT

37
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,971
AND A UNIQUE FIRST -- DISTINCT

38
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,506
AND UNIQUE FIRST FAMILY.

39
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:02,075
THE ONLY OF ITS KIND.

40
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,009
WAY TONIGHT TRY TO GET UNDER

41
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:04,110
THE HOOD AND UNDERSTAND WHO

42
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,044
THE PEOPLE WERE.

43
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:06,079
WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

44
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,480
SO IT'S SORT OF UNDERSTAND

45
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,214
WHERE THEY WILL GO.

46
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:09,716
>> Martha: HOW DID YOU DO

47
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:10,149
THAT?

48
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,851
>> I INTERVIEWED 150 PEOPLE

49
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,452
FOR THE BOOK.

50
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:16,422
I HAVE BEEN COVERING THEM FOR

51
00:01:16,422 --> 00:01:18,057
"VANITY FAIR" FOR THREE YEARS

52
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,425
SO FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

53
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:20,560
CLOSEST TO THEM, FRIENDS,

54
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,861
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES TO SOMEONE

55
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,930
WHO HAD A TENNIS MATCH AT

56
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,264
IVANKA AT BOARDING SCHOOL WHEN

57
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:27,934
SHE WAS A TEENAGER.

58
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,669
>> DID YOU TALK TO THEM,

59
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:30,069
THEMSELVES?

60
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:31,437
HAVE YOU MET ANY OF THE KIDS?

61
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:31,804
>> I HAVE.

62
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,539
I HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THEM

63
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:34,440
FOR A LONG TIME.

64
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,875
YOU INTERACT WITH THEM IN THE

65
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,642
NORMAL REPORTING.

66
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,911
SO THIS IS NOT AUTHORIZED

67
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:39,278
BIOGRAPHY.

68
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,980
BUT I FEEL IT'S THE CLOSEST TO

69
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,782
THE TRUTH AS I COULD POSSIBLY

70
00:01:42,782 --> 00:01:43,883
GET INTERVIEWING --

71
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:44,817
>> Martha: WHAT WERE THE

72
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,185
IMPRESSIONS OF THEM, DON

73
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,087
JUNIOR AND ERIC AND IVANKA

74
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,622
WHEN YOU MET THEM PERSONALLY?

75
00:01:49,622 --> 00:01:51,190
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK, AND I

76
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,458
THINK THE BOOK SHOWS THIS AS

77
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,661
WELL, THEY ARE A LOT MORE

78
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,563
HUMAN AND A LOT MORE NORMAL

79
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:59,165
AND LESS SCRIPTED WHEN YOU GET

80
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:00,066
CLOSER TO THEM.

81
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,168
I THINK THEY HAVE SPENT THEIR

82
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,936
WHOLE LIVES IN FRONT OF THE

83
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,271
CAMERA AND ARE ON GUARD AND

84
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,773
HAVE A CERTAIN IMAGE THEY WANT

85
00:02:06,773 --> 00:02:07,340
TO PROJECT.

86
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,741
WHEN YOU ARE CLOSER TO THEM

87
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,643
AND AS THE CLOSE FRIENDS WILL

88
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:11,911
DESCRIBE AS WELL THEY ARE MUCH

89
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,913
MORE DOWN TO EARTH, FUNNIER,

90
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:14,480
MORE THEMSELVES.

91
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,481
>> Martha: THEY ARE JUST,

92
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,883
THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS.

93
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:17,283
>> SURE!

94
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:20,153
>> Martha: I THINK SOMETIMES

95
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,687
IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT

96
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,088
PERCEPTION.

97
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:22,722
ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE.

98
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,624
I HAVE MET ALL OF THEM AND HAD

99
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:25,725
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK

100
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,493
PERSONALLY WITH THEM.

101
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:29,061
YOU KNOW SO WAS THAT A CONCERN

102
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,863
OF YOURS AS YOU WROTE THIS?

103
00:02:30,863 --> 00:02:32,331
THAT THEY, YOU KNOW, YOU

104
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,300
DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BECOME

105
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:34,767
CARICATURES?

106
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,836
>> WHAT I WANTED THEM NOT TO

107
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:38,971
BE WERE CARICATURES.

108
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,239
THAT WAS MY WHOLE POINT OF

109
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:40,773
WRITING THIS.

110
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:42,175
WE HAVE SEEN FOR YEARS BECAUSE

111
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,643
THEY HAVE BEEN FAMOUS FOR SO

112
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,444
LONG THE PERSONAS THAT WEREN'T

113
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:46,445
NECESSARILY AS CLOSE TO THE

114
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:47,680
TRUTH AS WE COULD GET.

115
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,616
BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MUCH POWER

116
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:52,051
AND ARE WORLD FAMOUS NOW I

117
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,386
WANTED TO GET CLOSER TO THE

118
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:53,886
TRUTH OF THEM.

119
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,421
THAT IS WHAT I SET OUT TO DO

120
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:56,989
REPORTING THIS.

121
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,392
>> Martha: WHAT IS THE MOST

122
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,326
MISUNDERSTOOD ABOUT IVANKA FOR

123
00:03:00,326 --> 00:03:00,760
EXAMPLE?

124
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,328
>> I THINK SHE IS MUCH FUNNIER

125
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:03,029
IN PERSON.

126
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,198
I THINK SHE AS ALL OF HER

127
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:07,333
FRIENDS DESCRIBE, SHE IS NOT

128
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,037
NECESSARILY AS SCRIPTED OR AS

129
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,939
STAYED AS SHE CAN SEEM.

130
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,140
>> Martha: WHEN I WATCH, I

131
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,641
WATCH SOME OF THE OTHER

132
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,776
INTERVIEWS YOU DID ON THIS,

133
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,578
IT'S LIKE SHE IS HARSH, LIKE

134
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:20,980
SHE IS EVIL AND NOT PRESENTING

135
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,217
HER FATHER -- SHE IS

136
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:24,917
MISREPRESENTING CHILDREN AND

137
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:25,218
WOMEN.

138
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,519
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

139
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,753
>> I THINK IN HER WHITE

140
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:29,121
HOUSE -- THE BOOK STOPS AT

141
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:29,555
INAUGURATION.

142
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,723
I TALK ABOUT HER IN THE WHITE

143
00:03:30,723 --> 00:03:31,824
HOUSE, THAT IS NOT WITHIN THE

144
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:32,191
BOOK.

145
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,993
BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE

146
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:35,261
TIMES WHERE I FEEL LIKE SHE

147
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,896
HAS BEEN QUIETER IN HER ROLE

148
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:40,867
AS AN ADVOCATE THAN PERHAPS A

149
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,735
NORMAL ADVOCATE RIGHT BE.

150
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:45,271
SHE IS IN THE ROLE AS A FIRST

151
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,539
DAUGHTER AND IT'S A TRICKY

152
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:46,873
ROLE.

153
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:48,374
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER

154
00:03:48,374 --> 00:03:51,744
FATHER IS COMPLICATED.

155
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:52,578
>> Martha: ANYONE IN THAT

156
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,046
ROLE WANTS THAT TO BE --

157
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,883
>> THAT IS WHY IT'S UNUSUAL TO

158
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,819
HAVE DAUGHTER IN THE WHITE

159
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,419
HOUSE.

160
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,721
>> Martha: MELANIA TRUMP'S

161
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,121
JACKET.

162
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:03,522
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

163
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:07,460
>> SHE IS INCREDIBLY CAREFUL

164
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,761
ABOUT HER CHOICES.

165
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,729
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

166
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:10,062
FASHION.

167
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:11,564
SHE THINKS ABOUT EVERY MESSAGE

168
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:12,598
SHE IS GOING TO SEND.

169
00:04:12,598 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE
