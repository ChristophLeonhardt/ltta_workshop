so as I mentioned at the top of the show we're doing something a little special tonight we have gathered together three people three gigantic brains who can help us understand this moment that we're in right now in the news and politics because these guys have served in top government jobs some of the key players in this what what is now the ongoing Russia scandal and its attendance and its attendant many scandals I wanted to bring them all here tonight because it's kind of remarkable that we've all got them right here in one place at the same time and because I feel like there's almost nobody better for me to talk to in terms of trying to make my way through some of the unreality we're seeing right now from the administration and in the news first Michael McFaul he's the former ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration is the author of the new book from cold war to hot peace an American ambassador in putin's russia i should tell you that mr. McFaul is here tonight fresh from a meeting at the White House this White House after President Trump publicly considered handing him over to Vladimir Putin Putin for questioning we will get to that in a moment we're also joined tonight by Chuck Rosenberg who worked at the FBI with Robert Muller he was chief of staff at the FBI to James Comey he also served as US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia that's a job he was appointed to by President Bush we are also joined tonight by Matthew Axelrod former senior federal prosecutor he was number two at the Justice Department to Deputy Attorney General and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates gentlemen thank you all very very much for being here tonight this is an unusual format for me we never do this it's unusual for me I'm rarely in New York so yes you can all be here and before I start talking about the things I meant to start talking to you about we have a little bit of breaking news that I need to get your immediate response to just because it has just become known this is the tape that became known to the public just a few days ago it is a recording reportedly made by Michael Cohen who's the president's longtime personal attorney although the president had previously denied that he had any knowledge of any payment having been made to a man named Karen McDougal a sort of hush money payment to keep her talking about her alleged affair with President Trump this is a tape recording that was apparently seized by the FBI of mr. Cohen apparently unknowing unbeknownst to mr. Trump tape recording an in-person conversation they had about that payment we've had reporting about this for a few days it has now just been released I am going to hear it right here with you guys for the first time I am told that there's one swear word in this that we are not able to bleep and so if you are particularly sensitive to that you may want to go in the middle of it but here's the tape we just got this in I'm going to get your reaction after we hear good maybe because of this would be better if you didn't go you know maybe because of this that one you know what get rid of this because it's so false with this I'm such a I think I think this goes away quickly I think what I think it's probably better do the Charleston thing just this time yeah in two weeks it's fine I think right now it's it's better you know okay you take care of yourself thanks man yeah I'm proud to use it's a long time what's up great Pol Pot away CNN Crapo making progress big time hey you guys are good pestis got your boobs no mr. Scott what's what's out can we use him anymore oh yeah 100 no you're throwing off burns he we've talked him I don't mean block words can we use it you just have a chance here for you we got served from the New York Times I told you this will require us to unseal the divorce papers with Ivana we're finding it caplets is going never never ever be well they don't have a pledge they don't have a legitimate purposes of a woman that doesn't wanna lose you correct some in any way yes and it's all being over for about two or three weeks now you have to do is delay influence even after that's not going to ever be opened there's no there's no purpose for talked about Charleston I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so that I'm gonna do that right away I've actually come up on TV and I just broke into Allen weiselberger about how to set the whole thing up with funding yes and it's all the stuff all the stuff because here you never know where that company never know what he's gonna get it correct so I'm I'm all over that and I spoke to Alan about it when it comes time for the financing which will be you listen what phase what have you so that's the recording as you can tell it's a recording that's made in person it appears to capture mr. Trump what person who appears to be mr. Trump on one side of what appears to be a phone call maybe talking to somebody at least you can't hear at the beginning and then there's a back and forth between a person who appears to be mr. Trump and a person who appears to be mr. Cohen now nobody is disputing the authenticity of this recording there's a question as to whether or not this has political salience also question as to whether or not this has legal salience Chuck let me just ask you listening to that for the first time given your role at the FBI and you're working in in law enforcement over the years what does this say to you so it at least has a number of leads right there are a whole bunch of people who are mentioned some by first names some by last name and I'm sure the FBI and the prosecutors are going to want to who they are and what role they play in that in and of itself right on the face of the recording it doesn't seem incriminate or II but often things do not there's also a strange reference at least I think I heard one Rachel to our friend David and we know that the pseudonym that mr. Trump used in those documents that were executed to make payments I think both the stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal although I may be wrong about one of them was David Dickenson right that there that the Dennison David Dennis yeah right so the fake name he used was David and I think it's mr. Cohen referring to our friend David when he starts to talk about you know executing this that may also be David pecker who is the head of ami which is the institution that was supposedly paying the such money on the president's behalf and that's the other friend David right so it raises more questions than it answers but I think the overriding impression is sure is interesting that mr. Cohen has tapes Minh mr. Trump may have tapes and they probably didn't make just one and this is it's not necessarily illegal for mr. Cohen to have made this tape well in New York State New York State is what is known as a one-party consent state meaning that if you and I were talking in New York as we are now and I recorded the conversation without your knowledge that's not a crime some states require the consent of both parties New York state requires a consent of only one party Matt as you listen to this as Chuck says there's no evidence of you know some sort of crime being committed on this tape what are the potential liabilities that the president has to worry about either in this specific instance or with mr. Cohen more broadly having had some sort of perhaps pattern of recording his interactions with his client yeah I mean based on this tape so far and it seems like the potential liabilities are more political than legal the tape seems to suggest that mr. Trump was aware of payments being discussed in advance of the election when I believe he was on record saying he knew nothing about it and ranked southern election so that's a political liability I agree with Chuck I don't I don't see any specific legal liability based on what we heard on that call at least it that's my gut reaction but as Chuck said and as your question just hinted at there there may be more tapes and we don't know what's on them and I am sure that the Special Counsel was very interested to see what's on them not just for their content but as Chuck said also for the the leads and and things that could be run down based on the content of those tapes one last question on this if am i the publishing company in question if they ended up potentially in trouble for this having been a campaign donation if they paid this woman to this paid this money to this woman to influence the election and they end up being pursued for that or pressured for that legally would the president's knowledge of their having made this payment be relevant potentially to that case conceivably okay so we can both be guilty of a crime if we have knowledge agree on the object of our conspiracy in other words what it is we want to accomplish and one of us either of us takes some step toward that crime so you can aid in a better crime you can conspire to commit a crime knowledge is the key if an illegal payment was made and mr. Trump didn't know it was going to happen right or had no idea that in fact it was illegal perhaps not but if they conspired they agreed together to commit a crime sure it doesn't matter that they used someone else to do it the tricky part in any prosecution for a crime like that though is that there's a readily available defense which is that the payment was made not for political purposes but to save embarrassment generally regardless of the somebody the election yeah now here that's a tough argument to make given yeah IMing but that I mean that was the defense in the John Edwards trial and it proved successful it did and John Edwards is a great example except John Edwards was running in a primary at the time not in the general and I believe the last payment to mr. Edwards was somewhere around nine to ten months before the election ah so two months before the general election might be a harder case so Matt's exactly right the timing matters a lot all right we're gonna take a quick break we're gonna come back with Michael McFaul Chuck Rosenberg and Matt Axelrod as I mentioned ambassador McFaul you may be surprised to hear this spent today at the White House at the Trump White House after the Trump White House spent four days basically openly mulling the possibility of handing him over to Russia for questioning we'll find out whatever he's willing to tell us about that when we come back stay with us hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
