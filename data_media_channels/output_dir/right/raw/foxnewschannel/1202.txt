1
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:10,060
JILLIAN: GOOD MONDAY MORNING,

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,827
CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY RACE IS

3
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:12,195
TOMORROW AND DEMOCRATS ARE

4
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,197
BECOMING MORE CONCERNED THAT

5
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:16,500
THEIR WIDE CANDIDATE FIELD WILL

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,803
HURT CHANS IN KEY CONGRESSIONAL

7
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:24,441
RACES, ARE THEY RIGHT TO WORRY?

8
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,610
PUBLISHER, SCOTT HIMSELF, THANK

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,078
YOU FOR JOINING US.

10
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:30,881
>> THANK YOU.

11
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,716
JILLIAN: ARE DEMOCRATS TO WORRY

12
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:36,653
IN CALIFORNIA?

13
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,088
>> ABOUT A COUPLE OF DISTRICTS

14
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:40,223
IN PARTICULAR.

15
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,591
THREE DISTRICTS IN ORANGE COUNTY

16
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,126
AREA WON BY HILLARY CLINTON IN A

17
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,361
NORMAL SITUATION AND NORMAL

18
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,029
STATE, YOU WOULD SAY THESE ARE

19
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,397
GOOD PICK-UP OPPORTUNITIES AND

20
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:49,066
DEMOCRATS NEED TO PICK UP SEATS

21
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,300
TO WIN CONTROL BUT BECAUSE

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,702
CALIFORNIA IS NOT A NORMAL

23
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:52,602
STATE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

24
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,738
REALLY SILLY ELECTION LAW, THEY

25
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,106
MIGHT NOT HAVE A CANDIDATE ON

26
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:58,408
THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER.

27
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:00,010
JILLIAN: EXPLAIN THAT.

28
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,877
>> JUNGLE PRIMARY SYSTEM,

29
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,379
EVERYBODY FROM BOTH PARTIES IS

30
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:05,147
THROWN ON THE BALLOT TOMORROW IN

31
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,084
CALIFORNIA AND TOP TWO WINNERS

32
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:09,252
REGARDLESS OF PARTY GO FORWARD.

33
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,987
IF YOU HAVE A DISTRICT, LET'S

34
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,056
SAY 40% OF THE VOTE GOES TO

35
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,458
REPUBLICANS AND THERE'S ONLY TWO

36
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,326
REPUBLICANS THAT GET ABOUT 20%

37
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,128
EACH, EVEN IF THE DEMOCRATS GET

38
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,297
THE OTHER 60% OF THE VOTE, IF

39
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,432
THEY HAVE 8 OR 10 CANDIDATES

40
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,667
THEY ALL MIGHT BE LEFT OUT

41
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,268
BECAUSE THEY ARE SPLITTING THE

42
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:25,669
VOTE.

43
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,670
JILLIAN: SEEMS LIKE AN

44
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,305
INTERESTING WAY TO DO THINGS.

45
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,773
>> INTERESTING IS A GOOD WORD.

46
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:30,941
JILLIAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT PLACES

47
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:34,745
TO WATCH IN CALIFORNIA.

48
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,613
>> 39, 48 AND 49.

49
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:37,848
THREE ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICTS.

50
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,883
IN EACH CASE IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN

51
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:42,919
THERE WOULD BE ONE REPUBLICAN IN

52
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:43,687
THE RUNNING.

53
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,857
IN TWO OF THE THREE YOU HAVE

54
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,624
REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT ANNOUNCED

55
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:48,892
THE PERSON THEY WOULD LIKE TO

56
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,262
SEE SUCCEED THEM AND EVERYBODY

57
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,498
ELSE IN TOSS UP FOR SECOND

58
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:54,965
PLACE.

59
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:56,700
WE HAD THIS MANY CANDIDATES,

60
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,235
YOU'RE LIKELY HAVE A WINNER

61
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,504
MAYBE WIN 25% AND THE SECOND

62
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,506
PERSON WITH 15 OR 16%.

63
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:03,874
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE, JILLIAN,

64
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,042
IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE 16

65
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,110
CANDIDATES, IF YOU HAD MORE

66
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,246
FRIENDS AND GOT THEM TOUT POLLS,

67
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,548
YOU WILL PULL OUT VICTORY.

68
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,519
JILLIAN: SO POPULAR.

69
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,089
CANDIDATE OVERLOAD.

70
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:22,859
>> IN CALIFORNIA 17 CANDIDATES.

71
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:23,794
JILLIAN: WHOA.

72
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:24,795
>> WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE

73
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:27,297
IS WHAT THE SPLIT IS, HOW MANY

74
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,465
ARE SERIOUS CANDIDATES.

75
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:30,333
THE REASON THERE'S CONCERN AMONG

76
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,568
DEMOCRATS IS THE REPUBLICANS

77
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,870
HAVE GOOD SOLID CANDIDATES WITH

78
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,038
POLITICAL RESUMES WHO ARE KNOWN

79
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,575
IN THE DISTRICTS WHO ARE LIKELY

80
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,843
TO DOMINATE THE REPUBLICAN

81
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,745
VOTERS AND DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE

82
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,245
THAT LEVEL.

83
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,647
THE OTHER ISSUE TO WATCH FOR IN

84
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,817
THE RACES IS HEAVY ASIAN

85
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,685
AMERICAN PRESENCE AND THE ASIAN

86
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:51,087
AMERICAN COMMUNITY TYPICALLY HAS

87
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,322
VOTED REPUBLICAN AT THE LOCAL

88
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,090
LEVEL BUT THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR

89
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,326
DONALD TRUMP.

90
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,327
JILLIAN: INTERESTING.

91
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,262
TALK NUMBERS.

92
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,298
10 HOUSE SEATS UP FOR GRABS IN

93
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,834
CALIFORNIA, WHAT DO THOSE

94
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:04,534
NUMBERS SAY?

95
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:05,202
>> CALIFORNIA IS VITALLY

96
00:03:05,202 --> 00:03:06,903
IMPORTANT STATE FOR THE

97
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:07,270
DEMOCRATS.

98
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,104
THIS OTHER THAN PENNSYLVANIA

99
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,372
THERE'S NO PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

100
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:12,409
PICK UP MORE GROUND, IF THEY

101
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,144
FORFEIT SOME OF THE SEATS, THEIR

102
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,080
CHANCES OF WINNING CONTROL GOES

103
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,547
AWAY.

104
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:20,684
RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE 31

105
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:21,384
COMPETITIVE RACES, DEMOCRATS

106
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:24,855
HAVE TO WIN 24 OUT OF 31 TO WIN

107
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:25,322
CONTROL.

108
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:27,557
WELL, IF THEY DO THAT, THEY WIN

109
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,559
BUT IF THEY GIVE AWAY TWO OR

110
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,294
THREE SEATS BECAUSE OF JUNGLE

111
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,297
PRIMARY, NOW YOU HAVE TO WIN 24

112
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,732
OUT OF 28.

113
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,600
JILLIAN: CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT

114
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,168
THAT SAY THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS

115
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:41,638
LEAD BY ONLY 3.2 POINTS WHICH

116
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,607
HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

117
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,074
DIFFERENCE.

118
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:44,407
>> YEAH.

119
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,976
JILLIAN: WHY DO YOU THINK THIS

120
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,409
IS?

121
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:47,944
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE ELECTION

122
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:48,879
AND HILLARY CLINTON IN MY

123
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,747
OPINION SO FOCUSED ON DONALD

124
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:52,782
TRUMP INSTEAD OF SO FOCUSED ON

125
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:54,985
HER CAMPAIGN IT SEEMS LIKE THAT

126
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,354
STILL WAS GOING ON.

127
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:57,721
>> RIGHT.

128
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:58,822
DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE REMARKABLE

129
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,023
JOB OF GETTING EVERYBODY TO TALK

130
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:02,492
ABOUT HIM AND GETTING DEMOCRATS

131
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,461
SO OBSESSED TO TALK ABOUT HIM.

132
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,762
JILLIAN: IS THAT WHY?

133
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,763
>> ONE PART OF IT.

134
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,165
LAST DECEMBER JUST BEFORE TAX

135
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,501
REFORM PASSED DEMOCRATS HAD

136
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,836
13-POINT EDGE.

137
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,738
REPUBLICANS CUT TAXES ALL OF A

138
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,005
SUDDEN -- JILLIAN: SOMEONE IS

139
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,440
TRYING TO REACH YOU.

140
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,541
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THEY ARE VOTING

141
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,676
FOR ME TOMORROW.

142
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,979
WHAT HAPPENED BACK HERE WAS WE

143
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,614
HAD -- REPUBLICANS DID SOMETHING

144
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:26,750
TO ENERGIZE THEIR BASE, THEY

145
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,151
JUMP-STARTED THE ECONOMY AND

146
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,719
THAT'S A BIG REASON.

147
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,555
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT GENERIC

148
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,557
BALLOT IF ON ELECTION DAY IT'S

149
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,492
3, 4, 5 POINTS IN DEMOCRATIC

150
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,360
FAVOR IT'S GOING TO BE A

151
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,827
TOSS-UP.

152
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,195
DEMOCRATS WILL GAIN SEAT BUT WE

153
00:04:39,195 --> 00:00:00,000
DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO WIN
