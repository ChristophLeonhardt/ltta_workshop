TODAY, BILL COSBY
WAS FOUND GUILTY IN HIS SEXUAL
ASSAULT RETRIAL.
HE WAS FOUND
GUILTY ON THREE FELONY COUNTS OF
AGGRAVATED INDECENT ASSAULT
TODAY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY,
PENNSYLVANIA.
THIS COMES FROM
LAST JUNE WHEN HIS LAST TRIAL
WAS DECLARED A MISTRIAL AND IT
WAS PRETTY SURPRISING FOR A LOT
OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.
AFTERWARD, SOME OF THE WOMEN IN
THE COURTROOM WERE SEEN SOBBING,
HUGGING EACH OTHER, I THINK WE
HAVE VIDEO.
A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL OPERATION.
I'M SORRY.
GUILTY OF ALL THREE COUNTS.
WE HAD THE VERDICT.
BILL
COSBY, GUILTY ON ALL THREE
COUNTS.
I REPEAT, BILL COSBY IS
GUILTY ON ALL THREE COUNTS.
THAT IS THAT INDECENT AGGRAVATED
FELONY ASSAULT, GUILTY.
THAT
MEANS THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY ON
PENETRATION WITHOUT CONSENT,
THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY OF
PENETRATION WHILE SOMEONE
WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND ALSO WHILE
SHE WAS INTOXICATED.
AN INCREDIBLE TURN OF EVENTS.
THIS WAS REGARDING ANDREA
CONSTAND SPECIFICALLY BUT IT
HINGED ON A LOT OF PEOPLE
BECAUSE AS YOU'LL REMEMBER,
THERE WERE 50 ACCUSERS AGAINST
BILL COSBY THOUGH CONSTAND'S
TRIAL WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT
RESULTED IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL.
SO WE ARE TALKING A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
COURTROOM.
IT'S OF COURSE NOT
FILMED BUT KRISTIN FEDEN WHO WAS
THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY
IN HER CLOSING REMARKS SAW THAT
BILL COSBY SEEM TO BE SMILING
AND LAUGHING AS SHE POINTED OUT:
ON THE OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
KATHLEEN BLESS ONE OF HIS
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS.
SHE IS REFERRING SPECIFICALLY
TO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, GOING ON
TO SAY:
TO 
WHICH HER SIDE SAID, NO.
HE
IS THE CON.
IF YOU DO NOT MIND, I CANNOT
HELP BUT JUMP IN RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY A
LOT OF WOMEN DO NOT COME FORWARD
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED
IN THIS WAY, BECAUSE IT MEANS
THAT YOUR CHARACTER WILL BE
CALLED INTO QUESTION WHEN YOU
ARE IN COURT AND IT IS AN
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO GO
THROUGH IF YOU ARE IN FACT A
VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT AND I REALLY DO
COMMEND THE WOMEN WHO WERE BRAVE
ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD AND GO
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THAT IS
NOT TO SAY THAT THE WOMEN WHO
DIDN'T GO THROUGH IT OR NOT
BRAVE, BUT IT IS JUST AN
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO GO
THROUGH AND IN ORDER FOR ANY
JUSTICE TO BE SERVED, YOU NEED
TO TAKE HIM TO COURT AND
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU HAVE TO SIT
THROUGH THOSE DISGUSTING
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO
BE MADE BY THE DEFENSE.
THANK YOU.
THAT IS EXACTLY
RIGHT.
THE MOST DISGUSTING
THING IS THAT THEY DISPARAGE
THOSE WOMEN, THOSE WOMEN WHO
WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, PREYED
UPON, THEY DISPARAGE THEM AND
CALLED THEM LIARS AND
OPPORTUNISTS.
IT IS DISGUSTING
AND THEY SHOULD APOLOGIZE BEYOND
THE JUDGMENT.
THIS GUY IS GOING
ON ICE FOR 30 YEARS OR WHATEVER.
SCREW HIM.
HE ABUSE TO THESE
WOMEN AND THIS ONE WOMAN WHO
ACTUALLY GOT TO THE THRESHOLD OF
A TRIAL THE REMEMBER THE STATUE
OF LIMITATIONS IS UP FOR A
SCORES OF OTHERS.
AS SHE SAID
THERE WERE UPWARDS OF 50 AND
THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES WHO
STEPPED FORWARD.
IT IS A SAD
FACT THAT THE SYSTEM ALLOWS FOR
THE MUDDYING OF THE REPUTATIONS
OF THESE WOMEN AND THEN AFTER A
SOUND JUDGMENT IS REACHED, THERE
IS NO APOLOGY FROM THE OTHER
SIDE.
IT IS TRULY SAD.
FOR ME,
TODAY, HAVING WITNESSED WHAT HAD
HAPPENED IN THIS TRIAL, IT WAS
BITTERSWEET.
THE SWEET PART IS SEEING THIS
GUY FINALLY BROUGHT TO
JUSTICE, BUT THE BITTER PART IS
ALL OF THE DAMAGE HE DID TO
THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE WOMEN
OR TRIED TO DO TO THEM
ALONG THE WAY.
I MEAN THAT WAS THE CRUX OF
COSBY'S LAWYER'S ARGUMENTS WAS
TO
DISCREDIT EACH ONE OF THESE
WOMEN, TO DISCREDIT THIS
MOVEMENT.
SHE KIND OF DID
CHARACTERIZE THEM NEGATIVELY.
SHE DID SAY QUESTIONING AN
ACCUSER IS NOT VICTIMIZING,
SHE
CALLED THEM MONEY HUNGRY AND
FAILURES IN THEIR LIVES.
I
THINK THAT IS SHAMING, OR MAYBE
NOT SHAMING SO MUCH AS
SLANDERING.
AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND, THIS
IS NOT A CIVIL LAWSUIT, THIS IS
A CRIMINAL CASE AND THESE ARE
WOMEN WHO ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO
TESTIFY IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHERE
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET MUDDY.
THEY ARE HOPING TO GET JUSTICE
AND LUCKILY IN THIS CASE THEY
DID.
WHAT I ALSO FOUND
INTERESTING WAS THAT THE
PROSECUTOR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
COSBY POTENTIALLY BEING A FLIGHT
RISK AND ASKED THAT THE JUDGE
NOT GRANTS BAIL AND COSBY
LOST IT.
YOU HAVE THE DETAILS ON THAT BY
ANY CHANCE?
I DON'T.
COSBY LOST AND STARTED
CURSING AT THE PROSECUTOR.
THE
JUDGE ENDED UP DECIDING TO GRANT
BAIL AND SO THE JUDGE DOES NOT
SEE HIM AS A FLIGHT RISK BUT THE
ARGUMENT MADE BY THE PROSECUTOR
WAS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE
JET AND HE MIGHT TRY TO FLEE,
BUT AGAIN, THE JUDGE DID NOT BUY
THAT SO HE WILL BE ABLE TO POST
ELLEN WAIT UNTIL HE GETS
SENTENCE.
HE'S APPARENTLY
FACING
10 YEARS FOR EACH CHARGE.
THAT IS A MAXIMUM SENTENCE I
THINK WAS 80 YEARS.
WAS IT?
I ONLY SAW IT IN ONE PLACE.
MULTIPLE REPORTS INDICATED
THAT EACH CONVENTION
CARRIES UP TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON
SO IT IS 30 YEARS.
BUT HE IS 80.
THEY SAID YOU CAN SERVE
CONSECUTIVELY OR AT THE
SAME TIME.
CONCURRENTLY OR
CONSECUTIVELY.
IT IS NOT CLEAR.
HE DID SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT
JUST AS A FACT SO HE
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY IS ONE IMPORTANT THING
BUT THE OTHER MOMENT AND I LOVE
THAT CAN MENTIONED THIS, DURING
THE SUMMATION WHEN COSBY DID
LAUGH, THAT MOMENT IS A GREAT
MOMENT TO SEIZE IF YOU ARE A
PROSECUTOR AND THAT PROSECUTOR
DID SEIZE ON IT AND TURN TO HIM
AND SAID AS KIM WAS NOTING, YOU
MAY THINK THIS IS FUNNY MR.
COSBY, BUT THERE IS NOTHING
FUNNY ABOUT THIS AND THAT IS A
MOMENT THAT CAN PIERCE THROUGH
RIGHT AT THE END OF A TRIAL AND
CLEARLY SOMETHING DEAD AND
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT DID
NOT HER CASE.
EXACTLY DOTS OF THIS CASE WAS
SPECIAL OR MORE SPECIAL BECAUSE
LAST TIME THEY ONLY ALLOWED ONE
OTHER ACCUSER TO TALK ABOUT HER
DEALINGS WITH BILL COSBY.
THIS
TIME THERE WERE FIVE OTHERS AND
THIS WAS TO SHOW THAT COSBY HAD
A PATTERN OF DOING SPECIFIC
THINGS TO HIS VICTIMS.
THEY
INCLUDED JANICE DICKINSON WHO IS
THE FORMER, FIRST SUPERMODEL,
JANICE BAKER KENNY, SO LOST IT
WAS ACTUALLY CRYING THROUGH A
LOT OF HER TESTIMONY AND
ACTUALLY CALLED OUT TO COSBY
ACROSS THE COURTROOM AFTER
DESCRIBING, BECAUSE THIS
HAPPENED WHEN SHE WAS 17.
HE
TOOK HER TO HIS HOTEL ROOM TO
HELP HER WITH HER MODELING
CAREER AND SHE CALLED OUT TO
HIM AND SAID, YOU REMEMBER,
DON'T YOU MR.
COSBY?
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER
COURTROOM.
IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL
BUT THOSE WOMEN SEEM TO BE
ELATED WITH THE RESULT ARE.
AND I WAS ACTUALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT JANICE DICKINSON'S ROLE IN
THIS CASE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
SHE DID TESTIFY AGAINST HIM,
DURING I BELIEVE CROSS
EXAMINATION SHE HAD SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW SHE MADE
THINGS UP ABOUT COSBY AND ONE OF
HER BOOKS AND SO THEY QUESTIONED
HER CREDIBILITY IN MAKING
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST COSBY AS A
RESULT AND THAT MADE ME WORRY
BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE ONE PERSON
MAY HAVE EMBELLISHED THINGS FOR
HER BOOK DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE
OTHER VICTIMS ARE MAKING THINGS
UP.
I DID NOT WANT THAT
UNDERMINE WITH THE OTHER VICTIMS
HAVE GONE THROUGH AND LUCKILY,
BASED ON THESE THREE CHARGES
THAT HE IS NOT CONVICTED OF, HER
TESTIMONY IN HER BOOK DID NOT
UNDERMINE.
THEY DID TARGET HER BOOK BECAUSE
THEY SAID YOU DIDN'T SAY THIS
HAPPENED IN YOUR BOOK AND THEN
HER PUBLISHER HAD TO TESTIFY, WE
DID NOT SAVE FOR LEGAL REASONS
WHICH MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
EXACTLY.
THEY DID ESTABLISH THIS DANCE
THAT COSBY DID WITH ALL OF THESE
WOMEN, HIS MO WAS THE SAME AND
HE DID ABUSE HIS POSITION.
HE
DID ABUSE THE REPUTATION THAT HE
HAD AS BEING THIS FATHERLY
FIGURE AND A SHOW BUSINESS ICON
AND THEN HE DID THIS AWFUL
THING.
TO DRUG AND RAPE ALL OF
THE WAS WOMEN AND AGAIN, IT WAS
JUST ONE WOMAN WHO SAW JUSTICE
BANAS SINCE MANY OF HIS VICTIMS
SOUGHT JUSTICE TODAY AS WELL.
