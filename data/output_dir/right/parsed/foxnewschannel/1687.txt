ON THAN THIS FAMILY.
WHAT DID HER DAD DO?
>> JULIE, THIS WEDDING MAY BE
IN WINDSOR BUT THE DRAMA IS
6,000 MILES AWAY SOUTH OF WHERE
I'M SITTING ACROSS THE BORDER
IN MEXICO WHERE MEGHAN MARKLE'S
DAD, THOMAS, LIVES AND HAS BEEN
AT THE CENTER OF A WILL HE,
WON'T HE SAGA?
MEGHAN WANTS HER DAD TO WALK
HER DOWN THE AISLE.
FIRST SAYING HE WOULD, THEN
DECIDING HE WOULDN'T IN THE
WAKE OF A BIZARRE STORY
INVOLVING HIM STAGING SOME
PHOTOS OF HIMSELF WITH
PAPARAZZI, THEN SAYING HE WOULD
AGAIN BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE
PART OF HISTORY.
THAT'S A QUOTE.
NOW HE IS PROBABLY MAYBE,
POSSIBLY, DEFINITELY NOT GOING
BECAUSE HE TOLD HIS CHOSEN
MEDIA OUTLET TMZ HE IS
UNDERGOING HEART SURGERY TODAY
AND WON'T BE ABLE TO FLY.
MEGHAN MARKLE'S HALF SISTER
BLAMED THE TABLOID PRESS FOR
HOUNDING HER 73-YEAR-OLD FATHER
WHILE MEGHAN'S HALF BROTHER
CALLED THOMAS WROTE AN OPEN
LETTER TO PRINCE HARRY WARNING
HIM TO CALL OFF MARRYING MEGHAN.
IT CAUSED SOME BRIT TO ROLL
THEIR EYES AS THE AMERICAN
REALITY SHOW NATURE OF THE
MARKLE BRITS.
THEY HOPE THEY CAN RISE ABOVE
THE PAST BEHAVIOR OF THEIR
PARENTS.
MY MOM SAYS, THE ARBITER OF ALL
THINGS ROYAL, SHE JUST WANTS
HARRY TO BE HAPPY.
THAT'S THE FINAL WORD FROM MOM.
