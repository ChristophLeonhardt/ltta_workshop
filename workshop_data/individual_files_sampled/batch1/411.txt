late last year to news organizations funded by the Russian government RT & Sputnik were forced to register as foreign agents in the United States at the insistence of the Department of Justice in Washington the DOJ x' orders were issued following claims by US intelligence agencies that the two outlets were part of the Kremlin's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election and american lawmakers have since threatened other foreign funded broadcasters including this one al jazeera with similar measures but what about the flip side of that namely the US government's own state-funded media operations that broadcast to 100 countries in more than 60 languages those stations include Voice of America and Radio Free europe/radio Liberty which have been lauded in some quarters for providing reliable reporting in countries with limited press freedom however like RT & Sputnik they've also been accused of producing propaganda dressed up as News at the service of their sponsors in the State Department the listening-posts Flo Phillips now on us state-funded media overseas in the at times muddy waters through its journalism and propaganda flow an American intelligence report finds that one of the weapons in the Kremlin's Arsenal was its state-run news network RT a congressional committee in the USS just revoked RT America's accreditation on Capitol Hill since RT in Sputnik news were forced to register as foreign agents back in November 2017 US officials have threatened other government-funded broadcasters like CG TN and Al Jazeera with the same treatment but the US government itself is no stranger to broadcasting into other countries its foreign media budget stands at 685 million dollars dwarfing the 450 million dollars parceled out to domestic public broadcaster's the foreign media operation is run through the broadcasting Board of Governors the BBG which houses five broadcasting centers under its umbrella the office of Cuba broadcasting based in Miami is home to radio and TV Mukti there's also Radio Free Asia which covers the socialist and communist countries of Southeast Asia and the Middle East broadcasting networks including 24/7 Arabic language TV network al hora but the bee bee gees flagship stations are without doubt Voice of America and Radio Free europe/radio Liberty as is the case with our tea weather their output is journalism or propaganda depends on who you ask if you look at what our ferl is broadcasting it is news it's information it's moderate in tone it's not propagandistic it may have a stance but the kinds of coverage really aren't that much different than you would find in the Washington Post or the New York Times or rather major independent media the kind of cozy relationship that eventually emerged between Voice of America right you free Europe and the propaganda machine Merriweather is US State Department or CIA is not Posey is just like employees these are state run the budget comes from the government there is no independence yes news is being communicated but in a way with a selected constellation of news that pushes forward a very particular line of understanding the world one of the questions that has arisen involving VOA and other broadcasters in recent years has been are you simply providing journalism to those people or are you trying to agitate and fan the flames of resistance in any target country you're broadcasting to we shall speak to you about America and the war the news may be good or bad we shall tell you the truth Voice of America was started during World War two by the Office of War Information as a vehicle to counter Nazi propaganda today Europe also hears a new and forthright attack on Moscow from the transmitters of Radio Free Europe a privately sponsored American organization which are sales Communism with no holds barred Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty began life during the early years of the Cold War as an oppositional broadcasting station to the Communist world their claim that they were privately sponsored was in fact a cover story in truth they were the product of CIA psychological warfare operations and the agency continued to provide their funding and even senior staff until the early 1970s during the Cold War we saw in different parts of Europe there was the same kind of lack of information as people were you know stuck behind they what we called then the Iron Curtain and we didn't know at that point who was listening and we just kept sending this news and information about what was really going on in the world what the outside world was like message is a peace and goodwill are to be relayed to those who enough of RAD propaganda and it was only after the wall came down that we began to hear from people and how important that lifeline of news and information was for them when these countries got their independence their leaders and their freedom fighters if you will gave great credit to VOA and Radio Free Europe when you look back at the broad history of the Cold War RC and RL played an important role part of it was news but so but part of it was clearly propaganda sometimes that propaganda took these cold warriors well beyond the traditional remit of journalists in the 1960s veteran CBS journalist Edward R Morrow was appointed director of the United States Information Agency or USIA the body within the State Department that oversaw Voice of America Murrow was drafted in to boost the agency's prestige in practice he did more than that this memo from Murrow to the CIA director of the time offered the support of the u.s. IAS Cuba broadcasters to aid the CIA in its efforts to overthrow the Castro government broadcast could urge Cubans Murrow said to engage in relatively safe forms of sabotage if real results were achieved he continued The Voice of America could report these as evidence of opposition to the Castro regime through interviews with refugees and extracts from letters the 1970s saw efforts to create more distance between the government and its broadcasters in 1971 the CIA's funding of Radio Free europe/radio Liberty was revealed and swiftly terminated five years later a law creating voice of America's current Charter was passed including a barrier a kind of firewall intended to prevent government interference the firewall is often trotted out as an example of the shield that enables VOA to do independent unfettered journalistic work but the more intelligent and more formed journalists at VOA we're always aware that there was pressure being imposed down the line and that pressure could always end up on the desk of a specific writer or correspondent this close relationship between u.s. foreign policy and u.s. foreign funded media continues to attract criticism today US policy towards Iran has vacillated between suspicions and threats of regime change the u.s. government budget for broadcasting in Iran shared between voice of America's Persian service and Radio Farda an offshoot of Radio Free Europe is estimated at more than 30 million dollars per year the fundamental mission of venues like Voice of America or Radio Free Europe is to pick and choose certain events that have actually happened and package it in a way that dovetails with the regime-change narrative for example late last year we had a series of labor related demonstrations in Iran people demanding living wages and so forth they pick particularly on certain kinds of slogans that say if not tomorrow the day after tomorrow this regime will fall in turkey voyage to the who cannot vouch for the margins and additional debt cannot be refuted it's gay and who's not being fired on young people we covered both sides of the issue we covered what the protesters were saying we covered what the government of Iran was saying about the protesters we covered what the US government was saying and what we discovered is even though in Iran it's against the law to access our content we found the views of our content go like this before the protests and all of a sudden they went like that it is undeniable that US foreign funded media do provide some Public Interest journalism in countries with limited press freedom often a considerable risk to their journalists nonetheless few would deny their status as instruments of soft power from the 1940s until the end of the Cold War the u.s. along with Britain's BBC enjoyed hegemony in state-funded foreign broadcasting but as hard power has begun to shift and new players rise in an emerging multipolar world they too have started to broadcast their perspectives to other parts of the globe this is something that Washington has found difficult to accept by attacking alleged Russian propaganda the u.s. fired a shot in a new cold information war well US authorities wondered a media war and Russia's giving it right back to them that's what that means is that the US government funded outlets like Voice of America will probably have to register in Russia as foreign agents a shot that may well have ended up inadvertently jeopardizing their own state-funded media operation you
