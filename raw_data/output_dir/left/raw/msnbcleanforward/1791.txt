STARTED, I’D READ SOMETHING AND SAY, OH, MY GOD, THE WORLD.

326
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:15,149
SAY, OH, MY GOD, THE WORLD. THEN YOU COME TO BELIEVE, PEOPLE

327
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,351
THEN YOU COME TO BELIEVE, PEOPLE DO HAVE A FILTER.

328
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:17,986
DO HAVE A FILTER. AND YES, SOMEBODY MAY.

329
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,220
AND YES, SOMEBODY MAY. BUT YOU CAN’T REACT TO

330
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,521
BUT YOU CAN’T REACT TO EVERYTHING YOU READ OR SEE.

331
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,457
EVERYTHING YOU READ OR SEE. PEOPLE ARE NOT AS STUPID AS THEY

332
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:22,791
PEOPLE ARE NOT AS STUPID AS THEY APPEAR.

333
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,159
APPEAR. I THINK THIS IS A LINCOLN LINE,

334
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:25,961
I THINK THIS IS A LINCOLN LINE, IF YOU SEE THE INDIVIDUAL

335
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:27,429
IF YOU SEE THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN, THEY’LL SCARE THE LIFE

336
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,331
AMERICAN, THEY’LL SCARE THE LIFE OF YOU FOR OUR DEMOCRACY, BUT

337
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,765
OF YOU FOR OUR DEMOCRACY, BUT THERE IS A COLLECTIVE WISDOM TO

338
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:31,032
THERE IS A COLLECTIVE WISDOM TO IT.

339
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,968
IT. >> ALSO, IF YOU SIT DOWN

340
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,069
>> ALSO, IF YOU SIT DOWN FACE-TO-FACE WITH SOMEONE,

341
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:35,037
FACE-TO-FACE WITH SOMEONE, PEOPLE AREN’T EVIL.

342
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,273
PEOPLE AREN’T EVIL. THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR BEST

343
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:38,573
THEY WANT TO LIVE THEIR BEST LIVES.

344
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:39,974
LIVES. WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE A TRUMP

345
00:09:39,985 --> 00:09:41,243
WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE A TRUMP SUPPORTER AND YOU SAY THOSE

346
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:42,878
SUPPORTER AND YOU SAY THOSE PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT, THIS AND

347
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:43,245
PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT, THIS AND THAT.

348
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:45,080
THAT. THEY WANTED TO LIVE A BETTER

349
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:45,380
THEY WANTED TO LIVE A BETTER LIFE.

350
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,249
LIFE. AND THE SYSTEM THEY WERE LIVING

351
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,350
AND THE SYSTEM THEY WERE LIVING IN ISN’T SERVING THEM.

352
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,184
IN ISN’T SERVING THEM. >> EXACTLY.

353
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:51,586
>> EXACTLY. >> THOSE AREN’T PEOPLE BORN OUT

354
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,254
>> THOSE AREN’T PEOPLE BORN OUT OF HATE AND WANT TO CREATE

355
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:54,556
OF HATE AND WANT TO CREATE VIOLENCE, NO.

356
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,993
VIOLENCE, NO. >> HARDEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IS

357
00:09:58,003 --> 00:09:58,360
>> HARDEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IS CIVILITY.

358
00:09:58,370 --> 00:00:00,000
CIVILITY. >> PEOPLE WANT TO BE SOCIALLY
