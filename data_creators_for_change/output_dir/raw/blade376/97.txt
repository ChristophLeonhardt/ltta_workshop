1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
if you're ever against the establishment

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,380
it's very easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to go do see no</font>

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,810
consequence easy but I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,519
there are a lot of arguments against the

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,889
monarchy it is a latest it is tainted

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:12,480
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> religious ethnic and gender</font>

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,219
discrimination it<font color="#CCCCCC"> devalues the</font>

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">parliamentary system it encourages</font>

9
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to sing a national anthem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

10
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,619
don't truly believe in it d values

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,240
intellect and achievement and they're

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,650
not accountable but I don't really want

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to press on those issues specifically</font>

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,949
back in May this year Queen Elizabeth

15
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,260
the second gave a speech to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parliament</font>

16
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,689
in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> she sat on a gold chair with a</font>

17
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,880
hat made of diamonds about austerity

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,730
measures and for me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

19
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,559
outrageous whilst amusing at the same

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,170
time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just it seemed like it</font>

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,850
was a comedy sketch it just was very

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,730
very surreal as is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> most things that</font>

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">are traditional in the 21st century and</font>

24
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,950
there were politicians<font color="#E5E5E5"> their politicians</font>

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,170
are men<font color="#E5E5E5"> of represent us using their</font>

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,320
expertise to sort out the current

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,149
problems in society and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world as</font>

28
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,609
a whole in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of tradition for</font>

29
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,550
that period of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they have suspended</font>

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,430
their integrity just to stand there in

31
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,530
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure in their heads they're</font>

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,210
going can't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're still doing</font>

33
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,430
this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just seems so backwards</font>

34
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,150
that these politicians who have

35
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,729
responsibilities are just accepting that

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,140
because if they accept that to be

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,970
normality then what else do they find

38
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,810
acceptable in society which as far as

39
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm concerned is backwards as and

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second point I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up I</font>

41
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,530
think it's desirable as a human<font color="#CCCCCC"> race to</font>

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,140
create a global society<font color="#E5E5E5"> where everyone</font>

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,290
has equal opportunity the only people I

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,650
believe are against that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are those that</font>

45
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,500
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the mindset that one person's</font>

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,540
gain is another person's loss and it

47
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,979
will always be that way because of

48
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">scarcity discussion for another time but</font>

49
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">even if we've been idealistic and the</font>

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,759
thing I say about I you know being

51
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,520
idealistic is that's dreaming that's

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,960
foresight that's looking off in the

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,759
distance and saying that's where I want

54
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be and any distance we achieve up to</font>

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,700
that point even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't reach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,639
is progress and surely that's a good

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,730
thing and in regards to class and social

58
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,340
mobility there's a family

59
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,300
either is only rewarded because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

60
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,090
family<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were born into which surely</font>

61
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,680
is what we're against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole point is</font>

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,910
it doesn't matter what family you're

63
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,860
born into everyone should have the

64
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,290
necessities of life and yes the Queen

65
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> royal family does do a lot of</font>

66
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,890
charity but is it always about money

67
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,750
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about tourism</font>

68
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,080
it surely it's about the values you know

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,879
it there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of things in life that</font>

70
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,890
can make money there are lots of things

71
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,930
that can do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> for charity but if the</font>

72
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,870
integrity and the value system is

73
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,290
apparent then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think that should</font>

74
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,269
exist in my opinion so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion to</font>

75
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,730
this video I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> by no means saying that</font>

76
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,290
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has happened under the</font>

77
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,380
royal family is bad I'm not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

78
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,810
outrageous people<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be ashamed for</font>

79
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,910
supporting the royal family all I'm

80
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,310
saying is think about it if we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever</font>

81
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,410
to progress to create a much freer and

82
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,120
better culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which people have</font>

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">equal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunities the royal family has</font>

84
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">no place in that vision because as long</font>

85
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,970
as that institution sticks it will

86
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,069
forever be a reflection of what was

87
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,950
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past and that's all I have</font>

88
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,989
to say on this weekend of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diamond</font>

89
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,180
jubilee so if you're out celebrating it

90
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,959
have a good time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just think and get</font>

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,000
back to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> on why you're celebrating it</font>

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,870
oh yes the next time

93
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,150
I've met members of the royal family and

94
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,070
they're lovely people they're people

95
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have been brought up in a certain</font>

96
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,190
environment and they've made the most of

97
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,630
it and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be faulted for that</font>

98
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,940
but their titles and what they represent

99
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,090
in society that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I have a problem</font>

100
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,770
with and therefore it's not a personal

101
00:03:56,770 --> 00:00:00,000
attack
