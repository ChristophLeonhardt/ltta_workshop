so yet another massacre a shooting in Tennessee this time at a Waffle House at 319 in the morning unbelievably there were many people in the Waffle House at that early it was Saturday night going to Sunday morning and for a while all the way to today Monday person had not been apprehended but he has been now so let me give you that breaking news Travis Reinking and we give the names of these mass shooters on the first day and try not to do it afterwards his apprehended moments ago in a wooded area near Old Hickory Boulevard in Hobson Park that's according to match Metro Nashville PD and they put him his picture going into a cop car so that's a huge relief for the for the area overall now let me give you more details lieutenant Carlos Lera of the Nashville police said mr. Ron King was carrying a backpack that contained a handgun ammunition and a holster of course he was now you're gonna see this guy is very mentally unbalanced but nonetheless has access to untold weaponry the shooting he did with an ar-15 not surprising the choice of most mass murderers in America most the massacres are done with ar-15s it's an assault weapon which unbelievably to the rest of the world is legal in America and almost any lunatic in the country can get one and murder anyone he likes and that's exactly what happened here we'll get to his mental problems in a second first of all I want to show you the victims as well because these are the people that we actually have to care about and that's why we try not to talk about the the defendants name after the first day unfortunately D Benny groves was killed today or like I said on Sunday morning Jo Perez Aquila de Silva taurine si Sanderlin all killed now they all happen to be minorities and the shooter is a has affiliated with a right-wing group but we don't know if that's why he chose this Waffle House or these victims there are also two other people who got shot the two surviving victims were chanita Wagner 21 and Sherita Henderson before so now I'm gonna go to HuffPost for details about the shooter after the government opened fire on the diners and the restaurant staff first let me tell you about a hero actually 29 year old James Shaw jr. tackled and disarmed him Shaw said he pounced after seeing rankings gun jam and now everyone is celebrating James Shaw Shaw jr. as a hero he says he's not well that's what most heroes say and he said look I was just trying to save myself and that's why he tackled him interestingly the hero did not have a gun so perhaps the only way to get a bad guy is not necessarily a good guy with a gun and God helped James Shaw jr. if he did have a con gun and cops walked in at that moment so no authorities said there would have been a greater bloodshed had a 29 year old customer James Shaw not wrestled the rifle away from mr. ranking while he was reloading so bless his heart for that saved a lot of lives there Illinois police officers that will hold on before let me a before I get you two more this background so this is what happened in the Waffle House now we know that Ryan King had problems in the past because of two incidents one was relatively famous when he actually went after Donald Trump of all people but before I get to that to give you a sense of the mental issues that Ryan King had let me go to this explanation this is something that happened in another state Illinois police officers were called to a CBS parking lot back in 2016 when ranking threatened to kill himself her police reports obtained by both ABC 7 Chicago and W krn deputies reports indicated the Reinking claimed that singer Taylor Swift had been stalking and harassing him riking said at the time that he believes swift hacked his phone and netflix account adding that she asked them to meet at a Dairy Queen according to ABC 7 in the US people who believe that Taylor Swift has have hacked our Netflix account can still find a way to get ar-15s and mow down people and commit massacres is it him that's crazy or the rest of us that we live in a country so corrupt that we let weapons manufacturers decide what our laws are even if 93 percent of the country wants federal background checks and that is the lightest of gun control nope you're not allowed to have it even people who are clearly certifiably insane can get their hands on a lot of weapons I think we're the crazy ones so now let's go to the famous incident Ryan King was arrested last July after he allegedly tried to cross a security barrier near the White House and an attempt to meet Trump authorities said well let's find out why Ryan King said he want to meet with US President Donald Trump and told The Secret Service officer at the northeast entrance that he was a quote sovereign citizen who had quote a right to inspect the grounds according to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report dated July 7th 2017 he was charged with unlawful entry an arrest report states but the charges were dismissed after he completed community service that's what we call white privilege imagine if a Muslim guy said I'm a sovereign citizen I don't have to follow the laws of your country I'm gonna go meet the President and we found out that in his previously he had had problems with both his mental issues but also with weapons do you think that we let the Muslim guy off with community service is that what we do in this country maybe you live in a different country if you think that but hold I'm not even done yet first of all if you haven't heard of this screw you might be wondering who the hell are they what is this thing so let's go to target points memo for the explanation sovereign citizens according to the Southern Poverty Law Center believe that they not judges juries law enforcement or elected officials get to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore well that must be convenient for them again if this was a Muslim group who said no we're not gonna follow in your loss if it was a black that said we're not gonna follow any other laws they get to walk around willy-nilly right hold because it gets much worse in a 2011 law enforcement bulletin the FBI said it considered sovereign citizen extremists as comprising a domestic terrorist movement and counted six law enforcement officers who had been murdered by movement adherence since 2000 could you imagine if black lives matter had murdered six police officers and said yeah that's right we don't have to follow your laws we got freedom of speech you think their leaders wouldn't be walking around no daddy had been rounded up so quick there have been enormous pressure to round them up imagine if there was another group labeled a terrorist group by the FBI that was Muslim like I yeah we're Isis and we got to share we shot six cops yes our comrades there were caught okay but we'll continue as a movement now they'd have been rounded up they'd been in Guantanamo Bay but if you're a right winger and more so than white privilege it's a right wing privilege you're just gonna walk around say yeah yeah yeah everyone so our group kills cops so what what are you gonna do about it nothing right and everyone thought we go ahead and threaten the president's life what are you gonna do about it nothing and you're gonna give me my guns back so how did he get his guns back well after his arrest for the White House episode mr. Ryan King who lived in Morton Illinois was forced to surrender three rifles and a handgun to officials in August just months before he moved to Nashville Wow someone in America had to give up guns if you threaten the president maybe then right hold after the rampage in Nashville on Sunday officials could not fully explain how mr. ranking regained possession of his weapons the Tazewell County Sheriff's Office in Illinois give the weapons he owned including the ar-15 he took to the Waffle House on Sunday to his father Jeffrey Ryan King yeah that sounds like maybe that had something to do with it in it so let's dive in a little further see if his dad to give it back sheriff Robert M Hudson of Tazewell County said a news conference on Sunday that while Travis ranking voluntarily surrendered the weapons on twenty-fourth his father had a firearm owners identification card an illegal right to take the weapons imagine a Muslim terrorist threatens the president has to give up his weapons but they're like hey now wait we'll give it to your dad that is not going to happen but America you're white and you're right-wing oh I'm sorry sir did you threaten the president no problem just community service and then we'll give you your your weapons your dad I I'm sure they keep it for safe giving so let's go to the last quote here the police in Nashville indicated that Mister rankings father returned the weapons to his son so easy to get those guns back and those are the guns that killed those four people shot the other two and if it wasn't for James Shaw what had killed a hell of a lot more in America we let any lunatic as long as they're white and right winger yeah well even if they're Muslim were black in the beginning they can get any guns they like if they show any sign of trouble then they're gonna have issues which the right-wingers will never have issues no matter how many times they say we're not gonna follow your laws we're gonna do whatever the hell we want we're gonna kill whoever the hell we want no right-wingers Rush Limbaugh Fox News will say something oh please please don't touch them even Obama he funded the group it within law enforcement that was looking after white right-wingers because they commit more terrorism in America than any other group oh but Rush Limbaugh on Fox News yelled Adam it's Trump doing anything about this my god the man might have killed you Donald Trump nothing no discussion of this no nothing imagine if it was a Latino undocumented immigrant who would try to go after Trump how much would Donald Trump have tweeted about this story imagine if it was a Muslim how much wouldn't Donald Trump and tweeted about this story is there anyone right now going we got a band all the right-wing groups until we figure out what the hell is going on in this country no there isn't and another one will get another way shoot more people and commit more massacres cuz nobody's home and what he's doing anything they get to run wild now six more victims in Tennessee if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
