1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,204
>> LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN 

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,405
TO THE WORLD AND COUNTRY, WE 

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,639
STAND BY OUR NATO ALLIES AND 

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,640
ALL THOSE COUNTRIES WHO ARE 

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,876
FACING RUSSIA AGGRESSION. 

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,311
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I STOOD UP 

7
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:17,283
HERE AND TOLD YOU WHAT I THINK 

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:17,816
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN? 

9
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,018
HE DOES NOT SHARE OUR INTEREST, 

10
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,653
HE DOES NOT SHARE OUR VALUES. 

11
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,856
WE JUST CONDUCTED A YEAR-LONG 

12
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,357
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA'S 

13
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,794
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 

14
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:28,795
THEY DID INTERFERE IN THE 

15
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,729
ELECTIONS, IT IS CLEAR. 

16
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,466
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT. 

17
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,901
IT IS ALSO CLEAR IT DID NOT 

18
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,136
HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE 

19
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:36,436
ELECTIONS. 

20
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,339
AS A RESULT WE PASSED TOUGH 

21
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,540
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA SO WE CAN 

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,108
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. 

23
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,810
I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE AND THE 

24
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:47,247
NEED TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS. 

25
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,081
THAT IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE. 

26
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,883
RUSSIA IS A MENACING GOVERNMENT 

27
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,117
WHO DOES NOT SHARE OUR INTEREST 

28
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,752
OR OUR VALUES AND THAT SHOULD 

29
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,020
BE MADE VERY CLEAR. 

30
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,858
>>WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU NOW 

31
00:00:58,858 --> 00:00:59,892
TO CAPITOL HILL WERE DEMOCRATIC 

32
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:02,729
LEADERS ARE SPEAKING. 

33
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,964
THIS IS NANCY PELOSI. 

34
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:09,034
>> THE STRANGE AND DISTURBING 

35
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,203
AND HEARTBREAKING THAT 

36
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,039
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGHOUT THE 

37
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,774
VALUES THAT WERE THE BASIS OF 

38
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,242
THE HELSINKI COMMISSION WHEN HE 

39
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,312
WAS COWERING BEFORE PRESIDENT 

40
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:24,017
PUTIN YESTERDAY. 

41
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,251
INSTEAD OF STANDING UP FOR OUR 

42
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,386
DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC 

43
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,888
PRINCIPLES, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

44
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:29,923
COWERED IN THE PRESENCE OF 

45
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,826
PUTIN AND THE ENTIRE WORLD 

46
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:34,627
WATCHED AND SAW THAT. 

47
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,628
TRUMPS EAGERNESS TO SELL OUT 

48
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,030
AMERICA PROVES THE RUSSIANS 

49
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,698
MUST HAVE SOMETHING PERSONALLY, 

50
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,633
POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY ON 

51
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,569
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

52
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,172
AS DAN COATS HAS SAID THE 

53
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,206
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 

54
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,609
STATED THE RUSSIANS ARE ONCE 

55
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,043
AGAIN WAGING A CAMPAIGN TO 

56
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,012
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 

57
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,916
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES 

58
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,118
TO TAKE THE WORD OF RUSSIANS 

59
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:00,386
ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACING 

60
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:04,490
THEIR EXCUSES AND THE PRESIDENT 

61
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,126
GAVE A GREEN LIGHT TO CONTINUE 

62
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,696
TO ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY. 

63
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,599
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT SIDED 

64
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,469
WITH THE ENEMY, THE ENEMY WHO 

65
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,870
WAGED AN ASSAULT ON OUR 

66
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,272
DEMOCRACY. 

67
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,640
DISTURBINGLY IT APPEARS THAT 

68
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,108
HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE CHOSEN 

69
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,778
TO SIDE WITH THE ENEMY. 

70
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:26,779
ALL YEAR THE REPUBLICANS IN 

71
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:30,450
CONGRESS HAVE WASTED OUR TIME 

72
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,451
WITH WEEK WORDS AND SHAM 

73
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:31,718
HEARINGS. 

74
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,986
TODAY THEY ARE PUSHING TO 

75
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,686
ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR STATES TO 

76
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,956
PROTECT THEIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. 

77
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,424
WE WILL SPEAK TO THAT 

78
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,627
MOMENTARILY. 

79
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,861
DEMOCRATS ARE MOVING TO FORCE A 

80
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,863
VOTE TO RESTORE THE FUNDING TO 

81
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,265
HELPING STATES ENHANCE THEIR 

82
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,933
ELECTION EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER 

83
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,269
CYBER ATTACKS AND DEFEND AGAINST

84
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,703
FUTURE INTRUSIONS ON THE 

85
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,006
FINANCIAL SERVICES, THAT WILL 

86
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:53,806
HAPPEN WITH THE NATIONAL 

87
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,206
SERVICES BILL. 

88
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:57,243
WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THE 

89
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,579
INTEGRITY OF THE MUELLER 

90
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,548
INVESTIGATION. 

91
00:03:02,548 --> 00:03:04,217
OUR COLLEAGUES WILL SPEAK TO 

92
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:09,956
THAT AS WELL. 

93
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:10,723
-- PROPOSED AN INDEPENDENT 

94
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,125
COMMISSION TO REVIEW WHAT 

95
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,659
HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION 

96
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,597
AND FINDING OUT TO ENSURE THAT 

97
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,567
IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 

98
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,267
REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS HAVE 

99
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,670
RESISTED THAT CALL AS WELL. 

100
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,003
PERHAPS WITH THE DAMAGING, 

101
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,940
DISGRACEFUL, SO SAD PERFORMANCE 

102
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,575
OF THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY, THE 

103
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:31,778
REPUBLICANS WILL SEE THE LIGHT 

104
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,445
AND RESPOND TO SOME OF THE 

105
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,949
INITIATIVES THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE 

106
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,083
BEEN PUTTING FORTH FOR A WHILE 

107
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,917
NOW, WHILE HONORING AND 

108
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,754
RESPECTING THE CONFIDENCE OF 

109
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,156
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND 

110
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,259
THEIR ASSESSMENT THAT THE 

111
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,896
RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED IN THE 

112
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,567
DISRUPTION OF OUR ELECTION. 

113
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,201
WE WILL SEE. 

114
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,202
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY 

115
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,803
IS AT STAKE. 

116
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,405
WE MUST PROTECT IT AND ASSAULT 

117
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,275
ON OUR DEMOCRACY IS AN ASSAULT 

118
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:02,875
ON OUR COUNTRY. 

119
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,277
WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE TO 

120
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,511
PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 

121
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:10,183
WITH THAT I AM PLEASED TO YIELD

PERSON WHO HAS STOOD TALL AND 

125
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,124
STRONG AND SHOWED US A PATH ON 

126
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,559
HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER IN A 

127
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,594
BIPARTISAN WAY TO DO THAT, TO 

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,466
ROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 

129
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,501
>> I THINK YOU. 

130
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,338

ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE. 

135
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,482
WE HAVE GATHERED, THE CURRENT 

136
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,882

00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,954
EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR 

139
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,188
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 

140
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,390
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WHO WERE 

141
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,257
DENIGRATED BY THE PRESIDENT'S 

142
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,692
PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY, WHOSE 

143
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,929
WORK, DIFFICULT WORK, OFTEN 

144
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:57,764
LIFE RISKING WORK WAS 

145
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,998
UNDERMINED BY THE CHIEF 

146
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,000
EXECUTIVE OF THE COUNTRY WHO 

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,369
DISREGARDED THEIR CONCLUSIONS, 

148
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,039
WHO ESSENTIALLY SIDED WITH THE 

149
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,710
PERPETRATOR OF THE ELECTION 

150
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,711
INTERFERENCE RATHER THAN SIDE 

151
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,745
WITH HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 

152
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,379
AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 

153
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,816
WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE 

154
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,453
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE IC FOR 

155
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,087
DECADES AND DECADES. 

156
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,088
WE HAVE GREATEST RESPECT FOR 

157
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,089
THE WORK THAT THEY DO. 

158
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,426
TO SEE THAT THEIR WORK PRODUCT 

159
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,561
WOULD BE DISCARDED WAS 

160
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:33,299
SOMETHING THAT SHOCKED US ALL. 

161
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,100
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID 

162
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,936
YESTERDAY IN HELSINKI WENT 

163
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,737
BEYOND DISRESPECTING THE MEN 

164
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,039
AND WOMEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE 

165
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:40,339
COMMUNITY. 

166
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,774
IT WAS A WHOLESALE BETRAYAL OF 

167
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,644
THE VALUES AND INTERESTS OF 

168
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,978
THIS COUNTRY. 

169
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,481
RONALD RAGAN SAID HE DID NOT 

170
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:52,151
LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE 

171
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:52,952
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEFT HIM. 

172
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,188
HAD THERE BEEN ANY DEALT 

173
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

174
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,891
HAS LEFT RONALD REAGAN. 

175
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,092
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF HIS 

176
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:01,127
LEGACY IN THE GOP AS 

177
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,163
REPRESENTED BY THIS PRESIDENT. 

178
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,132
THIS PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY 

179
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:10,470
THAT AS BETWEEN THE WORD OF HIS 

180
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,271
OWN INTELLIGENCE DIRECT THEIR 

181
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,508
AND THE WORD OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, 

182
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,509
WHO STRONGLY ASSERTED THAT HE 

183
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,479
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

184
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,580
ELECTION HACKING, HE DID NOT 

185
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,449
KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE EXCEPT THAT 

186
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,850
HE CANNOT IMAGINE WHY THE 

187
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,022
RUSSIANS HAD DONE WHAT THEY 

188
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:30,556
DID. I 

189
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,591
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 

190
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,825
PRESIDENT COULD BE SO NACVE AS 

191
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,794
TO TAKE THE WORD OF THIS FORMER 

192
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:39,699
KGB OPERATIVE. 

193
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,733
I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT 

194
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,934
THINKS THIS IS IN HIS PERSONAL 

195
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,368
SELF INTEREST. 

196
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,372
HIS ONLY IDEOLOGY IS SELF. 

197
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,206
WHATEVER THE MOTIVATION THE 

198
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,041
RESULT IS CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL 

199
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,443
THAT WAS A DENIGRATION OF OUR 

200
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,713
COUNTRY, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, 

201
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:57,750
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, VALUES, 

202
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,184
VALUES, HE IS REALIGNING OUR 

203
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:02,021
COUNTRY NOT WITH FELLOW 

204
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,322
DEMOCRACIES BUT WITH FELLOW 

205
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,491
AUTOCRATS. 

206
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,726
AS MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE 

207
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,559
SERVED WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE 

208
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,928
COMMUNITY TO HELP STRENGTHEN 

209
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,030
DEMOCRACY AND INSTITUTIONS 

210
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,799
AROUND THE WORLD AND TO FIGHT 

211
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,268
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WHO WOULD 

212
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,869
UNDERMINE THE FREEDOM OF PEOPLE 

213
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,571
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WAS AN 

214
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,673
UNPRECEDENTED BETRAYAL. 

215
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,575
I AM PROUD TO JOIN WITH MY 

216
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,311
COLLEAGUES IN CONDEMNING WHAT 

217
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,413
WE SAW AND VOICING OUR STRONG

SUPPORT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN 

219
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,684
OF THE IC AND THE UNPARALLELED 

220
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:36,489
WORK PRODUCT THAT THEY PRODUCE. 

221
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,790
THANK YOU. 

222
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,860
IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO 

223
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,532
INTRODUCE MY PREDECESSOR A 

224
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,366
WONDERFUL FORMER RANKING MEMBER 

225
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,367
AND SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS MORE 

226
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,204
OF THE IC THAN JUST ABOUT 

227
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:52,605
ANYONE ELSE. 

228
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:53,005
THANK YOU. 

229
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,006
>>THANK YOU LEADER PELOSI FOR 

230
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,241
BRINGING US TOGETHER. 

231
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:59,445
I WANT TO REITERATE TO ALL OF 

232
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,747
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE STAND 

233
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,948
BEHIND THE INTELLIGENCE 

234
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,184
COMMUNITY. 

235
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,218
INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN ONE OF 

236
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:09,655
THE BEST DEFENSES AGAINST 

237
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,489
TERRORISM, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ALL 

238
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,124
OF THE ISSUES WE DEAL WITH. 

239
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,792
I REPRESENT AN ESSAY, IDEAL 

240
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:19,231
WITH CYBER SECURITY. 

241
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,266
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS FIRST 

242
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,701
ELECTED I SENT HIM A LETTER AND 

243
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,102
I SAID TO HIM AS PRESIDENT OF 

244
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,303
THE UNITED STATES YOU NEED TO 

245
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,504
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE THREAT 

246
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,741
OF CYBER ATTACKS. 

247
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,976
ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS 

248
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,677
THAT WE HAVE OTHER THAN NUCLEAR 

249
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,611
WEAPONS. 

250
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,246
I NEVER GOT A CALL BACK, IT WAS 

251
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,881
AS IF HE DID NOT CARE. 

252
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,750
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PUTIN 

253
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,318
SUGGESTION WITH OUR PRESIDENT 

254
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,753
ABOUT THE TASK FORCE. 

255
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,990
THIS TASK FORCE COMING TOGETHER 

256
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,259
WITH OUR COUNTRY IS AN ATTEMPT 

257
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,494
FOR RUSSIA TO BE RECOGNIZED AS 

258
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,930
AN EQUAL PEER IN CYBERSPACE, OF 

259
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,164
WHICH THEY ARE NOT. 

260
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,800
THE U. S. HAS NOTHING TO GAIN 

261
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,434
BY JOINTLY INVESTIGATING 

262
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,371
ANYTHING WITH RUSSIA OFFICIALS 

263
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,039
IN CYBERSPACE, UNLESS THE 

264
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,475
PRESIDENT BLUNTLY SHOWS THAT 

265
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,843
EVIDENCE THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL 

266
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,079
MUELLER PUT IN ENGLISH FOR HIM 

267
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,749
ON FRIDAY MUST BE ADDRESSED 

268
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:16,088
WITH PRUDENT. 

269
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,089
INDICTMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 

270
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:17,957
JUSTICE CLEARS OUT RUSSIA 

271
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:18,858
EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE 

272
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:19,592
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THIS 

273
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:19,859
COUNTRY. 

274
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,394
<font color="#FF0000"><u>T IS CLEAR THAT OUR </u></font>

275
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:21,894
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE 

276
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,362
YESTERDAY WHEN HE WAS IN 

277
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,630
PUTIN'S PALM THAT HE WAS 

278
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,265
UNABLE, HE IS UNABLE TO 

279
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:32,338
CONFRONT RUSSIA ON ANYTHING. 

280
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,339
THE TASK FORCE IS NOT 

281
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,373
NECESSARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

282
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,174
INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED IN 

283
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:35,374
2016. 

284
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,644
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 

285
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,946
A TASK FORCE WOULD ONLY BOLSTER 

286
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,880
THE GREEN LIGHT THAT OUR 

287
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,448
PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN PRUDENT BY 

288
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,316
GIVING THEM GREATER INSIGHT 

289
00:09:44,316 --> 00:09:47,787
INTO INVESTIGATIONS MINDSET. IF 

290
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,187
THEY WANT TO COLLABORATE AND 

291
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,823
SHOW THAT THEY WILL PROPERLY 

292
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,958
ACT WITH US GOING FORWARD SO-

293
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,929
CALLED CYBER NORMS, IT IS A 

294
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,763
CONVERSATION THAT THE STATE 

295
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,599
DEPARTMENT IS HAVING AND ONE 

296
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,200
STARTED IN PREVIOUS 

297
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,635
ADMINISTRATIONS AND THAT TRUMP 

298
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,203
SHOULD SUPPORT IT INSTEAD OF 

299
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,273
DENOUNCING IT. 

300
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,507
THIS IS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY AND 

301
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,909
THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED 

302
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,144
STATES OF AMERICA. 

303
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,145
WHEN YOU ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY 

304
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,147
WE MUST CALL YOU OUT ON A 

305
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,015
NATIONAL STAGE. 

306
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,683
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TERRY 

307
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:27,827
SOUL -- TERRY SCHOLL. 

308
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,061
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 

309
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,262
I AM HONORED TO STAND THERE 

310
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,297
WITH CURRENT AND FORMER MEMBERS 

311
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,130
OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. 

312
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,866
AS A PROUD REPRESENTATIVE OF 

313
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,168
SELMA ALABAMA. 

314
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,569
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE IS 

315
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,472
NOTHING MORE HEARTBREAKING TO ME

316
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,806
THAN A PRESIDENT WHO REFUSES TO 

317
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,041
STAND UP FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IN 

318
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,375
THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING 

319
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,077
EVIDENCE THAT OUR ELECTIONS 

320
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,714
WERE UNDER ATTACK. 

321
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,749
TWO YEARS AFTER WE FIRST 

322
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,383
LEARNED OF RUSSIA'S HACK ON THE 

323
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:55,020
DNC, WE NOW KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 

324
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,790
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA TARGETED OUR

325
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,226
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IT SELF 

326
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,760
AND HACKED COMPUTER NETWORKS 

327
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,794
CONTAINING VOTER INFORMATION. 

328
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:07,032
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA'S ACTORS 

329
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,300
POSTED MORE THAN 3000 

330
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,835
ADVERTISEMENTS ON FACEBOOK IN 

331
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,505
AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE OUR 

332
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:12,805
ELECTIONS. 

333
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,740
THEY WERE SO BOLD AS TO SPONSOR 

334
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,408
PAGES THAT WERE NAMED BLACK 

335
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,211
ACTIVISTS AND PAID FOR IT IN NO 

336
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,047
LESS THAN RUBLES. 

337
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,683
THEIR SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO SO 

338
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,920
SORTS OF DISCORD. 

339
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,354
SORTS OF DISCORD THROUGHOUT THE 

340
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:32,224
NATION. 

341
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,059
WE HAVE TO GUESS THAT THEY DID 

342
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,532
SO THAT THEY KNEW HAVING A 

343
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,366
COVERT INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN WOULD 

344
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,567
HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ELECTION. 

345
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,203
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA TARGETED 

346
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,204
MINORITY VOTERS IN AN ATTEMPT 

347
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:50,075
TO SOW DISCORD IN THE AMERICAN 

348
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:50,876
PUBLIC AND TO ENCOURAGE 

349
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,444
MINORITY VOTERS TO STAY AT 

350
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,512
HOME. 

351
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,947
YES RUSSIA'S ATTACK WAS NO LESS 

352
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:59,018
THE VOTER SUPPRESSION. 

353
00:11:59,018 --> 00:11:59,218
-- 

354
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,619
>> WE WANT TO TURN OUT TO 

355
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,321
SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE 

356
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:02,821
SPEAKING TO REPORTERS. 

357
00:12:02,821 --> 00:12:03,889
>>I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 

358
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,892
EUROPEANS TO KNOW OF THE SENATE 

359
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,995
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY FEELS ABOUT 

360
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,830
THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE 

361
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,097
PAINSTAKINGLY SET UP OVER 

362
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:14,499
DECADES, THAT HAVE WORKED TO 

363
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:20,339
MAINTAIN WORLD PEACE AND TO 

364
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,574
HAVE SOME PROCESS BY WHICH WE 

365
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,574
CAN ENTER INTO TRADE AGREEMENTS 

366
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:23,609
AND OTHER THINGS. 

367
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,210
I JUST THINK THAT IT WAS 

368
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,247
IMPORTANT FOR OUR FRIENDS AND 

369
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:35,888
ALLIES TO HEAR FROM US. 

370
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,759
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT BACK?

371
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,093
IF THIS WERE TO FORGE AHEAD 

372
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,164
THERE WOULD BE A SENATE TRIAL. 

373
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,565
>>I AM NOT GOING TO ADDRESS A

00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,199
HYPOTHETICAL LIKE THAT. 

375
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,400
I THINK IT IS FAR-FETCHED AND 

376
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,734
NOT WORTHY OF COMMENT. 

377
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:54,673
>>DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS 

378
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,710
TRUST -- WITH HOW THE PRESIDENT 

379
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,714
HAS APPROACHED RUSSIA?

383
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:15,628
FROM OTHERS AND YOU HAVE HEARD 

384
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,428
FROM OTHERS THIS MORNING

VIEWS ABOUT OUR FRIENDS AND 

387
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:22,133
ALLIES. I WANT THEM TO 

388
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:28,474
UNDERSTAND THAT IN THIS COUNTRY,

389
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,009
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 

390
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,844
BOTH PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT 

391
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,045
THESE ALLIANCES PAINSTAKINGLY 

392
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,113
BUILT IN THE WAKE OF WORLD WAR 

393
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:39,485
II ARE IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO 

394
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,788
MAINTAIN THEM. 

395
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,822
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT 

396
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,492
CONGRESS CAN OR WILL DO TO 

397
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,526
SUPPORT THESE ALLIANCES OR TO 

398
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,797
PUSH BACK ON RUSSIA, THE 

399
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,598
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON RUSSIA, 

400
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,599
OTHER THAN OFFERING WORDS OF 

401
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,366
SUPPORT X 

402
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,602
>> THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES. 

403
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,673
SENATOR RUBIO, FOR EXAMPLE, HE 

404
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,907
HAS A BILL THAT TARGETS THE 

405
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:02,908
2018 ELECTION, THE CYCLE THAT 

406
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,378
WE ARE IN NOW WITH AS I 

407
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,479
UNDERSTAND IT POTENTIAL 

408
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,414
PENALTIES IF THE RUSSIANS DO IT 

409
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:09,815
AGAIN. 

410
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,052
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE 

411
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,521
MAY WELL TAKE UP LEGISLATION. 

412
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,289
IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THAT 

413
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,191
THE RUSSIANS NEED TO KNOW THAT 

414
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,293
THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO FULLY 

415
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,228
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN 

416
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,764
2016 AND IT BETTER NOT HAPPEN 

417
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:34,373
AGAIN IN 2018. 

418
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,715

HELSINKI. 

422
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,785
WE ARE GOING BACK NOW TO THE

00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,620
SENATE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE ALSO 

424
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,721
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 

425
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,789
PERFORMANCE.

COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE EVIDENCE,

429
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,233
NOT ONLY OF RUSSIA'S 

430
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,067
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION, 

431
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,836
BUT ALSO THE ILLEGAL ANNEXATION 

432
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:09,475
OF CRIMEA AND THE INVASION OF 

433
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,176
THE UKRAINE. 

434
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,644
RUSSIAN ARMS TRANSFERS TO SYRIA 

435
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,414
AND RUSSIA'S ILLEGAL TRADE WITH 

436
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,314
NORTH KOREA. 

437
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,884
PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND. 

438
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:22,921
WE CAN'T TRUST HIM AND WE MUST 

439
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,489
NOT ALLOW THE SANCTIONS AGAINST 

440
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:28,260
PUTIN TO SLIP IN ANY WAY, SHAPE

441
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,296
, OR FORM. 

442
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,331
THE PRESIDENT MISSED THE 

443
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,132
OPPORTUNITY YESTERDAY TO STAND 

444
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,601
UP TO PUTIN AND TO STAND UP FOR 

445
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,004
AMERICA AND FOR OUR VALUES. 

446
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:41,239
HIS BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY WAS 

447
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:45,077
REPREHENSIBLE. 

448
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,512
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

449
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,148
STAND UP STRONG AGAINST PUTIN. 

450
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,782
KEEP THE SANCTIONS IN PLACE AND 

451
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,619
KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON OUR

00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,187
AMERICAN VALUES AND OUR 

453
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,855
AMERICAN FUTURE. 

454
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,458
NOW I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE AND 

455
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,859
ASKED TO COME TO THE PODIUM

459
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,465
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

460
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,101
THE RUSSIANS ATTACK ON OUR 

461
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,904
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THEY 

462
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,504
WILL BE BACK. 

463
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,773
THE TRUTH IS THEY NEVER LEFT. 

464
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,375
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IF WE 

465
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,409
ARE PREPARED, THE SHORT ANSWER 

466
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,211
IS WE ARE NOT. 

467
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,578

473
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,930
DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A PAPER TRAIL

474
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,964
. WHEN YOU ELECTRICALLY SCAN 

475
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,399
YOUR VOTE, THERE IS NO WAY TO 

476
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,036
AUDIT AFTER THE FACT WHAT IF 

477
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,437
ANYTHING WAS DONE TO THAT 

478
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,305
EQUIPMENT. 

479
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,073
WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY 

480
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:48,807
VULNERABLE.

00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,323
THAT THEY WERE HACKED. 

487
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,991

488
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,192
AND TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY KNOW 

489
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,026
IT HAS TAKEN PLACE. 

490
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:08,827
WE ARE THAT VULNERABLE.

506
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,059
BECAUSE WE TREASURE THE

REALIGNING OURSELVES WITH NOT 

555
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,731
DEMOCRACIES BUT AUTOCRATS. 

556
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,601
THAT IS A STRONG STATEMENT AND 

557
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,802
ONE WHICH PERHAPS THERE IS A 

558
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,770
BIT OF EVIDENCE FOR ESPECIALLY 

559
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,573
AFTER THE HELSINKI SUMMIT. 

560
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:44,983
>>I GUEST -- GUESS SOME COULD 

561
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,218
SAY THAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN 

562
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,019
INTERACTIONS WITH THE TURKISH 

563
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,020
PRIME MINISTER WHILE THEY WERE 

564
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,254
TOGETHER AT THE NATO SUMMIT AND 

565
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,088
HE WAS BEING COMPLEMENTARY 

566
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,723
ABOUT HOW HE RUNS THINGS IN 

567
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:55,394
TURKEY. A LOT OF THAT REMAINS 

568
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,595
IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. 

569
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,030
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HE 

570
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,466
DID THERE WAS MAKE THE POINT 

571
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,336
THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS 

572
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,204
MOVED ON FROM THE ERA OF RONALD 

573
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,740
REAGAN WHO WAS KNOWN FOR 

574
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,542
TALKING TOUGH AND TAKING ON THE 

575
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,977
SOVIET UNION. 

576
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:16,281
WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN NOT FROM 

577
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,582
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THESE LAST 

578
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,419
FEW DAYS WITH REGARDS TO RUSSIA.

579
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,521
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE FROM 

580
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,724
NOW AND NOVEMBER IS A DIS-

581
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,893
APPEAL OF REPUBLICANS WHO MAY 

582
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,094
BE DRIFTING UNCLEAR ON WHO THEY 

583
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,163
SHOULD BE SUPPORTING GIVEN WHAT 

584
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,764
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND THEY 

585
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,600
ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE WHAT THEY 

586
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,802
BELIEVE COULD BE A SEGMENT OF 

587
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,403
THE VOTING POPULATION, FRANKLY 

588
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:44,509
THEY MAY BE TRYING TO DRAW BACK 

589
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,310
DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED REPUBLICAN, 

590
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,145
ALLOTTED THAT IN 2016. 

591
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,180
REAGAN DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN A 

592
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,816
THING SINCE THE 80s AND I THINK 

593
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,817
THEY UNDERSTAND THERE MAY NOT 

594
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,487
BE A BIG OPENING GIVEN WHAT THE 

595
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,288
PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY AND 

596
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,289
GIVEN THAT THE COUNTRY AS 

597
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,123
PROCESSING WHAT EXACTLY WAS 

598
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,093
DONE IN FINLAND WHICH COULD 

599
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,429
CHANGE ON A DIME IN A SECOND 

600
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,464
WHENEVER WE SEE WHAT THE 

601
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,465
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY FOR 

602
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,134
HIMSELF AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 

603
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,335
THE MEETING THAT HE IS HAVING 

604
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,670
WITH REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF 

605
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,471
CONGRESS. 

606
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,771
>> LOOKING AT THE REPUBLICAN 

607
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,273
PARTY BEING HARD ON RUSSIA 

608
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,609
PREDATES RONALD REAGAN. 

609
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,643
THIS HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN 

610
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,644
POLICY SINCE THE COLD WAR. 

611
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:23,915
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MANY 

612
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:24,716
REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING AN 

613
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,617
IDENTITY CRISIS. 

614
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,987
>> CERTAINLY YOU LISTEN TO 

615
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,756
REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL AND YOU 

616
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,491
HAVE SOME WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY 

617
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:35,060
QUITE CONFLICTED BY WHAT HAS 

618
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,128
GONE ON. 

619
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,562
I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE A 

620
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,363
GOOD MEASURE OF IT. 

621
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,833
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE POLLING AND 

622
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,834
CONTINUE TO REPORT ACROSS THE 

623
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:48,907
COUNTRY AND GET A SENSE ON 

624
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:49,908
WHETHER OR NOT THIS RESONATED, 

625
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,343
WHETHER THIS WAS A BIG DEAL OR 

626
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,544
IF IT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT 

627
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,145
THE PRESIDENT SAYS. 

628
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:53,979
WHILE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE 

629
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,180
SPEAKING, WE SAW A LITTLE BIT 

630
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,415
OF MITCH McCONNELL, HE STARTED 

631
00:21:56,415 --> 00:22:01,086
HIS REMARKS BY REASSURING THE 

632
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,087
EUROPEAN ALLIES THAT THE UNITED 

633
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,121
STATES REMAINS AN ALLY OF 

634
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,423
THEIRS AND THAT RUSSIA IS NOT. 

635
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:07,626
JUST TELLING THAT WE CONTINUE 

636
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:13,098
TO HAVE TO SEE SENIOR 

637
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,132
CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS GO OUT OF 

638
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,133
THEIR WAY PUBLICLY TO REITERATE 

639
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,334
WHAT HAS BEEN LONG-STANDING U. 

640
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,769
S. POLICY AND THAT IS TO ALIGN 

641
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,536
OURSELVES MORE WITH EUROPEAN 

642
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:19,637
AND WESTERN POWERS. 

643
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,607
>>IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE 

644
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,678
MITCH McCONNELL ADDRESSING THAT 

645
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,311
BECAUSE EACH CONGRESSIONAL 

646
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,880
REPUBLICANS THERE HAS TO BE 

647
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,948
SOME RESPONSE WHICH THEY HAVE 

648
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,082
TO CRAFT CAREFULLY. 

649
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:34,786
>>WHAT, THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 

650
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,621
AS FAR AS JOHN McCAIN DID OR 

651
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,323
JEFF FLAKE, OR EVEN TO SOME 

652
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,160
EXTENT MITT ROMNEY IN THEIR 

653
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,427
COMMENTS. 

654
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,762
BUT THEY DO NEED TO REITERATE 

655
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,597
TO THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS, TO 

656
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,232
SKEPTICS AROUND THE WORLD THAT 

657
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,235
IN THEIR VIEW U. S. POLICY HAS 

658
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,871
NOT CHANGED AND THEY ARE NOT IN 

659
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,506
AGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT 

660
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,274
WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING AND 

661
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,777
SAYING. 

662
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,412
>> DO YOU THINK THE SENATE HAS 

663
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,212
AN APPETITE TO INCREASE 

664
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,447
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA? 

665
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,248
>>IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 

666
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,519
McCONNELL WAS ASKED THAT. 

667
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,820
HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO 

668
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,754
LEGISLATION PERHAPS THERE IS A 

669
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,823
WAY TO WARN RUSSIA THAT THEY 

670
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,961
WILL BE PUNISHED YET AGAIN OR 

671
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:16,694
THERE WOULD BE NEW SANCTIONS. 

672
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:17,696
SHOULD THERE BE EVIDENCE THAT 

673
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,030
THEY MINGLED OR MEDDLED, 

674
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,367
COLLUDED, TRY TO DISRUPT THE 

675
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,003
2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

676
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,137
THAT POTENTIAL LEGISLATION 

677
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:29,641
WOULD COME AS BOTH LAWMAKERS 

678
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,475
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS HAVE 

679
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,512
SAID THAT RUSSIA IS INDEED 

680
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,147
DOING THINGS SIMILAR THAN THEY 

681
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,583
DID IN 2016. 

682
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,218
IF ANYTHING IT MIGHT STAVE OFF 

683
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,619
FURTHER REACTION BY RUSSIA BUT 

684
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,190
IT WOULD BRING A STRONG RESPONSE

685
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,724
FROM CONGRESS. 

686
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,559
THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE CONCRETE 

687
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,994
PLAN TO DO ANYTHING YET, 

688
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:53,031
NOTHING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED, AND 

689
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:53,865
YET TELLING THAT REPUBLICAN 

690
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,301
LEADERS IN BOTH CHAMBERS HAVE 

691
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,102
NOT RULED IT OUT. 

692
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,104
>> IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO 

693
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,405
SEE AT THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE 

694
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,339
IS TO THIS CRITICISM WHEN HE 

695
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,741
HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BEFORE FOR 

696
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:06,444
BEING WEAK ON RUSSIA, HE CAME 

697
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,712
OUT WITH SANCTIONS AGAINST 

698
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,080
RUSSIA. 

699
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,782
SOMETIMES HE RESPONSE TO 

700
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,816
CRITICISM BY ACTUALLY DOING 

701
00:24:11,816 --> 00:24:12,517
SOMETHING. 

702
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,919
>>RIGHT. 

703
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,188
OR SOMETIMES BY DOUBLING DOWN. 

704
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,189
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. 

705
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:21,459
WE ARE HEARING GUIDANCE THAT HE 

706
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,494
HAS BEGUN SPEAKING TO REPORTERS 

707
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,528
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

708
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,930
THE WAY THIS WORKS IS WE WILL 

709
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,134
NOT SEE IT UNTIL THE TAPE IS úA 

710
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:34,639
OF US. HE IS IN A PREVIOUSLY 

711
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,473
SCHEDULED MEETING WITH A 

712
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,474
HANDFUL OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO 

713
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,509
DISCUSS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

714
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,745
CALLS TAX REFORM 2.0 AND 

715
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:41,746
GUIDANCE CAME FROM THE WHITE 

716
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,982
HOUSE PRESS OFFERINGS -- PRESS 

717
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,252
OFFICE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT 

718
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,886
HE WAS GOING TO ADDRESS THE 

719
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:53,792
PRESS FOR WHAT HE SAID ENDED 

720
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,392
YESTERDAY IN FINLAND. 

721
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,594
THAT SEEMS TO BE A SWIFT 

722
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,262
RESPONSE FROM HIM AND THE WHITE 

723
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,663
HOUSE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN 

724
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,664
CRITICAL REACTION TO WHAT HE 

725
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,300
SAID IN FINLAND. 

726
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,735
WHAT HE IS SAYING WE DO NOT 

727
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,903
KNOW BUT WE DO HAVE GUIDANCE 

728
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,137
FROM REPORTERS IN THE ROOM THAT 

729
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,138
HE IS SPEAKING. 

730
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:10,008
WHY CAN'T WE SEE IT LIVE? THAT 

731
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,810
IS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS, THEY 

732
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:18,316
CAN'T NECESSARILY RUN A POWER 

733
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,751
CORD ALL THE WAY INTO THE ROOM 

734
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,720
WHEREVER HE IS AND OUT TO THE 

735
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,623
SATELLITE DISHES. 

736
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,857

OUT OF THIS THAT HE ACCEPTS THE 

922
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,545
FINDINGS OF THE U. S. 

923
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,612
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH HE 

924
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:43,947
FAILED TO DO YESTERDAY WHEN THE 

925
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:44,447
WORLD WAS WATCHING. 

926
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:48,085
WHETHER THIS WILL RESONATE 

927
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,120
WIDELY REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 

928
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,121
CLEARLY HE UNDERSTANDS NOW IF 

929
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,556
YOU DID NOT ALREADY THAT IT WAS 

930
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,225
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO SAY. 

931
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,458
HE IS MEETING WITH A COLLECTION 

932
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,092
OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS. 

933
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:57,094
THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO TALK 

934
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:59,096
ABOUT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 

935
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:02,967
BILLED AS CATCH REFORM 244. 

936
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,402
KEVIN BRADY WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN 

937
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,870
OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS 

938
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,803
COMMITTEE, OBVIOUSLY THE 

939
00:35:06,803 --> 00:35:11,042
PRESIDENT WAS EAGER TO FIGHT IN 

940
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,076
REPORTERS TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE 

941
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,911
THAT HAS DOMINATED CONVERSATION 

942
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,345
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE HE 

943
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:18,583
RETURNED AND THAT IS WHAT HE 

944
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,117
DID AND SAID IN HELSINKI 

945
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,219
YESTERDAY. 

946
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,420
HE IS REITERATING NOW ON CAMERA 

947
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,654
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS 

948
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,022
TWEETING ABOUT YESTERDAY AND 

949
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,793
LAST EVENING DON'T FORGET WHAT 

950
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,294
WE DID AT NATO, DON'T FORGET I 

951
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,163
MET WITH THE QUEEN, IN MY VIEW 

952
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,198
HE SAYS RUSSIA, THE MEETING 

953
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,467
WITH RUSSIA WAS THE MOST 

954
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,702
IMPORTANT PART AND HE THINKS IT 

955
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:41,739
WENT WELL AND BY THE WAY I 

956
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,940
ACCEPT THE FINDINGS OF THE U. 

957
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,976
S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 

958
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,210
WHETHER HE WILL DO MORE ABOUT 

959
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,012
IT BECAUSE HE ACCEPTS IT 

960
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,046
REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 

961
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,047
THAT IS WHY YOU SAW THERE 

962
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,181
EARLIER CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS 

963
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:55,519
ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS 

964
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,354
THEORY, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 

965
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,988
TO BE FORTHCOMING ON WHAT WAS 

966
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:02,260
SAID AND WHAT MORE IS THERE TO 

967
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,361
KNOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND 

968
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,862
HIS POTENTIAL AS THEY CONTINUE 

969
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,164
TO ALLEGE, RELATIONSHIP WITH 

970
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:10,301
EITHER PRESIDENT PUTIN OR 

971
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:10,701
RUSSIA GENERALLY. 

972
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,836
CALLS TO RELEASE HIS TAX 

973
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,872
RETURNS, THAT IS HARKENING BACK 

974
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,874
TO TWO SUMMERS AGO WHEN 

975
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:17,675
DEMOCRATS INSISTED AND HE 

976
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,111
REFUSED TO GO I EXPECT MOST OF 

977
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,345
THOSE DEMANDS WILL FALL ON DEAF 

978
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,846
EARS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

979
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:25,615
>>CALLS FOR HIS TAX RETURNS AND 

980
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,853
CALLS TO DEMAND THE EXTRADITION 

981
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,554
OF THE 12 RUSSIANS INDICTED. 

982
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,690
>> IT IS NOT CLEAR IF HE DID 

983
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,157
THAT YESTERDAY. 

984
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,991
HE STOPPED AT THE POINT THAT HE 

985
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:37,561
SAID I BROUGHT IT UP, PUTIN 

986
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:41,499
DENIED IT. 

987
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,700
IT WASN'T CLEAR IF HE OR 

988
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,501
SECRETARY POMPEO OR ANYBODY 

989
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,703
ELSE RAISE THAT ISSUE. 

990
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,937
IT CAME UP IN THE INTERVIEW 

991
00:36:46,937 --> 00:36:48,139
WITH CHRIS WALLACE ON FOX NEWS 

992
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,573
AND PUTIN SAID I DON'T SEE A 

993
00:36:49,573 --> 00:36:52,410
NEED TO DO IT I WOULD RATHER 

994
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,644
SEE U. S. AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS 

995
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,046
WORKING TOGETHER ON JOINT 

996
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:55,413
INVESTIGATIONS. 

997
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:58,716
THE IDEA OF -- DOES NOT APPEAR 

998
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,552
TO BE BREACHED QUITE SERIOUSLY. 

999
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,423
>> I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, 

1000
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,092
ACCORDING TO REUTERS, TRUMP 

1001
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,727
MEANT TO SAY IN HELSINKI THAT 

1002
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,364
HE SAW NO REASON WHY IT WOULD 

1003
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,799
NOT BE RUSSIA THAT INTERFERED 

1004
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:15,566
IN ELECTIONS. 

1005
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:22,473
>> YES. HE SAYS HERE ALSO, MY 

1006
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:25,743
ADMINISTRATION WILL STOP AND 

1007
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,311
REPEL ANY EFFORTS TO INTERFERE 

1008
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,014
IN ELECTIONS. 

1009
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,215
HE IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY WILL 

1010
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,016
TRY TO DO MORE. 

1011
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,951
WHAT CAN BE DONE AND HOW QUICKLY

1012
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:34,885
WITH THE ELECTIONS FAST 

1013
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:35,486
APPROACHING IS UNCLEAR. 

1014
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:36,854
>> AS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE 

1015
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,791
POINTED OUT THERE ARE SO MANY 

1016
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,792
STATE ELECTION SYSTEMS THAT ARE 

1017
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,627
SO VULNERABLE, SO ANTIQUATED, 

1018
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,429
ARE THERE EFFORTS BEING MADE TO 

1019
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:45,863
UPDATE THESE? 

1020
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:46,897
WHAT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

1021
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,734
DOING AT THIS POINT? 

1022
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,302
>> GIVEN THAT THE INTELLIGENCE 

1023
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,370
COMMITTEE KNOWS OR SAYS THERE 

1024
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,407
ARE ATTEMPTS UNDERWAY WE CAN 

1025
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,208
SURMISE THEY ARE DOING 

1026
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,442
SOMETHING BUT WE DO NOT KNOW 

1027
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,709
WHAT THAT IS. 

1028
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:00,878
IT IS BECAUSE THE U. S. 

1029
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:01,979
ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE SO 

1030
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:02,346
DECENTRALIZED. 

1031
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,114
DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS, 

1032
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,351
COUNTIES, STATES THEY ALL VOTE 

1033
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:07,684
DIFFERENTLY. 

1034
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:09,186
IT IS HARD TO POLICE A MONITOR 

1035
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:09,386
THAT. 

1036
00:38:09,386 --> 00:38:11,355
IT MAY NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL AFTER 

1037
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,491
THE FACT. 

1038
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,291
IF THE WARNINGS FROM 

1039
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,693
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE TO 

1040
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,196
BE BELIEVED IT IS HAPPENING 

1041
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:19,429
AGAIN. 

1042
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:20,598
IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER 

1043
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,632
STATE OFFICIALS ARE CATCHING IT 

1044
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,067
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO STOP 

1045
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:23,233
IT. 

1046
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:24,602
THERE HAVE BEEN BIPARTISAN 

1047
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,670
PROPOSALS TO SPEND A LOT OF 

1048
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,905
MONEY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO 

1049
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:32,543
HELP THE STATES KEEP AN EYE ON 

1050
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,245
THIS AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP 

1051
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,213
IT. 

1052
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,214
THAT MONEY HAS NOT STARTED 

1053
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:37,614
TRICKLING DOWN. 

1054
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,016
HOMELAND SECURITY HAS BEEN 

1055
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,885
HOLDING MEETINGS WITH 

1056
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:41,886
SECRETARIES OF STATE AND OTHER 

1057
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,487
OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 

1058
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:48,626
I RECALL HEARING FROM SOME 

1059
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,427
STATE OFFICIALS SAYING THAT 

1060
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,461
THEY HAVE NOT GONE CLEAR 

1061
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,695
GUIDANCE ON WHAT THEY SHOULD BE 

1062
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:52,897
LOOKING FOR OR WHAT THEY SHOULD 

1063
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:53,931
BE DOING IN ORDER TO 

1064
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,231
POTENTIALLY STOP NEW THREATS. 

1065
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:58,402
>>IT ALL SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT 

1066
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,202
OF THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS 

1067
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:00,571
SEEMS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK 

1068
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,806
BACK THE OPTICS. 

1069
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,974
WILL DEMOCRATS BY THAT? 

1070
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,077
>> NO. I DON'T THINK THEY WELL. 

1071
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:12,383
NOTHING SHORT OF DOING THE FOUR 

1072
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,384
THINGS THAT THEY ARE CALLING 

1073
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,418
FOR WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO 

1074
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,456
HAPPEN WILL PLEASE THEM. 

1075
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,090
IF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 

1076
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,324
COME TO THE CAPITAL EARLY NEXT 

1077
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,159
WEEK TO EXPLAIN WHAT WENT ON 

1078
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,360
AND SHARE MORE LIGHT ON WHAT 

1079
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,929
HAPPENED AT LEAST THEY WILL 

1080
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,630
HAVE THAT, AT LEAST A CHANCE TO 

1081
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,667
PUBLICLY SCOLD THE OFFICIALS 

1082
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,701
FOR LETTING THE PRESIDENT HAVE 

1083
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,702
<u> PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE </u>

1084
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,303
RUSSIA LEADER. 

1085
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:32,903
>>WHAT ABOUT REPUBLICANS? 

1086
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,672
THE ONES WHO WERE CRITICAL OF 

1087
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:42,646
THE PRESIDENT? 

1088
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,848
>> I AM SURE SOME WELL. 

1089
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:45,282
THE FACT THAT YOU GOT TO SEE 

1090
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,283
THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND THE 

1091
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,318
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER GO OUT 

1092
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,319
AND REITERATE THAT THEY BELIEVE 

1093
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,520
WESTERN POWERS WESTERN 

1094
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,354
COUNTRIES, EUROPE IS MORE OF AN 

1095
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,355
ALLY THAN RUSSIA THAT SHOULD 

1096
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:56,260
TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO 

1097
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,493
KNOW. 

1098
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:57,895
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT 

1099
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,129
BUT THEY FELT THE NEED TODAY. 

1100
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:00,764
>>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

1101
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:05,002
INSIGHT. 

1102
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,403
>> WE HAVE ZEKE MILLER ON THE 

1103
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,172
PHONE NOW HE IS A CORRESPONDENT 

1104
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,840
FOR --. 

1105
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,276
IT SEEMS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

1106
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,545
SAYING YOU HEARD ME WRONG, I 

1107
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,515
MEANT TO SAY THAT I SAW NO 

1108
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,618
REASON WHY IT WOULD NOT BE 

1109
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,052
RUSSIA THAT INTERFERED IN THE 

1110
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:27,758
ELECTIONS. 

1111
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,993
NO ONE HEARD ME CORRECTLY, THE 

1112
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,426
MEDIA MISREPORTED. 

1113
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:30,594
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE 

1114
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:30,961
UNDERSTANDING? 

1115
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,029
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTED 

1116
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,666
TO CLARIFY THAT HE MEANT TO SAY 

1117
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,101
THAT I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY 

1118
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,805
IT WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA --, THAT 

1119
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:45,409
BEING THE PRESIDENT BOWING TO 

1120
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,845
THIS MASSIVE OUTCRY FROM 

1121
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,682
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 

1122
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:54,951
ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH THE 

1123
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:59,022
PRESIDENT DOUBTING THE U. S. 

1124
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:05,329
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES -- AND 

1125
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,363
MISSPOKE WHEN HE WAS WITH 

1126
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:06,963
VLADIMIR PUTIN YESTERDAY. 

1127
00:41:06,963 --> 00:41:09,199
THAT IS A STRIKING STEP DOWN 

1128
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,434
WHERE HE IS SO UNWILLING AND 

1129
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,068
PUBLIC TO ADMIT THAT ERROR AND 

1130
00:41:12,068 --> 00:41:17,508
HERE HE IS ADMITTING ERROR. 

1131
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,509
>>HE IS ALSO PUTTING HIS 

1132
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,342
SUPPORT BEHIND THE INTELLIGENCE 

1133
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:20,144
COMMITTEE OR AT LEAST 

1134
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,345
EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE 

1135
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:25,616
U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 

1136
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,250
>> THAT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS 

1137
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,287
WELL AND WE SHOULD GET THE 

1138
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,122
AUDIO AND VIDEO HERE IN A FEW 

1139
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:32,389
SECONDS. 

1140
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,124
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THAT HE 

1141
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,227
HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE LEADERS 

1142
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:38,028
OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 

1143
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:42,666
THAT HE PUT IN PLACE -- STILL 

1144
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:48,305
THAT -- ALSO BY THE PRESIDENT 

1145
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,373
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FOR 

1146
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:55,079
HIM TO MAKE THAT CLAIM NOW -- 

1147
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:55,879
IT IS ALSO FRUSTRATION 

1148
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:57,114
INTERNALLY THAT HE IS 

1149
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:57,915
UNDERCUTTING MORALE OF THE 

1150
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,383
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM. 

1151
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,385
>>HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING A 

1152
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,219
LITTLE BIT INTERESTING. 

1153
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,888
HE SAID THAT U. S., RUSSIA 

1154
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:07,024
RELATIONSHIP HAS GOTTEN 

1155
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,961
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER. THAT IS 

1156
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:11,962
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

1157
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,197
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH. 

1158
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,231
>> THERE IS REALLY NOT A LOT OF 

1159
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:16,633
EVIDENCE, THE PRESIDENT IS 

1160
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:21,271
EXPLAINING THAT ONE-ON-ONE 

1161
00:42:21,271 --> 00:42:25,075
MEETING THEY DISCUSSED IRAN AND 

1162
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:33,651
KOREA -- WE HAVE NOT NOTICED 

1163
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,486
EVIDENCE OF WARMING OF TIES. AT 

1164
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:40,824
THE SAME TIME -- NO LIFTING OF 

1165
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:45,062
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA THAT IS AN 

1166
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,497
OPTION THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS 

1167
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:51,168
BEEN PUSHING FOR FOR YEARS. 

1168
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,403
>> HE ALSO SAID APPARENTLY THAT 

1169
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,170
HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MOVE 

1170
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,173
AGGRESSIVELY TO REPEL EFFORTS 

1171
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,809
TO INTERFERE IN THE 2018 

1172
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,112
ELECTION BUT THERE WAS NO 

1173
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,313
DETAILS ON WHAT THE MOVES MIGHT 

1174
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,181
LOOK LIKE. 

1175
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,017
>>NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DETAILS 

1176
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,185
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS IN 

1177
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,954
MIND OR HOW HE INTENDS TO PUSH 

1178
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:16,860
BACK AGAINST -- THE RUSSIAN 

1179
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:22,633
GOVERNMENT -- TO GO ABOUT IN 

1180
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,267
THE 2018 ELECTION. 

1181
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,668
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF 

1182
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:30,140
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS -- 

1183
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,009
>>DO YOU THINK WHAT HE HAS SAID 

1184
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,210
TODAY WILL UNDO SOME OF THE 

1185
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,248
DAMAGE? 

1186
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:39,483
CERTAINLY NOT IN THE EYES OF 

1187
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,484
DEMOCRATS, WILL IT AT LEAST 

1188
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,484
APPEASE REPUBLICANS? 

1189
00:43:41,484 --> 00:43:45,623
>> THIS CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS

1190
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,658
AND REPUBLICANS THE WAY THE 

1191
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:50,493
PRESIDENT -- AND MAKING AND 

1192
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:53,931
ERROR AND ADMITTING THAT HE 

1193
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:56,767
MADE AN ERROR LIKE THIS, THERE 

1194
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,703
WILL BE LASTING DAMAGE WITH THAT

1195
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,004
AND HE WILL FACE CRITICISM FOR 

1196
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:04,074
THAT FOR A LONG TIME. 

1197
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,075
IN TERMS OF THE ACUPRESSURE 

1198
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,276
THAT WAS ON HIM EARLIER THIS 

1199
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,311
MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON HE 

1200
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,712
APPEARS TO BE DOUBLING DOWN ON 

1201
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,515
HIS COMMENTS YESTERDAY. SOME OF 

1202
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,851
THAT WILL EASE IN THE COMING 

1203
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:17,254
DAYS AND HOURS BUT THERE WILL 

1204
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,289
BE QUESTIONS AND CRITICISM FOR 

1205
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,291
YEARS OVER YESTERDAY. 

1206
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:25,028
>> ACCORDING TO NOTES COMING 

1207
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:26,230
OUT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 

1208
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,900
TODAY HE APPARENTLY SPOKE A 

1209
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,101
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HE AND 

1210
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,336
PRESIDENT PUTIN DISCUSSED IN 

1211
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:32,603
PRIVATE. 

1212
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,004
HE SAID THEY DISCUSSED ISRAELI 

1213
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,306
SECURITY, THEY DISCUSSED IRAN 

1214
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,374
NUCLEAR AMBITIONS, THEY 

1215
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,811
DISCUSSED NORTH KOREA, ANY 

1216
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:44,214
OTHER DETAILS COMING TO LIGHT? 

1217
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:48,485
>> JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

1218
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:54,858
NORTH KOREA THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 

1219
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,093
WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE U. S. 

1220
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,494
EFFORTS TO TRY TO DO NUCLEAR AS 

1221
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:57,927
THE PENINSULA. 

1222
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,329
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SPECIFICS OF 

1223
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,400
WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED. 

1224
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,968
WE DISCUSSED THIS AND WE 

1225
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:12,042
DISCUSSED THAT, -- DESCRIBING 

1226
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:23,887
THE PRESIDENT -- IN CRIMEA. 

1227
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,122
HERE THE PRESIDENT IS A DAY 

1228
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,592
LATE ON TIGHT TO PUT HIS SPIN. 

1229
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,993
>>WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT THE 

1230
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,028
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO 

1231
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:31,261
TODAY? 

1232
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,229
HE USUALLY STANDS HIS GROUND 

1233
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,297
AND DOUBLE DOWN IN THE FACE OF 

1234
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:37,934
CRITICISM IN THE SHORT-TERM, 

1235
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,169
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS OF HIS 

1236
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,704
RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISM HE 

1237
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:41,772
HAS RECEIVED? 

1238
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:42,973
>> THIS IS CERTAINLY A DAY 

1239
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,173
LATE. 

1240
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:47,244
THE QUESTION IS WILL THIS BE A 

1241
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:47,644
DOLLAR SHORT? 

1242
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,880
WILL THIS BE ENOUGH TO QUELL 

1243
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:58,422
THE CRITICISM HE HAS FACED -- 

1244
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,692
AND THIS IS A RARE ADMISSION OF 

1245
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,726
ERROR BY THIS PRESIDENT WHO SO 

1246
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:07,998
OFTEN IN THE PLAYBOOK -- HE HAS 

1247
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:13,637
GONE BACK AND DOUBLED DOWN -- 

1248
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,305
HOW GLARING THE AIR HE MADE 

1249
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,307
YESTERDAY WAS. 

1250
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,811
THIS IS A STRIKING MOMENT BY THE

1251
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:21,111
PRESIDENT. 

1252
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,615
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE 

1253
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,649
ALSO ADDRESSED HIS MEETING WITH 

1254
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,485
THE QUEEN, ANOTHER MEETING THAT 

1255
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,487
HE SAID IS A TERRIFIC PERSON, 

1256
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,224
VERY INSPIRING. 

1257
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,425
HE TALKED ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS 

1258
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:36,793
WELL NOT JUST HELSINKI. 

1259
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,695
>> YES. 

1260
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,097
HE TRIED TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN 

1261
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,732
ON THE TRIP. 

1262
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,167
THERE IS STILL CRITICISM ABOUT 

1263
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:49,606
THE NATO ALLIES AND THE WAY HE 

1264
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:54,111
TREATED PRIME MINISTER MAY. 

1265
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:58,181
EVEN AS HE WAS WALKING BACK THE 

1266
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:01,218
RUSSIAN MEETING IN HELSINKI 

1267
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:02,419
THAT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT 

1268
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,220
PART HE STILL TRY TO MAKE A 

1269
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,055
POSITIVE. 

1270
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:09,159
>> WE STILL HAVE ED O'KEEFE 

1271
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:09,559
WITH US. 

1272
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:15,032
ED I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK IN, 

1273
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,266
THE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT HE 

1274
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,501
HAS FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT IN 

1275
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,534
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES 

1276
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:19,703
BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA'S 

1277
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,104
ACTIONS HAD NO IMPACT, LET ME 

1278
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:21,505
BE CLEAR. 

1279
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,975
HE SEEMS TO WANT TO MAKE SURE 

1280
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,510
