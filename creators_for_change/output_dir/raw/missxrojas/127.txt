don't give a I feel like this has

22
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:44,910
been a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity for us to</font>

23
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,010
talk about our weird relationship to the

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,230
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes for better sometimes</font>

25
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're worth I've been wanting to talk</font>

30
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,859
because I have these stretch marks under

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,750
here from when I gained and lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

even<font color="#CCCCCC"> really see them but you they go</font>

34
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,450
from day to day sometimes horrifying me

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes just thrilling me like I</font>

36

<font color="#CCCCCC">love having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them as such it kind of like</font>

37
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,060
a like the print of a dinosaur skin in

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,000
some ways which I know should it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,369
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a traditional beauty standards</font>

40
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,750
but I think it's cool I think I'll

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,159
bodies are so cool our bodies are like a

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,200
history of our existence of our

43
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,869
struggles and of our strengths<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

44
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,189
more I think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the more I</font>

grow to love my body it's exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,670
me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very exciting growing up for me</font>

47
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">so far has been creating this new</font>

48
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,030
relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my body I thought I'd</font>

49
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">be stuck in one place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long time</font>

50
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,270
that no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how hard I tried or how</font>

51
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,220
many different things I tried I would be

52
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,869
stuck in the situation of literally just

53
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,079
hating a huge part of myself all of my

54
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,869
physical self really and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font>

55
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">been the case because for one I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

56
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,159
able and privileged enough to have the

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,930
support system to take the steps that I

58
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,270
need but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've also just been granted</font>

59
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,040
this new perspective on things which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

60
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,409
really wonderful it's yeah I do know I'm

61
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,939
proud of myself I state but time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat</font>

62
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,149
brunch

63
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,840
of course having made such a big

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,399
dramatic deal about how this dress

65
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,049
wasn't flattering it looks great

66
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,369
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a friendship group</font>

you

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,870
you

102
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,219
I don't have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good sense of what</font>

103
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:37,899
you can see and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can tell what</font>

104
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't but what you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

105
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:42,189
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell but okay probably not and</font>

106
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,289
is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I thought really</font>

107
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">emotional during they actually liked an</font>

108
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:49,179
extent that I feel very emotional right

109
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:51,039
now I love Christmas when I was young we

110
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,860
tried it<font color="#CCCCCC"> were possible to mix up the</font>

111
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,689
Mexican side in the English side and

112
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:59,229
like you know we'd have a very English

113
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,839
traditional Christmas dinner but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even we</font>

114
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,669
try and do things like the pinata and

115
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,299
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> jelena there posada and the</font>

116
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,009
night before even if it was just in like

117
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,409
a small silly way and you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

118
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">still do that and there's another</font>

119
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,259
generation now with with my sister's

120
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:18,369
kids and and yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're had we're</font>

121
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,619
excited about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and we we do it</font>

122
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,649
all but it's just I don't know sometimes

123
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,659
just like sometimes it's just really

124
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,389
obvious who isn't here and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

125
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in a sense of like my friends are</font>

126
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,089
very not being here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like the fact</font>

127
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:35,409
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing this with my dad</font>

128
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:39,579
sorry what is he knew this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have apple</font>

129
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,629
cider I've gathered it's just very sad

130
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:47,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very sad and grief is</font>

131
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,939
what's the word no ambivalent not

132
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,659
ambiguous a pathetic not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

care when it comes doesn't care whether

134
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,469
you're feeling great doesn't care

135
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,269
whether you feeling terrible it just

136
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,419
visits and sometimes visits when you're

137
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting up your lovely Christmas tree</font>

138
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past four and a half years I</font>

139
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,559
have found that journey from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US the</font>

140
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,539
UK always incredibly difficult so there

141
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,699
might be some dread within me because of

142
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,619
that purely because I got on a plane to

143
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK to the US my dad was alive I got</font>

145
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,769
dad was dead so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some like</font>

146
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,360
magical thinking still at work there

147
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,119
there is something that it's maybe this

148
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,110
time it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like when you re watching</font>

149
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,809
Titanic's like maybe this time jack will

150
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:30,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the door and be alive</font>

151
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those poor children and parents</font>

152
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,159
and people on the Titanic won't die I

153
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,409
went like it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

154
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,089
I hate Christmas adverts Christmas

155
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,610
adverts are probably the devil no<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

156
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,659
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know i just find it difficult</font>

157
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,399
