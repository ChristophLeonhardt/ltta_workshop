hi I just want to post up a video
because something very bizarre happened
to me this elbow and you know when
things happen and they just blow you
away well that happened to me today
basically I don't know if you guys have
watched any of my earlier videos that I
talked about how I used to be a really
big dog used to be still am one video
room so in Prior was close to get beaten
up all the time and today I bumped into
one of the guys he used to beat me up
and it was so odd they went to a few
primary schools I I've spoken about this
before but the first prime is 4 I went
to the kids were nuts like didn't have
parents usually teach you don't stab the
person next to you
yep these kids weren't taught that and
there was this particular guy he used to
do it to me all the time with scissors
or or whatever we were using he just
stabbed me and um you know it was just
nuts and eventually I asked to be moved
away for him but he got kind of shitty
at that so he used to come back after
school and beat me up I did Abby to tell
it my side I need me to get you trouble
like I didn't really get you in trouble
I just so did like the stabbing don't
guys I was kind of like I'll take this
guy eventually when I'm older I'll say
him in the newspaper because you know he
had killed someone or something and so
instead of seeing him on the news I see
him today on a train
um yeah you do I make you used to beat
up all the time you psychopath
