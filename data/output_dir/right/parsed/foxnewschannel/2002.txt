TIMES AS MANY ACCORDING TO OUR
CALCULATIONS AS LAST YEAR.
THE CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS THE
REVIEW SHOULD BE COMPLETE IN
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.
NEW REACTION COMING IN AROUND
THE WORLD AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP
SET THE UNITED STATES IS PULLING
OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
RICH EDSON IS TRACKING OF
ELEMENTS FROM THE
STATE DEPARTMENT.
IT SOUNDS, RICH, FROM THE LATEST
DISPATCHES FROM TEHRAN THAT THE
IRANIANS ARE TAKING A HARD LINE
ON THIS.
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE AND THE
SPECIFIC FALLOUT IS HOW THE
UNITED STATES WILL BE
RE-IMPOSING SANCTIONS AND WHO
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO
SANCTION AS A RESULT OF ALL
THIS.
WE ARE STILL WORKING ALL THAT
OUT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
FOR THE GENERAL RULE, THE
COUNTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THE
IRAN-NUCLEAR DEAL, THEY WANT THE
UNITED STATES TO STAY IN US.
THEY WERE NEGOTIATING AND THAT
THEY JUST RELEASED A STATEMENT
CALLED E3.
AFTER ENGAGING WITH THE U.S.
ADMINISTRATION AND A THOROUGH
MANNER IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
WE CALL ON THE U.S. TO DO
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE
THE GAINS FOR NONNUCLEAR
PROLIFERATION BACK ALLOWING
CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT OF ITS
MAIN ELEMENT.
THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR.
THE OTHER TWO COUNTRIES THAT ARE
PART OF THIS, CHINA AND RUSSIA,
THEY ARE PUSHING THE U.S. TO
STAY IN AND THEY ARE NOW TALKING
AND EXPRESSING THE SAME
DISAPPOINTMENT.
THE GULF COUNTRIES INCLUDING
ISRAEL AND SAUDI ARABIA, FOR
EXAMPLE, THEY NEVER LIKED THIS
DEAL AND WANT OF THE U.S. OUT OF
IT.
THE SAUDIS ARE SAYING THEY
SUPPORT THE U.S. DECISION AS
WELL AS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.
>> ISRAEL FULLY SUPPORTS
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BOLD DECISION
TO REJECT THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH
THE TERRORISTS REGIME IN TEHRAN.
ISRAEL HAS OPPOSED THE NUCLEAR
DEAL FROM THE START, BECAUSE WE
SAID THAT, RATHER THAN BLOCKING
IRAN'S PATH TO THE BOMB, IT
ACTUALLY PAVES THE PATH TO THE
NUCLEAR BOMBS WITHIN A FEW
YEARS' TIME.
>> Shepard: HE ADDED THAT THE
DECISION WAS BOTH BRAVE AND
CORRECT, >> .
>> Shepard: BUT WHAT WILL STOP
THE IRANIANS FROM ENRICHING
AGAIN?
>> YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF
WHAT THE U.S. REACTION WAS TO
THAT DURING MIKE POMPEI UP HER
>> 'S.
>> STATEMENT.
THAT'S A QUESTION THE EUROPEANS
ARE ASKING.
NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION
WHERE THERE IS A STRONG
INSPECTION REGIME, BECAUSE OF
THE JCPOA, DOES IRAN NO LONGER
LET THOSE INSPECTORS INSIDE OF
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THE
UNITED STATES IS DESIGNED TO
REIMPOSE SECTIONS?
THAT'S WHY THE EUROPEAN
GOVERNMENTS IN CHINA AND RUSSIA
ARE TRYING TO HOLD THIS
AGREEMENT TOGETHER, THEY TRY TO
DO SO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES.
BUT IRAN NOW HAS WHAT IT
BELIEVES IS A REASON TO WALK
AWAY FROM THIS, BECAUSE THE
UNITED STATES IS IT'S GOING TO
DO SO.
>> Shepard: TO BE CLEAR, THE
IRANIAN PRESIDENT HAS JUST SAID
THAT THE TALKS WITH THESE OTHER
NATIONS, ALL THESE WHO WERE
PARTY TO THE DEAL WILL COMMENCE.
ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THE
CHINESE, AND IF, IN FACT, THERE
IS NOT A WAY TO MAINTAIN THIS
DEAL WITH THESE PARTIES, THE
IRANIANS WILL THEN BEGIN
ENRICHING URANIUM AGAIN AT A
LEVEL LARGER THAN BEFORE.
AND IF THE IRANIANS DO THAT,
