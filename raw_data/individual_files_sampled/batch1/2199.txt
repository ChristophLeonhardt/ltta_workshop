I've been cheated on and it's absolutely terrible I was seeing a girl for a couple months and on my birthday she decided to tell me that she had been sleeping with her ex-boyfriend quote a lot needless to say it was such a traumatic emotional experience that I never want to go through it again that's why I found some research-based signs to tell if your partner might be cheating first look at the words they're using a Southern Methodist University study shows some specific words are helpful at predicting when someone isn't telling the truth for example Liars tend to avoid first-person words like I and me and cognitive words like realize or think on the flip side Liars tend to use motion verbs more like walk or move and of course angry words like hate are always a red flag another way to find out if someone is cheating is to get an outside perspective ask a friend or at the very least don't ignore your friends when they say something's wrong like I did this advice comes from BYU psychologists who had couples draw an object together with one person blindfolded and the other describing what to draw the researchers showed strangers videos of the couples drawing the strangers were surprisingly accurate at guessing which couples had a cheater it turns out an outside observer may be able to detect infidelity and unhappiness another sign to look out for is excessive social media use a University of Missouri study looked at about 600 Twitter users most people use Twitter for about an hour a day those who used it more were more likely to get in arguments with their partners get divorced or cheat it doesn't mean one is directly connected to the other but if they're a big tweeter they could be a cheater
