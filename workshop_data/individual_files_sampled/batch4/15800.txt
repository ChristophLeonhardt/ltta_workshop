the Met Police is examining over 65 cases of electoral fraud in the UK and over 40 of those cases sent around the borough of Tower Hamlets that's look for ramens old stomping ground do you remember the old Tower Hamlets electoral fraud probe with look for a land back in let me jog your memory just watch this video Council on your arm and I'm the deputy mayor of Hamlet I'm gonna make it shorter Statesman now today's judgement has come as a shock their mayor strongly denies any wrongdoing and has full confidence in the justice system so the result has been surprising to say the least we are now seeking further legal advice on the matter in relation to the judgement review more detailed statements will be provided true so Mohamed look for Amin was the first directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets he was elected in 2010 and he was originally a Labour Party candidate he won the selection process but it came out that he had links to the Islamic fundamentalist group the Islamic forum of Europe and he came at least he signed up fake members to the Labour Party in order to win the selection so he was deselected and then stood as an independent interestingly George Galloway who's famously not a Muslim and this respect party basically praised him and they didn't go as far as endorsing him I think but they praised him and so loved her Amin stood in the election as an independent and he won 51% of the vote amazing good for him and then in 2014 he stood again and this time he was the leader of the Tower Hamlets first party but the election was eventually declared void when he was found guilty of electoral bribery postal vote fraud illegally paying canvasses and the spiritual intimidation of voters which was an interesting one so basically he used the Muslim voters in the area and scared them into voting for him is the general gist of the case and so love for Raman is actually banned from standing for election and at all but he's back now and for the election happening tomorrow and he was endorsing a party in Tara Hamlet's called aspire but now the the police are back on the case in Tower Hamlets I wonder why Tower Hamlets is suddenly the center once again of an electoral fraud storm and it probably includes postal voting issues again like it did with what for Amin and like it seems to be happening all over the country let's take a look at this article from the Express the title says election shock met police probe 65 claims of fraud ahead of Thursday's vote it goes on to say at least 40 of the corruption allegations center around the borough of Tower Hamlets which has been called out for electoral fraud of malpractice in the past you're not kidding during the 2014 elections there were 164 allegations of electoral fraud and wrongdoing in the borough Detective Chief Superintendent sue Williams who was in charge of the operation told the Evening Standard it is vital to ensure the integrity of the democratic process so in the run-up to the election and on the day itself there will be a policing plan in place in Tower Hamlets a policing plan in place for an election we need police outside ballot stations and probably within them as well making sure there's no electoral fraud what country is this how is this England is this real-life back in 2016 as well they had to consider plans for vulnerable areas we know what vulnerable areas mean means and they were considering plans of people having to take their passport to go and vote it sounds crazy I mean in England you don't even have to take your your ballot card that comes through the post you just turn up and say your name and you go and vote actually if you think about it that is a bit crazy but you know in a trusting Society in a society and a culture built on trust doing that is fairly normal you turn up you say your name and you vote because that's how our society works we trust one another our entire legal system and culture is built on trust but now we're in a situation where Trust is not good enough and so these plans are that we can a couple years ago I don't know if they ever came to fruition I don't think they did I think probably they should actually come to fruition and maybe more places than just the vulnerable area should be looking at voter ID it's necessary these problems are happening throughout the country as well it's not just Tower Hamlets you probably seen this article a disgraced former labour councillor who was kicked out for voter fraud is shamelessly re standing in this year's local elections sorry to be shallow and mean but I mean look at his face I don't know if anyone ever played that game years ago on the PlayStation one called Abe's Oddysee if you don't know it look it up I mean funny but can do and he's a former Labour politician convicted of voter fraud and he's standing in the upcoming elections using a new name the son can reveal Shafak armed' 50 is running for the Small Heath Ward in Birmingham despite being found guilty over his role in a massive labour voter fraud scam in the 2004 local elections the temerity in the balls and the gumption that these people have to delay Tinley commit electoral fraud and then in the instance of look for Amin to just start promoting a brand new party and then for electoral fraud concerns to happen again in the same ward I mean it's absolutely incredible and as Ezra mentioned actually recently in one of his new new shows a battleground which I'm loving by the way he talked about the difference between a high trust and a low trust society and as I just mentioned then we live in a society built on trust and we're clashing with a culture that isn't built on trust it's not even built on man-made law so it is it any surprise that these vulnerable areas happen to be highly Muslim areas Islamic culture does not allow for man-made law it's not a society and culture built on trust in the same way that Western civilization and culture is and so this is what happens this is what happens in these areas where we allow ghettoization to happen where we allow communities have become segregated and an insurer when we allow this to happen we get parallel systems of Josh parallel systems of democracy and power and and control it's incredible to see it happen in my own country to see third world practices like this happening on my doorstep now it's terrifying but what it shows is a real difference between culture and you know some people say it's hard to define British culture it's actually much easier to define British culture when you're faced with instances of terrible terrible things happening that are not a part of our culture and this is one of them if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our
