00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:03,470
>> Shepard: AND THERE’S BREAKING

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,539
NEWS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,475
JOE MANCHIN IS A YES ON BRETT

4
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:08,842
KAVANAUGH.

5
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,611
THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

6
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:11,879
JUST IN THE LAST FEW SECONDS

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,180
MADE THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.

8
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,415
THE DEMOCRATS FROM WEST VIRGINIA

9
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,151
IS THE FIRST AND SO FAR ONLY

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,453
DEMOCRAT TO SAY THAT HE WILL

11
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:21,455
VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

12
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,692
NOT A SURPRISE IN ANY WAY THAT

13
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,594
IT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER,

14
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:32,099
JUST ABOUT TO BE EXPECTED.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,367
WEST VIRGINIA IS RUBY RED AND

16
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,269
NOW THINGS ARE AS WE EXPECTED

17
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,004
MIGHT BE, CHRIS.

18
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,007

00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,810
KNOW THAT JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN A
>> YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY, I DON’T

KNOW THAT JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN A

21
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,478
PROFILE IN COURAGE ON THIS.

22
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,447
HE DIDN’T VOTE TO END THE

23
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:49,851
DEBATE, TO INVOKE CLOTURE IN HE

24
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,153
WAS SURE THAT HE WAS 50 VOTES.

25
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:54,055
HE DIDN’T ANNOUNCE HOW HE WAS

26
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,356
GOING TO VOTE ON KAVANAUGH UNTIL

27
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:57,492
HE SAW THAT IT WAS ALREADY

28
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,127
DECIDED BY SUSAN COLLINS.

29
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:02,130
SO HE’S ON THE "RIGHT SIDE OF

30
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,632
THE ISSUE" POLITICALLY FOR MOST

31
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,834
VOTERS IN WEST VIRGINIA BUT HE

32
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,169
WAITED UNTIL HE WAS NOT THE

33
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:08,603
SWING VOTE.

34
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,572
>> Shepard: THE NEXT STEP IS A

35
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:12,106
VOTE IN CONGRESS, A FULL VOTE IN

36
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,275
THE SENATE AND IT’S OUR

37
00:01:14,276 --> 00:01:15,143
UNDERSTANDING THAT COMES

38
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:15,610
TOMORROW.

39
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:16,377
IS THAT RIGHT?

40
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:18,747
A LOT OF DEBATE FIRST.

41
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,315
>> A LOT OF DEBATE.

42
00:01:20,316 --> 00:01:21,149
30 HOURS.

43
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,218
ONLY IN THE SENATE WOULD YOU CUT

44
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,688
OFF DEBATE BY INVOKING CLOTURE

45
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,857
THAT STARTS THE CLOCK FOR MORE

46
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,625
30 HOURS OF DEBATE.

47
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:32,394
IT ENDED BY 11:00.

48
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:33,795
THE DEMOCRATS MAY NOT TAKE THE

49
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:35,063
ENTIRE 30 HOURS.

50
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:36,164
SOMETIMES IN MID TO LATE

51
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:38,200
AFTERNOON, SOMETIME BETWEEN 3:30

00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:43,238
SENATE WILL VOTE AND UNLESS

55
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,973
THERE IS SOME UNFORESEEN CHANGE

THERE IS SOME UNFORESEEN CHANGE

57
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:47,977
OF MIND BY SOMEBODY HERE, LOOKS

58
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:53,182
LIKE IT WILL GO 50-48.

59
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:55,217
WITH ONE VOTE MISSING.

60
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:57,486
THAT WOULD BE STEVE DANES UNLESS

61
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:02,157
HE WANTS TO FLY BACK AND MAKE IT
THAT WOULD BE STEVE DANES UNLESS

62
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:02,158
HE WANTS TO FLY BACK AND MAKE IT

63
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:02,491
51-48.

64
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:03,792
>> Shepard: IT’S OUR

65
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:04,693
UNDERSTANDING HE DOES NOT.

66
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:06,495
IT’S HIS DAUGHTER’S WEDDING DAY.

67
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:09,498
IF HE DOESN’T HAVE TO FLY BACK,
IT’S HIS DAUGHTER’S WEDDING DAY.

68
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:09,499
IF HE DOESN’T HAVE TO FLY BACK,

69
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:10,332
HE WILL NOT.

70
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,535
THIS IS DECIDED FOR ALL UP TENTS

71
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:13,636
AND PURPOSES.

72
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:15,738
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ONE SIDE

73
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:16,906
AND THE OTHER?

74
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,308
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT FOR THE

75
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:20,976
DEMOCRATS, AS TOUGH AS IT IS TO

76
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:23,312
BE TO LOSE IN THE SENATE IN

77
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:24,914
TERMS OF THE CONFIRMATION OF

78
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,948
BRETT KAVANAUGH, THAT IT WOULD

79
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:28,718
HELP THEM IN THE MID-TERMS.

80
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,152
YOU’VE SEEN ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

81
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,754
ON CAPITOL HILL, HUNDREDS OF

82
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:34,423
THEM, 300 ARRESTED YESTERDAY.

83
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:35,958
I THINK THIS WILL ONLY IGNITE

84
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,364
THE FEELING AMONG A LOT OF

85
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:42,131
DEMOCRATS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN,

86
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:44,534
THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT

87
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,202
SYMPATHETIC TO THEIR INTERESTS.

88
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:48,037
SUBURBAN WOMEN ESPECIALLY.

89
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:50,473
THAT WILL EMPOWER THEM TO GO OUT

90
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,207
IN THE POLLS.

91
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,542
THE QUESTION WHICH WOULD BE MORE

92
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:55,278
HELPFUL TO REPUBLICANS, TO WIN

93
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,713
OR LOSE IN THE SENATE?

94
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:59,015
I BEGIN TO THINK WINNING IS THE

95
00:02:59,016 --> 00:02:59,783
BEST THING.

96
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:01,851
HAD THEY LOST THAT MIGHT HAVE

97
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:02,986
DISSPIRITED THE BASE.

98
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,454
YOU SEE IN THE FIGHT OVER

99
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,222
KAVANAUGH ACCORDING TO THE

100
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:08,491
POLLS, A REAL RISE IN

101
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:08,892
ENTHUSIASM.

102
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:10,594
A BIG GAP IN INTENSITY BETWEEN

103
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:11,595
DEMOCRATS WHO SEEM VERY

104
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:14,297

REPUBLICANS THAT DID NOT SEEM SO

107

ENERGIZED.

108
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,702
A LOT OF FEELING AMONG THE

109
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:21,038
REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE BASE

110
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,339
THAT KAVANAUGH HAS NOT BEEN

111
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,440
DEALT WITH FAIRLY.

112
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,208
IN A LOT OF POLLS WHEN YOU USED

113
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,978
TO SEE A GAP OF 10 OR 12 POINTS
IN A LOT OF POLLS WHEN YOU USED

114
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,448
TO SEE A GAP OF 10 OR 12 POINTS IS NOW PLUS 2 FOR THE DEMOCRATS.

115
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,550
IS NOW PLUS 2 FOR THE DEMOCRATS.>> Shepard: WE HAVE A POLITICAL

GENERATION BETWEEN NOW AND THE

ELECTION.

119
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:37,688
THAT IS OBVIOUS.

120
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:40,791
WITH THAT SAID, THE ANALYSTS

121
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:44,395
HAVE SAID THIS VOTE, BECAUSE OF

122
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,196
SUBURBAN EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN

123
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:48,399
AND THE ENERGIZING OF THEM, THAT

124
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,035
THE HOUSE IS MORE SOLID FOR

125
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,336
DEMOCRATS NOW AND THE SENATE

126
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,572
COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE SOLID FOR

127
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:54,972
REPUBLICANS.

128
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:57,174
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT PART OF

129
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:57,441
IT?

130
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:00,244
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT MIGHT WELL

131
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,379
BE TRUE.

132
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,349
BECAUSE HOUSE DISTRICTS ARE SO

133
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,352

PEOPLE THAT THEY’LL TURN OUT

IMPACT IN THE HOUSE.

IN A SENATE RACE, THE ENTIRE

145
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:33,811
STATE, IT’S MORE INTENSITY.

146
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:36,448

THE AFTERMATH OF OBAMA CARE, YOU

151
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:51,730
SAW REPUBLICANS TURN OUT.

152
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:52,464
THIS YEAR IN THE OPPOSITION TO

153
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:53,198
TRUMP, IT LOOKED LIKE DEMOCRATS

154
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,665
WOULD TURN OUT.

155
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,299
NOW THERE’S A BACKLASH BY

156
