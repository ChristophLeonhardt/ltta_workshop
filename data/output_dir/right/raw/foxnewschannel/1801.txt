1
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,661
>>> PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN

2
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:15,065
NUCLEAR DEAL WILL MAKE IT HARDER

3
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:17,200
TO NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,202
NORTH KOREA OR ANYONE ELSE.

5
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:22,005
IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER A SECOND

6
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:22,806
TIME.

7
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:24,941
NOW THAT OUR CREDIBILITY IS

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,241
SHOT.

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,409
>> HILLARY CLINTON NOW TAKING

10
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:28,678
HER CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:29,045
OVERSEAS.

12
00:00:29,045 --> 00:00:32,381
BUT AS THE NEXT GUEST LAYS OUT,

13
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:34,684
THAT'S NOT ALL SHE'S BEEN UP TO.

14
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:37,587
JAMES FREEMAN, THE ASSISTANT

15
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:39,956
EDITOR OF "THE WALL STREET

16
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,523
JOURNAL."

17
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:43,059
YOU BHAIS CLI SAID

18
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:43,093
YOU BASIS CLI SAID

19
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:43,126
YOU BASIC CLI SAID

20
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:43,159
YOU BASICALLI SAID

21
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,761
YOU BASICALLY SAID IN THE PEACE

22
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,630
SHE

23
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,300
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S A

24
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,333
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S G

25
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:50,367
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S O

26
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:50,400
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S A

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,734
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S L

28
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:51,101
GRIEVANCE.

29
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:53,536
>> THIS WEEK WAS IN AUSTRALIA,

30
00:00:53,536 --> 00:00:54,404
EARLIER IN INDIA.

31
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:56,573
AND I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

32
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,007
HAVE TO BE SCRATCHING THEIR

33
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,075
HEADS BECAUSE THERE WAS A

34
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:00,610
GENERAL RECOGNITION ABOUT THE

35
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,379
MISTAKES OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

36
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:02,846
IN 2016.

37
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,280
GEE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE SPENT

38
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,683
MORE TIME IN THE MIDWEST, MAYBE

39
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,318
SHOULDN'T HAVE INSULTED A LOT OF

40
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,953
PEOPLE IN MIDDLE AMERICA, SHOULD

41
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:11,521
HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR

42
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:11,888
CONCERNS.

43
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:14,357
>> BUT SHE STILL SEEMS TO BE

44
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,959
INSULTING PEOPLE, TRUMP

45
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,493
SUPPORTERS.

46
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,795
IT WAS DEPLORABLES DURING THE

47
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:19,162
CAMPAIGN.

48
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,098
SHE'S NOT USING THAT WORD BUT

49
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:23,099
BASICALLY SAYING THE SAME THING.

50
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,336
>> THE INDIA SPEECH, IT WAS VERY

51
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,304
MUCH A DEPLORABLE SPEECH,

52
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:29,773
BLAMING RACISM, KNOCKING PEOPLE

53
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:32,776
WHO WERE IN THE ECONOMICALLY

54
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:35,111
DEPRESSED AREAS AS NOT BEING HER

55
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,246
VOTERS.

56
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,514
HER VOTERS WERE IN THE PLACE

57
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,115
WHERE IT WAS RICH AND

58
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:39,582
SUCCESSFUL.

59
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,284
NOW IT'S COME AROUND AND IT'S

60
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:42,952
MORE OF AN ATTACK ON THE

61
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,287
PRESIDENT FROM OVERSEAS, SAYING

62
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,089
THAT THE U.S. CREDIBILITY IS

63
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:48,425
SHOT BY HIS DECIDING TO LEAVE

64
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,225
THE IRAN DEAL.

65
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:52,162
I DON'T KNOW HOW GOING OVERSEAS

66
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:57,233
TO MAKE THESE COMMENTS TO A VERY

67
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,334
WELL-HEALDZ AUDIENCE AS USUAL

68
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,369
WITH HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO

69
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,438
APPEAL BACK HERE.

70
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,242
>> MAYBE THEY'LL SELL THE BOOK

71
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:06,609
OVERSEAS.

72
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,077
BUT THERE USED TO BE A TRADITION

73
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:09,779
IN THIS COUNTRY AND I KNOW THIS

74
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,781
PRESIDENT HAS UPENDED A LOT OF

75
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,383
TRADITIONS TO BE FAIR AND CLEAR.

76
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:18,988
BUT THERE WAS A LONG STANDING

77
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:21,458
TRADITION OF PARTISAN STOPS AT

78
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,492
THE WATER'S EDGE.

79
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:26,496
>> THAT

80
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:26,529
>> THIT

81
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:30,700
>> THIS IS A DELICATE MOMENT IN

82
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,068
DIPLOMACY WITH NORTH KOREA.

83
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,102
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK A LOT

84
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:34,504
IS GOING TO COME OF IT.

85
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,705
BUT THIS IS A BIG MOMENT WHERE

86
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,674
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO MAKE

87
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:38,875
A MAJOR AGREEMENT TO MAKE THE

88
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,009
WORLD A SAFER PLACE.

89
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,011
YEAH, I THINK I A LOT OF PEOPLE

90
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:44,581
WOULD SAY WHAT IS THE STRATEGY

91
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,182
HERE TO KNOCK IT FROM OVERSEAS

92
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,151
AND TO SUGGEST IF SHE DOES,

93
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,653
AMERICA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

94
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,256
>> HE NEGOTIATED THE IRAN

95
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,024
NUCLEAR DEAL WHICH HASN'T

96
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:56,826
EXACTLY WORKED OUT AND SHE'S

97
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,261
CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S

98
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:58,928
APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA.

99
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,563
WHEN THE CLINTON AND OBAMA

100
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,364
ADMINISTRATIONS HAD THEIR SHOT

101
00:03:01,364 --> 00:03:02,732
AND THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE AND

102
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,032
WORSE.

103
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:05,535
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE AT

104
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:06,603
LEAST MOVING TOWARDS PEACE NOW?

105
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,072
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT -- I DON'T PUT

106
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,040
A LOT OF FAITH IN THIS

107
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,975
DICTATORSHIP TO COME AROUND.

108
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,176
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH

109
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:13,743
THIS BEFORE.

110
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,778
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT HISTORY,

111
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,348
IT SHOULD -- YOU WOULD THINK

112
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:20,416
PERHAPS GIVE HER A SENSE OF

113
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,518
HUMILITY, GIVEN THE FACT THAT

114
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,119
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE

115
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,654
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN SHE

116
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:26,256
WAS THERE, THINGS DIDN'T WORK

117
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:26,523
OUT.

118
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:27,457
>> AND HER HUSBAND'S

119
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:27,924
ADMINISTRATION.

120
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,259
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

121
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,728
AND ON THE IRAN DEAL, SHE DIDN'T

122
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,162
CLOSE IT BUT SHE CERTAINLY SET

123
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:34,397
THE TABLE FOR THAT AGREEMENT

124
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,832
WHILE SHE WAS IN OFFICE.

125
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:39,068
AND YEAH, PERHAPS NOT A

126
00:03:39,068 --> 00:00:00,000
DISINTERESTED OBSERVER.
