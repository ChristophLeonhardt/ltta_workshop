another tragic incident this week an innocent left-wing narrative was gunned down by a vicious barrage of information concerned looking leftists are once again calling for new restrictions and even an outright ban on a form of ammunition they consider dangerous and unnecessary the facts trigger one i'm andrew clayton and this another mass slaughter of left-wing ideas wild-eyed conservative wielding an unlicensed fact in the wake of the violence democrats and other anti constitutionalists have once again issued a ringing call for a complete ban on reality this has got to stop said president obama i come here today while our grief is still fresh so that i might exploit your emotions before some crazy right-wingers starts randomly peppering our national conversation with actual knowledge Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton also weighed in saying quote as a woman who has selflessly dedicated her entire life to corruption and dishonesty I find it appalling that some conservative terrorists still believe we need to have unfettered access to the truth the First Amendment was written at a time when facts were being fired out of primitive broadsides and pamphlets it's absurd to think our founders wanted us to be able to unleash information with rapid-fire assault weapons like television and the Internet the latest Democrat calls for fact control came after an incident in which left wingers innocently exploiting our national grief over a shooting incident called for new government violations of our Second Amendment right to bear arms Democrats were simply making the completely irrational argument that such shootings should make it harder for a citizen to defend himself when suddenly conservatives opened fire with a barrage of facts showing that gun ownership not only guarantees our liberties but actually saves lives and prevents crime this is outrageous said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg there I was pointing out that other nations such as Great Britain virtually ban firearms when some crazy conservative blasted away with the fact that gun violence has skyrocketed in Britain since their ban went into effect we can't go on like this or there'll be no statist ideas left alive anti-gun academics across the country have issued a manifesto calling for a nationwide moratorium on the use of facts saying quote our liberal arts departments have banned reality for decades and it's about time the rest of the country followed suit every incident of gun violence in this country should be an opportunity to exploit grief in order to disarm the populace so that they have no ultimate defense against the imposition of our oppressive leftist ideology while anti fact activists admitted they might not be able to ban all facts right away they called on Congress to immediately pass laws banning at least those facts that showed that increased gun ownership was connected to lower murder rates and that mass shootings almost always take place in gun-free zones as President Obama remarked if we can keep even one anti-gun narrative from being blown away by these facts we might one day realize our dream of government of the people by the corrupt elites I'm Andrew Clavin with live wire
