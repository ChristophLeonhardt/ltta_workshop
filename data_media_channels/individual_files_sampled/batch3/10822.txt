well welcome to Sophie & Co I'm Sophie shiver not set the world has looked its destruction in the eye 73 years ago when American nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki today can humanity come together and prevent the catastrophe from ever happening again I ask nuclear weapons disarmament activists Hiroshima bombing survivor Setsuko Thurlow one bomb one blast and a whole cities leveled in seconds living fire and radiation in its wake the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 still serves as a reminder of the horrors of war especially when coming from the survivors of the explosion what was it like to live through a nuclear attack can the stories of eyewitnesses change the way we see nuclear weapons today and will humanity ever be rid of them sets Cather lone survivor of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima welcome it's really great to have you with us you were in Hiroshima in August of 45 when the nuclear bomb was dropped on the city we now know that a nuclear bomb kills not only at the moment of explosion but for many years after you weren't far from epicenter of the explosion were you exposed to radiation did it make itself known later anybody in the city were exposed to radiation yes and we are all contaminated and on a different degree of seriousness some people were killed immediately some people survived but they started developing sentence like loss of hair internal bleeding's bleeding from the gum diarrhea fevers those things practically all the people who were in the city or who entered the industry to rescue the dying people what they too became contaminated so we all shared the common symptoms for some time yes I lost my hair and bleeding internal bleeding bleeding from the gum diarrhea those things I read that someone pointed you out of the burning building and you crawled out what happened then how did you find your family that's correct how many of them survived how did you find your family well the next day on August 7th in the morning hundreds of people thousands of people were just sitting on the nearby hills and we hardly slept we just kept watching the entire city burn all night and then in the morning the Japanese soldier came around with the megaphone and said is there cisco Nakamura is there cisco Nakamura I said Here I am well your parents are here to look for you and I was surprised and I saw my parents and I learned what happened to them my father left town early that morning on the 6th of August he was out in the boat fishing boat at the inland sea he loved the fishing and that was his day off and suddenly he heard something and he started the mushroom cloud rising he knew something terrible happened so he came back my mother was doing the dishes after breakfast and this she too was buried under the collapsed building she has to be helped and she was helped and was able to escape to the outside of the city and how they came together I don't know but they told me my married sister and a four year old child who had been evacuated moved out of the city of Hiroshima in order to protect themselves from a raid but they came home the night before to visit us so they were that morning they were on their way to the hospital they are walking over the bridge the mother in for your child and they had no chance and by the time I saw them that morning they were just blackened and swollen you just couldn't recognize them they were simply blackened melted chunk of flesh they survived about four days they kept begging for water but there was there were no medical doctors or nurses no food or we could give what some water how many in my very close family eight of them perished my sister-in-law or the high school teacher she was in the center of the city supervising several thousand about seven or eight thousand students who were mobilized to do the task for me in the city to establish the fire lane so they were doing the physical labor in even at eight o'clock on August 6th it was so hot many boys just took off the shirts just a bare skin and then detonation took place is right above them about five six hundred meter above them and they are the one who simply vaporized method or carbonized from my school 321 girls simply disappeared Zuko what we're days months after the bombing like how did you survive in a burnt-out city did you even know what had happened I mean it was the first time that something like that ever took place well I thought I'm finally caught us because they had been aerating most of the city especially since March the 1st 1945 so we hiroshima people in that city were beginning to feel very anxious the Hiroshima was supposed to be about 10th largest city in Japan at that time but even smaller city had been bombed you know most of the cities have been bombed how come we haven't been attacked every day in every night b-29 fly around but they haven't dropped any bomb little did we know that the Americans had already selected Hiroshima as a target for the new type of bombs which they already had the American government's position has been that bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki we're needed to save American soldiers lives from being lost in a potential war on the ground how do you feel when you hear that does this explanation sound logical to you that's America myth just a myth because Japan had been exhausted by that time Japan was finished by that time I can verify that we were practically starving at home and the soldiers of this Pacific or any other battlefield they didn't have food they didn't have munition and we were finished the war ended and the Japanese would considering the surrender there are many historical evidence that the use of nuclear weapon was not necessary and most of historian acknowledged that I read that you said somewhere the u.s. occupation for brought you a sense of relief and liberation from the oppression of Japan's military state government but I mean those were the people who like you were describing so vividly brought total destruction to your cities killed hundreds of thousands of people I mean eight people's from your a people whom your immediate family died they do not connect the US soldiers with the atom bomb was there any hatred in you to words to Americans or you were grateful they have brought the end of the war with them at that time I would say most of the people in Hiroshima who experienced that atomic bombing we were in Nam the condition the all the experiences or the stimulus was so massive and grotesque and and our psyche you would not accept that and that meant the cessation of emotion we were not responding to all the horrible scenes inside if we responded normally we would not have survived so with that condition I think people's emotional response to many things which were happening around us at that time was not as sharp and normal and that's powerful as you would expect it so you have to really remember this very point we have to take a short break right now just a short break okay but while we're back we'll continue talking with suka Thurlow Hiroshima bombing survivor nuclear disarmament campaign are discussing the nuclear danger today stay with Sophie encode we're back what's at suka Thurlow Hiroshima bombing survivor and nuclear disarmament campaigner talking about those dark days in 1945 and what should be done to never let a tragedy like this happen again Zuko I know that the u.s. Occupational forces also impose their sort of oppression on the bombing survivors what was it like let me give you a couple of examples United States established its decision called a BCC atomic bomb casualty Commission and people are very happy well finally we get some kind of medication some medical experts who know what this is about would help Japanese doctors who were at a loss but the sole purpose of a BCC was to study the effect of radiation on human bodies nothing else not to help the sick people by the radiation and the survivors felt they were being used as a guinea pigs Twice first time as a target secondly a subject for research you can imagine that occupation forces did not want the media newspapers to write anything which could be seen as destroyed Vantage's to the occupation forces and if the newspaper writes something about the destruction and especially human suffering in Hiroshima another that was very that was considered to be disadvantages this I have to stop so they censored and they forced some newspaper companies to close the shop that's not the exactly Democratic thing to do isn't it and the survivors wrote Diaries they had correspondences and some people wrote haiku you know Japanese literally form when they have pain in their heart they have to express that by writing hi to and so on they had the photographs filmed even medical information all these things were confiscated and 32,000 I teams in law they were all shipped back to the United States because the scientific triumph of the United States by producing atomic bombs was okay the world can find out but what human suffering those bombs caused in those cities that's what was not to be found out by the world that was the reason why so I want to talk a little about the American reaction to what happened seventy-three years ago now President Obama was the first American president to come to Hiroshima in 2016 he delivered a very emotional speech very emotional but never said sorry for America's decision to drop the bomb I know the American public went nuts over the suggestion that he could apologize with the pundits relentlessly mocking that idea so my question is in your opinion why is it so hard for Americans why why do Americans are so uneasy about owning up to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings well I suppose even today seventy-three years later they must believe what they did was justifiable was to be justified to end the war quickly and to rescue American GI s lives and that was okay I think that mentality still continues unfortunately not thinking people though I think many Americans woke up it was such a atrocity unacceptable immoral illegal act United States took and many Americans are sorry about that but as a state the other nation I guess they are too proud to apologize I know apology was a very contentious or controversial issue I feel if he offered it we should have accepted it we deserved our chapter but he chose not to and he couldn't have I suppose and because of the political milieu in the States especially during the presidential election time but it's not totally inappropriate if he did offer that apology you you know in war everybody did horrible thing won't against by the international law international humanitarian law Germans dead and British there the u.s. stood japanese did Kasey's in most cases nations do apologize Jen Germans made sure they lie their life after World War Two was one big apology British people apologize many times as well and remember both Germany and Japan who tried the tribunals yes and Japanese military leaders I think six or seven of them or hung and what happened in Nuremberg judgment so the losers would the tried but the victors no matter what they have done are not to be tried it's a very unfair world oh I understood that even as a child yes now the memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been kept alive thanks to people like you and governments remember those lessons as well there has not been a single combat use of a nuclear bomb since 45 now to me it seems that humanity has learned it's lesson has sinned enough to not ever use nukes again do you have less face and humanity than I do let's faith yes no I do I do have faith yes they are going to find that I mean if they don't have it now they will certainly I have faith in humanity this humanity must continue to live and this civilization must be preserved I think it's ridiculous some goofy people threatening each other and threatened by saying their bombs are bigger than others and we have more of them imagine such childish impulsive Satan being exchanged by those anyway it's hard to believe those things are still happening but I think people are gradually learning and more than anything I am grateful thousand of hundred of the millions of people around the world came to realize who just can't leave it to the government alone and the NGOs and 122 nation signed at the United Nations and to adopt the the treaty to prohibit the nuclear weapon I have heard you in many other interviews say over and over again that this anti-nuclear activism work you're doing this so that the deaths of your loved ones will no be in vain do you really have to make amends for what happened in 45 I mean it wasn't your fault you didn't drop the bomb the blast is not your fault why do you feel that you are responsible in some way why do you burden yourself with it why I'm responsible for this look I experienced it I witness the massive death and destruction anybody would the conscience moral sense you can't just remain silent about the horror something is wrong somebody did it somebody created such destruction and massive death of humanity entire city just disappeared with one bomb that when we learn that what's caused by human beings then we have to stand up and stop that kind of behavior by the human being who is responsible United States was responsible they have never said sorry about that unfortunately more importantly to make sure something like that should never happen again to any human beings to us that is a higher priority we have to stop at all cost and this is why we have been speaking out about our pain painful past experiences the past 70 decades believe me it's not easy each time I talk about it my I try to embrace but still I don't succeed it pains me but I keep doing it because there is no other way I can live this is my moral imperative I guess that would be my answer do thank you so much for being with us tonight I have no words actually to express my gratitude thank you for sharing this I gives me more I really would well this is the first time I speak to Russian people well I promise you we're gonna have another lengthy interview in the near or so I promise you that much oh I I hope so I really wanted Russian people to think about life and death it's the life of every citizen I'm concerned not the national security international security and you know all these military jargons yes it's important for us to know such things but the most important thing for us is to remember our humanity that's the most important thing I hope your message gets across and people will hear it and understand it and take it close to heart thank you so much Suzuka who are talking to Suzuka Thurlow Hiroshima bombing survivor and a disarmament campaigner discussing how her great experience should help us address the nuclear danger today that's it for this edition of sofiane KO and i will see you next time
