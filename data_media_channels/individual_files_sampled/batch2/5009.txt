justice Brett Kavanaugh will start his first day on the job joining his eight other colleagues to hear oral arguments so can the court hit the reset button just days after the conclusion of that all-out nomination fight my colleague Pete Williams our justice correspondent is joining us now so Pete what is Cavanaugh's first day going to look like well not exactly blockbuster cases this will be a return to a question that comes up before the Supreme Court a lot what did Congress mean when it said that people who commit violent felonies can be subjected to a federal law that requires longer prison sentence for the next couple of days he's gonna face a caseload that is basically the bulk of what the Supreme Court does trying to define what Congress meant with laws that are hard to understand and that divide the lower courts so it's off to a low-key start which he may very much welcome after the bruising confirmation battle he was at the court on Sunday already getting ready he kept his promise to hire all women law clerks off for his poor law clerks for all women so he'll he'll get off to a start during a somewhat low-key unusually low-key start to this term but before it's over he may vote on whether to take up some more controversial cases what about then the possibility of recusal this seems to have come up from some of those critics on things like for example executive power and so on what's the expectation well I think the expectation is that he's not gonna recuse on political questions most justices don't there are some rare exceptions like for example the vote on the Nixon tapes but for the most part Supreme Court justices don't refrain from voting on cases that involve the president's who appointed them for example Neil Gorsuch voted on some cases that involve Donald Trump and other justices that have been appointed by Clinton and Obama have done the same for issues involving their presidents most times Supreme Court justices recuse themselves because of some direct personal conflict they own stock in a company that's involved in a case they've got a family member that's involved in a company or they somehow were handled a case before it got to the court either because they were in government or on a lower court but recusal because of a political dispute or criticism for a political party those are exceptionally rare and I know think he would be expected to do so Pete Williams Pete thank you for breaking that down for us appreciate that let me bring it now Jeffrey Rosen president and CEO of the National Constitution Center and professor at George Washington University's law school as well Jeffrey thanks for coming on and let me ask you this I am just hearing now from my colleagues back at the white house unit that first lady Melania Trump will not be attending the swearing-in ceremony ceremonial right for justice Cavanaugh tonight is that unusual typically this is something first leaders may or may not attend right yes I don't think first ladies always attended I wouldn't read anything in particularly to it let me ask you about the the comments that just did another Supreme Court justice Elena Kagan has made as you take a look at the first lady by the way just back from Africa here's what here's a justice set watch part of the courts legitimacy depends on people not seeing the court in the way that people see the rest of the governing structures of this country now it's not so clear that you know I think going forward that sort of middle position you know it's not so clear whether we'll have it do you think the court can hit the reset button here you know that's an incredibly important Justice Kagan just made she and her other colleagues are concerned that the court cannot easily hit the reset button that citizens will come to see it as five Republicans against four Democrats it puts huge pressure on Chief Justice John Roberts to avoid what Justice Kagan suggested which is citizens seeing the court in political term so it's really striking that both she and justice Sotomayor at Princeton last week both expressed concern for the future legitimacy of the court and it shows that tremendous stakes that will face justice Cavanaugh during his first weeks and months but so what can the Chief Justice do right is there a sense that John Roberts would want to stay away from questions where Cavanaugh for example would have to weigh in on these issues of executive power in the Trump administration right off the bat is that something that that you see it's a possibility it is a possibility the main thing that the Chief Justice can do is assign the opinion when he's in the majority or give it to a colleague who best reflects his views that means that Roberts has said that he wants to convince his colleagues to converge around narrow unanimous opinions and avoid sweeping constitutional questions in other words not overturn Roe cleanly but instead just try to distinguish it and he'd try to persuade Cavanaugh to do that but more to the point the chief can refuse to hear a controversial cases you can try to persuade his colleagues let's not take an abortion case this term let's not deal with affirmative action this country is too divided let's let the lower courts deal with that and let's stick to the really technical cases that is Pete Williams described the justices are more likely to be unanimous on in order to rebuild nonpartisan faith in the legitimacy of the court Pete did say there's really nothing super blockbuster II coming up but there are some cases with potential big implications coming down the pipeline you've got Stowe chling versus the United States you've got air and liquid systems core vs. DeVries Neilson versus Esprit basically employment protections of gay and lesbian workers and other dealing with religious symbols on public property this is a hot-button stuff right what are you watching for what's the next thing you're looking at that's coming down the pipeline executive power as you were saying that's what everyone's looking at and there's a really interesting case called Grundy it's kind of technical can the Attorney General retrospectively apply a sex offenders act but it raises this broad question can Congress delegate to the president really important decisions the future of the administrative state the ability of the EPA to regulate the environment could be at stake interestingly justice Kavanagh might say Congress can't delegate to the president that would make it harder to pass other regulations but it might ironically end up having him rule against the Trump administration in this case Jeffrey Rosen thank you very much for coming on the show appreciate it right now today by the way early voting is already happening in nearly a dozen states coast-to-coast start today in the place of the most voters California a state that is jam-packed with pickup opportunities for Democrats

is the vine so good you end up with a lot rule number ten section 2a states a player shall not run with the ball without dribbling it that's the rule but what about our politics are there any rules anymore and if so will anybody play by them these days politics could use a little refereeing and we're not afraid to blow the whistle I talked a lot of people many of them fighting man it's a divided country people ready to go toe to toe on each and every issue and it's not going to change anytime soon I like a political fight as much as anybody what are we gonna get to some decisions and just keep fighting the woman sitting next to me at the counter at the diner she turns to me and says please tell Larry O'Donnell that he needs to run for president I was like that I will do that does the

tomorrow's questions before anyone's asked them how far is this from normal the 11th hour with Brian Williams weeknights on MSNBC the Rachel Maddow Show only on MSNBC don't you love that music it means just 29 days to go before the midterm elections so all week long we're looking at 18 key House races in the 18 most competitive districts of 2018 today the focus is on California's free eight there may be no incumbent in the country more controversial than this guy Republican Dana Rohrabacher in the district Hillary Clinton won in 2016 Republicans are now in grave danger of losing its a seat that was once a stronghold of Reagan conservativism and guess who's here to talk through it MSNBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki at the big board for us Steve we're getting closer and closer to like the mini Super Bowl before the 2020 Superbowl walk us through this district and its national implications here yeah you're right eighteen districts so we got to look at before 2018 we want to focus in on an you mention this one is so interesting look geographically you're talking about a very small part of California but this is Orange County densely populated you know coastal area the Beach Boys used to sing about this the 48th district here one fun fact about it it's the home of the Surf City surf dog competition so we thought we'd show you a surfing dog so if you if you ever heard a Beach Boys song and you can see the the the surfing dogs too but yes let's talk politics here Dana Rohrabacher has been the congressman from this district or this area I should say for 30 years now he was first elected in 1988 and in the course of those 30 years the demographics and the politics of this part of California have just changed dramatically you mentioned this was the heart of Reagan conservatism Orange County California look as recently as 2012 Mitt Romney was still able to win this district by double digits but you look at 2016 this is one of those areas across the country there are 25 districts in the country that are like this Hillary Clinton won it in 2016 but the Republican incumbent did two Republican House seat Hillary Clinton district Harley ruda the Democratic candidate he remembered Emma they have that whole jungle primary top two primary and California Democrats were a little worried who they were gonna nominate though they seem to have gotten the candidate out here a lot of money behind Harley Ruda in this race so this is one of those and I should say as well that wasn't supposed to happen I should say as well the other interesting thing about this race too is it's one of seven in California that are like this the Democrats are targeting Republican held won by Hillary Clinton so how is it looking well you're seeing a couple things here it did even most recent poll this came out just a couple days from the LA Times the power of incumbency the residual power of the Republican label in this district but Harley rooted counting on changing demographics and democratic energy Steve what are you talking about tomorrow you're coming back on the show right all week long yeah right so we're we're doing I think we have 18 districts coming up we want to surprise you every day I don't want to give it away just yet but the idea here is they are 18 they're the most competitive generally also the most interesting we have some wild cards in there it may not be on everybody's radar right now but maybe you want to keep an eye on as we head into election night that's a hell of a tease my friend I'll be here tomorrow you'll be here tomorrow well - thank you sir appreciate it let me bring in now Tom Steyer president and founder of next-gen America and the liberal billionaire leading a campaign to impeach President
