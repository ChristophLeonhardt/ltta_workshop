so I have a couple updates for you on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's race her election her current situation so how's this for an awesome story shockingly she says and I'm told this is not a joke we have also won a primary in the neighboring 15th congressional district via write-in campaign on the reform line while I am honored that so many Bronx sites is that a word whatever it makes sense are excited about our campaign I will remain the DEM nominee for New York 14 and then you could see there she's responding to ken Lovett who said exclusive Alexandria Ocasio Cortes with another surprise election win in a district she wasn't even running in so what happened was the Reform Party said all right you know what we don't have a candidate so just write in whoever you want and then whoever wins will be our nominee and it now this is this isn't that big of a deal because they're only like 22 or something like that right ins and she happened to get the majority of them so it to be clear it's not like thousands of people came out and they were like oh Alexandra I would need you you know 22 people went out they live in the Bronx or like I like the one that just won in the other place okay Alexandra Ocasio Cortez but it's so cool it's cool because it shows you that you can actually generate excitement if you have politicians who are willing to fight for the people and who are correct on the issues Alexandria in no uncertain terms is running on Medicare for all free college a living wage legalizing marijuana abolishing ice ending the drug war and by the way let's be clear about abolishing ice that does not mean abolishing borders she's not in favor of abolishing borders so there's a lot of misinformation now out there about Alexandria and what she believes because Alexandria got the backing of democratic socialists of America listen if you get the backing of democratic socialists of America that doesn't mean that you agree with every single policy position in democratic socialists of America and she certainly does not believe in open borders some of the other stuff ice was created in 2003 by the Bush administration Customs and Border Protection they protect the border if you get rid of ice it's not that you get rid of all borders and all border protection and in fact ice and we've covered this story before on the show there's accusations that they're currently engaged in slavery and the case has merit a judge ruled yep that appears to be slavery this case can proceed so there is forced labor going on with ice so it's not it's an extremist organization it started in 2003 under the Bush administration it's it's rife with abuses it doesn't mean getting rid of all borders so everybody just needs to understand that but this is a random side point that I'm making if you fight on the issues that matter to people you're gonna win and you're gonna generate excitement and that's exactly what she did so she happened to win in the neighboring district which is kind of Awesome but she actually had to speak up and say no I'm rejecting this because you're not allowed I think to be a candidate in two districts at the same time or whatever so what it created some sort of legal issue but this leads to our next story which is not a phone story alexandria says and this is just today representative Joe Crowley stated on live TV that he would absolutely support my candidacy instead he stood me up for all three scheduled concession calls now he's mounting a third party challenge against me and the Democratic Party and against the will of the Working Families Party so what happened here is the Working Families Party and I didn't know this but now I do and I am super pissed the Working Families Party which is to the left of the Democratic Party and it's very active in New York and they've reliably been you know more on the correct side of issues at least to this point as far as I could tell what happened is they endorsed Crowley over Ocasio Cortes shame on you working families party shame on you but anyway I digress from that bottom line is working families party endorsed Crowley obviously Crowley lost but he stays on the ballot for the general election so the Working Families Party reached out to Crowley and was like okay dude you lost so we're gonna recommend that you take your name off the ballot Crowley says no what do you mean no apparently he has to go agree to get that name off the ballot they just can't take his name off the ballot Crowley says no stands up Ocasio core test three times like she says for concession calls what does that mean that means he's gonna keep his name on the ballot and if he happens to win go whoa whoa well shucks I didn't know that this situation is unfold I guess that I mean I guess I gotta go back now I guess I gotta go back to to Congress what are you gonna do so it's his last trick up his sleeve a slimy sleazy motherfucker what happened to born to run remember that the day that he lost you know I'm gonna dedicate this Alexandria Ocasio Cortez he sings Bruce Springsteen's born to run what happened to that I'll tell you what happened to that you're a scumbag that's what happened to that you're a narcissist these guys are so sickening Alexandria is running for all the right reasons because she cares deeply about the policies and improving people's lives corrupt Joe Crowley is a narcissist who thought he was quote destined for democratic leadership so it's all about self aggrandizement with him so he's like I don't care if I happen to get in there in a sleazy way I'll do it and by the way this is what everybody said oh is Bernie Sanders gonna spoil it for Hillary Clinton and run third party is that what's gonna happen oh these guys they use such dirty tactics on the left don't they well here you have a corporate Democrat doing it and he a motherfucking crickets bitch where's everybody at where's everybody at and what happened to unity what happened to unity how many times have you heard the whales and the cries and the screaming and the yelping uh we hear that all the time notice those calls only go in one direction like the band One Direction that's it they live all in one direction its own it's always only the corporatist and the establishment screaming at people on the left why don't you follow what about you you got I believe in you do you believe in unity apparently you don't believe in unity cuz notice whenever the person who's further left wins mum's the word you don't even know what that is guys and this is why I said from the beginning and some people disagreed with me but I would just say you're fucking wrong this isn't justice Democrats was never about oh well we're gonna get in there gosh golly and we're gonna work with the establishment Democrats and we're gonna make this thing okay oh I'm not naive the idea is a hostile takeover of the party you want to know why cuz the second they have any he sees a little lane to drive through and he's like I'm going to the who this is this is what they do so okay two can play at that game you want to play that game let's play that game no I'm not looking to hold your hand and I'm not looking to make deals with you when you're wrong on the issues and you're bought I'm looking to get get you out of the party make the democratic party what it should have been all along a populist Left party so I'm not I'm not interested and listen this is why you know she was out Alex was asked recently about Nancy Pelosi Oh what do you think about Nancy Pelosi as leader and she dodged the question and she was like well listen you know I'm not there yet so we shouldn't even be having this conversation so on and so forth that's all fine and dandy and listen she definitely has a way of getting people who would normally dislike her in the mainstream to actually like her like she's made joy in read like her which is like wow you were pretending she didn't exist when she was up against corrupt Joe Crowley but Alex I would tell you you have to you have to be honest in these interviews and be like no I don't think Nancy Pelosi should be leader of the Democratic Party why because you're correct to say that because Nancy Pelosi is approval rating is like negative 4312 she's a paper tiger no you know what she's not a paper tiger she's a tiger made of money that's what she is that's all she has I got all my corporations behind me and zero people power she's a dinosaur she's ancient she's nothing but propped up by the establishment and big money and the more you call that out the more popular you become you're not like this idea of like you better play nice miss new miss new lady on the block you better come in I saw articles like alec Alexandria Ocasio Cortez refuses to take the bait to bash Democrats bash away that's a way these people aren't popular you think Lita Democratic leaders are popular they're not popular at all the more you go after them which you should do the more popular you'll become we got to be clear about what we're standing for now she does that with policies but she reminds me a little bit of Bernie Sanders and that she'll do she'll do with the policies and he'll do with the policies but then it's like we'll walk on eggshells a little bit when it comes to going after Democratic leadership but actually she's better than Bernie and here's why she's helping all these other justice Democrats it's not like she got in and she's like okay spotlights on me and now I'm only gonna focus on me no she said Abdullah Saeed running for governor of Michigan great candidate justice Democrat Medicare for all free college living wage fighting for all the right policies no corporate PAC money he's the man go vote for him and she's done it with a bunch of them and by the way go to justice Democrats calm and you need to see all the justice Democratic candidates because the next Ocasio Cortes is out there whether it's Brent welder whether it's con yella Inge whether its abdullah al saeed so you go to just democrats calm and check it out and see because you can get involved you can canvass for them you can support them you can there's a million ways you can get involved so alex is doing a fantastic job on that front I just wish you would actually go after Democratic leadership because her approval rating would go up and also Alex you don't think the other ones would try to pull a joke rally on you if they could they can't wait to see this is Joe Crowley being corrupt Joe Crowley this is what he does corrupt corrupt guys are gonna corrupt that's what it is you think Nancy Pelosi wouldn't find a way to stab you in the back and be a weasel that's all she wants to do to you she despises you she just you're a threat to her existence in Congress of course she despises you you're the deer of the future you're the future you think they're not threatened of course they're fuckin threatened so listen if you support Alexandria the fights not over now corrupt ro Crowley's back in he's back in go-to Ocasio 2018 dot-com and throw her five bucks throw over ten bucks you know cuz she needs you again how much did he out raise her by he had what three million dollars or something like that and she had three hundred thousand I'm probably fuckin up those numbers I might be confusing it with another race but she he outspent her by a tremendous amount of money and she managed to pull it off well if he's gonna mount another run he's probably gonna double his efforts triple his efforts so it's not over it's not over so get involved throw over five or ten bucks help her out however you can because the establishment is not gonna go quietly into the night what they're gonna do is break out the daggers and the fangs and they're gonna come after us so I say we go after them and we go after them twice as hard
