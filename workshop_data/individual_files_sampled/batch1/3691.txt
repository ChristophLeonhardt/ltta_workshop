Appl change up the way it introduces new iPhones this year with a lower price model called the iPhone 5c on the inside the iPhone 5c is almost the same phone as the iPhone 5 it has the same processor and the same camera the only difference is a slightly larger battery and an improved front-facing camera for video chats but the biggest changes on the outside the 5c is wrapped in shiny plastic that comes in five color options green blue yellow pink or white and the plastic feels pretty good it's not bendy and flimsy like these Samsung phones are instead it feels really solid in the hand almost like it's ceramic and it's reinforced with steel on the inside so it doesn't bend or move when you grip it and maybe the cheaper have apples to bones but it definitely feels like a premium device the screen is the same as the iPhone 5s - it's four inches which is tiny compared to phones like the Samsung Galaxy s4 and other Android phones the 5c also ships with iOS 7 the glitzy new operating system for iPhones and iPads and playing on the colorful hardware theme each 5c ships with a wallpaper to match the outside other than that the 5c is the exact same phone Apple gave us last year it's a little more eye-catching thanks to the shiny plastic but it can't do anything the iPhone 5 can't so is it any good of course it is the iPhone 5c holds up really well even though it's essentially running ural of hardware you're still getting access to the best apps from Apple and all the other great Apple services the iPhone 5c starts at $99 on contract but if you're deciding between that and the new iPhone 5s you're probably better off with the 5s it only costs $100 more as a better camera and the fingerprint sensor that lets you unlock your phone with a passcode
