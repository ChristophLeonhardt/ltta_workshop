in 2014 the entertainment world was shocked to see a two million dollar production pulling over 65 million worldwide x' and ticket sales alone predictably this movie God's not dead was trashed by the critics even with the incredible success it's very interesting to see these critic elites he preys on box office massacres while these same elites lambaste movies that the viewers rally behind and absolutely love why is that maybe we'll get another clue to this mystery after God's not dead a light in darkness hits theaters March 30th will the people rally behind this movie what will the critics say about this and is it a movie worth watching I just came from the premiere in Los Angeles so let's get into it I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood God's not dead a light in darkness was directed by Michael Mason this is the third movie in the god's not dead installment I also want to just point out it is so hysterical for me to read the critic elites review of many of these movies and it's not just Christian movies that get this it's movies like a death wish like I covered earlier they get slammed by the critics while being praised and supported by all the viewers that love it you also see the kind of slanted reviews towards Marvel movies that are Disney that lean more left in DC movies that lean a bit more right and now the critics never seem to give it a fair shake while also heaping praise and worship on movies that I think are absolutely terrible that the box office also says are terrible because they make absolutely no money all this to say this does not just happen to Christian movies and Christian themes it's all about the values and of course that is something that the left always seems to attack and many of these people that are really these movies are a little bit left but I digress let's not talk about those reviewers let's talk about the rebel review as a viewer I'm gonna give God's not dead a light and darkness a 4 out of 5 now as someone who has seen the first two God's not Dez I think the third one is the most entertaining and well-done of the three they do this by having a really entertaining narrative that is grounded in something that is very current and gives you both sides of the argument debate to keep you kind of on your toes and engaged they also do a good job of multiple storylines even though I think there's a few that didn't quite need to be there which makes it lag a little bit in the middle there are still compelling characters and situations that everyone can latch on to the movie also really looks great and keeps a complicated story moving till the end my critic review is a three out of five now I think the best part of this movie was the situational conflict that was completely in the hands of the writer who did a great job of bringing this situation to life and giving both sides credence the center in heart of the story is a debate people on both sides and they become increasingly polarized and driven apart when we just stopped screaming at each other we can find a way to work together and love to make the entire community and the culture and the country and everything better because of that I had to say the best performance in this movie was John Corbett you might remember him from My Big Fat Greek Wedding he was absolutely hysterical in this movie drove all the scenes and was just fantastic to watch from start to finish and they did a good job of - including characters that are more dynamic and complex no one was really flat and that's something that happens unfortunately a lot of faith-based films and even you know horror films or whatever them they just try to go for a specific theme or niche is that they don't make the characters rounded they try to make this guys the bad guy this guy's the good guy and there's no really reasons for it we just need these characters to fight in the movie in this movie they do not do that which is fantastic every character is deep they change the dynamics they move they have you know reasons for their actions and I really accredit that to the writing and the production team on God's not dead I'll light in darkness which is the third my faith in values is a zero out of just kidding it is a five out of five now I'm not giving this movie the score just because the central character of the movie is a pastor no I'm giving it to the movie because of the values for one reason as much as the postmoderns try to complain and argue against it it is without question that Western civilization everything that it accomplished and even the foundations of the United States itself is on judeo-christian principles with a little sprinkle of Aristotelian thought and because of that even if this film didn't even say Jesus or God or talking about the Bible or take place in a church if it was a different situation if it was landed in a different place with a different character but the story was still the same those values would still be there if you people can believe in those values and live by those values that we all need to rally behind that is the foundation of Western society and American all kind of stuff but you're not going to get to the genesis of why these are great until you dig into Scripture and find that base and that source which is the judeo-christian values but I would still definitely give this film a really really high rating in values in faith even if they didn't talk about it but specifically this has fate that makes it a little bit easier to pick apart and tell you exactly why it is definitely a timely message and a message that I think people outside and in the church can definitely take benefit from but that's just my opinion and on March 30th you can check it out and let me know what you think if you completely disagree or if you think I am right on the money I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood if you haven't done it already you can now download the rebel media app that way you have access to the entire rebel lineup and can take it with you wherever you go you
