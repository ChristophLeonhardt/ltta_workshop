Fox News is now running propaganda for North Korea if you don't believe me check out this segment that they recently did that had absolutely no news value whatsoever turns out Kim jong-un is quite the romantic the North Korean dictator taking his wife on a tour of a fish pickling Factory state media releasing the photos to showcase what the rogue regime considers his economic strength they did the same thing in 2014 when Kim visited a lubricant factory and when he visited a plan that makes potato starch let silk your headlines I'll send it back to you couple of times you've seen him it's been out with the people took a manufacturing now with the missiles and and he's wearing a t-shirt and a belt and those come in packs of three Hanes oh my god what was that what was the news value of talking about a dictator going to a fish pickling plant with his wife how romantic okay like first of all this is a smaller point but I got to get it out of the way like let's put aside the fact that this guy is a dictator who has concentration camps throughout his country okay who brutalizes his own people let's put that aside for a second even if he wasn't that you really think taking your wife to a fish pickling plant is romantic I was thinking is fish pickling have a second meaning yeah and that's a look at your headlines that's a headline really that's what Americans should know about that was a men Ainsley Earhardt or whatever the hell her name is right he's wearing he's wearing a shirt and a hat Wow good job congratulations there's such a great reporter this is this is pathetic what was that okay so if I'm being super kind to them I said well they were joking about how it was romantic and they were laughing etc but like but Anna's right why did you run that story you have week everybody that's in news has a production meeting where you decide which stories are gonna run why did you decide to do a fawning piece about a dictator I don't know and then you had such little things to say about it that you start to say look a t-shirt and a belt this is crazy what why why is that a noose but yes he has earned a belt like other human beings so now if they'd always been pro dictator by the way communist dictator I could understand I can't I don't know why you would be okay but but from what I understand they don't like communism or socialism I they say it all the time and then when it comes to at people like Maduro and Venezuela oh that is almost right but Ana they didn't they never said that about kim jeong-hoon before right now this guy know what's what's fascinating is that in February of this year this year the very same show with the very same host also talked about Kim Jong hoon but there was something really different in their coverage of Kim Jong hoon let's take a look let's talk about some of the headlines that are stunning and aggravating to many people here in our country and clear thinking people maybe even in South Korea they are hailing Kim jong-un's sister who is appearing in this Olympics to 27 years old representing North Korea they are calling her the Ivanka Trump of these games here's an example the New York Times writes this Kim jong-un's sister turns on the charm taking pensive spotlight Reuters says North Korea judged winner of dimple at diplomatic gold at Olympics The Washington Post the Ivanka Trump of North Korea captivates the people in the south this is the dictators sister this is this is an embarrassment that is ridiculous she oversees propaganda for that country the country that enslaves people the country that starves people we saw what happened to otto warmbier right now keep in mind as she did make headlines by appearing in the presidential box at the opening of the Olympics that was great that was a step forward and she did also that's the image I'm talking about why is that great I don't even think she should be there well because they have a unified Korea that is appearing at the Olympics that big show but here's well it is propagates all propaganda news busters refers to her as North Korea's head of their propaganda and agitation department you know what that's kind of what's happening right gee I wonder what could have changed from February of this year to today why did Fox and Friends all of a sudden change its tune on Kim jong-un and then all of a sudden run a piece that had no news value and was nothing but Pro Kim jong-un propaganda she said in the middle there that it was embarrassing you know what's embarrassing going from a dictator who enslaves his own people and starves them to he's wearing a t-shirt and belt oh how romantic of fish pickling factory because your beloved dictator wannabe came out and said now i like kim jeong-hoon before he was calling him rocket man and you were doing ironically propaganda right and by the way I didn't love the mainstream media coverage of Kim jong-un back there we're consistent on this right but you guys go from like how can you believe they're doing positive coverage of kim jeong-hoon to hoon real to easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber
