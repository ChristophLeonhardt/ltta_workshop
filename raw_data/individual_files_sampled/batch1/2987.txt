my name is Dan Buettner I'm a National Geographic Explorer and the author of Blue Zones of happiness lessons from the world's happiest people I actually think most of the previous stories about Danish happiness were wrong the first stories were that Danes are happy because they have low expectations nothing could be further than the truth every Dane from the moment they're born expects free health care free education when they get into college they expect to be paid to go to school if they have a child they expect to have 10 months of paid maternity or paternity leave and they expect to be able to retire absolutely securely for the rest of their life it's huge expectations what makes Danes happy I believe it's because their government takes care of all the necessary go to wrong in their lives they're free to pursue a job that really speaks to their passions but actually Denmark is a place where ambition is not greatly celebrated so people aren't in the rat race they're not always buying new clothes and new cars and trying to keep up with the Joneses and that gives them more time to pursue their interests so you have a country year where people are good at architecture and they create the best restaurants in the world and furniture design and these are jobs suggestive of flow of optimal using your talent so that time can have absolutely disappear when it comes to happiness I think we often think of it as the attainment of joy but actually the bigger part of happiness is getting rid of the stresses of our daily life so this notion of having your health insurance cover your education and covered in your retirement cover is actually very huge you
