TUCKER. Tucker: TRACE GALLAGHER, THANKS FOR THAT. THE PIPE BOMBS OF COURSE ARE ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF ATTEMPTED AND ACTUAL POLITICAL VIOLENCE WE'D SEEN. ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE WAS A ATTEMPTED MASSACRE IN THE SUMMER OF 2017, SO CONGRESSMAN STEVE SCALISE WAS GRAZED THOUGH MY GRAVELY WOUNDED. IN RESPONSE TO THE PIPE BY MAILING HE TWEETED "THESE ATTEMPTED ATTACKS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OR BEYOND CRIMINAL, THEY ARE ACTS OF TERROR. IT VIOLENCE AND TERROR HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR POLITICS OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN OUR SOCIETY. THE CONGRESSMAN JOINS US TONIGHT. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON. WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION WHEN YOU SAW THIS NEWS TODAY? ITS ANGER. THIS ISN'T THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT AMERICA TO BE TURNING. YOU ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS AND CLEARLY YOU ARE SEEING IT ON BOTH SIDES. WE ALL NEED TO BE CALLING IT OUT. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FBI IS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IT. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO FIND OUT WHO DID THIS AND IF IT'S ONE OR MULTIPLE PEOPLE, TO BRING THEM TO JUSTICE AND DO IT AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE. Tucker: 'S OF THE CONDEMNED THESE ACTS AND WAS IMMEDIATELY REBUKED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FORWARD CONDEMNING THE ACTS NOT QUITE ENOUGH, WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? I THOUGHT THAT WAS A MISTAKE ON THEIR PART TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT. I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE PRESIDENT DID COME OUT WITH A STATEMENT THE WAY HE DID, STRONGLY. I HEARD SILENCE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE UNDER ATTACK FROM DEMOCRAT LEADERS. WE ALL SHOULD BE CALLING THIS OUT. WHEN A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT IS UNDER ATTACK FIRST OF ALL, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO DID IT. WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT BUT WE SHOULD BE CRITICIZING THE ACT WHETHER IT'S A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. SOME PEOPLE ONLY CRITICIZE WHEN IT'S A DEMOCRAT UNDER ATTACK. AND THE MEDIA, BY THE WAY, WAS UNDER ATTACK AND THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THAT EITHER. Tucker: HOW DO WE DE-ESCALATE THIS? THINGS SEEM TO BE MOVING IN A DIRECTION THAT'S OMINOUS AND SO WHAT OUR LEADERS NEED TO DO TO PULL US BACK TO I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET BACK TO WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT. OUR FOUNDERS DIDN'T SET UP SOME KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE EVERYBODY HAD TO THINK THE SAME WAY. IN FACT, THEY CHALLENGED THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THEY WANTED A SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE CAN SPEAK THEIR VIEWS AND EVEN SPEAK OUT AGAINST THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THEY PUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT ULTIMATELY IN THE CONSTITUTION TO ENSURE THAT RIGHT BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS WE ALL HAVE OUR DISAGREEMENTS. YOU SHOULD NEVER MAKE THOSE PERSONAL AND YOU SHOULD NEVER THINK THAT VIOLENCE IS A WAY TO SETTLE OUR POLITICAL DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCES. WE SETTLE THEM AT THE BALLOT BOX. WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN 13 DAYS, THAT'S WHERE WE SETTLE OUR DIFFERENCES. VIOLENCE IS NEVER AN ANSWER TO SOMEBODY'S POLITICAL DISAGREEMENT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. Tucker: IT'S A WISE AND INTERESTING POINT YOU MAKE. YOU ARE SANE PEOPLE FEEL LESS FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS NOW THAN THEY HAVE IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND THAT PART OF THE REASON THINGS ARE SO VOLATILE? WHEN SOMEBODY TRIES TO USE THREATS OR INTIMIDATION IF LIKE THE SCHOOLYARD BULLY. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO CONFRONT THEIR OWN DEMONS THEY TRY TO THREATEN YOU AND SCARE YOU AWAY FROM JUST LIVING YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE AND THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. YOU SAW AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH WHEN OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE WAS UNDER ATTACK BY PEOPLE WHO HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT OF AMERICA AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR AND WE CAME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY AND WE SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN, WE ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHO WE ARE AND WE SHOULDN'T DO IT HERE EITHER BUT WE SHOULD BE EQUALLY VIGILANT. REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT, NO MATTER WHO WAS UNDER ATTACK, THAT IT'S WRONG FOR WHOEVER DID THE ATTACK. IT LETS FIND OUT THE DETAILS, DON'T TRY TO DEFLECT BLAME TRY TO BLAME SOMEBODY ELSE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. LET'S ACTUALLY GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO DID. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND COMING TOGETHER AS AMERICANS AND AGAIN, IT'S NOT ABOUT PHILOSOPHY. I'M A CONSERVATIVE, I HAVE LIBERAL FRIENDS. I DISAGREEMENTS WITH THEM BUT I DON'T MAKE IT PERSONAL AND NONE OF US SHOULD MAKE IT PERSONAL. WE SHOULD WANT TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT. GET THE FACTS. DON'T GO TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. LET'S ALL BE FOCUSED ON COMING TOGETHER IN FINDING OUT WHO DID IT AND BRINGING THEM TO JUSTICE.
