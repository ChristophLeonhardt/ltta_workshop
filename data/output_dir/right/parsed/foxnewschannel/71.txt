THAT AS WELL.
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, THANK YOU.
LET'S BRING IN GEORGIA
CONGRESSMAN DOUG COLLINS.
MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE RIGHT ON TIME WITH
THIS TOPIC, GREAT TO SEE YOU
TODAY.
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT ROSENSTEIN JUST IN TERMS
OF A SARCASM MOMENT, IT WAS A
JOKE.
I WOULD THAT MATTER IF YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT WEARING A WIRE TO
RECORD THE PRESIDENT AND
INVOKING THE 25TH AMENDMENT TO
GET OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE?
THE SARCASM, DOES JOKING MATTER?
>> FOR HIM, IT SHOULD NOT.
ESPECIALLY IN ENVIRONMENT LIKE
WE HAD WHICH IS INSIDE THE DOJ
TO BE PARTISAN AND VERY MUCH
AGAINST HIM THAT WE FEEL IS A
BILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
FOR HIM TO EVEN JOKE IF HE DID
SO WAS A WRONG JOKE AND I THINK
THIS IS WHY THIS NEEDS TO BE
CONSIDERED AND MOVED FORWARD
BECAUSE HE SHOULD BE DOING
THINGS LIKE THAT.
EDGES UNDERMINES CONFIDENCE IN
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NO JOKE OR
JOKE.
>> Harris: JUST IN TERMS OF
GETTING TO THE TRUTH OF THE
FACTS HERE.
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE
SIMPLE QUESTIONS AS HE NEEDS
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE
CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION.
LIKE WHY WOULD THAT IS SARCASM
OR A JOKE EVEN BE FUNNY?
WHAT WAS THE CONTEXT IS
IMPORTANT.
>> THE CONTEXT IS ALSO IMPORTANT
BUT WE SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO,
AND MAY BE IMPORTANT AND IT WAS
A BIG JOKE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS SAYING
I'M GOING TO WEAR WIRE WITH THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND LOOK TO SAY I WILL HELP
INVOKE THE 25TH AMENDMENT,
YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT
TEARING DOWN THE VERY FABRIC IN
THE VERY LEADER OF OUR FREE
WORLD.
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING EVEN A
CONTEXT THAT SHOULD BE ALLOWED.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE
OFF LIMITS.
HE MAY WANT TO SAY I WAS JOKING
BUT THAT IS REALLY A DISTINCT
SIGN OF POOR JUDGMENT WHEN YOU
TAKE THAT ALONG WITH EVERYTHING
ELSE THAT WE'VE SEEN GOING ON,
THIS MIX IS EVEN MORE
IDENTIFIABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M
GLAD THE CHAIRMAN IS WORKING ON
THIS, THIS IS THE FIRST STEP,
NOT THE LAST STEP AND WILL
CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AS
WE GO FORWARD.
>> Harris: SO WE KNOW THAT HE
WAS TALKING TO THEN DEPUTY
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI ANDREW
McCABE HE DOES MENTION HIS
NAME AND WHEN I SAY CONTEXT, I'M
CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
INFORMATION WAS THIS?
I WOULD IMAGINE IT WILL ASK
THOSE QUESTIONS.
THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO
UNDERSTAND, ROSENSTEIN IS A
STAFF MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT,
SO HE CAN FIRE HIM, HE CAN
REPLACE HIM.
IF THE CEO THOUGHT THEY WERE
GOING TO BE A CORPORATE CODE TO
GET HIM OUT OF THE POSITION, I
WOULD IMAGINE THAT PERSON WOULD
FIRE ANYONE WHO WOULD JOKE LIKE
THIS FOR SAY THIS AT ALL.
>> WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT
ACTUALLY SIT DOWN WITH
ROSENSTEIN AND ACTUALLY TALK
ABOUT THIS, THEY'RE WILLING TO
PLAY TOGETHER AND THIS IS
SOMEONE THAT YOU RIGHTFULLY SAID
CAN FIRE AT ANY MOMENT THAT HE
WANTS TO.
HE WORKS FOR THE PRESIDENT.
WE ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT THE
PRESIDENT HERE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS AN OUTSTANDING
JOB LEADING AND HE IS CONCERNED
ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
THE ECONOMY.
HE HAS STATED ALL ALONG THAT
THIS RUSSIA ISSUE ANY
INVESTIGATION WAS NOTHING TO
THEM.
HE WILL CONTINUE TO STATE THAT.
WE IN CONGRESS NEED TO DO OUR
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND
MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN CONTEXT,
BRINGING THESE PEOPLE BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE DOJ WAS
VIRTUALLY AT THE TOP OF THEM A
AND VERY CORRUPT.
WE ALSO NEED TO RESPECT THE
PRESIDENT HAS MADE A DECISION TO
KEEP HIM AT THIS POINT AND I
THINK THAT'S A BALANCE ON WHAT
WE'RE DOING DOING FROM OUR
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND
ALSO SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT AS
HE HAD KEPT THEM BY NOW.
>> Harris: YOU SAID A MOUTHFUL
THERE AND YOU MENTIONED THE
WORDS POLITICAL AND CORRUPT AT
THE TOP OF THE DOJ.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT AND
WHAT YOU INTEND TO ASK ROD
ROSENSTEIN ABOUT IT?
>> WE HAVE CONTINUED AND BEGUN
THIS PROCESS ALREADY.
I MADE IT CLEAR PETER STRZOK
ESPECIALLY SHOULD'VE NEVER NEVER
BEEN A PART OF THE INVESTIGATION
WHILE HE WAS OUT OF CLEARANCE
ARE OUT OF SCOPE ON HIS
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS.
HE COULD'VE CLEARED THAT UP
EASILY AND HE DIDN'T.
HE WENT AHEAD AND WAS PART OF IT
IN THE INTERNAL DYNAMICS OF THE
DOJ AT THE TIME ALLOWED THIS TO
HAPPEN.
WE HAVE SEEN CONVERSATION, WE'VE
SEEN TEXTS IN WHICH JOKES WERE
BEING MADE ABOUT OUR POLITICAL
SYSTEM.
WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF A
QUESTION MARK BEING LAID ON THE
TOP LEVEL OF DOJ AND FBI,
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT LOOK AT
THAT IS WRONG.
THEY WANT JUST AS THAT WAS THEIR
INTEREST AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE
TO GO BEFORE THERE IS NOT THIS
INTERNAL I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT WHAT HAPPENS HAPPENS
BECAUSE I WANTED TO INSIDE THE
DOJ AND OUT WITH THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WANT.
THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS ARE
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
SEEN SO MUCH TURNOVER IN MY SO
MANY HAVE BEEN FIRED OR LET GO
AND WE SEE THIS INVESTIGATION
CONTINUE.
>> Harris: NOW YOU WILL GET AN
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH ROD
ROSENSTEIN, WE WEREN'T SURE EVEN
A WEEK AGO IF THAT WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN AND NOW IT IS.
FROM THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA,
