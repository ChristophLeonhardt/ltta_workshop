it's obvious what this is Justin Trudeau is politicizing the entire government to politicize the entire country he is turning every aspect of the state into an ideological test for citizens and if you fail the test you are marginalized as a bigot and in this case you will lose thousands of dollars of money in government summer jobs grants to which you would otherwise be entitled well our docile national media doesn't much mine they are still too in love with Trudeau I'll never get tired of showing this picture of Paul wells and MacLaine's plus alfie Arad's or The Huffington Post just chumming around with Justin Trudeau goofing around they're their friends do you really think well so rad could ever would ever contradict their buddy they are his auxiliaries in the media and both of them also moonlight for the CBC by the way as well-paid panelist on CBC shows so they really do work for Trudeau they really do work for the government broadcaster not that they need to be paid to agree with their friend they obviously agree with them seriously out of the 200 or so journalists on Parliament Hill just speaking of reflecting normal Canadian values he's just a normal distribution how many of those 200 go to a church or a synagogue or a temple more than once a year to get to any they're all vacuous liberal globalist atheist elites I'm not even knocking that that's fine I'm just saying they're a political monoculture completely overlapping the culture of Trudeau and his staff there are no evangelical Christians there are no in the press gallery there are no Orthodox Jews there are no observant Sikhs so of course no one the press gallery would object to this attestation of moral belief they either have no moral beliefs or they love the fact that this is a liberal belief if this were Stephen Harper requiring people to say that they support the rights of a traditional family not that Harper actually ever made that an issue or if Harper demanded that citizens had to support even something that's pretty uncontroversial like supporting free speech or maybe the example of property rights you can imagine the calls of an authoritarian theocracy but when you're attacking moral conservatives or even just people who don't think they have to tell the government what the think about private things that they ought not to have to tell anything to the government let alone be tested for ideological purity before getting a grant the media doesn't care I mean not enough to end the fun selfies with the super fun Justin Trudeau p.m. that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
