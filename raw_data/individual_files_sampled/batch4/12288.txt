the cultural and moral center of America to me used to be New York you could argue and certainly journalistically that was the center New York it's now San Francisco because of the social media companies and the tech industry everything now is catered how is it gonna land on social media House Facebook gonna respond House Twitter gonna respond House Google gonna respond and so all of America is being reprogrammed to San Francisco values these are silicon valley-based companies with Northern California values that are being imposed on the rest of America and so the media used to have a liberal traditional liberal slant out of New York now it has a very radicalized extreme liberal slant coming out of San Francisco in Northern California and so ESPN has just been swept up in all of that from the attacks of Gawker to everybody being and interested in clickbait and how things land on without Twitter black lives matter couldn't exist it couldn't exist no one would buy that narrative that because again the stats speak for themselves let's say 700 people get killed by the police this year I think statistically four or 500 of them are gonna be white people - 300 are gonna be black people and then you know I don't know my math is right but those are black unarmed black people killed by the police last year was under 20 yes so it only on Twitter could that false narrative exist and it's because if you say something really extreme and left-wing and say that all the police force is the whole thing is just racism they just say that'll get retweeted and liked and shared all over social Twitter and social social media and the media is addicted to that going viral became the biggest thing in the world and the easiest way to go viral is to say something very radicalized and left-wing beebe lena dunham on twitter and you're sure to get 5 million Twitter followers
