but here's what I really want to show you I showed you the reaction from all of Arabia some anger some bluster but really not that much am i right i mean that egyptian response bla bla bla lawyers un i mean i will correct myself if there is a war or an Intifada overnight but right now it looks like trump just called everyone's bluff in the region it's stalled the strong now not obama the apologizer but louis i showed you the arabian reaction muslim reaction look at the Western liberal reaction NBC News the peace process is finished Wow that's not what anyone in the peace process said was it but NBC knows better by the way can I ask how long the peace process has to go without achieving peace before we can no longer accurate call accurately called the peace process if this law to move the embassy is now 22 years old and has never been acted on because people are afraid of upsetting the peace process I'm thinking it's a lot of process and not a lot of peace here's another NBC headline from Jerusalem plan undermined you as interesting credibility analysts saying oh well if analysts say then he's doomed isn't he don't upset the analysts funny Trump promised this in the campaign the Congress voted for this overwhelmingly how is keeping a long-standing promise at some political risk how does that lower Trump's credibility doesn't it actually enormous ly strengthen his credibility like when Ronald Reagan fired all those air traffic controllers who went on in the illegal strike he said get back to work or I'll fire you they didn't so he fired them it proved he meant what he said domestically that's when everyone said well Reagan serious and I don't know if you recall but the Soviet Union this is when they said oh we're dealing with the same Jimmy Carter anymore we're dealing with a strongman who means what he says now here's the first sentence on CNN President Donald Trump's fragile political standing among American voters may be about to cause dangerous reverberations in the Middle East even provoking the Pope to express concern hey did you know that Trump's political standing is fragile and this might topple him and he provoked the Pope I feel like it's October 2016 again and CNN is telling me that Trump has a 5% chance of beating Hillary Clinton because analysts say so that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
