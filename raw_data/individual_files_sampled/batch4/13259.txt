alright I think everything's workings or broadcasting to you semi live from Washington DC just a 5 mile walk from the embassy to Uzbekistan so if things go pear-shaped we can always get to Anna's Becca Stan who's interesting coming into the city last night you know it's if you've never been to Washington it's it's an impressive place you know it really is you drive in and you see the beautiful mall you see the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument and the Capitol kind of stretched out across across the city is really is a nice place and you sort of have that sense especially if you live in California where nothing seems real you think like oh yeah all this really happen there actually was a Lincoln and there actually was a Washington and all this stuff that we're yelling and arguing about actually had a source and people who took it seriously it reminded me of the enemies it's just a beautiful view and it reminded me of a an old 19th century hymn that has the line every prospect pleases an only man is vile in other words the view is great but people stink you know and it which which in turn reminded me that line reminded me of the opening of mr. Smith goes to Washington if you remember Jimmy Stewart is this kind of yokel that kind of Boy Scout who gets through a series of ridiculous events gets swept up into becoming a senator and he's a real believer in all the American ideals and he goes to Washington there's this long montage of him looking at all the monuments just so inspired by the words there and by the face of Abraham Lincoln and the people coming to visit the monuments and then of course for the rest of the picture he discovers that Washington is a sewer of corruption and thieves and criminals and so you know every prospect pleases and only man is vile and that's kind of its kind of like represents the both of those works of art gonna represent the distance between principle and humanity the monuments kind of represent the principles that we stand for and the people here as we know sockin are but but you know I always think when I'm talking about the government we shouldn't judge people in government too harshly because what when you judge people for abandoning their principles too harshly what you really are is you're judging yourself too well because it's easy to have principles sitting here behind a microphone it's easy to have principles on your couch it's it's not easy when your career depends on it when your job depends on it when your love life for your family depends on it and that's what you're watching with these guys these guys are fighting these political guys are fighting for their lives every day and one of the things that always is so shocking about Donald Trump is that he's obviously not a man of principle aside from the principle of winning and he doesn't pretend to be and that's the real question with Donald Trump is not whether if not pretending to have principles does that make him worse than everybody else in Washington or does it actually make him more honest than everybody else in Washington as we're watching this FBI scandal unfold and it's getting worse by the day really is and watching the Democrats scramble to cover it up a press scramble to cover it up I really think that maybe Donald Trump is is just just kind of doesn't wear the mask of Washington and I don't know if that makes him better or worse or just scary trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right it's mailbag day that means all your

here for the the prayer breakfast which is a really last year was a really nice occasion of my Senators Congressmen and the president and vice president get together and discuss God and last year there was kind of this really funny thing that happened it was Trump's first prayer breakfast and this the Senate chaplain was very impressive Navy admiral named Barry black got up and gave this beautiful stem winding speech that had everybody on there he on their feet shouting hallelujah their hands in the air and then Trump got up and he just he hadn't learned yet it was like a guy who didn't know which fork to use he hadn't learned yet the tone of the event and he came out and he said prayer I know shit they should pray for they should pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger because he took over in the apprentice and his ratings are tanking it's just like you just wanted to put your hands over your face because you just realized that guy just hadn't caught the tone of it now I keep saying Trump was a guy who learns that stuff and I'm sure this year that's not gonna happen I'm sure he will capture the tone perfectly I bet he does but you know does that mean that he has now learned to take things seriously that he didn't take seriously before that's kind of hard to believe I mean what he has learned is how to be President a little bit he has learned you know that there are certain things you don't say you don't make fun of God you don't make joke no people are serious about their God in America we are serious about our Constitution we're serious about our traditions and Trump just hadn't captured that just wasn't something that he's learned and like yeah you know this is this is the thing that the left is selling as a catastrophe for our country remember yesterday we played Chuck Schumer oh my gosh is the worst man ever to ever be president but he's not he's not he's not the worst man ever to ever be president he's just a guy who doesn't pretend to be a better man and then he is and that is unnerving even to me I mean this is something that I think everybody finds a little unnerving to have a president who doesn't really follow the script for what he's supposed to take seriously what he's supposed to be solemn about but you know it's hard for me to really wail I think it's hard for a lot of us to wail about this when we see that our last president who did have that master who didn't know what to say he didn't know the tone to take and how to talk and all this was actually a deeply corrupt guy was running a government that was deeply corrupt and as I keep saying it wasn't corrupt in the Clinton way where he was running it for money and trying to rip people off or anything like that he was a he he had principles he had we were talking about principles Barack Obama had principles they happen to be terrible principles but he was so sure of the rightness of his principles he was willing to abuse the levers of power to make sure that nobody got in his way so yesterday with all the just among the scandals that were taking place there were more memos from Romeo struck and Juliet page that loved her the FBI left the star-crossed FBI lovers whose whose way just never you know they never saw the way forward but they they were sending all these memos back and forth and they hated Trump and they wanted to stop him and at one point about two months before the presidential election Lisa Paige who was sleeping with struck she wrote to him and said she was working on a memo for then FBI director James Comey about everything that was happening in the Hillary Clinton email investigation because quote Obama wants to know everything that we're doing so why is that important that is important because a few months before that Obama was on TV and he said this is cup number 16 can you guarantee to the American people can you direct the Justice Department to say Hillary Clinton will be treated as the evidence shut goes she will not be in any way protect I can guarantee that and and I can guarantee that not because I give attorney general Lynch directive that is institutionally how we have always operated that I do not talk to the Attorney General about pending investigations I do not talk to FBI directors about pending investigations they we have a strict line and always have maintained it for those presidents just a button is up I guarantee it you I guarantee that there is no political influence in any investigation conducted by the Justice Department or the FBI not just in this case but in any case and she will all stop period and she will be treated no different heed full stop nobody gets treated differently when it comes to the Justice Department and it's the thing is while he was lying like a dog he sounded very presidential he sounded a lot more presidential than Trump has ever learned to sound and that really does make a difference you know I don't know what I can't look into Obama's soul I can't know what he believed in but he professed Christianity and I almost never heard him say anything positive about Christianity whereas Donald Trump has said things that to any Christians are sound ridiculous like at one point during the campaign he said he didn't need God's forgiveness he just tried to leap live so that he didn't need forgiveness and of course we all know that that's just not a Christian doctrine so it's it's weird it is weird to have a president who's standing up for religious rights who's defending religious rights and who's speaking now learning to speak these words but who obviously doesn't believe in things but it's no weirder than it was before with Barack Obama and so what you're really seeing what you're really seeing is a battle for your mind for your imagination you're seeing one side the left trying to implant in your mind that this is a break with what has happened before because it sounds like a break sometimes the way Trump talks it's a break and it's a catastrophe and instead they want you to be thinking in catastrophic terms they want you to be thinking in terms of crisis they want you to be thinking that everything that happens is a break from the past so I mean for instance yesterday there was this story you know and I feel two ways about the story there's a story the Trump was asking the military to prepare a big military parade in Washington and you know it goes right up my spine as an American I do not want a big man I love the military I'm so appreciative of what they do I talk about it all the time I'm glad they pay tribute to them at the Superbowl I'm glad they pay tribute to them on TV I'm glad there are commercials about them I don't want to see like a big trucks drive a tanks driving down Pennsylvania Avenue although it would be funny if somebody like a mascot dressed up in the big red button that Trump was gonna breast to blow up North Korea but that would be kind of funny if there's really a couple girls you know dressed in tights and a big and as a big red button on their head that might be really interesting but no you know I actually don't think that's a good idea I don't even know I think maybe Trump is trolling people because he must have known the way they were gonna react I was in a bar here last night and I've got stuck watching CNN which really is an experience they are amazing so here is CNN talking about this idea of having a military brain just listen to the way they are trying to instill panic in your mind we're getting more North Korean every day in this country I mean you know yesterday the president says people who don't cheer are unamerican and in treasonous and today we're gonna start having big parades with tanks and missiles and you know how people have to decide what whether they want to have that kind of country I mean we have a country where we celebrate our troops as as Barbara said when they come home from battle in lower Manhattan and we throw ticker tape but the idea in peacetime simply to have tanks roll through the streets of Washington that's to use a phrase that the president likes to use in my experience that's unamerican so it's on American it's North Korean returning into North Korea like I said I don't like the idea that much either but the Pat the idea that this is authoritarian you know where is the beef on this authoritarian thing where's the panic coming from for a guy who's cutting the government who's actually dialing back executive power even his own power he's dialed it back so that you heard their crack he made about Trump talking about treason if you didn't see this clip it's I always like Trump's antic humor you know he has this antique New York sense of humor that I can kind of identify with so he was talking about he was playing up the fact that the Democrats made fools of themselves during the State of the Union address and that they sat on their hands for the flag and for God and for better wages and better jobs and all the stuff he was making fun of that somebody called out and said it was treason and he picked up on that use that quote that so here's that cut they would rather see Trump do badly okay then our country do well that's what it means it's very selfish and it got to a point where I really didn't even want to look too much during the speech over to that side because honestly it was bad energy no it was bad energy you're up there you've got half the room going totally crazy wild they loved everything they want to do something great for our country and you have the other side even on positive news really positive news like that they were like death and an American an American somebody said treasonous I mean yeah I guess why not and we call that treason why not later the White House did say they were joking but not that was not enough to stop the panic you know if you are planning to learn something new this year or any year or any time you want

think treason he slipped into it while they were calling out um it's it's a terrible thing to say but of course the press goes insane the New York Times must have filled up their pages yesterday and today oh my gosh the president is calling us treason just for disagreeing now it's treason just for disagreeing Jeff Flake who I swear I swear Senator Jeff Flake is auditioning for a CNN job I swear he is why he is standing up in the Senate like making these speeches against the president against his own party he's got to be what what he wants to be one of those he's a Republican and he's hating Republicans too so he got up and said this about Trump's remarks I've seen the president's most ardent defenders used a now weary argument that the president's comments were meant as a joke just sarcasm only tongue-in-cheek but treason is not a punchline mr. president no I don't know it depends on the joke right what has branches and calls you dad a tree son nevermind but you know Democrats and the press have been using this forever when Donald Trump jr. when it was revealed he took that meeting all we heard was treason we made we actually put together a treason montages cut 14 listen to this you said earlier that this borders on treason does that mean that Paul mana for Jared Kushner are bordering on treason as well as along with Don Jr and then also that Michael Flynn is bordering on treason and that the President himself is bordering on treason the question of possible treason I haven't talked about treason before but we're getting close to that and we can also say that Donald Trump jr. on what he did was a threat to our democracy and borderlines reason there's outright treason I mean there is no question that what he is doing is giving aid and comfort to the enemy you told the Washington Post last week that quote there's a smell of treason in the air well you know a lot of people are afraid to use the T word treason but in the end that's what people are investigating that is potentially a violation of the Espionage Act yes treason so again and again we get the double standard when Trump is you know in the question the question is look after a year in which Trump has delivered on a lot of really good conservative you know agenda items the really question is is Trump really different or is it just they're selling him to us as a catastrophe I mean it's why isn't it a catastrophe when they do it when he and it is a catastrophe when he does it and some Republicans on the other side they have another argument which is really interesting jeremy boring made it at our State of the Union to God king of the Daily wire made the kind of this argument at our State of the Union you know jamberry that we were doing I've heard others make this among the kind of what used to be called the never Trump now they bridle when you call them never Trump but the anti-trump Republicans their argument is that yes Democrats do do this stuff but we're the good guys and we're supposed to do better stuff and we're not doing it and of course the argument against that is yes but you got a fight in a playing field that you're in my own feeling I've said this before is the Trump's rudeness isn't sensibility is lack a solemnity about American principle have actually been useful in breaking the mind prison breaking out of the mind prison of political correctness and putting the press on the defensive which really the Republicans have needed to do for a long time but like everything everything comes with a price nothing is free and Trump is this administration is bringing everybody down to that same level there's now nobody speaking at the level of the people I saw in those monuments of Lincoln and Washington you know that's not happening anymore but this said this and look this is a culture it's the culture the left helped to create you know the culture that made Trump and the Trump helped make is a culture that left was almost entirely in control of and so it's it's almost as if they set off a nuclear bomb and then this Godzilla of a president came and started tearing apart their city and you know they really did create the thing that they hate so much and they're still doing it they're still fighting for your imagination they do this every day and they do it better than we do it you know this was on MRC this site this site I love the media Research Council may or is it Center I always get to get it wrong but there's a show on television there was just showing some of the shows that are on television and one that just caught my eye is a show that is called the mick and and you know it's it's about these Irish guys I guess in Boston I think and and and they're just showing you how they're selling you like godlessness they're telling you it's smart and progressive not to believe in God listen closely to this dialogue it's a comedy show and it's about they take their little kid to church cup three I just listen to what they're selling you and they're doing this all the time house no I mean when you say it like that it sounds ridiculous has anybody even it seemed good then you're saying God all right he's in the candle you know people who make jokes about Arnold Schwarzenegger prayer breakfasts are created by culture like that and you know the reason they want your imagination is because your imagination is where your life begins you're Ahmet you know the things that you become begin in your imagination the things that you imagine that the way you behave you remember yesterday we played that hilarious cut it really was hilarious of Hillary Clinton saying that climate change was going to affect women more than men she had this picture of women like you know in this desert wilderness gathering grass for people to eat and you know all doing all these chores of like finding that you know extracting the food out of the ground I don't remember what she was saying but it was just hilarious was like this Mad Max world that the left imagines is coming if it's coming if we don't do everything they say and I essentially turn over our energy supplies and all that power over to the left the New York Times just just to show you how that imagination affects people the New York Times which is a former newspaper you may have heard of it they they wrote a an article the other day saying that people are not having children that the birth rate has gone down because of fears of global warming and they had these quotes in it I know that humans are hardwired to procreate said one woman but my instinct now is to shield my children from the horrors of the future by not bringing them into the world its internal protectiveness work I'm gonna shield my children by not having any children here's another one I've seen how Syrian refugees who are running from a devastating war are being treated imagine how my children will be treated if they have to flee their country due to extreme weather droughts lack of resources flooding this imagination this is the imagination of the left and it has an effect and they're selling it to you every day they're selling it to you with every little panicky report from CNN with every television show that tells you there's no god it's hip and cool to be to not believe everything they sell you is selling you this disaster scenario you have no control over and there's nobody there to help don't don't even don't even have kids don't even you know just get rid of the human race altogether it matters what's in your imagination and they know it I wish we did too speaking of the imagination you may imagine how terrified you're going to be when you wake up one day and find out it's Valentine's Day there's your girlfriend or your wife sitting there with that expectant little smile you know her lips trembling a little tear on the side you know just waiting for you to deliver it and you think like Valentine's Day I didn't know it was Valentine's that's why

your problems will be solved answers guaranteed 100% correct and will change your life on occasion for the better mailbag I just want to see how long if I just shouted it out of it take that but I just like to do this to Austin because I'm trying to kill him mail bag real quick and you're just gonna you're all right so I'm laughing but our first one I have this really sure we got one that was from someone who wanted to remain anonymous who was talking about the fact that she had wrestled with depression all her life and she was having suicidal thoughts I'm not gonna read the email because we've gotten a few like this and I'm always very wary of bringing them on the air you know I don't want anybody to think that you know I'm a doctor or psychologist or any of those things I'm none of those things and these are problems that you can't solve alone I always I try not to make a recommendation of getting help the last recommendation I make because I know sometimes it's difficult but the thing about suicide is I have worked for several hotlines and there are a lot of resources for people who are feeling suicidal or depressed you don't have to just go into therapy you can also call the national suicide hotline there's a text crisis text line you can do it by text if you want if you feel more comfortable doing that that's the Samaritans there's a lot of different places that handle suicidal ideas and it's a good place to go I can tell you as a person who had a troubled early life I mean I've always said I've lived two lives I feel at this point I've lived I'm almost in a third life at this point but the first part of my life was really difficult I did have suicidal thoughts I can tell you that I felt like I was in the blackest place imaginable and it turned out I was not I was actually very close to breaking out and having a much much better life the beginning of an actual new life so you should never ever give up if you're worried when the one thing this person said in her email was that she was worried about the mess she would leave behind suicide leaves a terrible mess your family will never get over it your friends we never get over it Briggs everything don't do it it is like what they know if they say it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem and look if you're if you're permanently depressed that may take some medication too I mean I'm a big fan of therapy instead of medication but sometimes I've heard that people use the medication so they can get enough energy to get the therapy and that can work too from Aubrey Oh magnificent and good luck by the way you know there's only there's only hope while there's life so stay around from Aubrey Oh magnificent Clavin I'm a new subscriber and incredibly excited to drink the tears of my enemies the leftist absolutely yours and Ben's podcasts have quite literally changed the way I think about just about everything and to that end I have a problem I never thought I'd face my son is six and quote wants to be a girl I'm in Canada and of course our government is all for taking our kids away if we don't jump on the transgender train how do I help him understand his identity and biology without schools and other institutions reporting me to our near fascist regime well you're right that is fascist it's child abuse kids say all kinds of things they go through all kinds of stages a six-year-old doesn't know what he is or what he wants to be that is not when you decide or really fully understand your gender you know you might say you might hear something and repeat it you might just realize you're getting a rise out of your parents and repeat it and look I don't know what your kid you know maybe your kid is gonna have gender dysphoria maybe he's gonna be gay I don't know any of those things but I'm just telling you at six years old that there's a very high possibility that this is going to pass and you do not want some gut fascist government moron imprinting this idea on his head while it just happens to be flying through that is child abuse it is wrong it is wicked and it shouldn't be done and what you can do instead is first of all you want it all Bree I am assuming Aubrey is a man's name yeah and you know what you want to do is you want to spend some time with your kid do you know kids kids don't learn by lecturing especially at that age they don't learn by you telling them that he's a boy don't say I want to be a girl don't say don't do that it just involve him in the manliness of even life involved in in sports play catch with and take him out in roughhouse with them be around be a dad you know I mean that's that is the most important thing you can do you know show him that you like being a guy show them what guys do and what they enjoy and you know the odds the odds are really high that this is just a phase that he's going through they really are high that that's all it is a passing fad if you don't get hysterical about it if you don't lecture them about it if you don't you know forbid him and wag your finger at him you're gonna be a lot better off just be a dad be there for him show them what a man is show him you enjoy it show them he can enjoy it too and have fun with them and keep him away from these child abusing leftist social justice warriors they should be put in prison for this it is just utterly wrong from Jeffrey Oh shiny don't master of words and also worlds by the way since we have discovered that you have written a large number of books we scoured our library system to find audio versions in my lap currently we have dynamite rode shotgun Ally damnation Street and the last thing I remember I have the titles in chronological order but we wanted to know which is your favorite and which one should we listen to first in order to properly initiate ourselves into the masterful mind of Clavin before you say another kingdom we've already used our two-week Christmas vacation listening to all thirteen episodes while driving from Illinois to Colorado and back an excellent excellent use of your Christmas vacation you know I never can say what a favorite book is your books are like children they really are you like them all in a different way and the thing is you've got three that are in actually in a trilogy and so they actually do have an order dynomite Road comes first shotgun Ally comes second and damnation Street come third they are a trilogy of detective stories I'm very proud of them I think you'll really enjoy them and there'll be a lot of fun but the last thing I remember is the start of a young adult tetralogy for books called the homeland ER series and those were very you know they were bestsellers they really did well and young adults like them but they also do appeal to adults but you've only got the first in a four book series so if you want to listen to the full trilogy you've got a dynamite rode shotgun alley and damnation Street and I think you'll like him get back to me let me know a like from clay dear godfather of bald I grew up in church and regarding money was taught that scriptures mostly negatively about it recently I've been listening to a lot of big-name successful people speaking about how the market is about to correct and hurt unprepared people the importance of entrepreneurship investing in assets and the work displacement that's coming in the not-too-distant future due to advancements in tech is it possible for someone who's been taught all their life that money is evil and to be satisfied just working to make others rich to become successful and make a good amount of money is this a goal that someone can aspire to while also honoring God absolutely I mean this is I I will tell you how I read the Gospels on this and the Bible on this you know they always quote this line the that money is the root of all evil but what it really says is the love of money is the root of all evil and when Jesus talks about money he he gives it far far far less importance than the spiritual things that you do so in other words if you are working for money you're probably gonna miss the mark if you're working just to make money but if you're working to do something with your life that you love even if it's investing I mean some people love investing if you're working to do something with your life that you love and do something that maybe is gonna help other people because of what you do and you make money of course you should take care of it of course you should you know ten ten to your money and tend to what makes your family thrive and what will give your family the good things in life the point about money is that it's not the target it's always you know Aristotle said this too he said that when people want money they really want the things that money can buy so you want good things from your family you want good things for the world you want to be able to give money away it's you know there's nothing there's nothing wrong with money unless it is becomes the center of your life when I see these guys who have billions of dollars and they worry about them whether they're gonna fall in the Forbes 500 richest people list then I see people wasting their lives the the other thing Jesus did say is don't worry about money that God will take care of you if you but but that doesn't mean that you just sit there and wait for money gold to fall out of the sky like in a Greek myth it means that you know you shouldn't be afraid you should do the things that you want to do and and work in a in a way in a calm way in a way that goes forward trusting you know what God made you to do you know you it's not hating money it's the if what you love is the money rather than the fact that it rewards your work and the fact that it can bring good things to your family that's where you start to go wrong when the money becomes the target I think that that's where you start to go wrong but you shouldn't you know you should take care of yourself and take care of your family dear supreme commander Clavin Noir of all things that isn't at least somebody got my titles right today I believe you are right when you say anger is the devil's cocaine my problem is that whenever my mother-in-law is around I want to run to the bathroom and snort a couple of lines of metaphorical cocaine she my mother-in-law is a truly damaged persons from war this truly damaged person without joy or hope and makes herself difficult to be around her interaction with us is always net negative she ridicules our Christian faith criticizes our parenting and is jealous of the life we've made in another state away from her I know I should be forgiving and patient with someone so joyless but I find myself angered now just at the sound of her name how do I let go of my anger and treat her as Christ would thank you for your amazing show I listen to every day well thank you for that first of all we're you know one of the names of Satan is the accuser they call him the accuser and one of the things he does is he makes you feel shame about things that you don't have to feel shamed about Annoying people are annoying and you're going to be annoyed but that is less the natural fact of things if you sit down to have a picnic and a bunch of bees a swarm of bees come by you're going to be put out you're gonna be annoyed if your mother-in-law is coming over and criticizing you and attacking you and hating on you and making you feel bad you're gonna be annoyed you can't help being annoyed so get rid of the part of the of the chain here where you bother yourself for being annoyed you really only have to take care of two things one is that you have to treat her kindly you have to treat her with respect look as you say this is a person who is really damaged who has really damaged her own life it sounds like by her philosophy she cut herself off from God she's cut herself off from faith and she's obviously quite angry I seems to me that this is a guess I don't know you guys but it guess a good guess I think that she's quite angry that you have become the chief female figure in her son's life and they have essentially replaced her that is the natural way of things that's the way things are supposed to be William Faulkner said a woman and her mother-in-law and natural enemies that's why so you know you want to treat her with kindness and patience and respect even though she's being critical and takes you off and the way you do that is trying you know and and listen and when you fail because she annoys you so much just move on and try again go back to the beginning and try again don't this is around beating up on yourself she's annoying you got annoyed that's okay but just try and treat her with kindness and respect because she has really not got a very good life and she's angry and jealous at you she's angry you took her son away and moved away and that you she feels that you're a better way of living is rejecting her which in a sense it is that's the first thing so you want to treat her with kindness respect the way you do this try to maintain a sense of humor try to tease her out of it a little bit try to talk to her about what's on her mind try to divert her from her criticism of you have to talk to her about what's in her life what she's thinking about you know listen listen to her you know talk about her life and her concerns and maybe you can get her off of like sort of anger training that she's obviously on herself the other thing though is that the anger feels bad if you're angry when you just hear I have a sound of her voice just your name that's anger this is going past what she's doing to you that's something that's happening inside yourself my guess my guess on this is that people get angry like that when they feel threatened your husband probably doesn't see all the stuff you see in his mother he probably has some more affection for her than you do he probably is more patient with her than you are maybe he's used to her he maybe doesn't see that she does this remember she does this to everybody he's not just you you're a special target because you took her son but you know she's like this with everybody but he may not see it so maybe you feel that she's wet edging in trying to get some power in your household that she has a previous claim on your husband so maybe you're afraid that that's gonna come back again it sounds to me like your husband and you were pretty solid that you've got it figured out that you know where you're going don't be afraid to talk to him about this about your fears about what makes you unhappy don't be afraid to talk to him not in an accusing way but in a collaborative way about things that he can do to help you out here and take some of the pressure off because I'm sure a lot of it is coming down on you make sure he understands how bad you feel about it and and try and work through what is making you angry where do you feel threatened you know where do you feel like she's got some power over you because real life didn't have any power she hadn't got anything you know you don't you don't need anything from her you guys have established a good life a better life and then she has had or will ever have and you should have some pity on her but she's gonna be annoying but just try and get rid of that that anger that's inside you that's beating you up when she's not around you know try to figure out why it's threatening to you and try to collaborate with your husband on ways to deal with her and that should do it I got to stop the mailbag I've got million more questions but I can't it is time for tickety-boo news so I love this I mean this is you know I'll read this from the New York Times because it used to be a newspaper and they covered this fairly clearly from the same pad where NASA launched rockets that carried astronauts to the moon a big new American rocket arced into space on Tuesday but this time NASA was not involved the rocket the Falcon Heavy was built by SpaceX the company founded and run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and this is so exciting to me because I think we need to go into space and I think that private enterprise is the way to get there there's going to be some government collaboration but private enterprises the way to go one of the reasons we went to the moon and then never did anything else again is because the government sucked all the talent into NASA they all concentrated and focused on going to the moon and then it became a government boondoggle we did nothing but go up and down to this useless semi useless space station for all this time it's time to go back to the moon it's time to get to Mars Trump is absolutely right about this let's watch a little bit of this rocket launch by Elon Musk here we go cheering on our chest boy and then you know he said he put a car in there or something like that something just for fun that he put it in them when they got back to their destination they actually took some pictures that were absolutely astounding you never know what you're gonna find you know the reason this is so exciting to me is this is the opposite of people not having children because of climate change the opposite of fear the opposite of don't touch anything this is the left that the left is already selling us don't touch anything you'll break it the earth is more important than you are the only thing that's important about the earth the only thing that's important about the earth is humankind and the only reason humankind's is important is because we are the ones who perceive what God perceives the beauty the good the morality everything else is there for us to perceive and we've always thrived by spreading out you know when Rome fell first before Rome fell first it had laid the seeds for a Roman Europe and when Europe destroyed itself in the two world wars before it did that it had colonized America and India and other parts of the world you know so if Hillary Clinton is going to be crawling around eating grass the rest of us want to move on and head into the solar system and populate it this is not the time not the time just to be afraid this is time to go forward all right I will go to the prayer breakfast I won't be back tomorrow I will be back on Friday to report on the entire thing and I
