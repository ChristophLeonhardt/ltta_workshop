there are new signs today that the president is starting to sweat special counsel Robert Miller's obstruction of justice investigation after the non negotiation negotiation over a presidential interview the president's lawyer last night described out loud and on television exactly what he's afraid of a Donald Trump ever sits for an interview Rudy Giuliani explained exactly how Trump could perjure himself and what the topic might be he's gonna ask him did you tell call me to go easy on Flynt the president say no I didn't hey Bob you know it why do you want to get him under oath you think we're fools do you want to get him on the rope cause you want to trap him into perjury we're not gonna let you do that questions truthfully that was Giuliani making clear that the president's lawyers do not want Donald Trump to answer questions about the Mike Flynn investigation questions we know to be of interest to Muller based on a list of topics and questions shared by Muller with Donald Trump's lawyers earlier this year instead though Giuliani and Trump launched a fresh round of attacks against Muller the president today tweeting quote this is an illegally brought rigged witch-hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted it was started and paid for by crooked Hillary and the Democrats phony dossier FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired seven angry Dems stay tuned stay tuned stay tuned for what it was an attack previewed by Giuliani last night kind of get any worse I mean what do we need to know that this is a totally illegitimate investigation based on a report a dossier that was paid for by Hillary Clinton far the biggest collusion so far or conspiracy completely made-up completely made-up led to nothing except several fraudulent Pfizer wires and now we have Muller who doesn't seem to care that he's sitting on top of a totally illegitimate investigation but think about the dossier that she paid for and the fact that the FBI paid Steele it was designed to miss inform the American people with Russian lies to influence the election yes there's a great irony here if it wasn't well maybe maybe maybe if Muller and his band of of whatever they are Democrats right we're fair-minded maybe they'd investigate maybe that's the collusion maybe that's the collusion oh my god really needs to check his carbon monoxide monitors the surest sign yet the team Trump knows it has problems look over there the collusion the obstruction they're somewhere over there here to explain the latest outbursts and nonsensical lunacy from the president his lawyer over the Muller probe some of our most favorite reporters and guests Ashley Parker White House reporter at The Washington Post Chuck Rosenberg a former US attorney and senior FBI official now an MSNBC contributor at the table AP White House reporter Jonathan Lemire MSNBC legal analyst Paul Butler a former federal prosecutor and Nick confessori political reporter with the New York Times Ashley Parker these guys have gone around the bend they have cracked up and I think they look like they needed a camping trip or a cruise or something this summer this is this is squandered time this is time they could be focusing on other things this is time that could be shoring up Republicans in difficult districts for the midterms this is a time they could try to be switching the script off of the Russia probe and on to something more advantageous to the President and the Republicans but instead they are wrapped around the axle and spitting in circles pointing directly at the president's guilty Achilles heels you're right of this this is an incredible time suck this is this negotiation especially now with Rudy Giuliani and Muller's team has gone back and forth with counteroffers for months Giuliani himself is not the most reliable narrator he he gives interviews in the media lot some incorrectly so because you do get a window to what he is thinking and what the president is thinking and that's valuable that he will say one thing to one publication in a contradictory thing to another publication so that's important to keep in mind when we talk about their strategy and their game plan it really is oftentimes changing at least based on Giuliani's own account minute to minute and hour to hour and the president also people have pointed out to me he kind of takes the the tone and tenor of his legal team and so early on he had people who were counseling cooperation and that's what you saw for a while the team has changed up a couple of times and now you have Giuliani who is counseling something a little bit different and is the president's attack dog out front but final point in defense of all of these teams including Giuliani the president is not a particularly easy client and that is sort of what is it the core of all of this check the the tone and tenor is actually saying are wacky but the substance is fascinating to me they have now react and in the tell in the conversation around Flynn goes to the heart of the obstruction of justice investigation it would seem Rudy Giuliani's saying that he can't take questions about Flynn and and I guess by extension about the the request to former FBI director Comey to see to it to let Flynn go that was the question that Rudy said he could not answer the president could not answer here's Giuliani answering the question and telling us exactly his understanding of what happened with George Stephanopoulos let's watch how is he a good witness for the president if he's saying that the president was asking and directing him in his words to let the Michael Senate investigation go he didn't direct me to do that what he said to him was can you give homie says he took it as directly that's okay I mean I'm taking it that way I mean by that time you have been fired and he said a lot of other things some of which has turned out to be untrue the reality is as a prosecutor I was told that many times can you give the man a break either by his lawyers by his relatives my friends you take that into consideration but you know that doesn't determine that not going forward with it so Chuck right there Rudy says his understanding of what Donald Trump said to Jim Comey is can you give the man a break that sounds really really really close to what former FBI director Jim we said can you see to it to let Fling go it does it sounds really clear DS corroborating Comi well it sounds like but mr. Giuliani is not the witness here the president would be the witness here and so it makes perfect sense to me Nicole that you would want if you're Bob Muller to hear from the president look the president has a couple of options if he gets a subpoena you can tell the truth or you can invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination if the truth would incriminate him that's it those are the two lawful options and it makes sense to me to that mr. Giuliani would want to try and talk folks out of calling the president he probably is not a very good witness the fact that you know Muller can't rely on Giuliana's testimony that doesn't do him any good he needs to hear from the president the other alternative of course is that the president could simply stipulate agree to a set of facts agree that he fired Jim Comey because as he told Lester Holt of the Russia thing I mean if the president was willing to do that I guess that would be a substitute but Giuliani is not a substitute you dropped in something that I don't want to let go unremarked upon you said you talked about similar could subpoena the president do you believe now at this point that is Muller is only option with all the shenanigans and all the BS frankly going back and forth between Jay Sekulow and Rudy in the special counsel's office yeah I mean look if the president keeps saying I have nothing to hide and I want to talk to Bob Muller well if you want to talk to Bob Muller talk to Bob Muller and if you have nothing to hide then hide nothing but this has been going on and on and on Nicolle to the point where it seems pretty clear to me that if Muller wants to hear from the president it's going to have to be pursuant to a subpoena under oath and in a grand jury now of course there's another question which is would he be permitted to do that with the Deputy Attorney General who is overseeing this investigation permit that my guess is that he would I hope they do the Muller team the investigators and the prosecutors are entitled to all the lawful evidence they can acquire and Paul Butler rod Rosen Stein has shown himself and his deputy ed Callahan have shown themselves to be on the side of the facts here they have you know they have showcased I guess the the indictments when when Muller's had indictments Rosen's tryin did that last press conference with some very very thinly veiled swipes at the circus atmosphere among the president's allies in Congress the attacks on the program whatnot so III wonder if you agree with Chuck's belief or thesis that Rosen's Stein would sign off on a subpoena for the president I do what the Deputy Attorney General has been doing is following the rule of law and the guidelines of the Department of Justice so it is an unsettled issue with regard to the Supreme Court whether the president could be forced to testify in a criminal case but if Trump is subpoenaed by the president I'm sorry if Trump is subpoena by Muller I think that Rosenstein would enforce that subpoena you know Giuliani says that he's concerned about a perjury trap well hey as chucks that the way to get around that is for the client in this case the President to tell the truth what Muller wants to ask is questions they forgot to a Flynn mr. president when you told mother to go easy one thing when you told Comey to go easy on call me did you know that Flynn had lied about his contacts with the Russians and if he did that's not a perjury job that's a legitimate investigative question classic perjury jog-trot is when you asked about something extra that doesn't have anything to do with it just try to trick the guy into lie classic example there ken starr he's investigating this failed real estate transaction and he asked President Clinton did you have sex with Monica Lewinsky he knows he's going to lie that's a trap asking questions about obstruction of justice and perjury and the mother investigation is not a trap and they have all the questions I mean they know the areas I mean the flash points in the obstruction of justice investigation are known knowns to the Trump legal team it's the it's the effort to get Jeff Sessions to Unruh cues it's the efforts to get Comey to dropsy to it to let Mike Flynn go it's the conversations with his White House Counsel about firing Bob Muller I mean the flash points are known to them so what why is there so much anxiety all of a sudden now around these obstruction of justice questions I've heard in the last week from people who have either been around this legal effort or witnesses themselves that there are questions in the air in the either about whether or not the president engaged in witness tampering about whether he can carried out or conducted himself in a way that suggested he has or may suborn perjury there is a lot of anxiety in the president's conduct while in office around this investigation in the witnesses no question and the legal team is very aware of these things and very nervous about these things and that's why we that is being born out in the goal posts being moved on a near-daily basis by Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow but about what would need to be required to have this interview occur and it's their proposals are ones they know the special counsel is not going to agree to the day or day or it is an effort to in some ways it's someone close to the white house said to me just today the idea of that it's a we're in a stall tactic now that they want to keep this going and help Muller I mean the clock is not up for midterms they think though that they can they believe that Muller will adhere to the 60 day rule their guideline he doesn't have to but they could and they think that comes to timbre first or so he would push pause and therefore that would sort of at least temporarily lifts some of this cloud for the Republicans in the midterm election so they're willing to to at least take a chance on that even though it could mean coming on later and they like the idea of the president at least publicly suggesting he would want to do this interview they feel like if he suddenly shut it down and said I'm not gonna do it that would play politically poorly hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
