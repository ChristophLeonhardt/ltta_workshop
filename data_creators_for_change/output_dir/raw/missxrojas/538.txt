1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life books</font>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,019
that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> finished reading girls and men</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,400
married bliss was kind of this really

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,259
gritty story about Irish women who come

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,420
to live and get married<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on in</font>

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">London and they're unhappy married lives</font>

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,320
and how everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is horribly selfish</font>

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,719
it's fantastically written but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,539
quite disheartening if you want to lose

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">faith in the idea of perfect marriage</font>

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,020
and perfect future and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,090
that and kind of get annoyed at women a

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,820
lot as well as men<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course and that's</font>

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good book free but it is very well</font>

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,539
written I can understand what Philip

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,640
Roth says but i would say she's the most

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">gifted it was good for you this and the</font>

18
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,149
other hand love star girl which I just

19
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,469
showed to you backwards I think the

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,780
first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read through quarters of it</font>

21
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,120
the reason I had a problem with it was

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
because you're seeing it through star

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
girl's eyes and star go in the first

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,039
book could you see her through Leo's

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,390
eyes and she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this magical wonderful</font>

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,340
person that you don't you didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,410
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside her head pot the magic is</font>

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,829
that she's unpredictable and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot</font>

29
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,480
think of her thought process and you

30
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,770
have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what's going to happen next</font>

31
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,020
and so on whereas in the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> book she</font>

32
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,140
is in a new town and you just have to

33
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,270
learn to see that magic in a different

34
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,950
way kind of seeing the way she<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,900
really set out to make a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

36
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,360
and yet she changes everyone's life

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,689
isn't 100-percent happy but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

38
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,420
depressing it just kind of gets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,490
deeper place than that book that a

40
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,619
younger person could read a quite young

41
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,259
person and still enjoy a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,970
don't appreciate how much good junior

43
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,380
fiction there is not even young adult

44
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,299
junior fiction kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight to twelve</font>

45
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,280
but no it did love it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,329
these wonderful things throughout were

47
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,009
because she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been at home school again</font>

48
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,900
her mother is sending her on assignments

49
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,579
she writes his poetry and there's this

50
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,350
beautiful poem if you have this edition

51
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,500
at least page 176 and it's a poem called

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,420
the clock on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lean RP</font>

53
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,549
building but the way that we think about

54
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,710
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just I loved it in other news</font>

55
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Harry Potter which I haven't talked</font>

clips from half-blood prince and I

59
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,299
cannot possibly be more excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

60
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,500
the next film I think just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

61
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,939
think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

62
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,729
are kind of peeved by the fact that it's

63
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,690
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it</font>

64
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,640
PG rating oh it can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good unless its</font>

65
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,350
high rating I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

66
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,110
necessarily true and they do pick the

67
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,300
clips very well but from what I've seen

68
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,190
it's going to be quite good film and

69
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really actually and really fast and</font>

70
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,900
what was nice is that being dispersed

71
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,550
these clips kind of with the special

72
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,260
features sorts of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get on</font>

73
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,120
the dvds that the interviews with the

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,410
cast I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed with what I've</font>

75
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,030
seen so far and I have to admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

76
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">am happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they postponed it no</font>

77
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,170
because it means i get to certain

78
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,550
someone with my friends or my friends in

79
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,930
the fandom think it's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth the</font>

80
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,050
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> I genuinely believe that and we</font>

81
