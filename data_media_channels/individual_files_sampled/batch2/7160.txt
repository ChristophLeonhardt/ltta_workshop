re now joining us Rick Trevino he ran for Congress in Texas 23rd district a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the first round not make sure you really but to get into the runoff it came in second and now the runoff was tonight and and Rick we didn't have that come we were looking for so talk to me about what you learned from this race I learned that in a working-class community that people really embrace these ideas of Bernie Sanders now the outcome wasn't though outcome I wanted this evening but you know I got close to 8,000 people at least what it looks like at the moment that voted for a Democratic Socialist someone that isn't really a Democrat you know someone that's really just a working-class person and trying to organize people around class and his district has been described been described as conservative for a long time it's been described conservative because the d-triple-c the Democratic Party uses that as an excuse to send these centrist moderate candidates to the district and this race also I learned that the Democratic Party isn't a friend to the progressive movement they decided to jump into this race very early they sat it with my opponent Gina Ortiz Jones before the runoff ballots forecast given her many resources so this isn't a fair game everybody out there that's watching us understand that right now the Democratic Party really doesn't want to regain power on these issues they would rather regain power through the hashtag resistance movement the path of least resistance and it will allow them to get into power without promising any real policy proposals and we just have to be very vigilant about that and continue to persevere and keep our heads our heads high I think there's a real potential for these politics to continue to captivate the imagination of working families so I really do think that I accomplished a lot I beat a candidate in the race half a million dollars I did it with a little bit of money I did it with a lot of hard work I never sold out and I was willing to my keith ellison said strike out these issues yeah so Rick how do you think that Democratic Party helped your opponent in the primary well well first of all what they did was they gave her access to a lot of media also a lot of PACs like most recent FEC filings showed that a quality PAC for example just supported one can and if that was my opponent gina jones and gave her a hundred and one thousand dollars worth of mail they also provided her with again media opportunities of field direction they gave her the d-triple-c arm and it's a big advantage to any candidate you know I myself just fund raised a little less than $50,000 most of it coming from working families whereas Gina fund raised in just the first three months $700,000 which is about fourteen years worth of work for a public teacher so the way they're helping them out is by giving them access to the donors across the country and also you know providing them with a lot of infrastructure that is difficult to organize if you're a grassroots candidate I did my best I got nothing to be ashamed of you know I could go to bed at night feeling you know well cuz I tried I did his best I could every day I worked hard I never took a day off I let go my job and I have insurance I let go of my pension and I did it because I knew that this district deserved the opportunity to hear these ideas but from an authentic progressive if not some poser ya know Rick man I love your effort and and we were saying that you're the giant-slayer cuz you already beat one guy that had $500,000 but how many people with you know five to seven hundred thousand dollars can you beat oh and and so I wanted to ask you about that not just the money and of course they're not gonna get rich trevi√±o the list of rich donors to call right and then in it's not gonna be any packs coming coming to help you out and you're a just Democrat so you know you can't do the corporate PACs anyway so but how about infrastructure what did you mean by that how do they help her with infrastructure oh they they have you know in terms of infrastructure a lot of the Democratic Party in the state and local levels they're really afraid to go against the party so you saw my opponent get the endorsement of all these state Reps local local officials so first they provide that type of about that type of pressure right if these representatives want to be in the good graces of the Democratic Party they gotta play ball I think that's one thing also they they help pay for a lot of the field a lot of the staffing they help do a lot of the work that a grassroots campaign like me has to do all out so all in all on its own it's similar to what happened in the Bernie Hillary race were in the emails you saw that the the DNC was basically an extension of the Hillary campaign so same thing here you know Gina had the resources of the d-triple-c as much as she wanted and she really didn't have to do anything but just send a bunch of mail about 8 to 12 pieces probably sent in this cycle whereas I sent out three so you know it's just an expensive game that's not fair and you know these people aren't our friends and we got to be really motivated and organized to beat them it's not gonna happen by accident I learned a lot from this opportunity I'm only 33 years old I don't think I'm going anywhere I really do think that these politics are alive and well in South Texas and I can't wait for a bonafide progressive Democratic Socialist to be representing a working-class community like I've seen here so last couple of questions for you here Rick so so Gina Ortiz Jones wins and with all the advantages that you talked about but she's gonna be going up against the Republican so who are you gonna support I'm not saying you're not gonna make an endorsement the reason is is because well the d-triple-c campaigned against me you know obviously they don't want anything to do with me they were if they really wanted my I support and good graces they probably shouldn't have you know supported my opponent before the voters got a chance to speak their minds and also I do it does bother me that you know this is a district that 70% Latino and Gina Jones right before the race added or at least to her name so she could do better in this disk and this district you know just historically Anglo last name angle surnames don't do well your piece edition allowed her to resonate in the in the district a bit more but I really do think that was very cynical and to see the d-triple-c run against the only Mexican American and the race that working-class candidate you know probably the reason I'm going to kind of stay out of it because obviously these people aren't the friends to me or the issues that I'm fighting for and also if Gina wants to support a my of my voters she could do it easy all she's got to do is really be authentic about him and it's really up to her to to to get my support you know I'm just gonna stay out of it and see what happens because this isn't about party politics this is about working-class people we have to move past this because both parties are completely in the tank for the 1% and we have to really confront that reality and anything else is just delusional to think that the democratic party which is funded by billionaires and corporations and fossil fuels and private prisons and you know disgusting Wall Street bankers like they're not gonna be the they're not gonna be the saviors of the working class until our movement the one day you Jake and CYT and justice Democrats brand-new Congress we're trying to really bring to light you know we're really trying to create a political movement for working families not for the elites but for us and it's gonna require us to be principled and to speak truth to power you know this is not gonna make me very popular within the Democratic Party here but that's no big deal ya ain't going anywhere well so two things I get out of what you're saying Eric and look I think the Republican Party is more corrupt and I would vote against Republicans but number one we have to have public financing because these are not fair races I mean this is like because if you if you're not if familiar with politics are not knee-deep in it or neck deep in it you don't understand what an unbelievable advantage it is to have more money right and then you would they were not having a competition or a battle of ideas or principles between Rick Trevino and Gina Jones we're just having a battle of who could actually get their name in front of more people and the way you do that is with more money and that's it and we're done there's no battle of ideas so we got to have public financing we must must must have it right and so we have to fight with every ounce in our body to to get money out of politics to have public all elections in this country and and number two you're like you make a great point now the d-triple-c in the democrats say that they want unity from you but did they show unity to you no right so they punch you in the face and then afterwards they say hey why won't you support me well pretty good reason why because you just punched me in the face hey so if you hadn't punched me in the face then maybe you were having a different conversation but it was supposed to be a fair contest than it wasn't so so look i know that i'd go out and vote for go vote against a republican you know in the general election but having lived what you lived I get your point of view brother in terms of certainly not endorsing or anything right now and you know we'll see how things play out but but I you know I I understand exactly where you're coming from well well basically like you know I myself if I had to choose between Geena and will hurt I would vote Geena but at the same time you know I'm not gonna speak on behalf of the voters that voted for me if they voted for me for a reason for the ideas that I fought for and it's up to it's up to them to really figure out who they want to vote for because a lot of the people that voted for me they weren't all Democrats you know I I talked to a lot of disaffected Republicans it's affected independents so it's not just you know it's not a monolith of Democrats in my in my in my base right it was a complex group of disaffected voters and before they were looking for some type of authenticity and they deserved that they deserve the opportunity to make their minds up and if will hurt and Geena Jones really want these votes well they gotta go get him yep you got it really again this isn't a lot of like what I've been hearing a lot is all you got to do is vote we get the vote out everything is gonna be great well who are we voting for right and that's really what the voters have to be asking themselves who out of these two are really gonna articulate and manifests the ideas that they want for themselves you know but in terms of endorsements I'm gonna kind of stay out of it just like I stayed out of it in my city council race you know I know where I would know who I would side with but and I'm not gonna go out there and make an endorsement because again we're dealing with an unfair political system that is against working families and this is a country that is completely run by the 1% this is a oligarchy and we really have to be bold in terms of how we confront this and not sugarcoat it I could play a team player in the Al Democratic Party but it's the same Democratic Party that is stunting this movement and trying to do it on their own terms and cynically embracing the positions of fundraising style the Bernie movement so this isn't a this isn't a nice game this is a game about power and if the working class wants power we got a really unify and be principled and it's okay to be principled it's located the man-things from the economy it's okay to demand things from our government yeah it's not you don't serve the parties they say they're supposed to serve us and that's the position we got to start taking so Rick I mean as I look at you I see a rebel fighter and so and I'm not just saying that man you are you have a fighting spirit and you rebelled against the system and and you almost did it right so and this was your first run at it so of course that leaves me the last question which is what's next for you gee I gotta get a job oh my god you know I gotta get back into you know I'm a working-class guy you know I could only do this for a certain amount of time well more than likely I'm gonna go back into teaching or administration I have a master's to be a principal I'm certified I have a good career in front of me and I really loved education but um you know who knows really but in terms of being political I'm gonna stay there I'm gonna stay in the Democratic Party to make sure that it evolves for the working class and continue to be a thorn in their side until they really become the party of the working class and until then you know continue to engage our revolution Democratic socialists of America brand new Congress just as Democrats make investments in these grassroots organizations that are they gave a candidate like me an opportunity to take this take the stage and to speak to so many people about these ideas that they never gotten a chance to talk about or think about so I'm gonna continue to stay in the movement but in terms of just immediate thing show man I got some resumes to submit man so probably I'm gonna be doing all right well that that's the real world brother right there that's real life so Rick thank you for interrupting your life to try to bring change to people and look I don't know about anybody else but I appreciate it I appreciate that you took that chance and then I appreciate that you fought for the people down there and and I'm positive that there'll be another day oh yeah yeah absolutely and you know that's a thing these things but it was March 31st Austin Texas 2015 Bernie Sanders came down to Texas before he announced and I was there at the front row listening to him and he said these movements take a long time it doesn't just happen by accident so we just gotta continue to be principled persevere and believe in ourselves because eventually things are gonna pan out right if the things don't change soon you know it's only gonna get worse for the working class if it's really Millennials all the Millennials out there the world doesn't look the way that we want to it's our fault we are the biggest voting based on the United States we should have been voting in less than 15% a clip we need to really you know like I say articulate our power you know really show what we are and
