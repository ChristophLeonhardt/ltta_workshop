1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,700
Cambridge, could you imagine a more idyllic
university town?

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,800
With its narrow medieval passageways and 801-year-old
university

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,170
this small English city it packed with history.

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,029
But Cambridge is embracing the new, its restaurant
scene has moving on from pub grub

5
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,460
And has something exciting, yet still traditional,
to offer.

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,880
Welcome to Cambridge.

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,300
Cambridge is less than an hour from London
by train.

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,480
And once you’ve arrived, you’re going
to want to do what the locals do and get yourself

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,570
a bike.

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:58,360
Cambridge is considered the cycling capital
of the UK - they're everywhere.

11
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,140
Bike hire shops are peppered around and parking
is easy but be warned.

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,030
In 2017 the Cambridge district had one of
the highest rates of bike theft in England

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,160
and Wales - so lock it up.

14
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,000
In the centre of Cambridge is one of the world’s
most well known and respected Universities.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,210
Founded in 1208, it's
the fourth oldest university in the world

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,000
still teaching.

17
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:34,100
One of the jewels in the university’s crown
is its libraries and this is the big one.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,780
Cambridge University Library holds around
8 million books, manuscripts, maps and journals

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,040
and it was thought some more salacious material.

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,000
For a long time it was undergraduate folklore
that the library tower held a vast stockpile

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,800
of Victorian age pornography.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,750
But no…

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,920
This year the tower’s opened up its secrets
and revealed its was used to store books

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,660
and other items thought not good enough for
the main building.

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:08,340
This material is now regarded as an important
resource

26
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,660
One of the best ways to see Cambridge’s
hidden spots is by boat, or punt, to be exact.

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,300
Punting began in the early 20th century

28
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:31,260
And remains the best way to explore the River
Cam and it’s many bridges - 25 in all.

29
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:38,000
This is the Mathematical Bridge. Despite looking
curved it’s made entirely of straight timber.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,070
Safely on dry land it’s time of a pint.

31
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,400
This is The Eagle

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,850
It was there 1953 Francis Crick charged in,
interrupting lunchtime service, to announce

33
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,760
that he and James Watson

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,440
had "discovered the secret
of life". How DNA carries genetic information.

35
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,860
I hope someone offered him a drink.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,620
Keeping with tradition, just a few meters
down the road is Chop House.

37
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,770
This no-nonsense steak restaurant has a classic
English menu.

38
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,840
Try the Sticky Toffee Pudding - if you have
room.

39
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,540
But it not all old England, this is Pint Shop,
offering 23-tap craft beer and 100 gin options.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,250
There are plenty of places to stay in the
city but if you want to get some country air,

41
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,660
just a short drive out of town is Clopton
Courtyard

42
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,650
Here you can rent your own barn, there are
six to choose from , and enjoy the quintessentially

43
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,020
English countryside surrounding.

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a bad spot to finish off your day…
