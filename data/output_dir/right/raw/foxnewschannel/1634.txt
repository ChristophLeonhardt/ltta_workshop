1
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:14,619
>> GOP CANDIDATES ARE EXPECTED

2
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,654
TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE.

3
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:18,489
>> SOME WILL HAVE TO DISTANCE

4
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,190
THEMSELVES FROM DONALD TRUMP.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,191
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WON'T BE

6
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,359
WELCOMED IN EVERY STATE WITH A

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,595
REPUBLICAN IS TRYING TO HOLD ON

8
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:28,466
BECAUSE THE MID-TERMS WILL BE A

9
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:29,133
REFERENDUM ON TRUMP.

10
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,703
>> Martha: THE MEDIA PREDICTED

11
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:35,573
TO WIN THE 2018 MID-TERMS

12
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:38,743
CANDIDATE WOULD HAVE TO BE AT

13
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:41,479
ARM'S LENGTH FROM PRESIDENT

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,513
TRUMP.

15
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:45,783
BUT A NEW ANALYSIS SAYS THE

16
00:00:45,783 --> 00:00:47,352
OPPOSITE MAY BE HAPPENING.

17
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:49,754
4 IN 10 GOP CANDIDATES PRAISED

18
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:53,858
OR ECHOED THE PRESIDENT IN THEIR

19
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,193
POLITICAL ADVERTISING.

20
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:59,163
AND NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS

21
00:00:59,163 --> 00:01:00,231
CRITICIZING OR DISTANCING

22
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:01,299
THEMSELVES FROM THE PRESIDENT.

23
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:03,835
MY NEXT GUEST IS ONE OF THOSE

24
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,937
WHO HAS TAKEN A CUE FROM THE

25
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:06,971
TRUMP PLAYBOOK.

26
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:07,272
WATCH.

27
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:08,706
>> DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT.

28
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:12,076
WE MUST SECURE THE BORDER AND

29
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,511
END SANCTUARY CITIES.

30
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,113
IF YOU ARE GOING TO DATE ONE OF

31
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:16,080
MY DAUGHTERS.

I HAVE A BIG TRUCK.

39
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:28,293
JUST IN CASE I NEED TO ROUNDUP

HOME MYSELF.

42
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:35,300
YEP, I JUST SAID THAT.

43
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,534

YOU WERE CHUCKLING WHEN WE CAME

50
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,112
BACK ON CAMERA.

51
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,615
ANYTHING IN THESE ADS TONGUE IN

52
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:53,017
CHEEK OR 100% WHERE YOU ARE?

53
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:55,420
>> NO, IT'S TONGUE AND CHEEK,

54
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,854
BUT IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE

55
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:59,023
GREAT MESSAGE WE HAVE TRACKING

56
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:02,794
AND DEPORTING CRIMINAL ILLEGALS

57
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,595
AND MAKING GEORGIA NUMBER 1 FOR

SMALL BUSINESSLIKE PRESIDENT

59
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,598
TRUMP IS DOING.

60
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:09,533
CUTTING GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS.

61
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,068
I HAVE BEEN RUNNING THIS

00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,603
CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS FOR 14

63
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:12,937

IT'S WHO I AM.

65
00:02:14,272 --> 00:02:15,707

THEY WANT A GOVERNOR THAT WILL

69
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:21,879
FIGHT FOR THEM.

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,016
I WILL DO THAT AS THE NEXT

71
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:27,986
GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.

76
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:47,271
THE ADS SOUND SIMILAR.

77
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:49,507
HOW ARE YOURS DIFFERENT?

78
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:51,075
>> THIS IS ABOUT TRUST.

79
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,678
WHOM DO YOU TRUST TO FIGHT FOR

80
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:55,046
YOUR CONSERVATIVE VALUES?

81
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,981
I HAVE A GREAT RECORD OF DOING

00:02:58,649 --> 00:02:59,650
OVER 30 YEARS NOW.

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,919
ALSO AS A STATE SENATOR AND NOW

85
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,487
AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

86
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:03,321
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.

87
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:06,491
I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN THE RACE

88
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,826
THAT HAS EXECUTIVE BRANCH

89
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:09,594
EXPERIENCE.

90
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:12,563
I SUED THE OBAMA JUSTICE

THE LEFT.

94
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,507
THAT'S WHO I AM.

95
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,643
YOU SEE THAT IN OUR TELEVISION

96
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:25,910
ADS.

97
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,878
>> Martha: I AM CURIOUS ABOUT

98
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,846
THE ISSUE OF POT IN GEORGIA.

99
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,615
WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE THAT AS

100
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:33,251
AN AREA WHERE REGULATION SHOULD

101
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:33,885
BE DROPPED?

102
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,487
IF YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD SOURCE

103
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:38,456
OF STATE INCOME FOR TAXING?

104
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,724
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD

105
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:41,592
SOURCE OF STATE INCOME IN

106
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:41,926
GEORGIA.

107
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:42,760
OUR ECONOMY IS GREAT.

108
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,798
I WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER BY

109
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:47,832
FOCUSSING ON SMALL BUSINESS

110
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,533
PEOPLE.

111
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,736
THOSE FOLKS ARE STILL HURTING.

112
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:52,837
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE IF THEY

113
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:55,540
CAN GET IS UNAFFORDABLE BECAUSE

114
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,641
OF OBLERMAN.

115
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,176
-- OBAMACARE.

116
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:00,078
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR STATE

117
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,881
AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE GROWING.

118
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,083
HONESTLY THE MEDICAL MARIJUANA

119
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,585
IS AN ISSUE IN OUR STATE AND THE

120
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,287
STATE MADE SOME MOVEMENT ON

121
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:09,587
THAT.

122
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:10,888
AS FAR AS CULTIVATION AND OTHER

123
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:12,657
THINGS, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL

124
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:16,494
SEE THAT ANY TIME SOON IN OUR

125
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:16,861
STATE.

126
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:19,130
I UNDERSTAND THE FAMILIES AND

127
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,630
WHAT THEY ARE GOING THROUGH WITH

128
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,333
THEIR KIDS.

129
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,769
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE CLINICAL

130
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,136
RESEARCH.

131
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:29,040
I STICK TO MY MESSAGE OF

132
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,575
CONSERVATIVE VALUES AND CUTTING

133
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,877
GOVERNMENT AND DEFENDING OUR

134
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:33,611
SECOND AMENDMENT.

135
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,413
WE HAVE A PUBLIC SAFETY REFORM

136
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:39,550
OF TRACKING AND DEPORTING

137
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,753
CRIMINALS AND GOING AFTER STREET

138
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:43,154
GANGS.

139
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:45,289
AS A FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS I

140
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,225
AM CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY.

141
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,960
>> Martha: IN THE PRIMARIES IT'S

142
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,730
EASY TO RUN FURTHER TO THE

143
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,030
RIGHT.

144
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,067
IF YOU MAKE IT RUNNING AGAINST

145
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,469
THE DEMOCRAT IN GEORGIA, DO YOU

146
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,403
WANT PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STAND

147
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:03,307
BESIDE YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN

148
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:03,608
TRAIL?

149
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:05,443
>> I WOULD LOVE FOR THE

150
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,711
PRESIDENT TO COME DOWN TO

151
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,044
GEORGIA.

152
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,613
PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHAT HE IS

153
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,149
DOING AND FIGHTING THE LIBERAL

154
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:11,449
MEDIA.

155
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,151
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN

156
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,752
FIGHTING THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

157
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,021
I AM RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN FOR

158
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,156
BRIAN KEMP TO BE GOVERNOR AND

159
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,290
NOT DONALD TRUMP.

160
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,926
THOSE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE, THEY

161
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:22,960
ARE MY VALUES.

162
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,629
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING

163
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,564
TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA ABOUT.

164
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,699
I THINK IT'S STARTING TO

165
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,769
RESONATE BECAUSE OF OUR

166
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,204
TELEVISION ADS.

167
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,840
