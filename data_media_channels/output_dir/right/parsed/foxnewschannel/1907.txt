COMES AS PREPARES FOR SUMMIT
WITH KIM JONG UN AND THAT
HAPPENS IN JUNE NEXT MONTH.
BRIAN: LET’S BRING IN TED
CRUZ LOOKING TO KEEP THAT
SEAT FOR ANOTHER SIX YEARS.
HAS HIS HANDSFUL IN TEXAS
BUT A BIG STUDENT OF WHAT’S
HANG INTERNATIONALLY.
SENATOR, WHAT IS YOUR
TAKE -- I’M SURE YOU WEREN’T
UP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AT WHAT
HAS TAKEN PLACE SO FAR?
>> WELL, IT’S A BIG DEAL.
THE PRESIDENT IS TO BE
COMMENDED FOR BRINGING THESE
THREE AMERICANS HOME.
THAT IS A MAJOR VICTORY.
IT’S REALLY THE RESULTS OF
AMERICAN STRENGTH.
YOU KNOW, WE SAW FOR 8 YEARS
UNDER BARACK OBAMA A FOREIGN
POLICY THAT WAS REALLY A
POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND
APPEASEMENT.
REMEMBER HOW OBAMA PUT IT,
LEADING FROM BEHIND.
THE PROBLEM IS WEAKNESS AND
APPEASEMENT DOESN’T WORK.
ESPECIALLY WITH DICTATORS
LIKE KIM JONG UN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS COME IN
WITH A STRONG AMERICAN
FOREIGN POLICY, GETTING BACK
TO PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.
I THINK WE ARE SEEING THE
RESULTS OF IT WITH THREE
AMERICANS COMING HOME.
STEVE: YOU KNOW WHAT’S
INTERESTING, SENATOR, I WAS
CLICKING AROUND YESTERDAY
WITH THE BIG NEWS THAT THEY
WERE COMING BACK TO THE
UNITED STATES.
AND THE MAJORITY OF THE NEWS
COVERAGE ON THE OTHER
CHANNELS WAS ABOUT STORMY
DANIELS.
WHAT’S THE HECK IS UP WITH
THAT?
>> MOST OF THE MEDIA -- THEY
ARE JUST OUT OF THEIR MIND.
THEY HAVE WHAT I CALL TRUMP
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME WHERE
ALL THEY CAN DO IS ATTACK
THE PRESIDENT ALL DAY LONG
ON THE SCANDAL OF THE DAY.
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I
THINK MOST TEXANS ARE REALLY
TIRED OF IT.
WHEN I GO HOME NOBODY ASKS
ABOUT THE LATEST SCANDAL OF
THE DAY AND WHATEVER THE
TALKING HEADS ARE LIGHTING
THEIR HAIR ON FIRE ABOUT.
PEOPLE ARE EXCITED ABOUT TAX
CUTS.
ABOUT REGULATIONS BEING
LIFTED.
ABOUT JOBS GROWING.
I WILL TELL WHAT YOU PEOPLE
ARE EXCITED ABOUT, FOR
EXAMPLE, IS YESTERDAY AT THE
WHITE HOUSE I WAS THERE.
THE PRESIDENT MADE A
DECISION THAT SAVED
THOUSANDS OF JOBS.
HE STEPPED IN AND SOLVED THE
BROKEN REN SYSTEM.
SOMETHING THE E.P.A.
INVENTED TO ENFORCE THE
ETHANOL MANDATE.
WHAT HAPPENED WAS RENN
SKYROCKETED AND THEY WERE
THREATENING THE JOBS
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF
BLUE CAR UNION MAKERS AT
REFINERIES IN TEXAS AND
REFINERIES IN PENNSYLVANIA.
I HAVE BEEN FOR SIX MONTHS
WORKING WITH THE PRESIDENT
AND WORK WITH OTHER
SENATORS.
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT
MADE A TERRIFIC DECISION.
HE STEPPED IN AND SAID THAT
WE’RE GOING TO ALLOW RENNES
TO BE CREATED WHEN ETHANOL
IS EXPORTED OF.
WHAT THAT MEANS WE ARE GOING
TO EXPORT A LOT MORE
ETHANOL.
THAT’S GOING TO HELP CORN
FARMERS.
WE WILL SELL MORE ETHANOL
AND ALSO ALLOW E-15 TO BE
SOLD YEAR AROUND.
IT’S A BIG WIN FOR CORN
FARMERS BUT CRITICALLY THE
PRESIDENT SAVED THE JOBS OF
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BLUE
COLLAR UNION MEMBERS,
REFINERY WORKERS.
EXACTLY THE PEOPLE WHO
ELECTED DONALD TRUMP INSTEAD
OF HILLARY CLINTON.
IT WAS EXACTLY THE RIGHT
DECISION.
AINSLEY: SENATOR JOBS CHECK.
ETHANOL MANDATE CHECK.
PRIMPS HOME CHECK.
THE SUMMIT NOW SET AND THE
IRAN DEAL.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT
THAT?
>> WELL, ONCE AGAIN, I THINK
THE PRESIDENT DID EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING TO PULL OUT
OF THE IRAN DEAL FOR THE
LAST YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE
BEEN TALKING WITH THE
PRESIDENT, URGING HIM TO
TAKE THIS COURSE.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT
HASTEDTLY BEEN ON THIS PATH.
THE IRAN DEAL THAT PRESIDENT
OBAMA NEGOTIATED WAS
CATASTROPHIC.
IT DID ENORMOUS DAMAGE TO
AMERICA BECAUSE IT ALLOWED
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO GO
DIRECTLY TO THE WORLD’S
LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF
TERRORISM.
AND EVEN WORSE THAN THAT, IT
DID SO IN A WAY THAT ENSURED
IRAN WOULD GET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE AYATOLLAH
KHOMEINI PLEDGES DEATH TO
AMERICA AND DEATH TO ISRAEL,
I BELIEVE HIM.
HE IS A RELIGIOUS RADICAL
ZEALOT AND CANCELING THE
DEAL IS THE EXACTLY THE
RIGHT THING WHAT WE NEED TO
DO AND WHAT WE ARE GOING
FORWARD DOING IS REIMPOSING
CRUSHING SANCTIONS, URGING
OUR ALLIES TO DO THE SAME
AND MAKING SURE THAT IRAN
NEVER NEVER NEVER GETS A
NUCLEAR WEAPON.
BRIAN: SENATOR, YOU KNOW HOW
THEY FEEL THEY MADE IT
CLEAR.
THE FOREIGN MINISTER OF
ENGLAND AND MACRON SPENT TWO
DAYS HERE AND MERKEL SPENT A
DAY ALL TO KEEP US IN.
IN FACT, SHE RELEASED THIS
STATEMENT.
IT IS NO LONGER SUCH THAT
THE UNITED STATES SIMPLY
PROTECTS US.
BUT EUROPE MUST TAKE ITS
DESTINY IN ITS OWN HANDS.
THAT’S THE TASK OF THE
FUTURE.
YOUR REACTION?
>> LISTEN, WE’RE GOING TO
SEE SOME POSTURING IN
EUROPEAN CAPITALS.
THE REASON IS THERE IS SOME
BIG EUROPEAN COMPANIES WANT
TO DO BUSINESS WITH IRAN.
THEY MAKE MONEY.
THAT’S GOT A LOT OF THE
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DEFENDING
THIS DEAL.
I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN THE
DEAL WAS BEING NEGOTIATED, I
HAD EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS IN
MY OFFICE ASKING FOR MY HELP
SAYING THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IS PRESSURING
US.
WE THINK THIS IS A FOOLISH
DEAL.
WILL YOU HELP US PRESS BACK?
SO, LOOK, NO ONE SHOULD BE
SURPRISED THAT THEIR
COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN
MONEY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE A BIGGER
RESPONSIBILITY.
THE AYATOLLAH WITH A NUCLEAR
WEAPON, IF HE EVER ACQUIRE
AS NUCLEAR WEAPON, I THINK
THE ODDS ARE UNACCEPTABLY
HIGH.
HE WOULD DETONATE THAT
WEAPON IN THE SKIES OF TEL
AVIV OR NEW YORK OR LOS
ANGELES.
WE CAN’T ROLL THE DICE.
BRIAN: IF GERMANY WAS
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN
DESTINY.
MAYBE THEY WOULDN’T ACCEPT A
PIPELINE FROM RUSSIA THAT
KEEPS THEM ON THE RUSSIAN
NATURAL GAS CRACK PIPE
FOREVER WHEN WE COULD SUPPLY
IT.
STEVE: SENATOR CRUZ, LET ME
ASK YOU THIS.
THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW
SENDING TO CORRECT ME IF I
CONGRESS A 15BILLION-DOLLAR RESN
PACKAGE.
IT’S BEEN OVER A MONTH AGO
PALOOZA $1.3 BILLION.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LOT OF
FUNDING FROM THE MILITARY.
NOW HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO
CLAW IT BACK?
>> YES.
WELL, I HAVE BEEN, THE
OMNIBUS WAS A SERIOUS
MISTAKE.
I VOTED AGAINST THAT 1.3
BILLION-DOLLAR SPENDING
PACKAGE.
STEVE: TRILLION.
>> NOW YOU GOT ME DOING IT.
STEVE: I DID IT, TOO.
>> IT WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
RIGHT TO SEND A RESCISSION
THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF
RESCISSION IS THE DEMOCRATS
CAN’T FILIBUSTER IT.
IT’S A PROCEDURAL VEHICLE
THAT ONLY TAKES 50 VOTES.
IF REPUBLICANS JUST STAND
TOGETHER WE CAN CLAW BACK
SOME OF THAT SPENDING AND
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE
BEEN URGING REPUBLICANS IN
THE SENATE, WE HAVE A NARROW
51 VOTE MAJORITY.
OF THE DEMOCRATS ARE
FILIBUSTERING EVERYTHING.
WE NEED TO BE USING ALL OF
THE PROCEDURAL TOOLS WE HAVE
TO PASS THINGS WITH 51 VOTES
TO GET VICTORY AFTER VICTORY
AFTER VICTORY FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND REIGNING
IN WASTEFUL SPENDING IS
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE OUGHT
TO BE DOING.
APPLAUD THE WHITE HOUSE FOR
DOING THAT.
BRIAN: SARAH JESSICA PARKER
GOING AFTER YOUR OPPONENT IN
THE SENATE RACE.
CAN YOU STILL WIN?
>> SHE JOINS ROSIE O’DONNELL
AND AL FRANKEN AND CHELSEA
HANDLER AND I GOT TO SAY.
IF THIS ELECTION WERE IN
HOLLYWOOD, I WOULD HAVE LOST
ALREADY.
BUT, FORTUNATELY HOLLYWOOD
CELEBRITIES DON’T TEND TO
VOTE A WHOLE LOT IN TEXAS
ELECTIONS.
LISTEN, I HAVE GOT AN
OPPONENT WHO IS RUNNING HARD
LEFT.
IS HE RUNNING ON GUN
CONTROL.
IS HE RUNNING ON OPEN
BORDERS.
IS HE RUNNING ON IMPEACHING
THE PRESIDENT.
HE IS THE FIRST DEMOCRAT
SENATE CANDIDATE IN THE
COUNTRY TO PLEDGE HE WOULD
IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP BUT I
HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, HE IS
RAISING MORE MONEY THAN ANY
DEMOCRAT IN THE ENTIRE
COUNTRY.
HE RAISED $7 MILLION LAST
QUARTER AND SO WHAT WE’RE
SAYING IS CONSERVATIVES IN
TEXAS AND ACROSS THE
COUNTRY, THEY ARE GOING TO
TED CRUZ.ORG AND WE ARE
STANDING TOGETHER.
WE’RE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE
THERE ARE MORE CONSERVATIVES
THAN THERE ARE LIBERALS IN
TEXAS.
BUT IT’S GOING TO TAKE
CONSERVATIVES SHOWING UP IN
NOVEMBER TO DEFEND OUR
FREEDOM.
STEVE: ALL RIGHT.
SENATOR TED CRUZ.ORG.
