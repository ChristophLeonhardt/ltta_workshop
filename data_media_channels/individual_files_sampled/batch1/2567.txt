well one of the interesting things you've brought up is that feminism today is very focused on the women who make it to the top how many CEOs are female and and and we're that's our measuring stick but that the big problem is is at the bottom and can you talk a little bit about that yeah that there are too few women at the top but way too many at the bottom and look right now we're in the midst of this enormous healthcare debate who are the people who are kind of really be left on the streets right if you are you know a single mother with children and you're in a state that it expanded Medicaid and now retracts it you have nothing you know and your child gets sick well you'll go to the emergency room and that will will bump up our health costs but that's those are the women if we're really thinking about equality between men and women across the board we need to be paying every bit as much and really in many ways more attention to women at low income women middle class women who are essentially trying to do a full breadwinner job and a full caregiver job
