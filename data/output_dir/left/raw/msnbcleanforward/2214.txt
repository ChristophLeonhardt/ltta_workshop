60 DAYS. SO MOST OF THEM IS IN HHS CARE

68
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,195
SO MOST OF THEM IS IN HHS CARE WHICH MEANS IT SHOULD BE EASY

WHICH MEANS IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO TRACK THEM

YOU ARE GIVEN AN A NUMBER. A CHILD GIVEN A NUMBER AND A

86
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,164
A CHILD GIVEN A NUMBER AND A PARENT WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER.

GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO BRING THE CHILDREN TOGETHER.

90

91
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:40,612
THEY MOVE THE PARENTS TO A DETENTION CENTER NEAR WHERE THE

92
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:41,847
DETENTION CENTER NEAR WHERE THE CHILD WAS STAYING.

93

103
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:05,837
TRUMP’S BRASH TALK OVER IN EUROPE.

104
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:11,577
EUROPE. WAS THIS A WARM UP ACT FOR THE

105
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,245
WAS THIS A WARM UP ACT FOR THE PRESIDENT’S VISIT.

106
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,379
PRESIDENT’S VISIT. YOU ARE WATCHING "HARDBALL."

107
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,683
I tend to play the tough guy.

108
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:21,352
But I wasn’t tough enough to quit on my own.

109
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,222
Not until I tried CHANTIX.

110
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:25,924
CHANTIX, along with support, helps you quit smoking.

111
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:30,963
It reduced my urge to smoke to the point that I could stop.

112
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,566
When you try to quit smoking, with or without CHANTIX,

113
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,601
you may have nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

114
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,836
Some people had changes in behavior or thinking,

115
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:40,673
aggression, hostility, agitation, depressed mood,

116
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,842
or suicidal thoughts or actions with CHANTIX.

117
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:45,144
Serious side effects may include seizures,

118
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:47,146
new or worse heart or blood vessel problems,

119
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,482
sleepwalking or allergic and skin reactions

120
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:50,750
which can be life-threatening.

121
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,351
Stop CHANTIX and get help right away

122
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,586
if you have any of these.

123
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,087
Tell your healthcare provider if you’ve had

124
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:57,256
depression or other mental health problems.

125
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,392
Decrease alcohol use while taking CHANTIX.

126
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,761
Use caution when driving or operating machinery.

127
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:03,796
The most common side effect is nausea.

128
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:05,264
My favorite role so far?

129
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:06,465
Being a non-smoker.

130
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:07,900
No question about it.

131
00:05:07,943 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to your doctor about CHANTIX.
