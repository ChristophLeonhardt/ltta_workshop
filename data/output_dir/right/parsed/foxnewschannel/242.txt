>> Shannon: THERE IS A NEW
NUMBER ONE ATOP
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" BEST SELLER
LIST.
TUCKER CARLSON'S "SHIP OF FOOLS:
HOW A SELFISH RULING CLASS IS
BRINGING AMERICA TO THE BRINK OF
REVOLUTION" ."
UNSEATING BOB WOODWARD'S "FEAR."
THE ELITES AND THE WORKING
CLASSES FROM DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES.
ALSO TONIGHT, COLUMNIST LOOKING
AT THE DIVISIVENESS IN AMERICA,
AND COMING UP WITH THIS
CONCLUSION.
"IN THE ELITE LEVEL, IT APPEARS
POLITICS IS RULED BY DIVISION.
BUT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED
ON LOCAL ISSUES, MANY AMERICANS
STILL FEEL UNIFIED."
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR
OF THE BEST SELLER,
"SHIP OF FOOLS," THINGS OF THAT.
>> Tucker: SHANNON BREAM,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
GREAT TO BE HERE.
>> Shannon: THIS IS A REALLY
INTERESTING PIECE.
I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT MORE
OF IT BECAUSE SHE TALKS TO A
LOCAL WOMAN RUNNING FOR OFFICE,
POLITICS DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM.
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY
CAN HELP EACH OTHER AND
TAILGATING AT THE NEXT FOOTBALL
GAME.
SHE SAID UNLIKE WASHINGTON, WE
ARE ALL JUST A FEW NOTCHES FROM
EACH OTHER IN EITHER DIRECTION.
MUCH MORE THAT DRAWS US TOGETHER
THEN DIVIDES US.
THE REAL DIVISION IS BETWEEN THE
ELITES AND US.
NOT NECESSARILY REPUBLICAN AND
DEMOCRATS.
>> Tucker: THAT'S THE THESIS
OF MY BOOK.
HOW REFRESHING TO HEAR OF A
PLACE WHERE POLITICS IS NOT THE
CENTRAL QUESTION.
I'VE COVERED POLITICS ALMOST MY
WHOLE LIFE.
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING, I
GUESS.
IF POLITICS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR SOCIETY,
YOUR SOCIETY IS BROKEN AND KIND
OF FALLING APART.
YOU WANT A PLACE WHERE POLITICS
DOESN'T MATTER TO DO THINGS THAT
MATTER.
FINDING A SPOUSE, A GOOD CHURCH,
BUILDING A BUSINESS, OR
WHATEVER.
THE REAL THINGS.
THAT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE.
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER
ANALYSIS.
IT'S NOT EVEN IDEOLOGICAL, IS
MOSTLY ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL.
IF YOU ARE RICHER THAN YOU WERE
BEFORE THE ECONOMIC CRISIS OF
2008, YOU PROBABLY LIVE HERE IN
NEW YORK AND L.A., YOU'RE FROM A
CERTAIN WORLD.
IF YOU'RE NOT, THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY, YOU SEE THINGS VERY
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
BENEFITING FROM WHAT WE ARE
DOING RIGHT NOW.
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
>> Shannon: I GREW OUT IN WHAT
I LIKE TO CALL "REAL AMERICA."
I LOVE WHEN I GET HOME BECAUSE
PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFERENT TAKE ON
THE WORLD.
IT'S VERY REFRESHING.
>> Tucker: I DREW UP LA JOLLA
CALIFORNIA AND GEORGETOWN.
ABOUT AS FAR FROM A REAL AMERICA
AS YOU CAN GET.
I'M NOT CLAIMING TO REPRESENT
THE GREAT OUT THERE, BUT I KNOW
THE WORLD I'M WRITING ABOUT VERY
WELL BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IN IT MY
WHOLE LIFE.
A LOT OF REALLY NICE PEOPLE.
GREAT PEOPLE IN D.C.
BUT THERE IS A VERY SPECIFIC SET
OF ATTITUDES THAT COME FROM
HAVING AN ECONOMY THAT'S BASED
ON TAX REVENUE.
THERE IS NO BUSINESS CYCLE HERE.
WE ARE ALWAYS RICH.
WE ARE THE RICHEST CITY IN
AMERICA, THE RICHEST METRO AREA.
YOU GET A CERTAIN KIND OF
ATTITUDE.
A CORROSIVE ATTITUDE.
CONTEMPTUOUS OF EVERYONE ELSE.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO ASK YOU
ABOUT A COUPLE OF CURRENT
EVENTS.
WE HAVE NEWS TODAY THAT A
PROFESSOR AT UNC HAS NOMINATED
DR. CHRISTINE BLASE FOR WITH THE
DISTINGUISHED ALUMNI
AWARD WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING AN
OUTSTANDING CONTRIBUTION TO
HUMANITY AND ANY WALK OF LIFE.
PART OF THE LETTER SAID THIS
LETTER IS NOT ABOUT PARTISAN
POLITICS, IT IS ABOUT
RECOGNIZING THAT THE SIMPLE ACT
OF SPEAKING ONCE A TRUTH IS AN
ACT OF BRAVERY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> Tucker: IT'S ANOTHER
REMINDER THAT THE ENTIRE HIGHER
EDUCATION, THE HUMANITIES, NOT
NECESSARILY ENGINEERING AND
SCIENCE, IS TOTALLY CORRUPT AND
BLOATED AND POINTLESS AND
ACTUALLY HURTING THE COUNTRY.
THAT PROFESSOR, THAT'S A VERY
MEDIOCRE -- NONIMPRESSIVE THING
TO SAY BECAUSE IT SO
TRANSPARENTLY FALSE IS BEING
SUPPORTED INDIRECTLY BY TAX
DOLLARS AND RELIEVE THE SAVINGS
OF EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS
COUNTRY.
SO, IF YOU TAKE YOUR COUNTRY
SERIOUSLY, YOU WANT YOUR
CHILDREN TO BE EDUCATED
SERIOUSLY BY SERIOUS PEOPLE
RIGOROUSLY, AND INSTEAD YOU ARE
GETTING POP LIKE THAT, IT'S KIND
OF SCARY.
>> Shannon: IF YOU READ THE
WHOLE LETTER, SHE TALKS ABOUT
THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE
AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE
THEIR STORIES BUT NOW THEY CAN
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ENABLED
BY DR. FORD.
>> Tucker: THAT'S GREAT BUT
THIS IS AN ACT OF PARTISAN
POLITICS.
I GET THAT IT'S TOTALLY FINE,
SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH MY
OPINIONS.
BUT YOU CAN'T GROW UP TO THE
ENTIRE SYSTEM, THE EDUCATION
SYSTEM, COLLEGE AND THE HIGHER
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND MAKE IT
WHOLLY POLITICAL, WHICH IS WHAT
THEY'VE DONE.
YOU TALK TO ANY PARENT, THAT'S
LIKE THE ONE EXPENSE THEY'RE
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT.
THEY'RE SAVING, NOT GOING ON
VACATION, SKIPPING THE CAR,
WE'VE GOT TO PAY FOR COLLEGE,
THEN IT WINDS UP IN THE HANDS OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOTAL CONTEMPT
FOR THE PEOPLE PAYING THE BILLS.
IT'S A BAD.
>> Shannon: YOU DON'T THINK
PROFESSORS ARE REPUBLICAN?
I'M ASKING.
>> Tucker: 
IF SHE WAS MAKING A SMART,
INTERESTING, FREETHINKING
ARGUMENT I DISAGREED WITH, A
RADICAL MARXIST TRYING TO
EXPLAIN TO ME THE DIALECTIC OF
CAPITALISM, I WOULD BE MORE
IMPRESSED BY THAT.
IT'S DUMB.
>> Shannon: SPEAKING OF
DEBATES OVER CAPITALISM, A WOMAN
WHO WILL SOON BE A MEMBER OF
CONGRESS, THIS IS WHAT SHE SAYS
ABOUT THE CAVANAUGH FALLOUT AND
WHAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE WORKING
ON NOW.
>> WE TAKE BACK THE HOUSE, THE
SENATE, THE PRESIDENCY, AND THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> Shannon: AS YOU KNOW, THIS
DID NOT GO WELL.
>> Tucker: HE WAS VERY
FRUSTRATED WITH THE CONFERENCE,
ALL PRESIDENTS ARE.
THEY ARE NOT DOING WHAT I WANT
THEM TO DO!
THAT ENDED BADLY BECAUSE IT WAS
A CLEAR AUTHORITARIAN POWER
GRAB.
SO MUCH BETTER TO MAKE YOUR
CASE.
YOU'VE GOT A SET OF IDEAS YOU
THINK WORK, TELL US WHAT THEY
ARE.
CONVINCE US.
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL CHANGE, I
THINK IT WILL, BUT DEMOCRATS
HAVE FOR NOW GIVEN UP ON THAT.
THE IDEA IS THEY ARE GOING TO
SEIZE POWER AND MAKE YOU OBEY,
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU
AGREE BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO
FORCE YOU TO OBEY.
THAT SCARES PEOPLE, EVEN
DEMOCRATS.
WHY DON'T YOU WIN ME OVER
INSTEAD OF USING FORCE?
TAKE BACK THE SUPREME COURT?
COME ON!
>> Shannon: YOU DON'T LIKE THE
SOUND OF THAT?
AMERICA, LET US KNOW WHAT YOU
THINK.
>> Tucker: UNHAPPY AS TALK
SHOW HOST.
>> Shannon: CONGRATULATIONS ON
THE BOOK, IT IS DOING FANTASTIC.
SPARKING SUCH AN INTERESTING
