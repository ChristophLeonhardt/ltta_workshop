Driscoll thank you for joining us on Rt International now we've just received information that your client Maria butanna has been transferred to another prison away from Washington can you confirm that that is correct and if so why has that been done I can confirm that's correct I'm not aware of what the reasoning was I was unaware that she was transferred until last night at around midnight I received a collect call from her at home and the phone was disconnected before we could get through but I knew it was from Alexandria jail so I drove down and tried to get in last night and could not but I was able to get in this morning and visit her so she is in Alexandria detention facility for now for this weekend and but I'm unaware of what the reasons were for the transfer and I'm trying to find that out right now I could it be possible that it's a different category of prison it's really not the the United States federal government uses local jails to house their pretrial detainees and so the Marshal Service has the ability to move people around if they want I would expect to have been notified but it's a it's a smaller facility than the DC jail is and it's a you know it's a respected facility but it's it's hard to know why the move was made whether it was made for medical or other reasons or in response to complaints about the conditions in DC you let's talk about Maria's health there has been concerned about her health conditions what kind of conditions House has been facing in prison right well I mean I think her main complaint from my visits with her is that she does have arthritis in one of her legs kind of a history of problems with that leg and I think with the conditions in the prison which are kind of on the cold side because of very strong air conditioning and also humid and damp I think that's exacerbated some swelling and so she sought treatment for that and so far has just received tylenol and nothing else and I think she has also been a little bit frustrated by policy when people are in protective custody they do bed checks every 15 minutes at night to check on detainee safety and I think sometimes depending on who the guard is you know the lights are turned on every time there's a check and so it's very hard to get proper sleep when you're being woken up every 15 minutes I think that was sporadic in the other jail we had been in communication with the warden about it trying to fix that but again now she's in an entirely new facility is just across the Potomac River in Alexandria Russian authorities have described this as inhumane incarceration do you think such conditions or are such conditions normal in such a case well it's hard to know it's normal because it's a very unusual case I mean she is in protective custody so she's segregated from the general population of the prison facility which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing on the whole but I think that it makes things very difficult bureaucratically she was in when she was in DC jail she was in kind of a holding or an intake facility that she had essentially to herself but you know no contact really with outside people besides her lawyers and occasional phone calls and when you're being held in in semi isolation like that it's difficult because every everything she wanted to do was kind of a one-off request there isn't a very set schedule and so it was very difficult to make sure she was getting a proper exercise and trips to the library and things like that because everything she did she had to do by herself so that was complicated and I think it's a very difficult situation to be in particularly for someone like her I'm not saying anyone would have an easy time in prison but I mean this is a accomplished student you know someone who I don't think ever envisioned spending a day in jail in her life to be in you know it's a pretty tough facility absolutely and we've covered the her physical condition how is how is she mentally how what do you know she could be facing up to 15 years in prison she has no idea what the future holds for was the psychological impacts on there was she okay I mean I think given the the I want to emphasize the baseline that she's she's in jail and that's never good it's not good for any client I think given that baseline she's she's in very good shape she's helping actively with us to prepare the defense she's confident in her innocence and we're working with her and using her help we're providing her with documents to help with translation and things like that so she she is you know able to function and I think is trying to keep her eyes on working towards the defense we at some point may try to get her released pretrial again we're just looking through documents trying to find the proper evidence to do that and I think we may be able to do that hopefully in the next couple of weeks I saw us more about this crowdfunding campaign you've launched is it only money you're expecting to gain or hopefully a lot more heads turned towards this case well I think both we were lucky enough to have a generous American who had been paying legal fees for her through the Senate testimony and the other things that we're not public but obviously things get a lot more expensive once you're arrested and and charged and possibly a trial there's going to be millions of documents the government will produce that will have to go through in order defense and so I think that you know there came in need to be more fun so we opened the website in hopes that people could do that but I also hope that there's a number of evening even small donations at Marea butene to fund will be great because it shows her that people are thinking about her and haven't forgotten about her you know even if people have five dollars or ten dollars that's as important as hopefully some some people of means will donate more but I think that that it helps her to know that that people are concerned for her particularly in our home country but everywhere and there's been a lot of support that I've received in phone calls and emails from people both in America and abroad that do do feel for her and do believe in our innocence and what will happen if you don't raise enough money I'm not concerned about that I mean I believe here innocence and I will see this through kind of regardless but I mean finances do impact your ability to have a defense in terms of hiring experts and making sure all the documents get reviewed and things like that but I mean I'm with her and she's my client and I take my obligations very seriously I'm not going to be kind of intimidated by by any blowback in America about this case I'm happy to represent her and she's pled not guilty and I'm with her hundred percent do you think a case like this one needs to be dealt with in a higher court the way the system works it will be dealt with initially in the in the federal district court this is where where it it's gonna be resolved I think it's a very unusual case I think it presents legal issues that are novel I mean I think factually she's just innocent and that she's not was not functioning as an agent of the Russian Federation when she was in the u.s. she was simply a student and someone active kind of operating on her own account so to speak but I think even beyond that the statute she's charged under is an enormous Lea broad it does not require any particular conduct at all it just kind of says if you're operate in the US as a under the direction or control of a foreign government or foreign official kind of for any reason you can be prosecuted under this statute which is odd in that conduct that would otherwise be legal somehow becomes illegal if you're acting at the direction of a foreign government which is strange so there's no allegation here just so the viewers are clear there's no allegation of espionage there's no allegation of classified information it's no allegation she was paying anyone off there's no allegation she was recruiting spies none of the things you would typically see in an espionage case the allegations are fairly vanilla that she attended meetings of various groups that were public that she had dinners with various people and that she took a lot of selfies is I think a lot of people in their 20s do with with people she met and posted them on Facebook so this is not the kind of a typical this is no comparison to what the allegations were against for example Anna Chapman or others where there was actual whether they were true or not their actual allegations about use of sophisticated equipment and payoffs and spy rings and things like that and there's none of that here you
