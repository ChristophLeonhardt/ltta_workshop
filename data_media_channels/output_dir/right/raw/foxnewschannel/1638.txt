1
00:00:02,623 --> 00:00:04,992
I THINK WE CAN ONLY SAY, ARE

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:05,693
PEOPLE LITERALLY DEALING WITH

3
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:09,296
THEM RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF

4
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:11,165
DEALING WITH THE MEETING.

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:13,200
>> Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,772
PRETTY PASSIVE ON THAT MEETING

7
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:19,240
WITH KIM JONG UN, SEEMING TO

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,175
HOPE TO GET IT BACK ON TRACK.

9
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:23,344
AT THE NORTH KOREAN SENT OUT A

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,479
SHOT, IF YOU WILL COME ABOUT

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,448
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH

12
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,550
SOUTH KOREA.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,351
PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH THE

14
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:31,652
VICE PREMIER OF CHINA TODAY,

15
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:32,953
TWEETING OUT A PICTURE AND

16
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:35,156
SAYING THAT MEETING WENT WELL AS

17
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:36,357
CHINA PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE

18
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:38,759
OBVIOUSLY IN ALL OF THIS.

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,326
PLUS, THE CHINA TRADE

20
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:41,095
NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE STILL

21
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:41,562
CONTINUING.

22
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,365
WITH THAT, LET'S BRING IN OUR

23
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:44,665
PANEL.

24
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:48,536
JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL

25
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:51,705
POLITICAL REPORTER FOR AXIOS.

26
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:54,375
THE ASSOCIATE EDITOR AT REAL

27
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,344
CLEAR POLITICS, AND ELI LAKE,

28
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,747
COLUMNIST FOR A BLOOMBERG VIEW.

29
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:01,415
JONATHAN, WHAT ARE THE INNER

30
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:02,516
WORKINGS OF THE WHITE HOUSE

31
00:01:02,516 --> 00:01:03,250
THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES

32
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,953
OF THE SUMMIT ON JUNE 12TH?

33
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,055
I HEARD KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING,

34
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:09,190
IT COULD BE DELAYED.

35
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,760
>> I THINK IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN

36
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,460
UNEASINESS, ALMOST EVERYTHING

37
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,664
WAS GOING TO WELL FOR A WHILE.

38
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:20,234
KIM JONG UN WAS RELEASING THE

39
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:20,868
HOSTAGES AND THEATRICALLY

40
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:24,338
DESTROYING THE NUCLEAR FACILITY.

41
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:25,573
BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY

42
00:01:25,573 --> 00:01:26,874
ADVISOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN

43
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:27,775
SKEPTICAL ABOUT EVEN THE NOTION

44
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,743
OF TRUMP GOING OVER THERE AND

45
00:01:29,743 --> 00:01:30,744
MEETING WITH HIM.

46
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,213
HE HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS

47
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,782
CAROUSEL BEFORE, AND HE DOES NOT

48
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:35,749
TRUST THE NORTH KOREANS.

49
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:40,354
HE'S NEVER HAD FAITH IN THE IDEA

50
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:42,056
THAT YOU CAN TAKE THEM AT THEIR

51
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:42,957
WORD.

52
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:44,658
I THINK HE HAD A VERY TOUGH

53
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:47,661
HARD-LINE THERE WITH JOHN FULTON

54
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:49,597
WHO IS TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT

55
00:01:49,597 --> 00:01:55,135
EVERY DAY, AND THAT BEING SAID,

56
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:56,570
WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE

57
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,173
PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO THIS, ONCE

58
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:00,241
THE MEETING FACE-TO-FACE AND

59
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,642
THEY ARE CARRYING ON AS IF

60
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:04,044
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

61
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:05,946
>> Bret: SPEAKING OF BOLTON,

62
00:02:05,946 --> 00:02:06,981
HE WAS MENTIONED BY THE

63
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:08,348
NORTH KOREANS AND THE STATEMENT

64
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:08,782
SPECIFICALLY.

65
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,351
HE ALSO TOLD CHRIS WALLACE

66
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,352
SOMETHING THAT RAISED EYEBROWS

67
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,154
AND GOT SOME RESPONSE.

68
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:15,756
>> WE HAVE VERY MUCH IN MIND THE

69
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:19,126
LIBYA MODEL FROM 2003-2004.

70
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,128
THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENCES

71
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,663
IN THE LIBYAN PROGRAM WAS MUCH

72
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:24,565
SMALLER, BUT THAT WAS BASICALLY

73
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:26,567
THE AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO.

74
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:29,770
WE WILL WANT TO TEST NORTH KOREA

75
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,805
IN THIS FIRST MEETING FOR

76
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,575
EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE MADE

77
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,076
THAT STRATEGIC DECISION.

78
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,177
>> President Trump: THE LIBYAN

79
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:38,579
MODEL ISN'T THE MODEL THAT WE

80
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:41,181
HAVE AT ALL.

81
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,484
IN LIBYA, WE DECIMATED THAT

82
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,753
COUNTRY.

83
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,155
>> THE LIBYAN MODEL THAT BOLTON

84
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:49,990
IS TALKING ABOUT IS HOW THEY GOT

85
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,559
RID OF THEIR WEAPONS AND THEIR

86
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,029
ABILITY TO START ON THAT PROGRAM

87
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:55,696
ABILITY TO START ON THAT PROGRA

88
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:56,030
PROGRAM.

89
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,566
NOT THE ACTUAL END OF

90
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:01,368
MUAMMAR QADDAFI, AND HOW IT CAME

91
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:02,536
TO AN END.

92
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:05,339
>> WHILE THAT IS HOW THEY SEE IT

93
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,140
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

94
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,042
CONCERNED WITH AND THAT'S WHAT

95
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:10,044
PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERRED TO

96
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,580
TODAY.

97
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,949
AND FROM SOMEONE AT THE HESS

98
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:17,551
LEVELS OF THE GOVERNMENT, IT HAS

99
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:18,986
HAPPENED BEFORE.

100
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:20,587
HE ACTUALLY OFFERED THE

101
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,556
NORTH KOREAN LEADER SOME

102
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:25,259
PROTECTIONS TODAY, IF HE AGREES

103
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:25,793
TO DENUCLEARIZE.

104
00:03:25,793 --> 00:03:27,761
I DO THINK THAT THE

105
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,595
ADMINISTRATION, AND PARTICULARLY

106
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,630
THE PRESIDENT IS HANDLING THIS

107
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,232
IN A VERY SHREWD WAY, WHATEVER

108
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,768
IT IS, WHETHER IT IS SABER

109
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:37,671
RATTLING OR WHATEVER, THAT

110
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:39,139
KIM JONG UN LOON IS DOING BY

111
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:39,740
CANCELING TALKS WITH THE

112
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,546
SOUTH KOREANS AND THREATENING AL

113
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,947
THE TENSION, THE PRESIDENT SAID

114
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:48,782
I'M TRYING TO GIVE EVERYONE THE

115
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:49,984
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

116
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:52,386
THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO AVERT

117
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:55,022
WAR AND STILL TRYING TO CREATE

118
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:55,422
DISCUSSION.

119
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:57,358
I BET EVERYTHING JONATHAN IS

120
00:03:57,358 --> 00:03:59,960
SAYING IS TRUE ABOUT BOLTON'S

121
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,161
INFLUENCE AND TEMPERING THE

122
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,796
PRESIDENT'S EXPECTATIONS, BUT I

123
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:04,565
THINK THEY ARE HANDLING THE WAY

124
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,568
IT NEEDS TO BE HANDLED.

125
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:09,169
KIM JONG UN TOOK THOSE HOSTAGES,

126
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:09,837
TO RELEASE THEM.

127
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,739
SO FAR HE HAS BEEN WAY TOO

128
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,776
ACQUIESCENT IN HIS LANGUAGE, FOR

129
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,543
A LONG-STANDING GOAL OF THAT

130
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:19,613
REGIME TO BE BELIEVABLE.

131
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,015
AS THE PRESIDENT SAYS, WE WILL

132
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:21,382
SEE.

133
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:22,783
BUT THEY JUST NEED TO TRY TO GET

134
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:26,854
THE PROSPECT OF THIS ALIVE WELL

135
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:27,321
BEING CAUTIOUS.

136
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,356
>> Bret: ELI?

137
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:32,359
>> I WOULD SAY THAT I'VE BEEN

138
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,560
CONCERNED ABOUT THE NORTH KOREA

139
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,595
OUTREACH FOR SOME TIME, BUT IN

140
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,530
THE CONTEXT OF THE CHINA PART OF

141
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,367
THIS WHERE IT SEEMS THAT TRUMP

142
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,770
IS REVERSING HIMSELF ON THE ZTE

143
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,172
SANCTIONS, AND THIS IS AFTER A

144
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:47,975
LONG AND RIGOROUS LEGAL PROCESS.

145
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:50,277
I JUST THINK THAT ALL OF THIS IS

146
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:51,645
SENDING THE WRONG SIGNAL AT THIS

147
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:51,945
POINT.

148
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:54,681
THE UNITED STATES THAT CERTAIN

149
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,582
NORMS, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT

150
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,851
COMES TO ISSUES OF NUCLEAR

151
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:03,157
PLEURA FEDERATION

152
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,158
PROLIFERATION AND THINGS LIKE

153
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:04,458
THAT.

154
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,861
WHEN THE NORTH KOREANS TALK

155
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:08,729
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, WHAT

156
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,933
THEY MEAN IS BREAKING THE

157
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,567
U.S.-SOUTH KOREA ALLIANCE.

158
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,169
SO IF WE DON'T HAVE

159
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,571
CLARIFICATION AT THIS POINT ON

160
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,073
IT, I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

161
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,274
OPTIMISM FOR THESE TALKS.

162
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:21,575
AS MUCH AS I THINK IT'S

163
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:22,976
ADMIRABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

164
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,179
AT LEAST TRYING, AND HE COULD

165
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:26,980
USE SOMEONE LIKE JOHN BOLTON,

166
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,115
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR,

167
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:31,585
AS A BIT OF LEVERAGE AND PERHAPS

168
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,186
INTIMIDATE A TYRANT LIKE

169
00:05:32,186 --> 00:05:33,387
KIM JONG UN.

170
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:34,655
BUT THIS COULD BE VERY

171
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,022
TROUBLING.

172
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,790
OF COURSE THE LIBYA MODEL IS

173
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,591
WHAT WE ARE SEEKING AND WE WANT

174
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:39,393
TO GET RID OF THEIR NUCLEAR

175
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:39,827
PROGRAM.

176
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,430
WHAT ELSE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO

177
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,132
BE TALKING ABOUT?

178
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:47,134
>> Bret: YES.

179
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:53,507
LET'S DO SUMMIT CASINO.

180
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,946
AS IT'S MOVING FORWARD, AND

181
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,547
WHERE ARE YOUR CHIPS ON THE

182
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:05,352
ROAD, JONATHAN?

183
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:06,753
>> PROBABLY 60.

184
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:08,122
>> I THINK 75.

185
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:09,056
I THINK THE DATE COULD CHANGE

186
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,591
BUT I THINK IT WILL HAPPEN

187
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:12,860
BECAUSE KIM JONG UN WANT THAT TO

188
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,363
HAPPEN.

189
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,931
