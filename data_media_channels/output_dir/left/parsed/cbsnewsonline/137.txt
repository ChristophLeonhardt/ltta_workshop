SO JIM ASKED ME TO DO THIS. 
HE DID SWITCH FROM DEMOCRAT TO 
REPUBLICAN. 
YOU DON'T SEE THAT OFTEN. 
IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY, NO, 
I'M NOT COMING. 
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. 
I WATCHED THESE TOURNAMENTS. 
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR THESE 
TALENTED ATHLETES. 
WE ARE GATHERED HERE ON THE EVE 
OF THE FOURTH OF JULY TO 
CELEBRATE THE COURAGEOUS MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO MAKE FREEDOM 
POSSIBLE. OUR BRAVE 
SERVICEMEMBERS AND OUR 
WONDERFUL VETERANS. 
AND WE LOVE OUR VETERANS. 
FOR 242 YEARS, THAT IS A LONG 
TIME, AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE HAS 
ENDURED BECAUSE OF THE SWEAT, 
BLOOD, AND SACRIFICE OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES. 
WE MAY ADD A LITTLE THING 
CALLED SPACE FORCE. 
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WANTS TO 
HEAR THAT. 
BUT WE ARE THINKING SERIOUSLY 
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SPACE IS 
BECOMING IMPORTANT MILITARILY. 
IT IS THE GREATEST FORCE FOR 
PEACE AND JUSTICE IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE WORLD. 
DURING BOTH THE CIVIL WAR AND 
WORLD WAR II, THE GREENBRIER'S 
 
SOLDIERS. 
IT IS APPROPRIATE. 
TONIGHT AT THE GREENBRIER'S 
FIRST ANNUAL SALUTE TO SERVICE 
DINNER WE ARE CALLING UPON THIS 
RICH HISTORY AND WE ARE 
CARRYING ON THE PGAS PROUD 
LEGACY OF SUPPORTING AMERICA'S 
HEROES. 
JOINING US FOR TONIGHT CEREMONY 
ARE MANY INCREDIBLE GOLFERS WHO 
WILL BE COMPETING AT THE 
GREENBRIER THIS WEEK. AND I 
WILL BE WATCHING FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE WISHING I COULD PLAY LIKE 
THAT. 
AMONG THOSE WITH US, I JUST 
SAID HELLO TO BUBBA WATSON. 
HE IS HAVING A GOOD YEAR. 
HE IS HAVING A GOOD YEAR. 
KEEGAN BRADLEY. GREAT. 
THANK YOU. 
THAT SHORTER PUTTER IS WORKING. 
THE LONGEST HITTER I HAVE EVER 
SEEN, JOHN DALY. 
JOHN? 
I PLAYED WITH JOHN IN A 
TOURNAMENT THAT WE WON. 
HE WON AND THEN I GO BACK AND 
EVERYONE SAID HOW DID YOU DO? 
AND I SAID I WON. 
AND PHIL MICKELSON. 
I WILL NEVER FORGET. 
I DON'T THINK PHIL CAN REMEMBER 
THIS, BUT -- WHERE IS PHIL? 
HE SO INCREDIBLE. 
IT WAS ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO AND I 
WAS DONALD. AND THE PLACE IS 
PACKED WITH PEOPLE AND FEEL IS 
THERE AND HE IS ON THE THIRD 
HOLE AND IS A BIG DEAL AND A 
BIG TOURNAMENT AND HE SAID, OH, 
EXCUSE ME. 
HE HIT THE BALL AND IT WAS A 
THREE WOULD AND HE SAYS SO HOW 
IS EVERYTHING. 
AND I SAID, THAT IS A SPECIAL 
TALENT. 
THAT IS JUST THE OFFICE. 
IT IS AMAZING WHAT A GREAT 
CAREER AND WHAT A GREAT 
GENTLEMAN HE IS. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK JIM NANCE. 
JIM, WHEREVER YOU MAY BE. 
JIM DOES A GREAT JOB. 
AND SLUGGER WHITE. HE KEEPS 
EVERYONE ON THE SPIRIT HE HAS 
DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. 
I KNOW AT DORAL I TRIED TO MOVE 
THE TEES BACK AND HE WOULD NOT 
LET ME DO THAT. 
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. 
AND ALL OF THE PGA OFFICIALS, 
STAFF, AND VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR 
INCREDIBLY HARD WORK IN PUTTING 
THIS EVENT TOGETHER. 
AND THE JOB THAT JIM JUSTICE 
HAS DONE WITH THE COURSE IS 
SPECTACULAR. 
ALSO WITH US THIS EVENING IS 
THE ACTING VA SECRETARY, HE IS 
DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB AT THE 
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION, PETER 
O'ROURKE. 
PETER? 
GOOD JOB, PETER. 
YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AT 
THE VA. 
AND THE WEST VIRGINIA SENATOR, 
SHELLEY. 
A GOOD GOLFER. 
AND CONGRESSMAN MORGAN GRIFFITH 
AND ALEX MOONEY. 
A TREMENDOUS HELP TO ME. 
GETTING THINGS PASS. 
IT IS NOT EASY. 
IF I DID NOT INTRODUCE THEM, 
THEY WOULD NEVER VOTE FOR ME 
AGAIN. 
AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF 
YEAR TAXES. 
THAT WOULD BE THE END OF 
EVERYTHING. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR 
ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM WEST 
VIRGINIA, PATRICK MORRISSEY, 
WHO IS FIGHTING A GREAT RACE. 
PATRICK CHRIS --? 
RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. 
HE IS A TOUGH, STRONG GUY, AND 
HE RAN AN INCREDIBLE RACE 
AGAINST TALENTED PEOPLE AND HE 
WON. 
AND I SEE THE POLLS HAVE THIS 
VERY CLOSE. 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
HE HAS INCREDIBLE ENERGY AND 
STRENGTH AND HE LOVES THE 
PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA, LIKE, 
A LOT. 
GREAT JOB, PATRICK. 
THE MAJORITY WHIP, CAROL MILLER
, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING 
HERE. 
CAROL, GOOD LUCK IN THE RACE. 
I KNOW YOU WILL DO WELL. 
AND WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE WITH 
US THE ADJUTANT GENERAL OF WEST 
VIRGINIA, JAMES HOYER, OF THE 
NATIONAL GUARD. 
THANK YOU, GENERAL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
TOMORROW FAMILIES ACROSS OUR 
NATION WILL GATHER TO CELEBRATE 
THE FOURTH OF JULY. AND AS WE 
DO WE WILL THINK OF THE MEN AND 
WOMEN SERVING OVERSEAS AT THIS 
VERY MOMENT FAR AWAY FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES, PROTECTING AMERICA 
AND WATCHING OVER OUR PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE THERE AND THEY ARE 
WITH US AND BRAVE AND THESE ARE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
AND WE WILL THANK GOD FOR 
BLESSING US WITH THESE 
UNBELIEVABLE HEROES. 
TO EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT WHO 
HAS SERVED OUR NATION IN UNIFORM
, WOULD YOU PLEASE STAND SO WE 
CAN EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE. 
PLEASE STAND. 
PLEASE. 
TOUGH COOKIES. 
WHEN IT COMES TO ICE AND BORDER 
PATROL AND ALL OF THESE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE 
BEEN READING ABOUT WHO ARE DOING
AN UNREAL JOB, WE WANT BORDER 
SECURITY. 
WE WANT SECURITY IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE RESPECT ICE. 
THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. AND YOU 
HAVE TO BE TOUGH. 
AND WHEN THEY HAVE A PROBLEM 
WITH MS-13 GANGS AND ALL OF 
THESE OTHERS THAT CAME IN 
THROUGH THESE HORRIBLE AND WEAK 
IMMIGRATION LAWS, THAT SHELLEY 
WAS STRENGTHENING UP, WE NEED 
TO GET THEM DONE. 
WE NEED TOUGH LAWS AND WE NEED 
FAIR LAWS. 
BUT WHEN THESE PEOPLE COME INTO 
OUR COUNTRY AND COME IN 
ILLEGALLY AND THEN THEY ARE 
DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN 
YOU SEE NESTS OF MS-13, YOU 
KNOW, IT IS LIKE YOUR 
LIBERATING TOWNS. 
WE SEND ICE IN, AND FOR ICE IT 
IS JUST ANOTHER DAY LIKE BILL, 
JOHN, AND BUBBA. 
LIKE THE WAY THEY PLAY GOLF. 
THEY GO AND THEY PLAY. 
THEY DON'T KNOW. 
IT IS HARD. 
THESE GUYS, THEY TAKE THEM OUT 
OF THERE SO FAST. 
THEY ARE NOT AFRAID OF 
ANYTHING. 
IT IS LIKE YOUR LIBERATING A 
TOWN. 
LIKE IN A WAR YOU LIBERATE A 
TOWN OR AREA. 
AND ICE GOES IN THERE AND 
SOMETIMES THEY HAVE TO GO IN 
SWINGING. THEY DON'T MIND. 
THEY ARE TOUGH. 
AND THEN I HEAR THE DEMOCRATS 
SAY WE WANT TO ABANDON ICE. WE 
ARE NOT ABANDONING ICE AND WE 
ARE NOT ABANDONING OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
JUST THE OPPOSITE. 
SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A 
LEGENDARY HERO FROM WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
HE FOUGHT IN IWO JIMA. 
IN FEBRUARY 1945 HE VOLUNTEERED 
TO DASH STRAIGHT INTO ANY FIRE 
TO DESTROY THE ENEMY AND CLEAR 
PATH FOR AMERICAN FORCES TO 
CONTINUE FORWARD. 
HE WENT RIGHT INTO THE MACHINE 
GUN NESTS. 
JOHN DALY WOULD NOT DO THAT, 
AND -- JOHN, WOULD YOU DO THAT? 
IN THE FACE OF BULLETS AND 
BAYONETS HE RISKED HIS LIFE FOR 
HIS BROTHERS IN ARMS AND HE 
EARNED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL 
OF HONOR. 
TODAY WOODY WILLIAMS IS 94 
YEARS OLD AND HE HAS DEDICATED 
HIS LIFE TO SUPPORTING GOLDSTAR 
FAMILIES AND BUILDING MEMORIALS 
TO HONOR FALLEN SERVICEMEMBERS. 
IN 2016 THOUSANDS WERE MOVED BY 
HIS PATRIOTIC WORDS WHEN HE 
SPOKE AT ONE OF OUR RALLIES IN 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
HE WAS INCREDIBLE. 
I STILL REMEMBER IT. 
WE REMEMBER THAT WONDERFUL 
MOMENT WHEN HE FLIPPED THE COIN 
AT THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL. 
WOODY, YOU ARE A NATIONAL 
TREASURE. 
AND WE THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM
OF OUR HEARTS. 
WOODY, THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, WOODY. 
A BRAVE MAN. 
I GIVE A LOT OF CONGRESSIONAL 
MEDALS OF HONOR. 
WHEN I SAY A LOT, IT IS ONE OF 
MY GREATEST HONORS TO DO THAT. 
WOODY, FANTASTIC. 
SO OFTEN I'M GIVING THEM WHERE 
THEY ARE JUST NOT AROUND AND WE 
HEAR THE STORIES AND THEIR 
FAMILIES ARE THERE AND EVERYONE 
IS PROUD. 
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE WE 
HAVE ONE THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO 
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING LIKE 
YOU, WOODY. 
WHERE ALSO DEEPLY MOVED AND 
HONORED TO BE JOINED BY A 
GOLDSTAR SPOUSE WHO NOTES THE 
CHOOSE PRICE OF FREEDOM. 
CHRISTINE'S HUSBAND WAS A 
SERGEANT IN THE 82nd AIRBORNE 
DIVISION OF THE ARMY. 
CHRIS WAS KILLED IN ACTION IN 
IRAQ IN 2005. 
CHRISTINE, TONIGHT WE SEND THE 
LOVE AND GRATITUDE OF OUR 
ENTIRE NATION. YOUR HUSBAND WAS 
SPECIAL MAN. 
WE WILL HOLD YOU AND YOUR 
PRECIOUS FAMILY IN OUR HEARTS 
FOREVER. 
CHRISTINE, WHERE ARE YOU? 
CHRISTINE? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU, CHRISTINE. 
AND, CHRISTINE, THROUGH YOUR 
HUSBAND'S HEROIC SACRIFICE, HE 
HAS ACHIEVED IMMORTALITY. 
AND OUR DEBT IS ETERNAL AND 
EVERLASTING. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
FROM BUNKER HILL TO THE BEACHES 
OF NORMANDY AND THE JUNGLES OF 
VIETNAM, AMERICA AND AMERICANS 
IN EVERY GENERATION HAVE GIVEN 
THEIR LAST BREATH AND FINAL 
MOMENTS ON THIS EARTH IN 
DEFENSE OF THEIR COUNTRY AND 
COUNTRYMEN. 
OUR SERVICEMEMBERS HAVE 
FULFILLED THEIR DUTY TO AMERICA.
NOW, WE MUST FULFILL OUR SACRED 
DUTY TO THEM AND WE MUST 
PROTECT THOSE WHO PROTECT US. 
WHEN OUR SERVICEMEMBERS ARE IN 
UNIFORM, IT IS OUR OBLIGATION 
TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE 
FINEST EQUIPMENT, THE FINEST 
TRAINING, CARE, RESOURCES, AND 
BETTER THAN ANY MILITARY ON 
EARTH. 
AND WHEN THEY RETURN TO 
CIVILIAN LIFE, WE MUST ENSURE 
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE 
BEST CARE, TREATMENT, AND 
SUPPORT IN THE WORLD. 
WE ARE RESTORING AMERICAN 
SECURITY BY REBUILDING OUR 
GREAT MILITARY. 
WE HAVE SECURED THIS YEAR, WITH 
THE HELP OF SHELLEY AND YOUR 
GREAT CONGRESSMAN, A RECORD 
$700 BILLION FOR OUR MILITARY, 
AND NEXT YEAR $716 BILLION, THE 
MOST AMOUNT EVER. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MILITARY. 
AND WHEN HAVE WE NEEDED IT MORE?
WHEN? 
THINK ABOUT IT. 
WE ARE BUILDING IT SO BIG, SO 
POWERFUL, SO STRONG, AND 
HOPEFULLY, WE WILL NEVER HAVE 
TO USE IT. 
AND AS THE GOLFERS CAN TELL 
YOU, THE STRONGER WE GET, THE 
LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT WE HAVE 
TO USE IT. 
WE WILL BE AT A POINT THE LIKES 
OF WHICH WE HAVE NEVER BEEN AS 
A POWER, AND AGAIN, HOPEFULLY 
NEVER HAVING TO USE THAT 
INCREDIBLE EQUIPMENT, THE BEST 
IN THE WORLD IN THE USA. WE 
ALSO GAVE OUR GREAT WARRIORS 
THEIR LARGEST PAY RAISE IN 
EIGHT YEARS. 
SO THEY GOT A PAY RAISE
I SIGNED INTO LAW JUST RECENTLY 
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY 
LEGISLATION.
THEY COULD BE LATE, THEY COULD 
BE BAD. 
THEY COULD HAVE LOT OF 
PROBLEMS. 
THEY COULD TALK BACK TO YOU. 
YOU COULDN'T DO A THING. 
FOR 40 YEARS THEY'VE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET IT PASSED AND WE 
GOT IT PASSED. 
IT'S CALLED VA ACCOUNTABILITY 
AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE WE NOW 
LOOK AT THE PERSON THAT VIOLATES
VETERANS AND WE SAY JIM, GET 
THE HELL OUT OF HERE. 
YOU'RE FIRED. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. 
AS PROMISED, WE OPENED THE 
WHITE HOUSE VA HOTLINE AND HAVE 
INSTITUTED NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON 
WAIT TIME AND QUALITY CARE. 
WE ARE PROCESSING VETERAN 
CLAIMS MORE QUICKLY THAN EVER 
BEFORE. 
WE'RE EXPANDING HEALTHCARE SO 
THAT OUR GREAT VETERANS CAN GET 
CARE ANYWHERE ANY TIME AND 
MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, I USED 
TO BE VERY PROUD OF MYSELF WHEN 
I'D BE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
AND I'D SAY WHY DON'T THEY JUST 
PAY A DOCTOR TO TAKE CARE 
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES 
VETERANS WILL STAND IN  -- 
ONLINE FOR DAYS AND DAYS, FOR 
WEEK. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE PHIL MICKELSON 
GOING TO THE DOCTOR AND THEY'LL 
SAY GOOD. 
HE SHOULD BE THERE IN ABOUT 12 
DAYS. 
12 DAYS! 
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE, PHIL, 
RIGHT? 
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE. 
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOW IF 
THERE'S A WAIT, IF THERE'S A 
PROBLEM, YOU'RE GOING TO A 
DOCTOR THAT MIGHT BE RIGHT 
ACROSS THE STREET. 
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TAKEN CARE 
OF IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE WOULD 
WAIT SO LONG. 
YOU'D WAIT WEEKS AND LITERALLY 
COME BACK DAY AFTER DAY. 
NOW WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED VA 
CHOICE. 
I USED TO SAY WHY DON'T THEY DO 
THAT? 
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. 
I THOUGHT I WAS TOTALLY 
BRILLIANT. 
I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE GREAT E 
IDEA. 
THEN I WENT TO TELL -- GREATEST 
IDEA. 
THEN I WENT TO TELL PEOPLE 
ABOUT IT. 
THEY SAID THEY'VE BEEN TRYING 
TO GET IT PASSED FOR YEARS. 
NOW WE HAVE VA CHOICE. 
IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT, YOU GO TO 
A DOCTOR. 
WE PAY THE DOCTOR. 
SO IT'S GREAT AND WE'RE VERY 
PROUD OF THAT AND WE'RE VERY 
PROUD OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT 
THE VA. 
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR 
SECURITY AS A NATION, WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT WE PLUS HAVE 
ECONOMIC STRENGTH AS WELL -- 
MUST HAVE ECONOMIC STRENGTH AS 
WELL AND NOBODY BELIEVES IT. 
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID IT, THEY 
WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT A HORRIBLE 
THING TO SAY. 
WHAT AN EXAGGERATION, THE FAKE 
NEWS. 
THEY'RE ALL BACK THERE. 
THEY'RE ALL BACK THERE. 
 
>> IF I WERE TO SHOUT A 70 
FIVE, THEY'D SAY THERE'S NO -- 
75, THEY'D SAY THERE'S NO WAY 
HE COULD DO IT. 
THERE'S NO WAY. 
THEY MIGHT BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT 
ACTUALLY, BUT THEY ARE BACK 
THERE. 
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID THERE'S NO 
WAY. 
3.4MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE 
ELECTION DAY. 
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID AND A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SAID. 
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE AT THE 
LOWEST POINT IN 44 YEARS. 
THAT MEANS PEOPLE ARE WORKING 
AGAIN. 
 
>> AFRICAN AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE LOWEST IT'S 
EVER BEEN. 
IT'S AT THE LOWEST IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
REMEMBER I USED TO SAY WHAT DO 
YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
VOTE FOR TRUMP. 
HISPANIC AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT, 
THE LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
 
A BY THE WAY WOMEN -- BY THE 
WAY, WOMEN, I WAS SAYING TWO 
WEEKS AGO 21 YEARS. 
NOW I'M SAYING 66 YEARS. 
I THINK WITHIN TWO WEEKS I'LL 
BE SAYING THE LOWEST IN 
HISTORY. 
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN 66 
YEARS. 
LAST YEAR IN WEST VIRGINIA PER 
CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME GREW 
MORE THAN 40% FASTER THAN THE 
NATIONAL AVERAGE. 
COAL EXPERTS, YOU KNOW I SAID 
COAL, COAL, CLEAN COAL, JIM, 
CLEAN COAL, RIGHT? 
WHAT THEY CAN DO NOW IS 
INCREDIBLE WITH COAL. 
CLEAN COAL EXPORTS SKYROCKETED 
BY MORE THAN 60% NATIONWIDE AND 
I'M SO PROUD OF THAT. 
WHEN WE CAME HERE, I MET WITH 
THE MINERS AND I TALKED TO THE 
MINERS ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY OF 
LIFE. 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT 
IT. 
THEY LOVE DIGGING COAL. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY LIKE. 
THEY LOVE. 
THEIR GRANDFATHER'S, THEIR 
FATHERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND 
COAL IS COMING BACK AND IT'S 
ALSO COMING BACK FOR ANOTHER 
REASON, NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
YOUR GOVERNOR KNOWS VERY WELL 
AND YOUR SENATOR KNOWS VERY 
WELL WHAT THAT MEANS. 
WITH COAL YOU BOMB A PIPELINE, 
THAT'S THE END OF THE PIPELINE. 
WITH COAL THAT STUFF IS 
INDESTRUCTIBLE. 
YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND ON A 
TRUCK. 
YOU CAN DUMP IT AT THE PLANT. 
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL -- 
IT CAN RAIN ON TOP OF IT FOR A 
LONG TIME, RIGHT, JIM? 
CAN RAIN LIKE CRAZY. 
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, 
SNOW, SLEET, WIND, YOU JUST 
DUMP IT. 
IT'S THERE. 
YOU HIT THOSE PIPELINES, THAT'S 
THE END OF IT. 
YOU SAY MAN, WE BETTER GO OUT 
AND START CUTTING LUMBER. 
SO FOR NATIONAL SECURITY 
PURPOSES -- I DON'T THINK 
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH -- 
COAL. 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN 
BECAUSE WE'RE FINALLY PUTTING 
AMERICA FIRST. 
WE'RE PUTTING OUR COUNTRY 
FIRST. 
TOMORROW WE COMMEMORATE 242 
YEARS SINCE OUR FOREFATHERS 
ADOPTED THE DECLARATION OF 
INDEPENDENCE. 
IN THEIR QUEST TO BECOME A 
SOVEREIGN NATION THEY KNEW THEY 
WOULD HAVE TO DEFEAT THE MOST 
POWERFUL MILITARY ON LAND OR ON 
SEA. 
THEY KNEW THAT. 
THEY KNEW THAT AS THEY MET 
THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF 
BRITISH TROOPS WERE 
DISEMBARKING OUTSIDE OF NEW 
YORK CITY PREPARING TO CRUSH 
THE REVOLUTION. 
THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH IT 
QUICKLY. 
THEY WEREN'T EVEN ACTUALLY 
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. 
THESE PAYOUTS  -- PATRIOTS KNEW 
THAT THEIR LIVES, THEIR 
FORTUNES AND SACRED HONOR WERE 
ON THE LINE. 
THEY RISKED IT ALL FOR THE 
PROMISE OF MORE OF A JUST AND 
BETTER FUTURE. 
THEY WANTED THIS GREAT FUTURE 
IN THIS INCREDIBLE LAND. 
THEY MADE THE SAME BRAVE CHOICE 
AS COUNTLESS OTHERS WHO 
FOLLOWED IN THE GENERATIONS 
AFTER THEM, THE CHOICE TO STAND 
STRONG FOR THEIR FAMILIES, 
THEIR PRINCIPLES, THEIR PRIDE 
AND THEIR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS. 
EVERY TIME WE SEE AN AMERICAN 
IN UNIFORM, ANY TIME WE HAVE 
THE CHANCE TO SHAKE THE HAND OF 
A VETERAN AND WHENEVER WE HEAR 
THE STORIES OF OUR WARRIORS, WE 
ARE REMINDED HOW TRULY BLESSED 
WE ARE TO BE AMERICAN AND TO 
LIVE IN THIS LAND OF OUR GREAT 
HEROES, YOU, OUR GREAT HEROES. 
THIS 4th OF JULY LET US PLEDGE 
TO RENEW THE BONDS OF LOVE AND 
LOYALTY THAT UNITE US TOGETHER 
AS AMERICANS. 
LET US PLEDGE TO EXPAND THE 
BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY, 
PROSPERITY AND JUSTICE TO ALL 
OF OUR CITIZENS AND LET US 
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ONE 
PEOPLE AND ONE NATION SALUTING 
ONE GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU TO EVERY 
ONE OF THESE INCREDIBLE 
ATHLETES HERE TODAY. 
THESE ARE PGA PLAYERS. 
THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLY TALENTED 
PEOPLE. 
THEY'RE TALENTED IN THEIR MIND 
AND IN THEIR BODY. 
THEIR MUSCLES ARE STRONG, BUT 
THEIR MIND HAS TO BE STRONGER. 
IT'S TOUGH.  
AND THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. 
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
SO I WANT THANK ALL OF YOU FOR 
BEING HERE TONIGHT. 
IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME, 
ESPECIALLY AS A GOLFER. 
IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME. 
I WANT TO THANK BIG JIM 
JUSTICE. 
STAND UP, BIG JIM. 
COME ON. 
 
>> HE'S ABOUT 6' 10 AND HE 
WEIGHS ABOUT -- I'M NOT GOING 
TO SAY 450. 
I WON'T DO THAT TO YOU, JIM, 
BUT HE'S A BIG MAN AND HE'S 
DONE A GREAT JOB. 
DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST VIRGINIA 
IS SECOND IN THE NATION IN THE 
PERCENTAGE INCREASE OF GDP. 
THINK OF WHAT THAT MEANS. 
JIM JUST SAID BEFORE WE MET 
TRUMP THAT NUMBER WAS NOT GOOD. 
PRETTY CLOSE TO LAST, RIGHT? 
AND COMBINATIONS OF A LOT OF 
GOOD PEOPLE WITH SHELLY AND YOU 
AND US, BUT NOW THINK OF THAT. 
TEXAS WAS FIRST, TEXAS DOING A 
GREAT JOB, GREAT GOVERNOR 
THERE, TOO, BUT TEXAS WAS 
FIRST. 
WEST VIRGINIA WAS SECOND 
PERCENTAGE INCREASE OF GDP. 
THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE 
ACCOMPLISHMENT IN A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME. 
 
INCREDIBLE. 
I WANT IT THANK EVERYONE AT THE 
GREENBRIER FOR MAKING THIS 
TOURNAMENT A BEAUTIFUL TRIBUTE 
TO OUR MILITARY ND THANKS 
AGAIN TO ALL OF THE VETERANS 
HERE TONIGHT AND ALL ACROSS 
AMERICA. 
WE LOVE YOU. 
WE THANK YOU AND WE WILL NEVER 
E FORGET YOU. 
GOD BLESS -- EVER FORGET YOU. 
GOD BLESS OUR VETERANS. 
GOD BLESS AMERICA AND HAPPY 
INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THIS IS A GREAT HONOR. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU.

HE DID THAT IN A VERY PUBLIC 
WAY AT AN EVENT WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WHERE MINERS WERE ON THE

VITAL INDUSTRY FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA, BUT THIS WAS THE 
PRESIDENT'S THIRD VISIT TO WEST

COURT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A A 
DIFFERENT COURT WHO MAY CAST -- 
A DIFFERENT COURT WHO MAY CAST 
THE KEY FIFTH VOTE. 
YOU CAN BET THAT AFFIRMATIVE 
ACTION WILL BE A MAJOR ISSUE AT 
THESE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS. 
>> JAN CRAWFORD, THANK YOU. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOUBLING 
DOWN ON HIS CALLS FOR NATO 
MEMBERS TO SPEND WHAT HE SAYS 
IS THEIR FAIR SHARE ON DEFENSE. 
THE CALL COMES ABOUT A WEEK 
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT IS SET TO 
MEET WITH KEY ALLIES AT THE 
ANNUAL NATO SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS. 
MAJOR GARRETT REPORTS FROM THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> Reporter:  AHEAD OF NEXT 
WEEK'S NATO SUMMIT IN BRUSSELS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT A LETTER 
TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF NORWAY 
MAKING CLEAR HE WILL NOT RELENT 
ON HIS CRITICISM OF NATO 
ALLIES' LAGGING DEFENSE 
BUDGETS. 
NORWAY THE PRESIDENT WROTE 
REMAINS THE ONLY NATO ALLY 
SHARING A BORDER WITH RUSSIA 
THAT LACKS A CREDIBLE PLAN TO 
SPEND 2% OF ITS GROSS DOMESTIC 
PRODUCT ON DEFENSE. 
NORWAY IS FAR FROM ALONE AND 
THE PRESIDENT HAS REPORTEDLY 
SENT SIMILAR LETTERS TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
OF THE 28 NATO NATIONS ONLY 
THREE BESIDES THE UNITED STATES 
SPENT THE PROMISED 2% OF GDP 
LAST YEAR ON DEFENSE. 
THROUGHOUT HIS PRESIDENCY MR. 
TRUMP HAS PRODDED NATO NATIONS 
TO SPEND MORE. 
>> WHICH MANUFACTURE THEM -- 
MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN 
DOING. 
MANY OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN EVEN 
CLOSE. 
>> Reporter:  EUROPEAN ALLIES 
ARE HOPING NEXT WEEK'S SUMMIT 
GOES BETTER THAN LAST MONTH'S 
G7 MEETING IN CANADA WHICH WAS 
MARKED BY TENSE EXCHANGES 
BETWEEN MR. TRUMP AND OTHER 
WORLD LEADERS OVER TRADE. 
>> IF THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT 
A WEEKEND SURROUNDED BY ALL 
SORTS OF LOVELY PEOPLE WAS 
GOING TO TRANSFORM THE 
PRESIDENT'S OUTLOOK ON TRADE 
AND THE WORLD, THEN WE DIDN'T 
QUITE PERHAPS MEET THAT BAR. 
>> Reporter:  SINCE THEN THE 
TRADE WAR HAS ONLY RATCHETED 
UP. 
HARLEY-DAVIDSON  ANNOUNCED IT 
WOULD MOVE SOME MOTORCYCLE 
PRODUCTION OVERSEAS TO AVOID 
EUROPEAN TARIFFS AND CANADA 
ANNOUNCED RETALIATORY TARIFFS 
ON MORE THAN $12 BILLION WORTH 
OF U.S. IMPORTS. 
>>> CBS NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT MAJOR GARRETT IS 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
MAJOR, THE PRESIDENT'S 
FRUSTRATION WITH NATO SPENDING 
IS NOT NEW, BUT WHAT'S 
DIFFERENT NOW? 
>> Reporter:  THAT IT IS MORE 
SPECIFIC AND IT'S HAPPENING IN 
PROXIMITY TO HIS FIRST 
SCHEDULED MEETING WITH RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND 
EUROPEANS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY 
ARE NERVOUS ABOUT TWO TREND 
LINES OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. 
ONE, THIS MOVEMENT THAT SEEMS 
INEXORABLE TOWARDS A TRADE WAR. 
LINGERING TRADE DISPUTES ARE 
NOW BECOMING MANIFEST IN 
TARIFFS AND COUNTER TARIFFS. 
THAT'S ONE DISPUTE AND THIS 
LONG RUNNING DISPUTE OVER NATO 
MEMBER NATIONS FAILING TO MEET 
THEIR PLEDGED 2% OF GDP 
EXPENDITURE ON DEFENSE. 
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS CORRECT 
WHEN HE SAYS MANY NATIONS ARE 
LAGGING AND THEY'VE PROMISED 
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS TO LIVE UP 
TO THIS. 
NONE OF THAT IS FACTUALLY 
INCORRECT. 
EUROPEAN LEADERS AND THEIR 
PARLIAMENTS OR POLITICAL 
ENTITIES OFTEN COUNTER YES, 
WE'VE MADE THAT PLEDGE, BUT WE 
HAVE OTHER POLITICAL REALITIES 
WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT YOU 
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS LOOK, I'VE 
EXPENDED MY OWN POLITICAL 
CAPITAL TO GET DEFENSE SPENDING 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
YOU NEED TO DO THE SAME. 
SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT NATO 
GRIEVANCES, LONG EXPRESSED BY 
DONALD TRUMP AS A CANDIDATE AND 
AS PRESIDENT, IS THEY'RE NOW 
RIGHT ALONGSIDE HIS TRADE 
DISPUTES AND WHAT LOOKS TO BE
