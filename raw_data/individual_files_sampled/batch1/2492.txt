he doesn't sound that much like a maverick although he owns the Dallas Mavericks however he is refreshingly interested in ballot access he wants people to have a chance to have a chance on the ballot so that candidates can give voters more meaning to vote because there's more choice so I like that about him as far as other issues remains to be seen but there's a reason why his publicist got him on Meet the Press a few weeks ago he's got ambitions I think in 2020 he definitely run as a third-party candidate I don't think he can abide by what's been called the the Trump dump the Republican Party I and he certainly is not going to have a chance in a democratic party of Hillary's electrics can run for reelection so he'll listen he'll try to listen to ross perot's example and see what he can do in a three-way race he sees the polls you know sixty percent of people would like a viable third party etc so he's got the money and he's got a personality
