>> GOOD DAY.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABOUT TO 
ANNOUNCE A NEW STRATEGY ON IRAN 
THAT'S HE'S DESERT FIEING THE 
NUCLEAR DEAL PUT IN PLACE BY 
PRESIDENT OBAMA.
THE U.N. OUR ALLIES EVEN THE 
PRESIDENT'S TOP ADVISORS ALL 
AGREE IRAN IS ABIDING BY THE 
AGREEMENT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING THIS 
ACTION TODAY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T 
BELIEVE IT WAS TOUGH ENOUGH.
I WANT TO BRING IN JON KARL.
JON, THE PRESIDENT PROMISED TO 
RIP UP THE DEAL ON THE FIRST DAY
OF HIS PRESIDENCY.
THE ACTION HE'S TAKING TODAY 
DOESN'T DO THAT. 
>> THIS DOES NOT DO THAT.
IT'S A HALFWAY MEASURE THAT 
GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SAY HE DOES NOT 
LIKE THE DEAL AND AT THE VERY 
LEAST IRAN IS VIOLATING THE 
SPIRIT OF IT.
IT DOES NOT RIP IT UP.
DOING SO WOULD EFFECTIVELY MAKE 
THE WORST DEAL EVER EVEN WORSE.
IRAN GOT THE BENEFIT OF THIS 
AGREEMENT UPFRONT.
IF THEY RIP THE AGREEMENT UP 
NOW, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GO 
BACK TO DOING WHAT WAS THEIR 
PART OF THE AGREEMENT. 
>> HERE'S THE PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, AS 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
MY HIGHEST OBLIGATION IS TO 
INSURE THE SAFETY AND SECURITY 
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HISTORY HAS SHOWN THE LONGER WE 
IGNORE A THREAT THE MORE 
DANGEROUS THAT THREAT BECOMES.
FOR THIS REASON UPON TAKING 
OFFICE, I'VE ORDERED A COMPLETE 
STRATEGIC REVIEW OF OUR POLICY 
TOWARD THE ROGUE REGIME IN IRAN.
THAT REVIEW IS NOW COMPLETE.
TODAY I AM ANNOUNCING OUR 
STRATEGY ALONG WITH SEVERAL 
MAJOR STEPS WE'RE TAKING TO 
CONFRONT THE REIGNING REGIME'S 
HOSTILE ACTIONS AND TO INSURE 
IRAN NEVER -- AND I MEAN 
NEVER -- ACQUIRES A NUCLEAR 
WEAPON.
OUR POLICY IS BASED ON A 
CLEAR-EYED ASSESSMENT OF THE 
IRANIAN DICTATORSHIP, ITS 
SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM AND IT 
CONTINUING AGGRESSION IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST AND ALL AROUND THE 
WORLD.
IRAN IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF A 
FANATICAL REGIME THAT SEIZED 
POWER IN 1979 AND FORCED A PROUD
PEOPLE TO SUBMIT TO ITS 
EXTREMIST RULE.
THIS RADICAL REGIME HAS RAIDED 
THE WEALTH OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S
OLDEST AND MOST VIBRANT NATIONS 
AND SPREAD DEATH, DESTRUCTION 
AND CHAOS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE.
BEGINNING IN 1979 AGENTS OF THE 
IRANIAN REGIME ILLEGALLY SEIZED 
THE U.S. EMBASSY IN TEHRAN AND 
HELD MORE THAN 60 AMERICANS 
HOSTAGE DURING THE 444 DAYS OF 
THE CRISIS.
THE IRANIAN-BACKED TERRORIST 
GROUP HTWICE BOMBED OUR EMBASSY 
ONCE IN 1983 AND AGAIN IN 1984.
ANOTHER IRANIAN BOMBING KILLED 
241 AMERICANS.
SERVICE MEMBERS THEY WERE IN 
THEIR BARRACKS IN BEIHRUT IN 
1993.
IN 1996 THEY BOMBED HOUSE NG 
ASSAD I CSAUDI RAB I CAN'T.
OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSIES IN 
KENYA, TANZANIA AND KILLING 224 
PEOPLE AND WOUNDING MORE THAN 
4,000 OTHERS.
THE REGIME HARBORED HIGH LEVEL 
TERRORISTS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
9/11 ATTACKS INCLUDING OSAMA BIN
LADEN'S SON.
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN GROUPS 
SUPPORTED BY IRAN HAVE KILLED 
HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN MILITARY 
PERSONNEL.
THE IRANIAN'S DICTATORSHIP 
AGGRESSION CONTINUES TO THIS 
DAY.
THE REGIME REMAINS THE WORLD'S 
LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF 
TERRORISM AND PROVIDES 
ASSISTANCE TO AL QUAEDA, THE 
TALIBAN, HA MASS AND OTHER 
TERRORIST NETWORKS.
IT DEVELOPS, DEPLOYS AND PRO 
LIVE RATES MISSILES THAT 
THREATEN AMERICAN TROOPS AND OUR
ALLIES.
IT HARASSES AMERICAN SHIPS AND 
THREATEN FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION 
IN THE ARAB JANUARY GULF AND RED
SEA.
IT I AM PRISONS AMERICANS ON 
FALSE CHARGES.
IT LAUNCHES CYBER ATTACKS 
AGAINST OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, 
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND MILITARY.
THE UNITED STATES IS FAR FROM 
THE ONLY TARGET OF THE IRANIAN 
DICTATORSHIP'S LONG CAMPAIGN OF 
BLOOD SHED.
THE REGIME VIOLENTLY SUPPRESSES 
ITS OWN CITIZENS.
IT SHOT UNARMED STUDENT PRO 
PROTESTERS IN THE STREET DURING 
THE GREEN REVOLUTION.
THIS REGIME HAS FUELED VIOLENCE 
IN IRAQ AND VICIOUS CIVIL WARS 
IN YEMEN AND SYRIA.
IN SYRIA THE IRANIAN REGIME 
SUPPORTED THE ATROCITIES OF 
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME AND 
CONDONED HIS USE OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS AGAINST HELPLESS SI 
VIVIANS INCLUDING MANY MANY 
CHILDREN.
GIVEN THE REGIME'S PAST AND 
PRESENT WE SHOULD NOT TAKE 
LIGHTLY ITS SINISTER VISION FOR 
THE FUTURE.
THE REGIME'S TWO FAVORITE CHANTS
ARE DEATH TO AMERICA AND DEATH 
TO ISRAEL ICING THE GRAVITY OF 
THE SITUATION THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY 
COUNCIL WANTED TO STOP THE 
PURSUIT WITH A WIDE AYE RARE OF 
SANCTIONS.
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
LIFTED THE SANCTIONS RIGHT 
BEFORE WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE 
TOTAL COLLAPSE OF THE IRANIAN 
REGIME.
THROUGH THE DEEPLY CONTROVERSIAL
2015 NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.
IT'S KNOWN AS THE JOINT 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION OR 
JCPOA.
AS I HAVE SAID MANY TIMES THE 
IRAN DEAL WAS ONE OF THE WORST 
AND MOST ONE-SIDED TRANSACTIONS 
THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER 
ENTERED INTO.
THE SAME MIND SET THAT PRODUCED 
THIS DEAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
YEARS OF TERRIBLE TRADE DEALS 
THAT HAVE SACRIFICED SO MANY 
MILLIONS OF JOBS IN OUR COUNTRY 
TO THE BENEFIT OF OTHER 
COUNTRIES.
WE NEED NEGOTIATORS WHO 
REPRESENT AMERICAN'S INTERESTS.
THE NUCLEAR DEAL PROVIDING 
URGENTLY NEEDED RELIEF FROM THE 
INTENTION DOMESTIC PRESSURE THE 
SANCTIONS HAD CREATED.
IT ALSO GAVE THE REGIME A 
FINANCIAL BOOST AND OVER $100 
BILLION ITS GOVERNMENT COULD USE
TO FUND TERRORISM.
THE REGIME ALSO RECEIVED A 
MASSIVE CASH SETTLEMENT OF 
$1.7 BILLION FROM THE UNITED 
STATES, A LARGE PORTION OF WHICH
WAS PHYSICALLY LOADED ON TO AN 
AIRPLANE AND FLOWN INTO IRAN.
JUST IMAGINE THE SIGHT OF THOSE 
HUGE PILES OF MONEY BEING HAULED
OFF BY THE IRANIANS WAITING AT 
THE AIRPORT FOR THE CASH.
I WONDER WERE ALL THAT MONEY 
WENT.
WORST OF ALL THE DEAL ALLOWS 
IRAN TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING 
CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF ITS NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM AND IMPORTANTLY IN JUST 
A FEW YEARS AS KEY RESTRICTIONS 
DISAPPEAR, IRAN CAN SPRINT 
TOWARDS A RAPID NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
BREAK OUT.
IN OTHER WORDS, WE GOT WEAK 
INSPECTIONS FOR EXCHANGE FOR NO 
MORE THAN A PURELY SHORT TERM 
AND TEMPORARY DELAY IN IRAN'S 
PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A DEAL 
THAT AT BEST ONLY DELAYS IRAN'S 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY FOR A SHORT 
PERIOD OF TIME.
THIS AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES IS UNACCEPTABLE.
IN OTHER COUNTRIES THEY THINK IN
TERMS OF 100 YEAR INTERVALS, NOT
JUST A FEW YEARS AT A TIME.
THE SADDEST PART WAS ALL THE 
MONEY WAS PAID UPFRONT RATHER 
THAN THE END OF THE DEAL WHEN 
THEY SHOW THEY HAVE PLAYED BY 
THE RULES.
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
THAT'S WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS COMMITTED
MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE 
AGREEMENT.
FOR EXAMPLE, ON TWO SEPARATE 
OCCASIONS THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THE
LIMIT OF 130 METRIC TONS OF 
HEAVY WATER.
UNTIL RECENTLY THE IRANIAN 
REGIME HAS ALSO FAILED TO MEET 
OUR EXPECTATIONS IN ITS 
OPERATION OF ADVANCED CENTURY 
FUJS.
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS ALSO 
INTIMIDATED INSPECTORS TO NOT 
USING THE FULL INSPECTION 
AUTHORITIES THE AGREEMENT CALLS 
FOR.
IRANIAN OFFICIALS AND MILITARY 
LEADERS CLAIM THEY WON'T ALLOW 
INSPECT ORS ON TO MILITARY SITES
EVEN THOUGH THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY SUSPECTED SOME OF 
THOSE SITES WERE PART OF IRAN'S 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.
THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO 
BELIEVE THAT IRAN IS DEALING 
WITH NORTH KOREA.
I AM GOING TO INSTRUCT OUR 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO DO A 
THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND REPORT 
BACK THEIR FINDINGS BEYOND WHAT 
THEY HAVE ALREADY REVIEWED.
BY ITS OWN TERMS THE IRAN DEAL 
WAS SUPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
AND SECURITY.
YET, WHILE THE UNITED STATES 
ADHERES TO OUR COMMITMENT UNDER 
THE DEAL, THE IRANIAN REGIME 
CONTINUES TO FEEL CONFLICT, 
TERROR AND TURMOIL THROUGHOUT 
THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND.
IMPORTANTLY IRAN IS NOT LIVING 
UP TO THE SPIRIT OF THE DEAL.
SO TODAY IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
INCREASING MENACE POSED BY IRAN 
AND AFTER EXTENSIVE 
CONSULTATIONS WITH OUR ALLIES, I
AM ANNOUNCING A NEW STRATEGY TO 
ADDRESS THE FULL RANGE OF IRAN'S
DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS.
FIRST, WE WILL WORK WITH OUR 
ALLIES TO COUNTER THE REGIMES 
DID HE STABLE ICING ACTIVITY AND
SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST PROXIES IN
THE REGION.
SECOND, WE'LL PLACE ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONS ON THE REGIME TO BLOCK
THEIR FINANCING OF TERROR.
THIRD, WE'LL ADDRESS THE REGIMES
PROLIFERATION OF MISSILE AND 
WEAPONS THAT THREATEN ITS 
NEIGHBORS GLOBAL TRADE.
FINALLY, WE'LL DENY THE REGIME 
ALL PATHS TO A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
TODAY I'M ALSO ANNOUNCING 
SEVERAL MAJOR STEPS MY 
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKEN IN 
PURSUIT OF THE STRATEGY.
THE EXECUTION BEGINS WITH THE 
LONG OVERDUE STEP OF IMPOSING 
SUF SANCTIONS ON IRAN'S ISLAMIC 
GUARD CORP.
THAT'S THE IRANIAN'S SUPREME 
LEADER'S CORRUPT PERSONAL TERROR
FORCE AND MILITIA.
IT HAS HIJACK LARGE PORTIONS OF 
IRAN'S ECONOMY AND SEEKS 
RELIGIOUS EVEN DO YOUMENTS TO 
HAVE WAR AND TERROR ABROAD.
THIS INCLUDES SUPPLYING MISSILES
AND WEAPON TOSS ATTACK CIVILIANS
IN THE REGION AND EVEN PLOTTING 
TO BOMB A POPULAR RESTAURANT IN 
WASHINGTON D.C.
I'M AUTHORIZING THE TREASURY 
DEPARTMENT TO SANCTION THE 
ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 
CORP. FOR ITS SUPPORT OF 
TERRORISM.
I URGE OUR ALLIES TO JOIN US IN 
TAKING STRONG ACTIONS TO CURB 
IRAN'S CONTINUED DANGEROUS AND 
DESTABILIZING BEHAVIOR INCLUDING
THOROUGH SANCTIONS OUTSIDE THE 
IRAN DEAL THAT TARGET THE 
REGIME'S BALLISTIC MISSILE 
PROGRAM IN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM
AND ALL OF ITS DESTRUCTIVE 
ACTIVITIES OF WHICH THERE ARE 
MANY.
FINALLY, ON THE GRAVE MATTER OF 
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM SINCE THE
SIGNING OF THE NUCLEAR 
AGREEMENT, THE REGIME'S 
DANGEROUS AGGRESSION HAS ONLY 
ESCALATED.
AT THE SAME TIME IT HAS RECEIVED
MASSIVE SANCTIONS RELIEF WHILE 
CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ITS 
MISSILE PROGRAM.
IRAN HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO 
LUCRATIVE BUSINESS CONTRACTS 
WITH OTHER PARTIES THROUGH THE 
AGREEMENT.
WHEN THE AGREEMENT WAS FINALIZED
IN 2015, CONGRESS PASSED THE 
IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW 
ACT TO INSURE THAT CONGRESS' 
VOICE WOULD BE HEARD ON THE 
DEAL.
AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS THIS LAW 
REQUIRES THE PRESIDENT OR HIS 
DESIGNEE TO CERTIFY THAT THE 
SUSPENSION OF SANCTIONS UNDER 
THE DEAL IS APPROPRIATE AND 
PROPORTIONATE TO MEASURE AND 
OTHER MEASURES TAKEN BY IRAN TO 
TERM IT'S ELICIT NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM.
BASED ON THE FACTUAL RECORD I 
HAVE PUT FORWARD, I AM 
ANNOUNCING TODAY THAT WE CANNOT 
AND WILL NOT MAKE THIS 
CERTIFICATION.
WE WILL NOT CONTINUE DOWN A PATH
WHOSE PREDICTABLE CONCLUSION IS 
MORE VIOLENCE, MORE TERROR AND 
THE VERY REAL THREAT OF IRAN'S 
NUCLEAR BREAK OUT.
THAT IS WHY I AM DIRECTING MY 
ADMINISTRATION TO WORK CLOSELY 
WITH CONGRESS AND OUR ALLIES TO 
ADDRESS THE DEAL'S MANY SERIOUS 
FLAWS SO THAT THE IRANIAN REGIME
CAN NEVER THREATEN THE WORLD 
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THESE INCLUDE THE DEALS SUNSET 
CLAUSES THAT IN JUST A FEW YEARS
WILL ELIMINATE KEY RESTRICTIONS 
ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
THE FLAWS IN THE DEAL ALSO 
INCLUDE INSUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT
AND NEAR TOTAL SILENCE ON IRAN'S
MISSILE PROGRAMS.
CONGRESS HAS ALREADY BEGUN THE 
WORK TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS.
KEY HOUSE AND SENATE LEADERS ARE
DRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD 
AMEND THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT
REVIEW ACT TO STRENGTHEN 
ENFORCEMENT AND PREVENT IRAN 
FROM DEVELOPING AN INTERNET -- 
THIS IS SO TOTALLY IMPORTANT -- 
AN INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILE AND MAKE THIS PERMANENT 
UNDER U.S. LAW, SO IMPORTANT.
I SUPPORT THESE INITIATIVES.
HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT WE'RE NOT 
ABLE TO REACH A SOLUTION WORKING
WITH CONGRESS AND OUR ALLIES 
THEN THE AGREEMENT WILL BE 
TERMINATED.
IT'S UNDER CONTINUOUS REVIEW AND
OUR PARTICIPATION CAN BE 
CANCELED BY ME AS PRESIDENT AT 
ANY TIME.
AS WE HAVE SEEN IN NORTH KOREA 
THE LONGER WE IGNORE A THREAT, 
THE WORSE THAT THREAT BECOMES.
IT IS WHY WE ARE DETERMINED THAT
THE WORLD'S LEADING SPONSOR OF 
TERRORISM WILL NEVER OBTAIN 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
IN THIS EVENT WE STAND IN TOTAL 
SOLIDARITY WITH THE IRANIAN 
REGIME'S LONGEST SUFFERING 
VICTIMS, ITS OWN PEOPLE.
THE CITIZENS OF IRAN HAVE PAID A
HEAVY PRICE FOR THE VIOLENCE AND
EXTREMISM OF THEIR LEADERS.
THE IRANIAN PEOPLE -- THEY JUST 
ARE LONGING TO RECLAIM THEIR 
COUNTRY'S PROUD HISTORY, ITS 
CULTURE, IT'S CIVIL SAIGS, ITS 
COOPERATION WITH ITS NEIGHBORS.
WE HOPE THESE NEW MEASURES 
DIRECTED AT THE IRANIAN 
DICTATORSHIP WILL COMPEL THE 
GOVERNMENT RE-EVALUATE ITS 
PURSUIT OF TERROR AT THE EXPENSE
OF ITS PEOPLE.
WE HOPE OUR ACTIONS BRING ABOUT 
A FUTURE OF PEACE STABILITY AND 
PROSPERITY IN THE MIDDLE'S, A 
FUTURE WHERE SOLVE REN NATIONS 
RESPECT EACH OTHER.
WE PRAY FOR A FUTURE WHERE YOUNG
CHILDREN CAN GROW UP IN A WORLD 
FREE FROM VIOLENCE, HATRED AND 
TERROR.
UNTIL THAT BLESSED DAY COMES 
WE'LL DO WHAT WE MUST TO KEEP 
AMERICA SAVE.
THANK YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS, 
AMERICA.
THANK YOU. 
>> FIERCE WORDS FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FOR THE IRANIAN REGIME AND
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL CALLING IT A 
ROGUE REGIME, THE WORLD'S 
GREATEST SPONSOR OF TERROR.
SEE THE PRESIDENT WALK OUT OF 
THE DIPLOMATIC ROOM.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD 
DESERT FIE THAT NUCLEAR DEAL AND
IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN'S 
REVOLUTION NAR GUARD.
MARTHA YOU WERE IN IRAN WHEN 
THIS DEAL WAS REACHED.
IT DOESN'T APPEAR THE PRESIDENT 
WENT FAR TO LABEL THEM AS A 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
THAT IS WHAT THE IRANIAN REGIME 
IS LIKELY TO BE OPPOSED TO. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT GEORGE.
THE DESERT IF I INDICATION THEY 
WERE EXPECTING.
THEY'LL THINK THAT BREAK IT IS 
SPIRIT OF THE DEAL FROM THEIR 
EYES.
AS FOR THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION 
NAR GUARD WE GOT REACTION BEFORE
THIS SPEECH.
THEY READ ABOUT POSSIBLY WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS GOING TO SAY
TODAY.
THE FOREIGN MINISTER INDUSTRY 
SPOKESMAN SAID ANY MOVE AGAINST 
THE IRANIAN FORCES WILL LEAD TO 
AN EQUAL AND SEVERE REACTION BY 
THE ISLAMIC OF IRAN. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE REACHED
THIS CONCLUSION AFTER 
CONSULTATION OF THE AL PLIES BUT
THE ALLIES OPPOSED. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, GERM, 
RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE ALL UNITED.
THEY SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
WRONG AND IRAN IS ABIDING BY THE
DEAL.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ISOLATED THE 
UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO 
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.
THEY'LL GO FORWARD TRADING WITH 
IRAN.
THE LIKELIHOOD IF EVENTUALLY THE
UNITED STATES GETS OUT OF THIS 
DEAL PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD 
CONVINCE THESE ALLIES TO SLAP 
SANCTION BS ON IRAN IS VERY VERY
SLIM.
HE'S SET THE UNITED STATES 
AGAINST OUR CLOSEST ALLIES. 
>> I WANT TO GO TO CONGRESS, 
MARY BRUCE, THE PRESIDENT 
SENDING THIS TO CONGRESS TO SEE 
IF THEY'LL IMPOSE THESE NEW 
SANCTIONS.
NOT SOMETHING MOST IN CONGRESS 
WANT TO DEAL WITH NOW. 
>> EVEN REPUBLICANS WHO OPPOSED 
THIS DEAL DON'T WANT TO ATTACK 
IT NOW.
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THERE 
ARE PROPOSALS TO AMEND THE DEAL,
MAYBE PUT IN PLACE TOUGHER 
SANCTIONS.
THERE'S VERY LITTLE APPETITE ON 
CAPITOL HILL TO REIMPOSE THE 
NUCLEAR SANCTIONS.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IF 
CONGRESS CAN'T REACH AN 
AGREEMENT HE WILL TERMINATE THIS
DEAL, THIS AIDES TO CONGRESS' 
DAUNTING TO DO LIST.
THEY WANT TO TACKLE TAX REFORM 
AND PASS THE PROTECTIONS FOR 
DROOEMERS.
WE ADDED UP THE MAP HERE.
THE SENATE HAS 34 WORKING DAYS 
LEFT.
IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW IT WILL GET
DONE. 
>> LET'S GO BACK TO JON KARL.
CONGRESS DOESN'T WANT TO DEAL 
WITH IT.
THE ALLIES DON'T AGREE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT.
IRAN UNCLEAR WHAT IT WILL DO.
HARD TO KNOW IF IT GETS TO WHERE
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL HAVE TO
CANCEL THE DEAL. 
>> I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT EVEN
AS THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING 
TOUGH THINGS AROUND IRAN HE 
TALKED ABOUT FIXING THE FLAWS IN
THE DEAL.
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RIPPING IT 
OUT OR GETTING OUT OF IT.
HE STOPPED FAR SHORT OF WHAT HE 
SAID HE WOULD DO DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
>> THANKS SO MUCH.
ALL OF YOU WILL BE ON WORLD NEWS
TONIGHT WITH DAVID MUIR.
HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON.
