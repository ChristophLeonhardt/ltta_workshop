Getty Images has over 80 million photos in its massive database now to these 80 million things the official Getty Images Instagram chose to celebrate someone who is an executioner a Stalin sympathizer and someone who swore to kill millions of Americans the butcher of a la cabaña Che Guevara shocking Brown not really because it seems like if you're on the Left these horrific atrocities are merely misunderstood as long as you're a Marxist revolutionary and an anti-capitalist icon this is pure Hollywood the post was actually a birthday shout-out to this psychopathic murderer and had a praise and glowing caption to make sure their propaganda wasn't misunderstood the post said quote born 90 years ago today earnest che guevara expanded his horizons at a young age through travels in Latin America and elsewhere dedicating his life to liberating the poor and powerless he met along the way it's no wonder that to this day his iconic village the beard the burette cigar the intense gaze is emblazoned on protest posters on t-shirts and in the hearts of the would-be revolutionaries of every stripe and nationality in his time che was truly a man of the world and for those of you who know the history of Che Guevara doesn't that make your stomach turn that they're posting this but don't worry there's hope for these sheep that blindly follow these iconic people of culture that are promoting people like this because the post was taken down presumably after many Cubans who fled that horrific regime contacted them and said oh wait he murdered my entire family and just to put in perspective what che did in Cuba it would be equivalent to our population in America for one person to murder three million people but the person who was working at Getty Images you know where their heart was because they removed the photo and instead put one up of an immigrant child of the US border condemning the u.s. immigration policy regardless the almost 1 million followers that scrolled through their feet and saw this iconic images of Che Guevara and this praising headline will have a distorted perverted view of this revolutionary dirtbag at least for the time being but that's where the rebel comes in and that's why your boy took these screenshots but here's a few things you should know the next time you see some rapper celebrity donning the image of Che Guevara and what he represents in Shea's actual Journal he wrote quote the blank bad word for black people is indolent and lazy and spends all of his money on frivolities whereas the European is forward-looking organized and intelligent unquote seems a bit racist right don't tell that to jay-z and this is how stupid the left is - there was a statue of Che Guevara put in New York City and no one - faced it but was rather put there in celebration I guess they missed this little gem that che espoused about New York quote if the missiles had remained in Cuba we would have used them against every heart in the US including New York City the victory of socialism is well worth millions of atomic victims unquote the beloved che was also Fidel Castro's executioner and believe me he earned the nickname of the butcher of alla cabana here just a few gems in a speech he gave in 1966 he said quote hatred is an element of the struggle a relentless hatred of the enemy impelling us over and beyond the natural limitations that man is heir to and transforming him into an effective violent selective and cold killing machine to establish socialism rivers of blood must flow unquote it was reported that when che was the head of these execution camps in his first year alone he personally executed a thousand people another writing from his journal he said quote I ended the problem with a 32 caliber pistol right in the side of his brain a former guard and Shay's infamous death camp I like a banya the guard said quote several men who survived in a la cabaña prison recall at night when a 14-year old boy was shoved into their holding cell when asked what he did he gasped and said that he had tried to defend his father from the firing squad but was unsuccessful they watched out of their cell windows as well vara took out his pistol put the barrel to the back of the boy's neck and fired unquote sounds like a real stand-up guy right so then why is this guy praised well first of all I couldn't possibly be too established when the most bloody miserable countries on planet Earth where people are literally starving will leave their family and swim through shark-infested waters just to leave it maybe you only hear praise because it's the law according to the vaunted Journal for travel information among other things it's illegal to criticize the Castro regime or the Cuban Communist Party the only party allowed in Cuba so that's understandable but why in America is Che so praised and this idea that he represents the answer because of what he actually represents it's that same postmodern Marxist Romanticism at the left constantly pushes no matter how many innocent corpses that ideology stands on and the left just eats it up and that's acts part of the plan and don't just take my word for it this is from the actual words of Che Guevara in an entry in 1952 he said quote much more valuable than our rule recruits for our guerrilla force were American media recruits to export our propaganda it said that Castro Guevara cultivated and schmooze the foreign media that they made it their goal from day one they need to export their propaganda and make it not seem like propaganda idiots on the left and whoever the person is at Getty Images that posted this birthday celebration are these useful idiots that these Psychopaths play like a marionette adults who produce their propaganda and this is the same tactic used by other murder regimes like the Soviet Union and Mal China they all use propaganda to cover up the bodies and the corpses lying behind them and the left media always eats this up because they like some of the ideas and how they sound here's the thing this is the best they got strutting out economic countries like Venezuela until it goes completely under and this newfound affinity for monsters like Joseph Stalin and the godlike worship of someone like Che Guevara all they can say is ignore all these horrendous atrocities because they had some good sounding ideas or maybe their beliefs just weren't quite tried properly yet it frustrates me to no end that people will do this and then also not give the same birthday shout-out to amazing men and women who lived unbelievable and inspiring lives but who's now legacy is drug through the mud whose entire lives are being horribly characterized because of one statement or act take George Washington for instance a man so honorable and so great in his life that he inspired farmers and commoners to stand up against the greatest military power on the planet a man so selfless that he slept with his men on the field instead of being in his general quarters and when George Washington said he didn't want the power didn't want to be President and act so uncommon so unimaginable that his greatest enemy King George said that if he does that then he would be the greatest man in the world he did do that went back home and only by the begging of all the people who demanded that George would come back and be the first president to lead the freest most prosperous country ever form did he reluctantly take the mantle of being the first president a man who now protesters are trying to take down his image why would they do this because for a period in his life George Washington owned slaves and forget to mention that he was the only founding father to free every slave that he owned in 1799 almost 80 years before slavery was abolished and was done through the bloodiest war in American history yes slavery is a blot on the history of all mankind but Washington's life tells a much greater story than that period of time however for Che Guevara in the 1950s and 60s a lifetime of murders and terrors are forgiven for sake of the narrative of a revolutionary man of the people fighting against the imperial capitalists this propaganda is insane we all must try to look deeper than a cute birthday photo see the lies taken see the results of the person's actions see what comes of their beliefs implemented and speak up when garbage like this is just spewed into the public because we do not need another stalling or a butcher of a la cabaña we need more people who are willing to walk away from power like Washington so individuals can live in it I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive content and the entire rebel lineup you
