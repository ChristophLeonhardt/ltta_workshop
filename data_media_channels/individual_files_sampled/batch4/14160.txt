hey folks we've had race-based hiring quotas for years now aka affirmative action or employment equity well now get ready for race-based sentencing for select criminals does the name Terry Lynn McClintock ring a bell she's the monster who murdered eight year old Tori Stafford she was convicted of murder in the first degree in 2009 unfortunately we don't have the death penalty in Canada so we have to settle for murderers receiving a life sentence and the definition of life in Canada means 25 years so when you think about it a life sentence is really a quarter life sentence unless you get out early for good behavior in which case it's a one-fifth life sentence and speak of the devil Terry Lynn is getting out early not for good behavior mind you but because she's a native so it is that she's about to be transferred from a real prison to something called a healing Lodge in Saskatchewan a story in the London Free Press gushes that quote the lodge offers more independent living and nicer quarters including family units where children can live with offenders then a prison as well as spiritual and cultural training end quote Correctional Service Canada would not disclose McLintock location citing the Federal Privacy Act because that's how we roll in 2018 in Canada folks the privacy of murderers and even terrorists outweigh the lives of innocent children oh and Terry Lynn fully intends to make use of her so-called Rights Correctional Service Canada's website for the okema okie Lodge reads like a travel brochure the lodge quote contains both single and family residential units as offenders may have their children stay with them each unit has a bedroom a bathroom a kitchenette with an eating area and a living room end quote G is this an incarceration facility or a franchise operating under the banner of Motel six Tori's father Rodney Stafford has asked in a series of Facebook messages with the London Free Press the following quote how do people such as Terry Lynn McLintock get more rights and privileges and lessen security end quote sorry mr. Safford for that is known as a bit of a dumb question because the answer is simply this when it comes to crime to paraphrase of the ad slogan embraced by American Express minority status has its privileges Rodney is organizing a protest on Parliament Hill on November 2nd I really do wish him well and I'm sure you'll get a private audience with the prime minister just like the wife-beating islamist joshua boyle got a private audience with justin yeah and the Ottawa Senators are gonna win the Stanley Cup this year but welcome to an odious new trend in justice in Canada these days race-based sentencing and it's spreading here's another whopper for you earlier this year a Globe and Mail article noted how lawyers for a black man caught carrying a loaded handgun asked a judge to declare that black Canadians should receive special consideration in sentencing just as natives do losers Faizal Mirza and Emily Lam who were representing Jamel Jackson 33 says blacks like indigenous people have faced quote dislocation segregation disproportionate rates of incarceration and discrimination in employment and education plus over policing of neighborhoods and mistreatment in federal custody end quote translation if you are black one should be entitled to a get-out-of-jail-free card because you committed a crime due to root causes so much for personal responsibility and the will of the individual I suppose and what's next special sentencing requirements for Muslims perhaps due to systemic Islamophobia in Canada special sentencing for any group is a despicable trend that's actually racist because it subscribes to the racism of lowered expectations and you know so much for that iconic image of Lady Justice holding a set of scales in one hand and a sword in the other meanwhile her eyes are blindfolded with a veil because in Canada and 2018 Lady Justice has traded in her sword for a pacifier and that blindfold she's now donning a pair of x-ray glasses for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
