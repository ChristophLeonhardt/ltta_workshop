Israel is being slammed for how its military is handling ongoing protests at the Gaza border the so-called march of return has already left 17 killed and more than a thousand injured that's according to the Palestinian health ministry the fact that people demonstrating in a march towards defense were actually killed by soldiers is alarming the annual march of return is a demonstration denouncing Israeli occupation thousands of Palestinians have pitched tents across five locations where they're expected to stay for the coming weeks world leaders have condemned Israeli actions against the protesters and were blamed for applying double standards by the Israeli prime minister Arty's Daniel Hawking's explains this isn't the first incident of mass Palestinian casualties in clashes with the IDF tragically it won't be the last the border violence had barely stopped before the criticism of Israel's actions came thick and fast from all directions the UN secretary-general was quick to call for a full investigation he used foreign affairs chief wasn't far behind Israel though is having none of it the Army was doing its job if anything the soldiers that fired live bullets into the crowd deserve a medal according to the country's defense minister an investigation no chance they ignore the murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the Middle East but when Israel neutralizes 16 terrorists they can VIN an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council the IDF will not cooperate with an investigative committee let them investigate the murders of half a million people in Syria tens of thousands and Libya Sudan and Yemen no punches polls and some may say he does have a point multiple EU states have taken part in NATO or us-led interventions in Libya and Syria which have contributed to civilian losses and of course they also continue to arm Saudi Arabia that's despite the catastrophic situation in Yemen but some world leaders return the focus to Friday's brutal violence on the Gaza border with president Aaron branding it an inhumane attack and Prime Minister Netanyahu didn't let this go unanswered the most moral army in the world will not be lectured by those who had indiscriminately bombed civilian populations for years apparently this is how April Fool's Day celebrated an anchor on a thinly veiled reference to Turkey's tough line and Kurdish groups who Ankara labeled terrorists or perhaps the turkeys ongoing military operations in northern Syria triggering a further response from the Turkish president hey Netanyahu you're an occupier and it is as an occupier that you are on those lands at the same time you are a terrorist an EU itself wasn't exempt from the Turkish president's rhetoric don't throw stones from a glass house one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter is an older dodge but today it seems human life has become less valuable than political expediency or a good soundbite author max Blumenthal says it looks like Netanyahu and erdowan are blaming each other for basically the same things I'm slightly amused by the denunciations exchanged by between Benjamin Netanyahu and the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan that both are accusing one another of massive human rights crimes and both are correct that one another has committed gigantic human rights crimes Netanyahu and Gaza and against the Palestinian people in general and ern√µ on now enough Green in Syria I compared this spat between Netanyahu and her dhawan to the 2004 film alien versus Predator where two monsters battle one another to the death and you know in real life as I mentioned Netanyahu and erdowan are cooperating below the surface neither man can claim the moral high ground so both are basically bought battling from the moral depths of depravity
