the arrest of the woman driving activists took everybody by surprise every single newspaper is covering it and so dearly we did not need that this in fact reveal the true faith of the Saudi patriarchal totalitarian regime where rights are granted by royal decrees not when it's demanded by activists and it doesn't match the rhetoric that Saudi Arabia is reforming country because it's arresting human rights activists left and right even the PR machine of the kingdom is having difficult time defending such a decision the question for the Saudi authorities is why do this now of all times why just as the global media were busily churning out good news stories of Saudi women preparing to take the wheel in the last country on the planet which had banned them from driving was the government choose this particular moment to arrest seven activists five women and two men accusing them of colluding with unspecified foreign powers to destabilize the kingdom the truth is those activists have been under the gun ever since last September when the crown prince's father King Salman announced the ban was coming to an end I was not surprised about the news of the arrest knowing that last year when the Kingdom announced lifting the pan the same day ironically they called women's rights activists and they asked them to remain silent a resulting of many women's rights activists being condemned into silence deactivating their Twitter account or stopping tweeting the activists have been depicted by media as traitors Al Abdullah savatya Chausson Camus beat Owosso lillahi Margie Hatton karajia they were accused of forming a cell trying to stabilize the country unfortunately this is not the first instance where human rights activists and any for political dissent is linked to a national security threat we have seen cases where people arrested simply for tweeting criticisms of Saudi Arabia policy and of course this plays a huge role in stifling any form of human rights activism dissent and any form of freedom of expression Association assembly in the country those women should have been celebrated next months when women are allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia they should have been given a credit for their work they are the one who keep the issue alive someone in Riyadh need to check and see how this decision was made and fixing the narrative now emerging around the Saudi story seems to be at odds with the one that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman managed to create after becoming the presumptive heir to the throne last year what the government in Riyadh called an anti-corruption crackdown got good reviews in the Western media despite legitimate questions that were being asked such as was MBS using the anti-graft effort as a smokescreen justification for locking up his rivals within the royal family between some ingratiating editorials and paper's like the New York Times and a softball interview conducted by CBS's 60 minutes program MBS attracted the kind of positive news coverage that his rhetoric may have merited if not for his actual record known by his initials MBS his reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary the nature of that interview was almost fawning they were you know talking about his great work ethic working hard they never really pushed too hard on issues like human rights abuses and the war in Yemen is this really an open and free society well they mentioned this crackdown on corruption they didn't trust how Mohammed did Salman got his money how would I feel fear my personal life is something I'd like to keep to myself Mohammed bin Salman is about now the world's most expensive painting of the most expensive home yet he calls everybody else correct and interviews like the 60 Minutes one failed to really hit on that another instance is Thomas Friedman's column where they said Saudi Arabia's Arab Spring at last you know when the Arab Spring is ground up the movement meanwhile this top-down reform while stifling these kinds of collectives and stifling the formation of NGOs and human rights groups there is little to no mention or connection between that and the right to freedom of expression Association and assembly this is really where the covering on Saudi Arabia completely fell short although it's impossible to really gauge credit if one can call it that for Saudi Arabia's sometimes successful spinning of its own story particularly in the u.s. may well lie with the multiple public relations firms it has at its disposal there under American law PR and lobby groups are required to disclose their foreign clients at least three Washington based PR firms work on the Saudis behalf BGR Squire Patton Boggs and Hogan Lovells and that's just the PR side the Saudis have also set up their own lobby group also based in DC there has been an investment on branding Hamad bin Salman image in the US and this has been taking place through different tools and methods one the regime set up a lobby called Zurich this Lobby the Saudi American relationship committee worked intensively to promote Mohammed bin Salman image in the u.s. also his brother Prince Khalid was appointed as the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Washington we want to empower our youth including women and he is a regular guest in American news TVs when the Gulf crisis began last year that's when we really saw a lot more money being spent both on lobbyists and on PR firms the goal of all this has been to create this image of a modernizing liberalizing Kingdom it's hard to discern what the intention of that PR trip is what the American public thinks doesn't really have any grounding on what our governments relationship with Saudi Arabia does at the end of the day though the sounds have with money that they're willing to spend on PR efforts it doesn't really seem to bother them if the country wants to have a good image but to depend only on PR companies and promises this is short-lived the arrest of those women activists is a proof of that the moment the news came out all that image is gone and now everybody is talking about again a rest lack of political freedom in Saudi Arabia so basically what will fix the image of Saudi Arabia is action on the ground back to the question asked at the outset why now there's really no clear answer to the PR led charm offensive and the NBS interviews were targeted at the international media and foreign politicians the arrest of the activists and the discourse chilling message that that sent were designed primarily for domestic consumption if that created a few unflattering headlines in the global media then so be it the image that the crown prince project is at home power above all else is the priority that's always been the way in the House of Saud and for all the talk of reform and a generational changing of the guard in Riyadh it hasn't changed
