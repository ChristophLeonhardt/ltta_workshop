>> WELL, SANDRA, ALL OF THIS
HINGES ON WHEN EXACTLY THE
SENATE MAJORITY LEADERS -- IF
HE DOES IT TODAY, THAT MEANS
THAT THE EARLIEST WE COULD GET
A VOTE ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD
BE FRIDAY.
THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS
THAT MCCONNELL WOULD FILE
CLOTURE TOMORROW TO PUT THE
VOTE SATURDAY.
THE FATE OF KAVANAUGH CONTINUES
TO HINGE ON THE THREE CRITICAL
REPUBLICAN SENATORS, FLAKE,
MURCOWSKI AND COLLINS AND --
>> Sandra: WHEN COULD THIS ALL
COME BACK TO CAPITOL HILL?
>> WE'RE HEARING THAT THIS
F.B.I. INVESTIGATION COULD
RETURN TO CAPITOL HILL AS EARLY
AS TODAY.
IT WOULD BE A VERY FAST
TIMELINE BUT WE'RE HEARING THAT
IT COULD HAPPEN.
THESE F.B.I. AGENTS HAVE BEEN
WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO TRY
TO MEET THE DEADLINES.
DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL HILL KEEP
CONTINUING TO TRY TO EXPAND THE
SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION.
>> I BELIEVE NOTHING ABOUT THIS
INVESTIGATION UNTIL I ACTUALLY
SEE THAT THE F.B.I. IS TALKING
TO THOSE 25 WITNESSES ON THE
LIST I COMPILED.
EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THIS
INVESTIGATION MEANS WE'RE GOING
FROM 4 TO 6 WITNESSES.
THAT AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.
>> REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAY THAT
NO AMOUNT OF WITNESSES WILL
EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR
DEMOCRATS.
>> IF YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO
CHANGE THE MIND OF A SINGLE
DEMOCRAT, LIKE I SAY, PUT DOWN
THE BONG, MAN, PUT DOWN THE
BONG.
