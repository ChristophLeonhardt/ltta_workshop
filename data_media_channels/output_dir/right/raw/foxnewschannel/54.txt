1
00:00:01,725 --> 00:00:02,058
CARAVAN.

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:02,892
NOW THE PRESIDENT.

3
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:04,427
>> WE MAY AS BEING DISCUSSED

4
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,494
RIGHT NOW.

5
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:07,096
MIKE BOLTON AS YOU KNOW IS

6
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:08,497
IN RUSSIA, TALKING ABOUT

7
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:09,398
VARIOUS THINGS, INCLUDING

8
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:13,469
THE WHOLE NUCLEAR SITUATION

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,637
WHERE WE WERE NOT TREATED

10
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:15,671
WELL FOR MANY YEARS.

11
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:16,772
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A

12
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:17,506
LONG TIME AGO.

13
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:19,742
AND I THINK SOMETHING GOOD

14
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:21,444
COULD COME OUT OF THAT I

15
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:22,812
VERY WELL MEET WITH -- I

16
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:23,779
THINK WE PROBABLY WILL.

17
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,947
IT HASN'T BEEN SET UP YET

18
00:00:24,948 --> 00:00:25,981
BUT IT PROBABLY WILL BE.

19
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,384
>> IF YOU COULD JUST SETTLE

20
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:31,320
SOME OF THE CONFUSION OVER

21
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,889
YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT

22
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,091
WHAT YOU MEAN YOU ARE A

23
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:35,491
NATIONALIST?

24
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,059
>> I LOVE OUR COUNTRY.

25
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,897
OUR COUNTRY HAS TAKEN SECOND

26
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:42,231
FIDDLE.

27
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:44,133
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRADE

28
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:44,433
DEALS.

29
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:47,369
I AM KNOCKING OUT SOME OF

30
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,039
THE WORSE DEALS I HAVE EVER

31
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,339
SEEN.

32
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,841
WE GIVE THEM OUR WEALTH AND

33
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:52,875
THEY DON'T TREAT US

34
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:53,242
PROPERLY.

35
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,310
WE ARE PROTECTING VERY, VERY

36
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:55,811
RICH COUNTRIES, INCLUDING,

37
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,847
BY THE WAY, A COUNTRY THAT

38
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:58,881
HAPPENS TO BE VERY MUCH IN

39
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:00,916
THE NEWS, SAUDI ARABIA.

40
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:02,818
AND MENTALLY WEALTHY.

41
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:03,986
AND WE ARE TAKING CARE OF

42
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:04,720
THEIR MILITARY FOR A

43
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,788
FRACTION OF THE COST, NOT

44
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:09,558
FAIR TO US OTHER COUNTRIES

45
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:09,992
ALSO.

46
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:11,193
IMMENSELY WEALTHY.

47
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:11,560
COUNTRIES.

48
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:12,995
AND WE HAVE TO GET

49
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:13,863
REIMBURSED FOR THAT WE

50
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,564
SHOULD NOT BE THE WORLD'S

51
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:19,401
POLICE KEEPER AND NOT GET

52
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:19,802
REIMBURSED.

53
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:20,803
BY THE WAY, WHEN I BRING UP

54
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:22,171
TO THE HEADS OF COUNTRIES

55
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,839
LIKE JAPAN, PRIME MINISTER

56
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,141
ABE, A FRIEND OF MINE, I

57
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:27,777
BRING IT UP, HE LOOKS AT ME.

58
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:29,278
AND HE GOES I UNDERSTAND.

59
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,913
THEY UNDERSTAND IT NOBODY

60
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:32,348
HAS EVER ASKED THEM.

61
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:33,983
THEY SAID HAVE YOU EVER

62
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,951
ASKED I SAID HAVE YOU EVER

63
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:37,353
BEEN ASKED LIKE YOU HAVE TO

64
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:39,321
BE LIKE HELP OUT?

65
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,557
NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED.

66
00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:43,325
SO, THAT'S A PRETTY UNFAIR

67
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:43,692
THING.

68
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:45,294
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU.

69
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:46,195
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

70
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,029
WAIT.

71
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,298
I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO

72
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:49,565
YOU.

73
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:51,200
>> CAN I ASK MY FOLLOW UP

74
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:51,567
QUESTION?

75
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:52,434
>> NO, NOT NOW.

76
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,736
I WILL GET BACK TO YOU I

77
00:01:53,737 --> 00:01:54,069
SAID.

78
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,237
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE WHOLE

79
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:55,538
THING.

80
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,739
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER

81
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,506
FINE REPORTERS.

82
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:58,340
GO AHEAD, YES.

83
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,176
I'M BEHIND YOU, PLEASE.

84
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,610
>> MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE YOU

85
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:03,279
HEARD BACK OR FIRST OF ALL,

86
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,181
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU

87
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:06,749
THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TURKISH

88
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,516
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY.

89
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,985
>> WHAT PRESIDENT ERDOGAN

90
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:10,285
SAID?

91
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:10,719
>> YES, SIR.

92
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,321
>> HE WAS PRETTY ROUGH ON

93
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:13,556
SAUDI ARABIA, I WOULD SAY.

94
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,057
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A FULL

95
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,225
RECAP AS YOU KNOW I HAVE

96
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,326
PEOPLE IN TUCKERY, AND I

97
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:18,594
HAVE PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA

98
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,662
AND OTHER PLACES.

99
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,230
AND THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK

100
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,798
AS WE SPEAK, THEY ARE

101
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:23,499
HEADING BACK.

102
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,601
I WILL KNOW, I THINK,

103
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:26,669
EVERYTHING IN A VERY SHORT

104
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,503
PERIOD OF TIME.

105
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:28,604
IT'S A BAD SITUATION.

106
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,206
ENED BUT, CERTAINLY

107
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:32,608
PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WAS NOT

108
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:33,709
COMPLIMENTARY OF WHAT

109
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,076
HAPPENED.

110
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:34,910
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING

111
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,212
THAT HAPPENED.

112
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:36,512
OKAY?

113
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:37,346
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD.

114
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:40,616
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK DO YOU

115
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:43,052
BELIEVE HIM, DO YOU BELIEVE

116
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:43,886
THE SAUDI ARABIAEN

117
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:44,286
LEADERSHIP.

118
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,655
>> I WANT TO SEAT FACTS

119
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,122
FIRST.

120
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,757
SAAB HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT

121
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:49,058
ALLY.

122
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:49,825
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

123
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:51,026
INVESTORS, MAYBE THE BIGGEST

124
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,194
INVESTOR IN OUR COUNTRY.

125
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:53,796
THEY ARE DOING HUNDREDS OF

126
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:56,999
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF

127
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,467
INVESTMENTS AND, YOU KNOW,

128
00:02:58,468 --> 00:02:59,602
SO MANY JOBS.

129
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:03,105
SOME JOBS.

130
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:04,707
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

131
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,007
JOBS.

132
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,642
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER

133
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,344
SIDE, IRAN, YOU LOOK AT WHAT

134
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,845
THEY HAVE DONE TO PEOPLE,

135
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:10,646
VICIOUS, HORRIBLE, AND

136
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,514
THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT

137
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:13,549
HAPPENED WITH SAUDI ARABIA.

138
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,717
NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER.

139
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:16,051
BUT YOU TAKE A LOOK, IT'S A

140
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,253
ROUGH PART OF THE WORLD.

141
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:18,520
IT'S A NASTY PLACE.

142
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,788
IT'S A NASTY PART OF THE

143
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:22,458
WORLD.

144
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,193
BUT, IF WHAT HAPPENED

145
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:26,795
HAPPENED, AND IF THE FACTS

146
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,063
CHECK OUT, THEN IT'S

147
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:31,166
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY BAD.

148
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,001
TWAMENT, THEY HAVE BEEN A

149
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,703
VERY GOOD ALLY OF OURS.

150
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:35,604
THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING US A

151
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:36,939
LOT WITH RESPECT TO ISRAEL.

152
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,040
THEY HAVE BEEN FUNDING A LOT

153
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:41,143
OF THINGS.

154
00:03:41,144 --> 00:03:43,712
I WILL TELL THAT YOU RUSSIA

155
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,381
AND CHINA WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

156
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:47,116
THAT MILITARY ORDER.

157
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:48,484
AND CAN I SAY IT TO MY

158
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:49,618
DEMOCRAT FRIENDS, TOO.

159
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,922
THEY WOULD LOVE THIS IS

160
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,623
$110 BILLION WORTH OF

161
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:54,990
MILITARY.

162
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:55,991
AND RUSSIA WOULD PICK THAT

163
00:03:55,992 --> 00:03:57,526
UP VERY QUICKLY AND CHINA

164
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:58,994
WOULD PICK IT UP VERY

165
00:03:58,995 --> 00:04:00,029
QUICKLY AND FRANCE WOULD

166
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,530
PICK IT UP VERY QUICKLY.

167
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:02,564
FRANCE MAKES A LOT OF

168
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:03,565
MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

169
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:06,435
VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET.

170
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:07,002
GREAT JOB.

171
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,404
THAT'S WHY I WENT TO SAUDI

172
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:08,871
ARABIA FIRST.

173
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:11,807
I WENT TO SAUDI ARABIA ON

174
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,075
THE BASIS THAT THEY WOULD

175
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,177
BUY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS,

176
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:16,278
MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

177
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,079
WORTH OF THINGS.

178
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,215
AND THE ULTIMATE NUMBER IS

179
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,851
AROUND $450 BILLION.

180
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:28,324
110 FOR MILITARY.

181
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:28,757
450 BILLION.

182
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:30,726
OVER A MILLION JOBS.

183
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,161
SO, WE DO THAT THE, WE ARE

184
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:33,696
JUST HURTING OURSELVES.

185
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:34,930
WE ARE JUST HURTING

186
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,297
OURSELVES.

187
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:37,099
I KNOW THAT FROM A CERTAIN

188
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,900
STANDPOINT, YOU CAN ALSO

189
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:42,137
SAY, WELL, IT DOESN'T

190
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:42,471
MATTER.

191
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:43,672
IT IS A TERRIBLE THING.

192
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,374
WE WOULD BE REALLY HURTING

193
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:45,741
OURSELVES.

194
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:47,443
WE WOULD BE HURTING OUR

195
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:47,810
COMPANIES.

196
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,011
WE WOULD BE HURTING OUR

197
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:49,311
JOBS.

198
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:50,980
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

199
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:53,582
I SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY

200
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,616
GOOD -- COUPLE OF SECONDS.

201
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,318
I SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD

202
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:56,885
REPORT VERY SOON.

203
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,554
>> JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR

204
00:04:58,555 --> 00:04:59,922
COMMENTS ABOUT BEING A

205
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:00,322
NATIONALIST.

206
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:01,190
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT YOU

207
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,192
ARE SENDING CODED LANGUAGES

208
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:04,827
WAGE OR A DOG WHISTLE TO

209
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:05,661
SOME AMERICANS OUT THERE

210
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:07,062
THAT WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN IS

211
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:08,397
THAT YOU ARE A WHITE

212
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:08,797
NATIONALIST.

213
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:09,698
>> I HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD

214
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,533
THAT I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT.

215
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:12,501
I'M A NATIONALIST.

216
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,036
NO, I NEVER HEARD THAT

217
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:15,537
THEORY ABOUT BEING A

218
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:15,938
NATIONALIST.

219
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:16,805
I HAVE HEARD THEM ALL.

220
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,207
I'M SOMEBODY THAT LOVES OUR

221
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:18,540
COUNTRY.

222
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,209
WHEN I SAY A NATIONALIST.

223
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,678
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN GERMANY

224
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:27,049
IS PAYING 1% OF G.D.P. FOR

225
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,451
NATO AND WE ARE PAYING 4.3%.

226
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:30,252
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

227
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,186
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

228
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:33,355
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN AS AN

229
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:36,558
EXAMPLE WE'RE PROTECTING

230
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,193
EUROPE AND WE ARE PAYING FOR

231
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,929
ALMOST THE ENTIRE COST OF

232
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,830
NATO.

233
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:44,166
VERY SUBSTANTIAL PORTION.

234
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,000
FAR GREATER THAN WHAT IT

235
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:45,501
SHOULD BE.

236
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,069
WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR

237
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,903
THIS COUNTRIES.

238
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,071
ON TOP OF THAT I DON'T LIKE

239
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:50,773
IT WHEN THEY PUT UP BARRIERS

240
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:53,442
TO OUR FARMERS, WHERE OUR

241
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:56,545
FARMER CANNOT SALE.

242
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,147
TRADE BARRIERS, BETTER THAN

243
00:05:58,148 --> 00:05:58,480
ANYBODY.

244
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:00,582
TRADE BARRIERS THAT ARE AS

245
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,918
SEVERE AS CHINA'S TRADE

246
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:03,786
BARRIERS, WHICH ARE COMING

247
00:06:03,787 --> 00:06:04,086
DOWN.

248
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,087
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL

249
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:05,821
VERY BADLY.

250
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:08,924
THEY WILL BE COMING DOWN.

251
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:10,459
BUT I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR

252
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,793
COUNTRY.

253
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:12,094
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW

254
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:14,229
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR

255
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,664
COUNTRY TO CONTINUE.

256
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:16,732
WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

257
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:17,299
I'M PROUD.

258
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,201
I'M PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY.

259
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:20,769
>> AND I AM A NATIONALIST.

260
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,970
IT'S A WORD THAT HASN'T BEEN

261
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:23,038
USED TOO MUCH.

262
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,573
PEOPLE USE IT.

263
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,607
BUT I'M VERY PROUD.

264
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,009
I THINK IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT

265
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:27,309
BACK.

266
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,310
I'M SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO

267
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,845
HELP OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE

268
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:30,479
WORLD.

269
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,181
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO TAKE CARE

270
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,348
OF OUR COUNTRY.

271
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,984
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW

272
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:37,419
OURSELVES TO BE DUPED ON

273
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,822
MILITARY AND ALSO DUPED ON

274
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:40,122
TRADE.

275
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:41,390
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AS

276
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,992
AN EXAMPLE.

277
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:46,829
LAST YEAR ON TRADE,

278
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,997
$151 BILLION ON TOP OF THAT.

279
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,266
WE LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

280
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:55,037
OF DOLLARS ON PROTECTION SO

281
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,106
WE PROTECT AND WE GET

282
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:57,439
KILLED.

283
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,341
WE DO THE TRADING AND GET

284
00:06:59,342 --> 00:06:59,808
KILLED.

285
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,242
CAN'T DO IT.

286
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:01,343
I WANT IT TO BE FAIR.

287
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:03,679
SO I WANT THEM TO OPEN THEIR

288
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,012
BORDERS.

289
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:10,686
I WANT THEM TO MAKE IT FAIR

290
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:10,953
FOR.

291
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:11,820
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND

292
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:12,521
PRESCRIPTIONS ON YEAR AND A

293
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:14,123
HALF AGO.

294
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:15,057
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CAN'T GET

295
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:15,657
INTO EUROPE.

296
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:16,825
EVEN THOUGH IT'S BETTER THAN

297
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:17,659
WHAT THEY HAVE.

298
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,695
SO THEY HAVE TO TREAT US --

299
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,196
ALL I WANT OUR COUNTRY IS TO

300
00:07:21,197 --> 00:07:22,798
BE TREATED WELL TO BE

301
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,299
TREATED WITH RESPECT.

302
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,901
FOR MANY YEARS, OTHER

303
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:29,271
COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALLIES OF

304
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:29,571
OURS.

305
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:30,205
ALL OF US.

306
00:07:30,206 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE NOT TREATED OUR
