HAPPENS STARTING WITH WHERE IT
ALL JUST HAPPENED, GREG?
WOW.
>>  HEY, NEIL WOW INDEED AND AN
INSTANT SUMMIT A SATURDAY
SURPRISE INVOLVING SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT MOON AND NORTH KOREAN
LEADER KIM JONG-UN.
NOW THEY HAD MET JUST A MONTH
AGO ALONG THE DMZ, THIS TIME ON
THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE NO WARNING
UNANNOUNCED AS YOU NOTED ABOUT
TWO HOURS AND WE'LL GET A FULL
READ-OUT ON SUNDAY ABOUT WHAT
WAS DISCUSSED BUT ACCORDING TO
MOON' OFFICE IN ADDITION TO
INTER-KOREAN ISSUES AND THIS IS
THE REAL IMPORTANT THING FOR US,
NEIL THERE WAS A FRANK, CANDID
EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ABOUT HOW TO
ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT
BEING PLANNED BETWEEN PRESIDENT
TRUMP AND NORTH KOREAN LEADER
KIM.
REMEMBER THAT SUMMIT WAS
BASICALLY CANCELED THURSDAY, BY
THE WHITE HOUSE FOLLOWING A
NASTY MESSAGE FROM THE NORTH AND
THEN BASICALLY REVIVED ON FRIDAY
FOLLOWING A NICE MESSAGE FROM
THE NORTH.
TODAY'S MEETING IS SEEN BY
EXPERTS HERE AS THE CLEAREST
SIGNAL YET THAT A JUNE 12
SINGAPORE SESSION WOULD BE BACK
ON THIS AMID ALSO REPORTS
WE'RE GETTING THAT ON BOTH SIDES
ARE HEADING NOW TOWARDS
SINGAPORE.
REMEMBER SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
MOON MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON
TUESDAY TO ADVICE HIM.
THERE IS SOME TALK HERE THAT HE
WAS CARRYING A MESSAGE FROM
TRUMP TO KIM BUT MORE
IMPORTANTLY, IT'S SEEN THAT MOON
HAS BECOME A REAL IMPORTANT GO
BETWEEN ON ALL OF THIS COULD BE
SEEN TODAY AS POSSIBLY TRYING TO
FURTHER GET SOME KIND OF A
COMMITMENT FROM KIM JONG-UN
REGARDING DENUCLEARIZATION AND
REMEMBER, IT HAS BEEN A CRAZY
WEEK, NEIL.
JUST THURSDAY WE SAW WHAT THE
NORTH CLAIMED WAS A DISMANTLE
MENT OF ITS ONE KNOWN
NUCLEAR TEST SITE IN THE
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
AND THAT WAS SEEN AS A GOODWILL
GESTURE BUT THERE WERE NO
EXPERTS NO ANALYSTS THERE NO
REAL CONFIRMATION OF THE CLAIMS.
TODAY THOUGH REAL CONFIRMATION,
NEIL.
A MEETING BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES
AND THEY DO LOOK QUITE LOVEY DOV
EY, WITH HANDSHAKES,
SMILES AND HUGS AND LET'S SEE IF
THE LOVE FEST TURNS INTO
