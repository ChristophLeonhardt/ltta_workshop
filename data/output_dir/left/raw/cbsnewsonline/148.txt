48
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:08,535
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT 

49
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:08,868

52
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,240

FOOT ON AMERICAN SOIL, AND THEY 

57
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,648

63
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,189
WITHOUT SEEING AND DOCTORS 

64
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:30,656
JUDGE AS A RESULT OF 

65
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:33,093
PROCEDURES AND CURRENT LAW, 

66
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,527

68
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,697
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE A 

69
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,464
JUDGE DOESN'T MEAN I 

70
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:41,301
DON'T AREN'T RECEIVING DUE 

71
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,001

72
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,568
THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON

80
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,979
SO NO OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM 

81
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,013
ASYLUM, IN OPPORTUNITY TO 

82
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,381

>> NO. 

85
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,683
LIKE I SAID, JUST BECAUSE YOU 

86
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:58,584
DON'T SEE A JUDGE 

87
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:00,086

RECEIVING DUE PROCESS. 

89
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:01,621
ALSO THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE 

90
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,889

WE'D LIKE TO HAVE SECURE

THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES THAT 

96

97
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,968
THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO

102
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:20,606
WAY.

BORDER CROSSING AND SENT BACK. 

115
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:39,859
DOES THE PRESIDENT WANT TO

00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,562
UMPPLEMENT THAT TYPE OF 

117
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,764
POLICY FOR PEOPLE FROM 

118
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:45,264
NONCONTIGUOUS COUNTRYS? 

119
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,700

131
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:11,757
HE WANTS TO STOP THAT. 

132

THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO. 

136
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:16,863
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,781
LIKE TO SEE, AND 

150
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,182

00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:32,939
ADMINISTRATION'S STANCE ON 

191
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,139
THIS? 

192
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,240
>> AGAIN, AS THE SECRETARY 

193
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,174
SAID, A STATEMENT WOULD 

194
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,442
GO OUT THAT TARGETS ALL 

195
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,877
COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO 

196
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:45,218
STEAL OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND WE 

197
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:50,556
EXPECT THAT TO BE OUT 

198
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:56,062
SOON. 

199
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,680
ANYONE THAT GOES TO A PORT OF 

200
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,516
ENTRY SEEKING ASYLUM WILL NOT 

201
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,518
BE PROSECUTE AND WE WOULD 

202
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,685
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE 

203
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,888
CORRECT SYSTEM AND NOT TRY TO 

204
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,655
BREAK THE LAW. 

205
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,890
>> Reporter: FOLLOWING UP ON

00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:31,097
THEIR OPERATIONS TO EUROPE 

210
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,699
BECAUSE OF THE EU TARIFFS THAT 

211
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,602
WERE PLACED ON THE HARLEY 

212
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,135
DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLES. 

213
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:38,971
IS THIS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 

214
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,673
ENVISIONED FOR WHAT THE IMPACT 

215
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,110
WOULD BE BY PLACING TARIFFS ON 

216
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,349
THE EU AND RETALIATION? 

217
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,484
>> AGAIN THE EU IS TRYING TO 

218
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,385
PUNISH U.S. WORKERS BECAUSE 

219
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,187
THEY HAVE ENGAGED REPEATEDLY IN 

220
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,021
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AND THE

00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,089
PRESIDENT IS SAYING ENOUGH IS 

222
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:57,322

WE'D LINING TO WORK WITH THE EU 

224
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:04,797
TO WORK ON A LEVEL PLAYING 

225
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,030

226
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,798
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT

232
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:15,541
ANY SPECIFICS. 

233
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,413
THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF 

234
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,683
DIPLOMACY GOING ON WITH JARED 

235
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,116
KUSHNER AND JASON. 

236
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,318
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING CONCRETE 

237
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,386

00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,020
POSITIVE MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER 

239
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,254
FROM ALL OF THERE? 

240
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,155

WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THOSE 

253
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,244

254
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:53,880

OF CUSTOMS SAID TODAY THEY 

259
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,089
WOULD NO LONGER BE REFERRING

FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES IF THEY 

261
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,324
ARE TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN, 

262
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,692
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY RETURNED 

263
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,794
TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

PRACTICE AND ADMINISTRATIONS 

265
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,230
BEFORE THAT. 

266
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,498
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT THAT 

267
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:12,999
APPROACH. 

268
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,234
>> AND IF SO, DOES HE REGRET

ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH IN THE

FIRST PLACE? 

272
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:21,774
>> THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 

273
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,108
SUPPORTS KEEPING FAMILIES 

274
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:24,410
TOGETHER, WHICH HE HAS OUTLINED 

275
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,278
OVER THE LAST WEEK. 

276
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,880
BUT HE HAS CALLED ON CONGRESS 

277
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,547
TO FORWARD-LOOKING THE SYSTEM. 

278
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:29,848
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT 

279
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:31,117
ULTIMATELY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 

280
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,385
CHANGE THE LAW. 

281
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,619
THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER 

282
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,088
HAS GIVEN A TEMPORARY SOLUTION 

283
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,491
TO THE PROBLEM, BUT IT IS NOT 

284
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,658
PERMANENT AND WE NEED CONGRESS 

285
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,394
TO STEP UP AND DEMOCRATS TO 

286
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,495
STOP PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES, 

287
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,596

288
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,300
PRESIDENT AND FIX THE PROBLEM 

289
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,733

290
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,602
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

295
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,074
>> SURE I WAS RESPONDING TO A

00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,475
NUMBER OF NEWS STORIES. 

297
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,412
I HAD BEEN REACHED OUT TO BY A 

298
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,345
DOZEN REPORTERS AND NEWS 

299
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:01,948

300
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,982
IT WAS CONSIDERED NEWS OF THE 

301
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,384
DAY, SO I RESPONDED THE WAY I 

302
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,352

DAY STORY. 

304
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,689
>> Reporter: JUST BECAUSE YOU 

305
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,190
DON'T SEE A JUDGE DOESN'T MEAN 

306
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,693
YOU DON'T GET DUE PROCESS. 

307
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,761
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IS THAT AND HOW 

308
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,461
THE PRESIDENT ENVISIONS THIS 

309
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:17,496
WOULD WORK, WHILE STILL 

310
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,732
MAINTAINING WHAT THE 

311
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,232
CONSTITUTION UPHOLDS? 

312
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:24,103
AND HAVING A SWIFT IMMIGRATION 

313
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:24,336
SYSTEM. 

314
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,671
>> AGAIN THERE ARE OTHER WAYS 

315
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,238
FOR REMOVAL. 

316
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,174
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL 

317
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,708
ALIENS REMOVED EVERY MONTH THAT 

318
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,976
DON'T SEE JUDGES. 

319
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:31,611
SOMETIMES THAT IS THROUGH 

320
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,510
VOLUNTEER REMOVAL AND SOMETIMES 

321
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,081
THAT IS THROUGH EXPEDITED 

322
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:35,514

AGAIN THE PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATE 

324
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,417
GOAL WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE 

325
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,017
ACTUALLY A SECURE BORED AND 

326
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,318
PEOPLE AREN'T COMING INTO THE 

327
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,320
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, BUT THAT WE 

328
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,288
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND 

329
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,688
THE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO THE 

330
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,493
COUNTRY COME IN THROUGH A LEGAL 

331
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:47,726
SYSTEM. 

332
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:48,694
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE 

333

THIS WEEK TO ENSURE CONGRESS

ALL WEEKEND, EXCUSE ME, TALKING 

338
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,770
ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN

BORDERS AND CRIME. 

340
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,872
BUT SPECIFICALLY HAS HE MADE 

341
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,906
PHONE CALLS TO REPUBLICAN 

342
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:03,308
MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE

WHAT IS HE DOING, SPECIFICALLY, 

345
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,817
TO TRY TO GET A NEW LAW PASSED 

346
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,417
SPECIFICALLY, OTHER THAN JUST 

347
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,885
RAILING AGAINST THE CURRENT 

348
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:14,086
LAW? 

349
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,688
>> THE PRESIDENT MET WITH A

LAST WEEK HE MADE AN OPEN

WOULD LIKE TO SEE. 

360
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,336
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WANTS 

361
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:30,636

362
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,872

SOLUTIONS. 

369
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:47,920
IT IS CONGRESS' JOB TO DO THAT 

370
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,789
AND WE HAVE LAID OUT CLEARLY WE

>> CLEARLY THEY AREN'T. 

375
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:59,098
REPUBLICANS HAVE LAID OUT A 

376
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,801
NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT THEY 

377
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,101
SUPPORT. 

378
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,903
THE PRESIDENT VOICED HIS 

379
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,204
SUPPORT FOR THOSE. 

380
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,107
BECAUSE NO DEMOCRAT WILL GET ON 

381
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:12,011
BOARD AND LAME SUPPORT A 

382
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,114
SOLUTION -- AND SUPPORT A 

383
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:15,380
SOLUTION. 

384
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,615
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE 

385
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,450
REPUBLICAN PARTY DOING? 

386
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,319
>> JEFF THESE AREN'T REPUBLICAN 

387
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:20,552
BILLS. 

388
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,687
THEY MAY HAVE REPUBLICAN 

389
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,423
SPONSORS, BUT THEY SHOULD BE 

390
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:24,723
BIPARTISAN. 

391
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,225
LOOK THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY 

392
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,893
PASSED OVER 500 PIECES OF 

393
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,226
LEGISLATION. 

394
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:29,795
BUT THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH THE 

395
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,297
SENATE BECAUSE DEMOCRATS REFUSE 

396
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,999
TO ACTUALLY FIND SOLUTIONS. 

397
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,300
WE HAVE 50 BILLS THAT PASSED 

398
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,802
JUST LAST WEEK TO ADDRESS THE 

399
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,870
OPIOID CRISIS THAT PASSED 

400
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,404
THROUGH THE HOUSE. 

401
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,174
THE SENATE STILL HASN'T TAKEN 

402
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:42,741
THEM UP. 

403
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:43,609
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL. 

404
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,311
IF THEY DO THAT WILL SHOW WE 

405
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,013
CAN COME UP WITH BIPARTISAN 

406
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,515
SOLUTIONS AND THAT IS WHAT WE'D 

407
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,116
LIKE TO SEE ON IMMIGRATION AS 

408
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:51,316
WELL. 

409
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,318
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT SAID 

410
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,819
LAST WEEK AFTER SIGNING THE 

411
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,921
EXECUTIVE ORDER HE BELIEVED THE 

412
00:10:55,921 --> 00:11:00,126
ZERO TOLERANCE WAS STILL 

413
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:00,426
IMPORTANT. 

414
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,295
THE POINT OF FACT HOW DOES THAT 

415
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,697
SQUARE WITH THE FACT THEY ARE 

416
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,898
NO LONGER REFERRING FOR 

417
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,299
PROSECUTION ANY ADULTS WHO COME 

418
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,867
IN WITH CHILDREN? 

419
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,702
>> AGAIN THIS IS A TEMPORARY 

420
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,002
SOLUTION. 

421
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,470
THIS ISN'T GOING TO LAST. 

422
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,637
CONGRESS STILL HAS TO STEP UP. 

423
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:15,374
THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB. 

424
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,508
THIS WILL ONLY LAST A SHORT 

425
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,009
AMOUNT OF TIME. 

426
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,343
WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF 

427
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:20,478
SPACE, WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT 

428
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,914
OF RESOURCES IN ORDER TO KEEP 

429
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,981
PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WE ARE 

430
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,917
ASKING CONGRESS TO PROVIDE 

431
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,419
THOSE RESOURCES AND DO THEIR 

432
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:26,619
JOB. 

433
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,586
>> Reporter: DOES THAT MEAN AT 

434
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,888
SOME POINT YOU ARE GOING TO 

435
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,822
CHANGE THAT POLICY BACK? 

436
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,724
>> WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE 

437
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:31,991
POLICY. 

438
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,492
WE ARE SIMPLY OUT OF RESOURCES 

439
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,027
AND AT SOME POINT CONGRESS HAS 

440
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,294
TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO 

441
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:38,230
DO AND THAT IS SECURE OUR 

442
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:38,463
BORDER. 

443
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:41,300
THAT IS STOP THE CRIME COMING 

444
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,968
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 

445
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,470
THE COUNTRY HAS MADE IT 

446
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,871
EXTREMELY CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT 

447
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,072
OPEN BORDERS AND DEMOCRATS NEED 

448
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,440
TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEY 

449
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,744
NEED TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS 

450
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,313
AND FIND SOME SOLUTIONS. 

451
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,414
>> Reporter: YOU MENTIONED THE 

452
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,216
STATE OF RESOURCES AND RUNNING 

453
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:57,816
OUT OF THEM. 

454
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,551
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 

455
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,719
THE WE ARE SOURCES ARE RIGHT 

456
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,289
NOW FOR HOUSING PARENTS AND 

457
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:03,722
CHILDREN TOGETHER? 

458
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,724
IS THERE ENOUGH HOUSING RIGHT 

459
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,392
NOW? 

460
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,126
WHAT IS BEING DONE? 

461
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,994
>> AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING AT 

462
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:09,695
EVERY POPPINGS AVAILABLE. 

463
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,399
WE HAVE ASKED THE PENTAGON TO 

464
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,833
HELP WITH ADDITIONAL SPACE. 

465
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,502
BUT A LOT THAT HAV WILL DEPEND 

466
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,703
ON OUR ABILITY TO STOP PEOPLE 

467
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,573
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY 

468
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,173
ILLEGALLY. 

469
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,609
AND WE AGAIN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 

470
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,810
TO GO THROUGH PORTS OF ENTRY 

471
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,314
INSTEAD OF CROSSING THE BORDER 

472
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:28,614
ILLEGALLY. 

473
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,548
WE HAVE REQUESTED, THROUGH 

474
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,017
LEGISLATION, WE ARE WORKING 

475
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,719
WITH CONGRESS, HOPEFULLY, TO 

476
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,221
PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AND THE 

477
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,624
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE 

478
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:38,824
LAW. 

479
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,826
>> Reporter: I WANT TO SEE IF 

480
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,228
YOU CAN NARROW DOWN EXACTLY 

481
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,896
WHAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 

482
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,831
INTENDS TO DO WITH THIS IDEA OF 

483
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,065
NOT HAVING JUDGES. 

484
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,801
YOU SAY THAT THERE ARE 

485
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,902
INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T 

486
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,071
HAVE JUDGES BUT MY 

487
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,706
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU 

488
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,474
ASK FOR ASYLUM YOU HAVE CERTAIN 

489
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:55,774
RIGHTS. 

490
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,808
SO IS THERE GOING TO BE A 

491
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,944
CHANGE IN THAT POLICY? 

492
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,379
OR WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 

493
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,014
PLANNING TO DO TO MAKE IT SO 

494
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,082
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE A JUDGE? 

495
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,317
>> AGAIN, I HAVE ADDRESSED THIS 

496
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,753
A COUPLE OF TIMES. 

497
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,521
THERE ARE MULTIPLE INSTANCES IN 

498
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,655
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T. 

499
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:11,990
VOLUNTEER REMOVAL, EXPEDITED 

500
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,257
REMOVAL. 

501
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:13,893
IF SOMEBODY COMES THROUGH A 

502
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,795
PORT OF ENTRY, SEEKING ASYLUM, 

503
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,631
THOSE CASES AND THAT PROCESS 

504
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,298
WILL BE HEARD. 

505
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,033
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE 

506
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,901
PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO 

507
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,436
SECURE THE BORED AND STOP 

508
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:24,903
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 

509
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:25,971
>> Reporter: I UNDERSTAND THAT. 

510
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,973
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 

511
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,674
PRACTICALLY? 

512
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,609
IS THE PRESIDENT PLANNING TO DO 

513
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,243
ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? 

514
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,110
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT 

515
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,612
WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. 

516
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,914
WE HAVE PUT OUT THE THINGS WE 

517
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,917
WANT TO SEE IN AN IMMIGRATION 

518
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,084
PACKAGE MONTHS AGO. 

519
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,119
WE ARE STILL WAITING ON 

520
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,321
CONGRESS TO GIVE US THE ABILITY 

521
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:42,654
TO DO THAT. 

522
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:43,822
>> Reporter: SO UNLESS CONGRESS 

523
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,025
ACTS NOTHING IS ACTUALLY GOING 

524
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:46,358
TO CHANGE? 

525
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,993
THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT 

526
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,228
CHANGING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. 

527
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,330
>> YOU MEAN ARE WE WALKING 

528
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,698
AROUND MAKING UP LAWS? 

529
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:52,898
NO. 

530
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,099
WE ARE NOT THE OBAMA 

531
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:54,466
ADMINISTRATION. 

532
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,301
WE ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE 

533
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,935
LAWS ON THE BOOKS. 

534
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,537
WE ARE ASKING CONGRESS TO DO 

535
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,972
THEIR PART IN THE PROCESS AND 

536
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,874
PASS NEW LEGISLATION THAT WILL 

537
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,974
FIX OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 

538
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:03,541
>> Reporter: NOTHING IS 

539
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,043
CHANGING ON THE GROUND? 

540
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,011
SO THE PRESIDENT IS COMPLAINING 

541
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,413
ABOUT JUDGES AND SAYING WE 

542
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,615
SHOULDN'T HAVE ALL THESE JUDGES 

543
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,317
AND PEOPLE WHO COME OVER SHOULD 

544
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,218
JUST BE PUT OUT BUT NOTHING IS 

545
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,419
ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE? 

546
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:15,687
HE IS JUST COMPLAINING ABOUT 

547
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,724
THE PROCESS AS IT STANDS NOW? 

548
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,225
>> THINGS THAT WE HAVE THE 

549
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,994
ABILITY TO DO ADMINISTRATIVELY 

550
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,361
WE ARE WORKING TO DO. 

551
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,496
BUT AGAIN, CONGRESS IS THE ONLY 

552
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,498
ONE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO 

553
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,200
WRITE LAW AND WE HOPE THEY WILL 

554
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,234
DO IS THAT. 

555
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,969
>> Reporter: I'M TRYING TO úUND 

556
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:32,204
PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS ABOUT THE 

557
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,004
CURRENT POLICY. 

558
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,773
AS YOU EXPLAINED, EXPEDITED 

559
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,074
REMOVAL ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT 

560
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:39,712
TO REMOVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 

561
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,313
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS A YEAR 

562
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:42,247
WITHOUT SEEING JUDGES. 

563
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,115
DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW THAT 

564
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,050
WHEN HE ISSUED THE TWEETS? 

565
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,418
>> YEAH BUT THERE ARE STILL 

566
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,320
THOUSANDS THAT GO THROUGH A 

567
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,221
VERY LENGTHY PROCESS. 

568
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,724
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE PROCESS 

569
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,927
CONSOLIDATED, THE BACKLOG 

570
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,797
STOPPED, OUR BORDERS SECURED 

571
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:58,963
IT. 

572
00:14:58,963 --> 00:14:59,999
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE SAID THAT 

573
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,401
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE 

574
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:02,868
EXPEDITED REMOVAL. 

575
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,203
DOES THE PRESIDENT INTEND TO 

576
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:09,108
EXPAND IT TO THE FULL 2-YEAR 

577
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,211
LIMIT UNDER THE CURRENT 

578
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:12,478
STATUTE? 

579
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,412
>> AGAIN ULTIMATELY, WE WOULD 

580
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,514
LIKE TO SEE THE BORDER SECURED 

581
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,616
AND PEOPLE STOP COMING INTO THE 

582
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:18,116
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 

583
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,818
THAT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE TO ME 

584
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,620
AND BO STOP A LOT OF THE 

585
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,222
PROBLEMS AND WOULD ELIMINATE 

586
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,124
THE NEED FOR MANY OF THESE 

587
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:25,524
ADDITIONAL LAWS. 

588
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:30,029
>>> YOU BEGAN THE BRIEFING 

589
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,130
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF 

590
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,997
CIVILITY. 

591
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,499
DO YOU CONSIDER IT A CIVIL 

592
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,834
POLICY TO SEPARATE MORE THAN 

593
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,302
2,000 CHILDREN FROM THEIR 

594
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:37,870
FAMILIES. 

595
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,071
>> WE CONSIDER ENFORCING THE 

596
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,606
LAW THE ROLE THE ADMINISTRATION 

597
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,473
HAS TO PLAY. 

598
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,175
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

599
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,910
TAKEN AN EXECUTIVE ACTION TO 

600
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,911
THE FURTHEST THAT HE HAS THE 

601
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,214
ABILITY TO DO, TO MINIMIZE THE 

602
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,081
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES. 

603
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,418
WE ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE 

604
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,418
SURE FAMILIES GET TO STAY 

605
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:54,319
TOGETHER AND WE ARE CALLING ON 

606
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,821
CONGRESS TO HELP US IN THAT 

607
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,489
EFFORT, AND WE ARE CONTINUING 

608
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,624
FOCUS ON THE REUNIFICATION AND 

609
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,827
MAKING SURE THAT THE FAMILIES, 

610
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,828
AGAIN, STAY TOGETHER AND THAT 

611
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,696
CONGRESS WILL GIVE US A 

612
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:07,633
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO FIX THAT. 

613
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:07,799
>>> 

614
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,302

615
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,703
ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIRST 

616

THAT CREATED THESE LAWS. 

619
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,942
BUT IT IS OUR ADMINISTRATION'S 

620
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,476
JOB TO ENFORCE IT. 

621
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:20,012
IF SOMEONE BREAKS THE LAW, IT 

622
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,480
IS OUR JOB TO ENFORCE IT. 

623
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,615
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T LIKE THE 

624
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,117
LAW, THEY NEED TO LOBBY 

625
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,119
CONGRESS AND ASK THEM TO CHANGE 

626
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,285
IT.

>> Reporter: ONE IMMIGRATION 

628
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:29,488
QUESTION. 

629
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,522
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY 

630
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,524
ADULT WITH A CHILD IS GOING TO 

631
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,025
BE PROSECUTED. 

632
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,627
IF THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE 

633
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,030
BEING HELD TOGETHER, DETAINED 

634
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,897
TOGETHER SOMEWHERE AND 20 DAYS 

635
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,599
GOES BY, WHAT IS GOING TO 

636
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:40,932
HAPPEN THEN? 

637
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,534
I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER ABOUT 

638
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,802
THAT LAST WEEK. 

639
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,504
THE LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T KEEP THE 

640
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,872
CHILDREN, EVEN WITH PARENTS, 

641
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,974
FOR LONGER THAN 20 DAYS. 

642
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,375
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS? 

643
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,110
>> HOPEFULLY CONGRESS WILL PASS 

644
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,211
A LAW AND FIX THE PROBLEM. 

645
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,613
WHY SHOULD IT BE SO HARD? 

646
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:57,416
THEY SAUL SAY THEY DON'T WANT 

647
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,184
TO SEPARATE FAMILIES. 

648
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:01,320
SEEMS SIMPLE TO ME. 

649
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,821
>> Reporter: JEFF ASKED YOU A 

650
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,824
QUESTION ABOUT CONGRESS AND THE 

651

BILL. 

652
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,326
WERE YOU, IN YOUR RESPONSE, 

653
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,027
REFERRING TO JUST A STAND ALONE 

654

BILL THAT DEALS WITH FAMILY 

655
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,230
SEPARATION? 

656
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,031
OR WERE YOU REFERRING TO THE 

657
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:15,968
BIGGER IMMIGRATION BILL THE 

658
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,469

PILLARS THAT WE HAVE LAID OUT 

662
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,909

ADDRESS IN AN IMMIGRATION

FOCUS IS RIGHT NOW. 

666
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,512
THERE IS A BILL THAT DOES THAT 

667
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:29,347
ON THE TABLE. 

668
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:31,016
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE'LL 

669
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,918
TALK ABOUT OTHER PIECES OF 

670
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,554

STILL WANTS THAT BILL TO GO

FORWARD? 

675
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:42,694
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE CLEAR 

676
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,129
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT 

677
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:44,329
THIS. 

678
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,230
WE NEED AT LEAST SOME DEMOCRATS 

679
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,032
TO GET ON BOARD, THEY HAVE MADE 

680
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:47,765
IT CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT TO

LOOKING AT THE BEST WAYS WE CAN 

690

00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,325
WE'D LIKE TO STOP THE PROBLEM 

746
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,628
BEFORE IT STARTS AND THAT IS 

747
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,261
THE FOCUS SECURING THE BORDER. 

748
00:19:57,261 --> 00:20:02,767
THANKS SO MUCH GUYS, HAVE A 

749
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,604
GREAT DAY. 

750
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,607
>>> THAT WAS SARAH HUCKABEE 

751
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,274
SANDERS ADDRESSING REPORTERS IN 

752
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,241
THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM, 

753
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,444
TOUCHING ON A LOT OF TOPICS 

754
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,845
FROM IMMIGRATION, THAT REALLY 

755
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,048
DOMINATED IT, BUT ALSO TRADE. 

756
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,918
WE SPOKE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT 

757
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,753
HARLEY DAVIDSON MOVING 

758
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:22,420
PRODUCTION OVERSEAS BECAUSE OF 

759
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,788
TARIFF INCREASES FROM THE EU. 

760
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,424
SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT HER 

761
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,426
EXPERIENCE AT THE RESTAURANT IN 

762
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,327
VIRGINIA, RED HEN, WHERE SHE 

763
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,461
WAS ASKED TO LEAVE. 

764
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,261
>> SHE DID MENTION IT BECAME 

765
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,631
THE NEWS OF THE DAY, WHICH IS 

766
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,335
WHY SHE ADDRESSED IT ON HER 

767
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:36,735
OFFICIAL E-MAIL. 

768
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,906
IN TERMS OF THE EU TARIFFS, 

769
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,308
SANDERS SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT 

770
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,243
THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE 

771
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,112
EUROPEAN UNION AND DIDN'T PLACE 

772
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,947
ANY BLAME ON HARLEY DAVIDSON 

773
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,115
FOR THE REPORTS THEY ARE GOING 

774
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,317
TO BE MOVING A BIG PART OF 

775
00:20:53,317 --> 00:21:03,461
THEIR PRODUCTION TO EUROPE. 

776
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,431
>> NO MENTION THAT THESE ARE 

777
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,731
RECIPROCAL. 

778
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,933
REALLY THE DISCUSSION FOCUSED 

779
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,566
ON IMMIGRATION. 

780
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,735
THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTS 

781
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,104
CLARITY O WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO 

782
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:12,471
THESE FAMILIES? 

783
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,372
HOW MANY HAVE BEEN REUNITED? 

784
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:18,944
AND WHAT HAPPENS NOW AFTER 20 

785
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,245
DAYS THAT, WHERE SUPPOSEDLY 

786
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:21,646
THESE FAMILIES WILL HAVE THAT 

787
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,515
CAP PUT ON THEM. 

788
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:24,950
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 

789
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,753
>> CBS NEWS WASHINGTON 

790
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,521
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID JOINS 

791
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:29,788
US NOW. 

792
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:34,525
LET'S START WITH THAT QUESTION. 

793
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,727
YOU KNOW, ANITA KUMAR TRIED TO 

794
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,329
GET CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WILL 

795
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,030
HAPPEN TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 

796
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,933
WHO ARE DETAINED TOGETHER AFTER 

797
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:47,105
THAT 20-DAY LIMIT ASKED UP -- 

798
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,973
LIMIT IS UP. 

799
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,808
SANDERS WAS EVASIVE. 

800
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:51,342
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 

801
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:52,144
CONGRESS COULD PASS SOME SORT 

802
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,979
OF NEW LAW THAT WOULD OVERRIDE 

803
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:55,647
THAT RESTRICTION THAT, CHILDREN 

804
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,349
CAN ONLY BE HELD FOR 20 DAYS. 

805
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,452
BUT LET'S BE REAL. 

806
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,587
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLY UNREALISTIC 

807
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,656
CONGRESS IS GOING TO PASS 

808
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,189
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION 

809
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,525
REFORM IN WHAT IS LESS THAN 20 

810
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,225
DAYS. 

811
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,092
THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. 

812
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:09,460
THAT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

813
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,296
HAS ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN 

814
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:13,432
CALIFORNIA TO MODIFY THAT 

815
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,633
RULING TO ALLOW THE 

816
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,334
ADMINISTRATION TO HOLD FAMILIES 

817
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,136
TOGETHER, SO THEY CONTINUE TO 

818
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,905
ENFORCE THEIR ZERO TOLERANCE 

819
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:20,205
POLICY. 

820
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,407
BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO 

821
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,074
SEPARATE CHILDREN AND PARENTS, 

822
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:24,709
THEY COULD HOLD THEM TOGETHER. 

823
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,646
BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY 

824
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,047
UNREALISTIC THAT JUDGE IS GOING 

825
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,549
TO MODIFY THAT LAW, BECAUSE 

826
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,851
THAT JUDGE HAS ALREADY REVIEWED 

827
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,753
THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION AND 

828
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,053
UPHELD IT. 

829
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,455
SO FAR FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE NOT 

830
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,757
BEEN WILLING TO ENDORSE THE 

831
00:22:38,757 --> 00:00:00,000
INDEFINITE DETENTION OF MINORS
