hi I'm Neelu tabrizi I'm a journalist
with vice news this week I'll be on the
line discussing synthetic marijuana it's
known as k2 and spice on the street and
in New York in particular there's been a
sharp increase of overdoses among its
homeless population who's coming here to
buy things like k2 and spice it's almost
entirely the homeless people cheap and
it's killing them yeah absolutely it so
if you have any questions or want to
join the show you can hit up vice news
on twitter with the hashtag on the line
