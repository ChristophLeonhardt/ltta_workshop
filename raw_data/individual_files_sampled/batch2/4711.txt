but Jean Hartley is also with me Jane of course former US ambassador to France Christopher Dickey world news editor at The Daily Beast he's also an MSNBC contributor David Ignatius flooring columnist and associate editor at The Washington Post and Andy card is with me as well in the court of course former White House chief of staff and the president george w bush currently an MSNBC political analyst and kristen let me start with you you got hooked up pretty quickly there in the East Room let's uh let's start with with some of the highlights here as they relate to Syria and Iran and then of course the news that the president just made regarding his pick to run at the VA let's start right there Craig because it was really big news he was asked effectively what he knows about the allegations against Ronnie Jackson the president sort of dismissing some of the questions surrounding his personal conduct whether he's created a workplace that is effectively not productive and that is an unpleasant place to work the president saying he doesn't know a whole lot about that but really standing behind him saying he's one of the finest people I have met at the same time Craig he said he told Ronnie Jackson is it worth it to stay in this process he said ultimately the decision is going to be up to him and that's our understanding based on conversations with sources that it really is going to be up to Ronnie Jackson whether he wants to have his personal life looked into on this level but it was a remarkable response from the president because he effectively set the stage Craig for Ronnie Jackson potentially withdrawing his nomination now if he was pressed would he continue to stand by Jackson he said yes I will always continue to stand by him so a little bit of mixed messaging here when he was asked about the person who's now become a very controversial pick to the next VA seven in terms of the other headlines Craig and there were a lot let's go to North Korea he was asked what specifically he meant by the term daemon clear ization remember he was tweeting about that over the weekend that North Korea had effectively agreed to denuclearize not exactly accurate but they've agreed to begin discussions about that potentially take a listen to how he responded to that question get rid of their nukes and nobody else would say it'd be very easy for me to make a simple deal in claimed victory I don't want to do that I want them to get rid of their nukes so there you had it he was pressed on the fact that earlier today he referred to Kim jong-un as someone who's been very honorable in this process Jeff Mason pressing him on that saying look this is someone who's accused of starving his own people murdering his own people how can you say that he's been honorable the president defending his comments and saying look this is potentially the start of critical negotiations to make the world safer also pressed repeatedly on the Iran nuclear deal and that's where I think you saw these huge differences exposed between president Trump and the president of France who could really feel the president of France trying to push President Trump to stay in that deal despite the fact that President Trump repeatedly indicating that he's seriously taking a look at either pulling out or making sure that the deal is changed very significantly and then one final note Craig he was asked about Syria there's been a big back-and-forth about how long the u.s. is going to stay in Syria the president of France wanting a longer term commitment from the United States President Trump simply saying that the US will pull out relatively soon what does that mean those are some of the details we're gonna have to drill down on now Craig Christian Walker out there in the East Room Garrett Haake is over on Capitol Hill we'll go to him in just a moment he spent some time a few moments actually with Ronnie Jackson a short time ago let me bring in Jayne Hartley here again former US ambassador to France Jane it was interesting to hear as Kristen just alluded to the the contrast between our president and the president of France as it relates to the future of this nuclear deal with Iran president McCrone saying he would essentially like to see the current plan kept intact but enhanced in a number of ways as well yes I was actually ambassador when we negotiated the jcpoa and France was a critical Ally with John Kerry and President Obama it was interesting listening to President Trump who still is as negative as he has been before on jcpoa but been listening to McCrone who was talking I think a lot about a new approach but a third deal which I had not seen him talk about that much in the past and I think that third deal has to do with ballistic missiles and also with Iran's behavior in the region now whether a third deal would be acceptable to Iran I think is another question but it I think it does represent first of all Beckham McCrone is very good anybody who's watched him win as president at the election that no one thought he could win initially as president of France anybody who's watched him do what he did in terms of labor reform in France McCrone is one of the best both strategically and technically you know whoa you walked with him yes I do he's impressive he's been an impressive president he was minister of the economy when I was ambassador and you know did some really great things but he is a master of strategy and and listening a little to the press conference today between the two of them I was wondering how both of them could get a win-win and I don't know the answer to that but I think France is totally committed to jcpoa as our allies are and we are kind of the only one over to the side on that I do think we will be isolated internationally if we don't stay with that agreement but I think the McCrone is now trying in terms of this third approach to do something in terms of Iran's political behavior in the area and on ballistic missiles it was fascinating to see the president of France come out no notes appeared to be speaking extemporaneous there for the most part and during the QA you did not see him him look down at note one david ignatius there was something else that has been a bit striking throughout the course of the morning this this bromance that seems to exist between president mark Cronin president Trump between the handshakes and the kisses and the man hugs you get the sense that there is this this genuine warmth between the two of them well it's been clear since Donald Trump had dinner with Mike Rowe at the eiffel tower that he likes Mike Rowe he feels comfortable with him that that was visible to everyone in the in the encounter did it today at the White House it's a little awkward for president Mike Rome back home because this friendship with Donald Trump is not the most popular thing among the French public but it's clear that macro is able to use the relationship he has with Donald Trump to get some of what he wants as I try to decode what's happened on Syria the phrase President Trump used was he we're now gonna move to a much bigger deal is that deal he hated the jcpoa I was terrible deal but now we're gonna go to a much bigger deal that's gonna incorporate three other areas ballistic missiles and most of all regional issues starting with Syria so so Mike Ross drawn Trump into a process that will have Syria negotiations at the center that will involve Russia there will involve Turkey I'd have to say for French diplomacy today is a day when they don't think they accomplished quite a lot our chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell has joined me as well and Andrea I know that you were watching and then listening very closely to the to the exchange there between the two presidents what stood out most to you well exactly what David Ignatius was saying McCrone arrived here and this is not popular back home but he really softened up Donald Trump Donald Trump the president saying how bad the deal is that he hates the the Iran nuclear deal the worst deal ever made but by the end of this news conference they are talking about a bigger follow-on deal now this is something that the European leaders been pushing for very strongly but this is the closest this president has come to suggesting that perhaps on May 12th he will not blow up the deal he didn't say exactly what he's going to do on this next deadline May 12th when they have to decide and when he said he's going to you know not extend the sanctions which would in effect being blowing up the deal in taking the u.s. out of it but he certainly hinted that he said McCrone knows what I'm gonna do but nobody else knows what I'm going to do but then said that he understands or at least is considering a longer deal which would consider ballistic missiles all of the things that the president has said all along should have been negotiated in the first place a longer term nuclear hold which would change the so-called sunset provision that would now end it after 10 years and also include ballistic missile ban and include Iran's misbehavior in Yemen as far as the US and France considers for Yemen Lebanon and Syria also I thought important that the president seems to be committing recommitting to staying in Syria with a larger footprint despite his desire to get US troops out that's also under the influence of course of defense secretary mattis and general Dunford and it's also defining for the first time what he means by denuclearization or debris meaning getting rid of the nukes and also calling Kim jong-un having behaved honorably but of course domestically the big headline is what he said about Ronnie Jackson that's the broadest hint of all that he told dr. Jackson you know if I were you I wouldn't stay in this what do you need this for what do you need running this big agency with this bunch of politicians their disgusting behavior that was a big a big exit strategy for this nomination which appears to be doomed and it's not because of Democratic obstruction it's a bipartisan approach that came out of the Senate today postponing indefinitely this hearing Christopher Dickey saying before me I want to come down the international stuff in just a moment but I know IndyCar it's got to catch a flight here so indeed had me come to you and just picking up on home where Andrea left off there is that is that how you read the message they're their own President Trump going on on about how fantastic of a guy Admiral Jackson is a doctor of course of President Obama before President trumpet in the end Trump saying I don't think personally he should do it and do we have that said let's listen actually this is the president talking about his nominee to run the Department of Veterans Affairs I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago I said what do you need this for this is a vicious group of people that maligned and they do and I live through it we all live through it you people are getting record ratings because of it so congratulations but I said what do you need it for he's an admiral it's a great leader and they questioned him about every little thing Andi card if your Admiral Ronnie Jackson you hear that and think what well first of all I thought if President Trump was pretty candid about discussing that situation he was basically saying I stand with him but he's got to make his own mind up and decide what he wants to do and that's where a role for the chief of staff to step it in and say okay dr. Jackson you know the situation we're with you as long as you'd like us to be with you it's up to you do you want to go through this or not I don't think that's unusual at all in fact I think that's kind of the appropriate way for the president to respond to this that clearly dr. Jackson has some challenges on the hill but he's going to decide whether or not he thinks it's worth going through the battle and the president is saying I'm willing to go through the battle with you if you think it's worth with the effort so but by just passing the ball it also sounds like the president was very much hinting as sort of wink wink nod nod to his nominee hey buddy if you want to back out I certainly would understand why I think that's exactly right I think that's what he said but he said I'm willing to stand with you if you want me to stand with you and that is also important but the visit of the president of France to the United States is a very big deal the state visit means that there's a lot of work that's being done not just between the presidents themselves but also among the next layer down and the members of the cabinet that are involved in kind of negotiations of with the French on a myriad of itch issues and that's all very good i think this visit has been good for the world to see it's been good for America to see and I actually think it's demonstrated to the president Trump can stand on that world stage pretty well I thought the press conference they just had was surprisingly candid it didn't appear that either Canada either President was necessarily reading from a script' I thought they were both knowledgeable no one coherent and demonstrated growing common ground and that's always good to see in diplomacy Chris Dickey is that is that how you would characterize the exchange well I think it's clear that McCraw was not reading from a script I think it's absolutely clear that President Trump was reading very carefully and a little bit hesitantly from a script in his in his initial remarks but it was a fascinating press conference and the chemistry between the two men was evident and the way mackerel maneuvers Trump was also I think quite quite conspicuous you know he's essentially saying I agree with you completely Donald I think you you're exactly right but I just want to tweak these few little things I get the sense that you think that Francis president might be manipulating ours just a wee bit oh absolutely I mean there's a famous parable by LaFontaine about Fox on the ground and a crow with cheese on the branch and the and the Fox keeps flattering the crow until the crow opens its mouth to speak and drops the cheese and the Fox runs off with it well that's exactly the parable that the French use to describe this relationship where where the Fox of course is macron Garrett Haake let me come back to you here for just a moment because again you sort of got that exclusive sound a short time ago with Admiral Jackson what did he tell you and what since you getting there on the hill about his future well Craig it's interesting if we take the president at his word that this conversation with Jackson happened before this press conference saying I wouldn't necessarily do it if I were you but it's your call we got from Admiral Jackson what I think was his answer that he is still here meeting with Republican senators on the committee that would have to approve him and saying as he said to me he looks forward to answering all of the questions about his background take a listen to our exchange backs of Jackson can you say anything at all about these allegations that have come out against you in the last few days now I just say that I was looking forward to the hearing tomorrow kind of disappointed that it's been postponed but I'm looking forward to getting to reschedule and answer everybody's questions you've seen the allegations a hostile work environment allegations about potentially drinking on the job over prescribing medications are you saying those are categorically untrue I'm saying I'm looking forward to the hearing so we can sit down and I can explain everything to everyone in the answer all the Senators questions that doesn't sound like a person who's planning on withdrawing and I asked him that question directly whether he would withdraw he didn't answer but just by the fact of being here and saying he's still planning to answer the questions suggest to dr. Jackson was in this for the long haul but look Craig he's got real problems here and as Andrea pointed out this is not just political he has problems with the Republicans on this committee very much as much as he has with the Democrats there was sort of the pre-existing concern about his experience level and now these new allegations that bubbled up from sort of Thursday night over the weekend have even Republicans who were favorably inclined towards him a little bit spooked no one knows the full scope of what might still come out about him and I think that has a lot of people here very nervous about the prospect of proceeding and why we see this hearing delayed not just to a point in the near future but indefinitely was was that well Jackson was was he screen was he vetted was there a formal interview or do we know we don't I certainly don't know up here on Capitol Hill and that's the big the big question I'm talking to lawmakers about Admiral Jackson and frankly having a version of this conversation about director Pompeo and Gina Haspel and any one of any number of other appointments that the White House is set up here there is a frustration among the senators who are in the personnel business the business of approving or disapproving of who the president sends up for these cabinet positions judicial appointments things of that nature that they don't feel like the White House does a very robust job of vetting people at all that they come up here with huge holes in their background than in many cases you could drive a truck through and you've seen that in certain situations where candidates especially for those judicial postings of which there are so many get exposed in these hearings of not knowing basic issues of constitutional law for example this appears to be another case in which things that perhaps the White House should have very well known about before they nominated Admiral Jackson only came out very late in the game when the senator is charged with advising and consenting on his nomination really got to work on digging in on his background david ignatius really quickly here's as we as we look ahead to later in the week German Chancellor Angela Merkel is headed to the White House safe to say that the the Chancellor would not be getting the sort of red carpet rollout as we just saw from with French president emmanuel going chrome there miracle won't get the state dinner I don't know if shall get the kiss of the cheek or not but the relationship between the US and Germany Trump and Merkel's is not as warm as as with France essentially Mackrell the French president has done the heavy lifting for Europe he is from what we can tell from this press conference move president Trump towards a position in which rather than tear up the jcpoa he will fold it into a larger deal that the Europeans led by the French will be working on so in that sense of the miracle visit maybe a little easier thanks to the to the French preparation work really quickly yeah we keep talking as if it's a sure thing that Iran will stay in the deal they're already making a lot of signals that they won't Chris deke thank you David Nations ambassador Hartley a big thanks to you as well Garrett Haake on the hill hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
