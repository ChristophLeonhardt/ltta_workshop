00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,580
Hey guys

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,940
Jouelzy's back!

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,700
Clink…clink…clink…claaa…

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,860
It’s my 33rd PopSnark, thirty three like Jesus,

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,340
just don’t crucify me for being gone so long.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,360
[cough]

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,620
Let’s get into this...

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,620
grab yo drank,

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,900
I have my fav

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,600
of course, we can discuss everything

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,759
from the low brow to the highbrow, is your eyebrows on fleek?

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,940
Definitely thumbs this video

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,380
and comment along if you would like to see

15
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,000
#PopSnark be a more regular occurrence.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,200
Cheers girl!

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Are you wondering why this glorious

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
uh...gele

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,880
it's because I am rocking my aso ebi

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,360
I paid very good monies for but

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
was unable to wear because I was 419'd

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,080
and unable to make it to Lagos for the traditional engagement.

23
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,080
but I did attend my beautiful soror Eni's

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,080
white wedding in Accra.

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,580
Definitely reminded me that I needed to marry wealth and uh...

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,280
nah really it was an amazing time,

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,700
it was the bomb.com.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Beautiful wedding...

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
and Eni exclaimed to me that she's a big fan of #PopSnark.

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,260
So in ode to Eni

31

[♫music playing♫]

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,480
[laughs]

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh child, I came back from Ghana

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
and all the YouTube drama was popping off.

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,060
Them thangs ain’t really my tastes anyways,

36
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,060
but just a friendly reminder that

37
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,060
no one has established a successful YouTube channel

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,540
off of strictly talking about negative gossip.

39
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,900
You see ForHarriet & Necole Bitchie has everyone

40
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,160
scrambling to be like

41
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,280
"I amplify inspiration, even if I stalk folks mentions, likes and timelines from 5 years ago."

42
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,920
Heh...

43
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Another year, no slave movies,

44
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,920
no mammies, no sniffling single mothers ,

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,260
no stolen fried chicken, or verbose gangsters,

46
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
and so no Black folks or people of color were nominated

47
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,420
for Oscars this year.

48
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,420
*surprise!*

49
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,420
No…no one was surprised…

50
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
exhaustively disgusted, yes

51
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
but #OscarsSoWhite was

52
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,420
a THING last year and this

53
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,420
wasn’t something we wanted to put into syndication.

54
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Here we are anyway where Adsense is

55
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,420
fueled by Black anger

56
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,420
and all the ignorant white folks of the Academy are getting headlines.

57
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Click, cha-ching, click…

58
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
I haven’t watched a whole Oscars in years.

59
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,900
I care nothing…

60
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
because the truth is actors aren’t the only

61
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,360
sector that needs to diversify.

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Talent agents, producers, directors,

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
aaaannnd anyways Janet Hubert

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
already came through with the petty,

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
to make this conversation way more interesting

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
than some dame thinking that black people have it easier.

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Look Janet, you wasn't girl

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
but you was bitter, therefore making it

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,460
hard to side with you

70
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,140
I watched Jada's video only because

71
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,540
Janet made me interested

72
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,640
Back to the melinated Aunt Viv

73
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Something happened around '94 that

74
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
ended up with a quick exit of

75
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Janet from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air

76
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,180
and Hubert has been going strong with a 22 year grudge

77
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
against Will Smith.

78
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Though she isn't slandering Quincy Jones

79
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,020
who was executive producer of the show.

80
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,020
And definitely would have a had a hand

81
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,680
in the firing of Janet Hubert from the show.

82
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,680
I mean...it was his production company that

83
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,840
produced the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. But, ok sis...

84
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,780
And while Janet did clock some tease as the kids say today.

85
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
She couldn't' let go of mentioning something that

86
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,780
happened while on the cast of a

87
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,780
show that she left

88
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
22 years ago.

89
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Where Will Smith would not support her in getting a raise.

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,640
I mean...GIRL...

91
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,720
LET

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,780
IT

93
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,320
GO!

94
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Kills any argument you have because it's stewed

95
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,460
in bitterness and negativity.

96
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,260
Yes the Smiths have a major production company.

97
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,940
It would be nice to see Overbrook do something more

98
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,240
than land Devon Franklin, who use to be Will Smith's personal assistant, Megan Good.

99
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,160
But, I mean, they did give us Love & Basketball.

100
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,780
So...

101
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,800
Cheers to that!

Daniel Holtzclaw, a cop in Oklahoma City

103
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,760
was sentenced to 263 years in prison

104
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
on multiple counts of

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,080
rape, oral sodomy and sexual battery.

106
00:03:41,760 --> 00:00:00,000
Targeting poor Black women with low level criminal records.
