IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE

THIS LIKELY WILL AFFECT 

11
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,131

THE VAST MAJORITY OF TAX PAYERS 

22
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,755
WILL SEE A LOWER TAX BILL BUT IT

23
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,957

00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:39,145
DOUBLING OF THE STANDARD DID HE

00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,550
WE SEE AN INCOME TAX CUT OF MORE

105
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,852
THAN $2,000, MANY MUCH HIGHER 

106
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,320
THAN THAT SLASHING THEIR TAX 

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,455
BILL IN HALF.

108
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,257
THEY'RE GOING TO START TO SEE 

109
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,160

THEY'RE GOING TO START TO SEE 

112
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:57,029
THAT IN FEBRUARY.

113
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,598
THE NUMBERS WILL SPEAK.

114
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,099
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT 

115
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:00,900
WILL HAPPEN.

116
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,572
I WANT TO THANK AT&T WHO WAS THE

00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,846
THOUGH THEY OWN NBC WHICH IS NOT

120
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,417
SO NICE TO THE PRESIDENT.

121
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,085
COMCAST, THEY ALSO HAVE MADE 

122
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:21,453
TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO 

123
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:24,256
THEIR EMPLOYEES AND TREMENDOUS 

124
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:25,891
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPENDING MONEY 

125
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,593
IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE 

126
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,461
TAX BILL.

127
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,729
THEY ALL SAID IT'S BECAUSE OF 

128
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,797
THE TAX BILL.

129
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,299
THEY'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS 

130
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,000
INVESTMENTS.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,170
THAT MEANS JOBS AND A LOT OF 

132
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,373
THINGS.

133
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:48,181
AT&T, BOEING, COMCAST.

134
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,216
A FRIEND OF MINE BOB CRAFT 

135
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,485
CALLED ME LAST NIGHT AND SAID 

136
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,487
THIS TAX BILL IS INCREDIBLE.

137
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,690
HE OWNS THE NEW ENGLAND 

138
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,091
PATRIOTS, BUT HE'S IN THE PAPER 

139
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,460
BUSINESS TOO.

140
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,262
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO BUY A BIG 

141
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,464
PLANT IN THE GREAT STATE OF 

142
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:06,732
NORTH CAROLINA AND HE'S GOING TO

143
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:09,568
BUILD A TREMENDOUS PAPER MILL 

144
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:12,638
THERE OR PAPER PRODUCTS PLANT.

145
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,474
I'VE HAD MANY CALLS SUCH AS THAT

146
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,776
WHERE PEOPLE THAT ARE 

147
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:20,980
ENTREPRENEURS ARE GOING OUT AND 

148
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,182
GOING TO BUY FACTORIES THAT ARE 

149
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,284
CLOSED, ABANDONED.

150
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,919
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE 

151
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,821
ABANDONED ANY LONGER.

152
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,290
IT'S HAVING AN EVEN BIGGER 

153
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,693
IMPACT FASTER THAN I THOUGHT.

154
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,761
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE LOWERED 

155
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,663
FROM 35% TO 21%.

156
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,731
THAT MEANS MORE PRODUCTS MADE IN

157
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:40,266
THE U.S.A.

158
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,869
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING IN THE

159
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:43,069
U.S.A.

160
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
WE'LL BRING BACK OUR COMPANIES.

161
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,340
THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED COMING 

162
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,607
BACK.

163
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,276
THEY HAD CONFIDENCE IN ME.

164
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,744
THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

165
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,345
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO ME, THE 

166
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,115
FAMILY FARMERS AND SMALL WAS 

167
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,616
OWNERS WHO LOST THEIR BUSINESS 

168
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:02,054
BECAUSE OF THE ESTATE TAX, MOST 

169
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,458
WON'T HAVE ANY ESTATE TAX TO 

170
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:05,725
PAY.

171
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,860
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FARM TO YOUR 

172
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,228
FAMILY, YOUR SMALL BUSINESS TO 

173
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,863
YOUR FAMILY.

174
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,864
NOT EVEN SO SMALL.

175
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:16,369
THE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY BIG HERE.

176
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,105
THEY'LL BE KMEXEMPT FROM PAYING 

177
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:21,340
ESTATE TAX.

178
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:28,147
BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO 

179
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,949
DEDUCT 100% OF THEIR CAPITAL.

180
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,918
IT'S CALLED EXPENSING.

181
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,185
I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 

182
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:34,687
BIGGEST THINGS IN THE BILL.

183
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,722
I THINK PEOPLE WILL GO OUT AND 

184
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,925
GO WILD OVER EXPENSING.

185
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,594
BOB CRAFT MENTIONED THAT LAST 

186
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,563
NIGHT IN HIS TELEPHONE CALL.

187
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,431
THE FACT THEY CAN EXPENSE TO ONE

188
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:49,902
YEAR EXPENSING IS AN ASSET.

189
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,637
HISTORIC SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUTS

190
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,606
ARE MADE REALLY, REALLY GOOD FOR

191
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,541
THE BUSINESS OWNER.

192
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,809
THEY'RE HIRING PEOPLE.

193
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,879
I SEE IT ON TELEVISION.

194
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,882
I'M READING ABOUT IT ALL OVER.

195
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,318
THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUT ARE 

196
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:08,487
NOW REALLY IN CONCERNTY VIEZING 

197
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,155
PEOPLE.

198
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,490
WE'RE GOING TO BRING BACK 

199
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,059
PROBABLY $4 TRILLION FROM 

200
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:14,359
OVERSEAS.

201
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,629
NOBODY KNOWS THE EXACT NUMBER.

202
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,764
IT'S MASSIVE.

203
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,499
IT WILL BE OVER 3 TRILLION.

204
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,068
IT COULD BE 5 TRILLION.

205
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,335
IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 

206
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:26,238
MONEY THAT THE BUREAUCRACY PLUS 

207
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,907
TAX LAWS DIDN'T ALLOW IT TO BE 

208
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,310
BROUGHT BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY.

209
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,779
WE THINK AT LEAST $4 TRILLION 

210
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,447
WILL BE BROUGHT BACK AND IF YOU 

211
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,682
LOOK AT THAT, IT'S GOING TO BE 

212
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,585
BROUGHT BACK RIGHT UNDER THE 

213
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,086
CODE.

214
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,020
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

215
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,856
REPUBLICANS WANTED FOR YEARS AND

216
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,691
DEMOCRATS WANTED FOR YEARS.

217
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,359
YET IT NEVER GOT DONE.

218
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,428
WHO WOULD OBJECT TO TRILLIONS OF

219
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,796
DOLLARS BEING BROUGHT BACK INTO 

220
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,264
OUR COUNTRY?

221
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:52,497
NOBODY.

222
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:53,499
IT NEVER GOT DOWN.

223
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,166
NOW IT IS.

224
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,335
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS THE 

225
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,769
BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORM IN 

226
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,138
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

227
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,540
THIS IS BIGGER THAN ACTUALLY 

228
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,875
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S MANY YEARS 

229
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,042
AGO.

230
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,945
I'M HONORED BY IT.

231
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,248
IN ADDITION WE HAVE ANWAR.

232
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,250
WE'RE OPENING THAT UP FOR 

233
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,517
DRILLING.

234
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,886
THEY'VE TRIED TO GET THAT FOR 40

235
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,153
YEARS.

236
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,389
THEY TRIED TO GET IT DURING THE 

237
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,490
REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.

238
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,626
THAT WOULD BE A BIG BILL IF THAT

239
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:20,893
HAPPENED.

240
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,862
THAT'S PART OF THIS.

241
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,165
WE HAVE OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUAL

242
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,434
MANDATE WHICH IS A VERY UNFAIR 

243
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,602
AND VERY UNPOPULAR PROVISION AS 

244
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:33,873
YOU KNOW IN OBAMACARE.

245
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,240
ESSENTIALLY I THINK IT 

246
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,877
ULTIMATELY LEADS TO THE END OF 

247
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,144
OBAMACARE.

248
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,745
I THINK OBAMACARE IS OVER 

249
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:40,813
BECAUSE OF THAT.

250
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,381
WE'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH 

251
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,315
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY GOING TO

252
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:44,884
BE VERY GOOD.

253
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,886
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WAS VERY 

254
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:47,253
UNFAIR.

255
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,421
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING PAY FOR 

256
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,956
SOMETHING IN ORDER TO NOT TO 

257
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,159
HAVE TO GET HEALTH CARE.

258
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,461
YOU'RE PAYING NOT TO HAVE TO 

259
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,295
HAVE HEALTH CARE.

260
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,563
IT WAS VERY UNFAIR.

261
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,831
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT SHOULD 

262
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,867
HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED IN THE 

263
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,435
SUPREME COURT.

264
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,236
DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT.

265
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:04,469
ALMOST.

266
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:05,838
NOW WE'RE OVERTURNED THE 

267
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,173
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE.

268
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,508
THE MOST UNPOPULAR THING IN 

269
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:09,909
OBAMACARE.

270
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,143
VERY, VERY UNFAIR.

271
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,745
THIS IS THE BILL RIGHT HERE.

272
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:16,048
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT.

273
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:20,853
IT'S GOING TO BE A FLEN DOUSE 

274
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,453
THIN

275
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:21,987
TREMENDOUS THING FOR THE 

276
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,389
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

277
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,289
IT'S GOING TO BE FABULOUS FOR 

278
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:25,624
THE ECONOMY.

279
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,192
IT'S GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM 

280
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,861
LEAVING OUR SHORES AND OPENING 

281
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,563
UP IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

282
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,200
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SENSE TO DO

283
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,934
THAT.

284
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,268
YOU DO THAT AND I DON'T THINK 

285
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,670
YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING YOUR 

286
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,838
COMPANY VERY WELL.

287
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,139
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE 

288
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,974
GOING TO SIGN THIS.

289
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,643
THIS IS A LITTLE PICTURE OF IT.

290
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,613
IT FITS NICELY IN THE BOX.

291
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,414
I SAID TAKE IT OUT OF BOX 

292
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,050
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE.

293
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,552
ALL OF THIS -- EVERYTHING IN 

294
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,655
HERE IS REALLY TREMENDOUS THINGS

295
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,024
FOR BUSINESSES, FOR PEOPLE, FOR 

296
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,393
THE MIDDLE CLASS, FOR WORKERS.

297
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:02,794
I CONSIDER THIS VERY MUCH A BILL

298
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,930
FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND A BILL 

299
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,398
FOR JOBS.

300
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,100
JOBS ARE PRODUCED THROUGH 

301
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,235
COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS.

302
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,003
YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING.

303
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,738
CORPORATIONS ARE LITERALLY GOING

304
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,440
WILD OVER THIS.

305
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,710
I THINK EVEN BEYOND MY 

306
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,712
EXPECTATIONS, SO FAR BEYOND MY 

307
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,045
EXPECTATIONS.

308
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,348
I'LL SIGN THIS TODAY RATHER THAN

309
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,618
HAVING A BIG FORMAL CEREMONY IN 

310
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,386
TWO WEEKS WHEN WE WERE GOING TO 

311
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,187
DO IT.

312
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,623
I DIDN'T WANT YOU FOLKS TO SAY I

313
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,924
WASN'T KEEPING MY PROMISE.

314
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,592
I'M KEEPING MY PROMISE AND 

315
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,027
SIGNING IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

316
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,395
I SAID THE BILL WOULD BE ON MY 

317
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,330
DESK BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

318
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,466
YOU ARE HOLDING ME LITERALLY TO 

319
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:40,699
THAT.

320
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,135
WE DID A RUSH JOB TODAY.

321
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,504
IT'S NOT FANCY.

322
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,939
BUT IT'S THE OVAL OFFICE.

323
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,340
IT'S THE GREAT OVAL OFFICE.

324
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,175
JUST TO CONCLUDE OUR COUNTRY IS 

325
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,143
DOING VERY WELL.

326
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,580
WE TREMENDOUSLY CUT REGULATIONS.

327
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,249
LEGISLATIVE APPROVALS FOR WHICH 

328
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,185
I'M GIVEN NO CREDIT IN THE 

329
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:02,587
MAINSTREAM MEDIA WE BELIEVE I 

330
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,291
HAVE 88 WHICH IS NUMBER ONE.

331
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:12,431
SECOND NOW IS HARRY TRUMAN, A 

332
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,465
RECORD LONG HELD.

333
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,968
WE BEAT HIM ON LEGISLATIVE 

334
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,469
APPROVALS FOR WHICH I GET NO 

335
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:17,937
CREDIT.

336
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,138
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY HE NEEDED 

337
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:21,807
THIS BECAUSE HE'S HAD NO 

338
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,808
LEGISLATIVE APPROVALS.

339
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:26,145
IF YOU LOOK AT VA ACCOUNTABILITY

340
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,746
ACT AND SO MANY OTHER BILLS 

341
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,682
HAVING TO DO WITH THE VA, HAVING

342
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,184
TO DO WITH MILITARY AND MANY 

343
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,986
THINGS, WE HAVE MORE LEGISLATIVE

344
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,487
VICTORIES THAN ANY OTHER 

345
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,423
PRESIDENT, NOT INCLUDING THIS.

346
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,958
THIS IS THE CAPPER.

347
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,894
THIS IS AGAIN, THE BIGGEST TAX 

348
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,264
CUT, BIGGEST REFORM OF ALL TIME.

349
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,965
IT'S AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH 

350
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:50,035
US AND WE WILL SIGN THIS RIGHT 

351
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,336
NOW.

352
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,004
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD

353
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,139
OF, GREAT FOR OUR COUNTRY.

354
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,108
GREAT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

355
00:12:56,108 --> 00:13:09,788
THANK YOU ALL.

356
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,624
SO WE WON'T DO THE WHOLE THING.

357
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,993
THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT IT IS.

358
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:21,967
THAT'S YOUR BILL.

359
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,305
AND I WANT TO THANK SOME PEOPLE 

360
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,873
IN PARTICULAR THAT AREN'T HERE 

361
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:32,144
BECAUSE AGAIN WE EXPECTED A 

362
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,047
FORMAL CEREMONY IN TWO WEEKS.

363
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,081
MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN 

364
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:36,515
FANTASTIC.

365
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,383
WORKED SO HARD.

366
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,317
WE WOULD SPEAK AT 3:00 IN THE 

367
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,019
MORNING AND 2:00 IN THE MORNING 

368
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:46,658
AND WE WOULD SPEAK WHENEVER WE 

369
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,527
HAD TO SIPEAK.

370
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,195
THE EXACT SAME THING CAN BE SAID

371
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,363
OF PAUL RYAN.

372
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,165
THEY ARE VERY PROUD OF THIS.

373
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,733
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE 

374
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:54,966
RESULTS.

375
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,902
AS I SAID LONG AHEAD OF 

376
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,736
SCHEDULE.

377
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,605
PAUL RYAN, MITCH McCONNELL THANK

378
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,408

379
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,343
ORRIN HATCH THE CHAIRMAN MADE A 

380
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,844
BEAUTIFUL SPEECH THE OTHER DAY 

381
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,513
IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 

382
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,350
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, BEAUTIFUL 

383
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:11,583
SPEECH.

384
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,888
WE APPRECIATED IT.

385
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,259
KEVIN BRADY I DON'T THINK HE 

386
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:20,793
SLEPT.

387
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:26,865
MIKE ENZI, DIANE BLACK, ROB 

388
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,098
PORTMAN.

389
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,934
ROB WORKED SO HARD.

390
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,304
SO KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE SUBJECT.

391
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,641
PAT TOOMEY, JOHN, THESE PEOPLE 

392
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,543
WORKED SO HARD.

393
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,678
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GIVEN 

394
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,347
THE PROPER CREDIT.

395
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,351
THE WHOLE SENATE, UNFORTUNATELY 

396
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,819
THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE.

397
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,354
DEMOCRATS DON'T LIKE TAX CUTS.

398
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,289
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.

399
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,224
THEY DON'T WANT TO LOWER YOUR 

400
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:52,624
TAXES.

401
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,593
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES 

402
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,661
AND SPEND MONEY FOOLISHLY ON 

403
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,264
THINGS WE DON'T NEED IN MANY 

404
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,899
CASES.

405
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,968
SO WE'RE CUTTING TAXES.

406
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,736
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 

407
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,138
MILITARY AND TAKING CARE OF 

408
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:06,505
PEOPLE.

409
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,540
WE'RE REALLY DOING A JOB ON 

410
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:08,807
JOBS.

411
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,742
THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN SO 

412
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,411
FANTASTIC THAT I HAD TO CALL 

413
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,512
THEM OUT.

414
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,214
PLENTY OF OTHERS.

415
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,882
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND 

416
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:17,549
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE 

417
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,218
BEEN INCREDIBLE.

418
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,452
THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.

419
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:21,620
WE HAD IT.

420
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,322
IT WAS ALL SET TO GO.

421
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,357
AS SOON AS I GOT BACK FROM 

422
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,960
CHRISTMAS WE'LL BE WORKING IN 

423
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,293
FLORIDA.

424
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,395
I'LL BE WORKING DURING HARD 

425
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,262
DURING CHRISTMAS.

426
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,898
WE HAVE MANY THINGS WE'RE 

427
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,167
TALKING ABOUT INCLUDING NORTH 

428
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,136
KOREA, INCLUDING A LOT OF THINGS

429
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,037
HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS 

430
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,105
YOU KNOW.

431
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,541
WE'VE MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN

432
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,143
SYRIA WITH ISIS.

433
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,712
WE'VE TAKEN BACK VIRTUALLY ALL 

434
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:48,680
OF THE LAND.

435
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,282
SAME THING IN IRAQ.

436
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,684
WE'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS STRIDES.

437
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:56,054
IT'S THE UNWRITTEN STORY RIGHT 

438
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:56,221
NOW.

439
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,424
SINCE MIP SPEECH ON AFGHANISTAN 

440
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:03,028
WE'RE MAKING TREMENDOUS STRIDES.

441
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,297
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD IN 

442
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:05,597
AFGHANISTAN.

443
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,831
I'LL BE WORKING VERY HARD OVER 

444
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,000
THE HOLIDAYS.

445
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,270
I WANT TO WISH YOU A VERY MERRY 

446
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,537
CHRISTMAS.

447
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,073
I HAVE SOME BEAUTIFUL PENS OVER 

448
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:14,473
HERE.

449
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,608
BECAUSE ALL THESE FOLKS ARE 

450
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,076
EITHER CONTINUING TO WORK DOWN 

451
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,278
THE ROAD OR GETTING READY TO 

452
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,080
LEAVE AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE 

453
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,982
WORKING VERY HARD ALSO, I THINK 

454
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,550
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO HANDSOME 

455
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,119
OF THEM TO THE PRESS.

456
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,221
WOULD ANY OF THE MEDIA LIKE -- 

457
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,989
LOOK AT THESE CAMERA GUYS.

458
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:34,760
I THINK WE'LL DO THAT.

459
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,062
WE HAVE THEM.

460
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,730
MANY OF YOU HAVE WORKED VERY 

461
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,633
HARD AND MANY OF YOU HAVE WORKED

462
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,669
VERY, VERY FAIRLY.

463
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,139
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

464
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,907
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, CAN 

465
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:52,177
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU'LL 

466
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,146
TRAVEL TO SELL THIS?

467
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,881
>> I DON'T THINK I'LL HAVE TO 

468
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,851
TRAVEL TOO MUCH TO SELL IT.

469
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,319
IT'S SELLING ITSELF.

470
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,488
YOU'LL SEE ON FEBRUARY 1st WHEN 

471
00:17:03,488 --> 00:17:03,988
THEY OPEN THE PAYCHECK.

472
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,290
THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE IT.

473
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,895
BY SIGNING IT NOW IT KICKS IN.

474
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,631
IF WE DIDN'T MAKE A CERTAIN DATE

475
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,099
IT WOULDN'T KICK IN UNTIL THE 

476
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,803
FOE LOWING YEAR 2019.

477
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,839
I WASN'T HAPPY WITH THAT.

478
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,308
EVEN LANGUAGE SAID THE CORPORATE

479
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,011
WOULD KICK IN IN' 19.

480
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,079
WE DIDN'T DO THAT.

481
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,279
I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE TO DO 

482
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,548
MUCH SELLING.

483
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,716
I THINK THE CORPORATIONS GIVING 

484
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:34,786
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AWAY TO 

485
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,221
THEIR WORKERS AND MANY MORE ARE 

486
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,990
COMING I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 

487
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,059
SELLING THIS BETTER THAN I 

488
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:41,326
COULD.

489
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,227
I THINK COME FEBRUARY WHEN THEY 

490
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,997
OPEN THEIR CHECKS AND SEE I HAVE

491
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,465
A LOT MORE MONEY IN HERE THAT'S 

492
00:17:47,465 --> 00:17:48,634
GOING TO BE SOMETHING VERY 

493
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:48,867
SPECIAL.

494
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,135
HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY.

495
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,604
SOME OF YOU FOLKS TAKE -- IN 

496
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,439
PARTICULAR I LIKE THE BOOM 

497
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:54,873
HOLDERS.

498
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,241
THEY WERE SO NICE TO ME THE 

499
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:01,546
OTHER DAY AND THE CAMERA DAY. 

500
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:04,116
>> THANKS EVERYONE.

501
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,350
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

502
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,820
>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WILL 

503
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,323
REALLY REGRET -- THE DEMOCRATS 

504
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,457
ALREADY REGRET IT.

505
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:13,725
THEY HAVE THEIR TYPICAL THING 

506
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,793
IT'S FOR THE RICH.

507
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,695
THEY KNOW IT'S NOT TRUE.

508
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,831
THEY'VE BEEN CALLED OUT ON IT BY

509
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:22,301
THE MEDIA.

510
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,536
THEY WANTED TO BE A PART OF IT.

511
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,171
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

512
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,707
I REALLY BELIEVE -- I SAID ON 

513
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:29,907
SOCIAL MEDIA I BELIEVE WE'LL 

514
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:32,844
HAVE A LOTS OF BIPARTISAN WORK 

515
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:33,679
DONE.

516
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,081
MAYBE WE START WITH 

517
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,149
INFRASTRUCTURE.

518
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,986
I BELIEVE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE 

519
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,386
BIPARTISAN.

520
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,421
WE'VE SPENT $7 TRILLION IN THE 

521
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:44,689
MIDDLE EAST NOT TO MENTION ALL 

522
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:46,525
THE LIVES AND HEART ACHE.

523
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,859
IT'S SO SAD.

524
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:48,660
$7 TRILLION.

525
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,596
IT'S TIME TO REBUILD OUR 

526
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:50,896
COUNTRY.

527
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:57,636
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY.

528
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,873
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, EVERYBODY. 

529
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:07,879
>> EVERYONE IT'S TIME TO GO.

530
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,047
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK IF YOU

531
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,651
WOULD HAVE STARTED WITH 

532
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,452
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD HAVE 

533
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,887
BEEN HAD THINGS DONE 

534
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:16,421
DIFFERENTLY?

535
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,790
>> WE'RE GOING TO START ON 

536
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,025
INFRASTRUCTURE.

537
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,127
WE ESSENTIALLY REPEALED 

538
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,095
OBAMACARE.

539
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,197
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS A BIG 

540
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:25,897
DEAL.

541
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,633
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BY FAR THE 

542
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:27,866
EASIEST.

543
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,768
PEOPLE WANT IT, REPUBLICANS AND 

544
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,235
DEMOCRATS.

545
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,270
WE'LL HAVE TREMENDOUS DEMOCRAT 

546
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,472
SUPPORT ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

547
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,240
I COULD HAVE STARTED WITH 

548
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,607
INFRASTRUCTURE.

549
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,075
I ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAVE THE 

550
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,944
EASY ONE FOR THE ONE DOWN THE 

551
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:39,544
ROAD.

552
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:43,215
WE'LL BE HAVING THAT DONE PRETTY

553
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:43,482
QUICKLY.

554
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,484
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

555
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:51,657
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

556
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,158
>> Reporter: IS THERE ANYTHING 

557
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,028
IN THIS PROCESS YOU LEARNED?

558
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,030
>> I THINK I REALLY HAVE.

559
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,465
I GOT TO KNOW AND BECAME 

560
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,733
FRIENDLY WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE 

561
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,168
HOUSE, PEOPLE IN THE SENATE, 

562
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,370
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

563
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,307
WHEN I CAME I DIDN'T KNOW TOO 

564
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:08,774
MANY.

565
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,676
I WAS POLITICALLY ACTIVE, BUT I 

566
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,645
DIDN'T KNOW TOO MANY.

567
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,180
I THINK THE FACT I'VE BECOME 

568
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,015
FRIENDS WITH SOME MANY OF THE 

569
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:22,821
NAMES I READ AND SO MANY 

570
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,022
REPUBLICANS.

571
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:24,822
I CAN 

572
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:25,390
I CAN CALL ANY OF THEM.

573
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,959
I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS WELL.

574
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,327
IT'S BEEN A GREAT PROCESS.

575
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:32,430
I DO BELIEVE THAT THE FACT THAT 

576
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,600
I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW SO MANY OF

577
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,602
THESE PEOPLE -- MANY OF THESE 

578
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:40,338
PEOPLE I HAVE TO SAY, NOT ALL, 

579
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:42,340
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE GREAT 

580
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,377
PEOPLE THAT TRULY LOVE THIS 

581
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:45,610
COUNTRY.

582
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,978
I THINK THAT HELPS.

583
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:50,649
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THIS 

584
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:50,949
LEGISLATION.

585
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,386
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

586
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,420
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

587
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,155
>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING MAYBE ONE

588
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,490
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS SO

589
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,325
FAR IN THIS PRESIDENCY.

590
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,893
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING THAT TAX

591
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,364
BILL, THE $1.5 TRILLION TAX

00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:05,764
OVERHAUL.

593
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,799
A COMPLETE REWRITE OF OUR 

594
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,066
SYSTEM.

595
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,201
A LAW THAT WILL NOW LIKELY 

596
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,604
AFFECT EVERY SINGLE TAX PAYER 

597
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,338
ACROSS AMERICA.

598
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,206
THIS WAS MOMENTS AGO INSIDE THE 

599
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:15,640
OVAL OFFICE.

600
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,941
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOKE UP 

601
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,309
THIS MORNING AND WATCHED THE 

602
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:20,111
NEWS AND HE WAS WONDERING IF HE 

603
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,080
WAS GOING TO SIGN THIS BILL 

604
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,882
BEFORE CHRISTMAS AS HE PROMISED.

605
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,717
HE SAID REPORTERS WERE ASKING 

606
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,385
THE QUESTION.

607
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,086
HE SAID HE DECIDED TO DO IT AT 

608
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:30,422
THE LAST MINUTE.

609
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,358
HE SPOKE FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES 

610
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,593
TOUTING HOW GREAT THE BILL WAS 

611
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:39,231
HOW IT WAS GOING TO CUT TAXES.

612
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,065
DEMOCRATS POINTING OUT IT WILL 

613
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:43,668
CUT TAXES FOR WEALTHY AND BIG 

614
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:44,102
BUSINESS.

615
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,905
THE PRESIDENT IN A GIVING SPIRIT

616
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:49,474
GIVING PENS OUT TO HIS FRIENDS 

617
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,578

00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,480
WORDS OUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

619
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,549
HE SAID THE BILL IS POPULAR.

620
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:00,152
I WANT TO BRING IN MARY BRUCE.

621
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,721
MARY, YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS.

622
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,655
RIGHT NOW THIS BILL THAT IS THE 

623
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,992
LAW, IT HAS BEEN POPULAR WITH

624
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,393
AMERICANS SO FAR. 

625
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,095
>> THIS BILL IS DEEPLY 

626
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:10,996
UNPOPULAR.

627
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,430
REPUBLICANS INSIST IT WILL BE 

628
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,367
ONCE AMERICANS START TO FEEL THE

629
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,902
IMPACTS OF THE BILL IN THEIR 

630
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,135
WALLET.

631
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,502
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT INSIST 

632
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:23,241
THEY WON'T HAVE TO SELL THIS 

633
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,042
BILL.

634
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,743
THERE'S NO QUESTION REPUBLICANS 

635
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:28,980
HAVE A LONG ROAD TO GO AS THEY 

636
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,949
TRY TO TERRAIN THIS LEGISLATIVE 

637
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,451
WIN INTO A POLITICAL WIN 

638
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:36,054
ESPECIALLY HEADING INTO 

639
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:36,321
MIDTERMS.

640
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,156
THE BILL IS PREDICTED TO ADD 

641
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,523
QUITE A LOT 0 THE DEFICIT.

642
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:42,627
AS YOU MENTIONED EXPERTS CAUTION

643
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,663
WHILE THE REPUBLICANS INSIST THE

644
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,564
BENEFITS GO TO THE MIDDLE CLASS 

645
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:49,601
IT APPEARS FROM ANALYSIS THE 

646
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,803
ULTRA RICH MAY BENEFIT MOST.

647
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,104
REPUBLICANS I TALKED WITH KNOW 

648
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:55,507
THEY HAVE TO SELL THIS PLAN.

649
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,075
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE AMERICANS

650
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,143
AS THEY START TO SEE SOME 

651
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:00,946
CHANGES THAT THAT ATTRIBUTE THAT

652
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,448
TO REPUBLICANS AS THEY TRY TO 

653
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,050
GET A LEGISLATIVE WIN HERE.

654
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,018
SOME AMERICANS COULD BEGIN TO 

655
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,254
SEE MORE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS 

656
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,022
STARTING IN FEBRUARY WHEN LESS 

657
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,792
MONEY IS WITHHELD FROM THEIR 

658
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,059
PAYCHECKS.

659
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,397
MOST IMPACTS WON'T BE FELT UNTIL

660
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,465
YOU FILE YOUR 2018 TAX RETURNS. 

661
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,300
>> HE WANTED TO BUILD BRIDGES 

662
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,637
WITH MITCH McCONNELL AND SPEAKER

663
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:26,638
PAUL RYAN.

664
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,573
HE'S HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP 

665
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,009
WITH MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY.

666
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,510
IT WAS ROUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF

667
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,479
HIS PRESIDENCY WHEN HE WAS 

668
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,181
TRYING TO PASS HEALTH CARE 

669
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,282
REFORM.

670
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,750
CLEARLY THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE 

671
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,285
VICTORY FOR REPUBLICANS AND THE 

672
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:40,619
PRESIDENT.

673
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,120
THIS WILL BECOME AN ISSUE AND 

674
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,422
SOMETHING THEY WANT TO CAMPAIGN 

675
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,591
ONGOING INTO THE MIDTERM

>> ABSOLUTELY.

678
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,229
ROCKY TO SAY THE LEAST.

679
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:56,134
THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN FRAUT 

680
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,971
OVER THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE 

681
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:00,304
PRESIDENCY.

682
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:01,940

BE GOOD FOR THEM.

694

MOST AMERICANS WILL GET A TAX 

695
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:22,894
CUT AT FIRST.
