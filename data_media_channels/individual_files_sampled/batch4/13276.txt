with the President and Congress off on vacation this is a good time to take stock and make some predictions about what's going to happen next of course no one knows the future and so predictions are always meaningless and usually incorrect but why should this political commentary show be any different than the rest of them the big question facing us immediately is whether the new chief of staff former General John Kelly will be able to bring order to the White House I believe Kelley will solve the problem of Oval Office chaos by taking some very simple steps like instituting a strict appointment schedule keeping the office door closed during meetings and shooting the President of the United States with a tranquilizer dart after the president loses consciousness Kelley will chain his enormous body inside a crate and ship into Manhattan where he'll be put on display as Trump the eighth wonder of the world Trump however will recover from the tranquilizers burst from his chains and climb to the top of the Empire State Building clutching a beautiful young woman by the crotch as biplanes circle the gigantic president firing machine guns at him Trump will swap the planes away like flies and manage to send out a tweet unleashing a nuclear strike on wolf blitzer meanwhile back in DC special counsel robert muller and his crack staff of democrat donors will come up with the bright idea of trying to unseat a duly elected president by indicted his compatriots for the sort of trivial malfeasance that hillary clinton usually pulls off between felonies paranoid talk-show host alex jones will declare that this is a coup by the deep state the deep state will respond by declaring that jones doesn't have a government license who expresses opinion and will therefore have to pay a fine of $5,000 a day until he obtains a license by leaving a paper bag full of cash in the men's room of the Starbucks nearest FBI headquarters furious at the deep state coup Trump voters will rise up to protect the president whereupon Democrats will suddenly realize Trump voters own most of the guns in the country and that may be trying to unseat their president for no reason wasn't such a brainy idea panicked by the rebellion that Democrats will call the military and will receive a recorded message saying that the military isn't in right now because it's out protecting the president from the deep state at this point Nancy Pelosi will announce that when she recently said she would never resign she actually meant she had resigned six months ago and was now living with a 27 year old psychiatric nurse named Lance in the sprightly European principality of liechtenstein finally summer vacation will end Trump and Congress will return to Washington Trump will go back to appointing conservative judges and cutting regulations and congressmen will go back to bravely facing down political pressure by fulfilling their seven-year promise to repeal Obamacare okay forget that last prediction satire is one thing but there's no point in being absurd trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
