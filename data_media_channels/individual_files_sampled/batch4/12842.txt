no but we will we'll find out I think pretty soon Sun Monday the Senate Judiciary Committee Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham sent a letter to former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice and they asked her to explain an email that she actually sent to herself on the last day of the Obama administration so January 20th they're all getting ready to go the inauguration and Susan Rice is at her keyboard typing out an email to Susan Rice what exactly is in this email well it explained that President Obama had held a briefing on January 5th regarding a supposed trump brush of collusion so according to the letter from Grassley and Graham - rice says if the time stamp is correct you sent this email to yourself at 12:15 p.m. presumably a very short time before he departed the White House for the last time in this email to yourself you purport to documents a meeting that had taken place more than two weeks before On January 5th 2017 it's like the last minute she's in the White House she's sending herself an email about a meeting that was held in the White House between James Comey the the then FBI director the Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates both of these people have been fired or gone from the Trump administration Vice President Biden was present and Susan Rice was president and President Obama was present so what actually happened at this meeting according to the email that Susan Rice sent to Susan Rice says this quote on January 5th following a briefing by I see leadership intelligence community leadership on Russian hacking during the 2016 presidential election President Obama had a brief follow-on conversation with FBI director Jim Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in the Oval Office Vice President Biden and I were also present President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the intelligence and law enforcement communities quote unquote by the book the president stressed he is not asking about initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective he reiterated there are lawn foresman team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book that's twice she says by the book from a national security perspective however President Obama said he wants to be sure that as we engage with the incoming team we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia the president asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team and Comey said that he would so they're a bunch of things about this email that Rice sent to Rice that should be disturbing first of all why was she sending a memo to herself the only reason that you send a memo to yourself legally speaking as a lawyer the only reason you do that is to create a paper trail so she wanted a paper trail suggesting that this meeting was totally hunky-dory which is why it says twice in the email that this was all happening quote/unquote by the book that in and of itself is suspicious second how exactly would Obama have planned to prevent the intelligence community from handing over information to the incoming commander in chief I mean that's disturbing stuff we talked about violation of presidential norms well one of the presidential norms is not just norms what is the law is that when the chief executive comes in when the commander-in-chief enters he now has access to all the classified materials but here is Obama saying to Comey tell me what I should not tell the President of the United States the president-elect of the United States tell me what I should not tell him the implication being that the outgoing administration was going to hide information about the incoming administration from the incoming administration with regard to quote-unquote Trump Russia collusion reg Trump has full constitutional power over the executive branch including the IC but Obama said you might want to prevent the full sharing of information regarding Russia I mean talking about violation of North shift the names here and then imagine the fallout imagine that George W Bush in the last days of his administration had had into his office the heads of his intelligence community and Vice President Cheney and he said to them listen I'm very suspicious of this Obama guy it seems like he has a lot of conflicting feelings about the United States what if we just don't give him all the information what if we just keep that hidden people would say well that's insane I mean he's the president-elect of the United States you can't do that the President of the United States has owed this information and yet that's apparently exactly what Obama was talking about third Obama said he didn't want to interfere with anything from a law enforcement perspective but how about from an intelligence-gathering perspective so Andy McCarthy over at National Review has been aces on this he says since the beginning there's been a major distinction people have missed between the Muller investigation as a counterintelligence investigation and the Muller investigation as a criminal investigation these are not the same thing a counterintelligence investigation is an investigation where you're attempting to determine if someone's trying to influence our elections if somebody in the United States is maybe working with those people but it is not a criminal investigation in the sense that you need to gather evidence for possible prosecution well Obama seems to be making the same distinction he's not saying we're gonna prosecute anyone from the Trump administration he is saying that we're in the middle of a counterintelligence investigation and maybe that means that we shouldn't hand over information to Trump so Grassley and Graham asked a series of questions that do deserve answers from Susan Rice she's not famous for giving forthright answers to certain questions some of these questions why did Rice send the email in the first place when was she aware of the Trump Russia collusion investigation because if this meeting was about the Trump Russia collusion investigation they were using that as an excuse not to hand over information to Trump and team that's a problem and was Susan Rice aware of the FISA warrants on Carter page was the Obama administration using a thin a thinly obtained FISA warrant on kyra page in order to target the Trump administration for future for future curbs on their intelligence gathering did Co me or Yates mention any media coverage of the Steele dossier was Susan Rice aware of the Steele dossier were there any more meetings of this sort you know we don't know the answers to any of these questions but we better get the answers to some of these questions because this is a violation of serious norms we keep hearing over and over again then the Trump administration has breached on this is not normal we hear that all the time and listen I'm the first to say when I think something that is not normal is going on I don't think that it's normal to have this level of turnover in the White House in the first year I don't think that it's normal the President of the United States to say what he said after charlottesville not for him to suggest that he doesn't want Haitian immigrants I don't think that it's normal for the presidents of the United States making excuses for an alleged child molester in Alabama or for him to suggest that a guy on his own staff who's there's evidence of wife-beating that that guy says he's innocent and therefore met right I don't think that any of that is normal but if we're gonna talk about breaches of normality that actually go to the heart of the system this is one of them for all the talk about Trump being the incipient tyrant the hit layering and figure who is going to come in and overthrow all constitutional boundaries just destroy the constant and piece by piece that's not what's happened the normans that trump has destroyed have been norms of behavior that's bad right but stuff that I don't like because a lot of those norms I think are good but if you're talking about who perverted institutions the Obama administration perverted institutions far more than the Trump administration has I mean this is the Obama administration had an attorney general who now us to talk about running for president who called himself the President of the United States his wingman the Obama administration militarized the IRS for use against conservative nonprofits the IRS had to apologise for that just in recent months the Obama administration used the HHS as a center of corruption under Kathleen Sebelius the Obama administration was utilizing the FBI in order to let Hillary Clinton off the hook right the Obama administration corrupted institution after institution so when we talk about violation of norms that's where we should start you know everybody's focused on on the shiny object of the silliness of some of the stuff happening inside the Trump administration when we talk about norms that have been destroyed and violated that's that's not begin with Trump Trump is a response to violation of norms and the American public's had fine you want to violate some norms we will violate all norms how about that and ironically the norms that have been reinstated are those constitutional checks and balances the norms that have been broken are the cultural taboos that in many cases probably should have stood in the first place and none of that is good now in this in a few minutes I'm gonna talk about some of the norms that have been violated by the Trump administration and one that has not been violated but the media are looking for an excuse to say that that has been violated but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at LegalZoom so

special savings as well okay so the media while they they haven't been focusing on the violation of institutional norms by the Obama administration they're focusing in on supposed breaches of protocol by the Trump administration well some of those breaches are actual breaches like why was Omarosa working in the Trump administration so Omarosa Manigault was on the apprentice fired three times and then Trump hired her for the White House and then fired her again and now she's on Celebrity Big Brother where apparently there are rumors that she was slipping out of her robe I haven't actually watched the show so and now I have no desire to do so but amarosa actually on the show last night she ripped into Mike Pence could I just say this as bad as I think Trump you would be worried about pence everybody that's wishing for their life we would be begging for days of Trump back if pence became president that's all okay the violation of norms that went on here is why in the hell was this woman anywhere near power she was a celebrity reality TV contestant and then she was ousted and now she's back on Celebrity reality TV I mean there's a hell of a career arc to go from reality TV to the White House and back to reality TV just spectacular but is that violation of presidential norms severely damaging to the United States in the same way as say a prior administration refusing to hand over intelligence data I don't think so and the media have been attempting to spot violations of norms in every nook and cranny every everywhere there are violations of norton's this is not normal this is what they're constantly saying so yesterday for example they decided to jump on Jeff Sessions the Attorney General Attorney General Sessions I think has overall been doing a fine job and attorney General Sessions was giving a speech about the sheriff's office and here's what he had to say since our founding they independently elected sheriff has been the people's protector who keeps law enforcement close to and accountable to people through the elective process the office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo American heritage of law enforcement okay so everyone everyone jumped on that phrase the Anglo American heritage of law enforcement oh he's saying white people ooh controversy he's saying white people brian schatz the idiotic senator from Hawaii IQ of seven he says do you know anyone who's has Anglo American heritage in a sentence what could possibly be the purpose of saying that other than to pit americans against each other for the chief law enforcement officer to use a dog whistle like that is appalling best no vote I ever cast okay this is as Charles Cook says over a national review politely this is this is moronic okay this is idiotic the Anglo American heritage of law enforcement and the Anglo American heritage of America's legal system has been commented on by virtually every president it springs all the way back to you globally back to William Blackstone which was used as the basis for a lot of American law and British common law was the basis for a lot of American law here's senator here senator Obama in 2006 before who's president talk about habeas corpus quote I sincerely hope we can protect what has been called the great a right that has been in place in the anglo-american legal system for over 700 years clearly Barack Obama was a racist in 2008 during the campaign quote calling it the foundation of anglo-american law he said that the principle of habeas corpus says very simply if the government grabs you you have the right to at least ask why was I grabbed right so again talking about the anglo-american law and then there was President Obama saying quote the Obama would not say whether it could be achieved within the first hundred days of his term citing the challenge of creating a balanced process that it here's the rule of law habeas corpus basic principles of anglo-american legal system how dare Jeff Sessions how dare Jeff Sessions this is what I'm saying about why people don't trust the media okay when you guys go looking for reasons you say this is not normal about Trump but then you completely ignore this is not normal about Democrats then we start to think that maybe just maybe you have a little bit of bias speaking of bias and normalization of terrible behavior okay a top DNC official keith Ellison dined with Louis Farrakhan and the President of Iran in 2013 it is according to Fox News Democratic National Committee Deputy Chair Keith Ellison who is an anti-semite raging anti-semite attended a private dinner hosted by Iranian president Hassan rouhani in 2013 along with the head of the black nationalist group Nation of Islam Louis Farrakhan you'll remember that this guy was endorsed by Chuck Schumer to become head of the DNC you'll also remember that he said at the time that he had completely cut ties with Louis Farrakhan yet there he was in 2013 having dinner with the president of a genocide 'el anti Jewish state in Iran and the head of the Nation of Islam the anti-semite Louis Farrakhan Ellison also visited with Farrakhan again in 2015 Ellison attended the 2013 general with two other members of the CBC the Congressional Black Caucus representatives Andre Carson Democrat from Indiana and Gregory Meeks Democrat from New York rouhani invited Muslim leaders from around the United States to dinner after addressing the UN General Assembly and the Nation of Islam website confirmed the attendance of Louis Farrakhan and then there are articles at the Nation of Islam publication confirming Ellison there with photos of Ellison Ellison and Farrakhan at the table right after the guests were hosted at a dinner the Iranian president answered and engaged in warm discussion with guests including Democratic congressman Greg Meeks of New York keith Ellison of Minnesota who is a Muslim and this is what final call wrote or not / second 2013 this of course is not the first time Allison has been associated with Louis Farrakhan I Wilson attended the Million Man March in 1995 and publicly defended Farrakhan years ago even after Farrakhan made a bunch of anti-semitic remarks and called Jews satanic hey Farrakhan slammed Ellison in 2015 after Ellison tried to distance himself from Farrakhan but this is what's truly amazing the media are willing to go crazy over Jeff session saying anglo-american which is totally fine right totally fine Barak Obama said it there's nothing wrong with saying anglo-american law enforcement heritage the the office of Sheriff is a is a is an actual concha it's an actual smashing together of two terms from British common law Shire and Reeve right Shire and Reeve Sheriff can that's where it comes from of course it's a feature of anglo-american law that is something the media have to comment on that's something we have to be deeply concerned about is that it was coded white people language when it comes to actual Democrats dining with actual terrorist leaders and actual anti-semites nothing not a word we all have to pretend that keith Ellison is totally normal we have to pretend that keith Ellison is just a normal part of American politics this is not normal you don't talk about this is not normal that is not normal that is not normal now speaking of not normal the media continued to fawn over North Korea because North Korean sister kim yo-jong i can't remember her last name young yo or her first name because in korean then the names are opposite western in any case now the the media continue to fawn over over north korea remember they were fawning over north korean cheerleaders it is worth noting that is an update to yesterday north korean cheerleaders have been sent to prison camps before according to vice news says after a 2005 performance 21 members of the cheerleading squad were sent to a prison camp after speaking out about what they saw in North Korea in South Korea critics say the army of beauties is an effort to hijack the games and spread propaganda which of course it is the head of propaganda is the sister who everybody was praising as just wonderful and glorious kim yo-jong is her name sorry that's the name of the the sister again and then the media continue to cover vice news doing something most of the media did not do there's some talk yesterday about the fact that Fox News gave even some flaunting coverage to the North Korean charm offensive the Breitbart did as well well we didn't hear it say Lee Weyer Nord we tolerate it because that's silly okay so just because whether it's right or left if you were if you were crediting the North Koreans with a wonderful PR push then number one you're demonstrating complete ignorance of the system in North Korea and South Korea you know the truth is that the South Korean government was going to portray all of this as fine and dandy because the South Korean government the recently elected government is called the sunshine government meaning that one of their stated purposes is to push the idea of a unified Korea with conciliation with the North Korean regime and it wouldn't matter what North Korea did I mean the sister could have come down and taken a dump on the president's table in South Korea and they were portrayed as some sort of great diplomatic coup the people of South Korea however are not happy with the North Koreans and they're not happy with the North Korean regime so all of the talk about this charm offensive are wildly overstated as speaking of media stupidity I'm gonna come into the fence of a woman named Barry Weiss Barry Weiss writes for The New York Times and she was shellac she's an opinion writer and staff editor she was she lacks because she did something terrible the NBC Olympics who covered a woman named Mariah I'm watching any of this I'm gonna mispronounce all the names Mariah ngoz ooh who's an American an American ice skater an American figure skater who was the first woman to land a first American woman to land a triple axel in competition and Barry Weiss tweeted out immigrants they got the job done and now she knows that mariah negocio is the daughter of immigrants she's not actually an intern she was born in the United States but her parents emigrated and she was just taken to the woodshed over this right she's an American citizen having been born to Japanese immigrants living in California the the the line there right there where she says immigrants they get the job done it's actually a reference to the musical Hamilton and Barry Weiss tweeted back her parents are immigrants the whole thing was a compliment I deeply resent the implication her tweet right somebody tweeted back at her was the poetic license in saying she looks Asian so she must be the immigrants despite being born in California no that's not what she was saying at all it's amazing the level of the level of anger the level of disdain for anyone suggesting that perhaps a child of immigrants is successful in the United States is just insane right he's Shaun Thorson so she's not white so she has to be an immigrant I mean and Barry White Barry Weis tweeted back wow this is utterly breathtaking in its bad faith her parents are immigrants and my tea was obviously meant to celebrate her accomplishments well yes perhaps you'd be more comfortable with an alo like Think Progress making the same point this is it's all true but people are so oversensitive now people are so crazy that they decide that Barry Weiss is the person who has to pay the price for all of this how dare Barry Weiss make a point about the children of immigrants doing really well in the United States hey this is how far left everybody's moved what utter utter insanity okay in just a few minutes in just a few seconds I'm going to talk about the continuing fallout from the Rob Porter scandal and what's going on inside the White House we're gonna talk a little bit about and then we will

fallout continues over at the white house over rob porter and you can see that the media are all over this largely because they think that this is a way to get Trump they they think that if they can get Trump to acknowledge that Rob Porter is probably guilty then they can get Trump to acknowledge that Trump is probably guilty of sexual harassment and sexual assault now what's the difference between Rob Porter and Donald Trump the difference is that everybody knew about all the allegations against Trump when he was elected I said this with regard to Roy Moore because people were comparing the two the difference here is that the allegations against Trump had been widely aired by the time of the election okay that doesn't excuse the vote if that if you think then he's an excuse but it does suggest that people took all of that into account when they made their binary choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump the same is not true for Rob Porter Rob Porter was supposed to be this clean-cut guy that everybody in the White House liked and trusted and then it comes out that he allegedly beat two of his ex-wives that comes out now people are suggesting that that's akin to Trump well whatever you think of Trump the American public have already judged whether they think Trump is guilty or innocent on the basis of the allegations that have already been aired if they're new allegations maybe that changes the math a little bit but the media are attempting to use Rob Porter to ensnare Trump Jim Acosta trying to do that on CNN last night it seems like the president was believing mr. Porter as opposed to his alleged victims why did the president tweet that over the weekend why is he seemingly defending mr. Porter publicly is it because he has based his own allegations is there some sensitivities or is that like why that is as I just said and I'll repeat it again the president in the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly he certainly supports the victims of domestic violence above all else and believes that they should everyone should be treated fairly and with due process the president simply saying that there should be a process that that should be followed and looked at is there just a being on the wrong side of things being on process okay so there's a cost of trying to grill sarah huckabee Sanders and the entire media was doing this yesterday doing the work of the Democrats as well Terry McAuliffe who obviously wants to run for president the the governor of Virginia he said that President Trump has no sympathy for victims of abuse obviously this president has more sympathy for domestic abusers than the victims of domestic abuse I mean it's just sad it's a continuing litany we've heard from this president and this is a very serious issue this is taxpayer-funded money being used to cover up domestic abuse in brock quarters domestic abuse absolutely okay bringing on Terry McAuliffe to talk about this is just absurd Terry McAuliffe was one of the clinton's biggest supporters and he was perfectly fine with everything bill clinton was doing to women and was alleged to have done to women again democrats are using this as a club against trump this is really less about protecting victims of domestic violence because we're not even talking about rob porter anymore are we we're not even talking about what happens to rob porter we're now talking about trump i rob port has been gone for part of a week right he's been gone for several days at this point but Rob Porter has faded into the background now we're gonna talk about Trump because this is a way to get Trump bring on Terry McAuliffe to talk about this is obviously a partisan exercise by members of the media kirsten gillibrand doing the same thing she says we should force Trump to resign and if not then Congress should hold him accountable on all this domestic violence of again not the allegations that Trump himself was involved in domestic violence but the allegations that his own staff didn't tell him the Rob Porter was alleged to have been involved in domestic violence yeah it's not clear that goes all the way up the chain of Trump from what I hear it absolutely does not anyway here's Kirsten Gillibrand the senator from New York a woman who spent most of her career defending Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton once President Trump was elected I think something changed and I think it changed for women do you think he'll be held accountable well and I mean I think he should resign and if he's unwilling to do that which is what I assume then Congress should hold him accountable we are obligated to have hearings I mean this is the same woman who Meghan McCain took part in two questions on the view simply by saying the name Clinton and Kirsten Gillibrand ran for the hills and this is the point if Democrats are hoping that they're gonna be able to win Congress win the Senate win the presidency simply by being anti Trump I don't think that's going to work it's all baked into the cake okay it's all baked in already I've made this clear with regard to Trump I think the Trump is a mud monster meaning that if you throw more mud at him it doesn't even show up everybody knows what Trump is at this point but Democrats are gonna continue beating this drum Chuck Schumer I think knows better right he's saying you can't just run against Trump he's not the only one by the way but our mistake I think you cannot just run against Donald Trump and it is the job of we Democrats to put together a strong cohesive economic group of proposals aimed at the middle class and those struggling to get okay but they're lazy so they're not gonna do that okay and they're even being encouraged by their own people they need to do they need to get away from bashing Trump full-time according to McClatchy today a leading Democratic group Priorities USA which is a vile group right there warning party leaders they could squander a strong political climate in 2018 if they don't start to emphasize pocketbook issues over loose and unfocused critiques of Donald Trump according to internal polling by the super PAC president Trump's approval rating climbed to 44 percent in the first week of February compared to 53 percent who disapprove that mirrors Trump's improving position in public polls in November the same survey found his approval rating at 40 percent with 54 percent disproving the group survey also showed the Democratic Party's generic ballot advantage had shrunk with 46 percent preferring Democrats to 42 percent for Republicans that's not going to be enough for Democrats to win back the house they need about a seven to ten point ballot advantage in the generic ballot if they even hope to win back the house the memo says that a broad range of metrics showed the political climate is still favorable for Democrats but it also makes an unambiguous diagnosis for Trump's recent rise Democrats this year have stopped focusing on economic and health care issues topics that demonstrable hurt his approval during his first year in office priorities polling found that while people in November readily mentioned Trump's health care and tax reform measures by February they were instead more of his tweets well one of the reasons for that is cuz Democrats can't argue healthcare Democrats can't argue the economy the economy is doing well and millions of people are not dying because of the reforms to Obamacare so all of the talk about that is gone by the wayside and they've fallen back on their secondary argument which is that President Trump is a garbage person right this is the why they're going after the Rob Porter scandal with alacrity what they should remember is that every time they attempt to get Trump with one of these sorts of scandals it fails a bleep whole gate was three weeks ago does anyone even remember that is that even a thing that happened or the stormy Daniels was like two weeks ago right the allegation the President of the United States had nailed the pornstar and then paid her off to shut up about it during the election cycle that lasted for like five minutes in the media they the idea that Democrats are gonna win back the House of Representatives simply by bashing Trump about Rob Porter is in a now does that excuse the behavior of the White House on reporter of course not I spent a lot of this week bashing and last week bashing the White House over their treatment of the Rob Porter situation obviously no one who was alleged to have done that stuff and was forbidden FBI clearance because of it shouldn't anywhere close to the Oval Office but if Democrats are hoping that they're just gonna be able to rail against Trump and this is somehow gonna drive people out of the polls not so much not so much from the memo according to Priorities USA they say there's no questions from benefits when a critique of his tax and health care policies is not front and center especially when voters are hearing Trump side of the story on the economy so fascinating Democrats are beginning to see that what they're doing is a problem but they can't stop themselves they're so addicted to Trump hates that they're they're having a really tough time breaking away from it they're gonna have a tough time moving away from from basing their entire their entire campaign on how much they dislike President Trump okay so in just a minute I want it's cus the most important thing happening today we haven't discussed it yet the most important thing happening today is of course black panther is coming out in two days and this has been true for several days the most important thing happening yesterday was that black panther was coming out in three the most important thing happening four days ago was the black panther would be

ever happened in the history of humanity or at least since Caitlyn Jenner became a woman a transgender woman and that of course is the release of Black Panther it is so deeply important it is we've heard is deeply important to millions of black americans who after all we're not liberated from slay every two hundred years ago and liberated by the civil rights movement with federal legislation and not been gradually restored to what always should have been full civil rights in the United States and none of that has mattered up till they made Marvel movie about a superhero who is black in a country filled with black people that is the real that's the change right blade was not enough Catwoman with Halle Berry no ok well Conda is where it is this is the most important moment in black American history not Martin Luther King not Frederick Douglass not the Civil War not the end of Jim Crow none of that not Brown vs. Board the most important thing is that chadwick boseman puts claws on his hands and a mask on his face and runs around jumping off cars in CGI fashion deeply deeply important black children everywhere will now believe that they too can be superheroes who jump off cars in fictional countries it's very important now you may sense that I'm mocking a little bit the reason I'm mocking a little bit is because I hate this kind of identity politics I think it's incredibly stupid I think it's incredibly stupid because again I grew up as an Orthodox Jewish kid where no American president has been Jewish and no American presidents been Orthodox Jew and yet I grew up on 1776 essentially worshiping the founding fathers none of whom were Jewish and yesterday my daughter actually is on on Shabbat am i sitting around my daughter and my daughter was talking about how she said what the president's cuz she's learning at the president about the presidents in preschool she's very politically active my daughter she's four years old and she knows many of the presidents she is familiar with the life stories of Abraham Lincoln in George Washington and she said daddy was George Washington Jewish and I said no he wasn't and she said it's not on Trump Jewish I said no he's not and she said have any of the president's been Jewish and I said no and she said why haven't any of the president's been Jewish and she's four so I didn't go into the full explanation but what I said is you know they just haven't been but maybe there'll be a Jewish president the future would you like to be President one day she said I don't know it sounds boring and so which i think is an astute observation on the part of my daughter but the point is this right if you're not telling your kids they can be anything in America you're doing something wrong as a parent and if you had to wait until black panther came out right we heard this about Barack Obama one who's elected to now that Obama has been president black Americans will feel like they too can be President formative moment and yet all we hear now is that America's deeply racist and black people are still systematical is systemically discriminated against and the black people are still victims in American society so it turned out didn't mean anything but Obama was president we were told to mend everything and then he was president for two terms right re-elected overwhelmingly and then it turns out it didn't mean anything because we needed a Chadwick Boseman to somehow make sure that black people felt accepted in American society because a bunch of white executives at Marvel greenlit a film about black people in a fictional country in Africa then the insanity that is attended Black Panthers it's crazy I'll see the movie this weekend I hope that it's good Simon to spend money on it so anything I spend money on I hope is good but you know I will give you an honest review of that I know that's been forbidden by the media there's actually a law that you're not allowed to give your opinion on black panther emily locked awawa i think summarizes the the feelings of a bunch of insane leftist white social justice warriors she tweeted this out yesterday and it's totally crazy she tweeted out quote so i carefully did not buy a black panther tickets for opening weekend because i did not want to be the white person sucking black joy out of the theater what's the appropriate date for me to buy tickets is next weekend okay I think the appropriate thing for Emily Locke de Walla to do is never to leave her home again or tweet I think these would be because honestly you never know when you're gonna offend someone just by your very presence like the necklace that she's wearing here I think it's ugly and it's it's ruining my white person joy today wait what kind of insanity is what does she think of black people like how how derogatory do you have to think of black people to think that if you're in a theater with a bunch of black people they're gonna think that white person sitting here in a theater watching a movie talk about how black people are awesome that's ruining my black joy first of all what is black joy and why is black joy different from white joy or different from home and joy for that matter I'm just I'm confused what what what are we even talking about here but the sensitivity police have gone so far that we now have to have fully segregated theaters to make sure that black people are not offended by the presence of white people according to Emily Locke de Walla now we actually have to segregate the theaters it's amazing I mean we could do the converse we could do the cut we did the converse for a couple hundred years in this country right the converse was black people don't be allowed into white people theaters because that will offend the white people and ruin their white joy this is stupid folks this is not only stupid it's counterproductive to the notion of a good and honest and free American society and then the New York Times has run a series of pieces this week these long pink pieces about Ryan Coogler film okay so they're there too that I spotted right off the bat one by Salim Isha Tillett I don't know who selling Misha till it is I guess someone Misha Tillett is well I guess they don't give this person's biography I don't know if this man or woman but the piece is called black panther brings hope hype and pride ah yeah and here's what it says it says I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight adapt or to cha wa the Prince of Wakanda says upon meeting Natasha Romanova aka the black widow and Captain America Civil War a few scenes later a recently orphaned and vengeful - Chava swapping his bespoke blue suit for a full-body bulletproof one reappears is a new Marvel movie superhero the prince will have to live with the attention even before it's February 16th released black panther smashed box-office records being out Captain America Civil War on first-date ticket advances and surpassing Batman vs Superman dawn of Justice to be gumming fandango's top-selling superhero movie in history great ok that's fine I mean sure I mean I hope the movies good but I do love this idea that you know this is this is some sort of amazing moment not since Spike Lee's Malcolm X has there been so much hype and mu I'd hoped for a movie among African American audiences from the special group outings planned by excited fans to crowdfunding campaigns to ensure children can see it black panther is shaping up to be a phenomenon in December a viral video of two african-american men excited to see the movie's poster with its all-star black cast this is what white people get to feel like all the time one man wrote on Twitter seemed to capture the anticipation garnering more than 2.5 million views a couple of things about this one Black Panther the superhero was crated by two Jewish guys then just FYI - this is not what white people feel like all the time white people don't go around thinking oh Captain America my favorite white superhero oh it's amazing Iron Man white superhero and if you think like this I would suggest that you might need to start thinking less tribally if you spend your life going around thinking oh my god I'll bet white people feel just like this every time they see Tom Cruise in a movie first of all do black people feel like that when they go see Denzel Washington in the movie I doubt it hey black oh man Denzel now I know I know what it's like for white people who see Tom Cruise I have never once gone to a Tom Cruise movie and thought look at dad that white guy he's representing and that has never occurred to me one time because that's crazy talk and you shouldn't think like that okay so then it was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby those were the two Jewish guys and now Tommy he C codes has written a new series of comic books by the way Tommy he coaches comic books out garbage I've read them they're so bad the Black Panther comic books so I hope the movie is much better than the comic books but here's Deirdre Holloman listen to this well Conda is a kind of black utopia there's a country where this takes place well Conda is a kind of black utopia in our fight against colonialism and imperial coll of black land and black people by white people said Deirdre Holman a founder of the annual black comic book festival at the Schomburg Center for research and black culture in Harlem so the black imagination that means everything in a comic book it is reality and through a major motion picture it's even more tangibly and artistically a reality we can explore for ourselves there's so much power that's drawn from the notion there was a community a nation that resisted colonization and infiltration and subjugation so a few things about this one sorry to break it folks Wakanda is not a real place it does not exist it is just as real as a scarred yeah it doesn't not it's not it's not a thing ok number two this idea that it's a fight against colonialism and imperial here is the reason why so many people are going crazy over this so one of the reasons people are going crazy over this is that supposedly they what Conda that the country of Wakanda in the movie I haven't seen the movie yet so this is speculation based on all of the news reports the the country of Wakanda has basically been separated from society for a long time so it's sort of like 17th century Imperial Japan where it's been separated from the rest of the world for a long time white people have not come in there's been no trade with the outside world except through a vibranium which I guess is some material some alien material the landed there and is extraordinarily valuable and is used in weaponry like Captain America shield and they've been able to guard from the influences of outside culture and therefore according to the movie Wakanda is the most technologically advanced country on planet Earth it is incredibly advanced it is filled with beautiful wonderful people who all treat each other wonderfully it is utopia is just the greatest place that ever was and this is being portrayed as reality the problem that I have with this is that there is no utopia for white people for black people or any people it doesn't exist anywhere there are two countries in Africa that technically have not been colonized they're Ethiopia and Liberia hey there they were Ethiopia was conquered twice by the Italians but was never colonized in the formal sense of colonies being placed there with Italian who then ruled the roost for a long period of time Liberia was originally founded by the United States which granted sovereignty to the local black population and the idea was that a lot of black slaves in America had been shipped here against their will would be shipped back to Liberia it was never really colonized in the in the technical sense both of those places have severe problems countries have severe problems and countries that are isolated have severe problems - Japan was isolated from Western civilization for four centuries that was not great for Japan it wasn't great for China this policy North Korea is is completely isolated from different countries the idea that trade isolation racial unity that these are the things you should be aiming for in a country is a really bizarre idea in a liberal order in a new order where free movement of Trade and population and money is considered a generally good thing and is better than life all around the world if you actually found it a country on the basis that it wouldn't trade with outsiders there wouldn't be any cultural exchanges and that you would actually produce all you needed in-house it wouldn't be utopia it would be garbage that'd be a bad country and just because it's a country filled with black people that wouldn't make the country any better you have cotton that this was sort of the founding ideology of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela this is the yoosh ideology in in North Korea it's not a good idea gee and there's not a race specific thing I'm not saying what Conda is bad because it's black or anything that's stupid I am saying that if your idea of utopia is a place where there is no quote/unquote white influence I'd like to see a place on the planet where that's a good thing I'm just at just as I think I'd like to see a place on the planet where a white only country has been a good thing with no cross-cultural pollination right that's it's silly and the the whole reason that cultures survive and thrive is because they adapt in advance thanks to technological advances they bring in from the outside and yet this is being seen as sort of a model and the problem is that if you're if you're creating a racial separatist model I haven't seen the movie yet but if the worship of Wakanda seems to be this right if if the worship of Wakanda is that a racial separatist model is good and that all of the evils that have been suffered by folks on the African on the continent of Africa have been suffered because of colonialism and imperialism that is historically inaccurate there are a lot of reasons the countries in Africa have suffered tremendously over time they were suffering tremendously by the way before or the before white folks ever got there there's tremendous tribal antipathy there's lots of tribal warfare there are people selling each other into slavery the the idea of utopia does not exist anymore there is no utopia the closest that we've come to utopia is a place like the United States where people of any race any color any background any ethnicity can live in freedom together while respecting each other civil rights that's the closest we've gotten to utopia and trying to build an alternative fictional utopia and then suggesting that we wish that this were a model for a country on planet earth is silly and counterproductive okay so there's my critique of locanda right then the here here's what it says by the way the New York Times article wakanda's rulers have wisely kept their homeland and its elemental riches hidden from the world and in its isolation the nation has grown wildly powerful and technologically advanced there is no nation in human history that has become wildly powerful and technologically advanced simply through isolation that is not how things work and it's a mistake to think this way it's a Malcolm X point rather than a Martin Luther King point and I think that that's a problem okay so we're gonna get to some things I like and some things I hate now but first you're

up new fantastic content we are the largest fast explore and conservative podcast in the nation all righty time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so let us begin with some things that I like so this was just hilarious okay I didn't like it because it's a great thing I like because it's just a funny thing okay so wls in Chicago was that their TV station was doing a broadcast about the Olympics and they accidentally put up a graphic instead of saying the deuce taking place in Pyeongchang Richard's in South Korea they said that it was taking place at pfj 2018 this is the most delicious Olympics that you have ever experienced the PF Changs the only problem is then apparently you're hungry for more an hour later so well done WL s apparently was just a graphic screw-up some of the guy in the back room it didn't understand what Pyeongchang was and so he just grabbed what it sounded like which was PF Changs 2018 so just well done WL is pretty spectacular okay other things that I like so yesterday I recommended the ego and you give money to Liberty in North Korea org you should go over to Liberty in North Korea Oregon I suggested they help smuggle people out of North Korea that is not technically true instead what they do is they help to ensure the people who have escaped North Korea are able to make passage to the West particularly to South Korea where they get automatic citizenship so check out Liberty in North Korea org please give them some money and help people who have escaped one of the worst regimes on planet Earth get to freedom that I think is a worthwhile thing of course okay other things let's do let's do some things that I hate okay so thing number one that I hate is everybody's going crazy because Boston Dynamics is a company that makes machines and they decided that they were apparently gonna make machines that are from Black Mirror this is an exact episode of Black Mirror where these machine like dogs are basically murdering humans here's what it looked like from Boston Dynamics so that's the last hand you hear before you die apparently here comes another one apparently it's signal to the other crazy robot dog and the crazy robot dog has a giant arm attached and it's now going to open a door because this is one of the problems that it had it wasn't able to open the door so now I was able to open the unlocked door so while you and your children are hiding in the closet screaming this is this machine can open the door and then these robot dogs can come in killing it so everybody's going crazy about these robot dogs oh my God we're all gonna die from the robot dogs okay I don't think we're all gonna die from the robot dogs they have made these dogs capable of running incredibly fast and jumping and all this sort of thing I don't think we're looking at Fahrenheit 451 with the Hound the reason I don't think that is because my guess is that you could probably just hit it and then the battery would die but one of the things that this is good for people are asking why are you making these things for military purposes of course if you actually need to open up a place where for example you think there's an AED better to send in a machine that can open the door and get itself blown up rather than a human and these machines serve us for the moment but I don't actually have a particularly negative view of this sort of machinery honest to god the only the only type of robot dog that I really care about is if they would somehow make a robot dog out of kosher pork because I really want to try bacon but other than that I don't care that much people who are going crazy over this I think are a little bit a little bit nuts themselves yeah other things that I hate so tomorrow is Valentine's Day I don't hate Valentine's Day per se although if you're if you're a spouse or significant other tells you they don't want to do anything for Valentine's Day in the words of Admiral Ackbar it's a trap so do not do not fall for that one I will say that this is pretty funny so yesterday President Obama and Michelle Obama had their portraits unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery we talked about it made fun of it yesterday the presidents of the United States praised Michelle's portrait he said it makes her look hot which is sort of weird cuz she looks like Kerry Washington in the picture not Michelle Obama but here is Barack Obama talking about it um Amy I want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and beauty and intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman that I loved okay so number one just like to point something out um when a man talks about a woman's hotness hey even if it's his wife I do it all the time about my wife but I don't care about politically correct scruples it is funny that if let's say Donald Trump said this about Melania the entire left with mousse it's freakin gourd right if he said my wife Melania so unbelievably hot i mighta boom cover New York Post other ladies boom right if he had said that the left would go utterly insane how dare he be a sexist maintain Melania can be reduced to her hotness Barack Obama is allowed to cuz a good family man other things that I hate so President Trump continues to maintain this idiotic completely fat-free position that aren't for that that free trade is somehow an enemy to the United States he said yesterday that our allies were not allies on trade he doesn't know anything about trade and it's really painful to listen to talk listen to him talk about it the reciprocal tax we are going to charge countries outside of our country countries that take advantage of the United States some of them are so-called allies but they're not allies on trade them their product and we won't charge them anything and we send them or product same product as they're sending us and they'll charge us fifty and seventy five percent tax and that's very unfair one of the examples got is harley-davidson they're very they're treated very unfairly in various countries you know the countries I'm talking about so we're going to be doing very much a reciprocal tax and you'll be hearing about okay we should not be having reciprocal taxes on trade okay the idea of a reciprocal tax on trade is economically illiterate the idea that if you go to the grocery store and they hike the prices on you right therefore when somebody who works at the grocery store comes to you you should hike the prices on them is foolish they will just go to another place to get their stuff to get their stuff okay the idea here is that if you are going to it's so dumb the idea that if you trade and somebody puts a tax on the good that is entering their country making it more expensive that you should therefore buy from them at a more expensive price by taxing yourself is just insipid but this is because people don't understand trade and people who critique free trade don't know anything about how the global economy actually works here is a great chart I'm gonna they call neoliberalism neoliberal a little bit sorry neoliberalism means freedom of trade free movement of labor and cash right this is what Oxfam which is a leftie organization cause the era of neoliberalism or so much suffering has gone on look at this chart right it shows the percentage of people living in Pahang or poverty illiteracy and child mortality look how it has dropped precipitously from 1990 all the way down to 2015 particularly take a look at poverty which is dropped down to below a 30 percent global rate okay and yet this is what we are critiquing when we could take free trade and the free movement of goods and labor just just silly by the way when I say for a moment of Labor I don't mean that everybody should become a citizen of the United States what I am suggesting is that if people want to come in and do a job and work I'm not opposed to that alright so we'll be back here tomorrow with all of your latest news updates
