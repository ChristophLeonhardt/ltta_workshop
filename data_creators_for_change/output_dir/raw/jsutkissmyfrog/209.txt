if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hold up this cute cat will it</font>

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,490
distract you from the fact that I've cut

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,069
all my hair off I'm sure people<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,720
videos explaining the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact they cut</font>

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,790
their hair by concerns in 10 seconds had

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,260
dreadlocks are singing front of the TV I

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,759
cut full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dreadlocks for fun I</font>

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,530
opened the dreadlocks for fun I cut it

9
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,480
open I opened up the dreadlock this was

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,699
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I thought this can't happen I</font>

11
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,260
cut them all off I went to a very

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,330
expensive hairdressers I said please I

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,400
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad took my house they</font>

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,310
sorted me out told you I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

15
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,960
today though if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can distract from</font>

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,029
this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want us to talk about no fire</font>

17
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,619
week for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who missed it low fire</font>

18
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,759
week was a really really cool project

19
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,800
that muddy who can find here kind of

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,750
dreamt up and it was basically kind of

21
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,420
week focusing on not focusing and kind

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,579
of recognizing that is that the content

23
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,660
is important but it's not always the

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,690
equipment and I kind of interpreted that

25
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,309
in other ways and also kind of probably

26
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">made the content and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll be</font>

27
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,250
questionable but I really freaking

28
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,600
enjoyed that week I put up a video

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,670
almost every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I missed a day I</font>

30
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,320
missed a day it's because also<font color="#E5E5E5"> sing</font>

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,120
really fun house party that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> view</font>

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,829
here I did a bookshop tool I did some

33
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,629
spontaneous reflection on things like

34
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,789
I've seen around me and I did a book

35
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,650
review I just kind of had a lot of fun

36
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,280
actually just filming on my phone and I

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,510
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that much fun filming</font>

38
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,799
youtube videos in a really long time

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,229
which made me think for something that

40
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,090
is my hobby I should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoying this</font>

41
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,100
more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really enjoy it because to be</font>

42
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,420
honest it's one of my long most

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,520
long-standing hobbies I think yep I've

44
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,509
moved to London are basically I've

45
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,070
fallen into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nest of friends that I've</font>

46
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,840
found through this website is become an

47
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,189
integral part of my life than I ever

48
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,439
planned said every youtuber ever and I

49
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,360
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my approach to it has been</font>

50
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,799
somewhat strange lately I've been

51
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,880
worrying about lighting I mean self

52
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,229
critical of my equipment and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

53
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,820
shown of brand myself now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't</font>

54
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen after this video probably came</font>

55
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,520
irrelevant but I did have a channel but

56
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,409
I started in<font color="#CCCCCC"> March called the girls of</font>

57
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the comet which is basically a book</font>

58
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,290
channel truly with the focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

59
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,210
reviewing and sharing and talking about

60
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,009
books I love books<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work in publishing</font>

61
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,290
now I'm a sales and marketing executive

62
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,479
but I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Mike enough life has</font>

63
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,100
changed since March which if you watch

64

my other videos if<font color="#E5E5E5"> freakin has this is</font>

65
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,740

66
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,090
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoy it and one of the</font>

67
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,020
gals are watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube but the</font>

68
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,490
subtotal for her channel is something

69
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,399
like a Pensieve of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts on the</font>

70
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,750
internet or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that and I</font>

77
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,770
not you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've learned from loaf</font>

78
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,840
I week is that I'm not brand separating

79
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,340
my content like that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to brand</font>

80
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,810
it trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it more professional</font>

81
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,300
and stuff it sends myself message that I

82
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,710
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sent I'm sending my cell</font>

83
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,970
phone messages on my brand and I'm not a

84
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,070
brand I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very complex human being and</font>

85
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,420
that probably right and that might be

86
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,100
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just how i see it for</font>

87
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,990
me not for anybody else emphasis

88
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,460
emphasis emphasis everyone's at the

89
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,810
pressure I put on myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put up</font>

90
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,540
consistent clean immaculate content is

91
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,250
actually ruining my enjoyment of this

92
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,260
hobby emphasis on hobby lots of people

93
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,730
uses as their profession and that's

94
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome and it men ables them to make</font>

95
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,380
exquisite content and excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

96
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,150
but I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person I have other</font>

97
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,390
things behind here over just just behind

just behind your<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye line here that I'm</font>

99

fun full stop that's where it ends

103
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,340
obviously if I gain other skills and

104
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,600
other thoughts and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that's</font>

kind of feelings about the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

127
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,200

the audience whoever the audience are

129
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,430
would think I was shallow or it just

130
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,810
wasn't the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> content they wanted</font>

131
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,310
and they can subscribe and just silly
