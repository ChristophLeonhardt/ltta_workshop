the judge in the summers Erebos defamation lawsuit against Donald Trump ruled earlier this week that Trump himself can be deposed as part of this ongoing lawsuit now in case you're not familiar with it here's the backstory on this entire lawsuit summers Erebos a former apprentice contestant claims that Donald Trump groped and kissed her in a meeting that the two were supposed to be having these were unwanted sexual advances according to zero votes so she was one of the women who had accused Donald Trump sexual assault Donald Trump gets on Twitter long ago says it's a hoax calls her a liar now she's suing for defamation judge ruled not only can this case move forward against the wishes of Donald Trump's lawyers but now that Donald Trump himself is likely going to have to sit for a deposition and this is why this is important not just as part of a defamation lawsuit against the president but it shows you that when Donald Trump's lawyers try to put these arguments that Trump has been making himself on Twitter in front of an actual judge they get shot down a few months ago Trump's lawyers had tried to argue before this judge that he could not stand trial for defamation because he was the president of the United States and you cannot sue him well as it turns out you can and then they tried to argue that okay well he doesn't have to sit for a deposition will really ever be a part of this we're gonna handle it on his behalf and the judge said once again no you can't do that and yes he can sit for a deposition again every argument that Donald Trump's lawyers have tried to put in front of this judge has failed and it just shows you what we can expect as this Muller investigation continues going forward if Trump's lawyers try to go in front of the the grand jury and make these same arguments it's not going to work they're not going to be able to say that oh a sitting president can't be accused of obstruction of justice or purge or they can't be subpoenaed because yes they can or hey Donald Trump can just pardon himself when in reality no he cannot Donald Trump has obviously surrounded himself with some of the most incompetent lawyers in this country and that's not even including Rudy Giuliani in all of this they're making bad faith legal arguments in front of sitting judges and they are getting smacked down at every possible opportunity as for summers Erebos she deserves justice if what she has claimed that Donald Trump did is true which we do not have very much reason to doubt her on this at all then hopefully Donald Trump will not only go down for the defamation but also for the assault that he performed on summers Airbus and his lawyers if they keep doing what they're doing are gonna make sure that Donald Trump loses all of his legal cases
