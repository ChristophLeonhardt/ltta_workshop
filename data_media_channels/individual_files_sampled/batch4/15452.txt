it is time to make an actual difference in culture and infiltrate the institutions the academic resistance to Marxist indoctrination is happening in Europe I recently read a story about a monastery built in 1204 which was abandoned by retiring monks and is now entrusted to Benjamin horn well horn well is the founder of the Institute for human dignity a Catholic non-government organisation from Rome the organization's goal is to protect and promote human dignity based on the anthropological truth that man is born in the image and likeness of God the 800 year old monastery sits at the top of a hill and Italy and it is soon to become home to students looking to embrace studies of religion and civilization from a conservative perspective The Times reports that it is to become the latest in a wave of right-wing academies attempting to shape the next generation of populist leaders in Europe and this really isn't the only Academy of its kind opening a brand new training school for conservative leaders is being opened by Marian lepen the Penn's Academy of political sciences is opening in September and will offer full-time education to students from across France they'll award real state recognized diplomas and give people an opportunity to learn without being indoctrinated in the process this gives me hope this is a political and cultural fight back in action we have always been capable of resisting the effects of the long march through the institutions and Europe's new populist leaders are leading the way it will never be easy but these schools opening across Europe are a fantastic beginning to an academic and educational resistance to the encroaching author Antarian ISM that has become the establishment norm thanks to children being preached Marxist ideals from a young age there's more we can do too for those who are terrified of their children being lie - through the schooling system and who have the ability to home-school do it for those who don't remember to teach our children about the world at home and take them to church we must teach our children from an early age about the history of our ancestors and the foundations of our civilization this is the simplest way to gain an advantage over the lies that are peddled by teachers across the US and Europe and it is more effective than chasing an Tifa around in the streets and picking fights with feminists and sjw's we must rise above this and gain power through the institutions and for those who think it's time to give up on academia don't we need good teachers more than ever and the more conservatives who are willing to power their way through the fundamentally bias university system only to become qualified teachers at the end of it the more resolute our resistance becomes the left have long understood the power of Education and while they see children as political pawns and puppets in their decades-long ideological game we see children as the pioneers of Western civilization our children will move the West forward and define what it means to be Western embrace this stay strong and educate to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
