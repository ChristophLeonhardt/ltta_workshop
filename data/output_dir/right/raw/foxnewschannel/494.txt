1
00:00:01,265 --> 00:00:02,133
REALLY.

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:02,767
>> Harris: CHRIS,VILLE TO

3
00:00:02,767 --> 00:00:03,101
CUT IN.

4
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,302
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SPEAKING.

5
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:04,769
LET'S WATCH.

6
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:06,270
>> LOOKED LIKE A VERY FINE

7
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,005
WOMAN TO ME.

8
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:07,705
VERY FINE WOMAN.

9
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:11,876
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRET'S

10
00:00:11,876 --> 00:00:15,079
TESTIMONY LIKEWISE WAS VERY

11
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:15,713
SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T

12
00:00:15,713 --> 00:00:16,381
SEEN BEFORE.

13
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,849
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

14
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,818
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MOMENT,

15
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,253
I THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF

16
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:23,121
OUR COUNTRY.

17
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,324
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY

18
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,960
CREDIBLE WITNESS.

19
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,762
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY

20
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:31,129
RESPECTS.

21
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,033
AND I THINK THAT -- I DON'T

22
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:35,967
KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO

23
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,368
CONTINUE ON WARD OR IF WE

24
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:38,770
ARE GOING TO GET A VOTE.

25
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,271
AGAIN, I'M HERE, SO I'M NOT

26
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:43,441
OUT THERE WATCHING BECAUSE I

27
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,542
CAN'T BE I HAVE GREAT

28
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:45,710
RESPECT ALTHOUGH MAYBE WE

29
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,911
WILL GO WATCH TOGETHER,

30
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:47,212
OKAY?

31
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:48,079
WE WILL WATCH TOGETHER.

32
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,748
BUT I THINK IT WILL WORK OUT

33
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:51,950
VERY WELL FOR THE COUNTRY.

34
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,351
I JUST WANT IT TO WORK OUT

35
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,552
WELL FOR THE COUNTRY.

36
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:55,720
IF THAT HAPPENS, I'M HAPPY.

37
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,021
>> HAVE YOU THOUGHT AT ALL

38
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,289
ABOUT A REPLACEMENT FOR

39
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:58,790
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

40
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,191
>> NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

41
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:01,192
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

42
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:03,662
>> WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE FOR

43
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:04,596
MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS?

44
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:06,097
>> I HAVE NO MESSAGE.

45
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:07,932
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT

46
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:09,934
THEY THINK IT IS RIGHT.

47
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,770
THERE IS NO MESSAGE

48
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,170
WHATSOEVER.

49
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,937
THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY

50
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,072
THINK IS RIGHT.

51
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:16,007
THEY HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE

52
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,176
WITH THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE

53
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:18,777
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE.

54
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,345
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

55
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,246
REOPEN BACKGROUND

56
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:21,780

SENATOR GRASSLEY WHO IS

62
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:28,586
THAT WILL BE A DECISION THAT

63
00:01:28,586 --> 00:01:29,688

OKAY?

73
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,870

WE WILL BE DISCUSSING

79
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:50,609
VENEZUELA AMONG MANY OTHER

80
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:50,943
THINGS.

A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS
