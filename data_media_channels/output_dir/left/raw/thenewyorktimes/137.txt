“I know words and
the best words."

00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,510
“Do you have a relationship
with Vladimir Putin?"

[doorbell ringing]

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,750
“I do have a
relationship with him.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,160
And I think he’s done a very
brilliant and amazing job.

“Sure.

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,081
When people call

00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,700
it’s always good,
especially when

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,285
