can you say with certainty that right now that there's nobody working for this White House that is presently working in the interest of a foreign government I can tell you that every form has been filled out that it reaches absolute to yeah you got it people were filling out forms we could sit here and ask me whether I can vouch for whatever it is a few hundred people that have filled out everything you know that would be ridiculous for me to stand here and suggest that I possibly could what I can tell you is under the penalty of law every single person is filled out a form that is being vetted by whatever level of classification that they need to get by the appropriate law enforcement agencies or or HR entities but I can't prevent somebody from fully disclosing everything on their taxes they're filling out a form what I can tell you is that if there is an instance brought to our attention we're so on has misled it either they will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency or dismissed or appropriate action will be taken but yes there is no tolerance for that
