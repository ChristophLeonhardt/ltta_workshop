What makes "Alcyone" very special is the
mix of beautiful melodies, beautiful
vocal arias and also very
beautiful harmonization.
And the use by Marin Marais,
the contrast between the most melancholic
melodies, the most sad melodies, and the
very demonstration of the power
of the natural, with the tempest, the
elements, bringing all this description
and painting of the elements
with a lot of imagination.
