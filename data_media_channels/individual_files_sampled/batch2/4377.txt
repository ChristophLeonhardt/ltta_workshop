President Trump needed a reminder about the danger Russia poses all he had to do was turn to its own Department of Justice today a federal magistrate ordered Maria Bettina Russian national suspect of being a covert Russian agent in this country to be held without bail the magistrates side which cited with a federal of prosecutors who argued that she was an extreme flight risk that she was going to skip out to the country the Department of Justice painted a portrait of a character straight out of the Americans according to court documents Bettina was in regular contact with the Russian Intelligence Agency the FSB using sex and deception to forge important political connections working covertly she established back-channel lines of communication to the Kremlin and US political organizations which include the National Rifle Association so they quote these lines could be used by the Russian Federation to penetrate the u.s. national decision-making apparatus to advance the agenda of the Russian Federation so quote and even Bettina became a fixture at conservative and Republican events The Washington Post reports that it was those contacts that landed her on the FBI's radar for morning drew Mike Kendall a nyan intelligence and national security reporter for NBC News and Mimi Roca former assistant US attorney let's go to the spy game here Ken what do you think she was up to in the United States it seems like a create a great Matahari story here it's incredible Chris she was an agent of influence she's not accused of trying to get military secrets that's why she's not charged with espionage what she's accused of doing is trying to build a back channel to American politicians specifically Republican politicians through the National Rifle Association it's really amazing I mean those of us who cover this case closely have known about Marie abou Tina for some time but never in my wildest dreams Chris did I imagine that the FBI would uncover a plot this elaborate that she was actually in touch and being handled by Russian intelligence official oh don't forget her her main handler was a guy named Alexander tortion who's a Russian central banker who tried to get a broker a back-channel between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump during the campaign he was trying to meet with Kushner he was he ended up being at dinner with Donald Trump jr. on the sidelines of an NRA event so this appears to be a Russian operation to infiltrate the NRA to infiltrate Republican politicians to essentially build influence in Washington which is more valuable in some ways to the Russians than the secrets of the f-35 because after all we're not going to be in a shooting war with Russia anytime soon but there's a lot of diplomatic back-and-forth as we've seen this week and it's important for them to have allies in Congress Chris maybe there are a couple of restaurants in Washington I will not name them that have a history of spies hanging around in them and you know that's sort of the co or the game if you will and I think today they have the feel of it what is this about spying and when do you go from being an agent to being a spy someone who's really involved with the server subversion really well yeah so Ken really I think hit the nail on the head in that boot inna is an example of someone who based on what we know right now and there could be more to come she was acting using her position here to try and insert influence on American politics on the Republican Party in particular as opposed to someone who would be charged with espionage that under the technical side to the criminal statute it would require something someone to be taking information or something of value to the foreign power or a person who's not authorized to have it and right now we don't have any indication that she was doing that although it should be said first of all that there could be more to come as everyone knows you know there could be superseding charges and also that sometimes prosecutors want to charge what's more easily chargeable they may have somebody spooking around like are trying if you'd always be reporting back information as you saw more information you'd be saying well here's what I heard here's what I heard found about a connection between somebody to somebody that can be useful it just seems by the very nature being an agent you are reporting back information I mean I think there is overlap you're right but the statute the espionage statutes are very particular they're more narrow and it seems like what they went with here it's not so in other words we're not saying that she could never be charged with an espionage statute but for now this is the broader statute it seems to capture more correctly the nature of sort of what she was trying to do here and and as I was saying they they may not want to reveal other information about what she was communicating back because that might lead to reveal and classified information so this is the safer course for them to take now according to court records Maria Bettina was trying to broker I tried to broker a secret maybe between Donald Trump the candidate and Vladimir Putin in July of 2015 weeks after president announced his candidacy for presidency for the president boo Tina was able to question the president is stance on Russia's sanctions that's why this is an open k√∂ppen of conversation here here she is questioning candidate Trump if you would be elected as a president what will be a foreign policy politic especially in the relationships with my country and do you want to continue the politics of sanctions that are damaging of both economy or you have any other ideas I know Putin and I'll tell you what we get along with Putin I believe I would get along very nicely with Putin okay and I mean where we have the strength I don't think you'd need the sanctions I think that we would get along very very well well Donald Trump wasn't the only high profile Republican official that Putin had access to in the run-up to the election she met with Muskaan wisconsin Governor Scott Walker former Republican senator Rick Santorum and former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal maybe what are you making these contacts it looks like she was trying to do something active right so it looks like I mean the question really is was she trying to generally assert influence in the Republican Party or was she in some way connected to the influence operation with respect to the election and you know I know there was some reporting about that question of that clip that you played of her asking Trump that question that that seemed very planted if you will and he had a very prepared answer and so it does you know make you one wonder and you know from the prosecutor perspective wondering means investigate so I'm sure that if there is a connection between what she's doing what she's done and the attempts to influence the election per se you know that's when it would sort of come in to Muller territory ken do you think she was trying to she was an agent there trying to get candidate Trump on the record to say he wanted to get rid of sanctions that look like that's what he was ready to do right there absolutely Chris ah yeah I think Mimi's Mimi's got it absolutely right this started as something separate as an influencer operation by the Russians and by the way we wonder how the Republican Party which had been hard-line on Russia for years suddenly became so sympathetic to Russia arguably this is one of the ways this was a secret Russian operations with backed by Russian money to influence Republican politicians and she was part of it but it was separate it looks like it was separate from the Trump you know the Russian effort to meddle in the election but it may have melded those things may have come together and that's why Muller is very interested in this and by the way there's a salacious aspect of the story Chris this woman is accused of using sex to try to get a job at a non-governmental organization she was living with a Republican political operative so just just a fascinating tale all
