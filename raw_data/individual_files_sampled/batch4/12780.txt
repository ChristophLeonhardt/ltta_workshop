Noles as a former bachelor any advice on how to get out of the friendzone oh I've never dated before and my parents met in an arranged marriage also thoughts on insults onions I don't know what it what are the people that are like celibate but right oh yes involuntary yeah well yeah I mean I've been involuntarily celibate at various points of my life so it's too bad I mean that's kind of a big challenge going from a culture and a family that there was an arranged marriage to that is and how to get out of the friendzone the friendzone is really tough you know you're like hey the way that you do is always the answer about this is confidence now it's very easy to say that because people say be confident you say I'm not confident that's why I'm talking to you but we're confident I wouldn't even ask you this question so you have to be confident but as with all things you have to be interested in the girl genuinely interested not just interested even the phrase in the cell or involuntary celibacy that puts all of the focus on your own dilemma you know yeah so to speak so what you really have to do is say I like this girl why do you like this girl because she's this this this she has this I like this about her right well what am I gonna do about it I'm gonna go ask her out well what if she says no well okay maybe when you ask her out tell her all the things you like about her yeah well okay this this gets to a couple competing theories right I'm not to mansplain this to you Oh I will say when guys are a little too nice women don't always know I'm not saying to be like a sissy man but I'm saying be honest yes upright be honest and be manly indirect because sissy men are not manly indirect women like to be pursued and they want a man to be direct that's right that is such an important point Harvey Mansfield read a good book his name is Mansfield and it's unmanned leanness and on how manliness has been lost so what what you want to do to be manly is be honest be direct be forthright don't be afraid and don't try to be one of these slick guy pickup artist types either those are two sides of the same coin yeah you want to be a gentleman you want to know what you want be assertive but not some knuckle dragger or something be a man be an old-school man I have found look I managed to nab sweet little Elise I mean not yet no yes she still has a while to run away right yeah but having a Lisa shaped hole in the wall but I think women are starved for that because we live in a society of soy boys today and all of these men who are like hey you up hey you want a Netflix and chill they're like I've heard from single girlfriends they'll like your Instagram post but then when they see you in person they won't talk to you what is that I just spoke on Facebook that's how I got sweet a little ELISA so you want to do you don't want to be one of those little guys like that yeah you just be direct I think women are you know that's listen you know New York of a bit of rent very liberal places in my life that's all you ever hear so just be direct and to quote Don Corleone II speaking to Johnny Fontane when he says I don't know what to do Godfather just you're gonna act like a man what's the matter with you that's the answer well and then once you like it and you put a ring on it you should get Boland branch you've got a Boland branch you have got to get Boland

and a half on you and y'all go has a question alright yeah go alright this is your future by the way this children marriage might have some running around out there right now for all I know I don't Yago says hey Michael who do you think will outlast the other do you think Trump will make it to eight years or will the media and the left succeed in pushing about well it seems like they really want to impeach the guy they've been trying to close he talked about that yesterday yeah all really want to impeach the guy I think he's gonna stick it out I I think the the one thing you can never say with Trump is never which is ironic because there is all movement called never Trump the guy seems to outfox his opponents in every step of the way the other reason why I think he'll outlast them is that the American people like him he's very popular right now his approval rating has consistently been on par with Obama's at this point in his presidency or higher we know that approval of his presidency especially among Millennials especially among racial minorities has surged in just the last five months we know just among black men it doubled overnight and actually even more than doubled because the mixed feelings percentage also rose significantly so I think he's doing very well on that front obviously the the facts of his presidency are all looking good the economy is doing well we're seeing good diplomacy freed hostages on and on and on this also shows that successful presidencies shape public opinion so look the the left and the Democrats and the resistance and all the screaming people and the pink cats who say no you know all of those people still want to impeach him I say let them try because if they succeed if they manage to impeach him you could probably see what happened to Nixon in 1974 Nixon was elected in 1972 with 49 states he a 49 states he lost one state in just a few electoral votes that he lost they finally booted a man of office like they wanted to what happened the next big election we got Ronald Reagan we got 28 years of basically conservative governance so the mainstream media the Democratic Party bureaucrats make all they want they can try to overturn a presidential election the people still have a say and I think that they will make their voice heard okay it'll be interesting especially with the midterms coming out the the data from the midterms are incredible because historically he should lose the house if not the house and the Senate most sitting presidents do lose midterm elections they that's just the historical record and yet the numbers that we're seeing a lot of people now are saying hold off on this blue wave a lot of Democratic strategists are saying this blue wave might not be as nice as we thought if some people are saying we could pick up seats in the Senate if we managed not to the house which we should lose the house historically speaking if we manage not to that would be a massive mandate to govern it would be unexpected except by all the people who expected it like you like me all right hide the grin for a little bit Jacob says I have read more I have read before that Muhammad is a descendant of Ishmael if true is Islam what the Bible speaks of in Genesis 16 12 quote he will be a wild donkey of a man his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand will be against him and he will live to the east of all of his brothers well you know the trouble with prophecy is that you can read a lot of things into it certainly Islam does trace its lineage to Ishmael so you see historical parallels there but when when you're looking at the Quran for historical accuracy I think you're probably not doing very well they're probably better places for the historical record because it says very clearly in the Quran they crucified Him not with regard to Jesus they say that they didn't crucified Jesus that it looked like they were crucifying him there's a lot of commentary on this they say he was taken off at the last minute or someone was substituted in for him but the denial of the cross of Christ is a central historical fact of Islam and st. Paul writes there are many walking now and I tell you even weeping who denied a cross of Christ and they deny it because the cross conquers death Christ on the cross conquers death this is the central theological fact of our civilization and it's one that everybody has to grapple with so the traditional Christian view of Islam is that it's a heresy a Christian heresy it comes we know that Muhammad developed his religion when he was with a heretical Christian monk in Syria on a merchant trip with his uncle that change could could be read through the Bible very easily and the Bible as the beginning of wisdom would tell us a lot about this but looking at Islam looking at those strange historical claims claims such as the claim from Ishmael claims such as the cross of Christ I think tell you a lot about the religion itself and how it relates to the modern era house civilisation has grown up alongside it all right let's keep moving Nicholas says Michael does Jesus ask that a Christian forgives only people that have asked forgiveness as God does or to forgive regardless of them being repentant well you forgive people you should forget you you say in the Lord's Prayer our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive Michael as we forgive Michael yeah so you're asking for forgiveness from God the Father only in so much as you are forgiving other people now this is not to say however that there's no role for human freedom here a lot we were just talking about Christian heresies so one thing I notice about heresy is that it always cannot stand it cannot tolerate theological mystery divine mystery so God is fully just and he's fully merciful how do we make sense of this those things seem to be at odds but what is impossible for man is not impossible for God some heresies want to say it's all justice no mercy some want to say it's all mercy no justice some versions of Christianity say that only there is only God's grace and humans Liberty has nothing to do with it freewill has nothing to do with it another heresy called the Pelagian heresy says that it's only freewill that matters in God's grace is not the central fact but of course the reality is that it's both so should you forgive yes you should forgive but this is not to say that your freewill doesn't play a part God comes down the mountain but then you have the Liberty to turn toward God or to turn away from God if not the faith would be for naught you see it most specifically with the Virgin Mary the angel Gabriel comes down says hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you you're gonna conceive a child and you know so on and so forth and she says I am the servant of the Lord his will be done and all of heaven is waiting and she ascends to it that freedom is so essential and as we were talking about the way that religion effects culture and affects civilization that centrality of human Liberty tells us a lot about our civilization I think we know that we live in we live in a free society so my evangelical mind went to when I was a child and I asked my mom the gist of that same question and she used the 70 times seven thing and then like every kid has done the 70 times 7 when they write their hair or something but I think that was a eloquent way of putting good and compete against Hollywood yeah I like foreign films I like Bollywood well enough I don't it's not that I consume it all the time if I'm on an airplane that's usually the only time say oh that's kind of weird I don't watch Bollywood movies too much I do watch a lot of foreign films from Russia or Italy or Germany in the Western world obviously Russia is well it's important because before I go into collude with people I like to know a little bit about their popular culture that's a good idea I'm sure most of the Russian films are funded by Putin loving all the garden right that's right yeah you know the one today that was in the news his name is Oleg his name is actually short for Oleg or anyway that's neither here nor there Oleg are yeah it's amazing I I do love though because obviously Hollywood turns out a bunch of tripe and they the movies have gotten worse the only area of Hollywood that's gotten better is television where a lot of the good stories have been streaming services streaming services have really enabled that I strongly advise watching foreign films and foreign television shows because the way that Hollywood can manipulate your mind is it knows it has a lock on you it knows that if you're in the popular culture in the United States you're watching them you're like plugged in with an electrode into your brain and so they're gonna send you messages and when you read literature from around the world you read or you watch films from around the world or television or radio it opens up your mind and it shifts your consciousness and you say to quote Kanye West it shifts the consciousness and you say oh there's another way of looking at the world oh there's another vision that maybe I don't have from popular culture it's really good and and one of the great advantages of it is it allows you to criticize your own popular culture in the United States it really puts you ahead so I I strongly advise it watching subtitles can be tedious but it's worth doing interesting so we have a very fancy watch that you're wearing are you gonna wear that on your wedding day I certainly should I can wear it with both black and brown I kid you not I get compliments on this watch all the time it's really nice this is super cool for the band it's really nice so this watch this is the revolver series by the way if you're looking to get me a wedding they just came out with the Bronze Age collection and they have the Bronze Age revolver if you sent me one I would wear it I'm saying I would wear it that's okay I love their product movement is so good a movement has come very far from being crowdfunded kids working out of a living room in the past year they have not only introduced a ton of new watch collections for both men and women they've also expanded to sunglasses which eyewear and fashion forward bracelets for her which I wear when you know she goes to sleep at night and I just want to see how I look maybe I look good movement watches start at just $95 and a department store you would pay three four or five hundred dollars to get a watch of this quality seriously movement figured out that by selling online they would be able to cut out that middleman and the retail markup they would provide the best possible price so you get classic design a minimalist style very high quality

fa co v fe fe cy movement keeps growing check out their expanding collection movement calm MVM tea calm / Kofi Fei Co V Fe Fe join the movement I feel like like Co V Fe Fe is very like Hooked on Phonics work when you spell that out Megan says hi Michael who do you support for California Governor I don't know sweet meteor of death is that option I mean that was the option for president and 26 that was yeah actually it turned out pretty well I'm glad I'm glad the sweet meteor didn't win in 2016 maybe we'll get a chance so I'm the nerd that reads through the all of the candidates in their statement I did it last night HIGHlarious who'd you vote for I haven't vote yet I am the weird person that a lot of my friends do absentee but I like to go to the polling place what and I like to bring my daughters and I like to you know yeah I'm weird do you I don't I wouldn't ever allow anybody near that place make sure make sure they're you know you know it's akin to the rule it is strange once I've been given a Democratic ballot before like on primary day it's like excuse me in 2016 I went in there I had my Republican Party emblem shorts on ass do to do to do walk down the street of course you did I had voted in the primary uh-huh and they couldn't find my registration for the general election this happened to several Republican friends of mine in California not surprising so we have one candidate that I guess is sort of running a campaign Travis Allen mm-hmm he's mounting something of a campaign is it it's gonna end up being like Gavin Newsome though it's gonna be it's gonna be Gavin Newsom you've seen his ads just just horrific I mean you know it's really sad because the most conservative figure in California politics practically is governor Moonbeam just because he's old so he actually governor Moonbeam was actually vetoed some of the gun pocalypse legislation it's it's really a tear no but he's on the him on the environment and stuff oh yeah he's a hippie dippie space alien yeah it's really sad though because we're in a bad place right now politically and we're going into a worse fate place politically so I strongly endorse sweet meteor of death for the California political races I have to say I think that more so than governor the local races are where we potentially seeing a chance yeah pay attention to those that's your mom advice of the day christian says will you place another bet against Ben for the midterm elections and if so will you write another blank book with it so for those who don't know I have it somewhere in the studio here I won $400 for this disappear oh yeah right there yep I want $400 for mr. Shapiro for the 2016 election I bet on Trump he bet against Trump now part of the reason I want so much money is that Ben gave me odds so he gave me four to one odds on this bet Ben has now told me cuz he didn't just lose against me in that election he lost a few bets yeah he's told me he will never again give odds on a bet so I don't know if I just get even odds I don't know if I want to be that much of a gambler donate the money to charity or something yeah I donated it to something alright is that is the cigar store across the street is that a charity I don't do their 501c3 yet oh yeah that it was pretty good I guess that's it really Ben's giving me that check is a charity because he hasn't paid me since then oh so that's sort of a chair that's a relief all right I hope I'm saying this right Dodi doing it looks like that's right Dodi it looks like the Democrats are losing some ground so do you think that this will last or is this Trump's only term they are we are winning I cannot say this emphatically enough we against all odds shockingly we are winning we're winning on every level because the presidency thus far has been successful as a matter of judicial appointments as a matter of other appointments the economy foreign policy deregulation it's just a success so far it's successful in the popular culture it's because as Andrew Breitbart said politics is downstream of culture we elected a cultural figure and surprise surprise he's changing the culture the biggest pop culture star in music Kanye West has come out and endorsed the president he wore the magg ahead you had another rapper chance the rapper who actually doesn't support Donald Trump and he said black people don't have to vote for Democrats you're seeing this major cultural shift as well so this is obviously a success what does this mean for Democrats in the future politics is never settled there are not permanent answers in politics it's not philosophy it's not theology politics as Aristotle defines it is the affairs of men those go back and forth so eventually some Democrat probably will win something at some point I will point out the only people they have weigh in especially California the only people they have are just old white people they really are they just have Hillary pocahontas it is she white I don't know you've got Joe Biden Bernie Sanders is like 500 years old Nancy Pelosi has been dead for 20 years I think I am fine oh my gosh every the others especially in California so they just do not have the claim to the future they don't they're not exciting people don't want to keep that reality show going they want to watch this reality show to make America great again reality show for the near future I think we're winning could that change in a second sure but as of right now despite the constant negative press cough if a Austin says Supreme Admiral Knowles well people aren't giving you the weird names like Clavin they well they're using my correct title oh okay okay how do you think the Iran versus Israel conflict will be ultimately resolved probably with bombs if I had to get no ID I don't we decide I don't yeah first of all I don't know that it will be ultimately resolved because we're talking about antagonisms that go back thousands of years and certain and certainly over a thousand years I can help you here when Jesus returns that's right yeah I suppose yeah in in the next page in the coming age is how that will be resolved but I will say also in in one of my observations of this administration's success unlike the previous administration which took which basically abandoned our ally Israel and gave the mullahs in Iran everything that they want and bent over backwards for every despot and tin-pot dictator around the world this administration has come out and said we are not going to play by the old rules we're going to be unpredictable they said to the North Korean dictator hey you're short and you're fat I have a big button on my desk that could blow you up at any second you've got to worry about the madman in America I mean that is some really it wasn't just the big button it was my buttons bigger than your button my button is bigger than your button and it works let's let's remember the elementary that's right hey and you know the foreign policy establishment has told us for so long you have to play within these parameters you have to do too and what has it gotten us a lot of failure this administration comes in and says bull in a china shop I am going to threaten you like a wild man on Twitter and it seems to have worked we're now defending our ally Israel Israel is writing god bless Donald Trump on the walls of Jerusalem and dedicating train stations to him and our adversaries such as Iran which is the single greatest threat to the world order for the past foreseeable decades is now unnoticed and so they're going to threaten to hurl some missiles from Syria or whatever but I think that's easily rebuffed there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace to quote Ronald Reagan and you can have it in the next second which is surrender short of surrender short of chains and slavery the way that you can push for peace the way that you can try to secure peace is from strength when you have strength you might have peace if you offer weakness you'll get nothing but chaos and war all right let's keep moving I wonder if this has been like our very own Ben Shapiro we'll see how it depending on your Michael your fire is Michael why do people say I appeared radical crazy because I had an American flag displayed on my social media profile photo I feel like that's a trend I've been seeing anything Pro America is bad you're crazy you're an awful bigot how dare you how dare you put that hateful symbol of freedom and justice and equality and prosperity and charity how awful of you this is a real trip it's the American fight like the new Confederate flag yes they at the university of Irvine UC Irvine oh they do lots of dumb stuff down there they do a lot they voted in the student government to ban the American flag because it's not inclusive enough and you might say well this is insane America is the only country in the world that it was ever founded to be inclusive right to to be founded primarily as a Creed in this new world that the Europeans discovered and to bring in people of all colors and races and but all behind an American creed one that believes in natural rights that come from natural law that worships a God so I think this gets to what GK Chesterton wrote about in orthodoxy he said there is a thought that stops thought and that's the only thought that ought to be stopped and that's what you're seeing when people say the American flag is awful because when they when they oppose the American flag when Colin Kaepernick gets on Indian protests against the American flag he's under cutting his own protest if you use the rights and the freedoms given to you by America to fight against America you're a house divided against itself you're not making any sense that's incoherent I don't think people quite understand that you can some people say will you support free speech so I'm gonna use my free speech to shout you down and shut you up that is not a coherent statement you're you can't use the right to undercut the right itself you see this with people and it's because they're not thinking very clearly so on the Left now you get shout your abortion you get screaming and yelling there's no civil discourse and I the only way that I think we can deal with these people to try to turn that culture because there isn't this cultural movement happening we have to treat them like children because they just don't understand they don't understand what America stands for they don't understand why what they're saying is not coherent so I'm not saying you need to punch them in the face that's not what a good parent does to a child or something you you treat them like a child you have patience you want them to grow up you want them to be mature these little lefties and maybe they'll come to realize that to protest against the American flag is a senseless and ridiculous act all right Tony says what do you think the chances are that the Republicans keep control of the house this November I am loath to make a prediction on this not because I'm afraid of being wrong and all it takes up me plenty of wrong predictions and politics it's because secretly I think that the chances are significant I don't know if it's likely but I think there is a significant chance Republicans keep the house but I don't want to say that because I want people to be afraid that we will lose the house so they go out and vote yeah Republicans well statistically Republicans do turn up in good numbers in midterm elections that is true elections where Democrats a fire you know that's absolutely right Republicans are worse on campaigns these random stats about p1 voters but you do I mean it is true Republicans are more civically engaged and so there if I were a gambling man I mean you'll have to check that Ben's bank account in November but I think there's a very good likelihood that we hold the house but not only should Republicans not be confident about this they should be terrified because this could all end tomorrow all of this great cough fa magaz stuff could end tomorrow and it's historically likely to end but it's really hard to look at all of the public opinion polling that we're seeing and just all of the facts of legislation policy diplomacy popular culture it's hard to look at all of that and say that Republicans are down and out on the contrary I think everything is moving in our direction and if Republicans get out and vote I think there's a good chance that we give ourselves a mandate to govern okay please remember that this conversation with our very own Michael Knowles is live for everyone to watch but you can only be a part of it and ask Michael questions if you are a subscriber so head over to daily wire comm right now and you can join us by asking us questions there and next month be sure to tune in for our episode on Tuesday June 19th at 5:30 p.m. Eastern 2:30 p.m. Pacific featuring our editor in chief you know host of the Ben Shapiro show host of the Sunday show I mean he's soon to be host of the Michael Nolan show no I have dibs on that yeah okay Ben Shapiro and I will be sitting down for Ben's episode of the conversation so let's keep moving on we are about halfway there and we want to get through as many questions as possible right Brady says hey Michael whenever the left is told that the Democratic Party is the party of slavery they just claim that the party switched John Legend did this on Twitter you know when he and Kanye were going back in the fourth right what actually happened oh no I think you you remember what happened because this is what the Democrats told me happen so the Democrats were this awful party that was the V Party of slavery the party of the Ku Klux Klan the party then when we took when we freed all of their slaves when the Republican Party was founded to free their slaves then they instituted Jim Crow and they tried to deprive black Americans of all of their rights and they tried to harm them and threaten them and lynched them but then here's what here's what happened according to this theory one day they just switched just cuz just cuts they just they they all met yeah well no they came they said we're gonna have lunch the Democrats and the Republicans had lunch there right okay so from now on you're gonna be us and we're gonna be you okay they said oh that sounds reasonable okay cheers you know and that's what happened that's what the Democrats want you to believe happened and it is the stupidest idea I've ever heard in American politics but people believe this now what why do they get away with it in part it's because certain geographic areas have switched political allegiances in part it's because the Democratic Party has embraced the left the the during the 20th century they were many facets of democratic activism were infiltrated by communist Soviet influence and so you had the new left you had students for a Democratic Society you had the Weather Underground you got a lot of this moving in and infiltrating the Democratic Party oh you saw certain racial groups move away so beginning after the New Deal black voters tended to move from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party this is not because they switched in the 1960s that move over actually predates any civil rights legislation by decades by several decades you also see Republicans as the party of civil rights they proposed the first civil rights bill 1957 I think it was and then Republicans voted in higher proportion for the civil rights bills in 1960s so where do they get this idea from they get this idea because Democrats today are ashamed of the awful heritage of their party the Republican Party literally founded to free the slaves and the the first presidential nominee of the Republican Party was James Fremont as in one of those wonderful bits of historical coincidence or Providence and they're ashamed of that and because they're lightly educated on history so they say well I don't support that and so okay let's just say it changed but it's totally incoherent as with all things in politics there are a lot of factors moving along when the Democratic Party moved very far to the left a lot of those social conservatives that they once had in the south and the Bible bet they said well we can't embrace atheism we can't embrace abortion we can't embrace these far left social policies and so they started to migrate more to the Republican Party it has absolutely nothing to do with parties switching and anyone if you believe that I got a beautiful bridge to sell you in Brooklyn kate says where did you receive your unusually robust Catholic theology ology education thank you for calling it unusually robust I I actually worry that it isn't very robust at all or not as robust as it should be behind the scenes sometimes Michael studies up on Catholicism I do all the time for that but before the conversation oh yeah I said I'm going to get all these theological questions the things that really help or the first guy I'm going to recommend is actually a Protestant but he's like a crypto Catholic is CS Lewis almost almost a Catholic so I love reading Louis or Chesterton or Hilaire Belloc is a particularly good Catholic writer but if you have simple questions about Catholicism because a lot of times you'll hear people of other Christian denominations and sects say well I can't I can't believe you're a Catholic Catholics worship Saints and worship Mary and believe in justification through works or whatever nonsense they start saying and I realize that a lot of people don't disagree with the Catholic faith and don't attack the Catholic faith they attack a ridiculous caricature that someone wrote of the Catholic faith that has nothing to do with Catholic dogma and Catholic tradition and street so they'll say well I you know my church reads the Bible and I tell them my church wrote the Bible so there's a little difference there but one wonderful resource for this is there's a website called Catholic Answers and so I hate to tell you google it but google it the the Catholics because the church has been around for 2,000 years they've thought through a lot of things and so you could ask the Catholic Church you know what should I have for lunch on Tuesday and say you know brisket and orange soda because of this part of Scripture or whatever and so kay if you just google it Catholic Answers has taken a lot of the very popular questions and given a beautiful scriptural and church father analysis of how they've come to those answers it's a wonderful resource and the best part of it all much like our eternal salvation is it's free it comes in a price that you can afford so I recommend you check it out okay but nobody died to build Catholic Answers nobody did die for our salvation that's right that's true and but then he gave us all the Catholic Answers Kevin says hey Michael fellow Catholic here what are your thoughts on the traditional Latin Mass I love it I am so you having a full mass for the wedding ceremony will be doing so my Prius is that is that did I say that right yeah yeah my priest is one of the people who turned me on to the Catholic urge of the traditional Latin Mass and his priest in New York father George rattler he's a phenomenal writer and he's had television shows and look up anything you can find of him is his writing has been very influential on the way that I think about things and he does a New Yorker kind of Latin Mass which is there's a lot of chanting there's a lot of Latin but you know it kind of moves along sometimes the traditional Latin national you're like oh you know it's nice long chanting in New York we got places to be you've got to move it a little faster than that I really love it some of the older Anglican rites are really good for this too there's some chanting there's some English there's some Latin and then you can get the Trinity in Mass in most cities in the country if not all cities which is the full all and Latin beautiful chanting it's really nice because after Vatican 2 you had a lot of acoustic guitars and maracas or something and the liturgy just suffered so much part of going to the masses is you're participating in in a ritual there's a there's a sacrament that's happening the Eucharist and what a sacrament is is when heaven and earth touch one another when the metaphysical and the physical touch one another the symbol and the symbolized it's not just a symbol it's not just you know just a symbol of Christ's sacrifice and it's not literally a hunk of flesh it's the the two coming together in one in a sacrament and when you're in a beautiful liturgy you're awed by that that's the first feeling the beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord the feeling that you have is one of o and Wonder and holy fear and you don't always get that in the suburban churches with the electric guitars maybe you can but not frequently in my experience so that traditional Liturgy if you haven't experienced it now you can even go to Eastern Orthodox doesn't have to just be a Catholic liturgy I think the Eastern Orthodox they have twice the liturgy and half the Pope so that you know those can be really really beautiful but I recommend you check it out because it's the experience of it it puts your whole body into it there's no it's not just rationalism it's not just abstraction it really we're a unified body and soul and I think you see the unity of that and that traditional liturgy and I hope it spreads more it's on the rise in the United States and I hope it just keeps going because that that draws people into the pews okay Christian says it's how will we ever resolve the problems in the Middle East bombs a lot of bombs would be a good way big yeah yeah well right I mean the real answer it you you would give a real answer which is that the problems in the Middle East will not be resolved until the end of the age of the Second Coming probably that's true one because politics is the affairs of man and those things don't change too because the problems in the Middle East have been going on since Cain and Abel since you know this second generation of people and because there is on the one hand we cannot just uproot and transplant American ideals and install them perfectly in other places doesn't mean that we can't try to use our influence and use our ideas to bring people up to speed but the conservative disposition is one that says you can't just abstract everything and make everything Universal like the Enlightenment tried to do that doesn't quite work people have traditions and rituals and family relationship and and long antagonisms between clans and different kins and tribes and things like that and you're never going to utterly eradicate that so I would say if you're sitting around and you're waiting for the Middle East conflict to be resolved don't hold your breath if you're if you're speaking specifically though of Israel and Palestine Palestine that's the country to the east of Wakanda and to the west of gnarnia the country of Palestine if you're if you're talking about that specifically then this administration has done a wonderful job because in the old day I got you on that one no it's actually kind of funny sorry in the old days you know in the Clinton administration the Obama administration they would treat these terrorists these Palestinian terrorists on the same level as they would treat the duly elected leaders of Israel that's absurd there is no country called Palestine the the Palestinian people elected Hamas to be their governing body in 2006 those people don't get a country and if we pretend if we go along with this fantasy and this fiction that there is a country of Palestine and that somehow Israel is occupying their territory you certainly won't have peace you'll get more chaos more war more death we need to be very clear clarity helps bring about peace there is a country called whose really have a right to their territory the capital of Israel is Jerusalem our embassy is now in Jerusalem and people that elect Hamas to be their government they don't get to have a country okay Devin says Big Mike I mean not the word I would use to describe you but okay Big Mike it's your personnel it's your cough if a dealer and can you hook me up I'm in dire need of a fake all right I got a big confession to make I this is why I'm a little sick right now uh-huh I deal so reach me on Twitter I'll talk to ideal cough FAI dish it out all day long huh but I taste my own product that's gotten me into some trouble these last couple weeks because I just can't resist I got all that cough FA I'm trying to do two people here on Twitter on the show recreationally legal here in California or oh no it's oh no its banned recreationally medically in it you cannot have Co FFA in California and so but the last couple days I've been like Tony Montana I've just been sitting there saying oh and I dip my face in the kool-aid and I blow up a big bunch of cough eff up my nose it's a hell of a drug so the long story short is dmal I hope you are Joshua sir Michael of cough FA who has the best president Trump impersonation at the Daily wire do I venture it now do i I this is very hard depends I love been like a brother but his impersonally real bad well you know some are some are better than others he does I think his he gets the Obama inflection very well Chris Matthews is good that's my favorite people woman is good yeah Piers Morgan too pretty well well he you figure if you just destroy a man on national television and ruin his career you maybe you know something about it you could do the impression he I will say Ben's impression of Trump is much better than Alec Baldwin's terrible impression of Trump I the thing with there are different kinds of Trump because you get the Trump prompter Trump yeah you and you also some are high somewhere low you like okay frankly okay frankly frankly uh-uh and it's the Aerie Trump but then sometimes Trump is very like on the on his voice right like we will make America great again okay okay folks we're gonna do it folks we're gonna do it and those are two different shades of Trump and you know an impression is not an impersonation it gives you just a little idea of Trump so maybe I think our various impressions of Trump they all together the perfect one it's all together the perfect one but it gets to how we see the man you know that get to different I can see that mm-hmm I can see that maybe Alec Baldwin's impersonation of Trump is so bad because he views only the bad of them yeah and he's just terrible at doing impressions yeah there's also that good actor though ABC is giving him a Sunday night show did you ever does that can't believe I'm plugging his stupid podcast he used to have this podcast Alec Baldwin on I think was NPR and it was like a caricature of an NPR podcast here's the thing hi I'm Alec Baldwin and here's the thing how are you keeping a straight face when it was an awful podcast my favorite Alec Baldwin moment of all time is what I worked for the great American Sean Hannity okay let me segue for a moment and he was on a show on WBC and Mark Levin and Sean Hannity called in and they were all just yelling at each other and it's the best most epic talk radio on the face that's just like firing one you know just good Joel says what's the best resource to figure out who to vote for during the primary season I use eeny meeny miny moe on the California ballot because my vote doesn't really matter here so I actually do the other day I was looking at the California primary ballot and it was all these Democrats running for whatever and then one of the people running is a bus driver he was running for Secretary of State or something he's a Republican and I thought like oh no he was running for Senate against I am Feinstein okay and I thought yes I would much rather vote for any bus driver in this entire country then Dianne Feinstein so I put that there uh-oh there are some good resources out there if you want to find out for conservatives a lot of different outlets Club for Growth conservative review few other places put out scorecards take it a little bit with a grain of salt because these organizations have their priorities so an A+ from the Club for Growth is going to be a different different than an A+ from the NRA for instance but I would check out those scorecards because they're they're very good the reason that we have lobbying in this country other than that it's enshrined in our First Amendment is because we don't have the time to become experts on every topic in politics so we need people who are experts to give us the highlights give us the executive memo I usually check it out that way and there is a little bit go with your gut on certain candidates because politics is not just about everyone's position on issues it's also about the ethos it's also about the spirit of a person if they're gonna fight if they're gonna change their minds if they're gonna you know for instance on the question of moving the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem everybody promised that they would do it Bill Clinton George W Bush Barack Obama everyone for everyone always promises none of them do it Trump promised I expected he wouldn't do it just like everyone else and then he did it because he's a different type of politician than those other guys you need to know with the people you're voting for are they the kind of politician who's actually going to follow through on their word or if they say this it really means this so you got to go with your gut a little bit there but use use all of those resources on the issues because those people have done the research that you don't have time to do okay norm says do you find Jordan Peterson's attempts to rephrase conservative and religious wisdom in secular materialistic terms to be a valuable project or it's too much less lost in his attempted translation of it I do think it's a very valuable project I've had Jordan on the show a couple times and I have tried to baptize him both times that's read because I do find in Jordan's writing that he's he's speaking about Christ he's he is speaking about Jesus and I know that's not fashionable and I know that's not sophisticated in today's culture to say that it's much more sophisticated to say well he's getting to the idea of the divine that is a vocht in our consciousness and the way that language is a right bump okay sure that's the more sophisticated way but the more precise ways he's reaching for Jesus and so there that's a little frustrating when he won't go all the way and I try to throw water on him through the camera or through the Skype set but what he's doing is so incredibly important because what he is doing is he is engaging a whole array of people who have been brought up with a stupid idea of atheism this idea that is not philosophically tenable there are not good arguments for atheism and he's going in and getting them like a gateway drug to say there is purpose in life there's life has meaning you should clean your room there is objective truth there is going through and setting people up to the point where I think they can take in theology or or philosophy and I don't know that someone who isn't a mild-mannered psychologist from Canada could do that right now I think he might be the perfect entry point I say this all the time people say Michael you're a Catholic so do you think that we should eradicate all of these different Protestant speakers or this or that I don't think so at all I've loved reading Protestant speakers they brought me in too they brought me away from me and brought me into a fuller understanding of the church I then went further I then went further theologically then many of those writers would be willing to do but you need those gateway drugs I don't want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good if people read Jordan Peterson and they are imbued with these thoughts of truth objective morality those kind of things awesome that guy deserves sainthood all right we only have a few minutes left so let's keep rolling through as many questions as possible Tommy says hey Michael are we going to see a return to the panel of deplorable zhan your show I liked watching an actual panel of sane people not yelling over each other well it's very hard because as you know I'm getting married so bringing on a bunch of cute ladies present company excluded included every every day on my show you know that can create some tensions at home no I'd love to bring the panel back we've had you could just start booking some dudes - what I'm just saying some don't know I'm trying about the panel some would actually have like decent political thoughts not many but I'm saying you don't just need ladies like myself okay so I see the confusion what you cuz you're on there you're giving your thoughts it's very interesting for the audience but when the ladies are on the panel usually I'm just there you know I'm just sort of staring you know like kind of mindlessly so that's I had to stop that for my own and and there's also Paul Cardinal Bois who would come on I guess I love I love doing the panel we switched it up a little bit cuz I wanted to do some of these longer interviews which I've been doing on the show in the last month or two but we tried to bring them back recently for a show and I I think this was Satan's fault all of the tech broke down and so I lost everyone who was on the panel we couldn't do it but we're gonna try to do it again soon because I I do love getting everyone's opinion and and all those guys are all my pals you know I just did I did a fox hit on Sunday and Ally Stuckey is you Allie Stuckey and then and the Charlie Kirk was on there and I thought Oh Allie oh man I haven't seen you on camera so this is like the panel is deplorable has been on Fox News so we're gonna do it again we'll bring it back all righty Jacob says hey Michael Young Christian here with an ecology degree this field is based in a lot of controversial science such as climate change how do I keep my credibility well yeah I suppose it is a little controversial because it's all these lefties and materialist types they're one place where they go wrong with climate change because I think so much of the conversation of climate change is incoherent and it's really people having theological debates and pretending that they're having a scientific debate so is if there is a question is the earth warming someone I don't know possibly I talked to Richard Linton about this former atmospherics physicist at MIT and he said there there might be some evidence that it's warming slightly there isn't a lot of evidence that would be catastrophic there's some evidence it could be beneficial the models are insufficient and they've always been wrong so who knows and I think what people are really having with climate change is a substitute for religion because everybody's got to serve somebody so when you don't have Bob Dylan's at the great profit of the previous age when you don't have true religion you have to worship other things you get superstitious so climate change gives you all of this right it gives you a sin in the form of pollution you can even buy and dode indulgences in the form of carbon tax credits so it has all you worship the Sun God basically worship the the earth in the creation which is why it's an unsatisfying religion because you're worshiping the creation instead of the Creator but there is there are plenty of places for good Christians in studying the heavens and how the heavens go and and our own earth saint francis of assisi wrote a beautiful police piece to sister earth not mother earth sister earth and I think Pope Francis used a quote of that you know apostolic exhortation so many of the great physical advances in science have been made in many of them by Catholic priests and by Christians broadly so I think that's good you have to make sure you don't fall for the trap of worshipping the the creature rather than the creator and you have to make sure when people are having these debates that you're really debating science and you're not seeing emails circulating around East Anglia universities saying we have to hide the decline because our faith in jizan it practically no you go where the data tell you that the science is going and if you worship something else I think you'll be able to keep a level head about that even as your atheist colleagues cannot keep a level head okay norm says are you and Andrew Clavin ever going to have a conversation on your different views of beauty subjective versus objective I suspect this may play a major part in your different views on marriage it could be I don't know I think that sometime when you give these three second answers then sometimes minor differences or nuances seem to be opposing and they are younger than they are so I will say in CS Lewis said I think in in the weight of glory I always confuse all the Lewis books somewhere CS Lewis said he was writing about maybe was abolition of man one of those two said that the tree is beautiful and it's not your feeling of the tree that it's beautiful your your feeling could be beautiful or you feel it could be whatever but the tree itself is beautiful and because the tree is beautiful you perceive that it is beautiful and and that's objectivity and I think somewhere drew may have said that it is you're observing the tree that makes it beautiful and of course what he's saying there is that it is our consciousness that is able to process the beauty of the tree but I don't think that's the same thing as saying you know it's just my feelings man I don't know if it's quite that so I don't know that true makes any decision based on you know that's just my feelings yeah definitely not since he was at Berkeley days so I don't really think it's quite that and also when it comes to marriage I think there are drew is making certain Aristotelian arguments and Christianity is infused with Aristotle Aristotle comes up through st. Thomas Aquinas and so that that might have some nuance there as well but I think it would be very unfair to the Supreme Lord at the multiverse to say that he is some relativist who says you know don't ya come I um I think I just really my feels are all beautiful man I I don't think it's quite that I think that that distinction is overstated all right Keegan says what's a simple way to explain the conflict in Israel to mean my friend are having a small argument over this oh well you should read the Bible and read the Quran and then I think you'll get it if you just take the tiebreaker has a good video on it - over you the Israel yeah the real conflict is that people don't want the Jews to have a homeland they don't want the Jews to have Israel that's the central part of it and ever since the establishment of the State of Israel people have been trying to invade and conquer it and - nine chisel away the land from Israel and so the question you have to ask yourself is do Jews does the State of Israel have the right to its own country in its historical homeland and all of the questions that have to do with that will come out from there someone pointed out they said Palestinians are the fill illogical descendants of the Philistines you know that's the word comes from Phylis Philistine - Palestinian but it is and so the Philistines had their homeland and the Jew shouldn't take it but it is worth pointing out the Philistines are invaders so I reread three parts of history in Scripture that's the central question did the Jews have the right to their homeland in their historical homeland I think so I I would much rather have the only functioning ally of the United States functioning democracy in the Middle East in Israel the Jewish state rather than another failed country as has happened with so many of the neighbors of Israel all right back to cultural question real quick Raymond says speaking on movies and TV why do we hire all these foreigners to play Americans with American accents when we have tons of undiscovered talent I hope you're talking about a little old me because these days the only the only acting work that I get is in another Kingdom and Ted Cruz commercials those are the main those are my main venues as an actor these days I think part of this is because a lot of modern acting training in America is hucksterism and there are still a few good teachers I could recommend them to you but really only a few that I could recommend and I think most of them are in New York the trouble with acting in the post Brando world especially with kids today is that Marlon Brando was innovative as were all of the teachers of the group theater and Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner and that this was my world Strasburg as well and there was this triumph of naturalism in acting so you had marlon brando would start to mumble a little bit or start to chew his words and it wasn't that perfect diction of say Laurence Olivier or something and this all comes from Freud basically from Stanislavski from Freud from deuces blush the actress Eleonora Duse a blushed on stage because the her subconscious was working so much in the character she was so embodying the character that an unconscious response of a blush was able to come out and modern actors in America have taken this far too far and they don't make any choices they just sort of stand there and mumble because they think any choice is not naturalistic but that isn't true there's nothing as Stella Adler said there's nothing natural about boring the audience to death there's nothing organic about boring your audience to death and so you see much better actors come in and they they can make choices from overseas they're also just aren't great roles for certain demographics so there's like one role for black people every year there are a lot of great black actors so uh Navarrete the black performance in America is much better I think that's what one of the reasons why and we have more of a celebrity culture whereas there is still that classical theatrical tradition in London if you're gonna be a British actor there's a good chance you really want to do the craft rather than just get instafamous and put Kardashians and movies or something and be able to charge a million dollars per post right yeah Julian says Miguel in summary what are the pillars of Catholicism that brought you back to the church can you do this in a minute or less I I could probably sum up 2,000 years in a minute or less in an auctioneer tone go there's a question of moral authority so the question is is the Pope the Pope is the church the church did Christ Institute a church on earth did he say to Peter Peter you are the rock and on this rock I will build my church did he say you have the keys to the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven feed my sheep do you love me do you love me feed my sheep did he instructed the risen Lord instruct the Apostles for 40 days on how to build the church and tell them where to go and tell them how to go and tell them to sell their cloaks and buy a sword and tell them to go here or there tell Peter where he was going to die it was there an understanding of the early church community in the Apostolic age in the early ecumenical councils was there an understanding of succession and where certain churches say the bishopric of Alexandria they would look to the Bishop of Rome to resolve certain disputes has that evolved over time is the church a living institution and is a sacrament a sacrament is a sacrament the meeting of heaven and earth the metaphysical and the physical in the real institution of the church if our God men unlike all of these other religions if the divine logos of the universe came down and became a man and fleshed himself and really died for our sins shows particular people at a particular place at a particular time to be his apostles and to spread the good news then does he have a particular church in real space and time and it seems to me the answer is clearly yes and what Springs from that is the only theology and institution that has endured for the entire history of Christendom we're done all right here we go a real easy question to end on defend the two-thousand-year-old faith yeah okay good thanks everyone for joining us thank you Michael for being here this month we'll see you in a couple of months or you know tomorrow over on the Michael Nolt show right you can subscribe to the daily we're
