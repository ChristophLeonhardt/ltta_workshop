DISCUSSION TO TAKE YOU NOW TO 
AMES, IOWA WHERE POLICE ARE 
GIVING AN UPDATE INTO THE 
INVITATION OF THE DEATH OF A 
STUDENT GOLFER. 
>> COLDWATER STAFF ELUDED US TO 
A BODY FOUND IN THE WATER NEXT 
TO THE NUMBER 9 TEE BOX. 
SHE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED
. SHE HAD BEEN STABBED IN THE 
UPPER TORSO, HEAD, AND NECK. 
NEXT TO THE WOODED AREA NEAR 
THE GOLF COURSE THEY SPOKE TO A 
SUSPECT LIVING IN THE WOODED 
AREA THAT MADE STATEMENTS 
HAVING THE URGE TO RAPE AND 
KILL WOMEN. 
WE GOT A DOG FROM THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT WHO ALSO TRACKED 
EIGHT SENT FROM THE VICTIM TO 
THE LOCATION IN THE WOODED 
AREA. 
AT APPROXIMATELY 2 PM, OFFICERS 
WERE IN THE AREA OF THE CAMP 
WHEN THEY ENCOUNTERED COLLIN 
RICHARDS  WITH A DATE OF BIRTH 
OF SEPTEMBER 8, 1996. 
-- DECEMBER 8, 1996. 
CELIA BARQUIN AROZAMENA ONE HAD 
SEVERAL  FRESH SCRATCHES ON HIS 
FACE AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO 
CONCEAL A LACERATION ON HIS 
LEFT HAND. 
HE WAS TAKEN TO THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT FOR QUESTIONING. 
CELIA BARQUIN AROZAMENA ONE SET 
OF  SOME POINT HE WENT TO 
ANOTHER ADDRESS AND PASTE. 
THE PEOPLE AT THAT LOCATION 
DESCRIBED CELIA BARQUIN 
AROZAMENA ONE AS  DISHEVELED 
AND COVERED IN BLOOD, SAND, AND 
WATER. 3
HE LEFT THIS RESIDENCE WITH HIS 
CLOSE IN A BLACK BACKPACK. 
DURING A SEARCH OF THE TENT AND 
SURROUNDING AREAS, A BLACK 
BACKPACK WAS LOCATED WITH TWO 
PAIRS OF SHORTS WITH STAINS 
THAT TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE 
PRESENCE OF HUMAN BLOOD. 
A KNIFE WAS ALSO RECOVERED FROM 
THAT LOCATION. 
AS YOU MAY KNOW, WE HAVE CHARGED
COLLIN RICHARDS WITH MURDER IN 
THE FIRST DEGREE , A CLASS E 
FELONY. 
WE THINK ANYBODY WHO HAS HELPED 
US SO FAR INCLUDING THE IOWA 
DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION, IOWA STATE 
PLACEMENT, BOONE COUNTY 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE, THE IOWA 
STATE PATROL, THE STAR ONE 
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM, AND WE 
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE 
PUBLIC WHO HAVE ALREADY 
SUBMITTED TIPS FOR FOLLOW-UP 
AND OTHER LEADS AND THE STAFF 
AT COLDWATER GOLF COURSE IN ALL 
THEIR HELP IN TAKING CARE OF 
OUR OFFICERS WHILE THEY ARE 
WORKING A VERY HOT DAY 
YESTERDAY. 
WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR ANY 
INFORMATION REGARDING THIS 
CASE. 
OUR TIP LINE IS OPEN. 
OR YOU CAN SUBMIT TIPS THROUGH 
CRIME STOPPERS OF CENTRAL IOWA. 
I WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT 
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN 
ACTIVE AND ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION AND WE DO NOT 
WANT TO DO -- JAPANESE THE CASE 
BY RELEASING ANY INFORMATION 
PREMATURELY. 
>> WAS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP 
AT ALL BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND 
THE SUSPECT? 
>> NOT THAT WE FOUND. 
>> ARE THERE ANY OTHER SUSPECTS 
YOU ARE CONSIDERING? 
>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW 
UP ON THAT BUT I DON'T HAVE AN 
ANSWER FOR YOU YET. 
>> ARE THERE OTHERS LIKELY TO 
BE CHARGED? 
>> IT IS STILL ONGOING SO THERE 
IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY 
DEVELOP OTHER SUSPECTS BUT 
RIGHT NOW, NO. 
>> IS IT A -- 
>> THESE INCIDENTS ARE 
OBVIOUSLY RARE. 
BUT IT IS BEST TO TAKE 
PRECAUTIONS, TRAVEL IN GROUPS, 
JUST BE AWARE OF YOUR 
SURROUNDINGS AND REPORT 
SUSPICIOUS -- SUSPICIOUS 
ACTIVITY. 
>> WERE THERE WITNESSES? 
>> I CANNOT ANSWER THAT RIGHT 
NOW ON SPECIFIC WITNESSES. 
SORRY. 
>> WE ARE STILL LOOKING INTO 
THAT BUT I DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC 
ANSWERS ABOUT HOW HE ENTERED 
THE GOLF COURSE. 
>> YOU KNOW HOW LONG HE WAS 
LIVING AT THE GOLF COURSE? 
>> THE WOODED AREA NEXT TO THE 
GOLF COURSE, NO I DO NOT. 
>> IS HE CONSIDERED HOMELESS? 
>> YES. 
HE WAS LIVING IN A WOODED AREA. 
WE HAVE NO OTHER KNOWN ADDRESS 
FOR HIM. 
THE QUESTION WAS, WHAT SHE 
GOLFING ALONE AND THE ANSWER IS 
YES. 
WE HAVE HAD ENCOUNTERS WITH HIM 
IN THE PAST. 
I DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON 
HIM ABOUT CRIMINAL RECORD AND 
HOW MANY INSTANCES WE HAVE HAD 
WITH HIM. 
>> DO YOU KNOW IF HE WAS 
FOLLOWING HER DURING HER 
COURSE? 
>> WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG HE 
MAY HAVE FOLLOWED HER. 
>> DID COLDWATER STAFF REPORT 
ANY PROBLEMS WITH HIM OR OTHERS?
>> I ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THAT 
RIGHT NOW. THAT IS SOMETHING I 
CAN FOLLOW UP ON THOUGH. 
>> HOW ARE OFFICERS FEELING 
RIGHT NOW AFTER HAVING A 
WHIRLWIND OF A DAY LIKE THIS? 
>> CLEARLY IT IS A TOUGH DAY 
FOR OUR OFFICERS. 
WE ARE NOT A LARGE DEPARTMENT. 
HAD A LOT OF OFFICERS WORKING 
VERY LONG HOURS. 
OBVIOUSLY MUCH WORSE FOR FAMILY 
AND FRIENDS DURING A VERY 
UNCERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE 
WE WERE ABLE TO CHARGE THIS 
PERSON. 
VICTIMS FAMILY LIVES IN SPAIN 
WHICH LOGISTICALLY MADE IT 
DIFFICULT TO GIVE THEM 
NOTIFICATIONS WHICH WE ARE 
STILL WORKING ON TODAY. 
TOUGH DAY AT -- ALL THE WAY 
AROUND. 
>> DO WE HAVE A TIMELINE ABOUT 
HOW QUICKLY HE SAW HER AND THEN 
ATTACKED HER? 
>> NOT AT THIS TIME. 
THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS WE DO NOT WANT TO 
RELEASE QUITE YET. 
>> WAS HIS DNA FOUND? 
>> DNA RESULTS TAKE QUITE A BIT 
OF TIME. 
BUT THERE WAS THE PRESENCE OF 
BLOOD ON CLOTHING THAT BELONGED 
TO HIM. 
>> THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULD 
NOT COMMENT ON RIGHT NOW. 
>> A QUESTION FROM ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES, WHAT IS IT THAT -- 
>> IF ANYBODY WAS OUT IN THE 
AREA AROUND COLDWATER AT THAT 
TIME OF DAY, AROUND PROBABLY 
BETWEEN 9:30-10:30, IF YOU SAW 
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, PEOPLE 
COMING INTO OR LEAVING THE 
AREA, WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE 
TO HEAR FROM YOU TO MAKE SURE 
WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND 
EITHER RULE IT OUT OR RULE IN 
IS IMPORTANT TO THE 
INVESTIGATION. I DON'T HAVE ANY 
INFORMATION ABOUT TRAVEL PLANS 
FOR THE FAMILY RIGHT NOW. 
>> YOU SAID YOU DON'T KNOW IF 
THERE COULD BE FOLLOWING 
ARREST. 
>> I THINK THE PUBLIC ALWAYS 
NEEDS TO BE CONCERNED AND BE 
AWARE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS, 
REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY WHEN 
THEY SEE IT, AND BE CAREFUL. 
>> IS HE FACING ANY ADDITIONAL 
CHARGES? 
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> QUESTIONS FOR THE COUNTY 
ATTORNEY, FACING ANY ADDITIONAL 
CHARGES? 
>> NOT AT THIS TIME. 
AT 9:00 A.M. 
CELIA BARQUIN AROZAMENA AND  
WAS SEEN BY -- COLLIN RICHARDS  
WAS SEEN BY THE JUDGE. 
I REQUESTED A CASH ONLY BOND 
WHICH THE COURT GRANTED. 
THE JUDGE SET A PRELIMINARY 
HEARING FOR SEPTEMBER 28 AT 1 
PM. 
>> UNLESS THERE ARE ANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS, WE WILL WRAP UP. 
>> THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION FOR 
THEM, I CANNOT ANSWER THAT. 
>> HOW RARE OF A CASE LIKE THIS 
HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
DAY WHERE PEOPLE COULD'VE SEEN 
THIS HAPPEN? 
>> IT IS RARE, OBVIOUSLY. 
STILL VERY TROUBLING THAT 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD 
HAPPEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN A 
IMMUNITY THAT IS AS SAFE AS 
AMES IS. 
IT IS AN AWFUL THING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED. I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
ELSE I CAN SAY. 
IT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY SEARCHED.
>> I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY 
SPECIFICS OF EVIDENCE WE MAY 
HAVE COLLECTED THAT WE ARE 
STILL LOOKING FOR ANYTHING 
SOMEBODY MAY HAVE. 
WE KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF 
PRIVATE VIDEO OUT THERE. 
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THE 
PUBLIC MAY HAVE, THAT THEY MAY 
HAVE CAUGHT THAT TIME OF DAY WE 
WOULD LIKE TO CHECK IT AND MAKE 
SURE. 
>> HOW LONG WILL COLDWATER BE 
CLOSED? 
>> WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE CLOSED 
THROUGH MOST OF TODAY. 
OUR HOPEIS TO BE ABLE TO TURN 
IT BACK OVER TO THEM BY THE END 
OF THE DAY BUT THINGS COULD 
CHANGE, DEPENDING ON WHAT 
INFORMATION WE GET AND WHAT 
THINGS WE FIND. 
>> ARE THE OFFICERS STILL OUT 
THERE? 
>> BOTH AGENCIES ARE STILL OUT 
THERE EXPECT --. 
>> IT IS REALLY TROUBLING LIKE 
-- THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WOULD HAPPEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT 
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN AREA THAT 
IS EASILY SEEN FROM A LOT OF 
LOCATIONS. 
IT IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE 
APARTMENT BUILDINGS, RIGHT 
THERE AT THE END OF GRAND. 
IT IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING. 
WE ARE NOT RELEASING THAT RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
INCIDENTS THAT THE SUSPECT IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH WHETHER IT WAS 
VIOLENCE -- 
>> I DON'T HAVE THE CRIMINAL 
HISTORY ON HIM IN FRONT OF ME. 
I CAN'T COMMENT ON THE MODE OF. 
-- MOTIVE. 
>> I PROBABLY CANNOT ANSWER 
THAT QUITE YET. 
WE ARE STILL FOLLOWING UP ON 
SOME OF THOSE THINGS. 
>> ARE THERE SCREENSHOTS OF A 
FACEBOOK PAGE, ARE WE SURE THAT 
THAT FACEBOOK PAGE BELONGS TO 
HIM? 
>> I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR 
YOU RIGHT NOW. 
THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR BEING 
HERE TODAY. 
AGAIN, PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL OF 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT THIS TIME 
OF LOSS. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
IOWA POLICE GIVING AN UPDATE ON 
AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
MURDER OF A STUDENT GOLFER IN 
IOWA. 
IT IS A REALLY TROUBLING AND 
DISTURBING STORY. 
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, THE 
POLICE OFFICIALS THAT WERE 
PROVIDING AN UPDATE GIVE US A 
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AS TO 
EXACTLY WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE 
INDIVIDUAL WHO THEY HAVE 
ARRESTED,  COLLIN RICHARDS , 
WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING 
HOMELESS. 
HE WAS LIVING IN THE WOODS IN 
THE WORDS THAT THE POLICE 
OFFICIALS DESCRIBED THERE, 
LIVING IN A WOODED AREA WITH NO 
OTHER KNOWN ADDRESS. 
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HE 
WAS HOMELESS. 
THEY HAD HAD ENCOUNTERS WITH 
HIM IN THE PAST. 
THIS PERSON WAS LIVING IN THE 
WOODS NEAR THE GOLF COURSE. 
THE GOLFER, HER NAME IS CELIA 
BARQUIN AROZAMENA . SHE WAS 
COUGHING AS A LOT OF GOLFERS 
DO, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO 
COMPETE AT A HIGH LEVEL, 
GOLFING ALONE ON THE GOLF 
COURSE HERE, HER BODY WAS 
DISCOVERED. 
IT HAD BEEN STABBED AND LEFT IN 
THE WATER. 
THIS MAN HAS NOW BEEN ARRESTED. 
THE PROSECUTOR ALSO MADE A BRIEF
COMMENT AND TOLD REPORTERS 
GATHERED THERE THAT SHE ASKED 
THE JUDGE FOR A $5 MILLION CASH 
ONLY BOND WHICH WAS GRANTED. 
THERE WILL BE A PRELIMINARY 
HEARING ON THE 28th OF SEPTEMBER
. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THIS 
COMMUNITY IS IN SHOCK. 
IT IS A SMALL COMMUNITY 
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE 
OFFICIAL WHO IS GIVING THE 
UPDATE. 
VERY LOW CRIME IN THE AREA. 
THIS VICTIM IS NOT EVEN FROM 
THAT UNITED STATES. 
SHE IS ACTUALLY FROM SPAIN. 
THERE WAS DIFFICULTY IN GETTING 
IN CONTACT WITH HER NEXT OF 
KIN. 
THAT IS REALLY ALL THAT WE KNOW 
RIGHT NOW. 
OUR DEAN REYNOLDS WILL BE 
REPORTING ON THIS THROUGHOUT 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AS HE 
GETS MORE INFORMATION WE WILL 
TOUCH BASE WITH HIM. 
THAT IS THE INFORMATION 
DELIVERED OUT OF AMES, IOWA 
TODAY. 
A VERY SAD AND DISTURBING 
STORY. 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
