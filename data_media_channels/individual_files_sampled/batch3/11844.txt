British prosecutors have reportedly admitted deleting email exchanges with their swedish counterparts regarding the case of wicked expanded Julian Assange now this happened back in 2014 and cecilia chican reports following a Freedom of Information request by an Italian journalist who has been following the Assange case for many years it was revealed that the Crown Prosecution Service here in the UK had apparently deleted email exchanges with their counterparts in Sweden following the stepping down of a lawyer on the UK side back in 2014 and despite the fact that this journalist who asked for this information had said that it's actually according to her incredible that this information would be destroyed and that they must have something to hide the Crown Prosecution Service have said that whatever information was deleted despite there being impossible for them to get this information back they're saying that this was something that had no legal implications in the Assange case now according to the WikiLeaks founder himself he has tweeted that the UK prosecutions prosecution destroyed all their emails the UK told Sweden not to interview me back in 2011 and 2013 and Sweden wanted to burn after reading those emails that's according to Julian Assange now we can also tell you that there's a lawyer in an upcoming information tribunal surrounding these latest developments that are going to be heard in London next week who has said that these potential revelations could have had some impact on the amount of time that the Assange case has dragged out for we have to remember that Julian Assange has been staying here at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since the summer of 2012 and organizations such as the United Nations have found his detention to be arbitrary and this Swedish prosecution have already dropped the in rape allegations that were brought against him initially so obviously these this is now seen as quite crucial information in terms of what this could have meant for the amount of time he has been staying here in London okay let's bring in Jennifer Robinson now she's a Doughty Street chambers barrister should be representing the eternal Italian journalist at the tribunal Jennifer what are you hoping to come out of this tribunal obviously we're trying to find out more about what exactly the role of the UK Crown Prosecution Service has been in extending joint Assange's arbitrary detention the United Kingdom is in breach of its international obligations it's found that he is arbitrarily detained and a large part of that decision-making process was the way in which this case has been handled and the fact that he has been offering his testimony to the Swedish prosecutors for seven years since I first was involved in his case in 2010 what we didn't know and have only just found out through this freedom of information litigation is that the CPS was advising the Swedish prosecutor not to come here now we know that she was later found in breach of her obligations by the Swedish courts the iewk the international the working group on arbitrary detention found that the UK and Sweden was in breach of their international obligations and now because of this we know that the that the UK had a role in playing a part in this this case could have and should have been resolved back in 2010 and now we know that the the UK played a key role in in extending his attention does this latest revelation suggest that British prosecutors haven't been completely impartial it is the British prosecuting service plays the role as the agent of the Swedish prosecution Authority we have been offering his testimony for a number of years this case could have and should have been resolved in a proportionate manner which the UN has found ought to have involved the Swedes prosecutor coming here the Swedish prosecutor has done so in numerous other cases since 2010 and the question to be asked is why this wasn't done in Julian's case why was it that the Swedish the British prosecution authority was advising Sweden not to come here this case could have been dealt with a long time ago and it's a result of that failure to come here that Julian Assange has remained in detention for so long do you think the deleted emails could actually change the fate of Julian Assange I think that serious questions are being should be raised with the UK authorities around the accountability of the crime secretion service and an internal review about the way this case is being conducted it could have been resolved a long time ago and the fact that they had been advising the Swedish authority not to come here contributed to that delay contributed to the British government being found in breach of their international obligations there should be an internal review there should be an internal data retention policy that would allow that kind of accountability process to take place now that we know that they've deleted that information we will be asking them to answer to that in the tribunal on Monday and it remains to be seen what will happen you've previously represented Julian Assange his interest he's effectively been under house arrest in reality in the Ecuadorian Embassy for years now in London is is there any stage at which you can see him actually leaving that building without being arrested of course the reason that he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy is with respect to the ongoing United States criminal investigation that investigation like the British authorities at approach this FOI litigation has been a complete lack of transparency we are concerned about the risk of extradition should he be should he walk outside of the embassy and one of the requests that Ms Moretti has asked of the Crown Prosecution Service here in SFO our litigation is what correspondence the British authorities have had with the United States about his potential extradition we are obviously continually concerned about that as a result of the more recent announcements by the Attorney General of the United States jeff Sessions saying that the prosecuting WikiLeaks founder mr. Assange is a priority we are concerned about the statements of the head of the CIA Mike Pompeo accusing WikiLeaks of being a hostile on state Intelligence Agency and in those circumstances there is a very real risk that mr. Assange would would risk being extradited to the United States if he was to come out of the embassy now these proceedings in hole between the Swedish prosecutions conducted the case and the lack of transparency around what the US intends to do with mr. Assange has contributed to his ongoing detention and it's time that there's transparency around this and a proper in investigation about why this has taken so long to resolve Jennifer thanks for coming out to speak to as Jennifer Robertson Doughty Street chambers barrister that
