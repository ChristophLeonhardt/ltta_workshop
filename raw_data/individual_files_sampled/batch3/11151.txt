when it comes to the on/off summits between the US presidents and North Korean leader it appears Trump has a track record of making impromptu decisions and this historic meeting may fall on another swift judgment how long will it take to figure out whether or not they're serious I said maybe in the first minute Trump's own level of seriousness is hard to measure so far we've seen insults and threats over nuclear war which have suggested anything but progress in the past best not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen a frightened dog barks louder I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotted with fire now the stage is set the capela hotel on sentosa Islands Sentosa meaning peace and tranquility perhaps at least the main will rub off on the fiery leaders when it comes to negotiations is said they shouldn't even enter the meeting room via the same door this is to avoid perceptions that one entered first and is waiting for the other it will all be choreographed through with the mr. president and mr. Kim each psy will try to add some steps to get advantage the question that hovers over many decisions is who will choose the menus what will they drink if Trump sir teetotal and then there's the touchy subject of who pays for what during the Pyeongchang Olympics the South Korean government set aside 2.6 million dollars for hotel meal and transportation expenses for North Korea although North Korea won't bring cheerleaders this time without question a top priority for both sides of security with the host country ramping up measures more stop and search paths for police and increase in surveillance cameras and even restricted airspace although this probably won't stop the two leaders having their own security entourage is some 3-thousand journalists are expected to cover the historic summits in Singapore it'll be a neutral environment for the two leaders to play nicely by diplomatic protocol if Trump gives it the time something good is going to happen it will happen fast I think within the first minute I'm not gonna waste my time I don't want to waste his time on the periphery of all this took time in time to introduce this special emoji for the summit we see what it looks like there my shoulder and businesses in Singapore vaults been gearing up for this historic meeting - but of money to be made restaurants are putting our special menus from tacos and burgers to cocktails and shots all related to the theme of the event and besides the summit related products there are also of course those impersonators the American and the North Korean ones women tell me I'm better looking for in the real town have a starving musician somebody's saw that I look like in Vanity Fair magazine I put on the suits got a haircut put a face book corner kim jeong-hoon looked alike within two weeks I got my first job and it has no stops in giving me a chance I've seen the pyramids of Egypt the Great Wall of China beautiful cities in the world three
