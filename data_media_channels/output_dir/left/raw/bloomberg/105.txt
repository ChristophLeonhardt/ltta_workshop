1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,859
So we're in the great room of a
seventeen point seven five million

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,259
dollar apartment we're on the 52nd floor
of a building called fifty-six Leonard

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,400
which is designed by a Swiss
architecture firm called Herzog & de Meuron

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,600
Now because we're on the 52nd
floor, we can see the entire curvature of

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,920
the island of Manhattan as it curves
down to the tip. We're in Tribeca on the

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,200
corner of Soho which is in one of the
most southernmost areas of the city

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,660
aside from the views you have the living
room, you have the dining room, and you have the kitchen

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,240
which was also designed by
Herzog and de Meuron

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,600
So this countertop is something that they colloquially call the baby grand countertop because

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,160
its shape piano, while the kitchen itself
seems like it's minimalist to the extent

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,960
that no one could ever actually use it.
The majority of the useful appliances

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,880
are hidden behind paneling.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,920
It's obviously open-concept

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,620
but at the same time this is a pretty informal
comfortable space

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,860
There's even a wood-burning fireplace
which is a total rarity in new construction

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,460
This is a fantastic view to wake up to
in the morning

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,760
you have these 14-foot high ceilings and these floor to
ceiling windows looking down onto the

18
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,720
southern tip of Manhattan and you could
see all these boats constantly I mean

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,240
you're looking at the daytime obviously
it's going to be spectacular at night

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,120
what the master bedroom also has, is its
own private balcony

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,920
it's one thing to see this view behind a plate-glass
window and it's something else to

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,400
actually be in the open air looking out.
You can literally hear the cars down below

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,020
You can see people moving but of
course this view is pretty much unbeatable

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,200
In this master bathroom you
have a really nice feature where the

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:11,130
medicine cabinets are hidden behind
these panels that pivot outwards

26
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,930
so that you can save space. Not that you
really are concerned with space if you

27
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,460
have this apartment given that the
bathroom alone is more or less the size

28
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,780
of a studio apartment

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,860
there are another three bedrooms aside from the master

30
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,120
all of them have the
same 14-foot high floor-to-ceiling windows

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,540
so this is what a 17.75 million
dollar apartment looks like

32
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,239
Now the price per square foot is around a
thousand dollars more than the average

33
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,379
luxury price per square foot in Manhattan
but of course the average luxury

34
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,599
apartment isn't on the fifty second
floor, isn't new construction and

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,240
doesn't really have these views.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,760
So is it worth it?

37
00:03:02,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess that's up to whoever has 17.75 million dollars to spend
