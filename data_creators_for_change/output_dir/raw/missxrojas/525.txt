44
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,799
would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed

his dark materials actually the story of

46
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,700

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,680
of e the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors know in the back says</font>

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,420
it's not supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feminist</font>

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,509
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> its but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it kind of comes</font>

50
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,880
across in some ways as one but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,610
again allows you to consider more other

52
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,299
points of view on story and I'm history

53
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,170
and religion and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I think</font>

54
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,729
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really well done but it's</font>

55
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,399
definitely not for younger readers its

much kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walking around everywhere</font>

73
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,770
in all these people who did things that

just feel like you're walking you're

76
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,930
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the ghost of that and</font>

77
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,220
that sounds really cheesy really nerdy

78
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,800
as well but I can't help it I love that
