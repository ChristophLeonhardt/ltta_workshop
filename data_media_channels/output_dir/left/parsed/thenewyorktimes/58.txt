I would describe Disney as
magical and fun and fantasy.
My name is Glynndana Shevlin.
And I’m 58 years old.
I’ve been there
almost 30 years,
which will be a big
anniversary for me.
Is it fun?
Is it a great job?
Yes.
But biggest misconception
is that we’re paid well.
I’m not alone.
Some of us are food insecure.
I usually wait and eat
my lunch around 3:30.
And that’s my first
meal of the day.
One out of 10 of us are
homeless of some sort
in the last two years.
Some of us are
sleeping in our cars.
I’ve done that a
couple of times.
I would describe Disneyland
as the happiest place
on earth.
And it’s definitely one of
the best jobs I’ve ever had.
It’s just a shame that
no one can survive on it.
I never thought,
especially being
a licensed cosmetologist,
that I would ever
be having to sleep in
my car, especially not
for a company like Disney.
And I’m not excited for when
my clients see this and see
that I’ve been
homeless, you know?
Because it doesn’t say
anything about my skill
level at all.
Chairman and chief executive
officer of the Walt Disney
Company, Bob Iger.
Thank you.
I never quite
envisioned it would
be this grand or this great.
If a corporation like
Disney has enough money
to pay its CEO
over $400 million
in a four-year
period, it damn well
has enough money to
pay its workers.
I just don’t understand how
people survive off the money
that Disneyland pays them.
Disney can do better
by taking care of us.
We have so much support
in the community.
These are just issues
that need to be resolved.
We work tirelessly.
On November 6th, vote
for a living wage.
Enough is enough.
Me in 1988 was able to afford
a one-bedroom apartment.
It is now 2018.
And I’m sleeping in a condo
with five other people.
When they find out
that I work at Disney
as a hairstylist
doing these wigs,
they assume I’m getting
paid at least 30 an hour.
But we absolutely do not.
To Bob Iger, just —
we love our jobs.
Just pay us right, you know?
We just want to survive.
