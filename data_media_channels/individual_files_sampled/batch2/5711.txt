Bob Miller's office rarely leaks but tonight we do have new information about how he's hunting evidence of Trump Russia collusion thanks to a newly released court filing it shows that when Muller sent agents to raid Paul Manafort home they were seeking evidence on the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting with those Russians linked to the Kremlin this dragnet couldn't snare two Trump family members Donald Trump jr. and Jared Kushner along with of course some of the other Russians who were there now this matters because Manta Ford's lawyers were arguing that Muller had basically dropped the collusion probe on him and instead was basically going after unrelated activities that predate 2016 well we have molars answer to that whole attack tonight and in two parts first his answer is a crime as a crime and they're not backing down on pre 2016 crimes but second molars new filing makes clear the FBI raid was also partly about probing collusion something that is sure to get Donald Trump juniors notice did you tell your father anything about that oh it was such a nothing there was nothing to tell as far as you know as far as this incidents concerned this is all of it this is everything this is everything if that's true Muller is clearly not taking their word for it he has the feds rummaging through people's offices and bedrooms to make sure and we're learning this raid included looking for evidence on a Russian businessman linked to Trump's work in Moscow whose son set up the infamous Trump Tower meeting now that is just what is cleared for the public there's other material in here this is newly released that is so sensitive you can see it's all redacted there's five pages that look like this that's the other stuff we don't even know why it's redacted I can't tell you what we are getting though in this filing is a rare look because of Paul Manafort challenging the legality of the search before dawn at the home of one-time Trump campaign chair Paul man afford a dozen armed FBI agents reportedly waking him up knocking on his bedroom door without warning a part of surprise is a tool for law enforcement there Robert molars an investigation seems to be escalate molars team of course is filing all this to show why the search they say was valid mana forts activities are in the spotlight and it's not just federal records it's also access to a storage unit obtained where he got consent from an employee of a mana for related business that apparently allegedly without mana for its knowledge which raises questions also evidence about his State of Mind about the crimes under investigation and you see the signature there Andrew Weissman that is Muller's deputy chief he is a feared prosecutor and he's known for flipping even the most difficult witnesses now this might be interesting to Donald Trump and his allies because if you watch the beat you know his own lawyer claims that the White House top lawyer Ty Cobb reached some kind of agreement to get Muller to keep Wiseman away from Trump Muller has agreed not to have wife involved in any investigation of the president who told you that that was the White House lawyer or a staff yet why was it Ty Cobb well I'm joined by Watergate special prosecutor Nick Ackerman former federal prosecutor Paul Butler Natacha portrayed a staff writer from The Atlantic and my exclusive guest tonight a former federal prosecutor US Attorney Damon Mark Martinez one of the 46 federal prosecutors who was fired by Trump he's running for Congress we're going to talk about that in a moment Nick your reaction my reaction is this is where I would expect I would hope that that's what he's doing that he should be looking at the Russian conspiracy and trying to find out exactly what happened at the June 9th meeting I would expect that would he be looking at are the computers that's part of the documents that were gathered here and he'd be looking at anything that was referring to any contacts with Russians to what happened at that June 9th meeting there are all kinds of things that could be found particularly on a computer but Paul that that June 9th meeting doesn't have anything to do with Paul mantle for its money laundering violations and all of that so what does that tell you well it has to do with Paul man afford having a bird's-eye view - what could possibly be conspiracy - the fall off the United States it doesn't get much juicier than this we get this shady Russian operative telling from jr. I got some dirt on Hilary Trump didn't do says I would love it and eight people at this meeting mother would love a really good high place snitch the big question I have about Manta Ford is why hasn't he pled guilty he's charged with money laundering failure to register those are really easy crimes to prove and again I'm sure mother would love to flip him Natasha the wider angle here is that basically when you look at the political side of this a lot of the early critics of Muller said oh well this is everything but collusion what does it say to you that the very things that Manta forts lawyers are doing are getting in some cases redacted but in other cases quite clear statements that they're still looking at a collusion evidence right and another big critique of molars critics was that they did this pre-dawn they had a no-knock warrant that was a very aggressive tactic and of course now molars office is pushing back against that saying that the warrant that they actually obtained to search upon Manta forthe residence was not a no-knock warrant so this is something that we now know that the investigation into collusion has always been running on a parallel track to all of the other investigations surrounding Trump and his aides this has never taken a back burner in terms of what Muller has been charged with investigating and I'll also note this is really interesting to me because it indicates that Muller's team had reason to believe that there were documents memorializing this meeting at Trump Tower even though Paul manna for Jared Kushner Donald Trump jr. have all said that it was really a nothing burger that nothing came out of it that they were barely even paying attention then they left after a number of minutes the FBI thought that perhaps it was important enough that Paul Manafort kept notes onic have documents relating to it and of course we know that he did in fact take notes during that meeting and those notes made cryptic references to Cyprus to the RNC - 133 million dollars we still don't really know exactly what those notes are in reference to but all signs are pointing to that meeting being an extremely important and pivotal moment of the campaign Damon you're the only person on this panel who has served as a federal prosecutor during the Trump administration until you were removed along with others what's your analysis tonight well if I could first say that I was fired by President Trump this is a very valuable insight into the investigation itself and I think this is an example of what the special prosecutor Moeller has been doing during his career is he starts at a rung and then he moves up the wrong towards individuals and what we see is by the specificity of the information that's come out is this is moving closer towards the President himself the inner circle and one of the things that's important about an investigation is you go where the facts lead you and if we know that they're asking for these facts we know where the direction of the facts are going the person overseeing all this Nick as I mentioned is Andrew Weissman I want to play a little more because these aren't all household names but this is someone that not only got Jay Goldberg's attention as I played in the lead but a Fox News folks have decided they don't like him either iseman is a notorious is notorious lawyer known for abusive tactics and for weaponizing the law in a ruthless and often unprincipled quest to convict he's a legal thug and has a long history of abusive tactics Weissman should resign immediately or be fired immediately Andrew Weissman not only needs to be fired but fully investigated so if you're close to Fox if that's what you're watching you're close to the president you are hearing this name more our people here at this table may have talked more about Bob Muller they are interested in Weisman he's busy with manna for and what do you make of this claim by Trump's lawyer who says he has current attorney-client privilege with the president that they are under the impression that Weitzman won't touch president Trump personally I can't believe there would be such an agreement by the special process special prosecutor's office I just can't believe they would do that and say we're going to divide up the office and certain people aren't going to in negate anything relating to the president that just doesn't happen I mean I think the comments that you're getting from Fox News just prove the point that Andrew Weissman is an effective prosecutor he knows what he's doing he's had a number of convictions he has a good record the things that they're saying are just part of the same pattern of Lies that they've been perpetrating on the Muller office every chance they get and the closer the office gets to actually the Trump people and to the President himself the more they're gonna keep attacking I mean the person that really ought to be investigated is Sean Hannity he's the one who was the the person whose name was brought up on the Kohen search warrant as a client and then claims no allegation of impropriety just for having a lawyer no but why did he even offer himself up as the client if there was nothing wrong the fact of the matter is that information will never see the light of day it can't be obtained during the free from the Freedom of Information Act and it's totally covered by grand jury secrecy so what is going on with Sean Hannity that he allows his name to be used as a client when he says he's not really a client he just asked a couple questions Paul another piece of information that's pretty notable here about about the federal investigation is past interviews with manna Ford and gates are listed here 2013 2014 2014 what does that tell you about how they have been of investigative interest so it says that they've been being watched for a long time we know that White's men again one of the Fox commentators called him legal thug I think that he will probably wear that as a badge of honor no daddy's hard core so we know that a bunch of these people have been victims of or targets of really hardcore investigative tactics like being surveyed having listening devices so we don't know how long these guys have been investigated they've been engaged in dubious activities with foreign operatives for Ohio leave with an illegal thug sounds a little bit like an oxymoron maybe a little bit I don't know I mean you can't have legal thug passion I imagine it just depends on what you're into Natasha when you look at all this do you think at any point with the strategy and you've been covering the case very closely Manta for its lawyers decide to back off what you might call the legitimacy or jurisdictional attacks on Muller well they should because at every turn molar has come back and said actually no we have the authority to investigate this we have the authority to execute the search warrant and of course the entire argument that Paul Manafort made that Rosenstein gave him overly broad and you know mandate in order to investigate anything rising out of Donald Trump's campaign and its ties to Russia was was also he also shot that back because it turns out that Rosen Stein wrote a memo last year giving Muller explicit permission to investigate Manta fort on the question of whether or not he colluded with Russia so that was a huge blow to pull man apart because obviously it shows that that Muller had the authority to do exactly what he's been doing and of course man aboard is at the very center of this question of whether or not the campaign colluded with Russia and manna ports ascendance to the campaign coincided with some of the most important Russia related events during the election including that the release of the hacked DNC emails the Trump Tower meeting and of course you know he got out stood because of these reports about his continued ties to Viktor Yanukovych so these are Paul Manafort has always been at the center of this and it would be very very unusual and bizarre if they weren't putting their best arguably their best prosecutor prosecutor on Andy Weitzman in order to investigate this further because it goes back years and years and years and there's a lot there now Damon I mentioned that you were fired by Trump you're a former federal prosecutor you're running now for Congress and you have a sort of an alternative fan fiction apprentice themed advertisement that just came out in your race let's look at that wouldn't you say you crossed a line I'd say I did what was right for New Mexico yes I go mr. president I approve this message because when I'm in Congress you're next to get fired what are you saying there what I'm saying is that this president president Trump should serve no longer no no he should serve in office no longer than one than any date necessary according to the Constitution right now what we see is we have an investigation going on by Special Counsel Moeller that needs to be respected and supported also it looks it appears that the evidence there's enough there for in speech meant hearings in in the house and then ultimately it also looks like there's grounds for the American people to vote this president of office but if I could just say what I was tongue-tied before is that this president should not stay in office one day longer than the Constitution demands but Daymond I wonder although people do all kinds of things in political ads to get attention do you risk confusing the issue by positioning your critique of President Trump and the potential issue that you just raised of removal and combining that with him firing you which under traditional US attorney rules is often happens as you know when new presidents come into power no no I don't and let me tell you what's at the heart of this is the rule of law the way that the US Attorney's the 46 US Attorney's me being included one of them were ushered out was it was wrong the way it was done the what we represented to the president was we represented a threat this threat was individuals who would counter him who would hold him accountable and the way that I found out on March 10th was I came back to the office about 1:30 in the afternoon and I was handed piece of paper and I learned from that that through the Washington Post that we were out I had been under the understanding that I was going to have a smooth transition time to put things in place so that investigation so that prosecutions should be carried out and in an orderly fashion that wasn't given to me and I have to believe that that happened throughout the nation throughout the United States with the other 545 US Attorney's involved hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
