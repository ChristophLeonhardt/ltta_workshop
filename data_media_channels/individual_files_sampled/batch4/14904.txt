first off sorry I've done my normal location my great backdrop and sound but I'm on location filming a great guys movie but I'm not gonna leave you hang it for the next movie on the list brothers what we do in life echoes in eternity nothing gets me more fired up than a juiced-up Australian trying to do something of a Spanish accent while beating the living tar out of the most obvious social justice warrior villain of all time gladiator won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2000 but what's more impressive is that it comes in at number 2 for the rebel masculine movie countdown let's go this movie is the perfect epic showing the difference between earning and being entitled this is shown by one of the greatest dudes of all time Maximus and the eternal soy boy that is common us in the movie now this just really is an epic movie I mean it is the Best Picture Ridley Scott directed the mess out of it Don Zimmer has a score that literally makes your heart pound out of its chest and there are some absolutely fantastic performances from start to finish and all that is absolutely deserving of praise that is not the only reason that this movie after watching it makes you want to go burn every copy of Star Wars the last Jedi it is also because who Maximus is as a man how he treats his fellow brothers how he Orient's himself in the world by way of his principles and his epic showdown with the ultimate male feminist communists played by Joaquin Phoenix first let's look at Maximus how he treats his fellow man he earns their respect that is not just by having one of the greatest masculine names of all time in a movie Maximus no he becomes the man that all of his brothers would fight and die for who would literally follow him into hell if he asked him to what is so fascinating this movie the way they show Maximus and lay he earns that respect is exactly the way George Washington actually lived his life Washington is arguably one of the greatest leaders in the past 500 years but why is because his stature the political cunning or lavish living know he was on the front line he led the charges and he forgot his living quarters to sleep with his troops in the trenches he was one of them he didn't put himself above them they elevated him to that position Maximus does the exact same thing he's with each individual man on the field he leads the charges he earns their respect he does not demand it communist on the other hand demands respect under penalty of law he manipulates people why does he do this because he feels entitled to it because he's a king it's not his fault he's not as brave as everyone else who are they to lecture him he's above them basically communists just sucks another reason why gladiator is such an awesome movie and the lead character Maximus is so great is because of the principles he follows Maximus is not motivated by greed or power whatever he just wants to glinda life as a free man with his family he serves his country to ensure that his family will have that freedom they can have that life together so much so that in this movie actually turns down at first to be Caesar to lead the entire Rome because I just wants to go back to his family now obviously that's a made-up story that'd be a really hard thing to turn down but if you look at George Washington that actually happened in fact when King George George Washington's actual enemy heard that Washington was gonna forego the kingdom basically and just go stay with his wife and just live a normal life working the land King George actually said if he does that then he is the greatest man in the world and Washington did turn down being the president went back home before he was drugged back by the people because they wanted him to lead them this speaks so true to the most noble examples of men who lead the guys that would forego power for the greater good this is so rare and embodied by these two great characters and this characteristic is so good for leader that is why Maximus is chosen because he does not care about the politics he's not corruptible because of what the government has done now in Rome being powerful over the people he would give the power back to the people that is the whole goal of gladiator to give the power to the people and not to these crazy bureaucratic politicians now the other hand communist is so enraged that his father would not just give him the keys to kingdom that he actually kills him and he's like father you must not love me because you're not giving me what I want I mean communists even admits that he has no traits that make him capable to lead Rome and yet he's like if you don't give me this then you don't love me dad does that sound like every SJW youtube compilation failed video ever I want this so it's your fault brothers what we do in life can echo an eternity thanksgivin are always forgotten no one cares about the accomplishments of a handout transcendent men of the past are remembered because of the reputation and accomplishments they earned respect from the sacrifices they make and the legend and the lore from the lives that they live be like Maximus in Washington not a social justice warrior who is only a warrior in their own imagination who in a real fight would have to stab you in the back and still lose because of the limp wristed pansy they really are gladiator is an awesome movie go check it out it's still great to this day I'm pen days darling and another fantastic news you can now download the rebel up and take me with you wherever you go to get exclusive
