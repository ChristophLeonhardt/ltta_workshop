JILLIAN: WELCOME BACK. DONALD TRUMP'S STORING APPROVAL RATINGS SHAKING DEMOCRATS CONFIDENT IN THE BLUE WAVE THEY WERE EXPECTING THIS NOVEMBER. VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS IN PRIMARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM THESE RESULTS. THE EDITOR IN CHIEF, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, GOT A LOT TO GET TO. LET'S JUMP IN WITH PENNSYLVANIA. HOW DO YOU THINK THE REDISTRICTING MAPS WILL CHANGE ANYTHING? REDISTRICTING WILL HELP DEMOCRATS PICK UP SEATS. IF THEY HAVE A PERFECT DAY IN PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATS PICK UP SIX SEATS, A QUARTER OF WHAT THEY NEED. A BIG DEAL. FIRST PLACE TO GO DISTRICT 1, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, TWO DEMOCRATS TAKING HIM ON. THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP, THE REDESIGNED DISTRICT A DEMOCRATIC WOMAN, USED TO BE A REPUBLICAN, SHE IS A VETERAN, COULD BE IDEAL FOR DISTRICTS LIKE THIS BUT SCOTT WALLACE PUT 21/$2 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY IN. YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THAT NAME, HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A VERY LEFT-LEANING VICE PRESIDENT UNDER FDR. IF HE WINS REPUBLICANS HAVE A SHOT TO PULL OFF A SURPRISE IN THIS DISTRICT BECAUSE WALLACE IS TOO FAR LEFT. JILLIAN: ONE OF THESE DISTRICT THAT WAS LEANING REPUBLICAN, NOW PERHAPS LEANING DEMOCRAT. 7, YOU HAVE A DISTRICT TYPE OF RACE, JOHN MORGANELLA, THE DA RUNNING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION AS A PRO DONALD TRUMP ANTI-IMMIGRATION CONSERVATIVE. RESIDENTS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS, A LOT OF ADS, ANYBODY BUT HIM, HE IS SO STRONG FOR DONALD TRUMP JILLIAN: A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY HE HAS A CHANCE. NAME RECOGNITION. SUSAN WILDE, OPEN SEAT RACES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, WOMEN WON 80% OF THE TIME, SHE IS THE MOST CONVENTIONAL DEMOCRAT, THE HOPE FOR REPUBLICANS IS THIS DISTRICT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CIVIL WAR GIVING THE GOP A CHANCE. JILLIAN: WHAT ABOUT PA 13? EIGHT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, WHOEVER WINS, THE PRIMARY, LIKELY TO BE ON TOP. JOHN JOYCE, THE REPUBLICAN MAINSTREAM PARTNERSHIP, THE ESTABLISHMENT, OPPOSED BY THE CLUB FOR GROWTH. THERE IS THAT INTERNAL BATTLE, DON'T EXPECT A LOT TO AFFECT THE OUTCOME IN NOVEMBER BUT WILL AFFECT THE KIND OF CONGRESSMAN THE DISTRICT HAS NEXT JANUARY. JILLIAN: WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE RACE? NOT A LOT OF SURPRISE, TO WIN THE PRIMARY, HE IS GOING TO HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE IN NOVEMBER. PENNSYLVANIA WENT NARROWLY FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016. CASEY IS EXPECTED TO HAVE THE EDGE. JILLIAN: PENNSYLVANIA NOT THE ONLY ONE, NEBRASKA DEALING WITH THIS AS WELL. WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE? THE RACE TO WATCH HIS NEBRASKA TOO. BRAD ASHFORD CAME SECOND, WON THE DISTRICT A COUPLE ELECTIONS AGO, LOST NARROWLY IN 2016, HE WANTS A REMATCH BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A CIVIL WAR GOING. VERY CONSERVATIVE BEING CHALLENGED BY MORE PROGRESSIVE WOMAN, ASHFORD IS THE PRIMARY, SEE HOW MUCH SUPPORT HE HAS TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE HE IS GOING IN THE FALL. JILLIAN: IDAHO HITTING THE POLLS, TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. IDAHO, WE WILL HAVE A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IN NOVEMBER. THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE? MOST OF THE SEASON WE EXPECTED RAUL LABRADOR, FOUNDER OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, TO BE THE NOMINEE. HE IS STILL FAVORED BUT NOT AS CLEAR THAT HE WILL WIN. NOT A LOT OF POLLING OUT THERE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT. JILLIAN: THE OREGON GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. THE FRONT RUNNER HERE FOR REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR A LONG TIME, ALL VYING TO TAKE ON INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT KATE BROWN. I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS GOING TO WIN BUT NO MATTER WHO WINS KATE
