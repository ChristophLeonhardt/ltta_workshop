a group of French butchers are demanding
police protection they're claiming
they've become a terror target at the
hands of vegan activists they accuse
animal rights campaigners of vandalizing
shops across the country and spreading
fear among meat lovers
don't believe I came here and willing to
open the shop and get repaired and if so
the window had been smashed today at
first I thought it was Randall is more
robbery but then I saw the writer and
realized it was an attack by vegans
the post-assessment without suspicious
speciesism refers to humans who think
they are superior to animals
by salsa Taco Bell chime oh now they're
attacking building who are they going to
target next the people who work there
and if the police do not protect us
things could escalate
now it's beepings were hiding but then
at some point that butchers would get
angry too and then it could get serious
