1
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:11,913
>> I DISCOURAGE ANY DISCUSSION

2
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:12,814
OF IMPEACHMENT.

3
00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,616
ON THE POLITICAL SIDE, I THINK

4
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,251
IT'S A GIFT TO THE REPUBLICANS

5
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:16,918
TO TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT.

6
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:19,888
>> THE LAST THING THIS COUNTRY

7
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:20,655
NEEDS IS IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS

8
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:21,489
THAT MOVE FORWARD AS A MATTER OF

9
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,224
COURSE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE THE

10
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:23,591
PRESIDENT.

11
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,059
>> YOU CAN'T JUMP THE GUN AND

12
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,394
DETERMINE THAT SOMEBODY SHOULD

13
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,695
BE IMPEACHED WHEN YOU'RE GOING

14
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,330
TO BE VOTING ON THE IMPEACHMENT

15
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,631
ISSUE.

16
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:33,668
IT IS TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT

17
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:34,068
IMPEACHMENT.

18
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,370
>> THEY'RE ALL LYING.

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,105
THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BASE

20
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,607
WANTS THE PRESIDENT IMPEACHED.

21
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:41,476
JOHN NICHOLS WRITES THIS SORT OF

22
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:42,744
PIECE ASKING WHY ARE SO MANY

23
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:44,279
DEMOCRATS AFRAID OF IMPEACHMENT?

24
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,815
JOHN NICHOLS JOINS US TONIGHT.

25
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:47,949
JOHN, I DON'T THINK WITH YOU ON

26
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:48,516
MUCH.

27
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:49,617
NORMALLY I'D BE HERE ARGUING

28
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:54,689
WITH YOU, BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A

29
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,557
SINCERE COMPLIMENT, YOUR PIECE

30
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,292
WAS HONEST.

31
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,928
THIS IS THE PRESCRIBED REMEDY

32
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,529
FOR A PRESIDENT THAT'S BELIEVED

33
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:02,730
TO GONE OFF THE RAILS.

34
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,331
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

35
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:07,035
YOU DO.

36
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:07,936
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT IT.

37
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:08,803
WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE NOT

38
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,171
WILLING TO ADMIT IT?

39
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,940
>> I THINK THEY'RE PLAYING A

40
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,640
POLITICAL GAME.

41
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,209
YOU ASSUME THEY WOULD IMPEACH IF

42
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,376
THEY GOT POWER.

43
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:15,977
I'M NOT SURE OF THAT.

44
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,078
>> HUH.

45
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:20,849
>> I THINK THAT THERE IS A

46
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,750
TEPIDNESS ABOUT USING

47
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,053
IMPEACHMENT AS A LIVE INSTRUMENT

48
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:27,155
OF THE CONSTITUTION, HOLDING A

49
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,590
PRESIDENT WHO HAS, AS YOU

50
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,526
SUGGEST, GONE OFF THE RAILS, WHO

51
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,728
I WOULD SUGGEST ABUSES THE

52
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,930
OFFICE TO ACCOUNT.

53
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,632
BUT CLEARLY AT THIS POINT

54
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:40,168
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON

55
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:42,537
MEMBERS OF THE PARTY, AND ON

56
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,839
FOLKS TO NOT TALK ABOUT

57
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:45,240
IMPEACHMENT.

58
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,276
MY SENSE IS THAT IT'S

59
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:48,676
PROBLEMATIC.

60
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,945
IF YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE

61
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,480
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

62
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,748
HAS ABUSED HIS OFFICE, IF YOU

63
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,516
ARE SUGGESTING THAT HE'S DOING

64
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,452
THINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY

65
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:58,987
IMPEACHABLE, BUT THEN YOU SAY,

66
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:01,356
WELL, BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT

67
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:03,291
IMPEACHMENT, THAT CREATES AN

68
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,093
UNREALITY TO THE DISCOURSE, AND

69
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,428
FRANKLY IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE.

70
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,130
I THINK THAT, A, A DISCUSSION OF

71
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,864
IMPEACHMENT IS HEALTHY.

72
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,766
I THINK IT'S NECESSARY.

73
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:15,803
BUT B, IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT

74
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,272
I THINK POLITICIANS OF BOTH

75
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,040
PARTIES TEND TO FEAR TOO MUCH.

76
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,576
>> WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT --

77
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,345
AGAIN, I'M NOT FOR IT, BUT IT'S

78
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:24,746
ABOVEBOARD.

79
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:25,847
IT TAKES PLACE IN PUBLIC.

80
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,082
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR PUBLIC

81
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:28,783
ARGUMENTS.

82
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:29,584
INSTEAD THEY'RE SUBVERTING

83
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,186
ENTIRE FEDERAL AGENCIES, AND

84
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,055
LIBERALS SHOULD BE CONCERNED

85
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:34,722
ABOUT THIS.

86
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,291
IF YOU HAVE A CASE, BE A MAN

87
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,594
ABOUT IT, SAY WHAT IT IS, VOTERS

88
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:42,664
CAN ASSESS IT.

89
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,933
THAT'S WHY THE FOUNDERS PUT

90
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,801
ITING IN THE DOCUMENTS.

91
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,937
WHY WOULD THEY PRETEND IT'S OFF

92
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,071
THE TABLE?

93
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,572
IT SEEMS SO FELINE AND

94
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:51,940
DISHONEST.

95
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,777
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE

96
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:56,644
PRETENDING, TUCKER.

97
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,313
WE'LL SEE IF DEMOCRATS GET

98
00:02:58,313 --> 00:02:59,314
CONTROL OF THE HOUSE WHETHER

99
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:00,048
THEY WOULD MOVE ON IT.

100
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,683
BACK IN THE GEORGE W. BUSH

101
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,251
PRESIDENCY THERE WAS A

102
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,786
SIGNIFICANT AGITATION AT THE

103
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,553
GRASSROOTS OF THE DEMOCRATIC

104
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,588
PARTY, AND FRANKLY BEYOND IT,

105
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,592
AMONG A LOT OF FOLKS, FOR

106
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,328
IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT BUSH.

107
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:13,962
>> I REMEMBER.

108
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,330
>> I KNOW YOU DO, BECAUSE YOU

109
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,030
FOLLOWED IT.

110
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,333
NANCY PELOSI CAME TO POWER IN

111
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,469
2007, AND ONE OF HER FIRST

112
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:24,372
SIGNALS WAS ABLE THE

113
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:24,405
SIGNALS WAS OBLE THE

114
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:24,572
SIGNALS WAS OFFE THE

115
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:24,605
SIGNALS WAS OFF TTHE

116
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:25,273
SIGNALS WAS OFF THEE

117
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:25,606
SIGNALS WAS OFF THE TABLE.

118
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,041
THIS IS A COMPLEXITY ON THIS

119
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:27,342
ISSUE.

120
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:29,644
WHERE IT GOES BACK TO, YOU AND I

121
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,245
BOTH KNOW, IS THE CLINTON

122
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,480
IMPEACHMENT, AND THERE'S A SENSE

123
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,616
THAT THE CLINTON IMPEACHMENT LED

124
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,485
TO POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR

125
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:37,885
REPUBLICANS.

126
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,622
IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT IT IT,

127
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:44,792
THE REPERCUSSIONS ARE NOT AS

128
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,527
MUCH AS PEOPLE ASSUME.

129
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,629
THE NIXON IMPEACHMENT, NOT

130
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,031
BROUGHT TO FRUITION, BUT A

131
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,834
SERIOUS MOMENT, THERE WEREN'T

132
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:53,801
POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE

133
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,069
DEMOCRATS IN THAT.

134
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,504
I DO THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

135
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,307
POLITICIANS ON BOTH SIDES,

136
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,709
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, WHO

137
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,311
AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY MOMENTS --

138
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,980
AND FRANKLY AVOID OPENING UP THE

139
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,981
DISCUSSIONS WHEN THEY SHOULD BE

140
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:07,348
DOING SO.

141
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,583
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY.

142
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,650
THEY'RE AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY.

143
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,754
I HAVE TO SAY -- AGAIN, I DON'T

144
00:04:12,754 --> 00:04:14,889
THINK I AGREE WITH YOU ON

145
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:15,823
ANYTHING, INCLUDING WHAT TO

146
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,325
ORDER THE DINNER, BUT I

147
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,628
APPRECIATE THE HONESTY OF THE

148
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:26,567
ACTUAL LEFT, YOUR

149
