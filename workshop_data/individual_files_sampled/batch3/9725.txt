ANGLE. ♪ ♪ IS HER CABLE COMPETITORS ARE DEVOTING HOURS OF COVERAGE TODAY TO THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS ABOUT STORMY DANIELS, VOTERS I THINK ARE TUNING HIM OUT. WHY? BECAUSE THE VOTERS ARE SMARTER THAN THE MEDIA THINKS THEY ARE, AS USUAL. AMERICANS OUTSIDE THE LEFTIST ACTIVIST BUBBLE ARE FOCUSING ON ISSUES THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT THEIR DAILY LIVES. POCKETBOOK ISSUES. THE STOCK MARKET JUMPED 500 POINTS TODAY, THAT IS GOOD FOR YOUR 401(K). THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT THERE ARE 7 MILLION JOB OPENINGS CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT IS SURGING THEM ALL FANTASTIC NEWS. AMERICANS ALSO SEE SOME TROUBLE ON THE HORIZON AS WELL. LAWLESSNESS AT THE BORDER, NO SOCIETY SHOULD TOLERATE. WE HAVE ANOTHER MASS OF PEOPLE, AS MANY AS 4,000 I AM TOLD. ANOTHER SO-CALLED MIGRANT CARAVAN MAKING ITS WAY FROM HONDURAS TO THE UNITED STATES. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH. WE HAVE THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION LAWS IN THE WORLD. THE WORLD LAUGHS AT US, BUT WE ARE GETTING THEM CHANGED. WE NEED SOME MORE REPUBLICANS. Laura: I WILL SAY. FOR MANY YEARS VOTERS HAVE BEEN TELLING POLITICIANS, ENFORCE THE BORDER AND CLOSE IMMIGRATION LOOPHOLES. IN FACT EVEN ON THE ISSUE OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, THE COUNTRY IS NOT CLAMORING FOR BIG INCREASES. CHECK THIS OUT. ONLY 28% OF AMERICANS WANT IMMIGRATION LEVELS INCREASED. 29% OF AMERICANS WANT THEM DECREASED. OF COURSE MOST POLITICIANS CONTINUE TO JUST IGNORE THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE, SO WHAT THEY DO IS CONTINUE TO EXPAND THINGS LIKE DISTANT RELATIVE CHAIN MIGRATION. THEY REFUSE TO ALLOCATE MONEY TO THE BUILDING OF THE ENTIRE WALL OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY REFUSE TO PASS LEGISLATION TO ALLOW FOR IMMEDIATE BORDER TURN BACKS OF ANYONE CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. AND OF COURSE, DEMOCRATS ARE AGAINST ALL RULES. DONALD TRUMP WON THE PRESIDENCY IN LARGE PART BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T EXPECT THE STATUS QUO ON IMMIGRATION. AS USUAL, HE WAS FIVE STEPS AHEAD OF MOST EVERY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ON THE ISSUE. IN JULY THEY FOUND THAT AMERICANS IDENTIFIED IMMIGRATION HAS THE TOP ISSUE FOR THEM GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS. LAST MONTH IT WAS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TIED WITH JUST GENERAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT A FOCUS ON THE TYPICAL ISSUE OF CHILD SEPARATION, A PRACTICE OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW ENDED, THAT THAT WOULD TURN OUT TO VOTERS AND GET DEMOCRATS OR LATINO VOTERS REALLY EXCITED TO GET OUT THERE. I DON'T THINK IT IS WORKING FOR THEM. REMEMBER BACK IN 2016, AT THE LATINO VOTER TURNOUT DID NOT INCREASE. DESPITE TRUMP'S PUSH FOR THE WALL AND A LOT OF STRONGER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. OF COURSE HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE THEMSELVES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, AND THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. DITTO FOR BLACK AMERICANS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS THE SECOND CARAVAN DRAMA UNFOLDS, IT TURNS OUT THAT SOME ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE WAKING UP TO THE WISDOM OF TRUMP. IT MAKES THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE MORE ON TRUMP'S TERMS. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO COME TO AMERICA. WE CAN HAVE RULES OF WHO COMES. WHERE IS MEXICO? THEY NEED TO HELP US. LAST TIME I CHECKED YOU JUST CAN'T WALK FROM GUATEMALA TO HEAR WITHOUT GOING TO MEXICO. Laura: OH, YES, THE PRESIDENT WARNED THE PRESIDENT OF HONDURAS COME WITH THE LARGE CARAVAN HEADS INTO THE U.S. AND DOES NOT STOP, HE WILL CUT OFF FOREIGN AID. VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAS WARNED THEM ABOUT HONDURAS, GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR TO TELL THEIR PEOPLE DO NOT MAKE THE DANGEROUS TREK TO AMERICA. THE U.S. WILL NOT TOLERATE THIS BLATANT DISREGARD FOR OUR BORDER AND SOVEREIGNTY. BY THE WAY, HONDURAS IS ON TRACK TO RECEIVE $65.7 MILLION IN FOREIGN AID FROM THE U.S. IN THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR, 2019. BACK TO THE MIDTERMS. AS FRUSTRATED AS SO MANY AS LSR, THE CAUSE MAY BE TOTALLY LOST IF THE OPEN BORDER DEMOCRATS TAKE THE HOUSE WHILE THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE ABOLISHING THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION GANGS COME MS-13, DEMOCRATS WANT TO ABOLISH I.C.E. WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. STARTING BY REPLACING I.C.E WITH SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS OUR MORALITY. WE CAN REPLACE IT AND WE CAN REPLACE IT WITH A HUMANE AGENCY THAT IS DIRECTED TOWARDS SAFE PASSAGE. Laura: SAFE PASSAGE? EVERYBODY COME ON IN. THEY ARE NOT ALONE OF COURSE. THERE ARE A LOT MORE LIKE THEM THAT BELIEVE THE SAME THING. AGAIN, THEY COULD NOT BE CLEAR FOR THE MIDTERM VOTERS. THERE SO MUCH ON THE LINE FOR AMERICA. WE'LL TRUMP GET THE FUNDING FOR HIS WALL? WILL THE MASS MIGRATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL AMERICA WE STOPPED AT ALL? EVER! WILL TRAVESTY SUCH AS BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP FINALLY BE ENDED? WILL WE MANDATE TO PENALIZE BUSINESSES WHO GAIN THE SYSTEM TO KEEP AMERICAN WAGES LOW? OF THIS MY FRIENDS YOU CAN BE SURE, YOUR VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION WILL HAVE ZERO IMPACT AND ZERO INFLUENCE ON A HOUSE DOMINATED BY DEMOCRATS WHO WANT TO REPLACE YOU, THE AMERICAN VOTERS, WITH NEWLY AMNESTY TO CITIZENS. AN EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF MIGRANTS. IF REPUBLICANS CHOOSE TO UNITE BEHIND THE PRESIDENTS IMMIGRATION POLICY, THE WAY THEY JUST DID IN THE KAVANAUGH FIGHT.
