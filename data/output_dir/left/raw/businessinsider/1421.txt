00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,519
I think if the cartels can vote they

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,380
would vote for Donald Trump his policies

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,610
to build this wall that could raise the

price of drugs in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States it</font>

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,940
won't do much to reduce consumption

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,529
because people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are addicted to drugs</font>

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,119
on the whole aren't very responsive to

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,160
prices so all it will succeed in doing

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,170
is inflating the value of the criminal

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,000
economy it will mean bigger profits for

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,920
the cartels he talks about to crack down

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,630
at the border but crossing the border is

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,130
what they do best it's where their

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,290
advantage lies that's where they make

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,059
their money that's why drugs cost so
