the Hindukush mountain range a wonder of nature and a giver of life it has the highest concentration of snow and glaces outside the polar region and is Afghanistan's main source of water but it's under threat there has been a rapid retreat and melting of glaciers at the current rate they will disappear by 2050 as I said vital resources if there is no water there is no life so if something happened and something unfortunate had happened of course this is the loss of human being melting glaciers are not the only problem 40 years of conflict and neglect have taken a toll on an antiquated water and sanitation system just 27 percent of the population has access to clean water only 20 percent in rural areas this is the way most of cobbles poor get their water stand pipes open for a few hours every day the water system was designed in the 1980s to cope with a population of a few hundred thousand today nearly six million people live in the capital I go to school at six o'clock in the morning and when I return I have to carry water buckets to my home up the hillside and for that reason I'm too tired to do my homework lack of education has led to poor hygiene people defecate in rivers and few boil the water they drink most rivers are contaminated every day raw sewage flows into the Kabul River from 6000 channels and it's having serious health consequences 25 percent of the deaths of children under the age of five are due to water contamination and bad sanitation 10,000 children die every year because of diarrhea and waterborne infection and disease account for more deaths in Afghanistan than bombs and bullets 40 years ago the population was 13 million today it is around 36 million causing a huge thirst but a shortage of reservoirs and pumping stations means just 30 percent of water is retained improvements are being made in Kabul this pumping station is part of an 80 million dollar German project to increase the number of connected homes from 10,000 to a hundred thousand Marbury we still need technical and financial support from the international community in the sectors such as improving water management and for increasing capacity we also need support for executing technical issues you can only supply water if you have it and because of the melting glaciers Afghanistan has just over 30 years to come up with a solution to its predicted water loss before nature turns off the tap Tony Berkeley al Jazeera Kabul
