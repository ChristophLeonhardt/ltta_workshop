J Wiley was smiling as he walked out of a Seoul courtroom out of jail and back to his life as vice chairman of Samsung Electronics after a year in prison an appeals court freed him and dismissed most of the corruption charges against him I think if you're rich you can get out for economic reasons overall I think it was a good decision that most don't have that you call Lee says he's used his time in jail to reflect again I feel very sorry to everyone for not showing my best side and it has been a really precious time for a year reflecting on myself the first thing he did after being released was visit his father in hospital he's been incapacitated for three years prosecutors say it was Lee strategy to succeed his father as chairman of Samsung Electronics that got him in trouble he's one character of many in South Korea's largest corruption scandal in recent memory it led to millions of Koreans protesting and the impeachment of president Park geun-hye last year prosecutors say Lee paid or promised to pay 40 million dollars to approve a merger of two samsung units he considered that important to a succession many people got angry about this political economic ties and you know the political power of the president he usually to a personal advantage and the economic power of Samsung Group uses the kind of opportunity to take the personal advantage or at the cost of Korean society many hoped Lee's conviction last year would usher in a new era of accountability for big corporations and politicians now some are wondering if once again it's simply business as usual good to come ESO didn't go the decision by the lower court and the appellate court are so different I'm not sure what is good or bad but yeah I'm suspicious about how the decision can be so different Li's lawyers say they'll launch an appeal to dismiss the remaining charges against their client now people are looking at the developments in Lee's case and wondering how it will impact former president Pok she's in jail and in the midst of a corruption trial of her own a verdict is expected in the coming months Natacha guy named Al Jazeera soul
