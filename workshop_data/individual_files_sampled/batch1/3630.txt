one thing that drives me crazy is a what I call deficit fetishism nobody would look at a corporation and say look at this firm look at the debt it as anybody looking at a firm would say what are the Asik's what are the liabilities what's the net worth you want to look at at liabilities only functions with assets but somehow when you come to government you don't do that and so you get worried if the government increases its dad even if it's to invest in infrastructure and people and technology that makes the economy stronger people get worried about the debt my answer is no if if you've increased the liability but you've increased it in assets that have a high return we can borrow at minus at at close to zero now and with inflation of two percentage so like minus two real percent minus one real percent you can borrow a minus percent you get a twenty thirty percent real return it's foolish not to make those investments so that kind of is this a deficit fetishism especially coming out of wall street that is supposed to know about finance and so when I see people who claim to be financial experts who clearly don't understand economics that makes me crazy
