hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter LaBelle if you're a political news junkie then you're probably experiencing a serious overdose consider the recent NATO meeting Trump's visit to the UK so-called Russia Gate heats up and the Trump Putin summit we discuss at all Iran crosstalk crosstalking summitry i'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security annals we also have Aric Krause he is an independent political risk analyst and we have exactly Amuro he is the founder of the center of political strategic analysis strata locate illan crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it Erik there's too much to talk about this week as I said in my introduction that we are kind of overdosing on all of this here I think what's really most important we can get some up over the last few days of Trump's visit to NATO and then to the UK his reception and did he achieve very much mr. Trump is a bit of a loose cannon and he likes keeping people off balance he will one day give a warm warm praise and the next day absolutely tear them a bit that in the UK Kay but miss you've gotta understand there's and there's method to his madness mr. Trump is a traveling salesman mr. Trump has one real interest in life which is to enhance American sales of arms and energy he wants all the Europeans to massively overspend on defense defense against whom we don't okay okay so I can give that to my point here mark so it's not it's not about security yeah at least not from Trump's point of view okay and I think the contradiction of Trump pointing out that Germany is talking about Russian threat while they're also cutting billion-dollar gas deals with Russia points out the internal contradiction on that whether Trump intended it or not but I agree with Eric absolutely Trump is as a businessman right and he doesn't think in terms of geopolitics or American hegemony he thinks in terms of pluses and minuses of a balance sheet and he sees that there's a huge trade deficit between the US and the EU therefore he wants to correct that any way he can and but yes that's his but what is that happening because Xavier right after you know dentally the bluster of it all I mean Trump called himself a stable genius which is quite remarkable for a politician to say I must say but McCrone came right out afterwards and said what we really didn't agree to anything okay I mean again especially by himself but I would like to underline the fact that Berlin and Paris are always talking about create an independent Europe of defense so I was waiting the moment when Angela may occur or Michael are going to answer to tramp so we don't want to pay more so get back your NATO and we are going to bite our at least independent European your pair of defense a big survey if there were to come to pass if that were to come up at the pass I tend to think they'd be a reassessment of threats don't you think us and then they'd say well do we really need to spend this kind of money here I mean this is the wrinkle right here Eric is that if you really step it back and say what is a real the real threat to Europe then they're their defense would be commensurate to that not with the NATO paradigm is today is the fundamental pravakara diction of NATO it was an alliance against the Warsaw Pact it was meant to fight conventional war and as always generals were fighting the last war not the next war and was meant to fight a conventional land war with tanks and artillery in East in Eastern Europe now this is about as likely as a replay of the War of the Roses or the 30 years where it's not going to happen the next third world war it's gonna last 45 minutes and we won't have time to get it on TV so basically there is no real purpose the purpose is to keep the arms military I mean you know the thing is is that mark you know I can understand where snake oak comes from there's a lot of people that work there and a lot of people that have jobs there but the real problem here is and again Trump is kind of right for the wrong reason is that the NATO is unable at least the European members are unable to reimagine a defense security architecture they're satisfied with what they have now well I think that's part of the problem is that it is into defense architecture at all Richard sack was said he called it a fateful geopolitical paradox that NATO exists primarily to manage the risks by its own existence not wonderful that is that is if you go by the standard rationale collective security keep Russia out etc NATO hasn't been used that way in decades NATO has become a political figure a tool for US military hegemony around the world Jens Stoltenberg pointed it out himself in response exactly the head of NATO pointed out exactly this week he says that if you its European part of NATO's military usage to the United States is in perception that the use of US military force around the world becomes much more acceptable in the rise of the rest of the world when it's done through the filter of a coalition within NATO it is a political feel and it's been pushed aside you have to remember that before the Ukraine crisis the main goal of NATO if you look at the meeting in 2012-2013 was the fight against piracy also you have a big Somalia right military island for that and I couldn't agree more that it's a political institution the militarization of your open space by putting some US bases is a way to politically control all space and you know it's it's really no more military the thing is to say you know you know I'm always a big advocate of sovereignty here but you know under the NATO paradigm the NATO countries are surrendering a lot of their sovereignty here but the way Trump is doing it it's all of package deal as we've said before energy tariffs and security for him it's all one thing okay and once you start fiddling with one of those three then it starts to unravel and this is what the elites Europe do not want to have happens if that's the Coralie only family we have a deal for you but it's a package deal we owed you the European elites are fairly pathetic I'm sorry to say that I have seen a deterioration at Legacy I'm a French national and I have seen the deterioration of the governance of my country over the last few years would you say isn't that because politics is really technocratic now I mean there's you know there's one charismatic figure in the West right now and believe it or not it's Donald Trump I mean these other people don't inspire much well it's not just that I mean we don't understand how McComb came to power the election was feet longs to win previous tough you know of course it was the head of the IMF who got caught in a is in a set up in New York City and then mr. Phelan was removed by a sudden scandal with somebody pulled out of a hat and who is it who knows where all the skeletons are hidden in Europe who is spending tens of hundreds of billions of dollars but then that Eric than that that's presupposes that it doesn't doesn't matter who's president of France does it matter - mr. prime minister for the UK could somebody don't think so no anymore you know in my opinion the most important thing is some things you are used to forget it's ideology right there is a pro-western ideology team apart which isn't here today and so and Marco is just the product and a it's a product of this ideology is here to make the system go on and for me it's a French Gorbachev you know is it a chance for this elite who live well in France hi zip codes okay you never you never see the immigrants you never see through it drugs in the game speaking of the terrier Asian of European Union officials at this NATO summit in Brussels jean-claude van Juncker walking around my to the sin could have been go ahead ago he was he was toasted off his butt or if you believe the official version he has back problems alright I okay let's get anyone to watch repeated videos again and again of the demand junk I mean we had he's the President of the European Commission and I think he's a perfect metaphor for the European Union today back in the day they used to mock the geriatric leaders of the civil union Brezhnev and drop up for having to be propped up minutes left in this block and I want to ask you it's theme is the Western North Atlantic Alliance it's changing is it forever changed mark I mean there's no going back to the status quo absolutely there is there it's Europe just intends to wait Trump out whether it's two years or four years or they can just wait Trump out will be back I think it's changing is the best European treaty in this boner it's it's clear that it's a statement 43 that no independent policy of defense without NATO so he can do it term can say what he wants he will win on so he thinks he can pull us out of NATO all by himself I don't know maybe story here which is that we are living in a period of accelerated transition we had a single Empire which was highly successful which in 1945 controlled almost 50% of the GDP currently controls about eighteen percent is now the world's second largest economy let that sink in China by in PPP terms according to the World Bank is the world's largest there is a shift in the center of gravity and what we are seeing and what we're talking about her symptoms the the real driving force is the the the generator change and the change of the dominant Empire and from a Russian standpoint the ideal situation for Russia was to a balancing act between East and West West has rendered that impossible so Russia's orientation is now going to become much closer much more yes that's correct okay gentleman gonna jump in here this is a very nice segue to what I want to talk about in the second half of the program after a short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk we're all things to consider on Peter LaValle to remind you were discussing some real news okay Eric I want to go to you before we talk about the summit in Helsinki you wanted to make a point basically I was sort of looking at the American media coverage of this and I was seeing an article in the in The New Yorker which used to be a liberal relatively pacifist intelligent East Coast publication and it is now gone full-on propagandistic and if you look at the American media you now basically have as far as I can see three factions you have the DNC which the Democratic National still arguing with the referee 18 18 months after the final whistle was blown they're still arguing they lost the election you've got to get on and try to fight the next one you've got Fox News with all that represents and always has represented that hasn't changed very much the Koch brothers yep that's right and then you've got the military-industrial complex which is making a lot so that's CNN and MSNBC and there is no there is no independence of any of them and the problem is that they want to score points against Trump whatever it costs whatever I mean I'm really glad you brought this up this is my by a Susan B Glasser it's the the amateur boxer up against Muhammad Ali Washington fears Trump will be no match for Putin in Helsinki now this is a very interesting I'm glad you made it and you made me aware of it mark but this is a perfect example of a low octane intelligence getting no it's certainly I mean she's no sharp sharp knife in the drawer okay not by any standard but this is the the swamp this is a swamp article okay and and it really is in Eric's right it's against if it's against Donald Trump then it's it's perfectly fine but it has nothing to do with the geopolitical interest of the United States 18 years ago the the same media's explaining we are explaining that Putin is a stupider Cornelio of KGB yeah I know his mama daddy yeah now he's Muhammad Ali right exactly yeah it's interesting the title that she took of this you know that that Trump is an amateur boxer fighting Muhammad Ali is supposedly a quote from an anonymous former usual anonymous or treads from The Blob the deep state coming back right what this article shows us and it's a good one to read it's a good one if you if you flicked through the New Yorkers articles this week it is it is just one among many in a similar vein they're terrified of this summit because they and we it must be said do not know what Trump will do at this summit there is no agreed-upon reason for this summit other than to have a summit you know the idea of starting to talk but usually when there's a summit between the leaders of the US and Russia there are months of preparatory work low-level officials on various issues go back and forth they debate the issues that I think there's I think there's a method to this madness here I think no I think really what it is is that yeah Trump wants to make sure he's gonna have the summit he wants and not what jog both in water it's not what Pompeo wants not what always confuse nikki Haley once he's gonna have his own they're terrified that when he goes into that room with just interpreters and his deep state handlers not there you know to handle him what he can't do he what he might do we don't know what he might do but they're terrified of that possibility and him threatening at you know threatening that Germany that there are a captive of Russia right when it's great the opposite is actually far closer to truth or threatening to pull out of NATO right just in the last week they are in the United Kingdom where he's having a discussion with the Prime Minister and saying that Boris Johnson Bojo when he make a great point Minister - exactly but I don't see what what what either side can give to the other I I don't see anything okay because there's well maybe because there's no preparation for but I don't I don't see I know if there is prepare it's not in my opinion we will have good results but this wizard we will know after the midterm November election what need no Trump is having a triumph after this meeting with putting for a local election Americans care about foreign policy but they certain but we do know but mortgage would be careful we have indications that his base would like to see better relations with Russia that's why we go full circle here everything he says he says for his base it's not about security it's not about economics it's not about anything except for himself and his base Eric go American media at this point is that if mr. Trump tomorrow announced that he had a meeting lined up with the holy ghost within 24 hours the New York Times would be saying the Kremlin has suborn the the Holy Trinity and there they're working for Russia they don't care and this is a very decent God September around I guess it's a very dangerous situation for any country when the domestic political players are more interested in harming each other than in furthering the national interest this is when you get civil wars market it looks with that the indictment of a alleged 12 Russian intelligence officials here I mean I think all of us think that the timing of that is quite peculiar the same it's a political message right it comes right on the heels of the struck hearings it's obviously a political attempt to derail the summit right you know one of the things I think is really important I'm glad you brought that up because we can and I watch the Talking Heads dissect that testimony from Peter struck and one of the most amazing things I've ever seen in my life but beyond the optics too but what was interesting and I think this is we've talked about on this program many times the crisis of institutions this really what is it really at the the crux of all of this here is the separation of powers is that this the the FBI and the DOJ are defined Congress this is not trivial this is not trivial at all and I think this is where it's coming and struck still being an employee of the FBI gets the shield of the protection of the FBI once he's out we'll see what happens to him this girlfriend these at least a page looks like she's gonna be okay okay we'll see that next week here but there's an institutional crisis here actually it's the same in France you were talking about it in back from the election it is I mean Brasilia is the same in Spain that no the coup d'etat it's a permanent could coup d'etat and no let's see how the US will go through this crisis because it's of course they no matter what it's said during this summit Trump's not going to get any credit for I mean it doesn't matter the outcome even if there's no out well and you said it he's going to get credit with his base basically Trump is going to like with Kim he's going to come out it's going to announce a major victory a great step forward for American security they'll come up with some sort of deal my guess and it's only a guess and Mark will probably disagree is that Putin will give something about Iran on in in Syria we'll see I think you'll agree that why why what do you do that why would he do that and then number two Eric why should Vladimir Putin and the Russian politically trust Donald Trump he doesn't have to trust him all right he's not giving away the keys to the Kremlin I grew they're discussing that could be your fire target be on the table is a deal in Syria we know Trump wants to pull out a Syria his own military has been preventing him one of the areas in particular is this Altaf base in the south basically it's a desert area there's very few rebels left there most of them have been transferred trained and transferred to is only a token concession token but it's important it's a highway there so part of the idea what the Americans are so furious about now is is the president is meaning the Israelis and the Saudis are furious about now wagging the American dog is that the Iranian are in Syria well if they didn't want the Iranians in Syria then why did you try to overthrow 31 flavors 56 years right and that's exactly why they are rated sincere you know it's a lesson they already learned from Iraq who big is trying to preserve relationship with Israel to somebody and sorry but this is so the idea is that they might offer that Putin gets Iran to balk back down out of southern Syria and in return the u.s. gives up a military base that it has three minutes no news food stock let's not forget that there is a legitimate government in Syria they have to be on board - okay and Syria have to do is promise oh sure the Iranians will be gone the Americans give up the military base and then next week the Iranians can be wherever they were okay you're an expert on on Ukraine is Ukraine gonna play any role in this limit you think in my opinion first Trump as a bill against Ukraine is a Manafort affair and we know we saw what they did with back home trucks does not love the regime encase yes yeah very interesting declaration of food how much money but the Ukrainian oligarchs give to the Trump campaign I don't think any okay I think I did give an interview on a Polish newspaper and it told that tryi discussed with some discussions with drum and from very well understand the Kremlin position on Ukraine but it doesn't understand what keV really want as Polly predict politically speaking so first Trump has a bill against the Kiev government and secondly we don't have to forget that Russia is not a competitor for us Germany is of course and so actually the level the average level of trading between Russia and the GDP for both sides so it's almost its most nothing so actually if Trump is really this prismatic guy we want make America a great industrial country power again so it just only interests you it's might be just for him to make him great let's see after November we will know what the result because there is some actually very serious discussion between the US and the Russian part but again in my opinion we won't have any official result interesting language Trump says Russia is a competitor john mccain rises from his deathbed to say that know that russia is an enemy that engine and Putin spokesman says no I think quite trolling no Trump is our partner okay general that's all the time we have many thanks to my guests here in Moscow this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri all right who wants to go first mark yeah so back on the subject of the summit okay right I there could be a possible deal over Syria I think Trump's own administration will try to hamstring him on that and prevent him from signing anything with Putin out of this because of the bad optics going into it Democrats really tried to they called for this summit to be cancelled because of this interestingly time Mueller indignant against Russian military intelligence but there's an article this week in the American conservative and the American conservative I think any viewer of this show should probably watch the article is by george o'neal jr and the title is for peace with putin and america's pointless wars and that really comes down to the crux of it there could actually be peace right there might be economic competitors there could be placed between the US and Russia if the US wasn't pursuing hegemonic Wars meddling around there's one wrinkle I know everything you're saying and when it comes to Syria and this is what when I push back is that we see his administration and Trump himself having the the pathology called Iran in their head do you think the Trump is going to want to do any favors visa v Iran I mean basically Russia wanted to avoid having Assad overthrown by the Americans after their great success in Iraq in Libya in Yemen mister mr. Putin reasonably thought that all we don't need in the Middle East is another vacuum were sucking in the Islamic militants and refugee crisis has another refugee crisis he just said no Assad has his good points and his bad points but he is the legitimate leader of of Syria and there's no units the problem with this whole this whole thing and I've said this many times on this program here is that any kind of unfortunately in eighteen particularly with this president anything that is negotiated agreed to using diplomacy is considered a concession it's gay it's considered appeasement yes and this is where we are naming a deal they're not allowed to make a deal you're not allowed to give something but what's he giving I mean basically Putin has won in in in in Syria pretty much and if the Iranians pull back a hundred miles from the border what does this cost anybody okay first of all they're talking the Iranians what they're actually talking about is the popular mobilization units which consists mostly of Iraqis and some Afghani that were even the US admits they're true they're often trained by the Iranians were instrumental in defeating Isis in Iraq I mean this is when they speak of Iranians they want the popular mobilization because Israel is terrified that they're going to morph into a new Hezbollah in the southern border well Israel shouldn't have been supporting jihadis in the first so Russia doesn't really cost anything by making promises about the Iranians pulling back the Iranians may even agree to it but I agree with Peter I don't think that the US will draw back because they've lost the art of diplomacy they don't believe they have to compromise with anyone on anything they don't have any type of realist and they certainly don't want this president and to do that the problem is also Russia has retreated so far - it's red lines that there's very little that Russia from Russia it's that thanks to sanction there are stronger with Iran that they used to be right because no Iran it's very very strongly Russian support to continue to more or less expose movie but surely Russia's dumping it's it's t-bills Ukraine which which hasn't we haven't talked about there is an interesting fact actually an instant in deal which happen yesterday officially Ukraine will buy for more than 555 French le copters abuse helicopters and military not for counterterrorism operation so it means against its own population we know what it works and so the most interesting is at the same times they are begging for one billions credit from IMF another interesting thing that we perfectly know that so Ukraine taught that any money doesn't have any way to pay for this helicopters so the French taxpayers actually and the German ones will pay for this for this equipment and last but not least the first engines producer for mi-8 the older but still effective so yet le copters is in Ukraine is motorisation so so they are going to kill the right but you think but you know if they get this money from the IMF yeah for the purpose of buying these helicopters they'll never buy the helicopters the money will disappear okay actually they will get three for free and because it's 80% of the deal is a is a french incident financial institutions so at least it will be the French taxpayer we will pay for the Le copter with the killer yes for killing down on people and at the same time CF is destroying in one of the main high technological industry of motors each whoo-hoo steel which still producing Ashland said you know Ukraine should become an agricultural country the problem is that Europe does watery I already said that they ended the industry ization in Ukraine is diversification in my opinion they deliberately doing that because I know that as soon as you close former Soviet plant even it's a very profitable plant you will cut the relationship between Russia and Ukraine stay with a Russian theme here nobody talk what's going on here it's it's it's become political comedy from what I understand now the registered heroin addict who apparently poisoned himself and it killed his girlfriend accidentally had a bottle of the stuff in his closet a small boxes everyone I don't know where mine is but maybe he found I mean this is a dumpster dive put something in under the British government doesn't clean their dumpsters for four months an addict says hey I found a bottle of this let's shoot this up right I mean that makes perfect sense to me the whole story obviously there is something going on we don't know about it comes from the very very close to the vicinity of the largest chemical warfare well that's a coincidence there oh you're a conspiracy theorist anything I can dream up I don't have a clue where he got this stuff cause I don't think anybody else does either speaking of conspiracies let's let's jump to this Mueller in indignant right yes just like the previous in Dickman right he hasn't he it provides a lot of detail a lot of a lot of interesting detail evidently he knows everything that the Russian military intelligence allegedly does write everything down to that they're funding themselves by farming Bitcoin because you know that's the way the Russian government works they farming Bitcoin right the other he knows that that they are really good Schiffer because the the Russian military agents he knows they searched for the word Illuminati and Illuminati Gucci fur I mean do you see the connection there i I find this whole thing right it's enough to provide any evidence because he knows just like the Russians indicted 12 FBI agents you think mr. Trump would buy them one-way tickets from Moscow okay what period quartz there's a point there you're missing these highly trained very sophisticated Russian intelligence agents use the most modern technique of fishing the same letters that you get asking you to please sign in so you can get a billion dollars this indictment is it's no different than anxiety whatever can you guess what Podesta's email password was password password 10 year olds could act that if they try to know one thing I think is interesting is marking and and I haven't seen anyone clarify this did the FBI finally look at the DNC's Rancic evidence he's not been examined CrowdStrike made a copy and said this is what happens okay good enough for you no it's not good enough for me it's not good enough for me either but all right supposedly all of this detail right they've got they know everything that Russian military intelligence who for some reason Russian military intelligence is involved in this not the FSB or something like that they know every word they're searching for on the Internet but they didn't sound the alarm and stop any of this from happening now part of the suggestion that where because they provide no evidence for this very elaborate story they're providing is that it actually comes from Dutch intelligence there is a story a few months ago about how the Dutch were tapping into cameras and Russian military intelligence the only problem is that story has so many holes that it leaks like a sieve now I'm afraid that this entire Mueller indignant is based on another dodgy foreign dossier right that they're being led up by foreign intelligence they don't have too broad most out of time here to provide going back to the Peter struck testimony here considering all of his accusations and what not if he knew that all the Russians were doing this in the blow of the American electoral system he didn't do anything to stop it okay and neither did the Obama administration last word just a quote from Peter from Lisa page two how destroy how appropriate go ready he's completely unbiased so this is from his lover Lisa page to him texting so look you say we text on that phone the FBI phone when we talk about Hillary because it can't be traced number two guys that number two guy encountered terrorism okay he was being trained he was in his buy class now he was he was texting to Lisa that's all the time we have for the extended version of our program I hope you enjoyed it we hope you come back next week and remember crosstalk rules
