ARE MEASURES THE DEMOCRATS WILL POST. LOTS CHANGING EVEN AT THIS MOMENT. JOINING ME NOW, ONE OF THE POT DOWN LIKE A CONGRESSMAN WHO JUST MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE KNOW YOU JUST SPENT A FEW MOMENTS OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT WAS HE THINKING STAYING IN THAT MEETING? WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT? HE'S VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AND OPTIMISTIC. HE EXPRESSED IN HIS WORDS, I AM 1000% BEHIND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS IN THE HOUSE. THERE WILL BE TWO BILLS GOING TO THE FLOOR ON THURSDAY. THE McCALL GOODLATTE BILL, THE ORIGINAL VERSION AND THEN THE MODIFIED VERSION. BOTH ARE VERY SIMILAR IN TERMS OF THE FOUR PILLARS, BORDER SECURITY THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS AND BOTH PROVIDE FOR A DACA FIX. ON THIS ISSUE OF FAMILY SEPARATION, IT ALSO ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT WILL DETAIN THE FAMILY AS A UNIT RATHER THAN SEPARATE THEM OUT. Sandra: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FIND OUT IT ISN'T A FAMILY MEMBER OR A PARENT THAT'S TRAVELING OVER THE BORDER WITH THAT CHILD? THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM, WE'VE NEGLECTED THE BORDER IN THIS CRISIS. IN 2014 WE HAD 20 MILLION OF THESE CHILDREN CROSSING AND IT ENTICED THEM TO COME OVER. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FRAUDULENT PARENTS. PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN THEIR PARENTS SAYING THEY ARE THE PARENTS. UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY, THE PARENTS ARE NOW BEING PROSECUTED BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FAMILY STAY TOGETHER AND NOT SEPARATED. BUT I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY FROM MY POSITION AS THE CHAIRMAN OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS TO HAVE A BORDER SECURITY BILL PASSED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE WE PAST THE SECURE FENCE ACT IN 2006. THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. IT ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES IMMIGRATION TO A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM RATHER THAN A RANDOM LOTTERY SYSTEM OR CHAIN MIGRATION. Sandra: HOW WOULD SUCCESS BE MEASURED ULTIMATELY, IT BEING PASSED ON THE PRESIDENT SIGNS IT. AND I THINK METRICS ARE IMPORTANT IN OPERATION CONTROL OF THE BORDER. YOU CAN'T QUANTIFY THAT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE COUNTRY. THE FACT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE LEGAL LOOPHOLES, AND IN THE BEGINNING WHEN TRUMP THE RHETORIC ABOUT THE WALL AND SUCH, THE NUMBERS WENT WAY DOWN. THE PROBLEM IS WE KNOW THAT WAS RHETORIC AND CONGRESS HAS TO CHANGE THE LAWS IN THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES, OTHERWISE IF THEY COME, THEY CAN STAY. THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT THE SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS ARE SELLING TO THESE VICTIMS AT THE PRICE OF $6,000 PER PERSON BRINGING THEM INTO THE COUNTRY. WE WILL NEVER STOP THIS PROBLEM UNTIL WE DRY UP THE DETERRENT ISSUE AND THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT EXISTED. Sandra: MR. CHAIRMAN, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT EMOTIONS ARE HIGH THIS WEEK. AND, WHEN YOU LOOK ON AT THAT AND YOU SEE THE DISGUST FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND WHAT IS BEING LEFT OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE EVERY DAY? I'VE BEEN DOWN TO THE DETENTION CENTERS, AND IT IS ON A HUMAN LEVEL, IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT. BUT AGAIN, IT WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP GOING ON AND ON UNTIL WE FIX OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO ON THURSDAY, IN ADDITION TO FIXING DACA. I HOPE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO WORK WITH US TO FIX THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES ISSUE. DO YOU THINK THEY WOULD PREFER TO? I THINK SO. WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY THAT IS HISTORIC TO FIX BOTH THE SECURITY ISSUE AND OF THE DACA
