we begin with the story of a Texas waiter this Texas waiter decided that he was going to tell everyone that there is a racist message on a receipt hey this guy's name is Khalil Cavill a 20 year old server for salt grass steakhouse in Odessa and he claimed in a post on Facebook that a customer had left a racist note on a receipt the post along with a photo of the receipt quickly went viral it said we don't tip terrorists cavil claimed the message had left him sick to his stomach he said the experience tested his faith but then he added that he wanted to let it inspire him to change the world okay now I will give you three guesses as to whether this receipt was fake oh you got it on the first try okay here is a basic rule of thumb whenever anybody posts a receipt it's fake yeah unless it's somebody giving a giant tip okay if it's something bad that somebody wrote under-seat no one writes nasty things on receipts as a general rule do you know anyone who's ever done that I never have okay I like really the nastiest thing that I've ever done to any sort of waiter or waitress is under tip them if the service was really really poor this is my grandfather's thing also when he wasn't bringing corned beef sandwiches to to Ella Fitzgerald if so if the service is really poor and he thought the waitress jerk he'd leave them with a nickel tip just to just to show them up I don't actually do that I tend to over tip because these people are working really really hard but it's amazing how the entire media will fall for these stories time after time oh my gosh we don't know who did it but somebody wrote on the bottom of receipt we don't tip terrorists do we have any verification nodes we know who didn't know but we know that the receipt is real how do we know the receipt is real because right because America's racist that's the answer the answer is because they think America's racist and therefore the tip the the receipt has to be real once again this receipt was not in fact real it is just a bunch of stupid
