>>RECENTLY
IVANKA TRUMP SAT DOWN WITH PETER
ALEXANDER, A REPORTER FOR MSNBC.
ALEXANDER ASKED HER A QUESTION
SHE DIDN'T LIKE VERY MUCH.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR FATHER
AND HIS ACCUSERS.
>>I THINK IT IS A PRETTY
INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION TO
ASK A DAUGHTER IF SHE BELIEVES.
THE ACCUSERS OF HER FATHER WHEN
HE IS AFFIRMATIVELY STATED
THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH TO IT.
I DON'T THINK THAT IS A QUESTION
YOU WOULD ASK MANY OTHER
DAUGHTERS.
I BELIEVE MY FATHER, I KNOW MY
FATHER.
SO I THINK I HAVE THAT RIGHT AS
A DAUGHTER TO BELIEVE MY FATHER.
>> NO, YOU DON'T GET TO HIDE
BEHIND THE DAUGHTER THING
WHEN YOU ARE WORKING AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
AND ALSO WHEN YOUR DAD SAYS I
TOOK MY DAUGHTER WHO I THINK IS
REALLY SMART BECAUSE SHE IS THE
ONLY ONE IN THE FAMILY WHO IS
NOT ON THE SPECTRUM OR WHATEVER
ñ
SORRY FOR THE GREAT FOLKS THAT
ARE ON THE SPECTRUM.
THE REST OF THEM ARE COMPLETE
AND UTTER MORONS.
HE DIGS IVANKA TRUMP, PUTS HER
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, MAKE A GIANT
POLICY DECISION AND YOUR HUSBAND
IS IN CHARGED OF THE MIDDLE
EAST, MEXICO, CHINA.
AND THEN YOU HIDE AND SAY I AM
JUST A LITTLE OLD DAUGHTER.
YOU ARE NOT CHELSEA CLINTON AT
13.
IF YOU ASK CHELSEA CLINTON ñ IF
HILLARY CLINTON WOULD'VE WON THE
WHITE HOUSE AND SHE PUT CHELSEA
IN CHARGE OF MASSIVE POLICY
CONDITIONS YOU ARE RIGHT WE
SHOULD GET THE RIGHT TO ASK
HER ABOUT WHAT SHE IS DOING.
>> WHAT I AM SEEING FROM
CONSERVATIVES IS THAT VERY
ARGUMENT.
SHE SAID NO ONE ELSE WOULD GET
THAT QUESTION.
WHO ELSE WOULD?
BILL CLINTON IS
THE EXAMPLE.
CHELSEA CLINTON WAS A CHILD OF
THE TIME AND SHE WAS NOT
WORKING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
YOU ARE, SO YOU GET THAT
QUESTION.
SHE ENDED UP ANSWERING THE
QUESTION ANYWAY BUT BEFORE SHE
DID SHE SCHOOL TO THE REPORTER
THAT YOU DON'T GET THE PICK
AND CHOOSE WHAT YOUR INTERVIEW
QUESTIONS ARE.
YOU AGREE TO INTERVIEW, EVERY
QUESTION IS FAIR GAME.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T DO
INTERVIEWS.
>> I'M GOING TO DISSENT A
LITTLE.
>>NOT ALLOWED, CUT HIS MIC.
>>I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE BEING
HARD-HITTING OVER AN EASY ISSUE.
I WOULD LOVE IT IF THEY WERE
HARD-HITTING AND WHEN AFTER
IVANKA TRUMP FOR ñ THEY ARE
BRINGING UP THAT BECAUSE IT IS
AN EASY AND CHEAP THING TO GET
APPLAUSE FROM PARTISAN
DEMOCRATS.
REAL QUICK, I AGREE WITH YOU FOR
THE MOST PART BUT REMEMBER
THE POLICY POSITIONS THAT SHE
HAS IS ABOUT CHAMPIONING
WOMEN'S RIGHTS.
SO IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO
CHAMPION AS A MEMBER OF THE
WHITE HOUSE, THEN WE GET TO ASK
YOU ABOUT SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
THAT HAS BEEN ALLEGED AGAINST
YOUR FATHER.
