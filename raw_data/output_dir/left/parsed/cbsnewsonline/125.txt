>> LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN 
TO THE WORLD AND COUNTRY, WE 
STAND BY OUR NATO ALLIES AND 
ALL THOSE COUNTRIES WHO ARE 
FACING RUSSIA AGGRESSION. 
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I STOOD UP 
HERE AND TOLD YOU WHAT I THINK 
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN? 
HE DOES NOT SHARE OUR INTEREST, 
HE DOES NOT SHARE OUR VALUES. 
WE JUST CONDUCTED A YEAR-LONG 
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA'S 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
THEY DID INTERFERE IN THE 
ELECTIONS, IT IS CLEAR. 
THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT. 
IT IS ALSO CLEAR IT DID NOT 
HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE 
ELECTIONS. 
AS A RESULT WE PASSED TOUGH 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA SO WE CAN 
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. 
I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE AND THE 
NEED TO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS. 
THAT IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE. 
RUSSIA IS A MENACING GOVERNMENT 
WHO DOES NOT SHARE OUR INTEREST 
OR OUR VALUES AND THAT SHOULD 
BE MADE VERY CLEAR. 
>>WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU NOW 
TO CAPITOL HILL WERE DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERS ARE SPEAKING. 
THIS IS NANCY PELOSI. 
>> THE STRANGE AND DISTURBING 
AND HEARTBREAKING THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGHOUT THE 
VALUES THAT WERE THE BASIS OF 
THE HELSINKI COMMISSION WHEN HE 
WAS COWERING BEFORE PRESIDENT 
PUTIN YESTERDAY. 
INSTEAD OF STANDING UP FOR OUR 
DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRATIC 
PRINCIPLES, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
COWERED IN THE PRESENCE OF 
PUTIN AND THE ENTIRE WORLD 
WATCHED AND SAW THAT. 
TRUMPS EAGERNESS TO SELL OUT 
AMERICA PROVES THE RUSSIANS 
MUST HAVE SOMETHING PERSONALLY, 
POLITICALLY OR FINANCIALLY ON 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
AS DAN COATS HAS SAID THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS 
STATED THE RUSSIANS ARE ONCE 
AGAIN WAGING A CAMPAIGN TO 
INTERFERE IN OUR ELECTIONS. 
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP CONTINUES 
TO TAKE THE WORD OF RUSSIANS 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACING 
THEIR EXCUSES AND THE PRESIDENT 
GAVE A GREEN LIGHT TO CONTINUE 
TO ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY. 
YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT SIDED 
WITH THE ENEMY, THE ENEMY WHO 
WAGED AN ASSAULT ON OUR 
DEMOCRACY. 
DISTURBINGLY IT APPEARS THAT 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE CHOSEN 
TO SIDE WITH THE ENEMY. 
ALL YEAR THE REPUBLICANS IN 
CONGRESS HAVE WASTED OUR TIME 
WITH WEEK WORDS AND SHAM 
HEARINGS. 
TODAY THEY ARE PUSHING TO 
ELIMINATE FUNDING FOR STATES TO 
PROTECT THEIR ELECTORAL SYSTEM. 
WE WILL SPEAK TO THAT 
MOMENTARILY. 
DEMOCRATS ARE MOVING TO FORCE A 
VOTE TO RESTORE THE FUNDING TO 
HELPING STATES ENHANCE THEIR 
ELECTION EQUIPMENT TO COUNTER 
CYBER ATTACKS AND DEFEND AGAINST
FUTURE INTRUSIONS ON THE 
FINANCIAL SERVICES, THAT WILL 
HAPPEN WITH THE NATIONAL 
SERVICES BILL. 
WE ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE MUELLER 
INVESTIGATION. 
OUR COLLEAGUES WILL SPEAK TO 
THAT AS WELL. 
-- PROPOSED AN INDEPENDENT 
COMMISSION TO REVIEW WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE LAST ELECTION 
AND FINDING OUT TO ENSURE THAT 
IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 
REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS HAVE 
RESISTED THAT CALL AS WELL. 
PERHAPS WITH THE DAMAGING, 
DISGRACEFUL, SO SAD PERFORMANCE 
OF THE PRESIDENT YESTERDAY, THE 
REPUBLICANS WILL SEE THE LIGHT 
AND RESPOND TO SOME OF THE 
INITIATIVES THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE 
BEEN PUTTING FORTH FOR A WHILE 
NOW, WHILE HONORING AND 
RESPECTING THE CONFIDENCE OF 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND 
THEIR ASSESSMENT THAT THE 
RUSSIANS WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
DISRUPTION OF OUR ELECTION. 
WE WILL SEE. 
THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY 
IS AT STAKE. 
WE MUST PROTECT IT AND ASSAULT 
ON OUR DEMOCRACY IS AN ASSAULT 
ON OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE TO 
PROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 
WITH THAT I AM PLEASED TO YIELD 
TO RANKING MEMBER ON THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, A 
PERSON WHO HAS STOOD TALL AND 
STRONG AND SHOWED US A PATH ON 
HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER IN A 
BIPARTISAN WAY TO DO THAT, TO 
ROTECT OUR COUNTRY. 
>> I THINK YOU. 
AS YOU KNOW LEADER PELOSI 
SERVED ON THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE AND HAS A LONGER 
TENURE ON THIS COMMITTEE THAN 
ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE. 
WE HAVE GATHERED, THE CURRENT 
AND FORMER MEMBERS OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO 
EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR 
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WHO WERE 
DENIGRATED BY THE PRESIDENT'S 
PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY, WHOSE 
WORK, DIFFICULT WORK, OFTEN 
LIFE RISKING WORK WAS 
UNDERMINED BY THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OF THE COUNTRY WHO 
DISREGARDED THEIR CONCLUSIONS, 
WHO ESSENTIALLY SIDED WITH THE 
PERPETRATOR OF THE ELECTION 
INTERFERENCE RATHER THAN SIDE 
WITH HIS OWN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 
WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE IC FOR 
DECADES AND DECADES. 
WE HAVE GREATEST RESPECT FOR 
THE WORK THAT THEY DO. 
TO SEE THAT THEIR WORK PRODUCT 
WOULD BE DISCARDED WAS 
SOMETHING THAT SHOCKED US ALL. 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID 
YESTERDAY IN HELSINKI WENT 
BEYOND DISRESPECTING THE MEN 
AND WOMEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY. 
IT WAS A WHOLESALE BETRAYAL OF 
THE VALUES AND INTERESTS OF 
THIS COUNTRY. 
RONALD RAGAN SAID HE DID NOT 
LEAVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEFT HIM. 
HAD THERE BEEN ANY DEALT 
YESTERDAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
HAS LEFT RONALD REAGAN. 
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT OF HIS 
LEGACY IN THE GOP AS 
REPRESENTED BY THIS PRESIDENT. 
THIS PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY 
THAT AS BETWEEN THE WORD OF HIS 
OWN INTELLIGENCE DIRECT THEIR 
AND THE WORD OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, 
WHO STRONGLY ASSERTED THAT HE 
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
ELECTION HACKING, HE DID NOT 
KNOW WHO TO BELIEVE EXCEPT THAT 
HE CANNOT IMAGINE WHY THE 
RUSSIANS HAD DONE WHAT THEY 
DID. I 
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD BE SO NACVE AS 
TO TAKE THE WORD OF THIS FORMER 
KGB OPERATIVE. 
I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
THINKS THIS IS IN HIS PERSONAL 
SELF INTEREST. 
HIS ONLY IDEOLOGY IS SELF. 
WHATEVER THE MOTIVATION THE 
RESULT IS CLEAR AND UNEQUIVOCAL 
THAT WAS A DENIGRATION OF OUR 
COUNTRY, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, VALUES, 
VALUES, HE IS REALIGNING OUR 
COUNTRY NOT WITH FELLOW 
DEMOCRACIES BUT WITH FELLOW 
AUTOCRATS. 
AS MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE 
SERVED WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY TO HELP STRENGTHEN 
DEMOCRACY AND INSTITUTIONS 
AROUND THE WORLD AND TO FIGHT 
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES WHO WOULD 
UNDERMINE THE FREEDOM OF PEOPLE 
AROUND THE WORLD, THAT WAS AN 
UNPRECEDENTED BETRAYAL. 
I AM PROUD TO JOIN WITH MY 
COLLEAGUES IN CONDEMNING WHAT 
WE SAW AND VOICING OUR STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN 
OF THE IC AND THE UNPARALLELED 
WORK PRODUCT THAT THEY PRODUCE. 
THANK YOU. 
IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO 
INTRODUCE MY PREDECESSOR A 
WONDERFUL FORMER RANKING MEMBER 
AND SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS MORE 
OF THE IC THAN JUST ABOUT 
ANYONE ELSE. 
THANK YOU. 
>>THANK YOU LEADER PELOSI FOR 
BRINGING US TOGETHER. 
I WANT TO REITERATE TO ALL OF 
MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE STAND 
BEHIND THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY. 
INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN ONE OF 
THE BEST DEFENSES AGAINST 
TERRORISM, NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ALL 
OF THE ISSUES WE DEAL WITH. 
I REPRESENT AN ESSAY, IDEAL 
WITH CYBER SECURITY. 
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS FIRST 
ELECTED I SENT HIM A LETTER AND 
I SAID TO HIM AS PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES YOU NEED TO 
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE THREAT 
OF CYBER ATTACKS. 
ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS ATTACKS 
THAT WE HAVE OTHER THAN NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS. 
I NEVER GOT A CALL BACK, IT WAS 
AS IF HE DID NOT CARE. 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PUTIN 
SUGGESTION WITH OUR PRESIDENT 
ABOUT THE TASK FORCE. 
THIS TASK FORCE COMING TOGETHER 
WITH OUR COUNTRY IS AN ATTEMPT 
FOR RUSSIA TO BE RECOGNIZED AS 
AN EQUAL PEER IN CYBERSPACE, OF 
WHICH THEY ARE NOT. 
THE U. S. HAS NOTHING TO GAIN 
BY JOINTLY INVESTIGATING 
ANYTHING WITH RUSSIA OFFICIALS 
IN CYBERSPACE, UNLESS THE 
PRESIDENT BLUNTLY SHOWS THAT 
EVIDENCE THAT SPECIAL COUNSEL 
MUELLER PUT IN ENGLISH FOR HIM 
ON FRIDAY MUST BE ADDRESSED 
WITH PRUDENT. 
INDICTMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE CLEARS OUT RUSSIA 
EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
T IS CLEAR THAT OUR 
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE 
YESTERDAY WHEN HE WAS IN 
PUTIN'S PALM THAT HE WAS 
UNABLE, HE IS UNABLE TO 
CONFRONT RUSSIA ON ANYTHING. 
THE TASK FORCE IS NOT 
NECESSARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED IN 
2016. 
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 
A TASK FORCE WOULD ONLY BOLSTER 
THE GREEN LIGHT THAT OUR 
PRESIDENT HAS GIVEN PRUDENT BY 
GIVING THEM GREATER INSIGHT 
INTO INVESTIGATIONS MINDSET. IF 
THEY WANT TO COLLABORATE AND 
SHOW THAT THEY WILL PROPERLY 
ACT WITH US GOING FORWARD SO-
CALLED CYBER NORMS, IT IS A 
CONVERSATION THAT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT IS HAVING AND ONE 
STARTED IN PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS AND THAT TRUMP 
SHOULD SUPPORT IT INSTEAD OF 
DENOUNCING IT. 
THIS IS ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY AND 
THE RULE OF LAW IN THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. 
WHEN YOU ATTACK OUR DEMOCRACY 
WE MUST CALL YOU OUT ON A 
NATIONAL STAGE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TERRY 
SOUL -- TERRY SCHOLL. 
>> THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
I AM HONORED TO STAND THERE 
WITH CURRENT AND FORMER MEMBERS 
OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. 
AS A PROUD REPRESENTATIVE OF 
SELMA ALABAMA. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU THERE IS 
NOTHING MORE HEARTBREAKING TO ME
THAN A PRESIDENT WHO REFUSES TO 
STAND UP FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IN 
THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING 
EVIDENCE THAT OUR ELECTIONS 
WERE UNDER ATTACK. 
TWO YEARS AFTER WE FIRST 
LEARNED OF RUSSIA'S HACK ON THE 
DNC, WE NOW KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA TARGETED OUR
ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IT SELF 
AND HACKED COMPUTER NETWORKS 
CONTAINING VOTER INFORMATION. 
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA'S ACTORS 
POSTED MORE THAN 3000 
ADVERTISEMENTS ON FACEBOOK IN 
AN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE OUR 
ELECTIONS. 
THEY WERE SO BOLD AS TO SPONSOR 
PAGES THAT WERE NAMED BLACK 
ACTIVISTS AND PAID FOR IT IN NO 
LESS THAN RUBLES. 
THEIR SOLE PURPOSE WAS TO SO 
SORTS OF DISCORD. 
SORTS OF DISCORD THROUGHOUT THE 
NATION. 
WE HAVE TO GUESS THAT THEY DID 
SO THAT THEY KNEW HAVING A 
COVERT INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN WOULD 
HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ELECTION. 
WE KNOW THAT RUSSIA TARGETED 
MINORITY VOTERS IN AN ATTEMPT 
TO SOW DISCORD IN THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC AND TO ENCOURAGE 
MINORITY VOTERS TO STAY AT 
HOME. 
YES RUSSIA'S ATTACK WAS NO LESS 
THE VOTER SUPPRESSION. 
-- 
>> WE WANT TO TURN OUT TO 
SENATE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE 
SPEAKING TO REPORTERS. 
>>I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
EUROPEANS TO KNOW OF THE SENATE 
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY FEELS ABOUT 
THE STRUCTURES THAT WERE 
PAINSTAKINGLY SET UP OVER 
DECADES, THAT HAVE WORKED TO 
MAINTAIN WORLD PEACE AND TO 
HAVE SOME PROCESS BY WHICH WE 
CAN ENTER INTO TRADE AGREEMENTS 
AND OTHER THINGS. 
I JUST THINK THAT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT FOR OUR FRIENDS AND 
ALLIES TO HEAR FROM US. 
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT BACK?
IF THIS WERE TO FORGE AHEAD 
THERE WOULD BE A SENATE TRIAL. 
>>I AM NOT GOING TO ADDRESS A 
HYPOTHETICAL LIKE THAT. 
I THINK IT IS FAR-FETCHED AND 
NOT WORTHY OF COMMENT. 
>>DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE IS 
TRUST -- WITH HOW THE PRESIDENT 
HAS APPROACHED RUSSIA? 
>>I AM NOT HERE TO CRITIQUE 
ANYONE ELSE, I AM HERE TO SPEAK 
FOR MYSELF AND YOU HAVE HEARD 
FROM OTHERS AND YOU HAVE HEARD 
FROM OTHERS THIS MORNING 
STANDING BEHIND ME ABOUT OUR 
VIEWS ABOUT OUR FRIENDS AND 
ALLIES. I WANT THEM TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT IN THIS COUNTRY,
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
BOTH PARTIES WHO BELIEVE THAT 
THESE ALLIANCES PAINSTAKINGLY 
BUILT IN THE WAKE OF WORLD WAR 
II ARE IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO 
MAINTAIN THEM. 
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT 
CONGRESS CAN OR WILL DO TO 
SUPPORT THESE ALLIANCES OR TO 
PUSH BACK ON RUSSIA, THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON RUSSIA, 
OTHER THAN OFFERING WORDS OF 
SUPPORT X 
>> THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES. 
SENATOR RUBIO, FOR EXAMPLE, HE 
HAS A BILL THAT TARGETS THE 
2018 ELECTION, THE CYCLE THAT 
WE ARE IN NOW WITH AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT POTENTIAL 
PENALTIES IF THE RUSSIANS DO IT 
AGAIN. 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT WE 
MAY WELL TAKE UP LEGISLATION. 
IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THAT 
THE RUSSIANS NEED TO KNOW THAT 
THERE ARE A LOT OF US WHO FULLY 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN 
2016 AND IT BETTER NOT HAPPEN 
AGAIN IN 2018. 
>> WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO 
MR. McCONNELL ADDRESSING THE 
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE IN 
HELSINKI. 
WE ARE GOING BACK NOW TO THE 
SENATE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE ALSO 
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PERFORMANCE. 
>>-- IT IS BECAUSE OF THE MEN 
AND WOMEN IN THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE EVIDENCE,
NOT ONLY OF RUSSIA'S 
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION, 
BUT ALSO THE ILLEGAL ANNEXATION 
OF CRIMEA AND THE INVASION OF 
THE UKRAINE. 
RUSSIAN ARMS TRANSFERS TO SYRIA 
AND RUSSIA'S ILLEGAL TRADE WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
PUTIN IS NOT OUR FRIEND. 
WE CAN'T TRUST HIM AND WE MUST 
NOT ALLOW THE SANCTIONS AGAINST 
PUTIN TO SLIP IN ANY WAY, SHAPE
, OR FORM. 
THE PRESIDENT MISSED THE 
OPPORTUNITY YESTERDAY TO STAND 
UP TO PUTIN AND TO STAND UP FOR 
AMERICA AND FOR OUR VALUES. 
HIS BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY WAS 
REPREHENSIBLE. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
STAND UP STRONG AGAINST PUTIN. 
KEEP THE SANCTIONS IN PLACE AND 
KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON OUR 
AMERICAN VALUES AND OUR 
AMERICAN FUTURE. 
NOW I AM PROUD TO INTRODUCE AND 
ASKED TO COME TO THE PODIUM 
REPRESENTATIVE MIKE QUIGLEY 
FROM THE GREAT STATE OF 
ILLINOIS. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
THE RUSSIANS ATTACK ON OUR 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND THEY 
WILL BE BACK. 
THE TRUTH IS THEY NEVER LEFT. 
WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IF WE 
ARE PREPARED, THE SHORT ANSWER 
IS WE ARE NOT. 
40 STATES HAVE ELECTION 
EQUIPMENT THAT IS OVER A DECADE 
OLD. 
ILL FIT TO HANDLE MODERN ANTI-
HACKING SOFTWARE. 
13 STATES USE EQUIPMENT THAT 
DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A PAPER TRAIL
. WHEN YOU ELECTRICALLY SCAN 
YOUR VOTE, THERE IS NO WAY TO 
AUDIT AFTER THE FACT WHAT IF 
ANYTHING WAS DONE TO THAT 
EQUIPMENT. 
WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY 
VULNERABLE. 
SECRETARY JOHNSON IN TESTIFYING 
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE MENTIONED 
THE FACT THAT MOST DO NOT KNOW 
HEY WERE HACKED, MOST E 
HAD TO BE TOLD BY SOMEONE ELSE 
THAT THEY WERE HACKED. 
USUALLY IT IS A YEAR AND A HALF 
AND TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY KNOW 
IT HAS TAKEN PLACE. 
WE ARE THAT VULNERABLE. 
9000 ENTITIES OPERATE FEDERAL 
ELECTIONS AND THEY RANGE FROM 
THE POLITIES THE SIZE OF 
MAYBERRY ALL THE WAY TO LARGE 
COUNTIES AND STATE BOARD OF 
ELECTIONS. 
DOZENS OF THEM WERE HACKED 
PRIOR TO THE LAST ELECTION 
INCLUDING MY OWN STATE OF 
ILLINOIS IN AUGUST 2016. 
IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THIS 
THE LAST TIME WE HAD AN 
ELECTION CATASTROPHE, THIS 
GOVERNMENT SPENT $3.5 BILLION 
AFTER BUSH. WHY? 
BECAUSE WE TREASURE THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. 
NO MATTER WHO WINS WE WANT TO 
KNOW IT IS A FAIR GAME. 
WE ARE NOT IN THAT POSITION 
ANYMORE. 
IN 2018 WE SPENT $380 MILLION 
-- 
>>CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE IS IN 
WASHINGTON AND HE JOINS US NOW. 
I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING 
IN, I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME 
OF THE THINGS THAT WE ADDRESS. 
NANCY PELOSI CALLED THE 
PERFORMANCE DISGRACEFUL, 
DAMAGING AND SO SAD. 
SHE ALSO SAID THIS IS PROOF 
THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
MUST HAVE SOMETHING OVER THE 
PRESIDENT SHE IS NOT THE FIRST 
PERSON TO BRING THIS UP BUT IT 
IS A BIG ACCUSATION IS THERE 
ANYTHING TO BACK THIS UP? 
>>NO THERE ISN'T. 
SHE HAS SAID THIS QUITE OFTEN 
IN RECENT MONTHS SHE SAID THIS 
IN HER -- THIS SAME EXACT ROOM 
DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, SHE 
SAID IT IN A STATEMENT AND IN 
INTERVIEWS FROM THE PAST. 
WHEN YOU ASK HER OR HER PEOPLE 
THAT SHE HAVE PROOF OF THIS 
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT SHE IS 
THE LONGEST-SERVING MEMBER OF 
THE HOUSE OR SENATE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE RIGHT 
NOW AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE 
THE MEANS TO FIND OUT OR AT 
LEAST ASK THEY ARE DEMURE AND 
THEY DO NOT GIVE SPECIFICS. 
RIGHT NOW IT IS AN ACCUSATION 
WITHOUT PROOF AND PROBABLY 
SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH 
UNLESS SHE WOULD LIKE TO 
PROVIDE US WITH SPECIFICS. 
>> REPRESENTATIVE SCHIFF WENT 
ON TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
REALIGNING OURSELVES WITH NOT 
DEMOCRACIES BUT AUTOCRATS. 
THAT IS A STRONG STATEMENT AND 
ONE WHICH PERHAPS THERE IS A 
BIT OF EVIDENCE FOR ESPECIALLY 
AFTER THE HELSINKI SUMMIT. 
>>I GUEST -- GUESS SOME COULD 
SAY THAT AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
INTERACTIONS WITH THE TURKISH 
PRIME MINISTER WHILE THEY WERE 
TOGETHER AT THE NATO SUMMIT AND 
HE WAS BEING COMPLEMENTARY 
ABOUT HOW HE RUNS THINGS IN 
TURKEY. A LOT OF THAT REMAINS 
IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER. 
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HE 
DID THERE WAS MAKE THE POINT 
THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS 
MOVED ON FROM THE ERA OF RONALD 
REAGAN WHO WAS KNOWN FOR 
TALKING TOUGH AND TAKING ON THE 
SOVIET UNION. 
WE HAVE HEARD AND SEEN NOT FROM 
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THESE LAST 
FEW DAYS WITH REGARDS TO RUSSIA.
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE FROM 
NOW AND NOVEMBER IS A DIS-
APPEAL OF REPUBLICANS WHO MAY 
BE DRIFTING UNCLEAR ON WHO THEY 
SHOULD BE SUPPORTING GIVEN WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE AND THEY 
ARE TRYING TO CAPTURE WHAT THEY 
BELIEVE COULD BE A SEGMENT OF 
THE VOTING POPULATION, FRANKLY 
THEY MAY BE TRYING TO DRAW BACK 
DEMOCRATS WHO VOTED REPUBLICAN, 
ALLOTTED THAT IN 2016. 
REAGAN DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN A 
THING SINCE THE 80s AND I THINK 
THEY UNDERSTAND THERE MAY NOT 
BE A BIG OPENING GIVEN WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID YESTERDAY AND 
GIVEN THAT THE COUNTRY AS 
PROCESSING WHAT EXACTLY WAS 
DONE IN FINLAND WHICH COULD 
CHANGE ON A DIME IN A SECOND 
WHENEVER WE SEE WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TO SAY FOR 
HIMSELF AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
THE MEETING THAT HE IS HAVING 
WITH REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS. 
>> LOOKING AT THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY BEING HARD ON RUSSIA 
PREDATES RONALD REAGAN. 
THIS HAS BEEN A REPUBLICAN 
POLICY SINCE THE COLD WAR. 
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MANY 
REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING AN 
IDENTITY CRISIS. 
>> CERTAINLY YOU LISTEN TO 
REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL AND YOU 
HAVE SOME WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY 
QUITE CONFLICTED BY WHAT HAS 
GONE ON. 
I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE A 
GOOD MEASURE OF IT. 
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE POLLING AND 
CONTINUE TO REPORT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY AND GET A SENSE ON 
WHETHER OR NOT THIS RESONATED, 
WHETHER THIS WAS A BIG DEAL OR 
IF IT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS. 
WHILE HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE 
SPEAKING, WE SAW A LITTLE BIT 
OF MITCH McCONNELL, HE STARTED 
HIS REMARKS BY REASSURING THE 
EUROPEAN ALLIES THAT THE UNITED 
STATES REMAINS AN ALLY OF 
THEIRS AND THAT RUSSIA IS NOT. 
JUST TELLING THAT WE CONTINUE 
TO HAVE TO SEE SENIOR 
CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS GO OUT OF 
THEIR WAY PUBLICLY TO REITERATE 
WHAT HAS BEEN LONG-STANDING U. 
S. POLICY AND THAT IS TO ALIGN 
OURSELVES MORE WITH EUROPEAN 
AND WESTERN POWERS. 
>>IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE 
MITCH McCONNELL ADDRESSING THAT 
BECAUSE EACH CONGRESSIONAL 
REPUBLICANS THERE HAS TO BE 
SOME RESPONSE WHICH THEY HAVE 
TO CRAFT CAREFULLY. 
>>WHAT, THEY DON'T WANT TO GO 
AS FAR AS JOHN McCAIN DID OR 
JEFF FLAKE, OR EVEN TO SOME 
EXTENT MITT ROMNEY IN THEIR 
COMMENTS. 
BUT THEY DO NEED TO REITERATE 
TO THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS, TO 
SKEPTICS AROUND THE WORLD THAT 
IN THEIR VIEW U. S. POLICY HAS 
NOT CHANGED AND THEY ARE NOT IN 
AGREEMENT WITH THE PRESIDENT 
WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING AND 
SAYING. 
>> DO YOU THINK THE SENATE HAS 
AN APPETITE TO INCREASE 
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA? 
>>IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 
McCONNELL WAS ASKED THAT. 
HE SAID WHEN IT COMES TO 
LEGISLATION PERHAPS THERE IS A 
WAY TO WARN RUSSIA THAT THEY 
WILL BE PUNISHED YET AGAIN OR 
THERE WOULD BE NEW SANCTIONS. 
SHOULD THERE BE EVIDENCE THAT 
THEY MINGLED OR MEDDLED, 
COLLUDED, TRY TO DISRUPT THE 
2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 
THAT POTENTIAL LEGISLATION 
WOULD COME AS BOTH LAWMAKERS 
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS HAVE 
SAID THAT RUSSIA IS INDEED 
DOING THINGS SIMILAR THAN THEY 
DID IN 2016. 
IF ANYTHING IT MIGHT STAVE OFF 
FURTHER REACTION BY RUSSIA BUT 
IT WOULD BRING A STRONG RESPONSE
FROM CONGRESS. 
THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE CONCRETE 
PLAN TO DO ANYTHING YET, 
NOTHING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED, AND 
YET TELLING THAT REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS IN BOTH CHAMBERS HAVE 
NOT RULED IT OUT. 
>> IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE AT THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE 
IS TO THIS CRITICISM WHEN HE 
HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BEFORE FOR 
BEING WEAK ON RUSSIA, HE CAME 
OUT WITH SANCTIONS AGAINST 
RUSSIA. 
SOMETIMES HE RESPONSE TO 
CRITICISM BY ACTUALLY DOING 
SOMETHING. 
>>RIGHT. 
OR SOMETIMES BY DOUBLING DOWN. 
WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. 
WE ARE HEARING GUIDANCE THAT HE 
HAS BEGUN SPEAKING TO REPORTERS 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THE WAY THIS WORKS IS WE WILL 
NOT SEE IT UNTIL THE TAPE IS úA 
OF US. HE IS IN A PREVIOUSLY 
SCHEDULED MEETING WITH A 
HANDFUL OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO 
DISCUSS WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
CALLS TAX REFORM 2.0 AND 
GUIDANCE CAME FROM THE WHITE 
HOUSE PRESS OFFERINGS -- PRESS 
OFFICE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT 
HE WAS GOING TO ADDRESS THE 
PRESS FOR WHAT HE SAID ENDED 
YESTERDAY IN FINLAND. 
THAT SEEMS TO BE A SWIFT 
RESPONSE FROM HIM AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE FOR WHAT HAS BEEN 
CRITICAL REACTION TO WHAT HE 
SAID IN FINLAND. 
WHAT HE IS SAYING WE DO NOT 
KNOW BUT WE DO HAVE GUIDANCE 
FROM REPORTERS IN THE ROOM THAT 
HE IS SPEAKING. 
WHY CAN'T WE SEE IT LIVE? THAT 
IS A MATTER OF LOGISTICS, THEY 
CAN'T NECESSARILY RUN A POWER 
CORD ALL THE WAY INTO THE ROOM 
WHEREVER HE IS AND OUT TO THE 
SATELLITE DISHES. 
THEY WILL RUN BACK AS QUICKLY 
AS THEY CAN WITH THE TAPE. 
>>WE WILL PLAY IT HERE AS SOON 
AS WE GET IT. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT 
INSIGHT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK AS WE AWAIT REMARKS FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE REGARDING THE FALLOUT 
FROM THE SUMMIT WITH RUSSIA 
PRESIDENT PUTIN.
>>> WE ARE TAKING YOU TO 
CAPITOL HILL WHERE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER IS 
SPEAKING. 
>> -- ANY OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE 
PRIVY TO WHAT HAPPENED. 
WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID PUBLICLY. 
WE ARE MORE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THOSE TWO HOURS 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ALONE 
WITH MR. PUTIN. 
DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THAT HE WAS 
TOUGHER ON PUTIN IN SECRET THEN 
HE WAS PUBLICLY? 
WHY DID HE NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE 
IN THE ROOM IF HE WAS SO SURE 
AND CONFIDENT THAT WHAT HE DID 
WOULD STAND THE LIGHT OF PUBLIC 
SCRUTINY? 
WE NEED THESE PEOPLE TO COME. 
WE NEED SECRETARY POMPEO, THERE 
IS SOME TALK THAT HE MAY BUT 
THERE HAS BEEN NO COMMITMENT 
THAT WE HAVE SEEN AND WE WANT 
DNI COATS, AMBASSADOR HUNTSMAN 
AND MANY OTHERS. 
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT  NOT 
GET THE FULL STORY OUT BEFORE 
THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
NEXT, WHERE ARE THE NOTES FROM 
THE MEETING? 
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT AGREE TO
? WAS SECRETARY POMPEO BRIEFED 
AFTERWARDS? DID HE WRITE 
ANYTHING DOWN? 
WERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S TEAM? THE 
CONTEMPORARY NOTES THAT WERE 
TAKEN PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO 
THE TO OUR CLOSED MEETING WILL 
BE TURNED OVER TO CONGRESS 
IMMEDIATELY. 
I AM CALLING ON LEADER 
McCONNELL AND HIS LEADERSHIP 
TEAM TO IMMEDIATELY REQUEST A 
HEARING WITH THE PEOPLE THAT I 
MENTIONED POMPEO, COATES, 
HUNTSMAN AND THE REST OF THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND I AM 
CALLING ON LEADER McCONNELL TO 
JOIN US IN DEMANDING THE 
CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES THAT WERE 
TAKEN. 
>>NEXT, OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS 
MUST IN THE ATTACKS ON THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
YOU WANT TO PASS LEGISLATION? 
YES, THE MOST IMPORTANT 
LEGISLATION YOU CAN PASS GIVEN 
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTITUDE IS THE 
BIPARTISAN BILL TO PROTECT THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL THAT SENATORS 
COOMBS, BOOKER, TILLIS AND 
GRAHAM AUTHORED ALONG WITH 
SENATORS WHITE HOUSE AND 
BLUMENTHAL AND PASS THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
PUT IT ON THE FLOOR 
IMMEDIATELY. 
IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU MEAN WHAT 
YOU SAY LEADER McCONNELL. 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WALK THE 
WALK AND NOT JUST TALK THE TALK.
FOURTH, THE PRESIDENT MUST 
RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS AND 
INSIST ON THE EXTRADITION OF 
THE 12 RUSSIANS INDICTED FOR 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE. GIVEN 
ALL OF THE INNUENDO, THIS 
PRESIDENT SHOULD RELEASE THE 
TAX RETURNS WHEN HE WAS ELECTED.
HE SHOULD DO IT AND OUR 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO JOIN 
US IN ASKING TO DO IT. 
FINALLY, WE MUST MOVE TO 
PROTECT THE ELECTION SECURITY 
TO ITS CREDIT THE SENATE IN 
BIPARTISAN FASHION LED BY SOME 
OF THE PEOPLE AROUND ME AND 
MANY OTHERS -- 
>> WE ARE STARTING TO GET A 
SENSE OF WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IS SAYING AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
REGARDING HIS SUMMIT WITH 
PRESIDENT PUTIN. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CURRENTLY 
MEETING WITH REPUBLICAN MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS TO TALK ABOUT TAX 
REFORM BUT THE FALLOUT FROM 
HELSINKI CAME OUT. 
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE HAS FULL 
FAITH AND SUPPORT FOR AMERICA'S 
INTELLIGENT AGENCIES. 
WE ARE AWAITING HIS FULL 
REMARKS THAT WE ARE GETTING 
BITS AND PIECES OF WHAT HE 
SAID. 
ED O'KEEFE IS IN WASHINGTON AND 
HE JOINS US NOW. 
YOU ARE READING THE SAME NOTE 
AS I AM AND TRYING TO GLEAN 
SOME SENSE. 
IT LOOKS AS IF HE IS SHOWING 
FAITH IN AMERICA'S INTELLIGENCE 
AGENCIES WHICH IS A GOOD THING. 
>> HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING ON 
CAMERA WHAT HE HAS BEEN 
TWEETING ABOUT SINCE HE BOARDED 
HIS FLIGHT HOME YESTERDAY, 
REITERATING THAT HE HAS FULL 
FACE THAT'S LIKE FAITH AND 
SUPPORT IN THE U. S. 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY SAYING 
THIS WAS A SUCCESSFUL MEETING 
WITH NATO IN PART BECAUSE HE 
HAS GOTTEN MEMBER NATIONS TO 
PAY $44 BILLION MORE ON TOP OF 
WHAT THEY USED TO DO. 
HE HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH THE 
QUEEN WHO HE CALLED A TERRIFIC 
PERSON, APPARENTLY HE ALSO SAYS 
THAT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL VISIT 
HAD TO DO WITH RUSSIA. 
THEY WERE TEMPTED TO TACKLE 
SOME OF THE MOST OPPRESSING 
ISSUES TACKLING HUMANITY. 
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA WOULD 
BE A GOOD THING. 
WE ARE READING ROUGH NOTES SENT 
BY THE REPORTERS WHO ARE WHERE 
HE IS AND THE TAPE COMES BACK 
OUT TO THE --. 
HE SEEMS TO BE DOUBLING DOWN 
AND REITERATING MORE CLEARLY, 
CERTAINLY DIFFERENTLY THAN HE 
DID DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
YESTERDAY THAT HE HAS FULL 
FAITH IN THE U. S. INTELLIGENCE 
COMMUNITY WHICH IT SEEMS AT 
LEAST AT FIRST BLUSH WAS ONE OF 
THE BIGGEST KNOX HE GOT FROM 
CRITICS. 
>>I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- 
CAME OUT SAYING THAT TRUMP SAYS 
HE MADE PROGRESS ON CONFLICTS 
WITH PUTIN DURING THE PRIVATE 
MEETING. 
PROGRESS ON CONFLICTS, 
DISCUSSED THE MIDDLE EAST, 
AGAIN, WE ARE LOOKING FOR 
INSIGHT INTO THAT PRIVATE TO 
OUR CONVERSATION. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY 
DISCUSSED. 
ACCORDING TO REUTERS THEY 
DISCUSSED SYRIA, THE IRAN 
NUCLEAR AMBITIONS, DURING THE 
MEETING. 
WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF 
INSIGHT. 
>> I THINK THE HEADLINE COMING 
OUT OF THIS THAT HE ACCEPTS THE 
FINDINGS OF THE U. S. 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH HE 
FAILED TO DO YESTERDAY WHEN THE 
WORLD WAS WATCHING. 
WHETHER THIS WILL RESONATE 
WIDELY REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
CLEARLY HE UNDERSTANDS NOW IF 
YOU DID NOT ALREADY THAT IT WAS 
IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO SAY. 
HE IS MEETING WITH A COLLECTION 
OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS. 
THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO TALK 
ABOUT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
BILLED AS CATCH REFORM 244. 
KEVIN BRADY WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS 
COMMITTEE, OBVIOUSLY THE 
PRESIDENT WAS EAGER TO FIGHT IN 
REPORTERS TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE 
THAT HAS DOMINATED CONVERSATION 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SINCE HE 
RETURNED AND THAT IS WHAT HE 
DID AND SAID IN HELSINKI 
YESTERDAY. 
HE IS REITERATING NOW ON CAMERA 
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS 
TWEETING ABOUT YESTERDAY AND 
LAST EVENING DON'T FORGET WHAT 
WE DID AT NATO, DON'T FORGET I 
MET WITH THE QUEEN, IN MY VIEW 
HE SAYS RUSSIA, THE MEETING 
WITH RUSSIA WAS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT PART AND HE THINKS IT 
WENT WELL AND BY THE WAY I 
ACCEPT THE FINDINGS OF THE U. 
S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 
WHETHER HE WILL DO MORE ABOUT 
IT BECAUSE HE ACCEPTS IT 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
THAT IS WHY YOU SAW THERE 
EARLIER CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS 
ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS 
THEORY, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 
TO BE FORTHCOMING ON WHAT WAS 
SAID AND WHAT MORE IS THERE TO 
KNOW ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND 
HIS POTENTIAL AS THEY CONTINUE 
TO ALLEGE, RELATIONSHIP WITH 
EITHER PRESIDENT PUTIN OR 
RUSSIA GENERALLY. 
CALLS TO RELEASE HIS TAX 
RETURNS, THAT IS HARKENING BACK 
TO TWO SUMMERS AGO WHEN 
DEMOCRATS INSISTED AND HE 
REFUSED TO GO I EXPECT MOST OF 
THOSE DEMANDS WILL FALL ON DEAF 
EARS AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>>CALLS FOR HIS TAX RETURNS AND 
CALLS TO DEMAND THE EXTRADITION 
OF THE 12 RUSSIANS INDICTED. 
>> IT IS NOT CLEAR IF HE DID 
THAT YESTERDAY. 
HE STOPPED AT THE POINT THAT HE 
SAID I BROUGHT IT UP, PUTIN 
DENIED IT. 
IT WASN'T CLEAR IF HE OR 
SECRETARY POMPEO OR ANYBODY 
ELSE RAISE THAT ISSUE. 
IT CAME UP IN THE INTERVIEW 
WITH CHRIS WALLACE ON FOX NEWS 
AND PUTIN SAID I DON'T SEE A 
NEED TO DO IT I WOULD RATHER 
SEE U. S. AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS 
WORKING TOGETHER ON JOINT 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
THE IDEA OF -- DOES NOT APPEAR 
TO BE BREACHED QUITE SERIOUSLY. 
>> I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT, 
ACCORDING TO REUTERS, TRUMP 
MEANT TO SAY IN HELSINKI THAT 
HE SAW NO REASON WHY IT WOULD 
NOT BE RUSSIA THAT INTERFERED 
IN ELECTIONS. 
>> YES. HE SAYS HERE ALSO, MY 
ADMINISTRATION WILL STOP AND 
REPEL ANY EFFORTS TO INTERFERE 
IN ELECTIONS. 
HE IS SUGGESTING THAT THEY WILL 
TRY TO DO MORE. 
WHAT CAN BE DONE AND HOW QUICKLY
WITH THE ELECTIONS FAST 
APPROACHING IS UNCLEAR. 
>> AS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE 
POINTED OUT THERE ARE SO MANY 
STATE ELECTION SYSTEMS THAT ARE 
SO VULNERABLE, SO ANTIQUATED, 
ARE THERE EFFORTS BEING MADE TO 
UPDATE THESE? 
WHAT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
DOING AT THIS POINT? 
>> GIVEN THAT THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE KNOWS OR SAYS THERE 
ARE ATTEMPTS UNDERWAY WE CAN 
SURMISE THEY ARE DOING 
SOMETHING BUT WE DO NOT KNOW 
WHAT THAT IS. 
IT IS BECAUSE THE U. S. 
ELECTION SYSTEMS ARE SO 
DECENTRALIZED. 
DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS, 
COUNTIES, STATES THEY ALL VOTE 
DIFFERENTLY. 
IT IS HARD TO POLICE A MONITOR 
THAT. 
IT MAY NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL AFTER 
THE FACT. 
IF THE WARNINGS FROM 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS ARE TO 
BE BELIEVED IT IS HAPPENING 
AGAIN. 
IT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER 
STATE OFFICIALS ARE CATCHING IT 
AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO STOP 
IT. 
THERE HAVE BEEN BIPARTISAN 
PROPOSALS TO SPEND A LOT OF 
MONEY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO 
HELP THE STATES KEEP AN EYE ON 
THIS AND DO SOMETHING TO STOP 
IT. 
THAT MONEY HAS NOT STARTED 
TRICKLING DOWN. 
HOMELAND SECURITY HAS BEEN 
HOLDING MEETINGS WITH 
SECRETARIES OF STATE AND OTHER 
OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 
I RECALL HEARING FROM SOME 
STATE OFFICIALS SAYING THAT 
THEY HAVE NOT GONE CLEAR 
GUIDANCE ON WHAT THEY SHOULD BE 
LOOKING FOR OR WHAT THEY SHOULD 
BE DOING IN ORDER TO 
POTENTIALLY STOP NEW THREATS. 
>>IT ALL SEEMS TO BE COMING OUT 
OF THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS 
SEEMS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO WALK 
BACK THE OPTICS. 
WILL DEMOCRATS BY THAT? 
>> NO. I DON'T THINK THEY WELL. 
NOTHING SHORT OF DOING THE FOUR 
THINGS THAT THEY ARE CALLING 
FOR WHICH ARE UNLIKELY TO 
HAPPEN WILL PLEASE THEM. 
IF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 
COME TO THE CAPITAL EARLY NEXT 
WEEK TO EXPLAIN WHAT WENT ON 
AND SHARE MORE LIGHT ON WHAT 
HAPPENED AT LEAST THEY WILL 
HAVE THAT, AT LEAST A CHANCE TO 
PUBLICLY SCOLD THE OFFICIALS 
FOR LETTING THE PRESIDENT HAVE 
 PRIVATE MEETING WITH THE 
RUSSIA LEADER. 
>>WHAT ABOUT REPUBLICANS? 
THE ONES WHO WERE CRITICAL OF 
THE PRESIDENT? 
>> I AM SURE SOME WELL. 
THE FACT THAT YOU GOT TO SEE 
THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND THE 
SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER GO OUT 
AND REITERATE THAT THEY BELIEVE 
WESTERN POWERS WESTERN 
COUNTRIES, EUROPE IS MORE OF AN 
ALLY THAN RUSSIA THAT SHOULD 
TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO 
KNOW. 
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT 
BUT THEY FELT THE NEED TODAY. 
>>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
INSIGHT. 
>> WE HAVE ZEKE MILLER ON THE 
PHONE NOW HE IS A CORRESPONDENT 
FOR --. 
IT SEEMS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
SAYING YOU HEARD ME WRONG, I 
MEANT TO SAY THAT I SAW NO 
REASON WHY IT WOULD NOT BE 
RUSSIA THAT INTERFERED IN THE 
ELECTIONS. 
NO ONE HEARD ME CORRECTLY, THE 
MEDIA MISREPORTED. 
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE 
UNDERSTANDING? 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTED 
TO CLARIFY THAT HE MEANT TO SAY 
THAT I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY 
IT WOULDN'T BE RUSSIA --, THAT 
BEING THE PRESIDENT BOWING TO 
THIS MASSIVE OUTCRY FROM 
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND 
ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT DOUBTING THE U. S. 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES -- AND 
MISSPOKE WHEN HE WAS WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN YESTERDAY. 
THAT IS A STRIKING STEP DOWN 
WHERE HE IS SO UNWILLING AND 
PUBLIC TO ADMIT THAT ERROR AND 
HERE HE IS ADMITTING ERROR. 
>>HE IS ALSO PUTTING HIS 
SUPPORT BEHIND THE INTELLIGENCE 
COMMITTEE OR AT LEAST 
EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR THE 
U. S. INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. 
>> THAT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AS 
WELL AND WE SHOULD GET THE 
AUDIO AND VIDEO HERE IN A FEW 
SECONDS. 
THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THAT HE 
HAS CONFIDENCE IN THE LEADERS 
OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
THAT HE PUT IN PLACE -- STILL 
THAT -- ALSO BY THE PRESIDENT 
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS FOR 
HIM TO MAKE THAT CLAIM NOW -- 
IT IS ALSO FRUSTRATION 
INTERNALLY THAT HE IS 
UNDERCUTTING MORALE OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM. 
>>HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING A 
LITTLE BIT INTERESTING. 
HE SAID THAT U. S., RUSSIA 
RELATIONSHIP HAS GOTTEN 
SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER. THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH. 
>> THERE IS REALLY NOT A LOT OF 
EVIDENCE, THE PRESIDENT IS 
EXPLAINING THAT ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING THEY DISCUSSED IRAN AND 
KOREA -- WE HAVE NOT NOTICED 
EVIDENCE OF WARMING OF TIES. AT 
THE SAME TIME -- NO LIFTING OF 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA THAT IS AN 
OPTION THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS 
BEEN PUSHING FOR FOR YEARS. 
>> HE ALSO SAID APPARENTLY THAT 
HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL MOVE 
AGGRESSIVELY TO REPEL EFFORTS 
TO INTERFERE IN THE 2018 
ELECTION BUT THERE WAS NO 
DETAILS ON WHAT THE MOVES MIGHT 
LOOK LIKE. 
>>NOT A WHOLE LOT OF DETAILS 
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS IN 
MIND OR HOW HE INTENDS TO PUSH 
BACK AGAINST -- THE RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENT -- TO GO ABOUT IN 
THE 2018 ELECTION. 
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS -- 
>>DO YOU THINK WHAT HE HAS SAID 
TODAY WILL UNDO SOME OF THE 
DAMAGE? 
CERTAINLY NOT IN THE EYES OF 
DEMOCRATS, WILL IT AT LEAST 
APPEASE REPUBLICANS? 
>> THIS CRITICISM FROM DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS THE WAY THE 
PRESIDENT -- AND MAKING AND 
ERROR AND ADMITTING THAT HE 
MADE AN ERROR LIKE THIS, THERE 
WILL BE LASTING DAMAGE WITH THAT
AND HE WILL FACE CRITICISM FOR 
THAT FOR A LONG TIME. 
IN TERMS OF THE ACUPRESSURE 
THAT WAS ON HIM EARLIER THIS 
MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON HE 
APPEARS TO BE DOUBLING DOWN ON 
HIS COMMENTS YESTERDAY. SOME OF 
THAT WILL EASE IN THE COMING 
DAYS AND HOURS BUT THERE WILL 
BE QUESTIONS AND CRITICISM FOR 
YEARS OVER YESTERDAY. 
>> ACCORDING TO NOTES COMING 
OUT OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 
TODAY HE APPARENTLY SPOKE A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HE AND 
PRESIDENT PUTIN DISCUSSED IN 
PRIVATE. 
HE SAID THEY DISCUSSED ISRAELI 
SECURITY, THEY DISCUSSED IRAN 
NUCLEAR AMBITIONS, THEY 
DISCUSSED NORTH KOREA, ANY 
OTHER DETAILS COMING TO LIGHT? 
>> JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
NORTH KOREA THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
WAS SUPPORTIVE OF THE U. S. 
EFFORTS TO TRY TO DO NUCLEAR AS 
THE PENINSULA. 
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF SPECIFICS OF 
WHAT THEY ACCOMPLISHED. 
WE DISCUSSED THIS AND WE 
DISCUSSED THAT, -- DESCRIBING 
THE PRESIDENT -- IN CRIMEA. 
HERE THE PRESIDENT IS A DAY 
LATE ON TIGHT TO PUT HIS SPIN. 
>>WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO 
TODAY? 
HE USUALLY STANDS HIS GROUND 
AND DOUBLE DOWN IN THE FACE OF 
CRITICISM IN THE SHORT-TERM, 
WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS OF HIS 
RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISM HE 
HAS RECEIVED? 
>> THIS IS CERTAINLY A DAY 
LATE. 
THE QUESTION IS WILL THIS BE A 
DOLLAR SHORT? 
WILL THIS BE ENOUGH TO QUELL 
THE CRITICISM HE HAS FACED -- 
AND THIS IS A RARE ADMISSION OF 
ERROR BY THIS PRESIDENT WHO SO 
OFTEN IN THE PLAYBOOK -- HE HAS 
GONE BACK AND DOUBLED DOWN -- 
HOW GLARING THE AIR HE MADE 
YESTERDAY WAS. 
THIS IS A STRIKING MOMENT BY THE
PRESIDENT. 
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE 
ALSO ADDRESSED HIS MEETING WITH 
THE QUEEN, ANOTHER MEETING THAT 
HE SAID IS A TERRIFIC PERSON, 
VERY INSPIRING. 
HE TALKED ABOUT OTHER THINGS AS 
WELL NOT JUST HELSINKI. 
>> YES. 
HE TRIED TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN 
ON THE TRIP. 
THERE IS STILL CRITICISM ABOUT 
THE NATO ALLIES AND THE WAY HE 
TREATED PRIME MINISTER MAY. 
EVEN AS HE WAS WALKING BACK THE 
RUSSIAN MEETING IN HELSINKI 
THAT IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT 
PART HE STILL TRY TO MAKE A 
POSITIVE. 
>> WE STILL HAVE ED O'KEEFE 
WITH US. 
ED I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK IN, 
THE PRESIDENT DID SAY THAT HE 
HAS FULL FAITH AND SUPPORT IN 
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES 
BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT RUSSIA'S 
ACTIONS HAD NO IMPACT, LET ME 
BE CLEAR. 
HE SEEMS TO WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THOSE TWO STATEMENTS ARE 
ATTACHED. 
>>THE ASSESSMENT SO FAR AND THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REITERATED 
THIS IN THE INDICTMENTS, WHILE 
RUSSIA DID ATTEMPT TO METAL, 
THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE RESULTS.
IT IS THAT PART, THE POTENTIAL 
CHANGING OF RESULTS OR EFFECT 
ON THE RESULTS THAT SEEMS TO BE 
THE MOST SENSITIVE ASPECT OF 
THIS TO THE PRESIDENT. 
HE DOES NOT WANT ANY SUGGESTION 
THAT HE DID NOT DO IT ON HIS OW
