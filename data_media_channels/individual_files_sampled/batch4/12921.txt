so he spoke last night at the University of Utah if you run down we have some pretty amazing information from there plus Hugh Hefner is dead and aside from talking First Amendment boobs will also talk about tax reform and where that is give you all of the information I'm Ben Shapiro this is Ben Shapiro show okay so I want to start by talking about Hugh Hefner because you have to his death is apparently a deep cultural moment you know the obituaries are just endless the New York Times ran a 3300 word obituary about a guy who's mostly famous for putting boobs in magazine which is pretty incredible live the life of an a Saudi oil Sheik but occasionally published John Updike and Norman Mailer and therefore I guess his entire life was just roses and nothing but we'll get to all of that and as you may have noticed I don't abide by this rule that when someone dies we have to pretend they were awesome so I'm gonna talk about the good the bad and the ugly and what Hugh Hefner meant to culture and what we should take away from that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at wink so does the current news cycle make you want to drink heavily if so I think it's the place

just terrific okay so I was going to begin with Trump anomic but it's more fun to talk about Hugh Hefner you're right I mean this is why Hugh Hefner is a cultural figure because we have to pretend that Hugh Hefner was a forward-thinking of the culture instead of basically a purveyor of pornography now none of this is to say that he doesn't have a First Amendment right to push his pornography I mean he did have a First Amendment right to push his pornography although I think there actually is a fairly decent argument under the First Amendment that the First Amendment was not supposed to cover up Senate II like I don't think that John Adams and James Madison were sitting around in 1789 thinking to themselves you know what we really need to protect Hugh Hefner with the money shot that's what we need to protect right but Robert Bork argues in his book talking about the First Amendment is that the First Amendment was essentially in trying to protect political speech that was the goal but let's assume that we're going to take a libertarian position on the First Amendment better the government should not regulate any of this that make government should regulate the wrong stuff so let's say that all the stuff is protected now the question becomes was Hugh Hefner's business good for the world or was it kind of bad for the world so what I've seen a lot of in the obits today is focus on stuff that is not Hugh Hefner's core business right it's in a lot of focus on the fact that you supported civil rights which is right terrific you know who else supported civil rights Rosa Parks you know what she didn't do pose nude right so this idea that Hugh Hefner is somehow culturally important because of civil rights is not the case okay let's be real about this you have Gray's famous because he was an old perv okay you use a perv from the time that he was young and he's a perv when he was super old and become a parody of himself he didn't become a different human he wasn't different at 30 than he was at 91 he's the exact same person he never changed and that's why it was so ridiculous watching him try to live the life of a 30 year old swinging bachelor when he was 91 and somebody added milk is prostate for him the whole thing is ridiculous so the New York Times runs this glowing obut of Hugh Hefner I didn't look it up I was I was trying to figure out whether they granted more time to Hugh Hefner Ronald Reagan they did grab more time to Ronald Reagan so good for the New York Times on that they granted more times if you happen to than William F Buckley which i think is sort of telling about where the Times stands on this but here's what they write and this is I don't have to give you indicators like this I'll just read you this glowing profile if you have not only one of the greatest human beings to have ever walked the earth because Moses Jesus you have nur so here is Hugh Hefner Hugh Hefner who created Playboy magazine and spun it into a media and entertainment industry giant all the while as it's very public avatar squiring attractive young women and sometimes marrying them well into his eighties died on Wednesday at his home the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles he was 91 hey what's imagine for a second that Donald Trump god forbid had died before he became president of the United States his obituary would read very much like this from the near times right Donald Trump man famous for swearing around young women and sometimes marrying them but now the New York Times doesn't like Donald Trump because Donald Trump's a political figure right on the on the right and therefore he's an evil by oh man with women evil and vile understand now I think that Hugh Hefner was pretty vile with women I think that trumps history is not particularly great with women I'm pretty consistent on this stuff but it is amazing how the politics shift how people view people's treatment of women I was enough to remember when feminists thought Hugh Hefner was gross but now he's sort of a hero right Hugh Hefner is great he liberated us from the constraint of our own sexual Puritanism first of all the arrogance in self aggrandizement on the 1960s generation feeling that they are the first to discover that it feels good when you put a penis in a vagina it's just incredible to me like I'm sorry people have known this since forever this is how evolution built humans and animals like there's nothing new here and treating it as though there was some sort of grand movement forward because you have her put boobs that men like in magazines and then slapped John Updike article between the boobs like this was the this is always the joke about Playboy right he'd put these kind of highfalutin essays in the middle of money shots with 18 year old girls and that was like ooh isn't he a sophisticate isn't he a sophisticate now wouldn't he have been more of a sophisticated he just I don't know published John Updike like maybe the only way he thought he could get people to read Updike was to put it between the boobs but I'm pretty sure that the main the main point of Playboy was the boobs and not the John Updike and he was just trying to facilitate his own fame and reputation for being a sophisticate by publishing highfalutin essays there's no difference in Playboy and hustler magazine except for the essays and this this bizarre cultural impression that Hugh Hefner was somehow a force for a tremendous good while Larry Flynt is just a smut purveyor anyway here is what the New York Times continues to write you know before I got there I want to say that it's you want to watch how America is evolved don't look at Hector look at the feminists take on after so the feminists take on Hefner in the in the 1960s was that Hefner was somebody who is helping to objectify women which was 100 true and then the feminist state became he's in power in limine he's given women the opportunity to do what exactly disrobe in front of men if they see fit and this is empowering okay like women always had that power because men have lizard brain and we like naked women I mean like I understand why it's like a very difficult concept and then it turned into no he's a cultural hero because he empowered women okay oh my really if you think that it is empowering to women to publish nude photos of them maybe the woman wants it but as a general that's the maybe empowering to that individual woman in that sense I suppose but is it empowering to women all over the United States that men are looking at lots of pictures of naked women if you think that's the case I would recommend you talk to a man one time like this many times and if you do you will recognize that men watch pornography are not on the side typically of being more empowered toward women and that's just not the way that this works men who have respect for women don't tend to rebel in pornography yeah because again there is something at odds of seeing something as human beings seeing someone as an actual object worthy of genuine affection love and respect anyway in the endless obituary continues Hefner the man and the playboy the brand were inseparable both advertise themselves as emblems of the sexual revolution an escape from American priggishness and wide our social intolerance both were derided over the years as vulgar as adolescents as exploitative and finally is anachronistic all of those criticisms are true but mr. Hefner was a stunning success success from the moment he emerge from the early 1950s his timing was perfect don't you understand he was slapping those Puritans right in the face I note about those sexual appearance into the 1940s they had more babies than any generation in American history they knew what sex was again again every generation seems to think that they're the only people have ever discovered sexual organs and it's just incredible today from people who are my age right people who are younger well my parents didn't know anything about sex but I know something about sex guess what your parents do you know well said their parents you know how I know this because you're here moron because he was compared to Jay Gatsby Citizen Kane and Walt Disney but mister Hepburn was his own production he repeatedly like in his led to a romantic movie and start an ageless sophisticated silk pajamas and smoking jacket hosting a never-ending party for famous and fascinating people well doesn't mean you have to like in his life to a romantic movie right he was a rich guy who got a bunch of women to disrobe in front of him who didn't have any affection for him and who are occupy man do you really think all these hot young 21 year olds we're like that hot on the 80 year olds creepy right he couldn't even sell his house because he insisted that he be allowed to live in the house and nobody wanted to live in the house with him he tried to sell his house in LA like a couple of years ago and no one was willing to buy it one of his preconditions is that he would be still wandering around the house and nobody wanted that guy wandering around the house in his bathrobe plus I mean what would it do to that home price again des if he backlight into place my goodness this is the first issue of Playboy was published in 1953 when mr. Hefner was 27 a new father married to buy his accounts the first woman he had slept with and I love this I'm gonna skip forward a little bit here because the what he says about his wife is really quite incredible about his his first wife he says still mr. Hefner wielded fierce resentment against his ear as sexual strictures which he said had choked off his own youth a virgin until he was 22 he married his longtime girlfriend dong dong dong dong horror of Horrors he was a virgin until he was married yeah that's what made his life empty and meaningless it wasn't the endless sex with a random bevy of women and the uselessness of his own and the uselessness of his own perspective no it was it really will really ruin him is that he didn't have sex until he was 22 I'm sure that that ruined his life just as it made meaningless lives at Thomas Aquinas just as it made meaningless the life of Jesus right all of these lives were meaningless if they'd had sex at 15 guess how much you know what they could have done you know what Thomas Aquinas would have thought if that's what he had an orgasm at age 16 can you just imagine me it's so stupid I was married at 23 I was a virgin until I was married it was a good decision you know why because the only person I have ever had sex with is my wife we're gonna be married for 10 years I promise you my life is significantly more fulfilling then Hugh Hefner's what he's I'm not gonna die lonely and alone as Napa said he lived as he died Nevada I'm not gonna die lonely and alone surrounded by people who don't know me and don't really care about me it's just this idea that the promulgation by the media of the idea that he was living a lifestyle that is something that you I'm elated is truly amazing and it's truly amazing from the same newspaper by the way they will talk to routinely about toxic masculinity autocracy leader is James Bond sexist what what I mean a week ago everybody in the media was saying that Clay Travis was just a bore for saying on national television that he believes in two things the First Amendment in boobs that was basically Hugh Hefner slogan and now it's a thirty three hundred word a little bit in the New York Times so first endogenous Oakland

the government should be banning pornography or the government should be involved in the process of doing this the point I'm making is the D cultural celebration a vulgar ization of the culture the idea that this was somehow a broadening of the public mind that decide who's made better by this not all exercise of rights are useful doesn't mean they should be banned right well what I said a couple of days ago with regard to for example kneeling for the so anthem is that do you have a right to do that of course you have a right to do that right here your employer can do something about it but you have a right under the First Amendment to not be punished by government for doing that every right contains the possibility of misusing the right we're using it in a way that's Delmore counterproductive the First Amendment may contain the right to publish nude photos of women but to glorify sin say that this is some sort of cultural step forward for women is just ridiculous you could have a feminist movement without women posing nude you could mrs. o this is always been my critique a third way defendant third wave feminism first wave feminism said men are acting like pigs they're borrowing us from the workplace we should be able to get the jobs that we want and we should be treated unequal par with men totally agree with that right is why my wife's a doctor my mom worked my dad stayed home but the third wave feminism basically said men act like pigs they're gross they treat women badly you know what that's standard they have a different standard for us they want us to be all princesses in the ivory tower instead of demanding the men be gentlemen instead get rid of the ivory tower entirely no rules for anyone no rules for anyone that does not mean that I'm in favor of sexual law okay I'm not again I think the government is really bad at promulgating this sort of thing but I am in favor of social standards that that actually instill virtue this is why I'm in favor of people going to church why I'm in favor of you instilling virtue in your children you want to have a happier life live a virtuous life this has become a very controversial of light and virtue and Happiness are connected but the ancients never thought that in fact Aristotle connected virtue with happiness the definition of happiness was living in accordance with virtue which meant living in accordance with your purpose unless you think your purpose on this earth he's to masturbate as much as humanly possible Hugh Hefner was not a man driving you torture he was not a man who's helping to instill virtue so you know that this this thing goes on and on and on this is the Playboy philosophy advocated freedom of speech and all of its aspects for which mr. Heflin runs civil liberties Awards he supported progressive social costs and lost some sponsors by inviting black guests to his televised parties of time and much of the nation still had Jim Crow laws again Leonard Bernstein invited black people to his parties to be no naked women running around there the idea that it was necessary to to use sex as a lever in order to break open be hidebound stupidities of things like Jim Crow the hive and evil things like to Carl I just don't think it's true and you know who would have agreed with me people like Martin Luther King who was a preacher well it's it's I rely I seriously object to the idea that Hugh Hefner is somebody who ought to be emulated or whose life we ought to celebrate particularly when the central point of his life was not civil right stuff the central point of his life was that he wanted people to be able to get nudie magazines that's all 3,300 words on Hugh Hefner 3,000 words on William F Buckley the founder of the modern conservative movement just just amazing again we agree as a society tend to think it's true in politics too that we have to swallow the chaff with the wheat we can't tell what you know if you want if you want Republicans to or conservatives to be in the White House and it has to come through Donald Trump if you want to win the culture war then you have to go along with the vulgar is a ssin of the culture I don't think that's true I don't think that's true I think you can fight for good things without utilizing bad methods and without embracing bad things I think you can fight for civil rights without embracing the idea that that men should treat women like disposable objects and when they age out of their beauty and you just throw them by the side of the road which is Hugh Hefner's entire ideology okay so enough about Hugh Hefner um he is wherever he is today I'm sad for him that I think that he wasted his life I'm not gonna make any bones about that I do think that he wasted his life because I think the obvious is a very bright guy could have done a lot more to to make the world a better place then promulgate the idea that promiscuity was virtue and he didn't do all bad things he did some good things but when you see somebody who does good things and does bad once you just wish they had done a lot more good things and a lot fewer bad things but I want to talk a little bit about the next step for Republicans on Capitol Hill so Republicans on Capitol Hill have now moved on from health care so great job on health care guys just stellar stellar perch so we now have we're now well Trump took office in January it is now the end of September so they have been off and they've been in office for nine months there is no wall they've not revoked Iran do their if President Trump is working hard on making sure that daca is rien trying they've not lowered the budget they've not cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and now we're gonna move on to not passing tax reform that I guess is the next item on the agenda so Trump's tax he's proposing increase increases taxes apparently on people who are in the upper tax bracket now what's funny to me is all the people who are lamenting this today like Trump didn't say this on the campaign trail come to this repeatedly on the campaign trail from said many times on the campaign trail that he would increase taxes on the rich who did a famous Good Morning America feel in which he said taxes on people like me they'll go up those texts they'll come up on people like me I pay I make enough money right because this is his populist routine its popular it's kind of done the reason 10 of them is because people who are paying the vast majority of federal taxes in the United States are the people who make the most money so when we say we're gonna raise taxes on the rich but lower it for everyone else it's kind of hard to lower taxes for people who are actually getting net benefits from the government so in the United States 20 2011 as the Congressional Budget Office the highest quintile people who make above 235 thousand dollars a year in the United States we're paying on average for the federal government nearly 58 thousand dollars in taxes per year the fourth quintile people making above eighty four thousand dollars a year they're paying about fourteen thousand eight hundred dollars to the federal government the third quintile about 50 thousand bucks a year they were paying seventy four hundred dollars to the federal government the second quintile about 30 grand a year they're paying thirty two hundred dollars to the federal government and the lowest quintile about fifteen thousand five hundred dollars but lower than thirty thousand were paying five hundred bucks to the federal government but that's not the entire story a lot of these quintiles receive net benefits back from the federal government in the form of disability in the form of food stamps in the form of welfare in the form of state sponsored benefits Social Security right there are there are a lot of benefits that go back to these various quintiles when you factor in how much money people are receiving back from the federal government in checks in actual transfer payments what you find out is that the richest 20% of Americans are paying virtually all in that federal revenue to the government nearly all of it according to Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute the richest 20% of Americans by income aren't just paying a share of federal taxes that would be considered fair there are shouldering almost 100% of the entire federal tax burden of transfer payments and all other non financed government spending so the idea that you're raising taxes on the rich because the return' paying their fair share it's just not factually true but this is an unpopular thing right see this is it Republicans try to pass a tax cut because they say those for economic growth will talk about deficits in a second whenever Republicans say that they want to pass a tax cut cause it'll sprechen on the growth people are left over they just want to cut taxes for their rich they're a crony rich friend here's the reality it's very difficult to cut taxes on people who are not paying a lot of taxes in the first place and if you want to spur economic growth I have never worked for somebody who only makes $50,000 a year the people you work for are typically the people in the top quintile and by the way those people are not stagnant people go into the top quintile pull out of the top quintile yeah idea that there's 1% screwing the bottom 99% is just not factually true the number of people who are in the 1% 10 years ago who are now and the 1% is really love people move up and down in terms of income all throughout their life when you're 20 years old you're probably in the bottom three quintiles by the time you're 40 you're probably in the upper two you're the same person we're you a bad person when you were when you're 14 you're a good person when you're 20 so this idea that it's this group of people who are screwing people to get in the top 1% for example it's just not true and if you're on economic growth you're naturally going to have to cut taxes for the people who are capable of investing money so the people who are actually capable of consumption because those are the people who are paying the tax but nobody's willing to say that cuz that's unpopular so instead they say things like we're gonna cut taxes for the middle class and raise them on the wealthy right people will actually pay the vast bulk of taxes so that is what Trump is saying today which is a betrayal of his conservative base but it's not really a betrayal of what he was saying and this was the problem with Trump all the way through is that Trump throughout his campaign was sending mixed messages I'll never raise taxes on the rich but it might raise taxes on the rich guys and you see this you know even from his own administration is pretty consistent message so you'll see Ted Cruz for example talking about how we need a tax cut desperately here's senator Cruz from Texas making these apples but if you want to see reagan-era economic growth if you want to see booming GDP small businesses growing you've got to have Reagan style tax cuts real tax cuts not just deficit neutral adjusting emptying one bucket and filling another you got to have a real tax cut on small businesses on job producers on working families that's how we unleash the economy okay so you have Cruz they're making the typical conservative case now there's Steve Newton the Treasury secretary making precisely the opposite case from the Trump administration as it relates to the high end you know there's lots of changes we're getting rid of lots of deductions we're trying to get rid of state and local deductions to get the federal government out of subsidizing it and yes I can tell you the current plan for many many people it will not reduce taxes on the high end okay so there you have a mixed message from the Republican Party this is why tax reform will be difficult because there are going to be some people who say we're not willing to allow you to raise taxes on the on the highest earners and then you're going to see a bunch of people who say we have to raise taxes on the highest earners so there's no guarantee they even get through tax reform here especially because they have to do tax reform through essentially a fifty one-vote majority they only have 52 votes and they have to show that the tax reform is deficit neutral if they want to use reconciliation right so again it's gonna be very hard to show that a tax cut is revenue neutral in general unless you show some spending offsets unless so that means you need 60 votes in the Senate in order to PACs Castro tax reform so that's not the easiest thing in the world my talk about deficits in just a second and what the Republican and conservative perspective should be on tax cuts versus deficits it's really a two-sided argument now I discuss both sides and you can sort of make up your own mind on that but first I want to say thank you to our friends over at Skillshare so as I was saying if you want to develop a skill set that is going to serve you wife long you have to keep developing it's not the days of your parents job market where you could

and use that promo code Shapiro Skillshare slash capiro in order to let them know that we sent you okay so and they hear this this brings up a second question with regard to taxes the Republicans have been split on every day ever since really the days of Paul Volcker who is the Treasury secretary or the Fed Reserve Chairman rather under under President Reagan and that is do you want to expand deficit but lower taxes is that one of your goals now there's some disco Hawks who say listen the economy this quarter grew at three point one percent that's good rate and the reason it's a good rate and this is this shows you by the way that doing nothing is actually really good for the economy as a general rule there's this idea that radical change for the economy doesn't harm the economy one of the reasons the economy stagnated during President Obama is recovering at the weakest post-war recovery in American history the reason for that is because there was so much uncertainty about how exactly businesses we're going to be able to operate there's been an issue in the regulation tomorrow was gonna pass a tax increase businesses have faith the Trump isn't gonna do anything to dramatically harm the economy and so they're now spending money that they were not spending before and that is creating new jobs they're investing and they're growing right so right now it's we need a tax cut listen we've always need lower taxes as somebody who pays an enormous amount of taxes to the government every year I would personally be hiring more people if I didn't have to pay those taxes from by the way is wavering on some of this you know sighs who wants a twenty percent corporate tax rate after saving more than fifteen percent tax rate the entire election cycle but the real question is if you are going to pass tax cuts and you're not gonna focus at all on entitlement reform you're just going to continue blowing out the ducks in the short term now the argument that you're going to expand the pie to the government increases in in its in its capacity to bring in tax revenue as the economy increases so this is the idea of static versus dynamic modeling static modeling says that the economy is a given size if you take a higher tax rate that means that the government's can take more of that money that's static dynamic means the economy doesn't stay at one size when you give tax cuts that increases the economy it did so for JFK it did so for dragan it did so for george w bush and that increasing economy is going to mean that a smaller percentage is still a bigger absolute number right a smaller percentage of $100,000 is still a bigger absolute number than a hundred percent of $100 that's sort of the logic here that's true but in the long run what is really going to heal the economy of the united states is not tax cut so much as it is entitlement reform which is Paul Ryan's thing and that's the thing that Trump won't touch that's the thing that Trump won't touch because that is the third rail saying to people we're going to have to restructure of Medicare same to people we're gonna have to restructure Social Security that is the truth that is the truth what is going to bankrupt this country is not a bush tax cut it is not a war in Iraq or Afghanistan well will bankrupt the country is this looming time bomb of the amount of money that we owe to people we're gonna be on Medicare in the very near future on Social Security in the very near future the only way those people are going to make their money is if we either increase taxes radically borrow radically which we can't do forever or inflate the dollar that's really the methane or we can cut benefit which we shouldn't do now but we should structure it so that there is a trailing benefit that's what we should do because I've never been missing my Social Security money entitlement reform would be better for the future of the country than a tax cut tax cuts were more politically profitable so with the Republican majority what I would suggest is that Republicans start pushing both the Republicans start pushing both and that entitlement reform is the more important of the two do the Republicans have the guts to do that I doubt it they couldn't even pass tax reform I mean I mean they can't then impacts health health care reform which they've been campaigning on for seven years but that's the real looming time bomb in all of this so what's interesting about this is with all these divisions inside the Republican Party some leadership would be really great right now you know presidents from saying here's what I want here's why we want it make the case to the American people take that bully pulpit that he's got and go and bully a little bit rank stop talking by the NFL so much and go out and start talking about here's my plan here's why it's gonna do the Ronald Reagan thing take out a chart and show people how this works but that's not what Trump is doing that's not what Trump is doing and that's a problem I want to talk about that problem in how Republicans are reacting to that problem I also want to talk about some more of the NFL fallout but for all of

appreciate it we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so with the Republican Party's so split this is the time where presidential leadership is really necessary for Alabama was good at this george w bush's go to this trump unfortunately gets easily distracted if you've ever seen the movie up trump is basically the dog right it's just there's a squirrel and it runs by and then trump goes well and then you just run down this world and this is not a useful quality when you actually mean single-minded focus to wrangle the herd of cats but you need the dog to wrangle the cats you don't need the dog to chase the squirrel that's what i'm trying to tell you here and right now the dog is not wrangling the cats in the in the senate so trump is spending his time still moaning about why health care didn't pass and he's he's saying things that are actually not true about health care he's saying that health care reform didn't pass because dad cochran the senator from Mississippi was in the hospital no that wouldn't made any difference at all they didn't have the votes for it but Trump keeps saying this kind of stuff right here's from talking about health care I also want to provide a brief update on health care we have the votes on Graham Cassidy okay you said that we but Eden so there is that um and then you have Paul Ryan and what's weird is that you can have the situation where Trump is really necessary to push this thing forward and he's not doing what he needs to do but everybody is afraid enough of crossing him that they're just going to continue paying him homage which doesn't create an incentive for him to actually do the right thing so Paul Ryan who I mean I've never seen a person become as uncomfortable in his own skin as Paul Ryan over the last year there's something desperately funny about watching videos of Paul Ryan trying to push policy into the absolute void that is our current political discussion like in the middle of the NFL debate earlier this week Paul Ryan just tweeted out a video of himself talking about tax reform and how he's pushing for a better way and it was like it really was like Kevin Bacon in Animal House and everybody behind him is screaming and beating each other with clubs and he's going everyone stay calm it's all fine everything is good here so he's on with sean hannity last night and sean obviously is a huge trump in and here's paul ryan bending the knee to to president Truong what's your relationship with it's very good it's a very opposite edge we have a great relationship but we happy with this presidents be very happy but you don't have that in the house representatives have caucuses every week you don't hear that kind of talk from them from the house representative I have not heard it from House members so you don't hear that from House members look I think the president is giving us the kind of leadership we need to get this country back on the right track he's so happy so yeah all right super happy with the leadership montañés but he knows that if he crosses President Trump then from start slapping Ryan instead of slapping McConnell any connection really funny it's turned into basically a Three Stooges routine where Trump knocks Ryan on the head and Ryan pokes takes his fingers and pokes McDonald in the eyes and then that's basically why nothing's getting done because we're all laughing in slapstick here's Ryan bashing McConnell yesterday on Sean's show of course I'd like to see them do majority votes on these thirty ever ask McConnell we've talked about a lot I don't think that they don't devotes therefore that's just this flat simple answer so what do I do is that house we don't even get the votes to get that dug anyway there's many of in charge of the rules is the Manoa today I don't think there's enough Republicans to vote for that because they worry that when liberals take over government liberals will ran through was a legend but they're okay so and then he pulls out a chart actually and he shows a chart of how many bills the house has passed and how many bills the Senate has passed and of course the Senate passed nothing so he's slapping McConnell for that and basically it's it's signal to trunk please don't slap me I'm your friend mr. Trump please leave me alone the president's fear is not being used in the proper way okay the fear of the presidency is not being used in the proper way you got a wheel you got a deal this was the stuff Tony said he was good at remember Trump promised this was all going to be easy he said it over and over and the guarantee was gonna be easy as that who's a great businessman who was awesome at making deals right this was his shtick his entire stick was it's gonna be so easy it's gonna make your head swim we're gonna win we're gonna win we're never gonna stop winning we're just gonna win forever right why because all these people can't make deals I'm a deal maker look at me I'm a deals hon boobie you know is it it's but that's not what's happening and instead it's it's funny because where he should be herding cats instead it's just him running after the latest squirrel and the Republicans using that as an excuse to bolt and look no no some of this isn't Trump's fault like it's not Trump's fault but the Senate can't get together but it is a missed opportunity and that's fronts fault so South Trump's fault the McCain and Susan Collins and Rand Paul can't get on the same page of course they get on the same page but it certainly doesn't help when the President of the United States his final health care push is the Colin Kaepernick's a jerk right his last health care push if you recall a few months ago his final health care push there was Jeff Sessions is a jerk his own attorney general so like if he would focus a little bit that would be really really helpful and I don't see an incentive for him to focus so long as Republicans keep saying how great he is and and Trump threatens them that if they don't work with him he still walk across the street to his good friends Nancy and Chuck it's it here's the thing I'm not sure that the fear of Trump is particularly justified what I mean by this is that people are not vote and like people as I said yesterday if you slap Trump openly then people get mad at you right if you say is politician that I think Trump's doing a crappy job then people get angry at you in the Republican Party because they think you're being disloyal to a guy they all voted for him that much is true and that's why I don't think that you know it's incumbent on Paul Ryan I think from suing the crappy job but I think that when he's asked about it he should say no I think President Trump you know has the right principles in mind but I would love to see him really push that to the American public more right trying to prompt him in the right direction that he can do and that's not being done the reason that I think that can be done is because you actually saw that happen in Alabama right Trump actually endorsed the candidate lost and the tea party people who have been really driving this movement since 2010 pushed Roy Moore instead and they went right over Trump's head and Roy Moore wasn't seen as an enemy of Trump so long as he said that he liked Trump everything was fine so I think so long as you say that you don't hate Trump then you can actually make the case for conservative principles I'm not sure that the fear of Trump is justified that if Trump brings the hammer to you you're inherently finished I think you have to do one very specific thing that it's going to Trump personally and then people get mad at you but if you say you think Trump needs to do a better job I don't think that people are going to get particularly happy with you plus the idea that Trump is is somebody who is going to do anything just fulminating on Twitter is I think a little bit exaggerated the deep truth about Trump is that Trump doesn't actually like getting into conflict where he's personally responsible it's kind of weird like Trump and Trump likes to talk the language of conflict but he doesn't like to fire people he doesn't like to openly break with people he likes to keep his options open much like Hugh Hefner he likes to keep his options open and so here for example you know Tom Price is helping Human Services Secretary he can't be happy that um price Tom price was taking government jets different places and spent a lot of money didn't do much on the healthcare vote and here was Trump being asked about Tom price yesterday and here is Trump's response personally I'm not happy about it I have not I am not happy about it and I let him know and that's what Trump said is you recall about Jeff Sessions and he says it's about a lot of his people that he's not happy about them but then he doesn't really fire them he doesn't really fire them the only person that he's legitimately fired in his administration was James Comey he tried to pawn that off on Brad Rosen state rights today so he actually doesn't like follow up firing people so you know I think that you can push Trump without him spewing all over you except maybe a little bit on Twitter and I think the Republicans should prod him in the right direction if they don't and it's just gonna be squirrel chasing from here for the rest of the presidency okay so now on to the NFL fallout meanwhile well I talked about the dysfunction on the right this function on the left is just increasing at an equal or greater pace whatever the the poop storm that is that is begun on the right it is twice that on the left the language that is being used the polarizing language that really alienates Americans on these issues being used by the left being embraced by Democrats is truly astonishing so Spike Lee who is obviously somebody who is considered by the leftist civil rights hero and civil rights leader the filmmaker he is using a sort of polarizing language that is not gonna benefit Democrats it really doubles down on the identity politics the Democrats have embraced it's not gonna be good for Democrats and it's not good for the country they're taking the opportunity of they don't like Trump to go as radical as they possibly can which i think is so stupid I mean if Trump makes mistake why don't you just call him on the mistake is what I've been saying to people on the left forever I don't get it if you think Trump's making mistake why don't you just say here's the mistake you're making and here's why it's bad instead of it's the end of the world the sky is falling we're all gonna die he's a racist the cake cake cake cake cake came will be outside my house in the morning like you're not doing anyone any favors by always turning that knob to love and hear Spike Lee turning the knob cast 11 if you're turning the knob off the off the stereo just go on now it's rolling around on the floor somewhere you're Spike Lee it's like like the owners or the the plantation owners and the guys playing a league you know they're on the plantation you can't say anything and so the thing is really escalated because he compares the NFL owners to members of a plan that plantation owners hey those guys make millions of dollars a year and they are paid to play a sport it is not like a plantation and it's deeply insulting to people who lived in Lavery and some who still from slavery you suggest that people in the NFL are like plantation owners every business if you had a belt decided tomorrow and they actually wanted to make the players stand up or they would suspend them or find them maybe well within their rights to do that so I think they ought to do that at this point I don't think they ought to do that but is that something that the NFL could do and has the right to DX would that make them plantation owners absolutely not any more than any business has rules I said this even about chains tomorrow at Google I think Google was wrong to fire James d'amour for for putting out a memo that seemed to me largely well reason did they have the right to do it of course they had the right to do it didn't make them plantation owners no I mean he had a job for which he was being paid they didn't like it was a fireman like that was bad that was wrong but that's not the equivalent of living on a plantation Steph Curry is doing some of his polarizing language too so he was talking about the Sports Illustrated cover we mentioned yesterday Sports Illustrated is trying to take the tactic of the kneeling isn't about the anthem it's not about the flag and signing about police brutality it's about opposition trunks with dated is they alighted Colin Kaepernick from their cover and some people on the left are understandably angry about this they say Kaepernick started this movement why isn't he on the cover with the rest of us standing up to police brutality what they don't understand is the more you tie yourself to Colin Kaepernick that's what he's an anchor on your movement if you want to tie your leg to Colin Kaepernick's like you are going down and those waves will follow you immediately Steph Curry doesn't seem to really get that here he is Sports Illustrated you're right in the middle but kaepernick how do you feel about that I was terrible this kind of capitalize the median or the real people that understand the exact who's really been active in local truly making a difference Kaepernick is super unpopular with the American people the American people don't like Kaepernick's protests they don't want people fired but they don't like it and the more the left eye's itself to Kaepernick this is where it Trump's little little routine has worked very well actually is that the left instead of saying we have the right to standards kneel as we see fit they said we like Colin Kaepernick he's a hero again that overreach is not smart politics Michelle Obama engaged in some very not smart identity politics yesterday here she is saying that any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against women generally she told this audience at this conference in Boston there's just one piece of it quote any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice what does it mean for us as women that we look at these two candidates as women and many of us said that guy he's better for me his voice is more true to me well to me that just says you don't like your voice you like the thing women don't like their own voice if they didn't vote for Hillary Clinton maybe they just didn't like Hillary Clinton's voice because she's a crazy old bat like maybe many people just didn't like Hillary Clinton because she's really off-putting as a candidate and now off-putting as a human being maybe that's why the left has to engage in this identity politics you really think you're gonna win back the white women who voted majority for Trump by saying that they didn't understand what it was like to be a woman and so they didn't vote for Hillary Clinton this is that really the direction you wanted to left us is that really the picture on me so I say there's dysfunction on the left this is the dysfunction on the left it is function on the right they can't get their act together they don't have any centralizing principle and so they're fragmenting in every possible direction and unable to get anything done the fragmentation on the left is less a fragmentation than a movement toward a more unpopular politics that makes the country worse in the nature of identity politics I'm frankly I'm shocked that Michelle Obama came out and said that because I think it's you're smarter than that that's just dumb politics but for her to do that it just demonstrates how far down the rabbit hole the Democrats are with regard to this identity politics okay time for some things I like and then we'll do some things that I hate so things that I like so I was a University of Utah last night with a fantastic event packed house enthusiastic audience it was really quite wonderful there are protesters outside some people got violent three people were arrested watch steven crowder show tonight okay steven crowder has a show tonight apparently went undercover not gay Jerrod went undercover is producer went undercover with antifa and the film is truly amazing so we'll play click Submit tomorrow on the show but if you don't get a chance watch Crowder show tonight Crowder and in his great journalistic work you should go check it out tonight and aloud with Crowder go check it out it's really really amazing stuff I've seen some of the footage it's truly amazing so we're gonna do because we're new top I'm gonna do Mormon related things that I like and things that I hate so things that I like Mormon related so there's a movie that came out in 2003 didn't get a lot of play but it's actually quite at the movies called Saints and soldiers found World War two it's a world war two movie in which it's basically a band of American soldiers trying to make it out from behind enemy lines in I think it's in Belgium and and back across to American lines and the main character is a guy who carries around the Book of Mormon with him and it's it's actually quite a moving film sort of about the role of religion in in viewing virtue and the role of heroism and and also the role of redemption in you've made mistakes you've done things that are wrong and what can you do to redeem yourself the movie has Saints in soldiers who's a little bit of the preview Alan Moore's reported American combat persecuted by their german cancer near the Belgian town of mama D an unknown number of Germans are making a push towards in town for their strippers nursery behind enemy lines has pushed through all of them here trapped deep behind enemy lines okay so the movies actually quite good and you should check it out of town Amazon Prime so if you're a Prime member then you can watch that for free I don't have done it flicks but it is well worth watching it again I like movies that take seriously the contentions of religion even if you don't believe in all the particular doctrines of a particular faith like take religion seriously one of my pet peeves about a lot of atheists is they do this routine where they'll say things like if you're a religious person how do you you know do religious people even know like how can you how could there be a god if bad things happen in the world have you even thought of that hmm and say yes we've thought of that yes we yes every religious thinker in history has taken on this question like do some basic research like please for the love of Pete if you're gonna rip on religion like do some research okay time for some things I hate we'll do a Mormon related things I hate okay so the thing that I hate today is the musical The Book of Mormon the Book of Mormon is it's very clever I mean I think that it's it's got stuff that's funny it's super vulgar which makes sense does the guys who wrote South Park wrote the Book of Mormon it is it is clever the thing that I hate about it is the scorn that it shows for for Mormonism as a faith by mocking its central beliefs let's be straight about religion in general organized religion in general most religions make miraculous claims now I think some of those miraculous claims are more ludicrous than others but virtually every major religion makes claims about miracles and at a certain point you're gonna have to take a leap of faith mocking those leaps of faith to me is just sneering at is sneering at somebody else without recognizing your own vulnerability on these issues now there's also something to me it's a little bit off-putting about targeting Mormons who are legitimately like the nicest people in America I said last night at the beginning of my speech that this is the only state in the Union where I'm the least clean-cut guy in the state I mean Mormons as the Mormons that I know the Mormons that in general that I know are the nicest cleanest cut people with wonderful families and ripping on the Mormons is so it's like hitting a puppy like really the Mormons that those are the people that you're gonna rip up if you really had any guts a night Trey stone and Matt Parker do have you have got because they'd actually tried to go after like drawing cartoons of Muhammad on South Park but let's just put it this way welcome a Mormon came out and the people in the Mormon Church were accurate they said they were actually happy about it because you gave them an opportunity to actually hand out more copies in the Book of Mormon and recruit right if they've done if they've done the book of Mohammed okay every theater in the United States would now be on fire okay there would be legitimate Isis terrorist attacks on theaters in the United States they put out the book of mom so it seems like it's an easy target here's one of the songs from the from the show that is supposed to demonstrate sort of the naivete of Mormons by the way it's when I say that this week's people here's what I mean I get off the plane yesterday and I come down into the baggage claim area and there's a huge crowd of people they're not waiting for me of course they're they're waiting for people are coming who are coming back from Mission a huge crowd of people families with signs say people who've gone abroad trying to help people and these people like these kids who are out helping people you know how many 17 18 year old kids do you know we're spending a couple of years of their life going out and helping random people or in dire poverty and they're being celebrated by their families these beautiful families who are saying to them congratulations on doing something good for the world it's the opposite you have her congratulations and doing something good for the world these are the people who you're gonna mock these are the people who are gonna say are the problem so here's here's the number from the Book of Mormon again doing the very easy thing of mocking somebody's ludicrous religious beliefs which again I can do the same thing about scientific materialism scientific materialism is based on premises that cannot pop hold he central contentions of scientific materialism under scientific materialism you cannot argue for truth you cannot argue for reason you cannot argue argue through logic you can't give an argument scientific method by the tenants of scientific materialism if I can mock to death this stuff I don't do that because I think that it's worth taking seriously other people's claimed anyway here is here's a number from the Book of Mormon ever since I was a child I tried to be the best so what happened my family and friends all said I was blessed so what happened you're supposed to be all so exciting to be teaching a Christ's cross the sea but I allowed my faith to be shaken Oh what's the matter with me I've always along to help the needy to do the things I never dared this was the time for me to step up so then why was I so scared a warlord who shoots people in the face what's so scary about that I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back now I must be completely devout I can't have even once I believe the Lord got read in the universe I sent His only Son to die for my sins okay so this is the part that I that I hate about this is the idea so you that last lyric there again is it funny of course it's easy to make fun of people's religious beliefs super super easy but when he says things like I believe that the Lord God created the universe I believe that Jesus died for my sins I believe that the the ancient Jews sailed on boats to America and then the audience laughs it is that all of these beliefs are equally stupid and all of these beliefs are equally ignorant and what this guy is doing he's just doing because he's in 94 and that's the idea is that religious people are naive fools who believe they can make the world a better place with their belief in this giant spaghetti monster in the sky that is super dismissive of what religious people have done what religious people have built and what religious people actually believe talk to a religious person sometime if you think that religious people have never thought about the ridiculousness and some of the things that we believe and the leaps of faith that we have to make you've never talked to a religious person and we're not just all fools who go around and thinking to ourselves well you know every word of the Bible is not only literally true but I don't see why anyone can't believe it okay if you don't doubt you're not a religious person that's what faith means faith means not only they have doubts but that you live with the doubts and you wrestle with the doubts every day this is why I love to say that the word Israel right I'm a member of the nation of Israel now I'm a Nissen I write that word in the Bible means struggles with God and overcomes that's what it means that's what it means to be a religious person and it seems to me that if you're gonna do a musical about religious people it should look a lot more like movie silence from Martin Scorsese and a lot less like like the Book of Mormon okay so we'll be back here tomorrow and I will be back from our beautiful studios in Los Angeles and I look forward to seeing you then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
