1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,007
STATEMENT?

2
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:05,243
HOWIE: AND HIS LEAKS EARLIER.

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:07,111
WE'LL TALK NEXT SEGMENT MORE

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:07,778
ABOUT THIS.

5
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:09,313
THE PRESIDENT COMES BACK FROM

6
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,915
NORTH KOREA AND PUTS UP THIS

7
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:13,885
TWEET AND REALLY HARSH WORD FROM

8
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:14,785
THE MEDIA.

9
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:16,921
SO FUNNY TO WATCH THE FAKE NEWS.

10
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,423
THEY ARE FIGHTING HARD TO DOWN

11
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:21,659
PLAY THE DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA.

12
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,629
OUR COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ENEMY IS

13
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:29,400
THE FAKE NEWS SO EASILY

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,435
PROMULGATED BY FOOLS.

15
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:36,974
WHEN HE SAYS BIGGEST ENEMY I

16
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,843
THINK IT'S TOO MUCH.

17
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:41,412
MOLLIE: HE SAID FAKE NEWS IS AN

18
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:42,480
ENEMY.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,517
JUST SPEAKING -- WE NEED TO MAKE

20
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,953
SURE WE ARE TELLING ACCURATE

21
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:50,354
FACTS.

22
00:00:50,354 --> 00:00:52,890
ON THIS I.G. REPORT WE HAD TWO

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,559
MAJOR STORY LINES THAT HAVE BEEN

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,060
IF YOU ARED THE LAST YEAR.

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,896
ONE THAT IT WAS WRONG TO FIRE

26
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,097
JAMES COMEY.

27
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:01,899
THIS I.G. REPORT CONFIRMS

28
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,669
EVERYTHING HE SAID ABOUT ROD

29
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:06,204
ROSENSTEIN'S BAD DECISION MAKING

30
00:01:06,204 --> 00:01:10,241
AND FAILURE TO ADHERE TO

31
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,877
AUTHORITY AND USURPATION AND THE

32
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:13,211
LIKE.

33
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,346
WE ARE TOLD YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED

34
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:16,647
TO CRITICIZE THE FBI.

35
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:18,249
THEY ARE BEYOND REPROACH.

36
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:20,218
AND THIS REPORT SHOWS THEY ARE

37
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:23,054
NOT BEYOND REPROACH.

38
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,922
CRITICIZING THE FBI AND CARING

39
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:28,159
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,526
IMPORTANT.

41
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:32,463
HOWIE: BIGGEST ENEMY?

42
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:33,998
MARIE: THE PRESIDENT USES FAKE

43
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:36,334
NEWS TO GO AFTER MEDIA

44
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,536
ORGANIZATIONS TO REPORT STORIES

45
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:39,670
HE DOESN'T LIKE.

46
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,105
THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH FAKE

47
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:41,906
NEWS.

48
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:45,042
BUT TO LINK THE NORTH KOREA

49
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,445
SUMMIT AND HIS FLOWERY TALK

50
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,480
ABOUT HOW GREAT KIM JONG-UN IS,

51
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,616
CALLING THE AMERICAN PRESS THE

52
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,851
GREATEST ENEMY IN OUR COUNTRY.

53
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,821
THAT SHOULD DISTURB EVERYONE ON

54
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,956
THE RIGHT, ON THE LEFT AND IN

55
00:01:58,956 --> 00:01:59,857
THE CENTER.

56
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,392
IT HAS CONSEQUENCES.

57
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:04,462
HOWIE: I SEE A DISTINCTION

58
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:06,998
BETWEEN FAKE NEWS AND BIGGEST

59
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:07,565
ENEMY.

60
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,900
SARA: YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS

61
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,737
AS PART OF TRUMP'S PLAYBOOK.

62
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:16,040
HE KNOWS THAT HELPS DRIVE THAT

63
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,908
POPULIST MOVEMENT THAT GOT HIM

64
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:18,609
ELECTED.

65
00:02:18,609 --> 00:00:00,000
IF HE CAN DIMINISH THE FAKE NEWS
