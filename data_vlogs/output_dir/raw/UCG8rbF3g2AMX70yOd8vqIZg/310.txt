00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,620

00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,120
 

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,620
 

5
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,480
 

6
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,560
 

7
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,060
 

8
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,560
 

9
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,060
 

10
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,560
 

11
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,560

12
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,780
 

13
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,280
 

14
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:12,880
Welcome to the Logang. I know I've probably got a couple watching.

15
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,320
Good mornin' guys. Welcome to the Logang
Welcome to the Logang. I know I've probably got a couple watching.

16
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,320
I know I've probably got a couple watching (voice starts getting scratchy)

17
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,820
watching me

18
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,320
maybe it's because they saw the roast

19
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,820
and they were like yo

20
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,320
and they were like yo

21
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,820
i don't know why imma Jake Pauler

22
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,320
I don't know why imma Jake Pauler

23
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,720
anymore imma go to the Logang

24
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,300
 

25
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,000
Or maybe they're like

26
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,700
"Yo I-I want Logan to explain himself" Whatever, hi!

27
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,600
Today is the day that uh the diss track against my brother goes live

28
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,400
And it's actually not live yet but I woke up um to find this:

29
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,200
Jake Paul: First I wanna apologize to my brother for the diss track.

30
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,900
I in no way meant to like hurt his feelings

31
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,000
So yeah, Jake owned up to his mistakes and he made an apology video

32
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
Which I think was the right thing to do,

33
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,200
However unfortunately like we already shot the music video

34
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
You already got your chance to talk sh*t

35
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,400
And I have not yet. Unfortunately Jakey, that's not how life works bro

36
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,900
And I know um my parents, they were here last night, this is what the issue was I was talking about in yesterday's vlog

37
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,700
They heard the song and they found out what was in it

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,720
And they told him, they texted him the night before and said

39
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
"Yo like this is what Logan's planning to drop"

40
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,160
And so he was able to record a new part of his vlog this morning

41
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,180
and be like

42
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,480
"I'm sorry, I'm the victim of the situation everyone just please forget that I said those things :( "

43
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,680
Well I-I didn't forget Jake and the Logang didn't forget

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,900
Like bro insult me but PLEASE don't insult my family

45
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,500
And PLEASE don't get into my personal life and personal business stuff bro

46
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,100
That's where you messed up bro

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,700
You don't mess with the Logang. I sai- it's a lyric in the song

48
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't f*ck with the Logang

49
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,340
Anyways, I'm gonna shower and get the day started *pause* okay

50
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,300
TWELVE SECONDS LATER!!!

51
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,260
Still doing my own voice-overs... Okay *Wpshh*

52
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,260
You guys, I am SO mad. Like *grrrrrr* I'M PISSED

53
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,060
Alright, so the apology video is really really getting to me

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,700
Like I said, Jake's whole thing like *wpshhh* *sigh*

55
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,860
He punched me in the face with a-a diss track

56
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,860
STRAIGHT UP SAYING THE LOGANG SUCKS!

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,200
And then before I even have a chance to get up and hit back, he says "I'm sorry" while I'm on the ground?!?

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,700
In real life if that happens I still get up and punch you in the face back

59
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,760
But the issue is that my uh the disstrack which I don't even know if it's out yet at this point

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,740
Like, cuz I'm debating to put it out

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,140
I go so hard, cause I felt insulted.

62
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,300
And publicly humiliated.

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,180
I have not gotten to get that creative, uh, lyrically.

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,560
In my uh, forever, my whole life! I-I've never that had much fun writing song lyrics.

65
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,460
Cuz it was real.

66
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,520
It hurt my feelings.

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,240
So I don't know what to do guys,

68
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,220
Like this is like

69
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm more Pissed I think now

70
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,100
Then I was when I watched the Actual Roast Video of us

71
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,940
You may have even seen all this information already in Yesterday's Vlog

72
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,160
This is what today's Vlog is gonna begin with

73
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,360
Because the first half like f*cked him up

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,180
and the middle f*cked him up

75
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,020
and in the end it's like "That's a Wrap".

76
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,040
It's like "GO BACK TO OHIO".

77
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,540
You can't just

78
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,640
take an action

79
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,120
and not expect repercussions.

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
LOGANG that's advice for you guys too like

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,040
there are going to be repercussions for your actions.

82
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,820
So think, think before you do stuff

83
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
I think that's where my age comes in

84
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,400
Im 22 Jakes 20

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,900
And he doesnt-think

86
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,900
now like umm

87
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
*Pause* This is rough

88
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,740
Hey good morning though guys...

89
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,740
... How you doing? *Giggle*

90
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Yaa Yeet Yo... I almost just ran into a pole... Ya Yeet

91
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,240
going to eat some breakfast with mah boi.

92
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,740
Gotta walk backwards

93
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
because when I walk this way

94
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,740
the wind blows the hair out my face...

95
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,740
Honestly I was walking backwards

96
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
Because when I walk this way the wind blows my hair up and it reveals my receding hairline...

97
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,840
Oh my gosh you guys know when you're hungry

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,740

still ruffle some feathers and stick up for our family

106
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
