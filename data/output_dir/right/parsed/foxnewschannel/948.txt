>> Martha: BREAKING TONIGHT, A
BATTLE ROYALE DESCRIBED BY ONE
PARTICIPANT AS A SCREAMING MATCH
AT TIMES IN THESE MEETINGS
BETWEEN DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
ROD ROSENSTEIN AND MEMBERS OF
THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE.
FOX NEWS HAS OBTAINED EMAILS
SHOWING HOUSE STAFFERS AT ONE
SPECIFIC MEETING WERE LEFT
FEELING CHILLED BY DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROB ROSENSTEIN
AFTER HIS APPARENT ANGRY TIRADE
OVER QUESTIONS THAT THEY WERE
ASKING ABOUT THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION AND DOCUMENTS THAT
THEY WANTED.
HOW SOURCES SAY THAT HE EVEN
THREATENED TO SUBPOENA THEIR
CALLS AND EMAILS.
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS
SLAMMING THOSE ACTIONS.
>> THE HEAD OF THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT ROB ROSENSTEIN WAS
THREATENING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE FOR DOING
THEIR JOB?
>> YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS OFF
THE RAILS, YOU ARE CLEARLY NOT
LIVING IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE I'M LOOKING AT.
>> Martha: CRITICS SAY THIS IS
ALL THE TACTICS OF THE CHAIRMAN
DEVIN NUNES.
>> I KNOW THE REPUTATION OF
DEVIN NUNES, THAT IS ONE OF
MISLEADING, OBSTRUCTING,
ATTEMPTING TO INTERVENE IN AN
INVESTIGATION.
THE PRESIDENT'S ALLIES IN THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
STARTING WITH DEVIN NUNES ARE
DOING THE PRESIDENT'S BIDDING.
>> Martha: CONGRESSMAN PETER
KING SITS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT
IS AT THE CENTER OF THIS AND HE
JOINS ME NOW.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
WITH US.
THESE MEETINGS HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED AS CONTENTIOUS OFTEN,
NOT JUST IN THIS ONE INSTANCE.
IS THIS A HEATED ROOM MUCH OF
THE TIME?
>> GENERALLY THE ONLY PERSON ON
THE COMMITTEE WHO MEETS WITH
ROSENSTEIN'S DEVIN NUNES AND
SOMETIMES TREY GOWDY.
BUT DEVON ALWAYS REPORTS BACK TO
US, THE STAFF PEOPLE DO IN THE
ACCOUNT THAT THEY GAVE THAT WHEN
THEY WERE TRYING TO GET
INFORMATION, WHICH WE ARE
ENTITLED TO, BY THE WAY, IT WAS
CONGRESS THAT CREATED THE
PROBLEM
THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THE
INFORMATION AND FOR WHATEVER
REASON ROSENSTEIN REFUSED TO DO
IT.
AFTER ONE OF THESE MEETINGS IN
PARTICULAR IT GOT VERY HEATED
AND HE BASICALLY THREATENED
STAFF, THREATENING TO SUBPOENA
THEIR EMAILS, THEIR TEXT
MESSAGES, THEIR PHONE LOGS.
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH T
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A
SHIRLEY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH L
WHAT WE ARE ASKING FOR
LEGITIMATE INFORMATION.
AN ABUSE OF POWER AND IT MAKES
YOU WONDER WHAT ARE THEY TRYING
TO HIDE?
>> Martha: ANDY McCARTHY
WROTE IT PIECE IN THE NATIONAL
REVIEW ABOUT THIS AND SAID THE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS
INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT HAS USED THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT'S AWESOME
INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITIES AS A
WEAPON AGAINST A POLITICAL
ADVERSARY AND HE SAYS THAT THIS
TELLS HIM THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING
IS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
IS THREATENING TO USE THEIR
AWESOME INVESTIGATIVE
AUTHORITIES AS A WEAPON AGAINST
POLITICAL ADVERSARIES.
IS THAT HOW YOU SEE IT?
>> UNWITTINGLY THEY ARE PROVING
OUR POINT THAT THEY DO ABUSE
THEIR POWER AND HAVE GONE WAY
BEYOND THEIR LANE.
I WOULD SAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO
POINT OUT THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN, I
HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HIM
PERSONALLY.
I THINK HE HAS ACTED VERY WRONG
HERE.
HE IS THE ONE WHO SIGNED THE
FOURTH FISA APPLICATION.
HE'S THE ONE WHO SIGNED ONTO
THAT AND THERE ARE REAL
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WAS
CONTAINED IN THAT APPLICATION.
SO IN A WAY HE WAS ALSO BEING
INVESTIGATED HIMSELF.
I THINK HE SHOULD BE RECUSING
HIMSELF FROM THIS ENTIRE MATTER,
BUT IN ANY EVENT, HE HAS A
DOUBLE MOTIVE HERE.
NOT ONLY IS HE SOMEHOW DIGGING
IN TO PROTECT THE INSTITUTION
AGAINST CONGRESS, BUT HE ALSO
APPLICATION WHICH HE SIGNED ONTO
AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE
IRREGULARITIES IN THAT
APPLICATION.
>> Martha: HOW DO YOU SEE THIS
ALL BEING RESOLVED?
>> I THINK ULTIMATELY THE
PRESIDENT MAY HAVE TO COME IN
HERE.
>> Martha: AND DO WHAT?
>> BASICALLY ORDER THEM.
HE DOES CONTROL THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.
IT CAN GIVE THEM VERY LEGITIMATE
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OV
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OR
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OT
ORDERS, KAREN       TURN THIS OO
CONGRESS, DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO
DO.
IF IT DOES HAVE TO GO TO THE
HOUSE, IF THERE IS A CENSURE
VOTE, WHICH I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO, BUT IF WE HAVE TO DO IT,
WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE HAVE TO.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
WHAT WAS THE BASIS OF THIS
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THE
PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN, WHO WAS
INVOLVED IN IT, OR THEIR
INFORMANTS, HOW MANY, WHERE THEY
PAID, WHY DID THEY GET INVOLVED,
HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT AT THE
START OF THIS INVESTIGATION, OR
DID IT COME AFTER THE
INVESTIGATION STARTED?
THESE SHOULD BE SIMPLE
QUESTIONS, SIMPLE ANSWERS AND WE
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS FOR
MONTHS NOW.
>> Martha: BEFORE I LET YOU
GO, AS A NEW YORKER I WANT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE
COURT HERE IN NEW YORK AND
MICHAEL: , WHO USED TO BE AN
ATTORNEY FOR THE PRESIDENT.
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS HAD A
DIVIDE WITH HIS ATTORNEY AND
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION
THAT HE MAY BE ABOUT TO FLIP ON
THE PRESIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?
>> I WOULD SAY NO.
AS FAR AS FLIPPING, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE INFORMATION TO GIVE AND AS
FAR AS I KNOW, FROM EVERYTHING
I'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE
INVESTIGATION THERE IS NOTHING
THAT MICHAEL COHEN WOULD HAVE ON
THE PRESIDENT AND ALSO I DON'T
THINK IS THE TYPE OF PERSON TO
MAKE SOMETHING UP FOR THE
PURPOSE OF GETTING HIMSELF OFF
AND SO FAR I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY
REAL EVIDENCE AGAINST MICHAEL
COHEN UNLESS THEY GO AFTER
EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING OVER THE
YEARS.
I THINK RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED, JUST MORE RUMORS
COMING OUT.
>> Martha: 3.7 MILLION
DOCUMENTS THEY ARE TRYING TO GET
THROUGH BY FRIDAY AND NOW HE HAS
APPARENTLY SEPARATED FROM HIS
