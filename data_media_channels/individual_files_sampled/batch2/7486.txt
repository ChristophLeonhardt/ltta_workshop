Michael Wolff spokes coming out Steve banning on loads on Donald Trump in his inner circle mainly his inner circle but also Trump and and the guys he can't stand the most or what he calls Jovanka so Ivanka and Jared Kushner so Kissinger is quoted in the book as saying the war within the white house was the Jews versus the non-jews who that doesn't sound good right no so Kushner is Jewish and Ivanka Donald Trump's daughter obviously converted to Judaism so I don't know if that has anything to do with it it's just a side note okay but but certainly they did not like each other that's the important part now we told you an overall coverage of the story that Bannon had said this is all about money laundering Muller chose Andrew Weissman a senior prosecutor first and he's a money-laundering guy there's their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort Don jr. and Jared Kushner so now again we told you on this show for about a year that it's the money laundering stupid that's that's the real heart of this issue now as chief strategist confirms that okay now let's go to cushion it's really important bana says it goes through deutsche bank and all the Kushner shit the cushion er shit is greasy they're going to go right through that they're going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me okay so when they do that there might be yet another shocking thing that happens which is Jared Kushner flipping on Trump now that seems unthinkable Jesus son-in-law he's married to Ivanka but remember Jovanka actually cares a little bit about self-respect and respectability and the mainstream and they're always tiptoeing around the issues and trying to distance themselves a little bit Charlottesville was bad and this and that and but it wasn't they care about women right wasn't Lee right but to their credit like yeah they're they're not quite as monstrous as Trump in in some of those things it's a good thing to criticize Charlottesville right what happened Charlotte so but Kushner is gonna want to save his own ass if Bannon is right and we are right and this is a category five and it is money laundering and we're not talking about hey that the Russians buy $46,000 and Facebook ads whatever we're talking about money laundering hundreds of millions of dollars for the Russians for decades okay if that's what this is about and everybody's going to jail could Kushner flip my answer is yes I don't perceive Jared Kushner as a guy who says loyalty above everything else if my Poppa is going to jail but I'll be in the cell next to him I see mr. guy who goes well anyways I gotta go so I might be right I might be wrong but look for Kushner flipping not now we're not there yet but if it gets deep enough and this is not resolved the straw that broke Trump's back could be Kushner it's also possible is based on nothing except the past people who have been indicted but in I believe in the case it seems like Flynn and deftly Papadopoulos like you have these people that indictments come out all of a sudden it's big news and everything but they had already been providing information and Muller for some time and so it's likely that if Jared was to flip one day or we were to find out about it he could have already been feeding information to Muller for a month or two at that point that seems to be how Muller is operating and one other thing about the guys who flip the reason mana Ford hasn't flipped is because he's totally and completely guilty and he's been guilty for decades so he's got nothing to flip I mean in the sense that he he's he's part of the conspiracy in in his such a gigantic way Kushner could say he's been doing that for all this time i man I got married into a family a couple of years ago I don't know anything about that man okay but I'll give you what I know and I'll do this and this and this might be hard since at that meeting yeah it also gives them information it gives him her at least he was at the meeting where they met with the Russian lawyer and discussed lifting the sanctions on the Russian oligarch which is the central part of the deal that it seems trumpet has struck with with the Russians at least according to Bannon according to all available evidence etc so if if his own son-in-law and his beloved Ivanka are the ones that do a man oh that is going to be rich and wonderful the only thing that would be better and I don't see how it could happen would be if it were Tiffany I have a tweet saved really go if Trump goes down it just says sad baby you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
