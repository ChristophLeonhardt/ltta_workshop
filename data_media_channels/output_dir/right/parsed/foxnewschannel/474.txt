RALLYING AHEAD OF THE MID-TERMS.
HERE TO REACT, DR. SEBASTIAN
GORKA, FORMER 2012 PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE
AMERICA FIGHTING BACKPACK.
HERMAN CAIN AND FORMER
INTELLIGENCE ANALYST MORGAN
ORTAGUS.
THIS IS ALL IN THE BACKDROP OF
THE KAVANAUGH SITUATION.
HE HAD A LITTLE FUN WITH DIANNE
FEINSTEIN.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUDIENCE
TOTALLY REMEMBERS THIS.
BUT DIANE WAS ASKED ABOUT
LEAKING THE DR. FORD LETTER TO
THE PRESS AND THE PRESIDENT HAD
A LITTLE FUN WITH THAT.
LET'S ROLL THE TAPE AND REACT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: WHEN YOU LOOK
AT RELEASES AND LEAKS, THEN THEY
SAY I DIDN'T DO IT.
I DIDN'T DO IT.
REMEMBER, DIANNE FEINSTEIN.
DID YOU LEAK?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: REMEMBER HER
ANSWER?
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT?
UH, UH, WHAT?
NO.
UH, NO.
I DIDN'T LEAK.
UH, WELL, WAIT, ONE MINUTE.
DID WE LEAK.
NO, NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.
JESSE: IT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT
IF YOUY.
THIS IS A #metoo SITUATION.
THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING THE
ALLEGED ACCUSER, THE FEMALE IS
CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING HER
INTEGRITY AND HER PEACE OF MIND.
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT HER NAME OUT
THERE, YET DIANNE FEINSTEIN OR
ONE OF HER COLLEAGUES OBVIOUSLY,
BECAUSE THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY OF
THE LETTER WAS ESTABLISHED.
LEAKED HER NAME TO EVERYBODY,
AND THIS HOISTED THIS WOMAN WHO
DIDN'T WANT TO GO PUBLIC INTO
THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AND
TORTURED HER IN FRONT AFTER LIVE
TV AUDIENCE.
THAT WAS A PRETTY INTENSE ATTACK
ON DIANNE.
THAT HANDED HARD.
>> IT WAS WELL DESERVED.
IT WAS EITHER FEINSTEIN, THE
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF OR THE
LAWYERS.
THEY DID A HUGE DISSERVICE TO
HER.
EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THIS
FBI INVESTIGATION HOW IT NEED
MORE TIME NOW.
ALL OF THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED
WITH CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER A
PRESENT THIS WHICH THIS POOR
WOMAN DIDN'T HAVE TO BE PRAYED
IN FRONT OF MILLIONS AND
BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE
WORLD.
THE ATTACK WAS TROUGH.
BUT I THINK IT WAS DESERVED.
I'M SURPRISED THAT DURING THE
COMMITTEE HEARING FEINSTEIN
DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER RESPONSE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.
JESSE: IT DIDN'T LOOK GOOD.
HE ALSO TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO
GO AFTER A 2020 CONTENDER CORY
BOOKER WHO REMEMBER HAD THIS BIG
SPARTACUS MOMENT WHERE HE
THUMPED HIMSELF ON THE CHEST AND
WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF.
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THAT.
LET'S LISTEN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP: HOW ABOUT CORY
BOOKER.
DID YOU WATCH THE PERFORMANCE?
HE RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY INTO
THE GROUND.
AND NOW HE WANTS TO BE
PRESIDENT, RIGHT?
WHAT WAS THE MOMENT HE SAID HE
HAD?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I THINK WE TAKE KIRK DOUGLAS IN
HIS PRIME.
DR. GORKA, WHAT DID YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?
>> HE WAS ON FORM.
HE KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.
WHEN HE GETS OFF HIS
TELEPROMPTER IT'S AMAZING.
BUT TO THE SERIOUS SIDE OF THIS,
THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THIS
THURSDAY.
A MAN WHO HAS A SPOTLESS, WHITE,
COMPLETELY CLEAN RECORD FOR 50
YEARS, WITHIN 11 DAYS GOES TO
BEING AN UPSTANDING GODLY MAN TO
BE ACCUSED OF POTENTIAL GANG
RAPE AND ATTEMPTED MURDER.
AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUT HIP
IN THE SPOTLIGHT ARE A WOMAN,
FEINSTEIN, WHO FOR 20 YEARS HAD
A CHINESE SPY ON HER PAYROLL
WHEN SHE WAS ON THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE.
CORY BOOKER WHO ADMITTED ON THE
RECORD TO GROPING HIGH SCHOOL
TEENAGER.
AND A MAN CALLED DICK BLUMENTHAL
WHO LECTURES THE FEDERAL JUDGE
ON LYING AND TELLING THE TRUTH
WHEN HE REPEATEDLY LIED ABOUT
BEING A COMBAT VETERAN IN
VIETNAM.
THIS IS POLITICS IN 2018 AND IT
SHOULD DISGUST ALL AMERICANS.
IF YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA,
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
ANGRY WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP,
AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
VOTE FOR TRUMP AND THE
REPUBLICAN TICKET.
JESSE: THE WOMEN I HAVE SPOKEN
TO RECENTLY ARE REALLY AGHAST AT
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.
THEY CAN SEE IT CAN BE UNFAIR ON
THE OTHER SIDE.
YOU HAVE SEEN HOAXES, AND I'M
NOT SAYING FORD IS A HOAX
ARTIST, BUT BY THE WAY THE
POLITICAL MACHINE WORKED WHEN
FEINSTEIN TAPPED FORD'S LAWYER
AND SAID GO TO KATZ, THIS WOMAN
WHO IS A SOCIALIST, A MEMBER OF
THE RESISTANCE.
IT WAS TOO CO-INCIDENTAL, HERMAN
CAIN.
TO THINK A MAN WITH UP A STELLAR
REP CASE CAN COME UP IN FRONT OF
PEOPLE WITH LESS THAN STELLAR
REPUTATIONS AND HAVE HIS
INTEGRITY QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.
OBVIOUSLY HE'S INCREDIBLY ANGRY
AND UPSET AND IMPASSIONED.
NOW THE LEFT IS SAYING HE'S TOO
UPSET AND ANGRY AND IMPASSIONED
TO BE A BALANCED AND IMPARTIAL
JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO VOTE
FOR HIM, AND THIS IS ALL A BIG
STUNT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.
AS WE WOULD SAY IN THE BAPTIST
CHURCH TO DR. GORKA'S ASK
COMMENT AND THE OTHER COMMENTS
ABOUT THE LAID YESTERDAY, AMEN,
AMEN, AMEN.
NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO -- I JUST WANTED THEM
TO KNOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE
THEIR COMMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON.
NOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN JUDGE
KAVANAUGH AND TRIED TO DO WHAT
THEY CALL POLITICAL CHARACTER
ASSASSINATION AND AS DR. GORKA
SAID, I BELIEVE IT MANY
BACKFIRING.
I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.
I SEE PEOPLE.
THEY ARE ASKING ME BY THE.
EVERYBODY WHO APPROACHES ME
ABOUT WHAT WENT ON LAST WEEK
WHILE THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY
WERE HELD HOSTAGE FOR 12 DAYS,
12 DAYS THEY WERE HELD HOSTAGE.
THEY DESCRIBED THIS IN ONE WORD,
