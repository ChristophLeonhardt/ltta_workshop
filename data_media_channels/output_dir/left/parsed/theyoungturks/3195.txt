>>DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN FEUDING
WITH A WELL-KNOWN FATHER IN THE
BASKETBALL WORLD, LAVAR BALL.
HE
HAS SONS WHO ARE PLAYING COLLEGE
BASKETBALL AT THE MOMENT, AND
ONE OF HIS SONS WAS ARRESTED IN
CHINA FOR TRAVELING.
TRUMP
CLAIMS THAT HE MANAGED TO GET
LAVAR BALL'S SON, ALONG WITH TWO
OTHER PLAYERS, BACK TO THE
UNITED STATES AFTER THEY WERE
DETAINED IN CHINA, AND TRUMP
WANTED A THANK YOU.
LAVAR BALL
HAS REFUSED TO THANK HIM AND
IT'S THE MOST NONSENSICAL FEUD
EVER, BUT SOMETHING HAS COME OUT
OF THIS THAT I THOUGHT WAS
INTERESTING.
TRUMP SUPPORTERS
ARE UPSET THAT LAVAR BALL
REFUSES TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
TRUMP SO THEY ARE TAKING TO
TWITTER TO ATTACK LAVAR BALL,
EXCEPT THEY ARE MISTAKING LEVAR
BURTON FOR LAVAR BALL.
LEVAR
BURTON IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON, YOU MIGHT WERE NUMBER
HIM AS THE HOST OF READING
RAINBOW, THAT'S HOWEVER A MEMO
HIM FOR MY CHILDHOOD.
>>THAT DOES SEEM PRETTY
OFFENSIVE.
>>HE'S A DELIGHTFUL PERSON.
>>I OF COURSE ARE MEMBER HIM
FROM STAR TREK: THE NEXT
GENERATION.
>>THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT,
BUT READING RAINBOW I REMEMBER.
TAKE A LOOK, IT'S IN A BOOK.
THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT SHOW.
>>STAR TREK HAD OKAY GRAPHICS
BACK THEN, BUT THEY JUST TOOK
LIKE A HAIR THING THAT YOU PUT
TOGETHER, AND MADE IT HIS
EYEPIECE.
>>DID THEY REALLY?
>>YES, HE'S BLIND BUT HE CAN
SEE BECAUSE OF THE HAIRPIECE ON
HIS HEAD.
GEORDI LAFORGE, ON
DECK.
SO HILARITY ENSUES.
>>ONE PERSON SAYS YOU ARE A
HAS-BEEN ACTOR WITH A HAS-BEEN
FOR A SON AND TRUMP IS THE
PRESIDENT, GET THE PICTURE?
>>I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE GOT THE
PICTURE, MARK.
>>ANOTHER PERSON WRITES WASHED
UP ACTOR, CHECK.
SON CAUGHT
STEALING IN CHINA, CHECK.
TRUMP
STILL PRESIDENT, CHECK.
BUT NONE
OF THAT IS TRUE, HUH?
LOL.
>>ONE OF THEM IS NOT TRUE.
ACTUALLY TWO OF THEM ARE NOT
TRUE.
>>THERE IS SOME PORTION OF
TRUMP'S BASE THAT, LIKE, THEY
DON'T CARE WHAT TRUMP DOES.
THEY
LOVE THAT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT SO
THEY CAN SAY TRUMP IS PRESIDENT.
THEY GET OFF ON THAT.
>>OUR PROBLEM IS WE DON'T THINK
LIKE THE RIGHT WING.
IF WE DID,
THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS WOULD BE
LIKE, OBAMA IS PRESIDENT, WHAT
NOW?
WHICH YOU ALMOST NEVER SAW
ANYONE DO.
WHAT HAPPENED TO MITT
ROMNEY?
IT'S IN THE PAST, WE ARE
DONE WITH IT.
BUT IT'S THE ONLY
THING THEY HAVE TO CLING ONTO.
THE LAST ONE I THINK IS THE
WORST, BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ONTO
THAT ONE, A SIMILAR THING
HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY WHERE A
GUY ON TWITTER SAID ANA AND CENK
DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT
FINANCE.
THESE DUMBASSES
WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SPELL
DERIVATIVES.
AND HE SPELLED
DERIVATIVES WRONG.
WHICH IS JUST
AWESOME, IT'S TWITTER 101.
THIS
GUY IS LIKE OH YEAH, I GOT MY
FACTS RIGHT, YOU HAVE A THIEF
FOR A SON.
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR FACTS RIGHT.
JUST BUY A
CLUE BEFORE YOU GO ON TWITTER,
THAT'S ALL.
>>I HATE TWITTER.
I FEEL LIKE
TWITTER IS JUST LIKE ONE BIG
EXAMPLE FOR WHY YOU SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP ON HUMANS.
IT'S LIKE A
COLLECTION OF THE WORST PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET ALL IN ONE PLACE.
AND YOU WILL GET SPRINKLES OF
INTERESTING SMART PEOPLE WHO
HAVE FUNNY THINGS TO SAY, BUT
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE LIKE, I
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY LIFE
SO I'M GOING TO PHOTOSHOP STUPID
SHIT ALL DAY.
>>I HEAR YOU.
IT'S LIKE THE
INTERNET IN A LOT OF WAYS, THE
BEST AND WORST OF US.
THERE ARE
FUNNY THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON
TWITTER, SMART COMMENTS, AND YOU
CAN STAY CONNECTED WITH PEOPLE
YOU CARE ABOUT.
BUT YES,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LIKE US
AND YOU LIVE ON THE INTERNET AND
YOU HAVE A LOT OF HATERS ON THE
INTERNET -- EVERYONE THINKS I'M
ON TWITTER ALL THE TIME BECAUSE
THEY ARE ON TWITTER ALL THE
TIME, BUT I JUST GO IN AND OPEN
THE DOOR ONCE IN A WHILE --
>>I CRACK IT OPEN LITTLE BIT.
>>THEY THINK I'M IN THE ROOM AND
I'M NOT IN THE ROOM, AND MOST OF
THE TIMES I NOW OPEN THE DOOR
AND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF LUNATICS
SCREAMING IN THE ROOM --
>>IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S ACTUALLY
FLATTERING.
LIKE, IF YOU CAN GET
PAST THE JUVENILE INSULTS OR
WHATEVER, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO
ARE HAVING NONSTOP CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT YOU WHILE YOU ARE OUT
THERE LIVING YOUR LIFE.
IT'S
KIND OF FLATTERING.
>>AND ALSO KIND OF FRIGHTENING.
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE
DOOR AND YOU SEE PEOPLE GNAWING
AT EACH OTHER'S BONES AND THINGS
LIKE THAT, IT'S MADNESS.
>>STEVEN WRITES YOU SURE DON'T
DO MUCH FOR THE BLACK CAUSE
WITH YOUR UNLAWFUL, UNGRATEFUL
PARENTING SKILLS.
>>THEY HAD TO MAKE IT RACIAL.
IT'S NOT JUST THAT LAVAR BALL,
THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO WAS
"UNGRATEFUL" TO TRUMP, IT'S NOT
THAT TRUMP DID A GOOD THING,
IT'S THAT YOU ARE BLACK.
>>BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T FIND IT
A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC TO PRESSURE
PEOPLE TO THANK OTHERS?
LIKE,
WHY AREN'T YOU THANKING THE
PRESIDENT?
THANK THE PRESIDENT!
WHAT?
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT
HAPPENED IN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION?
FIRST OF ALL,
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA EVER
EVEN TOOK CREDIT FOR SOMETHING?
HE WOULDN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR
ANYTHING.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF HE
WAS AS BOASTFUL, OR EVEN A
FRACTION AS BOASTFUL, AS TRUMP
IS?
THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR MINDS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA WENT TO
A SMALL TOWN IN THE SOUTH WHERE
JOBS INCREASED A LITTLE BIT AND
HE WAS LIKE, YOU GUYS SHOULD ALL
THANK ME, HOW COME YOU AREN'T
THANKING ME?
COME ON.
PLEASE,
FOR A SECOND, THINK ABOUT THE
SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT.
THIS IS
ABSURD BEHAVIOR BY ANY
PRESIDENT, DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
IDEOLOGY OR YOUR POLITICAL
PARTY, YOU SHOULDN'T BE WASTING
YOUR TIME DEMANDING A THANK YOU
FROM LAVAR BALL.
>>LAST TWO THINGS ON THIS.
LAVAR
BALL AND TRUMP HAD A CLOWN-OFF,
THEY GOT INTO A CIRCUS, WHO IS
GOING TO BE THE BIGGER CLOWN.
IF
I'M LAVAR BALL I'M SUPER HEAVY
MY KID IS BACK, I'LL BE DONE
WITH IT.
HE WAS THE SPOTLIGHT,
HE IS TRUMPIAN IN THAT SENSE.
BUT TRUMP, YOU ARE THE
PRESIDENT.
FOR YOU TO BE LIKE, I
WISH I HADN'T GOTTEN THEM OUT,
NANNY NANNY BOO BOO, YOU ARE
SUCH A CHILD.
AND ABOUT HIS
SUPPORTERS, IF I WENT AROUND
SAYING WHY HAVEN'T YOU THANKED
OBAMA FOR THIS OR THAT?
WHAT A
SAD, SYCOPHANTIC EXISTENCE.
OBAMA IS THE BEST, WHY HAVEN'T
YOU THANKED HIM, HE'S THE
GREATEST?
YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.
THE ALPHA MALE IS SO GREAT, I
LOVE HIM.
>>HERE IS ANOTHER IRONIC PART,
IT'S LIKE, WE ARE THE PARTY OF
SMALL GOVERNMENT, WE DON'T WANT
THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE TO MUCH
POWER.
AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY,
YOU HAVE TO THANK THE PRESIDENT!
>>BOW YOUR HEAD TO THE
GOVERNMENT.
WE AREN'T GOING TO
BOW OUR HEAD TO THE LEADER OF
YOUR GOVERNMENT, WE ARE NOT
BETAS LIKE YOU.
