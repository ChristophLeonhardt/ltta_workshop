early this morning Donald Trump was involved in a good thing that he turned into a really weird thing depending on your view maybe a bad thing and a kind of reality show Trump was greeting three American hostages freed from North Korea and then said this I think you probably broke the all-time and history television rating for three o'clock in the morning that I would say come on we call that not sticking the landing Donald Trump's standing next to three people who literally let's be real about what they were going through literally didn't know if they'd ever get home again and if they would live through their ordeal and he turned it immediately to TV ratings and this is of course as everyone has said a reality TV presidency and ratings appear to be part of how he measures his job I was on 60 minutes the other night and they got the highest ratings they've had in a long time I do get good ratings you have to admit that I love ratings I get so good I mean these other candidates why do you always talk about reddy's because I'm number one for this special discussion I want to turn now to a media innovator and self-described member of the resistance Michael Hirshhorn he created the concept of see out celebrity reality TV while an executive at vh1 and created hits such as Flavor of Love I love the 80s and Celebrity Rehab he also writes for The Atlantic who knew that your Venn diagram of experience would be so crucial what do you see Donald Trump doing and thinking there as a leader and as a wannabe reality TV character so so in my old vh1 days they would have called him a thirsty bi TCH Wow just a little bit trihard and I think a really smart producer would not actually describe what he's doing he would just accept the ratings and move on so I find there's a little slippage in Trump's reality slippage slippage in his reality to masks is dropping and he's speaking as he would backstage about the ratings instead of actually doing the thing that is supposed to deliver the right it's it's the classic Trump administration malevolence tempered by incompetence mm-hmm so that we hope will save us when you see that and you say that he's thirsty should a president be thirsty well I think I think his thirstiness and his reality TV approach to presidenting could have really significant real-world implications right I think he's potentially undermining his position a visa via North Korea he's undermined his position visa via the entire world by pulling out of the Iran deal so we're heading to the point now finally where these types of theatrics are starting to really have a significant impact and it goes to the mentality here's Randall Pinkett who was an apprentice winner on how Trump looks at the world on a daily basis he had this stack of magazines and newspapers on his desk each of them had a post-it note I see that each of the post-it notes was placed in the magazine or newspaper into an article about Donald that Donald was basically reading about himself do human beings who end up in reality shows sometimes actually lose their grasp on where the show ends often I mean there's nothing more tragic than a former reality star I think he did pretty well becoming president but it does still doesn't mean that the story could end very badly and I think one of the key things about reality talent that we've worked with is that they often really lose sight of the distinction between reality and fantasy so it may not be that he's in fact getting one over on the public he may have gotten one over on himself and not really fully understand what's happening around him it's just pure all-enveloping narcissism is it possible that he has the wrong definition of the job so he's measuring it by the old job it's like a candidate sometimes only looks at polls and you want to say if you're in the office it's not about polls anymore about the work and the public interest and maybe what the history books will say with what they did a good job well he either is gonna get swallowed by that or he's gonna change the rulebook right right so it's entirely possible that he is understood something about the popular psyche that the rest of didn't believe it was possible michael Hirshhorn a deep thinker who's never thirsty thank you for being here hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
