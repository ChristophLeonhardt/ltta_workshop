we have a big difference on issues you see last year in the primary he expressed his passion he said I am a strong liberal Democrat August 87 then he said I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU that was what he said he is out there on out of the mainstream well remember that was then Republican presidential nominee George HW Bush criticizing his Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for being a quote card-carrying member of the ACLU card-carrying a phrase that echoed kind of nation of card-carrying members of the Communist Party during the McCarthy era of course we all remember it well today our current Republican administration led by the president is asking the ACLU of the American Civil Liberties Union to do the government's job for them in a court filing yesterday the US Justice Department argued that the ACLU the same organization that Bush once attacked is to use its quote considerable resources and their network of law firms NGOs and volunteers to help reunify parents separated from their children at the border the ACLU which is representing migrant families pushed back in a statement noting the government appears to be taking the remarkable position that it is the job of private entities to find these parents and pointing out that it was the government's unconstitutional separation practice that led to this crisis in the first place well late this afternoon the judge in this case overseeing the case rejected the administration's proposal and said that reuniting the families was 100% the responsibility of the administration according to NBC News out of the two thousand five hundred and fifty children who were separated from their parents after crossing the border more than 570 about one-fifth are still in government custody well I'm joined now by NBC News correspondent Jacob so bro Jacob you're on top of this you're there tell us about it the ACLU I have to tell you having lived through that campaign back in 88 when basically George Herbert Walker Bush accused the Congress of being some sort of hopeless lefty because he dared to associate with the ACLU which a lot of people on both sides the I do respect that an organization going to help people who aren't too popular and that's the people that need help when I get on a legal system but your thoughts about this new reliance of the Trump crowd on the ACLU it is a bizarro bizarro world Chris and to watch that clip you know it just you think about it the Trump administration wants to put the ACLU at the center of this not because they want to be buddies with the ACLU but frankly because they have absolutely no plan to put these kids back with their parents we're talking about the administration that separated two thousand five hundred and fifty one kids from their parents down at the border in the systematic way that had never been done before I was on with you from down there you know I saw those kids in the cages and you know I will never see anything like that again and I don't think many of us in our lifetime will see anything like that again and now the administration is saying you know what we separated them but we don't really know how to put them back together so the organization that is suing us will just suggest hey why don't you guys do it and we'll we'll be the supporting player and the judge said absolutely not well I hear we got a pretty good nine on the kids who are here who are separated from the parents who are in American foster homes or anywhere else where but we have no line on those who went but were sent back deported back to their countries of origin and the question is how would the ACLU be able to find those people down there any better than the US government says embassies consulates you know put ematic people all over those countries and spies we got everything down there knows countries they would seem to be better equipped than the ACLU based here to find those parents but and and by the way Chris those are the vast majority of the kids that still aren't reunited with their parents there's 572 that still aren't reunited 410 of them those parents were deported out of the country before they had a chance to be reunited with the parents so the judge said today once you guys appoint somebody government one person to run this whole operation near the United States government and this is the judge suggesting it how about somebody just a department how about somebody from Health and Human Services maybe you guys team up the both of you to come up with a plan actually to go to the console it's like you said Chris it's not like it's you know it's complicated it is a no-brainer these people are gonna go to the consulate say my children are still in the United States I want to get back together with them the rules are I can't come back to the United States so figure out how to get my child who's literally in the custody of the US government sitting in the country back to me here it is a no-brainer but the government assured its responsibility at least in that proposal and the judge the judge just ripped right into them and said this is not acceptable this is unacceptable you know in the old days the government's the United States the United States like Roosevelt's would find some business leaders someone who knew how to get things done it could be Bernard Baruch or somebody like that or and they'd find one of the side Lee Iacocca type say you're pretty good at doing this of organization why don't you do this do something for your country for the next several months and get this job then why don't they do that why doesn't Trump find one of his smart business types who know how to get things done and and pick them for him or hurt for the job and say here's something you can do for your country the next few months and for mankind well let me ask this why didn't they put somebody like that in charge of the policy in the first place when they started separating these children so they knew where to find them at the end of the day when they decided they were gonna reunite them with their parents I guess that the answer is they never thought this through they still obviously haven't thought this through on the first part of the reunifications when they reunified about 1800 they had this commander that was normally in charge of natural disasters come in and reunify the first group of kids that were sort of the low-hanging fruit the ones that were easy to pair back up with their parents because they happen to still be here but now they're left searching again for this leader to figure out who can put all these kids back together hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
