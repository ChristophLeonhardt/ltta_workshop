the right-wing wants you to believe that it's leftists and Bernie supporters that are responsible for the divisive and extreme and even violent rhetoric that's driving us apart they tried to make that clear after the police shooting and this week it looked like they had a perfect example of it on the morning of June 16th Morley elementary school principal Ryan Cleary contacted police in West Hartford Connecticut after elementary students found quote swear words on their playground equipment responding officers found kill Trump left is the best Bernie Sanders 2020 and death to trump written on a sign in the playground oh my god case closed it says Bernie Sanders 2020 these goddamn Bernie bros are at it again and then they got even more evidence not just the signs they had a video footage showing the guy doing it which we're gonna show you right now so as you're gonna see here doesn't like look looks can be deceiving but he doesn't look like a hippie Bernie supporter so much but you never know you never know but don't worry we're gonna have his exact details for you guys on who he is but the cops when they saw a bald white man and Ed Sykes t-shirt they were like this is the Bernie bro maybe but let's look into it a little bit more so that video came out and a lot of people saw including that guy in the video who is uh Steven marks of West Hartford saw himself and turned himself in because he was rightly scared that he would eventually be caught cuz they don't have a very good look at him right there anybody in that community is gonna know who he is yeah uh and it turns out not such a Bernie bro he's actually a supporter of Donald Trump and he told investigators he quote had the dumb idea to vandalized the school with what would seem to be liberal hate speech making this a false flag operation and oddly enough the usual false flag people aren't really talking about it weird how that works out he went on to say that his crime was quote out of anger towards liberals and they're breaking major laws every day and being disrespectful towards our government they're even writing on signs and stuff okay so let's break this down because I this is beyond awesome so by the way they're all really fast these quotes two more quotes he says on the record I want to say I'm sorry it was a stupid decision I hope nobody wants to do the same because it's wrong that's good and then he says it was just a stupid thing I did at the time it was stupid stupid stupid oh my god I am totally totally totally totally totally sorry for that it reminds me of that character from Boogie Nights stupid why did that's not the only one we've been trying to track down with this from but yeah he did he did do that Philip Seymour Hoffman Seymour Hoffman there you go okay and that was not the audio was not him without okay so so let's break this down if I was the cops I would have immediately known that it was a false flag operation why okay kill Trump death the Trump Bernie Sanders 2020 like their birdie okay you're not gonna write Bernie 2020 you yeah okay first of all Bernie supporters on average are not the people who are looking to kill people I know that the dudes are watch your the what Judy remember the one Judy right okay but okay but it could be it could be I wouldn't investigation there okay then you're stupid enough to write Bernie Sanders 2020 next to kill Trump yeah it makes it a lot less like but the one that's I see it's the one that kills it and putting game completely left is the best progressive elementary school my left is the best elementary school right wingers take that okay no that's obviously a knucklehead right winger who thinks he's clever again to be fair there's been false flags on the left to there's the guy who like burned the black church and yet turns out he was going to that church and he wanted to blame it and they did the thing about Donald Trump or whatever so it doesn't happen on that yeah and we report on it happens from time to time didn't uncle heads on all sites and but but I love the irony of this guy statements and this is it is emblematic of the right he says he did it as quoted you out of anger towards liberals because their make breaking major laws every day but you broke the law and you've been now charged with criminal mischief and breach of the peace and so even as he is admitting he broke the law he goes what they did it I did it because they did it but what you have no graffiti you have no in fact you since they didn't do it you had to pretend they did it yeah if they had already done it you wouldn't have to go out there and pretend to do it exactly right so so it is great irony and projection and they're the lawbreakers yeah as he is admitting to a crime yes and making his dog his accomplice which is the worst part I know have you no shame and and and finally the second part of that quote he says they're being disrespectful towards our government I thought you guys were the ones who hated big government now all of a sudden you're charging liberals who with the great crime of being disrespectful to our government support independent media come
