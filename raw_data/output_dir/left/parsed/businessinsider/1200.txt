my do is you can sleep later
you don't ever look back on an event and
say man I really wish I had gotten those
two weren't those two hours of sleep
incredible but you could look back and
say I missed that ballgame or I missed
that meeting or I missed that get
together with family or friends and
that's always to me going to be more
important than sleep so on my relative
priorities list sleep ranks relatively
low you do need sleep to function and so
I get enough that you can function yes
what is that really it ranges from five
to eight hours depending on the day of
the week something like that
