00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
hi everyone to firstly after say thank

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,600
you for your lovely comments in my last

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,520
video my homesickness only lasted about

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 hours or so on a Saturday it just</font>

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,330
kind of came all at once and i think it

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,740
was inevitable because i am in a new

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,509
place if things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different my friends</font>

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">are starting to go back to university</font>

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,750
that was gonna come at any point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sort</font>

10
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,160
of accepted it today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually in</font>

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,869
quite a strange mood it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

12
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,750
kind of triggered in me and just finally

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,420
it so hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how we live</font>

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,220
with ourselves I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds very</font>

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,140
dramatic and I know it sounds like the

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,390
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few videos I've made make me seem</font>

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,759
like I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hugely depressed or</font>

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,590
something you know it's maybe I maybe

19
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,149
that's what's triggering a little bit

20
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,770
but maybe I'm actually just seeing

21
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,960
clearly for the first time and I don't

22
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">know whether that's direct without</font>

23
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,160
University of getting older oh just my

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,750
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being able to cope with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

25
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,789
direct contradictions in my life I

26
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,100
talked a lot about affluenza which I

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,809
read earlier this year and I think

28
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,340
that's a big problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would still</font>

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,320
say you haven't read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and please do</font>

30
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,940
give many ways it's shaped<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock the way</font>

31
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,410
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought this year and I look the</font>

32
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,270
way I look at a world around with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

33
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,129
yeah even when you read a book this that

34
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,349
hits you that powerfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go on living</font>

35
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,810
my life largely in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way I'm user</font>

36
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,240
in my mind which tries to make me<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

37
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,100
all these things I've learned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blind</font>

38
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,869
spot in your why there's a certain spot

39
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,970
where if you put two lines and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gap in</font>

40
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and you hold up at the right</font>

41
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">distance away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from your face and you</font>

42
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,770
find a blind spot then your mind will

43
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,659
just connect the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> Annie told me that</font>

44
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,830
so if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually true then</font>

45
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,270
blame her<font color="#CCCCCC"> she goes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cambridge she</font>

46
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,770
should know but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

47
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,960
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to keep him</font>

48
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,340
his mindset these other things are

49
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,900
distracting me and I'm finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> it very</font>

50
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,930
hard to keep hold of everything that I

51
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,729
want to do everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've thought</font>

52
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,020
about and everything that i read that

53
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,030
shocks me you disgust me and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

54
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't change you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just I feel</font>

55
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm losing grip of it and I feel</font>

56
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it would be very easy for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me right</font>

57
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,659
now to just put that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a corner</font>

58
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,579
somewhere and just go on with my life

59
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,740
and that is terrifying I read this book

60
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,530
yesterday by Charles W Mills called a

61
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,540
racial contract it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely a book</font>

62
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,759
for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at universities kind of got</font>

63
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,670
that style references to<font color="#CCCCCC"> university type</font>

64
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,619
things like deconstruction but it's very

65
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,360
readable I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend reading it</font>

66
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,799
especially if you've read any social

67
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
contract theory if you've done any

68
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,750
philosophy tool actually

69
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,979
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is another book that i read that</font>

70
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,050
terrified me actually racing the

71
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">enlightenment that's all about I</font>

72
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,800
realized the ideas of great western

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,410
thinkers like Canton Thomas Jefferson

74
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,450
everything work it's terrifying the kids

75
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,270
I spent years two years or so learning

76
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and not once did that kind of</font>

77
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,110
stuff come up and it wasn't like he had

78
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,820
a passing reference here that he

79
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,950
actively wrote about race it worries me

80
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,510
how much I feel like everything around

81
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,700
me has controlling me I worries me how

82
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,640
much I feel like I'm in 1984 and I'm

83
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,830
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be kind of reeducation i'm</font>

84
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,730
finding scary this morning and it's it

85
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,110
upsetting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to say from this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paper</font>

86
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will do everything in my power to</font>

87
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,350
help other people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will do</font>

88
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,660
everything to alleviate other people

89
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,310
suffering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will not be wasteful</font>

90
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will not spend money on all this</font>

91
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,660
crap that my life revolves around that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

92
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,430
won't endorse industries at the fashion

93
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,870
industry where people suffer every

94
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,400
single day that are only buy fair trade

95
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,770
products for clothes as well as for food

96
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,840
or locally solved that was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my new</font>

97
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,910
year's resolutions to only buy fair

98
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,650
trade craving and that fell through in

99
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,110
about two weeks it's disgusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

100
