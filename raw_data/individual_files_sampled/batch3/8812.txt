AND A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES WERE INVOLVED. HE ALSO SAID THIS DOES NOT ANY WAY IMPUGN THE INTEGRITY OF THE FBI AND ITS WORKFORCE, BRET. Bret: LET'S GET REACTION FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF TWO MAJOR HOUSE COMMITTEE IS LOOKING INTO ALL OF THIS. TREY GOWDY IS CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE AND BOB GOODLATTE CHAIRS THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN GAUDI, FIRST TO YOU. JUST OF BROAD OVERVIEW, WHAT STRIKES YOU ABOUT THIS REPORT? WHAT A DARK DAY IT IS FOR THE FBI AND DOJ, TWO INSTITUTIONS OF OUR COUNTRY DESPERATELY NEEDS AND WE DESPERATELY HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THEM. IN THIS LEVEL OF BIAS AND ANIMUS, NOT ONLY DID THEY WANT TO STOP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BUT HE WANTED TO STOP THE TRUMP PRESIDENT. PETER STRZOK, THE FBI AGENT THAT WAS ON ELDER CLINTON'S INVESTIGATION AND ARGUABLY AT THE LEAD RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR NOT ONLY WANTED TO STOP HIS CAMPAIGN, BUT ONCE HE WANTED, GOT ON THE MUELLER PRO BECAUSE HE WANTED TO IMPEACH HIM. THAT'S A LEVEL OF ANIMUS AND BIAS THAT EVERYONE SHOULD REJECT. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE THAT YOUR FELLOW CITIZENS QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD'S PREMIER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND THAT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS DEFENDING DEFENDED HAS DEFENDING DEFENDET HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEE HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEM HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEA HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEL HAS DEFENDING DEFENDET HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEI HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEN HAS DEFENDING DEFENDEH HAS DEFENDING DEFENDES CAREER. THIS WAS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTING REPORT. FIRST OF ALL, THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT THERE WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT GIVEN TO HILLARY CLINTON IN THE INVESTIGATION OF HER CASE. THERE IS NOT A STANDARD PROCEDURE FOLLOWED IN INVESTIGATING HER, AND THERE WAS SPECIAL TREATMENT GIVEN. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS WAS NOT A PROPER PROCESS AND OF THE REPORT SHOWS TIME AND TIME AGAIN HOW DIRECTOR COMEY AND OTHERS MADE MISTAKES, ERRORS IN JUDGMENT, OR DELIBERATE. PEOPLE CAN DRAW THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS. BUT IT WAS ON IMPROPERLY HANDLED. AND AS TREY SAID TO COME AND YOU CAN UP AGAINST OUT THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN HANDLED IN THE SO-CALLED TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION, AND YOU HAVE CONTRAST THAT IS SHOCKING IN TERMS OF HOW THEY HANDLED ONE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMPARED TO ANOTHER. IT'S GOT TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER, CHANGES HAVE TO BE MADE. I WILL COMPLEMENT DIRECTOR RAY ON SOME OF THE PERSONNEL CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, THERE ARE SOME SOBERING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS. WE NEED TO SEE CHANGES MADE SO THAT IN 2,020 WE DON'T SEE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HANDLED LIKE THIS. Bret: SO WHEN YOU HEAR REPUBLICANS AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THIS AND SAY, THIS 568 PAGES, THERE IS JUST NOT A LOT THEY ARE, OR THAT HOROWITZ LEFT SOMETHING ON THE TABLE, HOW DO YOU RESPOND? THIS IS A VERY THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. HE TAKES MINUTIA AND EXAMINES EACH PIECE CAREFULLY, DRAWS HIS CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND C CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND M CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND E CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND D CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND H CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND M CONCLUSIONS, AND I COMMAND . I THINK IT'S A WELL-DONE REPORT. I NEVER EXPECTED HIM TO FIND A RECYCLE THING AS SOME CRITICS HAVE SAID BUT HE DID FIND ALL WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE STRZOK PAGE TEXT, INCLUDING THIS NEW ONE THAT HAS COME OUT RECENTLY WHERE PART OF IT ROSE REDACTED, AND BY THE WAY WE ONLY GOT PART OF THE SENTENCE WHERE HE WAS GOING TO STOP DONALD TRUMP OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S IMPROPER FOR THE FBI. PRIMARILY THAT WAS THE PREMIER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND BESMIRCHING OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO KEEP US SAFE, PREVENT TERRORIST ATTACKS AND FIGHT CRIME EVERY SINGLE DAY. I HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN THE HIERARCHY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS DAMAGE. Bret: LET'S PUT UP THE AUGUST 8, 2016, WHICH IS THE ONE WHERE PAGE SAYS TRUMP IS NEVER GOING TO BE PRESIDENT, RIGHT? RIGHT. AND THAT PART WAS REDACTED. HERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT WE BELIEVE. NOVEMBER 22ND, 2016, FBI ATTORNEY ONE, ISN'T MAKING RETHINK YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? I THINK THAT'S A LISA PAGE. ATTORNEY TWO, NO, VIVA LA RESISTANCE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S PETER STRZOK. LET ME SAY THIS, JIM COMEY, IN HIS INTERVIEW HERE AT SPECIAL REPORT, I ASKED ABOUT THE STRZOK-PAGE TEXT. AND IF HE KNEW NOW WHAT HE KNEW THEN, WHAT HE WOULD DO. I WOULD HAVE REMOVED BOTH OF THEM FROM ANY CONTACT WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING ANYBODY CONNECTED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT BEYOND THAT. Bret: SO YOU'D RATHER THE WORK PRODUCT THEN BE QUESTIONED? SURE. Bret: THIS DEALS WITH THE BLEACH BIT AND OF THE SERVER, SHERYL MILLS AND THAT. INTERVIEWS MICHAEL FLYNN AND HIS INTRO: THIS ENTIRE CASE. BUT HE'S ONE OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ALL THE THINGS YOU TICKED OFF. WHEN I SAW THE TAX, I WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THEM BUT I NEVER SAW ANY BIAS. Bret: ANY BIAS. WHILE HE'S NOT READING THE SAME TEXTS THAT I AM READING. PETER STRZOK SAID THE VOTE SHOULD BE 100 MILLION TO ZERO. HE CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE SOLITARY AMERICAN THAT WOULD WANT DONALD TRUMP TO BE PRESIDENT. HE SAID HE WILL STOP IT. ACTUALLY, DIRECTOR COMEY UNWITTINGLY JUST PROVE THE POINT OF THE QUESTION YOU ASKED HIM ON FOLLOW-UP. WOULD YOU HAVE KEPT HIM ON INVESTIGATION HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW NOW? AND HE SAID NO. BECAUSE BIAS IS NOT INSIDIOUS, IT'S THAT PERVASIVE AND IT COLORS YOUR ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE NEED THE FBI TO DO, WHICH IS TO BE FAIR. SO OF COURSE, YOU WILL FIRE HIM THE DAY YOU LEARN. IN MY HEAD, I GO BACK. WHEN DID YOU START WORKING ON THE CASE? THAT'S WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED. SO WHATEVER HE DID ON EITHER OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, BRET, IT HAS TO BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM THAT HE CAN'T THINK OF A SINGLE SOLITARY PERSON THAT SHOULD VOTE FOR THIS MAN TO BE PRESIDENT. Bret: SO STRZOK'S ATTORNEY SAYS THIS WAS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT. DID THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE RUSSIA INFORMATION, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE REFERRING TO? DO YOU THINK THAT THIS CHANGES AT ALL IN CONTEXT, FOR IN A VACUUM, IT IS IT JUST? IT CHANGES A LOT GOING FORWARD. RUSSIA DID SOMETHING TO OUR COUNTRY IN 2016. IT WAS SERIOUS, IT DESERVED TO BE INVESTIGATED AND IT DESERVED TO BE INVESTIGATED BY A FAIR FBI AGENT WHO WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHING THE PERSON THAT HE WAS INVESTIGATING. HIS LAWYER IS JUST WRONG, THAT BY A STATE IMPACT SOMETHING. HE WAS SO HYPER FOCUSED ON TRUMP THAT HE IGNORED AT THE-ABERDEEN EMAIL AND CAUSED JAMES COMEY TO SEND A LETTER ONE MONTH LATER THAN HE SHOULD HAVE SENT IT. WHY IS IT OUR JOB TO PROVE THAT STRZOK'S IS BIASED IN HIS DECISION-MAKING? YOU COME BEFORE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND PROVE TO US THAT YOU ARE MANIFEST ANIMUS TOWARDS DONALD TRUMP DID NOT AFFECT YOUR DECISION. Bret: LET ME ASK ONE MORE QUESTION. BECAUSE TREY IS EXACTLY RIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTING THAT HE BE PRODUCED AS A WITNESS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IF THAT AGREEMENT IS NOT REACHED WE WILL SHORTLY ISSUE A SUBPOENA FOR HIM TO APPEAR. Bret: SPEAKING OF THAT, THERE ARE ALSO DOCUMENTS THAT YOU WANT THAT YOU STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED. WE ARE SETTING UP A BETTER PROCESS AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. WE HAVE A ROOM AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHERE THEY ARE PRODUCING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS AND ARE INVESTIGATORS ARE PRODUCING THOSE. WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS IN THAT REGARD, BUT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER DOCUMENTS THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED AND THAT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON. WE HAVE MEETINGS COMING UP SHORTLY ON HOW TO GET THOSE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED, PRODUCED. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. AT THE CONGRESS IS IN THEIR REPRESENTATIVE AND THE DOCUMENTS HAVE TO BE PRODUCED. THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO PRODUCE THEM. Bret: CHAIRMAN GAUDI, THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FBI INNER WORKINGS, IT WAS ABOUT THIS ALLEGATION OF SPYGATE. YOU SAID AT THE TIME, YOU THOUGHT THAT THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS THOUGHT THE FBI WAS DOING WHAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS, AND YOU ARE ANIMATED ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING ABOUT THIS IG REPORT. ABOUT HOW THIS IS ALL PROGRESS EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION? BRET, I'M ANIMATED BECAUSE RUSSIA TRIED TO DENY OUR FUNDAMENTALS OF 2016. AND I HEARD WHAT ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HEARD IN 2016, EVERY ONE OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS WOULD SAY, YOU GO FIND OUT WHETHER THAT IS TRUE OR NOT. YOU WILL FIND OUT WHETHER A FOREIGNER, A HOSTILE COUNTRY IS GOING TO MESS WITH OUR ELECTION. WHAT OUR FELLOW CITIZENS ALSO EXPECT IS FOR THE AGENT THAT DOES A FOLLOW-UP TO BE FREE OF TAINT AND BIAS. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THE ONE PICKED TO FOLLOW UP AND LEAVE THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION HAS MANIFEST ANIMUS AND CAN THINK OF A SINGLE PERSON TO VOTE DONALD TRUMP. SO THOSE TWO ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED. MOST OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS WOULD SAY, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT RUSSIA WAS DOING TO US IN 2016 BUT I ALSO WANT THE PERSON THAT IS FINDING OUT AND INVESTIGATING IT TO BE FREE OF BIAS AND FREE OF TAINT. Bret: AND THEY WOULD SAY, MUELLER, FIRE THAT GUY. AND HE DID FIRE HIM. THAT'S WHAT'S SO PERVASIVE ABOUT BIAS, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MUELLER COMES UP WITH. SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT STRZOK'S LEVEL OF ANIMUS WAS SO HIGH Bret: THIS IS WHAT YOU HEAR. THEY HEAR US REPORTING ON THESE 568 PAGES AND THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. AND THEY HEAR WHAT IS COMING OUT OF IT. WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE WRONG IN THEIR MIND. AND INVESTIGATION AFTER INVESTIGATION, IT SEEMS LIKE IT COMES TO A HEAD AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENS. ABSOLUTELY. HUNDREDS OF CLASSIFIED EMAILS, OR HANDLED IMPROPERLY IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW, AND NO ONE HAS BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THAT REGARD. NOW WE SEE THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF THAT INVESTIGATION WAS HANDLED WITH EXTREME BIAS AND A WHOLE HOST OF QUESTIONABLE ACTIONS, AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SOME PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER EMPLOYED AT THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE SO THESE THINGS DON'T OCCUR IN THE FUTURE AND WE DON'T HAVE A 2,020 THAT LOOKS ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT DOES IN TERMS OF THIS KIND OF MISHANDLING OF INVESTIGATIONS OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE, WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO TREY AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE A JOINT HEARING NEXT TUESDAY WHERE WE WILL HAVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND BE ABLE TO GO INTO THIS 560 PAGE REPORT AND ASK QUESTIONS. THE FOLLOWING WEEK, WE HAVE ALREADY REQUESTED THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, MR. ROSENSTEIN, AND THE FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY TO COME FORWARD AND TALK TO US AND ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS BASED ON THAT REPORT. Bret: OTHER QUICK NUGGETS HERE, IN THIS REPORT IT SAYS DEFINITIVELY THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S EMAILS WERE HACKED BY FOREIGN ACTORS OF SOME KIND. LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. WE GOT A LITTLE WINDOW INTO THAT WHEN ONE OF JIM COMEY'S ORIGINAL MEMO DRAFTS HAD THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE AND IT WAS EDITED OUT. THERE ARE TWO REASONS THEY CITE FOR NOT PROSECUTING HILLARY CLINTON. NUMBER ONE, SHE DIDN'T HAVE SPECIFIC GENERAL INTENT AND NUMBER TWO SHE DIDN'T EXPOSE IT TO FOREIGN ACTORS. AND ONE OF THOSE REASONS IS BOGUS. HAVE THEY DONE A GOOD JOB OF INTERVIEWING HER, HAD THEY NOT MADE UP THEIR MIND SIX WEEKS BEFORE THEY WENT TO INTERVIEW HER, PERHAPS I COULD HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE OF INTENT TO COMMIT A CRIME. BUT THEY DIDN'T LOOK FOR IT. THEY MADE UP THEIR MIND BEFORE THEY EVER INTERVIEWED HER ABOUT, THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT HOROWITZ, AND OTHERS, SOME OF THE COLLEAGUES THAT UNLOCKED THE FACT THAT THOSE EMAILS WERE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN ACTORS. Bret: IF I DID THIS, I WOULD BE PROSECUTED. THAT'S IN THE IG REPORT. EXACTLY AND WE FOUND OTHER EVIDENCE WHERE PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED FOR ACTIONS SIMILAR, CONTRARY TO WHAT THE FBI DIRECTORY CONCLUDED. Bret: THE FBI CASE WAS SLOW WALKED? YES, HE SAT ON EMAILS, AND BY THE TIME COMEY GOT TO THEM AND SENT THE LETTER, WE WERE ON THE EVE OF AN ELECTION. BUT IN SEPTEMBER 1 WHEN HE LEARNED ABOUT THIS, HE DID NOTHING BECAUSE HE WAS HYPER FOCUSED ON STRZOK. AND IF I WERE ANY AMERICAN I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW DIRECTOR TOMMY HANDLED THAT. WHY WOULD YOU HANDLE THE WAY YOU RELEASE THAT INFORMATION? Bret: LET ME PLAY THAT. WEEKS WENT BY WITHOUT ANY ACTION. I DO KNOW THAT NEW YORK AND FBI HEADQUARTERS BECAME AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN WEINER'S LAPTOP AND THE INVESTIGATION. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY COULD HAVE MOVED FASTER, OR WHY THE DELAY. SO DID THAT REALLY DRIVE YOU TO THE NOT CONCEALED PART? I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A SLOW ACTIVITY, WHY IT WAS SLOW THIS FIRST COUPLE WEEKS. THERE WAS ONE AGENT AND HE KNOWS THEY WOULDN'T BE PROSECUTED ANYWAY. HE USED THE WORD INDEX, HE DIDN'T PROPERLY INDEX THE FACT THAT HOUMA ABERDEEN WAS MARRIED TO ANTHONY WEINER. HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE MARRIED. I WAS ONE EXCUSE. HE CALLED TO WASHINGTON SPECIFICALLY SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG? LET'S WHAT FINALLY GOT HIM TO MOVE. McCABE WASN'T MOVING AND STRZOK WASN'T MOVING. Bret: SOME OF THE TEXT MESSAGES COULD BE MISSING. WE WILL KEEP LOOKING FOR THEM. HE DID A GOOD JOB AND FROM THE FIRST BIG BATCH OF MISSING TEXT MESSAGES, AND MADE THOSE AVAILABLE BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT, WHICH MADE THEM AVAILABLE TO US. BUT YES, WE HAVE ACTUALLY BENEFITED IN A MULTITUDE OF WAYS TO THIS INVESTIGATION. IT'S FILLED AND A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE BUT ALSO RESULTED IN MORE INFORMATION COMING TO US JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS. Bret: ALL RIGHT, WRAP THIS UP. WINNER AND LOSER IN THIS IG REPORT IN YOUR MIND? I THINK THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION BUREAU AS A WHOLE IS A LOSER AND I HOPE CHRISTOPHER WRAY IS TAKING THIS SOBERING LESSON TO HEART. HE CAN DO GREAT THINGS WITH THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THIS ORGANIZATION, AND WE ALL SHOULD TRUST. I THINK 99% OF THE TIME, WE SHOULD. WINNER IS MICHAEL HOROWITZ, BECAUSE HE PROVES THAT YOU CAN WIN WITH AN INVESTIGATION. THE LOSER IS EVERYONE OF MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT WANTS AND FBI AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT
