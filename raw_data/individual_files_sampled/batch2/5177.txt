all right you ready for this one Facebook one of the biggest most powerful companies on planet Earth says it will begin taking down some misinformation that it spread with the intent to encourage violence this is quote largely a response to episodes in Sri Lanka Myanmar and India in which rumors that spread on Facebook led to real-world attacks on ethnic minorities but the social media giant will not remove false stories if they do not contribute to actual violence or physical harm how do you prove that in an interview with recode CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave an example using Holocaust deniers please listen I'm Jewish and there's a set of people who deny that the Holocaust right not I find that deeply offensive but at the end of the day I don't believe that our platform should take that down because I think that there are things that different people get wrong either I don't think that they're intentionally getting a wrong oh my goodness Ben white and mike lupica are back with me okay gentlemen Mark Zuckerberg later clarified this in an email I'm not sure if it was clarified where he writes I absolutely didn't intend to defend the intent of people who deny that our goal with fake news is not to prevent anyone from saying something untrue but to stop fake news and misinformation spreading across our services huh where did he go to the Donald Trump school of walking back mistakes you talk about this all the time the idea that this guy isn't a public figure and then that he just got tripped up here he doesn't know when to shut up and and while you got to do is get this guy talking and and he later said in the same interview I also get things wrong when I speak publicly gee mark do you think gee mark you think and when you get things wrong and you have a public platform like that action has to be taken you can no longer make the argument he's shy he's not a public speaker then why did you decide to take your company public and grow it to this gargantuan of a beast that clearly you cannot control this is one of the most powerful companies in media shaping social interaction around the world and the lack of response to taking responsibility for that is shocking and the idea that he would defend Holocaust denial is not fake news the Holocaust happened all these people were killed this is fake news take it down the big problem with Facebook is it is a media company it should take responsibility as a media company to publish things only that are true and factual to the best of their ability and not abdicate responsibility and say oh we don't know we don't control this they continue to deny the fact that they are a media company and when Mark Zuckerberg went and testified you might as well have had my children asking him questions or Louise rule who likes to call it the Facebook when you think about when companies like NBC a media company lose advertising dollars we're not losing them to another TV network we're losing them to Facebook they are our competition for advertising that's what makes all of these companies make money so how come Mark Zuckerberg possibly continue to put this forward like we're not a media company please Stephanie in what boneheaded cockeyed moment did he think that Holocaust survivors was a frame of reference in the conversation he could have been he could have had a hundred other references in that moment and he picked the dumbest one he could pick and it does he think he can solve it if I said why I'm Jewish Yeah right okay I'm Jewish but they're therefore I can say this the Holocaust denial is President Trump says how can I possibly support anti-semite my son-in-law is Jewish it's nonsense I want to share the case he made for why content should be flagged as hoaxes for from Infowars for example Infowars he said would not be removed from facebook and here's why we send those two fact-checkers who are all well reputable and and and it have followed standard principles for fact-checking and if those fact checkers say that that it is provably false then we will significantly reduce the distribution right of that content and if someone see you move them down the line rather why don't you want to just say get off our platform well look as abhorrent as some of this content can be I do think that it gets down to this principle of giving people a voice hold on a second there is a difference in content from conspiracy sites like Infowars and let's say a democratic or republican site that have a political agenda this is absolute cowardice on his part infowar says that Sandy Hook didn't happen that there was a rapist pizza ring in Washington DC these are fake news stories that are influencing people and he is refusing to take responsibility for that really you won't take that down when it's proved to be false by these fact checkers you'll just lower it in people's newsfeeds one of the most absurd ridiculous and cowardly thing Mark Zuckerberg just doesn't have to do interviews anymore I'm guessing he's not going to do one any time soon we can sit here all day long and say mark how are you and char will gonna tackle this but did they actually have to doesn't look like the government is taking major action and if you look at the lobbying dollars out of companies like Facebook pretty sure no government officials are gonna force their hand anytime soon here's a good rule of the road if you're in two straight news cycles with Holocaust survivors in in the headlines and you have to send an email to correct something you said originally about Holocaust survivors don't do any interviews for a while because can you imagine what his handlers were doing as they were listening to the feet of this and and oh good one boss why didn't we think of that then from a Facebook perspective we know that President Trump has already said this week well meddling we don't see it as a continued threat though Christopher Rhea and Dan Coates have said otherwise from a social media perspective we have midterms coming up we know the impact misinformation had using vehicles like Facebook can we expect a repeat or do you see any sign that Facebook is actually doing something real-time to change the outcome well I think they say they're trying to they're trying to identify what's fake what's coming from you know non-us actors trying to influence us but I don't think I don't see any reason to believe that we won't see more fake news used to manipulate people used to mean Billee voters that could have an impact on the midterms and then the 2020 election cycle all we're looking forward to is months of thinking that what about the server ought to be a drinking game ought to be a drinking game but Mark Zuckerberg he sat on that cushion and leaned forward as though he was very serious about doing it to Congress hey there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
