this is the only neighborhood these children know not the one that used to exist before the earthquake of December 1988 when the 6.8 magnitude quake struck northern Armenia between twenty-five and fifty thousand people died hundreds of thousands were left homeless much of the city of gilmurry Lenin irken as it was then known was ruined despite millions of dollars in aid money over the years around 2,300 families still live in appalling conditions families like Nadine's we can't all leave here all I want is a house for my children's happiness my happiness is long gone a decent place to live is all she's wanted for the past 30 years back in 1988 this was a thriving Soviet city and this part of town had a park you could still see that rather grand Soviet fountain over there and over here was a university faculty which was completely destroyed by the quake Vahan whose charity helped rehoused families says 30 years should have been enough time for the government to solve the problem there's a huge gap between the government and the people and the government doesn't feel or doesn't know what doesn't want to know the realities and that's why this revolution is happening to make up for decades of mismanagement the Armenian diaspora communities of Armenians living abroad have helped to support charities like vahan's with diaspora money this Center in a neighboring region is educating schoolchildren my hope is that my mia will not be a developing country much longer and that the type of support the desperate can give this country is actual direct foreign investment bringing businesses here and actually developing the country's economy instead of looking at it as a humanitarian obligation of sorts with seismic political events unfolding armenia is on the brink of change there's hope in this community that its children finally face a better future Robin Forestier Walker al Jazeera Kumari
