1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:00,912
STEVE: TODAY THEY ARE

2
00:00:00,912 --> 00:00:01,579
LOOKING AT THE ALLEGATIONS

3
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:03,681
OF DR. CHRISTINE FORD.

4
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:04,815
DAVID BOSSIE JOINS US RIGHT

5
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,851
NOW FROM OUR NATION'S

6
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:07,952
CAPITAL, I DO BELIEVE.

7
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:08,886
DAVID, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

8
00:00:08,886 --> 00:00:10,254
WHAT IS GOING ON?

9
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,857
>> WELL, THIS IS A

10
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:15,526
DISGUSTING SMEAR, A VERY

11
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:16,994
GOOD MAN BRETT KAVANAUGH.

12
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:18,796
IT IS REALLY TROUBLING TO

13
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:19,864
SEE ON MANY LEVELS WHAT THEY

14
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:21,165
ARE DOING TO BRET'S FAMILY

15
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:22,567
AND HIS REPUTATION.

16
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:23,835
BUT, ALSO WHAT THEY ARE

17
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,671
DOING TO FUTURE VICTIMS OF

18
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,772
REAL ASSAULT, WHAT THEY ARE

19
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:32,644
DOING IS USING A POLITICAL

20
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:34,679
CUDGEL AGAINST A POLITICAL

21
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,047
OPPONENT BUT HAVING REAL

22
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,282
LIFE IMPACT ON FUTURE

23
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:37,615
VICTIMS.

24
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:39,684
THIS IS A DISGUSTING DISPLAY

25
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:41,286
BY DEMOCRATS THAT I -- YOU

26
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,021
KNOW, I THINK WE ARE

27
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,956
UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO SEE

28
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:45,557
REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS

29
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:45,890
FOREVER.

30
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,125
NOT ONLY IN SUPREME COURT

31
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,626
NOMINATIONS BUT OUR POLITICS

32
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:49,027
IN GENERAL.

33
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:51,863
SO IT'S VERY STUREB

34
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:52,630
DISTURBING.

35
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,198
AINSLEY: DAVID, IT'S

36
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:54,165
UNFORTUNATE IF HE IS IN A

37
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:56,267
SENSE HIS REPUTATION IS

38
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:56,601
TAINTED.

39
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,468
MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING NOW

40
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:58,903
IS THERE ENOUGH TIME NOW

41
00:00:58,903 --> 00:00:59,838
BETWEEN NOW AND THE MID

42
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,339
TERMS IF THEY DECIDE NOT TO

43
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:02,707
VOTE HIM IN, IS THERE ENOUGH

44
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:03,641
TIME FOR REPUBLICANS TO

45
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,410
BRING IN SOMEONE NEW AND

46
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,845
VOTE ON SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE

47
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:07,512
SUPREME COURT?

48
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:08,680
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

49
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,547
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE

50
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:10,114
NECESSARY.

51
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:10,949
I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

52
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,151
GOING TO ACQUIT HIMSELF VERY

53
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,586
WELL TODAY.

54
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:16,654
UP AGAINST THESE, JUST

55
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:20,558
UNFOUNDED SMEAR TACTICS BY

56
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,259
THESE OUT-OF-TOUCH

57
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:21,626
DEMOCRATS.

58
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:23,328
AND I THINK THAT IT'S GOING

59
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,696
TO BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR BASE

60
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:27,899
TO WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND

61
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,735
WHAT IS GOING ON AND THE

62
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,070
RAMIFICATIONS OF LOSING IN

63
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,405
NOVEMBER AND WE HAD BETTER

64
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,673
TURN OUT TO THE POLLS

65
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:36,474
BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO BE

66
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,276
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

67
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:41,313
TRUMP AGENDA CONTINUING AND

68
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:41,813
ENDING.

69
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:42,781
IT'S ON ELECTION DAY IN THE

70
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,115
MID TERMS.

71
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:45,150
BRIAN: NO QUESTION, DAVID.

72
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,085
THE BASE SEEMS TO HAVE WOKEN

73
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,320
UP FOR THE ADMINISTRATION.

74
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,121
THE BASE ISN'T GOING TO BE

75
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:50,455
ENOUGH.

76
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:51,656
YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP THE

77
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:53,124
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS

78
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:54,159
POLITICALLY INVOLVED AS US

79
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,060
ON THE COUCH AND YOU OVER

80
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,294
THERE IN THE STUDIO.

81
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,429
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK PEOPLE

82
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,397
ON THE OUTSIDE, WHO AREN'T

83
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:00,999
GOING TO DIVE INTO THESE

84
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,567
STORIES LIKE WE ARE, WHAT DO

85
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:03,401
YOU THINK THEY ARE THINKING

86
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,871
RIGHT NOW WHO OFTEN HAVE

87
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,438
SONS AND DAUGHTERS?

88
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:07,305
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

89
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:08,139
AND I HAVE BOTH.

90
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,708
I KNOW MANY DO.

91
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:10,842
BRIAN: AS DO I.

92
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:11,176
>> YES.

93
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:12,244
IT IS VERY TROUBLING TO

94
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:13,879
WATCH THIS ENTIRE EPISODE.

95
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,048
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT

96
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,382
BRETT KAVANAUGH, JUST AS AN

97
00:02:17,382 --> 00:02:18,116
EXAMPLE, YOUR AVERAGE

98
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:22,187
PERSONAL IS LOOKING AT THESE

99
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,555
OUTLANDISH, JUST DISGUSTING

100
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:24,756
ALLEGATIONS OF A GANG RAPE.

101
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:26,091
LOOK, THIS MAN WAS THE

102
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,594
NUMBER THREE PERSON IN KEN

103
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:29,094
STARR'S OPERATION

104
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,430
INVESTIGATING THE MONICA

105
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,731
LEWENSKI SEXUAL ASSAULT OF

106
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,032
BILL CLINTON.

107
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:36,635
THE CLINTON WAR MACHINE TOOK

108
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,370
DOWN EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN

109
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,872
THE 1990S WHO WAS ASSOCIATED

110
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,006
WITH THAT INVESTIGATION AND

111
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,375
THIS NEVER CAME OUT?

112
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,611
15 YEARS AFTER HIS HIGH

113
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:46,712
SCHOOL FINISHED.

114
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,314
AFTER HE LEFT HIGH SCHOOL.

115
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:49,548
CLOSER THAN IT IS TODAY.

116
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:53,185
AND HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE

117
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,620
HIGHEST SEX CRIME ALLEGATION

118
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,654
IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY

119
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:56,856
AND NOTHING CAME OUT BACK

120
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:57,189
THEN.

121
00:02:57,189 --> 00:02:58,657
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

122
00:02:58,657 --> 00:02:59,391
THEY DESTROYED EVERYBODY WHO

123
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:03,429
WAS INVOLVED IN THAT

124
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:04,129
INVESTIGATION COLLINS WAR

125
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,565
MACHINE TOOK NO PRISONERS

126
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:07,233
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH WOULD

127
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,534
HAVE BEEN PAID BACK FOR

128
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:08,968
THIS.

129
00:03:08,968 --> 00:03:10,069
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND NO

130
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:10,703
TRUTH TO IT.

131
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:13,072
I THINK BRET IS GOING TO DO

132
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:14,740
VERY WELL TODAY AND WE HAVE

133
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,342
HIM IN THE SUPREME COURT

134
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:16,709
SOON.

135
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:17,509
STEVE: YOU ARE REFERRING TO

136
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,577
THE BILL CLINTON WAR

137
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:18,911
MACHINE.

138
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,579
BRIAN FALLON WAS PART OF THE

139
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,681
HILLARY CLINTON WAR MACHINE,

140
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:24,583
CAMPAIGN ADVISOR.

141
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,752
HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING THIS:

142
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:27,786
SAVING THE SUPREME COURT

143
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:30,089
FROM TRUMP'S CLUTCHES HAS

144
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,423
ALWAYS INVOLVED A VERY

145
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,858
COMPLICATED TWO-STEP.

146
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,293
FIRST, BLOCK KAVANAUGH,

147
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:35,527
WHICH THEY ARE TRYING RIGHT

148
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:35,928
NOW.

149
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:37,263
THEN FIGHT LIKE HELL TO WIN

150
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:38,464
BACK THE SENATE.

151
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,232
IF KAVANAUGH DROPS OUT, WE

152
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:41,167
ARE HALFWAY THERE.

153
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,401
IF DEMOCRATS ARE ABLE TO WIN

154
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,435
BACK THE SENATE, WE WOULD

155
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:44,937
HAVE A PATH TO BLOCKING

156
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:47,173
TRUMP FROM PICKING ANY OF

157
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,809
THE ARCH CONSERVATIVES ON

158
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:50,910
HIS SHORT LIST IS THAT WHAT

159
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,545
WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW?

160
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,914
>> IT'S EXACTLY THEIR

161
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:55,614
TACTICS.

162
00:03:55,614 --> 00:03:56,182
THANK YOU, BRIAN, FOR

163
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,516
TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

164
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,452
EXACTLY WHAT YOUR MOTIVES

165
00:03:59,452 --> 00:03:59,719
ARE.

166
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,686
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

167
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:02,354
THAT'S WHY THESE MID TERMS

168
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:04,356
HAVE CONSCIOUS SEQUENCES.

169
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,458
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU WHEN

170
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,293
I GET A CHANCE TO INFLUENCE

171
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:08,194
POTENTIALLY THE NEXT SUPREME

172
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:09,261
COURT NOMINEE, THE GLOVES

173
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:10,596
ARE GOING TO BE OFF HERE.

174
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:13,766
EVERY A HISTORY IN THIS

175
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,868
COUNTRY OF PRESIDENTS

176
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,269
REPLACING IDEOLOGICAL SEATS

177
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,071
WITH VERY CLOSE IDEOLOGICAL

178
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,339
PEOPLE.

179
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,675
SO, IF JUSTICE GINSBURG OR

180
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,843
JUSTICE BREYER WERE TO

181
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:25,378
LEAVE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD

182
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:26,445
HISTORICALLY REPLACE

183
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:28,080
SOMEBODY WHO IS CLOSE

184
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,315
IDEOLOGICALLY, NOT

185
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:30,016
NECESSARILY AS FAR AS LEFT

186
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,651
BUT SOMEBODY WHO WAS MORE

187
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,286
MODERATE OR EVEN A LIBERAL.

188
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,821
I THINK THOSE DAYS ARE GONE

189
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,856
AND I THINK THEY ARE GOING

190
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:38,591
TO BE PAID BACK FOR IT IN

191
00:04:38,591 --> 00:04:40,460
DEVASTATING TERMS.

192
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,994
BRIAN: BROAD STROKES.

193
00:04:41,994 --> 00:04:42,762
DAVID, IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS

194
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,464
GUILTY OF THIS, HE DOESN'T

195
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,331
BELONG ON THE BENCH.

196
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:47,233
BUT THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT

197
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,569
IS TO QUESTION THESE

198
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:49,936
ACCUSERS.

199
00:04:49,936 --> 00:04:55,374
HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND NOT

200
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:57,477
LOOK LIKE A BULLY OR COME

201
00:04:57,477 --> 00:05:01,047
OFF AS SOMEBODY QUESTIONING

202
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,081
SOMEBODY SEXUAL ASSAULT.

203
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,883
>> THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING.

204
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,151
AND THAT'S WHY CHAIRMAN

205
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,953
GRASSLEY WAS SO SMART IN

206
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:09,522
BRINGING IN SOMEBODY WHO IS

207
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,189
EXPERIENCED AT THIS.

208
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,691
LOOK, THERE IS A BUNCH OF

209
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:12,692
UNITED STATES SENATORS WITH

210
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:13,893
A LOT OF DIFFERENT

211
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:14,561
EXPERIENCES BOTH REPUBLICAN

212
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:15,261
AND DEMOCRAT.

213
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,897
BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE THE

214
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:18,865
EXPERIENCE OF THE PROSECUTOR

215
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,166
THEY ARE BRINGING IN THAT

216
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:24,070
WILL BASICALLY PROD BRETT

217
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,172
KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD IN

218
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,441
THEIR MEMORY, IN THEIR

219
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:29,409
BACKGROUND, WHAT THEY ARE

220
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:30,844
ABLE TO SAY AS FACT AND THE

221
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:31,911
WHAT THEY THINK THEY

222
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:32,245
BELIEVE.

223
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,646
AND THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

224
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:35,348
THING FOR THE AMERICAN

225
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,583
PEOPLE TO SEE.

226
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,852
BUT A SEASONED PROSECUTOR IS

227
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,888
GOING TO KNOW VERY SERIOUSLY

228
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:43,189
WHERE THE BOUNDARIES ARE.

229
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,559
AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

230
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:49,095
IT IS A THEATER, THAT'S WHAT

231
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:49,662
THIS IS.

232
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,065
BRIAN: I HOPE NOT.

233
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:53,266
>> WE SAW WITH BRETT

234
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,401
KAVANAUGH AND WHAT THE

235
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,101
SENATE DEMOCRATS DID WITH

236
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,469
BRETT KAVANAUGH IN A OPEN

237
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,138
HEARING WHEN WE HAD

238
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,038
SPARTACUS MOMENTS.

239
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,774
BY THE WAY, THIS IS AN

240
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:04,811
ADMITTED GROPER WHO IS NOW

241
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:05,745
SPARTACUS.

242
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:06,279
BRIAN: CORY BOOKER.

243
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,180
>> IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT HE

244
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,882
WOULD DO THAT IN THAT

245
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:09,349
HEARING SETTING.

246
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,016
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THESE

247
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,819
PEOPLE WILL DO TODAY.

248
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:13,420
AINSLEY: CHUCK GRASSLEY

249
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,387
HOPES TO PREVENTS THAT AND

250
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,523
PREVENT A CIRCUS-LIKE

251
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:16,957
SITUATION.

252
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:19,659
BRIAN: NOT MUCH PRESS.

253
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,394
>> IT TAKES COMMON DECENCY

254
00:06:21,394 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF
