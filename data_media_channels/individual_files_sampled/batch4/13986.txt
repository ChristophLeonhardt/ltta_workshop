so Jim Acosta over at CNN who loves him some Jim Acosta I mean that dude loves Jim Acosta get you somebody who loves who loves you the way Jim Acosta loves Jim Acosta I mean really is a he's the White House reporter for CNN and over the weekend right before the weekend he decided would be a worthwhile thing to shout at president Trump's he's standing in the back of the room shouting a president Trump and then he posted a video of himself shouting at President Trump as though Trump has some sort of obvious obligation to answer Jim Acosta shouting from the back of the room now do I care that Jim Acosta shouts at President Trump no I didn't care when a writer at the Daily Caller neil munro shouted at President Obama so it'd be rather hypocritical of me to care that Jim Acosta shouting at Trump but it just goes to show you how when it was a right-winger like neil munro then it was the end of the world that he shouted a question to Barack Obama Jim Acosta does it and he's a hero so Jim Acosta shouts at President Trump and shouting at him because there was a shooting in a news room last week and the media tried to pin it on President Trump when it had nothing to do with President Trump Jim Acosta shouting at the president I like the guy turning around his crush against there's a guy right in front of him turning around and touching him and then Jim Acosta gives a look to the camera like I am so brave for saying that look at these brave eyes whoo-hoo so brave okay so Fox News says well you know that was kind of inappropriate well all right I don't really care about the inappropriate of it it doesn't make a huge difference to me but the part of it that's hilarious is that Jim Acosta then suggests that Fox News is a threat to free speech basically Jim Acosta goes on reliable sources with brian Stelter sure I've appeared on and Brian has him on for basically the entire hour I think he had him on for this long segment which is an empty hour I mean Jim Acosta not a lot going on upstairs with Jim Acosta and this is really really funny so first he starts off by saying Fox News has only angry at me because they need someone to attack well no I'm not really angry at you as much as them used by you Jim Acosta I'm not I'm not angry Jim Acosta because I don't think he's worthy of my anger but I am bemused by the fact that Jim Acosta thinks he's such an important human and I love that CNN now does the navel-gazing routine where Jim Acosta is a hero for having shouted out a question and being rushed by a bald guy in front of him at the White House so here's Bryon's questioning him the president Fox News they don't have Barack Obama around anymore they don't have Hillary Clinton although the president goes after Hillary Clinton a lot so does Fox News and so we've sort of replaced Obama and Hillary they need somebody to attack and I think that we've sort of filled that role okay so yeah that must be it it must be that they're they're attacking me because they don't have Obama to kick around anymore or maybe they're attacking Jim Acosta because you're a highly irritating human and to show how irritating you are this is the best thing ever so it cost us on with Stelter and he's asked about shouting at the president listen to the amount of just drooling self-aggrandizement that in in which Jim Acosta engages it's so phenomenal here we go now of course they're not going to take our questions we have to find opportunities to ask those questions and that's kind of like Sam Donaldson did decades ago that's right and listen if they want to send me to hell I'll I'll still be shouting at the devil what what now if you want to send me to hell I'll be shouting look how brave I am so brave send me to hell I'll shout at the devil and then the devil will fart on you like what what is that what does that even mean send me to hell and I'll shout at the devil yes I'm so brave and I am so tough we are so much journalism Inc Wow bravery ooh now the big question is why Jim Acosta wasn't shouting at the devil when it was the devil he liked right why wasn't he shouting at Barack Obama when it was somebody that you liked and the answer is that Jim Acosta wasn't shouting at him because he was busy asking him kiss ask questions and the media the same media could say the First Amendment should be curved read the New York Times saying the First Amendment should be curbed for you you know the commoner the little person it should be expanded for the press to the extent that we have to force Donald Trump to answer every question Jim Acosta might have because Jim Acosta is a brave man who shouts at the devil in hell you dragged me down to Hades you put me on that boat you send me across the river Styx I'll face down the devil stare him in his beady little eyes and then we will have a face-to-face conversation me and mr. scratch Jim Acosta
