CHECK. I THINK WHAT JEFF IS SAYING WELL, ONE, YOU CAN HAVE THE FBI AND THE CIA AND THE FOREIGN LEGION AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ANY MORE THAN YOU KNOW NOW. THAT'S MY VIEW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. HE SAID HE IS A WEEK IS ENOUGH FOR HIM OR MAYBE LESS. SO WE ARE NOT PLAYING THIS GAME OF OPENING THIS UP AND IT GOES ON FOREVER. WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT I WOULD FEEL BETTER IF THEY HAD A WEEK TO LOOK AT WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US, NO MORE. SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID OKAY WITH THAT. NOW, I WOULD LIKE THEM TO COME FORWARD. I'M GOING TO TALK TO MITCH AND JEFF AND EVENTUALLY ENGAGE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. AGAIN, I DON'T THINK WE NEED THIS. I AM LONG SENSE READY TO VOTE. I THINK HE HAS BEEN VERY POORLY TREATED. JUDGE KAVANAUGH. DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO SAVE JUDGE SINK JUDE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION RECOMMENDATION I THINK JEFF FEELS GOOD ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE PROCESS IS FAIR. YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM. I HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER THAN HIM BEING ON THE BENCH THAN I DO RIGHT NOW. SENATOR GRAHAM. FLAKE PUT OUT A STATEMENT THIS MORNING SAYING HE WAS GOING TO VOTE YES SO WHAT CHANGED. THIS IS CALLED DEMOCRACY. HE TALKED TO HIS COLLEAGUES AND THEY ARE GOING JEFF, JEFF, PLEASE JUST GIVE US A FEW MORE DAYS. JEFF IS A REALLY GOOD GUY. I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

I JUST DON'T SEE WE ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM ANYTHING IN TERMS OF I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. 35 YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW AND HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR.

DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT HELP OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS PERSON ON THE SUPREME COURT IF A WEEK FROM NOW THE FBI COMES BACK AND SAYS WE'RE GOOD. I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ARE GOING TO FEEL DIFFERENT LAY WEEK FROM NOW YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT IN A PHONE BOOTH. HOWEVER, IF JEFF FEELS BETTER ABOUT IT, I FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT. I'M PRACTICAL GUY. SENATOR GRAHAM, DO YOU THINK HE WAS MOVED AFTER HE WAS CON FRONTED BY PROTESTERS ON HIS WAY TO VOTE THIS MORNING? NO. I MEAN, THIS IS WHY LISTEN, THIS IS JEFF FLAKE. I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT I ACTUALLY LIKE ABOUT THE GUY. SUSAN, ALL THESE PEOPLE TAKE IT REALLY SERIOUSLY. JEFF IS NOT A LAWYER. THIS IS HARD. AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN IN THE LYLE SYSTEM. YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMOTIONAL DECISIONS TO MAKE BUT THE FACT PATTERN HERE LENDS ITSELF TO I'M SORRY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH, WE HAVE GOT TO MOVE ON. BUT, HAVING SAID THAT THIS IS JEFF FLAKE BEING VERY SINCERE AND WHAT HE IS TRYING TO I DO RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF, THIS TRYING TO GET SOME DEMOCRATS TO BUY IN WILL A WEEK MATTER? SOME OF THEM SAID IT, WOULD SOME OF THEM WANT TO GO ON AND ON AND ON. AND SOME OF THEM SAY A WEEK LONGER WOULD MAKE A BETTER PROGRESS. DO YOU THINK THE REPUBLICANS WOULD AGREE TO
