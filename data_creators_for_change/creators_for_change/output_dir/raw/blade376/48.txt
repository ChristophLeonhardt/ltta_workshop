1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
I really don't fall into the trap<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,650
using a load of cliches that come with

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,899
doing an update video but to summarize

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,690
the first time since my head injury in

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,550
the past few weeks have I started

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,389
feeling like myself again which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,310
relief i did a video a few months ago

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,250
called life goes on about the challenges

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,439
I've been going through I've known the

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,680
past year I have felt really but

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,900
I've kind of been in denial about it and

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,529
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in denial about being depressed</font>

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,690
I haven't been depressed I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

14
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">on with my life but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that only works for</font>

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,739
so long eventually it creeps up on you

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,710
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going through therapy working</font>

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,629
with my GP and an occupational health

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:45,239
specialist and I took a break<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,710
everything in life and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,640
rebuilding everything from scratch it's

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,010
probably been one of the toughest

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,010
moments in my life but I'm here and I'm

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna be talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more in</font>

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,579
future but when i do look back the two

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,579
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to say is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i fell</font>

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,530
into a trap of<font color="#E5E5E5"> always focusing on what i</font>

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,060
had not done when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> should actually be</font>

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,220
focusing on what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done and what I</font>

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,180
have achieved secondly although I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,920
take you for granted I feel like the

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,290
past few years my<font color="#E5E5E5"> actions have maybe</font>

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,020
given that impression or I feel that I

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't been giving you guys the respect</font>

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,150
that you deserve perhaps I've just not

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">been good at responding to emails or you</font>

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,280
know I keep saying i am gonna be coming

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,500
back and I'm not and I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,509
incredibly flaky but that's not just on

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,670
youtube that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was with my friends my</font>

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and with work this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,189
really big problem for me but I feel

42
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's all falling back into place</font>

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,399
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just wanna let you know that</font>

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">from this moment I am so dedicated to</font>

45
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:50,490
turning my life around all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,619
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can stick with me on that</font>

47
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,509
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still here now and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font>

48
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,610
thank you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much and actually looking</font>

49
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,950
at the comments on my previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I</font>

50
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,479
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been paying attention so what I've</font>

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,610
done is collated some of these ideas and

52
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,049
put them on post-it notes which are

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,610
going to go on the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind me now</font>

54
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,170
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no guarantee i'm going to make a</font>

55
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">video on all of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas but at least</font>

56
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,220
there's some inspiration there this war

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,940
will continue to grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> but hopefully</font>

58
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,360
can also strip it away as I make these

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,790
videos so firstly quite a broad thing I

60
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,670
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be collaborating with lots of</font>

61
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">people I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the YouTube community</font>

62
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,270
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

63
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,130
will definitely help me build my

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,470
confidence up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also there's just</font>

65
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,330
loads of people I've missed working with

66
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,860
so if there's anyone you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind</font>

67
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd like me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a collab with</font>

68
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,830
let me know ai and AGI and the concept

69
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,290
of the singularity and how they're in

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,170
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 to 30 years we could be on</font>

71
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,230
the verge of creating a super God being

72
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,900
does that sound cool lyric analysis a

73
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,670
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are still asking me to do my</font>

74
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,580
sarcastic takes on pop songs ask miles

75
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,170
in which I respond to your questions

76
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,590
directly mindfulness meditation

77
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,390
Millennials the adaptive generation how

78
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,180
young people today are so much better at

79
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,370
adapting to ever changing times for good

80
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,650
and bad reasons and how I feel that

81
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">gives me hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the future of our</font>

82
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,910
planet in American politics currently

83
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,400
there is a race for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Democratic</font>

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,350
presidential nominations and me as so on

from the UK is really feeling the Bern

86
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,370
and if you don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

87
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">then stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around because i'm doing a</font>

mass surveillance so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

video about how you can protect yourself

92
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,430
when using your phone I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

video about well-being and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

94
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,390
depression anyone who follows<font color="#CCCCCC"> me on</font>

95
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,430
social media will probably know I'm a

96
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,709
bit of a gamer with the existence of a

97
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,570
lot of scandals in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube community</font>

98
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,239
what I've been away I often get<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

99
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,550
give my take on the dynamics<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

100
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,830
content creators and their audience my

101

you a little bit now how was that for a

104
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,340
teaser I'd be interested to hear your

105
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,560
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this one but interviews and</font>

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,450
for a long time now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've wanted to do</font>

107
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,360
podcasts or 12 our videos where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">let the camera roll and just have an</font>

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,130
open conversation with people and from

110
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,690
all different industries and walks of

111
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,418
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> I occasionally talk about the</font>

112
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:18,548
concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a resource-based economy and</font>

113
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,230
some of you have asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to clarify</font>

114
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,690
what that is so that's it thank you so

115
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,930
much everyone and

116
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,970
apologies if this video was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> rusty</font>

117
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,039
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take me a few to get back</font>

118
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:30,020
up to speed but I have such huge

119
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,210
ambitions for the next year with this

120
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,979
channel and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope you will join</font>
