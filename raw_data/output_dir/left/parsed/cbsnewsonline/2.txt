>>> THE NEW YORK POLICE 
DEPARTMENT IS GIVING US AN 
UPDATE ABOUT SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES
THAT WERE BEING SENT TO PEOPLE 
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE BILL 
SWEENEY, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN 
CHARGE OF THE FBI OFFICE, SEAN 
BENNETT IT, SPECIAL AGENT IN 
CHARGE OF THE ATF NEW YORK 
DIVISION, AND THE POSTAL 
INSPECTION SERVICES, NEW YORK 
DIVISION. 
IN A MOMENT YOU WILL HEAR FROM 
MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, AND THEN 
BILL, AND JOHN MILLER. 
JOHN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH AN 
UPDATE ON THE SUSPICIOUS 
PACKAGE INVESTIGATIONS WE ARE 
CONDUCTING A NEW YORK CITY.
>>> FIRST AND FOREMOST, 
MESSAGES THAT NEW YORKERS ARE 
SAFE, THERE ARE NO CURRENT 
CREDIBLE THREATS TO ANY 
INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS OR 
LOCATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 
NEW YORKERS ARE SAFE, BUT 
EVERYONE, ALL 8.6 MILLION 
RESIDENTS, AND THE MILLIONS OF 
VISITORS WHO COME HERE EVERY 
YEAR, SHOULD ALWAYS REMAIN 
VIGILANT, AND BE AWARE OF 
SURROUNDINGS. 
AS ALWAYS, I ASKED PEOPLE TO 
ALERT US TO THINGS THAT SEEM 
OUT OF PLACE OR MAKES THEM FEEL 
UNCOMFORTABLE, THEY CAN FLAG 
DOWN A COP, CALL 911, OR THE 
TOLL-FREE NUMBER, 1888 NEW YORK 
CITY SAFE. 
THAT IS FOR ANYTHING NEW. 
ANY OF THE INCIDENTS IN NEW 
YORK. 
WE DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE 
DIFFERENCE EVEN ONE PERSON CAN 
MAKE TOWARDS OUR COLLECTIVE 
SAFETY, AND NEITHER SHOULD THE 
PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY. 
I WANT TO REITERATE, AS I DID 
YESTERDAY, AND AS I DO ANY TIME 
WE TALK ABOUT FAR-REACHING 
INVESTIGATIONS OF THIS NATURE, 
THAT NOTHING WE DO IN LAW-
ENFORCEMENT WE DO ALONE. 
THESE ARE PROFESSIONALS FROM 
AGENCIES YOU SEE AND OTHERS, WE 
ARE INVESTIGATING ALL OF THIS 
WITH GREAT PRECISION. 
I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY, THAT 
WE WILL IDENTIFY AND ARREST THE 
PERSON OR PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THESE ACTS. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE. 
NEW YORK CITY'S INTELLIGENCE 
AND COUNTERTERRORISM 
CAPABILITIES ARE SECOND TO 
NONE. 
EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR, NOT JUST 
THIS WEEK, OUR DETECTIVES AND 
ANALYSTS ARE CONSTANTLY PORING 
OVER THE THREAT STREAM, 
DEPLOYING RESOURCES AROUND THE 
CITY AS NEEDED. 
YOU ARE SEEING THAT TODAY TOO, 
AFTER A ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, 
THE EVENTS OF YESTERDAY AND 
TODAY, I HAVE IMMENSE PRIDE THE 
INCREDIBLE WORK THE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF THE NYPD DO EVERY DAY. 
ESPECIALLY PARTNERING WITH THE 
ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTED 
TODAY. 
>>> I WILL CONCLUDE BY 
REMINDING EVERYONE THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS DO 
NOT CARE ABOUT THE POLITICS 
BEHIND THESE ACTS, WHAT WE CARE 
ABOUT IS KEEPING THE PUBLIC WE 
SERVE SAFE, THAT IS IT, THAT IS 
THE JOB, FIGHTING CRIME AND 
KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE, AND 
THROUGH THE FULL AND WILLING 
PARTNERSHIP OF EVERYONE WHO 
LIVES IN, WORKS IN AND VISITS 
NEW YORK CITY, WE WILL MAKE THE 
SAFEST LARGE CITY IN THE UNITED 
STATES EVEN SAFER. 
MR. MAYOR? 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
COMMISSIONER, I WANT TO EXPRESS 
MY APPRECIATION TO THE NYPD WHO 
HAVE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB 
YESTERDAY AND TODAY ADDRESSING 
THE SITUATION, AND TO ALL OF 
OUR FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERS, 
EVERYONE HAS BEEN WORKING 
TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS 
FORTHRIGHTLY. 
LOOK, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
EMPHASIZE IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS 
IS THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A 
LOT OF POLICE PRESENCE, IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE PROACTIVELY 
TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO 
HAVE COME UNDER ATTACK. 
CLEARLY, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN 
THE LAST FEW DAYS IS AN ATTACK 
ON MEDIA OUTLETS, AN ATTACK ON 
PROMINENT PUBLIC FIGURES. 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THERE 
IS EXPANDED PRESENCE AS LONG AS 
WE NEED IT, TO SHOW VERY 
VIVIDLY, THAT NEW YORK CITY 
TAKES THESE ISSUES SERIOUSLY, 
THAT WE ARE DEFENDING PEOPLE 
WHO ARE COMING UNDER ATTACK, 
PART OF HOW WE PROTECT THE 
DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS TO SHOW 
THAT THREATS LIKE THIS ARE NOT 
TAKEN LIKE -- LIGHTLY. 
I KNOW FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GONE 
THROUGH THIS IN THE LAST FEW 
DAYS, IT IS A PRESENCE THAT 
THEY APPRECIATE GREATLY. 
>>> I WANT TO SAY THAT EVERYDAY 
NEW YORKERS HAVE RESPONDEDTO 
THE SITUATION WITH THE KIND OF 
STRENGTH AND THE KIND OF 
RESILIENCY THAT THE CITY IS 
FAMOUS FOR, IT MAKES ME VERY 
PROUD OF ALL 8.6 MILLION NEW 
YORKERS, THAT THEY HAVE HANDLED 
THE SITUATION WITH A REAL SENSE 
OF RESOLVE, THEY ARE NOT GOING 
TO LET AN ACT OF TERROR 
INTIMIDATE THEM. 
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN 
THIS MOMENT. WHATEVER THE 
MOTIVES, OF THE INDIVIDUALS 
INVOLVED, THE PEOPLE OF THE 
CITY ARE NOT BEING THROWN OFF 
THEIR GAME, ARE NOT HAVING 
THEIR VALUES UNDERMINED OR 
THEIR WAY OF LIFE UNDERMINED. 
NEW YORKERS ARE STANDING STRONG 
RIGHT NOW. 
>>> THE LAST THING I WANT TO 
SAY, IN A MOMENT LIKE THIS, 
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN AND 
FEAR, CLEARLY IT IS AN ON 
SETTING -- UPSETTING TIME, 
THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF DIVISION 
IN THE AIR, PEOPLE CAN FEEL 
POWERLESS, I WANT TO REMIND 
PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE HAS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY A POSITIVE 
AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE HERE. 
FIRST OF ALL, HELPING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT EVERYONE CAN DO, IF YOU 
HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT ALL 
THAT YOU THINK COULD HELP LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ADDRESS THE 
SITUATION, SHARE IT 
IMMEDIATELY. 
LET THEM BE THE JUDGES OF THE 
VALUE OF THE INFORMATION, DON'T 
HOLD IT BACK. 
SO MANY TIMES, I AGREE WITH THE 
COMMISSIONER, LAW ENFORCEMENT 
HAS PROVEN THEY WILL FIND THE 
PERPETRATORS, SOMETIMES IT IS 
BECAUSE AN INDIVIDUAL OR 
CITIZEN STEPS FORWARD WITH 
INFORMATION THAT LEADS TO THE 
KEY BREAKTHROUGH. 
IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION, SHARE 
IT, IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT 
PACKAGES THAT COULD ARRIVE AT 
YOUR HOME OR YOUR WORKPLACE, 
YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT WORRIES 
YOU, REACH OUT TO THE POLICE, 
GET THEIR INVOLVEMENT TO 
ADDRESS THE SITUATION. 
PEOPLE CAN BE PART OF SOLVING 
THIS IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE, AND 
FINALLY, WE CAN BE A PART OF 
SOLVING THE BIGGER SITUATION 
THAT WE ARE SAFE DESK FACING AS 
A SOCIETY, AS A NATION, A TONE 
OF CIVILITY, MUTUAL RESPECT, IS 
SOMETHING WE CAN ALL CREATE, WE 
SHOULD JUST ASK WHAT ARE THE 
MOST PROMINENT VOICES DOING, WE 
HAVE TO ASKED THE QUESTION, ARE 
ALL OF US TREATING EACH OTHER 
WITH RESPECT, MEN AND WOMEN IN 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, PEOPLE IN 
MEDIA, TREATING THEM WITH 
RESPECT, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
WE ALL HAVE TO DO AS A WAY OF 
ADDRESSING A CRISIS LIKE THIS, 
AND WE CAN, AND I HAVE GREAT 
CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL, THANK 
YOU.>>> FIGURE MR. MIR, THANK 
YOU JIMMY. 
RIGHT NOW, THE FBI JOINT 
TERRORISM TASK FORCES AROUND 
THE NATION ARE FULLY ENGAGED ON 
THIS INVESTIGATION, WE ARE 
WORKING FULLY TO PROCESS AND 
ANALYZE INFORMATION, FROM THE 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO, FOR 
AS LONG AS IT TAKES, UNTIL 
THERE IS A RESOLUTION. 
NATIONWIDE INVESTIGATION 
INVOLVING MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS
COAST TO COAST. 
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCOPE, 
AGENCIES RANGING FROM ATF, THE 
POSTAL SERVICE, NYPD, NEW YORK 
STATE POLICE, STATE AND LOCAL 
AGENCIES ARE WORKING SHOULDER 
TO SHOULDER, I WANT TO THINK 
THOSE PARTNERS FOR EFFORTS, 
COLLABORATION AND HARD WORK, 
MUCH OF THE LEADERSHIP IS WITH 
US TODAY. 
AND THE HUNDREDS OF MEN AND 
WOMEN WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER. 
THE FBI WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS 
THE RESOURCES AT OUR DISPOSAL 
TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL OR 
INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE. 
INVESTIGATION IS STILL IN THE 
EARLY STAGES. 
IT BEARS REPEATING TODAY. 
IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE 
DON'T DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT 
COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE 
INVESTIGATION OR FUTURE 
PROSECUTION. 
THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE NEED 
FOR THIS LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL 
SECURITY, AND I WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. 
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT AT 
VARIOUS TIMES IN THE LAST FEW 
DAYS, 10 SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES 
WERE LOCTED IN NEW YORK, 
MARYLAND, FLORIDA, DELAWARE AND 
LOS ANGELES. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED, EACH 
PACKAGE WAS COLLECTED BY 
EXPERTS, EXAMINATIONS ARE NOW 
UNDERWAY AT THE FBI LAB. 
AS TO THE DEVICES LOCATED IN 
NEW YORK WHICH CONTAINED A 
POWDER, THE INITIAL ANALYSIS 
INDICATES THAT THE POWDER IN 
THOSE PARTICULAR ENVELOPES DID 
NOT PRESENT A BIOLOGICAL THREAT.
OTHER ANALYSIS IS ONGOING. 
HOWEVER, IT IS WORTH REPEATING, 
THAT ANY DEVICE COULD BE 
CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY 
DANGEROUS AND TREATED AS SUCH 
UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE. 
WE ADVISE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
TO REMAIN VIGILANT, IF FURTHER 
PACKAGES ARE MAILED. 
THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED 
DANGEROUS, REPORT ANY 
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, AND WORTH 
REPEATING, DO NOT TOUCH, DO NOT 
MOVE, DO NOT HANDLE ANY 
SUSPICIOUS OR UNKNOWN PACKAGE, 
LEAVE IT TO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PROFESSIONALS.>>> WE ARE ASKING 
THE PUBLIC TO CALL US WITH ANY 
INFORMATION, WE HAVE SET UP A 
HOTLINE, IT IS 1-800-CALLFBI, 
AND TIPS.FBI.GOV. PLEASE 
CONTINUE TO ASSIST US WITH YOUR 
EFFORTS, A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME 
TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE 
TOWARDS THIS INVESTIGATION, 
THANK YOU.
>>> I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE UP 
TO SPEED ON THE EVENTS THAT 
OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE TIME 
WARNER CENTER AT CNN YESTERDAY, 
I WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE 
TIMELINE OF THE EVENTS ON 
GREENWICH STREET THIS MORNING. 
IT BEGINS IN THE EARLY HOURS OF 
THE MORNING, WHEN A RETIRED 
NYPD INTELLIGENCE BUREAU 
DETECTIVE, WHO WAS AWAKE AND 
WATCHING THE NEWS, SO THE IMAGE 
OF THE PACKAGING THAT HAS BEEN 
COMMON TO THESE DEVICES, AS 
THEY HAVE TURNED UP AT VARIOUS 
LOCATIONS. 
IT STRUCK HIM THAT IT LOOKED 
VERY MUCH LIKE A PACKAGE HE HAD 
SEEN ON TUESDAY AND MAIL HE WAS 
TO SCREEN FOR ROBERT DE NIRO 
PRODUCTIONS AT THEIR OFFICES ON 
GREENWICH STREET. 
HE CONTACTED, BASED ON HIS 
EXPERIENCE, HE KNEW HOW TO CALL 
THE BOMB SQUAD DIRECTLY, THEY 
ADVISED HIM TO NOTIFY THE FIRST 
PRECINCT. 
THEY WENT DIRECTLY TO THE SCENE,
THEY WERE MET BY EMERGENCY 
SERVICE, AT THE FIRST PRECINCT, 
THEY WERE ABLE TO LOCATE, BASED 
ON THE SECURITY DIRECTOR'S 
INSTRUCTIONS, THE PACKAGE WHERE 
HE DESCRIBED IT, THE BOMB SQUAD 
WAS THEN ABLE TO USE THEIR 
EXPERTISE AND EQUIPMENT TO 
SAFELY PACKAGE THAT INTACT, 
REMOVE IT SAFELY FROM THE 
BUILDING, AND PLACE IT IN THE 
TOTAL CONTAINMENT VESSEL, OUR 
BOMB TRANSPORT VEHICLE, AND 
BRING IT TO THE RODMAN'S NECK 
RANGE, WERE JOINED THE OTHER 
DEVICES WE GOT FROM CNN AND 
FROM THE FBI IN WESTCHESTER 
COUNTY. 
BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON, THEY 
ALL SHOULD'VE BEEN TRANSPORTED 
TO THE FBI LAB IN QUANTICO TO BE
EXAMINED BY THEIR EXPLOSIVES 
PEOPLE, SO THAT THE EVIDENCE IS 
ONE PLACE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE 
WORK OF THE JT TF, I WAS IN THE 
COMMAND POST LAST NIGHT, THEY 
PULLED AN AMAZING INVESTIGATION 
TOGETHER, WITH OTHER TASK 
FORCES AROUND THE COUNTRY, TO 
RUN LEADS, AND THE WORK OF THE 
INTELLIGENCE BUREAU 
DETECTIVE'S, ASSISTING AS A 
VIRTUAL EXTENSION OF THE JT TF, 
AS THE LEADS COME IN, NOT JUST 
TO THE FBI HOTLINE, BUT THE NYC 
SAFE NUMBER, WE ARE UP 139% ON 
THOSE CALLS, WHEN PEOPLE COME 
FORWARD ARE ASKED, THEY DO IT, 
DETECTIVES AND SUPERVISORS, 
1:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, OR IN 
THIS CASE 5:00 IN THE MORNING, 
THEY ARE THERE WITH THE 
EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, THEY 
KNOW WHATTO DO, THE EMERGENCY 
SERVICE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THE 
TRUCK, WITH THE DEVICE IN THE 
BACK, THE HIGHWAY PEOPLE WHO 
ESCORT THEM, AND ALL OF OUR 
PARTNERS, POSTAL INSPECTORS, 
ATF, AND FBI, A LARGE TEAM 
EFFORT, WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE 
CONTINUED HELP OF THE PUBLIC.>>>
AT THIS POINT WE WOULD TAKE 
SOME QUESTIONS. 
SECOND ROW. 
>> WERE THESE DEVICES RIGGED TO 
EXPLODE OR DO YOU THINK THEY 
WERE MORE SENT TO INTIMIDATE? 
>> AS BILL SAID, WE ARE NOT 
GOING TO GIVE YOU 100% ACCURATE 
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THEY WERE, 
WE HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS LIVE 
DEVICES. 
THIS IS A PROTOCOL THAT OUR 
BOMB SQUAD PEOPLE USE, KEEPING 
EVERYONE SAFE. 
BACK ROW? 
>> IS THE REASON TO BELIEVE 
THERE ARE OTHER PACKAGES OUT 
THERE? 
>> WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME, 
BUT THE POSTAL SERVICE, THEY 
ARE HERE, WE ARE DOING OUR BEST 
TO MAKE SURE IF THERE ARE, WE 
IDENTIFY THEM QUICKLY.>> YOU 
SAID THE POWDER WASN'T 
BIOLOGICAL, IS IT A TALCUM 
POWDER OR SOME OTHER KIND OF 
POWDER, AND ALSO ARE YOU 
EXPLODING THE BOMBS, OR ARE YOU 
TAKING THEM TO QUANTICO 
UNEXPLODED? 
>> WE ARE TRANSPORTING WHATEVER 
EVIDENCE WE HAVE TO QUANTICO, 
AS FAR AS THE POWDER, WE ARE 
JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT THAT IT 
IS NOT BIOLOGICAL, WE ARE 
TESTING IT.>> FIRST OF ALL, I 
SAW REPORTS THEY MAY HAVE COME 
FROM FLORIDA, HAVE THEY BEEN 
HAND-DELIVERED OR DELIVERED BY 
COURIER, OR SENT THROUGH THE 
MAIL, COULD THEY HAVE COME FROM 
FLORIDA? 
MY SECOND QUESTION IS, IN TERMS 
OF BEING PROACTIVE, AND 
POTENTIAL TARGETS, ARE YOU 
DOING ANYTHING TO LOOK FOR 
OTHER CELEBRITIES, OR -- 
>> BILL, DO YOU WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT THE FIRST PART, AND JOHN, 
THE SECOND PART?>>> WHAT WAS 
THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION, 
I'M SORRY? 
>> COULD THEY HAVE ORIGINATED 
IN FLORIDA? 
HOW MANY OF THEM WERE MAILED 
VERSUS DELIVERED BY COURIER? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
WHERE WE THINK THE PACK JUST 
CAME FROM, SOME OF THEM WERE 
DELIVERED OR IN THE POSTAL 
SYSTEM, I WILL LEAVE IT AT 
THAT, I WILL NOT GET INTO A 
DESCRIPTION ABOUT WHERE THEY 
ORIGINATED, I WOULD REITERATE, 
REGARDLESS, IF YOU SEE 
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS OR THINK 
YOU MIGHT KNOW INFORMATION, 
PLEASE PROVIDE THAT TO US AT 
THE TIP LINES.
>> AND THE SECOND PART OF THE 
QUESTION.>> TO GET TO THAT, 
WHEN THERE WAS THE FIRST DEVICE 
TARGETING GEORGE SOROS, GOING 
TO THE LOCATIONS ASSOCIATE IT 
WITH THE BUSINESSES, PLACES THAT
IT'S TOO, WHEN THAT DEVELOP. 
THE NEXT DAY, THE OBAMA 
RESIDENCE, WE HAVE A PROGRAM 
CALLED THE NEXUS PROGRAM, THE 
SHIELD PROGRAM, WE HAVE A LOT OF
BUILT-IN, PRESET PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
OUTREACH, WE TURNED ON AND 
TURNED UP, WE WENT TO 
TELEVISION NETWORKS YESTERDAY, 
POSTING POLICE OFFICERS IN 
FRONT OF LOCATIONS THAT WE 
THOUGHT MIGHT BE UNDER 
INCREASED THREAT, WHEN THE 
DEVICE WAS DISCOVERED, 
PERSONNEL WERE THERE WORKING 
WITH THE MAILROOM PEOPLE THERE, 
WORKING ON DETECTION, AND THAT 
WAS INCREASED TO A WIDER SCOPE 
TODAY. 
I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH WHAT 
TYPES OF PEOPLE OR PLACES WE 
HAVE INCREASED TWO, BECAUSE WE 
DON'T WANT TO SINGLE ANYBODY 
OUT WHO HASN'T RECEIVED A 
PACKAGE, SUFFICE IT TO SAY, WE 
ARE WATCHING WHERE THEY GO, AND 
WE ARE DOING EXTENSIVE 
OUTREACH. 
>> TO ADD ONE MORE THING, IF 
YOU GO ON THE NYPD WEBSITE, 
THERE WILL BE INFORMATION ABOUT 
HOW YOU CAN IDENTIFY WHAT MIGHT 
BE A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE.>> 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
SPECULATION AND TALK ABOUT 
WHETHER THESE ARE HOAX DEVICES, 
MAYBE NOT REAL, OR THEY WERE 
INTENDED TO GO OFF, HOW WOULD 
YOU DESCRIBE THEM? 
SOMETHING THAT WAS A HOAX OR 
SHOULD WE BE TAKING IT 
SERIOUSLY? 
>> IT SHOULD BE TAKEN 
SERIOUSLY, NYPD AND FBI ARE 
TREATING THEM AS LIVE DEVICES, 
AS YOU SEE THE WAY THE BOMB 
SQUAD DETECTIVES WENT INTO CNN 
YESTERDAY, THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN 
WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS, AS 
FAR AS A HOAX DEVICE, WE ARE 
NOT TREATING IT THAT WAY. 
>> FOR THE MAYOR, DO YOU 
DEFINITELY FEEL THIS IS 
TERRORISM RELATED, AND WHAT YOU 
SAY TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK? 
>> IT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRORISM, 
BECAUSE IT IS AN EFFORT TO USE 
VIOLENCE TO MAKE A POLITICAL 
IMPACT, THAT'S THE DEFINITION 
OF TERRORISM. 
THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY ARE 
AS TOUGH AS IT GETS, THE CITY 
HAS BEEN THROUGH TERROR ATTACKS 
BEFORE. 
THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY 
UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE GAME PLAN 
OF TERRORISM TO INTIMIDATE US, 
NEW YORKERS REFUSED TO BE 
INTIMIDATED, THAT'S WHAT WE SEE 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
1993, THE FIRST BOMBING OF THE 
WORLD TRADE CENTER, AND 
EVERYTHING SINCE, THE PEOPLE IN 
THE CITY ARE FULL OF RESOLVE, 
AND DON'T LET THESE THINGS 
THROW US OFF OUR GAME. 
AND I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT 
TO INHIBITING TERRORISM GOING 
FORWARD. 
TO CONSISTENTLY SHOW THOSE WHO 
WOULD ATTACK US THAT THEIR 
EFFORTS ARE IN VAIN. 
NEW YORKERS HAVE BEEN EXEMPLARY,
THEY DO HEED THE WARNING, IF YOU
SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING, 
BUT I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, WE 
SEE THIS A LOT, PEOPLE 
SHOULDN'T HESITATE, SOMEONE IS 
LOOKING AT SOMETHING, THEIR 
CONCERN, MAYBE I SHOULD CALL OR 
NOT, IF IT IS ON THE CUSP, MAKE 
THE CALL, IF YOU THINK YOU 
SHOULD, MAKE THE CALL. 
THAT THE EXPERTS RESOLVE 
SOMETHING, ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, 
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKE SENSE 
OF IT.
>>> I AM A LITTLE CONFUSED ON 
THE POWDER, AS A CLARIFICATION, 
ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE WHITE 
POWDER THAT WAS FOUND IN THE 
PACKAGE MAILED TO CNN, OR 
POWDER IN THE DEVICE? 
>> THE POWDER THAT WAS FOUND 
YESTERDAY IN THE PACKAGING, NOT 
BIOLOGICAL, STILL SUBJECTED TO 
FURTHER TESTING.
>> AND THE RETIRED OFFICER WHO 
FOUND THE PACKAGE, AT ROBERT DE 
NIRO'S PROPERTY? 
>> WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM 
FOR DOING HIS JOB CORRECTLY, HE 
SAW IT ON THE NEWS, THANK YOU 
FOR PUTTING THAT OUT THERE, 
THAT THIS PACKAGE WAS ALMOST 
EXACTLY LIKE A PACKAGE THAT 
THEY WERE SHOWN ON TV, HE TOOK 
AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO MAKE SURE 
WE TOOK IT AWAY SAFELY.>> WOULD 
YOU CALL THIS A EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICE, A SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICE, OR SIMPLY A DEVICE? 
WHAT IS THE PROPER TERMINOLOGY? 
>> I WOULD SAY IT IS A 
SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE.>> 
WITH THE INTENT BE TO NOT 
EXPLODE OR DIE 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT 
INTENT, IF YOU ARE A BOMB SQUAD 
DETECTIVE, HOW WOULD YOU 
TREATED? 
RIGHT? 
>> I UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU 
DON'T WANT TO SAY IF THEY ARE 
EXPLOSIVE, BUT FOR YOURSELVES, 
HOW ARE YOU TREATING THEM? 
>> WE ARE TREATING THEM AS 
SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
DETAILS. 
A GOOD TRY, THANK YOU.>> ARE 
ALL OF THE DEVICES, THE 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE OF THE 
ENVELOPES, GETTING IDENTIFYING 
INFORMATION? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DESCRIBE 
WHETHER THEY ARE THE SAME, BUT 
WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT 
THE FOLKS AT THE LAB AT 
QUANTICO ARE EXTREMELY 
THOROUGH, WE WILL GO FROM THERE.
>> THESE DEVICES, DOES THIS 
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED 
BY SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING, OR JUST LOOKED 
AT WEBSITES? 
>> THAT'S THE SAME QUESTION, I 
WON'T GO INTO THAT. 
FRONT ROW. 
>> IS THERE A TIMEFRAME AS TO 
WHEN THE ANALYSIS FROM QUANTICO 
MAY BE RENDERED FOR THE FBI TO 
DO THE INVESTIGATION? 
>> IT IS ONGOING, WE ARE 
DISCOVERING THINGS BY THE HOUR.
>> MAYBE SOMEONE CAN TALK ABOUT 
THE POSTAL INSPECTORS, HOW 
THEY'RE GOING ABOUT TRACKING 
AND FINDING THIS, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS.>> PHIL, 
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
THAT?>> IN TERMS OF TRACKING, 
WE HAVE OVER 600,000 POSTAL 
EMPLOYEES WITH EYES AND EARS 
LOOKING FOR THESE PACKAGES, IN 
THE POSTAL NETWORK WE HAVE 
FOUND NOTHING IN THE LAST EIGHT 
HOURS, WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR IS 
WHAT WE HAVE, 10 PARCELS.>> IF 
ANYTHING, IN TERMS OF HOW 
SIGNIFICANT, HAVE YOU FOUND 
ANYTHING ELSE? 
>> IT IS WORKING, THE EYES AND 
EARS, HIGHLY TRAINED POSTAL 
INSPECTORS, SEARCHING POST LOOKS
-- POSTAL FACILITIES. 
WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANYTHING IN 
THE LAST EIGHT HOURS. 
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE US A 
LOCATION, BUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK
DONE ON THE LOCATION? 
>> NOT AT THIS TIME. 
>> LAST ONE. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE 
TO CALL THE NATIONAL HOTLINE, 1-
888-NYCSAFE, DO YOU HAVE LEADS? 
>> THE HOTLINE, 139% MORE CALLS 
AS OF YESTERDAY, PEOPLE ARE 
CALLING. 
AND AM I GOING TO SPEAK ABOUT 
THOSE LEADS? 
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, WE 
ARE IN THE MIDDLE, THANK YOU 
EVERYBODY, THINK OF HER BEING 
HERE, THANKS. 
-- THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
NYPD GIVING US AN UPDATE OF THE 
SITUATION FOLLOWING BOMB 
THREATS THROUGHOUT NEW YORK 
CITY IN THE COUNTRY, NYPD 
CONFIRMING THAT THEY ARE 
LEARNING THINGS HOUR BY HOUR, 
REGARDING THESE EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICES, THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK 
CITY, DiBLASIO SAID THIS IS IN 
FACT TERRORISM, WITHOUT THERE 
WITH THE INTENT TO TERRORIZE 
THE COMMUNITY, AND THE FACT 
THAT THESE BOMBS, IN PARTICULAR,
THEY WOULD NOT GO FURTHER AS TO 
SAY IF IT WAS INTENDED TO 
EXPLODE OR STOKE FEAR. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
SECURITY CONSULTANT AND 
ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR, FORMER, 
RON, THEY ARE VERY CAREFUL NOT 
TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
THOUGHT THEY WOULD DETONATE, 
WHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM THE 
INVESTIGATION, THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE? 
>> I AM GLAD TO HEAR HOW 
CIRCUMSPECT THEY WERE TODAY, I 
THINK THEY WERE PRESENTING A 
UNITED FRONT, WE ARE 
PROFESSIONAL, CAPABLE, 
AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING LEADS, IN 
A JOINT FASHION, AND THAT THEY 
ARE NOT GOING TO TELL US DOWN 
IN THE WEEDS DETAILS TO LET US 
HAVE OUR SPECULATION RUN WILD, 
A LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON 
ALREADY, TELLING US WHAT THEY 
CAN, BUT REALLY PRESENTING THIS 
IMAGE THAT EVERYBODY, TAKE A 
DEEP BREATH, WE HAVE IT UNDER 
CONTROL.
>> THEY DID SAY WE DO NOT KNOW 
IF THERE ARE MORE BOMBS OUT 
THERE. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PACKAGE 
THAT WAS SENT, WE GOT 
CONFIRMATION IT WAS A RETIRED 
NYPD OFFICIAL THAT THEY SAID 
SAW THE PACKAGE ON TELEVISION, 
THIS PACKAGE, AND HE REMEMBERED 
SCREENING ONE AT ROBERT DE 
NIRO'S AREA OFFICES, AND CALLED 
THE BOMB SQUAD IMMEDIATELY. 
HE WAS ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH THEM DIRECTLY. 
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
>> IT SHOWS YOU THE VALUE, 
RETIRED OR FORMER NYPD OR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, OR OTHERWISE, THE 
VALUE IN GETTING OUT SOME 
IMAGERY ABOUT THESE DEVICES, 
SOME DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE LOOK 
AND FEEL OF THESE DEVICES, THAT 
STRUCK A CHORD WITH SOMEBODY, 
SHOWING YOU THE VALUE OF THAT 
PARTICIPATION OUT THERE, AND 
THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE 
COMMUNITY, GOOD FOR HIM, FOR 
DOING HIS JOB, THAT IS WHAT WE 
WANT FOLKS TO DO, AND FRANKLY, 
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT THE BROADER 
PUBLIC TO DO, THEIR JOB IS TO 
BRING AWARENESS. 
ON THE REST OF US TO LISTEN AND 
PAY ATTENTION, AND YOU AND THE 
MEDIA TO RELAY THE MESSAGE.
>> SOURCES SAY IT LOOKS LIKE 
THEY MAY HAVE ORIGINATED IN 
FLORIDA, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
FOR INVESTIGATORS?
>>LINE UP WITH OTHER 
INFORMATION, THAT MAY BE STILL  
EARLY, AND BILL SWEENEY 
MENTIONED THIS, WE ARE VERY 
EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION, 
SO, I HAVE TO LOOK HARD AT 
EVERY LEAD THAT COMES IN, AND 
EVERY POSSIBILITY. 
DOES IT START TO NARROW DOWN 
FOR SOMEBODY IN FLORIDA? 
THAT'S GREAT IF IT DOES. 
AND, IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE THE 
PERSON. 
BUT THEY REALLY NEED TO KEEP 
THE APERTURE WIDE OPEN, AND 
CONSIDER ANY POSSIBILITY, 
WHETHER THIS IS THE EXTREMIST 
ON THE FAR RIGHT OR SOMEBODY ON 
THE FAR LEFT, LOOKING TO RAISE 
SOME SORT OF SYMPATHY, LOOKING 
TO CHANGE THE COURSE. 
I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY FOR US 
TO GET TO CONCLUSIONS. 
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE PURSUED 
SOON. 
>> WALK ME THROUGH THIS. 
THE BOMB IS NOW WITH THE FBI. 
THEY ARE LOOKING AT IT IN 
QUANTICO, I BELIEVE. 
FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING 
AT THIS, HOW DO THEY BREAK DOWN 
A DEVICE LIKE THIS TO TRY TO 
EXTRAPOLATE CLUES? 
>> SO, THERE ARE MULTIPLE, VERY 
SOPHISTICATED UNITS, DOWN IN 
QUANTICO, THAT WILL BE 
PRIORITIZING THE ORDER OF THE 
EXAMINATIONS, TO DETERMINE, TO 
WE TRY TO EXAMINE FOR 
FINGERPRINTS? 
DO WE TRY TO COLLECT THE DNA 
FIRST? 
AFTER THAT, THE EXPLOSIVES 
FOLKS WILL BE PULLING APART, TO 
LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS 
IN GREAT DETAIL? 
THEY HAVE TOOL MARKS AND 
FIREARMS UNIT THAT ARE LOOKING 
FOR TWO MARKS. 
WHAT ARE THE END CUTS ON THE 
TAPE? 
ON THE WIRING? 
WHAT KIND OF PIPE IS THIS? 
WHERE IS IT PRODUCED? 
THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT IT 
THROUGH MICROSCOPES, AND 
THROUGH USING ALL OF THE TOOLS 
WE HAVE IN A VERY DETAILED 
PROCEDURE, TO BREAK IT DOWN 
INTO THE FINEST COMPONENTS. 
AND TO CONCLUDE, TO GO BACK TO 
THE FORENSICS OF, COULD THESE 
DEVICES HAVE DETONATED? 
WERE THEY DESIGNED TO DETONATE? 
WERE THEY PERHAPS NOT DESIGNED 
TO DETONATE, BUT TO INTIMIDATE? 
THEY WILL BREAK THAT ALL DOWN. 
THEY WILL BE SENDING LEADS BACK 
TO THE JTTF, TO SAY, THIS IS 
WHERE YOU CAN FIND THE PRODUCER 
OF THIS PVC, OF THE INTERNAL úW 
COMPONENTS, OF THE EXPLOSIVES. 
ALL OF THAT WILL BE BROKEN DOWN 
AND ADDITIONAL LEADS WILL BE 
SENT OUT. 
>> RON HOSKO, ALWAYS GREAT TO 
HAVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH, RON. 
>> SURE THING. 
ú>> NIKKI BATIST 
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT 
WE'VE LEARNED FROM NYPD JUST A 
SHORT TIME AGO? 
>> Reporter: HI. 
YES. 
THEY WERE CAREFUL TO SAY TOO 
MUCH ABOUT THIS. 
SORRY, I HAVE TO WHISPER 
BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER PRESS 
CONFERENCE GOING ON BEHIND ME. 
I THINK THE MAIN POINT THAT WE 
LEARNED IS THAT MAYOR DE BLASIO 
IN NEW YORK IS SAYING THIS IS 
AN ACT OF TERRORISM. 
ALSO WE ARE LEARNING THAT THE 
WHITE POWDER MAILED TO THE CNN 
OFFICES IS NOT A BIOLOGICAL 
THREAT.
