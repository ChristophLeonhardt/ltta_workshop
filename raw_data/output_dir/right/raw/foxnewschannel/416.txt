MISSISSIPPI WORKING HARD TO

2
00:00:05,554 --> 00:00:06,722
DRIVE VOTER TURNOUT.

3
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:07,923
RONNA McDANIEL CHAIRMAN OF THE

4
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:09,057
RNC WITH ME NOW.

5
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:10,726
BEFORE I GET TO THE NEXT RALLY

6
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:11,894
IN MINNESOTA AND GET A SENSE OF

7
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:14,730
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,732
MID-TERMS, WHAT IS THE

9
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:17,666
KAVANAUGH ISSUE DOING.

10
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,002
WHAT SORT OF NUMBERS DO THE RNC

11
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:22,371
HAVE AND SEE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

12
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,239
INTEREST IN THIS STORY PERHAPS?

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,209
>> WELL, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

14
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,377
TALKING ABOUT THEIR ENERGY

15
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:31,213
THROUGHOUT THIS PAST TWO YEARS.

16
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,381
IT HAS EXPLODED THE REPUBLICAN

17
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:32,714
ENERGY.

18
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:35,384
I THINK A LOT OF REPUBLICANS

19
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,252
ARE LOOKING AT HOW DEMOCRATS

20
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,154
HANDLED THE KAVANAUGH HEARING

21
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:40,322
HOLDING THESE ALLEGATIONS IN

22
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:43,458
THEIR BACK POCKET UNTIL THE

23
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:47,029
11th HOUR.

24
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:49,398
THE -- THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BY

25
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,065
THE PROCESS.

26
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:51,733
AS I'M TRAVELING THE COUNTRY IT

27
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,036
IS SOMETHING I HEAR ABOUT QUITE

28
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:54,770
A BIT.

29
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:59,341
1 IN 5 VOTERS BASED ON THE

30
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,509
SUPREME COURT, THEIR NUMBER ONE

31
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:00,809
ISSUE.

32
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,312
>> Bill: I SAW THE POLL WHERE

33
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:05,047
WOMEN, THEIR SUPPORT FOR HIM

34
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,348
HAS DROPPED 10 POINTS.

35
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:08,484
DOES THAT LINE UP WITH YOUR

36
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:08,884
INFORMATION?

37
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,287
>> IT DOES NOT AND I'VE BEEN IN

38
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,455
SEVERAL STATES SINCE THE

39
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,557
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS AND WE'RE

40
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,192
SEEING AN UPTICK WITH WOMEN

41
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:17,827
ACROSS THE BOARD THAT SUPPORT

42
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,761
THE PRESIDENT.

43
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,463
AND THEIR ENERGY FOR REPUBLICAN

44
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:21,897
CANDIDATES IS GROWING.

45
00:01:21,897 --> 00:01:24,700
SO WE'RE -- YOU ARE SEEING THE

46
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,868
GENERIC BALLOT NARROW.

47
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:27,403
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING

48
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,938
AT THESE MID-TERMS AND THEY ARE

49
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:29,872
AWAKE AND NOW THE PRESIDENT

50
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,040
GETTING OUT THERE AND SAYING

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,609
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE,

52
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,712
THE RESULTS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE

53
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:39,281
RESIST AND OBSTRUCT AND THE

54
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,249
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS EXEMPLIFIED

55
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:40,549
THAT.

56
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:43,152
WE HAVE TO GET OUT IF WE WANT

57
00:01:43,152 --> 00:01:44,420
TO GET WASHINGTON PRODUCTIVE

58
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,855
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

59
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,256
>> Bill: BALANCE OF POWER RIGHT

60
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,592
NOW IN THE HOUSE, YOU SEE WHERE

61
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:51,227
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE

62
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:51,928
LINED UP.

63
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,829
RONNA, WE HAVE 30 TOSS-UPS ON

64
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:54,864
OUR MAP RIGHT NOW.

65
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,965
MAYBE THERE IS MORE.

66
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,066
MAYBE THERE ARE LESS OVER THE

67
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:58,067
NEXT MONTH OR SO.

68
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,169
RIGHT NOW AS OF TODAY WE SEE 30.

69
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:03,339
FOUR OF WHICH ARE IN MINNESOTA

70
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,441
DISTRICTS 1, 2, 3 AND 8.

71
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,510
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WILL GO

72
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,945

73
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:10,079
>> SATURDAY THE PRESIDENT IS

74
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,916
GOING TO GO THERE AND BE IN THE

75
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,618
FIRST DISTRICT, THE OPEN SEAT

76
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:17,620
THAT WALZ IS VACATING.

77
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,355
>> SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE.

78
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,591
COME ON BACK HERE TO THE MAPS.

79
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:23,493
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS DIVIDED THE

80
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:24,160
COUNTRY IN REGIONS.

81
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,095
WE'LL GO TO THE UPPER MIDWEST

82
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:29,699
IN MINNESOTA AND YOU MENTION

83
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,467
THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS, 1, 2,

84
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,002
3, 8 ARE TOSS-UPS.

85
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,637
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS GOING TO

86
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:36,472
MINNESOTA AND THE HOUSE BATTLES.

87
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,107
WHY DO YOU FIND YOURSELF

88
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,976
FIGHTING FOR A SENATE SEAT IN

89
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:40,877
TENNESSEE AND MISSISSIPPI?

90
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,779
WHY IS THAT HAPPENING?

91
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,180
>> WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS

96
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,424
SHE WANTS TO MAKE SURE SHE IS

97
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,326
ONE OF THE TOP TWO.

98
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,827
TWO REPUBLICANS ARE VIABLE AND

99
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:58,261
ONE DEMOCRAT.

100
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,063
IN MINNESOTA THERE ARE TWO

101
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,464
POTENTIAL FLIPS FOR REPUBLICANS

102
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,233
IN THAT FIRST DISTRICT AND THE

103
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:03,600
EIGHTH.

104
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,767
THESE ARE SEATS WE CAN PICK UP

105
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,869
AND TAKE BACK FROM THE

106
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:07,237
DEMOCRATS.

107
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:08,538
WE'RE GOING ON OFFENSE AND

108
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:08,871
DEFENSE.

109
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:10,506
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

110
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,574
PROTECTING OUR MAJORITY IN THE

111
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,041
HOUSE.

112
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,209
THE PRESIDENT IS VERY AWARE

113
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,012
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE LOSE THE

114
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:16,379
MAJORITY.

115
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,413
NANCY PELOSI BECOMES SPEAKER,

116
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,282

WASHINGTON DOWN AND ALL THAT

118
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,386
WE'VE GAINED, ALL THIS COMEBACK

119
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,021

>> Bill: ON THE GENERIC BALLOT

POINTS, NOW IT SUGGESTS 7 OR 8

132
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,707
