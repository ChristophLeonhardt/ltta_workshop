Beijing, China
   2015
The Chinese government plans to create a megalopolis
with the country’s capital at the center.
The supercity, Jing-Jin-Ji, will combine Beijing,
Tianjin and parts of the Hebei Province.
Officials say the new region will spur development
while alleviating traffic and pollution.
The plan calls for the expansion of a high-speed
rail through the 82,000 sq. mile megalopolis.
Once complete, Jing-Jin-Ji will be about the
size of Kansas and contain more than 100 million
people.
