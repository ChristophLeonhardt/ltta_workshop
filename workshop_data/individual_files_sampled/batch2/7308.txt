new polls like net positive or negative feelings towards some organizations and some politicians mainly politicians and I opted it down so small that I don't remember where it's from but it's still gonna be fun so interestingly for some reason they threw the FBI on here and it's net positive is 34 so throughout all this still very positive but then they go to the politicians and some you know you won't be surprised to find out I have big net positives Joe Biden is at 32 more positive than negative Barack Obama 28 more positive than negative they've got Oprah on here she just now is on every poll I guess so she's at plus 24 and then you get down into the negatives oh by the way they didn't put party on here how are you doing idea I think granted Hillary Clinton's not on there either so maybe they figured out we won't put in there but they don't have Bernie but Hillary Clinton's are retired I know and Bernie's the particular politician in the country you might want to put them in a poll of who's popular the only reason I mention her is because MIT Romney is on here and he's at negative one but he's on the run for Senate that's that's true that's true so then you get down to the negatives and like Paul Ryan's a little bit negative Mike pencil but negative Donald Trump's at negative twenty so pretty negative and then poor turtle Mitch McConnell at negative 26 so he's at 13% positive but he has not be worst at negative 26 he's not the worst can I give you who is the lowest I have no idea I'm just guessing blind here and he and his name hasn't been in the news in a while I'm gonna guess Ted Cruz it is not his his name is not in the news his name isn't in the polls either they're not even polling on Ted Cruz then most negative here is a non-politician Steve Bannon a positive rating five Wow five his negative and then you might say well yeah only like political junkies even know Wiz of course it's five they're both gonna be low know his negatives 49 he's at negative 44 blowing every other politician including Donald Trump out of the water congratulation nobody left I'd like to congratulate Dick Cheney or former most unpopular person in politics ever I think Cheney was dipped down too I don't remember it was 13% on nine said something like that yeah but he like that's dude Bannon is at 5% maybe chris christie looked like i know who's popular is it burning it makes it look like burning so wow yeah that's what happens when you lose your base and you never had the other side to begin with so man and that is why he is out wandering in the middle of the ocean right now lost or as i said originally it like the gravity analogy out in space world like Sandra Bullock twirling around anyway first ever Steve banning Sandra Bullock comparison but not the last okay five percent Steve yeah hashtag eat it mister uncongenial 'ti if you like this video bless your heart we got a lot more where that came from we do a full show every day Monday through Friday come enjoy ad-free by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
