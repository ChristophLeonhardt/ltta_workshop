1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
“I’m Chris Kennedy.”

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,730
“My name is J.B. Pritzker.”

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,090
“My name is Jeanne Ives.”

4
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,150
A Kennedy,

5
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,100
a billionaire

6
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,330
and a right-wing conservative
in a very blue state.

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,830
These are a few
of the candidates

8
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,470
for governor of Illinois.

9
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,700
They are attempting
to unseat this man.

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,010
“I’m Bruce Rauner, governor
of the great state of Illinois.”

11
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,750
Rauner, a Republican, is now
one of the most vulnerable

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,360
incumbents facing
election this year.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
Here are the main players

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,810
and a look at how this race
has been playing out.

15
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,190
This is Democrat J.B. Pritzker.

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,320
He’s a billionaire heir
to the Hyatt Hotel fortune

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,700
and the current frontrunner.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,660
“J.B. is the one I trust to
fight for women, children

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,750
and families all
across Illinois.”

20
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,270
“As Democrats, we need
to come together.

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,820
Let’s back the candidate
ready to lead Illinois.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,480
That’s J.B.”

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,700
But his campaign took a hit when
racially insensitive comments

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,670
he made in 2008 to a wiretapped
politician leaked to the press.

25
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,620
In this audio,
Pritzker is advising

26
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,410
then-Governor
Rod Blagojevich

27
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,290
on who should fill
the U.S. Senate seat

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,640
vacated by Barack Obama
after he won the presidency.

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,470
“I got a great idea for
you though: Jesse White.

30
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,323
Even though I know
you guys aren't like,

31
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:12,313
you know, bosom buddies
or anything,

32
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,443
it covers you on the
African-American thing.”

33
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:15,446
“Correct.”

34
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,340
Pritzker apologized.

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,570
“On that call I was not
my best self.

36
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,110
I can be better.
I have been better.

37
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,720
And I can do better.”

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,770
The Republican side has also
seen its share of controversy.

39
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,820
That’s candidate Jeanne Ives.

40
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,290
And this is one of her
attack ads on Rauner.

41
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,030
“We want to say thank you.”

42
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,320
“Thank you, Bruce Rauner.”

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,110
“Thank you for
signing legislation

44
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,670
that lets me use
the girls’ bathroom.”

45
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,330
“Thank you for making all Illinois
families pay for my abortions.”

46
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,970
Critics called it racist,
sexist and homophobic.

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,050
Ives disagreed.

48
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,600
“That’s exactly what typically
a transgender man looks like.”

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,060
“No, it’s not.”

50
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,800
“Sir, with all due respect.

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,650
Look, I’ve had them
show up at my door.”

52
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,030
Another Democratic
hopeful is Chris Kennedy,

53
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,320
the son of former
Senator Robert Kennedy.

54
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,299
“50 years ago, Chris Kennedy’s
father, Robert F. Kennedy,

55
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:10,729
launched a campaign
for president

56
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,300
based upon the
principles of peace,

57
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,220
justice and compassion
for those who suffer.”

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,360
Kennedy, like Pritzker
and Rauner, is wealthy.

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,580
But unlike the others,
Kennedy is part of

60
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,590
a powerful political dynasty.

61
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,720
Then there’s Democrat
Daniel Biss,

62
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,620
a former math professor
with an income of $35,000.

63
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,740
He’s using his lack of
wealth as a weapon,

64
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,290
producing ads that portray
Kennedy and Pritzker

65
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,330
as superrich and
out of touch.

66
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,400
Rauner has become increasingly
unpopular in Illinois —

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,340
a typically Democratic state.

68
00:03:04,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Can he hold off his toughest
and richest competition yet?
