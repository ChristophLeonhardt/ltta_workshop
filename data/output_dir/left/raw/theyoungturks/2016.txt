00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,620
so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shooting in Orlando of</font>

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,380
course at the pulse nightclub and it was

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,370
done by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Omar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Martine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I that'll you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not to talk about these the names of the</font>

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,309
mass shooters<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards but in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kid</font>

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case I have to be clear and I</font>

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,380
need to clarify that as well as several

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,250
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that happen in that</font>

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,029
shooting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there was a lot of wrong</font>

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,340
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it turns out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,640
stated about this particular guy in his

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,200
motives<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact his wife was tried for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">helping him commit this act of terrorism</font>

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,890

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we found out what the reality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so there was a ton of speculation it</font>

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,500
was it because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually was a person</font>

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,149
who had<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten the pulse nightclub many</font>

20

times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact he was closeted</font>

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,980

<font color="#CCCCCC">nightclub and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he did that now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,449
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

24
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">reported widely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was even a guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,750

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">including myself and and I am said that</font>

30

on a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of occasions well I'm here</font>

31

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,000
that that is not why he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so now we</font>

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out the real story because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

78
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,090
how much time she spent in prison

79
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,379

81
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,739
couldn't kiss him her grandmother died

82

135
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,910
guard recalled<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mateen asking where all</font>

136
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,100
the women<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently in earnest in</font>

137
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before he began his</font>

138
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,420
slaughter so look<font color="#E5E5E5"> very understandable</font>

139
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">why folks thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he had targeted</font>

140
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">gay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he had done</font>

141
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for reasons related to radical Islam</font>

142
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">well is an argument to be made that</font>

143
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,610
obviously that<font color="#E5E5E5"> radical Islam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not in</font>

144
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">favor of homosexuality and they thought</font>

145
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe he might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have targeted almost</font>

146
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">extras on purpose because of that and</font>

147
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,000
there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> reports that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his dad said he</font>

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,770
was once<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote/unquote disgusted by</font>

149
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,510
seeing two men kiss so fair conclusions

150
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,590
early on very<font color="#CCCCCC"> understandable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

151
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,680
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> disturbing that that evidence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

152
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">not come forward more quickly in the</font>

153
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,620
media<font color="#CCCCCC"> and much more disturbing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

154
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,080
prosecutors<font color="#E5E5E5"> pursued this case against</font>

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,030
his wife anyway knowing all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

156
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,750
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and so it looks like it</font>

157
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,409
was not a

158
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:40,779
attack against LGBT members<font color="#CCCCCC"> I to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

159
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,039
that's important but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he killed 49 people</font>

160
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 53 others I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is horrible</font>

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,999
act of terrorism and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a massacre</font>

162
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:55,689
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you classify and clearly</font>

163
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,209
clearly terrorism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so but it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

164
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">done because of other reasons related</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

165
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,999
his closeted personality so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is</font>

166
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,309
apparently not at all true<font color="#E5E5E5"> so why was it</font>

167
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:09,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it was because of radical Islam</font>

168
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:13,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">there were daily obsessive searches</font>

169
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,419
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Isis however on his phone and in</font>

170
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,360
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers so he did not look up gay</font>

171
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,999
porn or he didn't was not on Grindr none

172
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,219
of that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he did look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up Isis a</font>

173
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,089
lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now some of this was reported at</font>

174
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,919
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I and I told</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys about</font>

176
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,259
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment that right before he went</font>

177
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> club he said oh it's because of</font>

178
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,879
Isis and and and went in but now there

179
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">are more details we did not know the</font>

182
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,429
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and at the time when</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">he called in in the middle of the</font>

184
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,509
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one tape saying</font>

193
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,329
you should Massacre innocent people<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

194
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course that's what disturbed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

196
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,539
clear now

197
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,179
yes his motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> was because he was</font>

198
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,089
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Isis propaganda hey they did</font>
