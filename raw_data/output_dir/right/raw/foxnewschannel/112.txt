1
00:00:01,963 --> 00:00:02,897
>> Bill: WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IN

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:03,864
LOS ANGELES ON THAT.

3
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:08,068
>> Julie: FOR MORE ON THIS

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,003
CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS JOINS

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,405
US, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.

6
00:00:11,406 --> 00:00:12,339
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE IS

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,508
WILLING TO SEND IN THE MILITARY

8
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,410
TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IF

9
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,579
NECESSARY AND THREATENED TO

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,580
SEAL THE U.S./MEXICO BORDER.

11
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:20,414
CAN HE DO IT?

12
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:22,283
>> I THINK HE HAS THE AUTHORITY

13
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:22,983
TO DO IT.

14
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,618
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T

15
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:26,820
WANT TO SEE HAPPEN NECESSARILY.

16
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,792
SO -- I THINK THAT TOUGH

17
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:32,826
RHETORIC HAS SPAWNED THIS

18
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:33,694
COOPERATING ATTITUDE FROM

19
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:34,028
MEXICO.

20
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:35,229
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING,

21
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,596
ACTUALLY.

22
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:37,164
>> Julie: HERE IS THE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,799
IN MONTANA AT A RALLY LAST

24
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,102
NIGHT AND GOT A HUGE ROUND OF

25
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,837
APPLAUSE MULTIPLE TIMES LAST

26
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:47,508
NIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN HE BLAMED

27
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:49,376
THE DEMOCRATS FOR OH THE

28
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:50,077
CARAVAN.

29
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:53,347
>> I'M WILLING TO SEND THE

30
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:57,284
MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR BORDER

31
00:00:57,285 --> 00:00:58,452
CAUSED BY THE IMMIGRATION

32
00:00:58,453 --> 00:00:59,386
ONSLAUGHT BROUGHT BY THE

33
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:01,055
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE

34
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:01,956
TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR CHANGE THE

35
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:02,456
LAWS.

36
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:06,193
THEY LIKE IT.

37
00:01:06,194 --> 00:01:07,161
THEY ALSO FIGURE EVERYBODY

38
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:09,263
COMING IN IS GOING TO VOTE

39
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:10,197
DEMOCRAT, YOU KNOW?

40
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:11,265
THEY'RE NOT SO STUPID WHEN YOU

41
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,900
THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

42
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:15,369
BUT THEY ARE CRAZY.

43
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,671
>> Julie: WHERE DO DEMOCRATS

44
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,373
STAND ON STOPPING THIS CARAVAN

45
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:21,475
IF NANCY PELOSI HAD HER WAY AND

46
00:01:21,476 --> 00:01:22,743
TOOK CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THE

47
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:26,246
CASE SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO MAKE

48
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:27,614
IMMIGRATION REFORM -- THE HOUSE

49
00:01:27,615 --> 00:01:29,650
WOULD MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY.

50
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:30,985
WHERE DO THE DEMOCRATS STAND ON

51
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:32,553
STOPPING THE CARAVAN IF THEY

52
00:01:32,554 --> 00:01:33,053
WERE IN CONTROL?

53
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,155
WOULD THEY TRY TO STOP THE

54
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:35,489
CARAVAN?

55
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,124
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

56
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,926
THEY'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR.

57
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:41,061
NANCY PELOSI MADE IT CLEAR

58
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:42,696
YESTERDAY NO WALL, NO BORDER

59
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:43,063
SECURITY.

60
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:43,998
OPEN BORDERS.

61
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:46,400
TALKED ABOUT ELIMINATING ICE.

62
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,770
SO THEY AREN'T GOING TO HAVE A

63
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,573
REAL HEARTBURN I WOULDN'T GUESS

64
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,441
WITH 4,000 PEOPLE IN A CARAVAN

65
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,843
COMING OVER AT ONE TIME AND I

66
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,945
THINK THEY WOULD BE PERFECTLY

67
00:01:57,946 --> 00:01:59,913
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

68
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:01,582
THAT WOULD CHANGE THIS COUNTRY

69
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,983
AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A

70
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,618
GOOD THING FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO

71
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:05,786
GET CONTROL OF THE IMMIGRATION

72
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:06,086
LAWS.

73
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,187
WE NEED TO GET THEM BACK.

74
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:09,223
>> Julie: I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR

75
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:10,823
TWITTER HANDLE BLOWING UP.

76
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:11,859
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT YOU

77
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,060
EARLIER, DID YOU KNOW?

78
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,162
>> I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT.

79
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:15,863
>> Julie: CONGRESSMAN ANDY

80
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,564
BIGGS IS DOING A GREAT JOB FOR

81
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:18,799
ARIZONA AND OUR COUNTRY.

82
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,067
NOT A BAD ENDORSEMENT.

83
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,969
THE PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY

84
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,503
IN ARIZONA TONIGHT.

85
00:02:22,504 --> 00:02:25,005
WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA

86
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:25,406
LOOKING FOR?

87
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,574
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SEE ON

88
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:28,175
IMMIGRATION ESPECIALLY?

89
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,710
>> THEY WANT TO SEE THE BORDER

90
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:31,178
WALL GO UP.

91
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,579
THEY WANT TO SEE THE BORDER

92
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:32,980
SEALED OFF.

93
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:34,381
I WAS JUST AT THE BORDER LAST

94
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:36,350
WEEK AND I JUST TELL YOU, WE

95
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,885
HAVE GOT A REAL PROBLEM.

96
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:39,853
THE BORDER IS POROUS.

97
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,021
THEY WANT TO SATISFY MORE

98
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:41,355
AGENTS.

99
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:43,390
WE HAVE STATIONS WITH HALF THE

100
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:44,091
COMPLIMENT OF AGENTS THEY'RE

101
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:44,792
SUPPOSED TO HAVE.

102
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:46,460
THEY WANT TO SEE -- THEY VIEW

103
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,095
THIS AS A NATIONAL SECURITY

104
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,496
ISSUE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE

105
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:51,131
AND WANT THE PRESIDENT AND

106
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:52,499
CONGRESS, TOO, TO GIVE THE

107
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,134
PRESIDENT WHAT HE NEEDS TO

108
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:54,835
ENACT THESE LAWS.

109
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:57,438
>> Julie: I WANT TO SWITCH

110
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,738
GEARS.

111
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:58,205
ROD ROSENSTEIN.

112
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,474
THE GOP HAS BEEN DYING TO TALK

113
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:01,875
TO HIM ABOUT POTENTIALLY

114
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,977
TALKING AND PLANNING ON

115
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:05,145
WIRETAPPING AND INVOKING THE

116
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:06,346
25th AMENDMENT THE SECOND WEEK

117
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:06,947
ON THE JOB.

118
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:10,717
HE WILL FINALLY TALK TO THE

119
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:13,587
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NEXT

120
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:13,887
WEEK.

121
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,656
JOHN RATCLIFFE, WHAT HE SAID

122
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:16,590
ABOUT WHETHER ROSENSTEIN SHOULD

123
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:18,459
BE FIRED.

124
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,393
>> WHATEVER EXPLANATION ROD

125
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,360
ROSENSTEIN GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP

126
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:21,962
ON AIR FORCE ONE LAST WEEK

127
00:03:21,963 --> 00:03:23,197
SATISFIED THE PRESIDENT AT

128
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:23,964
LEAST FOR NOW.

129
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:25,132
I THINK ROD ROSENSTEIN SHOULD

130
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,467
HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY WITH

131
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:27,468
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND HE WILL

132
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:28,802
GET THAT NEXT WEEK.

133
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,204
>> Julie: DID IT SATISFY THE

134
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,305
PRESIDENT OR IS THE PRESIDENT

135
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:33,006
PLAYING HIS CARDS RIGHT?

136
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:34,675
>> I THINK HE IS PLAYING HIS

137
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,142
CARDS RIGHT.

138
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,044
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT

139
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:37,377
THOUGHT.

140
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:40,347
I JUST AM REALLY CONCERNED WITH

141
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:43,584
ROD ROSENSTEIN EVEN IF HE WAS

142
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,285
SAYING THIS IN JEST IT SHOWS A

143
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:46,386
DISTINCT LACK OF JUDGMENT.

144
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:49,189
I WONDER IF WE CAN REALLY TRUST

145
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,456
HIM.

146
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:51,758
I'M ACTUALLY HOPING THAT WE

147
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,928
MAKE THIS A MORE OPEN

148
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,696
DEPOSITION WHERE ROSENSTEIN IS

149
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:56,163
SWORN IN.

150
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,965
WE HAVE A TRANSCRIPT AND WE GET

151
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:00,767
TO ASK QUESTIONS RATHER THAN

152
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:02,636
HIDING IT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

153
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:03,337
AS HIS BEHALF.

154
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,706
>> Julie: THERE WERE CALLS HE

155
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:06,640
WOULD BE FIRED.

156
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:08,342
WILL HE -- WHAT IS THE

157
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:10,377
PRESIDENT WAITING FOR EXACTLY?

158
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:13,747
>> WELL, I THINK THE PRESIDENT

159
00:04:13,748 --> 00:04:15,449
IS LOOKING FOR -- HE HAS TO

160
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,550
HAVE A REPLACEMENT READY.

161
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,452
HE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS THING.

162
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,586
HE ALSO IS TRYING TO GIVE

163
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:21,288
ROSENSTEIN SOME ROOM.

164
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,689
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT

165
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,657
IS GOING FOR BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

166
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:24,791
TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT.

167
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,927
I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE A YEAR

168
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:27,628
AGO ROSENSTEIN SHOULD NEVER

169
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:29,730
HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE

170
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:30,664
HE HAS TREMENDOUS CONFLICTS OF

171
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:31,398
INTEREST.

172
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,099
>> Julie: OKAY.

173
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,635
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

174
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,036
MUELLER INVESTIGATION?

175
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:37,704
LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF

176
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:40,440
ROSENSTEIN GOES?

177
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,109
>> THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION

178
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,476
CONTINUES.

179
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,478
AND YOU WOULD HAVE THE ATTORNEY

180
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,113
GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD STILL

181
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:47,681
HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE -- THEY

182
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:51,485
HAVEN'T EXERCISED IT TOO MUCH:

183
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:52,519
IT WOULD STILL CONTINUE.

184
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,655
>> Julie: IS THERE ANY TIME

185
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:55,789
THAT INVESTIGATION WILL NOT

186
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,156
CONTINUE?

187
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:58,759
WILL IT EVER END?

188
00:04:58,760 --> 00:00:00,000
JUST CURIOUS.
