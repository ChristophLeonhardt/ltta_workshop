00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,802
>> BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE, YOU

5
00:00:32,803 --> 00:00:35,504
COULD BE THE VICTIM OF

6
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:36,739
KIDNAPPING BY ISIS.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,309
IN AMERICA THERE IS ONE

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,410
FORBIDDEN WORD.

9
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:48,250
ATTACK.

10
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,218
GO.

11
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,822
[BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP] [BLEEP]

12
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:57,493
>> THE N WORD IS LOONEY.

13
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:02,431
IF YOUR BUTTOCKS TOUCH THEM IT

14
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:07,970
>> IF YOU WANT TO WIN, YOU SHOW

15
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:11,907
SOME SKIN.

16
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:12,875
U.S.A., U.S.A.

00:01:12,876 --> 00:01:16,779
[BLEEP] YOU SHOW ME YOUR WEAPON,

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,313
GO.

19
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,258
JESSE: DIAMOND AND SILK.

20
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:33,696
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER B.S.

21
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:34,196
METER THAN THAT.

22
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:37,700
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S SO NAIVE

23
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:40,970
TO FALL FOR THAT.

24
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:43,772
THERE HAS TO BE A CODE OF

25
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:45,708
CONDUCT WHERE YOU DON'T DROP IT

26
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:52,915
WITH IT'S HOT MORE DO YOU DO

27
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:53,716
DEROGATORY ACTIONS.

28
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:56,385
IF HE STEPPED DOWN, OTHER PEOPLE

29
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,689
SHOULD STEP DOWN LIKE THE ONE

30
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,791
RUNNING AROUND SAYING WE HAVE TO

31
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,261
IMPEACH 45.

32
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:08,197
JESSE: I HAD A BUDDY OUT IN

33
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,238
BRUNCH AT THE FOUR SEASONS.

34
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,607
AND SHE ADMITTED TO HIM THAT

35
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,776
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF THE GOOD

36
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:23,612
ECONOMY WOULD GET RE-ELECTED IN

37
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,685
SHE KNOWS IT.

38
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:32,454
JESSE: WE HAVE ELIZABETH WARREN

39
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:36,125
AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO CALL

40
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:37,560
HER, POCAHONTAS.

41
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,894
SHE SAYS THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING

42
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:40,729
TO TURN RACES AGAINST EACH

43
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:45,868
REAL PROBLEM AMERICA.

44
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,107
IT'S THE FAULT OF THOSE PEOPLE.

45
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,876
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE.

46
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:55,778
PEOPLE WHO DON'T SOUNDS LIKE

47
00:02:58,615 --> 00:03:00,482
WHO AREN'T THE SAME COLOR AND

48
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,785
DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE.

49
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:04,987
FILL IN THE BLANKS.

50
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,891
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS PUT BLACK

51
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,225
WORKING PEOPLE AGAINST WHITE

52
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:10,893
WORKING PEOPLE.

53
00:03:10,894 --> 00:03:13,762
JESSE: I DON'T SEE THAT.

54
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,631
BUT I DO SEE THIS.

55
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:17,766
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS A

56
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,101
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WAGES AND

57
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,641
WHITE, AND LEGAL HISPANICS.

58
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,379
INCITE A RACE WAR.

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,281
>> THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

60
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,282
TALKING ABOUT.

61
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:36,251
BUT SAYING POCAHONTAS DON'T EVEN

62
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,586
REALIZES WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

63
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,922
DOING IS BRINGING OUR COUNTRY

64
00:03:39,923 --> 00:03:41,457
TOGETHER, FOLLOWING THE LAW.

65
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,759
SOMETHING THEY ARE NOT USED TO

66
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:47,863
A DEMOCRAT.

67
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,264
SHE DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.

68
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,233
THEY ARE A MESS OVER THERE, SO

69
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,335
THEY WILL RACE BAIT TO GET A

70
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:53,902
VOTE.

71
00:03:53,903 --> 00:03:55,971
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO.

72
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,773
WE KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

73
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,875
DOING AND WE ARE HAPPY HE'S

74
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,543
MAKING THIS PLACE GREATER THAN

75
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,746
WE HAVE EVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

76
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:11,453
THE DOG WHISTLERS.

77
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,590
THEY TRY TO INSTILL FEAR IN

78
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:16,125
PEOPLE WITH IT MANY THEM DOING

79
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,626
ALL THE RACE BAITING AND BEING

80
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:19,962
WITH DIVISIVE.

81
00:04:19,963 --> 00:04:22,364
JESSE: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE

82
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,733
EVEN BUYING IT ANYMORE.

83
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:29,705
THERE IS A WOMAN NAMED JEANNETTE

84
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,472
GARCIA.

85
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,840
SHE IS A WEATHER GIRL.

86
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,609
AND ONE OF THE MOST OF FAMOUS IN

87
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,344
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

88
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:36,478
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DATE HER.

89
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,882
SHE IS AN ELIGIBLE BACHELORETTE.

90
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:42,751
SHE GETS TOGETHER WITH THIS GUY,

91
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,552
DOUGLAS MARTIN.

92
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,754
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL GAMER.

93
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,756
THEY ARE DATING FOR A WHILE AND

94
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:50,426
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT, AND THIS

95
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:53,495
GUY DOUGLAS DUMPS THIS WOMAN

96
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:55,364
HERE BECAUSE HE WANTS TO

97
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:58,133
DEDICATE MORE TIME TO PLAYING

98
00:04:58,134 --> 00:05:00,803
VIDEO GAMES FULL TIME.

99
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:02,638
CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT?

100
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,942
>> ANY TIME A MAN WANT TO PLAY A

101
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,846
YOU.

102
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,148
THAT REJECTION WAS PROBABLY FOR

103
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,116
HER PROTECTION.

104
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,518
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS SHOWING

105
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,124
YOUR GOODIES TO EVERYBODY.

106
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,297
KEEP YOUR GOODIES TO YOURSELF.

107
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,165
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET THE WORLD

108
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,135
SEE EVERYTHING AS A WOMAN.

109
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:37,339
JESSE: HE LIKES "CALL OF DUTY,"

110
00:05:37,340 --> 00:00:00,000
THE VIDEO GAME.
