00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:07,771
>> Tucker: WELL, GOOD EVENING,

2
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:09,272
WELCOME TO TUCKER KARLTON SONT.

3
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:10,540
THERE WAS AN UNEXPECTED AND KIND

4
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,008
OF AMAZING MOMENT AT THE WHITE

5
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,310
HOUSE TODAY.

6
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:14,678
KANYE WEST, THE RAPPER, SHOWED

7
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,413
UP IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

8
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,248
AND PROCEEDED TO GIVE WHAT

9
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:20,450
AMOUNTED TO EFFECTIVELY A

10
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:21,885
CAMPAIGN SPEECH SITTING DIRECTLY

11
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:22,719
ACROSS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,954
UNITED STATES AND POUNDING ON

13
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,156
THE PRESIDENTIAL DESK.

14
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:27,991
YOU'VE LIKELY SEEN PICTURES OF

15
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:28,692
WHAT HAPPENED EVERYWHERE.

16
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,727
THE SCENE MAY HAVE CONFUSED YOU.

17
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:32,829
YOU MIGHT HAVE CORN CLUEDTED IT

18
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,165
WAS A PUBLICITY STUNT STAGED BY

19
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:35,932
FAMOUS PEOPLE TO BECOME MORE

20
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,801
FAMOUS.

21
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:39,603
YOU MAY HAVE FOUND YOURSELF

22
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,438
MUPTERRING ABOUT THE CELEBRITIES

23
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,138
CENTERED FOCUS OF THE PUBLIC

24
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:43,940
DISCOURSE.

25
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:46,142
FELT SAD KNOWING THAT THE

26
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:46,910
DIGNIFIED COUNTRY YOU GREW UP IN

27
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:47,911
IS GONE FOR GOOD.

28
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,145
YOU CAN BE FOR GIVEN FOR

29
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,448
REACHING THOSE CONCLUSIONS.

30
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,182
THEY'RE NOT THE WHOLE STORY OF

31
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:53,216
WHAT HAPPENED.

32
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:55,552
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, KANYE WEST

33
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,187
HAD GENUINELY INTERESTING THINGS

34
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:58,622
THIS AFTERNOON TO SAY.

35
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,190
THINGS WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING

36
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,192
ABOUT IN PUBLIC BUT ARE NOT.

37
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,693
PROBABLY DESTROY HIS CAREER FOR

38
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:05,228
SAYING THEM, CERTAINLY WILL BE

39
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:05,996
DESPISED BY MANY OF HIS FORMER

40
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,130
FRIENDS.

41
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,632
BEFORE ANY OF THAT HAPPENS,

42
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:09,399
LET'S CONSIDER WHAT HE ACTUALLY

43
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,433
SAID.

44
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:11,368
WE'LL GO WITH THE MOST OFFENSIVE

45
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:11,835
THINGS FIRST.

46
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:13,637
HERE THEY ARE.

47
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:15,672
>> YEAH, PEOPLE EFFECT THAT IF

48
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:16,339
YOU'RE BLACK YOU HAVE TO BE

49
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,509
DEMOCRAT.

50
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,610
I HAVE, I HAVE CONVERSATION THAT

51
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,512
IS BASICALLY, SAID, THAT WELFARE

52
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:24,481
IS THE REASON WHY A LOT OF BLACK

53
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:25,849
PEOPLE END UP BEING DEMOCRATS.

54
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,686
THEY SAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT IS A

55
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:31,254
LIMIT TO A AMOUNT OF JOBS.

56
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,989
THE FATHERS LOSE THE JOBS AND

57
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,891
THEY SAY WE'LL GET YOU MORE

58
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:35,625
MONEY FOR HAVING MORE KIDS IN

59
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:37,594
YOUR HOME.

60
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,664
I THINK IT'S THE BRAVERY THAT

61
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:41,398
HELPS YOU BEAT THE GAME CALLED

62
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,399
LIFE.

63
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,501
THEY TRY TO SCARE ME TO NOT WEAR

64
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:45,969
THIS HAT.

65
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,070
MY OWN FRIENDS.

66
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,238
THIS HAT GIVES ME, IT GIVES ME

67
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,639
POWER IN A WAY.

68
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,975
YOU KNOW, MY DAD, AND MY MOM,

69
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:53,576
SEPARATED.

70
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:56,179
SO I CAN'T HAVE A LOT OF MALE

71
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,781
ENERGY IN MY HOME.

72
00:01:57,782 --> 00:02:00,016
YOU KNOW, I LOVE HILLARY, I LOVE

73
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:02,352
EVERYONE, RIGHT?

74
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:04,154
BUT THE CAMPAIGN, WITH HER,

75
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,889
DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL AS A GUY

76
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,124
DIDN'T GET TO SEE MY DAD ALL THE

77
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,592
TIME, LIKE A GUY THAT COULD FLAY

78
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:12,328
CATCH WITH HIS SON.

79
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,430
>> Tucker: ME DIDN'T MAKE ME

80
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,931
FEEL LIKE A GUY WHO COULD PLAY

81
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:17,901
CATCH WITH HIS SON.

82
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:18,935
WEST DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHAT HE

83
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:21,371
MEANT BY THAT, AND YET AT THE

84
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,839
VERY TAME TIME COULDN'T HAVE PUT

85
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,741
IT MORE PRECISELY OR POIGNANTLY.

86
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,544
HE GREW UP IN A PARTY WHOSE

87
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,080
POLICIES HAVE SAYS ME MATICALLY

88
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:33,383
'DROID -- SYSTEMATICALLY

89
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:34,517
DESTROYED THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

90
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:35,285
DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MALE IN MY

91
00:02:35,286 --> 00:02:36,519
HOME.

92
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,088
MILLIONS OF KIDS KNOW WHAT HE'S

93
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:38,521
TALKING ABOUT.

94
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:39,956
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WON'T

95
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:40,724
ACKNOWLEDGE THE KIDS OR THEIR

96
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:41,991
LOSS.

97
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:43,893
TO PARTY LEADERS FATHERS IN THE

98
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,929
HOME ARE AT BEST IRRELEVANT, AT

99
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,963
WORSE THE IMPEDIMENT TO

100
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,531
POLITICAL POWER.

101
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:50,166
MARRIED WOMEN TEND TO VOTE

102
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,469
REPUBLICAN AND THEY KNOW THAT.

103
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,770
WHEN PROMINENT DEMOCRATS ATTACK

104
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,938
THE PAY TREE AR CAN I, THEY'RE

105
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,840
ATTACKING FATHERS.

106
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,677
WHEN THEY WAGE WAR ON TOXIC

107
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:03,413
MASCULINITY, THEY'RE TRYING TO

108
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:05,215
SUPPRESS MASCULINITY ITSELF.

109
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,283
FEW ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAY IT

110
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,051
OUTLOUD, WEST DID AND THEN KEPT

111
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:08,351
GOING.

112
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,721
WATCH THIS.

113
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,656
>> SO, ONE OF THE MOVES THAT I

114
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:15,091
LOVE THAT LIBERALS TRY TO DO,

115
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,060
THE LIBERAL WOULD TRY TO CONTROL

116
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,228
A BLACK PERSON THROUGH THE

117
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:20,130
CONCEPT OF RACISM, THEY KNOW

118
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:20,897
WE'RE VERY PROUD, EMOTIONAL

119
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:22,065
PEOPLE.

120
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,466
WHEN I SAID I LIKE TRUMP, TO

121
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,901
SOME ONE THAT'S LIBERAL, THEY'LL

122
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:26,636
SAY BUT HE'S RACE INTEREST.

123
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:28,538
YOU THINK RACISM COULD CONTROL

124
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:28,905
ME?

125
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,340
OH, THAT DON'T STOP ME, THAT'S

126
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,909
AN INVISIBLE WALL.

127
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,210
>> Tucker: YOU THINK RACISM CAN

128
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,979
CONTROL ME, IT'S AN INVISIBLE

129
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,479
WALL.

130
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,281
THE REPORTERS LOOKING ON SEEMED

131
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:39,749
STUNNED, EVEN BETRAYED.

132
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,185
AND THEN JUST TO RUB IT IN, WEST

133
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:43,086
WENT ON TO DEFEND THE BILL OF

134
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:44,854
RIGHTS, WATCH.

135
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:47,524
>> WHAT ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE WITH

136
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:50,360
THE DEBATE ABOUT THE SECOND

137
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:50,760
AMENDMENT?

138
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,862
>> THE PROBLEM IS ILLEGAL GUNS,

139
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:54,664
NOT LEGAL GUNS.

140
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:58,802
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

141
00:03:58,803 --> 00:03:59,869
>> Tucker: WHAT DO WE MAKE OF

142
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,570
ALL OF THIS?

143
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:03,273
FROM WATCHING CAN YOU TELL THAT

144
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:04,974
KANYE WEST IS AN ECCENTRIC GUY,

145
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,010
HE MEANDERS, HE TALKS LIKE SOME

146
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:10,380
ONE WHO HAS NEVER HAD TO FILTER

147
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:10,814
HIS THOUGHTS.

148
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:11,881
PROBABLY NEVER DID DO.

149
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:14,150
MUCH LIKE SOME ONE ELSE WHO

150
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,852
COMES TO MIND ME MAY BE

151
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,153
PRECISELY CRAZY ENOUGH TO THINK

152
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:17,921
FOR HIMSELF A VALUABLE QUALITY

153
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:18,988
RIGHT NOW.

154
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,656
NO CONSULTANT ADVISED HIM TO SAY

155
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:21,357
ANY OF THAT, NOBODY CONTROLS

156
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,692
HIM.

157
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:23,393
SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T CONTROL

158
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,595
HIMSELF.

159
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,930
BUT LISTEN CAREFULLY TO WHAT HE

160
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:28,832
SAID.

161
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,699
SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE

162
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,201
RAMBLINGS ARE FLASHES OF TRUTH.

163
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,136
REAL INSIGHTS INTO THE WAY THE

164
00:04:33,137 --> 00:04:34,571
WORLD ACTUALLY RACE THEY ARE

165
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,406
THAN THE WAY THEY TELL US IT IS.

166
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,741
NOBODY ELSE IS ALLOWED TO TALK

167
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:39,108
THIS WAY.

168
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,109
GO AHEAD AND TRY IT AT WORK,

169
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,277
YOU'LL GET FIRED.

170
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,413
WEST DOESN'T CARE.

171
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,114
THAT MAKES HIM DANGEROUS TO A

172
00:04:45,115 --> 00:04:47,050
SYSTEM THAT'S BASED ALMOST

173
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,085
ENTIRELY ON PIETY AND LYING.

174
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:50,854
IF YOU'RE BENEFITTING FROM THE

175
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,488
SYSTEM LIKE THAT KANYE WEST MUST

176
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,590
BE CRUSHED.

177
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,892
THE MATH OF IT, THE DEMOCRATIC

178
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:56,993
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES, NEEDS

179
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,628
TO GET ALMOST THE ENTIRE BLACK

180
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,097
VOTE TO WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION.

181
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:02,465
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO.

182
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:05,468
IN ORDER TO DO IT, DEMOCRATS PIT

183
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:06,970
AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER

184
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,104
BASED ON ETHNICITY.

185
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,239
YOU CAN'T SUPPORT THEM, THEY'RE

186
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,406
THE WRONG COLOR.

187
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,575
YOU HEAR THAT ALL THE TIME, THE

188
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,277
ESSENTIAL DEMOCRATIC ARGUMENT.

189
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,347
IT'S DESTRUCTIVE BUT FOR

190
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:22,418
DEMOCRATS I MAY NOT BE WORKING.

191
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,588
TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATING WITH

192
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,724
HISPANIC VOTERS IS 41%, LARGER

193
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:28,391
THAN COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE

194
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:29,525
VOTERS.

195
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,094
IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED

196
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,362
AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS

197
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:33,997
THE GAME WOULD BE OVER.

198
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,366
SO THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.

199
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,167
KANYE WEST MUST BE DESTROYED.

200
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:40,169
SO THE THOUGHT POLICE SWOOPED IN

201
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,738

202
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,306

204
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,844
>> WOW.

205
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,445
OKAY, I'M DOING THIS FOR

206
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:50,446
EVERYBODY WHO'S WATCHING, WHO

207
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,915
TURNED THEIR VOLUME DOWN.

208
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,549
YOU CAN PUT IT BACK UP AGAIN.

209
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,152
>> IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO

210
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,821
GET A THOUGHTFUL PLAY-BY-PLAY

211
00:05:58,822 --> 00:05:59,555
AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS YOU ARE

212
00:05:59,556 --> 00:05:59,956
NOT.

213
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:01,124
THAT WAS AN ASSAULT ON OUR WHITE

214
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,058
HOUSE.

215
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,227
>> A COMBINATION OF STREAM OF

216
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:06,129
CONSCIOUSNESS, I FELT LIKE I WAS

217
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,497
SITTING IN ON A PSYCHIATRIC

218
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:08,364
VISIT, AND A COMMERCIAL FOR

219
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,699
DONALD TRUMP.

220
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,273
>> WHAT I SAW WAS A MINSTREL

221
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:18,808
SHOW.

222
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,778
HIM EMBARRASSING HIMSELF AND

223
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,445
EMBARRASSING AMERICANS BUT

224
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:23,980
MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

225
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:24,948
>> Tucker: SHUT UP, KANYE,

226
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,182
YOU'RE CRAZY.

227
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:28,117
KEEP IN MIND THIS COMING FROM

228
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,285
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE

229
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:29,953
HILLARY CLINTON IS ENTIRELY

230
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,220
WELL.

00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,789
INDEED A SERIOUS PERSON.

STUFF, AND THAT YOU BELIEVE THEM

234
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,127

00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,096
REMIND YOU THAT KANYE WEST IS A

236

HERE WAS CNN TUESDAY NIGHT.

239
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,971

240
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,172
WHEN NEGROS DON'T READ.

AND WE HAVE THIS, NOW, AND NOW

243
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:54,043
AND PERVERT IT.

244
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,078
HE'S GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY TO

245
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,678
STAND WITH HIM AND TAKE

246
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,146

>> Tucker: YOU GOT THAT?

254
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:12,462
HE CAN'T READ BECAUSE HE'S THE

255
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:13,663

00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,499
