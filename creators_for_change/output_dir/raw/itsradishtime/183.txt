5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,130
guess my 24th year of life<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to</font>

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,650
put out a new video blog every week

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,500
talking about things and stuff and the

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">adventures I'm up to in the life so</font>

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,740
probably good place to start would be

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,050
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of my hopes and dreams</font>

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">and goals things i want to do while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,360
23 so next year when I'm done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,910
whole project<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can look back see if I</font>

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,160
accomplish those things goal number one

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,770
which I am already<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of working on by</font>

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,340
being in here is to make more videos and

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,890
make more videos stuff so part of that

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,649
is blogging consistently another part is

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,100
doing some more of those artsy music

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,870
keep pretty things that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,230
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use video as much as I can in</font>

22
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,438
my job and also getting some like paid

23
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,299
freelance video gigs growing talents

24
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,510
chasing dreams no matter it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops is keep</font>

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,580
traveling and getting out and having an

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,380
adventure some things so I got two big

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,830
trips planned for a month of June but I

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,330
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least three more</font>

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,790
adventures for a total of five times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,200
my 23rd year that I get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my city</font>

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,780
and out of my state and have adventures

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,650
and get exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to new things and open</font>

33
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,810
up my<font color="#CCCCCC"> world view and take you along with</font>

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,320
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to achieve that goal I really</font>

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> number three which is live</font>

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,210
more simply this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been something I've</font>

37
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,840
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for like five years now</font>

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,590
and what that looks like is stop buying

39
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,039
so much crap and start saving more money

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,350
or spending my money on things that

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,780
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> support my dreams and goals like</font>

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,179
some video equipment and less on that

43
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,299
kind of instant gratification I want

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,419
this shiny pre thing and just being less

45
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,650
of that kind of American consumer drone

46
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,660
kind of thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me</font>

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,910
happier it really does and it would

48
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,830
allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like by your</font>

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,340
camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> or go on more vacations and also</font>

50
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,310
just have less clutter and crap to deal

51
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,069
with and it helps me focus on what's

52
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,530
more important in life so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

53
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,290
three goals for this next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">life and I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

55
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,250
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of course I'm not</font>

56
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,110
going to do any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or those are my</font>

57
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,670
intentions at least because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't</font>

58
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">made them super measurable but I'm going</font>

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work really hard I'm going to focus</font>

60
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,269
and make it happen if y'all are older

61
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,370
than me tell me what advice you would

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,519
give to your 23 year old self maybe I'll

63
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,650
take it but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advice</font>

64
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,389
or you are younger or older or whatever

65
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,950
