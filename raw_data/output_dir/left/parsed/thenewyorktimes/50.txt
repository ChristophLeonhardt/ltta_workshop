This African grey parrot is
about to make
a successful trade.
Instead of immediately
eating a sunflower,
it takes a plastic
ring that it
can trade for a walnut,
which parrots like better.
This green macaw faces
a different decision:
a walnut now, or the ring
to trade for a walnut later?
Well, walnut now, obviously.
All of this is
part of a new study
of parrot decision-making.
Here’s the question:
Would the birds
be able to judge
the value of a treat
versus a token,
and wait for the better
option if necessary?
Here’s how the
experiment — involving
four different kinds
of parrots — work:
Birds first learn that
each token could be traded
for a specific kind of food.
A metal loop for dry corn —
the least appealing.
A metal bracket for a
sunflower seed — a bit better.
And a plastic ring
for a walnut —
which they liked best.
Then they were offered
complicated choices,
like dry corn now versus
the ring to trade later.
They were able to see
that it made more sense
to take the ring
and wait to trade it
for a piece of walnut.
They also reliably
rejected low-value corn
for a medium-value
bracket, which gave
them a sunflower seed.
They weren’t perfect.
This African grey,
for example,
seems to have a real taste
for immediate gratification.
Overall, out of the
four species tested,
the green macaws were
consistently the best
at making the right trades.
But even for them,
birds like Shouty here,
were occasionally of
two minds about their trades.
Should I?
Shouldn’t I?
Don’t worry, Shouty.
We all have trouble
making decisions.
