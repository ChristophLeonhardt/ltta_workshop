1
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,384
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

2
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,252
VINDICATED AFTER NEARLY A YEAR

3
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:17,187
AND A HALF.

4
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:18,888
TODAY THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD

5
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,790
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,591
PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL BAN.

7
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:23,259
THE LEFT REACTED AND IT'S

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,794
TYPICALLY RESTRAINED WAY AND

9
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,763
THEN THE REPUBLIC TWEETED, IF IT

10
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:29,599
WASN'T CLEAR, IT SHOULD BE NOW.

11
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,973
HE JOINS US NOW.

12
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,308
THANKS FOR COMING ON.

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:39,709
YOU HAD A BAND THAT DIDN'T

14
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:49,119
COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,588
CAN WE JUST SAY NOW THAT WAS

16
00:00:55,793 --> 00:00:57,260
>> YOU KNOW TUCKER I WAS ON YOUR

17
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:58,561
SHOW EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TODAY

18
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:01,564
TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

19
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,600
ONE YEAR AGO THE SUPREME COURT

20
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:07,137
ISSUED ITS DECISION THAT

21
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:10,874
OVERTURNED THE HALT ON THE BAN.

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:11,574
NOW THE SUPREME COURT HAS MADE

23
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:13,743
ITS FINAL RULING ON THE THIRD

24
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:14,577
BAND.

25
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:15,278
THAT THIRD BAND IS DIFFERENT

26
00:01:19,183 --> 00:01:20,283
BUT IN THE END, THERE ARE MANY

27
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:21,985
WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT THE

28
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,354
PURPOSE OF THE BAN WAS TO BAN

29
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:25,355
MUSLIMS FROM COMING TO THE

30
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:25,822
COUNTRY.

31
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:27,490
AND THERE IS SOME SUPPORT FOR

32
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,794
STILL REALLY BAD POLICY FOR THE

33
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:32,829
COUNTRY.

34
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:41,304
TOOK HOLD OF AND A VERY THIN

35
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,940
MAJORITY, 5-FOUR, USED TO RULE

36
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,875
IN FAVOR OF THE BAN AND SUPPORT

37
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:47,677
THE BAND.

38
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,419
>> LOTS OF MUSLIMS WHO WERE NOT

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,388
A SECURITY THREAT AND WE FOUND

40
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,156
SOME MUSLIMS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

41
00:02:00,157 --> 00:02:02,425
ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTS HERE

42
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:02,992
IN THE UNITED STATES.

43
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:04,594
>> Tucker: IT SO HOW WOULD WE

44
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,996
KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, IF IN AN

45
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:09,365
IMMIGRANT IS FROM AFGHANISTAN,

46
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,400
SOMALIA, SYRIA?

47
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:15,371
DO WE TRUST THOSE GOVERNMENTS TO

48
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,307
KEEP CLOSE TRACK OF THE RECORDS

49
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:22,779
SO WHY WOULD WE TAKE ANY RISK IF

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,347
WE EVER CAN'T KNOW OR WILL KNOW

51
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:26,316
WHO THEY ARE?

52
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:27,217
>> OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION

53
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:28,251
THINKS IT KNOWS AND THAT'S WHY

54
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,887
IT'S TAKEN THE TIME TO BAN

55
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,689
PEOPLE FROM CERTAIN COUNTRIES.

56
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,490
>> BUT DON'T WE KNOW, TO A

57
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:43,433
ARE, AND TO PASS ON ANY

58
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,701
APPLICABLE OR RELEVANT RECORDS

59
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:46,836
ABOUT YOU?

60
00:02:46,837 --> 00:02:47,837
THAT'S A DIFFERENT DYSFUNCTIONAL

61
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:48,838
PLACE.

62
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,307
SAME I WOULD ARGUE SYRIA UNDER

63
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,642
CONDITIONS OF CIVIL WAR RIGHT

64
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:53,243
NOW.

65
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,844
SO WHO WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT?

66
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,613
DO WE TRUST THE GOVERNOR OF

67
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,248
SOMALIA TO TELL US THE TRUTH?

68
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,287
>> Tucker: WHILE THEY MAY, BUT

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,363
SOMALIA TO THE VET FOR US, THE

70
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:16,366
PEOPLE OF SOMALIA WHO COME HERE?

71
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:16,933
IS OBVIOUSLY CRAZY.

72
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:20,837
>> WHAT WE HAVE TO TRUST

73
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:21,604
SOMEBODY, RIGHT?

74
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,172
SO WHEN DHS, THE

75
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:24,774
STATE DEPARTMENT -- WHEN THEY

76
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:27,543
DID A REVIEW THEY CONCLUDED

77
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:28,378
ACTUALLY, THIS ADMINISTRATION

78
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:32,982
WARRANTED IT NOT TO BE IN THE

79
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:34,651
BAND.

80
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:38,721
THEN IT WAS PUT BACK IN THE BAND

81
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:39,188
THEN IT WAS PUT BACK IN THE BAN

82
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:39,489
BAND.

83
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,223
>> Tucker: WHY WOULD I TRUST

84
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,557
SOME BUREAUCRAT AT THE

85
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:42,725
STATE DEPARTMENT WITH MY

86
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:45,595
COUNTRY, AND MY CHILDREN?

87
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:46,829
LIKE, HOW WOULD WE KNOW?

88
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,699
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, THE

89
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,467
ADMINISTRATION SAYS, DON'T WORRY

90
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:52,168
ABOUT IT.

91
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:55,772
WHY SHOULDN'T I LAUGH AT THEM

92
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,708
WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING SO

93
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:59,575
SELF-EVIDENTLY STUPID AND

94
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:00,176
DISHONEST TO ME?

95
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:02,779
>> A COUPLE OF REASONS.

96
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,380
FIRST OF ALL AMERICANS DESERVE

97
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,749
TO BE SECURE.

98
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,985
BUT WITH RESPECT TO SOMALIA, ANY

99
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,857
REVIEW PROCESS.

100
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:15,591
THOSE REVIEW PROCESSES GENERALLY

101
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:17,927
WORK.

102
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:21,797
SIMILE IN GOVERNMENT.

103
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,403
THEY DO AN INTERVIEW.

104
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:30,807
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE -- THIS IS SO

105
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:31,140
STUPID.

106
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:33,576
WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY ON THE

107
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:35,745
GROUND IN SOMALIA.

108
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,579
HOW MANY STATE DEPARTMENT

109
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,581
EMPLOYEES ARE VETTING THE MANY

110
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:39,482
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SOMALI

111
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,451
REFUGEES WHO HAVE COME TO THIS

112
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:41,784
COUNTRY?

113
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:47,990
HOW MANY ARE THERE IN SOMALIA?

114
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:48,725
HONESTLY, DO WE HAVE THOUSANDS

115
00:04:55,966 --> 00:05:00,136
DJIBOUTI, THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE

116
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,170
U.S. EMBASSY, AND DO THE PROCESS

117
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:01,537
THERE.

118
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,573
>> BUT WE CAN'T BET ANY OF IT

119
00:05:03,574 --> 00:05:11,247
BECAUSE SOMALIA IS NOT

120
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:12,382
FUNCTIONING COUNTRY.

121
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:12,815
IT'S NOT FINE.

122
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,451
AND WE KNOW THAT NOW, BECAUSE WE

123
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:17,954
HAVE -- ACTUALLY THEY DON'T SHOW

124
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:18,388
THAT AT ALL.

125
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,456
>>  >> NO AMERICAN HAS BEEN KILE

126
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:20,690
>>  >> NO AMERICAN HAS BEEN KILD

127
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:22,992
BY A SIMILE THAT CAME TO THE

128
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:23,426
UNITED STATES.

129
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:27,296
>> AND HOW MUCH MONEY TO SOMALI

130
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:29,198
TERROR GROUPS AL-SHABAAB HAS

131
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,466
FLOWN FROM MINNEAPOLIS THE LAST

132
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,601
THREE YEARS?

133
00:05:31,602 --> 00:00:00,000
WE ARE OUT OF TIME,
