MEADOWS AND RADCLIFFE AND GAUDI,

28
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,326
THOSE GO AWAY, BECAUSE THEY ARE

29
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,595
GOING TO DISMISS THOSE AND

30
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,396

>> Sean: RONNA McDANIEL'S, I

36
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:04,305
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE SENATE.

37
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:05,873
I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL, AS

38
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,776
I DO ABOUT THE HOUSE.

39
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,343
82 PERCENT CHANCE THE

40
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:10,711
REPUBLICANS KEEP THE SENATE,

41
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:11,478
86 PERCENT CHANCE THEY LOSE THE

42
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:14,582
HOUSE BUT HE WAS LONG AND 2016,

43
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:15,049
IS IRAN TONIGHT?

44
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,985
>> I THINK HE IS WRONG, SEAN.

45
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,186
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

46
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,387
BLUE WAVE OVER AND OVER AND OVER

47
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:20,688
AGAIN.

48
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,589
WE ARE NOT SEEING IT.

49
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,957
WE ARE NOT SEEING IT IN THE

50
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,792
EARLY VOTING IN FLORIDA, NEVADA,

51
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,393
STATES THAT WE ARE ALREADY

52
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,394
SEEING RESULTS COME IN, AND

53
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,496
CERTAINLY ON THE SENATE SIDE, WE

54
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:30,164
ARE SEEING LEADS OPEN UP IN

55
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,800
NORTH DAKOTA AND MISSOURI AND

56
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,968
INDIANA, SO THERE IS GREAT

57
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,369
OPPORTUNITIES TO PICK UP SEATS,

58
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,503
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, WE HAVE TO

59
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:37,004
GET OUT AND VOTE.

60
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,405
WHAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT, WHAT

61
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,074
WOULD HAPPEN IF WE LOSE THE

62
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,442
HOUSE, I KNOW IT IS NOT

63
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,743
HALLOWEEN YET, BUT A SHIVER JUST

64
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,578
WENT DOWN MY SPINE.

65
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,312
WE HAVE TWO GET ALL OF OUR

66
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,180
VOTERS OUT THERE.

67
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,982
IT IS NOT A DONE DEAL, THE

68
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:48,682
DEMOCRATS ARE ENERGIZED, THE

69
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:51,385
ONLY WAY WE KEEP THE HOUSE IS IF

70
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,553
WE GET OUR VOTERS OUT PAIRED

71
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:54,488
TALK TO YOUR FAMILY, TALK TO

72
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,190
YOUR FRIENDS.

73
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,124
GET EVERYONE OUT TO THE POLLS.

74
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,226
WE ARE FIGHTING FOR OUR FUTURE.

75
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,428
WE KNOW WHAT NANCY PELOSI MEANS

76
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,097
PAY HIGHER TAXES, ABOLISH

77
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:03,831
I.C.E., OPEN BORDERS, ADMIRING

78

00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,002
INVESTIGATION AFTER

80
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,434
INVESTIGATION.

81
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,070
>> Sean: KEEP OBAMACARE, THAT

82
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,605
IS NOT A RADICAL AGENDA, JASON

83
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:12,940
CHAFFETZ BIT >> NO, IT IS THERE

84
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,508

ABOLISH I.C.E., THEY WANT THE

86
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:16,577
OPEN BORDERS, THEY DON'T

87
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,811
ANNOUNCE ANY OF THE VIOLENCE,

88
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:18,646
THEY STAND FOR THE RESISTANCE

89
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,781
MOVEMENT, THEY WANT SCORCHED

90
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:21,382
EARTH.

91
00:02:21,383 --> 00:02:22,249
THEY ARE GOING TO DELIVER WHAT

92
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,784
THEY ARE PROMISING.

93
00:02:23,785 --> 00:02:25,019
WE SHOULD BELIEVE THEM.

94
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,087
>> Sean: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE,

95
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,123
THEY ARE NOT TELLING THEIR

96
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:30,557
AGENDA.

97
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,593
MAXINE, SCIOSCIA, EVEN

98
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:35,129
JOHN PODESTA, DON'T TALK ABOUT

99
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,996
IMMIGRATION.

100
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:36,864
NOT ONE DEMOCRAT TALKS ABOUT THE

101
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,631
CARE OF AND HEADING TO THE SOLAR

102
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:41,568
BORDER BECAUSE THEY WANT OPEN

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,202
BORDERS, SUPPORT AMNESTY,

104
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:42,970
CENTURY CITIES AND STATES.

105
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,104
THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY WANT,

106
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,573
BUT THEY ARE NOT SAYING IT.

107
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:47,975
PHIL BREDESEN GOT CAUGHT CALLING

108
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:49,376
THE PEOPLE OF TENNESSEE

109
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:49,977

00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,148
I'M ANTIGUN, ALL PRO EVERYTHING

112
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:56,617
OBAMA BELIEF.

113
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:57,785
HEIDI HEITKAMP'S STAFF THINK SHE

114
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,586
WILL BE A SUPER LIBERAL.

115
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,488
THANK GOD ProjectVeritas.com

117
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:10,130
>> THEY ARE THE LIARS.

118
00:03:10,131 --> 00:03:11,298
PRESIDENT TRUMP DELIVERED ON

119
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:11,966
PROMISES FROM THE CAMPAIGN

120
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,233
TRAIL, BE OF DEMOCRAT OR

121
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,169
DEMOCRAT CAUGHT IN A LINE.

122
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,837
RUNNING ON ONE THING, SAYING

123
00:03:16,838 --> 00:03:18,572
ELECT ME, AND THEN I GET THERE,

124
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,040
I'LL GOVERN WITH CHUCK SCHUMER

125
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,541
AND NANCY PELOSI.

126
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:21,575
NANCY PELOSI HAS SAID VERY

127
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,177
CLEARLY, YOU HAVE A FREE PASS,

128
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:23,978
RUN AGAINST ME, SAY YOU WON'T

129
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:25,879
VOTE FOR ME FOR SPEAKER, BECAUSE

130
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,915
I KNOW WHEN YOU COME HOME, YOU

131
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,216
ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR

132
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,517
NANCY PELOSI, WHICH WOULD BE A

133
00:03:30,518 --> 00:00:00,000
DISASTER.
