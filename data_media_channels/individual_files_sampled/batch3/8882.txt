THIS NOVEMBER IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION. AND HELLO FROM CLEVELAND NOON EASTERN. WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE THE STAGE AT ABOUT 1:20. THOSE REMARKS LIVE AS THEY HAPPEN ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF AMERICA'S NEWS HEADQUARTERS. I'M LELAND VITTERT. LIZ, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT WE'RE A COUPLE OF HUNDREDS YARDS FROM WHERE YOU WERE IN NOVEMBER AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S A LITTLE BIT WARMER, BUT NO LESS DIVIDED HERE. ELIZABETH: THAT'S RIGHT, I'M ELIZABETH PRANN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE REMEMBER THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON OHIO IN NOVEMBER BY EIGHT POINTS. THAT BEING SAID, IT'S NO INDICATION WHAT WE'LL SEE ON TUESDAY AND YOU'RE GETTING A PREVIEW FOR US. LELAND: DEFINITELY, A PREVIEW, BOTH FROM THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AS WELL. SOME OF THE ISSUES HERE, THE PRIMARIES HERE IN OHIO ARE THE FIRST STATE-WIDE ELECTION SINCE THE BUCKEYE STATE WENT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 2016. IT WAS KEY ON HIS ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THERE ARE BIG QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT JUST HOW BIG HIS COAT TAILS ARE. AS WE SPEAK THE PRESIDENT IS HERE AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT FOR HIS PICK. FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOT LY FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOT L FIRST THOUGH TO THE HOTLY CONTESTED RACE TO REPLACE JOHN KASICH. THERE WERE FOUR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND THERE ARE NOW TWO, ONE OF THEM CURRENT LT. GOVERNOR MARY TAYLOR TO JOINS US NOW. NICE TO SEE YOU, MA'AM. APPRECIATE IT. BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BE IN CLEVELAND. WELCOME TO CLEVELAND. LELAND: IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE, WE'LL START WITH THIS, ON THE SENATE SIDE, BOTH CANDIDATES ARE WRAPPING THEMSELVES IN WHO IS MORE TRUMP THAN THE OTHER ONE. IS THAT TRUE IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE? SO WHAT WE SEE IN OHIO AND IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT HERE THAN ANYPLACE ELSE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ENJOYS UNBELIEVABLE SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS. EVERY POLL I'VE SEEN THE EVENTS OVER 170 EVENTS THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT FOR OUR PRESIDENT TODAY IN THIS STATE, AS MUCH IF NOT MORE THAN IN NOVEMBER OF 2016. LELAND: IS THAT TRUE ONLY OF PRIMARY VOTERS OR IS THAT TRUE STATE-WIDE? SO, RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY LOOKING MOSTLY OR OBVIOUSLY THREE DAYS. IT'S THREE DAYS OUT. SO, IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE LEARNED IN THIS STATE FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT HIS POLICIES. LELAND: WHAT POLICIES, IS IT SPECIFIC TO POLICIES OR IS IT SPECIFIC TO HIS VIEW OF THE WORLD? IT'S IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT HIS POLICIES. LELAND: WHAT POLICIES? SO YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY, THE TAX REFORM, THE TAX CUTS, TRUMP TAX CUTS AND TALKING TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNDERSTANDING. THIS IS HAVING A REALLY GOOD POSITIVE IMPACT. I TALKED TO SMALL BUSINESSES WHO SAID THE ECONOMY LOOKS GREAT FOR THEM. AND THAT'S GREAT NEWS. IT'S PUTTING OHIOANS BACK TO WORK AND IN OHIO WE SUPPORT AND I SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUILD THE WALL, SECURE OUR BORDERS. SHUT DOWN SANCTUARY CITIES IN THE STATE OF OHIO AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. KEEP OUR PEOPLE SAFE, KEEP THE PROMISES YOU MADE. THAT'S IN FACT WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING. LELAND: YOU HAVE BEEN LT. GOVERNOR FOR LONGER THAN THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PRESIDENT. VALERIE JARRETT SAYING A LOT OF ECONOMIC GROWTH WE'RE SEEING IN OHIO AND STATES IN THE MIDWEST, YEAH, PERHAPS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT, BUT THE ECONOMIC BOOM OF 2010 THROUGH 2016 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO IT. IS THAT FAIR? WHAT CAN YOU TRACE DIRECTLY TO PRESIDENT TRUMP? SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE COULD HAVE BEEN TODAY, WE'RE AT THE END OF THAT TEN-YEAR CYCLE WHERE THE ECONOMY WOULD HAVE IF YOU LOOK BACK IN HISTORY WOULD HAVE CURVED DOWN AND IN FACT, IT HASN'T DONE THAT BECAUSE TRUMP POLICIES ARE WORKING. ALTHOUGH WE'VE MADE PROGRESS IN OHIO AND I THINK YOU SAID OR I HEARD EARLIER, LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT WE'VE SEEN IN HOW LONG. LELAND: 3.9%. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY, BUT WHEN THEY SAY THE ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN THEY EXPECTED AND THEIR OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IS BETTER THAN THEY EXPECTED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BEEN IN OFFICE FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, AND A LOT OF THAT'S ATTRIBUTED TO THE POLICIES THAT HE'S PUT IN PLACE AND THE OTHER THINGS HE'S DOING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS. LELAND: ONE KEY PART OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MESSAGE HAS BEEN THIS, I'M AN OUTSIDER, I'M NOT A POLITICIAN AND I PROMISED I WOULD NOT USE THE WORD OUTSIDER DURING THIS ENTIRE SHOW BECAUSE I'VE HEARD IT TOO MUCH ON TELEVISION IN THE ADS. BUT IT'S THIS IDEA OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF POLITICIAN. THE ATTACK ON YOU IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN AD THAT'S RUNNING IN OHIO AND GET YOUR REACTION. TAKE A LISTEN. IS MARY TAYLOR READY TO BE GOVERNOR? TAYLOR CAN'T KEEP HER STAFF, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT. SHE WAS BUSTED USING THE STATE'S AIRPLANE FOR PERSONAL USE AND TAYLOR IS DOGGED BY RUMOR THAT SHE SKIPS OUT ON WORK, A SLACKER WHOSE WORK SCHEDULE IS ALMOST UNTRACEABLE. MARY TAYLOR, UNFIT AND UNQUALIFIED UNQUALIFIE UNQUALIFIED. LELAND: IMPLICIT IN THAT IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER POLITICIAN, IS THAT A TOUGHER REPUTATION TO SHAKE IN THIS CURRENT CLIMATE? SO, THIS IS WHAT I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ONE, JUST MY OPPONENT LYING ABOUT ME ON TV BECAUSE HE CAN'T DEFEND HIS OWN LIBERAL RECORD. IN FACT, IT'S NOT TRUE. I SPENT 16 YEARS WORKING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS A C.P.A. I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO CREATE A JOB IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. MY OPPONENT HAS BEEN ON THE PUBLIC DOLE FOR 42 YEARS AND HAS HAD NO PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE. SO, IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE ARE IN THAT SILLY SEASON AS WE CALL IT IN POLITICS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FOCUS ON WHAT I BRING TO THE TABLE, NOT ONLY MY PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE, BUT POLICIES WE PUSH TO MAKOO TO MAK O TO MAK TO MAKO TO MA O TO MA TO MAMA TO MAMAKO TO MAMAKOO- TO MAMAKOO MAKE OHIO A BETTER STATE TO WORK AND LIVE. LELAND: AND YOU SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY EIGHT.
