could just this is optional so<font color="#CCCCCC"> once I</font>

50
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,600
realized this once I had this epiphany

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,140
is awakening if you will I felt the need

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,240
to act on it I was like I'm gonna be

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">rangel be here I was low key with my</font>

54
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,220
mischief all the teachers loved me

55
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,370
because I was the cute little educated

56
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,380
black kid because let's be frank I grew

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,800
up in suburban San Antonio so I was like

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,960
always the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only black kid oh that little</font>

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,110
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's adorable the librarian love me</font>

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,650
the principal on my site like everybody

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,350
trusts me right because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when to</font>

62
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,330
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss Julius and I know when to play</font>

63
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,660
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool so I had enough sense to think</font>

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,960
like this is optional but I bet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

65
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,850
parents and the teachers want you to

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,170
stick around like they just don't want

67
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that it's optional right so</font>

68
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,280
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised my hand miss wiedemann calls on</font>

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,080
me to say hey be what you need but she's

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,150
white<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 75 so she's like yes honey what</font>

71
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,310

wiedemann can I go pee and I'm not lying

73
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,800
because I actually do need a pee by the

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,560
way oh I'm backtracking I had recruited

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,400
others so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told others of my manifesto</font>

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,160
of we don't have to be here and I had

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,630
recruited others on my side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

78
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">told them my plan to escape and they</font>

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,750
were on board and then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like deuces</font>

80
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,620
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I pieced out but I had</font>

81
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,690
enough sense to know that I couldn't

82
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave the school necessarily because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,790
bus was what got me home and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I miss</font>

84
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">my bus I'll have to walk home and that's</font>

85
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,450
kind of lame and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

86
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,690
when I have to walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> home I also had like</font>

87
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,430
after school<font color="#E5E5E5"> care that I had to like</font>

88
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,500
contend with and if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bus</font>

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,080
then my after-school care will know that

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,420
I wasn't there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like I thought</font>

91
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,260
ahead y'all that's how to woke too smart

92
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,839
for my own good what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I hung</font>

93
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,850
out at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school I went through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,200
library<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a little while</font>

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,140
roam the halls a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> checked out</font>

96
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,690
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth graders were doing like I</font>

97
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,460
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having fun I was living life and</font>

98
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,830
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrapped it up once my fellow</font>

99
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,020
colleagues had found me I wrapped it up

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,300
at the playground and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all met at the</font>

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,340
playground and had ourselves a good old

102
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,520
time because for a solid 45 minutes we

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,980
were out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> by ourselves no one else</font>

104
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,900
was out there with us and it was golden

105
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,280
had the slide all to myself thank you my

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,040
tragic flaw in this whole endeavor was

107
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,760
that I forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the PE coaches</font>

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,710
quickly notice that there were

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,150
unsupervised kids out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> playground</font>

110
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and were like they approached us and</font>

111
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll I worry all supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be yeah we</font>

112
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,050
were like wherever we want to be haven't

113
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,900
you heard the manifesto ah yeah no

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,800
that's not gonna fly McFly so

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,610
surprisingly enough I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

116
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,980
trouble for this not at the school

117
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,260
anyway and get in<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble at the school</font>

118
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,020
I remember going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to class I think</font>

119
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,830
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going about my day as usual but</font>

120
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,370
then by the time my parents got me from

121
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,700
my after-school care something was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,720
muck apparently they had called them so

123
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
you know my father gets home my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mom's</font>

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,190
already home I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> my father goes home</font>

125
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,260
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he sits me down at the table because</font>

126
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how this work like I don't know you</font>

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">know whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your views are on corporal</font>

128
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,120
punishment and maybe this is that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

129
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,950
whole another vlog all into itself um

130
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,410
but at this point you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad</font>

131
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,790
whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would spank me or if I was</font>

132
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get spanked or punished there</font>

133
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,150
was always a conversation there was

134
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,280
always like the before spanking

135
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,650
conversation the spanking and then the

136
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,900
after spanking conversation so he SAT me

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,220
down and he was like so your mom's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,890
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by this point I've learned</font>

139
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,960
enough in my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the adage has</font>

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,090
absorbed into my skin with mom and not

141
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,620
happy nobody's happy right so I'm

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,570
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh man mom's not happy this</font>

143
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,300
is this is serious he's like but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gotta</font>

144
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,289
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I have to know</font>

145
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,569
what was your mindset going into this

146
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,139
like what did you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know um and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

147
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,189
something that I loved about him he

148
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">always wanted to know my point of view</font>

149
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:42,339
even if he didn't agree you always

150
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,279
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I explained to him my</font>

151
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,680
manifesto calmly it was like you know I

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,119
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> this makes sense right like we</font>

153
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,619
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be here I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

154
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:54,669
there and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like so that is a</font>

155
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:57,309
rational mind set that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

156
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,449
here's the thing it's against the law

157
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,129
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do have to be there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by law</font>

158
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,839
so that's why I'm spanking you now

159
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,330
because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be there and you</font>

160
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,619
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be active and you to be</font>

161
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:08,619
participating this is crucial you have

162
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:11,889
to get to college you know and so I got

163
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,219
my spanking and it sucked um but what

164
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,849
sucked even more was that you know I

165
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,509
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a huge church family like you</font>

166
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,159
know it takes a village to<font color="#E5E5E5"> regent raise</font>

167
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,229
a child like I've got my village you

168
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all part of my church</font>

169
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,419
family that I had grown up with

170
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,589
predominantly african-american church

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the time sunday rolled</font>

172
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,349
around I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all just went down</font>

173
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,229
like on a Tuesday or something by the

174
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:43,930
time sunday rolled around and my mom had

175
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,430
had time to vent to all of the church

176
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,349
family man i was getting it left and

177
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,589

183
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,419

skip school again until I was in college

190
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and even then i did a second tape</font>

191
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,990
because by the time you get to

192
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,568
university you're paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all your</font>

205
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,520

grades and get these scholarships and go

210
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,070
