1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,040
"Offer a magnificent view 
of nature's greatest power display."

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,300
Mount Mayon in the Philippines erupted in
January.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,100
It continued for over a month.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,360
In February, Mount Sinabung erupted in Indonesia.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,840
Here’s the ash cloud as seen from space.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,759
And in June an eruption in Guatemala killed
more than 100 people.

7
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,269
Turns out this is pretty normal.

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:35,150
On average, there are 10 to 20 volcanoes
erupting around the world at any given time.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,300
When you look at these on a map and add volcanoes that are not currently erupting,

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,160
you'll start to see a pattern.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,540
Most are concentrated here, along the edges
of the Pacific Ocean.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,270
This region is known as the Ring of Fire,
a stretch of hundreds of volcanoes spanning

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,710
40,000 kilometers.

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,180
It’s also where most of the earthquakes
and tsunamis in the world take place.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,430
This year alone, the region saw 4 eruptions
and 5 of the world's biggest earthquakes .

16
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,149
The Ring of Fire is where some of history’s
most devastating natural disasters have happened

17
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:09,200
and will continue to happen.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,760
"There are still some volcanoes around the world

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,040
in various places. Do you know where they are?

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
Here's a map, see if you can find some."

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,480
Volcanoes have terrorized people for centuries.

22
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,740
In the 1800s, explorers and scientists started
grouping them together.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,170
Take a look at this map from 1852.

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,319
It has “the volcanic series of Australia”.

25
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,639
And "the volcanic series of Japan and Kamchatka,
in Russia."

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,360
In fact, the whole Ring of Fire is marked
here.

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,100
Scientists recognized the belt of activity,
but it would take another 100 years until

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,660
they agreed on what caused it.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,080
"That's right, it's a volcano. Well, you see what you and I are going to talk about today is the world under our feet."

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,980
By the 1960s, most scientists concluded the
earth’s surface is made up of a series of tectonic plates

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,280
that slowly move into and apart from each other.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,040
Take a look at the plates that make up the

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,319
Pacific.

34
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,780
Now look at where the eruptions and earthquakes
occur.

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,700
The Ring of Fire is the result of these plates
crashing into each other.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,580
"One in Japan, that's right. Fujiyama. There's some others in the south Pacific.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,360
How about in our part of the world?"

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,660
"Mexico." "That's right, there's several in Mexico."

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
The plates in the Pacific
are moving faster than other plates around

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,220
the world, adding stress where the plates interact.

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,200
This plate is moving northwest, crashing into
the North American plate, which explains all

42
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,580
the volcanoes here.

43
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,360
Over in California, the Pacific plate is grinding
past the North American Plate -- where they

44
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
meet is called the San Andreas Fault.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,329
The movement causes thousands of earthquakes
a year.

46
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,239
A few of them are even large enough to cause
serious damage.

47
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,709
Like the San Francisco-Oakland earthquake
in 1989, which killed 63 people and injured

48
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,860
nearly 4,000.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,340
All these plate interactions are independent

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,340
from each other.

51
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,180
But when grouped together, they make up the
most seismically active region in the world.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,320
"Remember a little while ago an island blew up and disappeared?" "Oh yeah."

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,100
"That was because of a volcano."

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,480
The problem with the Ring of Fire is that
geologists can’t accurately predict when

55
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,939
a volcano is going to erupt or an earthquake
will shake the ground.

56
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,359
They can monitor tremors, gas emissions and
temperature changes around a volcano to estimate

57
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,120
when it might erupt, but they can't be sure
of the exact timing or the severity.

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,459
And those predictions get even weaker with earthquakes
which aren't preceded by any warning signs,

59
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,560
so we can't even see them coming.

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,920
One way scientists forecast the future
of these phenomena is by looking at the past

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,220
-- take New Zealand for example:

62
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,200
Earthquakes have occured on this fault line
every 500 to 1,000 years.

63
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,810
There was a massive quake over 800 years ago
and another one around the 500 mark.

64
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,200
So scientists now believe New Zealand is due
for mega quake.

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,019
Over here in California, there is a 72% chance
of a major earthquake

66
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,979
along northern section of the San Andreas

67
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,518
faultline in the next 30 years.

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,520
Parts of Japan have a 25% chance of a big
quake and Seattle could see one in the next

69
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,970
50 years that could impact 7 million people.

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,740
In fact many countries along the Ring of Fire
will continue to be at risk for the foreseeable

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
future.

72
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,200
They can't get out of harm's way, but there
is something they can do about it.

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,880
In 2011, an earthquake and a following tsunami,
killed 15,000 people and caused $300 billion

74
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,480
in damages in Japan.

75
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,949
But those numbers could’ve been a lot higher.

76
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,570
See, Japan requires buildings be constructed
with anti-earthquake designs, like the one

77
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,440
in this video.

78
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,500
And it has an early warning system that stopped
high-speed trains, factory lines, and sent

79
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,210
countrywide text alerts a full minute before
the tremor hit.

80
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,840
While Japan’s precautions didn’t prevent
the disaster, they did save countless lives.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,680
The problem is, not every country in the Ring
of Fire is like Japan.

82
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,480
Most of these countries have some form of
anti-earthquake building code, but the quality

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,000
and implementation of these codes varies.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,700
And none of these countries have early warning
systems for earthquakes.

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,170
In developing countries, funding these projects
can be a problem.

86
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,190
But even richer countries aren’t taking
the risk seriously enough.

87
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,650
California, Oregon, Washington. Some of
the most vulnerable states in the US, still

88
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,700
don’t have a public early-warning system
in place.

89
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,500
Because volcanoes and earthquakes continue
to be unpredictable threats, governments tend

90
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,200
to treat them as a low priority.

91
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,400
And that's what makes the Ring of Fire even
more dangerous.

92
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,100
We know for certain that there will be more
natural disasters along this belt.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,300
What we don't know is if we'll be prepared
for them.

94
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,700
"Future studies will surely improve the clarity with which scientists view the interior of the Earth

95
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,540
and will help people accomodate their activities

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:00:00,000
to these powerful, sometimes destructive, often beneficial, always fascinating neighbors.
