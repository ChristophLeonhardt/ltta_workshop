today a report from Hollywood where people who get paid too much money to pretend to be someone they're not pretend to know about things they don't in order to alienate an audience they despise in the hopes of being paid too much money to pretend to be someone they're not to an audience they despise that's showbiz our story today is about Nick Adams of glad glad GL aad used to stand for gay and lesbian alliance against defamation until glad announced it was broadening its mission to include transgender people and issued a statement saying glad would no longer stand for anything but would just be a series of random letters that accidentally sounds like being happy but isn't Nick Adams of glads transgender media program is protesting what is he protesting he's protesting the fact that Hollywood movies about transgender women too often use straight male actors who dress up his women to portray men who dress up as women I know what you're thinking you're thinking Oh Andrew Andrew you sly devil how is it a man as physically alluring as yourself could Harbor the brilliant satirical intelligence that can Cox these overblown fantasies of leftist insanity in order to bring a little humor and light into our humdrum ordinary lives but no while it's true I am terribly attractive I am not actually making this up in an article for The Hollywood Reporter Nick Adams of random letters spelling glad writes quote in spite of the critical and commercial success of projects that put trans people front and center Hollywood is having a very difficult time letting go of the idea that putting a male actor in a dress wig and makeup is an accurate portrayal of a transgender woman unquote how true in what moral universe could it possibly be right to hire actors to portray people different than themselves do you think Matt Damon would have been hired to play Jason Bourne if he weren't really in amnesiac super assassin seeking to take down the CIA of course not that would be like hiring Sean Penn to play an intelligent man of integrity the audience simply wouldn't buy it in fact it was only Sean Penn's support of ago Chavez that gave Penn the credibility to play a retarded man in I am Sam but really when you think about it Nick Adams of random letters spelling glad is making a very serious point your average transgender woman isn't just some straight male actor wearing a dress wig and makeup he's probably never acted a day in his life he may not even be straight after all what straight man would walk around in a dress wig and makeup the whole idea is absurd Hollywood has got to realize that when a man declares he's a woman his opinion of himself has to be respected after all if he declared he was Napoleon we let him rule France wouldn't we of course we would it have to be better than whoever is doing it now and that's today's report from Hollywood where relevance is just a word that means irrelevance trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show okay guy glad somebody has time on his hands to protest that really mean nothing to anybody all right but you know there's a poem I can't remember which poem it is that has the line in it where every prospect pleases and only man is vile and I think he's written in i think the 19th century but he was describing Los Angeles because this place is beautiful the weather today is unbelievably great the traffic is so jammed up I walked we have to have to give a big hand to Taylor pain our makeup lady who did my makeup on the fly so if I look like the Joker from the one of the

it's gonna be tough alright so yesterday our friend Donald Trump who I think he's running for something right it's not just a businessman he's actually running for president as a Republican but yesterday he unveiled his child care plan he said his daughter Ivanka came to him and said daddy daddy you have to have a chuck and there's nothing I like better than a strong feminist woman shouting daddy daddy fact I think have a sexual fantasy like that but I I can't remember now maybe that's too much information but you have to have a child care plan we unleashed a child care plan and let's well let's hear just a little bit of what yet to say these solutions update laws passed on a half a century ago and also women we're still not in the labor force most of them or even close today nearly two and three mothers with young children have jobs for many families in our country childcare is now the single largest expense or take that even more so than house a very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area in my opponent has no child care plan she never will and if ever you also put lion it'll never get done anyway Oh Paul all right now first of all just in the interest of fairness that's actually not true Hillary Clinton has had a child care plan up even before she was running she had a child care plan up I mean a Democrat without a child care plan is like a day without sunshine you know Democrats have a child care plan they walk around with it in their wallet like teenagers with a condom you know they like they have their child care plan and hers is you know of course even more elaborate than Trump spec Trump is pretty elaborate he's going to rewrite the tax code allowing working parents to deduct from their income taxes for childcare expenses for up to four children as well as for elderly dependents there's an establishment of a dependent care savings account created to aid families set aside money to foster their children's development and offset elder care and the third part of the plan will address the federal regulations that currently discourage informal child care such as a mom watching our own kids the fourth part is that really the big one adds incentives for employers I'm sorry the fourth part adds incentive for employers to provide child child care at the workplace and it has the federal government is essentially guaranteeing for the first time six weeks of paid maternity leave and I believe Hillary Clinton's plan is 12 weeks for everybody to leave I think you have a baby your entire staff just disappears and takes care of this now the important thing about that obviously Trump has to do this he is polling very badly among women because he offends them cheats on them and treats them like garbage and somehow some of them don't like that I was always told that that's what they want it but that no no it turns out they won't vote for you if you do that and so he's under he's rolled out this thing and this is supposed to appeal to women and get it and and make people also think I mean partly it's because he's a Democrat he's a lifelong Democrat and he's a liberal and so this is what he's a point and and Charles Krauthammer said it best on the panel yesterday this was his reaction to the plan Trump himself as a man who brings up the deficit and the debt all the time as a sign of our decline of the sign of having government out of control and having in competence in government look I think this raises the question of how many Democratic parties does the country need we already have one and I thought during the primary season the argument for Trump was he was a guy who would stand up to the Washington Republican sold-out establishment that refused to stand up to Barack Obama on higher spending refused to stand up to him on entitlements refused to stand up to him on executive actions and therefore we needed an outsider a disruptor named Donald the Trump who would not do this what he is proposing is to out democrats the democrats this is an enormous new entitlement it will blow the debt and when he says the mandate he's going to mandate from washer isn't that the one thing the republicans all agree upon of the government stepping in and telling private industry what to do he says that will be paid for by taking out waste fraud and abuse from the unemployment insurance system if you believe that you will believe anything okay so now this is what makes the nevertrump errs like our friend Ben this is what makes never Trumper's crazy it's it's not so much that Trump is throwing in this Democrat plan because a lot of Republicans do that w through in that prescription medicine plan and all this it's that people are so devoted so many formerly conservative voices are so devoted to Donald Trump that they are signing on to whatever he did it is he does so Laura Ingraham a you know conservative voice for many many years Sean Hannity conservative voice for many many years who were tweeting when Bernie Sanders were running you know was running Laura Ingraham was tweeting oh she's gonna give everybody free childcare it's gonna be free free or she was making fun of him now suddenly she's kind of judiciously saying well we'll have to see where this is going to be paid for it's not gonna be paid for personal it's not gonna be an enact that if the if the Congress remains Republican but it's not going to be paid for because there's just no way to pay for these entitlements and the basic look the basic principle of conservatism the basic problem conservatism has with all these entitlement programs is not that we are heartless it's not that we don't care about working families and all this stuff it's that basically when you go to work every day and somebody gives you a check for the money for the work you did they are paying you for your time that is time taken out of your life that you put into working that you get money in return for for the government the idea of that is now you have transformed your time into money you can now spend that money and invest that money as you see fit that is the very nature of your free you know freedom actually has a lot less to do with who you sleep with then what how you spend your money and what you think and what you say and those are always the things that the government is trying to take away from you the government doesn't care who you sleep with that causes no problem for them whatsoever they care what you say and they care how you spend your money conservatives simply believe that if you earn the money it's yours and the government has a right to take it away from you to pay for the common defense maybe to pay for a couple of roads here and there I'm not so sure about that but not to give it to somebody else not to say oh well you know you want to use your money to pay Giuseppe to cooking pasta but no you can't do that we want to use your money to pay someone else to take care of someone else's child it's just a basic basic conservative principle that the government does not have the right to do that it's not in the Constitution so the government does the federal government doesn't have the right to do it whether the state governments do is a whole other question and certainly whether independent entities who want to create charities to do it obviously that is the the best conservative idea because remember and the reason Republicans think this reason conservatives think Lee sorry the reason conservatives think this is the government is never selling it's always buying it is never giving you freedom it is always taking power this is true whether you're gay or whether you're black and they saying to you we're giving you the power by through our through the Supreme Court we're giving you the power to marry they're not they're taking away from you the power to decide and giving it to five guys in Washington who weren't elected by anybody who suddenly are making laws for the country which is completely unconstitutional they're always taking power they're never giving freedom never so anything that the federal government does is meant to expand the federal government and it does the intentions may be good some people believe oh you know I'm really helping out I get it but that's the road to hell so what so what they're never Trumper's are saying and what never Trump your problem Trumper's problem is is that this is taking the conservative movement and moving it to the left this is taking our sean hannity's and our Laura Ingram's and our Dennis Prager and taking them out of the right and putting into the left as they follow Trump down this rabbit hole and which is going to continue to get bigger all the time because this is who Trump is you know Trump is following his nature so what they are saying is it might even be better if Hillary if we had to endure the tear the admittedly terrible presidency of Hillary Clinton while we rebuild a conservative movement and remember movements thrive when they have an enemy so you have Hillary Clinton in office people gathering around what's wrong with what she's doing when Hillary Clinton says i'm going to give you child care suddenly sean hannity and laura ingraham i'm going to rediscover what it is they oppose about health about child care and they're going to go after her so that's the idea that the nevertrump is are saying it's going to be easier to rebuild the conservative movement with a hillary in office no matter how bad she is then with Trump who's going to not only take the country to the left but he's going to take the conservative movement with it and that's what the nevertrump purrs are saying and I will tell you what I think in just a minute but first I have to say goodbye to everybody on facebook and youtube come over to the daily wire and hear the rest and subscribe darn you
