it's a little bit humorous when you look
at the exaggeration the disconnect that
is existing between the public relations
firms in these big corporations who are
trying to kind of you know include
include you know Christmas Ramadan
different religious occasions they're
trying to be very much involved the kind
they're trying to address their consumer
on a personal level where some but at
the end of the day sometimes it's a big
fluke it's a it's just very much
disconnected from what actually is going
on and know they're not useful at all to
I could say 99% of the ladies who are
waking up first so it's actually very
laughable
