00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:01,828
PRETTY INTERESTING, ADD.

00:00:01,828 --> 00:00:03,230
I A FEELING.

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,500
RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF CRITICISM

LET'S BRING IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:21,949
SPOKESPERSON.

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,350
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US.

16
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,551
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON ME

17
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:24,818
ON.

18
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:25,886
>> Shannon: I WANT TO PLAY

19
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:26,787
SOMETHING OF THE PRESIDENT HAD

20
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:28,489
TO SAY ABOUT THE SECOND ACCUSER

21
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,791
WHO CAME FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT

22
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:31,258
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

23
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:32,092
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID AND WE'LL

24
00:00:32,092 --> 00:00:34,128
TALK ABOUT REACTIONS.

25
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:36,730
>> IT MAY NOT BE HIM, THERE WERE

26
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,600
GAPS, SHE SAID SHE WAS TOTALLY

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,635
INEBRIATED, AND SHE WAS ALL

28
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,803
MESSED UP, AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW

29
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:43,837
IT WAS HIM BUT THAT MIGHT HAVE

30
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,773
BEEN HIM.

31
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:47,174
OH, GEE, LET'S NOT MAKE IT MAY

32
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,209
SUPREME COURT JUDGE.

33
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:51,378
>> Shannon: A COUPLE OF

34
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:52,179
WOMEN'S GROUPS,

35
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,113
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND NARAL,

36
00:00:53,113 --> 00:00:54,148
THEY SAY "STATEMENTS LIKE THIS

37
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,783
WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE

38
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,351
UNITED STATES ARE DANGEROUS AND

39
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:57,785
IRRESPONSIBLE.

40
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,353
NARAL SANK DONALD TRUMP'S

41
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:01,155
ATTACKS ON MS. RAMIREZ ARE

42
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,022
DISGUSTING AND COWARDLY.

43
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,025
HE'S BEEN VERY DISCIPLINED ON

44
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:06,093
TALKING ABOUT THESE ACCUSERS.

45
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:07,828
TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE HE WAS A

46
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:08,729
LITTLE BIT MORE FORCEFUL IN WHAT

47
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:09,530
HE HAD TO SAY.

48
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,932
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE REACTIONS?

49
00:01:11,932 --> 00:01:13,634
>> I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE

50
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,202
THOSE STATEMENTS ARE FROM

51
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:16,103
MS. RAMIREZ HERSELF.

52
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:17,271
SHE HERSELF SAID THAT SHE WAS SO

53
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:18,839
INEBRIATED THAT SHE WAS LYING ON

54
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,742
THE FLOOR IN A FOG, SLURRING HER

55
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:22,943
WORDS, IT TOOK HER SIX DAYS

56
00:01:22,943 --> 00:01:27,581
WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS TO EVEN

57
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,984
REMEMBER THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT.

58
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:31,151
SHE ADMITS THERE WERE

59
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,988
SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE STORY.

60
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:34,688
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED

61
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:35,756
THAT MS. RAMIREZ WAS CALLING HER

62
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:38,892
YALE CLASSMATES TO SEE IF THEY

63
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:39,927
REMEMBER THE INCIDENT.

64
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:40,661
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REFUSED TO

65
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:43,964
RUN THE STORY BECAUSE THEY

66
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,566
"CALLED DOZENS" OF PEOPLE TO

67
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,433
ATTEMPT TO CORROBORATE THE

68
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:48,736
STORY, UNLIKE THE NEW YORKER,

69
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,137
AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO IT

70
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:50,838
BY "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WOULD

71
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:53,474
ENTHRONE THE STORY.

72
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:58,112
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS JUST

73
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:58,846
REPEATING WHAT MS. RAMIREZ SAID

74
00:01:58,846 --> 00:01:59,280
ABOUT HERSELF.

75
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,847
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT

76
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:00,448
CONTINUED CALLS FOR THE

77
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:01,782
WHITE HOUSE TO AUTHORIZE OR ASK

78
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:03,884
RASPY FBI TO GO AHEAD AND DO AN

79
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:05,252
ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO

80
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:05,686
THESE THINGS?

81
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:07,354
PEOPLE ARE POINTING BACK TO THE

82
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,457
BUSH WHITE HOUSE DURING THE

83
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:10,124
ANITA HILL, CLARENCE THOMAS

84
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:11,058
HEARINGS, SAYING THEY ASKED FOR

85
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:13,928
A HEARING AND TO THAT POINT,

86
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:14,762
"THE WASHINGTON POST" HAD A

87
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:17,098
PIECE OUT, "AS FOR KAVANAUGH, HE

88
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:18,232
MIGHT ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM AN

89
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:19,400
FBI INVESTIGATION.

90
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,568
WITHOUT ONE, HE WILL ALWAYS HAVE

91
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:22,203
A CLOUD OVER HIS HEAD."

92
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:23,471
THEY WENT OUT TO TALK ABOUT THE

93
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,372
FACT THAT HE COULD BENEFIT AND

94
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:26,274
CLEAR HIS OWN NAME IF THEY HAD

95
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,475
AN INDEPENDENT BODY LIKE THE FBI

96
00:02:27,475 --> 00:02:28,542
LOOK INTO THIS.

97
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:29,677
WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE CHANGE

98
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:30,177
POSITION ON THAT?

99
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:31,679
>> I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE

100
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,380
JOE BIDEN ON THIS ONE.

101
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,849
LET'S GO BACK TO 1991 WHERE HE

102
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,585
VERY FORCEFULLY TOLD

103
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,153
CLARENCE THOMAS, WHO IS IN A

104
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:40,588
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, THAT FBI

105
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:41,522
CLEARANCE AND BACKGROUND

106
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:42,623
CHECKS -- THAT IS WHAT WE ARE

107
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:46,127
TALKING ABOUT -- THEY ARE NOT

108
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:46,527
CONCLUSIVE.

109
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:47,595
THEY PRESENT WHAT HE SAID, WHAT

110
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:48,596
SHE SAID, AND THAT IS AT.

111
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:50,031
THAT IS WHAT THE FBI HAS DONE

112
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:50,331
HERE.

113
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:54,302
IN FACT THEY HAVE CONDUCTED SIX

114
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:54,836
INVESTIGATIONS, SIX

115
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:57,138
CLEARANCES, SIX BACKGROUND

116
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,673
CHECKS ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH SINCE

117
00:02:58,673 --> 00:02:58,973
1993.

118
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,175
THAT COVERED HIS TIME AT YALE,

119
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:03,978
THIS ALLEGATION EVER EMERGED.

120
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:04,746
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

121
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:05,780
IS DOING THEIR JOB.

122
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,648
THEY ARE HOLDING THIS HEARING.

123
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,116
THEY WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM

124
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:08,450
OF THIS.

125
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,018
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO GET

126
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:10,819
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

127
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,522
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, AS HE HAS

128
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:15,657
REPEATEDLY STATED, IS ANXIOUS TO

129
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:18,326
CLEAR HIS NAME, WHICH IS WHY HE

130
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:20,328
EVEN CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW JUST

131
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,095
TODAY WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY

132
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,298
COMMITTEE UNDER PENALTY -- UNDER

133
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:24,799
OATH -- WHICH IS A SUBJECT OR

134
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,835
CRIMINAL PENALTIES IF HE WAS

135
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:27,168
LYING.

136
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:27,902
HE EMPHATICALLY TOLD THEM THAT

137
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:32,140
HE DID NOT DO WHAT MS. RAMIREZ

138
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,907
IS ALLEGING THAT HE DID.

139
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:34,909
>> Shannon: OF COURSE HE DID A

140
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,010
PUBLIC INTERVIEW WITH

141
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,711
MARTHA MacCALLUM, PLAYED A LOT

142
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,379
OF THAT LESSON INTELLECTUAL.

143
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,914
THE AP REACTION SAYS AFTER THE

144
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:41,115
INTERVIEW AIRED, THE SENSE OF

145
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:42,450
THE WEST WING WAS RELIEVED THAT

146
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,018
KAVANAUGH WAS ABLE TO PRESENT AN

147
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:47,055
IMAGE TO COUNTER THE ALLEGATION

148
00:03:47,055 --> 00:03:47,455
ALLEGATIONS.

149
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:51,793
YET THEY WERE CONCERNS AMONG

150
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:53,962
AIDES AND TRUMP ABOUT HOW

151
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,864
KAVANAUGH WOULD HOLD UP FACING

152
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:56,731
FIERCER QUESTIONING FROM

153
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:57,098
DEMOCRATS.

154
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,800
WE IMAGINE IT WILL GET FEISTY.

155
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,834
ANY ADVICE OR TAKE IT WAS HER

156
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,736
LAST NIGHT AS HE PREPS FOR

157
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,103
THURSDAY?

158
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:06,374
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE

159
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,375
COMFORT IN THE MANY, MANY PEOPLE

160
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,109
FROM ACROSS THIS COUNTRY

161
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:09,611
WHO HAVE COME OUT IT ON HIS

162
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,612
BEHALF.

163
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:11,680
THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE IN

164
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,848
WASHINGTON, D.C., A FEW DAYS AGO

165
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:14,916
WHERE CLOSE TO 100 WOMEN WHO

166
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,985
PERSONALLY KNOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH

167
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,220
SPOKE TO HIS INCREDIBLE

168
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,786
TREATMENT OF WOMEN.

169
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:21,123
THIS INCLUDED PAST HIGH SCHOOL

170
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,024
GIRLFRIENDS, THIS INCLUDED

171
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,360
FORMER STAFF, FORMER COLLEAGUES,

172
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,129
THERE ARE SO MANY LETTERS

173
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:27,729
SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE

174
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:28,997
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON HIS

175
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:30,065
BEHALF FROM THESE WOMEN AND SO

176
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:31,066
MANY OTHERS.

177
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:33,168
THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS WELL --

178
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:35,370
LOVED BY SO MANY.

179
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,772
HE HAS IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS,

180
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:38,440
HE IS AN INCREDIBLE REPUTATION,

181
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,276
AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE

182
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:43,145
QUALIFIED HUMAN BEING TO BE OUR

183
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:43,879
NEXT SUPREME COURT SUPREME COURT

00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,212
JUSTICE.

185
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:44,913
>> Shannon: THE PUBLIC WILL

186
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:47,349
GET A LOOK AT BOTH HE AND DR.

187
00:04:47,349 --> 00:00:00,000
DR. FORD ON THURSDAY IF SHE
