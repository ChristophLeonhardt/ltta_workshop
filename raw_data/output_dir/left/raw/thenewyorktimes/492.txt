1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,740
MONA: This is Sana, the capital of Yemen.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:17,680
Now in the grip of sectarian fighting, that most recently left more than 130 dead in a suicide bombing.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,180
The violence was inflamed when Houthi rebels, an insurgent group that most people never even heard of

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,900
seized full control of the city in January.

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,300
MAN: Who do you work for?

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,220
MONA: The New York Times

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,880
MAN: So... you're going to call this a coup then.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,620
MONA: Frankly, I’m not exactly sure what to call this: a coup, an uprising, a revolution?

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,420
But when the Houthis took over, the president resigned. Now the country is leaderless and divided.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,680
By the way, this is me. I am Mona El-Naggar and I came here during the  Houthi takeover

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,520
As you can see, I’m dressed in a black abaya to blend in.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,580
But I’m still a woman, reporting on the street, at a time when few people understand what is really happening here.

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,200
Am I allowed to shoot, or not?

14
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,820
So I negotiated access where I could, but
mostly I just went with it.

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,540
CHANT: Death to America!

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,940
Death to Israel.

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,540
Damnation to the Jews.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,180
Victory to Islam.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,340
MONA: That chant is aggressive, I know,

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,380
and the guns are definitely intimidating.

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,900
But let me explain.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,440
The Houthis, a Shiite sect, also distance themselves from Sunni terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS.

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,140
They are critical of the United States,

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,380
but they told me what they’re really angry about, are the American-backed dictators in the region.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,480
Wait a second.

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,220
This is a good place to explain something.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,200
You see that bulge in this guy’s cheek? That’s khat.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,940
It’s a plant Yemenis have chewed for thousands of years.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,480
It's a mild stimulant, kind of like drinking a couple of Red Bulls.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,320
Trust me, you’ll see it everywhere.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,300
OK, back to the Houthis.

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,620
The Houthis are popular now, but they’re mostly young and untested.

33
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,160
They’re trying to consolidate their power, but most Yemenis have more immediate problems.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,800
The country is the poorest in the
Arab world

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,780
and the government can’t meet basic needs. 

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,180
There’s a shortage of cooking fuel and electricity, and unemployment runs high.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,820
But water, to be sure, is everyone’s worry.

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,180
Some forecasters say Yemen will be the first

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,160
country to run out.

40
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,740
In some areas, water flows
from the tap only once a month

41
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,340
so families need to stock up. They do it with these cans.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,000
And the cans are absolutely everywhere.

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,820
And remember khat? Well, growing it is
a one of the biggest drains on the water supply.

44
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,100
The shortage is so critical that people have
given up on their government.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,080
They are sinking their own wells and selling water from tanker trucks throughout the city.

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,280
My daughter brings water home in a wheelbarrow.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,440
A child should be able to get an education

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,860
not get water and work.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,700
But we don't have a choice.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,180
And those frustrations are written all over
the walls of Sana.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,600
Poverty, political dysfunction, terrorism …

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,760
This street artist, Mourad Sobai,
told me the Houthis can’t address these 

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,960
issues without a cohesive state. His latest
piece uses this ancient Yemeni symbol to call

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,460
for unity. But in today’s reality, that symbolism can get lost.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,740
PASSERBY: We asked about this, and people told us it was filled with explosives.

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,320
[LAUGHTER]

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,800
But the Houthis are trying to bring people
together, although they're doing it on their own terms.

58
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
They hosted this convention to discuss what’s next for Yemen

59
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,940
inviting tribal leaders, military commanders, professionals — just about anyone.

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,960
MONA: So there are two entrances?
GUARD: Yes.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
MONA: What are they?
GUARD: One for women and one for journalists.

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,980
MONA: So... where should I go?

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,320
GUARD: With the women.

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,660
Inside the stadium, the turnout was impressive.

65
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,480
SPEAKER: This is the people's revolution!

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,100
MONA: But to me, it also felt scattered.

67
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,540
SPEAKER: The nation is not a toy in the hand of politicians!

68
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,980
As I listened to speakers ramble on from the
podium, I wondered how an event like this

69
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,080
could possibly translate to any real governance.

70
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,460
And with opposition building, I don’t know
if Houthis, like this guy, have any idea what

71
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,040
they’re really up against.

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,380
MONA: What weapons do you have?

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,380
MAN: A grenade.

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,880
MONA: A grenade?

75
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,360

00:04:41,820 --> 00:00:00,000
For now, here's more.
