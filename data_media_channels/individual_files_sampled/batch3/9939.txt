Sean: JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION TO TONIGHT'S OPENING BREAKING NEWS, JOE DIGENOVA, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR ANDREW McCARTHY, AND OF COURSE HE WRITES FOR THE NATIONAL REVIEW, ALSO. THE SMARTEST PERSON I KNOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO, STRZOK GOES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND SAYS HE'S GOING TO TALK, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE IT. I THINK HE SOUNDS LIKE HE'S ONE OF THESE GUYS THAT THINKS HE CAN GO INTO THE ROOM AND KIND OF CONTROL THE ROOM. HOROWITZ SAID HE HAD VERY INVOLVED ANSWERS, SO HE MAY JUST AND IT DO OKAY. HE'S GOT REASONS TO THINK THAT. BECAUSE IN A COURT ROOM, WHERE THERE IS A JUDGE, SOMEBODY CAN'T GET AWAY WITH JUST GIVING THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY AND THEN SAYING, WHEN YOU TRY TO CROSS-EXAMINE HIM, NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS, OR INVESTIGATIVE INTEGRITY. STORY, NOW THEY GET TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE HARD STUFF. IN A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING, THEY CAN DODGE THAT STUFF, THEY GET AWAY WITHOUT ALL THE TIME. I HAVE SOME FAITH WITH A FEW OF THE CONGRESSMEN THERE. YOU KNOW, ONE THING YOU SAID, IT STILL STICKS WITH ME. SO MANY OF MY MY MOM WAS A PRISON GUARD, MY DAD WORKED IN FAMILY COURT PROBATION. MY COUSINS WERE ON THE NYPD. THE TWO COUSINS WERE COPS. THEY BEGAN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WHICH I WOULD ARGUE RENDERS IT ILLEGITIMATE FROM THE GET-GO. THIS IS THE GUY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, AND AS I SAID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS, JAMES COMEY WAS A DIRTY COP. MR. STRZOK IS DIRTIER. HE'S GOING TO GO IN TOMORROW AND HE IS GOING TO LIVE. HE'S GOING TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS THAT ARE UNTRUTHFUL. ABOUT PRESIDENT OR CANDIDATE TRUMP. HE CAN'T WIN, CAN HE? HE CAN'T HAVE HIM AS PRESIDENT. NOW HE IS CLAIMING THAT THERE IS AN EXPLANATION FOR HER, WE WILL STOP HIM. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIKE YOU ARE TO PEOPLE I WOULDN'T WANT TO MESS WITH IN COURT ROOM. I KIND OF AGREE BUT THEN THERE IS THE INSURANCE POLICY. THEN THERE IS A LOATHSOME HUMAN BEING. THEN THERE ARE THE ACTIONS. NOW IT'S REAL. AND THERE ARE SOME SUPERIOR BELIEVE THAT HE'S DOING IT FROM NOBLE CAUSES, BUT REALLY, HE IS ALMOST ATTEMPTING A COUP, BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS GUILTY OF CRIMES THAT HE PUSHES UNDER THE RUG. THEY GO FULL FORCE SLEDGEHAMMER ON THE OTHER CANDIDATE. AT THAT TO ME IS INFLUENCING AN ELECTION AND COLLUSION. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS. THIS IS NOT A COMPLICATED CASE. AT THE FBI OF THE SENIOR LEVELS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, LORETTA LYNCH AND ALL HER MINIONS HAD TWO GOALS IN MIND. VERY SIMPLE, VERY PLAIN. EXONERATE HILLARY CLINTON ILLEGALLY AND IF SHE LOCKED STOMACH LOST THE ELECTION, THAT'S IT. IN A NUTSHELL IT'S NEVER CHANGED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE TEXT MESSAGES, THE IG REPORTS, HAS PROVEN CONCLUSIVELY AND THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE WANTED TO DO. AND IT WON'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE WERE TWO INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME, AND WHETHER YOU ARE A LIBERAL OR DEMOCRATIC, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LOOK AT THEM AND SAY THE SAME QUALITY OF JUSTICE WAS ACCORDED TO BOTH. THE LAW. EQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW, IN OUR CONSTITUTION. THE BIGGEST MOST OBVIOUS CASE OF OBSTRUCTION, THEY MADE EVERY CONSIDERATION. THREAD EVERY NEEDLE, EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WENT TO JAIL. PROTOCOL, FOUR TIMES USING BOUGHT AND PAID FOR POLITICAL RESEARCH. ON ONE SIDE OF THE COIN WITH HILLARY, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY BENT OVER BACKWARDS TO NOT MAKE THE CASE. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE OF A CRIME, IT SEEMS THAT THEY SCORCHED THE EARTH TO TRY TO STOP THIS PRESIDENCY. Sean: THAT TO ME IS A IS A TENT AN ATTEMPT AT BYPASSING THE DEEPER THAN ANYTHING WE WOULD IMAGINE WITH WATERGATE AND WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO DOJ A WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO DOJ D WHAT THE FBI AND THE DO DOJ T SUBVERSION. THEY SOUGHT TO SUBVERT AN ELECTION, AND WHEN THE PERSON THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT GOT THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER, AND EVEN THOUGH PETER STRZOK IS TESTIFYING THE CIA DIRECTOR IN COOPERATION WITH CLAPPER. NONE OF THIS WILL BE FAIR UNLESS BOTH OF THEM FIND THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY. I THINK YOU WILL HAVE A LOT TO SAY TOMORROW BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, BUT I WILL LET THE TEXT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. SHOULD THEY RELEASE THE TRANSCRIPT? CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO MAKE THAT. I ASSUME THEY ARE ASKING QUESTIONS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT INTO CLASSIFIED MATTERS, BUT I THINK OFTEN DO? WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH THINK JIM JORDAN'S THAT HE REGARDS THIS AS STEP NUMBER ONE. SO IT'S STEP ONE AND THEN WILL BE A PUBLIC HEARING. I THINK THESE PEOPLE WILL GO TO JAIL AND ITS WORST ABUSE OF POWER WE'VE EVER SEEN.
