Waring is it is a the tool of language swearing is something that people have and no one can used and it's not just something that people use because they can't think of any other words my name is Richard Stevens I'm a psychologist based at Keele University in Staffordshire and I wrote a book called black sheep written benefits of being bad so a lot of people kind of have this idea that swearing is a sign of low IQ and inarticulate nough spiegel swear almost because they can't think of any other words and say what if you think about do that like that doesn't really stand up to scrutiny and a really neat study done in the States in year two ago they look at the sort of the relationship between people's general language ability and they're swearing ability now it's quite interesting how you assess these things to view a psychologist so to assess general language fluency we use the test called the SAS test how many words can you think of in a minute beginning with the last set and rirs and these psychologists kind of devised this alternative version called the swearing fluency test which is how many swear words can you think of in a minute different swear words and when they got people to do those tacks interestingly they found the people that knew them of swear words also had the best general language ability so it suggests that you know swearing is something that people have and no one can use and it's not just something that people use because I can't think of any other words
