CALIFORNIA IN TROUBLE, THAT MESSAGE FROM THE SON OF THE LATE REV. BILLY GRAHAM ON A 10 STOP TOUR. FRANKLIN GRAHAM URGING VOTERS TO PUSH ESTATE BLUE WALL AHEAD OF THE CRUCIAL PRIMARY. ARE EVANGELICALS THE KEY TO TURNING THE STATE RED? PASTOR ROBERT JEFFERS, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, APPRECIATE IT. THIS 10 STOP TOUR IS GOING ON SINCE MAY 5TH. HE CONTINUES THIS UNTIL JUNE 5TH IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PRIMARY COMING UP NEXT WEEK BUT YOU SAY IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT PARTISAN POLITICS. THAT'S RIGHT. FRANKLIN HAS TWO GOALS. FIRST HE WANTS CHRISTIANS TO GET OUT AND VOTE NOT NECESSARILY ALONG PARTY LINES BUT ACCORDING TO THEIR BIBLICAL BELIEFS AND THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. JOHN J, THE FIRST CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT SAID GOD HAS GIVEN US THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING OUR LEADERS WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO VOTE BUT THE SECOND GOAL OF THIS CRUSADE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT IS INTRODUCE PEOPLE TO JESUS CHRIST WAS I BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY WE WILL CHANGE AMERICA IS BY CHANGING THE HEARTS OF AMERICANS. NO POLITICAL PARTY CAN DO THAT. ONLY THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST CAN TRANSFORM A PERSON OF LIFE. THE 20 CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY, IT IS A BIG VOTING BLOC IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO TURN OUT, 20% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE EVANGELICAL. THAT IS RIGHT. IN 2016 ONLY 13% OF THOSE TURNED OUT, THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM. IT IS INTERESTING HE IS BACK IN CALIFORNIA. BILLY GRAHAM BEGAN HIS MINISTRY IN 1949 AND 70 YEARS LATER HIS SON IS RETURNING. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT STATE. OF THE 20 SPEAKING OF AN IMPORTANT STATE FOR DONALD TRUMP, TEXAS, ALWAYS RAISES THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY, THE JOINT FUNDRAISING EVENT FOR THE MIDTERMS, HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN AND YOU ARE GOING TO BE THERE. I WILL BE DELIVERING THE PRAYER IN DALLAS WHEN THE PRESIDENT COMES. HE IS GOING TO HAVE AN ENTHUSIASTIC RESPONSE. 60% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION UNDER DONALD TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, THAT IS THE HIGHEST RIGHT TRACK OF DIRECTION SINCE 2007 AND THEY LIKE WHAT HE IS DOING WITH THE ECONOMY AND IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY BUT ALSO A RELIGIOUS CITY FILLED WITH EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS, PEOPLE OF THE JEWISH FAITH, THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MANY PEOPLE TURN OUT TODAY WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM. DALLAS AND HOUSTON. MANY OF THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH AT YOUR CHURCH IN TERMS OF THE RUSSIA COLLUSION STORY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THEY BELIEVE THERE IS NO COLLUSION, OVER AND DONE WITH. I TOLD THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY, ONE PERSON I TALKED TO EVER ASKED ABOUT RUSSIA. THEY REALIZE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE AND THAT IS WHY THE MIDTERM ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT. THE GOAL BY THE OPPOSITION IS TO EITHER IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT OR IMPEDE HIS AGENDA FROM BEING FULFILLED. NEITHER IS AN ACCEPTABLE CHOICE. DONALD TRUMP IS LEADING THE COUNTRY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, I BELIEVE HE WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND IF WE WENT TO SEE THIS CONTINUED IT IS
