WE REALLY GET IT. 
WE LOVE YOU, WE'LL ALWAYS BE

WE'LL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING

>> OVER THE LAST YEAR, I.C.E. 
AND CBC OBTAINED 200 MILLION 
POUNDS OF ELICIT AND DEADLY 
NARCOTICS. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
DIED. 
IN THE INTERIOR OF OUR COUNTRY, 
I.C.E. 
OFFICERS ARRESTED 127,000 
CRIMINAL ALIENS AND THESE ARE 
TOUGH ONES, TOO, AREN'T THEY, 
FELLOWS, RIGHT. 
THESE WERE TOUGH ONES, 
INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED OR 
CONVICTED OF 48,000 ASSAULTS, 
12,000 SEX CRIMES AND 1800 
HOMICIDES. 
WE NEED STRONG PEOPLE TO HANDLE 
THOSE PEOPLE. 
WE DON'T PLAY GAMES, RIGHT. 
WE DON'T PLAY GAMES. 
EVERY DAY ON AVERAGE, CBC 
PREVENTS TEN KNOWN OR SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS FROM ENTERING THE 
UNITED STATES. 
WHAT A JOB YOU'VE DONE. 
TO PROTECT OUR NATION FROM 
SMUGGLING, TRAFFICKING, DRUGS, 
CRIME, THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 
DHS, ARE BUILDING THE BORDER 
WALL AS WE SIT, AND THE WALL IS 
GETTING LONGER AND TALLER AND 
STRONGER EACH AND EVERY DAY, 
WE'VE SPENT AND WILL SOON BE 
SPENDING ABOUT $3.2 BILLION AND 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ABOUT $5 
BILLION FOR THIS NEXT COMING 
YEAR. 
WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL. 
STEP BY STEP AND IT'S NOT EASY. 
WE HAVE A LITTLE OPPOSITION 
CALLED THE DEMOCRATS, I GUESS 
THEY DON'T MIND CRIME. 
IT'S PRETTY SAD. 
JUST THIS PAST MONTH, CBC 
OFFICERS AT A SINGLE PORT OF 
ENTRY DISCOVERED MORE THAN 
30,000 FENTANYL PILLS, 62-POUND 
OF METH. 
THAT'S A LOT. 
AND 11 POUNDS OF HEROIN. 
TWO OF THOSE OFFICERS ARE HERE. 
ALFREDO AFATO, AND DAVID 
SCIATONO.
STAND UP, PLEASE.
AND ALFREDO, DAVID, THANK YOU 
FOR THE AMAZING JON YOU HAVE 
DONE. 
WE ALL APPRECIATE IT. 
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM, 
EVERYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY, ST 
OVER A WEEK AGO, HUMAN SMUGGLER 
WAS ARRESTED IN LAREDO FOR 
LOCKING AND REALLY LOCKING A 
HORRIBLE 78 ILLEGAL ALIENS 
INSIDE OF A TRAILER. 
THE BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO 
CAUGHT THE ACCUSED AND LIKELY 
REALLY SAVED MANY LIVES, HE'S 
HERE WITH US, AND ADRIAN, 
WHERE'S ADRIAN. 
ADRIAN'S HERE WITH US. 
THANK YOU, ADRIAN. 
GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU. 
IT'S A LOT OF LIVES. 
THAT'S GREAT. 
COME HERE, I WANT TO ASK YOU A 
QUESTION. 
SO HOW DID YOU, COME HERE, 
YOU'RE NOT NERVOUS, RIGHT. 
SPEAKS PERFECT ENGLISH. 
COME HERE, I WANT TO ASK YOU 
ABOUT THAT, 78 LIVES. 
YOU SAVED78 PEOPLE. 
SO HOW DID YOU FEEL THAT THERE 
WERE PEOPLE IN THAT TRAILER, 
PLEASE?HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS 
GOING TO DO THIS. 
IT'S JUST OF INTEREST. 
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR 
ALLOWING ME TO COME. 
ON BEHALF OF BORDER PATROL, 
THANK YOU AS WELL. 
IT ALL STARTED THAT DAY, I HAD 
A ALERT, VEHICLE WAS REFERRED 
TO SECONDARY, AND TRACTOR-
TRAILER WAS REFERRED TO 
SECONDARY, THE VEHICLE 
PROCEEDED TO ELUDE AND FLEE THE 
CHECK POINT. 
SHORTLY AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS 
STOPPED AT THE 30-MILE MARKER, 
A MILE SUPPORT OF THE CHECK 
POINT. 
SUBSEQUENTLY, I WENT OUT THERE 
AND I RAN THE DOG, CONDUCTED A 
NON INTRUSIVE SEARCH OF THE 
VEHICLE, TRACTOR-TRAILER, AND 
THE K-9 ALERTED AND 
SUBSEQUENTLY, I OPENED THE LOW 
LATCH OF THE BACK OF THE 
TRACTOR-TRAILER AND REVEALED A 
LOT OF SUBJECTS. 
I QUICKLY ASKED FOR BACK UP AND 
BACK UP GOT THERE, AND THE 
SUBJECTS WERE TRANSPORTED BACK 
TO THE CHECK POINT, AND ALL OF 
THEM WERE IN GOOD HEALTH. 
>> FANTASTIC JOB. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WHAT A GOOD JOB HE DID. 
WHAT A GOOD JOB. 
NOW, YOU KNOW TOMORROW, HE'S 
GOING TO BE, HE'S LIKE THAT SO 
MUCH, HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS 
GOING TO DO THAT. 
TOMORROW HE WILL BE ANNOUNCING 
THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE. 
GOOD JOB. 
78 PEOPLE SAFE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ADRIAN. 
>> LAST MONTH UNDER OPERATION 
EAGLE SHIELD, RIGHT HERE IN THE 
D. C. AREA, I.C.E. 
OFFICERS ARRESTED 132 ILLEGAL 
ALIENS, INCLUDING CRIMINAL 
ALIENS, CHARGED WITH RAPE, 
BATTERY, AND STRANGULATION. 
AMONG THOSE ARRESTED WAS A HIGH 
RANKING MS13 GANG MEMBER WHO 
HAS FOUR PRIOR CONVICTIONS OR 
RAPE AND FEDERAL WARRANT FOR 
FELONY ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY 
WEAPON. 
BAD, BAD PERSON. 
ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL 
OFFICERS, DANIEL NICHOLS AND 
MARK KALAZO, TOGETHER WITH 
NANCY ROTO, EACH PLAYED A 
CRUCIAL ROLE. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU 
OFFICERS, AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE 
HERE. 
WHERE ARE YOU, PLEASE, STAND 
UP. 
STAND UP. 
GREAT JOB. 
YOU DID A GREAT JOB. 
RIGHT HERE. 
NANCY, YOU WANT TO SAY 
SOMETHING, COME ON UP HERE, THE 
THREE OF YOU. 
I FIND LISTENING TO THESE 
FOLKS, THEY'RE VERY BRAVE. 
I FIND THEM A LOT MORE 
INTERESTING THAN LISTENING TO 
THE PRESIDENT. 
COME ON UP HERE. 
COME ON UP. 
>> THANK YOU, MR.  PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU, IT'S AN HONOR 
WORKING FOR IMMIGRATION AND 
CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. 
WE'RE HERE TO SERVE AND PROTECT 
OUR NATION, AND WE'RE PROUD TO 
DO IT EVERY DAY. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
HELLO, MY NAME IS MARK COLAZO, 
I WORK FOR THE WASHINGTON FIELD 
OFFICE, AND WHAT WE DO IS MAKE 
EVERYONE SAFE AND PROTECT 
EVERYBODY. 
THAT'S WHAT MY JOB IS. 
I WANTED TO COME OUT AND 
COMMEMORATE, AND GIVE THANKS. 
THANK YOU. 
>> GREAT PEOPLE. 
BRAVE PEOPLE. 
I.C.E.'S OPERATION MATADOR 
RECENTLY LED TO THE ARREST OF 
325 MEMBERS OF MS13, A VICIOUS, 
VIOLENT, HORRIBLE GANG, 
HORRIBLE GROUP OF PEOPLE. 
AND WE'RE THROWING THEM THE 
HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY SO 
FAST, YOUR HEAD WOULD SPIN, BUT 
TOO MANY WERE ALLOWED IN. 
>> SPECIAL AGENT DEREK BERGMAN 
WHO HELPED LEAD THE OPERATION 
IS HERE. 
YOU'RE A BRAVE LOOKING GUY. 
HURRY UP, DEREK. 
COME ON. 
>> I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS, BUT 
I GUESS I WOULD SAY THAT, YOU 
KNOW, AT OPERATION MATADOR, WE 
HAD, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF 
VIOLENCE ON LONG ISLAND AND THE 
NEW YORK AREA, SO THE RESPONSE 
STARTED REALLY WITH THE 
LEADERSHIP THAT SUPPORTED US 
AND WAS ABLE TO ALLOW US TO GO 
OUT THERE AND DO WHAT WE HAD TO 
DO, AND IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THAT WE 
HAVE WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL 
PARTNERS AND OTHER FEDERAL 
AGENCIES THAT EVERYBODY WAS 
ABLE TO GET TOGETHER AND ASSIST 
EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT FACETS 
OF THE OPERATION AND HOPEFULLY 
WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
IN THE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE 
THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHY WE WERE 
DOING IT WAS TO MAKE THOSE 
NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE FOR THE 
PEOPLE THAT INHABIT THEM. 
HOPEFULLY WE WERE ABLE TO DO 
THAT. 
>> THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL JOB. 
THANK YOU. 
BEAUTIFUL.. 
AND I KNOW LONG ISLAND VERY 
WELL, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT 
WHEN I HEAR SOME OF THE 
STORIES, I GREW UP THERE, 
ESSENTIALLY, VERY NEAR, AND I 
KNOW EVERY ONE OF THE TOWNS, 
AND TO HEAR SOME TO HAVE THE 
STORIES GOING ON WITH MS13, YOU 
WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, AND 
THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLE 
JOB. 
THEY ARE LIBERATING TOWNS, 
THINK ABOUT IT, LIBERATING 
TOWNS WHERE YOU WOULD WALK DOWN 
THE STREET AT NIGHT 20 YEARS 
AGO, 0 YEARS AGO, YOU WOULDN'T 
THINK ABOUT IT, PEOPLE DIDN'T 
LOCK THEIR DOORS, AND TODAY 
WE'RE LIBERATING TOWNS AND THIS 
IS WHAT WE HAVE COMING IN, BUT 
WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT. 
IT HITS HOME WHEN YOU KNOW THE 
TOWNS. 
IT HITS HOME WHEN YOU GREW UP 
THERE. 
THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY HITS 
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE 
IT'S HAPPENING. 
WE'RE DEEPLY HONORED TO BE 
JOINED TODAY BY FAMILY MEMBERS 
OF FOUR FALLEN BORDER PROGRESS 
AGENTS, LUIZ AGUILAR. 
NICHOLAS IVY, MARTINEZ, AND 
BRIAN TERRY, AND I JUST MET THE 
FOLKS AND THE PEOPLE AND THEIR 
CHILDREN, AND THESE ARE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
COULD I ASK YOU TO STAND, 
PLEASE. 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
INCREDIBLE. 
WE JUST TOOK PICTURES 
BACKSTAGE, AND THERE'S SOME 
WONDERFUL PEOPLE LOOKING DOWN 
ON ALL OF US TODAY, YOU KNOW 
THAT, RIGHT. 
GREAT PEOPLE LOOKING DOWN ON US 
AND THEY'RE VERY HAPPY AND 
PROUD OF YOU. 
OUR GRATITUDE TO ALL OF YOU AND 
THE MEMORIES OF YOUR LOVED 
ONES, BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 
HONORED AND CHERISHED FOREVER 
IN OUR HEARTS, ALL OF OUR 
HEARTS, EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>> TODAY I SENT A LETTER TO 
STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS ACROSS 
OUR NATION ASKING THEM TO 
PLEDGE THEIR FULL SUPPORT AND 
COOPERATION WITH THE OFFICERS 
AND AGENTS OF I.C.E. 
AND CBC. 
SADLY, IN RECENT MONTHS 
INCREDIBLY, I HAVE TO SAY, 
INCREDIBLY, A COALITION OF OPEN 
BORDERS, EXTREMISTS AND TO ME 
THAT MEANS CRIME, PEOPLE THAT 
DON'T MIND CRIME. 
THEY MIND IT WHEN IT HAPPENS TO 
THEM. 
THEY DON'T MIND IT WHEN THEY 
HAVE TO WATCH IT ON TELEVISION. 
HAVE WAGED AN UNPRECEDENTED 
ASSAULT ON AMERICAN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, OUR GREATEST 
PEOPLE, THREATENING I.C.E. 
AND BORDER PATROL FOR 
PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES  
ADMIRABLY, AND DEFENDING OUR 
COUNTRY FROM HORRIBLE PEOPLE, 
AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE EVENTS 
AND CRIMES. 
IN MAJOR CITIES ACROSS THE 
NATION, THESE OPEN BORDER 
RADICALS HAVE BLOCKED ACCESS TO 
I.C.E. 
BUILDINGS, TO FACE PUBLIC 
PROPERTY AND THREATENED PUBLIC 
SAFETY. 
AND WHAT YOU HEAR IN THE 
NEWSPAPERS AND ON THE NEWS IS 
NOTHING COMPARED TO THE WAY IT 
REALLY IS. 
AND WE'RE STOPPING IT VERY VERY 
STRONGLY. 
BUT THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH AND 
HAVING TO BE DEMEANED BY PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT STRENGTH 
IS REALLY VERY SAD, AND WE 
FIGHT IT VERY HARD, AND I CAN 
TELL YOU ALL OF THESE PEOPLE 
RIGHT HERE, AND ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, WE WILL 
NEVER LET YOU DOWN, AND I WILL 
ALSO SAY, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
THE VAST MAJORITY, I DON'T MEAN 
LIKE 51%. 
I MEAN LIKE 88%, 93%, I HAVE 
SEEN NUMBERS, THEY'RE ALL WITH 
YOU. 
IT'S JUST A SMALL GROUP THAT 
GETS A LOT OF PUBLICITY, 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO COURAGE, 
THEY HAVE NO GUTS, THEY JUST 
HAVE BIG, LOUD MOUTHS. 
AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT UP 
WITH NAY. 
AND I -- UP WITH THAT. 
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW, 
YOU'RE LOVED AND RESPECTED AS 
MUCH AS ANYBODY IN THIS COUNTRY 
IS RESPECTED. 
LAST MONTH, THE MAYOR OF 
PORTLAND, OREGON,  ORDERED 
LOCAL POLICE TO STAND DOWN. 
LEADING MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRAT 
PARTY HAVE EVEN LAUNCHED A 
CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH I.C.E. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO 
ABOLISH AMERICA'S BORDERS. 
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT I'M 
WORKING ON IT ALL THE TIME, 
THEY COME IN, WE'RE PROTECTING 
BORDERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT 
WE DON'T PROTECT OUR OWN 
BORDERS. 
HOW ABOUT THAT. 
SPENDING BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, 
IN SOME CASES, PLACES WE 
SHOULDN'T BE, TO PROTECT THEIR 
BORDERS, BUT WE DON'T PROTECT 
OUR OWN BORDER. 
WE CONDEMN THE SHAMEFUL ATTACKS 
ON OUR GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
ANY POLITICIAN WHO PUTS 
CRIMINAL ALIENS BEFORE AMERICAN 
CITIZENS SHOULD FIND A NEW LINE 
OF WORK. 
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. 
NOT GOING TO WORK. 
AND ANY POLITICIANS THAT GET UP 
AND SAY THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS 
NEVER GREAT, YOU HEARD THAT, I 
THINK THAT'S THE END OF THAT 
CAREER. 
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE 
OPPOSED KATE'S LAW. 
OPPOSED LEGISLATION TO CRACK 
DOWN ON MS13 THUGS. 
AND SUPPORTED DEADLY SANCTUARY 
CITIES, WHICH ARE A DISASTER 
AND WHICH ARE BECOMING ON A 
WEEKLY BASIS MORE AND MORE 
UNPOPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC. 
A LOT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST 
TWO YEARS. 
LAST MONTH HOUSE DEMOCRATS, 
EVEN BOYCOTTED A RESOLUTION 
SUPPORTING OUR BRAVE I.C.E. 
OFFICERS AND AGENTS. 
BUT I WILL SAY THIS, THE 
REPUBLICANS WERE WITH YOU ALL 
THE WAY. 
ALL THE WAY. 
AND WE WON. 
WE ACTUALLY WON. 
THIS NEW WAVE OF ANTI-BORDERS, 
ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT EXTREMISM 
AND SHAMEFUL, DANGEROUS, 
HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY, AND IT'S 
GOING TO STOP. 
IT'S GOING TO STOP RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S GOING TO STOP TODAY. 
WE LOAD IT DOWN. 
NOW WE'RE STOPPING IT. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER OUR 
NATION TO THE FORCES OF AN AIR 
KEY AND CHAOS -- ANARCHY, AND 
CRIME. 
THE POISONS ARE FLOWING ACROSS 
OUR BORDER, AND WE'RE HITTING 
IT FROM EVERY ANGLE. 
BUT WE NEED NEW LAWS. 
WE NEED BORDER LAWS. 
WE NEED IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
WE NEED THEM FAST. 
WE'RE GOING TO GET THEM. 
HOPEFULLY THE MIDTERMS WILL 
HELP TOWARD THAT END. 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO VERY 
WELL IN THE MIDTERMS AND THIS 
IS ONE OF THE VERY BIG REASONS, 
THE FACT IS PEOPLE RESPECT LAW 
AND ORDER, AND THEY LOVE OUR 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND I THINK 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE 
OF A RED WAVE THAN WHAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO SEE AS A PHONY BLUE 
WAVE. 
BLUE WAVE MEANS CRIME. 
IT MEANS OPEN BORDERS. 
NOT GOOD. 
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THE VILE 
SMEARS, THE HATEFUL ATTACKS, 
AND THE VICIOUS ASSAULTS ON THE 
COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN OF 
I.C.E., AND BORDER AND PATROL, 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
WE WILL PROTECT THOSE WHO 
PROTECT US. 
THE EXTREMISTS WHO ATTACK 
I.C.E. 
AND CBS, LIKE TO PORTRAY 
THEMSELVES AS CHAMPIONS OF 
SOCIAL INJUSTICE, THEY ARE NOT. 
BUT THEIR RADICAL POLICIES ARE 
THE ULTIMATE INJUSTICE HURTING 
INNOCENT AMERICANS AND SPILLING 
INNOCENT BLOOD. 
PEOPLE ARE DYING BECAUSE OF 
THEIR EITHER LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, 
LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OR JUST 
PLAIN STUPIDITY. 
LAST YEAR ALONE, SANCTUARY 
JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL 
COMMUNITIES UNLEASHED NEARLY 
8000 CRIMINAL ALIENS ONTO TOUR 
STREETS. 
OUR LAWS ARE NO GOOD. 
OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE 
BROKEN. 
THEY HAVE BEEN BROKEN FOR MANY 
YEARS. 
AND THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT 
US. 
THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT THE 
STUPIDITY OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE 
WITH IMMIGRATION. 
BUT WE'RE GETTING IT CHANGED 
AND IT'S ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE 
MUCH MORE SO AND MUCH QUICKER, 
I THINK, THAN ANYBODY 
UNDERSTANDS BECAUSE PEOPLE 
REALLY NOW UNDERSTAND THE 
PROBLEM. 
WE'RE PUSHING VERY VERY HARD. 
IN CALIFORNIA, SANCTUARY 
POLICIES RELEASED A DOMESTIC 
ABUSER. 
HE IS A SUSPECTED KILLER. 
THEY THINK HE KILLED HIS 
GIRLFRIEND JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER 
HIS RELEASE. 
IT WILL BE DETERMINED VERY 
SHORTLY, AND I HAVE A FEELING 
YOU ALL KNOW THE ANSWER. 
IN THE SANCTUARY CITY OF 
PHILADELPHIA, LOCAL OFFICIALS 
REFUSED TO COOPERATE WITH 
I.C.E. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF I.C.E. 
PEOPLE HERE THAT KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, AND THEY 
RELEASED A PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED 
ILLEGAL ALIEN BACK ONTO THE 
STREETS AFTER HIS RELEASE. 
THE ILLEGAL ALIEN RAPED AND 
BATTERED A CHILD. 
IN RECENT WEEKS, AN ELDERLY 
HOMELESS WOMAN IN NEW YORK CITY 
WAS ALLEGEDLY BEATEN TO DEATH 
BY A TWICE DEPORTED ILLEGAL 
ALIEN. 
TWO WOMEN IN OREGON WERE 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY AN 
ILLEGAL ALIEN PREVIOUSLY 
DEPORTED 20 TIMES. 
DID YOU HEAR THAT, 20 TIMES. 
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. 
THE TRUE CHAMPIONS OF JUSTICE 
ARE RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM. 
AND THEY'RE PROUDLY WEARING THE 
BADGE OF AMERICAN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
MY PLEDGE TO EACH AND EVERY ONE 
OF YOU IS THAT MY 
ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT REST 
UNTIL YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES, 
THE TOOLS, AND THE AUTHORITIES 
YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB AND DO 
IT PROPERLY AND DO IT STRONG. 
YOU'RE SAVING LIVES. 
YOU'RE SAVING A LOT OF 
AMERICANS. 
WE WILL STOP SANCTUARY CITIES. 
WE WILL END THE RIDICULOUS 
POLICY OF CATCH AND RELEASE. 
THINK ABOUT THIS, YOU CATCH 
SOMEBODY, BAD, YOU TAKE THEIR 
NAME AND RELEASE THEM. 
EXCEPT FOR POLITICS, THE 
DEMOCRATS ALL KNOW IT'S WRONG. 
BUT POLITICS IS ABSOLUTELY 
PARAMOUNT OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SAFETY, CRIME, WE HAVE TO GET 
PEOPLE IN THAT ARE GOING TO DO 
WHAT'S PROPER. 
I'LL DO WHAT'S PROPER. 
I WOULD VOTE THE OTHER WAY IF I 
THOUGHT IT WAS THE PROPER THING 
TO DO. 
I DON'T HAVE PARTY LINES. 
WE WILL PASS AT SOME POINT 
HOPEFULLY IN THE NOT TOO 
DISTANT FUTURE, KATE'S LAW. 
IT'S A GREAT LAW, AND IT'S 
SITTING WAITING FOR A VOTE. 
WE WILL DESTROY MS13, AND WE 
WILL SECURE OUR BORDER ONCE AND 
FOR ALL. 
YOU ARE THE PATRIOTS AND YOU 
ARE THE HEROES, YOU ARE THE 
FIGHTERS. 
AND YOU ARE THE WARRIORS FOR 
JUSTICE. 
YOU ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
YOU KEEP US SAFE. 
YOU KEEP US FREE. 
AND YOU MAKE US VERY VERY 
PROUD, VERY VERY PROUD. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 
ABOUT, RIGHT. 
YOU KNOW THAT, YOUR FATHER. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
AND WE'RE PROUD OF THEM. 
I'M HONORED EVERY SINGLE DAY TO 
SERVE AS YOUR COMMANDER IN 
CHIEF. 
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE. 
I WILL NEVER LEAVE THE FIGHT. 
I WILL NEVER EVER LET YOU DOWN. 
SO ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL 
NATION, LET ME SAY ONCE MORE, 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. 
YOU ARE TRULY INCREDIBLE 
PEOPLE. 
GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND GOD BLESS 
AMERICA. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> AND WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SPEAKING AT A WHITE HOUSE 
EVENT HE HOSTED TODAY. 
IT WAS A SALUTE TO THE 
COUNTRY'S IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS 
AND BORDER PROTECTION 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
I.C.E. 
AND CBP. 
THE PRESIDENT FELT THIS EVENT 
WAS NECESSARY BOTH TO CELEBRATE 
THE WORK THEY ARE DOING, AND TO 
POINT OUT THAT ESPECIALLY IN 
THE LIGHT OF THE RECENT 
ABOLISHED I.C.E. 
MOVEMENT, WHICH HE SAYS IS ALSO 
CALLING FOR OPEN BOARD EAST, HE 
SUPPORTS THEIR WORK -- BORDERS, 
HE SUPPORTS THEIR WORK. 
HE MADE A POINT OF PEOPLE 
CALLING TO ABOLISH I.C.E., OPEN 
BORDER RADICALS WHO WANT TO 
QUOTE ABOLISH AMERICA'S VOTERS. 
IT IS WORTH REMINDING VIEWERS, 
BOTH I.C.E. 
AND CBC, THEY ARE TWO 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
CUSTOMS PATROLS THE BORDER AND 
I.C.E. 
ROOTS OUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
INTERNALLY, AND THE CALLS ARE 
NOT CALLS TO ABOLISH BORDER 
PATROL. 
THOSE ARE TWO DISTINCT 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT TODAY ALSO 
HIGHLIGHTED THE WORK OF I.C.E., 
NOTING THE ARRESTS OF GANG 
MEMBERS FROM MS13. 
HE CALLED THOSE ARRESTS 
LIBERATING FOR WHOLE TOWNS IN 
LONG ISLAND. 
THE PRESIDENT ALSO MENTIONED 
THE HUNDREDS OF HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING AND CHILD 
EXPLOITATION VICTIMS. 
HE SAYS I.C.E. 
HAS IDENTIFIED AND ASSISTED. 
HE OF COURSE CALLED AGAIN FOR 
NEW IMMIGRATION AND BORDER 
PROTECTION LAWS WHICH HE CALLED 
BROKEN, AND HE CALLED FOR A RED 
WAVER AT MIDTERMS, NOT A BLUE 
WAVE WHICH THE PRESIDENT SAYS 
WOULD STAND FOR CRIME AND OPEN 
BORDERS. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MUCH 
MORE CBSN. 
DON'T GO AWAY.
