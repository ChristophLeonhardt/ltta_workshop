North Korea claims
it’s destroyed
its only nuclear test site.
Punggye-ri is an underground
facility within Mount Mantap.
It has a tunnel network
with multiple entrances.
But what exactly did 
North Korea say it blew up?
Let’s take a closer look.
It destroyed the entrances
to three tunnels:
The north entrance.
The west entrance.
The south entrance.
And administrative
and housing buildings.
It’s unclear if
these explosions
would prevent the site
from being used again.
No independent nuclear
monitors were present.
The North Korean government
did invite a select group
of foreign journalists to watch.
But authorities strictly
controlled their trip.
The testing site borders
a massive prison camp,
where it's estimated
that thousands
of political prisoners
are in captivity.
The country has held
six nuclear tests
in Punggye-ri
in the past 12 years.
