1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:07,180
JOHN CONYERS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS
ICON, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO CALL

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,340
HIM A LEGEND IN CONGRESS.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,720
HE IS A LONGEST-SERVING MEMBER
OF THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW, HE'S 88

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,960
YEARS OLD AND FOUGHT FOR MANY
GREAT THINGS INCLUDING CIVIL

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,581
RIGHTS AND MEDICARE FOR ALL BUT
HIS CAREER HERE SEEMS TO BE

6
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:27,269
COMING TO A VERY POOR ENDING AND
ONE THAT APPEARS TO BE DESERVED.

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,700
A NUMBER OF WOMEN HAVE COME
FORWARD AND SAID THEY HAD A

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,020
SITUATION WITH JOHN CONYERS
WHERE HE SEXUALLY HARASSED THEM.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,950
THEY WERE ANONYMOUS PARTLY
BECAUSE THEY HAD SIGNED A

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,710
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
BECAUSE OF ñ

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,270
MARIANNE BROWN HAS BROKEN THAT
SILENCE.

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,020
SHE WORKED WITH JOHN CONYERS
FOR A LONG TIME, SHE IS A

13
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,500
LAWYER, INCREDIBLY BELIEVABLE,
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
QUESTION ABOUT IT.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,800
HERE IS WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ON
TODAY SHOW.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:12,310
>> SOME OF THE THINGS HE DID, IT
WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT VIOLATING

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,469
MY BODY, PROPOSITIONING ME,
INVITING ME TO HOTELS WITH THE

18
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:26,030
GUISE OF DISCUSSING BUSINESS AND
THEN PROPOSITIONING ME TO

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,319
FOR SEX.

20
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,959
HE JUST VIOLATED MY BODY.

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,570
HE HAS TOUCHED ME IN DIFFERENT
WAYS AND IT WAS VERY

22
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,119
UNCOMFORTABLE AND VERY
UNPROFESSIONAL.

23
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:47,079
>>IT IS SUPER DISHEARTENING
TO HEAR BUT IT IS STILL

24
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,579
IMPORTANT TO HEAR AND THE TRUTH
IS WHAT IT IS.

25
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,450
THE MATTER WHAT YOU WANT OR IF
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE, MORE

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,490
FROM MARION BROWN.

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:06,450
>>HE INVITED ME INTO THE HOTEL
AND HE HAS UNDRESSED DOWN TO HIS

28
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,750
UNDERWEAR, AGAIN IT WAS THE
PROPOSITION OF SEXUALLY

29
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,670
SATISFYING HIM.

30
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,850
>>HE ASKED YOU TO DO SOMETHING
SEXUALLY?

31
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,250
>>YES.

32
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,330
HE ASKED ME TO SATISFY HIM
SEXUALLY.

33
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,720
HE POINTED TO AREAS ñ

34
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,090
GENERAL AREAS OF HIS BODY AND
ASKED ME TO TOUCH IT.

35
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,540
>>AND WHAT DID YOU DO IN THAT
MOMENT?

36
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,750
>>I WAS FROZEN SHOCK.

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,190
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,491
BUT ONE THING I DIDN'T WANT TO
LOSE MY JOB, I DIDN'T WANT TO

39
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:53,450
UPSET HIM AND I JUST ñ ALSO HE
ASKED ME TO FIND OTHER PEOPLE

40
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,070
THAT WOULD SATISFY HIM.

41
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,850
>>TOUGH TO LISTEN TO.

42
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,250
WE HAVE TO CALL OUT EVERYONE
EQUALLY INCLUDING ALLIES.

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,030
IT IS EASY TO CALL OUT PEOPLE
LIKE ROGER AILES WHO HAD DONE

44
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,370
DESPICABLE THINGS WITH THEIR
PUBLIC POLICY AND THEIR

45
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,740
POSITION IN POLITICS, THEN YOU
FIND OUT THEY HAVE DONE

46
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,620
ATROCIOUS THINGS BEHIND THE
SCENES.

47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,680
HARDER TO CRITICIZE WHEN IT IS
PEOPLE YOU THINK HAVE DONE

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,150
GREAT WORK AND POLICY, BUT IT
DOES NOT EXCUSE BEHAVIOR

49
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,790
LIKE THIS BEHIND THE SCENES.

50
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,470
FAIR IS FAIR AND WHAT SHE
DESCRIBES IS HEARTBREAKING.

51
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,459
ONE LAST CLIP HERE.

52
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,850
>> WHAT DO YOU HOPE HAPPENS TO
CONGRESSMAN CONYERS, AND YOU

53
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,070
BELIEVE YOU SHOULD STEP DOWN AND
RESIGN?

54
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,070
>>I'M

55
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,410
GOING TO LEAVE IT TO THE ETHICS
COMMITTEE AND HIS COLLEAGUES.

56
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,819
ALL I WANT FROM THE CONGRESSMAN
IS FOR HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT

57
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:01,680
YOU DID AND APOLOGIZE FOR ME, TO
ME FOR CALLING ME A LIAR.

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,710
>> ALL THE PARTS BOTHER ME
GREATLY BUT IF YOU'VE DONE THESE

59
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,380
TERRIBLE THINGS AND THEN YOU GO
AND CALL PEOPLE LIARS AND

60
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,910
PUBLIC, THAT IS REALLY BAD.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:21,839
SHE'S NOT THE ONLY WOMAN TO HAVE
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST CONYERS.

62
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,600
THIS HAPPENED IN 2014, IT'S NOT
LIKE IT WAS FROM 30 YEARS AGO,

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
NOT THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT
BETTER.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,720
THEY HAD A SETTLEMENT IN 2015,
SHE ADMITTEDLY BROKE THAT

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,780
SETTLEMENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL
HER STORY BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,660
MAKE SURE THAT OTHER WOMEN WERE
NOT INTIMIDATED AND DID NOT

67
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,400
GO THROUGH THE SAME SITUATION.

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,870
NOW JOHN CONYERS HAS BEEN
HOSPITALIZED IN HIS HOME

69
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,130
STATE OF MICHIGAN.

70
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:58,790
SAM RIDDLE HIS SPOKESPERSON
SAID THIS.

71
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:06,910
I WOULDN'T GO IN THAT DIRECTION.

72
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,030
THEY SAY IT IS FOR
STRESS-RELATED REASONS, I DON'T

73
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,320
KNOW I AM NOT 88.

74
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,930
ATTACKING THE MEDIA IS A
RIGHT-WING STRATEGY.

75
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,380
IF THERE IS LEGITIMATE BIAS,
YOU CALL THAT OUT AND IT

76
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,910
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE
HERE.

77
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,290
THEY REALLY ARE WOMEN HERE
WHO ARE CHARGED VERY

78
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,580
SIGNIFICANT WRONGDOINGS.

79
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,950
AT THIS POINT HE HAS EVEN
LOST NANCY PELOSI WHO HAS

80
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,310
DEFENDED HIM JUST THIS SUNDAY.

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,790
>>WHETHER THE ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST CONGRESSMAN CONYERS, WE

82
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,700
HAVE LEARNED MORE SINCE SUNDAY,
ARE SERIOUS, DISAPPOINTING,

83
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,840
AND VERY CREDIBLE.

84
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
IT IS VERY SAD.

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,200
THE BRAVE WOMEN WHO CAME FORWARD
RO JUSTICE.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,180
I PRAY FOR CONGRESSMAN CONYERS
AND HIS FAMILY AND WISH THEM

87
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,360
WELL.

88
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,490
HOWEVER CONGRESSMAN CONYERS
SHOULD RESIGN.

89
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,010
>>UNFORTUNATELY HE SHOWED, AND
NOW, THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED, BUT

90
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,081
THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS
IS ASKING HIM TO STEP DOWN, HE

91
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,330
IS THE FOUNDER.

92
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,300
AND EVEN OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS
ICONS LIKE JIM CLYBOURN WHO

93
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,560
IS IN THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP,
HAS ALSO ASKED HIM TO STEP DOWN.

94
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:33,430
A REALLY UNFORTUNATE BAD ENDING
TO WHAT HAD BEEN A GREAT CAREER

95
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,340
IN TERMS OF POLICY.

96
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,300
BUT IT DOESN'T EXCUSE ANYTHING
THAT HAS HAPPENED AND IT DOESN'T

97
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,169
MATTER IF IT IS YOUR ENEMIES ARE
YOUR ALLIES, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE

98
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,330
ANYWAY YOU SLICE IT.

99
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,610
I THINK CONGRESSMAN CONYERS
SHOULD STEP DOWN BUT WE SHOULD

100
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,070
CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THE CAUSES
HE BELIEVED IN EVEN IF WE NOW

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,770
FIND OUT SOME OF THE THINGS HE
DID BEHIND THE SCENES THAT

102
00:06:58,770 --> 00:00:00,000
WERE REPREHENSIBLE.
