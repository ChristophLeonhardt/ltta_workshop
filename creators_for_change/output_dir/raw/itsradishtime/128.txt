00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,949
hi friends so today I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,959
art I took a class in college called

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">philosophy of art and for much of the</font>

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,220
semester we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to answer the</font>

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,920
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is art what counts as art</font>

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we realized is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty arbitrary right art is</font>

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that is in a museum or sells</font>

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,150
for millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars but why we kind</font>

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,640
of define art as just this exclusive

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,800
high culture thing that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people</font>

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have access to that I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,769
with and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I've always</font>

14
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,200
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gravitated towards street art it</font>

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,980
takes this big exclusive scary thing and

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,680
says no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not valid street art says</font>

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,649
screw you art world we will make things

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,660
and will make things for the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,730
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody to</font>

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,399
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your art school if your museum</font>

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,140
admission fee and maybe not consciously

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,820
but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it it's creating</font>

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to create right because you're not</font>

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,059
going to make millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars and</font>

25
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,980
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be written down in</font>

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,960
history because you may get painted over

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,059
in two days it's a way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,159
want to be represented in art who aren't

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,770
represented in the art world which

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">brings me to another one of my favorite</font>

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,580
artists Kehinde Wiley he paints these

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,549
huge just larger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> light and super</font>

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,610
vibrant and colorful paintings of black

34
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,580
people but not just black people<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,600
kings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> queens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and heroes and gods so</font>

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,460
here's this process right he takes a

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,210
pose or a theme or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea from really</font>

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,180
famous classical historical important

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,479
paintings and then he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> finds people</font>

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,900
in his neighborhood or off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the street or</font>

41
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,000
musicians or rappers and paints them in

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,460
a way that goes back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those famous</font>

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,500
paintings he paints people who look like

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,470
me people who look like him into art

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,670
history where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't existed before</font>

46
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,290
representation it's so freaking great

47
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,000
there's another artist who did<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,579
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> vik muniz you went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brazil</font>

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,920
where there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the largest</font>

50
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,610
landfills and the world

51
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,950
and some people make their living

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,310
picking through the trash and selling

53
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,810
recyclables for money he met and spent

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,120
time with these people then he used them

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,910
as the subjects in these giant

56
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,560
recreations of classical paintings using

57
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,020
the garbage from the landfill I just

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,210
have so much respect for artists who say

59
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,380

people make every race every class every

61
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,120
