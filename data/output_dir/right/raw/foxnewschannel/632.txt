IN RESPONSE TO THAT.

50
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,670

BEGINS WITH THIS QUOTE.

56
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:55,749
ALEXANDRIA CORTEZ'S SURPRISE

00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,651
PRIMARY VICTORY OVER

58
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:58,619
REPRESENTATIVE JOE CROWLEY SEEMS

59
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,287
LIKELY TO HURT CONGRESS, AMERICA

60
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:02,122
, AND THE DEMOCRATIC

61
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,624
PARTY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO.

62
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,692
WHAT LIEBERMAN WRITES IS THAT

63
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,727
HE'S HOPING THAT CROWLEY'S NAME

64
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,495
IS ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE THE

65
00:02:08,496 --> 00:02:13,433
IDEA TO ABOLISH I.C.E. CAME FROM

66
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:13,700
HER.

67
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,736
ALEXANDRIA CORTEZ AND TOM PEREZ

68
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,471
THE HEAD OF THE DNC SAYS SHE'S

69
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,339
THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY.

70
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,241
>>  WELL I HOPE SHE IS, BECAUSE

71
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:23,143
IT SHOWS SUCH A DRAMATIC SHIFT

72
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,812
TO THE RADICAL LEFT.

73
00:02:24,813 --> 00:02:26,146
THAT'S NOT WHERE AMERICA IS.

74
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,681
AMERICA IS STILL A CENTER RIGHT

75
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:28,949
COUNTRY AND YOU SAW SHE WAS OUT

76
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,117

77
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,853
THROUGH THE MIDWEST, GOING TO

78
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:33,220
MISSOURI.

79
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,888
SHE WAS IN KANSAS CITY.

80
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,957
THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH THIS IDEA

81
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,292
OF ABOLISHING I.C.E. OF ALL THIN

82
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:38,525
S.

83
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,327
THINK ABOUT THIS MARIA.

84
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,728
THE VERY PEOPLE WHO KEEP OUR

85
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,963
COUNTRY SAFE I.C.E. HAS BEEN

86
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,364
DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

87
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,433
STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING,

88
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,168
SAVING SOME OF THESE KIDS BEING

89
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,303
EXPLOITED FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING

90
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,938
AND THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THEM

91
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,573
AND WANT OPEN BORDERS THAT'S NOT

92
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,107
WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT.

93
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,776
I HOPE THEY KEEP GOING AROUND

94
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:56,910
LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT'S WHAT

95
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,111
THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN

96
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:58,912
THE MAJORITY.

97
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,854
TERMS OF THAT BEING A PLATFORM

98
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,388
TO RUN ON, IN TERMS OF

99
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:09,523
IMMIGRATION AND YOUR EFFORTS WE

100
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,959
JUST HEARD FROM BOB GOODLATTE.

101
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,427
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME

102
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,263
UP WITH A PLAN THAT PROTECTS THE

103
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:17,397
DACA RECIPIENTS BUT ALSO

104
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,333
PROTECTS THIS COUNTRY WITH THE

105
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:20,567
PROPER SECURITY IN TERMS OF

106
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,169
SECURING THE BORDERS?

107
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,737
>>  WELL MARIA WE'VE HAD TWO

108
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:24,838
DIFFERENT BILLS WE BROUGHT TO

109
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,973
THE FLOOR THAT WOULD DO JUST

110
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:27,608
THAT AND AS YOU HEARD CHAIRMAN

111
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,209
GOODLATTE SAY WE'VE HAD LARGE

112
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,844
NUMBERS OF REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR

113
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,880
IT BUT NOT ONE DEMOCRAT SO WHEN

114
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,349
YOU HAVE BETWEEN THE TWO BILLS,

115
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,384
224 REPUBLICANS VOTING YES TO

116
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,286
BUILD A WALL, SECURE THE BORDER,

117
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,355
SOLVE THE DACA PROBLEM, AND THE

118
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,891
VISA LOTTERY SYSTEM AND NOT ONE

119
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:47,761
SHOWS YOU THEY DON'T WANT TO

120
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,263
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND WE DO,

121
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,597
WE'LL KEEP WORKING ON IT BUT

122
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,532
LET'S LOOK AT THOSE VOTES TO

123
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,437
COUNTRY'S BORDER AND EVERY

124
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,706
SINGLE DEMOCRAT VOTED NO BECAUSE

125
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,108
NANCY PELOSI BULLIED THEM AND

126
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,142
THREATENED THEM AND SAID SHE

127
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,110
DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE DONALD

128
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,611
TRUMP WITH A WIN.

129
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,346
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS

130
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:12,719
GET THE ECONOMY MOVING, TO BRING

131
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,954
REGULATIONS UNDER CONTROL, IT'S

132
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:14,621
ACTUALLY WORKING.

133
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,159
TO THE THINGS THAT ARE HELPING

134
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,727
REBUILD OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS A

135
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,897
LOSING STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATS.

136
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,832
MARIA: AND IN A ALSO FOREIGN

137
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,668
POLICY YOU LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES

138
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,603
THAT HAVE COME.

139
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,470
JIM MATTIS APPARENTLY SAYING

140
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,905
THAT THE NATO MEETING WAS A

141
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,540
WRONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

142
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,474
MEETINGS THAT HE'S EVER SEEN.

143
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,644
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S

144
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:38,412
RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN

145
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,947
AND WHAT THE U.S. NEEDS TO DO

146
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,715
WITH RUSSIA GIVEN THESE HORRIBLE

147
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,417
STORIES WE JUST HEARD ABOUT

148
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,852
PUTIN FROM BILL BROWDER.

149
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,788
>>  YEAH, PUTIN IS A BAD GUY.

150
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,855
HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND.

151
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,257
I THINK WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK

152
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:51,692
AT ARE THE ACTIONS THAT

153
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,927
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TAKEN TO

154
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:55,162
STAND UP AGAINST PUTIN AND TO

155
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:56,863
STAND UP AGAINST RUSSIA AND

156
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:57,831
THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT MARIA.

157
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,833
IF YOU START WITH THE UKRAINE

158
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,368
THEY'RE OUR FRIEND IN EASTERN

159
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:01,969
EUROPE.

160
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,474
EUROPE AND BARACK OBAMA SAT ON

161
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,608
THE SIDELINES.

162
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:09,943
THOSE COUNTRIES BY THE WAY THEY

163
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,545
DIDN'T SAY GIVE US BOOTS ON THE

164
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:11,878
GROUND.

165
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,113
THEY SAID CAN YOU JUST SELL US

166
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,414
ARMS SO WE CAN PUSHBACK AGAINST

167
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,849
THE RUSSIANS AGGRESSION AND BOMB

168
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,151
THEIR TANKS, AND OBAMA SAID NO

169
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,753
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID YES AND

170
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:20,887
ACTUALLY SOLD THEM THOSE MISSILE

171
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:21,955
S SO THEY CAN DEFEND

172
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,423
THEIR COUNTRY AND PUSH RUSSIA

173
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,258
OUT OF EASTERN EUROPE AND THAT'S

174
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,463
INCREASED SANCTIONS AGAINST

175
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,367
WE NEED TO KEEP REMINDING RUSSIA

176
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:34,501
THEY'RE NOT OUR FRIEND AND GET

177
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,471
OUT OF SYRIA, STOP ALLYING WITH

178
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:39,606
SOME OF THESE ROGUE COUNTRIES.
