well a little change of scenery I'm in the other car this is of course you could tell this is the car that we use to cart the kids around in because well first of all there are the crumbs all over the seat and also whatever that thing is right there I didn't know what that is but but mainly the main piece of evidence is this the stickers on the window here because and and you know this if you're a parent if you're not a parent maybe you don't know this in fact nobody warned me of this before I before I became a parent but when you have kids at a certain age especially if you have a girl there are going to be stickers everywhere you're not going to be able to escape stickers there'll be stickers all over your house all over the outside of your house all over every item you own all over you also there's many stickers covering you in fact that was just I was at the grocery store last night and I was in line and this woman turns to me and she goes oh you're a big Jasmine fan huh and I said what who Jasmine him and she said Jasmine from Aladdin you're a big fan and I said well I Aladdin was my favorite Disney movie growing up but I don't know how did you know that what do you and then she points to my shirt and I see that there's a huge sticker a huge Jasmine sticker on my shirt which I didn't realize was there at some point my daughter had put a Jasmine sticker on me without me even noticing and I had been walking around who knows how long with that sticker on so just something to look out for another note completely unrelated but I'm looking forward to seeing hopefully some of you at the Western conservative summit this Thursday in Denver June 8th is when the summit begins I'll be speaking that morning on June 8th and it's it'll be a great event largest gathering of conservatives outside of DC that happens every year and so I'll be great to come together and talk and learn and be equipped so hopefully you'll you'll be able to make it out if you live nearby now there are only certain kinds of life-forms that would survive a nuclear holocaust cockroaches famously scorpions certain kinds of bacteria would would would all be on that list but I think I really believe that if the United States were ever flattened by a barrage of nuclear explosions and all human life was eradicated in the country I think that alongside the cockroaches and scorpions and bacteria I think even then Planned Parenthood would survive it would be Planned Parenthood and cockroaches and they would be the ones who would survive a nuclear holocaust and I don't look I certainly don't don't get me wrong I would never compare Planned Parenthood to a cockroach because that would be grossly unfair to cockroaches Planned Parenthood is far far worse far lower far more disgusting and vile than infectious bacteria or a swarm of roaches so I would never besmirched the good name of cockroaches in that way and I want to apologize first of all the cockroaches if that it came across that way at all because that's not what I mean what I'm saying is that the organization of Planned Parenthood they really appear to be essentially impervious to any kind of attack they are they just nothing nothing touches them somehow so we take this past week for example there was this very damning report or a report that should be damning anyway published by live action which is a great pro-life organization and this report uses eyewitness accounts court cases video footage witness our victim testimony compiles all that together to paint this picture to to to reveal a fact that really is we already knew but now they're kind of putting it all together and showing us the scope of it showing us that this tax-funded abortion corporation has been engaged in a criminal conspiracy to cover up sex crimes and this has been going on for a long time the report dates back goes back decades to show that this is a pattern of behavior at Planned Parenthood for a very long time so and III think it's it could be worthwhile to just mention a few of these specific cases just a few of these because these are kind of emblematic of what goes on in Planned Parenthood so just a few cases I want to mention specifically just so you understand first of all a woman named Denise Fairbanks says that she was raped and impregnated by her father at the age of 13 he took her to a Planned Parenthood clinic and forced her to get an abortion she the thirteen-year-old girl told the clinic staff that she was being abused they refuse to alert the authorities they refuse to do anything about it instead they just perform the abortion they took the money and they sent this little girl home with her but with her father so that she could continue to be raped for another year and a half I mean just just think about that you've got a pregnant 13 year old girl brought to Planned Parenthood by her dad which already should be like red flags all over the place you've got a 13 year old pregnant girl at being brought to an abortion clinic by her dad so already there should be red flags but now she tells you she's being raped by her father and you send her home with her father another case a man named George Savannah was raped I should say raped and impregnated his daughter three times each time he brought her to Planned Parenthood so that the evidence of this crime would be destroyed and somehow the fact that a man kept returning to the clinic year after year with his daughter who's a minor somehow that never raised any red flags for the Planned Parenthood stuff none of the incidents were reported nothing was done about it the authorities were never alerted to the situation and so the abuse contained then another case a twelve-year-old girl was brought to the clinic by her foster brother who was also her rapist Planned Parenthood this is a 12 year old girl being brought to the abortion clinic by her 23 year old foster brother which is just that right there is pretty much it's pretty much 100% certainty that the brother is the rapist that's not a normal thing a 23 year old foster brother doesn't bring his faut is 12 year old foster sister to the clinic to get an abortion that's not something that happens unless the girl was raped Planned Parenthood they never contacted the authorities they never even contacted the girls foster parents to let her to let them know so the girls abuse continued these incidents are not isolated they are widespread they're common and Planned Parenthood has made absolutely no effort to correct that problem the problem whatsoever Planned Parenthood was already they were already caught on video in 2011 failing to report the sex abuse of minors this was a this was a sting operation that was done you know seven years ago and these videos came out and they got a little bit of attention and what what happened and in response to that they held training sessions with their employees to teach them how to detect if they're being filmed not not to teach them how to identify and report sex crimes they didn't care about that all they said to their employees was what would this this is these are the things to look out for to know if you're being filmed but don't worry about if a girl's being raped that's not our problem but if she's filming you then this is what you do to pretend like you do care so Planned Parenthood has always been a rapist best friend but it really seems that they fully embraced that role in recent years and that's not to say listen I don't believe that staff members at your average Planned Parenthood clinic support rape per se I'm not saying that they like the idea of rape necessarily I think that they just don't care about it and they care much more about the financial and ideological bottom line so financially rape is good for business so maybe in that sense actually maybe I should backtrack yeah let me let me take that back I just gave Planned Parenthood a little too much credit uh no they do like right they actually do support rape because rape is so good for business it brings in money and repeated rape especially the repeated rape of a child by a family member is extremely good for business because it's a sustained revenue source so when Planned Parenthood looks at a pregnant raped thirteen-year-old girl all they see is dollar signs they see a sustained revenue source and they know they're gonna get three four maybe five abortions out of this girl but by the time she turns 18 and so that's a lot of money you know hey it's Christmas bonuses for the entire staff um so financially rape is good for business and so they're not gonna report it for that reason ideologically it would hurt the cause of reproductive rights if people really began to understand just how often women are forced or coerced to choose abortions so that's why they don't want to tell us about it because if Planned Parenthood was honest and they actually reported every time a girl was brought in you know who had been a victim and it was one of these situations where she's being brought in and her her she's being forced to get abortion if we could real if we had statistics and we could see just how often this happened we would the entire pro-choice position would begin to unravel because it would become clear that in so many of these cases choice has nothing to do with it whatsoever so not reporting rape means more money less hassle reporting rape means less money more hassle so what do you think Planned Parenthood's gonna do they're already killing three hundred and thirty thousand human beings a year so what's a little bit of rape on top of that they do I get all squeamish about about rape when you're killing babies every single day you're coming to work every single day and you're either directly killing babies or depending on what you do with the clinic you're facilitating the murder of babies and this is what you do for a living every day you get up you know you just stop by Starbucks you get your coffee you head into work maybe you pack a lunch and you go into the break room and you punch the clock and it's all right let's kill some babies that's what it means to work at Planned Parenthood so of course they're not gonna care about rape they don't care about anything they're just dead inside their souls have have evaporated to almost nothing and so I don't even think that they're morally capable of caring about rape even if they wanted to so it's no surprise that Planned Parenthood helps cover up rapes helps rapists cover up their crimes we've known this it's logically obvious anyway because there's there is one incontrovertible way to prove that for instance a father has raped his daughter but abortion gives the rapist scumbag father the means to destroy that evidence and this is kind of the morbid irony of of everything is that the abortion abortion enthusiasts will always cite rape and incest as proof that abortion is necessary they're the other ones always bringing up rape and incest rape and incest but abortion is also precisely the thing that empowers incestuous rapists to continue abortion doesn't empower the victims it empowers the Predators the victim has already been victimized by the time the abortion comes into play abortion is not going to erase that all it's going to do is create another victim but from the perspective of the rapist abortion is wonderful because it means that they won't be held accountable and they can continue raping this is as I said rather clear it's rather self-evident yet you might think if you think if you didn't know any better you could look at the situation you could see that yeah we've known that Planned Parenthood's been doing this nobody's cared up until now but maybe now that live action is coming out with this report and they've got it all there you know bullet points and they've got all the the information they've compiled it all into one convenient place that you can go and look and they and they're coming out with this report in the middle of this crusade against sexual assault in the middle of the me2 thing all this is going on so it seems like society has this renewed focus on battling sex assault and sex crimes and so maybe if you come out with this report now in the midst of that maybe Planned Parenthood will finally be held accountable for something but if you were if you had expected that then you'd be disappointed because what actually happened when uh when live-action published this report last week what was the response nothing nothing happened nobody paid attention nobody cared we've seen this act before by the way recall the Center for medical progress and their sting operation at they did against plant bear where they were they revealed that this organization chops up dead babies and sells their parts they were caught on video haggling over the price of a liver or a kidney it was by far the most disturbing explosive shocking undercover footage to ever be put in front of public or the pup in front of the public for viewing and what happened what was the result nothing in fact you know what the result was the Center for medical progress got got in trouble they were the ones who faced legal penalties not Planned Parenthood even conservatives couldn't seem to muster up enough energy to focus on the on Planned Parenthood selling dead baby parts even conservatives couldn't seem to focus on it for more than two days and as far as this most recent report conservatives didn't focus on it for even two seconds everybody just yawned this is how it always goes Planned Parenthood covers up rape they sell dead baby parts and oh yeah by the way they also murder three hundred and thirty thousand babies a year in the first place which we all know about that and they admit to that proudly so that's an established fact fact what happens as a result what what kind of penalty what kind of social penalty do they face because of that nothing yeah I mean now they are gonna finally lose a little bit of tax funding and tiny percentage but they're still receiving hundreds of millions of dollars a year from the taxpayers with no sign of that going away anytime soon they can cover up rape that can kill babies that can sell their parts and there is practically no social or legal consequence for any of it it's not that Planned Parenthood is held to a low standard or a different standard they are held to no standard whatsoever they can do whatever they want literally whatever they want and there will not be much in the way of popular outrage about it how is this happening how do they get away with everything how do they always get away with it how can this information be put right in front of our faces and we just don't do anything about it how at least cockroaches have the decency to scatter when the light turns on but you turn on the light when it comes to the Planned Parenthood cockroach and it could just stay there right in the light exposing its hideous hideousness in front of all of us and just go yeah yeah what of it guys what are you gonna do about it and we all say in response oh nothing just didn't mean to disturb you go about your business carry on how why I mean what is going on here it's obvious why the left and the media ignore this stuff that doesn't need any explanation abortion is the sacred sacrament on the left Planned Parenthood is in that case kind of the high priest and so they can not be questioned cannot be sacrificed they are the sacred estas acred cows so we get that but what about the right I know that there are some conservatives on the right who are you know brimming with rage at Planned Parenthood and who really do care about this stuff and who do whatever they can in their own small way to amplify these stories and to mobilize in response to them but they are in the minority they are not that's not how it goes in the mainstream even among mainstream conservative networks and mainstream conservative commentators and pundits this issue of Planned Parenthood abortion and so on is basically ignored or it's treated as a sideshow something of kind of secondary importance yet we know what popular outrage on the right looks like and we also know what can happen as a result of it so think about the NFL for instance a few NFL players kneel during the anthem and conservatives spend two years shouting about it we had sustained outrage for two years conservatives boycotted a protest they mobilized against inappropriate anthem posture and they in they effected change they didn't let up about the issue they didn't tolerate even a few NFL players displaying inappropriate posture during the national anthem and and and and they hurt the NFL B I mean the NFL was was was was hurt by the the outrage and real change occurred because they were so outwitting so angry so furious about it so passionate this is what it looks like when a majority of conservatives care about something yet the slaughter of the unborn Planned Parenthood chopping up babies and selling a Planned Parenthood covering up child rape this receives not even a tenth not even a twentieth of the attention or the outrage on the right we simply don't care about it anywhere near the same way or to the same degree as we cared about colin kaepernick kneeling during the anthem you why I mean what why this should be a this should be a no-brainer if you're not a radically pro-abortion person you should hear stories like this and just be I mean you that's not the way it goes and as I said I know there are exceptions but the fact remains generally speaking conservatives just they this is just not something that they care that much about anecdotally okay just to give you an anecdotal evidence last week I wrote an article on Thursday about Samantha bee using an inappropriate word so Samantha B says in inappropriate she uses a vulgarity and it was a bad word and it was a terrible thing she said and I thought she should be fired for it and I still think that so I wrote an article saying Samantha bee should be fired that was like the title of the article that was that was my entire thesis and it's in terms of traffic it did really well got you know I don't know 150,000 people read it which is which is pretty good for a for a commentary piece so got a fair amount of attention you know the very next day I wrote an article about Planned Parenthood engaging in a criminal conspiracy to cover up child rape which you would think is like a much much much much much much much more important issue yet it gets about a third of the traffic I get just people don't care conservatives just care a lot more about Samantha be using the cuss word than they do about Planned Parenthood why I think there are two reasons I think there's first of all just to general apathy and moral malaise that you find on both sides of the political spectrum and everywhere in between people care more about the bread and circuses types of issues because those issues are just easier and more fun and they're just kind of these are just sort of the shiny balls that we kind of look to and are distracted by the bright lights and everything and it involves a celebrity and so on and so forth so we're just gonna care more about that second there's also a lack of leadership on the right I think I mean there's a lack of good honest leadership because just house a lot of people are they need Dutch's conservatives but just people in general just this is just part of human nature for a lot of people where they they don't know what exactly to care about until they're kind of told what to care about and so we know on the left they're generally gonna care about the stuff that their media talking heads tell them to care about and people on the rights will care about whatever FoxNews Donald Trump and various media celebrities tell them the caribou if those leaders don't focus on the slaughter of the unborn or child or Planned Parenthood covering up child rape if they don't say much about it which they haven't said much about it then then a lot of conservatives will just ignore I guess what I'm saying is even though everyone likes to claim that they think for themselves and that they're really independent thinkers but I think what you realize when you look at the situation is that's actually a very rare quality everyone says they think for themselves but in reality when you look at them and you listen to them they're just saying what everyone else says they don't think for themselves at all so to really think for yourself is a very rare quality and few people possess it so in order to care about something like this to care about you know abortion in general you have to really think for yourself the mainstream media isn't going to tell you the kid they're gonna tell you not to care about it most conservatives ignore it so you have to be able to look at that look at the crowd and see that the crowd is focused on a million things besides this and you have to reject that and say okay they're all they're all clamoring about that nonsense over there but I'm gonna focus on this because this is what matters simple fact of human nature is that very few people are willing or able to operate that way which is why we need leaders who could wade into that crowd where everyone is clamoring over nonsense and stand up and say hey guys hold on look what's happening over here we just don't have enough people doing gets away with it every single time they get away with it eventually we have to stop letting thanks for listening everybody Godspeed you you
