when people think about cars they often think of depreciating assets we're trying to change that collectible cars have delivered 300 percent plus returns over the past 10 years Riley Road is an investment at where we take high value appreciating assets like collectible cars and turn them into stocks essentially each car on Riley Road is a mini public company which is divided up into two thousand shares investors can create a diversified portfolio of interest in each of these collectible cars share buy share car by car so each month on rally road you create what's called a trading window where you're able to exit your investment through the app you could submit your shares for sale through a registered broker-dealer and we connect you with other potential buyers who would like to buy those shares so we're always tracking the data through the app and trying to understand when the right time is to actually exit an investment when we do the funds that come back from liquidating that car get distributed among the investors we don't really think about Riley Road as an alternative to other asset classes we think about it as in addition the great thing about collectible cars is that they're uncorrelated returns with the traditional equity markets so it gives you a nice way to diversify your portfolio and to get into the really good stuff without actually having the capital to buy all the assets yourself
