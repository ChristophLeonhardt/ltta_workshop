If you are a young, sexually
attractive woman who gets
perhaps unwanted attention,
you know that
appearance matters.
If you are black in America,
you know that image matters.
I didn't see anyone who
had a visible disability
in the mainstream media.
There are about 2 spots in
a show for black girls out
of maybe 50.
The conventional ideal
of a beautiful woman
is a thin white woman.
As I'm getting older,
I'm really noticing
how the rest of
society must feel
from looking at these
images of 14-year-olds,
15-year-olds as the
ideal of beauty.
My understanding of
Fashion Week in general
is very limited because
as a plus-size model,
we're never really invited.
We've all kind of
been brainwashed
into thinking like these
Eurocentric Caucasian features
are what is attractive.
From what I've seen in my
career in the last nine years,
generally, fit models, most of
the time, they look like me.
There are things that I did
to compromise my authenticity
in order to get my foot in the
door, such as straightening
my hair, changing what I wore.
My first agent here changed my
name from Precious to Victoria.
A lot of the times,
designers and clients
don't really know
where to put me.
They're like, is she white?
Is she black?
I know that there is
like a petite category,
a plus-size category.
But there isn't, if
any at all, a category
for people with disabilities.
I think I'm literally the
biggest blackest model at IMG.
We need more people that
have more power and influence
to open their mind to
different types of beauty.
I had one guy who wanted
my nipples to look hard
for this shoot to show through.
He literally just grabbed my
nipple, and was like, see?
We need it to be hard.
They would talk about
my body in front of me.
Like they'd say, like,
Julia's very wide .
Everyone keep that in
mind, like in a meeting
in front of people.
One of my first test
shoots in New York,
we drove out to the Hamptons.
And nobody told me that it
was going to be topless.
So I shot topless on
the beach, and the
poses he was asking me to do.
And I have never felt so
uncomfortable in my life.
Let me help you put
lotion on your back.
But I don't need help
with that, because I
don't need you touching me.
I had this moment when I
was like 20 or 21 years old,
and I was like, I understand why
Britney Spears had a meltdown
and shaved her head.
And it's like, you get sick
of people touching you.
Some people would say that
people in the industry
have confused being new and
having a moment with age.
Other people would say
that adolescent girls have
sort of a pre-pubescent physique
that is favored by designers.
The fashion industry seems
to have this obsession
with extreme youth.
I was a 16-year-old.
I was at Disneyland
on a camp trip,
and I had to rush to New
York to shoot an editorial.
Showed up to set, and
it was S&M inspired.
And it was just this table of
anything you could think of.
It was whips, and
cuffs, and various balls
for various activities.
And oh my god, I was
just like bright red.
When I was young, I
shot was someone who
went to jail for pedophilia.
So that was really
difficult to hear,
because he shot a
lot of young women.
I was at a casting yesterday
that felt like a cattle call.
And I was looking around,
and I felt like everyone
must have been 16, 17, 18.
And here am I, like past
25, really questioning,
am I still beautiful?
Do I still hold worth?
I think that too often,
models are trivialized,
and our concerns are dismissed
because we're young women.
People would not have been
able to turn a blind eye
if this were a
male-dominated industry.
Fashion is becoming a
little more diverse,
but we still have
a long way to go.
We have to tokenize
in order to normalize.
But I don't want this shift
to be commodified as a trend.
I want it to be a reality.
I think that women, they forget
that they have consumer power.
And if they stop buying
into the women's magazines
that are always like, lose
15 pounds in two weeks.
Why do we have to do that?
I believe that everything
starts with self-love,
and that's what the decision
to wear my hair natural really
taught me.
I'm a model, but I can
also be a role model.
Being a role model isn't
about showing people
how to look like you.
Being a role model is
about using your freedom
to show other people it's
safe to be themselves.
My imagery is my activism.
Like, how could
you like yourself?
I like myself.
How could she wear that?
I'm wearing it.
In my mind, I'm competing
with the Naomi Campbells
and the Kate Mosses
of the world.
Just because, why not?
