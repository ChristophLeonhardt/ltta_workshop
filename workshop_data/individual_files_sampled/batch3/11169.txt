let's get the thoughts now should be as fee he's Director of International Finance solutions Associates and he joins us now and you're very welcome thanks for coming on firstly we're just listening there to what Europe hopes to hopes to do to shield its companies from these sanctions being imposed by America but can they really do that much to protect these companies when we hear the likes of total for example saying look regardless we're going to have to pull out of Iran well of course a total is a sort of an illustration of a company which has interest both in the USA and the European Union being a French company but there are many companies that have no US links I know that Washington has threatened and given an ultimatum of 180 days for companies to wind down it in Iran but as the French finance minister was quite rightly pointing out that over the last many years and particularly over the last three years since the nuclear deal French companies have done tremendously well every other car in Tehran seems to be a Renault or a pleasure a core group opened to hotels just outside Imam Khomeini Airport a base and novotel so French have huge exposure in Iran similarly Germany has been doing tremendous business there are many German banks particularly the provincial banks which have no exposure to the New York market like Deutsche Bank and others they have been facilitating transactions between Iran German companies and other European countries at the end of the day what I think is important is that you know we talk about sovereignty is Europe going to have its economic sovereignty sovereignty is Europe going to enjoy its political sovereignty is Europe going to enjoy international status by having a sovereign voice rather than following Washington sure blonde that's all very well shibir but it's money that makes the world go round and if people are gonna lose money they're just gonna fall into line aren't they well I think this is again a red herring Washington is making a lot of noise that it will penalize companies there are lots of other options that are available to the European Union we can straight away to start if you like taxing many of the European American companies that operate here for instance Amazon they don't pay much tax as you know or starbuck multiple other Facebook you name it all the sort of IT sector other sectors that are benefitting by paying no taxation perhaps we could legitimately tags these companies in a discriminatory manner so that Washington's understands what's going on so I don't think it's a losing battle for the European Union as such I think it's the fear and the paranoia that is being created by the by the advisors to mr. Trump who are really in for a war with Iran like mr. Bolton and mr. Pompey suppose it does work both ways though doesn't it shibir I mean we've heard from the EU there's a chance or a threat that they could actually start accepting euros for Iran's oil or pay for Iran's wall with Euros and not the petro dollar I mean that significantly could hurt America - absolutely there are many options open over the last ten years globally dollar was exchanged for over ninety percent of the transactions but in the last year or two it has come down to sixty percent as all you well know that IMF have now recognized you on the Chinese currency as one of the international currencies for exchange so slowly I think people are weaning themselves off the greenback as the currency of desire and if the European Union with the euro takes that move forward then I think we could see a lot of interesting changes occurring as far as the prospects of dollar not really become not really sort of being that important in the global trade mmm okay she baler we're going to have to leave it there we've run out of time but they're really nice to talk to you there should be a transfer you Director of International Finance solutions Associates in the UK thank you
