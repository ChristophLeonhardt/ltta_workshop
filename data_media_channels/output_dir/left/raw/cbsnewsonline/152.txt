HOPING NEVER TO HAVE USED THEM 

3
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:45,496
BUT ALWAYS BEING PREPARED. 

4
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:46,030
>> Reporter: ONE OF THE 

5
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,630
SHOOTING VICTIMS HAD TO BE 

6
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,231
AIRLIFTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN 

7
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:47,698
CRITICAL CONDITION. 

8
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:48,399
FAMILY SAYS HE IS NOW PARALYZED 

9
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:48,866
FROM THE NECK DOWN. 

10
00:27:48,866 --> 00:27:49,500
TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE TREATED 

11
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,934
FOR MINOR INJURIES. 

12
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,167
ELAINE? 

13
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:50,534
>> THANK YOU. 

14
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:51,168
>>> COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

15
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,802
SIGNS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO 

16
00:27:51,802 --> 00:27:52,236
BRING A HALT TO HIS

ADMINISTRATION'S FAMILY 

18
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,204
SEPARATION POLICY. 

19
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:53,771
WE'LL DISCUSS WHAT BROUGHT 

20
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:54,171
ABOUT THE CHANGE. 

21
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:54,805
>>> FOOD RECALLS CAN BE SCARY 

22
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:55,372
BUT THE CDC SAYS THERE IS 

23
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:55,973
TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TRACK AND 

24
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:56,574
CONTAIN FOODBORNE ILLNESSES. 

25
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:56,907
STAY WITH US. 

26
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:57,308
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

27
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:58,976
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENDING A 

28
00:27:58,976 --> 00:27:59,543
HEAVILY CRITICIZED POLICY 

29
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:00,177
SEPARATING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 

30
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:00,644
AT THE U.S. BORDER. 

31
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:01,245
FOR A WEEK, OFFICIALS ARGUED 

32
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:01,912
THEY WERE JUST UPHOLDING THE LAW

33
00:28:01,912 --> 00:28:02,613
AND CALLED ON CONGRESS TO COME 

34
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,047
UP WITH A SOLUTION. 

35
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,248
AFTER DAYS OF PUBLIC OUTRAGE, ú 

36
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:04,849
EXECUTIVE ORDER ROLLING BACK 

37
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,282
FAMILY SEPARATION. 

38
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:05,916
BEFORE SIGNING THE ORDER, THE 

39
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:06,550
PRESIDENT SAID HE STILL WANTS 

40
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,151
TO BE TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION. 

41
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:07,852
>> I CONSIDER IT TO BE A VERY 

42
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,519
IMPORTANT EXECUTIVE ORDER, IT'S 

43
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,019
ABOUT KEEPING FAMILIES 

44
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:09,687
TOGETHER, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

45
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,387
BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY 

46
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:11,021
POWERFUL, VERY STRONG BORDER 

47
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:11,622
AND BORDER SECURITY WILL BE 

48
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:12,189
EQUAL IF NOT GREATER THAN 

49
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:12,490
PREVIOUSLY. 

50
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,057
SO WE ARE KEEPING FAMILIES 

51
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:13,657
TOGETHER AND THIS WILL SOLVE 

52
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:13,991
THAT PROBLEM. 

53
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:14,558
ATTHE SAME TIME, WE ARE 

54
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:15,192
KEEPING A VERY POWERFUL BORDER 

55
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:15,860
AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A ZERO 

56
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,494
TOLERANCE -- WE HAVE ZERO 

57
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,161
TOLERANCE FOR PEOPLE THAT ENTER 

58
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:17,661
OUR COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 

59
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,195
>> JOINING ME NOW FROM 

60
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:18,863
WASHINGTON IS FRANCO ORDONEZ, 

61
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,463
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR 

62
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:20,130
McCLATCHY NEWS AND THE COHOST OF

63
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,764
McCLATCHY'S MAJORITY-MINORITY 

64
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,031
PODCAST. 

65
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:21,665
JUST DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

66
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:22,266
SAID HE WOULD NOT SIGN AN 

67
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:22,867
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO STOP THE 

68
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:23,467
SEPARATION POLICY SO WHAT 

69
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,001
BROUGHT ABOUT THIS CHANGE? 

70
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:24,702
┗> IT 

71
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,236
SUCH A GROUNDSWELL OF 

72
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:25,803
OPPOSITION TO THIS POLICY 

73
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:26,403
CHANGE, FROM HIS OWN PARTY, 

74
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:27,071
LAURA BUSH SPOKE OUT, HIS WIFE 

75
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:27,738
SPOKE OUT, BUT ALSO WITHIN HIS 

76
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:28,405
SUPPORTERS, HIS VERY IMPORTANT 

77
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:29,073
SUPPORTING BASE, ALSO BEGAN TO 

78
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:29,373
SPEAK OUT. 

79
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:30,007
LET'S REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT 

80
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:30,608
THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IS TO 

81
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:31,208
HIS BASE, YOU HAD FOLKS LIKE 

82
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:31,575
FRANKLIN GRAHAM

83
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:32,209
SPEAKING OUT AND SAYING THIS 

84
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:32,743
WAS NOT THE RIGHT POLICY. 

85
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:33,310
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF KEY 

86
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,878
PEOPLE AND VERY IMPORTANT 

87
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,612
SUPPORTERS WHO TEND TO BE VERY 

88
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:35,246
LOYAL ON THIS ISSUE, REALLY 

89
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:35,746
WENT AGAINST HIM HERE. 

90
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:36,347
>> PAULA REID REPORTS THAT 

91
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:36,914
UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDER, 

92
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:37,581
FAMILIES CAN STILL BE SEPARATED 

93
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:37,982
AFTER 20 DAYS. 

94
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:38,682
WAS THIS SIMPLY MOVE TO TRY TO 

95
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:39,149
GET LAWMAKERS TO ACT? 

96
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:39,750
>> THAT'S THE QUESTION HERE. 

97
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,451
WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE THAT TRUMP 

98
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:40,885
IS GOING TO MAKE? 

99
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,585
IT'S KIND OF -- IS IT GOING TO 

100
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:42,253
BE SEEK PERMISSION FIRST OR ASK 

101
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:42,653
FORGIVENES LATER? 

102
00:28:42,653 --> 00:28:43,320
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO THIS 

103
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,888
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR 

104
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,255
COURT HEARINGS. 

105
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:44,955
AS YOU POINT OUT, THEY ONLY CAN 

106
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:45,422
DO THAT FOR 20 DAYS. 

107
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:46,090
HE ORDERED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 

108
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:46,790
TO SEEK TO MODIFY AN AGREEMENT. 

109
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,424
THAT REQUIRES THEM ONLY TO DO 

110
00:28:47,424 --> 00:28:47,691
20 DAYS. 

111
00:28:47,691 --> 00:28:48,292
SO THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE 

112
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:48,826
ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT 

113
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:49,393
VIOLATING THAT AGREEMENT. 

114
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:50,094
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL TRY 

115
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:50,728
TO GO, BUT I CAN GUARANTEE IF 

116
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,395
THEY DO AND THEY GO PAST THOSE 

117
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:52,062
20 DAYS, THERE'S GOING TO BE A 

118
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:52,596
LOT OF COURT CASES BEING 

119
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:52,897
POPPING UP. 

120
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,497
>> FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IS 

121
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:54,164
NOW JOINING THE CHORUS OF THOSE 

122
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:54,765
WHO HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THE 

123
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:55,266
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY. 

124
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:55,933
I WANT TO PLAY A CLIP FROM HIS 

125
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:56,500
FINAL PRESS CONFERENCE AS 

126
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,101
PRESIDENT WHERE HE DISCUSSED 

127
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:57,735
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD 

128
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:58,369
CAUSE HIM TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST 

129
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:58,903
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

130
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,370
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT. 

131
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,037
>> FOR ME AT LEAST I WOULD PUT 

132
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:00,671
IN THAT CATEGORY, EFFORTS TO 

133
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:01,372
ROUND UP KIDS WHO HAVE GROWN UP 

134
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:01,939
HERE AND FOR ALL PRACTICAL 

135
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:02,540
PURPOSES ARE AMERICAN KIDS. 

136
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,140
AND SEND THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE. 

137
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,674
THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD 

138
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:04,241
ARBITRARILY OR BECAUSE OF 

139
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:04,842
POLITICS PUNISH THOSE KIDS, 

140
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:05,476
WHEN THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING 

141
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:06,143
WRONG THEMSELVES, I THINK WOULD 

142
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:06,777
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD MERIT 

143
00:29:06,777 --> 00:29:07,211
ME SPEAKING OUT. 

144
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:07,845
>> FRANCO, HOW UNUSUAL IS IT 

145
00:29:07,845 --> 00:29:08,412
FOR A FORMER PRESIDENT TO 

146
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:09,046
CRITICIZE A SITTING PRESIDENT? 

147
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:09,446
>> VERY UNUSUAL. 

148
00:29:09,446 --> 00:29:10,147
PRESIDENTS TEND TO BE RESPECTFUL

149
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:10,748
OF FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS, 

150
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:11,382
GEORGE W. BUSH DID THAT TO 

151
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,016
OBAMA, OBAMA HAS VERY LARGELY 

152
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:12,616
BEEN KEPT QUIET ON MANY OF 

153
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:12,950
THESE ISSUES. 

154
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,617
BUT IT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS 

155
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:14,051
ISSUE IS TO HIM. 

156
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:14,618
THAT HE IS SPEAKING OUT. 

157
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:15,252
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AS WE 

158
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:15,886
POINTED OUT EARLIER HAS REALLY 

159
00:29:15,886 --> 00:29:16,487
TUGGED ON A LOT OF EMOTIONAL 

160
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:16,754
STRINGS. 

161
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,388
JAY JOHNSON, DHS SECRETARY, A 

162
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,022
FEW WEEKS AGO WAS OUT SPEAKING 

163
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:18,722
ABOUT HOW HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 

164
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:19,390
HE DID A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT, A 

165
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,024
LOT OF THE SAME THINGS TRUMP 

166
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:20,724
DID, BUT HE TRIED NOT TO MAKE 

167
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,425
IT A POLICY TO SEPARATE MOTHERS 

168
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:21,759
AND CHILDREN. 

169
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,426
>> YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE ANITA 

170
00:29:22,426 --> 00:29:23,027
KUMAR RECENTLY REPORTED THAT 

171
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:23,661
U.S. OFFICIALS LOST TRACK OF 

172
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:24,295
NEARLY 6,000 IMMIGRANT CHILDREN

173
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:24,929
, AND THAT'S A MAJOR INCREASE 

174
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,563
FROM 1500 THAT OFFICIALS SAID. 

175
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,196
HOW DID YOU REACH THAT NUMBER 

176
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:26,797
AND WHERE IS THE DISCREPANCY 

177
00:29:26,797 --> 00:29:26,997
HERE? 

178
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:27,298
>> INDEED. 

179
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:27,998
THE 1500 NUMBER THAT CAME OUT A 

180
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:28,666
FEW WEEKS AGO REALLY CREATED AN 

181
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,199
OUTCRY AND CONCERN ABOUT 

182
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:29,833
WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION WAS 

183
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:30,367
DOING A GOOD ENOUGH JOB 

184
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:30,968
PROTECTING THESE VULNERABLE 

185
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:31,635
KIDS AND PUTTING THEM IN HOMES 

186
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:32,269
WHERE THEY COULD REMAIN SAFE. 

187
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:32,870
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE 

188
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,537
ADMINISTRATION WAS ONLY TAKING 

189
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:34,104

LITTLE MORE THAN 7,000 CALLS, 

194
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,840
BUT THE REALITY IS THERE WAS 

195
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,441
MORE THAN 42,000 CHILDREN 

196
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:38,042

THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS THERE 

199
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:39,643
WAS ABOUT 14% OF THOSE DIDN'T 

200
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:40,210
RETURN CALLS AND COULDN'T 

201
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,744

202
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:41,145
THAT'S NOT 1500. 

203

THAT'S OVER 6,000. 

204

IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST SIX 

370
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,341
OR SEVEN YEARS, BOTH SIDES OF 

371
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:17,975
POLITICS HAVE ESSENTIALLY HAD 

372
00:31:17,975 --> 00:31:18,442
THE SAME POLICY AND

373
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,076
THAT IS HARSH MEASURES TO TRY TO

374
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:19,710
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE ARRIVING BY 

375
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:19,910

376
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,577
BOTH PARTIES HAVE A POLICY NOW 

377
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:21,211
THAT NO ONE WHO TRIES TO GET 

378
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:21,912
HERE BY BOAT WILL EVER SET FOOT 

379
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:22,279

380
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:22,946
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS THEY 

381
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:23,547
HAVE SHIPPED THEM OFF TO TWO 

382
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:24,181
LITTLE ISLANDS, CAMPS INITIALLY 

383
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:24,782
ACROSS THE PACIFIC, ONE IN 

384
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:25,449
PAPUA NEW GUINEA, THE OTHER, A 

385
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:26,150
TINY REPUBLIC WITH A POPULATION 

386
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,850
OF 10,000, THEY HAVE BEEN SENT 

387
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,518
TO THESE PLACES AND THEY REMAIN 

388
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,185
THERE, THERE ARE 1700 REFUGEES, 

389
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:28,852
MANY FOUND BY INTERNATIONAL LAW 

390
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:29,520
TO BE REFUGEES, WITH NO HOPE OF 

391
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,120
EVER LEAVING AT THE MOMENT. 

392
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,788

393
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:31,388

SOME OF THESE AREAS, IN THESE 

397
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:33,924
DETENTION CENTERS AND THE FACT 

398
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:34,591
THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL RECOURSE 

399
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:35,292

400

404
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,095

405
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:38,629

406
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,329
INDIVIDUAL MERMEN WERE SENT OFF 

407

408
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:40,431
IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA. 

409
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,065
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE SUPREME 

410
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,565

411
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:42,199
DETENTION FACILITY WAS ILLEGAL 

412
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:42,833
UNDER PAPUA NEW GUINEA LAW SO 

413
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,467
THEY HAVE BEEN UNWINDING THOSE 

414
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,101

415
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:44,702
DOWN THE CAMP IN PAPUA NEW 

416
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,302

417
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:45,903
PEOPLE, 700 MEN, ESSENTIALLY 

418
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,537

WELL-RECEIVED IN GENERAL BY THE 

421
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:48,372
LOCAL POPULATION, THERE HAS 

422
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:49,039
BEEN VIOLENCE AGAINST THEM AND 

423
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,673
IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE WITH

424
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:50,340
NO PROSPECT OF GOING ANYWHERE 

425
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,008
ELSE EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. DEAL 

426

428
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:52,876

429
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:53,544
THEY ARE BASICALLY STUCK THERE, 

430
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,178
EFFECTIVELY A PERSON FOR THEM. 

431
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:54,745

CONTENTION IN THE UNITED STATES 

433
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,113
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS 

434
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:56,513
ON THE DEAL THAT

435
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:57,181
TURNBULL STRUCK WITH PRESIDENT 

436
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:57,715
OBAMA TO SWAP REFUGEES -- 

437
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,348
REALLY GOT A LOT OF PLAY, THE 

438
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:58,882
LEAKED COMMENTS FROM THAT 

439
00:31:58,882 --> 00:31:59,349

440
00:31:59,349 --> 00:31:59,850
AUSTRALIANS VIEW THAT? 

441
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,517
>> I THINK AT THE TIME, REMEMBER

442
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:01,185
THIS IS THE FIRST ACTUAL PHONE 

443
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:01,852

444
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:02,319
AND THE NEWLY ARRIVED 

445
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:02,619
PRESIDENT. 

446
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:03,220
AUSTRALIANS OF ALL POLITICAL 

447
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,721
COLORS GENERALLY FEEL 

448
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,388
THEMSELVES TO BE CLOSE TO THE 

449
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:04,755
UNITED STATES. 

450
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:05,289
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT 

451
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:05,756
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS A 

452
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:06,390
REPUBLICAN, THE GOVERNMENT IN 

453
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:06,924
OFFICE WAS ESSENTIALLY A 

454
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:07,458
CONSERVATIVE COALITION, 

455
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,092
EFFECTIVELY SIBLING POLITICAL 

456
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:08,726
PARTIES, THEY SHOULD BE CLOSE. 

457
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:09,393
SO THE THEATER OF THE SCENE OF 

458
00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:10,060
THAT TERSE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE 

459
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,494
NEW PRESIDENT AND A 

460
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:11,161
CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER WAS 

461
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:11,795
A SOURCE OF GREAT FASCINATION 

462
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:11,995
HERE. 

463
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:12,663
IT WAS PERHAPS AN EARLY INSIGHT 

464
00:32:12,663 --> 00:32:13,263
INTO HOW DIFFERENT PRESIDENT 

465
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:13,897
TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE TO HIS 

466
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:14,465
PREDECESSORS IN THE WAY HE 

467
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,099
HANDLED FRIENDSHIPS, ALLIANCES 

468
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:15,699
AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS. 

469
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:16,266
I THINK THAT WAS OF MORE 

470
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:16,867
INTEREST THAN THE DETAIL OF 

471
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:17,568
TRYING TO STITCH UP AND AFFIRM 

472
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,001
THAT REFUGEE DEAL. 

473
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:18,702
>> LET ME ASK YOU, WHEN IT WAS 

474
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:19,336
ANNOUNCED, THERE WAS A LOT OF 

475
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:19,937
PUSHBACK FROM THE REFUGEES 

476
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:20,604

477
00:32:20,604 --> 00:32:21,271

478
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:21,705
COME TO AMERICA. 

479
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:22,339
AND THOSE WHO APPLIED, NOT ALL 

480
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:22,940
OF THEM HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED. 

481
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,540
WHAT'S THE LATEST ON THIS? 

482
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,208
>> WELL, SOME DIDN'T WANT TO 

483
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:24,675
APPLY, OTHERS DID. 

484
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:25,275

ACCEPTED. 

486
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,176
BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, EVEN IF 

487
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:26,810
THE SUBJECT OF EXTREME VETTING 

488
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:27,478
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTED 

489
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,078
UPON, THE FULL 1250 MAXIMUM 

490
00:32:28,078 --> 00:32:28,645
WHICH WAS ALLOWED UNDER THE 

491
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:29,279
OBAMA DEAL WERE TO BE TAKEN, 

492
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:29,947
THAT WOULD LEAVE OTHERS ON THE 

493
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:30,614

494
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:31,148
1700 ON THOSE ISLANDS. 

495
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:31,682

498
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:33,517
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE 

499
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:34,218
ONCE THEY GET CITIZENSHIP, THEY 

500
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:34,885

501

TWO COUNTRIES. 

503
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:36,520

505
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:37,755

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,638
WE NEED DEMOCRATS -- THEY WILL 

1281
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:35,205
DO ANYTHING TO OBSTRUCT, 

1282
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:35,739
ANYTHING TO MAKE IT AS 

1283
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:36,273
UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE 

1284
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:36,973
-- BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S GOOD 

1285
00:39:36,973 --> 00:39:37,240
POLITICS. 

1286
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,807
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BAD 

1287
00:39:37,807 --> 00:39:38,074
POLITICS. 

1288
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:38,575
WE WILL SEE VERY SOON. 

1289
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:39,009
WE'RE BUILDING IT. 

1290
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:39,543
WE ARE BUILDING THE WALL. 

1291
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,076
THAT WALL IS HAPPENING. 

1292
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:40,510
UNDER THE PREVIOUS 

1293
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,178
ADMINISTRATION, AMERICA'S RICH, 

1294
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:41,845
NATURAL RESOURCES OF WHICH YOUR 

1295
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:42,512
STATE HAS A LOT, WERE PUT UNDER 

1296
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:43,046
LOCK AND KEY INCLUDING 

1297
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:43,713
THOUSANDS OF ACRES IN SUPERIOR 

1298
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:44,381
NATIONAL FOREST, YOU KNOW WHERE 

1299
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:44,781
THAT IS, RIGHT? 

1300
00:39:44,781 --> 00:39:45,448
TONIGHT, I'M PROUDLY ANNOUNCING 

1301
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:46,149
THAT WE WILL SOON BE TAKING THE 

1302
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:46,716
FIRST STEPS TO RESCIND THE 

1303
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:47,117
FEDERAL WITHDRAWAL

1304
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:47,717
IN SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST. 

1305
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:48,418
AND RESTORE MINERAL EXPLORATION 

1306
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:48,985
FOR OUR AMAZING PEOPLE AND 

1307
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:49,619
MINERS AND WORKERS AND FOR THE 

1308
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,287
PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, ONE OF THE 

1309
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:50,921
GREAT NATURAL RESERVES OF THE 

1310
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:51,154
WORLD. 

1311
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:51,755
AND WE'LL D IT CAREFULLY AND 

1312
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:52,355
MAYBE THEY FIT DOESN'T PASS 

1313
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,056
MUSTER, WE WON'T DO IT AT ALL, 

1314
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:53,690
BUT IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN, I 

1315
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,090
WILL TELL YOU. 

1316
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,624
AND IT'S HAPPENING FAST. 

1317
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,258
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN IT, AS YOU 

1318
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:55,926
KNOW, A LONG WAY DOWN THE ROAD. 

1319
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,560
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS 

1320
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:56,793
BETTER. 

1321
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:57,460
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT FROM AN 

1322
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,994
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT, 

1323
00:39:57,994 --> 00:39:58,228
BETTER. 

1324
00:39:58,228 --> 00:39:58,895
AS A RESULT OF OUR MASSIVE TAX 

1325
00:39:58,895 --> 00:39:59,563
CUTS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE 

1326
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,096
RECEIVING MUCH BIGGER 

1327
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:00,397
PAYCHECKS. 

1328
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:00,730
MUCH BIGGER. 

1329
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,364
WE'VE ELIMINATED RECORD NUMBERS 

1330
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:01,965
OF JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 

1331
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:02,632
BY THE WAY, SO A FEW DAYS AGO, 

1332
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:03,066
IT WAS 500 DAYS. 

1333
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:03,567
SO NOW IT'S LIKE 511. 

1334
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,201
IN 500 DAYS, WE'VE CUT MORE 

1335
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:04,901
REGULATIONS THAN ANY A -- THAN 

1336
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:05,535
ANY PRESIDENT WHEN THE HISTORY 

1337
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:06,169
OF OUR COUNTRY, WHETHER IT'S 

1338
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:06,770
FOR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS OR IN 

1339
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:07,037
ONE YEAR. 

1340
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:07,571
IN ONE CASE, 16 YEARS. 

1341
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,205
WE'VE CUT MORE REGULATIONS IN 

1342
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:08,838
500 DAYS THAN ANY PRESIDENT. 

1343
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:09,439
EVEN OUR 16-YEAR PRESIDENT. 

1344
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:09,973
WE'VE OPENED UP ENERGY 

1345
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:10,640
EXPLORATION IN ANWR IN ALASKA. 

1346
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,308
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT 

1347
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:11,975
FROM BEFORE THE DAYS OF RONALD 

1348
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:12,209
REAGAN. 

1349
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:12,676
COULDN'T GET IT DONE. 

1350
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:13,243
WE REPEALED THE CORE OF 

1351
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:13,810
OBAMACARE, THE INDIVIDUAL 

1352
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,077
MANDATE. 

1353
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:14,344
IS GONE. 

1354
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:14,678
SO UNPOPULAR. 

1355
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,312
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, WHERE 

1356
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:15,845
YOU PAY A FORTUNE FOR THE 

1357
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:16,446
PRIVILEGE OF NOT PAYING FOR 

1358
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:17,013
INSURANCE, FOR HEALTHCARE. 

1359
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:17,681
AND LET ME TELL YOU, WE JUST 

1360
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,315
REPEALED IT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO 

1361
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:18,648
PAY ANYMORE. 

1362
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:18,915
SO BIG. 

1363
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:19,182
SO BIG. 

1364
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:19,849
AND WE WOULD HAVE REPEALED AND 

1365
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:20,483
REPLACED OBAMACARE, ALTHOUGH 

1366
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:21,117
WE'VE GONE A LONG WAY TOWARD 

1367
00:40:21,117 --> 00:40:21,818
DOING THAT ANYWAY, WE HAD TO DO 

1368
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:22,519
IT ON A LONGER ROUTE -- BECAUSE 

1369
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,153
WE HAD A GENTLEMAN LATE INTO 

1370
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:23,753
THE MORNING HOURS GO THUMBS 

1371
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:23,954
DOWN. 

1372
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:24,588
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING HE 

1373
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:24,788
DID. 

1374
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:25,422
THAT WAS NOT A GOOD THING FOR 

1375
00:40:25,422 --> 00:40:26,022
OUR PEOPLE, FOR OUR COUNTRY, 

1376
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:26,590
WHETHER YOU'RE DEMOCRAT OR 

1377
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:26,890
REPUBLICAN. 

1378
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,490
AND EVERYBODY SAID, OH, GOOD, 

1379
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,058
WE HAVE HIS VOTE, WE HAVE 

1380
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:28,725
EVERYBODY'S VOTE, WE WERE GOING 

1381
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:29,326
IN FOR A ROUTINE REPEAL AND 

1382
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:29,893
REPLACE AND HE WENT, THUMBS 

1383
00:40:29,893 --> 00:40:30,093
DOWN. 

1384
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:30,360
NOT NICE. 

1385
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,061
THAT WAS NOT -- WE ARE BRINGING 

1386
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:31,628
BACK OUR JOBS FROM OTHER 

1387
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:31,928
COUNTRIES. 

1388
00:40:31,928 --> 00:40:32,462
WE ARE BRINGING BACK OUR 

1389
00:40:32,462 --> 00:40:33,163
COMPANIES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. 

1390
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:33,697
CHRYSLER IS COMING BACK. 

1391
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,364
CHRYSLER JUST ANNOUNCED THEY'RE 

1392
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:34,698
COMING BACK. 

1393
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:35,365
MANY, MANY COMPANIES ARE COMING 

1394
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:35,865
BACK TO OUR COUNTRY. 

1395
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:36,533
THEY KNOW WHERE THE ACTION IS. 

1396
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,200
THIS IS WHERE THEY WANT TO BE. 

1397
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,734
AND AS FAR AS TRADE IS 

1398
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:38,235
CONCERNED, WITH OTHER 

1399
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:38,868

RECIPROCAL TRADE, WE DON'T WANT 

1401
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:40,270
STUPID TRADE LIKE WE HAD FOR SO 

1402
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,470
LONG. 

1403
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,804
STUPID TRADE. 

1404
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:41,371
>> [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

1405
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:41,871
>> REMEMBER THE WORD 

1406
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:42,172
RECIPROCAL. 

1407
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:42,806
REMEMBER THE WORD RECIPROCAL. 

1408
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:43,406
WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF BY 

1409
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:44,074
ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH. 

1410
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:44,674
OUR FRIENDS AND OUR ENEMIES. 

1411
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:45,242
AND I HATE TO SAY IT, OUR 

1412
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:45,909
FRIENDS TO A BIGGER AND BETTER 

1413
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:46,409
JOB THAN THE ENEMIES. 

1414
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:46,943
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 

1415
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:47,410
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 

1416
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,044
AND EVEN BEFORE WE FINISH OFF 

1417
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:48,678
WITH THE TRADE DEALS, AND WE 

1418
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:49,346
WILL FINISH OFF WITH THE TRADE

DEALS, PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WE 

1420
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,380
HAVE THE CARDS. 

1421
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,014
BECAUSE WE ARE THE PIGGY BANK 

1422
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:51,648
THAT EVERYBODY WAS ROBBING FOR 

1423
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:51,948
30 YEARS. 

1424
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:52,549
WE ARE LIKE THE PIGGY BANK, 

1425
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:53,049
LET'S GO GET SOME MORE. 

1426
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:53,750
YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN UNION, 

1427
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,484
THEY PUT UP BARRIERS SO THAT WE 

1428
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:55,151
CAN SELL OUR FARM PRODUCTS IN. 

1429
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:55,819
AND YET THEY SELL MERCEDES AND 

1430
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:56,486
BMW AND THE CARS COME IN BY THE 

1431
00:40:56,486 --> 00:40:56,753
MILLIONS. 

1432
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:57,454
AND WE HARDLY TAX THEM AT ALL. 

1433
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,088
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR CARS, AND 

1434
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:58,822
IF THEY DO, THE TAXES -- TAX IS 

1435
00:40:58,822 --> 00:40:59,089
MASSIVE. 

1436
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,723
THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING, WE'RE 

1437
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:00,390
GOING TO SELL YOU MILLIONS OF 

1438
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,024
CARS, BY THE WAY, YOU'RE NOT 

1439
00:41:01,024 --> 00:41:01,524
GOING TO SELL AS ANY. 

1440
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:02,125
NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY 

1441
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:02,492
ANYMORE, FOLKS. 

1442
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,059
NOT GOING TO WORK THAT WAY. 

1443
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:03,727
WE WILL NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 

1444
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,060
OF ANYMORE. 

1445
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,694
WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY, WE'RE 

1446
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:05,328
GOING TO BE AN EVEN GREATER 

1447

00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:06,529
WE'VE EVER BEEN BEFORE. 

1449
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:07,030
WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL. 

1450
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,697
WE JUST SECURED A RECORD $700

1477
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:22,479
YOU COULD NEVER FIRE ANYBODY,
