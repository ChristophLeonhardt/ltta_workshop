00:00:02,801 --> 00:00:03,870
RANKING MEMBER.

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,804
LET'S DROP IN NOW.

NINE: 40:00 A.M.

7
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,648
>> WE DID HAVE SOME MOTIONS FOR.

8
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:20,520
IF YOU REMEMBER, I SAID THAT I

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,922
WILL GIVE THE MINORITY A CHANCE

10
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,291
TO MAKE THEIR MOTIONS.

11
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,261
AND THEN I WAS GOING TO MAKE A

12
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,395
MOTION THAT WE HAVE A TIME

13
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,697

14
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:36,302
SO I WANT TO MAKE THAT TIME

15
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:36,802
CERTAIN TO VOTE.

16
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:42,008
BUT IF THERE IS MOTION FROM A

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,077
MINORITY, I WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT

18
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:44,510
MOTION FIRST.

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,845
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

20
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,546
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO

21
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,348
SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE AS A WITNESS

00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:53,853
BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE.

23
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,755
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK TO IT.

24
00:00:55,755 --> 00:01:06,299
>> HOLDS JUST A MINUTE.

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,837

00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:11,937

29
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,408
PROCEED.

30
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,777
>> YES, MR. CHAIRMAN.

31
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,911
THANK YOU.

WE HEARD YESTERDAY FROM AN

33
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:27,220
EXTRAORDINARILY COURAGEOUS,

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,355
STRONG SURVIVOR, DR. CHRISTINE

35
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,223
BLASEY FORD.

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,493
EVERYONE OF US, I THINK, WERE

37
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:38,598
RIVETED AND POWERFULLY IMPRESSED

38
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,799
BY HER.

39
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,801
WE HEARD HER PROVIDE DETAILS IN

40
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,035
THE STORY THAT CAN BE

41
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:46,205
CORROBORATED AND OTHER FACTS

42
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,573
THAT CAN BE UNCOVERED IF WE HEAR

43
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:52,011
FROM OTHER WITNESSES.

44
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,012
WHO HAVE VERY RELEVANT,

45
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,181
IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT

46
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:55,548
HAPPENED.

47
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:59,986
ON THAT EVENING IN THAT ROOM.

48
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,387
THE THIRD PERSON ALLEGEDLY IN

49
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,857
THE ROOM WAS MARK JUDGE.

50
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,794
EVIDENTLY, HE HAS NEVER BEEN

51
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,130
INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI, HE HAS

52
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,832
NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY ANY

53
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:17,103
MEMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE.

54
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,206
HE HAS NEVER SUBMITTED A

55
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,141
DETAILED ACCOUNT OF WHAT HE

56
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,944
KNOWS.

57
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:28,614
AND SO, I MOVE THAT WE HAVE HIM

58
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:30,616
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS A

59
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,017
WITNESS.

60
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,252
HE COULD BE INTERVIEWED

61
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,387
BEFOREHAND ON A BIPARTISAN

62
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:34,687
BASIS.

63
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,721
I RECOGNIZE THAT HE HAS

64
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:43,129
SUBMITTED A CURSORY SIX SENTENCE

65
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:43,463
LETTER.

66
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,263
NOT EVEN SIGNED BY HIM, IT IS

67
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:47,500
FROM HIS ATTORNEY.

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,103
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A

69
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,838
RESPONSIBILITY TO SUBPOENA, AT

70
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,142
THE VERY LEAST, MARK JUDGE,

71
00:02:56,142 --> 00:03:00,012
BEFORE WE MOVED TO VOTE.

72
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,581
IT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO

73
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,950
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO UNCOVER

74
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,584
THE TRUTH AFTER HEARING

75
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,353
YESTERDAY THAT COMPELLING

76
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:13,426
TESTIMONY FROM DR. BLASEY FORD.

77
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,694
AND WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

78
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,397
VOTE WITHOUT HEARING AT LEAST

79
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,664
FROM MARK JUDGE.

80
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,833
I WOULD SUBMIT WITH ALL DUE

81
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,867
RESPECT, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT

82
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,803
THERE ARE OTHER WITNESSES WHO

83
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,804
ARE ESSENTIAL FOR US TO HEAR

84
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,104
FROM.

85
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:29,475
WE SHOULD HEAR FROM THE OTHER

86
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,912
SOUL SURVIVORS WHO HAVE COME

87
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,546
FORWARD WITH CREDIBLE AND

88
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,451
POWERFUL STORIES.

89
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,319
AND THAT'S WILL BE ALSO IN MY

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,222
VIEW NECESSARY, BUT TODAY, I AM

91
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:46,392
MOVING THAT WE SUBPOENA MARK

92
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:46,692

93
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,894
>> BEFORE WE VOTE, I WILL READ A

94
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:50,897
LETTER THAT WE RECEIVED FROM

95
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,200

IT "AS I STATED, I DID NOT ASK

97
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:05,812
TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER,

98
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,347
NOR DID ANYONE ASK ME TO BE

99
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:08,981
INVOLVED.

100
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:09,815
TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT I DO

101
00:04:09,815 --> 00:04:12,985
WANT TO COMMENT.

102
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:13,886
WHEN I TOLD THE COMMITTEE THAT I

103
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,355
DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT

104
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:20,593
THESE EVENTS PUBLICLY, AS A

STRUGGLED WITH DEPRESSION AND

108

AS A RESULT, I HAVE FOR SPEAKIN

00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,168
SPEAKING.

111
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:29,835
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I WERE

112
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,004
FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

113
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:32,905
BUT WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN DIRECTLY

114
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,208
IN SEVERAL YEARS.

115
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,577
I DO NOT RECALL THE EVENTS

THIS IS THE STORY THAT FOR SO

148
03:48:42,308 --> 03:48:44,843
MANY LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL,

149
03:48:44,843 --> 03:48:47,813
WILL HELP DEFINE WHO THEY ARE.

150
03:48:47,813 --> 03:48:49,482
THEY'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THEIR

151
03:48:49,482 --> 03:48:50,349
CONSTITUENTS THROUGH A PROCESS

152
03:48:50,349 --> 03:48:51,617

FIRST TIME YESTERDAY.

154
03:48:54,620 --> 03:48:56,488
WE SAW JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH ON

155
03:48:56,488 --> 03:48:57,423
THE HILL TALKING ABOUT

156
03:48:57,423 --> 03:48:59,392
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM MADE BY

157
03:48:59,392 --> 03:49:01,661
A WOMAN BY THE NAME OF

158
03:49:01,661 --> 03:49:02,428
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.

159
03:49:02,428 --> 03:49:05,064
WE HEARD FROM BOTH OF THEM IN A

160
03:49:05,064 --> 03:49:06,766
HEARING YESTERDAY AND IT WAS

161
03:49:06,766 --> 03:49:09,401
HEATED AND TODAY WAS HEATED

162
03:49:09,401 --> 03:49:12,672
AGAIN AS PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEIR

163
03:49:12,672 --> 03:49:13,739
VOTE, THEIR CONSTITUENTS AT

164
03:49:13,739 --> 03:49:17,243
HOME, AND ALSO THEIR IMPRESSION

165
03:49:17,243 --> 03:49:19,645
OF THOSE TWO PEOPLE.

TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.

169
03:49:24,850 --> 03:49:28,354
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW

170
03:49:28,354 --> 03:49:29,221
OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS IMPRESSION

171
03:49:29,221 --> 03:49:29,922
GATHERING FOR WHAT SOME HAVE

172
03:49:29,922 --> 03:49:33,826
DESCRIBED AS A JOB INTERVIEW.

173
03:49:33,826 --> 03:49:34,560
SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY CALLED IT

175
03:49:40,633 --> 03:49:42,802

03:49:42,802 --> 03:49:43,736
PHRASES CAN, HARRIS, AND GOOD

177
03:49:43,736 --> 03:49:47,273
AFTERNOON TO YOU.

178
03:49:47,273 --> 03:49:49,008
IT APPEARED THAT THE NOMINATION

179
03:49:49,008 --> 03:49:49,842
OF BRETT KAVANAUGH TO THE

180
03:49:49,842 --> 03:49:51,110
SUPREME COURT WAS GOING TO PASS

03:49:51,110 --> 03:49:51,811

182
03:49:51,811 --> 03:49:55,648

TEN DEMOCRATS AGAINST.

185
03:50:01,220 --> 03:50:03,055
THAT SEEMED TO BE SEALED WHEN

186
03:50:03,055 --> 03:50:04,890
JEFF FLAKE, THE ONE WAVERING

187
03:50:04,890 --> 03:50:07,860
REPUBLICAN INDICATED THIS

03:50:07,860 --> 03:50:09,895
MORNING THAT HE WAS GOING TO

03:50:09,895 --> 03:50:11,030
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

190
03:50:11,030 --> 03:50:13,632
HOWEVER, AFTER HE ANNOUNCED

191
03:50:13,632 --> 03:50:15,267
THAT, AND DEMOCRATS WERE VERY

192
03:50:15,267 --> 03:50:16,202
UPSET, A COUPLE OF THEM

193
03:50:16,202 --> 03:50:18,804
LITERALLY WERE ON THE VERGE OF

194
03:50:18,804 --> 03:50:19,238
TEARS.

195
03:50:19,238 --> 03:50:20,606
AFTER THEY HAD THEIR FIRST

196
03:50:20,606 --> 03:50:21,573
MEETING THIS MORNING, A NUMBER

197
03:50:21,573 --> 03:50:24,410
OF THE DEMOCRATS WALKED OUT

198
03:50:24,410 --> 03:50:25,044
WHILE OTHERS WERE MAKING

199
03:50:25,044 --> 03:50:28,181
SPEECHES AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

200
03:50:28,181 --> 03:50:29,281
CORRAL SENATOR FLAKE INTO A SIDE

201
03:50:29,281 --> 03:50:33,619
ROOM THERE IN THE SENATE AND

202
03:50:33,619 --> 03:50:34,753
THEY WERE LOBBYING HIM, HARDER,

203
03:50:34,753 --> 03:50:37,022
TO TRY TO SWITCH HIS VOTE AND

204
03:50:37,022 --> 03:50:39,691
PERSUADE HIM NOT TO VOTE FOR

205
03:50:39,691 --> 03:50:41,794
KAVANAUGH AND FLAKE HAS NOT BEEN

206
03:50:41,794 --> 03:50:43,863
BACK SINCE.

207
03:50:43,863 --> 03:50:45,531
WHAT WE DO EXPECT, AND AS I SAY,

208
03:50:45,531 --> 03:50:47,065
HE MADE A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT

209
03:50:47,065 --> 03:50:48,600
TODAY THAT HE WAS GOING TO BACK

210
03:50:48,600 --> 03:50:51,470
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE HE SAID WE

211
03:50:51,470 --> 03:50:52,738
HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PRESUMPTION

212
03:50:52,738 --> 03:50:53,439
OF INNOCENCE AND THERE WASN'T

213
03:50:53,439 --> 03:50:57,075
HARD TO PROVE OTHER THAN THE

214
03:50:57,075 --> 03:50:58,644
TESTIMONY OF CHRISTINE BLASEY

215
03:50:58,644 --> 03:50:59,779
FORD THAT THIS EVENT HAPPENED,

216
03:50:59,779 --> 03:51:01,713
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DOUBT AS

217
03:51:01,713 --> 03:51:02,481
TO WHETHER THE DEMOCRATS WERE

218
03:51:02,481 --> 03:51:06,152
ABLE TO GET HIM TO CHANGE HIS

219
03:51:06,152 --> 03:51:09,021
MIND.

220
03:51:09,021 --> 03:51:10,756
>> Harris: YOU ARE TALKING

221
03:51:10,756 --> 03:51:12,858
ABOUT THE TEARS, I THINK YOU

222
03:51:12,858 --> 03:51:15,728
MEAN SENATOR CHRIS, WHO WATCHED

223
03:51:15,728 --> 03:51:17,329
AND HE WAS ON THE VERGE OF

224
03:51:17,329 --> 03:51:17,629
TEARS.

225
03:51:17,629 --> 03:51:19,331
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT

226
03:51:19,331 --> 03:51:21,667
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD.

227
03:51:21,667 --> 03:51:22,935
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS VOTE

228
03:51:22,935 --> 03:51:24,737
RIGHT NOW AND WE WILL KNOW IN

229
03:51:24,737 --> 03:51:26,672
JUST A FEW MOMENTS IF IT DOES

230
03:51:26,672 --> 03:51:27,906
SHAKE OUT 11-10 OR SOMEHOW

231
03:51:27,906 --> 03:51:31,043
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, WE WILL

232
03:51:31,043 --> 03:51:32,812
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE BRETT

233
03:51:32,812 --> 03:51:33,546
KAVANAUGH WILL BE FULL SENATE

234
03:51:33,546 --> 03:51:37,983
VOTE NEXT WEEK TO BECOME THE

235
03:51:37,983 --> 03:51:39,985
NEXT JUSTICE ON THE

236
03:51:39,985 --> 03:51:40,452
SUPREME COURT.

237
03:51:40,452 --> 03:51:42,855
WHERE DO WE STAND IN WASHINGTON

238
03:51:42,855 --> 03:51:44,323
WITH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO WORK

239
03:51:44,323 --> 03:51:45,257
THINGS OUT?

240
03:51:45,257 --> 03:51:48,027
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY, REALLY

241
03:51:48,027 --> 03:51:48,460
NASTY, CHRIS.

242
03:51:48,460 --> 03:51:50,062
>> LET ME TALK FIRST OF ALL

243
03:51:50,062 --> 03:51:52,231
ABOUT THE PROCESS BECAUSE EVEN

244
03:51:52,231 --> 03:51:55,868
IF THEY WERE TO VOTE NOT TO

245
03:51:55,868 --> 03:51:56,802
REFER THE NOMINATION OF BRETT

246
03:51:56,802 --> 03:51:57,937
KAVANAUGH, THAT WOULD NOT STOP

247
03:51:57,937 --> 03:51:59,438
THE SENATE FROM TAKING A VOTE.

248
03:51:59,438 --> 03:52:03,042
IF YOU WERE TO GO DOWN 11-10

249
03:52:03,042 --> 03:52:03,709
RATHER THAN REPORTED OUT

250
03:52:03,709 --> 03:52:06,378
FAVORABLY 11-10, IT CAN STILL BE

251
03:52:06,378 --> 03:52:07,613
BROUGHT TO THE SENATE FLOOR IN

252
03:52:07,613 --> 03:52:08,914
THE WAY THAT WOULD WORK IS THAT

253
03:52:08,914 --> 03:52:12,318
TOMORROW IT WOULD BE BROUGHT UP

254
03:52:12,318 --> 03:52:15,621
AND ON MONDAY THERE WOULD BE A

255
03:52:15,621 --> 03:52:18,057
VOTE TO CUT OFF DEBATE AND THE

256
03:52:18,057 --> 03:52:19,859
CONFIRMATION WOULD HAPPEN ON

257
03:52:19,859 --> 03:52:20,192
TUESDAY.

258
03:52:20,192 --> 03:52:21,293
AS BRET BAIER MENTIONED A FEW

259
03:52:21,293 --> 03:52:22,628
MOMENTS AGO, THERE IS STILL SOME

260
03:52:22,628 --> 03:52:26,932
DOUBT ABOUT TWO MODERATE WOMEN

261
03:52:26,932 --> 03:52:28,967
IN THE SENATE, REPUBLICAN WOMEN,

262
03:52:28,967 --> 03:52:29,935
LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA AND

263
03:52:29,935 --> 03:52:32,805
SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE.

264
03:52:32,805 --> 03:52:34,573
WE DON'T KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT

265
03:52:34,573 --> 03:52:36,375
ANNOUNCED.

266
03:52:36,375 --> 03:52:38,744
SUSAN COLLINS AS OF LATE MORNING

267
03:52:38,744 --> 03:52:40,179
HAS SAID SHE IS STILL UNDECIDED

268
03:52:40,179 --> 03:52:41,413
ON THIS AND I SUSPECT IF WE ARE

269
03:52:41,413 --> 03:52:43,816
NOT GOING TO HAVE US UNTIL

270
03:52:43,816 --> 03:52:45,217
TUESDAY SHE WILL HEAR FROM A LOT

271
03:52:45,217 --> 03:52:48,053
OF CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IN

272
03:52:48,053 --> 03:52:49,054
MAINE.

273
03:52:49,054 --> 03:52:50,422
AS FAR AS RELATIONS ON

274
03:52:50,422 --> 03:52:52,591
CAPITOL HILL AND BETWEEN THE TWO

275
03:52:52,591 --> 03:52:53,792
PARTIES, YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT AS

276
03:52:53,792 --> 03:52:54,560
UGLY AS I'VE EVER SEEN IT AND

277
03:52:54,560 --> 03:52:57,229
I'VE BEEN IN THIS TOWN FOR 40

278
03:52:57,229 --> 03:52:58,430
YEARS.

279
03:52:58,430 --> 03:53:00,199
YOU'VE SEEN SPIRITED DEBATES,

280
03:53:00,199 --> 03:53:02,168
SOME ANGRY DEBATES, BUT

281
03:53:02,168 --> 03:53:06,772
YESTERDAY WAS UGLY AND BITTER.

282
03:53:06,772 --> 03:53:08,807
AND PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU SAW

283
03:53:08,807 --> 03:53:11,910
LINDSEY GRAHAM SNAP BACK AFTER

284
03:53:11,910 --> 03:53:15,848
THESE ATTACKS BY DEMOCRATS ON

285
03:53:15,848 --> 03:53:17,283
KAVANAUGH WHEN THEY WERE TALKING

286
03:53:17,283 --> 03:53:18,817
ABOUT DRINKING GAMES AND HIS

287
03:53:18,817 --> 03:53:19,384
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK.

288
03:53:19,384 --> 03:53:20,819
AND HE SAID THIS IS THE MOST

289
03:53:20,819 --> 03:53:21,553
DESPICABLE THING I'VE EVER SEEN

290
03:53:21,553 --> 03:53:25,224
IN THIS TOWN AND ANY REPUBLICAN

291
03:53:25,224 --> 03:53:28,026
WHO VOTES NO VOTES AGAINST THE

292
03:53:28,026 --> 03:53:32,831
NOMINATION IS LEGITIMIZING THAT,

293
03:53:32,831 --> 03:53:33,699
THIS ISN'T JUST PEOPLE PLAYING

294
03:53:33,699 --> 03:53:38,137
ON TV AND THEY GO AS IT OFTEN

295
03:53:38,137 --> 03:53:40,306
HAPPENS, HOPEFULLY SO, YOU CAN

296
03:53:40,306 --> 03:53:41,640
ARGUE ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND GO

297
03:53:41,640 --> 03:53:42,975
OUT AND HAVE A DRINK OR

298
03:53:42,975 --> 03:53:45,077
WHATEVER, I FEEL LIKE THERE IS

299
03:53:45,077 --> 03:53:47,079
SOME REAL ENMITY, SOME REAL

300
03:53:47,079 --> 03:53:48,314
GRUDGES THAT HAVE BEEN FORMED

301
03:53:48,314 --> 03:53:52,251
OVER THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

302
03:53:52,251 --> 03:53:53,886
>> Harris: I HAD ON

303
03:53:53,886 --> 03:53:55,220
SENATOR DAINES A FEW MINUTES AGO

304
03:53:55,220 --> 03:53:58,390
AND HE TALKED ABOUT CALLING

305
03:53:58,390 --> 03:53:59,158
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND GIVING

306
03:53:59,158 --> 03:53:59,925
HIS SUPPORT AND SAYING HOW PROUD

307
03:53:59,925 --> 03:54:00,359
HE WAS OF HIM.

308
03:54:00,359 --> 03:54:02,695
WE KNOW THERE BEEN SOME OTHER

309
03:54:02,695 --> 03:54:03,629
TYPES OF PHONE CALLS THAT HAVE

310
03:54:03,629 --> 03:54:07,265
GONE ON IN THIS PROCESS TODAY.

311
03:54:07,265 --> 03:54:10,035
YOU MENTIONED COLLINS AND THE

312
03:54:10,035 --> 03:54:14,273
OTHER WHAT WE WOULD CALL A SWING

313
03:54:14,273 --> 03:54:14,907
VOTER, GETTING CALLS FROM

314
03:54:14,907 --> 03:54:17,910
GEORGE W. BUSH AND CONDOLEEZZA

315
03:54:17,910 --> 03:54:20,446
RICE AND SOME SHORING UP, IF YOU

316
03:54:20,446 --> 03:54:20,746
WILL.

317
03:54:20,746 --> 03:54:21,480
HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR US TO

318
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:28,053
SEE THAT PROCESS PLAY OUT?

319
03:54:28,053 --> 03:54:29,455
SENATORS MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS

320
03:54:29,455 --> 03:54:30,155
THE TYPE THAT WOULD WATCH AND

321
03:54:30,155 --> 03:54:32,825
LISTEN TO THAT OR ARE THEY MORE

322
03:54:32,825 --> 03:54:34,293
FOCUSED ON FROM WHAT WE KNOW

323
03:54:34,293 --> 03:54:36,595
FROM REPORTING, MORE FOCUSED ON

324
03:54:36,595 --> 03:54:37,028
THAT HEARING?

325
03:54:37,028 --> 03:54:37,896
SOME ARE SAYING THEY WERE GOING

326
03:54:37,896 --> 03:54:39,698
TO HOLD OFF ON THEIR BOATS, NOW

327
03:54:39,698 --> 03:54:42,067
WE KNOW HOW JEFF FLAKE WILL VOTE

328
03:54:42,067 --> 03:54:43,068
AFTER THE HEARING.

329
03:54:43,068 --> 03:54:44,236
HE SAID HE WANTED TO HEAR WHAT

330
03:54:44,236 --> 03:54:47,840
BOTH PEOPLE HAD TO SAY.

331
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:49,842
>> THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW

332
03:54:49,842 --> 03:54:52,011
WHAT'S GOING TO GO INTO THEIR

333
03:54:52,011 --> 03:54:53,646
DECISION-MAKING.

334
03:54:53,646 --> 03:54:54,814
I THINK OBVIOUSLY MOST IMPORTANT

335
03:54:54,814 --> 03:54:55,747
WAS THAT HEARING, THEY BOTH SAID

336
03:54:55,747 --> 03:54:59,084
THEY WERE GOING TO WATCH IT, I

337
03:54:59,084 --> 03:55:00,886
SUSPECT THEY WERE GOING TO

338
03:55:00,886 --> 03:55:01,854
LISTEN TO PEOPLE THEY RESPECT ON

339
03:55:01,854 --> 03:55:02,454
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.

340
03:55:02,454 --> 03:55:06,958
IT'S INTERESTING THAT PRESIDENT

341
03:55:06,958 --> 03:55:07,659
PRESIDENT BUSH, BUSH 43 IS

342
03:55:07,659 --> 03:55:09,828
TALKING TO THEM, NEITHER OF THEM

343
03:55:09,828 --> 03:55:10,863
HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH

344
03:55:10,863 --> 03:55:11,597
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHEN

345
03:55:11,597 --> 03:55:12,297
PRESIDENT TRUMP ISSUED A TWEET

346
03:55:12,297 --> 03:55:15,267
LAST WEEKEND SAID LOOK, IF THESE

347
03:55:15,267 --> 03:55:18,403
CHARGES WERE SO SERIOUS, I'M

348
03:55:18,403 --> 03:55:22,074
SURE CHARGES WERE FILED RIGHT

349
03:55:22,074 --> 03:55:24,276
AWAY, HE KNEW NO CHARGES HAD

350
03:55:24,276 --> 03:55:24,810
BEEN FILED.

351
03:55:24,810 --> 03:55:25,944
SUSAN COLLINS SAID SHE WAS

352
03:55:25,944 --> 03:55:27,446
APPALLED BY THAT TWEET.

353
03:55:27,446 --> 03:55:31,750
IT MAY BE THAT SHE WOULDN'T

354
03:55:31,750 --> 03:55:34,353
PARTICULARLY BE PERSUADED BY

355
03:55:34,353 --> 03:55:35,954
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT SHE MIGHT BE

356
03:55:35,954 --> 03:55:37,089
BY GEORGE W. BUSH.

357
03:55:37,089 --> 03:55:38,824
THESE ARE SENATORS AND THEY ARE

358
03:55:38,824 --> 03:55:39,524
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO LISTEN TO

359
03:55:39,524 --> 03:55:41,059
THEIR CONSTITUENTS.

360
03:55:41,059 --> 03:55:42,627
THIS IS A DEEPLY FELT ISSUE ON

361
03:55:42,627 --> 03:55:46,899
PEOPLE'S MINDS, OBVIOUSLY THE

362
03:55:46,899 --> 03:55:48,634
COUNTRY WAS RIVETED TO THE

363
03:55:48,634 --> 03:55:50,035
TESTIMONY YESTERDAY, ONE ASSUMES

364
03:55:50,035 --> 03:55:50,769
THE VOTERS BACK HOME WE'LL TRY

365
03:55:50,769 --> 03:55:52,937
TO GET IN TOUCH.

366
03:55:52,937 --> 03:55:54,439
>> Harris: I WANT TO TALK TO

367
03:55:54,439 --> 03:55:55,874
WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE SCREEN

368
03:55:55,874 --> 03:55:58,243
RIGHT NOW, WE WERE POSTURED FOR

369
03:55:58,243 --> 03:56:01,246
A VOTE AT 1:30 P.M. EASTERN AND

370
03:56:01,246 --> 03:56:03,015
WE'VE SLID JUST A FEW MINUTES

371
03:56:03,015 --> 03:56:03,382
FROM THAT.

372
03:56:03,382 --> 03:56:06,452
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO SIT BY,

373
03:56:06,452 --> 03:56:07,653
STAY CLOSE, PLEASE.

374
03:56:07,653 --> 03:56:09,588
I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK.

375
03:56:09,588 --> 03:56:11,957
WE ARE SEEING SENATORS TAKE

376
03:56:11,957 --> 03:56:13,826
THEIR SEATS BUT WE ARE SEEING

377
03:56:13,826 --> 03:56:14,560
SOME GATHERING WITHIN THAT ROOM.

378
03:56:14,560 --> 03:56:18,496
IT'S A HEARING ROOM, NOT A

379
03:56:18,496 --> 03:56:18,863
COURTROOM.

380
03:56:18,863 --> 03:56:19,698
WHEN YOU SEE THIS, YOU ARE NOT

381
03:56:19,698 --> 03:56:23,735
GOING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW,

382
03:56:23,735 --> 03:56:25,337
THERE'S NOT ONE SIDE AND THEN

383
03:56:25,337 --> 03:56:30,876
THE OTHER.

384
03:56:30,876 --> 03:56:32,378
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REAP

385
03:56:32,378 --> 03:56:36,915
THE DECISIONS ABOUT A VERY

386
03:56:36,915 --> 03:56:39,785
IMPORTANT MATTER AND HAVE TO

387
03:56:39,785 --> 03:56:41,653
CONSIDER ALL THAT WENT ON THAT

388
03:56:41,653 --> 03:56:43,822
WAS REALLY SALACIOUS AT TIMES

389
03:56:43,822 --> 03:56:45,624
YESTERDAY.

390
03:56:45,624 --> 03:56:46,324
>> WE ARE GETTING INDICATIONS

391
03:56:46,324 --> 03:56:59,304
THAT SENATOR COONS FROM DELAWARE

392
03:56:59,304 --> 03:57:02,775
HAS PULLED SENATOR FLAKE,

393
03:57:02,775 --> 03:57:07,346
SENATOR FLAKE IS GOOD FRIENDS

394
03:57:07,346 --> 03:57:12,284
WITH SENATOR COONS.

395
03:57:12,284 --> 03:57:14,853
THERE MAY BE A CHANGE HERE.

396
03:57:14,853 --> 03:57:16,255
SINCE THAT TIME THEY'VE HAD A

397
03:57:16,255 --> 03:57:17,890
DISCUSSION ON THE SIDE, YOU CAN

398
03:57:17,890 --> 03:57:18,657
KIND OF SEE PEOPLE GATHERED IN

399
03:57:18,657 --> 03:57:25,163
THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

400
03:57:25,163 --> 03:57:26,098
SENATOR COONS HAS COME BACK INTO

401
03:57:26,098 --> 03:57:28,834
THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND HAS BEEN

402
03:57:28,834 --> 03:57:31,036
WHISPERING TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN,

403
03:57:31,036 --> 03:57:33,405
SENATOR DURBIN.

404
03:57:33,405 --> 03:57:35,774
ABOUT WHAT, WE DON'T KNOW.

405
03:57:35,774 --> 03:57:37,208
ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS WAS THAT

406
03:57:37,208 --> 03:57:39,144
DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY PUSHING FOR

407
03:57:39,144 --> 03:57:42,581
THIS DELAY FOR AT LEAST A WEEK

408
03:57:42,581 --> 03:57:44,149
TO LET THE FBI BACK INTO THE

409
03:57:44,149 --> 03:57:44,983
INVESTIGATION.

410
03:57:44,983 --> 03:57:47,186
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THAT?

411
03:57:47,186 --> 03:57:48,220
WE DON'T KNOW.

412
03:57:48,220 --> 03:57:49,254
SENATOR FLAKE IS NOW BACK IN THE

413
03:57:49,254 --> 03:57:51,723
ROOM AND NOW THIS VOTE IS SEVEN,

414
03:57:51,723 --> 03:57:53,625
8 MINUTES TILL EIGHT AND

415
03:57:53,625 --> 03:57:56,495
SENATOR GRASSLEY IS PRETTY TIME

416
03:57:56,495 --> 03:57:59,798
ORIENTED WHEN HE SAID 1:30.

417
03:57:59,798 --> 03:58:01,165
>> Harris: LET ME ASK YOU

418
03:58:01,165 --> 03:58:04,203
ABOUT SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR FROM

419
03:58:04,203 --> 03:58:05,270
MINNESOTA, BECAUSE SHE LAID IT

420
03:58:05,270 --> 03:58:06,037
OUT LIKE THE FORMER PROSECUTOR

421
03:58:06,037 --> 03:58:07,606
WE KNOW HER TO BE IN TERMS OF

422
03:58:07,606 --> 03:58:08,840
WHY YOU WOULD WANT THAT FBI

423
03:58:08,840 --> 03:58:12,511
INVESTIGATION TO EVEN HAPPEN

424
03:58:12,511 --> 03:58:12,778
NOW.

425
03:58:12,778 --> 03:58:13,412
AND SPEAKING TO A DELAY.

426
03:58:13,412 --> 03:58:15,147
IF DEMOCRATS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

427
03:58:15,147 --> 03:58:18,383
TO GET A DELAY, WE SAW

428
03:58:18,383 --> 03:58:19,418
YESTERDAY, WHAT ABOUT YESTERDAY

429
03:58:19,418 --> 03:58:21,520
WOULD AID THEM IN GETTING A

430
03:58:21,520 --> 03:58:25,190
DELAY?

431
03:58:25,190 --> 03:58:26,992
>> Bret: OF THE EMOTIONAL

432
03:58:26,992 --> 03:58:27,759
TESTIMONY OF DR. CHRISTINE BLASE

433
03:58:27,759 --> 03:58:30,562
FOR IT AND HOW SHE PRESENTED

434
03:58:30,562 --> 03:58:33,765
HERSELF AND I THINK WAS TO THEIR

435
03:58:33,765 --> 03:58:34,600
BENEFIT.

436
03:58:34,600 --> 03:58:36,602
OBVIOUSLY THE PROSECUTOR FROM

437
03:58:36,602 --> 03:58:38,703
ARIZONA, MISS MITCHELL KIND OF

438
03:58:38,703 --> 03:58:40,005
METHODICALLY CAUGHT SOME HOLES

439
03:58:40,005 --> 03:58:42,407
IN SOME OF THE THINGS SHE TALKED

440
03:58:42,407 --> 03:58:44,076
ABOUT, WHETHER SHE WAS GOING TO

441
03:58:44,076 --> 03:58:46,378
FLY OR NOT, THE WHOLE PROCESS

442
03:58:46,378 --> 03:58:47,412
ISSUED.

443
03:58:47,412 --> 03:58:49,181
THERE WERE TWO SIDES OF THIS,

444
03:58:49,181 --> 03:58:50,949
ONE IS THE STORY OF WHAT

445
03:58:50,949 --> 03:58:54,286
HAPPENED IN THE EARLY 1980s

446
03:58:54,286 --> 03:58:56,488
AND THE OTHER IS THE PROCESS OF

447
03:58:56,488 --> 03:58:58,223
HOW IT WAS DEALT WITH.

448
03:58:58,223 --> 03:59:00,626
WAS IT DEALT WITH TO GET PAST

449
03:59:00,626 --> 03:59:02,227
THE ELECTION SO DEMOCRATS CAN

450
03:59:02,227 --> 03:59:03,295
HOLD ON TO THE SENATE

451
03:59:03,295 --> 03:59:05,330
SUPREME COURT SEAT AND FIGHT

452
03:59:05,330 --> 03:59:08,967
ANOTHER BATTLE IN DECEMBER?

453
03:59:08,967 --> 03:59:09,734
I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE ARGUING,

454
03:59:09,734 --> 03:59:12,671
YOU HAD A CHANCE TO DEAL WITH

455
03:59:12,671 --> 03:59:15,173
THE FBI, YOU HAD A CHANCE IF

456
03:59:15,173 --> 03:59:15,840
SENATOR FEINSTEIN HAD THIS

457
03:59:15,840 --> 03:59:17,309
LETTER TO BRING US INTO THE

458
03:59:17,309 --> 03:59:19,811
PROCESS, YOU CHOSE NOT TO.

459
03:59:19,811 --> 03:59:21,413
NOW ON THE FINAL HOUR, TO

460
03:59:21,413 --> 03:59:23,247
DELAYED ANOTHER WEEK IS NOT

461
03:59:23,247 --> 03:59:23,548
FAIR.

462
03:59:23,548 --> 03:59:25,584
THE DEMOCRATS COULD'VE

463
03:59:25,584 --> 03:59:26,251
INVESTIGATED WITH THEIR OWN

464
03:59:26,251 --> 03:59:27,953
TEAMS ON THE JUDICIARY

465
03:59:27,953 --> 03:59:28,987
COMMITTEE, HAD THEIR OWN STAFF

466
03:59:28,987 --> 03:59:31,189
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND THEY

467
03:59:31,189 --> 03:59:32,257
DIDN'T DO IT.

468
03:59:32,257 --> 03:59:32,991
>> Harris: WITH RACHEL

469
03:59:32,991 --> 03:59:34,192
MITCHELL, THE POINT AT THE VERY

470
03:59:34,192 --> 03:59:37,195
END OF ALL HER QUESTIONING

471
03:59:37,195 --> 03:59:38,997
YESTERDAY WITH DR. CHRISTINE

472
03:59:38,997 --> 03:59:40,165
BLASE FORD, WAS IF YOU DID HAVE

473
03:59:40,165 --> 03:59:43,402
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN, IT

474
03:59:43,402 --> 03:59:44,202
WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MORE

475
03:59:44,202 --> 03:59:45,404
THAN WHAT SHE FELT AS A

476
03:59:45,404 --> 03:59:51,944
PROSECUTOR SPECIALIZING IN SEX

477
03:59:51,944 --> 03:59:56,648
CRIMES, SHE WAS ABLE TO

478
03:59:56,648 --> 03:59:57,849
ACCOMPLISH YESTERDAY.

479
03:59:57,849 --> 03:59:58,784
AMY KLOBUCHAR USED TO HAVE A

480
03:59:58,784 --> 04:00:00,585
SIMILAR JOB WAS LAYING OUT THE

481
04:00:00,585 --> 04:00:01,519
CASE FOR DEMOCRATS FOR WHY THIS

482
04:00:01,519 --> 04:00:05,123
NEEDS TO GO FORTH JUST A COUPLE

483
04:00:05,123 --> 04:00:06,024
DAYS.

484
04:00:06,024 --> 04:00:07,993
I HEARD THE LANGUAGE OF A WEEK

485
04:00:07,993 --> 04:00:08,527
EVEN BEING A DELAY.

486
04:00:08,527 --> 04:00:14,666
LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WALLACE NO

487
04:00:14,666 --> 04:00:15,366
NOW, AS THIS DELAY IS PLAYING

488
04:00:15,366 --> 04:00:18,970
OUT ON SCREEN, WE ARE 10 MINUTES

489
04:00:18,970 --> 04:00:20,439
BEYOND THAT VOTE, WE KNOW

490
04:00:20,439 --> 04:00:22,174
SENATOR GRASSLEY TO BE A

491
04:00:22,174 --> 04:00:24,576
STICKLER ABOUT TIME, WE SAW HIM

492
04:00:24,576 --> 04:00:26,077
SHORE UP THOSE SOMETIMES LENGTHY

493
04:00:26,077 --> 04:00:28,780
COMMENTS BY DEMOCRATS TODAY,

494
04:00:28,780 --> 04:00:29,547
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE GIVING EACH

495
04:00:29,547 --> 04:00:31,516
OTHER THEIR OWN TIME.

496
04:00:31,516 --> 04:00:34,786
BUT NOW A DELAY.

497
04:00:34,786 --> 04:00:36,321
IN THE VOID OF TIME, IF YOU

498
04:00:36,321 --> 04:00:41,393
WILL, POTENTIALLY YOU ARE SAYING

499
04:00:41,393 --> 04:00:42,995
THERE COULD BE SOME

500
04:00:42,995 --> 04:00:43,562
HORSETRADING.

501
04:00:43,562 --> 04:00:43,995
YOUR THOUGHTS?

502
04:00:43,995 --> 04:00:47,399
>> YES, YOU'RE ASKING WHY THERE

503
04:00:47,399 --> 04:00:48,366
WOULD BE A DELAY OR WHY THEY

504
04:00:48,366 --> 04:00:52,904
WOULD CONSIDER A WEEK DELAY,

505
04:00:52,904 --> 04:00:53,337
THEY WOULDN'T.

506
04:00:53,337 --> 04:00:54,806
EXCEPT FOR ONE REASON, WHICH IS

507
04:00:54,806 --> 04:00:57,809
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES.

508
04:00:57,809 --> 04:00:58,676
THEY WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE, ARE

509
04:00:58,676 --> 04:01:00,278
THEY GOING TO PRESS AHEAD WITH

510
04:01:00,278 --> 04:01:02,981
THIS VOTE EVEN IF IT TURNS OUT

511
04:01:02,981 --> 04:01:05,817
UNSUCCESSFULLY IF FLAKE WERE TO

512
04:01:05,817 --> 04:01:07,185
BE DEMANDING THAT AND THEY

513
04:01:07,185 --> 04:01:09,421
WOULDN'T AGREE TO THE FBI

514
04:01:09,421 --> 04:01:11,857
INVESTIGATION, BUT IF THEY GET

515
04:01:11,857 --> 04:01:14,326
WORD, AND I AM JUST SPECULATING

516
04:01:14,326 --> 04:01:17,629
NOW, THAT LISA MURKOWSKI WAS

517
04:01:17,629 --> 04:01:19,431
ALSO WANTING A DELAY OR SUSAN

518
04:01:19,431 --> 04:01:20,331
COLLINS ALSO WANTED THE DELAY,

519
04:01:20,331 --> 04:01:22,401
YOU WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE

520
04:01:22,401 --> 04:01:23,001
DELAY.

521
04:01:23,001 --> 04:01:24,970
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE 50 VOTES

522
04:01:24,970 --> 04:01:28,540
PLUS THE TIE-BREAKING VOTE OF

523
04:01:28,540 --> 04:01:30,008
VICE PRESIDENT PENCE, THEY MIGHT

524
04:01:30,008 --> 04:01:30,709
HAVE TO DELAY.

525
04:01:30,709 --> 04:01:33,511
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER REASON

526
04:01:33,511 --> 04:01:34,579
AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

527
04:01:34,579 --> 04:01:36,615
REPUBLICANS WOULD BE SO NERVOUS

528
04:01:36,615 --> 04:01:37,382
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WHAT WE SAW

529
04:01:37,382 --> 04:01:41,720
IN THE LAST WEEK WAS -- WHATEVER

530
04:01:41,720 --> 04:01:43,455
YOU THINK OF THE LEGITIMACY OF

531
04:01:43,455 --> 04:01:44,622
THE ALLEGATION BY CHRISTINE

532
04:01:44,622 --> 04:01:47,358
BLASEY FORD, THE ALLEGATIONS BY

533
04:01:47,358 --> 04:01:52,864
DEBORAH RAMIREZ AT YALE, JULIE

534
04:01:52,864 --> 04:01:58,236
SWETNICK, TALKING ABOUT GANG

535
04:01:58,236 --> 04:02:00,505
RAPE PARTIES SHE CONTINUE TO GO

536
04:02:00,505 --> 04:02:02,607
TO THAT SEEMED TO BE MUCH LESS

537
04:02:02,607 --> 04:02:03,608
CREDIBLE, YOU SAW A NUMBER OF

538
04:02:03,608 --> 04:02:03,909
THESE.

539
04:02:03,909 --> 04:02:06,911
YOU HAVE A WEEK DELAY, WHO KNOWS

540
04:02:06,911 --> 04:02:09,181
WHAT SOMEBODY IS GOING TO SAY.

541
04:02:09,181 --> 04:02:11,717
A DELAY IS THE ENEMY OF THIS

542
04:02:11,717 --> 04:02:13,318
CONFIRMATION AND REPUBLICANS ARE

543
04:02:13,318 --> 04:02:14,385
KEENLY AWARE OF THAT AND THE

544
04:02:14,385 --> 04:02:15,253
ONLY REASON I CAN IMAGINE THAT

545
04:02:15,253 --> 04:02:22,027
THEY WOULD AGREE TO THAT AS IF

546
04:02:22,027 --> 04:02:23,294
SOME OF THE KEY SWING VOTERS

547
04:02:23,294 --> 04:02:23,962
WERE DEMANDING IT.

548
04:02:23,962 --> 04:02:27,799
WE DON'T KNOW IT'S HAPPENING.

549
04:02:27,799 --> 04:02:29,901
>> Harris: I CAN SAY THIS

550
04:02:29,901 --> 04:02:30,935
ABOUT LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN

551
04:02:30,935 --> 04:02:32,136
COLLINS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

552
04:02:32,136 --> 04:02:33,638
IT'S BEEN REPORTED AND WE HAVE

553
04:02:33,638 --> 04:02:34,873
HEARD DIRECTLY FROM

554
04:02:34,873 --> 04:02:38,910
SENATOR COLLINS THAT SHE WANTED

555
04:02:38,910 --> 04:02:39,644
A SUBPOENA OF THIS MARK JUDGE,

556
04:02:39,644 --> 04:02:43,215
THIS FRIEND OF BRETT KAVANAUGH.

557
04:02:43,215 --> 04:02:44,850
WOULD THAT BE A STICKING POINT

558
04:02:44,850 --> 04:02:46,218
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT?

559
04:02:46,218 --> 04:02:48,620
WE KNOW HE'S GIVEN AN AFFIDAVIT,

560
04:02:48,620 --> 04:02:50,822
YOU MENTIONED THE THIRD WOMAN

561
04:02:50,822 --> 04:02:53,524
WHO MADE AN ACCUSATION AGAINST

562
04:02:53,524 --> 04:02:57,195
BRETT KAVANAUGH, SHE HAD GIVEN

563
04:02:57,195 --> 04:02:57,829
AN AFFIDAVIT.

564
04:02:57,829 --> 04:02:59,197
ARE THEY HAVE EQUAL WEIGHT OR

565
04:02:59,197 --> 04:03:00,298
COULD YOU SEE A SITUATION WHERE

566
04:03:00,298 --> 04:03:02,100
MARK JUDGE COULD BE SUBPOENAED

567
04:03:02,100 --> 04:03:05,270
AND WOULD THAT BE ENOUGH TO KEEP

568
04:03:05,270 --> 04:03:06,071
THIS THING FLOWING AND WHAT KIND

569
04:03:06,071 --> 04:03:11,176
OF A DELAY THAT WOULD CAUSE?

570
04:03:11,176 --> 04:03:12,977
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE

571
04:03:12,977 --> 04:03:14,579
UNACCEPTABLE TO REPUBLICANS,

572
04:03:14,579 --> 04:03:17,149
THEY SAY -- THERE WAS A PUSHBACK

573
04:03:17,149 --> 04:03:18,483
FROM DEMOCRATS THAT MARK JUDGE

574
04:03:18,483 --> 04:03:20,418
FILED A STATEMENT THROUGH HIS

575
04:03:20,418 --> 04:03:21,319
ATTORNEY, THEN LAST NIGHT MARK

576
04:03:21,319 --> 04:03:25,123
JUDGE SIGNED AN ACTUAL LETTER

577
04:03:25,123 --> 04:03:28,160
THAT IS, WE SHOULD POINT OUT,

578
04:03:28,160 --> 04:03:31,263
PUNISHABLE BY FELONY IF HE'S

579
04:03:31,263 --> 04:03:31,563
LYING.

580
04:03:31,563 --> 04:03:35,634
IT'S A SMALL ROOM, THIS IS A

581
04:03:35,634 --> 04:03:36,201
SMALL COMMITTEE ROOM.

582
04:03:36,201 --> 04:03:41,807
YOU HAVE NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS

583
04:03:41,807 --> 04:03:43,441
CORNERING FLAKE IN THIS LITTLE

584
04:03:43,441 --> 04:03:45,410
ROOM BUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS,

585
04:03:45,410 --> 04:03:46,144
INCLUDING NOW SENATOR GRASSLEY

586
04:03:46,144 --> 04:03:46,912
GOING OVER TO THAT ROOM TO FIND

587
04:03:46,912 --> 04:03:49,581
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

588
04:03:49,581 --> 04:03:51,148
YOU ARE 13, 14 MINUTES AFTER THE

589
04:03:51,148 --> 04:03:54,419
SCHEDULED VOTE HERE.

590
04:03:54,419 --> 04:03:56,955
ONE THING AND PROCESS THAT CHRIS

591
04:03:56,955 --> 04:03:59,624
MENTIONED BEFORE, IT'S NOT

592
04:03:59,624 --> 04:04:00,325
NECESSARY FOR THE SENATE

593
04:04:00,325 --> 04:04:02,594
JUDICIARY TO VOTE TO RECOMMEND.

594
04:04:02,594 --> 04:04:06,331
THEY DO HAVE TO VOTE, THOUGH.

595
04:04:06,331 --> 04:04:08,600
LIKE THEY DID WITH CLARENCE

596
04:04:08,600 --> 04:04:12,004
THOMAS, THE SENATE JUDICIARY

597
04:04:12,004 --> 04:04:14,039
COMMITTEE COULD COME TO NO

598
04:04:14,039 --> 04:04:16,408
RECOMMENDATION FOR A TAG, OR SAY

599
04:04:16,408 --> 04:04:17,742
WE DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PERSON

600
04:04:17,742 --> 04:04:18,443
TO THE SENATE FLOOR.

601
04:04:18,443 --> 04:04:21,313
IT DOES PREVENT THAT VOTEE FROM

602
04:04:21,313 --> 04:04:21,913
GOING FORWARD THAT MITCH

603
04:04:21,913 --> 04:04:22,614
McCONNELL SAID HE WOULD DO.

604
04:04:22,614 --> 04:04:26,351
IF THEY DON'T RECOMMEND, THAT

605
04:04:26,351 --> 04:04:28,086
OBVIOUSLY SWAYS POTENTIALLY SOME

606
04:04:28,086 --> 04:04:29,020
MODERATE VOTERS WHO HAVEN'T

607
04:04:29,020 --> 04:04:33,258
DECIDED, LIKE COLLINS OR LISA

608
04:04:33,258 --> 04:04:35,093
MURKOWSKI, SOME OTHERS WHO SAID

609
04:04:35,093 --> 04:04:36,595
THEY HAVEN'T DECIDED YET BUT WE

610
04:04:36,595 --> 04:04:41,166
EXPECT THAT THEY WILL BE VOTING

611
04:04:41,166 --> 04:04:44,903
NO.

612
04:04:44,903 --> 04:04:46,371
>> Harris: YOU HEAR THE NAME

613
04:04:46,371 --> 04:04:48,273
ROBERT BORK COME UP AND YOU TALK

614
04:04:48,273 --> 04:04:49,474
ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATION OUT OF

615
04:04:49,474 --> 04:04:50,475
THAT COMMITTEE.

616
04:04:50,475 --> 04:04:51,809
YOU HEAR THE COMPARISON, DO YOU

617
04:04:51,809 --> 04:04:56,047
SEE ANY COMPARISON?

618
04:04:56,047 --> 04:04:58,316
>> TO THIS EXTENT, IT USED TO BE

619
04:04:58,316 --> 04:04:59,083
THAT THERE WAS A PRESUMPTION

620
04:04:59,083 --> 04:05:02,053
THAT WHEN A PRESIDENT CAME IN,

621
04:05:02,053 --> 04:05:04,189
IF HE WERE TO RECOMMEND SOMEBODY

622
04:05:04,189 --> 04:05:06,658
WHO WAS WITHIN THE JUDICIAL

623
04:05:06,658 --> 04:05:10,295
MAINSTREAM AND QUALIFIED, YES, A

624
04:05:10,295 --> 04:05:11,696
REPUBLICAN WOULD NOMINATE A MORE

625
04:05:11,696 --> 04:05:13,298
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE AND A

626
04:05:13,298 --> 04:05:14,866
DEMOCRAT WOULD NOMINATE A MORE

627
04:05:14,866 --> 04:05:16,902
LIBERAL JUSTICE, BUT PART OF THE

628
04:05:16,902 --> 04:05:18,370
FRUIT OF THEIR ELECTION WAS IF

629
04:05:18,370 --> 04:05:20,839
THIS WAS SOMEONE IN THE JUDICIAL

630
04:05:20,839 --> 04:05:22,907
MAINSTREAM, THERE WOULD BE

631
04:05:22,907 --> 04:05:23,708
DEFERENCE GIVEN TO THE

632
04:05:23,708 --> 04:05:26,378
PRESIDENT'S CHOICE.

633
04:05:26,378 --> 04:05:28,446
WITH ROBERT BORK NOMINATED BY

634
04:05:28,446 --> 04:05:32,751
RONALD REAGAN, THAT SEEMED TO GO

635
04:05:32,751 --> 04:05:33,218
OUT THE WINDOW.

636
04:05:33,218 --> 04:05:38,256
A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THE

637
04:05:38,256 --> 04:05:40,091
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS,

638
04:05:40,091 --> 04:05:41,592
IT BECAME EXTREMELY HEATED,

639
04:05:41,592 --> 04:05:42,294
EXTREMELY POLITICAL.

640
04:05:42,294 --> 04:05:45,497
AS SOON AS HE WAS NOMINATED TED

641
04:05:45,497 --> 04:05:47,599
KENNEDY WENT TO THE SENATE FLOOR

642
04:05:47,599 --> 04:05:49,901
AND SAID "IN ROBERT BORK'S

643
04:05:49,901 --> 04:05:52,203
AMERICA WOMEN WILL ONCE AGAIN BE

644
04:05:52,203 --> 04:05:53,505
GETTING BACK ALLEY ABORTIONS."

645
04:05:53,505 --> 04:05:55,674
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU STARTED TO

646
04:05:55,674 --> 04:05:58,276
SEE THE NOMINATION AND

647
04:05:58,276 --> 04:05:59,010
CONFIRMATIONS BECOME EXTREMELY

648
04:05:59,010 --> 04:06:00,245
POLITICAL AND IT'S GONE DOWNHILL

649
04:06:00,245 --> 04:06:00,645
FROM THERE.

650
04:06:00,645 --> 04:06:03,014
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECORD,

651
04:06:03,014 --> 04:06:03,782
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE

652
04:06:03,782 --> 04:06:08,286
LIKELY TO GIVE DEFERENCE TO THE

653
04:06:08,286 --> 04:06:09,454
CHOICE OF DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS

654
04:06:09,454 --> 04:06:13,291
THAN DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TO GIVE

655
04:06:13,291 --> 04:06:14,292
DEFERENCE TO REPUBLICANS.

656
04:06:14,292 --> 04:06:15,060
>> Harris: SENATOR LINDSEY

657
04:06:15,060 --> 04:06:17,195
GRAHAM MADE THAT POINT AND HE

658
04:06:17,195 --> 04:06:19,965
EVEN SAID, TO THOSE DEMOCRAT

659
04:06:19,965 --> 04:06:22,667
NOMINEES, HELLO.

660
04:06:22,667 --> 04:06:24,469
HE SAID, I VOTED FOR YOU.

661
04:06:24,469 --> 04:06:26,671
WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE GOING

662
04:06:26,671 --> 04:06:27,071
FORWARD?

663
04:06:27,071 --> 04:06:28,139
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

664
04:06:28,139 --> 04:06:29,507
ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE

665
04:06:29,507 --> 04:06:34,913
LOOKING AT THE SAME THING THAT I

666
04:06:34,913 --> 04:06:36,114
AM BECAUSE WE BOTH TOOK OUR

667
04:06:36,114 --> 04:06:38,750
READING GLASSES ON AND OFF.

668
04:06:38,750 --> 04:06:40,152
SENATOR GRASSLEY HAS RETURNED.

669
04:06:40,152 --> 04:06:45,957
>> YES BUT HE'S NOT DONE YET,

670
04:06:45,957 --> 04:06:49,093
EVERY DEMOCRAT IS IN THIS SMALL

671
04:06:49,093 --> 04:06:51,262
ROOM AND THEY ARE HOT BOXING

672
04:06:51,262 --> 04:06:53,598
SENATOR FLAKE, THEY ARE HAVING A

673
04:06:53,598 --> 04:07:01,940
SPIRITED DISCUSSION, SENATOR 

674
04:07:01,940 --> 04:07:04,275
SENATOR COONS LEADING THE WAY.

675
04:07:04,275 --> 04:07:05,476
I POINT OUT, THEIR FRIENDSHIP

676
04:07:05,476 --> 04:07:07,712
AND REAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN

677
04:07:07,712 --> 04:07:11,683
SENATOR FLAKE AND SENATOR COONS,

678
04:07:11,683 --> 04:07:12,850
AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING

679
04:07:12,850 --> 04:07:15,687
BREWING ABOUT A DELAY OF SOME

680
04:07:15,687 --> 04:07:16,988
SORT, REMEMBER, FLAKE JUST PUT

681
04:07:16,988 --> 04:07:21,092
OUT A STATEMENT SAYING HE FELT

682
04:07:21,092 --> 04:07:21,692
THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF

683
04:07:21,692 --> 04:07:23,261
INNOCENCE BELONGS TO JUDGE

684
04:07:23,261 --> 04:07:24,595
KAVANAUGH, HE CALLED BOTH

685
04:07:24,595 --> 04:07:27,631
WITNESSES VERY COMPELLING AND

686
04:07:27,631 --> 04:07:29,634
CREDIBLE BUT WITHOUT

687
04:07:29,634 --> 04:07:32,270
CORROBORATION, THE PRESUMPTION

688
04:07:32,270 --> 04:07:33,471
OF INNOCENCE GOES TO JUDGE

689
04:07:33,471 --> 04:07:33,871
KAVANAUGH.

690
04:07:33,871 --> 04:07:34,705
IS SENATOR COONS AS HE DID IN

691
04:07:34,705 --> 04:07:37,809
HIS SPEECH TODAY SAYING OKAY, WE

692
04:07:37,809 --> 04:07:39,343
GET YOU, BUT GIVE US A FEW DAYS

693
04:07:39,343 --> 04:07:42,080
TO INVESTIGATE.

694
04:07:42,080 --> 04:07:43,114
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

695
04:07:43,114 --> 04:07:44,649
BEEN HANGING THEIR HAT ON PRETTY

696
04:07:44,649 --> 04:07:47,418
MUCH ALL YESTERDAY AND ALL TODA

697
04:07:47,418 --> 04:07:47,719
TODAY.

698
04:07:47,719 --> 04:07:49,621
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT SCENARIO

699
04:07:49,621 --> 04:07:52,990
IS ONE, WHAT DO THEY GET?

700
04:07:52,990 --> 04:07:54,726
THEY ALWAYS GO BACK TO MARK

701
04:07:54,726 --> 04:07:55,493
JUDGE AND WHAT IS GOING TO SAY

702
04:07:55,493 --> 04:07:58,663
OR NOT SAY.

703
04:07:58,663 --> 04:08:00,298
HE'S NOW FILED A LETTER HE

704
04:08:00,298 --> 04:08:01,266
SIGNED SAYING HE DOESN'T

705
04:08:01,266 --> 04:08:03,301
REMEMBER ANYTHING LIKE THIS

706
04:08:03,301 --> 04:08:09,474
PARTY, ARE THEY GOING TO GET

707
04:08:09,474 --> 04:08:09,941
SOMETHING MORE?

708
04:08:09,941 --> 04:08:11,109
THE FBI COULD ASK HIM QUESTIONS

709
04:08:11,109 --> 04:08:14,479
THAT PROBE HIM, THAT'S WHAT

710
04:08:14,479 --> 04:08:15,980
DEMOCRATS WANT TO SEE.

711
04:08:15,980 --> 04:08:18,450
THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE OTHER

712
04:08:18,450 --> 04:08:21,920
AVENUES EXPLORED.

713
04:08:21,920 --> 04:08:24,322
THE PROBLEM, AS I SAID, THEY SAT

714
04:08:24,322 --> 04:08:24,889
ON IT.

715
04:08:24,889 --> 04:08:27,292
UP UNTIL THE END OF THIS

716
04:08:27,292 --> 04:08:28,093
PROCESS.

717
04:08:28,093 --> 04:08:29,294
AND NOW IT'S BEING DELAYED AND

718
04:08:29,294 --> 04:08:30,495
THE ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER SIDE

719
04:08:30,495 --> 04:08:36,334
IS THAT DOING SO BY POLITICS.

720
04:08:36,334 --> 04:08:38,603
THERE YOU SEE SENATORS COMING

721
04:08:38,603 --> 04:08:41,706
OUT OF THAT ROOM.

722
04:08:41,706 --> 04:08:42,707
>> Harris: I'VE TAKEN OUT THAT

723
04:08:42,707 --> 04:08:44,008
SENATOR FLAKE STATEMENT SO I CAN

724
04:08:44,008 --> 04:08:46,211
LOOK AT IT AGAIN, "I WISH I

725
04:08:46,211 --> 04:08:46,911
COULD EXPRESS THE CONFIDENCE

726
04:08:46,911 --> 04:08:49,314
THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

727
04:08:49,314 --> 04:08:51,316
CONVEYED ABOUT WHAT EITHER DID

728
04:08:51,316 --> 04:08:53,051
OR DID NOT HAPPEN IN THE EARLY

729
04:08:53,051 --> 04:08:53,351
1980s.

730
04:08:53,351 --> 04:08:55,786
WHEN I LEFT THAT HEARING

731
04:08:55,786 --> 04:08:59,257
YESTERDAY WITH AS MUCH DOUBT AS

732
04:08:59,257 --> 04:08:59,657
CERTAINTY."

733
04:08:59,657 --> 04:09:01,592
YOU GO ON TO READ WHAT HE SAID

734
04:09:01,592 --> 04:09:03,561
ABOUT THE ABSENCE OF

735
04:09:03,561 --> 04:09:04,195
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND

736
04:09:04,195 --> 04:09:06,064
THAT'S WHAT BINDS US TO RULE OF

737
04:09:06,064 --> 04:09:06,531
LAW.

738
04:09:06,531 --> 04:09:08,266
THE LAST SENTENCE OF HIS

739
04:09:08,266 --> 04:09:10,602
STATEMENT FROM TODAY, "JEFF

740
04:09:10,602 --> 04:09:12,670
FLAKE SAYS I WILL VOTE TO

741
04:09:12,670 --> 04:09:13,304
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH."

742
04:09:13,304 --> 04:09:15,373
AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE

743
04:09:15,373 --> 04:09:18,476
CACOPHONY IN THE ROOM AMONG

744
04:09:18,476 --> 04:09:20,311
DEMOCRATS THAT THAT SET OFF,

745
04:09:20,311 --> 04:09:21,746
THAT'S CODE FOR YELLING, I WOULD

746
04:09:21,746 --> 04:09:23,515
IMAGINE.

747
04:09:23,515 --> 04:09:26,484
CORY BOOKER WAS REALLY DIFFICULT

748
04:09:26,484 --> 04:09:33,091
TO EVEN WRAP.

749
04:09:33,091 --> 04:09:38,195
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ACTION

750
04:09:38,195 --> 04:09:39,564
OVER THE MOTION THAT'S BEFORE

751
04:09:39,564 --> 04:09:39,831
US.

752
04:09:39,831 --> 04:09:40,798
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE

753
04:09:40,798 --> 04:10:00,051
HAVE A QUORUM.

754
04:10:30,181 --> 04:10:36,487
[INAUDIBLE]

755
04:10:36,487 --> 04:10:40,090
>> AS A POINT OF PERSONAL

756
04:10:40,090 --> 04:10:43,494
PRIVILEGE, I'M GOING TO CALL ON

757
04:10:43,494 --> 04:10:44,195
SENATOR FLAKE TO SPEAK.

758
04:10:44,195 --> 04:10:46,397
NORMALLY WE WOULD START THE VOTE

759
04:10:46,397 --> 04:10:48,333
RIGHT NOW BUT AS A POINT OF

760
04:10:48,333 --> 04:10:49,533
PERSONAL PRIVILEGE I WOULD CALL

761
04:10:49,533 --> 04:10:50,335
ON SENATOR FLAKE.

762
04:10:50,335 --> 04:10:53,271
>> THANK YOU.

763
04:10:53,271 --> 04:10:54,572
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH A

764
04:10:54,572 --> 04:10:56,474
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER

765
04:10:56,474 --> 04:10:57,675
SIDE, WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS

766
04:10:57,675 --> 04:11:01,679
ON GOING FOR A WHILE WITH REGARD

767
04:11:01,679 --> 04:11:04,081
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO DUE

768
04:11:04,081 --> 04:11:04,549
DILIGENCE HERE.

769
04:11:04,549 --> 04:11:08,919
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE PROPER

770
04:11:08,919 --> 04:11:12,123
TO DELAY THE FLOOR VOTE.

771
04:11:12,123 --> 04:11:14,525
FOR UP TO, BUT NOT MORE THAN ONE

772
04:11:14,525 --> 04:11:14,825
WEEK.

773
04:11:14,825 --> 04:11:18,896
IN ORDER TO LET THE FBI

774
04:11:18,896 --> 04:11:20,498
CONTINUE -- TO DO AN

775
04:11:20,498 --> 04:11:22,166
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED IN TIME

776
04:11:22,166 --> 04:11:25,135
AND SCOPE, THE CURRENT

777
04:11:25,135 --> 04:11:28,372
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE THERE,

778
04:11:28,372 --> 04:11:30,808
LIMITED IN TIME TO MORE THAN ONE

779
04:11:30,808 --> 04:11:34,912
WEEK.

780
04:11:34,912 --> 04:11:36,614
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL

781
04:11:36,614 --> 04:11:37,181
TO THE FLOOR WITH THAT

782
04:11:37,181 --> 04:11:37,949
UNDERSTANDING AND I'VE SPOKEN TO

783
04:11:37,949 --> 04:11:41,919
A FEW OTHER MEMBERS WHO ON MY

784
04:11:41,919 --> 04:11:44,289
SIDE OF THE AISLE MAY BE

785
04:11:44,289 --> 04:11:44,889
SUPPORTIVE AS WELL.

786
04:11:44,889 --> 04:11:45,423
THAT'S MY POSITION.

787
04:11:45,423 --> 04:11:56,500
I THINK THAT DOING DUE DILIGENCE

788
04:11:56,500 --> 04:11:58,102
IS IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO SAY

789
04:11:58,102 --> 04:11:59,904
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ACTED

790
04:11:59,904 --> 04:12:00,271
PROPERLY.

791
04:12:00,271 --> 04:12:03,074
THE CHAIRMAN HAS BENT OVER

792
04:12:03,074 --> 04:12:03,808
BACKWARDS TO DO INVESTIGATIONS

793
04:12:03,808 --> 04:12:06,678
FROM THIS COMMITTEE.

794
04:12:06,678 --> 04:12:07,911
AND TO DELAY THIS VOTE IN THIS

795
04:12:07,911 --> 04:12:15,119
COMMITTEE FOR A WEEK SO THAT

796
04:12:15,119 --> 04:12:16,020
DR. FORD CAN BE HEARD.

797
04:12:16,020 --> 04:12:20,224
AND SHE WAS YESTERDAY.

798
04:12:20,224 --> 04:12:20,891
SO THAT'S WITHOUT AGREEMENT.

799
04:12:20,891 --> 04:12:22,660
I WILL VOTE TO ADVANCE THE BILL

800
04:12:22,660 --> 04:12:28,433
TO THE FLOOR.

801
04:12:28,433 --> 04:12:31,269
ONE SECOND, CAN DIANE SPEAK?

802
04:12:31,269 --> 04:12:33,771
>> WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON?

803
04:12:33,771 --> 04:12:36,708
WE ARE VOTING ON THE MOTION TO

804
04:12:36,708 --> 04:12:38,876
REPORT THE NOMINATION TO THE

805
04:12:38,876 --> 04:12:42,380
FLOOR.

806
04:12:42,380 --> 04:12:46,517
>> THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING,

807
04:12:46,517 --> 04:12:52,156
LET THE SENATOR EXPLAIN IT.

808
04:12:52,156 --> 04:12:55,526
>> MY UNDERSTANDING, THE

809
04:12:55,526 --> 04:12:56,561
DEMOCRATS COULD SPEAK TO IT,

810
04:12:56,561 --> 04:12:59,464
CHRIS OR YOU AS WE TALKED ABOUT

811
04:12:59,464 --> 04:12:59,897
BEFORE.

812
04:12:59,897 --> 04:13:01,265
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD ACCEPT AND

813
04:13:01,265 --> 04:13:04,702
ENDORSE ALL ONE WEEK FBI

814
04:13:04,702 --> 04:13:05,402
INVESTIGATION LIMITED IN TIME

815
04:13:05,402 --> 04:13:07,772
AND SCOPE.

816
04:13:07,772 --> 04:13:09,907
>> SINCE YOU ARE THE DECIDING

817
04:13:09,907 --> 04:13:10,975
VOTE HERE, WE WILL VOTE AND IF

818
04:13:10,975 --> 04:13:13,077
THERE'S ANY SORT OF DISCUSSION

819
04:13:13,077 --> 04:13:14,345
WE WILL DO THAT AFTER THE VOTE.

820
04:13:14,345 --> 04:13:27,725
CALL THE ROLE.

821
04:13:27,725 --> 04:13:41,873
>> MR KENNEDY, MR FLAKE, MR.

822
04:13:41,873 --> 04:13:41,873
DURBIN,

823
04:13:41,873 --> 04:13:43,307
.

824
04:13:43,307 --> 04:13:48,513
>> ON THE NOMINEE, NO.

825
04:13:48,513 --> 04:13:50,314
>> NO.

826
04:13:50,314 --> 04:13:51,682
>> MR. BOOKER?

827
04:13:51,682 --> 04:13:51,982
>> NO.

828
04:13:51,982 --> 04:13:52,650
>> MS. HARRIS?

829
04:13:52,650 --> 04:13:56,487
>> NO.

830
04:13:56,487 --> 04:14:04,796
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THE VOTES ARE

831
04:14:04,796 --> 04:14:07,698
11 NAY, 10 YEA.

832
04:14:07,698 --> 04:14:10,334
>> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

833
04:14:10,334 --> 04:14:12,103
GIVING US THE TIME TODAY TO HAVE

834
04:14:12,103 --> 04:14:13,504
IT IN A CONVERSATION.

835
04:14:13,504 --> 04:14:14,404
A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

836
04:14:14,404 --> 04:14:16,674
ASKED FOR A ONE WEEK DELAY IN

837
04:14:16,674 --> 04:14:19,043
ORDER THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN FBI

838
04:14:19,043 --> 04:14:19,610
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT

839
04:14:19,610 --> 04:14:22,980
ALLEGATIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEFORE

840
04:14:22,980 --> 04:14:23,514
THIS COMMITTEE.

841
04:14:23,514 --> 04:14:26,216
I RESPECT SENATOR FLAKE'S VIEW

842
04:14:26,216 --> 04:14:28,853
THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS BEST

843
04:14:28,853 --> 04:14:30,821
TO RESPECT YOUR HAVING GIVEN

844
04:14:30,821 --> 04:14:32,890
DR. FORD THE TIME TO BE HEARD

845
04:14:32,890 --> 04:14:33,524
YESTERDAY AND ADVANCE THE

846
04:14:33,524 --> 04:14:35,293
NOMINEE TO THE FLOOR.

847
04:14:35,293 --> 04:14:37,495
BUT IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COULD

848
04:14:37,495 --> 04:14:40,498
WORK TOGETHER ON A BIPARTISAN

849
04:14:40,498 --> 04:14:41,599
BASIS TO DILIGENTLY PURSUE AN

850
04:14:41,599 --> 04:14:43,668
FBI INVESTIGATION WITHIN THE

851
04:14:43,668 --> 04:14:44,902
NEXT WEEK.

852
04:14:44,902 --> 04:14:47,338
NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF DELAY BUT

853
04:14:47,338 --> 04:14:49,307
FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING

854
04:14:49,307 --> 04:14:50,307
FURTHER EITHER ALLEGATIONS MADE

855
04:14:50,307 --> 04:14:54,912
BY DR. FORD OR OTHERS WITH A

856
04:14:54,912 --> 04:14:55,980
GOAL TOWARDS DEMONSTRATING A

857
04:14:55,980 --> 04:14:57,148
BIPARTISAN COMMITMENT TO

858
04:14:57,148 --> 04:14:58,015
DILIGENTLY INVESTIGATE THESE

859
04:14:58,015 --> 04:14:59,684
ALLEGATIONS.

860
04:14:59,684 --> 04:15:01,752
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

861
04:15:01,752 --> 04:15:03,621
THANK YOU, SENATOR FLAKE.

862
04:15:03,621 --> 04:15:05,523
>> I WOULD SUPPORT THAT MOTION.

863
04:15:05,523 --> 04:15:08,325
I THINK WE DO NEED THIS

864
04:15:08,325 --> 04:15:09,327
INVESTIGATION.

865
04:15:09,327 --> 04:15:10,127
I SORT OF MISUNDERSTOOD

866
04:15:10,127 --> 04:15:10,962
SENATOR FLAKE WHAT YOU ARE

867
04:15:10,962 --> 04:15:13,798
DOING, I THOUGHT IT INCLUDED A

868
04:15:13,798 --> 04:15:14,499
ONE-WEEK INVESTIGATION.

869
04:15:14,499 --> 04:15:17,100
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE

870
04:15:17,100 --> 04:15:20,505
MOTION FOR THAT INVESTIGATION.

871
04:15:20,505 --> 04:15:23,908
>> WE WILL TAKE TURNS A YEAR,

872
04:15:23,908 --> 04:15:24,342
SENATOR.

873
04:15:24,342 --> 04:15:25,810
>> I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE

874
04:15:25,810 --> 04:15:28,746
ARE NOT THE MAJORITY.

875
04:15:28,746 --> 04:15:29,680
SENATOR FLAKE HAS MADE CLEAR

876
04:15:29,680 --> 04:15:32,283
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE HIM TO BE

877
04:15:32,283 --> 04:15:34,318
COMFORTABLE ON A FINAL PASSAGE

878
04:15:34,318 --> 04:15:34,618
VOTE.

879
04:15:34,618 --> 04:15:35,552
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE SAY

880
04:15:35,552 --> 04:15:43,694
HERE, THIS WILL BE UP TO

881
04:15:43,694 --> 04:15:45,596
SENATOR SCHUMER IN

882
04:15:45,596 --> 04:15:47,565
SENATOR McCONNELL.

883
04:15:47,565 --> 04:15:51,135
>> SENATOR LEAHY HE?

884
04:15:51,135 --> 04:15:52,503
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO

885
04:15:52,503 --> 04:15:53,971
MAKE SURE BECAUSE THIS IS

886
04:15:53,971 --> 04:15:54,772
SOMEWHAT UNPRECEDENTED.

887
04:15:54,772 --> 04:15:56,307
WHEN I DO AGREE WITH THE

888
04:15:56,307 --> 04:15:58,076
SENATOR FROM ARIZONA THAT WE

889
04:15:58,076 --> 04:16:01,012
SHOULD HAVE THIS FURTHER

890
04:16:01,012 --> 04:16:01,445
INVESTIGATION.

891
04:16:01,445 --> 04:16:04,415
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

892
04:16:04,415 --> 04:16:06,350
DURING THE WEEK THAT THAT IS

893
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:09,253
TAKING PLACE, THERE WILL BE

894
04:16:09,253 --> 04:16:12,256
NO ACTION ON THE FLOOR OF

895
04:16:12,256 --> 04:16:15,159
THE UNITED STATES SENATE ON

896
04:16:15,159 --> 04:16:16,894
THIS NOMINATION.

897
04:16:16,894 --> 04:16:18,196
IS THAT CORRECT?

898
04:16:18,196 --> 04:16:20,198
>> I CANNOT SAY THAT --

899
04:16:20,198 --> 04:16:21,298
>> -- LET ME SAY AGAIN.

900
04:16:21,298 --> 04:16:23,100
I CAN'T MAKE THAT STATEMENT

901
04:16:23,100 --> 04:16:24,035
FOR THE LEADERSHIP.

902
04:16:24,035 --> 04:16:26,337
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I WOULD

903
04:16:26,337 --> 04:16:28,673
BE ONLY COMFORTABLE MOVING

904
04:16:28,673 --> 04:16:29,607
FORWARD ON THE FLOOR, I WILL

905
04:16:29,607 --> 04:16:30,741
MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE.

906
04:16:30,741 --> 04:16:32,677
BUT I WILL ONLY BE

907
04:16:32,677 --> 04:16:33,477
COMFORTABLE MOVING ON THE

908
04:16:33,477 --> 04:16:36,247
FLOOR UNTIL THE FBI HAS DONE

909
04:16:36,247 --> 04:16:37,581
MORE INVESTIGATION THAN THEY

910
04:16:37,581 --> 04:16:38,583
HAVE ALREADY.

911
04:16:38,583 --> 04:16:41,218
IT MAY NOT TAKE THEM A WEEK.

912
04:16:41,218 --> 04:16:42,253
I UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME OF

913
04:16:42,253 --> 04:16:43,921
THESE WITNESSES MAY NOT WANT

914
04:16:43,921 --> 04:16:45,823
TO DISCUSS ANYTHING FURTHER.

915
04:16:45,823 --> 04:16:48,693
BUT, I THINK WE OWE THEM DUE

916
04:16:48,693 --> 04:16:49,060
DILIGENCE.

917
04:16:49,060 --> 04:16:49,660
>> FROM CHAIRMAN.

918
04:16:49,660 --> 04:16:50,494
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

919
04:16:50,494 --> 04:16:52,964
>> JUST A MINUTE.

920
04:16:52,964 --> 04:16:55,132
ALL I HAVE SAID TO SENATOR

921
04:16:55,132 --> 04:16:56,867
FLAKE IS THAT I WOULD

922
04:16:56,867 --> 04:16:59,236
ADVOCATE FOR THE POSITION HE

923
04:16:59,236 --> 04:17:01,038
TOOK BUT I DON'T CONTROL

924
04:17:01,038 --> 04:17:01,471
THAT SENATOR?

925
04:17:01,471 --> 04:17:02,773
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

926
04:17:02,773 --> 04:17:04,375
>> YES.

927
04:17:04,375 --> 04:17:05,576
SENATOR KLOBUCHAR.

928
04:17:05,576 --> 04:17:07,011
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE

929
04:17:07,011 --> 04:17:09,146
OTHER SENATORS AS WELL WHO

930
04:17:09,146 --> 04:17:13,017
MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS

931
04:17:13,017 --> 04:17:13,651
NEGOTIATION ON THE

932
04:17:13,651 --> 04:17:15,152
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THERE IS

933
04:17:15,152 --> 04:17:18,055
NOT REALLY A SET AGREEMENT

934
04:17:18,055 --> 04:17:18,355
HERE.

935
04:17:18,355 --> 04:17:19,523
ALL OF US HAVE ALREADY SAID

936
04:17:19,523 --> 04:17:20,491
WE ARE VOTING NO.

937
04:17:20,491 --> 04:17:22,193
IT IS SENATOR FLAKE WORKING

938
04:17:22,193 --> 04:17:23,560
WITH ALL OF US TO SAY FOR

939
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:24,662
THE GOOD OF THE SENATE AND

940
04:17:24,662 --> 04:17:27,665
THE GOOD OF THE COURT, THE

941
04:17:27,665 --> 04:17:28,933
AMERICAN TEAM DESERVE TO

942
04:17:28,933 --> 04:17:30,167
HAVE THE FACTS FOLLOWED UP

943
04:17:30,167 --> 04:17:30,434
ON.

944
04:17:30,434 --> 04:17:32,937
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE HIS

945
04:17:32,937 --> 04:17:33,738
WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT.

946
04:17:33,738 --> 04:17:35,606
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS

947
04:17:35,606 --> 04:17:35,906
ABOUT.

948
04:17:35,906 --> 04:17:37,642
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT AND BY

949
04:17:37,642 --> 04:17:39,010
THE WAY, IF SENATOR

950
04:17:39,010 --> 04:17:39,810
MCCONNELL WANTS TO GO

951
04:17:39,810 --> 04:17:41,312
FORWARD IN LIGHT OF THAT AND

952
04:17:41,312 --> 04:17:42,313
WE STILL HAVE SEVERAL

953
04:17:42,313 --> 04:17:43,547
SENATORS THAT HAVEN'T SAID

954
04:17:43,547 --> 04:17:44,882
HOW THEY ARE VOTING ON THIS

955
04:17:44,882 --> 04:17:47,551
NOMINEE, I ACTUALLY THINK

956
04:17:47,551 --> 04:17:49,387
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT

957
04:17:49,387 --> 04:17:50,021
JUST HAPPENED RIGHT NOW.

958
04:17:50,021 --> 04:17:51,555
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE AN

959
04:17:51,555 --> 04:17:51,922
AGREEMENT.

960
04:17:51,922 --> 04:17:53,224
IT IS ONE SENATOR WHO IS

961
04:17:53,224 --> 04:17:54,492
STANDING UP.

962
04:17:54,492 --> 04:17:55,859
>> SENATOR CORNYN?

963
04:17:55,859 --> 04:17:57,762
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I JUST WANT

964
04:17:57,762 --> 04:17:59,430
TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION

965
04:17:59,430 --> 04:18:00,598
TO SENATOR FLAKE FOR

966
04:18:00,598 --> 04:18:01,766
ALLOWING THIS PROCESS TO

967
04:18:01,766 --> 04:18:02,400
MOVE FORWARD.

968
04:18:02,400 --> 04:18:03,501
THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCE OF

969
04:18:03,501 --> 04:18:05,002
OPINION AMONG US AS TO WHAT

970
04:18:05,002 --> 04:18:06,604
EXACTLY THE FBI

971
04:18:06,604 --> 04:18:08,472
INVESTIGATION WOULD CONSIST

972
04:18:08,472 --> 04:18:08,739
OF.

973
04:18:08,739 --> 04:18:10,941
SOME OF US THINK IT HAS BEEN

974
04:18:10,941 --> 04:18:14,178
CONCLUDED AND SUM ELEMENT

975
04:18:14,178 --> 04:18:15,079
SUPPLEMENTED BY THIS

976
04:18:15,079 --> 04:18:15,913
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION

977
04:18:15,913 --> 04:18:17,381
OTHERS DISAGREE WITH THAT I

978
04:18:17,381 --> 04:18:18,716
RESPECT THE FACT THAT NOT

979
04:18:18,716 --> 04:18:20,117
ONLY SENATOR FLAKE ADVOCATED

980
04:18:20,117 --> 04:18:21,819
TO GIVE DR. FORD A CHANCE TO

981
04:18:21,819 --> 04:18:23,354
APPEAR IN FRONT OF THE

982
04:18:23,354 --> 04:18:24,188
COMMITTEE, WHICH WAS THE

983
04:18:24,188 --> 04:18:25,890
RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT ALSO

984
04:18:25,890 --> 04:18:27,692
THAT HE HAS ALLOWED THIS

985
04:18:27,692 --> 04:18:29,160
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD,

986
04:18:29,160 --> 04:18:30,561
SUBJECT TO FURTHER

987
04:18:30,561 --> 04:18:32,697
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

988
04:18:32,697 --> 04:18:34,432
FBI MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE

989
04:18:34,432 --> 04:18:35,833
TO COME UP WITH.

990
04:18:35,833 --> 04:18:37,702
BUT, CERTAINLY, HE MAINTAINS

991
04:18:37,702 --> 04:18:39,670
HIS RIGHT TO CAST HIS VOTE

992
04:18:39,670 --> 04:18:41,906
YEA OR NEY AS HE SEES FIT

993
04:18:41,906 --> 04:18:43,541
AND MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT

994
04:18:43,541 --> 04:18:44,475
LEVERAGE THAT WAY.

995
04:18:44,475 --> 04:18:46,911
BUT, I APPRECIATE HIS

996
04:18:46,911 --> 04:18:48,379
SUPPORT FOR A FULL AND FAIR

997
04:18:48,379 --> 04:18:50,915
HEARING FOR DR. FORD AND

998
04:18:50,915 --> 04:18:51,582
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS WELL AS

999
04:18:51,582 --> 04:18:52,783
HIS WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW

1000
04:18:52,783 --> 04:18:55,252
THIS TO GO FORWARD SUBJECT

1001
04:18:55,252 --> 04:18:56,587
TO HIS REQUEST.

1002
04:18:56,587 --> 04:18:58,388
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

1003
04:18:58,388 --> 04:18:59,156
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.

1004
04:18:59,156 --> 04:19:02,893
>> SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, OUGHT

1005
04:19:02,893 --> 04:19:04,795
TO CALL ON SENATOR

1006
04:19:04,795 --> 04:19:05,162
FEINSTEIN.

1007
04:19:05,162 --> 04:19:07,131
>> IF I, THROUGH THE CHAIR,

1008
04:19:07,131 --> 04:19:08,199
COULD HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF

1009
04:19:08,199 --> 04:19:10,167
SENATOR FLAKE, DOES YOUR

1010
04:19:10,167 --> 04:19:11,869
AMENDMENT INCLUDE CONTINUING

1011
04:19:11,869 --> 04:19:12,703
THE INVESTIGATION DURING

1012
04:19:12,703 --> 04:19:14,772
THIS PERIOD OF TIME?

1013
04:19:14,772 --> 04:19:16,941
>> IF I CAN RESPOND, THERE

1014
04:19:16,941 --> 04:19:18,909
IS NO AMENDMENT.

1015
04:19:18,909 --> 04:19:20,144
I'M SIMPLY STATING THE

1016
04:19:20,144 --> 04:19:21,245
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD

1017
04:19:21,245 --> 04:19:23,147
BETWEEN US ALL AS S. THAT I

1018
04:19:23,147 --> 04:19:25,049
WOULD HOPE AND I THINK WE

1019
04:19:25,049 --> 04:19:29,086
HAD SOME AGREEMENT BEFORE HA

1020
04:19:29,086 --> 04:19:30,254
THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN,

1021
04:19:30,254 --> 04:19:32,556
I THINK, JUSTIFIABLY

1022
04:19:32,556 --> 04:19:38,262
UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD

1023
04:19:38,262 --> 04:19:39,697
COULD PUBLICLY, IN AN EFFORT

1024
04:19:39,697 --> 04:19:41,198
TO BRING THIS COUNTRY

1025
04:19:41,198 --> 04:19:42,333
TOGETHER, SAY THAT WE WOULD

1026
04:19:42,333 --> 04:19:44,168
FEEL BETTER, I'M NOT

1027
04:19:44,168 --> 04:19:45,536
EXPECTING THEM TO VOTE YES,

1028
04:19:45,536 --> 04:19:47,238
BUT NOT TO COMPLAIN THAT AN

1029
04:19:47,238 --> 04:19:51,041
FBI INVESTIGATION HAS NOT

1030
04:19:51,041 --> 04:19:51,575
OCCURRED.

1031
04:19:51,575 --> 04:19:52,509
AND THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING

1032
04:19:52,509 --> 04:19:53,277
TO DO.

1033
04:19:53,277 --> 04:19:54,578
THIS COUNTRY IS BEING RIPPED

1034
04:19:54,578 --> 04:19:55,145
APART HERE.

1035
04:19:55,145 --> 04:19:57,581
AND WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE

1036
04:19:57,581 --> 04:19:59,149
THAT WE DO DUE DILIGENCE.

1037
04:19:59,149 --> 04:20:00,451
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE HAS

1038
04:20:00,451 --> 04:20:01,786
DONE A GOOD JOB, BUT I DO

1039
04:20:01,786 --> 04:20:06,157
THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE A

1040
04:20:06,157 --> 04:20:07,891
SHORT PAUSE AND MAKE SURE

1041
04:20:07,891 --> 04:20:10,427
THAT THE FBI CAN

1042
04:20:10,427 --> 04:20:10,827
INVESTIGATE.

1043
04:20:10,827 --> 04:20:11,595
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

1044
04:20:11,595 --> 04:20:12,930
SOME OF US WOULD HAVE TO AND

1045
04:20:12,930 --> 04:20:14,598
I'M PREPARED TO DO IT, MAKE

1046
04:20:14,598 --> 04:20:16,000
A REQUEST TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1047
04:20:16,000 --> 04:20:19,370
TO ASK THE FBI TO DO THAT

1048
04:20:19,370 --> 04:20:19,803
INVESTIGATION.

1049
04:20:19,803 --> 04:20:22,406
IT WOULD BE SHORT, AND

1050
04:20:22,406 --> 04:20:24,074
LIMITED IN SCOPE TO THE

1051
04:20:24,074 --> 04:20:24,708
CURRENT ALLEGATIONS THAT

1052
04:20:24,708 --> 04:20:26,577
HAVE BEEN MADE.

1053
04:20:26,577 --> 04:20:28,846
BUT, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE

1054
04:20:28,846 --> 04:20:30,080
THE DEMOCRATS WHO WE TALKED

1055
04:20:30,080 --> 04:20:31,649
TO BEFORE TO ENDORSE THAT

1056
04:20:31,649 --> 04:20:33,584
KIND OF THING, THAT WE CAN

1057
04:20:33,584 --> 04:20:35,452
THEN MOVE ON.

1058
04:20:35,452 --> 04:20:37,220
>> MR. CHAIRMAN?

1059
04:20:37,220 --> 04:20:38,956
>> BECAUSE OF THE TWO HOUR

1060
04:20:38,956 --> 04:20:42,860
RULE, WE ARE ADJOURNED.

1061
04:20:42,860 --> 04:20:44,494
>> WHAT?

1062
04:20:44,494 --> 04:20:46,297
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT,

1063
04:20:46,297 --> 04:20:47,431
YOU HEARD SOMEBODY JUST

1064
04:20:47,431 --> 04:20:48,933
SAYING TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY,

1065
04:20:48,933 --> 04:20:49,233
WHAT?

1066
04:20:49,233 --> 04:20:50,801
WE'RE ADJOURNING TWO HOUR

1067
04:20:50,801 --> 04:20:51,101
RULE.

1068
04:20:51,101 --> 04:20:52,803
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THERE, I

1069
04:20:52,803 --> 04:20:54,471
DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE AT

1070
04:20:54,471 --> 04:20:56,373
LEAST IN THE OPEN ERA EVER

1071
04:20:56,373 --> 04:20:58,642
SEEN AND THAT IS SENATOR

1072
04:20:58,642 --> 04:21:00,811
JEFF FLAKE WENT INTO THAT

1073
04:21:00,811 --> 04:21:02,012
SMALL ANTE ROOM THAT WE WERE

1074
04:21:02,012 --> 04:21:03,113
SPEAKING OF JUST BEFORE THEY

1075
04:21:03,113 --> 04:21:06,050
TOOK THE VOTE AND HE CUT A

1076
04:21:06,050 --> 04:21:07,918
DEAL OF SOME SORTS WITH THE

1077
04:21:07,918 --> 04:21:09,253
DEMOCRATS AND THEN IT WASN'T

1078
04:21:09,253 --> 04:21:11,422
CLEAR WHAT HE CUT.

1079
04:21:11,422 --> 04:21:13,290
SO, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY SAID A

1080
04:21:13,290 --> 04:21:16,660
POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE

1081
04:21:16,660 --> 04:21:18,128
ALLOWS SENATOR JEFF FLAKE TO

1082
04:21:18,128 --> 04:21:19,363
EXPLAIN TO US BASICALLY WHAT

1083
04:21:19,363 --> 04:21:20,097
JUST HAPPENED.

1084
04:21:20,097 --> 04:21:21,365
SO SENATOR FLAKE SAID, YOU

1085
04:21:21,365 --> 04:21:22,333
KNOW WHAT?

1086
04:21:22,333 --> 04:21:23,567
I'M GOING TO VOTE YES ON THE

1087
04:21:23,567 --> 04:21:24,935
MOTION TO REPORT THE

1088
04:21:24,935 --> 04:21:25,502
NOMINATION OF BRETT

1089
04:21:25,502 --> 04:21:27,771
KAVANAUGH TO THE FULL SENATE

1090
04:21:27,771 --> 04:21:30,174
FLOOR; HOWEVER, I AGREE WITH

1091
04:21:30,174 --> 04:21:32,243
MY DEMOCRAT FRIEND, SENATOR

1092
04:21:32,243 --> 04:21:33,577
CHRIS COONS AND OTHERS THAT

1093
04:21:33,577 --> 04:21:35,880
THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST A

1094
04:21:35,880 --> 04:21:41,752
WEEK, NOT AT LEAST TRIMMED

1095
04:21:41,752 --> 04:21:43,821
TO A WEEK AND TRIMMED IN

1096
04:21:43,821 --> 04:21:44,721
SCOPE FBI INVESTIGATION INTO

1097
04:21:44,721 --> 04:21:45,756
THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD

1098
04:21:45,756 --> 04:21:48,259
FROM DR. BLASEY FORD AND

1099
04:21:48,259 --> 04:21:48,826
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH

1100
04:21:48,826 --> 04:21:50,094
YESTERDAY.

1101
04:21:50,094 --> 04:21:51,928
AND WITNESSES THAT WERE

1102
04:21:51,928 --> 04:21:53,197
COMING FORTH WHO SAID THEY

1103
04:21:53,197 --> 04:21:53,998
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND

1104
04:21:53,998 --> 04:21:55,266
HEROES WHO SAID THEY DIDN'T

1105
04:21:55,266 --> 04:21:56,267
REMEMBER ANYTHING AND

1106
04:21:56,267 --> 04:21:58,035
AFFIDAVITS AND ALL OF THAT

1107
04:21:58,035 --> 04:22:00,304
THE FBI GETS A PEEK AT THIS.

1108
04:22:00,304 --> 04:22:01,639
WELL, AS SENATOR LINDSEY

1109
04:22:01,639 --> 04:22:02,940
GRAHAM SAID, YEAH, IT

1110
04:22:02,940 --> 04:22:04,074
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

1111
04:22:04,074 --> 04:22:05,376
IT'S NOT UP TO YOU JEFF

1112
04:22:05,376 --> 04:22:06,810
FLAKE AND WE REALIZE THAT

1113
04:22:06,810 --> 04:22:08,312
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT WHEN

1114
04:22:08,312 --> 04:22:09,813
IT COMES TO THE FULL SENATE

1115
04:22:09,813 --> 04:22:11,115
FLOOR, HOWEVER, IT'S UP TO

1116
04:22:11,115 --> 04:22:12,549
CHUCK SCHUMER AND MITCH

1117
04:22:12,549 --> 04:22:13,651
MCCONNELL TO WORK OUT A

1118
04:22:13,651 --> 04:22:13,984
DEAL.

1119
04:22:13,984 --> 04:22:15,219
MITCH MCCONNELL IS THE

1120
04:22:15,219 --> 04:22:16,820
