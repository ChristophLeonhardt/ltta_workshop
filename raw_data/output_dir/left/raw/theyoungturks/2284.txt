2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:14,400
ARKANSAS Ã± HE ONE DAY WAS NAMED
TO THE BOARD OF THE COUNTRY

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,960
MUSIC ASSOCIATION FOUNDATION,
THE FUNDRAISING ARM OF THE

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,640
COUNTRY MUSIC ASSOCIATION, AND
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS GONE, WHY?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,500
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO STEPPED UP
AND HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIS

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:36,420
STANCE ON GAY MARRIAGE.

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:50,239
MIKE 

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,739
HUCKABEE SAYS HE WAS FORCED
TO RESIGN AND THEN HE WENT

9
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,549
TO FOX NEWS TO CRY ABOUT IT.

10
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,499
HERE IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO.

11
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:04,209
>>TODAY THE NEW DIRECTION OF THE
LEFT IS IN THE NAME OF TOLERANCE

12
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,580
BE INTOLERANT, IN THE NAME OF
LOVE-HATE PEOPLE, AND THE NAME

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,880
OF DIVERSITY DEMAND CONFORMITY
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE ARE.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,159
IS NOT TO SAY I DISAGREE AND I
WISH THIS PERSON WOULD CHANGE

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,869
HIS MIND, IT IS LET'S PUT THEM
OUT OF BUSINESS, LET'S CLOSE THE

16
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,380
STORE, LET'S NOT ALLOW HIM TO
CONTINUE TO OPERATE A BUSINESS.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,720
LET'S DAMAGE THEM
PROFESSIONALLY, LET'S HURT

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,720
HIS BRAND.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,350
IT IS ALL ABOUT DESTROYING THE
OTHER SIDE RATHER THAN

20
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,719
DISAGREEING WITH THE OTHER SIDE.

21
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,909
THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF AMERICA
WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

22
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,280
RAINS AND PEOPLE ARE FREE.

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:02:10,489
IT IS LET'S DESTROY EVERYONE WHO
DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.

24
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,570
>> SO YOU NOT BEING ON A BOARD
FOR COUNTRY MUSIC, YOU WILL

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:22,890
LIVE, THAT IS A CHOICE THAT THEY
ARE MAKING.

26
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,420
IF YOU GET YOUR WAY PASSING
THE LAWS THAT DISCRIMINATE

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,900
LEGALLY AGAINST GAY AMERICANS,
THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:39,860
CHOICE AND IT IS EXCLUSION BY
DEFINITION.

29
00:02:39,860 --> 00:03:02,080
YOU ARE LEGALLY GOING AFTER GAY
AMERICANS AND THAT IS 

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
WHAT

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:14,130
WE ARE TRYING TO PREVENT.

32
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,930
>>DON'T PLAY THE VICTIM HERE.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,361
I'M GOING TO PREVENT ALL OF THAT
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU I

34
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,040
LOVE YOU BROTHER IF YOU WOULD
JUST CHANGE EVERYTHING

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,030
ABOUT YOUR IDENTITY THAT I WOULD
LOVE YOU.

36
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:48,850
I'M NOT INTERESTED 

37
00:03:48,850 --> 00:00:00,000
IN YOUR LOVE.
