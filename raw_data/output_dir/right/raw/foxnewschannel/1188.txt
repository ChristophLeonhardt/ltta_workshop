SAY IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

SET UNDER THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE

70

THAT NO ONE CAN BE A JUDGE IN

HIS OWN CASE, THE PRESIDENT

72
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,699
CANNOT PARDON HIMSELF.

73
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:12,999
1974.

74

>> NIXON HOPED IT WOULD BE

75
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,204
POSSIBLE, BUT IT WASN'T.

MIDDLE OF SPIN WIRE, A POLITICAL

78
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,679
CAMPAIGN THAT RUDY GIULIANI IS

79
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,513

80
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:31,284
DONALD TRUMP AT HIS REQUEST TO

81
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,686
SPIN THINGS A CERTAIN WAY SO AS

82
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,489
TO FORM THE OPINIONS AMONG TRUMP

83
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,425
SUPPORTERS AND OTHERS AND

84
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,426
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS WERE

SUPINE AND COMPLETELY

86
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,495

90
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,702
FIGHTING THAT PARDON THING.

91
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,070
TED CRUZ WENT SILENT FOR 18

92
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,939
SECONDS WHEN ASKED IF IT WAS

93
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,440
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE PRESIDENT

94
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,210
TO FIRE HIMSELF.

95
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,712
HE BOASTED, TO PARDON HIMSELF.

96
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,515
I'M SORRY.

97
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,450
THEY DO NOT PUSH BACK.

98
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,486
THEY SAID IF THAT WAS MY LAWYER,

99
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,221
I WOULD GET A NEW ONE.

100
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:09,889
>> Shannon: SOUNDS LIKE A PUSH

101
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:10,189
BACK.

102
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,858
>> WE ARE TAKING AN OATH TO THE

103
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,292
CONSTITUTION OR NOT THE MAN.

104
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,728
HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO DO THIS.

105
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,396
THEY ARE NEARLY DICTATORIAL

106
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,830
POWERS HE IS DESCRIBING IN THE

107
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,033
20 PAGE MEMO AND THEN THE TWEETS

108
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,933
THIS MORNING.

109
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,101
IT'S OUT OF LINE.

110
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,102
NO ONE PUSHED BACK THAT HARD.

111
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,705
THEY CALLED IT A DISTRACTION.

112
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,939
BOB CORKER WONDERED WHY HE TALKS

113
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,141
THIS WAY.

114
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,709
TAKES AWAY THE SUBJECTS OF THE

115
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:29,976
DAY.

116
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,210
SHANNON, LET'S GET BACK TO THE

117
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,712
FACT THAT THE TRUMP TEAM

118
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,314
COMPLETELY LIED ABOUT THE

119
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,282
TRUMP TOWER MEETING, DESCRIPTION

120
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,017
THAT THE PRESIDENT GAVE MONEY

121
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,685
DICTATED A FULL STATEMENT.

122
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,254
THEY KNOW BOB MUELLER HAS NOT.

123
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:49,028
THEY KNOW THAT THE MAN ON THE

124
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,096
LEGAL TEAM LEFT BECAUSE HE

125
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,832
BELIEVED A COVER-UP WAS IN THE

126
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,100
HATCHING.

127
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,768
>> Shannon: LET'S TALK ABOUT

128
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,069
THIS.

129
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,270
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.

130
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,505
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS

131
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,540
RUDY GIULIANI SAID ABOUT WHY HE

132
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,974
DOESN'T WANT THE PRESIDENT TO

133
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:03,976
TESTIFY BECAUSE HE SAID IF YOU

134
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,411
REMEMBER THINGS DIFFERENTLY, IF

135
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,146
THE ACCOUNTS CHANGE, IT CREATES

136
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,648
A LOT OF PROBLEMS EVEN IF THERE

137
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,483
IS INNOCENT EXPLANATION FOR

138
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,551
EVERYTHING ABOUT WHO DICTATED

139
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,252
THE LETTER, WHAT INPUT THE

140
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:13,719
PRESIDENT HAD.

141
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,254
SEEMS THE STORY IS CHANGE.

142
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,891
GIULIANI SAID NO.

143
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:23,229
BUT THIS IS WHY I DON'T WANT HIM

144
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,467
INTERVIEWING THE PRESIDENT.

145
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,068
>> IT HURTS THEIR CREDIBILITY,

146
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:29,669
NO QUESTION.

147
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,336
AS I LOOK BACK AND I LOOK AT

148
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,672
THESE CLIPS AND I WATCH THEM

149
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:39,612
FROM THE SUNDAY SHOWS, I AM

150
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,347
THINKING WHAT ON EARTH ARE WE

151
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,415
DOING HERE.

152
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,684
WHY ARE WE LISTENING TO THE

153
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,918
PRESIDENT AND HIS TEAM SPECULATE

154
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,920
IN REAL TIME ABOUT WHETHER HE

155
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,821
MIGHT DO SOMETHING THAT THEY

156
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,590
HASTEN TO ADD HE WILL NEVER HAVE

157
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,524
TO DO IT.

158
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,192
TO ME IT'S AN OBVIOUS, IT'S A

159
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:53,726
CRAZY HYPOTHETICAL.

160
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,095
HE WOULD NEVER COME TO THAT.

161
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,131
NEXT QUESTION, NO COMMENT.

162
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,898
INSTEAD, TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN AND

163
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,233
SAYS YOU BET I CAN DO IT WHICH

164
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,535
IS WHY WE ALSO DO HERE DEBATING

165
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,970
THE FINER POINTS OF WHETHER OR

166
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,505
NOT THE PRESIDENT COULD

167
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,807
HYPOTHETICALLY GET TO THAT

168
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,107
POINT.

169
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,175
>> Shannon: AGAIN, HE SAYS

170
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,309
THERE'S NO NEED FOR IT.

171
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,411
HE WANTS TO BE ON THE RECORD

172
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,546
SAYING I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF WHAT

173
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,914
LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE TOLD ME I

174
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,449
WOULD BE RIGHT TO DO THIS.

175
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,485
>> THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT

176
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,887
WHAT ARE THE PRESIDENT LIMITS OF

177
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,288
THE PARDON POWER BUT THERE'S

178
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,656
ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER A

179
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,857
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED.

180
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,392
I THINK WHAT THE FOUNDERS AND

181
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,894
THE WRITERS OF THE CONSTITUTION

182
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,729
ENVISIONED IS THAT A POLITICIAN

183
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,497
THE HEAD OF OUR GOVERNMENT,

184
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,231
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

185
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:33,833
CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THE BEST WAY TO

186
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,268
HANDLE THESE QUESTIONS IS THE

187
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,802
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS THROUGH THE

188
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,371
HOUSE WITH CONVICTION AND THE

189
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:38,704
SENATE.

190
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:39,672
THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER

191
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,807
THE PRESIDENT COULD BE INDICTED,

192
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:42,708
IT HINGES ON THIS QUESTION OF

193
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,677
PARDONS AND HINGES ON THE

194
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,279
QUESTION, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,

195
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,814
WE HAVE BOB MUELLER ACTING MUCH

196
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,217
MORE LIKE A SENATE-CONFIRMED

197
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,151
OFFICER OF THE CONSTITUTION AND

198
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,020
NOT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO WAS PICKED

199
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,987
TO DO A DISCRETE TASK.

200
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,090
THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION.

201
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,492
IS BOB MUELLER BEING MANAGED?

202
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,627
IS HE ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE ON HIS

203
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,295
TEAM AT HIS DISCRETION?

204
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,763
IF THAT'S THE CASE, HE SHOULD BE

205
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,266
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.

206
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:07,767
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL

207
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,504
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS.

208
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,874
DICTATORIAL WHICH YOU KNOW IS

209
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,275
GOING TO UPSET PEOPLE.

210
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,279
>> I SAID NEARLY DICTATORIAL.

211
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,081
>> Shannon: IF THERE ARE

212
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:22,782
ENOUGH PEOPLE CONVINCE THIS

213
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,749
PERSON IS OUT OF LINE WITH HER

214
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,284
HAS COMMITTED A CRIME OR NOT OR

215
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:25,985
PARDON HIMSELF OR NOT, THEY

216
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,454
STILL HAVE A MEANS.

217
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,690
HE IS NOT LIMITLESS IN HIS

218
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:30,990
POWER.

219
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,291
THERE STILL A WAY TO REIN HIM IN

220
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,093
IF THE LAWMAKERS ARE CONVINCED.

221
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,494
SPEAK UP BETWEEN THE MEMO AND

222
00:06:35,494 --> 00:06:36,896
HIS TWEETS COME HE'S BASICALLY

223
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,698
SAYING I CAN TERMINATE THIS AT

224
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,301
ANY TIME.

225
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,469
I CAN'T BE INDICTED.

226
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,271
I CAN PARDON MYSELF.

227
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,273
HE USED THE WORDS "ABSOLUTE

228
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,207
RIGHT."

229
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,208
HE'S PRESENTING HIMSELF AS ABOVE

230
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,510
THE INVESTIGATION LET ALONE THE

231
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,811
LAWS.

232
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,713
THEY ARE PREPARING WE'VE TALKED

233
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,681
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS NOW,

234
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,483
RUDY GIULIANI IS PREPARING A

235
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,686
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IN ORDER TO,

236
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,121
BASICALLY SAYING HE CAN'T BE

237
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,888
INDICTED, HE CAN ONLY BE

238
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:03,256
IMPEACHED.

239
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,524
WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH, THE

240
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:06,993
REASON I RAISED A TRUMP TOWER

241
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:07,693
MEETING IN THE STATEMENT ABOUT

242
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,929
IT IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

243
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,963
MUELLER PERCEIVES IT TO BE AN

244
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,100
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

245
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,167
IS LIKELY TO BE PRESENTED THAT

246
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:15,701
WAY.

247
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,638
THE LETTER FROM JANUARY WITH

248
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,073
THOSE ASSERTIONS IS DESIGNED TO

249
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,210
SAY BUT YOU CAN'T EVEN REALLY

250
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,279
ASSESS IT AS OBSTRUCTION OF

251
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,080
JUSTICE BECAUSE HE CAN'T

252
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,915
OBSTRUCT THE LAW.

253
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:33,085
SO HE IS SAYING TO CONGRESSIONAL

254
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:33,753
REPUBLICANS YOU CAN'T EVEN

255
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,155
IMPEACH HIM FOR OBSTRUCTION OF

256
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,791
JUSTICE.

257
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,594
>> Shannon: IT'S NOT LIKE

258
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,662
YESTERDAY THAT PEOPLE DECIDED

259
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,263
THERE HAD TO BE A P.R. COMPONENT

260
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,098
OF THE POLITICAL FIGHTS THEY ARE

261
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:46,699
WAGING HERE.

262
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,933
THAT IS AS OLD AS TIME.

263
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,702
>> CORRECT.

264
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,570
I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE

265
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,739
ALL SORT OF ANALYZING AND

266
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,740
GRANULAR DETAIL THE CONTENTS OF

267
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,742
THE LETTER, THE 20 PAGE LETTER

268
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,843
THAT WENT OUT IN JANUARY, ALMOST

269
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,146
THE ENTIRE LEGAL TEAM IS GONE

270
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,513
NOW.

271
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,214
YOU COULD ARGUE THAT SOME OF THE

272
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:04,617
ASSERTIONS THEY MADE IN THERE,

273
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,085
THEY ARE OBSOLETE WHICH IS WHY I

274
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,287
AM BAFFLED WHY RUDY AND OTHERS

275
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,022
WOULD EVEN INDULGE THIS

276
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,790
CONVERSATION ABOUT SELF PARDONS.

277
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,091
THAT'S A DISTRACTION RIGHT NOW.

278
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,293
IT'S GETTING WAY AHEAD OF

279
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,695
ANYTHING, AND YET THEY SORT OF

280
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,396
THREW THAT CHUM IN THE WATER

281
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,097
COME OR AT LEAST RESPONDED TO

282
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,099
THE BAIT FROM THE PRESS.

283
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,167
MEN TRUMP DOUBLE DOWN.

284
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,569
I DON'T THINK THAT DOES HIM MUCH

285
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,303
OF A SERVICE.

286
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,105
>> Shannon: WE WILL SEE.

287
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:26,806
THERE IS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL

288
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:27,973
REPORT DUE OUT.

289
00:08:27,973 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE THE MUELLER
