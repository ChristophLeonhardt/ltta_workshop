today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter level political campaign joining us now someone who knows a lot about the history of gutter level political campaigns Jon Meacham presidential historian did we make history over the last several weeks in the animosity not just partisan divides but gender divides in this country over the nomination fight of Judge Brett Kavanaugh I think we reached historic levels of exacerbation of those divisions absolutely and I think that one of the things that I find so interesting about Senator Collins of speech is she was voting to confirm a vision of Brett Kavanaugh that would had far more in common with Susan Collins than it does with judge Kavanaugh if you take the first part of her speech she was casting him as a centrist not as a conservative which flies in the face of the political calculus of the moment if he were such a centrist why is the right so determined to have this particular man on the court and so the real Brett Kavanaugh when the question is going forward because make no mistake 40 years of American jurisprudence just got a shape today 40 years and the one of the things is going to be fascinating is is Brett Kavanaugh the Kavanagh who showed up which justice Cavanaugh going to be the one who showed up and made that partisan kree decor last week or is it the Kavanagh that Collin's think she's voting for and a lot hangs in the balance and the answer that question well Jon Meacham you mean you've studied American presidents since the first American president what do you think I mean do you think that a man shows his full stripes under the circumstances Brett Kavanaugh found himself in last Thursday or do you think the political life we witnessed before last Thursday is the true man I think he's closer to where he was last week than the one Collins wanted him to be unquestionably if you look at the world out of which he came world familiar to you it's the conservative legal world of Washington is the Federalist Society its original intent it's a very button-down but somewhat radical actually legal movement that in its way is as radical as the living Constitution of the left because if you if you put your own interpretation of original intent as the central judicial criteria it is still your interpretation of that original intent and so I think that we're gonna have we've had this struggle now for 30 years or more the other thing I think that's important to understand historically and I think to understand the passions around this is Republicans far more often than Democrats have been disappointed in the people who their presidents put on the court this begins in 1953 with Dwight Eisenhower who also put brennan on the court Richard Nixon who had four appointments and except for justice Rehnquist they turned out to be far more centrist than the right hoped for George HW Bush and David Souter the insistence of the Conservatives since 1990 has been that we are always going to know exactly what we're getting and that's a and that's that the core of this I think and that's who judge Kavanagh is and he shouldn't be apologetic about it that's who he is and that's in the president's appointed and that's in 51 senators are confirming but I wouldn't be distracted by senator Collins's attempt to turn him into some creature out of the Brookings Institution my last question is personal for it for you I mean we don't talk enough about the human beings and I think I am Donald Trump's inauguration speech about human carnage when I watched professor Ford whose life has been destroyed since this incident obviously who overcame that trauma and testified before the country and the world and in judge Cavanaugh's life is it will never be what it was before what do you make of this moment and just human human carnage and inhuman calamity I've had a window that I would trade with anyone on earth into what this has done to the Cavanaugh's and and their circle of friends and and their and their people who support and and love him and I've had a window into what this has done to women who are survivors of sexual assault themselves and everyone's gutted it's brutal and it's you're exactly right one of the things we have to remember in all these moments is that these aren't caricatures these aren't cardboard people they are flesh-and-blood human beings most of the time they're trying to do the best they can through what phrase I love a George Eliot the Victorian novelist talked about trying to do the best you could through dim lights and tangled circumstance which I've always thought was a perfect way of explaining life itself but certainly life in the in the in the arena unquestionably there are damaged people here and the process is brutal I think that's one of the legacies of this I do think it's going to be harder to get people to raise their hand and go into the arena and I think that's a tragedy unquestionably though I think ultimately character is destiny and again going forward what affects all of us is we'll just as Cavanagh be able to put this behind him in a way that makes him a better justice for the next 40 years or so try to meet him thank you for Spencer hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if
