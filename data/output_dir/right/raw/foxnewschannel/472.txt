00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:07,632
BIG HEALTHY BUCKET OF TRUMP.

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,166
SO NOW THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS

3
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:09,967
MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:11,702
HE'S GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD A

5
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:13,070
BETTER PLACE TOO.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,940
BUT IS THE WORLD READY FOR THAT?

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,011
HERE'S TRUMP PULLING A GORDON

8
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,480
RAMSAY AT THE U.N. ABOUT TO TELL

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,817
THEM THAT THEIR MENU SUCKS.

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,252
>> MY ADMINISTRATION HAS

11
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:29,020
ACCOMPLISHED MORE THAN ALMOST

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,455
ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE

13
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:39,063
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

14
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:42,433
DIDN'T EXPECT THAT REACTION, BUT

15
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:43,468
THAT'S OKAY.

16
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:45,703
>> LAUGH IF YOU MUST, YOU SMALL

17
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:46,971
MEANINGLESS BUREAUCRATS.

18
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,140
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE LATELY

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,441
BESIDES BOOZING ON OUR DIME AND

20
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,609
CHASING HOOKERS?

21
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,444
LOVE IT OR HATE IT, TRUMP IS THE

22
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:54,746
LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD AND

23
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:57,648
HE'S READY TO GIVE THE PLANET A

24
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:58,916
LITTLE TOUGH LOVE.

25
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,587
>> GERMANY WILL BECOME TOTALLY

26
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:04,721
DEPENDENT ON RUSSIAN ENERGY IF

27
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,425
IT DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY CHANGE

28
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:07,792
COURSE.

29
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,894
MOVING FORWARD, WE ARE ONLY

30
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:12,497
GOING TO GIVE FOREIGN AID TO

31
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:14,032
THOSE WHO RESPECT US.

32
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,067
OPEC NATIONS ARE AS USUAL

33
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:19,637
RIPPING OFF THE REST OF THE

34
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,038
WORLD.

35
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,608
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

36
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:24,910
NOBODY SHOULD LIKE IT.

37
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,277
[LAUGHTER]

38
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:27,679
GREG: NOBODY SHOULD LIKE IT.

39
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,614
HE'S LIKE THE AMERICAN SANTA.

40
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:32,084
HE'S TELLING THE WORLD WHO HAS

41
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,653
BEEN NAUGHTY AND NICE, BUT

42
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,121
EVERYBODY'S NAUGHTY.

43
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:36,488
[LAUGHTER]

44
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,990
GREG: EVERYBODY ON HIS LIST IS

45
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,324
NAUGHTY.

46
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:41,593
AND HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

47
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:43,195
>> I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING

48
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,130
IN CUBA, AND I CERTAINLY DON'T

49
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,200
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

50
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,701
VENEZUELA.

51
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:50,635
IRAN IS GOING TO COME BACK TO ME

52
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,770
AND THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A

53
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,139
GOOD DEAL, I THINK, MAYBE NOT,

54
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,873
YOU NEVER KNOW.

55
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,174
YEMEN IS A MESS.

56
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:57,275
SYRIA IS A MESS.

57
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,378
NOT HAPPY WITH OPEC.

58
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,246
I LIKE CHINA, AND I LIKE

59
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,947
PRESIDENT XI A LOT.

60
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,281
I THINK HE'S A FRIEND OF MINE.

61
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,018
HE MAY NOT BE A FRIEND OF MINE

62
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:06,752
ANYMORE.

63
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,420
GREG: HE'S GOT AN OPINION ON

64
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,854
EVERYONE.

65
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,590
TO HIM EARTH IS JUST ANOTHER

66
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,860
LOCATION FOR CELEBRITY

67
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,260
APPRENTICE.

[LAUGHTER]

69
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:16,995
GREG: CUBA YOU'RE FIRED.

70
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:18,463
AND OF COURSE THERE'S THAT

71
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,731
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.

72
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:21,400
THEY PLAY HARD TO GET.

73
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,667
IT IS LIKE A GEOPOLITICAL

74
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,239
VERSION OF ROSS AND RACHEL FROM

75
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:27,606

[LAUGHTER]

85
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,961

00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:50,295
AMAZING.

87
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,863
AND WHO COULD FORGET THE LETTER,

88
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:56,368
THE MAGNIFICENT LETTERS?

THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE -- THIS IS

92
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,741
A HISTORIC LETTER.

HE WROTE ME TWO OF THE MOST

94
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:04,943
BEAUTIFUL LETTERS.

95
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,112
I HAVE RECEIVED TWO LETTERS FROM

THEY'RE LETTERS THAT ARE

GREG: CHARLES, IT'S SO

216
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,758
INTERESTING WHEN THERE ARE

217
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:13,093
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THAT PRESS

218
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:14,227
CONFERENCE AND THEY ACT LIKE IT

219
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,128
IS SOME KIND OF WEIRD FREAK

220
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:17,264
SHOW, AND I'M LOOKING AT IT, AND

221
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,232
I'M GOING I'M WATCHING A GUY

222
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:22,035
WITH AN INCREDIBLY NIMBLE MIND

223
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,337
BOUNCE ALL OVER EVERY SINGLE

224
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,305
ISSUE AND TALK ABOUT FIXING THEM

225
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:28,141
AS THOUGH IT'S A CONSTRUCTION

226
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:28,475
PROJECT.

227
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:28,842
>> YEAH.

228
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,944
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ALSO, I MEAN,

229
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:33,447
THE GUY'S COMEDIC TIMING IS

230
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:34,214
JUST -- IT IS KILLER.

231
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:37,117
WHEN HE DID THE THING ABOUT

232
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:38,352
TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT THE

233
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:40,654
ADMINISTRATION IS, AND EVERYBODY

234
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:42,255
LAUGHED, AND IN THIS ROOM

235
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,157
EVERYBODY LAUGHED, THEY LAUGHED

236
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:46,126
AT THE EXACT RIGHT TIME, THE GUY

237
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,829
TOTALLY GETS IT.

238
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:51,932
IT'S THAT HUMOR THAT -- AND OF

239
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,834
COURSE ALL THESE DESPITS IN THE

240
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,637
WORLD AND IN THE ROOM WHO GOT IT

241
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:58,138
JUST PROVING THAT OF COURSE THE

242
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,873
PRESS HAS LESS OF A SENSE OF

243
00:07:59,873 --> 00:08:02,209
HUMOR THAN DESPOTS AROUND THE

244
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:02,509
WORLD.

245
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:03,577
BUT THE OTHER THING IS THAT

246
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:04,945
BASICALLY THE ATTACK ON DONALD

247
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:07,147
TRUMP RIGHT NOW IS THAT HE'S NOT

248
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:07,481
PERFECT.

249
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:08,515
THAT'S WHAT UPSETS THEM.

250
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,951
SO WHEN HE GOES AND TALKS -- AND

251
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:15,756
MEETS WITH KIM JONG-UN, KIM

252
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,958
JONG-IL, THE COMPLAINT IS YOU

253
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,726
HAVEN'T GOTTEN PEACE FAST

254
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,193
ENOUGH.

255
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:20,227
ABSOLUTELY THE GUY CAN'T WIN.

256
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:22,296
THEY CONSTANTLY -- THEY DID THIS

257
00:08:22,296 --> 00:08:23,230
THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN.

258
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,565
THEY ARE CONTINUING TO DO IT.

259
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:27,568
THEY CONSTANTLY MOVE THE GOAL

260
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:27,868
POST.

261
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:29,136
GREG: CHARLIE BRINGS UP A GOOD

262
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,171
POINT WHICH IS RARE, MADISON.

263
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:31,538
[LAUGHTER]

264
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:35,174
GREG: THE MEDIA IS WRONG ABOUT

265
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:37,077
TRUMP BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT

266
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,879
THE WORLD FINDS HIM COMICAL OR

267
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,881
WEIRD, BUT I HAVE A THEORY THAT

268
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:43,751
A LOT OF THE WORLD ISN'T LIKE

269
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,118
MANHATTAN.

270
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,986
THE WORLD IS PRETTY OLD SCHOOL

271
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:46,287
ALPHA.

272
00:08:46,287 --> 00:08:48,022
THEY ARE LIKE 30 YEARS, 40 YEARS

273
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,990
BACK WHEN PEOPLE -- WHEN THE

274
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,058
WORLD LEADERS WERE LIKE TRUMP.

275
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,461
SO HE'S KIND OF ENTERTAINING OR

276
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,396
REFRESHING OR SOMETHING.

277
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,797
THAT'S MY THEORY.

278
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,499
FEEL FREE TO IGNORE IT AND

279
00:08:58,499 --> 00:08:59,200
ANSWER THE OWN QUESTION THAT

280
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,834
MIGHT BE IN YOUR MIND.

281
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,802
>> I THINK IT WAS VERY FUNNY AT

282
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,536
HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.

283
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:04,238
I THINK HE'S HILARIOUS A LOT OF

284
00:09:04,238 --> 00:09:05,272
THE TIMES.

285
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:08,342
I THINK HE'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND

286
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:10,311
THAT'S THE THING THE MEDIA FAILS

287
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,078
TO REPORT ON.

288
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:14,081
LOOK AT THE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL

289
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:15,116
WEEK WITH U.N. THIS WEEK.

290
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,317
OPENED TRADE TALKS WITH JAPAN.

291
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,519
OF COURSE GOING AFTER CHINA WHO

292
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,554
NO PRESIDENT BEFORE IN 25 YEARS

293
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:21,789
HAS REALLY GONE AFTER FOR THEIR

294
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:23,324
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES.

295
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:24,458
THEY SAID YOU KNOW HE COULD

296
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,893
NEVER HAVE PEACE IN CERTAIN

297
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:26,460
AREAS, GUESS WHAT?

298
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,195
LOOK WHAT HE'S DOING WITH NORTH

299
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:28,496
KOREA.

300
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:29,196
ONLY THE BEGINNING THERE.

301
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:30,698
I THINK PEOPLE ARE IGNORING THE

302
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:32,900
FACT THAT HE'S BEEN EXTREMELY

303
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,135
SUCCESSFUL, JUDGING HIM ON WORDS

304
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,804
INSTEAD OF ACTIONS AND RESULTS.

305
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:38,172
GREG: UH-HUH.

306
00:09:38,172 --> 00:09:41,008
OKAY KAT, I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,

307
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:43,711
HE'S CHANGING THE WORLD WITHOUT

308
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:44,011
BOMBS.

309
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:45,746
AND I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I

310
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,848
WOULD CALL PROGRESS, MAYBE?

311
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:48,950
>> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

312
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,518
I DO LIKE ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE

313
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:51,986
TENDS TO WANT TO USE DIPLOMACY

314
00:09:51,986 --> 00:09:53,487
AND TALKING AND MAKING DEALS

315
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:54,922
RATHER THAN JUST GOING TO WAR

316
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:55,389
WITH EVERYONE.

317
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:56,324
I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING

318
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:58,192
THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING IN THE

319
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:59,227
GENERAL ELECTION.

320
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:00,795
HE WAS RUNNING AGAINST HILARY

321
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,197
CLINTON EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A

322
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:06,267
DEMOCRAT, SHE WAS A NEO

323
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:06,634
DEMOCRAT.

324
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:07,802
I THINK WE WOULD BE AT WAR RIGHT

325
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:10,504
NOW IN PLACES THAT WE'RE NOT AT

326
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:12,173
WAR IF WE HAD HILARY CLINTON AS

327
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,040
PRESIDENT INSTEAD OF DONALD

328
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,341
TRUMP.

329
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,076
GREG: PROBABLY WITH CANADA.

330
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,278
>> WE MIGHT BE AT WAR WITH

331
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:17,612
CANADA.

332
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:26,287
GREG: YEAH, AUSTRALIA.

333
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,021
ANY THOUGHTS?

334
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:29,223
>> I MEAN, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

335
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:29,957
ROSS AND RACHEL AGAIN.

336
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,926
GREG: OKAY, GO AHEAD.

337
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,061
>> I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD HAVE

338
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,162
TAKEN THAT LONG FOR THEM TO WORK

339
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:36,764
IT OUT.

340
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:37,632
GREG: THAT IS TRUE.

341
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:39,934
THAT'S GETTING A SMATTERING OF

342
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:40,301
APPLAUSE.

343
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,904
>> THEY WERE ON A BREAK.

344
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,172
>> WHEN HE SPEAKS TO THE WORLD,

345
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,474
WHEN HE GIVES HIS SPEECHES, A

346
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:56,918
LOT LIKE SOMEONE WHO JUST BEAT

347
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:58,753
THE ONE ON A CASE, BUT HE SHOWS

348
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,089
UP AT A BARBECUE, I KNOW WHAT

349
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:01,789
EVERYONE DID BUT I'M HERE.

350
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,525
THE LAUGHING IS A LOT OF NERVOUS

351
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,059
LAUGHING.

352
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:05,626
GREG: THAT'S TRUE.

353
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,029
>> HE'S COMING FROM A PLACE OF

354
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:09,664
POWER AND I THINK HE'S PROBABLY

355
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:10,565
ONE -- I CAN'T REMEMBER A

356
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:11,933
PRESIDENT WHO CHOSE TO USE IT.

357
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,835
LIKE LISTEN TO ME WHEN I SPEAK.

358
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:14,569
GREG: YEAH.

359
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:17,205
>> IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE GOING TO

360
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:17,906
WISH YOU HAD.

361
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:19,007
IT'S VERY UNDERLYING.

362
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:21,376
HE KIND OF TALKS IN A WAY VERY

363
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,143
SIMILAR LIKE WHEN SOMEONE

364
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,044
BORROWS MONEY FROM ME AND THEY

365
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:23,845
DON'T PAY IT BACK.

366
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,280
GREG: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

367
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,150
>> HE APPEALS TO YOUR SENSES,

368
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,719
LIKE SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, JOE YOU

369
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,621
LIKE WALKING.

370
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:32,988
[LAUGHTER]

371
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:34,990
>> JOE WILL SAY YES I DO.

372
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,925
WELL, FOR YOU TO CONTINUE TO DO

373
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,260
SO, YOU NEED TO PAY ME THE MONEY

374
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,028
I LENT YOU PLUS 10%.

375
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:40,395
[LAUGHTER]

376
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,497
