1
00:00:01,506 --> 00:00:00,471
AN INTERESTING PART OF    OF THI

2
00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:02,707
SEE WHAT COMES OF IT.

3
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:02,941
AN INTERESTING PART OF    OF THE

4
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:03,575
I DO.

5
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:04,409
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:07,245
TONIGHT'S LEGAL EAGLES TO REACT

7
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:10,215
TO ALL OF THE KAVANAUGH NEWS.

8
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:10,915
PRESIDENT OF A LION FOR JUDGES

9
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,417
AND THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR

10
00:00:12,417 --> 00:00:13,952
JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK, CARRIE

11
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:14,319
SEVERINO.

12
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,421
THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING.

13
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:19,891
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THOSE THAT ARE

14
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,592
COMMITTEE TALKS WITH MAN THAT

15
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:21,426
SAYS IT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE.

16
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:24,563
>> I DON'T MAKE MUCH OF IT,

17
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:27,966
FRANKLY.

18
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:29,167
THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT HAVE

19
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:31,570
BEEN GATHERED DURING AN FBI

20
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,138
INVESTIGATION.

21
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:33,772
I ASSUME IT WAS REPUBLICAN

22
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,575
SENATORS ON THE PHONE WITH

23
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:36,908
SOMEONE.

24
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,610
>> Shannon: WHAT MAN WOULD

25
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,578
TURN HIMSELF IN?

26
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,512
>> IT'S VERY REMINISCENT OF A

27
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:44,115
STORY WE HEARD VERY SIMILAR TO

28
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:47,853
THIS ONE, JUST LAST WEEK, WHEN

29
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,455
ED WHELAN BLAMED SOME OTHER GUY

30
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:51,790
FOR COMMITTING THE ASSAULT.

31
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,592
>> Shannon: CARRIE, WHAT MAN

32
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:54,326
WOULD COME FORWARD AND EXPOSE

33
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:56,394
THEMSELVES TO THIS KIND OF

34
00:00:56,394 --> 00:00:59,798
CRIMINAL ACCUSATION?

35
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:01,066
THERE ARE SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW.

36
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,000
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,437
IT BECAUSE WITHOUT A LOT OF

38
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,973
STUFF TO RUN, ALLEGATIONS BEING

39
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,207
MADE EARLIER TODAY, THINGS LIKE

40
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:09,508
THAT.

41
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:13,145
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

42
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:17,215
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT I

43
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:18,984
THINK, 1982, THE STATUTE OF

44
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:20,752
LIMITATIONS WOULD HAVE PASSED ON

45
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:21,186
THAT.

46
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:21,787
WHO KNOWS.

47
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:24,056
I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE.

48
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,391
MAYBE TOMORROW.

49
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:27,259
HOPEFULLY WE'LL LEARN MORE.

50
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,226
>> Shannon: VERY INTERESTING.

51
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:29,327
>> ONE THING WE DO KNOW, THEY

52
00:01:29,327 --> 00:01:34,199
WILL ASK HER, REPUBLICANS WILL

53
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,333
CERTAINLY ASK DR. BLASEY FORD

54
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,203
ABOUT THIS AND I ASSUME SHE WILL

55
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:39,571
HAVE A VERY MEASURED, CREDIBLE

56
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,607
ANSWER.

57
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,642
>> IT GOES TO WHETHER SHE IS

58
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,677
RUBBER AGAIN CORRECTLY, WHICH IS

59
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:46,211
THE CRUX.

60
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,013
>> Shannon: IF THIS IS A SWORN

61
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:48,747
STATEMENT AND WHETHER HIS NAME

62
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:50,249
GOES PUBLIC, IT WILL BE

63
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:51,216
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT TO SEE

64
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,050
HOW SHE REACT TO THIS.

65
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,518
I THINK WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD

66
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:54,987
TO HEARING FROM HER.

67
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,955
YOU HEARD FROM THE POLYGRAPH

68
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:57,890
EXPERT THAT WE HAD WITH HER AND

69
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,825
HIS ACCOUNT OF WHAT SHE TOLD

70
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:00,793
HIM.

71
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:01,927
HE STUCK TO HER, THE COMMITTEE

72
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,162
HASN'T.

73
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:04,997
WE'LL HEAR FROM HER TOMORROW.

74
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:06,965
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE EXPECT.

75
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:08,300
THIS IS WHAT G.O.P.

76
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,735
SENATOR KENNEDY WHO IS A MEMBER

77
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:10,469
OF THE COMMITTEE SAID ABOUT HOW

78
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,005
THIS IS GOING TO GO TOMORROW.

79
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:21,046
>> WE HAVE NO PLANS WHATSOEVER

80
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:14,673
MOMENTS ORACLE CATWOMAN OR THATA

81
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:21,914
TO TRY TO HAVE ANY GOT YOUR

82
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:22,981
MOMENTS ORACLE CATWOMAN OR THATN

83
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:24,516
ON ANYBODY IN THE PURPOSE

84
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:26,251
OF THIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS

85
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,054
IS TO ALLOW DR. FORD AND

86
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,556
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO TELL THEIR

87
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:32,391
STORIES THEIR STORIES.

88
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:32,925
>> Shannon: HER TEAM

89
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:33,792
NEGOTIATED TO    TO THE SENATE

90
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:34,326
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

91
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:35,661
THEY'VE ARRIVED AT THIS.

92
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:38,097
DO YOU FEEL IT WILL BE A FAIR

93
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:38,430
PROCESS?

94
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,032
ARE YOU SATISFIED WE'LL HEAR

95
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,733
FROM EVERYBODY AND HEAR BOTH

96
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:42,034
SIDES?

97
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,969
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

98
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,939
I DO THINK THAT SHE WILL PROVIDE

99
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,377
A VERY SERIOUS, COMPELLING,

100
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,580
POWERFUL, CREDIBLE STORY

101
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,214
TOMORROW.

102
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:57,015
BUT DO I THINK THE PROCESS HAS

103
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:57,383
BEEN FAIR?

104
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,819
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

105
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,220
>> Shannon: WILL TOMORROW BE

106
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,520
FAIR?

107
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,356
>> I THINK IT REMAINS TO BE

108
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:04,757
SEEN.

109
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:07,193
HOWEVER, IT IS INTERESTING TO

110
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:10,596
SEE THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS --

111
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,298
SEVERAL OF THEM -- HAVE ALREADY

112
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:13,566
VILIFIED AND BULLIED HER.

113
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:15,468
EVEN BEFORE THEY HAVE HEARD HER

114
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:19,372
COMMENTS TOMORROW.

115
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:21,207
IT'S LIKE 27 YEARS AGO WITH

116
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:21,607
ANITA HILL.

117
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,010
>> Shannon: HOW ARE THEY

118
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,578
PULLING HER?

119
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,345
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS ALREADY

120
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:30,416
TRIED TO DISCREDIT HER STORY.

121
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,217
ORRIN HATCH, WHO WAS THERE 27

122
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:34,253
YEARS AGO WITH ANITA HILL, HAS

123
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,322
SAID THAT SHE MADE UP HER STORY.

124
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,257
>> Shannon: HOW DO YOU THINK

125
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:38,858
THAT CONTRASTS WITH THE

126
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:39,825
DEMOCRATS WHO ALREADY FOUND HIM

127
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,060
GUILTY WITHOUT HEARING FROM THE

128
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,595
TWO OF THEM?

129
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:44,997
>> I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF

130
00:03:44,997 --> 00:03:46,766
SPACE BETWEEN SAYING THIS STORY

131
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,201
DOESN'T ADD UP AND -- I DON'T

132
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,202
THINK ANYONE IS SAYING SHE'S

133
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:49,836
MAKING THE STUFF UP.

134
00:03:49,836 --> 00:03:51,671
I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF, WE ARE

135
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,407
TALKING ABOUT 30 SOME YEARS AGO,

136
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:55,541
AND MEMORIES GO TO BEEN

137
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,644
CONFUSED, GOOD FAITH, SO I DO

138
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,213
THINK SHE -- THIS WILL BE AN

139
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:01,047
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM BOTH

140
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,715
SIDES.

141
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,117
I'M EXCITED TO HEAR THAT IT

142
00:04:04,117 --> 00:04:05,718
WON'T JUST BE 21 DIFFERENT

143
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,452
SENATORS QUESTIONING.

144
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:07,820
I WISH BOTH SIDES HAD GONE THE

145
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,156
ROUTE OF HAVING AN EXPERIENCED

146
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,457
PERSON HAVE A COHERENT PLAN OF

147
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:11,858
QUESTIONING.

148
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:13,993
I THINK IT WILL BE VERY VALUABLE

149
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:15,228
TO FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO

150
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:15,828
THROUGH THIS.

151
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:17,797
NO, THIS HAS NOT BEEN A FAIR

152
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:18,130
PROCESS.

153
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,399
THE FAIR PROCESS WOULD HAVE BEEN

154
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,666
TO FOLLOW THE REGULAR ORDER LIKE

155
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,368
SENATOR FEINSTEIN DID NOT DO

156
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:25,805
MUCH AGO FOR A CONFIDENTIAL

157
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,507
INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD HAVE

158
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,174
PROTECTED DR. FORD, JUDGE

159
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,243
KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION, WE

160
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:32,211
DIDN'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

161
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,213
UNFORTUNATELY EVERY ONE OF THESE

162
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,716
ALLEGATIONS -- EVEN AFTER PEOPLE

163
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,451
SAID, LET'S HAVE THE FBI

164
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,385
INVESTIGATED, EACH NEW

165
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:41,854
ALLEGATION, THEY PUSHED TO THE

166
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:42,255
MEDIA.

167
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:43,156
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU

168
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:49,329
REALLY QUICKLY, YOUR GROUP HAS

169
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:49,929
BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS

170
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:50,563
NOMINATION, AND THERE WERE

171
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:51,231
ARTICLES SUGGESTING THAT YOU

172
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:52,198
WERE BACKING OFF.

173
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:55,201
>> THEY TOOK ONE LINE OUT OF THE

174
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:55,835
INTERVIEW OUT OF CONTEXT.

175
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,470
I SPENT THE WHOLE INTERVIEW

176
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,605
DEFENDING KAVANAUGH.

177
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,806
WE STAND FIRMLY BEHIND JUDGE

178
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:00,607
KAVANAUGH AND ARE LOOKING

179
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:01,374
FORWARD TO THE HEARING AND

180
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:02,809
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE

181
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,243
CONFIRMATION.

182
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:04,511
>> Shannon: WE KNOW YOUR GROUP

183
00:05:04,511 --> 00:00:00,000
HAS SPENT A LOT OF HER AS.
