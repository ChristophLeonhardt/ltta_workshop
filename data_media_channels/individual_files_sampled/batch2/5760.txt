welcome back when it comes to the fourth of July and it's tradition some people like barbecue some people like parades some people like fireworks my tradition an Independence Day I like to talk about political independence the third party kind that is more people call themselves independence these days then Republicans are Democrats it is the fastest-growing non party if you will recent Gallup polling showed 26% of people identified as Republicans 29% as Democrats and 43% as independents what's more American than declaring your independence right well what does that mean practically in our politics even with all those people claiming to identify as independent a collective 94% of voters chose Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election third party candidates like Gary Johnson Jill Stein and Evan McMullen only got about 6% collectively so the two major parties remain dominant despite voters claiming they don't identify with either of them but some independents have managed to win federal elections even if they remain a minority recently I spoke with senator angus King one of only two independent members of Congress began by asking him why he and Bernie Sanders are the only ones who have successfully bucked the official party system and why there aren't more elected independents who choose to caucus with one side or the other this what he told me I think it's the mechanics of our election system Chuck it's it's very hard to get on the ballot in many places and it's the whole system is established under the auspices of the two parties the the other piece though is and I think it goes to my history the hardest thing for an independent is to convince the the voters that you're for real and that it's a viable choice and they're not wasting their vote and in my case we had an independent governor elected in Maine in 1974 20 years before I ran and it made it thinkable if you see what I mean if I'd been running out of the blue as an independent in Pennsylvania or Arizona or someplace I don't think it would work although I think we're getting to the place where if people are willing to make that jump right I think they'll find a fertile ground well you know it's interesting Jesse Ventura back in 1998 when when when it at the time he used this newfangled device called email to to sort of the the problem that he had of getting expensive television ads and all of those things the barrier to entry for candidates now thanks to the Internet and thanks to sort of direct communications is so much lower and it still hasn't gotten contagious so let me ask it this way and I think I've asked you this question before one of the ways I think to increase your power and the power of Independence sort of center left center right type of folks would be if there were six or eight of you in the United States Senate that always said you know what we'll decide which party is responsible enough to be in the majority we want to be the majority maker what would that power look like to you well you know that I've heard that discussed and with particularly with the Senate as carefully balanced as it is now you could have three or four people that could play that role the real question would be how would the parties react if three or four or six of us got together and said okay we're gonna we're gonna work this and and nothing happens unless we're on board one way or the other the question then is what Oh Chuck Schumer and and Mitch McConnell do does Mitch McConnell say okay you want to play that game you're no longer a chair of a committee or you know they're there's all kinds of internal institutional rules and and I think that's the problem but I think those of us that are in the middle and and I certainly consider myself one we can still play an important role without the kind of raw power that you're talking about and that is working back and forth and now quite often people come to me from both sides and say you know help us get to the other side on this and and make a bridge and let's get something done what's the problem with our current polarized political situation one of the things I argue is for instance that we don't have ideological diversity within the two major parties and it sounds like you're arguing is that's what you left I think that's why some on the right may leave soon because of what's happening there that you're not allowed to be you're not allowed to have diverse opinions within that tent is that the prelude is the bigger problem in politics that there's not enough room for more independence or that the two parties ostracize those that that may have an independent streak I think it's a bit of the latter I think I think the problem is the parties are going to their bases and the Republicans are becoming more conservative the Democrats are becoming more liberal and if you're if you're an apostate if you have a view that's at variance with one of the basic tenets of either side you're sort of you know drummed out of the core and I think that's I think that's a real problem with our politics if you look at charts going back to the 70s or 80s about overlap there used to be a huge amount of overlap in the Senate and in the house in the Senate it was probably 20 votes of more conservative Democrats more liberal Republicans now there is literally no overlap and I always describe it as two magnets pushing each other away now I you know if it like you and Manchin and Collins you guys your lines don't cross anymore and it used to cross that's right it and and Chuck here's what I think you're a student of this here's here's the most dangerous development in American politics in my view that we're living through right now it used to be you could win or lose an election on the issues in other words what was your position on abortion or on immigration or on education whatever that's that was what the voters decided on and of course who you were now you can lose an election particularly a primary because you're viewed as someone who's willing to compromise and try to solve problems and there and if you think about that man that's really dangerous if you'll be penalized for being reasonable that's a bad spot I gotta ask you rank-choice voting state of Maine the arguments that my pal over at the fair voting who's a big activist on this guy named rod Ritchie he always says you preach about wanting to have more parties to have have access to more candidates he thinks rank-choice voting which you guys are doing in Maine for second third fourth Instant Runoff voting is actually a way to empower more political parties and more independent candidates do you buy it well I think it may be I don't know about more political parties or independent candidates but it does it leaves voters with more options and they don't have to make an agonizing choice between is this person going to make it and am I wasting my vote the with Frank choice voting which is basically an instant runoff where you if three candidates you vote 1 2 & 3 and the bottom candidate there's their second-place vote get applied until somebody gets a majority I think it's I think you know it's an experiment it's running all over the country in cities that we're the first state to attach you are but I think it's going to be an important reform that will allow a more of a sort of broader participation the other thing Chuck is really interesting about it if you want your opponents second-place votes it tends to make you more civil you don't want to dump on your opponent with negative ads because you want their voters to give you their self in place that's a kind of hidden benefit that we're gonna watch play out over the Nexus everyone one more hidden benefit if we do extrapolate this out to our presidential campaigns and all over the country it will make exit polls useless for calling elections which is a good thing actually used for what they should be done for which is why did people vote the way they voted anyway senator angus King on this independents say thanks for doing this much appreciate it Chuck from somebody who knows happy Independence Day man all
