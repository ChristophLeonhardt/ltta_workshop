TRUMP'S AGENDA, FILED A LAWSUIT

AGAINST TRUMP FOUNDATION.

11
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:29,308
THE SUIT TO SPECIFICALLY NAMES

00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,110
THE PRESIDENT'S CHILDREN ALONG

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,945

ERIC AND IVANKA, ACCUSES THE

AND UNLAWFUL COORDINATION WITH

17
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:41,654
THE TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

18
00:00:41,654 --> 00:00:42,555
NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,292
THAT POSITION AFTER ERIC

SCHNEIDERMAN RESIGNED IN

22
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:48,427
DISGRACE AMID REPORTS THAT HE

23
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,530
HAD ABUSED WOMEN, SAYS THIS.

24
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,765
THE TRUMP FOUNDATION WAS A

25
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,400
LITTLE MORE THAN A CHECKBOOK FOR

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,269
PAYMENTS FOR MR. TRUMP OR HIS

27
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,739
BUSINESSES TO NONPROFITS,

28
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:00,439
REGARDLESS OF THEIR PURPOSE OR

29
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:00,806
LEGALITY.

30
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,409
UNDERWOOD IS SEEKING 2.8 MILLION

31
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,111

32
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,479
AND WANTS THE FOUNDATION

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,146
DISSOLVED.

34
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:08,714
WHICH, BY THE WAY, THE PRESIDENT

35
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:09,982
WANTED TO DO MONTHS AGO WHEN HE

36
00:01:09,982 --> 00:01:11,183
RAN FOR OFFICE BUT THEY SAID

37
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,352
THEY HAD TO KEEP IT OPEN SO THEY

38
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:14,553
COULD KEEP THE INVESTIGATION

39
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:14,854
OPEN.

40
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:16,656
THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYS HE WILL

41
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:21,093
NOT SETTLE THIS CASE.

42
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,095
THIS IS HIS FORMER CAMPAIGN

43
00:01:23,095 --> 00:01:24,497
MANAGER, GOOD TO SEE YOU CORY.

44
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:27,300
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS

45
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,700
SUIT?

46
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,535
>> I THINK THIS IS POLITICS AT

47
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:30,536
ITS VERY WORST.

48
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:31,937
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS, ERIC

49
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:33,105
SCHNEIDERMAN THOUGHT HE WAS

50
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:34,473
GOING TO MAKE HIS POLITICAL

51
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,342
CAREER GOING AFTER DONALD TRUMP

52
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,311
AND HIS FAMILY AT THE FOUNDATION

53
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,178
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ASKING

54
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:40,946
FOR DONATIONS WHEN HE WAS

55
00:01:40,946 --> 00:01:41,547
RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

56
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:43,883
THAT'S A HYPOCRISY OF NEW YORK

57
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:44,250
POLITICS.

58
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,751
NOW YOU LOOK AT THE

59
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,253
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS SAID

60
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:48,921
RECENTLY ABOUT THIS

61
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:49,388
ADMINISTRATION.

62
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:50,289
BATTLING THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE

63
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:52,158
MOST IMPORTANT WORK I HAVE EVER

64
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,959
DONE.

65
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,694
THAT'S WHAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

66
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:55,528
OF NEW YORK HAS SAID.

67
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,496
SO IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT HER

68
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:59,131
ATTACKS ON THE TRUMP FOUNDATION

69
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,534
ARE A POLITICAL VENDETTA, THEN

70
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:01,934
NOTHING IS.

71
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,569
SHE'S ABUSING HER POWER AS

72
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,603
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER A

73
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,039
FOUNDATION THAT HAS DONATED TENS

74
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:07,840
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

75
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,008
CHARITABLE CAUSES, AND

76
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,144
SPECIFICALLY THOSE TO HELP

77
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:12,912
VETERANS.

78
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:13,713
>> Martha: ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN

79
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,514
DIDN'T REALLY USE HIS OFFICE AT

80
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,116
ALL TO INVESTIGATE THE CLINTON

81
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,651
FOUNDATION, HE WAS A SUPPORTER

82
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:20,019
OF HILLARY CLINTON BUT DID NOT

83
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:21,120
CHOOSE TO USE THE OFFICE THE

84
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,954
OFFICES RESOURCES TO LOOK INTO

85
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:25,091
THAT AT ALL.

86
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:26,292
IN TERMS OF THE CAMPAIGN AND

87
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,327
WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSING THE

88
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,329
CAMPAIGN OF, IT DOES POINT TO

89
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,399
YOU DIRECTLY WITH REGARD TO THE

90
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:45,678
IOWA CAUCUSES.

91
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,224
THE EMAIL THAT YOU WROTE TO ALAN

00:02:58,224 --> 00:02:58,958
WEISEL BERG, AND THE SUBJECT IS,

00:02:58,958 --> 00:02:59,492
VETERANS CHARITIES.

94
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:00,226
IT SAYS, IS THERE ANYWAY WE CAN

95
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:00,893
MAKE SOME DISBURSEMENTS THIS

96
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:01,627
WEEK WHILE IN IOWA, SPECIFICALLY

97
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:02,027
ON SATURDAY?

98
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:02,762
THEY ARE CLAIMING THE FOUNDATION

99
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,396
WAS USED TO FOLLOW CASH TO

100
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:04,096
CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER

101
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:04,797
TO, I GUESS, CURRY FAVOR AHEAD

102
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:05,264
OF THE CAUCUSES.

103
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:05,931
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?

104
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:06,699
>> I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYONE

105
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,567
FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

106
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:09,201
OFFICE, AND THEY'VE NEVER

107
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:10,903
CONTACTED ME.

108
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:12,438
IF PEOPLE WERE REALLY CONCERNED

109
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:15,274
ABOUT A FOUNDATION, HILLARY

110
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,475
CLINTON'S FOUNDATION RAISED

111
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:19,078
$500 MILLION FROM COUNTRIES LIKE

112
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:21,380
QATAR AND KUWAIT AND GAVE 15% OF

113
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,582
THEIR MONEY FOR PROGRAMMATIC

114
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,117
REQUESTS.

115
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,218
15% OF THE $500 MILLION THEY

116
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,520
GAVE AWAY.

117
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,756
THE TRUMP FOUNDATION BY CONTRAST

118
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:31,424
RAISED $18.8 MILLION OVER 30

119
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,392
YEARS AND GAVE AWAY

120
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:34,126
19.2 MILLION.

121
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:36,429
THEY GAVE AWAY ACTUALLY MORE

122
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:37,997
MONEY THAN THEY HAD EVER RAISED,

123
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:38,898
THEY HAVE ZERO OVERHEAD.

124
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,699
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE TRUMP

125
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,869
FOUNDATION HAS BEEN GIVEN, THEY

126
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:45,137
GAVE $1,001,000 TO THE

127
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,338
MARINE CORPS AND THE LAW

128
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:47,139
ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION.

129
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,774
THAT IS THE ASSOCIATION THAT IS

130
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,943
TASKED WITH, IF YOU DIE IN THE

131
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:52,545
LINE OF DUTY AS A UNITED STATES

132
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,146
MARINE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT

133
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:56,715
OFFICER, THIS IS A FOUNDATION

134
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:59,685
THAT FUNDS YOUR KIDS'

135
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,085
FOUNDATION.

136
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:02,588
THE GREEN BERET FOUNDATION, MAY

137
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:03,522
BE SALES FOUNDATION.

138
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:05,658
THE PREMIER FOUNDATION, THE 20

139
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:06,592
TO KILL FOUNDATION WHICH IS

140
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:09,128
DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE 22

141
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,129
INDIVIDUALS WHO KILL THEMSELVES

142
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:12,798
EVERY DAY AFTER THEY COME BACK,

143
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:13,232
FROM SUICIDE.

144
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,935
THIS IS WHERE THE TRUMP MONEY

145
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:16,235
WENT.

146
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,903
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS

147
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,538
ANY QUESTION THAT MR. TRUMP AND

148
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,940
HIS COMPANY THAT HE CONTROLLED

149
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,075
PERSONALLY DONATED OVER

150
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,076
$8 MILLION TO THIS FOUNDATION

151
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:26,712
OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS, BECAUSE

152
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:27,313
THAT IS THE CHARITABLE

153
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:28,447
INDIVIDUAL THAT HE IS AND HE

154
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:30,516
SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR THE WORK

155
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:31,417
HE HAS DONE.

156
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,751

00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:34,153
SUGGESTION THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS

158
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:36,355
USING THAT MONEY IN ANY WAY

159
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:39,391

ALL THE MONEY THAT THE TRUMP

00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:50,102
RECOGNIZE FIVE OH 13C CHARITIES

166
00:04:50,102 --> 00:04:52,671
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.

167
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:56,775
NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED US OF

168
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:57,309
DOING OTHERWISE.

169
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:58,777

173
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:04,316
RIGHT?

174
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:06,151
>> YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.

175
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:09,121
THIS IS SOMEONE USING THEIR
