THESE SHOOTINGS ARE NOT RANDOM. 
THEY ARE FUELED BY GANG 
CONFLICTS. 
WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 
WE CONTINUE TO SEND A MESSAGE 
THAT IS OKAY TO COMMIT THESE 
CRIMES. 
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE 
SAME TEAM. 
ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT I 
MENTIONED BEFORE, NEED TO WORK 
TOGETHER AGAINST THE VIOLENCE SO
THE COMMUNITIES CAN REBUILD. 
AND DESPITE WHAT WE SAW THIS 
WEEKEND, I'M STILL PLEASED THAT 
BETWEEN ALL OF THE WORK, WE 
STILL SEE REDUCTIONS IN GUN 
VIOLENCE THIS YEAR. 
BUT WE REALLY HAVE A LOT MORE 
WORK TO DO IT WE NEED EVERYONE, 
EVERYONE TO COME TO THE TABLE. 
I'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 
>> BOTH OF THEM HAD BEEN 
REPORTED MISSING. 
ONE FOR 24 HOURS AND THE OTHER 
FOR ABOUT 48 HOURS. 
ONE HAS NO CRIMINAL HISTORY OR 
ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE'S. 
ONE IS ACTUALLY KNOWN TO CPD. 
>> THEY WERE REPORTED MISSING 
BY THEIR MOTHER'S. 
ONE AFTER 24 HOURS AND THE 
OTHER AFTER 24 -- 48 HOURS. 
THE MOTHER ACTUALLY RECEIVED AN 
ANONYMOUS MESSAGE SAYING THAT 
THIS PARTY BELIEVED THAT SHE 
COULD FIND HER SON IN A WOODED 
AREA OVER AT 1/30 -- 130TH. 
DETECTIVES WENT TO THAT AREA 
AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL 
AND LOCATED BOTH OF THE VICTIMS 
WHO WERE DECEASED. 
>> DETECTIVES FOUND THE BODY. 
WHEN SHE RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE, 
SHE WAS ACTUALLY WITH DETECTIVES
AT THE TIME. 
SHE WAS TALKING TO DETECTIVES. 
WE STARTED A MISSING PERSONS 
INVESTIGATION. 
AND THE DETECTIVES WERE 
FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT LEADS THEY 
COULD. 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY WITH THE 
MOTHER OF ONE OF THESE YOUNG 
MEN WHEN THE MOTHER RECEIVED A 
MESSAGE AND SAID I JUST 
RECEIVED THIS MESSAGE THAT MY 
SON CAN BE FOUND OVER HERE. 
THEY WENT THERE TOGETHER BEGIN 
SEARCHING. 
THE DETECTIVES PHONED THEM. 
YES. 
I'M SORRY? 
THE MOTIVE? 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF DIFFERENT 
ONCE. 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO PERSONS OF 
INTEREST THAT WE ARE TALKING TO 
RIGHT NOW. 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS 
GOING AROUND. 
WE HAVEN'T RULED OUT THE 
POTENTIAL FOR ROBBERY IS ONE OF 
THE MOTIVES. 
-- AS ONE OF THE MOTIVES. 
>> IT IS JUST A MATTER OF BEING 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
YOU KNOW? 
EVERYONE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. 
MYSELF, THE FIRST DEPUTY, THE 
MAYOR AND HIS STAFF, JUDICIAL 
ú 
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE THAT 
DECIDE TO PULL THESE TRIGGERS. 
THEY DON'T GET A PASS FROM US. 
THE SIMPLE FACT OF IT IS, THE 
POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN'T DO IT 
ALONE. 
I KNOW WE HAVE STRAINED 
RELATIONSHIPS IN CERTAIN PARTS 
OF THE CITY. 
I RECOGNIZE THAT. 
I'M A BLACK MAN THAT HAS LIVED 
IN CHICAGO HIS ENTIRE LIFE. 
I KNOW THE TENSION BETWEEN THE 
PLEASE DEPARTMENT AND THE BLACK 
COMMUNITY. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THESE 
INDIVIDUALS JUST FEEL LIKE THEY 
CAN CONTINUE TO DO IT BECAUSE 
THEY AREGETTING AWAY WITH IT. 
IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET 
SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THAT OUT. 
THIS IS SIMPLY PEOPLE THAT 
DECIDE TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES. 
WOULD YOU STOP? 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED TO 
DO? 
IT'S RIDICULOUS. 
PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF 
IT. 
AND THEY SHOULD BE. 
BY SHOULD BE. 
WE JUST HAVE A CULTURE IN 
CHICAGO WHERE INDIVIDUALS -- 
FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TOO MANY 
GUNS IN THE CITY. 
WAY TOO MANY GUNS. 
THAT'S OBVIOUS. 
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ILLEGAL GUN 
PROBLEM IN OTHER CITIES. 
WE KEEP FAILING TO HOLD PEOPLE 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
UNTIL WE DO THAT, WE ARE GOING 
TO CONTINUE SEEING THAT. 
THEY ARE SHOWING US EVERYDAY 
THAT THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO DO 
IT. 
AND WE HAVE TO ASK WHY? 
WHY? 
WHY AREN'T THEY AFRAID? 
THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT JUST 
ISN'T THERE. 
>> LISTEN, CRIME ISN'T JUST úAB 
CRIME IS ABOUT WHAT THE 
CRIMINALS DO. 
LET'S NOT FORGET THE POLICE 
AREN'T THE ONES OUT THERE DOING 
IT. 
WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. 
CAN WE DO BETTER? 
OF COURSE WE CAN. 
BUT IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. 
CRIME IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RESOURCES, 
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, 
HEALTHCARE, ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
PLAY A PART. 
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE LOOK 
AT CRIME EVERY DAY, EVERY HOUR. 
AND WE READJUST, READJUST, 
READJUST. 
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH THE 
POLICE CAN DO. 
WE CANNOT BE ON EVERY STREET 
COMBER, EVERY MOMENT OF EVERY 
DAY. 
WE JUST CANNOT. 
THERE IS NO POLICE DEPARTMENT 
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CAN DO 
THAT. 
IT TAKES ALL OF US. 
THE POLICE, THE OFFICIALS, THE 
CLERGY, THE COMMUNITY. 
AND I HAVE TO GIVE CERTAIN 
PEOPLE ALL THE KUDOS IN THE 
WORLD. 
THEY REALLY ARE STEPPING UP TO 
TRY TO HELP THIS. 
THE FACT IS WE NEED EVERYBODY 
TO DO IT. 
YES. 
WE DID. 
LIKE A SAID, WE DISPERSED QUITE 
A FEW GATHERINGS THAT COULD 
POTENTIALLY TURN VIOLENT. 
YOU KNOW, WE WILL BE KEEP DOING 
THAT. 
WE'LL KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL WE 
SEE THINGS STABILIZE A BIT MORE.
I DON'T THINK THIS COMBINATION 
PLAYS ANY PART OF IT. 
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES, WE HAVE 
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT 
TO CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
AND TERRORIZE THOSE 
COMMUNITIES. 
THAT'S WHAT I THINK. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF 
THE STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH 
THE POLICE AND THAT COMMUNITY 
IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION 
THAT WE NEED. 
LET'S NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT 
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID IN CERTAIN 
INSTANCES TOO. 
MY HEART GOES OUT. 
THAT WAS TRAGIC. 
AND I TELL YOU, ANYTIME YOU 
HAVE A LOSS OF LIFE IN THE CITY,
IT IS DIFFICULT. 
I UNDERSTAND THEIR ENGLISH. 
THAT'S NOT EASY. 
LOSING A LOVED ONE UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES DIFFICULT. 
IT IS. 
AS SOON AS WE CAN PROVIDE THEM 
SOME RELIEF, WE'LL CERTAINLY DO 
THAT. 
BECAUSE JUST TO ASSURE THEM AND 
TO LET THEM KNOW CERTAIN THINGS 
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT 
OCCURRED -- 
THE YOUNG MAN? 
AT SOME POINT. 
NO. 
ANYTIME YOU HAVE A JUVENILE 
INVOLVED IN RELEASING VIDEO, IT 
IS DIFFERENT. 
YOU KNOW, SO WE'LL LOOK AT 
EVERYTHING. 
WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO BUT OF 
COURSE, BEFORE RELEASE -- WE 
RELEASE ANYTHING TO THE PUBLIC, 
I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE THE 
FAMILY TO SEE IT FIRST. 
YES. 
ALL RIGHT. 
THANK YOU, ALL. 
THANK YOU, ALL PITCH -- ALL. 
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 
POLICE SUPERINTENDENT IN 
CHICAGO. 
WE'VE SEEN THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE BEFORE. 61 PEOPLE 
WERE SHOT AND EIGHT OF THEM 
WERE KILLED. 
IT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 
AND WE WERE REPORTING THE 
LARGEST NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS AND 
CLEARLY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
ARE EXASPERATED. 
THEY ARE DESPERATE TO FIND WAYS 
TO SLOW DOWN THIS PACE. 
BUT THE TRUTH IS -- AND ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN, IT IS IN 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE BUT 
IT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THAT. 
IT IS SOCIETAL ISSUES. 
POLICE CANNOT DO THIS ON THEIR 
OWN. 
>> AND THEY ARE FACING 
INCREASING NUMBERS OF 
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INVOLVED. 
AND THAT IS ANOTHER LARGER 
ISSUE. 
WHY PEOPLE JOIN GANGS AND WHAT 
THAT MEANS. 
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT IT SOUNDS 
LIKE IS THAT THEY WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS -- 
WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE TRYING 
TO ACCOMPLISH, UNLESS THERE ARE 
OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN 
HELPING THEM DO SO. 
PEOPLE RANGING FROM THE 
PRESIDENT TO HIS OWN ATTORNEY, 
RUDY GIULIANI HAVE COMMENTED 
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO. 
THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED ANY 
SOLUTIONS. 
THAT'S WHAT THE SUPERINTENDENT 
IS SAYING THEY NEED. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED WE 
JUST POLICE OFFICERS. 
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS AS IF THIS 
VIOLENCE IS -- THEIR OUTMANNED 
AND OUT GUN. 
>> ONE POINT HE BRINGS UP IS 
THAT WE ARE TALKING OUT -- 
ABOUT A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE 
WHO WERE VIOLENT. 
AND THEY ARE THE ONES 
RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE 
MAYHEM BUT ALSO TO REMIND 
EVERYBODY, CHICAGO HAS SOME OF 
THE MOST RESTRICTIVE GUN LAWS 
IN THIS COUNTRY. 
BUT A LOT OF THE SURROUNDING 
AREAS AND STATES DON'T. 
AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM 
TOO. 
THE NUMBER OF GUNS. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING 
TO DEAN REYNOLDS IN CHICAGO. 
AND HE HAS BEEN LISTENING TO 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 
DEAN, AS ANNE-MARIE  POINTED 
OUT, WE HAVE HAD CONFERENCES 
LIKE THIS IN THE PAST. WHAT IS 
YOUR SENSE IF THEY PLAN ON 
DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? 
>> Reporter: SADLY, NOTHING. 
THEY HAVE INTRODUCED 
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN CRIME-
FIGHTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
BUT THE APPEAL ALMOST WEEKLY IS 
FOR COOPERATION FROM THE 
COMMUNITIES WHERE THIS VIOLENCE 
OCCURS AS WELL AS A PLEA FOR 
TOUGHER CONSEQUENCES FOR THE 
PEOPLE FOR DOING THE SHOOTING. 
EDDIE JOHNSON, THE 
SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT HOW THESE ARE THE 
SAME PEOPLE WEEK IN AND WEEK 
OUT WHO DO NOT FEAR THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF SHOOTING PEOPLE.
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN GET 
OFF IF THEY ARE CAUGHT. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL NOT 
BE QUOTE, RATTED OUT BY THEIR 
NEIGHBORS. 
THERE ARE VERY FEW CONSEQUENCES 
AGAINST THEM BECAUSE OF LAWS 
HERE OR JUDICIAL LENIENCY IN 
THE CITY. 
SO WHAT COMES THROUGH WEEK 
AFTER WEEK IS ABUNDANT 
FRUSTRATION BY THE POLICE AND 
BY CITY OFFICIALS. 
>> YES, I REMEMBER THE LAST 
TIME THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS, THE MAYOR WAS THERE AS 
WELL. 
IT ALMOST CAME ACROSS LIKE THEY 
WERE SCOLDING MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH. 
I WONDER HOW THAT IS GOING OVER 
IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE 
AFFLICTED WITH THIS VIOLENCE. 
>> YOU KNOW, THE NEIGHBORHOODS 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE 
USUALLY THE POOREST 
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE IS NOT
A TRIED AND TRUE PATH OUT OF 
POVERTY. AND SO DRUG DEALING 
AND PROSTITUTION ARE WAYS TO 
MAKE A LIVING. YOU KNOW, I HAVE 
BEEN TOLD WHEN I'VE 
INVESTIGATED THESE THINGS, IF 
YOUR GRANDMOTHER DEPENDS ON YOU 
TO PROVIDE THE RENT FOR HER 
APARTMENT, AND YOU ARE GETTING 
THE MONEY FROM DRUG DEALING, 
SHE IS UNLIKELY TO TURN YOU IN 
IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN A 
SHOOTING AGAINST ANOTHER GANG 
MEMBER. 
AND THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
THESE ARE OFTEN GANG MEMBERS 
WHO ARE BLOCK BY BLOCK INVOLVED 
IN TURF WARS. 
YOU CAN GO TWO BLOCKS THIS WAY, 
IT'S ANOTHER GANG. 
TWO BLOCKS THIS WEEK, IT'S A 
DIFFERENT GETTING. 
AND THEY DON'T LIKE ENCROACHMENT
ON THEIR TURF. 
THERE IS A LOT OF DRUG DEALING 
GOING ON. 
THAT'S GETTING TO THE CARTELS 
AND ALL THE STUFF WE HEARD FROM 
THE DEA LAST WEEK. 
SO THIS IS A MULTILAYERED 
PROBLEM ON TOP OF WHICH LIES 
DISTRUST BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY 
AND THE CHICAGO POLICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>> DEAN REYNOLDS REPORTING IN 
CHICAGO. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> LET'S SHOW YOU A LIVE LOOK 
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE IN 
ALEXANDRIA VIRGINIA.

TREE.

THIS. 
>> WHAT?
