A NEW REPORT ON 80% OF THE

6
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:13,958
CORRECTNESS IS A PROBLEM IN OUR

7
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:14,292
COUNTRY.

8
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:15,126
AND IT'S A BELIEF FELT BY

00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:19,597

00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,101
AMERICAN, ALL OF THEM THINK PC

12
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,068
THOUGHT SUCKS.

13
00:00:24,069 --> 00:00:26,304
I CALL THAT UNITY.

14
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,372
TWO THIRDS OF AMERICANS FALL

15
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:29,907
INTO THE EXHAUST MAJORITY WHO

16
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,043
ARE TIRED OF THE POLARIZATION

17
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,212
AND TIPTOEING AROUND THE EASILY

18
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:34,579
OFFENDED.

19
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:34,946
GET THIS.

20
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:36,247
ONLY 8% OF AMERICANS ARE

21
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:40,351
PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS.

22
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:41,753
THE LEFT OF THE LEFT AND THE

23
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,121
ONES WHO PUSH THE PC MEETING ON

24
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:44,322
A PRESENT ARE TELLING US WHAT WE

25
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,123
CAN AND CANNOT SAY.

26
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:47,125
THAT SEEMS LIKE TYRANNY.

27
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:47,725
ANYWAY.

28
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:48,826
PC CULTURE LIMITED SPEECH IN ANY

29
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:55,133
WAY BUT I FOUND BOOKS THAT WERE

30
00:00:55,134 --> 00:00:56,467
SUPPOSED TO BE PUBLISHED THIS

31
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,769

32
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,569
CULTURE THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE

33
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:58,936
PUBLISHED.

34
00:00:58,937 --> 00:00:59,937
HERE ARE A FEW OF THEM.

35
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:00,638
I'M ANGRY ABOUT THIS.

36
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,040
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST BOOKS I

37
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,107
FOUND RIGHT HERE.

38
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:11,015
CALLED BODY SALLY, 1000 AIMS TO

00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:16,154
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

41
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,122
THIS IS THE STUFF WE WILL LOSE.

42
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:19,123
[APPLAUSE]

43
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,225
[LAUGHTER]

44
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,360
YOUR DAD LOOKS LIKE YOUR DAD'S

00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,128
BEST FRIEND.

46
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:25,296
NO, SORRY, YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR

THIS IS THE STUFF WE ARE

53
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:40,678
MISSING.

54
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:43,514
KIDS WHO DO CARTWHEELS ARE

55
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:46,851
STUPID AND HAVE NO FRIENDS.

56
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:47,452
ONE HUNDRED ASKED ABOUT

[LAUGHTER]

60
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:53,624
IT BRINGS IT ALL HOME.

61
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,827
THIS IS INTERESTING.

62
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,528
YOUR BABY IS ACTUALLY REALLY

63
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,030
UGLY.

64
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,798

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,166
STOP BRINGING HIM TO LUNCH,

DEBRA.

67
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:06,104
THIS IS SPECIFIC.

68
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,138
I'M TRYING TO GET MY UNLIMITED

69
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:11,375

AT HOME.

72
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,116
THIS BOOK IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN BY

73
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:20,284
RYAN GOSLING.

74
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:20,752
YEAH, TRUE.

75
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:22,653
I FIND YOU GROSSLY UNATTRACTIVE.

76
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:26,224
A LIST OF 10000 AMERICANS I FIND

77
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:29,927
GROSSLY UNATTRACTIVE.

78
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:33,197
SHALL WE STOP THERE?

79
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:33,564
[LAUGHTER]

80
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,133
LET'S SEE.

81
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:37,201
IF YOU LIVE AT HOME UNTIL YOU

82
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:40,438
ARE 25 YOU'RE NOT A STRUGGLING

83
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,273
MILLENNIAL, YOU ARE JUST A LOSE

84
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:42,573
LOSER.

85
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:45,243
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

86
00:02:45,244 --> 00:02:48,880
I DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING.

87
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,883
ALL RIGHT, KAT, I THINK THIS

88
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,417
STUDY IS MUCH BIGGER THAN PEOPLE

89
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:55,153
THINK BECAUSE POLITICAL

90
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:58,389
CORRECTNESS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

91
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,326
NUMBERS OVER 80% OF EACH

92
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:03,594
ETHNICITY TO TEST PC CULTURE AND

93
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:04,929
THIS COULD BE THE THING THAT YOU

94
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,930
DIVIDE THE COUNTRY AND KILLS

95
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,331
IDENTITY POLITICS.

96
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,933
KAT: I HOPE SO AND I DO FIND

97
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:09,934
THIS ENCOURAGING BUT I DON'T

98
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:10,735
FIND IT TOTALLY ENCOURAGING

99
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:11,969
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

100
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,172
JUST HOW POWERFUL THAT SMALL PC

101
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,973
OBSESSED MOB IS.

102
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,743
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SAY THAT

103
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:19,477
SOMETHING ACCESSED OR SOMETHING

104
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:21,078
IS RACIST AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

105
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,712
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT WANT TO

106
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:24,115
ASSOCIATE WITH THAT EVEN IF IT'S

107
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,616
SOMETHING TOTALLY RIDICULOUS

108
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:27,151
LIKE HOOP EARRINGS BEING

109
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:29,887
CULTURAL OPERATION OR ONE OF THE

110
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:31,022
RIDICULOUS EXAMPLES EVER IN

111
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:31,856
ABOUT A NATIONAL REVIEW IS

112
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:35,493
PEOPLE HERE THAT IN THE MIGHT TO

00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:36,427
SAY OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO STAY

114
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:40,097
AWAY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE

115
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:47,138
CALLED A RACIST OR SEXIST TO

116
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:47,939
HAVE POWER IN THOSE ACCUSATIONS

117
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,173
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN THE

118
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:49,540
MINORITY.

119
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,408
WE NEED TO REMEMBER IF THE

120
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,475
MINORITY AND FIGHT FOR THE

121
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:52,410
ABILITY TO SPEAK LIKE NUMBER OF

122
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,377
PEOPLE AND ACT LIKE NORMAL

123
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,145
PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING

124
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:54,679
THAT IS IMPORTANT.

125
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,413
GREG: SO ATTACK THE MINORITIES

126
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:56,113
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

127
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:59,483
KAT, TERRIBLE.

128
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:00,484
TO HER POINT, SHE IS SPEAKING

129
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:07,325
ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEM WHICH IS

130
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:08,492
THERE'S A TINY MOB THAT SOUNDS

131
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,827
LIKE A LARGE MOB BECAUSE THEY'RE

132
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:10,728
SO LOUD AND THEY COME AFTER

133
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:11,229
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

134
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,463
WITH A GUEST ON YOUR SHOW, AND

135
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:13,931
SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT ARE NOT

136
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:14,298
FORGOTTEN.

137
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,733
SHARE THE RISK.

138
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,001
IF EVERY SINGLE PERSON SHARES

139
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,204
THE RISK, THE LITTLE MOB GOES

140
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:20,503
AWAY.

141
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:24,442
IT'S WHEN WE ALL HIDE BECAUSE WE

142
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,245
GO MAYBE THEY WILL NOT COME FOR

143
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:29,947
ME SO THE CROCODILE WILL EAT YOU

144
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:30,848
LAST THREE AND EVERYONE SAYS

145
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:36,187
THEY'RE GOING AFTER KAT AND IF

146
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:37,388
THEY GO AFTER KAT THEY WILL NOT

147
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,155
GO AFTER ME.

148
00:04:38,156 --> 00:04:39,156
>> THEY GO FOR ONE AND GO FOR

149
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:39,457
MORE.

150
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,691
IF YOU STAND THERE AND THEY WILL

151
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:40,992
STOP.

152
00:04:40,993 --> 00:04:41,959
THIS IS WHAT OUR FRIEND CALLS

153
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,526
THE CHIHUAHUA ATTACK.

154
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:44,428
THEY ARE A LITTLE YOU BEEN DOG

155
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,931
THAT'S MAKING A LOT OF SOUND

156
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,266
THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT THING

157
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,033
TO THE CORNER REALLY EASILY .

158
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:53,704
GREG: IT'S ANOTHER SIZE ON THIS

159
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,005
PANEL.

160
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:56,741
RIDICULOUS.

161
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:57,975
>> I WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU

162
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:01,913
BECAUSE I SAID TO OUR.

163
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:02,280
[LAUGHTER]

164
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,314
GREG: THAT WAS MY NICKNAME IN

165
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,448
HIGH SCHOOL MAINLY BECAUSE I WAS

166
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:05,683
HAIRLESS.

167
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:05,983
TYRUS.

168
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:06,717
TYRUS: THE PEOPLE THAT CONTROL

169
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:07,652
IT IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND

170
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:14,358
PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LARGE VOICE.

171
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:15,326
EXAMPLE, WHEN WE HAD SITUATIONS

172
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:16,494
LIKE AN OPINION, THIS WAS A

173
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,930
SUMMIT ON A TV SHOW AND A

174
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:19,931
CUSTOMER WANTS TO HEAR AND

175
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,532
SOMEONE COMES ON TV IT SAYS I

176
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,667
WAS OFFENDED AND I DON'T THINK

177
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,968
OUR SPONSOR SHOULD AND THE CEOS

178
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,236
WILL BAIL.

179
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:29,073
GREG: HR NINE YEAH, THEY DON'T

180
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:30,041
BECAUSE IT COULD BE A PROBLEM

181
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,376
INSTEAD OF LET'S SEE WHAT

182
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:35,813
HAPPENS AND ONE LEADING HEART

183
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:36,914
CRYBABY ISN'T THAT IMPORTANT BUT

184
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:41,786
THEY GIVE THAT POWER AND THEY

185
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:42,253
DON'T TAKE IT.

186
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,020
WE GIVE IT TO THEM.

187
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:43,854
GREG: IT'S ALL TRUE AND

188
00:05:43,855 --> 00:05:44,221
POSTURING.

189
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,156
JEDEDIAH, THE CORPORATE'S THAT

190
00:05:45,157 --> 00:05:47,224
WILL THROW YOU ASIDE IF THEY

191
00:05:47,225 --> 00:05:51,028
DON'T WANT TO THE PROBLEM OR BAD

192
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:58,002
PR.

193
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:58,669
>> PEOPLE STARTED YEARS AGO

194
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
EMBRACING THE PC CULTURE BECAUSE

195
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,205
WE WANT TO BE POLITE AND NICE TO

196
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,340
KNOW EVERYONE IS UNITED BECAUSE

197
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:03,040
THEY'RE TERRIFIED TO SPEAK.

198
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:03,841
TERRIFIED TO SAY ANYTHING OUT OF

199
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:05,209
FEAR THEY'LL BE LABELED

200
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,411
SOMETHING AND IT'S UNITED PEOPLE

201
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:11,482
IF YOU TWEET SOMETHING 25 YEARS

202
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,917
LATER IT COULD COME BACK IN YOUR

203
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:14,085
OUT OF A CAREER.

204
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,987
GREG: YES, IT'S LIKE HERPES.

205
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:16,921
NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW.

206
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:23,461
[LAUGHTER]

207
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,528
>> DID YOU SEE THIS WEEK THAT

208
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:25,329
THE ABC EXECUTIVES AND OTHER

209
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,564
SAYING THEY MAY HAVE JUMPED THE

210
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:27,531
GUN BY GETTING RID OF ROSANNE

211
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:28,332
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT CONNORS

212
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,967
WILL DO POORLY.

213
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,335
YOU GOT RID OF ROSANNE FROM THE

214
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:35,406

216
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:36,774
THREE.

217
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:38,342
ALL I KNOW IS WE MISSED OUT ON

218
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:38,776
GREAT BOOKS.

219
00:06:38,777 --> 00:00:00,000
BECAUSE OF THIS PC CULTURE.
