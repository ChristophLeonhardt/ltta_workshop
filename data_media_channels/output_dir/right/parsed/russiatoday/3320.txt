a Spanish parliament session has once
again highlighted the divide in the
country over Catalan independence with
Catalonia's former leaders in Belgium
and potentially facing extradition one
catalan MP in madrid flirted with the
idea of the Spanish Prime Minister being
arrested for his actions against the
breakaway region senior minister you
have made your presence into our
nightmare but I assure you that we will
make our ballot boxes your nightmares
Minister you have beaten us with sticks
but we will be you with our boats and I
hope that one day with see mr. ahoy in a
pair of these
