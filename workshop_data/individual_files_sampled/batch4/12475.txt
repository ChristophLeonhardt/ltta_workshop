so here we are yeah I'm the opportunity to sit down with mark chardee he is the producer of the brand new flick Chappaquiddick it is a phenomenal movie I had the opportunity to screen it a little bit early and Mark it's it's it's really a fascinating first of all I have to ask you how did this thing get done in the first place I'm sure you're getting this from everybody on the right how did a movie about Ted Kennedy leaving a woman to drown under water yeah I mean we didn't set out to make a political statement the move came to me from a friend who's a manager representative these two young writers they had heard this word Chappaquiddick and knew nothing about it so they started doing research they got so transfixed that they started to pull all kinds of material the inquest most of it was their research and they just wrote a script they suspect the script wrote it and my friend sat down and we had a lunch together and he said hey I got this script he goes I have no idea how how Hollywood is gonna you know respond to this but he said it's really good so we read it loved it and we acquired it and then set I mean we had no idea if we can make it you know you obviously gotta get a director and a star and cast but everyone responded incredibly well I mean it was just such a kind of page turning thriller that in a history lesson as well it's fascinating did you get any pushback in town on on making it from different actors who turned it down yeah there were a couple actors that really loved the script it just felt like maybe was a little tricky you know politically so we kind of had thought like maybe we get an Australian or a UK director or actor and and you know Jason Clarke he's Australian and you know it's it's it's a brave twist but the role is so good and he's so good in it and if you can execute what was on the page we knew we'd have something and there's so many great actors in the film from kate mara who plays Mary Jo Kopechne Ian and does it with you know just tremendous amount of sympathy cuz you don't really see it as a full-fledged character until you see the film - you have a couple of comics who are playing kind of the sidekicks - Ted Kennedy and it really is an amazing yeah task yeah john curran who directed it you know with the cast he felt like because the movies so serious and you know there's a tragedy involved that he wanted to have I wouldn't say lightness but to the moments when you're in the war room there there there's moments of levity of kind of absurdness and where Ed Helms and and Jim Gaffigan can kind of mind those you get laughs in the movie some are uncomfortable but some are just like absurd and and when you have that timing it helps and those guys were tremendous and Bruce earn isn't in for five seconds and he's just really powerful terrific enough well I think one of the reasons that the movie is gonna not only do well I think that the critics will be okay with it is because you actually stuck really as much as you could to the facts I mean there's no rumor mongering in this at all so as somebody studied this from the time that I was younger as a conservative was the big thing right yeah but there's all the speculation about was Ted Kennedy sleeping with Mary Jo Kopechne II was she pregnant you know all the sort of various things that people speculate because there's so many unanswered questions but the movie really sticks to what you know which i think is one of the strengths of the film yeah that that was the purpose going in you know to not take to go right down the center just tell the facts and you know it's an indictment no no doubt you can't get around that but but I think there's more nuance to the film and and that was the intent and yeah critics are responding and people on both sides of the aisle I mean we did three screenings in Martha's Vineyard that were they were incredible and and people just appreciated that the care we took with it and you know you brought up marriage okay Peck knee you know someone that never had a voice through this through 50 years their family had reached out before we made the movie I had made brief contact and didn't want to be swayed in any way of kind of putting what we had down you know into the film and so when the movie was finished we connected again and we set up a screening for the family and and they were incredibly appreciative it was very difficult to watch obviously but what they loved is that she's portrayed as smart and funny and ambitious and and just you know a real person and not just a picture associated with you know a name Chappaquiddick and then that entire sequence of what happens to her is so heartbreaking and just really infuses the rest of the movie because instead of it just being okay Ted Kennedy's just a lost little lamb you know with his family you realize that a person died and that keeps coming up throughout the rest of the film obviously that's the thing you go back and forth with you know I wouldn't say there's any sympathy for Ted but you you know there's some understanding and an emotion to to all the characters in it it was it and so if you you know again have a little nuance with the film you know it'll keep you going both ways he has a chance to kind of do the right thing and then he doesn't then he does something maybe that he should and then he shouldn't so you kind of go back and forth through the whole movie it really is a tremendous film film is Chappaquiddick and of course we're talking with producer mark tardy and and thank him so much for joining us I mean I'm excited that the movies even out there it's a story that has need to be told for a half a century I mean if this is it he'll just say this on my own behalf if this had happened to a Republican this would have been a movie within 30 seconds of it actually occurring so the fact that it's a calf a century for it to happen about Teddy Kennedy one of the most famous men in the history of American politics is pretty incredible yeah well thank thank you and and you know would love to have all our audience's support it but especially conservatives you know they talk that Hollywood never does these kids and movies and we do and it's it's not a partisan movie at all and I think it's enjoyed by both sides but but certainly conservative audiences should should support this I think it's it's almost a moral obligation for conservative audiences to go see this if they're gonna talk about how much Hollywood is bi is they at least need to go support things that are not biased in favor of the left another good salad takes on the facts like a movie Chappaquiddick thanks so much for stopping by thank everybody go see the film it's terrific appreciate it
