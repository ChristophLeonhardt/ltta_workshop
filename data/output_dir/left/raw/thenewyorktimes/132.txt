1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,910
My name is Debra Granik
and I’m the co-writer

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,880
and director of the
film "Leave No Trace."

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,825
In this scene, Thomasin
McKenzie and Ben Foster,

4
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:11,180
who are playing the
lead characters,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,690
are in their encampment.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,490
And they’ve lived there
trying to be undetected.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,542
And they hear something
which cues them that it’s

8
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,750
little different than normal.

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,458
They’ve heard many
sounds over the years.

10
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,024
This is different.

11
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,945
“It’s not a drill."

12
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:28,050
They run and perform a
hiding procedure that they’ve

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,434
practiced before.

14
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,350
And we were very surprised
that in the Pacific

15
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,730
Northwest, I wondered 
what some techniques were

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,110
for camouflaging.

17
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,110
Turns out sword ferns,
these primordial plants that

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,840
have been with us since,
I guess, dinosaur times,

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,010
you can roll into them.

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,710
And Thom and Ben
practiced how to roll

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,690
into one of these ferns.

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,630
And it’s also known
to soldiers who had

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,080
been in jungle situations.

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,940
And you really can
become undetected.

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,620
And there’s a very
intense system

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,730
about the glint of the eye and
reflective surfaces, anything

27
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,050
of a lighter color.

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,240
So you really can’t
show your eye.

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,420
So spying out becomes
very difficult.

30
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,200
And we had the benefit of
working with real police

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,760
officers from the Portland
PD who told us how

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,950
they would approach the search.

33
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,800
And their K-9 dog was
being heavily controlled,

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,122
and of course we
took measures so

35
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:27,330
that the dog understood it
was doing an exercise, not

36
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,860
a real recon.

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,200
But the fact that the dog
was there and it was barking

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,658
and there was tension, I think
it made the scene very vivid

39
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,110
for the actors.

40
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,780
This scene is shot in a county
park outside of Portland.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,540
We had the great fortune
of having a ranger that

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,960
ran that park allow us
to work with him to film

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
in a relatively
benign way, you know,

44
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,200
and repatriate any
fern that we trampled.

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,140
And everything
you see there is

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,960
what the temperate rain forest
of the Pacific Northwest

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,116
offers.

48
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,968
“Anything on you that’s
going to hurt me?"

49
00:01:57,968 --> 00:01:58,718
“Just the knives."

50
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,940
I think something that became
very heavy as we were filming

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,210
this was there wasn’t a
person standing there —

52
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,979
and we were a
50-person crew all in —

53
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,250
who could witness
the scene and not

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,810
have it curse through
their brain, what

55
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,570
if Will was black?

56
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,430
That this scene would
play out possibly so

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,470
devastatingly differently.

58
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,640
And it was such a hallmark of
our time to watch the scene

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,809
and not have —

60
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:28,100
it’s not a phantom
memory, it’s

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,800
a very contemporary anxiety
about how things are playing

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,890
out with the lives of men
of color and treatment

63
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,010
by police.

64
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,100
So it is not in the text.

65
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,300
But it was in people’s
minds as it was filmed.

66
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,160
And no, that’s not enough.

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,890
The next step is have
it be in the text.

68
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:50,880
“Dad!"

69
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,000
[dog barking]

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:00:00,000
“Dad?"
