PC Party of Ontario leadership hopeful Carolyn Mulrooney recently had her first radio interview on Toronto CFRB let's put it this way I know what a wet noodle looks like now I know what one sounds like to so liberal apologist john muir and carolyn Mulrooney got together on wars morning show the other day I now have some free consulting advice for Miss Mulrooney if you're aspiring to become the leader of the PC party and perhaps premier of the province your campaign will be all the more effective if you're a main in an isolation chamber on some unchartered island never has so much being said that represented so little seldom has a candidate for the leadership of a major political party come across as so vacuous and vapin for starters Moore's first question was this what would qualify you on this six of February to be the Premier of Ontario on the 8th of June and her response I put my name forward last summer to be a candidate in in this election because I really believe in bringing change we need a change of government and so I've been doing that work knocking on doors I've been part of the team I've loved it and every day I meet more people I'm in more people's living rooms talking about the kind of change that we need to see in Ontario and and so I've been doing that work as a member of the party I've been part of the process that that we we've been working towards building a team to make sure that we can get elected and you know I've been working as you say I have I have I've been around politics in my life but I haven't been elected but I've been working for 20 years in lawn and business I started at a charity and I've been doing that while raising a family and I think that that's the kind of experience that people want to see at Queen's Park next question to take Kathleen Wynne's job is daunting to say the least people are going to say where's the skill set and Carolyn's answer well the skill set is the skill set that I bring from my from my experience my private sector experience but you know my tagline is let's get it done I'm a member of a team I really believe in what we're doing and we're all going to do it together but I'm the one who's been on the team since the beginning and so I know I can feel the energy the momentum I've been working with people since in September and I know that we can do it together the follow-up question was Kathleen Wynne is a formidable opponent are you not afraid she could make mincemeat out of you even though she has the losing hand and the answer well I wouldn't have put my name for it if I were afraid I have I have heard that she is a formidable opponent I've seen I've seen her in action but but you know I've also learned from a lot of people in my life I've seen I've seen some people you know make some great decisions there and so I do also have my own political instincts that that I'm gonna be used so that I'll be able to draw upon here and so you know there this is politics it's an it's it's not as straightforward as as it may seem but but as I said I'm part of a team and we've got a great team who are bringing a lot of experience to this and on and on at when folks an interview that would have been twice as good if only were half as long in any event to recap here's what Carolyn Mulrooney brings to the table she's part of a team she's been knocking on doors she's part of a team she really believes in change she's part of a team her tagline is just do it or I'm sorry I mean let's get it done oh and did I mention she's part of a team by the way conspicuous by its absence from the Q&A was the canary in the coal mine question for numerous fiscal conservatives namely what does Caroline Mulrooney's position on the contentious carbon tax well that question was missing because more likely supports a carbon tax and Mulrooney is already on record as saying she will stick with the party's current policy which is Pro carbon tax but only because Ottawa is forcing it down Ontario's throat so make no mistake caroline Mulrooney will never be mistaken for outgoing Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall in fact Carolyn Mulrooney kind of comes across as Patrick Brown's female counterpart that's not a good thing and the more she speaks the more the PC party grassroots supporters feel as if they're watching that old Wendy's commercial starring Clara Peller it certainly is a big gun if it's a very big fun big junkie boom it's a very big fluffy why is the beef for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like what you just saw please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
