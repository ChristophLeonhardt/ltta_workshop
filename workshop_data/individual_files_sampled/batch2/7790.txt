according to a new nerd wallet study America's college students spent almost 800 million per year on bank and credit card fees through college sponsored accounts with partnering financial institutions our daughter in college and when I look at our bank account yeah it's it's pretty sad you know so what does that mean so like if I go to UCLA you see I will have a credit card with UCLA's logo and picture on it and it's the MasterCard or Visa and and then you know I pay a fee an annual fee for having it and charge things and they want me to not pay everything off then that month I could charge me interest right and then when you go to Burger King on campus they charge you a fee for using the card and then when you go you know to the bookstore we charge you half fees like built-in fees and on a lot of the businesses that are there because that's why they're there they're making money off of these college students it's even worse the bank's pay the college's a fee to have preferred access to the students and the bank that gets the preferred access is the one that pays the colleges the most and so given that dynamic you figure they're going to try and make it back by charging fees to the students that the CFPB has actually tried to get at this and restrict it a little bit they made some progress but I'm sure under trumpet we'll get rolled back I looked at your face and I feel the same way like all is lost folks it is it's it's not enough that students have to pay an arm and a leg to just get an education in America I am shocked and horrified when I look at our friends in Europe and what they pay for their colleges in many of the countries they pay nothing for the top colleges like like the Sorbonne and in Paris free st. Andrews in Scotland is free these are top world-class institutions there's controversy because in England Oxford and Cambridge cost nine thousand pounds a year which is fraction of what Americans pay here we pay 55,000 for the top private schools in America and that's not enough they need to make more money by getting money from banks to take you know to funnel these cars to the students that are a bit of a captive audience I mean you know for a big city college like UCLA or USC it's different but for a lot of campuses you know it's not in the middle of nowhere like that's everything happening on campus and they have these little kiosks all over campus during orientation week where they say sign up for this account and you get out of free stuffed animal or sweatshirt whatever it is and you know they start raking the fees that way can you see it in the bookstores because you see the computers that are in there all of the different businesses who are selling out of the bookstores and all of the you know inflated fees that the kids have to pay for you know they say they're giving you a discount but but it's really not it's constant propaganda in a in a kid's face and it's like I'm a little confused so you have to pay a fee to use their card they do pay these when they use like when they go use their credit when they use their credit card at like Burger King as in with the ATM feature where they put in a PIN number there's a fee for that yeah they have these all over the place for that's terrible I mean my understanding that there should be an annual fee maybe that can be waived to it you call it and bother them but you just pay interest on the balance at the end of the month that you don't pay off so if you pay off everything to end of the month you have to pay for anything no there's fees on top of that yeah socks it's terrible so through a 2015 set of guidelines aimed at colleges and universities the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has tried to act as an advocate for students the guidelines were intended to assist schools and selecting partners that provide the best financial packages for their students progress is slow as the CFPB's 2016 student banking report found that many general marketing agreements do not prohibit certain fees account providers may charge students these fees could include overdraft maintenance and ATM fees on out of network devices so III feel like if there was full disclosure yeah it wouldn't be so bad yeah so the colleges should save the students yeah we're promoting these credit cards because those banks don't have paid us but you have the right to promote them on on campus grounds and they should disclose these fees you know very visibly at the very outset but they don't do that they make it sound like it's free access to free money and sure there's blame to be had on the under consumer too but you know it's but there has to be a burden on the financial institutions to also pay by the fair rules and meant to be you know in full disclosure of everything not just in fine print you know because when you well when you go to orientation it's like a festival and they're people they're throwing stuff at these kids you know constantly and it's all about money it's everything about money power familiar everything is about money but the fact thing is they're at an institution to learn but they're not learning the basics about finances and they're going to leave there in debt and so they're constantly you know trying to prepare these kids for life but what they're preparing them for is that they leave they're there they got the student loans now they got these credit cards and most of them graduate already in debt yeah and it puts them on a hamster wheel working in a system that perpetuates itself and cruise all the benefits to a small number of owners so you know you can't help wonder if there's strategy behind it oh of course you know what's really interesting is when I first heard the notion of a prepayment pilk yeah so that's when you have some sort of loan and the the lender gives you a certain amount of time to repay it and pay interest along the way and if you are super responsible and you are paid even faster so you pay less interest while they penalize you for it so they actually want you to be in debt and and there's a penalty for being extra responsible that that freaking yeah I can believe it that there's a prepayment penalty let me strike the hopeful note okay one hopeful note is this entire banking complex is built on getting customers through geographic proximity right but the whole banking system right now is premise on you're going to choose your bank by which branch is nearest to you and all the practices of the banks have developed which really take advantage of customers our premise on the notion that you can't really choose anywhere else because it's the bank that's local to you etc and we're going to put a lot of costs on you to use other banks ATM fees and whatnot the hopeful note is with your smartphone we're entering an era where you can pick any bank on your phone right and so this system that's based on choosing your bank through the geographic proximity it is actually really vulnerable to new very Pro consumer entrance into the industry that you can access just on your smartphone so imagine in yesteryear it mattered hugely which banks you'd see it the college festival right but a college student entering you know first year in September of seventeen might just pick a bank they fund on their smartphones it doesn't have any branch and that's why we're growing so fast as aspiration calm is that were bypassing that whole branch network giving a really pro consumer proposition to people no ATM fees no account fees the only revenue we learn is that which you pass and the reason that it's possible for us to succeed now and frankly probably wouldn't have been 20 years ago is because of the smart phone but the smart phone is democratizing access to new kinds of pro-consumer institutions and frankly undermining some of the basis of these exploitative old-school banks but you're totally right and that model has has been borne out to be successful in other countries already yeah there are many countries where it's all done online yeah all done with their phone they don't don't ever physically go into a bank that's crazy so in the u.s. it's a big it's a big country and it takes a while for these new trends to really take hold but III agree with you I think there's a bright future for your company Thanks and I know like during slavery they used to say if you want to keep a secret from a black person put it in a book because black people couldn't read I feel like that kind of applies to all of us now because we don't read we do read updates we read Facebook posts teach your kids to read fine print because that's where all of the information is that's going to really affect you know affect them and that's one thing I saw my daughter all the time read the fine print don't just read the stuff that's in bold they want you to see that read the fine print so that you know what you're getting yourself into because a lot of these fees are in the fine print they just not they're just not reading it
