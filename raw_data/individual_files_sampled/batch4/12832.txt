Alexandra Ocasio Cortez she's back she's back the gift that keeps on giving Ocasio tweeted out this quote hashtag abolish ice means not having an agency that incarcerates children and sexually assaults women with impunity it does not mean abolish deportation also I have no problem saying white supremacy has no place in this country it's the GOP that struggles to say that GOP founded to free the slaves found in to free the slaves from the Democrats how many just a question for all the Republicans watching how many of you struggle to say that white supremacy is bad any zero zero people say that okay that's what I thought but I would I would like to make this point clear for Ocasio Cortez I know she watches this show I know she do she watches it every day religiously she is caught here because ice just deported an actual Nazi from the country immigration and customs enforcement went in and deported a Nazi war criminal back to Germany so yes like isn't some deportations are good aren't they Oh Cassio and she's saying no abolish ice does not mean abolish deportation so I'm gonna lay this out free ice stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement immigration enforcement means deporting people who have immigrated illegally who are in the country illegally therefore and see if you can stay with me abolishing immigration enforcement means abolishing the mechanism of immigration enforcement which is deportations QED qe that's the that's alright is that fair I don't I feel like I'm a crazy person now because you've got a major store of the Democrat Party saying that that's not what it means that's clearly what it means this is a big loser issue she knows that she's saying these slogans cuz she doesn't know anything because she's not the expert to put it mildly and so they're saying abolish eyes only a quarter of Democrats want to abolish immigration enforcement and the only reason they want to do that is because they don't know they know even less than Ocasio does so she's got to walk this back but let's just be very clear I don't want to let her off the hook abolishing ice means abolishing deportations if you don't want to abolish deportations then you don't want to abolish ice if you do want to abolish ice you want to Abal deportations she should give an answer on this that we should hold her feet to the fire I don't know why she keeps going in public I don't know why she keeps going on television the race is hers just shut up and you'll win the race the more the only risk you have of not winning this race somehow is when you open your mouth but we should get an answer from her on that I hope she keeps opening her mouth because she's just a joy what a delight it's why I wake up in the morning Oh what did what did that little socialist lady say today guru guru
