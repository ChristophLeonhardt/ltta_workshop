Tucker: HAVING CONVINCED POOR JEFF LIKE TO WEEKLONG INVESTIGATION, JUDGE KAVANAUGH SOMEBODY SCRUBBED IT IN AN ELEVATOR WHICH IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS NOW. DEMOCRATS ARE NOT TRYING TO DICTATE THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION AS IF THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF CONGRESS WHICH THINGS TO JEFF FLAKE THEY ARE. IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY, DEMOCRATS HAVE CALLED TO THE BUREAU TO INVESTIGATE ALL THREE A LA ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH INCLUDING JULIE'S FANTASY ABOUT GANG RAPED. AT A BARE MINIMUM ABOUT THEIR ALLEGATIONS, NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE. HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW. PROFESSOR, THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. ARE WE RIGHT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MISLED WHEN DEMOCRATS AND PUBLIC TOLD US ON FRIDAY, THREE DAYS LATER, THAT THEY WANT CHRISTINE FORD'S ALLEGATIONS INVESTIGATED FOR A WEEK AND NOW THE GOALPOSTS ARE SO FAR DOWN THE FIELD WE CAN'T SEE THEM. SHOULD WE POKE WE HAVE BEEN LIED TO? I THINK THE LEAST CONVINCING PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC CASE IS THAT THIS WAS NOT BEING MANIPULATED IN TERMS OF ITS TIMING. I THINK MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE HELD TO THE LAST MINUTES. RIGHT BEFORE THE VOTE. I THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE CRITICISM FOR THAT. ALSO I THINK YOU WANT TO ANTICIPATE THAT ONE WEEK IS NOT GOING TO STRATIFY MANY OF THE CRITICS. THE FACT IS THAT MOST OF THESE STATEMENTS, NOT ALL OF THEM WERE PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE AND SO THE OUTCOME OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE MANY MINDS. WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. IF SENATORS FILL AT THE RECORD IS INSUFFICIENT THEY HAVE A REASON I SUPPOSED TO VOTE ON THAT BASIS. TO KEEP THIS OPEN INDEFINITELY, IT IS GOING TO DO AN INJUSTICE TO THE NOMINEE AND TO THE PROCESS. WE HAVE TO COME TO SOME CONCLUSION. Tucker: JULIE SPUTNIK'S CLAIMS THAT THEY WERE A SERIES OF AT LEAST TEN GANG RAPE'S THAT TOOK PLACE, NOBODY'S EVER HEARD THIS AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN ALLEGED. DO YOU THINK THIS RISES TO THE LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY THAT WOULD SPUR AN FBI INVESTIGATION ALMOST 40 YEARS LATER? SUMS UP THE FBI IS NOT GOING TO INVESTIGATE THAT ALLEGATION. PART OF THE CONCERN FOR MANY PEOPLE IS THAT THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY ALLEGATION WITH NO ONE GOING TO THE POLICE. PREVIOUSLY OR ANY ACCOUNTS BEING PUBLISHED AS TO WHAT OCCURRED. FOR THAT REASON I THINK THE FBI IS FOCUSING ON THE EARLIER TWO ALLEGATIONS. Tucker: DO YOU EXPECT THAT REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO REASSERT CONTROL? Martha: I THINK THEY DO RUN THE SENATE. IF IN ENOUGH TIME, MARK JUDGE HAS BEEN INTERVIEWED AGAIN UNDER OATH. WE ARE DONE. CAN THEY DO THAT? OF COURSE THAT CAN AND IT DOES APPEAR THAT McCONNELL WAS GOING TO PUSH THIS THROUGH. HE SAID THERE'S GOING TO BE A VOTE OF THIS WEEK. THE TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT CURIOUS BECAUSE THE FBI WAS GIVEN A FULL WEEK THAT WOULD END ON FRIDAY PRESUMABLY A LOT OF MATERIAL WOULD BE GIVEN TO THE SENATE ON FRIDAY. IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR HOW THE LOGISTICS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN
