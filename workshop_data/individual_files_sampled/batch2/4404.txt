so we are in the homestretch of primary season and tomorrow voters will be casting ballots in places like Michigan Kansas Missouri and Washington but for some of those voters in Michigan's Kent County it's a Sister Act kind of two candidates twins are running for the same position but for different parties NBC's Morgan Radford traveled out to Kent County to talk to them to talk to the people who support them Morgan it's kind of a wild story what are these women tell you it's interesting Hallie because you know we've seen the political debate heating up this midterm year on the campaign trail at the dinner table even within our own families which is why this one pair of twin sisters who couldn't be more opposite on the political spectrum are showing that there's room for a little love even at the peak of debate with just hours until the election Monica sparks and Jessica Ann Tyson are competing for County Commissioner same position different parties with one big thing they're twins do you think President Trump is doing a good job I do I do I wish I could just cross my eyes on that no for Monica it's a primary race for Kent County's 12th district in Michigan running as a Democrat can I get your vote August 7th but just beside her jessica is running in the 13th district as a Republican Monica was always there for me she was the only one that I had we are the people that call each other every morning you're so used to being on the same team born to a mother who was addicted to heroin the two suffered abuse for years in the foster care system before they were adopted by a loving family at age 8 I remember eating out of trash cans you know trying to find food that's why I know there's issues because I dealt with those I could have been one of those cogs in the wheel so to speak and when I look at the Democratic Party we're trying to address and how did your childhood affect you wanting to become a Republican because I was one of those people I had to go apply for welfare but as soon as I had the opportunity to get a better job to take care of my business and save a couple of pennies on the side I went and turned in that welfare card although they're still split over the biggest issues of the day that they seem we need to have a solution in this hard-fought swing state voters say they're glad to see any bridge over the political divide I think it's wonderful that they can have opinions and still be sisters and still get along as sisters you should have different views and as long as you're educated and you have your own reasonings for why you're a Democrat or why you're a Republican fine they should be able to talk about it talk about it we can't agree to disagree I'm not going to try to convert her and she the Shirelles not gonna convert me okay because no matter what your politics they say the left wing and the right wing are both part of the same bird so Hallie interesting leave voters there said that they feel like the political discourse in Washington was trickling down to those individual voters especially there in the heartland where they're headed to those critical polls in swing states and they said it's time to bring back civility to politics just like these twin sisters having kind of an incredible story Morgan and I love that one of them is in red and one of them's in Wimberley visualize the divider right there Morgan Radford thank you very much thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
