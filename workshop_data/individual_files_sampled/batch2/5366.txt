but to our other top story this morning the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court just hours after he and Christine Blasi Ford will testify in front of the committee about an alleged sexual assault that took place more than 30 years ago chairman chuck Grassley said yesterday that if the committee is ready it may hold a vote on Kavanagh on Friday at 9:30 a.m. Senate Republicans are under pressure from the White House to move Kavanaugh quickly through the final stages of this nomination to the Supreme Court Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned his colleagues publicly and privately that he has plans to hold a floor vote on Kavanagh no matter what happens in the Judiciary Committee and possibly as soon as next week though Cavanaugh's fate is uncertain McConnell says he is confident going into a vote we're gonna be moving forward I'm confident we're gonna win confidence that he will be confirmed in the very near future meanwhile President Trump is speaking out on his Supreme Court nominees second accuser slamming Debra Ramirez his credibility while also congressional Democrats of playing a con game with the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh the second has nothing the second accuse it doesn't even know she thinks maybe put in him maybe not she admits that she was drunk she admits time lapses through a time lapses I think it's horrible what the Democrats have done it's a con game they play their kana they're really kind of honest this they're trying to convince and you know they don't believe they don't believe us themselves okay they know he's a high quality person they don't believe it's just resist and obstruct they're playing a con game and they play it very well it cannot be allowed to happen as it down the Democrats are playing a card game gon a con game they know he's high quality and they wink at each other they're winking they know it's a Kanye and what he said about the accuser is is simply disgusting but Willy I guess we can back up and put that in a box there's so many self-inflicted wounds on the part of the Republicans the vote on Friday calling the I think it's a female prosecutor sex crimes prosecutor who will be possibly doing the questioning tomorrow and assistant I mean some of them are small fails but my god come on get it right well the president remember stayed on message for several days the White House his senior aides Rick Tyler had gotten to the president's that you cannot go after the women you can say what you want that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man that you believe that but you can't go after the woman well he threw that completely out the window yesterday as mica said the Judiciary Committee now has Rachel Mitchell a highly esteemed sex crime prosecutor from Arizona coming in to do some of the questioning of doctor Ford and judge Cavanaugh tomorrow how was the dynamic because of that different today than it was this time yesterday how is what dynamic difference the dynamic that we'll see play out tomorrow with Rachel Mitchell the sex crimes prosecutor being in the room tomorrow it's hard to know look I think this process has just been really a bit I know the Republicans they've got to move on the spoke because they're running out of time but the whole process has lost credibility we're in a really a post truth political world where it doesn't it doesn't seem to matter to one side of the other who's telling the truth we every buddy seems to have already weighed in we haven't heard from any witnesses and so I think it's probably appropriate let's have the vote on Friday morning and let's after this is has happened and we'll see what what comes out of the hearing but it's just remarkable to meet everybody's it has this conclusion on one side of the other because based on whether it helps my team the Republicans are my team the Democrats without hearing from dr. Plaza Ford I me why our wire why are we coming to these conclusions first and not later because this process is not designed to get at the truth and by the way a lot of them on both sides these senators had made up their mind before they even heard from Judge Cavanaugh they knew with how they were going to vote a new wrinkle here a new report overnight details some of what dr. Christine bladesey Ford plans to share when she's expected to testify in tomorrow's reopen Supreme Court confirmation hearing USA Today reports it has obtained sworn declarations of four witnesses three friends and Ford's husband saying her attorneys shared with the Senate Judiciary Committee and seeking to corroborate her claim the judge Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were teenagers a story Kavanagh denies quoting from the report in her declaration Ford's friend Adela gildo Mazon said Ford told her about the alleged assault during a June 2013 meal and contacted for its attorneys on September 16th of this year to tell them Ford had confided in her five years ago in that declaration she writes during our meal Christine was visibly upset so I asked her what was going on Christine told me she had been having a hard day because she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she was much younger she said she'd been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge she told me she'd been trapped in a room with true drunken guys and she'd escaped run away and hid remember that's June 2013 more from the USA Today report on the sworn declarations of four witnesses for dr. Ford Keith Kobler said Ford revealed the alleged assault to him in 2016 when the two parents were watching their children play in a public place and discussing the light sentencing of Stanford University student Brock Turner he says Christine expressed anger at mr. Turner's lenient sentence stating she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who is now a federal judge in Washington DC on June 29th 10 days before Cavanaugh's nomination Kobler said Ford revealed to him in an e-mail that the person who had assaulted her in high school was President Donald Trump's quote favorite for SCOTUS in his response email Kolar right I remember you telling me about him but I don't remember his you were mind telling me so I can read about him ford's emailed response Brett Kavanaugh another declaration from Rebecca white a neighbor of dr. Ford also recalling ford sharing her story with her after white wrote a blog post about sexual assault so mica this is a new USA Today revelation that came in overnight there's been a lot of talk that there hasn't been strong corroboration of dr. Ford's story now you have four different people corroborating no and this is the kind of information that's going to be put on the table I think it's going to be a very difficult day zeyneb for for dr. Ford because she's basically gonna have to put her life out there to talk about something terrible that she truly believes happened to her and absolutely may have happened to her but am i using the my words correctly because in I think I feel like in the media especially we have two camps some who say it has to be believed and that's where you begin and others who just want to report the story to see what's going to happen what do we do with these allegations in the age of me - you have an ongoing series on PBS me - now what now what would this you know what we have become cynical and jaded about such stories and what we really need to exercise all of us right now is respect and compassion for Apple's integrity I think a lot of people don't understand that was something happened to you as a 16 years old does matter you still actually continue to suffer whether it is still traumatized use if you have not had been assaulted think of a car accident that happened to you you still suffering physically actually from it this is psychological impact what we need actually psychological you know I feel like there's so much political discussion the conspiracy theory this and this what we're missing a psychologist you're an experts in the field of why this matters to dr. Ford as an individual why this is impacting her life I believe that if something happened to you as any at any age it does impact your life and why it matters for America to potentially have a Supreme Court judge who has his views about women was a predatory aggressive you and aggressive views about women does matter for the future of our country and our girls and teenagers no matter who you are and so in order to get the truth we need to actually create safe space tomorrow for her to tell the truth this is a traumatized person you cannot just have a Senate Judiciary Committee and just they're just grilling her and all of that we need to have respect for her integrity in order to really get the truth from her and from her and from him I was thinking the entire process needs to be respectful and the politics of this Sam Stein I mean it can the Republicans even help themselves I mean just with small little things that might just make them get through the day without being mocked ridiculed and by the way losing women in the midterms because this is not that difficult you can have respect many Republicans are standing firm in their support of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and some are publicly rejecting the sexual misconduct allegations against him but we see taking place right now is a PR stunt by the Democrats it is character assassination and this is something that is dirty politics at its worst even if it's all true does it disqualify him it certainly means that he did something really bad 36 year ago but there's a disqualify him from the Supreme Court so you think these women are making it up it nobody wants to hear what you think actually because at this point this is an allegation and your answer should be sir this is a really important thing that we need to look at this is a very serious allegation we need to find out the facts it's really easy to say and you can be respectful it's really easy I don't know why they have to smear her I don't know why they have to force a vote on Friday and make it completely look like they don't even care what's going to happen on Thursday and Sam Stein who calls a female sex crimes prosecutor and assistant at this point really I get why you can't talk for yourself Republicans on the Judiciary Committee you can't because you're literally incapable of being respectful or treating women with any sense of wealth that they might actually have qualifications to be as high ranking as you here's Mitch McConnell an assistant really we have hired the female assistant to go on staff and to ask these questions in a respectful and professional way I can't I mean what what's wrong with them I mean I actually think there could be a really good reason Sam Stein politically to have a woman asking the questions it could be a really great way of saying that and he just I don't know what what happened there you can't look at a woman in any other way but a supportive role that is lower there's there's obvious discomfort that Senate Republicans have about this entire process and I think it's been bungled at various points obviously well I don't I guess to me it's very odd that they are rushing it for that precise reason it does come off as deeply insensitive to the story of this woman why not bring in a psychologist as a witness to to further bolster the testimony why not bring in a medical expert in addition to the friends and Mark judge that would actually create a forum that be both helpful for the confirmation process for Becca I would argue but also informational about the issue of sexual assault in the end though the real damage here is not necessarily going to be to Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation proceedings or not what they're essentially doing is there's nothing that's happened this week will encourage future victims of sexual assault from ever coming forward if they're the person they're accusing is a person of privilege or power because what we've witnessed is that institutions partisanship will all be aligned against you Donald Trump is the most powerful man in the world okay for him to take the time to go after an a vicious and nasty way dead Ramirez who is probably in point of intense emotional vulnerability is jarring and it will have ramifications for years to come for people who have been victimized by sexual assault and feel that they need to come forward but look at what happened to her and say I can't do that just say again the woman's name the assistant is Rachel Mitchell she's for 25 years been a sex crimes prosecutor won every award you can win in the state of Arizona but I want to say I want to ask you when you hear Jim Inhofe say this didn't happen definitively he doesn't believe the story put forward by dr. Ford when you hear president Trump going after Debbie Ramirez and then on the other hand when you hear Democrats saying there should be no due process this guy is a bad guy based on circumstantial evidence things we've heard about him he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court what do you hear when you hear all that other than two sides we made up their minds before this process even started I hear sexism being manifested in public really it legitimizes every woman's claim we're saying we're not taking with risk our claims are not taken with the respect and integrity this is the definition of sexism it's being manipulated I'm a huge believer of to process and there needs to be a due process doesn't matter who it is and the same time to dismiss a woman's claim is disrespectful of her entire story it is not easy to talk about such intimate emotional issues it's not easy to talk to your best friend about it it's not easy to talk to your therapist it's not easy to not go in front of politicians or to start with cynical about your own thing we need to start with the basic concept of respect for women just that just not saying that extends to not holding a vote within 18 hours of her testimony I mean to be able to fully process what's gonna happen on Thursday I would imagine people would want to take some time to think about it talk to maybe the friends talk to a psychologist or a medical expert but for them to now schedule a vote at 9:30 a.m. on Friday where they will have basically 12 hours or so dextra process was says isn't it self insulting to dr. Ford yeah David like you I've been sitting here listening to this conversation this morning like you my hear what I have left of it is grain and I'm wondering about your thoughts on the following premise that the institution of the presidency in the United States Senate that everyone's so revered not that long ago is now so badly damaged that one question that might be asked is how long will it take to repair the damage that is being done on a daily basis to both institutions well I might put your finger on on what I think so many of us feel watching everything coming out of Washington Washington is in a partisan war the likes of which I've never seen we've had nasty Supreme Court - confirmation battles but but never won a sharply polarized as as this we've had presidents who attacked the opposite party and never in these in these terms I think one powerful strand of the Cavanaugh story is that real human experience the experience of dr. Ford her memories of it her trauma her having told her husband her therapist her friends about these memories years ago before Brett Cavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was ever even imagined walk thinking about it and dealing with that reality of of trauma I'm also struck mic by the fact that the Republicans know they have to be careful this is a different country in some ways and they know that if they didn't have a respected woman prosecutor asking questions of his eleven men from the Republican Party asking those questions the country would be angry and so I think that that says that however nasty this this spectacle has been this week the country has moved some the claims of the women who were victims in these cases I think are being taken more seriously the problems are more afraid of seeming to roll right over them yeah there's so much going on here a good thing we have a three hour show but before we go Marsha Blackburn we never even talked about a lot yeah Marsha Blackburn a woman calling another woman a liar without knowing the truth I gotta tell you that's gonna that's not gonna play well with the women in Tennessee it may play well with the president who pays off porn stars and Playboy Bunnies and brags about grabbing women by the genitals it's not gonna play well with the women of Tennessee it it was probably a probably a difficult move on her part guess she felt she had to do it I don't know why thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
