for ten years Marvel has built up the suspense for the greatest villain ever every movie merely being a teaser for the great infinity war that would finally pit our favorite and beloved heroes against the Titan Thanos who is he he is a left-wing totality an environmentalist and is also one of the best villains ever in the MCU so why is that well fans like it will critics appreciate it and how evil always starts with an idea in this case the collective over the individual I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood all right so the Avengers infinity war was directed by the Russo brothers and Russo brothers have directed I believe all the best Marvel movies so far in the series including my personal favorite Captain America the Winter Soldier which I think is the best film of the entire MCU so far this movie is going to absolutely destroy the box office and it's gonna have to because it's estimated to be between 300 and 400 million dollars in production and in this movie and then the Avengers 4 it's coming out in a few years it was estimated by the Wall Street Journal to cost a billion dollars to Disney so yeah the real question is was the money well spent well viewers liked it well by viewer review is a four out of five now on the surface this movie has everything that you want it's hilarious there's some great crazy CGI special effects action sequences and big-time stars that you all know and love but the reason why I can't give it five stars is because of the reason I think it's also one of the best movies they have done in a long time it's complex it's complicated a lot of people will too now because there's so much going on and there's a lot of characters thrown together in this one story so how do you get a plot with so many characters who don't even see each other the entire movie and galaxies and planets that never come together how are you able to have a storyline they did this by having the main character not be a hero you've seen but rather a villain you have only heard about as a critic i'ma give this movie a four out of five again honestly this could have been a 5 out of 5 critic film for me because the story is complex and deep but they had to give a ton of fan service to all these different characters and I'm sure there was contractual stuff with different actors so they had to throw a whole lot in this two and a half hour movie but what's so impressive about this movie is standouts now complex's character actually is and who was perfectly realized by Josh Brolin the actor who played him who was phenomenal in the movie but the reason he was a great villain wasn't just the performance was the perfect villain to pit against all our favorite heroes who have been warring between each others in these civil wars because of the different beliefs ideologies and priorities as seen in Captain America Civil War for example Captain America believes everyone should have freedom everyone should be response for themselves and we should all be able to go in and help people when we need to help people Tony Stark is at odds because yes there are still horrible things that happen because bad people are here so we need a governing system to control everything to keep everyone safe that's the civil war in the Infinity war you get to see ideologies realize you never get to see Tony Stark's you know police fully realize or Captain America's you get to see an image of what Thanos's is Thanos knows that the universe does not have infinite resources and that overpopulation is going to destroy all life itself just like it did on this planet so he's going to remove half of life because this way everyone can restart there will be no more poor we're not gonna be running out of resources there'll be enough for everyone we can all live happy and because of this idea this does lead to an act of mercy because everyone now will live a better life and this is because he can preserve an ecosystem in an environment that can support itself he's basically just a totalitarian environmentalist and his dream is to simply wake up knowing that the ecosystem survived now my faith in values is a four out of five now there's a very strong element of fighting for life itself and its values this is embodied by Thor who literally loses everything and constantly puts himself in the face of death itself to protect people that he's never going to see now on the surface this is absolute madness but not when you put into effect what he believes Thor is a God and since the death of his father he now carries the burden of leading them and serving and protecting the people he has to kneel to the ideas of the fathers that came before him as an example and he has something higher than mere fairness like Thanos to fight for in the Bible john 14:6 says jesus answered I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through me also in the Bible Jesus talks about how the world is suffering so how do you deal with a world that still has suffering how do you orient yourself in it I am the way I will lead by example I am the truth the complexities of this world are structured by me and through me I am the life I am purpose and the Eternity of heaven no matter who you are and what card you're dealt Thanos is the realization of worshiping life itself he doesn't worship a higher self he doesn't worship an All Father or listen to an All Father like Thor Thanos worships and lives to fulfill an idea preservation and an idea does not give choice and does not give morality to it it only leads to a conclusion if you only want to preserve the ecosystem and life itself than what Thanos believes makes sense all this actions are justified we see this happening right now with this debate of life what is its value those babies if they're born they're gonna be poor so it's better off that they're aborted in this government-run health care system the cost of your life does not outweigh the cost of our resources so we're gonna unplug you if you truly believe that existence is more important than life that suffering should never be a part of life then the implementation of your ideas will always meet at the same ground that the greatest evil in the universe is also standing on death and tyranny all for the sake of what someone believes is best for the collective I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood if you
