CARAVAN. NOW THE PRESIDENT. WE MAY AS BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW. MIKE BOLTON AS YOU KNOW IS IN RUSSIA, TALKING ABOUT VARIOUS THINGS, INCLUDING THE WHOLE NUCLEAR SITUATION WHERE WE WERE NOT TREATED WELL FOR MANY YEARS. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO. AND I THINK SOMETHING GOOD COULD COME OUT OF THAT I VERY WELL MEET WITH I THINK WE PROBABLY WILL. IT HASN'T BEEN SET UP YET BUT IT PROBABLY WILL BE. IF YOU COULD JUST SETTLE SOME OF THE CONFUSION OVER YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT ABOUT WHAT YOU MEAN YOU ARE A NATIONALIST? I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. OUR COUNTRY HAS TAKEN SECOND FIDDLE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRADE DEALS. I AM KNOCKING OUT SOME OF THE WORSE DEALS I HAVE EVER SEEN. WE GIVE THEM OUR WEALTH AND THEY DON'T TREAT US PROPERLY. WE ARE PROTECTING VERY, VERY RICH COUNTRIES, INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, A COUNTRY THAT HAPPENS TO BE VERY MUCH IN THE NEWS, SAUDI ARABIA. AND MENTALLY WEALTHY. AND WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THEIR MILITARY FOR A FRACTION OF THE COST, NOT FAIR TO US OTHER COUNTRIES ALSO. IMMENSELY WEALTHY. COUNTRIES. AND WE HAVE TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE THE WORLD'S POLICE KEEPER AND NOT GET REIMBURSED. BY THE WAY, WHEN I BRING UP TO THE HEADS OF COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN, PRIME MINISTER ABE, A FRIEND OF MINE, I BRING IT UP, HE LOOKS AT ME. AND HE GOES I UNDERSTAND. THEY UNDERSTAND IT NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED THEM. THEY SAID HAVE YOU EVER ASKED I SAID HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ASKED LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE HELP OUT? NOBODY HAS EVER ASKED. SO, THAT'S A PRETTY UNFAIR THING. I WILL GET BACK TO YOU. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WAIT. I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO YOU. CAN I ASK MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION? NO, NOT NOW. I WILL GET BACK TO YOU I SAID. YOU CAN'T TAKE THE WHOLE THING. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER FINE REPORTERS. GO AHEAD, YES. I'M BEHIND YOU, PLEASE. MR. PRESIDENT, HAVE YOU HEARD BACK OR FIRST OF ALL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE TURKISH PRESIDENT SAID TODAY. WHAT PRESIDENT ERDOGAN SAID? YES, SIR. HE WAS PRETTY ROUGH ON SAUDI ARABIA, I WOULD SAY. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A FULL RECAP AS YOU KNOW I HAVE PEOPLE IN TUCKERY, AND I HAVE PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PLACES. AND THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK AS WE SPEAK, THEY ARE HEADING BACK. I WILL KNOW, I THINK, EVERYTHING IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S A BAD SITUATION. ENED BUT, CERTAINLY PRESIDENT ERDOGAN WAS NOT COMPLIMENTARY OF WHAT HAPPENED. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING THAT HAPPENED. OKAY? YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD. I WAS GOING TO ASK DO YOU BELIEVE HIM, DO YOU BELIEVE THE SAUDI ARABIAEN LEADERSHIP. I WANT TO SEAT FACTS FIRST. SAAB HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT ALLY. ONE OF THE BIGGEST INVESTORS, MAYBE THE BIGGEST INVESTOR IN OUR COUNTRY. THEY ARE DOING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF INVESTMENTS AND, YOU KNOW, SO MANY JOBS. SOME JOBS. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE, IRAN, YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO PEOPLE, VICIOUS, HORRIBLE, AND THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR WHAT HAPPENED WITH SAUDI ARABIA. NO EXCUSE WHATSOEVER. BUT YOU TAKE A LOOK, IT'S A ROUGH PART OF THE WORLD. IT'S A NASTY PLACE. IT'S A NASTY PART OF THE WORLD. BUT, IF WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED, AND IF THE FACTS CHECK OUT, THEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY BAD. TWAMENT, THEY HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD ALLY OF OURS. THEY HAVE BEEN HELPING US A LOT WITH RESPECT TO ISRAEL. THEY HAVE BEEN FUNDING A LOT OF THINGS. I WILL TELL THAT YOU RUSSIA AND CHINA WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT MILITARY ORDER. AND CAN I SAY IT TO MY DEMOCRAT FRIENDS, TOO. THEY WOULD LOVE THIS IS $110 BILLION WORTH OF MILITARY. AND RUSSIA WOULD PICK THAT UP VERY QUICKLY AND CHINA WOULD PICK IT UP VERY QUICKLY AND FRANCE WOULD PICK IT UP VERY QUICKLY. FRANCE MAKES A LOT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. VERY COMPETITIVE MARKET. GREAT JOB. THAT'S WHY I WENT TO SAUDI ARABIA FIRST. I WENT TO SAUDI ARABIA ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WOULD BUY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS, MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF THINGS. AND THE ULTIMATE NUMBER IS AROUND $450 BILLION. 110 FOR MILITARY. 450 BILLION. OVER A MILLION JOBS. SO, WE DO THAT THE, WE ARE JUST HURTING OURSELVES. WE ARE JUST HURTING OURSELVES. I KNOW THAT FROM A CERTAIN STANDPOINT, YOU CAN ALSO SAY, WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT IS A TERRIBLE THING. WE WOULD BE REALLY HURTING OURSELVES. WE WOULD BE HURTING OUR COMPANIES. WE WOULD BE HURTING OUR JOBS. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD COUPLE OF SECONDS. I SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD REPORT VERY SOON. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT BEING A NATIONALIST. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT YOU ARE SENDING CODED LANGUAGES WAGE OR A DOG WHISTLE TO SOME AMERICANS OUT THERE THAT WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN IS THAT YOU ARE A WHITE NATIONALIST. I HAVE NEVER EVEN HEARD THAT I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT. I'M A NATIONALIST. NO, I NEVER HEARD THAT THEORY ABOUT BEING A NATIONALIST. I HAVE HEARD THEM ALL. I'M SOMEBODY THAT LOVES OUR COUNTRY. WHEN I SAY A NATIONALIST. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN GERMANY IS PAYING 1% OF G.D.P. FOR NATO AND WE ARE PAYING 4.3%. I DON'T LIKE THAT. THAT'S NOT FAIR. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE PROTECTING EUROPE AND WE ARE PAYING FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE COST OF NATO. VERY SUBSTANTIAL PORTION. FAR GREATER THAN WHAT IT SHOULD BE. WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THIS COUNTRIES. ON TOP OF THAT I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THEY PUT UP BARRIERS TO OUR FARMERS, WHERE OUR FARMER CANNOT SALE. TRADE BARRIERS, BETTER THAN ANYBODY. TRADE BARRIERS THAT ARE AS SEVERE AS CHINA'S TRADE BARRIERS, WHICH ARE COMING DOWN. THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL VERY BADLY. THEY WILL BE COMING DOWN. BUT I AM VERY PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR COUNTRY TO CONTINUE. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. I'M PROUD. I'M PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. AND I AM A NATIONALIST. IT'S A WORD THAT HASN'T BEEN USED TOO MUCH. PEOPLE USE IT. BUT I'M VERY PROUD. I THINK IT SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK. I'M SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO HELP OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. BUT I ALSO HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR COUNTRY. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DUPED ON MILITARY AND ALSO DUPED ON TRADE. WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AS AN EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR ON TRADE, $151 BILLION ON TOP OF THAT. WE LOST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON PROTECTION SO WE PROTECT AND WE GET KILLED. WE DO THE TRADING AND GET KILLED. CAN'T DO IT. I WANT IT TO BE FAIR. SO I WANT THEM TO OPEN THEIR BORDERS. I WANT THEM TO MAKE IT FAIR FOR. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND PRESCRIPTIONS ON YEAR AND A HALF AGO. MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CAN'T GET INTO EUROPE. EVEN THOUGH IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT THEY HAVE. SO THEY HAVE TO TREAT US ALL I WANT OUR COUNTRY IS TO BE TREATED WELL TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. FOR MANY YEARS, OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALLIES OF OURS. ALL OF US. THEY HAVE NOT TREATED OUR
