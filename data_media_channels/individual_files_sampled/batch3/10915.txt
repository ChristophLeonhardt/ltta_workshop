our top story this hour Saudi Arabia has hosted an Islamic counterterrorism summit which has already been described as a meeting of an Arab NATO it was opened by the Saudi Crown Prince who underlined what he sees the importance of the alliance for the last few years terrorism was at large in all our countries and most of these groups have been working in several countries at a time without there being a strong coordination between Muslim countries but now we have this alliance well the coalition does consist of 41 states and is aimed at uniting them in fighting terrorism in Arab countries however all the members have sunni muslim denominated governments and that's leading to suspicions that it's really an alliance against iran the regional shia muslim leader while this coalition is led by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and he's already made the headlines being described as a revolutionary politician and a new hope for Saudi Arabia he's even leading the race to top Time magazine's Person of the Year x' readers poll were Agastya of now profiles the man behind Saudi Arabia's rapidly shifting sands he is their Herald that the Saudi Arab Spring the leading candidate for the Person of the Year on x magazine's website a new hope for Saudi Arabia the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman he said in many occasions that Saudis should dream big and there is no limits for our ambition the Saudi Crown Prince is one of the very few people who could take on the power of the religious conservatives in Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman the Crown Prince has a plan to transform not just the Saudi economy but the Saudi society of course the media has a history of fawning over incoming Saudi Kings take the New York Times 1953 Saudi Arabia's new king is progressive not as autocratic as his father they were ten years later NYT hails his successor as a social reformist though he did great things lifted a ban on television real liberal revolution 1982 new king new praise from the NYT a leading figure in a progressive modernizing faction he then promptly blew the entire budget on guns and jailed the critics can't please everyone fast forward to 2017 and the New York Times delivers as always Hamad bin Salman is a young leader who is driving religious and economic reform again moderate maybe by Saudi standards King Salman with his young Crown Prince a 30 year old leader pushing against this anti-corruption Drive it did raise some eyebrows because in the same weekend they introduced the anti-corruption committee he came down like a hammer against some prominent businesspeople three weeks ago he arrested 11 Prince's for former ministers and dozens and dozens of other well to dues over corruption or maybe corruption regardless they've now agreed maybe agreed to give up 100 billion of their ill-gotten gains some say he's in a rush to take power from his father others argue Mohammed bin Salman is on a path to reform Saudi Arabia if reform means jailing everyone until they give you a hundred billion dollars this guy's a real liberal champ it won't have won him many friends though in this way embarrassing so many powerful people and his promise of reform won't make the very religious majority happy either he's caught between a bunch of religious zealots and a bunch of humiliated elites but if he treats his countryman like this what hope is there for his neighbors let's not forget this same moderate prince launched an invasion of Yemen which is killed and is killing thousands and thousands of innocents causing untold suffering he's all but lost in Syria pro Saudi jihadists they're outmatched will he go for round two or perhaps she'll target the region's new Hitler as she is called Iran's supreme leader pundits are now claiming that he'll either win everything who failed spectacularly oh he could do what every single previous king did which is not a lot like uncle like father like son well at the same time Saudi Arabia's passed a new counterterrorism law but Human Rights Watch is worried that the laws definition of terrorism is too vague for example for betraying a king or Crown Prince in quote a manner that brings religion or justice into disrepute could land a person in jail for up to ten years Gregory copley from the International Strategic Studies Association says the Saudi royal might not be the reformer he appears to be Mohammed bin Salman is not what you'd call a moderate leader conference Muhammad is not any more or less extreme than his father King Salman is on Yemen and on the issues in Syria and Iraq and so on he knows that he has to move very very quickly if he is to save Saudi Arabia from its impending economic and strategic disaster so he will not be moderate he cannot afford to be moderate the question is will his plan work and will he or will he inspire in fact a degree of backlash which might topple his grasp for the throne itself and will Saudi Arabia survive that
