the Ben Shapiro show no Disneyland for anyone okay this weekend was terrible it was just terrible it was mostly terrible because Hollywood can't get over tough watching Hollywood talk about sexual

me because I grew up in Hollywood and Hollywood is filled with the most self-righteous and yet despicable people that you will ever meet in your life Hollywood is filled with people who engage in sexual harassment and abuse in fact Hollywood as a town was built on sexual harassment and abuse I don't mean that figuratively I mean that the I don't mean that an exaggerated fashion I mean that a huge percentage of Hollywood films a huge percentage of Hollywood starlets got their starts on the Hollywood casting couch virtually every major producer in town at one time or another has thrown his power around as well as his genitals okay the idea that this is not the dominant the predominant mode of how casting is done in Hollywood has been done for decades I think is is a bit of a stretch the fact is Hollywood is pretty degenerate it always has been on these matters and there are a lot of women who are willing to engage with that knowing the risks knowing that they were gonna come here and be sent to the casting couch I've showed you in the past films that make open jokes about this all about Eve there's some open jokes about Marilyn Monroe using the casting couch okay this is not something that is brand new from Hollywood well Hollywood suddenly gets hit for it and suddenly everyone's very surprised and not only that that are their two virtue signal it's just great they're there to come along and signal to you not only that they are wonderful leftist but also that they are just shocked by an appalled by what's happened in Hollywood they're here to joke about all the terrible things they've done as I said at the top of the show it's like watching NFL executives joke about concussions or penn state executives joke about pedophilia you can't do this okay hollywood has an entire event dedicated to patting itself on the back for how much it's standing up to the sexual harassment scandal that's happening in its own industry and to which many of the people who were who are testifying last night or party in the first place and we'll go through all of this but let's start with Seth Meyers his opening monologue so Seth Meyers begins by slapping Holly wouldn't then of course he has his obligatory slams against Trump he's too lazy to actually write any new jokes about trumps instead he just hijacks jokes that were told last year by Hugh Laurie I believe is the Golden Globes about the Hollywood Foreign Press Association here is Seth Meyers again an overrated comedian who who masquerades as a political thinker here he is doing his opening monologue ladies and remaining gentlemen there's a new era underway and I can tell because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood there's all this is lazy there there's nothing there's nothing new here and the idea I look at we're all gonna laugh now about white men being in power all gonna laugh now about men being sexist we're all gonna laugh about how men are on the run in Hollywood except that half this crowd cheered Roman Polanski half this crowd stood up and cheered Woody Allen when he won a white time Achievement Award from the globe in Golden Globe six years ago in 2012 Harvey Weinstein on this stage was feeted as a god by Meryl Streep who last night was talking about me too and time's up and it's not just Seth Meyers how he Debra Messing arrived and decided it was time to slam a channel for the so-called pay gap right the implication being that he doesn't pay its female hosts enough Debra Messing the multi-millionaire who's a terrible actress by the way and blocked me on Twitter not because I just called her a terrible actress but long ago and she blocked me because I guess there an incentive she would cancel her subscription to The New York Times after the New York Times did a profile of me that did not rip me as racist because I'm not Debra Messing decides that now's a good time to virtually signal about the pay gap she wasn't the only one by the way what's the name of the lady um well what's the name of the lady from Friday Night Lights Oh Connie Britton right so Connie Britton shows up last night wearing a shirt that says something like second something like poverty is sexist it said poverty is sexist the shirt cost $380 not a joke $380 and after she spilled champagne on it then it was worth $700 so well done Connie Britton poverty Texas but she's not the only hypocrite here's Debra Messing a very very wealthy woman for being a garbage actress on a show that was really about the gay guy and about the and about the shrill high-pitched woman and not about her at all here is Debra Messing talking about the pay yeah Pat II you know I was so shocked to hear that that he doesn't believe in paying their their female co-host the same as their male co-host I mean I missed cat Sadler and so we stand with her and that's something that can change tomorrow so much heroism so much strength so much Normandy like bravery my god standing on the red carpet wearing a probably a gallon worth probably several thousand dollars talking about the pay gap that obviously is just brutal for women at E whose entire job that consists of standing alongside men and both of whom talk about celebrities all day okay let's be real about this women in the entertainment industry in the talent side of the entertainment industry are not getting destroyed by sexism okay they are in terms of sexual harassment and sexual assault that's a different issue but in terms of the pay gap here the idea that Natalie Portman and Jennifer Lawrence are being destroyed by sexism or that the women II couldn't just go to their bosses and say listen either pay me more or I'll leave but here's the thing about the free market if you are easily replaceable and I'm sorry to tell you this but women at E and men and E are probably pretty replaceable doesn't seem like a particularly tough job then maybe you ought to ask for a raise less often rather than more often I mean if you could start a neat Channel honestly and pay everybody $30,000 a year and be staffed up the wazoo I mean there are people who are beautiful working at coffee bean every single day who would die to work for $35,000 I don't coffee in pays maybe it's more than that but there are people who had died to be working on e and be on TV every day for $35,000 in any case there's never a messin complaining about that mary j blige comes out and she says you know in the new me to moment I will kill you if you touch me but there's something that she doesn't say which kind of bothers me here here's mary j blige oh I've had the fight since I was 5 years old I'm haven't haven't had anybody approached me like that since I've been in the music business but ever since from 5 to 17 I've been going through hell with sexual harassment so you know by the time I got to the music business it was like don't touch me you know I'll kill you ok so first of all that's that's great that she had that attitude it's horrible what happened to her as a child I would like to hear her name the names of the guys who tried to touch her in the music industry right this is the one thing that was so shocking about last night you watch all of this and what you see over and over and over is that nobody's willing to name any names right they're just willing to talk about broad problems broad American sexism bro sexual harassment but no one's willing to name any names which means all these guys get away with it and the half of them are in the room I half of them are in the room natalie portman I thought was the most egregious offender last night just in terms of being obnoxiously smug she got something they're talking about the all-male directors were nominated which which women should have been nominated last year that I mess like patty Jenkins for Wonder Woman who should have been nominated exactly in any case here's Natalie Portman suggesting and whining about all male directors er honored to be here to present the award for Best Director burn Mitch's okay really what in the world like oh my god how did what bravery stunning stunning bravery Natalie Portman worth millions and millions of dollars for being not a very good actress yeah Natalie Portman oh man she struck back against the patriarchy at that time boom roasted Hollywood is so smug and so irritating I mean I'm famous for being smug and they outclassed me by orders of magnitude okay so before I go any further and we'll talk about Oprah because I have many other things you say about Oprah Winfrey and her presidential runs first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at filter by comm so the holidays are over but the winter has just begun according to studies that means that you're going to

story of the evening the big story of the evening was Oprah Winfrey Oh Oprah so stunning so brave such stunning bravery such brave X Thunder angry it's just it's so so much bravery I can't even take it I just can't take it in fact it was so brave that everybody lost their mind NBC tweeted that Oprah would be our future president yes really the network NBC they tweeted nothing but respect for our future president hashtag Golden Globes our capital oh you are amazing just amazing your future president is gonna be a lady who is extraordinarily rich very good at connecting with audiences and who has and who's famous for vacillating in her weight for years and years that's just great I mean honestly we don't get to complain about reality TV stars and self-made billionaires being President of the United States because the President of the United States is those things right and then brags about them on Twitter don't worry we'll get to that in a little bit but she was just so incredible last night she got up there and she finally spoke truth to power sure there are tons of pictures of her kissing Harvey Weinstein sure there's an actress who back in November alleged that she fell into Harvey Weinstein Weinstein's trap because she saw Oprah hanging out with Harvey and figured Harvey must be a good guy sure Oprah Winfrey existed in this town for 30 years making doodles of cash becoming the most powerful woman in media the queen of all media and never had one word to say about sexual harassment assault in Hollywood sure all of that true but the bravery the stunning miss the stunning Miss Mick bravery ah just shocking just stunning Reese Witherspoon tweeted out in the midst of all of this that Oprah Winfrey that she was now going to date time differently she's what she tweeted quote I will now officially divide time like this everything that happened before up her speech everything that will happen after my god it's just like Jesus it'll be Bo and ayo before Oprah and after Oprah just incredible time things have changed things that can't you feel the change in the air can't you feel all the men backing away from the sexual harassment interviews because Oprah Winfrey got up and said some vague words I do I feel like everything changed last night now to be fair Oprah's really good at this right Oprah is actually a very good speaker she's very talented she's quite a good actress she's very good at connecting with audiences we've known all this for years she gets up Chris chalisa at CNN said you could have heard her giving this speech in Iowa you can almost imagine her running for president have we learned nothing people nothing right the entire media that suggests that inexperience is bad that we don't need somebody with no policy that we don't need somebody doesn't know what the hell they're doing it they had a government and they're like you know what we need Oprah yeah solid move okay so she give this speech and everyone is just over the moon about this speech it's just great she gets up there and she finally says enough she Oprah the queen of all media finally says enough is enough now so I think that's anything special no because I was under the impression that we all felt this way right I mean everybody showed up to the Golden Globes last night wearing black there's a class here of Golden Globes and we've had in years it wasn't people dressed like Lady Gaga breaking out of an egg at the Golden Globes red carpet everybody just looked like it was the 1950s and they're wearing black dresses actually everybody kind of look classy maybe they should be the going rule there from now on but you know they but and everybody shows up and they're talking on time's up and me too and everybody's trying to back away slowly from from anyone who is remotely associated from Harvey Weinstein and and Kevin Spacey and and so I'm not sure what was so groundbreaking about all this except that people on Oprah to learn from run for president they're talking about this back in March and I'll go through it in a few minutes whether Oprah could actually win when she runs for president but first I want to go through the speech because it's been treated as just grand and glorious because she finally stood up for all the victimized women throughout history and over time Oprah Winfrey so stunning so brave here we go shoot there a few problems she starts off by talking about how she is exactly the same as Sidney Poitier in 1964 right Sidney pointy had won a Golden Globe I guess in 1964 and and she said she watched it on TV or she wanted out he won an Oscar I guess in 1964 maybe four in the heat of the night in any case she she says this yeah just got clipped one yeah 82 simply received the Cecil B deMille Award right here at the Golden Globes and it is not lost on me that at this moment there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given the same award name them name them seriously name the lives of the little black girls whose lives were changed because they saw Oprah Winfrey win this award not by Oprah Winfrey making three billion dollars over the course of her career not by Oprah Winfrey become the most powerful woman in media over the past 30 years not by Michelle Obama being first lady or Susan Rice being National Security Advisor or Loretta Lynch being Attorney General or kind of Lisa rice being Secretary of State not by any of those things right not not by it not by any of these famous black women being in positions of powers for years not by the fact that the music industry is dominated by powerful black women not by Beyonce not by the fact that the the entertainment industry is dominated by beautiful black women and powerful black women not by the fact that women DOM black women dominate sports not by Venus Williams or Serena Williams not by any of those people it was Oprah winning a Golden Globe last night that changed everything people it changed everything hey let me tell you black girls who are watching TV today they are in exactly the same situation as she was in 1964 watching Sidney Poitier and his white tie and black skin this is her words get up and say what he says at the at the Oscars or at the Golden Globes right then that it's exactly the same issue is 64 2018 exactly the same now I hate this kind of virtue signaling I really do because 2018 to pretend this is exactly the same is not remotely true it's stupid it's overblown and to pretend this some sort of groundbreaking moment is just sheer crap eree it's just nonsense it's just stupidity okay but you didn't stop there right in her in her effort to garner support for her 2020 run then she thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press and I love this this still frame of Barbra Streisand I think is pretty fitting actually so when they just leave that but there is there is Barbra Streisand with I guess who's that is that James Brolin I'm not sure who that guy is maybe not James Brolin no okay in any case here is here's Oprah Winfrey talking about the Hollywood Foreign Press and the power of the press how special the press is they are so special people let Oprah tell you about it I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times yes just yes I mean and the people nodding and the people cheering yes the press oh okay let me explain to you something about the foreign the Hollywood Foreign Press Association the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is 90 international reporters you know they do all they then report on Hollywood is what they do this is what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is you know what might have been a good story about Hollywood you know for like the past 80 years any time in here you know I'm in a good story for them to report on the rampant sexual abuse and harassment that took place in Hollywood for decades by the most powerful men in the business that might have been a good thing did they speak to the power did they uncover the secrets and the lies and the victims and the tyrants did they do that she wants to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press for speaking up for truth good job guys you were just you're just brilliant you're just fantastic wonderful job I am so impressed legitimately the only members of the press who did anything about the about the rampant Hollywood abuse for people like Ronan Farrow right people over at The New Yorker did some great work on this but the Hollywood Foreign Press Association did nothing right I mean the idea that they're being feeded is some some great truth tellers in a world of lies is just ridiculous also I will acknowledge that the entire left focus on the power of the media and the power of the press aside from when they can rip on the Catholic Church like they praise the press for going after the Catholic Church for its sex abuse scandals I don't remember them being quite so over-the-moon about the power and necessary necessary wonder of the press during the Obama administration now we get movies like the post which I gotta say I have no desire to see this movie because the if the if the pray ler is that tenth inchess and obnoxious I cannot imagine that the movie is going to be any better than that I mean it is the most obnoxious trailer in human history Meryl Streep ha ho oh you just watch me as I take on all the brutal men in the government and Tom Hanks rubbing her shoulders while she does so it just looks like a terrible movie I'll have to watch it and tell you how terrible because now I've committed myself in any case that wasn't the end of Oprah Winfrey and her and her glorious grand bravery ridden speech here she talks about speaking your truth my least favorite phrase in all of human history speaking your truth here we go what I know sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have and I was specially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and shoot not a shot of Meryl Streep okay Oprah's great at this and she and I'm sure she's really emotional about this you know I let's put this way because I'm not captain emotion I always get suspicious of emotion on cue but I'm sure she's really emotional about this she had a really rough childhood did Oprah Winfrey I'm sure that her mother endured a lot of stuff all that said that phrase speaking your truth is so obnoxious and then say speak your truth and have a shot of Meryl Streep Meryl Streep like Harvey Weinstein is a god Meryl Streep that's that's how the press treat this okay there's no such thing as your truth I've said this a thousand times there's no such thing as your truth there is the truth and your opinion and when you say speaking your truth that requires evidence okay evidence would be a good thing now I believe women who make these allegations as a general rule I do but I have to weigh the evidence I have to weigh how credible the women are I have to weigh whether there are repeat accusations I have to repeat and I have to review the nature of the man I actually have to look at the evidence on all of these accusations but this phrase speaking your truth needs to die and needs to die slowly and horribly in the torture chamber used in the Princess Bride for Wesley okay it needs to die that phrase speaking your truth is just garbage even people on the left are recognizing that it undermines their arguments to say that okay but that's not the end of Oprah's Oprah's silly okay there's a there's fun again there's a lot in this speech to like there is I mean like sexual harassment bad right I'm on the side of that if I've not been clear about that I've been saying this for months okay in four years and four decades earlier my entire career but I'm gonna get to the what I think was the worst injustice that she did last night Oprah Winfrey in this speech in just a second

those words over and over because that's what the media does I mean if I read you the headlines on Oprah now I'm gonna be forced to read you the headlines on Oprah okay I'm just going like right now in real-time to Google News Oprah knew exactly what she was doing on Sunday night CNN HuffPo Oprah and Stedman hid she's open to presidential run sources Oprah Winfrey actively thinking about running for president right Golden Globes 2018 how Oprah saved the night Oprah 2020 Golden Globes host Seth Meyers jokes it may be in the cards Oprah Winfrey triumphs have blacked raped Golden Globes I mean just Oprah speaks out to young girls and sessile B deMille Award speech just so much heroism so much hair wasn't speaking in a room full of other rich people who all are forced to agree with her by the news cycle about everything because if they don't then we'll all accuse them of sexual abuse or being complicit in it I mean the thing about speaking truth to power is it would be good to do that when there's actual risk involved she was the most powerful person in the media for the last 20 years she did not say a thing about this happening in Hollywood a thing and now she's being used as the point person on this she's the queen of bravery he's like Roger Goodell saying he's taking the lead concussions I keep using that because it's the best example I can think of it's like the president of Penn State saying he's taking the lead on child sexual abuse hey you can't do that it's just ridiculous it's hypocritical and ridiculous and again I agree with everything she's saying I agree but where was she six months ago hey not even that long ago hey here here this is the part that really dragged nipple wall so she actually compares women who are being victimized in Hollywood to a woman who's raped by six men six white men in 1944 black woman raped in Alabama and the guys were not prosecuted for it here is here she is talking about it in 1944 resi Taylor was a young wife and a mother she was just walking home from a church service she'd attended in Abbeville Alabama when she was abducted by six armed white men raped and left blindfolded by the side of the road for too long women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men but their time is up oh so much emotional lecture us Hollywood lecture us on this right lecture us because it's not like you are the scandal why yeah you watch for me Oprah yeah you lecture me I wasn't the one who was wining and dining with you know Harvey Weinstein five seconds ago the hypocrisy of it just drives me up a wall listen I'm glad that Hollywood is finally owning up to the issue so I think there's gonna be any material change in Hollywood by the way no I think there's all gonna die down in six months and things will go back right to what they were before because no one's naming names does Oprah have a rolodex she knows all these guys she had anything to say about any of them a name one how about that and the part of the drives maple wall here is the implication that America in 1944 is the same as America in 2018 with regard to allegations of rape particularly cross cross cross racial rape cave a group of white men raped a black woman not only would be front-page story across the nation the president would sound off every person in America would be calling for those guys to be strung up how do I know because it was a national scandal when Al Sharpton claimed that Tawana Brawley falsely was raped by a bunch of white men it was a national scandal when the Duke Lacrosse guys were falsely accused to have raped crystal Mangum who black stripper in in Duke and when and when a when that actually happens we want those guys do won't wait forever to pretend the society now in society then are in any way similar and she said in and that the me2 movement is what changed that guess what the media movement didn't change that everyone was against rape and everyone is still against rape we were against rape we are against rape we will be against rape for my entire lifetime and this pretend nonsense then 1944 is the same is now or that requires the same kind of bravery no one should compare resi Taylor to Oprah Winfrey okay nobody should be comparing Rosa Parks to Meryl Streep if you argue out of your mind you're out of your mind and pretend to compare America circa an Alabama circa 1944 with America circa 2018 in Hollywood the repository of all the sexual abuse is just vomit Tricia's it's just a bag of vomit hey now there's a lot of talk about Oprah should run for president off the basis of it so I'll just because so because again what courage what unbelievable courage by the way I did note this last night and a bunch of people got mad at me for saying so but you won't how many times do Ron mentioned last night waiting III didn't see a mention once did anybody else I didn't watch the whole program because I'd rather gouge out my eyes with a spork but if you actually were watching this thing was Ron mentioned guy I like when she says we side with women all over the world that would have been a good time to talk about maybe places around the world where women are being routinely victimized not just in the United States and Oprah by the way cares about things happening around the world she founded a school for girls in South Africa right she actually cares about stuff happening outside the United States wouldn't now been a good time in that speech to say not just women here but women in Iran and women in Saudi Arabia and women in Egypt and women in in a right couldn't you have just listed those off in the middle of it but no because Hollywood is is deeply invested in Hollywood itself and they and they have to show that they're leading the fight against themselves which of course is not true at all okay so would Oprah Winfrey win a presidential election number one the person hardest hit last night is Joe Biden because Oprah Winfrey would win the primaries Oprah Winfrey would obviously win the primaries right Joe Biden would get shellacked by Oprah Winfrey not just because Oprah Winfrey is black but because Oprah Winfrey is deeply talented and she spent 30 years building up a stock of goodwill with the American people and particularly with women so let's talk more about the general election because I think that I ran she would almost assuredly win the Democratic primary nomination process could she beat Donald Trump so here's what she's got going forward they're about five arguments in favor and five arguments against first she is the most famous woman in the history of mankind that's not really an exaggeration she's the most famous woman in media she is this is a time when people have access to information about other people and a rate never before known by man she's the most famous person ever right she's so famous that Donald Trump has spent years praising her in April 2012 quote M Oprah will end up doing just fine with her network she knows how to win may 2014 the greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude at Oprah Winfrey right say so he's so so you know she they're a bunch of arguments here uh in favor of Oprah she's uniter not a divider right her whole brand is I bring people together i unite people I make people happy right she is the she's the warm and fuzzy whereas Trump's whole brand is firing people and acting tough so Oprah there would never be a bigger gender gap than Oprah versus Trump right there'd be the gender gap would be enormous would be like ninety ten for women for Oprah and ninety ten for men for Trump it would be an enormous enormous gender gap and then it goes on here I mean I'm gonna continue in just a second talking about what exactly what it what exactly her qualifications problems are her other qualifications here third qualification she has a terrific personal story right so she her personal story is really good I'm like Trump who grew up SuperDuper wealthy and then became SuperDuper more wealthy largely through branding power she was born legitimately dirt poor in Mississippi to a single mom raised in inner-city Milwaukee molested as a child pregnant at 14 she apparently miscarriage she got in a radio at 19 and made herself worth three billion dollars and so her personal story is terrific she definitely checks the left intersectionality boxes so she gets to say woman black over and over and that's what the left will on to the DNC yesterday tweeted out what will qualify women for office what would qualify a woman for what would qualify won't qualify someone for office said we need to elect more and then entitle the whole list Jewish women Asian women black women lesbians and just all transgender women like a whole list and said we need more women so when it comes to the left of view of what qualifies a person for office Oprah's high on the list right black and woman she also has crossover appeal in a way that for example ho for example Hillary Clinton right Hillary was a woman but other women didn't like our Oprah's woman that other women really like a lot she pulls well also by the way in as a March 2017 she had a 49:33 favorable rating honestly I'm shocked at her favorable rating is that low I would think it would be closer in the 50s she led Trump and actually pulled her against Trump and she leads Trump right now 47 40 in the polls which is not a blowout by the way and that's more like Hillary Clinton numbers than anything else so here are the drawbacks here's why Oprah would probably not win if she ran one she's wildly inexperienced now that doesn't hold a lot of stock anymore in the last two presidents have had no experience basically entering high office Donald Trump had legitimately no experience entering high office Oprah has run her own business in the way Trump has gonna be hard for him to say you have no experience when he had no experience she is far left her politics will become an issue here now she wants to run as great uniter I'm the person who everybody agrees is emotionally connected and that doesn't hold once you start running once you start running you become a polarizing political figure pretty quickly and she is pretty far to the left she endorsed Obama in the 2008 primaries it probably helped him win the primaries over Hillary Clinton she traveled to Denmark in 2009 and openly praised socialism she's compared Trayvon Martin to Emmett Till here which is again just insane she's a pro-choice advocate she's made statements in the past like there have been millions of lynchings in the United States which of course isn't true about 4,000 lynchings as far as I'm aware which of course is terrible but then she has suggested a connection between the time of lynchings and and now right well by comparing Emmett Till to Trayvon Martin nobody thinks of Oprah's political but those politics will jump to the floor pretty quickly as soon as she starts running she also is kind of kooky I mean people say the Trump is a conspiracy theorist Oprah's kind of a kook yeah I know everybody wants to bury that but aside from her various weight loss theories she hosted Jenny McCarthy on vaccines numerous times she pushed if you recall the New Age silliness of the secret which was this idea that through the power of positive thinking we could heal yourself and then it became a national scandal when one woman who had cancer said I'm gonna use the power of positive thinking to heal my cancer it did not work it was a failed right she went out and defended the fraudster James Frey as you recall there was major scandal for her she pushed nonsense about the meat industry that had the meat industry actually suing her so you know look Trump is a conspiracy theorist too in a lot of ways but the difference is that Trump is already so filled with mud right he's covered with mud he's a mud monster that throwing more mud on Trump doesn't do have any damage oprah is considered this sort of angelic character and that means that if you throw mud at an angel you're more likely to the spots were more likely to show on the dress right so then there are also scandals that are going to hit her as well so every person has scandals in their past Oprah has some pretty bad ones the worst one was in 2009 her school that she runs in Johannesburg South Africa the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy School for Girls it was hit with the sex scandal a sexual abuse scandal actually two of them in two years so in 2009 there's a series of the students who were sexually abused by other students the year before there's a matron who allegedly sexually abused 15 girls right she actually fought back by firing the headmistress and all the matrons and giving the girls her cell phone number but there will be digging into how much did she know was she fully aware of it at the time right the story sort of went away because she took the right measures but scandals hurt everyone if they hurt Mitt Romney they certainly hurt Oprah Winfrey finally Oprah versus Trump Oprah would end up school alarming Trump a lot and she'd end up doing a lot of what Hillary Clinton did she'd end up standing there going hunting him for his for his baseness and his cruelty it didn't work well for for Hillary now Oprah doing it might be more successful but I'm not sure schoolmarm works against Trump in any case so before everybody gets over the moon about Hillary for president I just I think there's some real holes in that particular theory I also think that the Democrats are probably gonna nominate somebody who's more akin to Joe Biden okay meanwhile putting aside the Golden Globes now let's talk about president

they won't see anywhere else so check that out on our YouTube channel we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so the big controversy over the weekend is that the Michael Wolfe book about Donald Trump was making the rounds the reason I was making the rounds the new case against Trump is not that he's a Russian collude or it said he's a nutjob now let's be frank about this this has been a case against Trump for at least several years and the Donald Trump is not the most mentally stable human and if you follow his twitter feed I'm not gonna lie to you he doesn't look like he is emotionally centered shall we put it that way he's not exactly a practitioner of the art of the Dow he's not somebody who with a Buddhist sense of passivity and Donald Trump is a guy who sounds off a lot and he's very vile at all and everybody knows this and there's a lot of talk in this Michael Wolfe book about how Trump is actually a crazy person right how he's actually mentally unstable well Trump decided to fight back against this in the most stable possible way he went on Twitter and mouthed off about it here's what he said quote now that Russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the American public the Democrats in their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence and he continues along these lines he says actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart the like is actually in they're not making that up it says being comma like comma really smart crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames I went from a very successful businessman to top TV star and then he continues to President of the United States in parentheses on my first try technically not his first try he ran for the Reform Party nomination I believe in 2000 he said I think that would qualify it is not smart but genius and a very stable genius at that okay a few comments on this if you are trying to demonstrate that you are a very stable genius you should not do it like this you should not the funniest thing I saw about this was that somebody tweeted out a picture of mr. Edie with the caption stable genius I like puns salad salad work but here's the problem if you want to show that you're smart and you deserve respect you should not go full fredo in Godfather 2 and demand respect yeah and that's sort of everybody's reaction right Michael's reaction there's pretty much the reaction shot for everybody after Trump tweets all of that now you can talk about whether you think he's stable you can talk about whether you think he's qualified to be president you can talk about all the good things that have happened under under Trump and I agree with all the good things that have happened under Trump I've been if I've not been clear about that I really like the last eight weeks of policy particularly but if you want to show that you are actually a very stable genius do not channel Fredo it's just not a bright thing to do like advice to President Trump please for the love of God put down the phone just put it down you know what would convey that you're to a very stable genius putting down the phone putting it down like now put it down I have to I feel like I'm talking to my year and a half year old son put down the pone where he calls it a pone put down the pone okay just stop when he does this it is not helpful the reason that it's particularly unhelpful is because right now he's trying to fight back all of these allegations and not just that you know there are a lot of people on my side of the aisle on the conservative side will say listen who cares how he acts all that cares is what gets done the reason people are considering Oprah Winfrey for president is because of how she acts not because of what they think she's going to get done if the reality is what we perceive the presidential election to be who we perceive the president to be is what from what Trump evidence is in his tweets not what he does in his policy we can justify his presidency to ourselves by talking about all the things he does in policy and that's great that's how I see the presidency in my dreams right the presidency should be about the policies the promulgate but that's not what exactly people see the presidency has they see the presidency as the stuff you say and Trump is saying silly silly things and not just that he then activates Stephen Miller to go out on CNN now Stephen Miller had some words to say about ski Bannen I agree with all of his words he called Steve Danon grotesque agreed he called Steve Danon ridiculous agreed right and I know Steve Miller I know Steven Miller I think Stephen is a very knowledgeable guy particularly at immigration but on TV he is just television poison he is just bad on TV if you want Stephen Miller to basically go after Steve Annan a statement from Steve Miller a public statement from Stephen Miller released as a video would much better instead he goes had it with Jake Tapper and here's the problem when I agree with what you're saying and I'm still criticizing how you're saying it it might be a problem with how you're saying it so Stephen Miller goes on with tapper and he refuses to answer any simple questions which he could write I could have done a better job ripping on Bandhan in this interview then Miller does Miller goes out there and instead he just devotes 12 minutes to making a fool of himself and it's just not useful it's just not good and then he ends up being success courted from the CNN headquarters by security if you're trying to evidence that you guys are all very stable geniuses know just know here's some of this now I know that Trump tweeted out that he loves this I know the Trump tweeted out that that he thinks that this was just a great performance by Stephen Miller it was not okay here I will show you with respect to the Trump Tower meeting that he's talking about he wasn't even there when and this went down so he's not really a remotely credible source on any of it it reads like an angry vindictive person spouting off to a highly discredit author the book is best understood as a work of very poorly written fiction and I also will say that the author is a garbage author of a garbage book a phenomenon was happening that you didn't see a phenomenon was happening that the rest of the political class didn't see all these so-called political geniuses in Washington whether it be at the big you´d lobbying firms or the only genius in the last week is the president but you big guys happens to be a true statement okay it's self-made billionaire who revolutionized reality TV you just want to say that the book is just a grotesque if you want to just say the book is fiction that's fine but this whole we got to go on TV and we got to treat the president like he's kim jeong-hoon we're gonna go around worshiping we're actually gonna get out a prayer rug and just bow down to trump he is a genius he's the only one who was a genius he beat 17 other candidates bubble come on okay like if you think this is helpful to Trump's prospects in 2020 you got another thing coming okay in a second we are going to get to some things I like and some things that I don't you know let's just do it okay so I'm time for some things I like some things I hate and then we will do some Federalist Papers so things I like over the weekend I got to see Jumanji it is fun okay it's not Citizen Kane it's not meant to be Citizen Kane it is very funny I was actually kind of shocked they didn't use the rock in more comedic ways the people who are actually funny in this in this film are Jack Black and Kevin Hart Jack Black is very funny he basically the basic premise of the film is that there are these four teenagers who entered the game Jumanji if you remember the original Jumanji it was the opposite right it was it was Robin Williams pops out of the game and said all the animals and is freakin out the kids and I remember it was pitched as a kid-friendly film the original Jumanji and I when I saw it and I was like eight it freaked the living crap out of me right it's actual very freaky film this one is obviously pitched to people who are like 16 years old 15 and a episodes it is pg-13 and it should be pg-13 so in any case here is a little bit of preview Spencer that's a new fridge Martha you're all here for a reason you should be thinking about who you are and who you want to pay you'll have plenty of time to figure that out while you're cleaning out the basement are you gonna help are you too pretty I'm too pretty yo what's this a game for those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind Jumanji pick a character and you're that person in the game we're okay I don't think it matters how much you spin ball sounds like it better than I'll be the curvy genius under smolder rave stop guessing Ruby roundhouse and then of course the it's not spoiling anything but the funny thing is the characters they'd have it so the the big black football player ends up being Kevin Hart right tiny and the nerd ends up being being the Dwayne the rock Johnson and then of course the big surprise is that the the hot blonde chick ends up being Jack Black right and so the entire film Jack Black is basically channeling a teenage girl and it's and it is quite funny so the movies really enjoyable I saw with my wife it's it's a good way to lose a couple of hours it is it is it's got its moments it definitely has its moments you know I I feel I always feel this with comedies third where I see a comedy and I feel like it couldn't gotten a little bit more from it but you get enough from it that you're that you're pretty pleased with it so it's pretty it's pretty funny so check it out Jumanji worth seeing Dwayne the rock Johnson only makes films that are that are funny and interesting actually I actually I have to say I've become a big fan of the rock okay I will even watch Central Intelligence and think that's a good movie because I think that Dwayne the rock Johnson is very funny human okay so check that out okay other things that you know what I want to spend some time on the Federalist Papers here so I'm just gonna skip right over things I hate guess what too bad okay so let's talk Federalist Papers the reason I wanna spend some extra time today is because this is one of the more important Federalist Papers every week we do a Federalist paper today we are in Federalist number 10 this is one of the most famous this one is by James Madison this is the one where he talks about how the organization of the Constitution of the United States helps defeat the power of faction so what he says is by affection I understand a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent aggregate interests of the community so what he says basically a faction is any political group of people organizing against another group of people or organizing against a future interest he says there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of fashion and one of faction the one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects there are again two methods of removing the causes of factions the one by destroying the Liberty which is essential to its existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions the same passions and the same interest so here's what he says he says basically if you want to stop factions from tearing a society apart for its top the majority from hurting the minority or the minority from hurting the majority there are only two ways of doing that the one is to get rid of the causes of faction so make everybody think the same way the other is by controlling its effects if you want to get rid of everybody thinking differently the only way to do that is by getting rid of Liberty on the one hand or by giving every citizen the same opinions the same passions the same interest through training he says that the the getting rid of the causes is a fool's errand he says if you destroy Liberty that's worse than the disease he says Liberty is to faction what air is to fire an ailment without which it instantly expires he says that getting rid of Liberty is like getting rid of air because you want to get rid of bad animals you get rid of all animals he says that also having everybody agree is unwise he says as long as the reason of man continues fallible and he has Liberty to exercise at different opinions will be formed and as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self-love his opinion and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on one another and the former will be obvious to which the latter will attach themselves in other words what he's saying is even if you could try to reason everybody to the proper solutions people are actually not driven by reason they're driven by passion and then they make excuses for the passions that they seek in politics he also points out faction is not gonna be cured basically without fascism he actually dramatically foresees Marx he says that there will always be material inequality in a free society because people have different abilities he said the diversity and the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate is not less and insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests he says we're always going to fall into mutual animosities based on our varying viewpoints and different abilities and he says the legislation means that we're judges in our own case rights if you were going to judge between the rich and the poor you really can't have them just vote on it because now you're a judge in your own case so what do we have to do that leaves us with the second solution and that is we have to control its effect so if we have a minority seeking to impose on the majority we don't have a problem right because minority can't impose on the majority but what if a majority wants to impose him on a minority then we have a serious problem and he says no informal checks and balances will suffice he says either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression so he what he says is if you have a big republic with lots of varying interest it's hard to actually motivate a majority to curb the rights of others he says pure democracy is gonna fail because in a pure democracy you can just have the majority all over the place vote from one policy but a republic is better right and then he differentiates between a democracy and a republic this is very very important the reason it's important is because you'll hear people say stupid things like America is a democracy America is not a democracy it's a republic or there's no difference between American democracy and an American Republic there are two major differences in Madison's spells them out clearly says first the delegation of the government in the latter in the Republic to a small number of citizens elected by the rest secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended so you can have a bigger Republic than you can have a democracy very hard to have a democracy of 300 million he's having 300 million people vote on any topic is gonna fail it's hard to even get people to vote for local dog catcher so what he says as far as the number of legislators first you can't have too many and you can't have too few if you have too few it begins to become in Oleg Archy and if you have too many it's hard to get anything done and then he says also a large Republic means that it will be difficult to coordinate interests in a small Republic you could have a majority that elects a couple of politicians and they become dictators but in a large majority in a large Republic it's hard to get all of the interests to coordinate its is the smaller the Society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it the fewer of the distinct parties and interests the more frequently will majority be found of the same party and the smaller the number a number of individuals composing that majority the smaller the compass within which they are placed so it's easy to become oppressive right instead he says we need localism on most levels but broader republicanism for the big stuff he says the influence of factious leaders make hens will flame within particular states but will be unable to spread a general complicated conflagration through the through the other states a religious sect made to generate into a political faction in part of the Confederacy but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the National councils against any danger from that source you won't have Catholic rule or Mormon rule or Jewish rule or Protestant rule in the United States because there's too much diversity he says any bad policy should basically be canceled out any oppressive policy should be canceled out now this was largely true in the United States except for the massive injustice of slavery in which federalism prevented the imposition of a better policy on the states right it was a a two-edged sword if there was bad policy in the States the federal government didn't really have the capacity to stop it but if there was bad policy in the States some other ways then the federal government also didn't become that policy right the federal government was never dominated by slaveholders it was dominated by people who were in favor of the states having their own policy on it which is not quite the same thing in fact it is but in practice but in in theory it is not in any case the whole point here is that the diversity of viewpoints makes for a large republic a more Liberty oriented system right you are you're not getting rid of faction per se so when people lament faction itself that's silly you can't get rid of faction but you can control its effects that's what Federalist number 10 is about and Madison very clearly lays out why okay so we will be back we will be back here at tomorrow with all of the latest news and we look forward to seeing of that i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro
