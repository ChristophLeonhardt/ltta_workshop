00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:11,554
>> Greg: DURING A COMMENCEMENT

2
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,322
SPEECH IN TEXAS SATURDAY, FORMER

3
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:13,923
NEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL

4
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:16,760
BLOOMBERG SAID AMERICA IS FACING

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,494
AN EPIDEMIC OF DISHONESTY THAT

6
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:19,095
IS WORSE THAN TERROR.

7
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:22,165
>> THE GREATEST THAT TO AMERICAN

8
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:22,866
DEMOCRACY ISN'T COMMUNISM OR

9
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:26,269
JIHAD IS HIM OR ANY OTHER

10
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:27,470
POWER.

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,239
IT'S OUR OWN WILLINGNESS TO

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,840
TOLERATE DISHONESTY IN SERVICE

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,009
OF PARTY AND IN PURSUIT OF POWER

14
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:33,576
OF PARTY AND IN PURSUIT OF POWE

15
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:33,877
POWER.

16
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:38,982
>> Greg: MY MIC FELL OFF.

17
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:39,816
BLOOMBERG THINKS WORDS FROM

18
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,418
TRUMP ARE DEADLIER THAN DEEDS

19
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:42,986
FROM A TERRORIST WHICH LEADS ONE

20
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,988
TO ASK WHEN BLOOMBERG WAS MAYOR

21
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:45,755
OF NEW YORK CITY, WHAT DO YOU

22
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,559
THINK IS NUMBER ONE CONCERN WAS?

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,094
DO YOU THINK HE WOKE UP EVERY

24
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,195
MORNING AND THOUGHT I HOPE

25
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:54,164
SOMEONE IS NOT LYING ON THEIR

26
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:54,798
TAX RETURNS?

27
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:56,766
INSTEAD HE WAS FOCUSED ON

28
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:57,567
TERRORISM.

29
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,568
NUMBER ONE THREAT TO

30
00:00:58,568 --> 00:00:59,369
NEW YORK CITY AND AMERICA WAS

31
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:01,571
AND STILL IS TERRORISM.

32
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,972
NOT WHETHER TRUMP EXAGGERATES

33
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,974
ABOUT MEXICO PAYING FOR THE

34
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:05,375
WALL.

35
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,644
FOR BLOOMBERG TO EXPRESS HIS OWN

36
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,212
GRAPES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR

37
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:11,181
SMOKING OR GUN CONTROL, FIRST HE

38
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:13,416
HAD TO KEEP THE CITY SAFE SO HE

39
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,952
COULD HAVE THE LUXURY OF GRIPING

40
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:16,653
COULD HAVE THE LUXURY OF GRIPIN

41
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:16,986
GRIPING.

42
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:20,957
NOW IN A SPEECH WHEN HE REORDERS

43
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,158
OUR CONCERNS JUST TO JAB

44
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:23,193
DONALD TRUMP COME HE IS

45
00:01:23,193 --> 00:01:24,394
COMMITTING THE VERY SIN.

46
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:25,028
HE IS FALSIFYING FACTS.

47
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:29,566
THE ONLY 11 CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT

48
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:31,401
PARTISANSHIP BEING WORSE THAN

49
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,269
COMMUNISM IS TO DIMINISH THE

50
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,605
PILES OF BODIES CAUSED BY BOTH.

51
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:37,207
ALL OF THIS COULD BE DUE TO ONE

52
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:37,507
TRUTH.

53
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:42,779
RIGHT NOW TRUMP MAY MAKE HISTORY

54
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:44,214
WITH THE KOREAS AND BLOOMIE IS

55
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,748
WHINING ABOUT FAKE NEWS AT A

56
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,183
COLLEGE.

57
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:47,984
THAT'S GOT TO HURT.

58
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,953
JESSE, DO YOU THINK THIS WAS

59
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:50,987
SOME KIND OF HYPERBOLE YOU DO IN

60
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,188
A SPEECH?

61
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,990
HE CAN'T REALLY MEAN THAT THIS

62
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,760
IS WORSE THAN TERROR OR

63
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,127
COMMUNISM.

64
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,429
>> Jesse: NOW, A LIE DIDN'T

65
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,764
FLY INTO A BUILDING AND KILLED

66
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:02,532
3,000 PEOPLE.

67
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,534
I AM AVAILABLE TO DO

68
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,337
COMMENCEMENT IF ANYONE IS

69
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:07,737
INTERESTED.

70
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:10,306
I WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THE CASTLE.

71
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:13,409
>> Greg: IT WAS A NICE OUTFIT.

72
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,879
THEY LOOK AT WAITERS IN MEDIEVAL

73
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,284
RESTAURANTS.

74
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:21,918
>> Jesse: MEDIEVAL TIMES.

75
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:22,619
HAVE YOU BEEN THERE RECENTLY?

76
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:23,353
>> Greg: I.E. THERE EVERY

77
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:23,887
NIGHT.

78
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:25,288
>> Jesse: HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN

79
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,756
A POLITICIAN IS LYING?

80
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,157
HIS LIPS ARE MOVING.

81
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,359
EVERY POLITICIAN LIES.

82
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,727
I WOULD RATHER HAVE A POLITICIAN

83
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:36,332
LIE ABOUT SEX OR CROWD SIZE AND

84
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:37,967
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP

85
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:38,668
YOUR HEALTH CARE OR TERRORISM

86
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:39,168
FACTS.

87
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,670
THERE IS WHITE LIES AND THEN

88
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,771
THERE'S WHOPPERS.

89
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:43,940
THIS WAS CLEARLY A SHOT AT TRUMP

90
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,474
THIS WAS CLEARLY A SHOT AT TRUM

91
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:44,774
TRUMP.

92
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,576
I THINK THE FAKE NEWS PUTS OUT

93
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,077
MAY BE THE SAME AMOUNT OF JOKES

94
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:51,014
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES, IF NOT

95
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:51,781
MORE.

96
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,249
I HAVE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA WORDS

97
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:54,617
HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO RECITE

98
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:54,918
THEM.

99
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:57,287
THAT'S FINE.

100
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,956
AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T THINK

101
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:00,423
TRUMP IS A LIAR.

102
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:04,360
I THINK HE HAS A POSTER.

103
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,262
CLEANS REAL ESTATE TYCOON.

104
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,363
BIGGEST, BEST, MOST EXPENSIVE.

105
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:09,165
A LOT OF PEOPLE CONSIDER THOSE

106
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:09,866
OPINIONS LIES.

107
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,267
THEY WILL FACT-CHECK HIS

108
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:11,968
OPINIONS.

109
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:13,169
HE WILL SAY I'M THE BEST LOOKING

110
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,405
PRESIDENT THERE EVER IS AND THEN

111
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:15,972
THE PINOCCHIO PEOPLE

112
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:16,406
FACT-CHECKING.

113
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:20,109
>> Greg: IT'S LIKE A CAR

114
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:22,011
SALESMAN SANG A LITTLE OLD LADY

115
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:25,582
JUST DROVE THIS CAR TO CHURCH ON

116
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,550
SUNDAYS AND EVERYONE IS WINKING.

117
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,185
SHOULD BLOOMBERG APOLOGIZED TO

118
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:30,653
AMERICA FOR WHAT HE JUST DID?

119
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:31,888
>> Juan: I DON'T KNOW WHERE

120
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:34,023
YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE

121
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:34,390
APOLOGIES.

122
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,459
I >> Greg: EVERY SINGLE

123
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,194
AMERICAN.

124
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:38,828
>> Juan: TRUMP.

125
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,398
TRUMP SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

126
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:43,600
YOU SAID THIS IS SHOCKING.

127
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,368
YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED HOW MANY

128
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,570
PEOPLE IN THE INTELLIGENCE

129
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,771
COMMUNITY.

130
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,773
I THINK BACK TO LEON PANETTA AND

131
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:51,207
JOHN BRENNAN.

132
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,509
PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS THE BIGGEST

133
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,979
THREAT TO US AS A NATION, THIS

134
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:57,480
KIND OF DIVIDE BECAUSE IT'S JUST

135
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,382
WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT.

136
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,583
WE CAN'T DECIDE ANYTHING.

137
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,018
EVERYTHING IS A HUGE ARGUMENT.

138
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,620
LAST WEEK I WROTE A COLUMN AND

139
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,554
SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WENT

140
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:06,289
ON IN TERMS OF THE DECISION TO

141
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,391
PULL THE UNITED STATES AWAY FROM

142
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:13,129
THE IRAN DEAL, THE PRESIDENT

143
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,130
WITH HIS BOASTFULNESS, I THINK

144
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,200
IT'S PERSUASIVE TO A LOT OF

145
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,567
PEOPLE.

146
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,569
THE IRAN DEAL HAS BEEN VIOLATED.

147
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,571
IT WAS A WEAK, TERRIBLE DEAL.

148
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,207
YET THE FACT IS THE DEAL WAS

149
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,175
NEVER VIOLATED BUT THE FACT IS

150
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:27,644
PEOPLE SAY THIS WAS KEEPING IRAN

151
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:28,378
FROM HAVING NUKES.

152
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,413
NOW SUDDENLY THEY SAY WELL MAYBE

153
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:31,648
IT WAS A BAD DEAL.

154
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,416
MAYBE IT'S A PARTISAN FIGHT.

155
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,452
MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE

156
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:36,853
JOHN KERRY.

157
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,955
WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE TRUTH.

158
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,890
WE CAN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING DONE.

159
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,760
>> Greg: NOW THAT JUAN HAS

160
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,994
DEFLECTED, KIMBERLY HOW ABOUT A

161
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:48,564
TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC?

162
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:50,199
BLOOMBERG IS MAD HE DIDN'T RUN

163
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:50,800
FOR PRESIDENT.

164
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,802
>> Kimberly: HE IS MAD THAT

165
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,170
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HONORED HIS

166
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,138
CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND CHECKING

167
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:55,772
OFF WINDS.

168
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:57,407
ANYONE WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY

169
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,741
SHOULD BE HAPPY WE ARE MOVING

170
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,609
TOWARDS THESE.

171
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:00,610
THAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING

172
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,177
BETTER.

173
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,779
EVERYONE SHOULD BE HAPPY THERE'S

174
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,814
MORE JOBS IN AMERICA AND THAT

175
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:05,648
MINORITIES ARE FEELING BETTER

176
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:07,617
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS

177
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,217
COUNTRY.

178
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,252
SO MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND AS

179
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:10,720
IT RELATES TO NATIONAL SECURITY

180
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,790
AND FOREIGN POLICY, HE HAS

181
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,124
COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY CHANGE

182
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:15,525
THE DYNAMIC.

183
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,429
THIS IS A NEW STYLE OF POLITICS

184
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:20,797
AND ENGAGING TO CREATE EFFECTIVE

185
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:21,130
RESULTS.

186
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,531
WHY NOT?

187
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,632
IF YOU KEEP DOING THE SAME THING

188
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:24,033
AND YOU END UP WITH THE END

189
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,601
RESULT, WHY NOT TRY A DIFFERENT

190
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:27,970
WAY OR A DIFFERENT PATH?

191
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,871
ALSO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS USING

192
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,641
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWITTER TO BE

193
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:33,576
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SO THERE IS

194
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:34,510
TRANSPARENCY THERE VERSUS

195
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,411
SOMEONE REGURGITATING, GOING

196
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,412
THROUGH IT AND PUTTING SOMETHING

197
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:36,679
OUT.

198
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,481
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DOWNSIDE

199
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:41,117
TO THAT BECAUSE EVERY PERSON CAN

200
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:43,586
DETERMINE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT

201
00:05:43,586 --> 00:05:44,387
VERSUS SOMEONE TELLING YOU WHAT

202
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:45,221
TO THINK.

203
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,423
>> Juan: THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

204
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:48,291
DOWNSIDE TO CONSTANT LYING FROM

205
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,759
THE MAN WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT,

206
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,561
THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY.

207
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,361
PEOPLE CAN'T TRUST HIM.

208
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,765
>> Greg: WE ARE NEVER GOING TO

209
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:56,966
SOLVE THIS.

210
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,568
>> Dana: I THINK EVERY

211
00:05:58,568 --> 00:05:59,335
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH WOULD BE

212
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:01,537
MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT MADE NO

213
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:01,838
NEWS.

214
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,174
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE

215
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:06,409
STUDENTS COME UP FOR THEM TO GO

216
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,744
OUT INTO THE WORLD, TO CELEBRATE

217
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,146
THE FACT THAT THEY ARE GETTING

218
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:10,646
THROUGH COLLEGE.

219
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:11,914
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE

220
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,783
TO GO MAKE THEIR MARK ON THE

221
00:06:13,783 --> 00:06:15,618
WORLD, AND WORRYING ABOUT FAKE

222
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,186
NEWS IS NOT THE HIGHEST

223
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:17,553
PRIORITY.

224
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:18,888
>> Greg: I WANT TO DO A
