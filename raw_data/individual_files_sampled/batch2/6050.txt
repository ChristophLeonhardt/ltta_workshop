loonatics I know that mainstream media won't say that they have to say he said she said they're all even they're not even there's a guy named Paul Gosar who is a United States congressman from Arizona he just said the Vice news that he thinks Charlottesville was a false flag operation funded by George Soros that he pointed out George Soros is Jewish and then he said oh he collaborated with the Nazis that's insane your sources family was haunted by the Nazis in Hungary yes they are Jewish they had to go to and file with the Jewish registry and survive the Holocaust these people have no bounds man there is no bottom to that barrel so I mean there's two parts of this one is what allows some horrible libelous thing to say about someone who survived the Holocaust secondly and this thing that he is doing false flag operations with neo-nazis today that is that is such a he's such a bad guy that Paul Gosar is his name he's a US congressman that's insane that's the second part yeah it's a bad thing but beyond being a bad thing it is only a lunatic would think that and and unfortunately the Republican Party is filled with lunatics so you think it's an accident Donald Trump is their leader now they had 17 choices and Republican voters actively picked the most insane one and they do it over and over again so no they don't represent the majority of the country right now that all Trump is pulling into around 35% so about a third of the country likes him and yes half of the Micha for different reasons but unfortunately there is a significant percentage of runners in this country who have just lost their freakin minds so they think no no everything you source and by the way there's a reason why they think that because their funders fund everything so everything with a party is their rich donors so they fund Rush Limbaugh's show before the Murdoch loses 50 million dollars a year every year on the New York Post he makes money on Fox News but he loses money on Fox News the Mellon Scaife family in Pittsburgh lost money on their newspapers but they did it for propaganda they don't believe in science they don't believe in journalism they don't believe in professors they don't believe in anything that brings you facts and truth they believe in propaganda and they've gotten them subsequently insane things so and they keep agitating against against Soros and so look I don't know that I've never meant to her Soros despite all the insanity on the internet and their ridiculous rumors we're never digging it died from the guy so I got no dog in that fight except what effective it's not true and these people are lunatics and it's no longer just some fringe element and a troll on Twitter or whatever it's US Congress people it's the President of the United States so these parties are not even the Democratic Party has a billion problems and I talk about it all the time and I got no love for them but they're a good party unfortunately this day is filled with the Paul coasters who who were just not big I don't know they're walking around the streets let along with being in the US Congress if I had a lunatic like that working for me I'd get him out of the building as quickly as possible but this I don't know how many dozens of them there are inside our house of representatives and our Senate and they go around masquerading as legitimate people and and by the way the press treats them as such oh there is Steve the Republican Party false flag operation funded by Soros these people are insane
