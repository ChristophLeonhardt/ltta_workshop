Fascist — people
like to use the word
to describe any
politician they don’t like
on both sides of the aisle.
Now it might seem
like an exaggeration
to call Trump a fascist.
I mean, he’s not
calling for a genocide
or imprisoning his own
people without due process.
But I want you to reflect
for a moment on his words,
on his political tactics —
on his rhetoric, if you will.
I’ve devoted the last
decade of my life
to studying
fascist propaganda.
And if you use history
and philosophy as a guide,
it’s easy to see parallels
between Trump’s words
and those of the most
reviled fascists in history.
That scares me.
And it should scare you, too.
We’ve flirted with
fascism before.
“They wore Hitler’s uniforms,
but they wrapped themselves
in the American flag.”
But how are we seeing these
images echoed in 21st-century
America?
“Build that wall!”
Well, the formula for fascism
is surprisingly simple.
And it gets repeated a lot.
Italy and Germany, of
course, but fascist movements
are on the rise today in
India, Myanmar, Hungary,
Turkey, and right here
in the United States.
No matter where
they come from,
fascist politicians everywhere
are cut from the same cloth.
Fascism first takes root
when politicians conjure up
a faith in a mythic past —
a past supposedly destroyed
by liberals, feminists
and immigrants.
For Mussolini, it
was the Roman Empire.
For Erdogan in Turkey,
it’s the Ottomans.
Hungary’s Viktor Orban
rewrote the Constitution with
the goal of “making
Hungary great again” —
a line that sounded
great to someone.
“Did you ever
hear this before?
‘Make America great again.’”
Fascists create an
overwhelming sense
of nostalgia for a past
that is racially pure,
traditional and patriarchal.
From Mussolini to
Hitler to Erdogan,
fascist leaders position
themselves as father figures
and strongmen.
“I want to thank you for
getting this country moving.”
“I can’t thank you
enough for the privilege
that you’ve given me.”
“Greatest privilege
of my life.”
As long as he — and
yes, it’s always a he —
remains in power,
everything is possible.
Without him the whole
system collapses.
“I’ll tell you what.
If I ever got impeached, I
think the market would crash.
I think everybody
would be very poor.”
Once you’ve got
your mythic past,
you need the next ingredient.
Division, whether it’s between
Germans and Jews, Hindus
and Muslims, citizens
and foreigners, whites
and blacks, fascists
succeed by turning groups
against each other.
The Nazis said Jews had no
value because they supposedly
did no mental or
physical work.
In Myanmar, the Rohingya
have been denounced
as rapists and criminals,
a line which will sound
familiar to many Mexicans.
“They’re bringing drugs.
They’re bringing crime.
They’re rapists.
And some, I assume,
are good people.”
When you divide, it’s
easier to control.
Once fascism has
taken root, it
spreads through propaganda — 
and, in particular, a kind
of anti-intellectualism.
“They can make anything
bad, because they
are the fake, fake,
disgusting news.”
Fascists attack the
truth because truth is
central to a free democracy.
“It’s somebody’s version of
the truth, not the truth.”
“Truth is truth.
I don’t mean to go — “
“No, it isn’t truth!
Truth isn’t truth!”
This environment
creates a Petri dish
for conspiracy theories.
Have you seen this symbol
at a Trump rally recently?
It’s a sign for a popular
online conspiracy theory
that the “deep state” is
working to bring down Trump.
It’s not a million miles
away from Viktor Orban’s
wild campaigns against a
global Jewish conspiracy.
With the truth under attack
and lies running wild,
no one can agree on
what’s true anymore.
And fascists love it
when that happens.
You might think I’m
trying to frighten you
by making these parallels.
And do you know what?
I am.
My parents survived
the Holocaust.
And my grandmother,
in her memoir,
wrote about how
Jews in Germany
didn’t see the Nazi threat
until it was too late.
“In 1937, we were still
able to leave the country,"
she wrote.
“We could still
live in our homes.
We could still worship
in our temples.
We were in a ghetto.
But the majority of our
people were still alive.”
I want you to be scared,
because if you’re not
worried about encroaching
fascism in America,
before long, it will
start to feel normal.
And when that happens,
we’re all in trouble.
