NATO's Secretary General's warning the political disagreements and infighting risk tearing the International military alliance apart but at a speech in London yen Stoltenberg did insist that preserving NATO is in the interests of its 29 member states these disagreements are real it is not written in stone that the transatlantic bond will survive forever but I believe we will preserve it those comments and Stoltenberg skal for unity came ahead of next month's NATO summit which it's feared could lay bare the differences between a number of member states the NATO chief has said that within Europe the EU political orientation and shifting values could have an impact on the strength of the Alliance and the key points of contention between Washington and its partners are over trade attitudes towards climate change and the future of the Iran nuclear deal but despite the divisions political analyst Chris Bambury told us he thinks the role that NATO plays will ensure it survives this is not a defensive Alliance anymore it's very much an offensive alliance particularly in regards to the Russian Federation because of that expansion around Russia's Russian Federation's borders the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO it's effectively part of that alliance alliance now the presence of NATO forces in Eastern Europe the build-up of NATO bases right along the southern as well as the western border of the Russian Federation this is a very dangerous game I think NATO will survive on balance because for the United States NATO expansion to virtually surround the Russian Federation has been very important and the minotaur presence has been built up in Russia's borders so for that at least they're going to they want to keep Nate and NATO you
