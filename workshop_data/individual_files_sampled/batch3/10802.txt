please say when I joined again by josie marino the Manchester United manager he's back with us after watching that game what a start for Russia Joseph yeah was good but before the match we was speaking about the Russians to be so pessimistic and I don't think you have you you don't have a reason to be super optimistic be happy good victory good score who knows that the walls can be important in case for example you finish with the same number of points let's say Egypt but not not to be so optimistic because so the disappointed me I watch them against Germany I know it was a friendly but against Germany they look better than them today which parts of their game don't you like then as a manager which areas would you like to see them improve you know I think that's the reality of the football probably the reality of their championship the majority of the players they play in the three riyadh clubs and probably that's that's a level i cannot say i know that some of the players they went to spain with the objective to play some matches in the didn't even in in lower level clubs so probably this is their level but i think the russians they did they did fine because they used their strengths they were compact defensively they try to find some weaknesses they score a couple of goals in the first half and then game over it was just a control what about the the managers work the substitutions that he made and I was forced to wish Chekov got injured and he puts a cherisheth on and then you get white scored two goals and Zuba came on the score two goals that's that's always a great feeling for us manners as well you make a change in and that works but I always say that when we do it we do it for Goods sometimes doesn't work sometimes it does but today I think even for his own self-confidence for his own self-esteem probably for its credibility amongst of the Russian fans that's the best thing that can happen to to the manager I think it changed the team in relation to the match I watch in Austria he played with with the back four which is normal against a team like like like Saudi I think shockwave was playing quite well but when he come out the fact that Gallivan go to a more central position I think it helped the team the team become better galavan is a playmaker is a play that gives the dynamic of the team Dennis HF is a fast boy on on the wing more a winger than than Gallivan stretched the game more than the Laveen so I think the change worked perfectly and then Zubaz physically very very strong who do you think he's giving himself a nervy selection problem for a challenge for the next game because small office he was not in sex with non existent in this game he didn't play well and now with the zoo becaming on I know he changed the game a little bit in the way they play but it was more effective for him soubise the striker is what you call old-fashioned striker is good in he's good in the box I would say if fresh is going to be dominant like the world today and the control I think he can be effective what I don't see in Zuba is when Russia to play against better teams and probably the striker will be further from for scoring areas I don't see Zuba with enough but even with the way it's more delayed today would you still sort of keep faith in him and hope that he's picking up his game we we managers we are like I used to say in the good sense of the word sometimes we are a bit of a strange animal sometimes we see things that other people doesn't see and other people see things that we don't see and sometimes we really believe in some players and we don't believe in others and I really believe that that treasures of trust small off I think you can hold the ball I think technically is not a bad is not a bad player at all so probably it's not because of one match specially against a team like Saudi that just was always going to change his mind do you think his confidence faded slightly today small over front because he had you were saying weren't you Peter he seemed to play one good short pass but everything he was doing today it's again it's expectations and it's pressure so obviously he is a he's a he's a big man in this team he is a star playing and today just didn't have what it takes to be a star player star players must go out in my opinion and have a very high minimum level and for me he was a disappointment today you had one pass in the first half which is a four yard pass yeah successful yeah I agree I agree but I I think the miners will go more in the direction of what we did as a team we did it as a team we were in control since the beginning we got a great result we changed the expectations which change the negativity around the team probably Zubaz is full of confidence now but I wouldn't be surprised if he keeps Maul off in the team and keeps you with these ambition and the positive feeling of I have you on the bench you can come and you can change the game so I don't think he's going to is going to change much what I think it has really to think is that Egypt is better than than Saudi and Uruguay is better than Egypt so what about defensively defensively I felt that of course they didn't have any problems I think inertia which was clever in the way where he control well the position of the line he didn't feel that they were threat so he didn't protect him Jew back I think he has to do that when he plays against Cavani when he plays against Suarez because the inertia weeds and all the defensive players they are not really fast even Mario I know Marie for many many years Mario is is a better wing than a defensive fullback Shirokov is a little bit of the same so if he wants to keep the back for it has to drop the line a little bit back to play against Salah to play against kabbani to play against Suarez and again the solid players they were not he's experimented in the last four or five games with three at the back five in the back for the back do you think he he's convinced I saw the performance today which form a formation he would play I think more of the four of the five is more the position of the block these boys they were not a threat they had some some skill they had some good football in short spaces but they were not aggressive they were not physical they didn't have power to attack even the space salad is super fast you think he can't yell when he plays against I think at least at least against us against Russia you Cavani and Suarez they're fast they're clever the way they attack the space behind defenders the distances between defenders so I think Russia has to drop the block a little a little bit more in a way where inertia which feels more more comfortable okay
