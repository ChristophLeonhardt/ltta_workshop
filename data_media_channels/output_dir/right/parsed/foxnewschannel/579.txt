ENTERED A MODEL       ANDREW NA.
I REALLY WANT TO PICK YOUR BRAIN
I REALLY WANT TO PICK YOUR BRAIN
WITH HIS FIRST QUESTION AND I’VE
WITH HIS FIRST QUESTION AND I’VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ROSENSTEIN
WEATHER IS TODAY OR LATER DATE
ACTUALLY RESIGNING FOR THE
PRESIDENT FIRING HIM.
CAN YOU DRILL DOWN FARTHER?
>> OF THE PRESIDENT FIRES
ROSENSTEIN, HE WILL BE
DISREGARDING THE ADVICE OF
MANY REPUBLICANS, NOT THE LEAST
OF WHOM WAS MITCH McCONNELL
WHO LAST WEEK SAID PLEASE DIAL
BACK ON THE TWEETS ABOUT
CONDUCTOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FOR
IT AND PLEASE DON’T DISRUPT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE --
DON’T DO ANY OF THIS BEFORE THE
MIDTERMS BECAUSE EITHER OF THOSE
MIDTERMS BECAUSE EITHER OF THOSE
THINGS ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR JOB
THINGS ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR JOB
CONFIRMING JUDGE KAVANAUGH MORE
DIFFICULT AND HER JOB TRYING TO
KEEP THE SENATE IN THE HOUSE
MORE DIFFICULT.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE
PRESIDENT WERE TO FIRE ROD
ROSENSTEIN OR TEAM WERE TO
RESIGN, HE IS JIM COMEY’S BEST
WITNESS ON THE OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE CHARGES BECAUSE HE WAS
THERE WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID
COME UP AND GIVE ME A BASIS TO
JUSTIFY FIRING COMEY.
HERE IS REALLY WHERE I WANT TO
DO IT.
NOW YOU MAKE IT LOOK KOSHER.
>> Harris: SO YOU’VE JUST
GIVEN US A POLITICAL SIDE AND I
ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER
THE PRESIDENT COULD FILL THIS
POSITION IF BY NOT RESIGNATION.
>> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BY A
FEDERAL STATUTE MUST BE RUN BY A
FEDERAL STATUTE MUST BE RUN BY A
HUMAN BEING WHO IS CONCERNED BY
THE SENATE.
HE HAS REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE
MUELLER PROBE SO THE PROBE MUST
BE RUN BY SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.
IF HE LEAVES TODAY, THE NEXT
PERSON IN LINE IS FRANCISCO.
IF HE DOESN’T WANT TO DO THIS OR
IF HE DOESN’T WANT TO DO THIS OR
CAN’T DO IT, THE NEXT PERSON IN
LINE, THERE’S NO ONE UP THERE
THAT I AM AWARE OF WHO HAS BEEN
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE SO ONE
OF THE TWO OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO
OF THE TWO OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO
DO IT.
I DON’T THINK IT BRINGS ABOUT
ANY CHANGE IN THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION AT OLD DUMB AT
ALL.
HE HAS PROFOUND LEGAL AND
ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS TO SEEK THE
EVIDENCE THAT HE HAS BEEN
CHARGED WITH SEEKING AND TO
PROSECUTE IF HE FEELS HE HAS A
STRONG ENOUGH CASE AND IF THERE
ARE NEW BOSSES INTERFERING WITH
THAT.
>> Harris: BEFORE I PASS THIS
ON QUICKLY, WHAT ABOUT THE NEW
DEPUTY AG THEN FIRING ROBERT
MUELLER?
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> YES.
OF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE -- CAN
OF THE PRESIDENT CAN FIRE -- CAN
INSTRUCT ROD ROSENSTEIN TO FIRE
BOB MUELLER AND THE PRESIDENT
CAN INSTRUCT THE NEW DEPUTY AG
TO FIRE BOB MUELLER.
THE PRESIDENT WILL EVENTUALLY
WANT HIS OWN DEPUTY AG.
NO WAY THE SENATE IS GOING TO
CONFIRM THAT PERSON BETWEEN NOW
AND THE MIDTERMS, PROBABLY NOT
GOING TO CONFIRM THAT PERSON
BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEW SENATE
COMING IN RIGHT AFTER THE FIRST
OF THE YEAR.
AND THEY MIGHT BE CONFIRMING TWO
AND THEY MIGHT BE CONFIRMING TWO
PEOPLE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL AS
WELL AS THE DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
>> Melissa: YOU SAY THE
PRESIDENT WANTS HIS OWN PERSON
IN THERE AND DEPUTY AG BUT
TECHNICALLY, ROD ROSENSTEIN IS
HIS OWN PERSON.
BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS PICKED HIM
BECAUSE JEFF SESSIONS PICKED HIM
WANTING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SORT OF
WANTING SOMEBODY WHO WAS SORT OF
A CAREER IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO
CAN KIND OF GIVE THEM THE INS
AND OUTS.
>> ALL OF THAT IS CORRECT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS THIS ATTITUDE
ABOUT LOYALTY BUT EVEN IF YOU
ARE MY PERSON, EVEN IF I MAJOR
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, EVEN IF I
DO, THE BEHAVIOR MANIFEST AS
LOYALTY AS I DEFINE IT, I DON’T
LIKE IT STAYING THERE BUT YOU
ARE QUITE CORRECT, THE PRESIDENT
ARE QUITE CORRECT, THE PRESIDENT
NOMINATED AS A SENATE CONFIRMED
ROD ROSENSTEIN.
JEFF SESSIONS SUGGESTED HIM
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN IN THE
SENATE FOR 24 YEARS EVEN THOUGH
HE’S A FORMER PROSECUTOR HIMSELF
HE’S A FORMER PROSECUTOR HIMSELF
AND HE NEEDED AN OLD HAND SO TO
SPEAK TO BE HIS CHIEF OPERATING
OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE WHICH IS WHAT HE GOT IN
ROD ROSENSTEIN.
>> Christopher: LOOK LIKE I’M
MISSING SOME GREAT WEATHER BACK
IN D.C.
THIS GUY IS A ROCK-RIBBED
CONSERVATIVE, FEDERALIST SOCIETY
CONSERVATIVE, FEDERALIST SOCIETY
KIND OF GUY, IF HE WERE TO TAKE
OVER THIS JOB WERE THIS TO BE A
TRUE STORY, WERE HE TO BE
RECONFIRMED BY THE SENATE OR IS
HE ALREADY A POLITICAL APPOINTEE
HE ALREADY A POLITICAL APPOINTEE
AND IS ABLE TO DO THE JOB?
>> THAT’S A GOOD QUESTION,
THANK YOU FOR IT.
HE THEN BECOMES THE THEN ACTING
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE REMAINS
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE REMAINS
AS SOLICITOR GENERAL.
HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE
RECONFIRMED.
TRUNK AND KEEP THEM IN THAT
POSITION FOR THE DURATION OF
TRUMP’S PRESIDENCY OR HE CAN
NOMINATE SOMEONE ELSE FOR THAT
POSITION PENDING CONFIRMATION BY
POSITION PENDING CONFIRMATION BY
