1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,274
>> Greg: TUESDAY, 18

2
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,108
REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS

3
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:14,144
NOMINATED TRUMP FOR THE NOBEL

4
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,979
PRIZE.

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:17,981
SHOULD TRUMP SHARE THE AWARD IF

6
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:18,448
INDEED HE WINS?

7
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:22,986
WE HEAR ABOUT KIM, PRESIDENT XI,

8
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:24,187
MOON.

9
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:24,721
WHAT ABOUT THE WORM?

10
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,958
DENNIS RODMAN CLAIMS KIM JONG UN

11
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,392
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND TRUMP UNTIL

12
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:30,894
RODMAN GAVE HIM "THE ART OF THE

13
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,329
DEAL" LAST YEAR.

14
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,231
THE BOOK LED TO A CHANGE OF

15
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:36,733
HEART.

16
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:40,237
>> I THINK HIS IMPRESSION ABOUT

17
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:44,774
DONALD TRUMP AND THE AMERICAN

18
00:00:44,774 --> 00:00:45,909
PEOPLE.

19
00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:47,544
>> Greg: TRUMP IS GOING TO

20
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,246
MEET WITH KIM AND MAY BE

21
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:50,380
AMERICAN HOSTAGES MIGHT BE

22
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,747
RELEASED.

23
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:51,982
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING NEWS.

24
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:54,584
WE WENT TO CNN AND MSNBC FOR

25
00:00:54,584 --> 00:01:02,959
RESPONSE.

26
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,160
>> NO, PLEASE.

27
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,797
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

28
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,232
>> Greg: THEY HATE ANY GOOD

29
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,634
NEWS ABOUT TRUMP.

30
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,070
RODMAN MAY BE THE OBAMA

31
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:14,838
ADMINISTRATION'S MOST SUCCESSFUL

32
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:15,772
DIPLOMAT.

33
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,607
MAKES YOU WONDER, SHOULD OBAMA

34
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:19,209
HAVE SENT PEYTON MANNING TO TALK

35
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,745
TO PUTIN?

36
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:24,381
ALEX RODRIGUEZ TO CHINA, JOHNNY

37
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:25,782
MANDEL TO TEHRAN?

38
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:26,750
ANYTHING COULD'VE WORKED.

39
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,450
AS LONG AS THEY HAD A COPY OF

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,219
THE BOOK.

41
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,720
THEY WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER THAN

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,589
HILLARY AND SAMANTHA POWER.

43
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:35,926
AS FAR AS THOSE THREE HOSTAGES,

44
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:37,594
WHO IS A BETTER NEGOTIATOR?

45
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:39,029
OBAMA AND HILLARY OR TRUMP AND

46
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:39,796
RODMAN.

47
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:42,165
WE ALL KNOW I HAVE AS MUCH

48
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:44,134
CHANCE OF WINNING THAT AS TRUMP

49
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:47,470
DOES.

50
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,008
THE EXACT QUALITIES THAT TURN

51
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:57,981
OFF LARS IN OSLO.

52
00:01:57,981 --> 00:01:59,582
NO MATTER WHAT, TRUMP AND RODMAN

53
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:00,951
HAS GOTTEN US FURTHER WITH THE

54
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,186
NUCLEAR THREAT THAN ALL OF THE

55
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:04,587
BELTWAY DABBLERS OUT THERE.

56
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:06,790
MAYBE THEY SHOULD READ THE BOOK

57
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,591
TOO.

58
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,995
DANA, YOU ARE AT THE TABLE WHEN

59
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:14,264
I CALLED DENNIS RODMAN A LITTLE

60
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:16,366
B WORD BECAUSE HE WENT TO

61
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,801
NORTH KOREA.

62
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:18,768
MY MEA CULPA.

63
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:21,037
I THINK I WAS WRONG, AND I

64
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:21,938
SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO DENNIS

65
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:22,439
RODMAN.

66
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,373
HE'S AN AMERICAN HERO.

67
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:25,408
>> Dana: I THINK YOU SHOULD

68
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,376
RESERVE YOUR JUDGMENT.

69
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:29,346
I WONDER HOW JOHN KERRY ESCAPED

70
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:30,046
THE MONOLOGUE.

71
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:32,182
>> Greg: HE MOVES VERY SLOW.

72
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:32,816
HE BLENDED INTO THE WOODEN

73
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,618
BACKGROUND THAT I DIDN'T SEE HIM

74
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:37,387
BACKGROUND THAT I DIDN'T SEE HI

75
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:37,687
HIM.

76
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:40,056
>> Dana: WHO DID HE TAKE ON?

77
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,792
JAMES TAYLOR TO PARIS.

78
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,028
>> Greg: AMERICA WAS HAPPY

79
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:45,996
BECAUSE JAMES TAYLOR WAS NOT IN

80
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:47,597
THE COUNTRY FOR A FEW DAYS.

81
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,965
>> Dana: I THINK IF IN THE

82
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,567
LONG RUN WE ACTUALLY DO FIND A

83
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,701
PEACEFUL SOLUTION HERE, WHICH

84
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:55,405
THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO, THEN

85
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:57,207
OF COURSE PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD

86
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:59,376
BE GRANTED, WARDEN, EXCUSE ME.

87
00:02:59,376 --> 00:02:59,976
THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

88
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:03,246
I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE BIG

89
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:04,748
THINGS AND THE REASON I DON'T

90
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:05,982
THINK DENNIS RODMAN DESERVE SO

91
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,784
MUCH CREDIT IS THE STRATEGIC

92
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:09,486
PLAN TO SQUEEZE CHINA AND GET

93
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,253
CHINA TO GET LITTLE ROCKET MAN

94
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:12,989
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

95
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,324
THAT'S THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS

96
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:15,191
WHOLE PLAN.

97
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,594
>> Greg: WHO STARTED THAT,

98
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:17,961
KIMBERLY?

99
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:21,164
A MAN NAMED DONALD TRUMP.

100
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,766
>> Kimberly: THE ART OF THE

101
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:23,066
DEAL.

102
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:27,137
FOLLOWING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT,

103
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:31,041
DENMAN THIS

104
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:31,775
DENNIS RODMAN WAS ABLE TO CHANGE

105
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:36,179
THE MIND-SET OF KIM JONG UN.

106
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,448
OPEN TO THE CHARMS OF POTUS AND

107
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:40,383
HE THEREFORE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT,

108
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,885
I'M GOING TO STOP BEING A BAD

109
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,386
ACTOR AND I'M GOING TO GET IT

110
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:43,987
TOGETHER.

111
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:45,488
AND I'M GOING TO SHAKE HANDS AND

112
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:48,458
WORK WITH SOUTH KOREA, AND I'M

113
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,592
GOING TO RELEASE HOSTAGES, AND

114
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,127
I'M GOING TO STOP RUNNING AROUND

115
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:52,595
BEING LITTLE ROCKET MAN.

116
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:56,566
>> Greg: I WAS THINKING, JUAN,

117
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,767
YOU SHOULD GO TO IRAN WITH MY

118
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:58,468
BOOK AND I THINK THAT WOULD

119
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:02,172
SOLVE EVERYTHING.

120
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,207
>> Jesse: MIGHT NOT EVER COME

121
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:04,774
BACK.

122
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:05,408
IS THAT YOUR IDEA?

123
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:08,978
>> Greg: IT IS A WIN-WIN

124
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,146
EITHER WAY.

125
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,782
>> Juan: OH, MY GOD.

126
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:13,783
IT COULD WORK.

127
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:16,185
ANYTHING FOR GREG, YOU KNOW THAT

128
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:16,685
ANYTHING FOR GREG, YOU KNOW THA

129
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:17,987
THAT.

130
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,789
>> Jesse: ANOTHER HOSTAGES

131
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,124
WERE GOING TO HAVE TO GET.

132
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:23,827
>> Dana: WE WILL GET RIGHT ON

133
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:29,999
IT.

134
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:32,569
>> Juan: JESSE CAN BE MY SEAL.

135
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:33,470
>> Jesse: YOU ARE NEVER

136
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,206
GETTING OUT THEN.

137
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,307
>> Juan: STRUCK BY DENNIS

138
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:37,640
RODMAN.

139
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,309
I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL.

140
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:42,378
I THINK YOU ARE HAVING FUN.

141
00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:43,546
>> Kimberly: HE IS SERIOUS.

142
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:44,481
>> Juan: WHAT YOU SAID IS

143
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:50,587
SERIOUS, KIMBERLY.

144
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,988
>> Greg: WE TALK ABOUT HOW

145
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,790
BOOK CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

146
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,391
>> Dana: WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN

147
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,393
THE BOOK AND NOW?

148
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:58,962
HE ACTUALLY GOT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

149
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,331
>> Greg: WELL, THAT IS THE ART

150
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:01,731
OF THE DEAL.

151
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:07,070
NEGOTIATION.

152
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,140
THE ART OF THE DEAL IS RIGHT UP

153
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,807
THERE.

154
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:13,009
A FEW YEARS AGO YOU WOULD'VE

155
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:14,777
SAID DONALD TRUMP AND DENNIS

156
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,412
RODMAN, WITH THE SUPPORT OF

157
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:17,213
KANYE WEST, WERE ENDING THE

158
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,382
KOREAN WAR, I WOULD'VE DROPPED

159
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:19,682
DEAD.

160
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:23,186
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

161
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:25,788
>> Kimberly: CHECK YOUR PULSE.

162
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:27,390
>> Jesse: THE MIDDLE EAST,

163
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,258
SEND RODMAN.

164
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,760
MAYBE THEY CAN SHARE THE PEACE

165
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,194
PRIZE.

166
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:32,729
EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING FOR A

167
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:33,062
REASON.

168
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:34,597
>> Greg: ON A SERIOUS POINT,

169
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:36,132
WE HEAR OF THE IMMINENT RELEASE

170
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,201
OF THESE HOSTAGES.

171
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,203
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

172
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,304
MIKE POMPEO WHEN HE WAS THERE

173
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,540
AND HE MET WITH KIM JONG UN, IT

174
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,310
WAS PROBABLY A CONDITION, AND

175
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,945
ALSO JOHN BOLTON, THE NEW

176
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,813
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.

177
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,248
WE ARE NOT -- REMEMBER BOWE

178
00:05:52,248 --> 00:05:54,651
BERGDAHL AND THE TRADE?

179
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,386
NOT A GOOD TRADE.

180
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,521
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THIS

181
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,223
ADMINISTRATION.

182
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:00,857
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY

183
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,025
PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE WILLING

184
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,928
TO MEET WITH SOMEBODY WHO WAS

185
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,596
HOLDING AMERICANS HOSTAGE IN A

186
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:06,996
LABOR CAMP.

187
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,965
IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN,

188
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,800
THEY HAVE TO BE RELEASED.

189
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,402
TWO OF THEM WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE

190
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,405
IN 2017, ONE BEFORE THAT, I

191
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:16,005
THINK 2015.

192
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:17,073
APPARENTLY THEY ARE AT A HOTEL

193
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:17,440
NOW.

194
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,808
THEY HAVE BEEN MOVED FROM THE

195
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:19,876
CAMP TO A HOTEL.

196
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:20,877
WHEN WE MEET THEM.

197
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,412
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

198
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,580
INTERESTING AND IT WILL PROBABLY

199
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,814
TAKE YEARS TO GET ALL THE

200
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:25,648
INFORMATION.

201
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,150
IMAGINE WHAT WE MIGHT LEARN FROM

202
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,187
THEM ABOUT HOW KIM JONG UN

203
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:31,988
ACTUALLY WORKS.

204
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:34,490
I WANT TO TAP THE BRAKES ON THIS

205
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,792
IDEA THAT KIM JONG UN SHOULD

206
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:36,492
SHARE IN A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

207
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:38,127
HE'S A HORRIBLE PIECE IN.

208
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,798
>> Juan: WE HAD RELEASES IN

209
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,867
'09 WITH BILL CLINTON AND UP '

210
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:45,134
'10.

211
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,970
THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE AT STATE

212
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,504
AND OTHERS SAY, IT'S PART OF HIS

213
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:48,871
BEHAVIOR.

214
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,607
THIS IS HOW HE PLAYS THE GAME.

215
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:51,608
HE MAKES OFFERS.

216
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:54,010
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT OUR STRATEGY

217
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,444
IS, GOING IN.

218
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:56,813
I SEE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO

219
00:06:56,813 --> 00:00:00,000
CELEBRATE EARLY.
