Wild parties.
Roots in Hell.
How did marijuana get such a bad wrap?
The answer is simple.
(record scratch)
Racism.

As early as the 1800s, there
were no federal restrictions
on the sale or possession
of cannabis in the US.
Hemp fiber from the plant was used to make
clothes, paper, and rope.
Sometimes it was used medicinally,
but as a recreational drug,
it wasn't that widespread.
A New York Times article
from 1876 even cites
the positive use of cannabis
to cure a patient's dropsy.
Basically swelling from
an accumulation of fluid.
In the early 1900s an influx of
Mexican immigrants came to the US
fleeing political unrest
in their home country.
With them, they brought
the practice of smoking
cannabis recreationally.
And it took off.
The Spanish word for the plant
started to be used more often too.
Marijuana.
Or as it was spelled at that
time, marihuana, with an H.
This is when the more
sensational headlines
about the drug began to appear.
In 1936, a propaganda film
called Reefer Madness was released.
In the movie, teenagers
smoke weed for the first time
and this leads to a
series of horrific events
involving hallucination,
attempted rape, and murder.

Much of the media portrayed
it as a gateway drug.
-  Marijuana,
a powerful excitant,
produces unpredictable emotional results.
But its greatest danger lies in the fact
that it is a stepping
stone to the harder drugs
such as morphine and heroine.
The following year in 1937,
the Marihuana Tax Act was passed.
Cannabis sales were now taxed.
Part of the reason this act was passed
was because of all the fear
mongering going on at the time.
(old timey dramatic music)
And a huge instigator
of that fear mongering
was the man behind the Marihuana Tax Act,
Harry Anslinger.
Anslinger was named the Commissioner
of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics
during the prohibition era.
But once national
prohibition ended in 1933,
Anslinger turned his focus to marijuana.
This is when racism and
xenophobia really kicked in.
Harry Anslinger took the
scientifically unsupported
idea of marijuana as a
violence inducing drug,
connected it to black and Hispanic people,
and created a perfect package of terror
to sell to the American media and public.
By emphasizing the Spanish word marihuana
instead of cannabis, he
created a strong association
between the drug and the newly
arrived Mexican immigrants
who helped popularize it in the States.
He also created a
narrative around the idea
that cannabis made black people
forget their place in society.
He pushed the idea that
jazz was evil music
created by people under
the influence of marijuana.
But these racist ideas
didn't just influence
the media's portrayal or the
public's perception of the drug,
the discrimination they encouraged
was evident in real numbers.
In the first full year after
the Marihuana Tax Act was passed,
black people were about
three times more likely
to be arrested for violating
narcotic drug laws than whites.
And Mexicans were nearly
nine times more likely `
to be arrested for the same charge.
By 1952, the Boggs Act was passed.
This made sentencing for
drug convictions mandatory.
A first offense for possession
could land you two to five years in prison
and a fine up to $2,000.
Through the 1960s and 70s,
weed smoking took on a new perception
through the counter culture movement.
Young white people
resisted mainstream culture
and powerful institutions.
This was the era of hippies,
beatniks, and flower power.
But despite all the peace and love,
laws continued to emphasize
the severity of the drug.
The Controlled Substances Act of 1970
passed under President Nixon.
- America's public enemy number one.
- Repealed the Marihuana Tax Act
and instead made cannabis
a schedule I drug.
The most serious class.
Schedule I drugs are considered to have
a high potential for abuse and addiction.
With no medical use.
Other examples of Schedule I drugs
are heroin, LSD, and ecstasy.
Classifying cannabis as a schedule I drug
has been highly debated since then.
- Marijuana is not a schedule I
any more than a hedgehog
is an apex predator.
- But to this day, it
remains in that category
and criminalization
still disproportionately
affects minority groups in the US.
The ACLU reported that in 2010,
black people were four times more likely
to be arrested for
marijuana than white people,
even though both groups consume marijuana
at about the same rate.
Some states have taken action to
reduce this type of criminalization.
Nine states and Washington DC
have legalized the
recreational use of cannabis.
And 29 states allow some
form of medical marijuana.
San Francisco recently dropped
thousands of marijuana
related convictions.
And Seattle plans to do the same.
But this doesn't change
the federal restrictions.
And Attorney General Jeff Sessions
seems Hell bent on enforcing
those federal rules.
- Good people don't smoke marijuana.
- Kansas State
Representative Steven Alford
made a case against legalizing cannabis
by referring to the racist rhetoric
of the Anslinger era.
- And we're still seeing a lot of
anti-immigrant sentiment.
- They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime,
their rapists.
- So while some things have
changed on the state level,
some politicians are sticking
with the fear mongering
and racism playbook.
Even though Pew Research polls show that
61% of Americans now approve
of nationwide legalization.
Up from 16% about 30 years ago.
Popular opinion suggests it's high time
to reconsider federal laws.
