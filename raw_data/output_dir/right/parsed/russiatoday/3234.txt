now one of the retail industries busiest
days of the year is seeing employees
looking to cash in as well to help get
your hands on some of the best deals
Black Friday has to offer
some employees in the US have been
selling off their uniforms to help
shoppers skip the cues and the checkout
did I ever get the uniform no I did not
get the uniform and no I wasn't able to
sell it because I don't have the uniform
the question was do I believe that it
will work
I'm not your dissent I believe it will
work
