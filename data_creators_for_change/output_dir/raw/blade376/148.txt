00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
hi everyone 2011 had a great start to

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:08,029
the year I know I did Sunday Monday

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:16,020
Tuesday Wednesday happy Thursday night

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,449
having flu is definitely not why I had

5
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,039
planned for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first week now growing</font>

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,080
up I always believed when it came to

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,939
feeling good about yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all</font>

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,880
depends on just one factor in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there your</font>

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,279
mind it didn't matter how fit you were

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,289
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right mental preparation</font>

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,690
if you were that determined to go the

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,969
full distance you could achieve it and

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,040
about five years ago I did the great

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,460
north run 13 miles I completed it but

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,230
one thing I didn't do was trained for

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,090
the event and when you do these sort of

17
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,149
things you are recommended to train

18
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,430
because it is said after all that the

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,039
sport that most people die in is long

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,050
distance running but I sincerely thought

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,280
that if I turned up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a positive</font>

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
mental attitude I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it but</font>

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,340
yeah okay I did do it and I did it in

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,680
two hours which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a really</font>

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">good time but that's not the point I</font>

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,909
still love<font color="#CCCCCC"> my lesson because at the end</font>

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,420
of it I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like death and to be honest</font>

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,250
that was the last proper exercise I ever

29
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,049
did during my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first year at university I</font>

30
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,509
signed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the University gym which</font>

31
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,210
was literally two minutes walk from my

32
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,640
apartment how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I go in</font>

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,619
the air just once smiles you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,579
disgrace ah ok they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to beat myself</font>

35
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:31,829
up about it all right I mean I've

36
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,030
already learned my lesson which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,619
actually why I'm doing this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,290
just bear with me miles and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,070
to myself now like usual so I regard

40
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,229
myself as a mentally strong person but

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,930
actually to flip my old theory around<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,420
feel to be an even stronger person

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,630
mentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to be physically fit I</font>

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,329
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dedicate a day every week to</font>

45
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,600
deal with my mental and physical

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,110
well-being healthy<font color="#CCCCCC"> gbagbo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds</font>

47
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,880
maybe a bit too full feel good Monday's

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,639
yeah my great must get healthy or an

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,410
apple will come into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your room and cut</font>

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,239
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday what you're not feeling the</font>

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:12,900
name

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">no me neither so I thought I'd list what</font>

53
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,250
I plan to do I've joined a gym again but

54
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,540
this time I'm definitely going to do it

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,670
and how am I so sure because I joined

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,470
with my brother I think it's reasonable

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,360
to assume that if you have a gym partner

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,579
you're more likely to go but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

59
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the gym comes healthy eating and</font>

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,970
that's something I've always struggled

61
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,489
with because with busy days I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

62
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,890
up using ready meals and it's just so so

63
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,840
terrible so if any of you know any

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,140
really good recipes of quick but healthy

65
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,150
food to have which also<font color="#CCCCCC"> taste good</font>

66
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very important then please let me</font>

67
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,780
know I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually</font>

68
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work but I know Nintendo has</font>

69
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,780
one of these brain games I'm sure it's

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,150
not called that but on the PlayStation

71
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,129
free there is brain challenge and it

72
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:58,260
just gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lots of different tests</font>

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,730
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a go every day</font>

74
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,340
to just try and keep my mind active<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,659
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also take time out to</font>

76
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,489
meditate I've got some great<font color="#E5E5E5"> music on my</font>

77
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,560
computer so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just chill to</font>

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,290
that and just switch off I've decided

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,389
monday is it going to be when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do all</font>

80
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,329
my paperwork sorting out all my bills my

81
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,310
invoicing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I'm self-employed it's</font>

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,079
stuff that does stress me out but I feel

83
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I just get it all done in one</font>

84
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,180
day or free up the rest of the week and

85
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,220
do me good in the long run which

86
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,859
includes house cleaning my room than my

87
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,190
studio it's a complete mess right now

88
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm glad you can't see it and finally

89
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
something else I really want to do is

90
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,280
spend some quality time reading the

91
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,290
letters you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have sent me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this box is</font>

92
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,379
absolutely filled with letters from I

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,449
wanted to read the letters when I

94
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,659
actually had some time to properly

95
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,250
immerse myself in what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said me</font>

96
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,049
but with the craziness of my world last

97
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,239
year I never really got time to do it

98
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,310
and I felt terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I promise that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

99
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,930
mondays now I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font>

100
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,690
a good hour I'm going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right I</font>

101
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">better get started oh and in case you're</font>

102
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,069
wondering what the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the monday is</font>

103
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:06,419
because the three earlier were just a

104
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,579
joke well perhaps you should read the

105
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,799
title of the video and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want an</font>

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,349
explanation because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's about me</font>

107
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:17,608
helping me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also it stands for meme</font>

108
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,918
because hopefully it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just me</font>

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will pass on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone</font>

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">else will be trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to better themselves</font>

111
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:24,990
physically immense

112
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,410
me too so um remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I I do have</font>

113
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,509
some good<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas from time to time honest</font>

114
00:04:30,509 --> 00:00:00,000
but
