we're all aware that a couple weeks ago Donald Trump had his first big sit-down meeting with Vladimir Putin it went massively longer than they expected it to over two hours of talking until finally Melania Trump had to go in and try to shut it down so that's the meeting that we know about found out today actually from a political scientist and president of Eurasia group Ian Bremmer who told Charlie Rose that there was actually a second meeting that hadn't previously been disclosed it happened after some sort of state dinner that was held the dinner happened and then Donald Trump at Vladimir Putin met for what the amount of time that we don't currently know yet the content of the conversation we don't currently know yet and what action might be taken based on that conversation we don't currently know yet but it is interesting that they did not reveal it earlier look there's plenty of meetings that people don't know about because they're autumn portent a meeting between the US president and the leader of Russia when everybody's talking about whether Russia and the US president have a deal that they don't announce other people and they do after a two-hour 15 minute meeting yeah raises questions so what was the thing they wanted to talk about off the record that they didn't want anyone else to know about I would just caution I mean if they really wanted to have a super secret meeting then a political scientist wouldn't have seen it they wouldn't have met up on the sidelines after a dinner that sounds more like as we know after that meeting there was all this speculation from both sides about what was said at the meeting what wasn't said at that first meeting it's possible one of them wanted to follow up based on those revelations and that I here's the reason I don't agree with you is because in every James Bond movie where there's a super-secret installation who's milling about in the background scientists have access through these are both excellent points thank you but remember that one of the people involved is named Donald Trump you think he's gonna be savvy enough to be like no no let's make sure that nobody sees this remember he decided on military strikes in the middle of Mara Lago with guests milling around taking pictures of secret documents that's true and like I said we don't what was discussed at the meeting we do know we can sort of speculate about what the intent was we know Donald Trump bought Vaughn we're putting some furniture is mine I wanted to move on and maybe like a bitch support independent media come join us at the Young Turks TYT Network calm slash join
