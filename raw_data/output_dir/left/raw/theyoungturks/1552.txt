1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,019
IN AN EFFORT TO FURTHER
DELEGITIMIZE SPECIAL

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:07,380
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,099
RUSSIAN COLLUSION, HOUSE
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOW

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:14,949
DEMANDING A RESOLUTION CALLING
FOR A SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL

5
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:18,930
TO INVESTIGATE THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE AND THE FBI.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,740
THIS IS THEIR RESPONSE TO A NEW
YORK TIMES REPORT THAT WAS

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,210
RELEASED LAST WEEK INDICATING
THAT DURING THE

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,590
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE FBI
HAD A SECRET INFORMANT

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,170
INFILTRATE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
BECAUSE THERE WAS EVIDENCE

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,870
INDICATING THAT SOME OF THE
PEOPLE WORKING FOR THE

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,830
CAMPAIGN HAD SOME CONNECTION TO
RUSSIANS.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,760
SO THAT REPORT, WHICH I AM GOING
TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS ON IN

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,160
JUST A MINUTE HAS BEEN
MISCONSTRUED AND TWISTED IN A

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,809
WAY TO MAKE IT SEEM AS THOUGH IT
WAS A POLITICAL EFFORT I

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,880
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO GO
AFTER TRUMP, BUT KEEP IN

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,360
MIND THAT THIS HAPPENED DURING
THE ELECTION.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,250
WE DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
IT UNTIL NOW.

18
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,229
THE FBI WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS
TO CONCEAL IT WHILE

19
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,229
SIMULTANEOUSLY

20
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,780
VERY PUBLICLY INVESTIGATING
HILLARY CLINTON NOT ONCE BUT

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,980
TWICE, AND SO THIS WAS NOT A
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ISSUE.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,750
WHAT WAS REALLY AN ISSUE
HERE WAS PEOPLE LIKE

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,150
PAPADOPOULOS OPENLY TALKING
ABOUT THEIR TIES TO RUSSIANS

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,159
AND HOW THE RUSSIANS HAD OFFERED
DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON AND

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,119
THAT BASICALLY SPURRED THIS
INFORMANT IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

26
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,750
REPRESENTATIVE LEE ZELDIN, WHO
IS A REPUBLICAN, HELD THIS

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,549
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH OTHER
REPUBLICANS WITH HIM AND HE

28
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,130
IS SAYING LOOK, WE NEED THIS
SECOND SPECIAL

29
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:56,780
COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE FBI
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:06,740
A 
COUPLE OF IRONIC NOTES HERE.

31
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,610
FIRST OF ALL, ALL DEPARTMENTS TO
INVESTIGATE THEMSELVES.

32
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,160
THAT IS WHERE THEY HAVE
INSPECTOR GENERALS, AND

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,650
THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT
FEAR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

34
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,860
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ATTACHED TO
ANYONE ELSE.

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,940
THEY ARE ON A PURPOSE REMOVED
FROM THE REST OF THE STAFF

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,780
BECAUSE IT IS THEIR JOB TO
INVESTIGATE THEM.

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,010
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS USED
THEIR INSPECTOR GENERAL A

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,840
TON OF TIMES, COUNTLESS TIMES
AND ROSENSTEIN HERE SAYING

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,650
OH, YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO
WHETHER IT WAS A LEGITIMATE

40
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,440
WARRANT OR IF IT WAS A POLITICAL
THING?

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
OKAY.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,792
I THINK THAT IS FAIR.

43
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,250
IN FACT, I SAID THAT ON THE
SHOW YESTERDAY WHEN THE NEWS

44
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,250
CAME OUT.

45
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,300
I WAS LIKE YOU WANT TO USE THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL, THAT IS

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,450
WHAT HE IS FOR.

47
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,700
THE IDEA THAT THE DEPARTMENT
CANNOT INVESTIGATE ITSELF

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,090
IS NOT TRUE.

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,320
WHETHER YOU TRUST THAT
INVESTIGATION IS A GOOD QUESTION

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,350
AND IT DEPENDS ON THE DEPARTMENT
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS.

51
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,160
IF YOU SAID DO YOU TRUST THE FBI
TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF DURING THE

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,410
J EDGAR HOOVER HERE I WOULD SAY
NO, I DO NOT.

53
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,410
IF YOU SAID DO

54
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,520
YOU TRUST THE CIA TO INVESTIGATE
ITSELF TODAY?

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,090
I WOULD SAY NO, AND BY THE WAY,
SO WITH THESE REPUBLICANS.

56
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,240
THEY SAID WHEN GINA HASKEL
TORTURED PEOPLE AND DESTROYED

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
THE

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,879
EVIDENCE IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE THE
CIA LOOKED INTO IT AND SAID IT

59
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,879
WAS FINE.

60
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,020
INTERESTING, YOU SEEM
TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD.

61
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,480
THAT KIND OF INTERNAL
INVESTIGATION IS TOTALLY

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,730
FINE WITH THEM.

63
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,690
THE CIA, THAT WE CAN TRUST.

64
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,800
ALTHOUGH NOW, SOME OF THE OTHER
CONSERVATIVES ARE LUMPING THE

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,420
CIA WITH OTHER PEOPLE PLOTTING A
COUP AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.

66
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,069
I CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THEIR
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

67
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,390
IN REALITY, THIS JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT HAS INVESTIGATED

68
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,880
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,
HILLARY CLINTON EXHAUSTIVELY AND

69
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,590
IT IS A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
APPOINTED BY DONALD TRUMP

70
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,220
AND ALL FILLED WITH REPUBLICANS.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,890
I BELIEVE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
CAN HANDLE IT AND IF I THOUGHT

72
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,300
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WAS GOING TO
BE A PERSON THAT THEY APPOINTED

73
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,620
WHO WAS FAIR AND
NONPARTISAN, I DON'T THINK IT

74
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,220
IS WARRANTED IN THIS CASE BUT IT
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

75
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,890
YOU THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
APPOINT A FAIR AND HONEST

76
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,089
SPECIAL COUNSEL?

77
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,610
NO, THEY ARE GOING TO BRING
JUDGE NAPOLITANO

78
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,680
BACK, THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE
HACK OF ALL

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,129
HACKS AND SAY, YEAH, LOOK AT ALL
THIS EVIDENCE WE FOUND ON

80
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,550
THIS INVESTIGATION, SO HELL NO.

81
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,020
IN THIS CASE I TRUST THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL AT

82
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,009
TIMES MORE THAN I TRUST HER
SO-CALLED SPECIAL COUNSEL.

83
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,139
LET'S ALSO TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THAT INFORMANT

84
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,289
BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
WANTED THE IDENTITY OF THAT

85
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,169
INFORMANT AND THE NEW YORK TIMES
AND WASHINGTON POST REFUSED

86
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,759
TO RELEASE THE INDIVIDUAL'S NAME
TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY, TO

87
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,439
PROTECT HIS SAFETY BUT THEY ALSO
GAVE VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS

88
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,559
ABOUT THE MEETINGS HE HAD WITH
PAPADOPOULOS FOR INSTANCE,

89
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:06,150
SO IT WAS INCREDIBLY EASY TO
CONNECT.

90
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,699
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE
DAILY CALLER DID.

91
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,360
THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT
THE INFORMANT WAS A MAN BY

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,369
THE NAME OF STEFAN HELPER.

93
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:16,270
HE IS ACTUALLY A LONGTIME
REPUBLICAN.

94
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,839
HE WORKED IN THE NIXON
ADMINISTRATION.

95
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,979
HE WORKED FOR CARTER AND ALSO
THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION SO

96
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:23,979
THIS IS

97
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:28,089
NOT SOME BERNIE SANDERS
PROGRESSIVE THAT'S TRYING TO

98
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:32,960
INFILTRATE TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND
DESTROY HIM.

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,669
AGAIN, WE DID NOT EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THIS UNTIL NOW.

100
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,819
WE ARE IN 2018,

101
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,740
THIS INVESTIGATION HAPPENED IN
2016 DURING THE ELECTION,

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,210
BEFORE TRUMP WAS EVEN ELECTED.

103
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,020
AND AS WE HAVE EXPLAINED

104
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,319
NOW, THE FBI DID TRUMP A
GIGANTIC FAVOR BY NOT REVEALING

105
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,599
THE INVESTIGATION DURING THE
ELECTION WHEN ON TWO DIFFERENT

106
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:56,339
OCCASIONS THEY DID TALK ABOUT
HILLARY CLINTON'S INVESTIGATION.

107
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,150
THEY WERE DOING BOTH
INVESTIGATIONS OF BOTH

108
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,150
CANDIDATES.

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,090
THEY TALKED ABOUT ONE BUT NOT
THE OTHER AND THAT AFFECTED

110
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,439
THE ELECTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S
SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE.

111
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,050
AND REMEMBER, PAPADOPOULOS IS
THE ONE WHO WAS IN

112
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,599
AUSTRALIA BRAGGING ABOUT THE
COMMUNICATION HE HAD WITH

113
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,340
THE RUSSIANS, SO I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT EXACTLY EVIDENCE THEY

114
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,279
USED TO OBTAIN THE WARRANTS
INTO THIS INVESTIGATION,

115
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,800
BUT YOU SHOULD BE PISSED AT
PAPADOPOULOS WHO WAS

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,569
RUNNING HIS MOUTH ABOUT HIS TIES
TO RUSSIANS.

117
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,080
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANTED
THE FBI TO DO IN THAT CASE

118
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,969
AND PAPADOPOULOS HAPPENED TO BE
IN LONDON ACTUALLY AND HE

119
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,399
WAS TALKING TO THE AUSTRALIAN
AMBASSADOR IN LONDON AND HE

120
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,129
SAYS BY THE WAY, WE ARE WORKING
WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND

121
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:41,680
TRIED TO GET INFORMATION ON
OUR OPPONENT.

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,150
LET'S SAY PAPADOPOULOS WAS
WORKING WITH HILLARY CLINTON.

123
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,770
DO YOU THINK THE FBI, ONCE THEY
FOUND OUT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN

124
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,659
AMBASSADOR WOULD BE LIKE OH,
HILLARY CLINTON IS WORKING WITH

125
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,899
A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO GET
THERE ON DONALD TRUMP THAT

126
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:55,899
IS ILLEGAL.

127
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:56,899
LET'S JUST DROP IT.

128
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,999
NO, THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A
PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT IT.

129
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:02,249
THEY WOULD HAVE, BUT YOU
THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE?

130
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,429
IF THEY KNEW AND THEY GOT
INFORMATION SAYING HILLARY

131
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:08,550
CLINTON'S CAMPAIGN IS WORKING
WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

132
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,919
ONE THAT IS HOSTILE TO US TO
RIG THE ELECTION, DO YOU THINK

133
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,020
THE FBI SHOULD HAVE JUST DROPPED
IT, NOT EVEN INVESTIGATED IT?

134
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,599
OF COURSE NOT.

135
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,050
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
PRINCIPLE.

136
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,069
I KNOW THAT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK
FOR FROM MAGA GUYS.

137
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,629
ONE PART OF THE STORY IS VERY
IMPORTANT.

138
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,369
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS
BEEN PRESSURING MUELLER TO

139
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:34,399
GIVE UP, NOT GIVE UP BUT REVEAL
SOME OF THE EVIDENCE THAT

140
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,259
HE IS WORKING WITH, WHICH IS A
RIDICULOUS REQUEST.

141
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,389
NOW THEY ARE USING THIS
INFORMATION ABOUT THE

142
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,990
INFILTRATOR, THE FBI INFORMANTS
TO REALLY PUSH TO SEE SOME

143
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,349
OF THE EVIDENCE.

144
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:54,590
AS FAR AS I KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT
GIVEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

145
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,449
WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR,
HOWEVER, ROD ROSENSTEIN HAS

146
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:04,599
AGREED TO LOOK INTO THE FBI'S
ACTIONS WITH THIS INFORMANT.

147
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,129
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHO IS HATCHING

148
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:10,199
THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES, I
KNOW AND EXPLAINED IT BUT I

149
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,969
WANT TO REMIND YOU IT IS NOT
SOME RANDOM GUY ON TWITTER OR

150
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,719
GUY WRITING FOR BREITBART.

151
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,479
THESE ARE UNITED STATES
CONGRESSMAN WHO JUST DID A PRESS

152
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,689
CONFERENCE SAYING YEAH, WE
THINK THAT PARTS OF THE

153
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:26,999
GOVERNMENT ARE BASICALLY DOING A
POLITICAL COUP AGAINST THE

154
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,120
PRESIDENT AND HAD ALWAYS PLANNED
TO DO SO.

155
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
WHY?

156
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,349
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT FOR SURE
DONALD TRUMP WOULD WIN AND

157
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,610
HANDS THEY PLANNED THAT AHEAD OF
TIME AND ARE DOING THIS.

158
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,130
THESE ARE LUNATICS, THIS IS NOT
THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, THIS IS

159
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,629
MAYBE FREEDOM FROM THEIR OWN
MINDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST IT.

160
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:47,160
IT IS THE BROWN SHIRT
CONFERENCE.

161
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,620
MARK MEADOWS, MATT GATES,
CLAUDIA TENDING, JODI HEISE

162
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,899
AND OF COURSE IS HELD IN.

163
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,300
THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO ARE
GOING TO BE FIRST UP THAT IF

164
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,529
THERE IS AN IMPEACHMENT EFFORT,
IF TRUMP DID THE CRIMES AND

165
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,440
THEY DEFEAT THAT EFFORTS AND
TRUMP IS STILL IN CHARGE,

166
