thing one tonight when net neutrality which is the idea that Internet service providers should treat all data equally was under threat in 2014 HBO is John Oliver famously made a stand summoning the masses of internet commenters to preserve it the internet reacted and crashed the FCC's website eventually net neutrality was preserved and then in 2017 enter Donald Trump with the brand-new FCC Chairman who drinks from novelty oversized mugs and a new push to end net neutrality and so John Oliver once again summoned internet commenters to take action you cannot say that you are too busy when five hundred and forty thousand of you commented on Beyonce's pregnancy announcement and six hundred and seventy three of you took the time to review the Grand Canyon on Yelp a one-star review what is wrong with you once again the odd recall sometimes was effective the sec site crashed and stopped accepting any comments this time the essays he claimed it was down because of a cyber attack it seems like a strange coincidence but would they really lie about something like that oh yeah they totally would and they did and that's thing too in 60 seconds so in the midst of the big fight about the future of net neutrality last May the FCC claimed the system on their website that allows comments from the public was brought down by a cyberattack now we know that was a flat-out lie the SCC's own Inspector General releasing a report this week finding that the comment system issues were not caused by cyber attack but more likely by a combination of system design issues and a massive surge in legitimate traffic after John Oliver urged viewers to post pro Net Neutrality comments on the site investigators also uncovered that the SEC provided false information to members of Congress regarding advice provided or not provided by the FBI to the FCC after the instance incident FCC Chairman Ajit PI is placing full blame on his former chief information officer and other subordinates which is maybe not that surprising a move from a guy who behaves like this hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
