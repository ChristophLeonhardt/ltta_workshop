00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:04,506
>> GREG PALCOCK, NO BREAKS ON

2
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:05,807
THE WEEKEND.

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:07,342
>> THANKS, LAURA, FOR MORE

4
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,678
GORDON CHANG, ASIA POLICY,

5
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:11,546
AUTHOR OF NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN,

6
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:13,215
NORTH KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD,

7
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,083
GOOD SEE YOU.

8
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,885
A MONTH AGO I HAD GONE TO YOU,

9
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:18,820
THE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA AND

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,088
SOUTH KOREA ARE GOING TO MEET,

11
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,456
THEY ARE GOING TO SHAKE HANDS

12
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:23,258
AND MIGHT HAVE HUGGED, YOU MIGHT

13
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:24,693
HAVE SAID YOU'RE CRAZY, ED, NOW

14
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,795
THEY HAVE DONE IT TWICE.

15
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,697
>> THIS IS AMAZING, THREE

16
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:33,568
INTERKOREAN SUMMITS UP AND YEARS

17
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,203
BETWEEN EACH OTHER AND NOW WE'VE

18
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,405
HAD TWO IN SHORT SUCCESSION.

19
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,975
MOON JAE-IN IS PRONORTH KOREAN,

20
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,643
HE SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH

21
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:42,711
PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT NORTH

22
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:44,446
KOREA TO TAKE OVER THE SOUTH SO

23
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,314
I GET A BIT NERVOUS WHEN I SEE

24
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,383
BOTH KIM AND MOON IN THE SAME

25
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,784
PLACE BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE A

26
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:54,055
NORTH KOREAN AND -- MUCH TOO

27
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:54,422
COZY.

28
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:55,890
>> WHAT DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP DO

29
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,826
TO MAKE SURE WE ARE NOT TOO COZY

30
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:00,195
AND THE UNITED STATES GETS A

31
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:01,429
GOOD DEAL?

32
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,931
DEMOCRATS LIKE NANCY PELOSI, THE

33
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:06,668
PRESIDENT SENT THIS LETTER, IT

34
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:09,638
WAS ALL -- TICKLY WITH KIM JONG

35
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,673
UN, ALL OF THE OVERDONE RHETORIC

36
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,508
AND THEY SAID HE'S BLOWN THE

37
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,377
SUMMIT AND HERE WE ARE, ACTUALLY

38
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:17,679
KIM JONG UN SEEMED TO BE ON

39
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:19,681
BENDED KNEE, HE DESPERATELY

40
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,682
WANTS TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT

41
00:01:20,682 --> 00:01:21,716
TRUMP AND MAYBE PRESIDENT TRUMP

42
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,618
PLAYED IT JUST RIGHT?

43
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:24,586
>> FASCINATING, THURSDAY IN THE

44
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:25,487
MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP

45
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:29,224
WITHDRAWSDRAWS FROM THE SUMMIT,

46
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:30,025
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WITHIN AN

47
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,427
HOUR OR SO, YOU HAVE THE NORTH

48
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:36,264
KOREANS ISSUE A STRING OF

49
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:37,265
MESSAGES, SAYING THAT THEY WOULD

50
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,501
BE WILLING TO GO FOR THE TRUMP

51
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,269
FACTOR QUOTE, UNQUOTE.

52
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,771
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING.

53
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,173
WE HAVE NOW FOUND THE KEY TO

54
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:48,710
DEALING WITH THE NORTH KOREANS

55
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,644
AND --

56
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,446
>> THAT'S BASICALLY THE THREAT

57
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:52,814
OF FORCE AND ALSO THE SANCTIONS

58
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,184
TO CUT THE MONEY TO NORTH KOREA

59
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,218
AND WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT'S

60
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,220
AS GOOD AS HIS WORDS.

61
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,923
LOOK, I'M WILLING TO WALK AWAY.

62
00:02:01,923 --> 00:02:03,658
>> HE DID THAT WITH THE LETTER

63
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,527
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAD THE AT

64
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:07,329
THE TIME, YOU GO BACK TO WHAT

65
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,363
THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING, THIS IS

66
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:09,898
WILL BE THE END TO HAVE PEACE

67
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:11,499
PROCESS, THIS IS GOING TO BE

68
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:15,337
THERMAL NUCLEAR WAR, WELL, NO IT

69
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:15,770
WASN'T.

70
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,805
KIM CAVED IMMEDIATELY.

71
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:18,740
THAT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.

72
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,211
>> LAST HOUR WE HAD A DEMOCRAT

73
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,747
BILL RICHARDSON ON OUR AIR, YOU

74
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:26,981
REACTED SHARPLY, I WANT TO PLAY

75
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,183
SOME OF IT.

76
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:30,085
>> I WISH IT NOT HAPPENED

77
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,286
JUNE 12TH, BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO

78
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,721
PREPARATION, WE NEED TO FIND

79
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:36,891
WAYS TO HAVE OUR MESSAGE BY ONE

80
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:37,459
PERSON.

81
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,194
I THINK THAT'S SECRETARY POMPEO,

82
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,662
OBJECTIVE, A STRATEGY, I THINK

83
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,630
WE ARE STILL NOT COMFORTABLE

84
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,800
WITH THE STRATEGY WE HAVE ON

85
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,368
DENUCLEARIZATION.

86
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,770
>> A VETERAN DIPLOMAT, DID A LOT

87
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,305
OF GOOD, AMBASSADOR TO UN AND

88
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:52,507
WHAT NOT, AS YOU AND I WERE

89
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:54,209
TALKING, HE AND OTHERS BOTH

90
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:55,477
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,

91
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:56,010
ADMINISTRATION AFTER

92
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,078
ADMINISTRATION DID THE SAME

93
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,279
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

94
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,681
YET THIS PRESIDENT IS TRYING

95
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,448
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND APPEARS

96
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:02,517
TO BE WORKING.

97
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:03,151
>> CERTAINLY.

98
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:04,152
RICHARDSON TALKS ABOUT

99
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,120
PREPARATION, I CAN SORT OF

100
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,987
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT ON THE OTHER

101
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,589
HAND WE'VE HAD LITTLE

102
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:09,891
PREPARATION AND WE'VE THE NORTH

103
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:11,593
KOREANS MAKE IMPORTANT

104
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:12,861
CONCESSIONS, THEY RELEASED THREE

105
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,696
AMERICANS AND MADE PUBLIC

106
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:19,434
COMMITMENTS TO DENUCLEARIZING

107
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:22,437
AND WE HEARD IN SUMMIT WHEN MOON

108
00:03:22,437 --> 00:03:24,439
SAID KIM WAS WILLING TO GET RID

109
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:27,842
OF NUKES, KIM IS BEING CYNICAL.

110
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,477
THE OTHER THING THAT RICHARDSON

111
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,312
SAID IN THE INTERVIEW I THINK IS

112
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,480
CRITICAL, HE SAID, LOOK, THE

113
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,282
UNITED STATES AS IT PREPARES

114
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:36,885
NEEDS TO WEAVE IN CHINA AND

115
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,754
SOUTH KOREA, WELL, CHINA HAS

116
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,223
BEEN A MALIGN FACTOR, BUSTING

117
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,425
SANCTIONS OPENLY.

118
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:44,526
IT'S ENCOURAGING KIM TO BACK

119
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:47,128
AWAY FROM THE U.S., SO THE LAST

120
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,630
THING IN THE WORLD, ED, WE NEED

121
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,799
TO GET THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE

122
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,600
CHINESE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

123
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,236
WE NEED THE CHINESE OFF TO THE

124
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:55,603
SIDE.

125
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,639
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" STORY,

126
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,373
THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY TWEETED

127
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,974
IT WAS FAKE NEWS, DON'T BELIEVE

128
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:01,676
IT, THE JEST OF IT, THERE'S A

129
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,611
SPLIT ON THE ADMINISTRATION THEY

130
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,679
CLAIM WHERE HARD-LINERS LIKE

131
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,381
JOHN BOLTON, THERE HAS TO BE

132
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,248
DENUCLEARIZATION BEFORE YOU COME

133
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,617
TO THE TABLE WHERE THERE ARE

134
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,753
OTHERS LIKE SECRETARY MATTIS IN

135
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,521
PENTAGON, JUNE 129, WHATEVER DAY

136
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,056
IT IS, SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING

137
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,658
OF TALKS AND DENUCLEARIZATION

138
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:20,228
COULD HAPPEN IN MONTHS OR YEARS?

139
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:22,063
>> WE SHOULD DO IT AS QUICKLY AS

140
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:22,430
POSSIBLE.

141
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:26,935
IN THE PAST WE HAD THE FAZED

142
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,136
ATTEMPT AND DIDN'T WORK FOR A

143
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,338
NUMBER OF REASONS.  RIGHT NOW

144
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,940
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN LOOK AT THE

145
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,174
TABLE, KIM, YOU'RE GIVING THEM

146
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,143
UP BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T I WILL

147
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,045
START SANCTIONING YOU, NORTH

148
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,279
KOREA, I'M GOING TO START

149
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:42,250
SANCTIONING CHINA FOR MONEY

150
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,318
LAUNDERING AND I WILL GET THE

151
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:46,187
RUSSIANS OUT OF THE PICTURE AND

152
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:47,789
ISOLATE AND THAT'S A VERY

153
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:48,556
IMPORTANT NOW.

154
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:49,591
>> THE SOONER THE BETTER.

155
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:52,327
>> WE HAVE RICHARDSON SAYING,

156
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:53,228
LOOK, COMPLETELY

157
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,229
DENUCLEARIZATION IS NOT

158
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:55,697
POSSIBLE, THAT'S NOT YOUR

159
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:56,798
OPENING BARGAINING POSITION AND

160
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,299
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE

161
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,667
STRIVING FOR AND THE PRESIDENT

162
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,069
SAID CLEARLY, THESE GUYS ARE

163
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,138
GIVING UP ALL NUKES, THAT'S GOT

164
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,039
TO BE OUR POSITION.

165
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,541
NOT ONLY WHAT WE SAY IN PUBLIC

166
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,943
BUT WE REALLY MEAN.

167
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:10,712
>> I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN

168
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:13,548
SINGAPORE DO I GET A

169
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:14,182
NONREFUNDABLE TICKET?

170
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,016
>> NONREFUNDABLE TICKET.

171
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,251
>> YOU THINK IT'S HAPPENING?

172
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,519
>> LOOK, EVEN IF IT WASN'T

173
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,687
HAPPEN ON JUNE 129, IT'LL HAPPEN

174
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,489
SOON, THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TOO

175
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,490
MUCH FROM THE UNITED STATES

176
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,026
RIGHT NOW AND WE SHOULD STRIKE

177
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,361
WHILE THE IRON IS HOT.

178
00:05:26,361 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY, NOT
