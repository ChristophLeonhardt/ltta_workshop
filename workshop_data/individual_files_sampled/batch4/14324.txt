the left is hysterical the left is inconsolable his Donald Trump insulted drum roll ms-13 the left is beside itself people like Andrea Mitchell Jennifer Rubin the alleged Republican representative Eric's wawel these people are inconsolable they're basically throwing temper tantrums here on social media I've got some screens in front of me because Donald Trump had the audacity to insult ms-13 gang members and call them animals now I personally prefer savages but animals will work I have dogs I have horses they're wonderful creatures loving they they made my dogs just sit on my lap at night when I watch television and fall asleep they're absolutely adorable and my horses well if you're out there at the fence I'll just walk over to you and rub your face against theirs and they're great what animals fits in context again I like savages brutal savages disgusting savages that's what I miss 1330 Nez but people like Andrea Mitchell and Jennifer Rubin and beside themselves because they're trying to bring this thing out of context let me tell you how the mainstream media is reporting on this in just a moment but let's talk about ms-13 really quick I told you about ms-13 on the show if you're not familiar with them as thirty nine most people are but if you're not it stands from Mara Salvatrucha 13 they're a Salvadoran gang that really galvanize became cohesive here in the United States in the southern states around Southern California they got their start as Salvadoran military escorting drug shipments up through Mexico for the cartels now cartels are brutal people in and of themselves they're sicarios do things like behead you and castrate men who are rival drug dealers they rape women and mutilate them these are brutal people you've seen the imagery from Mexico the headless corpses hanging from highway overpasses and people being warned off if they remove those they cut them down they're gonna be killed Lisa of Mexico very corrupt military very corrupt because the cartels have infiltrated using in from groups like ms-13 the threatened law enforcement in the military either come onto the payroll or turn a blind eye these are very very brutal people so here in this states they've been amping up their criminal activity raping and murdering trafficking and young girls they're there they're really gang members just to be gang members often times they're not even major players in the drug game in certain areas it's just about the brutality and that sense of evil family but better than enough for the American Left they're absolutely absolutely beside themselves saying that Donald Trump wasn't really talking about ms-13 but that he was he was talking about illegal immigrants Vox prompt on deported immigrants they're not people they're animals than right underneath whether President Trump was referring to ms-13 gang members or all the parties is unclear but he didn't exactly hasten to clarify I'm gonna read your Trump's full statement in just a moment the New York Times knew that Trump meant ms-13 but they couldn't bring themselves to admit it though the Trump via the nut near Times headline is romp calls some unauthorized immigrants animals in a rat now first of all unauthorized immigrants no illegal aliens New York Times and they the New York Times considers murdering raping mutilating ms-13 um that's how they describe ms-13 um Americans the ones you know what the face tattoos really really bad guys who rape young girls and murder them the ms-13 is a particularly brutal gang they prefer not to use firearms when they killed machetes and baseball bats are their weapons of choice so our small knives razor blades box cutters things like that why not because they can't get access to guns because it hurts more because it's more brutal it's more torturous for the victims that's what ms-13 is and that's what the American Left wants to inflict on use it this Vox story is it's great and this was all from the round table from held a roundtable on sanctuary cities in California with the sheriff of Fresno County sheriff Mims and several others sheriff Mims said and this is from the White House transcript now ice is the only law enforcement agency that cannot use our databases to find the bad guy sheriff mims be very tough on immigration they cannot come in and talk to people in our jail unless they reach a certain threshold they can't do all kinds of things that other law enforcement agencies can do and it's put us in a really bad position in a very bad position now what she's talking about but sheriff Mims is talking about is that federal cooperation cooperation between her agency the Fresno County Sheriff's Office Fresno PD other other law enforcement agencies local and state law enforcement agencies in California cooperating with their federal partners but when she says now ice is the only law enforcement agency that use our databases what she's saying is that the FBI can come in and use them the ATF can come in and use them on a gun case the DEA can come in and use them on a drug case other various law enforcement agencies Treasury agents could come in and use them if they need to find somebody out of financial crime IRS agents if they need to find somebody in a tax evasion case all of the federal law enforcement agencies out there have those cooperative compacts but because of California's far-left ISM ice Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot it is simply ludicrous now Homeland Security Investigations over the Department of Homeland Security can they handle what US Customs used to they work closely with agencies like ice and DEA interdicting contraband coming into the US but if that contraband is an illegal person then it's a no-go it's ridiculous and the president responded by saying quote it's a decree it's a disgrace okay it's a disgrace and sheriff mims said it is a disgrace president said we're suing on that we're working hard and I think it will all come together because people wanted to come together it's so ridiculous the concept that we've been talking about this is ridiculous we'll take care of it Margaret will win Margaret Simms being the sheriff and then the sheriff said to the president thank you there could be an ms-13 member I know about if they don't reach a certain threshold meaning commit a certain level of crime I cannot tell ice about it sheriff says ms-13 president then responds to the sheriff's comment specifically on ms-13 and says who sheriff mims and to the American people oddly a rant president says quote President Trump we have people coming into the country or trying to come in and we're stopping a lot of them or taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people are these aren't people these are animals and we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before them because of the weak laws they come in fast we get them we release them we get them again you bring them out it's crazy he is clearly clearly anyone with a modicum of common sense in see that the president is talking specifically about ms-13 gang members in response the Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Simms staying I'm sorry Margaret Mims saying ms-13 is a problem I can't even report them to ice and the president immediately responding to her but looking at the camera talking to the American people the left is so disingenuous they're so disgraceful and I often say the left hates you they want you dead and people on the left say to me you're crazy you're crazy think about this am i crazy in the span of three days the left is now spent the majority of their time vast majority of their time defending Hamas terrorists trying to invade Israel an ms-13
