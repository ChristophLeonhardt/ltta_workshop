Are those my shorts?
>> Shannon: AS WE ARE STILL
WATCHING RESULTS ROLL IN FROM
CALIFORNIA, THE RACE IS STILL
TOO CLOSE TO CALL FOR GOVERNOR.
LET'S HEAD BACK THERE NOW I TALK
TO JOHN COX OF A REPUBLICAN
CONTINENT GOVERNOR.
HE'S HOPING TO MAKE IT INTO THE
FALL.
THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IN
CALIFORNIA, THE TOP TWO,
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, AND UP
THERE.
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN
NEWSOM, AN EASY RUN OF THE TOP
SPOT.
BUT MR. COX, MAY BE THE NUMBER
TWO.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TONIGHT,
SIR?
>> I'M DOING GREAT.
I LIKE THE EARLY RETURNS AND I'M
EAGER TO GET INTO THE BATTLE.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO REDO
SOMETHING FROM THE "L.A. TIMES,"
"IN LEFT-LEANING CALIFORNIA,
NEWSOM IS LIKELY TO BREEZE TO
VICTORY IN A NOVEMBER FACE-OFF
AGAINST COX, WHO HAS HITCHED HIS
CAMPAIGN TO THE FAR RIGHT
POLICIES OF THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION."
THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?
>> THESE ARE THE SAME EXPERTS
WHO SAID THAT I WASN'T GOING TO
BE IN THE TOP TWO.
IT WAS GOING TO BE VILLARAIGOSA
AND NEWSOM AND THE TOP TWO.
THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT AND
THEY ARE WRONG ABOUT THE EFFORTS
THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IN
NOVEMBER.
THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE HAVE
BEEN BEATEN INTO SUBMISSION BY
THE DEMOCRATS.
THIS ESTATE IS THE NUMBER ONE
STATE OR PROPERTY, IT IS NOT IS
UNAFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE, IT
IS THE HIGHEST TAXED STATE IN
THE COUNTRY.
THE DEMOCRATS AND GAVIN NEWSOM
HAVE MISMANAGED THE SCHOOLS,
MISMANAGED THE ROADS, THEY HAVE
SPENT MONEY LIKE CRAZY, AND THEY
KEEP DIGGING THEIR HANDS INTO
PEOPLE'S POCKETS.
GAVIN NEWSOM HAS SAID HIMSELF
HE'S GOING TO DOUBLE THE STATE
INCOME TAX, HE IS GOING TO RAISE
PROPERTY TAX, AND HE'S GOING TO
FIGHT TO REPEAL THE GAS TAX.
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS
ESTATE HAVE BEEN TAXED ENOUGH.
THEY KNOW THE STATE IS
UNAFFORDABLE, SHANNON.
THEY WANT A CHANGE, THEY WANT TO
HAVE A STATE WHERE THEY CAN
ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY FOR THEIR
RETIREMENT OR FOR THEIR KIDS
EDUCATION.
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE
TO THEM.
>> Shannon: WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THIS BEFORE.
THE POLLING SHOWS WHERE THEY ARE
ON A SHEET OF SANCTUARY CITIES
AND TAXES AND ALL KINDS OF
THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE, AND YET
THEY KEEP VOTING FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.
HOW DO YOU UNDO THAT
FORMULATION?
IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
A LOCK ON THE STATE THERE.
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE
UNHAPPY ABOUT THE POLICY
DECISIONS THEY MAKE.
>> THEY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO
VOTE ON AN ALTERNATIVE YET,
SHANNON.
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.
I'VE GOTTEN RESULTS OVER 40
YEARS IN BUSINESS.
I'VE HAD A MEEK BUDGET.
GAVIN NEWSOM LEFT SAN FRANCISCO
WITH AN UNBELIEVABLE UNFUNDED
PENSION DEBT, HOMELESS PEOPLE IN
THE STREETS, TREMENDOUS HOUSING
PRICES THAT PRICE EVERYBODY OUT
OF THE MARKET, 46% OF PEOPLE IN
THE BAY AREA SAID THEY WANTED TO
LEAVE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK GAVIN
NEWSOM DESERVES A PROMOTION, AND
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS
STATE, GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF
SOMEBODY LIKE ME, WHO'S ACTUALLY
GOING TO DELIVER RESULTS FOR
THEM, I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
VOTE FOR ME AND THEY WILL CHANGE
>> Shannon: I WANT TO READ
SOMETHING ELSE COMING IN FROM
ROLLING STONE.
"IF COX MAKES HIS WAY UP TO THE
BALLOT, IT WILL INCENTIVIZE
CONSERVATIVES TO HEAD TO THE
POLLS IN NOVEMBER, EVEN MORE SO
IF TROUBLE CONTINUES TO TREAT
HIS SUPPORT FOR THE REPUBLICAN
BUSINESSMAN.
THOSE CONSERVATIVES WILL VOTE
FOR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL
CANDIDATES, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEMOCRATS
TO ENACT THE SEATS THEY NEED TO
TURN THE HOUSE BLEW."
HOW CRITICAL OUTSIDE OF THE
GOVERNOR'S RACE IS IT FOR YOU TO
MAKE IT ONTO THE BALLOT BECAUSE
OF THE OTHER CRITICAL HOUSE
RACES OUT THERE?
>> I THINK IT IS CRITICAL TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A BETTER
AGENDA IN WASHINGTON.
WE'VE GOT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE
OBAMACARE, WE'VE GOT TO BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT MEANS WE
HAVE TO HOLD THE HOUSE, GOT TO
CUT THE MASSIVE SPENDING, GOT TO
DEAL WITH A $21 TRILLION DEBT.
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO
THAT IS BY GROWING THE ECONOMY.
THAT IS WHAT I PLANNED TO DO IN
CALIFORNIA, SHANNON.
WE'VE GOT A $1 TRILLION UNFUNDED
PENSION DEBT.
WE'VE GOT TO GROW THIS ECONOMY.
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT
BUSINESSES STOP LEAVING THIS
STATE.
WE'VE LOST 9,000 BUSINESSES IN
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.
I AM A SMALL BUSINESSMAN.
I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE ALL
ACROSS THE STATE, AND THEY TELL
ME THAT THEY WOULD MOVE THEIR
BUSINESS IF THEY COULD.
BUT THEY CAN'T.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THEY WILL LATCH ONTO MY
CAMPAIGN.
THEY WILL SAY, THIS IS OUR LAST
CHANCE TO TURN AROUND THIS
ESTATE BEFORE THE DEMOCRATS AND
GAVIN NEWSOM RUIN EDGE.
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE MORE THING,
SHANNON.
19 STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY
HAVE BUSINESSMEN AS GOVERNORS.
INCLUDING BLUE STATES, LIKE
MARYLAND, MICHIGAN,
MASSACHUSETTS.
THOSE GOVERNORS GET RESULTS.
