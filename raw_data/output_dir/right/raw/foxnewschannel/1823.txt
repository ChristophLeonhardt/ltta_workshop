1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,917
THAT TOO.

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:04,652
>>LELAND: ALISO FAR THEY DON'T

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,154
BUT WE WILL SEE IF YOU AND YOUR

4
00:00:06,154 --> 00:00:07,655
COLLEAGUES CAN CONVINCE THEM.

5
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:08,389
CONGRESSMAN, I APPRECIATE YOU

6
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:08,790
BEING HERE.

7
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,062
>>ELIZABETH: PRESIDENT TRUMP

8
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:15,029
BOWING TO BRING DOWN

9
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:15,864
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES ON

10
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:16,197
FRIDAY.

11
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:17,432
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OPENLY

12
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:18,333
CRITICAL ABOUT HIGH DRUG PRICES

13
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,534
IN THE PAST BUT HIS SPEECH

14
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:22,937
FRIDAY FOCUSED LESS ON HIS

15
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:24,239
POPULIST MESSAGE AND MORE ON

16
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:25,106
WORKING TO FIX THE PROBLEM

17
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:26,007
WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

18
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:26,608
INDUSTRY ITSELF.

19
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:27,442
LET'S BRING IN OUR FAIR AND

20
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:30,245
BALANCED POLITICAL PANEL.

21
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,045
- - IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE

22
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:33,815
GREAT AMERICA PACK

23
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:34,082
GREAT AMERICA PACK.

24
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:34,816
GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR

25
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:43,391
JOINING ME.

26
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,726
ERIC, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.

27
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:45,360
SUCCESS OR NOT A SUCCESS.

28
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,394
WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE REACTION

29
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:47,162
FROM SOME OF THESE DRUG

30
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:48,429
COMPANIES, THEY ARE NOT REALLY

31
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:49,664
UP IN ARMS SO I'M WONDERING IF

32
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,465
THIS IS A SUCCESS HERE.

33
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:57,539
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO GIVE THE

34
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,373
PRESIDENT A GREAT AMOUNT OF

35
00:00:58,373 --> 00:00:59,507
RESPECT FOR TACKLING AN ISSUE

36
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:00,475
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT THE BEST

37
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:04,779
STRATEGY FOR REPUBLICANS.

38
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,647
HE REALLY JUST LET THE HEALTH

39
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,414
INDUSTRY DIE AND GO AWAY.

40
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,782
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS LOWER

41
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:14,722
THE DRUG PRICES FOR SENIORS.

42
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:15,490
HE WANTS TO MAKE OTHER

43
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,791
COUNTRIES PAY MORE.

44
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:17,525
ALSO, WE HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST

45
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:18,159
DRUG COST IN THE ENTIRE

46
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,493
COUNTRY.

47
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:19,194
I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS

48
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:20,094
HE CAMPAIGNED ON THAT HE WISHES

49
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:21,996
TO DELIVER BUT I THINK HE

50
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:22,864
REALIZES HE NEEDS TO WORK WITH

51
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:23,998
- - TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES

52
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:24,566
OCCUR.

53
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,233
HE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE HE'S

54
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,067
ATTACKING THIS PROBLEM INSIDE

55
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:26,734
OUT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

56
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,135
HE'S DOING.

57
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:29,637
>>ELIZABETH: DAVID, I WANT TO

58
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:30,538
GET YOUR TAKE ON IT.

59
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:31,639
ONE THING ERIC SAID WAS TO LET

60
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:32,073
IT DIE.

61
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:33,074
WITH THAT BEHOOVE, WHO?

62
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:37,412
>> I THINK YESTERDAY'S

63
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:38,313
ANNOUNCEMENT IS PRETTY SIMPLE

64
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,149
IN TERMS OF WHO BENEFITS.

65
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,450
IT BENEFITS PHARMACEUTICAL

66
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,418
COMPANIES AT THE EXTENSIVE

67
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:43,751
SENIORS.

68
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:47,722
PRESIDENTS SAID CLEARLY HE

69
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:49,490
WANTED MEDICARE TO BE ALLOWED

70
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,225
TO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THE

71
00:01:50,225 --> 00:02:00,768
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

72
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:01,469
YESTERDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT, NOT

73
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:02,570
ONLY DID HE NOT ANNOUNCE THAT

74
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,338
BUT IT WAS A BETRAYAL OF THAT

75
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:03,671
PROMISE.

76
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:04,739
HE BROKE FAITH WITH AMERICANS

77
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:05,073
SENIORS.

78
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:05,773
>>ELIZABETH: ERICA WANT YOUR

79
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:06,975
REACTION AND THEN WE WILL MOVE

80
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:07,242
ON.

81
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:16,651
>> I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT

82
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,752
IS TRYING TO DO IS HE'S TRYING

83
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:18,620
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK ON

84
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,054
REAL REFORMS THAT HE CAMPAIGNED

85
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:20,321
ON.

86
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:21,356
WE TRIED TO DO IT THE

87
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:22,123
CONGRESSIONAL BODY.

88
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:23,024
HOPEFULLY THIS IS SOMETHING

89
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,525
BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS

90
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,260
CAN GET BEHIND.

91
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,394
>>ELIZABETH: I WANT TO TAKE

92
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:27,929
MORE OF A MACRO VIEW TO TAKE A

93
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:28,630
LOOK AT SOME OF THE MOVES THE

94
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,163
PRESIDENT HAS MADE.

95
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:29,998
HE'S BEEN REMARKABLY CONSISTENT

96
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:31,666
ON ATTEMPTING AT LEAST ALL OF

97
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:37,238
HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

98
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:38,106
FROM OBAMACARE, ROLLING BACK

99
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:38,740
THE MANDATE.

100
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,207
BUILDING A WALL.

101
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,241
NOT GETTING EVERYTHING HE

102
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:47,615
WANTED.

103
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:48,483
REDUCING IMMIGRATION FROM

104
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:49,284
TERROR PRONE COUNTRIES.

105
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:50,118
YOU CAN'T FAULT HIM FOR

106
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:50,885
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE

107
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,120
PROMISES HE MADE POINT I AM

108
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,920
CURIOUS AS TO YOUR TAKE 18

109
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,621
MONTHS INTO THIS

110
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:56,024
ADMINISTRATION.

111
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:56,824
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

112
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:57,692
CRITICAL OF THAT BUT HE'S BEEN

113
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,027
FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THESE

114
00:02:59,027 --> 00:02:59,394
PROMISES.

115
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:00,128
>> THANKS FOR LEADING WITH THE

116
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,964
BIG REVEAL THERE.

117
00:03:02,964 --> 00:03:03,798
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE TALKS

118
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:05,333
A BIG GAME AND THEN EFFECTIVE

119
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:15,143
GAME.

120
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,411
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HIS OWN BEST

121
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:16,778
MESSENGER.

122
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:17,578
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T UNDERSTAND

123
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,279
THE MESSAGING.

124
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,047
TAKING A STEP BACK.

125
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,381
I THINK THE CORE PROMISE OF HIS

126
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:21,215
CAMPAIGN TO PEOPLE WHO VOTED

127
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:23,151
FOR HIM WAS THAT HE WAS GOING

128
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:24,319
TO LOOK OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY.

129
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,553
THE PERSON WHO FELT LEFT BEHIND

130
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:26,120
BY CHANGING ECONOMY.

131
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,489
I HAVE TO ASK FOR VOTERS THAT

132
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,424
VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW

133
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:30,325
DO YOU FEEL WHEN THE TAX CUT HE

134
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:33,094
PUSHED THROUGH,

135
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,595
DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFITS THE

136
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:35,263
RICHEST ONE PERCENT OF THE

137
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,597
COUNTRY AT YOUR EXPENSE?

138
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:37,365
YOU MENTIONED THE WALL POINT HE

139
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:38,800
SAYS REPEATEDLY, MEXICO IS

140
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,735
GOING TO PAY FOR THIS WALL.

141
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,804
HE HAD A CHANCE TO FUND THE

142
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:52,880
WALL

143
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:54,015
HE HAD A CHANCE TO FUND THE
WALL IN THE PACKAGE HE PUSHED

144
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:54,882
THROUGH.

145
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:55,717
YET, HE REFUSED TO FUND THE

146
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:56,017
WALL.

147
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:56,384
HE FAILED.

148
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:57,251
THERE IS NO FUNDING FOR THE

149
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,519
WALL AND MEXICO WILL NOT PAY.

150
00:03:58,519 --> 00:03:59,253
I THINK WHILE HE TALKS A GOOD

151
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:00,221
GAME, THERE'S A CONSISTENT

152
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,122
PATTERN OF THOUGHT OF SAYING

153
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:01,923
ONE THING AND FAILING TO

154
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:02,490
DELIVER.

155
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,791
>>ELIZABETH: YOU HAVE TWO

156
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,392
PLACES YOU CAN RESPOND.

157
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:04,926
>> RESULTS MATTER.

158
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:05,927
THIS PRESIDENT HAS HAD ENORMOUS

159
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:11,099
AND GREAT RESULTS.

160
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,033
HE'S DECLINED THE REGULATIONS

161
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,334
THAT HAVE BEEN HAMPERING SMALL

162
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:14,035
BUSINESSES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

163
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:17,338
TARIFF TAX WASN'T VERY POPULAR.

164
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:28,549
BUT THE MARKET - - I THINK WHEN

165
00:04:28,549 --> 00:04:29,617
HE LOOKS AT AMERICA FIRST

166
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:30,218
POLICIES BE JUST LIKE

167
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:31,319
HEALTHCARE FROM YESTERDAY, THE

168
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,053
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

169
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:32,954
HE'S NOT AFRAID TO TACKLE

170
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:33,888
PROBLEMS HE TALKED ABOUT DURING

171
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:34,489
THE CAMPAIGN.

172
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:35,356
HE DOESN'T CARE IF IT'S BEST

173
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:43,297
FOR REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS.

174
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,832
HE WAS THERE TO BRING ON REAL

175
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:45,466
REFORMS AND YOU'VE GOT TO

176
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,167
RESPECT HIM IN TERMS OF HIS

177
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,068
AGENDA AND WHAT HE'S DOING.

178
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:47,969
LASTLY, YOU TALK ABOUT BUILDING

179
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:48,302
A WALL.

180
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:49,637
THIS IS A PRESIDENT, WE HAVE

181
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:50,405
THINGS IN THE COURT RIGHT NOW

182
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,339
TALKING ABOUT IMMIGRATION IN

183
00:04:51,339 --> 00:00:00,000
TERMS OF OBAMA'S EXECUTIVE
