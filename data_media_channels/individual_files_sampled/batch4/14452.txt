do you believe six million Jews died in World War two but how did they die who killed them who killed them how did they die I think it's some of the Jewish leaders who were in Israel today they are the one who killed them I'm standing outside Centennial Hall in London Ontario which is a concert venue owned by the city now in a couple of hours Mohammad Asif the Arab Idol winner will be taking to the stage to give a concert and that's of concern to some people for example Assaf heat romanticizes the killing of Jews he also doesn't believe that woman including his own sister should have the right to sing in public and one of the first people he met when he touched down in Canada was a notorious Holocaust denier and a supporter of terrorism yet London is the same city that denied a permit recently to a group of people that wanted to protest motion 103 well I'm hoping to do with three things today folks one is is to find out what Londoners think about Mohammad Asif the other is to create some awareness with our billboard on a truck that will be roaming down the streets of London showing the viewpoints of mr. Asif and third I want to deliver this petition here containing thousands of names of Canadians who say they do not stand for the odious viewpoints of this most hateful Idol well a big shout out to all you are rebel viewers you came through with the necessary funding for this fantastic billboard truck that's going to be driving up and down the streets of London Ontario informing people exactly what Assaf stands for you know London City Hall maybe they can deny permits two groups of peaceful protesters when it comes to m103 but they don't own the roads well not yet at least so we are literally taking our message on the road and as you can see well mr. Asif record sadly it speaks for itself I'm trying to deliver this petition folks and the security-guard won't let me and he's shooing me away just wondering is there someone at the hall I'm here to deliver a petition we've had over 3,000 Canadians sign our hateful Idol petition and okay well why are all these other people up here okay they're here for the show I'm not you should know that if you're a security guard I guess just one thing we're just curious about is the so we can't talk to these people that we're being chewed off the property folks is this down here Oh further down before I leave sir can I deliver this petition to somebody at Centennial Hall that's what I'm here for security guard in the black polo said that we couldn't even stand in the roundabout area so we're sort of being separated from the very people we wanted to speak to but I guess that's the way they roll in London Ontario when it comes to exposing some of the truly hateful people that come to town so what do you think of Mohammed Asaf he's a good man everybody loved him he loved he's a peaceful and he loved the children he supports the people of Palestine to make peace and he's a good guy what about some of his views I mean he seems to romanticize those who kill Jews he met with a Holocaust denier in Canada he says that woman even his sister shouldn't be able to sing in public do these values concern you yes it concerns me but I think this is just the media here don't say that I don't believe that Muhammad a sir is a good good guy yeah you know some people find it problematic that he romanticizes the killing of Jews he's against the idea of woman including his own sister singing in public he met with a Holocaust denier but when it came to Canada is this of concern to you sir no cuz I've never heard him say that in my life these are some of his own Facebook postings sir conspiracy I guess assuming all this is factual it is this a concern in terms of supporting this individual as an artist really are Muhammad s our spokesman following is give you the opportunity what what if I said that's a lie sir I'm in London Ontario right now I guess I'm lying about that what makes you love them even though some of the language he uses I mean glorifies terrorism and makes martyrs out of those who stabbed Jews I mean honestly because Jewish is bad people they hurt everybody nobody see the truth really Julie the Jews hurt everybody okay what do you mean by that exactly they come to the people they kill kids they kill everybody over this so the Jews are solely to blame for the conflict there yes absolutely I guess when the staff sings of them this way they deserve it his country is occupied by Israel well what's called Israel and that's why he fights against Israel just like we all do do you have a problem with him advocating violence against Jews because of this issue it's not advocating violence against Jewish in the world he's advocating violence against the occupier that's okay you or Christians or whatever they are if you occupy a country then yes that is okay because you have the right to fight those occupier and get your country back as an azalea Copiah killing Palestinian people killing children that they haven't even saw the light okay and this is okay with you guys but it's not okay but we if do you think that he's hurting that your cause that when he comes to Canada one of the first meetings he has is with a notorious Holocaust denier someone who called the Holocaust a fairy tale I mean why would and do you have any issue with people saying whatever they wants to say as in this a free country was a Holocaust of fairy tale sir well do you I'm asking you let me ask you that's a very direct question sir know why it either is or it isn't do you believe six million Jews died in World War two but how did they die who killed them who killed them how did they die I think it's some of the Jewish leaders who were in Israel today they are the one who killed them they killed them because they refused to go leave Germany to go to his to Israel to occupy Palestine this is astonishing I've never heard of a theory like that you you don't think it you don't think it's Nazi Germany that killed Jews and death camps when you don't know history properly everybody has a view you didn't see it I didn't see it we're just hearing it we're hearing from this side we're hearing from that side it's up to us at the end if there was a massacre for Jewish and I think there was then we shouldn't have a massacre for Palestinians what do you think of a group Hamas for example I don't care about Hamas I don't isn't that very relevant I don't care I care about the people man what do you think of the fact that speaking of barriers that he thinks that woman including his own sister should not be allowed to sing in public how do you feel about that as a woman um honestly being a Muslim myself want to protect our mothers want to protect our sisters and I was thinking in public would bring danger to them well there's a lot of Muslim and Arab woman that do sing in public and there is nothing wrong with that but agree but he thinks there's something wrong with that well as a brother as well he's trying to protect his sister like for example you know there could be if you have a piece of jewelry and diamond or some piece of gold you don't put it out in the public and say you know what let everyone see it and seal it you have to keep it you know in a case protected you know in a safe kind of thing because it's such a it's a remarkable piece of jewelry so in a way he's doing the same thing if someone were to take her jewelry shouldn't we penalize the person who is taking it the thief or in this case someone who's harassing a woman singing in public isn't that what we should be doing we send my Palestine and a free Palestine and we don't care what people say thank you well folks we've been thrilled with trespass if we go on to Centennial Hall property all I want to do is deliver a petition I don't want to cause any trouble so we're going across the block here to City Hall and seeing if there's a drop box and maybe somebody at City Hall can get your petition well folks we tried to drop off your petition more than three thousand names here and they're still coming in to the people at Centennial Hall the security there said we would be charged with trespassing we were not allowed to move past the public sidewalk so we've come across the block to City Hall and I've put mayor Browns name hopefully the mayor himself will get to see all your names who are opposed to the idea of this hateful Idol coming to a city-owned venue we hope the mayor reads it was the old saying goes folks denial ain't just a river in Egypt and denial seems to be the operative word here a lot of the people we spoke to on this side who are buying tickets for mr. Asif concert they just flat-out deny that he made those statements on his own Facebook account they somehow come up with a rationale that it's a good idea to ban women from singing in public they don't seem to have an issue with him meeting with a Holocaust denier and a terrorism supporter how sad in 21st century Canada there is a market for mr. Asif the hateful Idol for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Wade Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video you
