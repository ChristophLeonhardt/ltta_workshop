WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

84
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:43,630
MEETING, BUT THE PRESIDENT

85
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,131
IS NOT JUST LOOKING TO HAVE

86
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:47,200
A MEETING, HE IS NOT LOOKING

87
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,668
FOR JUST A CHEAP POLITICAL

88
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:49,636
STUNT, HE WANTS TO GET

89
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:51,204

LONG-LASTING AND ACTUAL REAL

91
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:52,839
SOLUTION.

92
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:53,506
>> AS THE WHITE HOUSE

93
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,308

00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:01,481
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE

98
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,283
USED THAT AS THE REASON FOR

99
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:04,651
POSTPONING THE SUMMIT RATHER

100
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:06,953
THAN THE WHITE HOUSE STATED

101
00:02:06,953 --> 00:02:08,288

102
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:09,222

CONFRONTATION.

107
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,993
>> WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE

108
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,261
IS SIMPLY ANNOUNCED THAT WE

109
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,763
WERE DELAYING THE SUMMIT TO

110
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,098
A DATE NOT DESIGNATED AND

111
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,668
SAY OUT REASON FOR IT WAS

112
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:22,602
THAT THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP TO

113
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:23,770
THE PLANNING MEETING.

114
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,471
IF THEY DON'T SHOW UP TO THE

115
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,306
PLANNING MEETING IT'S HARD

116
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:27,974
TO PLAN AND GET THINGS DONE

117
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,409
BY JUNE 129.

118
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,811
BUT, BY CANCELING IT, IT

119
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:32,879
MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE THEY

120
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,147
ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PEACE

121
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:34,647
THAN WE ARE.

122
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:35,915
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

123
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:37,216

GUARANTEES AND A PROMISE

143
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,649
THAT ZTE WILL BUY MOST OF

144
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,884
ITS COMPONENTS FROM U.S.

145
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:12,251

ON 1.3 BILLION.

151
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,792
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DEAL

152
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:20,727
DREW FIRE FROM THE

153
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,028
PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY.

154
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,630

00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:27,233
IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR ZTE

158
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:28,201
AND CHINA.

159
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,502
CHINA CRUSHES U.S. COMPANIES

160
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,437
WITH NO MERCY AND THEY USE

161
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:32,472
THESE TELECOM COMPANIES TO

162
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:34,674
SPY AND STEAL FROM US.

163
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:35,642
MANY HOPES THIS TIME WOULD

164
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:36,275
BE DIFFERENT.

165
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,210
NOW CONGRESS WILL NEED TO

166
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,611
ACT.

167
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:39,812
NOT SURPRISINGLY DEMOCRATS

168
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:41,881

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION EVER

178
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,128

179
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,062
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

180
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:56,863
RECENTLY CONSIDERED

181
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,131
SANCTIONS AGAINST ZTE AND
