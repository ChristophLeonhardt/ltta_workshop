case you didn't know it is made a today day protests in France have turned violent forcing police to use tear gas and water cannons and arrest more than 200 protesters corruption there seemingly they see was endemic across the board made a protest in support of workers rights turned violent in cities around the world as the tear gas settles and rain washes blood from the streets of Europe after this week's global Mayday uprising I'm after in return see and this is going underground special with me for the whole program is legendary journalist and filmmaker John Pilger John let's start and go straight to austerity before we go to foreign policy you've been in Australia I know another first world country the levels of austerity being bleeding since the 2008 crash austerity is applied globally so the same policies of extreme tax cuts the Trump is imposing on the United States that we've that we've had in this country very for a very long time it's called neoliberalism they apply so you have what is called an underclass people working for on temporary visas for low wages this has become the pattern in all rich countries it's a kind of Darwinian economics but those who've to third society those who've have got it do really well those in the middle who aspire to do well are usually in debt and those in the bottom are discarded and yet of course while as you say these two thirds have been suffering since 2008 or even before then there is money for wars what was your reaction when you first heard of the anglo-american French missile attacks on Syria it's built on a series of I would call them lies fabrications the clerical attack on Duma to resume clearly said this is why Britain has to go in and fight I figured if equation a says is to be believed frankly she's yet to convince us that she has a right to be believed because almost everything to do with foreign policy has shown to in the end if you take the the the Solsbury attack that is unraveling so fast for example the OPCW report on this which has not reported include a laboratory report from its major laboratory in Switzerland which said this this wasn't a nerve agent this wasn't know for sure it was something entirely different looking about the Wiltshire attack well sure so it's a Salisbury attack but they are connected because it leads then weed leads then to the attack on Syria that there is overall a campaign against Russia this is a very long campaign it's been going on since the Russian Revolution but it's intensified in terms of its propaganda in a way I'd never known I've never known journalism to be so distorted in order to serve this propaganda I be the attack on on on Duma was based on when I called it a lie when you look at the available evidence the real evidence the evidence that barely sees the light of day then there's no justification for it whatsoever there's no real evidence of a chemical attack so what we're seeing is is the most intense campaign of propaganda at least since the Iraq the build-up to the Iraq war in 2003 it comes from a great tradition it comes from 1945 the cover story for dropping two atomic bombs later discredited right through to the beginning of the Vietnam War the gulf of tonkin so we had years of misery and devastation in Vietnam built on a lie when are we going to understand this when we going to send understand they historical pattern and we're seeing that played out now almost through the propaganda that's presented as news I think we're gonna argue that many mainstream media journalists have short term memories perhaps but they are handed as they have always been handed press releases from government that routinely say Russia has obviously invaded an area of Europe and now they're being told we have proof that they have launched a chemical attack on English soil first time since the World War two and and the journalists say our governments cannot possibly be lying about such a serious event I've been a journalist for a long time I've covered many wars I've covered the first cold war I've covered it from the Soviet Union I've covered it from the United States I've worked all over the world I'm a reporter I would say there is a pseudo journalism now the kind of journalism you described I wouldn't describe as journalism to simply write down and swallow what governments tell you is the very antithesis of what real journalism is fortunately we still have it in the great honourable exceptions the Mavericks like Robert Fisk whose single report from Duma showed almost without doubt the whole thickness of farce he had a viewed a doctor had worked at this particular facility there was no evidence the doctor made a mockery of macarons and maze and claims we have seymour hersh now who can't pup be published in his own country has to be published in germany probably the greatest investigative reporter in the world Hirsch last year made his own reporting his own investigation made mockery of these so-called chemical attacks I've never known a time when so-called as you described it mainstream surely a a satirical term mainstream journalism has been so integrated into a propaganda barrage and that that propaganda campaign at the moment pointed right against Russia suggests to me that it's the beginning of a kind of nother march on Russia that the surrounding of Russia with bases with American bases with NATO missiles the provocations day after day suggests this in Syria where basically the Russians and the Syrians have succeeded they've won the the the rebels most of whom are jihadists and extreme Islamists supported by the United States supported bright britain are still presented as a credible opposition within syria but the whole point of this is to take syria from the russians since the 1950s if you read the documents you go back and read the declassified mi6 dispatches from syria they've been trying to do this since the 1950s syria hasn't been controlled in the same way that iran hasn't been controlled this is i hope this is not the last stage i don't think it is because in syria it appears there's a major defeat and what we're seeing is a reaction to them but of course you mentioned some world renowned journalists have you been surprised about how they have been taken as apologists for putin and for assad by presenting the opposite derek no of course not i've been called everything throughout my career that's a badge of honor you're a good reporter only if at some point authority established forces about whom about whose nefarious activities and invasions you're writing label you a dupe that used to be a favorite or an apologist Robert Fisk knows this very well that's happened with every great story he's reported than they I say great story because his reporting has been of the highest order since I've known him as weed Seymour Hersh as with with people like Gareth Porter great investigative reporter who you'll never see he's American you'll never see in a so-called mainstream newspaper writes on the net but read his material about Iran it's based on fact you mentioned Iran how serious is this narrative now going to twist away but maybe while still remaining on Syria but going to focus on some kind of imminent war on Iran especially as we know John Bolton is no national security adviser and ultra well it's on Paul Bolton and this this and Mike Pompeo who is this Secretary of State it's hard to know who amongst them is the most extreme but Iran has been a major target much more so than Syria much more so than Iraq because Iran was one of the pillars of Western power American power in the Middle East and when Mossadegh the democratically elected leader of Iran was overthrown in in the 1950s by Britain and the United States and the Shah was in installed that was when the pillar was reinforced but the pillar collapsed in 1979 with the revolution in Iran and that has never been forgiven getting around the major ambition at the moment that's why we're coming to a very dangerous period when Trump must ratify the agreement that Obama signed with Iran along with the EU under which Iran committed itself as it frankly always had committed itself to a peaceful nuclear program in return sanctions were dropped and so on we had dangers you know dangers that are presented to us there is so unnecessary why why are we why are we threatening countries like Iran which it hasn't invaded anyone for about 400 years that don't threaten us why is anachronism like Israel allowed to have its impunity what why do we why do we believe these why do as you have described why do we journalist write down what governments tell us why don't they question them don't they it's just a few years ago but that exactly that all those those terrible mistakes happened in 2002-2003 that led to the disaster of the invasion of Iraq of Iraq why is this being repeated these are questions that demand to be answered not just by journalists but by the public in Democrats particularly in countries of brick' still regard themselves as democratic John bel Jay they stop you there more from John Pilger after the break welcome back I'm still here with legendary journalist and filmmaker John Pilger John did you ever expect to see what looked like deterrent in Korea no I didn't expect it although I should have expected it the Koreans themselves if we'd been following them and we don't follow them we follow the big powers that impose their themselves particularly in their lightest states on that country it's a very popular move by the president of South Korea it's it's it's I would I would have thought is clearly a popular move in North Korea the Koreans Korea is one of the most homogeneous societies in the world I mean you can find very few countries that are so it's almost like France related it's one big family the idea of them divided is absurd they recognize that but what this demonstrates is that a regional solution is is possible not only possible it's probably the only way to all these to all the world's so-called flashpoints and problems but their credit is being given to donald trump's administration oh yeah he's they people want to give him the Nobel Peace Prize why not keep into a few others I'm coming Warren Joyner details that massive military expansion in that area yeah it's obviously not everyone is celebrating because the share prices of all Boeing Raytheon Lockheed and others have gone down how can these regional peace deals be done in the face of all of that military-industrial complex well if this deal is being done and I think both careers have to be very careful of not walking into a trap as well the trap could be that North Korea is disarmed completely and that North Korea knows that by having nuclear weapons that's prevented it from being another Iraq another Libya from being attacked I don't think there's any question about that so while it's desirable that North Korea is disarmed of nuclear weapons and and all of Korea is denuclearized it also has to be D Americanized the - in fact the the former is rather more important than the latter how that happens is going to be a very tricky part of the negotiations coming up because Korea as far as the United States can is concerned is is really a frontline on a number of countries but especially a frontline on China it would is Russia and China at borders Russia and China of course but it has its sad so-called anti-missile system it is said to be pointing at the north no one believes that it's pointing at China so these are very precarious days ahead but I think they're quite hopeful days I'm not sure if you still have friends in the national security apparatus of the United States but do you think there are people in there taking a rather dim view very dim and will oppose this as you point out although the arms companies will oppose this although the the Japanese have said publicly they support it but and I've no doubt the Japanese people support it no question about that but whether the United States stays in Korea literally leaves if the crucial factor here that really in the end of the Korean surely there are interests and we should remind people who don't because it seldom engineer that who goes Britain was involved in killing of 20% of the population off of Korea how far would the United States go in trying to remain there if peace breaks I don't know but the it for them it may all get out of control this will become so popular if it isn't already in Korea that they might they might find great difficulty with the local population and even the local political elite South Korea you know is sort of hybrid it's a it's a vassal state of the United States but it's also bred people like the prep the present president and people like Kim dae-jung and others who who saw a deterrent with the north as their prime political purpose not as a servant of the United States perhaps that's a clash that we've yet to see happen and perhaps it's coming but the process is started that's that's the important thing and regional processes like this have a high success rate though they have a high success rate in in I remember in Uganda when the East African states following the devastation of Idi Amin in Uganda that was a regional solution they will let they were left alone in Latin America when countries very rarely had been left alone by the United States they've had regional groups that have banded together in economic formations and if you like protected each other I mean that's why they hated who go shadows so much because he promoted that he promoted that regional solution to - to a regional so perhaps we're seeing the beginning of something like that of course if you go to the at least they would be a regional solution there if there wasn't the United States supporting one state in its impunity and it's priority in its occupation of part of it if there was goodwill in the United States to make that a regional solution then to be very difficult there there are a many different competing tribal forces but those tribal forces have mostly been reignited by the the imperial powers as we saw in Libya in 2011 so again I suppose I'm saying that although it's probably wrong that it's so remote at the moment in the Middle East but to see glimmers of it in Korea is hopeful well if Trump has enemies over Korea because he may want the big grand gesture he now has the curious enemy of the DNC that is suing him Russia is the u.s. Democratic Party and this is serious because I had to recheck it again yes is suing Donald Trump Russia and Julian Assange yes and Mickey Mouse it's it's just absurd as the ruler inquiry progresses in within their own established by say the House Intelligence Committee have ruled out have found after months of looking into it a conspiracy between Trump and the Russians it was the probably the Clinton cables the Hillary Clinton cables particularly the Podesta ones the Podesta ones that showed that Hillary Clinton their absolute embodiment of the Democratic establishment that her foundation that she knew rather she knew that the the force of the Saudi Arabia Qatar were backing Isis they were backing these extreme jihadist movements and yet she she and her foundation benefited from huge donations into into the Clinton Foundation and she didn't went on as Secretary of State to so-called negotiate the biggest arms deal that America has ever known with those states so that's in him that's important information that tells us how power works that's upset them in Russia of course fighting Isis and al Qaeda in Syria but does that mean them that basically Julian Assange and his WikiLeaks organization can never be forgiven by that establishment well they'll never be forgiven I'd be we're talking earlier about good journalists are never forgiven that's why they're good journalists that's part of being a good journalist but Assange has suffered so much for being for WikiLeaks being so good have you been in touch with him yes indirectly at the moment I haven't I've been in touch because he's denied visitors there's he can't make phone calls he got no internet it's the pressure pressure is on him and every bit of his extraordinary resilience is now being called upon it's it's one of those miscarriages of justice that's too mild a turn grotesque in justices that that it should manifest right in the heart of London is a disgrace assange isn't even allowed to go to a hospital and come back because they won't let him back he has the right to safe passage out of that embassy he has a justified fear of the United States extraditing him and putting him and the kind of hellhole the Chelsea Manning endured only they'll probably throw away the key with Julian Assange he's done it too well and so over these leaks the leak the leak actually I mean WikiLeaks doesn't know where the leak came from but the leak almost certainly came from within the Democratic National Committee the same body that is now conducting this ridiculous action against against WikiLeaks and the rest you might as well the same thing would be directed against the New York Times or The Washington Post went to publish the Pentagon Papers and back in those halcyon days when they did real journalism if anyone needs the support of Democrats of journalists of those who believe in basic freedoms freedom of speech freedom of knowledge freedom to no freedom of real journalism it's him John Pilger thank you and that's it for the show we'll be back on Monday with renowned anti racism campaign amok wodsworth on his expulsion from jeremy corbyn's Labor Party for bringing the party into disrepute till then you can keep in touch via social media we'll see on Monday 19 years to the day NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia killing or injuring 23 Beijing would call it a barbaric
