>> AN AMERICAN CITIZEN ROBBED
BLIND BY OUR OWN FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.
THE 64-YEAR-OLD HAD MORE THAN
$58,000, HIS ENTIRE LIFESAVINGS,
CONFISCATED BY U.S. CUSTOMS AT
THE CLEVELAND AIRPORT.
IT WAS THE RESULT OF A
CONTROVERSIAL PRACTICE CALLED
CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE.
HE STILL DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY
BACK, DESPITE NEVER BEING
CHARGED WITH ANY CRIME.
CHASE GALLAGHER IS LIVE IN OUR
WEST COAST NEWSROOM TO EXPLAIN.
HI, TRACE.
HI, TRACE.
>> WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES
YOUR MONEY, AND PROPERTY, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO BE CONVICTED OF A
CRIME, OR EVEN CHARGED WITH A
CRIME, YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BE
SUSPECTED OF WRONGDOING.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS CASE U.S.
CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION
BELIEVES HE WAS INVOLVED IN
EITHER SMUGGLING, DRUG
TRAFFICKING, OR MONEY
LAUNDERING, THOUGH THEY'VE
OFFERED NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT
THE ALLEGATIONS.
THE AGENCY RELEASED A STATEMENT
SAYING WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY
THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY IN
CLEVELAND, QUOTING, TSA AGENCIES
DISCOVERED ARTFULLY CONCEALED
U.S. CURRENCY.
HE PROVIDED INCONSISTENT
STATEMENTS REGARDING THE
CURRENCY, HAD NO VERIFIABLE
SOURCE OF INCOME, AND POSSESSED
EVIDENCE OF STRUCTURING
ACTIVITY, WERE YOU MAKE DEPOSITS
AND WITHDRAWALS OF LESS THAN
$10,000 TO AVOID THE BANKS FROM
NOTIFYING THE DEPARTMENT OF
TREASURY.
THE FAMILY SAYS THERE WAS NO
ARTFUL DECEPTION.
THE MONEY WAS WRAPPED IN PAPER,
PLACED IN HIS CARRY-ON, AND THAT
ANY INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS WERE
BECAUSE OF HIS POOR ENGLISH.
KAZAZI IS A RETIRED POLICE
OFFICER FROM ALBANIA.
HE AND HIS FAMILY CAME TO THE
U.S. IN 2005 THROUGH THE VISA
LOTTERY PROGRAM AND BECAME U.S.
CITIZENS IN 2010.
LAST FALL, KAZAZI PLANNED A TRIP
BACK TO HIS HOME COUNTRY TO
VISIT FAMILY AND POTENTIALLY BUY
A VACATION HOME.
HE CLAIMS HE TOOK THE $58,000 IN
CASH BECAUSE HE DOES NOT TRUST
THE ALBANIAN BANKING SYSTEM.
WHEN HE GOT TO THE AIRPORT IN
CLEVELAND, KAZAZI SAYS WAS NOT
ONLY WAS HIS MONEY CONFISCATED,
HE WAS SUBJECTED TO A
HUMILIATING STRIP SEARCH, BUT
UNDER ASSET FORFEITURE LAWS IT'S
INCUMBENT ON MR. KAZAZI TO PROVE
HE'S NOT UP TO SOMETHING
NEFARIOUS, WHICH IS WHY HE'S
FILED A LAWSUIT TO GET BACK HIS
58 GRAND.
>> TRACE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JOINING US ERROLL KAZAZI.
WHAT WAS YOUR DAD DOING WITH HIS
ENTIRE LIFESAVINGS?
>> HE WAS PLANNING ON TAKING
CARE OF OUR FORMER HOME WHICH
NEEDED REPAIRS, AND THEY WERE
PLANNING ON A VACATION HOME
WHERE THEY COULD RETIRE.
>> HE'S BRINGING ALL HIS MONEY
OVER, GOT IT WRAPPED IN PAPER IN
THE BAG.
THEY SAY THAT IT WAS CONCEALED
IN AN ODD WAY, THAT THEY
SUSPECTED THAT HE MIGHT BE
GUILTY OF SOME KIND OF SMUGGLING
OR DRUG TRAFFICKING OR MONEY
LAUNDERING.
HAS HE EVER BEEN INVOLVED WITH
ANY CRIMES OF THOSE ACTIVITIES
EVER?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THOSE ACCUSATIONS ARE COMPLETELY
BASELESS.
THE FACT THAT THEY EVEN HAD TO
LIST FOUR OF THEM WITHOUT BEING
CLEAR ON ONE THEY'RE TRYING TO
STATE KIND OF MAKES THIS ALL
EVEN MORE CONFUSING.
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, BECAUSE
NONE OF THAT EVER HAPPENED.
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS
TALKING TO THEM?
THEY SAY HE GAVE INCONSISTENT
STATEMENTS, AND THAT WAS WHAT
SORT OF OPENED THE DOOR FOR THEM
TO CONFISCATE HIS MONEY, AND AS
YOU HEARD TRACE GALLAGHER SAY
THEY'VE TAKEN $2 BILLION THAT
WAY REAM.
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THEM MAKING THE CLAIMS FOR
INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS WAS THEM
NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HIS
POOR ENGLISH.
IF THEY HAD BOTHERED TO CONTACT
A TRANSLATOR, EVEN A FAMILY
MEMBER, THEY COULD HAVE TRIED
REACHING OUT TO ME OR MY MOTHER,
SO WE COULD TRANSLATE FOR HIM,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THOSE
ISSUES.
>> DID HE REQUEST A TRANSLATOR?
>> YES.
HE DID SEVERAL TIMES.
>> UNBELIEVABLE THAT HE WAS
DENIED.
WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY DOING NOW?
WHAT'S YOUR LEGAL RECOURSE?
>> WE FILED A MOTION FOR A
RETURN OF PROPERTY.
SINCE THEY MISSED THE DEADLINES
WE'RE EXPECTING THE MONEY BACK,
BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING
BACK.
THEY TOOK THE MONEY IN 2017, AND
IT'S BEEN A PAINFUL PROCESS TO
DEAL WITH SINCE THEN.
>> HOW FRUSTRATING HAS IT BEEN
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE
GOVERNMENT, TRYING TO TELL THEM
YOUR STORY, AND TRYING TO MAKE A
CASE?
>> WE TRIED TO REACHING OUT TO
THEM IN THE BEGINNING, AND THE
ONLY OPTIONS THEY GAVE US THAT
YOU WOULD RECEIVE A LETTER THAT
WOULD LIST FOUR OPTIONS, WHETHER
YOU CHOOSE TO ABANDON THE MONEY,
MAKE AN OFFER IN COMPROMISE,
WHERE YOU LET THEM KEEP PART OF
IT, YOU COULD GO THROUGH AND
ADMINISTER A PETITION, WHICH IS
THE PROCESS THEY DO TO NEGOTIATE
WITH THEM, OR REQUEST COURT
ACTION.
>> WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON YOUR
FAMILY OF THE LOSS OF THIS
MONEY?
>> IT'S DEVASTATING.
HE HAD HOMES TO MAKE REPAIRS IN
ALBANIA, UTILITIES AND BILLS TO
PAY OVER THERE.
HE WANTED TO LOOK AT A FEW HOMES
ON THE ADRIANIC COAST AND DECIDE
WHAT TO DO FOR RETIREMENT.
WHAT TO DO FOR RETIREMENT.
>> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HEAR
THE NEXT STEP ON THIS?
>> I'M HOPING VERY SOON.
THEY HAVE TO RETURN THE MONEY AT
THIS POINT.
WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.
>> QUITE A STORY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TELLING
IT TO US.
LET US KNOW.
