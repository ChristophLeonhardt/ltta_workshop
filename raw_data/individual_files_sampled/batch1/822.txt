Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at their lyc√©e for talks with Emanuel McCall just a few hours after Iran had announced it was increasing its uranium enrichment capacity the Israeli prime minister said the move was proof that Dave Ron wants nuclear weapons Netanyahu is in Europe to urge EU leaders to stop supporting the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or jcpoa an accord that he's convinced will collapse I didn't ask France to withdraw from the jcpoa because I think the jcpoa is basically going to be dissolved by the weight of economic forces but I think that there two possibilities are there Iran dismantles its nuclear activities and unilaterally under this pressure or there may be in the future negotiations for a better a better deal the French president said the Iran nuclear deal wasn't perfect but should remain the basis for a wider agreement if he's on if we think it's not enough but it's a useful building block and better than what we had before the best thing is to keep it because as I say a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush so I agree with the GC POA isn't enough but it's better than what we had before Iran says it's boosting its uranium enrichment in case the 2015 deal collapses the head of Iran's atomic agency said it informed the United Nations that work had begun right now the electrical infrastructure and utilities in the tons are ready for hundreds of thousands of SW years the deal limited Iran's nuclear activities in return for lifting sanctions since the u.s. withdrew last month European leaders have been trying to salvage it and find ways to block looming US sanctions European leaders are struggling to save the Iran deal and some analysts say the tehran's decision to increase the pressure on them now may only make it harder Iranian officials are not seeing much rush in the EU decision-making process that's why they want to keep all options available at strategic levels that means also a threat to the Europeans not to you know kid with Iran not to joke with Iran the French president has called for a de-escalation of tensions on all sides but unless European leaders come up with a plan to save the deal soon and keep US sanctions at bay Iran's patience with his allies may soon run out Natasha Butler al Jazeera Paris
