been with us he is an NBC News legal analyst editor chief of law fair blog and a personal friend of James Comey mr. witness welcome back thanks for having me all right you've gotten through I assume as much of the book as you can yeah I only got it this afternoon in it I'm sort of making my way for everybody is scrambling I understand that it's the biggest surprise to you so far well so I you know I have been not surprised to actually by a lot of the tone of it because you know unlike a lot of people I was kind of talking to Jim through some of this period and a lot of the tone of this book is it's fully consistent with the tone of our conversations at the time and this is a guy who was you know situated between the President of the United States and an investigation that he took very seriously and an agency that he felt the need to protect from the White House and the President himself and the people around it and I think that is the that is the tone of the book and that is you know exactly the the story I expected him to be telling what's his goal my goal of this book is it to sound the alarm is this a five-alarm fire he's trying to tell us like you know the country needs rescuing I mean he paints a picture of a president that is destroying the country's rule of law yes I think the first goal is to tell the truth and you know the I think it's really interesting that the the whole White House response to this is to describe him as a liar right rather than to respond to the the essential claims that he is making Jim Comey has many things one of them is not a liar and so I think the first goal is to is to lay out the story of what happened and what what it is that that this president tried to do and has been doing to federal law enforcement and some of that story of course he told in his in his congressional testimony but he's he's sort of laying it out here for you know in in in a richer kind of way I think in addition to that he is raising a moral and political and legal concern about or alarmed as you say about the health of our institutions about the effect of our President on them I'll admit I was surprised by the personal shots that that that Comey took it the president I understand why he's angry and personally so in these characters being besmirched it's character assassination in some ways what's happening but it is one of the guy who we all dick named st. James if you will the Catholic choirboy I'm surprised he went to hand size to orange skin it's not the James Comey that we've seen in public before okay so first of all I don't speak for him I speak for myself and you know I cannot answer for every line of the book and every you know every line that you know somebody may find could have been worded differently or maybe cheap that's that I do think it is kind of rich that we're here clucking about a few lines of the way Comey chose to make a physical description of somebody the president when we are dealing with a president who hurls ad hominem insults at people every day this is the great from the Oval what I always say this is a great trap of the Trump era right is it from the top down you have a president who has no boundaries on what words he will say how he will and we all are hold ourselves to higher standards and when we see somebody you're like well wait a minute and you're right we would not even blink if the President did be the president today tweeted the words slimeball I think you know it's a 300 page book no I'm sure that those two lines will get a lot of attention and I'm not even going to say I wouldn't prefer that he had never did that different fair enough what you learn in the book well so there's a lot of interesting stuff about commis childhood you know including this how incident that I had sort of generically known known had taken place in which he was you know held at gunpoint in a home-invasion situation about his early career as a mob prosecutor which I actually didn't know very much about you know it that predates sure my knowing him and so you know I think there's a there's actually a lot of biographical stuff among other things he's a very good writer and so it's it's actually an engaging Lee told story but we've learned this we know he's a good writer we learned this from his congressional testimonies for the years he's incredibly good at narrative yes yeah it was good at it as a prosecutor good at laying out a story and he's good at it here and that's true by the way orally as well as in written form which is one of the reasons I think this is going to be a bad weekend for the President as he starts giving these interviews rod Rosen Stein is telling colleagues that he's being he's prepared to be fired and he's he said something interesting he said that history will judge his his decision of his role in the Comey firing much kinder than he's been treated today saying there are things we don't know that went into the decision to fire Cohn so you know I I obviously have an opinion about that episode and and I will of course revisit that if new facts come out I think that rod Rosenstein did not perform well in that episode but that he's done a lot of things since then including the hiring of Bob Muller and the assiduous and careful protection of that investigation and the one in New York of Michael Cohen and allowing them to do their work and I think you know it would be a travesty for rod Rosenstein to be fired I you know I hope very much that that is not the situation that we're looking at Michael Cohen you brought it up just now there's a new filing Michael Cohen is trying to seek basically the ability to to look at all of the papers first that the Justice Department took from his look at all of the material first and let him decide what's material and what isn't and what we learned in the government's case to basically deny that motion from him is that this doesn't have anything perhaps to do with the Muller investigation this is a separate criminal investigation of Michael Cohen it's separate and it's old it's several months old absolutely tells us yeah and and the other interesting thing in this document is the claim by the government that a lot of the material seized has very little to do with the practice of law it has to do with other businesses that Cohen is engaged in right including the fact that he doesn't really have that many legal clients and so you know the president tweeted out the other day that the attorney-client privilege is dead the government seems to be saying here that the attorney-client privilege may have relatively little to say about a lot of this material what we're learning is Michael Cohen's job wasn't lawyer first that was a job he had not the job that he had this I think is what the government is making the case here anyway been witness I don't you love Herbalife thank you good to see you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
