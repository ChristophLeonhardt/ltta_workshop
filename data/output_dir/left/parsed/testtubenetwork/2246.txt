Tel Aviv, Israel
Thousands of Ethiopian-Israelis take to the
streets to protest police violence.
Police officers were caught on camera beating
an Ethiopian Jewish soldier.
For decades, Ethiopian Jews have complained
of harassment and second class treatment in Israel.
Around 135,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel.
Many migrated to the country through Israeli
rescue operations.
Israelâ€™s President has since pledged to
crack down on discrimination against Ethiopian Jews.
