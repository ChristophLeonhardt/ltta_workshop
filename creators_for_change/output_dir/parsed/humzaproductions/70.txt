fish skills just warning although they
depart very broadly
Oh Bravo sedessa sister what's she doing
it
I guess it started a few years back
before you went to prison she was
hanging around some really dodgy guys I
don't know how she knew them but all I
know is that she changed when she was
around them so much she was always going
on about political issues and taking a
stand and doing something doing
something would you do about everything
that's going on in the Middle East don't
get me wrong I know she was angry but I
agree with what she said I just I didn't
think she was capable of doing something
so stupid I don't know about anyone else
but I'm feeling falooda right now what's
wrong would you burn mama
shut up man my point is that those guys
she was hanging around with introduced
her to another guy called Faisal and
they were talking on Facebook for a
while and he kept asking her about being
some kind of jihadi bride
since when she brought it up a few weeks
back we had a really big fight I thought
I knocked some sense into her I tried
but I was already too late
she's shit brainwashed and I think she's
going to Syria tonight first class or
economy no hang on hang on these guys
like she's I'm going with where did he
live I don't know I just I think I saw
her talking to this one guy that doesn't
live too far from here Rob let's go and
check out this cool sedum I quote and
then afterwards you get falooda
yes Eileen yes I don't think you guys
are taking flu that seriously right now
right Luda what I need you to hold on me
my boy will sort this out she's my
friend I need to help out shut up you
have no friends
okay just go home and listen to me
my brother went to find her but they
were too late
she'd already gone a few days have
passed by and she's been all over the
news they've caught about so many
different names jihadi bride an
extremist a terrorist sympathizer but I
knew his I sure just I sure she was
never near those things
she was just lost and ended up following
the wrong people and now I've lost my
best friend a sister
the only person you understood me but I
wish I'd understood her maybe I could
have stopped her talked her out of it
maybe it was my fault I could have done
but how could she be so naive if only we
could go back to how it used to be
everything was so simple
we were so carefree the only thing we
cared about was each other
really Wow best friends
we were the unbreakable trio but here we
are in pieces I wonder if she thought of
us if she missed me like I missed her
but what's done is done she's made a
choice she abandoned us abandoned me
she's set sail on a sinking ship
and now she's gone forever and I'm never
getting her back
I know you'll never read this and I know
never get to see any of it to you but I
just wanted to say goodbye
Oh Martin for
it's gonna
is that prison I'm not listen here bring
him to me do that will your debts or
watch it I understand
Oh
