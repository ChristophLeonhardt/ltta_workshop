I'M ALL FORGETTING PEOPLE WITH
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE IN
GOVERNMENT.
THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE
SURE THEY ARE GOOD FOR ALL
AMERICAN BUSINESS.
GUEST WHO COFOUNDED THE SHIPPING
FIRM BRINGING STEEL HERE FROM
SOUTH KOREA AND WHO REMAINS AN
OWNER.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE FOR REGULAR
VIEWERS OF SWAMP WATCH.
WILBER IS NEGOTIATING OVER SOUTH
KOREAN STEEL IMPORT.
DID WILBER TELL HIM ABOUT THESE
CONFLICTS.
DID HE TELL THEM THEY ARE
SHIPPING THE IMPORTS TO AMERICA.
LAST WEEK WE TOLD YOU WILBER
OWNS STAKES IN SOUTH KOREAN
STEEL.
HE OWNS STEAKS IN THE
TRANSPORTATION RECOVERY FUNDS
THAT COULD ALSO HIT AUTO
HE ALSO HOLDS STAKE IN OIL.
WE TOLD YOU HE PARTIALLY OWNS
DIAMOND SHIPPING THAT HAS A LONG
LIST OF CLIENTS THAT BUSINESS
COULD BE EFFECTED.
WE TOLD YOU THAT ON NOVEMBER
2017 EIGHT MONTHS AFTER JOINING
THE NAVIGATOR HOLDS AND DIAMOND
SHIPPING.
WE TOLD YOU THERE WAS NO
EVIDENCE THE CHIEF OF STAFF IS
LISTED AS A DIRECTOR A COMPANY
TIED TO IT.
IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS THE
OFFICE CONTACTED THE SHOW AND
ADDRESSED SOME BUT NOT ALL.
LISTEN CAREFULLY.
FIRST THE ISSUE OF DIVESTMENT
AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF.
SECRETARY ROSS FULLY DIVESTED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE ETHICS
AGREEMENT EVEN THOUGH NOT
REQUIRED.
HE CONTINUES TO SEEK OUT AND
FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF ETHIC
OFFICIALS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE
WITH FEDERAL REGULATION.
THEY HAVE NOT FOUND SEX 232 TO
HAVE A DIRECT AND PREDICTABLE
PRACTICE.
ADDITIONNALLY WENDY RESIGNED
PRIOR TO BECOMING CHIEF OF
STAFF.
RIGHT, A FEW POINTS HERE.
THIS ONLY REFERS TO DIVESTMENT
OF ONE OF THE TWO COMPANIES.
SECONDLY, HERE IS THE WEBSITE
WERE SUCH DIVESTMENTS SHOULD BE
LISTED.
THE LATEST TRANSACTION WAS
NOVEMBER 2017.
THIS WAS AN UNRELATED COMPANY.
NO TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN POSTED
SINCE.
WE STATED CLEARLY TONIGHT IF
THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THE
DIVESTMENT SHOW IT TO US.
WE HAD A WEEK AND WE WILL
HAPPILY SHOW OUR VIEWERS.
NAME REMAINS LISTED AS DIRECTOR
AT NORTIC SHIPPING.
SECRETARY ROSS' OFFICE SAID
QUOTE MOST OF THIS REPORT IS
BASED ON HALF TRUTHS AND
ASSUMPTIONS THAT DON'T MAKE
SENSE.
BOTH MR.  HILTON BOTH WORK ON
SHIPS.
THE SHIPMENT NOTES A FRACTION OF
THE USE.
THEY HOLD A SMALL PERCENT
INTEREST IN A FUND THAT HAS
PARTIAL FUNDS.
NOTE, THE SECRETARY'S OWN
STATEMENT CONFIRMS THE CENTRAL
CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE.
WITH ONE HAND WILL BETTER ROSS
OWNS A COMPANY THAT SHIPPED
SOUTH KOREAN STEEL TO THE U.S.
WILBER ALSO ADDED THE SECRETARY
WILL IMPLEMENT THE PRESIDENT'S
BOLD TRADE AGENDA AND RIGHT THE
WRONGS AGAINST OUR AMERICAN
WORKERS.
LET ME REPEAT.
I AM ALL FOR SUCCESSFUL AND
EXPERIENCED BUSINESS PEOPLE LIKE
WILBER ROSS SEVERING IN
GOVERNMENT.
WHAT'S NOT GOOD IS WHEN THEY
HIDE BEHIND SWAMPY ETHICS RULES
THAT A CHILD COULD PROVE.
THEY ARE CLAIMING THIS DOESN'T
EFFECT A COMPANY THAT IMPORTS
STEEL.
YOU COULD ARGUE WHAT CONSTITUTES
THE SHIPMENT BUT YOU ARE STILL
SHIPPING STEEL.
THEY ALSO ARGUE POTENTIAL OIL
SANCTIONS DON'T EFFECT THE
COMPANY THAT SHIPS OIL FROM
VENEZUELA.
THIS IS THE LEGALISTIC B.S. WE
GOT FROM CROOKED CLINTON.
WHEN YOU SEVER IN THE
ADMINISTRATION THAT DRAINS THE
SWAMP.
WE EXPECT A HIGHER STANDARD.
SOME SUGGEST WE MADE A MISTAKE.
ROSS' INTEREST ARE IN A BLIND
TRUST.
WE LOOKED INTO THAT AND THAT'S
NOT THE CASE.
THIS IS ROSS' ETHICS AGREEMENT.
THIS IS WERE ANY RELEVANT BLIND
TRUST WILL BE LISTED.
IT NEVER MENTIONED ANY BLIND
TRUST.
THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS
IS A JOKE.
IT ALLOWED BILL CLINTON TO MAKE
MILLIONS IN SPEAKING FEES WHILE
HIS WIFE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SECRETARY
HANDED OUT A $10 MILLION GRANT
TO A COMPANY COCHAIRED BY HER
OWN COVET.
DRAIN THE SWAMP WAS ONE OF
DONALD TRUMP'S MOST IMPORTANT
PROMISES.
WE'LL HOLD EVERYONE TO INTEREST.
WE'LL GET TO THAT ON ANOTHER
NIGHT.
IN THE MEANTIME, A MASSAGE IT
WILL.
BY THE WAY WE REPEATEDLY
INVITED.
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU KNOW
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NNOW
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NOOW
SECRETARY ROSS, YOU NO BETTER
THEN MOST THERE IS A CLEAR
STANDARD.
YOU REDUCE
