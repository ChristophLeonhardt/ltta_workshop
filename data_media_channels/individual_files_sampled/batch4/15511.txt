there was a girl who tricked thousands of men on tender to meet her in Union Square in New York City all at the same time to put them through a series of humiliating tests and it was all to prove how women are judged on their looks a woman identified as natasha a ponte invited thousands of men she met on tinder to meet her in the park one man named Spencer told the tale on Twitter he said she gets the mic and just like thanks for coming out of it you're all wondering what this is all about and I'm like yeah what the f is this about she then says so I know all of you here are on tinder then she says I've invited you all here for a chance to go on a date with me and proceeds to give a Hunger Games speech about what its gonna take to date her finally it started to make sense to Spencer all the dudes there she found on tinder and texted them the same thing Spencer ended up leaving saying he is too old for this twisted game but other men stayed and participated in a pond taze game he found out that she had messaged other men in the exact same manner that she messaged him so this angered me she tricked these men and put them through all of this on a false premise I mean is she aware that tinder works the same for both men and women women are judging men as well many of the times the women have in their profile that they won't date a guy under a certain height and their height is one of the first questions when they match up with someone this angered me especially since I just read an article yesterday from the New York Post that said which is more important brains or beauty for women looking for a man it's the latter being too smart actually puts women off at least that's according to a new study that has concluded that while it's impossible for a guy to be too good-looking they can be too clever for their own good published in the British Journal of Psychology the paper states that women want men to be smart but not too smart there are also studies that show when they find men who are rich to be more attractive and are more attractive to women when they are desired by other women all of these things are superficial ok Natasha men may find women attractive based on looks but women can be just as superficial whether it's about looks or height wealth or popularity so so what if men find women attractive based on looks it's in their nature does that mean that aponte has the right to publicly humiliate thousands of men I mean dating apps in general tend to work on a superficial level anyway it doesn't matter what gender you are another New York Post article explains how dating apps are an ever-expanding pit of despair others talk of the exhaustion of trawling through endless matches going on disappointing dates with some of them then having to drag themselves back onto the net when it goes nowhere it seems to be a frustrating way to date for anyone I say if you're a man get off dating apps of course I would recommend the same thing for women as well but men think it's such a great way to find women and it's not it's probably the worst way to meet women go out in real life and get off the apps this is a horrible modern use of technology that only results in time wasted and feelings of despair if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
