Here we are at AeroFarms. This is our ninth farm and 
the largest vertical farm in the world.
We define vertical farming as layer upon layer of plant growth.
What we could grow in one acre, it takes a 130
acres to grow in the field.
We use 95 percent less water to grow a plant,
zero pesticides, herbicides, fungicides.
We are building AeroFarms with the purpose 
of having a strong impact on the community we live in
as well as the environment.
Also, we're helping alleviate a food desert 
right here in the city of Newark.
