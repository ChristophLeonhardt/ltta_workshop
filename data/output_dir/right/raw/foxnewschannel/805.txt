"THE FIVE" ."

00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,003
AS HE HEADS TO CAPITOL HILL TO

00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:16,004
MEET WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS ON

5
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:16,805
IMMIGRATION.

6
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:19,407
IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S HAVE A

7
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:19,808
MONOLOGUE.

8
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:21,576
ON OTHER NETWORKS, THE HOLOCAUST

9
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:22,243
WAS MENTIONED 12 TIMES OVER

10
00:00:22,243 --> 00:00:23,311
THREE DAYS.

11
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,914
GUESS WHY.

12
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:30,518
>> THEY ARE BEING MARCHED TO

13
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:30,852
SHOWERS.

14
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:33,188
THEY ARE BEING TOLD THEY ARE,

15
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,389
JUST LIKE THE NAZIS, SAID THEY

16
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,723
WERE TAKING PEOPLE TO SHOWERS

17
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,492
AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK.

18
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:38,193
>> DONALD TRUMP INCREASINGLY

19
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:42,564
LOOKS LIKE HITLER IN NAZI

20
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:42,897
GERMANY.

21
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:45,200
>> THE TACTICS USED THROUGH

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,968
HISTORY BY THE WORST PURVEYORS

23
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:49,003
OF PURE EVIL, INCLUDING SLAVE

24
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,606
TRADERS, NAZIS, TERRORISTS.

25
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:53,975
>> THE IMAGES SUGGEST THOSE OF

26
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:54,976
CONCENTRATION CAMPS, FAMILIES

27
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:57,178
BEING CUT APART.

28
00:00:57,178 --> 00:00:58,613
>> Greg: LET'S NOT FORGET

29
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:00,014
GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN'S TWEET

30
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,449
SAYING OTHER GOVERNMENT

31
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,084
SEPARATED FAMILIES TOO, IE NAZI

32
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:04,419
GERMANY.

33
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:07,622
TEMPORARILY HOUSING KIDS MAKES

34
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:10,091
THE UNITED STATES THE THIRD

35
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:10,792
REICH.

36
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,227
AND OUR AGENTS THE ASSESS.

37
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:14,395
BY OTHER GOVERNMENTS, DOES HE

38
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:15,230
MEAN OBAMA?

39
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,998
HERE'S A HEADLINE.

40
00:01:16,998 --> 00:01:18,633
MEXICAN KIDS HELD FOR MONTHS AS

41
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,201
PUNISHMENT FOR BORDER CROSSING.

42
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,604
HERE IS THE PRESIDENT IN 2014.

43
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:23,505
>> THE MESSAGE ABSOLUTELY IS

44
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:29,377
DON'T SEND YOUR CHILDREN

45
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:30,044
UNACCOMPANIED ON TRAINS OR

46
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:31,379
THROUGH A BUNCH OF SMUGGLERS.

47
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,381
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY OF

48
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,184
THESE KIDS DON'T MAKE IT AND MAY

49
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:38,286
HAVE BEEN WAYLAID INTO SEX

50
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:39,053
TRAFFICKING OR KILLED BECAUSE

51
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:40,655
THEY FELL OFF A TRAIN.

52
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,391
>> Greg: HE IS ABSOLUTELY

53
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:44,559
RIGHT WHICH IS WHY TRUMP STEPPED

54
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,661
UP THE ARREST FOR ADULTS FOR

55
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,196
VIOLATING IMMIGRATION LAWS AND

56
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:49,898
BUSTING CHILD SEX TRAFFICKERS.

57
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:51,866
NO ONE COMPARED PRESIDENT OBAMA

58
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:54,435
TO NAZIS BUT NOW THEY OFFEND

59
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,303
HOLOCAUST VICTIMS SURVIVORS AND

60
00:01:55,303 --> 00:01:56,671
AMERICANS IN CHARGE OF TAKING

61
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,607
CARE OF THESE KIDS WHILE THEY

62
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:00,441
ARE HERE.

63
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:02,410
>> YOU UNDERSTAND THE

64
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,810
CONTROVERSY.

65
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,479
ANY COMPARISON TO THE HOLOCAUST.

66
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,681
YES, THE KIDS WERE BROUGHT ON

67
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:14,656
TRAINS TO THEIR       BIRKENAU.

68
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,324
MY GRANDPARENTS WERE MURDERED AT

69
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:17,192
AUSCHWITZ.

70
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:17,992
MY DAD SURVIVED.

71
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,060
HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE

72
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,396
KILLED AT AUSCHWITZ.

73
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,631
THEY WEREN'T SEPARATED TO GO TO

74
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,799
SOME OTHER FACILITY.

75
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,401
THEY WERE SEPARATED TO DIE.

76
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,636
>> Greg: WELL DONE, WOLF.

77
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:30,838
THIS PROBLEM IS BORN FROM A

78
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:31,639
LARGER BROKEN SYSTEM.

79
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,575
WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE LONG-TERM

80
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,009
AND SHORT-TERM CRISES AT ONCE.

81
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,744
IT'S LIKE PLUGGING A HOLE IN A

82
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,146
BOAT WHILE YOU ARE ROWING.

83
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,047
SOME PEOPLE SAW IT COMING.

84
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,583
REMEMBER WHEN WE TRIED TO HELP

85
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,952
COUNTRIES UNDER THEIR THUMBS

86
00:02:43,952 --> 00:02:44,419
ANTICAPITALIST?

87
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,520
THE FOLKS WHO STOPPED THAT ARE

88
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,721
NOW SHOCKED TO SEE PEOPLE

89
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:48,456
FLEEING THOSE VERY COUNTRIES.

90
00:02:48,456 --> 00:02:50,491
NOT EVERYONE IS ALIVE WITH

91
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:52,460
CONDEMNATION, BUT PRESSED FOR AN

92
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,228
ALTERNATIVE, THEY'VE GOT

93
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:53,995
NOTHING.

94
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,997
AND WE ARE WAITING FOR ONE.

95
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:57,599
SOMETHING NO WHITE HOUSE BEFORE

96
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,199
HAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED.

97
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:02,604
SO WE ALL AGREE SEPARATION SUCKS

98
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:05,306
BUT WHEN FACED WITH CHILD SEX

99
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,942
TRAFFICKING AND PRETEND

100
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:09,010
FAMILIES, WHERE IS YOUR ANSWER?

101
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,078
THE MEDIA USES CHILDREN TO

102
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:11,813
MAINTAIN THE NARRATIVE TRUMP IS

103
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:14,015
EVIL EVEN THOUGH HE REDUCES THE

104
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:14,816
THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR.

105
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,718
AND WITH NO MEMORY OF WHAT THEY

106
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,686
REPORTED WHEN THEIR GUY WAS

107
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:21,189
PRESIDENT.

108
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,790
DONNA, DO YOU AGREE, I THINK THE

109
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,994
WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING THIS IS AN

110
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:26,661
EMOTIONAL, POLITICAL PLOY.

111
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,263
>> Donna: FIRST OF ALL, I

112
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:30,431
LOOKED AT THE PRESIDENT'S

113
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,799
FAVORITE NEWSPAPER TODAY.

114
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,568
THIS IS "THE NEW YORK POST."

115
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:36,604
>> Greg: IT CHANGED, DONNA.

116
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,606
>> Donna: THIS IS ABOUT THE

117
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,008
SEPARATION OF CHILDREN FROM

118
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,209
THEIR FAMILIES.

119
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,213
WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA DID HAVE A

120
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:45,880
POLICY THAT BASICALLY SEND

121
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,582
PEOPLE BACK ACROSS THE BOARD, IT

122
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,017
WAS VERY RARE THAT HE SEPARATED

123
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,418
CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

124
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:52,153
THIS IS A POLICY CHANGE THAT THE

125
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:54,589
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT IN

126
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:55,156
PLACE SIX WEEKS AGO.

127
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:57,358
THEY SHOULD CHANGE IT.

128
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,962
THE U.S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

129
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:02,764
TODAY CAME UP WITH A BOLD

130
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:03,431
STATEMENT.

131
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,434
THESE ARE NOT YOUR TYPICAL

132
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:07,802
LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE PAPERS OR

133
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:08,236
ORGANIZATION.

134
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:10,438
EVERYONE IS SAYING IT'S TIME TO

135
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,807
END THIS POLICY, MR. PRESIDENT.

136
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:15,243
LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE

137
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:15,877
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

138
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:16,209
REFORM.

139
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,812
LET'S BRING MORE JUDGES TO THE

140
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:18,146
BORDER.

141
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:21,048
LET'S BRING MORE BORDER PATROL.

142
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:23,217
BUT LET'S END THE POLICY OF

143
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,118
SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR

144
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:24,452
PARENTS.

145
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,421
>> Greg: HERE IS THE ISSUE.

146
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,056
IF WE CAN'T SEPARATE THEM,

147
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:28,923
THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN AMERICA

148
00:04:28,923 --> 00:04:29,624
WHEN SOMEONE GOES TO JAIL.

149
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:33,027
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE THEM.

150
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:33,728
NO ONE IS OFFERING A SOLUTION.

151
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,397
I THINK WE ARE MAKING THE WRONG

152
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:36,964
COMPARISON HERE, DANA.

153
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:40,835
THE ALTERNATIVE IS THE

154
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:42,203
POSSIBILITY BEING WITH A CHILD

155
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:43,237
TRAFFICKER.

156
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,305
THIS MAY NOT BE -- THIS IS A

157
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,441
TERRIBLE ALTERNATIVE BUT THIS IS

158
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:52,447
A WORLD       WORSE ALTERNATIVE.

159
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,247
>> Dana: SOME ALTERNATIVES

160
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,016
WILL BE TO PLAN AHEAD.

161
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:55,817
THERE IS MONEY TO BE ALLOCATED

162
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:59,253
AND TRY TO HOUSE THESE FAMILIES

163
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,321
TOGETHER.

164
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:01,189
OR YOUR IDEA.

165
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,956
EVERYONE GOES BACK TOGETHER ON A

166
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,826
BOSS, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

167
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:05,293
SEPARATED, FINE.

168
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:06,394
YOU DO IT AGAIN, IT'S A FELONY

169
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:07,795
AND YOU'LL BE SEPARATED.

170
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:11,199
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

171
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,234
THE PEOPLE BEING TASKED WITH

172
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,635
CARRYING OUT THIS POLICY, THEY

173
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,405
DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO IT.

174
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:18,639
BUT THEY ARE CARRYING OUT THE

175
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,842
REQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE

176
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:21,175
POLICY.

177
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,044
AND ALSO I DO THINK THERE'S A

178
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:23,845
NARROW PATH.

179
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,413
TED CRUZ HAS AN OPTION, I GUESS

180
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:27,215
THE PRESIDENT WILL PROBABLY TALK

181
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:27,615
ABOUT IT.

182
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,616
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT BECAUSE IT

183
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,384
JUST DEALS WITH THIS PARTICULAR

184
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,152
ISSUE BUT HE MIGHT HAVE TO BE

185
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:34,989
FOR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE.

186
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,924
GET THAT OFF THE TABLE.

187
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,126
MAYBE GET SOME ADDITIONAL JUDGES

188
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,194
BECAUSE I THINK THE OTHER THING

189
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,829
IS THAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT AND

190
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,798
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT FOR

191
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:45,733
ME I THINK IS THE ASYLUM

192
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:46,601
PROCESS.

193
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,802
WHAT IS THE BAR?

194
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,237
WAS VERY EASY TO SAY THAT MY

195
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:50,838
CLAIM ASYLUM AND THEN YOU HAVE A

196
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:52,206
HUGE BACKLOG AND YOU HAVE THIS

197
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:52,540
PROBLEM.

198
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,842
I ALSO THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO

199
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,043
HAVE THIS POLICY AND YOU WANT TO

200
00:05:56,043 --> 00:05:57,211
OWN IT, THEN PLAN AHEAD AND

201
00:05:57,211 --> 00:05:58,646
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF

202
00:05:58,646 --> 00:05:59,847
GETTING THE CHILDREN BACK IN

203
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:01,249
TOUCH WITH THEIR FAMILIES

204
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,250
BECAUSE THE REPORTS OF THEM NOT

205
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,618
BEING ABLE TO DO SO IS

206
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,519
DIFFICULT.

207
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,987
THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS WE

208
00:06:05,987 --> 00:06:07,789
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

209
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,724
COLLECTIVELY GO AFTER THE DRUG

210
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:10,258
CARTELS.

211
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,626
AND NOT EACH OTHER.

212
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:13,227
IT'S THE DRUG CARTELS THAT ARE

213
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,829
STEALING A LOT OF THIS.

214
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,530
>> Greg: JESSE, IT'S HARD TO

215
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,600
DEFEND SEPARATION BUT IT'S

216
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,268
PREFERABLE TO AN INCREASE --

217
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,203
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE

218
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:23,838
REAL FAMILIES, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

219
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:24,906
YOU'VE GOT TO SEPARATE THEM

220
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,442
BEFORE YOU FIND OUT IF THEY ARE

221
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,242
LEGITIMATELY A FAMILY.

222
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:28,843
>> Jesse: WHETHER THE

223
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:30,144
DEMOCRATS REALIZE IT OR NOT,

224
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,013
DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO

225
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:33,448
ACTUALLY HELPS THE CHILD

226
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,015
SMUGGLERS.

227
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:35,249
NO ONE WANTS THAT.

228
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,217
TED CRUZ HAS A BILL.

229
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:37,685
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

230
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:38,152
IT'S PIECEMEAL.

231
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:39,420
HE SAYS FAMILIES GET UNITED.

232
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,823
WE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF

233
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:43,724
IMMIGRATION JUDGES, AND ON THE

234
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:45,226
SILENT CASE TAKES 14 DAYS.

235
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,761
THAT KEEPS EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

236
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,197
WHY DON'T THE DEMOCRATS LIKE

237
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:49,964
CHUCK GET ON BOARD WITH THE BILL

238
00:06:49,964 --> 00:06:51,432
AND SUBJECT TO THE PRESIDENTS

239
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:52,166
DESK WHERE THEY COULD DO IT

240
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,035
RIGHT NOW BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO

241
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,736
DO BECAUSE THEY WANT TO EXPLOIT

242
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:57,538
IT.

243
00:06:57,538 --> 00:06:59,407
DIANNE FEINSTEIN HAS LEGISLATION

244
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:00,441
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

245
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,143
SHE SAYS BORDER PATROL AGENTS

246
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,211
CAN'T EVEN ARREST AND DETAIN AN

247
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:06,447
ADULT WITH A CHILD WITHIN

248
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,616
100 MILES OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER

249
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:09,217
100 MILES OF THE SOUTHERN BORDE

250
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:09,550
BORDER.

251
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,651
WHAT'S THAT GOING TO DO?

252
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,453
IT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE MORE

253
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,221
PEOPLE FOR BRINGING IN CHILDREN

254
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,656
INTO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

255
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:19,594
KATE STEINLE WAS ALSO SEPARATED

256
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:22,230
BY HER FAMILY WITH A BULLET

257
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,199
FIRED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN FELON

258
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,200
WHO WAS DEPORTED FIVE TIMES IN

259
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,435
THE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T REALLY SAY

260
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,603
MUCH ABOUT THAT.

261
00:07:28,603 --> 00:07:29,737
WHEN THEY COMPLAIN NOW, IT'S

262
00:07:29,737 --> 00:07:31,439
HARD TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

263
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,573
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE FAMILY

264
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:33,040
SEPARATED.

265
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,809
I DON'T WANT TO SEE FAMILIES

266
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:35,476
SEPARATED.

267
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:36,277
BUT FIX THE LAW.

268
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,445
FIX THE LAW.

269
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:40,114
HE'S NOT GOING TO END CATCH AND

270
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:40,448
RELEASE.

271
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,148
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

272
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,216
>> Donna: JESSE, IN DECEMBER

273
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,451
OF LAST YEAR, I DON'T KNOW IF

274
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:45,853
YOU ARE PLANNING YOUR HOLIDAYS.

275
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,855
BUT LOOK PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT IN

276
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:52,460
PLACE IN DECEMBER WAS A POLICY

277
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,829
THAT, AS YOU KNOW,

278
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:55,997
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS

279
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,798
ANNOUNCED SIX WEEKS AGO.

280
00:07:57,798 --> 00:07:58,933
TO PROSECUTE EVERYBODY.

281
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,835
AND THEN FIND OUT LATER IF THEY

282
00:08:00,835 --> 00:08:03,905
ARE PART OF A GANG, PART OF A

283
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,641
CARTEL, TRAFFICKING.

284
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,742
WHAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND

285
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:08,676
OTHERS ARE SAYING WOULD KEEP

286
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:10,945
FAMILIES TOGETHER IS, KEEP THEM

287
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,013
TOGETHER.

288
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,447
>> Jesse: THERE ARE LAWS THAT

289
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:14,549
SAY YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND YOU

290
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:15,283
KNOW THAT.

291
00:08:15,283 --> 00:08:16,751
>> Donna: THIS IS A POLICY

292
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,285
CHANGE.

293
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:19,253
>> Jesse: NO, NO, NO.

294
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,022
THE '97 LOSS AS YOU CAN HOLD A

295
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:24,892
MINOR FOR MORE THAN 20 DAYS.

296
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:26,127
YOU CAN'T HOUSE THEM IN FEDERAL

297
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,030
DETENTION FACILITIES TOGETHER.

298
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,697
>> Donna: KEEP THE FAMILY

299
00:08:29,697 --> 00:08:30,431
INTACT.

300
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:31,832
IT'S A SIMPLE STRATEGY.

301
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,301
KEEP THE FAMILIES INTACT, AND

302
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:35,269
THEN YOU GO THROUGH THE VET

303
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,635
PROCESS.

304
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,238
>> Greg: LET ME GET KIMBERLY

305
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,774
ON THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LAW

306
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:40,241
ON THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE LA

307
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,008
LAW.

308
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,409
>> Kimberly: THERE IS A

309
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:43,344
CONCERTED EFFORT TO DISTORT

310
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:45,346
REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE FOR

311
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:45,880
POLITICAL PURPOSES.

312
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,682
I MEAN COME AT THE HEART OF IT,

313
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,016
PEOPLE DO CARE ABOUT CHILDREN

314
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:49,850
AND WE CARE ABOUT FAMILIES BUT

315
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,219
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE

316
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:53,020
ARRIVED AT THIS POSITION.

317
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,854
PEOPLE BREAKING THE LAW.

318
00:08:53,854 --> 00:08:56,924
EVEN IF WE PUT THEM ON THE BOSS,

319
00:08:56,924 --> 00:08:57,925
WHO'S TO SAY THEY ARE NOT WITH

320
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:01,228
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNB

321
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:01,262
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNC

322
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:01,329
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNK

323
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:01,362
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNW

324
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:01,395
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNT

325
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:01,429
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNH

326
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:01,462
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNT

327
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:01,495
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNA

THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURNO

332
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:02,630
THE SEX TRAFFICKER AND YOU TURN.

333
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,632
WHAT WERE TRYING TO DO IN A

334
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,834
RESPONSIBLE, CAREFUL WAY IS TO

335
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:09,637
IDENTIFY WHO THE CHILD IS, THE

336
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:10,237
MINOR, WHO IS THE ADULT

337
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,072
ACCOMPANYING THE CHILD AND MAKE

338
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:14,742
SURE THAT IN FACT THEY ARE

339
00:09:14,742 --> 00:09:17,345
RELATIVE AND SHOULD BE IN THAT

340
00:09:17,345 --> 00:09:20,281
PERSON'S CUSTODY, SO TO SPEAK.

341
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:20,748
PARENTAL RIGHTS.

342
00:09:20,748 --> 00:09:23,217
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT.

343
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,620
I HAVE A HARD TIME, THOUGH,

344
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,655
ACCEPTING IT'S OKAY TO DEMONIZE

345
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:28,756
I.C.E. AGENTS AND BORDER PATROL

346
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:29,991
AND THE PRESIDENT AND THE

347
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:32,660
ADMINISTRATION, ALL SAYING THEY

348
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,195
ARE MEAN-SPIRITED AND THEY WANT

349
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:35,696
CHILDREN ABUSED OR THEY ARE

350
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:37,031
NAZIS IN CAGES AND ALL THESE

351
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:37,832
THINGS.

352
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,234
THIS IS A VERY TOUGH PROBLEM.

353
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,335
THAT'S WHY IMMIGRATION IS

354
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:42,203
IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO ADDRESS IN

355
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:44,071
A RESPONSIBLE WAY.

356
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,240
AGAIN, THE LAWS MUST BE UPHELD,

357
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,775
AND THERE MUST BE SOME PROCEDURE

358
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,810
BY WHICH THEY ARE IDENTIFIED

359
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,445
PROPERLY SO AS TO NOT MAKE

360
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:51,846
MISTAKE.

361
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,014
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE OUTRAGE IF

362
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:54,148
WE WENT AHEAD AND LET SOMEBODY

363
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:56,884
GO WITH A SEX OFFENDER AND

364
00:09:56,884 --> 00:10:00,855
ENCOURAGED AND WERE ACTING IN

365
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:01,589
CONCERT AIDING AND ABETTING SEX

366
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:03,224
TRAFFICKING.

367
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:04,091
HOW IRRESPONSIBLE.

368
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:04,825
IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT

369
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:05,660
CHILDREN.

370
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,061
THEY LET THEM GO WITH ANYBODY

371
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,396
AND THEN THE CHILD GOD FORBID

372
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:12,867
ENDS UP RAPED OR TORTURED OR

373
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:13,534
MURDERED.

374
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:15,169
>> Greg: THEY SHOULD HAVE ZERO

375
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,037
TOLERANCE ON THAT.

376
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,104
DONALD TRUMP HAD COMMENTS TODAY

377
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:17,805
REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THE

378
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:21,242
MEDIA BIAS.

379
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,643
>> THOSE WHO APPLY FOR ASYLUM

380
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:24,412
LEGALLY AT PORTS OF ENTRY ARE

381
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:28,215
NOT PROSECUTED.

382
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,450
THE VAGUE NEWS MEDIA DOESN'T

383
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:29,884
TALK ABOUT IT.

384
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:34,422
THEY ARE HELPING THESE SMUGGLERS

385
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:36,123
AND THESE TRAFFICKERS LIKE

386
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:37,224
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE.

387
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:37,858
WHEN COUNTRIES ABUSE US BY

388
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,894
SENDING THEIR PEOPLE UP, NOT

389
00:10:39,894 --> 00:10:42,797
THEIR BEST, WE ARE NOT GOING TO

390
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,232
GIVE ANY MORE AID TO THOSE

391
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:46,033
COUNTRIES.

392
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,035
WHY THE HELL SHOULD WE?

393
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,136
SOMEDAY THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE

394
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:49,837
FOR DEMOCRATS.

395
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,639
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WIN ON THEIR

396
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,306
POLICIES WHICH ARE HORRIBLE.

397
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,909
THEIR ONLY POLICY WAS THAT

398
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,511
DONALD TRUMP IS A BAD GUY.

399
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,245
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

400
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,214
OF NEGATIVE ADS.

401
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,148
NOBODY'S EVER BEEN HIT LIKE

402
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:01,449
THAT.

403
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,349
I USED TO GO HOME.

404
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,619
I STARTED DISLIKING MYSELF.

405
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:08,055
>> Greg: IT IS HARD TO

406
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:08,489
BELIEVE, DANA.

407
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:11,325
>> Kimberly: ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

408
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:15,062
IMPOSSIBLE.

409
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,064
>> Donna: ONE BOB CORKER,

410
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:19,266
ORRIN HATCH, LAMAR ALEXANDER,

411
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:19,934
JOHN McCAIN, SUSAN COLLINS,

412
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:24,672
BEN SASSE, I HAVE A WHOLE LIST.

413
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:28,642
>> Greg: YOU DON'T THINK --

414
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,910
ALL THE ONES DOING THE OUTRAGE

415
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,813
SIGNALING ALL OVER TWITTER.

416
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:34,615
I WON'T MENTION THE POLITICIANS.

417
00:11:34,615 --> 00:11:35,649
THEY ARE OUTRAGE SIGNALING AND

418
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,819
THEY ARE SO SOLEMN ABOUT IT.

419
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,021
THEY HATE IT, WHICH WE ALL DO.

420
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:41,789
THE SECOND PART, WHAT DO YOU DO

421
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:42,790
ABOUT IT?

422
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,124
SILENCE.

423
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:48,496
>> Dana: DID NUMBERS -- THE

424
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,731
NUMBERS SHE LISTED, THEY ARE

425
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,365
SUPPORTING THE CRUZ BILL.

426
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,433
>> Donna: I WANT TO GO BACK TO

427
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,435
WHAT YOU SAID AT THE TOP OF THE

428
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:55,636
SHOW.

429
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:56,637
AMERICAN SLAVERY AND THE

430
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:57,004
HOLOCAUST.

431
00:11:57,004 --> 00:11:59,640
THEY WERE EVIL EVENTS.

432
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,243
WHILE PEOPLE OFTEN USE THIS TO

433
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,378
DESCRIBE THE PAIN OR DESCRIBE

434
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:06,647
THE DEGRADATION, DEHUMANIZATION,

435
00:12:06,647 --> 00:12:07,548
THESE WERE ABSOLUTELY EVIL

436
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:07,882
EVENTS.

437
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:11,218
WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING NOW IS

438
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,653
THAT THEY THINK THAT THIS

439
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:13,154
COMPARES TO THAT.

440
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:15,055
I TRY TO TELL PEOPLE DON'T DO

441
00:12:15,055 --> 00:12:15,456
IT.

442
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:16,857
DON'T GO THERE.

443
00:12:16,857 --> 00:12:18,893
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO

444
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:19,860
CALL THIS AN OUTRAGEOUS ACT

445
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,862
BECAUSE THESE KIDS ARE BEING

446
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:22,897
ABUSED.

447
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:25,633
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

448
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:26,167
YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

449
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,236
YOU ARE A FATHER.

450
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:30,471
>> Jesse: IN MOST CASES IF

451
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:33,641
SOMEONE COMES ACROSS WITH A

452
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,042
MINOR, THEY ARE ONLY SEPARATED

453
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:35,810
FOR A DAY.

454
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,245
YOU APPLY FOR ASYLUM, IT'S GOING

455
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,447
TO TAKE LONGER THAN 20 DAYS IN

456
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,283
THE LAW SAYS, BASED ON THE

457
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,617
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION UPHELD BY

458
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:44,285
THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF

459
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,452
APPEALS, YOU CAN'T HOLD A MINOR

460
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:47,655
LONGER THAN 20 DAYS.

461
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:50,224
THAT'S WHY HE LOWERED IT TO 14

462
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:51,225
PAIRED WITH THE OBAMA

463
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:51,926
ADMINISTRATION GOT WHACKED FOR

464
00:12:51,926 --> 00:12:54,361
AS THEY WERE SENDING THESE YOUNG

465
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,230
KIDS TO SPONSORS OR UNCLES

466
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,264
SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF

467
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,232
THE UNITED STATES.

468
00:12:58,232 --> 00:12:59,567
THESE KIDS WERE BEING ABUSED,

469
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:04,238
MADE TO WORK SLAVE LABOR JOBS.

470
00:13:04,238 --> 00:13:04,772
AND MALNOURISHED.

471
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,641
>> Donna: IT WAS RARE.

472
00:13:07,641 --> 00:13:08,843
>> Jesse: IT WAS HAPPENING.

473
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,644
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE

474
00:13:10,644 --> 00:13:12,246
KIDS, THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

475
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:12,546
THING.

476
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:13,848
>> Greg: I AM TRYING TO FIGURE

477
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,950
OUT, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION THAT

478
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,051
PREVENTS THE SEPARATION?

479
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,687
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

480
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,422
IF 10,000 OF THESE KIDS ARE

481
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:22,089
UNACCOMPANIED AND THEY ARE

482
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:24,358
ALREADY SEPARATED, THAT LEAVES

483
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:24,658
2,000.

484
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,827
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

485
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:27,628
>> Jesse: RIGHT NOW AND SIMONE

486
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:29,063
CROSSES WITH A MINOR AND THERE'S

487
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:29,763
NO PRIOR HISTORY OF ANYTHING

488
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:33,567
LIKE THAT AND THEY ARE NOT

489
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,101
CLAIMING ASYLUM, THEY DETAIN THE

490
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:34,635
CLAIMING ASYLUM, THEY DETAIN THM

CLAIMING ASYLUM, THEY DETAIN THE

00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,438
THEM, REUNITE THEM WITH THE KID

502
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,839
AND THEN SEND THEM BACK.

503
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:41,242
IF YOU APPLY FOR ASYLUM,

504
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,878
PROCESS, IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM

505
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,346
FOREVER.

506
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:46,347
ASYLUM CASES TAKE FOREVER.

507
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,047
>> Kimberly: THEY GET TO SPEAK

508
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:49,850
ON THE PHONE WITH THE PARENTS.

509
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,551
>> Donna: THE PRESIDENT NEEDS

510
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,052
TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CRISIS

511
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:53,587
HE CAN RESOLVE TONIGHT.

512
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:54,188
>> Greg: EVERYBODY COULD

513
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,625
RESOLVE IT.

514
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,260
>> Donna: THE PRESIDENT.

515
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,227
HE HAS THE PEN.

516
00:14:00,227 --> 00:14:02,029
>> Greg: HE IS THE FIRST GUY

517
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,430
TO ACTUALLY TRY.

518
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,232
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

519
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,300
PEOPLE HAVE TRIED COPPERHEADS OF

520
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,170
IMMIGRATION REFORM BEFORE.

521
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,038
>> Greg: THIS ISSUE IS

522
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:13,474
DIRECTLY RELATED TO A POROUS

523
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:13,807
BORDER.

524
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:14,141
CORRECT?

525
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,644
>> Donna: IT IS A STRATEGY.

526
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:17,511
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A STRATEGY TO

527
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,313
TRY TO GET A COMPROMISE, AND

528
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,415
THIS IS A BAD STRATEGY.

529
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,683
>> Greg: YOU CAN DISAGREE WITH

530
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:24,151
THE STRATEGY BUT YOU CAN'T

531
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:25,452
DISAGREE WITH THE FIVE OF THIS

532
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,754
GUY IS TRYING TO TIGHTEN THE

533
00:14:26,754 --> 00:00:00,000
BORDER.
