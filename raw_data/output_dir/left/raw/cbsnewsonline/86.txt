1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,101
COURT.  

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,001
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN 

3
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,336
ARRAIGNMENT IN COURT.  

4
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,504
HE FACES MULTIPLE MURDER 

5
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,139
CHARGES IN CONNECTION TO DEATHS 

6
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,208
OF HIS PREGNANT WIFE AND THEIR 

7
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,075
TWO DAUGHTERS.  

8
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,378
WE'VE GOT ADDITIONAL 

9
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,645
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CASE 

10
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:13,847
JUST YESTERDAY.  

11
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:14,447
APPARENTLY HE'S ADMITTING TO 

12
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:14,881
KILLING HIS WIFE.  

13
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,717
HE SAYS HE DID IT IN A FIT OF 

14
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,621
RAGE AFTER SHE KILLED THEIR 

15
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,455
DAUGHTERS.  

16
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,057
THE STORY GETS MORE AND MORE 

17
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,692
INTERESTING AS WE GO ALONG.  

18
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,827
WE'LL BRING YOU THE DETAILS.  

19
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,328
HELLO EVERYONE.  

20
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:30,997
I'M ANNE-MARIE GREEN. 

21
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,633
THERE'S ANOTHER STORY BREAKING. 

22
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,734
MOLLIE TIBBETTS, THE BODY OF 

23
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,603
MOLLIE HAS BEEN FOUND.  

24
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,038
CBS NEWS LEARNED SHE HAS BEEN 

25
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:39,806
FOUND DEAD.  

26
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,908
SHE WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA 

27
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,376
STUDENT THAT WENT MISSING A 

28
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,311
MONTH AGO AFTER JOGGING IN AND 

29
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,813
AROUND HER HOMETOWN OF 

30
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,514
BROOKLYN, IOWA.  

31
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,850
WE NOW KNOW THAT HER BODY WAS 

32
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,653
FOUND SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY 

33
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,988
OF A NEARBY TOWN, ABOUT A 15 

34
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:55,588
MINUTE DRIVE AWAY.  

35
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,490
IT WAS FOUND EARLY THIS 

36
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:57,924
MORNING.  

37
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:01,060
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW.  

38
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,062
WE'RE WAITING MORE DETAILS FROM 

39
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:03,863
LAW ENFORCEMENT.  

40
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:11,271
A LITTLE EARLIER, VLAD AND I 

41
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,805
SPOKE TO FBI EMPLOYEE PROFILER 

42
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:13,740
ABOUT THIS.  

43
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,841
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 

44
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,876
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THE TOOLS 

45
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,877
INVESTIGATORS WILL USE TO USE 

46
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,647
AND TRACK HER DOWN.  

47
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,314
SADLY THE DISCUSSION BECOMES 

48
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:21,948
THE TOOLS INVESTIGATORS WILL 

49
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,516
USE WITH THE RECOVERY OF THE 

50
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:27,320
BODY TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT 

51
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,155
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HER. 

52
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,156
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.  

53
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,558
THERE WILL BE TWO 

54
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,594
INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING 

55
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,695
ON NOW.  

56
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:36,762
THE FIRST ONE, THEY'LL DO IT 

57
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,331
SIMULTANEOUS OF COURSE.  

58
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,434
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL COME 

59
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,936
IN AND DO THE AUTOPSY.  

60
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,937
THE WOUND PATHOLOGY WILL BE 

61
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:45,337
VERY IMPORTANT.  

62
00:01:45,337 --> 00:01:47,874
IT WILL BE UP TO THE MEDICAL 

63
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,708
EXAMINER TO DETERMINE IF MANNER 

64
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,344
AND CAUSE OF DEATH.  

65
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:59,419
THE MANNER OF DEATH WOULD BE 

66
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,053
HOMICIDE, SUICIDE, ACCIDENTAL, 

67
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,653
UNDETERMINED.  

68
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,756
IF IT'S A HOMICIDE, HOW WAS 

69
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,557
THAT CARRIED OUT. 

70
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,459
THAT'S LEFT UP TO THE MEDICAL 

71
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,627
EXAMINER WHO WILL ALSO DO OTHER 

72
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:14,067
KINDS OF TESTING IN AN EFFORT 

73
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:14,700
TO IDENTIFY FORENSIC EVIDENCE 

74
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,602
ON HER BODY.  

75
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,670
THEN AT THE SAME TIME, 

76
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,806
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE 

77
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,107
THOROUGHLY GOING THROUGH THE 

78
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:25,778
SCENE WHERE MOLLIE'S BODY WAS 

79
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,513
RECOVERED TO TRY TO DETERMINE 

80
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:29,716
AND IDENTIFY FORENSIC EVIDENCE 

81
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,683
FROM THAT SCENE. 

82
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,385
>> AND THE NATURE OF HOW SHE 

83
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,587
WAS KILLED, IF IT'S DETERMINED 

84
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,921
IT'S NOT SUICIDE OR ACCIDENTAL, 

85
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:41,427
THAT CAN TELL US A LOT ABOUT 

86
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:41,827
THE PERPETRATOR. 

87
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:45,665
>> YES, IT REALLY CAN BECAUSE 

88
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,200
UNLIKE WHAT'S ON TV SHOWS, WHEN 

89
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,106
SOMEONE IS THE VICTIM OF A 

90
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,374
HOMICIDE, THE OFFENDER WILL 

91
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,241
UNKNOWINGLY AND UNWITTINGLY 

92
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,542
OFTEN TIMES LEAVE FORENSIC 

93
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,446
EVIDENCE ON THE CLOTHING AND 

94
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:00,847
BODY.  

95
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,249
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE HOPE AND 

96
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,285
EFFORT TO RETRIEVE DNA FROM THE 

97
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:10,423
CLOTHING AND BODY AS WELL.  

98
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:15,661
NOW DNA IS AT A POINT IT'S 

99
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,395
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL 

100
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,031
IDENTIFYING OFFENDERS.  

101
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:22,735
THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT 

102
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,238
EFFORT TO OBTAIN AND PROCESS 

103
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:25,939
THAT FORENSIC EVIDENCE. 

104
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:30,976
>> YOU'RE A PROFILER, SO YOU 

105
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:32,911
KNOW THAT BEYOND DNA, THERE ARE 

106
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:36,849
OTHER SORT OF THINGS YOU CAN 

107
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,551
DEDUCE ABOUT WHO THIS PERSON 

108
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,554
MIGHT BE BASED ON HOW THEY'VE 

109
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,655
HANDLED THE BODY, BASED ON WHAT 

110
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:48,194
THE WOUNDS LOOK LIKE AND THAT 

111
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,229
SORT OF THING. 

112
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,798
>> THAT'S RIGHT.  

113
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,333
PENDING ON -- I DON'T MEAN MEAN 

114
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,366
TO BE TOO GRAPHIC, BUT 

115
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,669
DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF 

116
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:05,278
THE BODY, THEY'LL LOOK FOR 

117
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,880
DEFENSIVE INJURIES, POST MOR 

118
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,582
MORTEM MUTILATION.  

119
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,317
ANIMALS CAN LEAVE MARKS ON 

120
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,952
VICTIM'S BODIES IF THEY'RE LEFT 

121
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:13,453
OUTSIDE.  

122
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,755
THEY'LL HAVE TO SEPARATE THOSE 

123
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,689
TWO.  

124
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,326
THEY'LL DETERMINE IF IT IS A 

125
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,228
HOMICIDE, IF THAT WAS THE 

126
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,363
HOMICIDE SCENE AND BODY 

127
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,630
DISPOSAL SCENE.  

128
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,433
THAT'S ALSO TELLING.  

129
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,200
IF IT'S REALLY DETERMINED 

130
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,502
THAT'S ONLY WHERE MOLLIE'S BODY 

131
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,603
WAS LEFT, THEN WE HAVE A 

132
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,270
HOMICIDE SCENE.  

133
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,806
IF IT'S DETERMINED TO BE A 

134
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,507
HOMICIDE, THEN THERE'S ANOTHER 

135
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,842
SCENE OUT THERE THAT THEY'LL BE 

136
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,043
LOOKING FOR.  

137
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,779
AGAIN, ALL OF THOSE THINGS 

138
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,013
COLLECTIVELY CAN TELL US MORE 

139
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:43,216
ABOUT THE OFFENDER AND ALSO 

140
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,183
ABOUT THE MOTIVATION.  

141
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,185
I SHOULD SAY IF IT IS 

142
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,486
DETERMINED TO BE A HOMICIDE, 

143
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:51,791
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER WILL ALSO 

144
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,727
BE LOOKING FOR INDICATIONS OF 

145
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,495
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

146
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:56,629
. 

147
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,896
>>> WE'RE RETURNING TO 

148
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,198
FREDRICK, COLORADO WHERE YOU 

149
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,769
CAN SEE CHRISTOPHER WATTS IN 

150
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,305
COURT FOR HIS ARRAIGNMENT.

155
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,749
ADVANTAGE OF THAT RIGHT.  

156
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,084
ANY PLEA THAT YOU MAKE MUST BE 

157
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,752
MADE WHILE DETERMINING AND NOT 

158
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:23,122
THE RESULT OF UNDUE INFLUENCE 

159
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:23,489
OR COERCION.  

160
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,725
DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 

161
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:25,958
>> YES.

CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

WE'LL GO OVER THAT IN A MOMENT.

HE WAS STONE FACED.  

592
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,026
DIFFICULT TO READ HIS EMOTIONS. 

593

HE SAYS HE KILLED HIS WIFE BUT 

615
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,202
