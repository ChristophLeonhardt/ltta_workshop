following an attack in the cave of the patriarchs by an Israeli on Palestinians at this street of shops was shut down so this is in Hebron these are Palestinian stores that have been closed there was mass rioting after the attack on the Palestinians but the reason that these stores are closed apart from the riots is because this street is known as the street of martyrs martyrs Street or in Hebrew or for their people are the Israelis it's known as King David Street the interesting thing about these stores here that you can see that are shut down is that they are used as a kind of rat run so you can get in the front of the store if you need to escape because you've just stabbed somebody you can get out the back and the community will hide you I am so reminded of molenbeek the jihadi capital of Europe where the jihadis go and if they commit a terrorist attack this is where they can hide but if you look around these shops used to be full of fruits and vegetables this used to be a fruit store a laundry store over the roads as shopping a clothing store now this place is completely deserted completely shut down and the Supreme Court just upheld the ruling to keep this place shut in reality this is what division looks like in Hebron today here in Hebron these are the Palestinian stores closed down on martyrs row if you want to find out more of the troops that we're telling here in Israel joined the team at rebel Israel calm you
