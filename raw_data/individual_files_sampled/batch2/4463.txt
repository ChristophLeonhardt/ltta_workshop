the man is a pathological manipulator liar I didn't know that I didn't know him well but I know nothing bad about Michael Cohen until all of this started to happen in the last couple weeks good morning and welcome to am joy well the committee to protect the president is making the Sunday show round escalating their attacks on Donald Trump's former attorney and longtime fixer Michael Cohen who once said he'd rather jump off a building than turn on Trump most recent salvo began last night when Trump's current television attorney Rudy Giuliani accused Cohen of doctoring the audio recording of a conversation Cohen had with Trump about a payment to Playboy model Karen McDougal just before the 2016 election could be a recording of a recording we're not sure yet that they can probably determine I mean you're right we may never be able to determine that but we have determined the fact that he tampered with the tape in the sense that he had properly mid-conversation turned it off Giuliani also told ABC News quote we have complained to them that Cohen has violated the attorney-client privilege publicly and privately well in a statement to NBC News Lanny Davis Cohen's attorney fired back saying mr. Giuliani seems to have been confused seems to be confused he expressly waived attorney-client privilege last week and repeatedly and inaccurately as proven by the tape talked about and talked about the recording forfeiting all confidentiality joining me now is Timothy O'Bryan author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald Natacha bear Trond of the Atlantic Tara Dowdell of atarid al Dale group and michelle bernard of the bernard center for women politics and public policy thank you all for being here I'd have to start with my tutor of I'm calling I call you Trump whispers I don't know if at the title you want to cultivate but I'm gonna go ahead with it because there is this dynamic we're talking about it in the break I've essentially Trump bringing in new loyalists to attack the old loyalists I'm gonna start with you on this Tim of the full quote from Michael Cohen back in April of 2018 was he bragged that he would take a bullet for his client Donald Trump he said I'm the guy who protects the president and the family he then more recently offered he'd rather jump out of a building then turn on Donald Trump even after the president spurned his desire for a big White House job what is the dynamic between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen about I think two dogs in a burlap bag is what that time you haven't got about if you want to just talk about them specifically I think that's a larger issue of loyalty you know loyalty in in Trump Landy is a one-way street it all steers directly into Donald Trump's lap that he doesn't have much loyalty towards the people around him apart from his nuclear family his children sometimes his wives but not even often with his wives as we know yeah and I think I think what ends up happening is he doesn't build strong teams he doesn't build people who are authentically loyal to him everyone is transactional they're in there to see what they can get in the moment and Cohen it seems like up until now cultivated this idea that he was almost like family that he had this fierce one-way loyalty to Trump that he must have known was one way if you really believe that then why is he taping him I I think all of these tapes are little insurance policies that that Michael Kohn was drawing down in case Trump ever decided to throw him under the bus yeah which of course Trump ended up trying to do yeah you know Michael Cote is not a classic attorney he didn't carry out he didn't go to court for Donald Trump right he he went after Donald Trump's enemies and tried to defenestrate him Matt is the kind of lawyer Michael Kohn was and what you have now you know when Donald Trump tweeted I guess on Friday or Thursday what kind of lawyer or goes that go you know goes out and tapes his own client right well the kind of lawyer who does that is the is the lawyer as Donald Trump as a client yeah and knows that Donald Trump is going around telling everyone all the time I'm gonna take you yeah and there's a you know there's a classic story you know Donald Trump cultivated Roy Cohn the famous you know vicious lawyer and then promptly distance himself from him in the end when Roy Cohn was dying of AIDS he just dropped them like you know easily so there there is the sense that Trump really will just replace loyalists with new laws is that the dynamic that he's cultivated even in his since life I think absolutely and I think there's something important to remember because people will ask all the time well why do people keep coming back yeah why right that's a question I hear all the time I'll tell you why because Trump most likely in most instances attracts what he is many of the people who are around Trump are just like Trump they are on his coattails seeking power and fame and that need for that power and fame outweighs anything else it's why Julie Rudy Giuliani was spurned he wanted to be secretary right he thought he would be Secretary of State Trump not only threw him under the bus by not making him Secretary of State there all of his loyalty but he also made comments about Rudy Giuliani's appearance yeah and Rudy Giuliani still came back in his on TV because it's more about their wanting the power and fame and the platform that being close to Trump gives them I mean Sean Spicer Natasha is out with his new book literally he was humiliated by Donald Trump was summarily tossed out of the White House he hired scare butyou just I think to get rid of I mean he was not treated well he's still out there with a book that from what we heard about it still displays absolute loyalty Sam Nunn Byrd who was summarily dismissed from the Trump campaign was on Meet the Press just this morning and this is what he had to say about Michael Cohen somebody he knows very well for somebody like me who has defended Michael publicly I mean when he takes Lanny Davis out of the Clinton crypt and decides to start talking about Watergate releasing these tapes it's a bridge too far he is a friend of mine okay I'd like him personally once again I feel bad for what his family is going through but visa vie his professional relationship but the president this is I mean it's highly unethical if not uh if not you know being getting disbarred for what he did I mean I would have you the same number before he's been very honest and blunt about the ways that Donald Trump knifed him and but and yet there is this sort of you know dynamic of being more loyal to Donald Trump at least than they are to the other people in the circle absolutely and number was extremely emotional I mean in tears when Donald Trump dismissed him from the campaign he was extremely upset about this and when I talked to him the other day asking him about this revelation that Michael Cohen might come out and say that he actually not only knew about but approved the Trump Tower meeting Sam said well yeah probably he probably knew about it it's very very likely that during that speech when he previewed all of the dirt that was gonna go that he was gonna announce about Hillary Clinton that of course he was talking about the Trump Tower meeting but at the same time he said but who cares it really doesn't matter because emails weren't discussed during the meeting I said well how do you know he said well it's just clear that nothing really came up the meeting so even if he did you know talk even if he did approve of this meaning then you know it's not really a big deal and it's that kind of he's making excuses for the president in a way that we've seen around all of by all of Trump's allies you know who have been trying to kind of discount this the idea that Trump approved of this meeting with the oceans to get this dirt it is interesting Michelle because you know we talk a lot about the religious right sticking with Donald Trump through thick and thin and not caring for them you know they believe that he is bringing about policy than in their mind is Pro conservative Christian and so they just don't care about anything else so they at least some you know ideological reason for sticking with him no matter what when you when it comes to these people though these are not ideologues a lot of them aren't even Republicans let alone conservatives a lot of them were known for a long time to actually be Democrats I'm not sure about Cohen but I don't think any of these people were Republicans and now their new tag is to attack Lanny Davis a Democrat who was in the Clinton I think Donald Trump supported Bill Clinton through the impeachment period here they are now attacking somebody who's probably more ideologically aligned with this with the former crew then then then the new crew take a listen he's almost as bad as Cohen I mean he said that Cohen didn't intend to deceive when he did these tape recordings what is it to take a phone put it in a drawer and tell somebody you're not recording them if it isn't an intent to deceive I mean these people tell Clinton like lies lies they could be contradicted by tape recording your thoughts well I don't even know where to begin I guess what i'll start with is number one i actually used to work with lanny davis we were both at the same law for many years ago during the time period where he represented the Clintons he is an exceptional lawyer absolutely exceptional number one number two the president has told so many lies over the last 16 months that I don't even know if it's possible to continue to count them it's absolutely impossible and then to attack you know you'll notice that Rudy Giuliani did not deny anything that Michael Cohen said all he did was attack him attack his character but there was no denial there and I think that in and of itself speaks volumes does he not contradict often times he confirms whatever the bad thing is from in a court of law he confirms it and then he I don't really know what's happening well I think was like last week he he waived the privilege on those tapes then he said that the tapes were exculpatory that they helped the president and now over the weekend he's saying that you know Michael Cohen did committed some horrific act it might have been criminal conduct in in releasing those tapes and they want to get to the bottom of who who released the tapes Lanny Davis says he didn't release the tapes quite frankly I believe Lanny Davis yeah I still have questions also about Rudy Giuliani's both during the campaign that he had sources in the New York FBI that somehow he seemed to have really a lot of knowledge about the investigation taylor clinton but that what will have to do that for another show a team i want to come back to this as a strategic matter because if this idea of finding new loyalists to attack the old loyalists if it is strategy it is strange strategy because the old loyalists in this case cohen why would you tape things to exculpate yourself not right and cohen not only had it is that someone who apparently frequently taped his clients and taped people he has said that there were other people in the room when he heard Donald Trump be told in advance about the infamous Trump Tower meeting several along with Cohen alleges that he was present along with several other what Trump was informed all but Muller has to do is is bring others he's not gonna rely on Michael cones testimony alone he's presenting he's gathering evidence that he can present to a jury to show a fact pattern that shows culpability and willful misbehavior and we know that when Donald Trump jr. took the meeting in Trump Tower Jared Kushner was aware of it and Paul Manafort was aware of it right we also know that through the entire history of the Trump Organization none of those children said boo without running upstairs and getting their father's approval and that's the way that company ran and that was a significant development Donald Trump jr. was excited about it perhaps he didn't tell his father but it sort of beggars the imagination that he didn't like the other thing I think about in terms of trying to sort out all of these whether it's a strategy or not as you can't discount the fact that this is a highly unsophisticated ill-informed morally rudderless group of people who can't shoot straight and aren't very bright and they're now colliding off each other like pin balls I think from I'm putting my lawyer hat on from a strategic point of view if you think about this in a sane manner which is what you and the panel are doing today you absolutely don't understand what Rudy Giuliani is doing but if you put on a different hat and you think to yourself that his job right now is not to please any of us but is to represent his client zealously and that's what he's doing yeah there is a strategy I guarantee you that no one in the Giuliani can't believe that the president will ever be impeached or indicted and every statement that he makes about Michael Cohen every statement that he makes about Bob Muller about Comey about Hillary Clinton this is all about the president's base and getting the president re-elected in 2020 and getting Republicans in the House in 2016 because Donald Trump's base does not care about any of this they don't care about his infidelity they don't care about his lies and they will they are able to sit back and say oh yes he hired you know somebody who was related to the Clintons and he's awful and they're out to get my man they're out to get our president that's the strategy in this yeah so the only person that people are talking about impeaches rod Rosen Stein right rod Rosenstock back to the Republican the Committee to Protect the presidents we call them on the show are talking about impeaching on thank you Timothy O'Bryan Natasha Bergeron Tara Dowdell Michelle Bernard are sticking around and coming up every day it seems every day we're hearing more and more and more horrific stories of children separated from their families by the Trump
