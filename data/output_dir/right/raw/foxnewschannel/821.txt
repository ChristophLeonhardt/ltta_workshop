TUCKER CARLSON IS UP NEXT

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,224
>> GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:17,958
TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.

6
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:18,959
THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN OF

7
00:00:18,959 --> 00:00:21,928
THE BORDER HAS SINCE, IT CEASED

8
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,531
TO BE A NEWS STORY, IT NOW SEEMS

9
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,333
TO BE A COMPETITION TO SEE WHO

10
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:30,737
CAN REACH GREATER HEIGHTS OF

11
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,539
RHETORICAL SUCCESS AND

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,573
SELF-RIGHTEOUS POSTURING.

13
00:00:33,573 --> 00:00:34,341
NANCY PELOSI AND EVEN

14
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:35,342
HILLARY CLINTON TOOK AN EARLY

15
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:38,745
LEAD IN THE CONTEST BY BYPASSING

16
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:42,415
PUBLIC POLICY QUESTIONS ENTIRELY

17
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:44,784
AND MOVING STRAIGHT TO THEOLOGY.

18
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:47,721
>> THE HYPOCRISY OF ALL PEOPLE

19
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:52,559
IN OUR COUNTRY NOT TO CLAMBER

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,260
FOR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,200
DOING TO END.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,004
THOSE WHO JUSTIFY CENTRAL TENET

23
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:04,538
OF CHRISTIANITY.

24
00:01:04,538 --> 00:01:06,106
JESUS SAID SUFFER THE LITTLE

25
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:07,707
CHILDREN ONTO ME.

26
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:11,111
HE DID NOT SAY LOVE THE CHILDREN

27
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:11,444
SUFFER.

28
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:12,612
>> Sandra: 'S OF THE SAME

29
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:14,948
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THE THIRD

30
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,583
TERM POST-VIABILITY ABORTION FOR

31
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,753
PURPOSES OF SELECTION ARE NOW

32
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,222
LECTURING YOU ABOUT GOD AND SIN

33
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,357
AND THE HOLINESS OF

34
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:24,724
CHILDREN.

35
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:25,759
FEEL CHASTENED?

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,162
BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE.

37
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,597
ON FACEBOOK, BEN SASSE CALLED

38
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:32,632
THE ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY

39
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,734
WICKED AS AN IMMORAL AND

40
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:35,602
DEVILISH.

41
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:37,637
FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH LIKENED IT

42
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:42,242
TO THE INTERNAL AND MICHAEL

43
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:43,710
HAYDEN WENT ALL THE WAY.

44
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,045
HE PRINTED OUT A PICTURE OF

45
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,781
AUSCHWITZ DEATH CAMP AND

46
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,182
COMPARED THAT TO THE.

47
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:50,750
AFTER SOBERING UP, HE WALKED TO

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,552
THAT BACK A LITTLE BIT ON

49
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,588
TELEVISION, BUT NOT MUCH.

50
00:01:54,588 --> 00:01:58,091
>> I KNOW WE ARE NOT, GERMANY.

51
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:03,530
BUT THERE'S A COMMONALITY THERE.

52
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,497
A MORE CIVILIZED PEOPLE YOU

53
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:05,332
CANNOT FIND.

54
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,801
SO I WAS TRYING TO POINT OUT, WE

55
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,336
NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO MOVE

56
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,839
IN THAT DIRECTION.

57
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,407
>> Tucker: WE COULD GO ON,

58
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:16,576
THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE JUST LIKE

59
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:17,344
THAT.

60
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:19,679
THE RICH AND POWERFUL REMINDING

61
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,981
YOU JUST HOW VIRTUOUS THEY ARE.

62
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,750
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THESE PEOPLE

63
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,951
REALLY CARE ABOUT FAMILY

64
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:25,352
SEPARATION?

65
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,354
IF THEY DID, THEY WOULD BE

66
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:28,755
WORRIED ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF

67
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:29,756
THE AMERICAN FAMILY WHICH IS

68
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:30,957
MEASURABLE AND REAL CAMP BUT

69
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:32,759
THEY ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

70
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,361
THEY WILL NOT COLLAPSE BECAUSE

71
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,429
STRONG FAMILIES ARE AN

72
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,130
IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR POLITICAL

73
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,465
POWER AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE

74
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:41,801
ALWAYS LECTURING YOU ABOUT THE

75
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,370
PATRIARCHY AND THE EVIL OF THE

76
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:43,903
AMERICAN FAMILY.

77
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,538
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

78
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:47,874
CHILDREN ARE GROWING UP WITH ONE

79
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,742
PARENT AT HOME.

80
00:02:48,742 --> 00:02:50,944
MANY OF THOSE KIDS BY THE WAY

81
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,812
HAVE A PARENT BEHIND BARS.

82
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,347
NOT JUST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO

83
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:55,982
ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR

84
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,118
CHILDREN, BUT THE MAJORITY OF

85
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:00,787
AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PRISON HAVE

86
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:02,922
MINOR KIDS THAT THEY HAVE LEFT

87
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:03,723
BEHIND.

88
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:05,358
THEY'VE BEEN SEPARATED BECAUSE

89
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,360
THEY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME.

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,528
SO IN A WAY THESE KIDS ARE JUST

91
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,096
LIKE THE KIDS ON TELEVISION

92
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:11,564
TODAY BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THEY

93
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,600
ARE AMERICANS, SO NOBODY IS

94
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,734
SPENDING 35 GRAND PER YEAR

95
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,470
APIECE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE

96
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,105
OKAY.

97
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,340
POLITICIANS AND CABLE NEWS

98
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,307
ANCHORS DON'T VISIT THE FOSTER

99
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,343
HOMES TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR PLATE,

100
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:27,113
THEY ARE IGNORED.

101
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,948
THEY CARE FAR MORE ABOUT

102
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,116
FOREIGNERS THAN THEIR OWN

103
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:30,450
PEOPLE.

104
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,751
THE OTHER THING YOU MAY HAVE

105
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,287
NOTICED IS THEY ARE NOT

106
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:34,888
ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN

107
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:37,891
SOLUTIONS TO ANYTHING.

108
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:38,692
THEY ARE GREAT AT YELLING AND

109
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:44,698
PREENING BUT NOT SO MUCH AT

110
00:03:44,698 --> 00:03:45,031
FIXING.

111
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:49,335
WE COULD EVEN BUILD MORE HOUSING

112
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:50,603
FACILITIES TO ALLOW FAMILIES TO

113
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:53,239
STAY TOGETHER WHILE THEY ARE

114
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,340
ASYLUM CLAIMS ARE PROCESSED.

115
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,109
THE LEFT IS NOT INTERESTED IN

116
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:58,144
ANY OF THAT, THEIR ONLY SOLUTION

117
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,145
IS IMMEDIATE AMNESTY FOR ANYONE

118
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:01,347
THAT CROSSES OUR BORDERS WITH A

119
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:02,449
MINOR IN TOTAL.

120
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:05,819
AT THE SAME AS NO BORDERS AT

121
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,086
ALL.

122
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:10,657
THAT'S A POWERFUL INCENTIVE FOR

123
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,158
CHILD SMUGGLING.

124
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,661
LOTS OF PEOPLE YELLING AT YOU ON

125
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:15,628
TV DON'T EVEN HAVE CHILDREN SO

126
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,596
DON'T FOR A SECOND LET THEM TAKE

127
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:18,565
THE MORAL HIGH GROUND.

128
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:19,866
THEIR GOAL IS TO CHANGE YOUR

129
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:22,368
COUNTRY FOREVER AND THEY ARE

130
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,404
SUCCEEDING BY THE WAY.

131
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,139
SINCE 2014, TO NAME ONE EXAMPLE,

132
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,175
AT LEAST HALF A MILLION CENTRAL

133
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:31,878
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN RELEASED

134
00:04:31,878 --> 00:04:35,148
INSIDE OF OUR BORDERS.

135
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:38,017
DID ANYONE VOTE FOR THAT?

136
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,754
THE KIDS ON OUR -- IN THE

137
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:42,956
NEIGHBORHOODS LOOK LIKE THEY DID

138
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:43,289
IN 1960.

139
00:04:43,289 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE IS NO COST TO THEM.
