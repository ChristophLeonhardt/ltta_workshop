1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:01,962
WITH JUAN WILLIAMS,

2
00:00:01,962 --> 00:00:09,069
JESSE WATTERS, DANA PERINO.

3
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:11,939
"THE FIVE" ."

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:13,574
SOMEONE IN NORTH KOREA READ "THE

5
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,743
ART OF THE DEAL."

6
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,177
BECAUSE NORTH KOREA IS

7
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:18,946
THREATENING TO CANCEL NEXT

8
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:20,547
MONTH'S SUMMIT BETWEEN

9
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:21,281
KIM JONG UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

10
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,385
OVER MILITARY DRILLS GOING ON

11
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:25,753
RIGHT NOW INVOLVING THE U.S. AND

12
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:26,387
SOUTH KOREA.

13
00:00:26,387 --> 00:00:28,589
>> Greg: THAT IS SO DONALD.

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,057
IT SHOCKED THE MEDIA.

15
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:32,058
IF YOU READ ONE SENTENCE FROM

16
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,261
TRUMP'S BOOK, YOU WOULD KNOW

17
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:36,196
THAT NEGOTIATIONS DON'T PROCEED

18
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,431
WITHOUT SUCH ANTICS.

19
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:38,198
MORE WILL COME.

20
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:39,900
IT IS NOT LIKE TRUMP DIDN'T

21
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,036
PREPARE YOU FOR IT.

22
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:45,372
>> WE ARE MOVING ALONG VERY

23
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:46,407
NICELY WITH NORTH KOREA.

24
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:47,775
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

25
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:49,176
IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME, MANY,

26
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:50,778
MANY DECADES TO GET HERE.

27
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:51,779
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

28
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,981
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL, AS YOU

29
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:54,982
KNOW, I NORTH KOREA.

30
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:58,052
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

31
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,219
WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING.

32
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,521
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

33
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:05,592
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

34
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:06,994
WE'LL SEE.

35
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:07,461
TIME WILL TELL.

36
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,096
>> Greg: WE'LL SEE WHAT

37
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:09,763
HAPPENS.

38
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:11,465
THAT MONTAGE WAS FOR THOSE WHO

39
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:14,168
THINK TRUMP IS BEING PLAYED OR

40
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,603
BETTER HE LOOKS OUT FOR THEM

41
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:19,373
BRINGS WORLD PEACE, RIGHT,

42
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:19,673
MEDIA?

43
00:01:19,673 --> 00:01:21,775
>> UTTERLY PREDICTABLE.

44
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,644
THE PRESIDENT WAS SO EAGER TO

45
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:24,344
ACCEPT THE TERMS BEFORE THE

46
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,612
TEAMS WERE SPELLED OUT.

47
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:27,414
>> IS A POSSIBLE KIM JONG UN

48
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:28,615
REALIZES HE'S GOT EVERYTHING

49
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,217
HE'S ALREADY WANTED WHICH IS

50
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:31,952
RECOGNITION ON THE WORLD STAGE.

51
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:34,755
>> DID PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKE UP

52
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:36,190
MISTAKEN AS OPTIMISM IN HIS

53
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,793
UPCOMING SUMMIT?

54
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:40,761
>> Greg: WET BLANKETS.

55
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:43,163
WE COME AT THIS WITH HEAVY

56
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:43,564
SKEPTICISM.

57
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,966
WITH TRUMP, WE TRUSTEE IS NOT

58
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,168
FULL OF ROSY OPTIMISM DRIVEN BY

59
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:49,770
A SELFISH LEGACY.

60
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,839
HE WIELDS A REALISTIC, NOT JUST

61
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:53,240
A YUMMY CARROT.

62
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,209
THE REASONS TO BE OPTIMISTIC,

63
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,009
EVEN WITH THE NORTH KOREAN

64
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:56,577
THREATS.

65
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,412
I WOULD BE MORE UNCERTAIN

66
00:01:58,412 --> 00:01:59,179
WITHOUT SUCH THREATS.

67
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:00,614
IT IS A SIGN OF ENGAGEMENT.

68
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,282
GRANTED, FOR THIS DEAL TO

69
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:03,450
HAPPEN, YOU HAVE TO THINK BIG

70
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,452
AND BELIEVE YOU CAN ACTUALLY

71
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:05,853
PULL IT OFF.

72
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,989
TAKE A WAY SMALLER ACHIEVEMENT,

73
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,056
A MANHATTAN ATTRACTION THAT

74
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:11,191
LANGUISHED FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE

75
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,193
CITY COULDN'T GET IT RUNNING.

76
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,595
TRUMP GOT INVOLVED AND IN

77
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:16,797
MONTHS, HE TURNED IT INTO A

78
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:17,431
WILDLY POPULAR TOURIST

79
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,832
ATTRACTION.

80
00:02:18,832 --> 00:02:19,600
WHY DOES THAT HAPPEN?

81
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,567
BECAUSE SOME GUY THOUGHT HE

82
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,401
COULD DO IT.

83
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,303
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER

84
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:24,104
OF POSITIVE THINKING ESPECIALLY

85
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,105
COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS

86
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:28,142
THE GOOD GUY FROM THE BAD AND

87
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,443
HOW TO SPEAK BOTH THEIR

88
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:30,444
LANGUAGES.

89
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,146
HAVEN'T WE SEEN RESULTS ALREADY?

90
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,447
TODAY NORTH KOREA THREATENED TO

91
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:34,181
CANCEL A MEETING.

92
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,616
MONTHS AGO THEY WERE THREATENING

93
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,550
TO NUKE US.

94
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,488
I CALL THAT PROGRESS.

95
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:43,423
DAN, DANA, DANA.

96
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,892
>> Dana: WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

97
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:45,793
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS, I THINK

98
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:48,262
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.

99
00:02:48,262 --> 00:02:50,330
WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT

100
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,765
KIM JONG UN BECAUSE IT'S CALLED

101
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,600
THE HERMIT KINGDOM FOR A REASON.

102
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,335
AND I DO THINK THERE'S GOING TO

103
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:56,603
BE SOME CURVEBALLS ALONG THE

104
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:57,371
WAY.

105
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,006
I DO THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

106
00:02:59,006 --> 00:02:59,573
BEEN PRETTY CAUTIOUS.

107
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,176
HE HAS BEEN OPTIMISTIC AND

108
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:02,910
THROWING SOME COLD WATER ON IT

109
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,578
AT THE SAME TIME.

110
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,246
ALMOST EVERYTHING HE SAYS, NOT

111
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:06,780
EVERY TIME.

112
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,048
IF THERE'S CRITICISM ABOUT THAT

113
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,818
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

114
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,019
TOTALITY OF THE STATEMENTS OVER

115
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,555
A PERIOD OF TIME, HE'S BEEN, WE

116
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:14,922
WILL SEE.

117
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:18,826
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

118
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:19,760
>> Jesse: WE HAD A LOT ON THE

119
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,830
CUTTING ROOM FLOOR I THINK.

120
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,931
>> Dana: I DON'T THINK THE

121
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:26,567
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO OVERREACT

122
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,534
BECAUSE THEY NORTH KOREANS NEED

123
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,436
THE SUMMIT A LOT MORE THAN

124
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:30,003
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES.

125
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,340
HE CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT.

126
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,375
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS

127
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:40,447
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S OR

128
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:41,081
APPROACH DEALING WITH IRAN

129
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:45,686
BECAUSE PRESIDENT OBAMA LOOKED

130
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:47,955
MORE DESPERATE THAN THE IRANIANS

131
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:48,689
MORE DESPERATE THAN THE IRANIAN

132
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,623
IRANIANS.

133
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:50,991
IT LOOKED LIKE WE WERE MORE

134
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,593
INTERESTED IN GETTING THIS DONE

135
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:53,794
AND RUSHING THROUGH THE END.

136
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:56,563
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING HERE.

137
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,066
THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND YEAR

138
00:03:59,066 --> 00:03:59,666
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

139
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,368
THE OTHER KEY FACTOR HERE IS THE

140
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,369
SOUTH KOREANS.

141
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,837
I KNOW THAT THE CHINESE ARE

142
00:04:03,837 --> 00:04:05,205
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

143
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,407
SOUTH KOREANS WANT THIS MORE

144
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:07,841
THAN ANYTHING.

145
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,842
PRESIDENT MOON IS GOING TO BE

146
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,244
COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON

147
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:11,044
TUESDAY, SO THE PRESIDENT WILL

148
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,380
HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET WITH HIM

149
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:13,814
FACE-TO-FACE.

150
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:15,515
I DO THINK IT WAS A GOOD THING

151
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:16,783
THAT PRESIDENT MOON SAID WE ARE

152
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:19,185
NOT GOING TO STOP THESE DRILLS

153
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:20,420
WITH THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE

154
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,457
THAT SAYS TO KIM JONG UN THAT

155
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:24,424
HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO

156
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:27,261
THE TABLE, AND I BET HE WILL.

157
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,329
>> Greg: JESSE, DO YOU HAVE

158
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,397
ANY THEORIES BEHIND THIS?

159
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,199
>> Jesse: I DO.

160
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,500
THEY DON'T INVOLVE DENNIS

161
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,735
RODMAN.

162
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:36,603
I THINK HE IS FLEXING, POSTURING

163
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:38,805
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE MAXIMUM

164
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:39,773
PRESSURE DIDN'T BRING HIM TO THE

165
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:42,442
NEGOTIATING TABLE BUT IT DID

166
00:04:42,442 --> 00:04:43,310
BECAUSE WE HAD UNILATERAL

167
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,382
SANCTIONS WE SLAPPED ON.

168
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:49,883
MAKING THE BLOCKADE OVER CERTAIN

169
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:50,384
VESSELS.

170
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:52,386
THE FUNERAL WAS DRYING UP.

171
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:54,254
LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

172
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,656
THAT WAS ALL GOOD, THE TRUTH OF

173
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:58,025
WHY THIS HAS HAPPENED.

174
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,526
YES, HE DID SAY SOME GOOD

175
00:04:59,526 --> 00:04:59,860
THINGS.

176
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,628
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE

177
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:02,796
HOSTAGES BACK.

178
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,831
WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY THIS

179
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:07,434
NUCLEAR TESTING SITE.

180
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,135
SATELLITE IMAGERY PROVES IT'S

181
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,970
BEING DECOMMISSIONED.

182
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,104
COULD BE AN ACCIDENT THAT

183
00:05:11,104 --> 00:05:14,207
DECOMMISSIONED IT.

184
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,009
GOOD THINGS WERE HAPPENING.

185
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,579
I DON'T LIKE THE MEDIA COMING IN

186
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,581
NOW ALMOST IN GLEE THAT THERE IS

187
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,583
A HICK UP TOWARDS PEACE JUST TO

188
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,085
HURT THE PRESIDENT.

189
00:05:25,085 --> 00:05:27,254
TO ACT LIKE THAT PRESIDENT HAS

190
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:31,325
BEEN PUNKED WHEN I THINK THE

191
00:05:31,325 --> 00:05:32,125
LAST COUPLE PRESIDENTS HAVE

192
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:32,426
BEEN.

193
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,228
TRUMP GAVE UP NOTHING.

194
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:36,196
HE SAID ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN.

195
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:38,899
HE SAYS SOMETHING INTERESTING

196
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:41,468
ABOUT JOHN BOLTON.

197
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:43,470
HE SAID JOHN BOLTON WAS

198
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,004
REPUGNANT.

199
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:44,771
>> Dana: KIM JONG UN SAID

200
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,173
THAT, NOT THE PRESIDENT.

201
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:46,773
>> Jesse: YES.

202
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,475
THIS IS A GUY WHO BURNED HIS

203
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:51,778
UNCLE IN ACID.

204
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:53,847
TO CALL HIM REPUGNANT WAS

205
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:54,247
HILARIOUS.

206
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,783
>> I WOULD WEAR THAT LIKE A

207
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:57,250
BADGE OF HONOR.

208
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,987
IF KIM JONG UN CALLED ME

209
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:02,189
REPUGNANT, I WOULD PUT IT ON A

210
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:02,489
SHIRT.

211
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,091
HE >> Jesse: SAYING THAT WE

212
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:04,992
SHOULD DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA

213
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:07,627
LIKE WE DID IN LIBYA.

214
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:08,328
LIBYA GAVE THEIR NUCLEAR STUFF

215
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,596
TO US AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS

216
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:11,932
LATER WE INVADED AND KILLED THEM

217
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:12,466
LATER WE INVADED AND KILLED THE

218
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,033
THEM.

219
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:17,004
WE LEAD FROM BEHIND.

220
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,406
>> Greg: I TRUST YOU ENJOYED

221
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,774
THIS VIEW MUCH BETTER.

222
00:06:20,774 --> 00:06:21,141
[LAUGHTER]

223
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:33,186
>> WELL PLAYED.

224
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:33,387
>> WELL PLAYED.

225
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,087
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON ALL THIS.

226
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:34,788
>> I DON'T THINK THE SUMMIT IS

227
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,389
THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL.

228
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:36,089
THE SUMMIT IS A GOOD PHOTO OP.

229
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:36,790
YOU SEE THEM SHAKING HANDS AND

230
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,457
THEY ARE SITTING DOWN AT THE

231
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:37,758
TABLE.

232
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:38,492
I THINK KIM JONG UN THOUGHT HE

233
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,193
WAS HOLDING ALL THE CARDS.

234
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:41,228
YOU COULD SAY I DON'T LIKE

235
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:42,763
BOLTON I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS

236
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,398
IF YOU EXPECT ME TO DISARM.

237
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:46,033
HE IS NOT HOLDING THE CARDS

238
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:46,700
ANYMORE BECAUSE HE'S DEALING

239
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,502
WITH SOMEONE WHO WAS A PRETTY

240
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,370
STRONG HISTORY OF BEING A TOUGH

241
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:50,771
NEGOTIATOR.

242
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:53,707
I WANT TO REMIND THE MEDIA WHEN

243
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:55,175
YOU'RE PRESIDENT IS GOING UP

244
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,109
AGAINST KIM JONG UN, YOU SHOULD

245
00:06:56,109 --> 00:07:01,381
BE ROOTING FOR YOUR PRESIDENT.

246
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,683
NOT SURPRISING THEIR BEHAVIOR.

247
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:04,985
I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS DOING

248
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,588
EXACTLY WHAT HE SHOULD BE DOING.

249
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,023
UNFETTERED AND SAY MY END GOAL

250
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:10,424
IS THE SAME.

251
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:13,760
I'M GOING TO BE TOUGH ON YOU.

252
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,663
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP TALKING

253
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:17,464
ABOUT YOU AND HUMAN RIGHTS

254
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:17,864
VIOLATIONS.

255
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,934
I'M GOING TO STAY TRUE TO

256
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:21,401
AMERICAN VALUES.

257
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:23,403
THAT'S THE BEST HE CAN DO.

258
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:24,037
IF THE SUMMIT DOESN'T HAVE

259
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:27,474
EMPLOYER NOT GOING TO CHANGE OUR

260
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:28,175
PHILOSOPHY BECAUSE WE ARE THE

261
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,577
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

262
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,179
>> Greg: JUAN, YOU ARE TELLING

263
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,247
ME IN THE GREEN ROOM THAT IN A

264
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:35,916
SENSE DONALD TRUMP ALREADY WON.

265
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,818
[LAUGHTER]

266
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,020
>> Juan: I THINK THAT WAS

267
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,393
REPUGNANT.

268
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:48,862
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM STRUCK BY IS

269
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:50,230
THAT YOU GUYS SAY IT IS THE

270
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,165
LIBERAL PRESS THAT SEEMS TO BE

271
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,600
THE LIGHTING IN THE MOMENT OR

272
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,168
SUGGESTION THAT THIS MIGHT NOT

273
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:55,535
COME OFF.

274
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:58,171
TO MY MIND, IT'S THE

275
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:58,905
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA THAT WAS SO

276
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,774
QUICK TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS

277
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:01,775
GUY IS GOING TO GET A NOBEL

278
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:04,010
PEACE PRIZE.

279
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,579
THIS WILL BE HIS SIGNATURE

280
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:06,813
FOREIGN AFFAIRS A COMPLIMENT.

281
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:07,581
SEEMS TO ME LIKE THAT WAS A

282
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:10,784
LITTLE BIT PREMATURE.

283
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,085
I THINK HE'S HAD A TOUGH WEEK.

284
00:08:12,085 --> 00:08:13,186
I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

285
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:16,389
AGREED UPON AT THIS TABLE BUT

286
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,324
YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

287
00:08:17,324 --> 00:08:18,892
THIS WEEK IN TERMS OF PULLING

288
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,594
OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL WHICH IS

289
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:22,729
NOT POPULAR WITH THE AMERICAN

290
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,033
PEOPLE.

291
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:27,934
THE EFFORT TO MOVE THE EMBASSY

292
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:32,572
TO JERUSALEM, LOTS OF DEATH.

293
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:33,740
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

294
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,308
>> BY HAMAS.

295
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,412
>> Greg: I LIKE YOUR CHAMPION.

296
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,313
>> Juan: I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

297
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:40,847
YOU GUYS ARE SMART.

298
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:44,618
THE THIRD POINT IS THE THING

299
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:45,285
ABOUT THE CHINESE COMPANY.

300
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,387
HE'S OFF ON HIS OWN.

301
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,156
WHAT'S GOING ON?

302
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:49,823
HERE COMES THIS MOMENT AND I

303
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:55,529
AGREE WITH YOU, AMERICANS SHOULD

304
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:57,264
BE ROOTING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

305
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:58,231
TO DO SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE

306
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,432
NORTH KOREA IS A THREAT TO WORLD

307
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:01,034
PEACE.

308
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,803
HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

309
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,472
BUT THE THING ABOUT IT IS, AND

310
00:09:05,472 --> 00:09:07,607
THIS IS MY CONCERN.

311
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:09,209
I THINK WORLD LEADERS THINK THEY

312
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,010
CAN PLAY DONALD TRUMP.

313
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,847
THEY CAN GIVE HIM A BIG PARADE.

314
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:14,381
FLATTER HIM.

315
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,616
TELL HIM THEY LOVE --

316
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:17,350
>> Greg: EXAMPLES ABOUT ISRAEL

317
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,752
AND IRAN.

318
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:23,823
IT'S A CONTRADICTION.

319
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:26,026
THOSE SHOW THAT YOU CAN'T.

320
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:28,428
THE PARIS TREATY.

321
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:30,130
>> Dana: I WAS GOING TO SAY

322
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,167
ONE EXAMPLE WAS THE YOU HAD

323
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:34,834
MACRON AND ANGELA MERKEL AND

324
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,870
BORIS JOHNSON.

325
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,371
THEY SAID PLEASE DON'T PULL OUT

326
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,341
OF THE IRAN DEAL AND HE DID IT

327
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,210
ANYWAY.

328
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,611
THE SAME CAST OF CHARACTERS AND

329
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,745
MORE ON THE PARIS CLAIMANT

330
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:50,584
ACCORD IS KIND OF THE SAME DEAL.

331
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:51,952
SLATTERY MIGHT GET YOU GOOD

332
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:52,919
PRESS WITH THE PRESIDENT BUT IT

333
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,821
DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET YOU THE

334
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:56,289
RESULTS YOU WANT.

335
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:59,559
>> Juan: I THINK IN THIS CASE

336
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,630
THE CONSERVATIVE MEDIA, BEING SO

337
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,431
HUNGRY FOR THE NOBEL PRIZE.

338
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,432
KIM JONG UN IS SAYING IF THAT IS

339
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,067
THE CASE, HE DOESN'T WANT TO

340
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:07,667
MISS THIS MEETING.

341
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,203
HE NEEDS IT MORE THAN I DO.

342
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,073
THEREFORE IF I SAY CANCEL YOUR

343
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,007
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES,

344
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:14,708
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE UNDER

345
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,809
PRESSURE TO DO IT.

346
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,043
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

347
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,645
>> Jesse: WE ARE NOT HUNGRY

348
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,213
FOR THE PEACE PRIZE.

349
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:20,814
WE ARE HUNGRY FOR PEACE.

350
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:23,717
IT'S A NICE TROPHY TO SHOVE IN

351
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:27,220
THE LEFT'S FACE.

352
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,887
OBAMA'S PEACE PRIZE WAS A

353
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,191
PARTICIPATION TROPHY.

354
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:33,026
>> Jedediah: YOU COULD ARGUE

355
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:34,194
THAT GETTING PLAYED WAS SIGNING

356
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:35,595
ONTO A DEAL LIKE THE IRAN DEAL

357
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,430
WHICH ENDED UP HELPING THEM I

358
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,632
WAS A MINOR BAND-AID

359
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:39,032
TEMPORARILY.

360
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:41,735
>> Dana: CAN I ADD ONE LAST

361
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,770
THING.

362
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,471
THE ISSUE OF DENUCLEARIZATION

363
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:48,441
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS A KEY

364
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,377
ISSUE.

365
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:51,778
I COME THAT'S WHY I'M SKEPTICAL

366
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:54,080
IF THERE WILL ACTUALLY BE IN

367
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,182
AGREEMENT.

368
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,183
>> Jesse: ADVISED TIME.

369
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:59,185
DENUCLEARIZATION IN 15 YEARS.

370
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,687
MEANWHILE HE HIDES ALL OF THE

371
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:02,389
SITES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IN TEN

372
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:03,790
YEARS, HE HAS NUCLEAR

373
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,224
CAPABILITIES.

374
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:05,725
>> Dana: IF WE ARE GOING TO

375
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,227
GIVE ECONOMIC AID, I WANT TO

376
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,429
