1
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,900
In 2017, the U.S. saw
some of the strongest

2
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,180
and most expensive
storms in history.

3
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,600
And climate experts say

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,619
that as global temperatures
continue to rise,

5
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:32,479
things will only get worse,
and more costly.

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,890
“If you increase the ocean temperatures,

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,830
you will increase how strong
hurricanes can become.

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,410
That’s unequivocal.”

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,230
And as these storms strengthen,
the astronomical costs

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,050
associated with
them will rise, too.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,450
How much are we talking here?

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,210
The superstorms and
wildfires of 2017

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,840
cost the U.S. a 
record-breaking $306 billion.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,427
To put that into perspective,

15
00:00:53,427 --> 00:00:56,010
that's more than triple the amount 
that the federal government

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,010
spends on education in a year.

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,840
This warmer climate also enables
fires to burn larger areas.

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,920
In 2017 the U.S. Forest Service
spent over 50 percent of its budget

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,180
putting out fires, and it can no
longer keep up with the costs.

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,020
So we’re already paying
big for climate change.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,600
But as these storms help sink
the U.S. further into debt,

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,060
the Trump administration
is dismantling policy

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,040
and reducing
funding that’s aimed

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,910
at mitigating these problems.

25
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,070
“Since my very first
day in office,

26
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,240
I have been moving
at record pace

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,160
to cancel these regulations
and to eliminate

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,170
the barriers to domestic energy
production like never before.”

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,790
The Trump administration
has sought

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,070
to reverse at least 60
environmental rules

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,350
that it sees as overly
burdensome

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,690
to the fossil fuel industry.

33
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:48,060
“Politicians almost at any level,
it seems, struggle with the concept

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,430
that yes, you have
this big expense now,

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,570
for mitigation, but it’s 
actually less costly than

36
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,730
the expense of recovery.”

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,630
Let’s look back at the three
major hurricanes of last season,

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,210
each of which showcased
a different aspect of how

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,770
global warming can fuel these
destructive and costly storms.

40
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,179
In Rockport, Tex.,

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,870
Hurricane Harvey made
landfall as a Category 4 storm

42
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,820
with winds of up to
130 miles per hour.

43
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,490
It tore half this house
and many others to shreds.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,240
“This was our
bedroom that we used.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,580
Yeah, it just kind of
ripped everything off.”

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,280
“We’re not sure if we’re going
to have enough to rebuild.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,930
So it all depends.”

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,700
Hurricane Harvey caused 
$125 billion in damages,

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,540
making it one of the 
costliest hurricanes ever.

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,070
A lot of that cost
is due to flooding,

51
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,800
which devastated Houston.

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
There’s never been this much
water released from one

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,410
storm system ever in the U.S.

54
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,720
And global warming is partly to blame.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,750
“Warming temperatures allows
the air to hold more water.

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,920
And so we do 
expect rain rates

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,790
to increase under global warming.”

58
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,590
Flooding costs can be overwhelming.

59
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,780
According to FEMA, 
just one inch of flooding

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,590
in a home would cost a
household over $50,000.

61
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,520
At over 20 inches of flooding,
like in this home,

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,200
the costs can soar
up to $150,000.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
“I've never seen anything like this.”

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
The National Flood Insurance Program,

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,840
virtually the only source of flood
insurance for millions of Americans,

66
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,150
can’t afford to help pay for 
these mega-floods anymore.

67
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,650
It’s been in debt since
Hurricane Katrina flooded

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,240
New Orleans back in 2005.

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,610
And just two days
before Harvey hit Texas,

70
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,660
President Trump
signed an executive order

71
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,270
to revoke an Obama-era
rule that required

72
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,280
new federal infrastructure
projects to be

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,170
built to higher flood standards.

74
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,801
Environmentalists say the rule
protected taxpayer money

75
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,310
from going to projects
that are threatened by flooding.

76
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,980
In Florida, Hurricane Irma
ravaged the state

77
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,750
and became the longest-lasting
powerful hurricane ever recorded.

78
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,360
“What was unprecedented
about Irma was

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
that it reached about
185 miles per hour

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,490
and it stayed there for
about a day and a half.”

81
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,090
And despite the fact that the 
strongest winds missed Florida,

82
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,170
it still had ample time to 
damage vast swaths of land,

83
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,090
much of it agricultural.

84
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,519
Preliminary losses to 
agriculture are at $2.5 billion.

85
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:19,154
“Hi. We lost everything.”

86
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,310
“There’s a price to pay
no matter where you live.

87
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,830
I choose hurricanes over 
anything else because

88
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,530
you have weeks to
prepare for them.

89
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,070
But as you can see,
you can prepare and prepare

90
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,850
and it's not never enough.”

91
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,170
Preparations for hurricanes
can only go so far

92
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,080
as sea levels continue to rise.

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,446
Over the last two decades,

94
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,070
the oceans around
South Florida’s coast

95
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,260
have risen an inch
every five years.

96
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,150
“Let’s say we had these latest
hurricanes 80 years ago.

97
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,680
Sea levels were lower.

98
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,400
The exact same storm surge
that would've occurred

99
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,040
would not have been
as severe."

100
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,790
In Puerto Rico,

101
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,220
Hurricane Maria went from
a Category 1 hurricane

102
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,660
to a Category 5
in less than a day,

103
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,020
allowing for almost
no time to prepare.

104
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,000
And that lack of
preparation,

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,010
slow government response and 
the island’s poor infrastructure

106
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,190
meant people were stuck
underwater for days

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,800
and in the dark for months.

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,470
The damages in Puerto Rico
alone add up to $90 billion.

109
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,380
“These are huge numbers we're talking about.

110
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,870
And I don’t think taxpayers
have any idea how much money

111
00:05:27,870 --> 00:00:00,000
they're already paying for climate change.”
