Eric Bolling uh shown here in this - and what a handsome man Fox News is Eric Bolling you know him from the five he has another show on Fox networks Fox News network's he is suing the reporter who outed his PP picks so to speak you Shar ali-a Huff Post reporter who cited 14 different sources saying that Eric Bolling sent pictures of hit of male junk we're not saying it was his we're saying was male genitals two female co-workers the reporter tweeted out you know after these stories came out tweeted this just received a summons Eric Bolling is suing me for defamation 50 million dollars in damages I stand by my reporting and will protect my sources he continued saying not going to stop reporting on Eric Bolling or anyone else I've had family members killed / jailed in Iran a lawsuit isn't going to scare me bowling responded afterwards I will continue to fight against these false smear attacks thank you for your continued support um I just want to quickly go back to pictures of the peeny and whether or not it belonged to bowling I would argue it would be worse if bowling is sending genitalia pictures of genitalia - that belongs to other men - these women did you take those pictures yeah like I don't know if that makes it better but anyway wouldn't you find Eric Bolling big guy might not have an equally big whatever maybe he wants to impress these coworkers with a gentlemanly dick pic so maybe he goes online and he searches for bigger once and sends him and passes them off as his own it is definitely worse I think it would be hilarious also maybe he could deny later that they were his if a Michael Jackson genitalia investigation were to take place so we should do a poll on this what's worse if he sent his picture of his own penis well it was embarrassed by his own penis and had to search the internet for a larger one presumably or if he went to a co-worker or a friend and was like can I borrow you I mean wow what size shoe do you wear okay okay come over here sixteen here's who he didn't go to trump anyway so now look the if Eric Bolling is serious and thinks that yeah surely made up fourteen sources have at it Hoss he'll see you in court and I for me from my point of view I mean I'm not Ollie but I would look forward to it because then we might get to find out the forty sources and they might get to tell you a lot more details Eric I don't worry every yeah Eric strategy here is a very bad strategy because I don't I don't think that Ali made this story up I don't think that he's this bad guy who just wants to smear bowling I think he actually has evidence to back up his claims and so if this actually does go to court that evidence needs to be presented so I don't know so there's two reasons why bowling does it because you might think like why in the world we do such a boneheaded thing well he's the guy who sent the pictures allegedly in the first place alright so one is is a trump move you use threats of giant lawsuits to intimidate people it's right so now he didn't soom yet he's just threatening to sue him and for example trump during the campaign threatened to sue the New York Times he never actually did it and by the way it's the same lawyer the Trump use the threat in the New York Times a lawsuit is a lawyer that bowling is using to threaten yeah Sheryl Lee with a lawsuit and by the way they are not threatening Huffington Post that published this story they're only threatening the writers because they think having opposed a giant company and they have the resources to fight back whereas we might be able to intimidate this young reporter right it's such a classic scummy Trump kind of move and so it doesn't mean that he's actually even go through with it cuz you might want to try to intimidate him out of it other than or yeah never mind about that lawsuit yeah absolutely that's gotta be what it is this guy the reporter is just I love the response just being like I've seen worse I've seen worse in my life and Eric Bolling trying to sue me for fifty million dollars and that's absolutely right going after Huff not going after HuffPo absolutely intimidation tactic yeah and in in the yeah Charlize case he's definitely seen worse because he probably saw the pictures watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like at TYT Network comm slash join
