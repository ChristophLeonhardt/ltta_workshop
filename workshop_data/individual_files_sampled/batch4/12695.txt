the left still seems kind of confused about why the Orlando terrorists killed 49 people at a gay club just yesterday the New York Times editorialized that the quote precise motivation for the rampage remains unclear the paper then blamed Republican politicians who see prejudice as something to exploit not extinguish The Times isn't alone according to many on the left omar Mateen was an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in a mystery he might have been a frustrated gay guy he might have just been a run-of-the-mill religious fanatic who knows he could have been anything or maybe he was a jihadist who spoke regularly about being a jihadist and who made no secret about how he was a jihadist here is omar Mateen on the west he posted this on Facebook in real time as he was killing people quote the real Muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the West here's Omer Matignon isis quote America and Russia stop bombing the Islamic state you kill innocent women and children by doing US airstrikes now taste the Islamic state vengeance he then added delightfully in the next few days you will see attacks from the Islamic state in the USA finally from inside the club he wrote I pledged my allegiance to Abu Bakr al-baghdadi may Allah accept me here's one Mateen wrote on Islamic terrorism well first he went in the club and he started shouting Allahu Akbar which as we all know means I love Jesus the FBI investigated Mateen in 2013 after he boasted at work about ties to Hezbollah and al-qaeda the local sheriff actually moved him off duty at the st. Lucie County Courthouse to a golfing community so here's the thing if the media refused to acknowledge the obvious they can pretend everybody's equally likely to purchase a gun for purposes of shooting up a gay nightclub that means removing everybody's access to gun ownership yours mine Lindsay's if they acknowledge the Mateen was obviously a jihadist obviously they'd also have to acknowledge perhaps the best calibrated government approach would be to target say jihadists like the thousand of them in the United States there are a hundred million gun owners in the country there are far fewer people who brag to colleagues about how they want to join of Hezbollah in class perhaps the problem is standards of evidence for prosecution not standards for exercise of gun rights but no it's all a big conundrum gang who knows why he did all of this grab Scooby and let's head for the Mystery Machine i'm ben shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show humanize people please don't care

obviously it's been a terrible week for the country it's been a terrible week for the political debate and the Democrats just continue to be terrible because that's what they do for a living so let's start with Democratic senator Joe - Joe Manchin from West Virginia Joe Manchin is somebody who actually is not totally anti-gun right she's very upset because like all the Democrats he thinks that if you're put on the terror watch list your second Amendment rights should immediately be removed the reason this is stupid is because to be put on the terror watch list we don't know why you get put on we don't know how you get taken off and beyond that nothing has been proved I mean you haven't had a chance to actually face down your accuser you don't have any due process rights you have a constitutional right not to have your rights taken away from you without due process of law that's under the Constitution of the United States Democrats though would like to remove your right to purchase a firearm based on whatever the FBI says today right if there are eight hundred thousand people by the way on the FBI terror watch list including their wars sitting US senators and journalists but the idea is that if you're on the terror watch list or they don't fly list then therefore they never have to explain to you you're any of these things but they can deny you your second Amendment rights people who care about rights they're wait a second if you're gonna prove a case against somebody you actually have to prove a case against somebody or at least maybe show a judge why the person is so dangerous they can't own guns even if you haven't come up with enough evidence to convict them of a crime yet joe manchin however has a different problem his problem is due process itself he says due process is really screwing this whole thing up here's Joe Manchin the problem we have and really the the firewall that we have right now is due process yeah it's all due process so we can all say yeah we want the same thing but how do we get there if a person is on a terrorist watchlist like the gentleman the shooter in Orlando he was twice by the FBI we were we were briefed yesterday about what happened but that man was brought in twice they did everything they could his FBI did everything that was supposed to do but there was no way for them to keep him on the next list or keep him off a gun by list there was no way to do that okay the bright they promised due process if we could just do away with this whole due process thing and just take guns from people randomly well that would be a lot easier wouldn't it I mean that really solve all the problems that we have and Democrats are fully on board with this Chris Murphy is a senator from Connecticut last night he did a filibuster he held up some sort of spending bill in order to yell about gun control and finally Republicans have fine will vote on your gun control measure here is Chris Murphy talking about his great heroic stance in favor of taking away your gun and mine so long as we ends up on some sort of government list and he explains that if the time has come to just end the Second Amendment well I've been up for about an hour after sleeping for two hours and we're gonna work today to make sure that we have that commitment to bring these votes before the body as your reporter noted it would be much better to be able to get a bipartisan agreement on this issue of keeping guns away from terrorists but at the very least we have to have a vote senator Feinstein has fairly dramatically modified her proposal to try to address many of the concerns that Republicans have and so it may be that if we put this measure on the floor for a vote either at the end of this week at the beginning of next week we may be able to draw enough support to get it passed I mean the American public agrees with us that if you're on the terrorist watch list and you are not allowed to fly on a plane then you certainly shouldn't be able to buy a dangerous assault weapon that's our ask to get a vote on that proposition and an expansion of background show hopeful that we're gonna get that either at the end of this week or next week I'll tell you so to be clear about this what he's suggesting is that if you're on the terror watch list the new the new measure they're pushing by the way is if you've been on a terror watchlist in the last five years the reason they're saying this is because Mateen the shooter here he was taken off the terror watchlist in 2014 right so the FBI investigated him decided they didn't have enough to go on and then they said okay well we can't do anything with you and he bought a gun and he killed people so wouldn't a mattered if he bought the gun while he was on the watch list or off the watch list he was off the watch list by the time he died and by the time he shot all of these folks at the gay night club but they want to broaden the standards and so they want to get rid of the Second Amendment we already know they don't like the First Amendment they want to be able to prosecute people who our anti climate change propaganda and they want to be able to prosecute people who refuse to cater same-sex weddings so they don't like the First Amendment very much they don't like the Fourth Amendment which is against unreasonable search and seizure they're very much in favor of violating your personal standards of Liberty depending on who you are they're not in favor of the Fifth Amendment due process rights I think we should probably start from the premise at this point that which which amendments to the Democrats actually want to keep in the bill of rights it's sort of hard to figure it out at this point the reason that I think this is true is because the left has a tendency to project so in the leftist view in the leftist view the only people who deserve rights are people who agree with them the left thinks that's also true of people on the right you're about to see this puzzlement express itself Anderson Cooper did a did an interview with Pam Bondi who's the Attorney General in Florida and it's an egregious interview and you'll see the very premise of the entire conversation is people on the Left believe that if you exercise your rights in a way they don't like you shouldn't have those rights they can't understand why people on the right would say you have a right to do something we may not agree with how you're doing it but you still have the right to do it free of violence they they just don't get it so here's the Anderson Cooper and he got all sorts of props from the left for this but he but this is really a terrible interview and a terrible indictment of the left I mean it demonstrates that for the left there's no such thing as actual rights for the left there's just agreement here's here's Anderson Cooper with him I want ask you I saw you the other day saying that anyone who attacks the LGBT community our LGBT community you said will be gone after with a full extent of the law I talked a lot of gay and lesbian people here yesterday who are not fans of yours and who said that they thought you were being a hypocrite that you for years have fought you basically gone after gay people said that in court that gay people simply by fighting for marriage equality we're trying to do harm to the people of Florida to induce public harm I believe was the term you used in court do you really think you're a champion of the gay community but do you worry about using language accusing gay people of trying to do harm to the people of Florida when doesn't that send a message to some people who might have bad ideas would you argue that in court my lawyer argued a case defending what the Supreme Court allowed the voters to put in our state review are you into gay marriage if there was gay marriage if they were same-sex marriage that would do harm to the people of Florida to support a society is really vile what he's saying is if you oppose same-sex marriage you must be okay with jihadist murdering people in in gay clubs right that's what he's saying he's saying that you're just the same as the jihadist you just don't want to say so this is what the left doesn't understand about the right I oppose same-sex marriage I'm a religious person who thinks homosexuality is a sin I also think that in America and in Western civilization you have the right to have sex with whomever you please so long as it's consenting and so long as the person is capable of consent and you don't have to care what I think you don't have to care what I think the left can't understand this perspective they can't understand it at all which is why for the left they will never allow a good religious bake or not to cater a same-sex wedding right they will never allow that to happen because they don't like how you're expressing your freedom of religion so it must be stopped they don't like how you're expressing your freedom of speech right if you if you use freedom of speech in terrible ways if you say the n-word I think you're a pig and a disgusting human being if you use the n-word you'll have to prosecute you for doing that I wouldn't because I think you have a right to say disgusting terrible things under the First Amendment because I don't have a right to to crack down on you using violence for things that you say the left doesn't understand that concept for the left there is just agreement or there's or there's fascism so the idea is so Anderson Cooper is actually projecting right Pam Bondi is what all right wingers say which is okay we don't like homosexuality per se we're not big fans of same-sex marriage but that doesn't mean somebody has the right to go into a club and blow people away right that person is disgusting and we have nothing but sympathy for the people who are killed even if they're killed while doing things that we don't necessarily approve of right I didn't like the cartoons by the way Charlie Hebdo that doesn't mean that I'm in favor of jihadis going and killing everyone at Charlie Hebdo right the less can't understand that the left doesn't like that so instead what they do is they project their own viewpoint on to the right because the left thinks that you should not have the right to carry a gun because you're a right winger because they think that they also think that we must think that you don't have a right to live if you're a homosexual this of course is absolute nonsense it's really damaging to the public discourse it's really damaging to the public debate because again we can all hold the same standard or at least we used to which is we can disagree without being in favor of murder we can all fight murderers together this is why the left would rather side with the people quote-unquote fighting Islamophobia then side with the people fighting radical jihad because if they're fighting if they're sided with the people who fight Islamophobia presumably then those people are also siding with them on gay marriage right there's an alliance I made outside with them on gay marriage but I side with them on the right not to be killed so the it's it's amazing they'd rather side with the people who are with them on gay marriage for political purposes or at least with them on political correctness for political purposes but tolerate people who murder them they'd rather side with those people than the people like me you don't like same-sex marriage but also say that radical jihadism has to be put in the ground right so the left is really terrible under all this and this just proves that they don't understand how rights work rights work the only reason rights exist is because we can disagree on the exercise of the right but still exist but still agree that there is a right to do these things that we disagree about okay meanwhile Hillary and Obama are still struggling to figure out what exactly their strategy is to combat this Obama is headed down to Florida today I mean it's not like San Bernardino where he waited for three weeks he's gonna head right down to Florida and he's going to presumably say that we all need to give up our guns Hillary Clinton is very angry Donald Trump she says that Donald Trump's ideas namely a moratorium on Muslim immigration to the United States more surveillance on Muslim centers in the United States she says this wouldn't have stopped Orlando here's how Clinton looking rather rather grim in this particular in this particular iteration so not one of Donald Trump's reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando it's just more evidence that he is tempor mentally unfit and twelve and totally unqualified to be commander in chief this wouldn't have saved one life nothing that Trump does would have saved a single life okay where did that logic go when it comes to her own gun control measures nothing that she says about gun control would have saved any wives at all none none zero lives have been saved she's talking about even removing this is the ability of people on the terror watch list from buying guns would not have stopped this particular situation he wasn't on the terror watch list also terrorists have a pretty good record of being able to go and find weaponry right the Boston bombing was done with a cat with with with a pressure cooker we're gonna outlaw pressure cookers now I mean this whole thing is silly and and even Obama will admit this he'll say he may not stop every shooting but it'll save one life okay well by that logic Trump's measures are better and by the way Trump's measures would have saved lives if we had implemented them when daddy wanted to come over it turns out the father of this guy who immigrated to the United States is in fact a radical Muslim preacher and he came over to the United States from Afghanistan we let him in anyway Hilary continues along these lines she says Trump's ideas are just terrible how do you build a wall to keep the internet out a ban on Muslims would not have stopped this neither would a wall I don't know how one builds a wall to keep the internet out every last I don't know how all would keep the internet well I don't know Hillary since you condemned a YouTube video for the murder of four Americans in Benghazi I'm not sure apparently you think the same thing apparently you think that if the government shuts down free speech then magically there will be less terrorism you and your president you think if you don't say the phrase radical Islam that there'll be less terrorism let's make one thing clear about Hillary and Obama okay Hillary goes on here and she's gonna we'll play this one clip she says that she's gonna make identifying lone wolf terrorists the priority we have to be just as adaptable and versatile as our enemies as president I will make identifying and stopping lone wolves a top priority okay let's talk about that for a second how do you identify lone wolves if you refuse to acknowledge the connections with radical Islamic websites are the actual problem that the lone wolves all seem to hold in common this basic ideology how do you identify them how do you go after them and let's be straight the Obama administration has done an unbelievably crappy job on this they've done a really really terrible job from 1940 Brett Stevens said this in his column yesterday in the Wall Street Journal in from 1940 to 2000 there were 38 lone wolf attacks in the United States from 2000 to 2009 as 2012 there were 12 lone wolf attacks in the United States from 2012 till now there been over 50 so what are they doing why aren't they weren't they going after the lone wolves the answer is political correctness the answer is political correctness even Chris Manson's when M&Z say he doesn't understand I don't get what Hillary's even talking about but you can saying it'll talk to you heared about let's talk about let's go I've got a hit list like that here my head list begins with why did we go into Iraq my list by the way continues along your line with why we messed around with Qaddafi why did we get involved with overthrowing a government without any idea that and the bedlam to come and what side are we on in Syria a please tell me somebody please tell me what we want to happen in Syria because I don't get it I don't get Hillary's foreign policy in any of those three big guards but I'll have our list I don't understand Hillary's foreign policy but I still like Hillary I mean I like I mean well it's too much to ask that I actually like the person I'm voting for then I agree with anything that when when even Democrats are looking at Hillary and cross-eyed and saying what are you talking about it makes things relatively difficult and ever the delusion becomes stronger because the left on a fundamental level cannot acknowledge radical Islam is the problem because that would require that we stand up for our own civilization and they don't like our civilization they believe all civilizations are equal they believe all civilizations are morally decent and the only thing that separates good civilizations from bad civilizations is poverty versus wealth and if you're wealthy that means the exploited the impoverished civilization so really we can only have a fair just universe if everybody is equal materially but that's not what drives people what drives people isn't your want for a house or you want for a car I mean this guy had a job this guy had a had a house this guy had a wife Osama bin Laden was a millionaire what drives people is not just having the rudimentary necessities of life what drives people to to kill and die and murder and protect what drives people to do things is what they believe is right in the world that's what drives people to do things this is why religion has been the single greatest unifying force and also the single greatest dividing force in the history of the world and leftism is a religion leftism is a religion and the fact is that what people are driven by is their need to impose order on what they perceive as a chaotic universe and so they find a framework in which they can fit that chaotic universe but Obama doesn't believe that and he doesn't believe there's any difference between the frameworks all that really matters is that you give Isis jobs and so President Obama is very upset about the idea of having to say radical Islam and he and he keeps maintaining there's an we don't have to say radical Islam it's a waste of time he's very upset Donald Trump for saying radical Islam here as President Obama a couple of days ago let me make a final point for a while now the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase radical Islam that's the key they tell us we can't beat ISIL unless we call them radical Islamists what exactly would using this label accomplish what exactly would it change would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans would it bring in more allies is there a military strategy that is served by this here for a second he goes along along these lines for a little bit a question for him if he thinks that using radical Islam doesn't change anything why doesn't he just use it since it's true there's a converse question for him why doesn't just use it or if he says that this isn't a military strategy well why is it a military strategy not to use it either matters or it doesn't have you say that it doesn't matter why not just say it considering that it's true there's not one Muslim anywhere on planet earth who becomes a terrorist because someone said the phrase radical Islam not one that's not why people become terrorists see Obama thinks they become terrorists out of economic despair there are a bunch of people on the Left who think that people become terrorists because they're offended by American Islamophobia or some assumption some such idiocy the real reason that terrorists become terrorists is because they believe in an ideology of conquest over non-muslim people's and also because they believe that they can get away with it and forward the cause by killing civilians that's what they believe okay but did this idea that you don't say radical Islam because it doesn't win the war nobody said it's gonna win the war but I guarantee you will lose the war if you refuse to acknowledge that the real problem here is rooting out an ideology and killing its adherents not taking away my guns not taking away my guns now this is stupidity taking away my guns doesn't do anything I mentioned this yesterday you know I'm not somebody who's in the center of terrorism I live in Los Angeles but I know somebody in there was a guy in my community who was who was killed by terrorists at LAX in 2002 at the ELA counter I was in Israel I was an hour away from the Spyros bombing in Israel in 2002 we walked past the site right afterward we'd been there an hour beforehand I've I went to school next to the Simon Wiesenthal Center the Holocaust Museum in in the city in Los Angeles said yeah you should be University in Los Angeles Yola and when I went there there was a there was a guy named Buford furrow as a major national story at the time who drove past the Simon Wiesenthal Center considered whether to shoot it up saw there was an armed guard there and instead linson local JCC also within driving distance of me and decided to kill to people there alright so I'm not somebody who frequently engages with terrorism and even I have had tangential tangential experience with terrorism right the idea that I'm supposed to give up my gun to people who can't protect me and refuse to protect me and crack down on the people who try to protect me isn't saying they do they crack down on the FBI if it's Islamophobic they crack down on the CIA if it's Islamophobic they cracked down on local police departments that report if a 14 year old kid walks into a school with a device that looks exactly like a bomb right then they invites him to the White House that's what happens if you don't mention radical Islam that's why people die okay so all of this leaves a big room - it leaves a lot of broken-field running for Donald Trump is an open field for him here because the left has outed itself as horrifying in every way on this particular I mean they've now blamed this guy's self-loathing homophobia is a gay Muslim and so he must have hated himself because he was gay okay it turns out there's a lot of self-loathing gay people none of them go into gay clubs and shoot it up and then they the billion on the fact that he could get a gun there are a hundred million gun owners in America none of them went into a gay club and shot it up turns out there's one factor that sort of explains all of this so Trump has a lot of room to run here and chris matthews give some advice to donald trump and it's actually not terrible advice in me he gets always egg put tea cozies here'll a show and he explains donald trump hears that you should run down so let me explain to you that i should run down Trump once all this mean the Trump is doing something very wrong his attack on the judge his call for an enlarged travel ban on Muslims his failure to exploit the negative Inspector General's report on the Clintons handling of email his parent encounter her speech attacking him on foreign policy all constitute a failure to stay in the game he's hitting in the wrong places failing to strike in the right ones politically Trump's clearly in a slump and for good reason he's not doing the job of Republican presidential nominee he's not uniting his party he's dividing it leaving himself alone to confront the enemy many would say the country is better off because the Trump's drifting off and that said I for one would like to hear more of a Trump message that elevates the American political debate I'd like to hear more about the need to rebuild this country the cities the subways the railways the bridge is the water and sewer systems and not just what was built in the 23 even 19th century but what we need to do well we need to build build more buildings you build a sewage system we need to build more waterways like the aqueducts I was home when I was in Rome with my wife Kathleen we went there we saw these beautiful awkward I said we had aqueducts like that's dead we don't have a context like that today I was waiting me Donald Trump to build the aqueducts put a big giant T on the aqueducts along with the wall down Trump well what he's actually saying there believe it or not is pretty much right right if Trump stayed on message if Trump stayed on message put aside all the idiocy about infrastructure if from stayed on message he would have plenty of room to run here right and so now we're gonna play a game it's called a good trump bad Trump okay and and there's no such thing as fully good from people keep it huhuhuh it came out today and he said well I'm back on the Trump train Hugh Hewitt who I personally know I really like you I think we're friends he was jumping on and off the Trump train like a hobo going you know trying trying to cross the country and escape and escape the the jackboots right he's just he's jumping up and down on the train so now he's back on the Trump train and he says all he has to do is control himself Trump all he has to do is control himself I mean my god you talking Imagi so we're gonna play good Trump bad Trump Trump says some really good things this week he also says some stupid things this week so we'll start with the good things that he said this week here is Donald Trump ripping President Obama saying you know clearly Obama's angrier at me than he was at this radical Muslim who decided to kill a bunch of gay people in Florida I watched President Obama today and he was more angry at me that he wasn't the shooter and many people said that one of the folks on television said boy is Trump gotten under his skin but he was more angry and a lot of people have said this the level of anger that's the kind of anger he should have for the shooter and these killers that shouldn't be here Hillary Clinton just yesterday used the term radical Islam sort of used it right did you see and they also know Trump Foster I shouldn't be forcing anything if you don't know what the term is and if you don't discuss what the problem is and if you can't say the real name we have a radical Islamic terrorism problem folks we can say we don't we can pretend like Obama that we don't where Obama spent a long time talking about it and nobody at the end of that speech understood anything other than boy does he hate Donald Trump okay everything that Trump says there is exactly correct 100% true if this were the Trump that you got for all the campaign excuse me he'd actually have a shot at winning if this were the trip that you actually saw the entire campaign long he would actually have a shot at winning this thing and he continues along these lines again this is all good stuff here's Trump explaining yes mentioning radical Islam is important yes it's a worthwhile thing to talk about radical Islam he's trying to justify why he won't use and he said radical Islam because he didn't want to use the word terrorism if you notice why he won't use that term or why he doesn't use it and how it doesn't make any difference but it does make a difference it makes a difference and it makes a big difference because unless you're willing to discuss and talk about the real nature of the problem and the name of the problem radical Islamic terrorism you're never going to solve the problem okay all of this is true all of this is good so this is we're playing good trump bad form so this is good Trump and he continues along these lines also Hillary Clinton had said that she wants the the guitar ease the gay the gutter ease is she pronounced it the people from Qatar to to stop providing funding to terrorism into into radical mosques you said the same about Saudi Arabia here is Trump punching her over this she never until yesterday criticized these countries she never until yesterday said radical Islam and that's between we shame insulin that's because yes she was shamed into it by me and that's because of the pressure I put on her but here's a woman that takes all of this money from these countries and then she says she loves women and she's totally with the gays and the you know the whatever group you might talk about the gay lesbian now let me just tell you Sean how can she be they want to kill the gays they throw more buildings they actually throw gays off buildings and so taking honey and I'm calling for her to give back all of the money she's taken from these countries okay I'm much better for women than she is I'm much better for gays okay so everything that he's saying there is again a hundred percent rate so this is good Trump now it's time for bad Trump and here's the problem Trump can't help himself he can't help himself because his face says things there's no filter between his brain and that crazy face so it just comes right out the mouth through those big bottom teeth and just out so Donald Trump in the last 24 hours in the last 24 hours Donald Trump said everybody in the Republican Party should just shut up and get behind him to which Paul Ryan responded wait what who are you we are a co-equal branch of government we don't we don't take orders from you Donald Trump also went after the NRA so he's so this is the guy who's supposed to be standing up against radical Islam he tweeted out quote I will be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me okay which has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list or the no-fly list to buy guns and this would be the Democratic policy that they're pushing right now so he's now mirroring the Democrats he says rat like I said Donald Trump good diagnostician terrible doctor right his Diagnostics is right his prescription is totally wrong and so he's throwing the NRA right under the bus right under the bus and it's typical Trump it's typical Trump he can't stop himself he can't stop himself it's time for bad from then Donald Trump in the middle of his lecture he says to he says this about about the gay population and how they should respond to him is in Atlanta yesterday and for the women out there yes the people of Saudi Arabia what they think of women and for the for the gays out there ask the gays and ask the people ask the gays what they think and what they do in not only Saudi Arabia in many of these countries with the gay community just ask and then you tell me who's your friend Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton you tell me okay so what he says there is fine the problem people have on line is that when he keep he can't help himself every time he mentions a group it's the gays right is that asked gay people is I ask Jews it's not ask blacks it's asked the blacks as the Jews ask the gays and it's just this bizarre verbal take that he has I don't think that he means anything by a per se but people were jumping all over that and then on top of that he says that he thinks he can talk him jeong-hoon out of having nuclear weapons he said this yesterday in Atlanta also say he just can't stop himself gang he can't stop himself one of the papers called the other day and they said would you speak to the leader of North Korea why not and they come out Trump would speak to him to anybody who knows 10% or a 20% chance that I can talk him out of those damn nukes cuz who the hell wants him to have nukes and there's a chance okay there's a there's a chance there's a chance I mean he sounds like he sounds like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber so you're saying there's a chance okay so he says he'll talk to anybody so long as there's a quote-unquote chance as though there's no downside to talking to these people this is Barack Obama's policy right this is Obama's policy he said the same thing about North Korea he said the same thing about Iran so the good Trump bad from train continues to roll along and it's putting people in a really awkward position there's a story today about how Donald Trump has used the Trump foundation as a slush fund there's another story today about how Donald Trump is is I mentioned the one where he where he's yelling at other Republicans and telling them to shut up he's there all these Republicans looking at him and saying what's wrong with you like you can't even stay on message with regard to the NRA and and gun policy this is the problem for Trump and this is why there's gonna be a lot of people are in a very dicey situation this should be Trump's shining moment he had the best speech of his campaign earlier this week this is where he can draw his greatest differentiation his greatest distinction between himself and Hillary Clinton and he just can't stop himself there's no way for him to stop himself and it really is tragic because Democrats are proving exactly how terrible they is they are and Donald Trump is right on this issue but he can't help himself because he just his prescriptions are wrong because he doesn't have the proper ideology and this is the problem fighting the bad guys is imperative but in order to fight the bad guys you have to know who you are you have to know what it is that you're fighting for Trump knows who the bad guys are but I'm not sure the Democrats don't then ever cries don't even know who the bad people are Donald Trump knows who the bad guys are but he doesn't know what our values are and why those values are worth preserving and defending so he knows to fight the bad guys which is good I guess I mean it is good but he he needs to take the next step and that is why are we fighting them what's worth preserving here what's worth preserving here and I think that he has a basic notion of that sometimes but one of the things that's worth preserving is a small government Liberty that he seems entirely too comfortable with throwing out of the way for his own ad-hoc self aggrandizement and policymaking okay time for something I like and then something I hate and then it's a mail bag okay so things I like on Thursdays we've been doing biblical verses I want to issue a correction so my very first Bible verse routine I actually got something wrong last week which is perfect so a few extra minutes in hell for me right here but the I mentioned that there were tribes in the Bible who stayed across the Jordan River but were required to fight with the rest of the tribes in order to in order to liberate Israel and then they were allowed to settle outside I got the tribes wrong it was Reuven it was Reuben GAD and half of Menasha wasn't Menasha enough Ryan okay fine okay now here here today okay so we're going through the we're going through right now in the Jewish community are going through the Book of Numbers so the next so the next verses in the book of numbers are our verses 22 through 27 I won't bother to dazzle you with my ability to read Hebrew so I'll just read it in English instead I'll read it in English instead it says for these and this is one of these puzzling aspects of the Bible that a lot of people don't get and they don't understand what what's special about it or interesting about it or it's so weird so it says for those bear and I like to I'd like to answer these questions because the left has this whole list of things online about oh you crazy Jews oh you crazy Christians who believe all this mumbo-jumbo in the Bible and all the sexist crap in the Bible okay so there's a whole situation in the Bible in numbers where it talks about the curse the the the the idea that a man thinks his wife is cheating on him and he has warned her in the past that she shouldn't be alone with a guy and she goes alone with the guy and then he takes her to the Kohei and he takes her to the priest and they write these curses on a piece of paper and they dissolve it in water and then she drinks the curses and then if she cheated on her husband then she dies basically and if she didn't cheat on her husband then she doesn't die then she then they go back to being married so if you just read the text of the Bible this is pretty weird stuff right I mean this is weird mumbo-jumbo II stuff this is why in Judaism we have something called the oral torah so there's the tour other words what this is and then there's the oral torah the oral torah is the oral tradition passed on from Moses at Sinai and it was the explanation for what does this actually mean so we learned from the oral torah what we learned from the Mishnah and from the gomorrah which is the talmud which is the the commentary on the oral torah is that what actually happens here is that the husband goes to the wife and he says I think you've been cheating on me if she doesn't want to do this manager test here all she has to say is okay let's get a divorce right she can get out of it if you just say let's get a divorce which seems to me the proper response in almost any case if your husband thinks you're cheating gotten to you and it's serious enough about it to bring you to a priest and have you drink some weird water so she can get out of it anytime she wants she however does not want to do that and so she goes and she and she drinks this water and presumably it says her thigh collapses and she dies okay so in most case so the question is twofold one is the scientific question what's in the water that makes somebody die the second is why go through this whole rigmarole in the first place so what's in the water that makes somebody dies it's make somebody die nobody really knows there no documented cases of this ever happening where somebody drinks the water and in the time of their noble documents of cases if somebody drinks the water then they die so why bother go through this whole rigmarole what is written on the piece of paper that is dissolved in the water is the name of God right then the priest writes the name of God and then he dissolves it one of the rules and Judaism in the Bible is you're not allowed to desecrate the name of God this means that in the Jewish community if you have the formal name of God written in Hebrew you're not allowed to burn it you're not allowed to destroy it you have to bury it like you have to treat it as though it has worth but here you're explicitly ordered to take the name of God and to dissolve it in water right here specifically told to do this and why are you told to do this to preserve the marriage so the idea here is that God is even willing to sacrifice his own dignity he's even willing to sacrifice his own name to preserve what we like to call shaman bias to preserve the the health of the household to bring husband and wife back together so the husband is suspicious and it by the way it encourages the husband not to do this repeatedly don't do this you're making a big mistake by doing this but if both sides of the couple want to go forward with all of this then the idea is that even God God is willing to sacrifice himself to preserve marriage and that's the essence of this entire section this is this this puzzling section is if there's that much suspicion between husband and wife God is willing to put his own name on the line he's willing to put his own name on the line his own honor on the line in order to sanctify the marriage and in order to assure the innocence of the woman who's being wrongly accused so that's this part of the Bible that I that I wanted to explain today that again is from numbers 5 22 to 527 okay now another thing that I like that has nothing to do with the Bible and this is the there's a prank video that somebody put out and it really is kind of hilarious so there's this this guy who wanted to show that Americans react differently to Muslim terrorists than they do to supposedly Christian terrorists duh so here's the prank video that he put out he has a guy and he's dressed up for people who can't see he's dressed up in like full Muslim gear and and then he's and you'll see you'll see how progresses he's gonna be an Islamic terrorist I'm gonna be a Christian terrorist and let's see if people act differently towards each one of us yeah okay this guy's running around he's dropping a suitcase and yelling Allahu Akbar and then and then running around what I love some of these people is like this is not how you should respond if you think mommy is going on dangling I'm just telling you like they move one they move six inches like they freak out the new six inches is though that's gonna protect them from the bomb blast right and then I love the girls who are standing there in a field and they go back for their stuff like okay if you actually thought that's a bomb you might want to like get the hell out of there okay so here's how people react to a Christian terrorist and here's it there's a guy in Jesus he just drops a suitcase and yells jesus loves you praise Jesus praise Jesus and drops it and drops a suitcase and then walks away these kids kind of sit there and nothing happened okay praise Jesus he just praise Jesus then he just runs away and nobody's doing anything okay so the reason for this gang is because when someone shouts Allahu Akbar it generally is followed by an explosion of some sort okay when you're not in Islamic prayer service someone's just running up to you in public shouts Allahu Akbar it's not gonna end well if somebody says praise Jesus and drop something in front of you there's at least an 90% chance that he just dropped the box of Bibles I mean really like or he dropped some candies that got from the Girl Scouts or something or he's just a crazy guy who dropped his bag of crosses like there's not a long history of people shouting praise Jesus out loud parts of buzzword gang that's the reason why people freaked out when this happens and this shows that people I guess the idea was to show Americans or Islamophobic dude if somebody is wearing that and drops a a package in front of me and shouts Allahu Akbar I am sure as hell Islamophobic enough to run like hell from that okay that's not Islamophobic that's you not being a moron so okay so that there's that video okay things I hate Janet Yellin who's the head of the Federal Reserve she was asked about helicopter money so helicopter money is let's say that that the economy is doing really badly helicopter money is the idea that the federal government can increase spending by literally getting in a helicopter and shoveling physical cash out of the helicopter onto vast swaths of the community and then people have extra money and they'll go spend it and we'll have a great economy again okay the reason this is stupid is because if you if I have a watch that's worth a hundred dollars and you now give everybody a hundred dollars my watch is going to go up in price because you haven't changed the underlying value of the watch you just changed the ruler that we're measuring by right I'm five nine contrary to popular opinion if I have a if I have a yardstick that says that I am seven foot three it doesn't matter I'm still five nine I'm exactly the same height I was before okay the value of an object does not change based on the number of dollars in circulation it still has the same inherent value in terms of the market that's being traded it's just the measurement stick has changed here's Janet Yellen being challenged Janet Yellen the head of the Fed being a moron in unusual times where the concern is with very weak growth or possibly deflation rather rare circumstances first of all fiscal policy can be a very important tool and it's natural that if it can be employed that just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to stimulate growth that fiscal policy should play a role and normally you would hope in an economy with those severe downside risks monetary and fiscal policy would not be working at cross-purposes to get put together now whether or not in such extreme circumstances there might be a case for with say coordination close coordination where the central bank playing a role in financing fiscal policy this is something that should be everything it's better no it doesn't nothing changes you just you just made everybody's savings worth nothing that's all that happened right because my savings still have the number of the same number of dollars in there you didn't inflate my savings you just made them more than nothing I can't buy anything with them okay so that's why having the Fed in charge of our fiscal policy is really stupid okay mail bag time let's do a few minutes of mailbag okay Marcelo writes Ben I'm a conservative who was born and raised in Brazil a country that elected with vast majority votes two Marxist government and Marxist guerrillas I moved to America to integrate work I'm a doctor and becoming for American I see the country looking more and more like Brazil which terrifies me what do you think would be the best way for me to help prevent this from happening I used my experience in Brazil to try to open people's eyes but how can I make it more effective well first of all you should write as much as possible you should get the word out there should make videos you should distribute the message if you want to submit to Daily wire you can we don't take a lot of submissions but if you want to submit I'm more than happy to take a look the that's a message that needs to be people from abroad who have been in countries where we've tried all these things and failed your words have a little bit more weight than people here kind of theorizing about it dad writes hey Ben I've been trying to get more of a sense of who Andrew Breitbart was I just got done reading his book righteous indignation which was great I also read your book bullies which was fantastic righteous indignation Andrews book is really a terrific book and I saw a video by Gavin McInnes on rebel media talking about the fourteen different groups on the right he labeled Breitbart from conservative having read his in your book I didn't get the impression of that being a correct categorization am I wrong or do you agree with Gavin's assessment well I think Gavin has Trump all wrong so I think that's the problem so Gavin I think believes that Trump is just a guy who slaps social justice warriors and slaps the left and doesn't really care about policy that's not what Trump does Trump is just an ad hoc totalitarian and his enemies are whose enemies happen to be at that given moment some are on the left some are on the right Andrew Breitbart motivating factor and life was standing up to bullies Andrew didn't think that the Trump was a conservative in any way and he also thought that bullies had to be fought so the fact that Andrew Breitbart you know like let me just give you an example not to go back to a sore subject but there is no way in hell that if Andrew Breitbart had been alive during the Michelle fields incident he doesn't fly down to Florida and confront Trump for an apology for his reporter just thought there's no way it doesn't happen anybody who knows Andrew would tell you this anyone okay except for the people who currently work at Breitbart because they have reason not to tell you that but that's the reality andrew was first and foremost a guy who hated bullies and that was true on the left and on the right okay Ben writes if you were president what would your immigration position be what would you do with all the people already here if I were president I would build a wall I would also limit the amount of immigration from countries that do not have a history of Western civilization I would Institute a philosophy test for people coming in to ensure that they are not going to take welfare I would cut our welfare programs dramatically to not create a magnet for people coming here illegally and I would ensure that people who are be here illegally and taking welfare people who are here illegally and taking government benefits people who are net draw on the society are deported that means actually looking at each illegal immigrant that doesn't mean that the the illegal immigrant who's valedictorian of her high school and now going to Yale we should abort her but it doesn't mean the illegal immigrant who's been caught five times her felonies should probably be deported and stay deported that's my view is we can do this on a one-to-one basis we don't have to say all illegal immigrants go all illegal immigrants stay that's dumb it's not practical what you can do is you can say some of you deserve to go and some of you deserve to stay and you know impose a fine for people who are staying so that they can pay off their debt because they obviously have have had a cost on the society okay Andrew right hi Ben what does Iran get right and what does she get wrong drew well first of all - I saw you like five minutes ago in the office you could've just asked me in person but what does Ana Iran get right what she gets right take on capitalism that productivity is what drives capitalism that you own your own labor and that your labor is an extension of you that there's a moral side to capitalist and that's what Iran gets right when Iran gets wrong is her whole perspective on inter human relationships she she thinks that that basically objectivism is the perception that selfishness is always good and the way she defined selfishness is if I decide to leave my wife and nail another broad then that's good because I'm being selfish and it would be my altruism would end up hurting me and my wife if I were to stay with her and be monogamous so I should basically do what I want right and then and that's where she's just missing the boat the fact is that relationships interpersonal relationships of the people you love do require a certain amount of altruism you'll notice the nine rands book there are no children there no children in any of her books the reason for this is because raising children is entirely altruistic I can tell you having lost sleep for the last six weeks that's not something I enjoy doing it's not something fun to do I'm not doing it out of my own selfish motivation I'm doing it because my wife needs help the selfish thing for me to do is I have a wife she's you know taking time off right now my selfish thing to do would be okay honey you deal with the baby I got things to do right you can deal with them now they might argue okay well but you're really making yourself feel good and that's the real selfishness okay it's a kind of a weak argument the reality is that believe me it's not making me feel all that good that I'm staying up to all hours of the night so the Iran's view of interpersonal relationships and love is is very very sick her perspective on capitalism however is excellent Peter writes Ben did your wife serve in the Israeli military if so does she use Krav Maga on you when you say something too outrageous she did not serve in the military she immigrated to the United States permanently when she was 12 she and her family were back and forth before then she speaks English just like I do there's no accent she also speaks Hebrew without an accent which is kind of cool and what do you think about American women registering for the draft now I think this is idiotic I don't think that women should be drafted because women are women and men were created on earth at least in large part to protect women I think that if women want to go to the military good for them if women are drafted no I don't think you should drop my wife or my daughter I think that's that's stupid and I don't think that women have the same physical capacity that men do and as far as Israel's ideas on women's military service Israel has a draft but the draft also allows women to sign up for national service so it's not a military draft it's also you can sign up for sure route Lumia which means that you zoo kind of tourism on behalf of the state and you can you can go out and you can recruit kind of support on behalf of the State of Israel price right hi Ben how can I prove stricter gun-control actually causes higher crime your input would be much appreciated okay so stricter gun control doesn't always cause higher crime it tends to it tends to the problem is that statistics are easy to cherry-pick in order to prove this in order to get the love of the left to acknowledge this what you really have to do is you have to take two comparable populations the left lace to say well Chicago has high gun crime rates but that's just because it's Chicago right if you tried the same gun control measures in Vermont who would have low crime rates ok well that's true because the people in Vermont don't commit crimes right so it's you have to find comparable populations it's very easy to cherry-pick statistics here that's why I tend to make the argument that one thing I can prove is the gun control does not work right I can't tell you the gun on gun control works better absolutely I can tell you that gun control simply does not work in the same way I can't tell you that that abstinence only sex education works better than comprehensive sex education I can just tell you comprehensive sex ed it doesn't work right which is true ok Luke writes hey Ben if you could set up a debate with the leftist of your choosing who would it be well President Obama because he's the most prominent and then I could and then I could make fun of him that's the I like I like to go after prominent leftist Ben this is also from Andrew Andrews writing a lot this week yeah if different Andrew I think is the Andy could you explain the left's infatuation with Islam they're quick to attack Jews and Christians they seem to bend over backwards to defend Islam sure the reason that they defend Islam is because for the left as I've explained before if the left sees a room and there was a guy with five dollars and one guy with one dollar in the room the left immediately assumes something terrible has happened the guy with five dollars has hurt the guy with one dollar when the left looks at global civilization who's successful in global civilization Christians and Jews they look at Muslims that are impoverished they live in back waters their countries are absolute crap holes the women are treated like garbage right so people like us we say well right because they bad values people haven't left egg that must be because Western civilization exploited them and hurt them and therefore they're victims right they're third-world victims and victims and left side ideas ideology are heroes and so these victim heroes have to be given additional benefits they have to be handed things trevor writes i see a lot of people who tried to defend Islam say Isis is to Islam what the KKK is to Christianity what would be the best way to go about attacking that statement okay what I would say is number one there may be some truth to that mildly in the sense that the KKK identifies as Christian I would say the most extreme Christians tend to be evangelical Christians who hate the KKK if you take extreme Christians the worst that generally an extreme Christian is going to do is baby Kate babysit your kid on a Saturday night the worst that an extreme Muslim is going to do is bomb your Canada sparrows right so the cake that's number one I'm not sure how I'm not sure how representative KKK is to Christianity I can't say the views of Isis are far more representative in the Muslim world this is the this is why I don't go to the Quranic analysis mode I don't think it's that important what I do think is important is how many people in the Islamic world agree with bad stuff a number of Christians who agree with KKK is minimal really minimal the number of people in Muslim world who agree with the basic worldview of Isis is actually relatively high it may even be a majority like we're used to American Muslims who are pretty moderate and orientation but most of the world is not American Muslims ninety-nine percent of Afghan he's believed that if you're homosexual you should be executed ninety nine percent okay so the ninety nine percent believe in honor killings like if your if your daughter has sex with the wrong guy you should go and kill her all right so that's you know that that is a significant problem within Islam if I look at an ideology and a majority or a borderline majority of the people agree with the most extreme version that's really harmful that's a far cry from a hundred people who are members of the KKK okay final question I'm starting to have time for all of these Ian Wright Abe and I'm an avid viewer over the podcast and you've helped shape my worldview I've read the book you recommended months ago the conservative heart I'm wondering if this fact this tactic can be used in conjunction with how did mate leftist or are they two diametrically opposed political strategies no they have to be used in conjunction so the conservative heart says you have to make a moral argument you have to make a moral argument for why what you're saying is good and reaches out to people and helps people I've said that you also have to in order for you to make a significantly effective moral argument you also have to name the villain so I say name the villain and then present here's why we care about you but first gif to name the villain right the rule in politics is a thing of it a sumo wrestling you have to take your opponent and throw them out of the circle right and you bring everybody else into your circle but first you have to throw your opponent out of the circle or everybody including your opponent is in the circle and he can recruit from within the circle this is what the left understands but the right seems not to okay that's all we have time for but we will be back next week with much much more and I believe it's either next week or the week after we're going to be doing Facebook live so you'll be able to watch us live on Facebook as we do it live and you'll be able to see when I when I say ridiculous things and Lindsay's laughing and if I make Lindsay dance indeed as promised earlier they'll be able to watch that live yet Lindsay's very excited about this I am less so but we will but we will have to see about how that goes I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
