the u.s. imposes tariffs China responds in kind but is the growing trade war a sign that something deeper and more unsettling is happening to the global system of rules and institutions this is inside story hello welcome to the program I'm Adrienne Finnegan last week it was Europe this week China step by step u.s. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium are taking effect and countries around the world are responding but the issue isn't just about trade President Trump talks about winning and what he calls better deals but it often seems like his real target is the web of international institutions and alliances that have evolved in the decades since the end of the Second World War often at the behest of America itself we have much to discuss with our guests today but first Kimberly halket reports from Washington he already stands accused of implementing trade policies that may in the end harm the United States and its allies the president Donald Trump is threatening even more we're not planning anything now but if they don't treat us properly we will be doing something thank you the United States made the first move in this trade dispute imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports now it's also considering doing the same when it comes to foreign made vehicles and auto part imports this despite warnings it could hurt America's car industry lead to countermeasures by top trading partners on Wednesday German Chancellor Angela Merkel sounded the alarm on a looming trade war itself I don't media much time we have tariffs on aluminum and steel it appears cars too will be imposed with tariffs when they're imported into the United States ladies and gentlemen this has the character of a trade conflict but the trade conflict isn't limited to America's European allies after the United States announced it would implement tariffs on up to 34 billion of Chinese imports China is also taking action to protect its own interests as long as the United States issues our so-called tariffs list China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests u.s. trading partners including the European Union China and Japan have voiced their concern at the World Trade Organization there's fear of a potential collapse of the rules based global trading system in general people want trade to be under a set of rules so that there's certainty and predictability and what Trump has done is totally undermine that system so it's not just what he's actually put in place it's what he's threatened to do and what that does to trust that trust faces further erosion Trump has long made clear his dislike of the WTO which governs the rules of international trade now elite drafts suggest the u.s. president wants to pull out of the WTO effectively up ending the global trading order it's been in place for more than half a century Kimberley hellcat al Jazeera Washington well let's bring in our guests for today's discussion joining us from Birmingham in the UK is Scott Lucas professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham from London were joined by Philip McGrane former economic adviser to the President of the European Commission and via Skype from Hong Kong is Pauline Leung managing director of Asia analytical welcome to you all Scott let's start with you can a trade war I don't want to get too bogged down in trade and tariffs but nonetheless that's where we'll start can a trade war between the US and China be one will one side come out of this victorious over the other no no one wins in a trade war let's just get that you know set out from the very start of this discussion one side may suffer less its trade and investment may be affected less it's jobs may be affected less in this case probably China but the whole point about international trade is not that it's a win-lose the whole point is is that each side benefits by building upon its strengths now that is what the trade the Trump administration is challenging the idea that Donald Trump has isn't that you have a cooperative relationship where both sides win in trade it is that one side wins in this case the u.s. because the other side is ripping America off it's as simple as that and more importantly he has key advisors people like Peter Navarre Stephen Miller Wilbur Ross who support that vision now in the long run America will lose jobs America will lose investment America will lose international standing that further roads it's economic power but the gamble that the traffic ministration is is that somehow they can get a short-term political benefit if not necessarily economic one that shows that they are tough and the rest of the world has to bow down to American wishes that's caught you see he has all these people around him who share his his view are they right is America being ripped off by the rest of the world well I'm sure that your other guests will be able to explain this in detail but frankly know there are other there always points of trade disputes between countries so for example we might talk that the United States has an issue with China supposedly seizing intellectual property or that China has manipulated the currency market but in general the United States has benefited from trade with China its benefited from trade with Asia has done so over the decades since the Asian economic machine was rebuilt after World War Two so when you talk about in general the protectionist approach to the American economy does not lead to economic benefit it might protect some jobs but it will lose far more jobs in the medium to the long term it might protect some small portion of the American industrial base but a larger part of the American industrial base whether it's automotive whether it's steel whether it's services that base will be eroded and that base will suffer losses if not sooner then at some point during the Trump administration's first term all right let's see what what Filipino grain has to say former economic advisor to the President of the European Commission Phillip Trump has said that tariffs on China are aimed at stopping the unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China and about protecting jobs given what you've you've just heard there is Trump gonna protect US jobs by starting a trade war with China no of course it's not he may protect a few jobs in a few protected industries but overall our protectionism is going to cost more American jobs than it creates and you can see that already with the steel tariffs which have been imposed hardly any Americans work in steel production and millions and millions work in industries of the use steel and of course everyone loses out from paying more not just for steel but for every product that contains steel I think what's really striking about this and you and your earlier your report to start alluded to it this is actually much much bigger than just a trade war of which there have been others in the past Donald Trump seems intent on blowing up the international trading system and indeed the broader international order and you know the United States has gone from being a enlightened hegemon underpinning the rules that provide stability and predictability to others to a rogue state that is setted blowing up the system and I think it's a very very worrying moment and the repercussions are much broader and so simply that the narrow economic ones are immediate economic loss pauline do you agree with that Pauline login in Hong Kong is the u.s. now a rogue state where the implications of the u.s. withdrawing from WTO rules and norms for example I think there has been far too much focus just on the dollars and cents the trade aspect I think there's now growing American perceptions of China not just as a rule spending competitor in trade and commerce but as an all-round threat and that is what I believe is underpinning that the fight and the poro that china is now an all-round stretch in not just in trade and business but in political domination and military aspects in technology suddenly there's a perception of China being a real huge threat so it's more than just trade it's it's this fear this this dawn of an an ice age in relations if you like with China that I think will continue so for the Trump administration Pauline this is about as far as you're concerned painting a rising China yes it is and remember that the this has the support bilateral supported Congress in one of the recent bills about Chinese investment in the United States it was passed four hundred to two Irene deaths that's you know you know bipartisan support so it is a perception of China as a threat this is more than just dollars and cents who gets you know to to win more in this trade or that trade or who gets to import an export more this is a much broader conflict Scott Lucas is the US a rogue state is it trying to destroy the global system of rules and institutions that if so why I don't think the US as a rogue state because I think American economic institutions many American political institutions want to maintain international order but Donald Trump in his inner circle are rogues they are the ones who have a particular vision which is that there is no need for international cooperation indeed that international cooperation is a threat and let me explain that by going beyond what Pauline just said I agree with her that key Trump advisors see the fight with China is being foremost that includes former advisors like Steve Bannon the White House chief of staff but two things one is is that Donald Trump can hold that idea of China as a threat while quite liking the Chinese leader Xi Jinping because he admires G's strength and secondly this war and it is a trade war he's not just with China it is with the European Union Trump doesn't believe there should be a European Union it is with Canada Mexico Trump doesn't believe there should be a North American Free Trade Area it is with the Pacific no trans-pacific partnership in other words the United States is not America first here it is Trump's America alone against everyone else and that is a rogue approach that can cause nothing but harm to America and to other countries as well so what are the implications cut of all of this for other institutions that came into being at the end of the second world world Bretton Woods institutions NATO this is the greatest crisis since 1945 let's just say this point-blank it's greater than the crises we faced over the duration of the Cold War it is certainly greater than the post Cold War challenges that we faced because every institution political economic social is under threat you refer to NATO for example in a few days time Donald Trump will go to the NATO summit having said that NATO is obsolete having said privately a couple weeks ago to European leaders that he thinks NATO should go the way of NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement they should be dismissed and that within a couple days after that he replaces that international meeting that challenged a NATO with what Donald Trump really admires which is a one on summit with one-on-one summit with Vladimir Putin of Russia in other words for Trump and his advisors you really are talking about the idea that their authority Rhian elites that lead countries and that's where power resides they can live with Putin's Russia they can live with Kim's North Korea they can live with air to ones turkey because they can work with them individually rather than having these messy international institutions that are supposedly ripping America off Philip McGrane how do you respond to that is this the greatest crisis since 1945 what's to be done I think it is the biggest challenge to the liberal order since its creation in the years after the Second World War you know they've been previous spats over defense issues for example over Iraq there have been previous trade distributes there's never been a u.s. president who has utter disdain for his allies in the European Union and in NATO more generally there's never been a u.s. president that has set out to destroy the international institutions that America created and there's never been a u.s. president who has declared trade war on all and sundry at the same time and I think it's a very worrying moment indeed now for the European perspective this could go one of two ways one Trump might succeed his aim of causing the disintegration of the European Union and certainly he has allies within the EU who have a similar agenda for example the idea salvini the head of the league which is now in government in Italy or indeed the Prime Minister's of Poland or hungry the other alternative is that you know the threat of Donald Trump could lead to closer integration within the EU that's the agenda of French president Michel it's an agenda that is shared in a more lukewarm basis from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and needs must potentially this could this this could lead to a big leap forward in European integration in terms of taking greater responsibility for its own defence and indeed as we're already seeing pursuing a much more vigorous trade policy that goes around the United States I know by concluding all sort of trade deals with different countries with Donald Trump Philipp saying things like he said in North Dakota last week that the European Union was set up to take advantage of the United States we can't let that happen he said I mean is that likely to drive more European integration to drive European states closer together that kind of language well first of all it's factually untrue the predecessor of the EU the whole European integration project was supported by all previous US presidents because they thought that it was a way of creating peace stability and prosperity first in Western Europe and then in Europe as a whole remember that you know this mergers a peace project after the devastation of the Second World War and during the Cold War so that that's factually incorrect now he is going to do his best to drive Europeans apart whether it's by playing a divided rule by currying favor with his ally populist authoritarian far-right allies he's clearly set out on a trade war that's going to hit Europe as well as China he's undermining and potentially going to even pull out of NATO and so yes it's an existential challenge for Europe and for the global system and Europe has to rise to the occasion Pauline what's your take on this America may be in the view of Scotland and Philip was agreeing him with him a rogue state but Donald Trump is a democratically elected president what's to be done about this well basically the the potential good news is that in the American democracy the president is elected for his four years and maybe he won't be the President of the United States you know in the next election the the thing is that there is a perception right now that Trump is the United States and of course he is because he's the president but he is the United States only the four years of his term so there may be people in the EU and Japan and Canada says yes working to react and we're going to deal with whatever he throws at us but let's not go all the way let's take a look you know in another couple of years what's going to happen are the Americans still going to be gung-ho after an American America first America alone president or are they going to say take us we got it all wrong so I think that right now while all different various governments the for the Chinese whether it's the the Canadians or the your Japan they're likely to be very grown-up about this and say yes we're going to react to specific things that the Trump administration is throwing at us but let's not go sort of let's not hyperventilate just yet it's God do you agree with that it is it matter if the rest of the world takes a grown-up approach to what Donald Trump is doing oh absolutely I mean this we're talking about economics here but it matters on the environment it matters on social issues it matters on basic rights but I let me take pick up on what Phillips said because I agree and want to extend that and that is from the challenge that we face there are opportunities and in the case of Europe it is whether the EU which is facing the dual threat of Trump and of brexit Britain whether it really gets its act in order in terms of economic Arrangements social arrangements even mutual defense the Chinese right now will already be planning they'll be facing Trump and they'll be planning for how do we deal with an international system where the Americans are in a sense off to the side and they'll be making arrangements in Asia for example other countries will be looking to develop a trans-pacific partnership or will be looking to develop international institutions while treating the Americans almost as a case which is in suspension that's not optimal it would be better if the Americans are inside the international system but I think what you have is in the next 12 months 24 months before Trump goes and this is where I would slightly differ with Pauline these questions will be faced as core questions in which other countries no longer see it as a question of following the u.s. lead but having to make their own arrangements and not be dependent on American involvement for those arrangements to work the the surprising thing I think has been not how easy it's been for Trump to attack these alliances and at institutions that have been around since the the end of the Second World War but just how fragile they seem now that they they're under attack do you agree with that well surely these institutions were underpinned by us power you know underpinning the system of multilateral rules was the fact that the dominant power in the world in its enlightened self-interest was underpinning but then obviously if that dominant power does that decides otherwise then everything starts to fall apart now what's quite striking is that you know the United States is a is a declining a hegemon it's threatened by the rise of China and indeed other emerging powers and normally what happens in situations like that is that the declining heaven on tries to preserve the international system it created in order to preserve its status and preserve its power and prosperity and instead of that you see the rising power which is China saying actually were keen on most of the system that exists and the declining hegemon the United States saying actually wanted to blow it up now Trump says well that's because the old system was rigged against us and we're going to create a new one by bilaterally acting tough and excluding better concessions and house of others the reality is that actually it's he is blowing up American prosperity and blowing up American power and even if Donald Trump is ejected from office in 2020 by US voters he'll have done so much damage that it will be very hard for future US presidents in different circumstances to be real to rebuild what he's demolished Pauline very briefly can these alliances and institutions survive long enough to outlive Trump's presidency you sounded and note of optimism a few moments ago well yes in the sense that if the presidency doesn't if he doesn't go for another term then yes you know okay we'll righted office as four years of madness that somehow just descended on the United States but a bigger problem here is that it's not just Trump there seems to be a sea change in a political reaction to globalization to free trade that was was considered it's the most wonderful saying no one ever questions it but look at brexit look at the fact that one in two voters voted for Trump there is a reaction to globalization maybe blowing it up this is the right way but they want there is a demand at grassroots we want something more than just the globalization the free trade that has been you know the state just quote for the past quicker 10 years or whatever picking up from what Paul you were saying you know what if what if Trump does get elected of course there are midterms in the u.s. in November how's that how the midterms actually impacting upon Trump's behavior right now I mean does it go to some way to explaining what he's doing right now is he got one one eye on the midterms oh it's absolutely essential not just for Trump but for the key campaign advisors against Stephen Miller and that is because they see two issues is being key to running to hold the Congress in Republican hands in November one is the idea of trades and tariffs America showing its dominance over others and to on the home front that get tough zero tolerance policy on immigration that has split up families and put children in detention their gamble is there's that enough Americans like that macho alpha male approach no matter how much damage it causes that the Republicans will actually hold on to Congress and Trump can look forward to a second term if they're right and if the Republicans do succeed in November then we are in for turmoil for quite a while if however they're wrong and the voters actually turn against the Republicans then I think that will force a reassessment sooner rather than later and we may get out of this not unscathed but at least with less damage than what I'm fearing at this point and there I'm afraid we must leave it when he thinks indeed Scott Lucas professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham Philip McGrane former economic adviser
