militant feminists Jodie Allard is back at it after writing a piece essentially calling her sons complicit in rape culture after I offered one of her sons an internship I know he sends a resume he would through a late last week for an internship for unspecified reasons allard has now written a follow-up attempting to explain herself she wants to explain why writing nasty things about her children is not quote unquote abusive first she explains people are misinterpreting the terms rape culture and toxic masculinity she doesn't mean that all men are potential rapists she only means that society promulgates the belief that women are blamed for sexual violence and misogyny well normalizing sexual violence and aggression she also says toxic masculinity it only means that society has visions of masculinity that are toxic yes that is much better Jodie I'm sure your sons will be very very grateful for your clarification man she moves on to her explanation about why she would invoke her own sons in attacking these pernicious structures here's what she writes quote with those definitions out of the way it should be clear that discussing how particular men even my children absorb these cultural ideas is in no way abusing them well she did a little bit more than that her original piece said this about her own sons quote I don't feel emotionally safe with them and perhaps never have with a man but it needs to be said because far too often we are afraid to say it those little boys grow into men who know the value of women the value that's been ascribed to us by a broken system and it seeps out from them in a million tiny toxic ways according to a learned oh she's just educating her kids in the pages of the nation's largest newspapers should I encourage my sons to reflect on their own cultural indoctrination into racism sexism ableism etc without shame without shame in the pages of the Washington Post she wrote direct quote my sons are part of the problem that is not education and that is public shaming she then reiterates her central contention that men always make women feel emotionally unsafe which is kind of weird given the functioning relationships between billions of men and women in the history of the planet but Allerton contends quote the heartbreaking part is that even good men can't be fully or completely safe for women even when they're our own flesh and blood she concludes quote there's no doubt that writing about this journey opens my family up to examination and criticism however it's better to suggest that my sons are the ones bearing the burden except that they are which is presumably why one of her son sent me a resume even if you later withdrew from consider and ben shapiro this is a Ben Shapiro show so many things to get to today weird things happening right before the show that we will have to discuss on air to the detriment of one of the new producers over here a fellow named Marshall but we will discuss all of that in just a few moments first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at ring so rings mission is to make neighborhoods safer the summertime is when a lot of home burglaries actually go up

pick this up if I'm in New York or something so nobody knows that I'm not at home okay so I want to get to the mooch this is this is scaramouche e Anthony Skinner Moochie is the new press head a head of press over at the Trump administration he probably will end up as chief of staff because Trump looks like he's getting ready to clear house I've heard from Marshall that he is very hot right now or he's hot or something I don't understand I don't understand what in the world that was this morning Marshall who is new here turns to me and says mooch is hot right I was like what just what now what what mmm-hmm what I regret nothing okay thank you for that Marshall I'm glad you regret nothing you might win your paycheck fails to come next week in any case we'll get to the mascara mochi at the White House in just a moment because it does say something about where the where the Trump administration is and where they are going there's a lot of turnover I also want to get to Jared Kushner because Jared Kushner finally put out an 11-page statement he's supposed to give it before Congress today he's supposed to testify and it really does give the lie to a lie if what he's saying is true then the media have been fibbing this whole time which would not be a tremendous shot but I want to start today with the situation over in Israel so over in Israel there has been been riots there was a situation over the weekend in which an evil 20 year old Palestinian Arab went into a Jewish home broke into a Jewish home they're a bunch of five kids at home I think and they were celebrating the birth of a new boy and they're having what's called a Shalom johor which is a celebration that you have when there's a newborn baby boy and people were over and after that it was late at night and the the grandparents and the parents were sitting in and talking and the Palestinian air broke into the house and stabbed to death all three three of the four people the other the fourth person was stabbed as well so three people are murdered in their own home here's a picture of the floor so people should see what this looks like it's just horrifying and that's that is the the family's blood all over the floor the Palestinian Arab was shot to death by an off-duty soldier who came running from next door the reason that all of this happened why did all of this happen this happened because there are two pound three Palestinians who invaded the Temple Mount with guns shot two Israeli Druze police officers they weren't Jewish they're Druze which is different religion and and killed them this is last week and Israel and response said hey we're going to put some metal detectors by the entrance to the Temple Mount that's what we're going to do okay now we have metal detectors here in the United States everywhere right we have them at the airport we have them at ballgames we have them at some offices we have the public schools now have you ever heard of a riot over a metal detector well Palestinians decided it was very important to riot over the metal detectors here's a poster of what they were what we're saying and you can see that they are cheering the the so-called uprising hours before that murderous attack Fatah encouraged Palestinians about saw by the way military arm of the Palestinian Authority to rage and called for escalation and glorified death and says if I fall I will not be the first to die and not the last to die hashtag rage hashtag Friday of dignity this is the Palestinian government okay this is not a terrorist group is the Palestinian government military arm and some people say that Israel has a peace partner that an absolute absolute horse crap it is not true at all you want to see Israel's Palestinian peace partner here's the mother of the twenty year old who murdered a family for no reason other than because he had been whipped up to rage by his own government over the installation of metal detectors at a holy site that Israel allows Muslims to keep control of for no apparent reason here's the mother and then obeys Allah I am proud of my son Islam may Allah be pleased with him okay so she's praising her son who had killed in the terrorist attack after murdering three innocent people just horrific all the way around and should be demonstrative of the fact that when it comes to this so-called cycle of violence there's only one side that wants to engage in random violence and Cheers there okay the government of the Palestinians cheers this stuff there is no moral equivalence here anybody who says there is lying to you you're looking at the face of evil right here her son is an evil person and the Palestinian government is evil as well it is just horrifying on every level okay so in other news back in the United States the the important news is a the Jared Kushner Trump's son-in-law is supposed to speak today before congressional committees and his testimony explains all of his contacts with various Russian government connected sources over the course of the campaign and the transition and it's very plausible I mean honestly when I read I believe it it's absent extra evidence absent external evidence of malfeasance or bad action I'm not seeing anything here that suggests to me anything nefarious between Kushner and the Russian government for example now there are apparently some financial relationships between the Trump Organization and Russian government sources I'll talk about that in a second but cushion' airs full scale summary of what exactly happened here is worth going through because the media is giving you the headline but they're not giving you the truth the media as always is exaggerating the Russia stuff so what the media headlines today say things like cushion or took for Russia meetings says no collusion okay but that's not the D that's not the full explanation I mean the reality is what he says that these meetings were basically nothing so for example he says when it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for president as normally happens a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign my father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries these were not contact I had initiated but over the course of the campaign I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries his first meeting with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign occurred in April 2016 at the Mayflower Hotel this is the same meeting where apparently jeff sessions met the russian ambassador he said winner said he met four ambassadors including Sergei Kissel yet we shook hands exchanged pleasantries and I thank them for attending the event he said this lasted less than a minute okay that was the source of a number of headlines over the course of last few months then there was a report from Reuters that he done a couple of phone calls with kiss plea act he says we checked all of our phone records I have no information about this I even asked Reuters what the dates were so I could check it I don't remember this happening and I have no evidence of it happening then there is the second meeting with the Russians okay so the second meeting with the Russians was the infamous Donald Trump jr. meeting that was one where every Russian in the Western Hemisphere came to this meeting and that was the one where Donald Trump jr. said that he was going to that he was hopeful that there'd be information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government militia nur says I had no idea what this was it was listen my calendar as done junior meeting I went there it was a big nothing they were talking about adoption by the time I got there and I even wrote my assistance in email but said can you please call me on my cell need excuse to get out of meeting he thought it was enough of a waste of time but he picked a phone call to get out of the meeting which is something that I do pretty much every day here at the Daily wire then finally he says that there was a third contact from a Rando emailer that meant nothing in he reported The Secret Service then there was a meeting on December 1st at Trump Tower with kis lyac and Michael Flynn and this is the one that a lot of people are circulating around at that meeting history accent he wanted to address US policy in Syria and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his generals kiss react hold Kushner the generals couldn't make it over to the United States and wanted to use a secure line in the transition office Kushner said there was none and asked if they had an existing communications channel at the Embassy we could use or they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to general Flynn so as you recall there was a big story about how cushion wanted to set up a secret back channel to talk with the Russians from the Russian embassy and it was such a weird suggestion that even the Russians taken aback by it well apparently what this basically is it sounds like winners just an idiot right Kushner said they said to him you have a secure line he said no do you have a secure line and that was the extent of the conversation and so did that sound like something nefarious no it doesn't and then finally December 13 collection errs they met with a person named Sergei Gourcuff who said he was a banker at the request of Kissel a act here's Kushner's account to the meeting the meeting with mr. Gourcuff lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes he introduced himself and gave me two gifts one was a piece of art from nimrod the village where my grandparents were from in belarus and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village which is an awesome gift I've tried it with my wife I just got to the garden get a garbage bag put some dirt in it I'm like happy Anniversary sweetheart any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false in fact I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office that's got to be fun you walk in with the transition officer like one bag of dirt okay after that he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy he said he was friendly with Putin expressed disappointment with us-russia relations under Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future there were no specific policies involved and no time was there any discussion about my company's business transactions real estate projects loans banking arrangements or any private business of any kind at the end of the short meeting we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings it's interesting here though the one thing he doesn't say is that there was no talk about Trump's investments because Gore Cobb leads up a bank called VEB which is a Russian bank under scrutiny by US investigators that finance the deal is according to The Wall Street Journal that financed a deal involving Trump's one-time partner in the Toronto hotel tower at a key moment for the project so the gore cop of all the meetings the glory cop one is the most suspicious but none of them is enough to really raise tremendous hackles at this point absent any sort of outside information which suggested media have been blowing everything out of proportion a big question here is why kosher didn't just come out and say that's a while and they'll write I mean it's so innocent then why wouldn't cushion or just come out and spill this right all these stories came out months ago you could have just said that meeting with Kissel a act here's what I said not a big deal calm down instead they let that simmer in rage for months at a time and again there's been there have been too many updates in the recent past about things that Trump and his team have said for us to take everything at face value but this is a very plausible story I don't see anything here that looks suspicious and again there's no evidence that Kushner at least was colluding with the Russians meanwhile President Trump is feeling more and more under siege and you can see that he's very angry because he feels like people are not defending him enough now it's hard to defend the president and his son after his son says things to the Russian government like I love it in an email exchange in which they offer support to them it's hard to defend Trump from that it's hard to defend Trump when Trump Kara falls through Remy's are things that are hard to defend it's hard to defend him on Syrian policy I'm happy to defend him when I think he's doing the right thing or where I think that the media have been lying about him so that's why I'm defending him on the cushion her stuff because I see no evidence that Kushner is lying and so the media's attempt to play that as cushion air is some sort of nefarious Russian source I think it's a bunch of nonsense that's not stopping Trump though like he's tweeting out how he feels really under attack I don't like the whiny stuff from the president he's a powerful man on earth he has a bully pulpit at his disposal is no person in the history of mankind has had and yet he's treating this as though he's a victim he says the phony Russian witch-hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians okay that's fine that doesn't bother me this is the part that bothers me as is very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back very little to protect their president okay first of all the idea that he that it is Republicans job to quote unquote protect the president when it is his job to tell the truth about things does not seem to me correct also this idea that carried people over the line there's legitimately maybe one guy in the United States you carry over the line electoral may Roy Blunt in Missouri every other race Trump ran behind Senate candidates in congressional candidates in fact Trump was a drag on the ticket a little bit that's just the statistical fact so this idea that everybody should be very grateful to him for their jobs it's just not true and again it's whiney like if you have something that you want to say just say it it's hard to read the failing New York Times with the MS on Washington Post because every story opinion even if it should be positive is bad again I agree with all the stuff but it's getting boring at this point I think that you know the fact is that all these newspapers have always been against Republicans and finally says if Republicans don't repeal and replace the disastrous Obama care the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand yeah I don't even know if that means and what the repercussions are supposed to be and he hasn't proposed a plan so again mr. president please buckle down to business and but the world's tiniest violin routine one of the things that I said when they appointed a special prosecutor on all this Russia stuff is now would be a good time to shut up just stop your stop talking right now be a perfect time for you to sit back let the investigation take place you can say listen it's moving forward I'm not at liberty to discuss it nobody's a liberty to discuss it he's doing what he's going to do it'll be what its going to be end of story instead it continues to foment and it continues to foment because Trump insists on doing stuff like this from people who think that this is the sort of fighting back that we need let me just ask why this is productive like his base I understand is very enthusiastic about all of this but I don't understand why this is productive in forwarding his point of view like we all understand where he stands on this stuff right we all get it but Trump is starting to create an administration that is solely designed around guarding him personally and guarding his ego personally and that's not how things are going to get done for people who want things to get done who want him to be a good president and yes things have to get done in order for him to be a good president he's going to need to focus less on defending his own ego and more on promulgating policy but people like he's doing some good things I mean I talked about this last week the regulatory cuts the fact that there is a 16 to 1 ratio between regulations that are being cut and new ones that are being imposed that's a really good thing more of that more judicial appointments more cabinet appointments more tax policy there are lots of things that Trump could be doing right now more religious freedom legislation there's lots of good things that are very important in terms should be doing right now they're not getting done because Trump is engaged with Trump and I think the scarer Moochie appointment is is some of that for sure I'm going to scare Moochie appointment in just a second the world's hottest man according Marshall but before I get to any of that I first want to say thanks to our sponsors over

are a few things you need to know about Anthony scare emoji and this is indicative of where the administration is going to go Anthony scare emoji gives a lot of money to Democrats now that's not a shock Trump gave lots of money to Democrats but until 2010 he maxed out for Obama in 2008 he gave money to a bevy of Democrats he is a Wall Street hedge fund manager he's sort of mini Trump like he ran a capital group called skybridge capital it has underperformed the market but he's really big in the press and he likes to talk big on TV he's known as being a media savant he's known as the muj which is always a great nickname he has described his politics being socially inclusive and fiscally responsible so he has tweeted out a lot of things that are very much to the left he tweeted out in 2012 but we the USA has 5% of the world's population but 50% of the world's guns enough is enough it is just common sense it applies it applied more controls so he wants more gun control he's also said that he's also said that he is for gay marriage against the death penalty and pro-choice so there's that he says he favors a plan that provides universal health care but we've but better than Obamacare he was critical of Trump in 2015 he had to apologize to Trump actually and now he has become a very ardent supporter on Trump over and over he has defended Trump so he is he's a drunken I mean that that's basically his job his job is to praise Trump and to look like a Wall Street guy while doing it my own assessment of his hotness is that as Marshall was asked my own assessments of his hotness is that as someone online said he looks like an extra from the wolf of Wall Street who wouldn't stop badgering Leo DiCaprio for a selfie that's sort of the feeling that you get from Anthony scare Moochie he did a good job in his first press conference because he's much smoother than Sean Spicer he certainly reflects Trump a lot better than Sean Spicer and he is not afraid to kids a little Trump ass that is for sure so this is this is an astonishing Club so this is scary Moochie from the press conference on Friday and here is scaramouche appraising Trump in terms that would make Kim jong-un blush but here's what I tell you the president he's the most competitive person I've ever met okay I've seen this guy throw a dead spiral through a tire I've seen him at Madison Square Garden or the top coat on he's standing in the key and he's hitting foul shots and swishing them okay he sinks three foot putts I don't see this guy is the guy that's ever under siege this is a very very competitive person obviously there's a lot of incoming that comes into the White House but the president's a winner okay and what we're going to do is we're going to do a lot of winning oh except these were that I've seen this guy I mean it does sound like a Kim jong-un promo like for a while in North Korea they were saying to Kim jong-un have the lowest score ever in golf that he had scored an 18 in golf that he had 18 holes in one like this is part of the legend of Kim Jong moon his unicorn lair and he scores 18 in golf because every hole is all in one that that's basically and even throw a spiral right through a tire I mean he just goes out there like Brett Favre and his Wrangler jeans in his off days I mean the man can throw it 70 yards on a dime boom hit the guy right in the hand it's unbelievable and when he plays basketball I mean he's got a hook that would make Kareem just blush he's incredible you see him on the offensive glass pounding those boards incredible have you ever seen him in baseball he goes 173 miles an hour and that's his curve he's unreal it's just like wet right now so I understand that this is that basically every time anybody from Trump administration is on TV they're on TV for Trump right I mean that's what they do for a living it's not about getting out Trump's met per say is more about getting out a message to Trump that you are loyal to Trump and so now Trump is surrounding himself with lots of Louis now that said scaramouche is much better at his job because apparently he has no shame I mean if you can get on TV and say stuff like that with a straight face good for you dude I mean that's pretty impressive he I do love this though he obviously scorns the press he obviously just like he's willing to slap the press a little bit this was the end of his little presser on Friday son s thank you it looked blows the maquettes he blows them a kiss at the very end it's pretty amazing so that's that's pretty incredible gara mochi is in what this means that he's going to parrot the worst excesses of Trump so basically this Trump administration so far the concessions that Trump has made to the conservative wing have been pushed out of him I would say they're not coming from the heart I think it's hard to say that the Trump is in his guts a conservative person on regulations I think you don't have to push him very hard because as a business person he suffered with regulations for his entire career in real estate but I think that when it comes to things like Obamacare when it comes to things like judge course the gentleman see these are things he cares about particularly much and so he sort of delegated them out the people who force him to the right are the ones who are now on the outs with him because every time Trump feels like he's being mobilized for a policy he feels like he's being used and he doesn't like being used and so his new shtick is to surround himself with people who agree with him on who were going to pat him on the back that's not really good for his administration I'm going to explain what that means in just a second but for that you're going to have to go over to Daley

rumors today that Rex Tillerson the Secretary of State is going to be out by the end of the year that would be a good thing as Rex Tillerson sucks his Secretary of State who is a crappy pick in the beginning I opposed his pick in the beginning and so that would be a good move a bad move however would be getting rid of Jeff Sessions so the fact is that the the Jeff Sessions is is one of the more conservative members of his administration there's a reason tucker carlson and ann coulter are working on on president Trump on this and trying to get him to back off the sessions but sessions is a great case in point of what Trump is doing right Trump is and great sessions not because he thinks he's doing a bad job I think sessions is doing a bad job on asset forfeiture on simple asset forfeiture which is this idea that if you are picked up on a crime the government can just seize your property which is a crazy crazy law but sessions has ramped that up that however is not like Trump is angry him Trump is angry at him because he's not protecting him from the Russia stuff so he tweeted this morning about four hours ago quote so why aren't the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered Attorney General looking into crooked Hillary's crimes and Russian relations okay first of all our beleaguered attorney general is mostly beleaguered by Trump at this point and this idea that he should be looking into crooked Hillary crimes in Russia relations President Trump is one pledged that sessions would not do that if he was appointed plus sessions works for him so he could just call him into the office and say I want you to investigate this or I'm going to fire you but he's basically just trying to push sessions out at this point he's angry at sessions as he said to the New York Times because sessions recused himself on the Russia stuff sessions is one of the more conservative members of the administration sessions is on the out Bandhan apparently is on the outs Reince Priebus the Republican Lackey who's the chief of staff he's on the answers talk about scarer Meucci basically taking over over the weekend scaramouche II was on one of the weekend shows and he said that if he finds leakers in the White House he doesn't just mean in the Communications Office anywhere in the White House I'll fire them that's the language of the chief of staff's you've got this career Democrat scaramouche II who only in the last seven years started campaigning with like Romney and then Jeb Bush he is now going to be the chief of staff I think is the direction this is moving as I say a lot of the conservative influences like sessions are going to be out there is a rumor I'm Rudy Giuliani would be nominated for the post another New Yorker zoom in more than most New York administration in human history I like Rudy Giuliani but putting Giuliani in is just another person surrounding Trump who is going to not stop Trump from his own excesses scaramouche II himself clearly is not going to do that I mean he was on one of the sunday shows and here was Skinner Moochie saying I mean this is just in confidence actually this is scaramouche II saying that somebody told him that the Russians didn't hack and then when Pratt he gives an answer somebody said to me yesterday I won't tell you who that if the Russians actually hack this situation and spilled out those those emails you would have never seen it you would have never had any evidence of them meaning that they're super confident in their deception skills and hacking my point is all of the information isn't on the table yet but here's what I know about Anthony Anthony finish we make a lot of assertions here you I don't know who this anonymous person is it said that if the Russians had actually done it we wouldn't have been able to detect it but it is the data that it was that it was the president okay it's the cleitophon I usually call me he called me from Air Force One yeah and he basically said to me hey you know this is it maybe they did it maybe they didn't do it on insane insane okay so he starts off that conversation with I'm not going to tell you who it is it's the president okay there's a problem with doing this okay number one it was an actual Russian talking point the Russians are now confirming and so are people in the room that Putin actually said to trump if we attack you wouldn't know about it because they'd be so good at it and now it's Karamu cheese saying the Trump is repeating those talking points to scare Moochie I understand the Trump is frustrated with the Russian stuff shut up dude it's not worth it okay just pursue your agenda you've got the Republican Party behind you that's as much as you're going to have behind you at this point you struggling like this is not going to be helpful secure Moochie saying that he's humoring the president when the president says that there was no Russian hacking okay the four top intelligence agencies the DNI the FBI the CIA all these places right say that there was Russian interference in the election not hacking election machines it's not Russian election hacking but there was a hack on the DNC perpetrated by the Russian government and disseminated by the Russian government in order to damage our electoral system okay Skinner Moochie is like how is that helpful Trump spent the last several months battling this rumor that he doesn't actually think this half and and so he's not taking the Russian threat seriously and then squirming she goes out there and says well somebody said this to me and tapper goes well who and he goes trump is this the mark of a brilliant communications strategist I don't think so and you see this permeating the communications the communication scheme is that there are the people who want Trump to say the right thing and then there are the people who are just going to repeat whatever Trump tells them so you have you have scarer Moochie coming out and saying that he may not actually support the sanctions bill and then you had Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying the Trump does support the sanctions bill you had scaramouche's saying we talked about pardons then you had Jay Sekulow saying pardons are not on the table right I mean like they're contradicting each other seculow is his lawyer so seculow is trying to protect him from himself here's seculow talking about the pardon issue in that tweet stated something that's rather unremarkable and that is that under the Constitution that our article two section two the president has the authority to pardon but I want to be clear on this George we have not and continue to not have conversations with the President of the United States regarding pardons pardons have not been discussed and pardons are not on the table with regard to the issue of a a president pardoning himself there's a big academic discussion going on right now an academic debate you've got professor tribe arguing one point you got professor Turley arguing another point while it makes for interesting academic discussions let me tell you what the legal team is not doing we're not researching the issue because the issue of Barnes is not on the table okay see this is what the legal team isn't researching it we're not really looking at it here's scaramouche yesterday let's cut through it all okay you and I right here let's clear it all you're basically saying that that tweet is suggesting that the president's going to pardon himself and every one of his family members hi what do you what are you suggesting I'm saying he's not he's not going to do that I don't know buddy I am suggesting one thing the president waited about pardons and I'm asking you who is he thinking about pardoning that's all quite adjusting that'll why didn't the president's thinking about pardoning nobody because it has been coming up a lot there's an undercurrent of nonsensical stuff because he has asked advisers about it welcome come on Jake he's not allowed to this is the problem with the whole system he's the press the united states if i turn to one of my staff members at skybridge i ask them a question they run out to the news media and tell everything i'm thinking about is that fair to the president okay so you basically saying the Trump is talking about pardons so again this is not get your communication strategy in order guys and I think that the term administrator again if you want it to be successful you need him to to hem it in but that's not what's happened right Kellyanne Conway everybody is now auditioning it is the apprentice I mean it really is everyone who's auditioning for a White House job is more interested in pleasing Trump on TV than in actually making sure that he implements policies that are going to make him worthy of reelection Kellyanne Conway yesterday says you should be super you should be so happy that he's tweeting I mean come on like it's great good he's tweeting anybody also right there with a lot about television he tweet well so you should be happy about that you don't happy that we all emotional aged you should be happy that we have such an engaged president but you know 99% of what the president doesn't says is not on Twitter it's done in the Oval Office it's done in his cabinet meetings of meetings with different cabinet members okay that's fine except for the fact that when she says you should be happy he's so engaged this is what Trump tweeted this morning quote Swezey Adam Schiff the totally biased Congress been looking into Russia okay so far so good spends all of his time on TV pushing the demos excuse and you're spending all of your time watching him on TV tweeting about it like why is this useful this is just not useful again I would like to see some some victories come on okay I was promised winning will tear the winning where's the winning come on let's do it okay and I don't mean winning like he stands on his top coat he makes chance from the top of the key I mean like actual conservative wins that we can put our finger on and say this is why we elected Republicans to high office and look not all of that is fault Congress isn't doing its job Congress is incompetent this is why presidential leadership is necessary Congress knows that there is no risk to them in a voiding trunk at this point in just bucking Trump Trump has to make it risky Trump has to go out there and make the case for his agenda and then he has to go out there and say to Congress if you buck my agenda there will be consequences okay Obama did this even Bush did this Trump isn't doing that right now and it's very frustrating because he's letting Congress off the hook Congress is letting itself off the hook and Trump is more focused on surrounding himself with people who are going to agree with him so Kellyanne Conway is spending time talking about Robert Waller again a must is going to fire Robert Muller this is a waste of time so maybe you will fire Robert Mullin but if he fires the special counsel all hell is going to break loose because that special candidate that will look like a cover-up when you start firing the special counsel before the special counsel even comes up with anything I mean this is not good you can see the White House already paving the way for this here's Conway doing this routine why doesn't the president just want Muller to prove that Trump is right that Russia was a hoax why doesn't even Muller to go ahead and confirm that for him well is it mr. Muller and his band of Democratic donors doing that aren't they trying to do that okay so she's obviously claiming the mullahs bias again president Trump considered him for FBI director okay so it's dead this is all it's a wait the reason why doesn't matter why doesn't Matt why can't I just be happy why can't I just sit here and be happy the reason I can't be happy is because the Democrats are sitting over here just waiting the Democrats don't have to do anything all they have to do is sit over here and wait for Trump to implode all over himself and they're waiting in the wings with a policy that is going to be so horrible that is going to destroy everything that Trump is supposedly trying to build okay so here is Chuck Schumer yesterday talking about what comes next for Obamacare this is the senate minority leader who if he gets lucky could be the senate majority leader by 2018 and certainly has a very good shot at it by 2020 if things keep going this way here's Chuck Schumer one of the world's worst leftist talking about what the Democrats are going to do if they take power again then we're going to look at broader things single-payer is one of them that is our Medicare well sure many things are on the table Medicare for people above 55 is on the table a buy into Medicare is on the table buy into Medicaid is on the table okay so they're talking about a full-scale nationalization of the health care system essentially getting rid of insurance companies altogether and instead everybody would just work for the government basically the government would decide what people are paid this would completely destroy the American health care system as we know it and they are talking about doing this openly now because Trump care has failed because Trump can't make the case and I'm sorry firing off a few tweets and riding around in a fire truck is not going to do it when you're really when you're real focus is on Muller and scaramouche II and the TV and if somebody's on to be praising you in in terms that are sick of phanzig enough for your liking okay please mr. president focus please for the love of the country for the love of the country please focus on pressing your agenda okay I didn't go for you but you can prove me wrong you proved me wrong with the election you can prove me wrong again prove that you can do this job prove that you are capable I'm gaining the sort of wins that we were told you again not cursing at the media anybody can do that that's not a hard job contrary to popular opinion that's a very easy job all I'm asking is that you give me some reasons to praise you because I would like to do so you're my president okay they're all of our presidents even though people don't like you okay before I get to things I like and things I hate I first want to say thank you to some new sponsors so why do we have stage country's taxes Wars when did globalization start why does history matter wonder II has a brand new podcast now from a PhD historian Patrick Lyman it's called tides of history and it is really fascinating I've listened to the first three episodes I believe the intro and the first couple episodes it's really well done and he takes on some issues in history that haven't really been covered too much so he takes on the period 1350 to 1650 and he talks about why the roots of the modern world start there like why are there states in the first place why aren't we just a bunch of separate fiefdom how was it that states became the predominant way of doing business why is it that there's free trade how did these trade routes get started how did capitalism begin where to globalization start right all of these forces that shape our modern world begin in that post medieval era just before the during the Renaissance era and just before the just before the Enlightenment and that's the period that he takes on in tides of history really well researched interesting stuff he makes what could be very dry history very interesting go listen to the first episode of tides of history by searching for tides of history on your podcast player or Google tides of history today go to link on the screen and it is listen you know you can listen you can learn you can subscribe the podcast again it's called tides of history and it's really good you should go check it out at iTunes SoundCloud wherever you get your podcast subscribe and give it a listen I love history and this is really good history even if I disagree with some of it it's really informative and interesting okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like I've started reading this book heavy reading I've been into some doing some heavy philosophy reading in the recent past this is a book that was recommended to me actually by a professor Jordan Peterson over in over and Canada when I was up there giving a speech and he was talking about philosophy and the in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of God and he recommended this book the metaphysical club a story of ideas in America by Lewis Manan it won the Pulitzer Prize and it is a really interesting read relatively easy to read actually it's about for real thinkers at the beginning of the 20th century Oliver Wendell Holmes of course the Supreme Court Justice William James is the father of modern American psychology charles sanders peirce who's been largely forgotten but was a logician of the first order and it's it's and john dewey who's sort of their intellectual heir and the father of the progressive movement the reason this is important is because you can see how deeper philosophy is siphoned into what the West's philosophy is today John Dewey was the father of progressivism in the United States you can't understand the modern day barack obama democratic party without reading about John Dewey and his ideological forebears and why it is that the natural law the natural law philosophy of our founders was cast aside in favor of the legal positivism of people like Oliver Wendell Holmes and the and the progressivism of John Dewey so you can check it out the metaphysical club really good read okay other things that I liked is that I was just a beautiful video so there's a stepson who he was adopted who you know his mother married a stepfather an 11 year old Tyler from Conyers Georgia he wanted he goes to his stepfather and reads him a letter and asked him officially to become his father via adoption his stepfather has been in Tyler's life since the boy was 18 months old and first it was set up as though this was a baby shower and then and then they start and then they start taping it here is here's Tyler reading a letter it is stuff yet ok cool what we well I first like thought me otherwise a lot of funny you taught me a little bit you can read nice with almost all of them you gave me more than what I we I know that we were supposed to be other than funny people even say I look like that I had been your channel and we'll sit I'll remember but of the media comes illegally when you please a lot that's just awesome and it does it does show you know honestly one of the things that's been missing in so many communities black and white all over the country now is the presence of a father figure in people's lives and that's just beautiful and it shows you that fathers cannot be replaced okay I understand that we're now society that thinks that that sexes have no differentiation and that to women is the same as a man and a woman or that mother can do the same thing as a father you can do both not true okay fathers are necessary I know this from my own children I know this my own father okay fathers are necessary and and if a child is lucky enough to have a wonderful father there's nothing that can replace that it's just incredible so yeah this just a beautiful video and it's wonderful that that they were able to catch that on tape that we could all experience it because it's just a wonderful thing okay time for some things I hate so on the flip side on the flipside of this beauty is utter stupidity so Huffington Post had a tweet yesterday and so they tweeted at this tweet with this picture will show you that I want to get the exact tweet if I can find it they said that this picture will show you that periods are not just for women ok and this is a picture of a woman who has a butch haircut and and you can't really see the bottom of the photo she has bled through her pants and said periods are not just for women hashtag bleeding well trans no it turns out periods are just for women ok I'm sorry that you think your man but it turns out that you are in fact a biological woman and that is why I cannot have my period today nor can Malthus nor I believe commercial so all of this is just a bunch of nonsense and it's so stupid I saw that there's some amazing conversation online it's just incredible how stupid everyone has become this is amazing conversation online with it with some sort of trans advocate where somebody said ok so if I'm a dude and I have sex with a trans woman am I is that a gay sexual act right the trans woman still has the male parts and says no that is straight sex only if you are a woman and you had sex with the man with the male parts who thinks he's a woman would that be lesbian ok then alrighty that's kind of ok the this person who put up this picture of caste clemmer posted a picture of herself bleeding from the crotch and the PO and posted a poem and said y'all know I'm trans and queer which and what that means for me all around is something that's neither there nor here it's poetry it's a happy scary middle ground so when I talk to ender inclusion and I wrote these rhymes to help you see I'm not trying to bring up something shallow periods are honestly pretty traumatic for me see my life is very clearly marked like a red border cut up a nation a time before and a time beyond the mark of my first menstruation is she now comparing this to like the Civil War a red border cut up the nation so let me take you back to the details I can still recall of the day I gained my first period or no and the day I lost it all I was 15 and still happy running around I'll chest bared and Buck climbing trees digging holes and no one gave a single bleep I think I think I mean I think my mom was worried so I went and grew out my locks a sign I was normal still a girl and painted a neon sign for my gender box so the day I got my period my god a day so proud this little and Rho F cup kid had been bestowed the straights its shroud okay I'm sorry that you're mentally ill I mean like really I please seek help I mean it really is sad it makes you kind of sick to your stomach honestly that somebody is living in this much pain because obviously this person is living in serious pain you're not a man and pretending to your man is going to bring you nothing but misery okay believing you're a man this is something that requires I don't know that there's a great treatment available but society pretending that you are a man having a period is not the solution to your problems nor is it the solution to the problems of many gender confused kids who are younger than 15 years old look do what you want okay it's your life do what you want but don't if you insist the periods are not just for women you are doing a grave disservice to both women and young boys who are believing things that are biologically incorrect it's just it's just come on I mean the idea that it's not an imposition on society of course it's an imposition on society as I say go do what you want no one really cares but when you start tweeting out things like periods are not just for women and you're featured at the front page of The Huffington Post requiring that everyone who agrees with basic biology is somehow forced to agree with your lie that you are a man it should no no okay other things that I hate the final thing that I hate so Richard Dawkins who is an atheist is a he has now been banned from Berkeley California there was a benefit event for chaos for a KPFA which is a listener funded station in Berkeley California tickets were snapped ahead of the ant ideas plan talked on August 9th they cancelled the event because it turns out that he said some mean things about Muslims they're fine with him saying mean things about Christians but as soon as Richard Dawkins said some mean things about Muslims was all over and KPFA cancelled the event they say they emphatically support serious free speech but we do not support abusive speech he's criticized religion publicly for decades and he's been no platformed he says he has strongly condemned misogyny homophobia and violence of Islamism of which Muslims particularly Muslim women are the prime victims but he is too conservative for Berkeley so he must not be allowed at their radio station he is a far leftist by the way Richard Dawkins he is not even close to a right winger he's a militant atheist who hates religion and is I believe a socialist on politics so this is so this idea that I mean you talk about the left eating their own okay I lied there's one more thing I have to show because it's just it's an important thing so Charlie guard his parents finally gave up on their appeal to the courts today the court said that the kid deserved to die which is just horrifying they said the kid has a right to die essentially and and so this is his parents you know we tried to get him over to the US I reached out to a few Congress people were trying to get him citizenship so we could extradite him from the UK they gave up their appeal because at this point it doesn't matter anymore he's basically brain dead and this is the parents reading the reading their announcement his body heart and soul they soon because his spirit will live on for eternity and he will make a difference to people's lives for years to come we will make sure that okay so just I hope that they do I hope that they keep fighting for the right to life and the right for the family to make decisions that the government should not be making but this notion that death with dignity means that you have to die in a hospital rather than striving to live it's one of my pet peeves you know when people have cancer you hear very often oh he's a fighter he'll make it okay whether you live from cancer or not has very little to do with whether you're a fighter I know a lot of fighters have died of cancer and I know a lot of people who don't seem like particularly strong people who live through cancer this idea that health problems are some sort of indicia of moral character it's stupid and it's also it's also immoral and immoral to suggest that death with dignity is more important that this child this child died sedated in the hospital rather than the parents doing the best they can to save the child's life even if you don't appreciate the kids quality of life it's not your decision to make okay so we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest updates I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
