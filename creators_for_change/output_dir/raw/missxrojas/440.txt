00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,319
about six or seven other books first

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,690
clockwork<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 by Matthew Kirby which is</font>

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,469
kind of a 10 to 12 age gap but it's also

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really enjoyable reminds me that</font>

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,869
not that we kind of rush forward and

18
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,070
lose our links with all the people who

19
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,390
are younger than us in some ways we

20
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,770
don't reach out far enough with people

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,759
my life firstly this book is physically

60
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,530
a really beautiful and loved books with

61
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,909
photographs when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't interrupt</font>

62
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,200
the flow protects the photographs in

63
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,670
here work pretty well the novel<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font>

64
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,350
a teenage boy called Jacob when Jacob

65
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,850
was younger his grandfather used to show

66
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,560
him his collection of photographs and

67
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,299
Tom stories about his day that an

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,250
orphanage in Wales fantastical stories

69
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,259
about his life on an island as Jacob

70
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,810
grows older he begins to reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,399
stories that his grandfather<font color="#CCCCCC"> Talton I</font>

72
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">resent in many ways that kind of his</font>

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,790
grandfather has lied to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him and said</font>

74
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these stories were true what really</font>

75
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">struck me in quite impressed me about</font>

76
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,840
the number was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly the darkness</font>

77
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,429
sprang into the story the dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams</font>

78
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">withdrawing it is a pretty dark story</font>

79
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:11,008
because bit so that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

80
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:12,629
creepy when that creepiness is really

81
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,920
helped by the fire

82
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
graphs because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's something</font>

83
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
about seeing an image and having it stay

84
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,569
in your head where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read the text</font>

85
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't create on text layer</font>

86
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,830
however horrific the image is or text

87
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">even that is later supported by an image</font>

88
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a description of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> photograph and</font>

89
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you'll see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> photograph so it</font>

90
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,280
allows you to create the photograph in

91
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,560
your mind before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the image in so</font>

92
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,000
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just really interesting play</font>

93
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,830
with images and text eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> jacob</font>

94
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,690
has led to go back to this island that

95
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,770
his grandfather used to tell stories

96
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,209
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> another thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't stop</font>

97
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about when i was reading was</font>

98
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,420
how we treat time and photographs how

99
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,560
they seem to be repeating the same

100
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,510
action constantly and infinitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

101
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,830
be a bit disturbing especially when it's

102
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,569
a photograph<font color="#E5E5E5"> from way back when and when</font>

103

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's photograph that looks directly at</font>

104

evil there's a weird displacement and

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,370
work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that was alluded to and</font>

106
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,230
discussed in certain ways by some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

action in the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do want give too</font>

108
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,840
much away because it does rely on some

109
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,310
sense and creepiness of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a moment of</font>

110
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprise and shock and all of that I</font>

111
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,370
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was really perfectly done so</font>
