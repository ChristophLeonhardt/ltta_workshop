the Senate hearings in regard to Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court pick continue and the second day included two topics that I think are incredibly important for you all to know about now we've touched on these topics in previous shows but today we're going to really do a deeper dive into these topics so the first topic at hand is whether or not Brett Kavanaugh believes the President of the United States can be indicted or whether or not the President of the United States should respond to a subpoena if he is being investigated well first let me set this up with a little bit of context what you're about to see is a video from the late 1990s 1998 I believe it's at Georgetown Law School and this very question was posed to Brett Kavanaugh and here's what he had to say that last comment raises the question whether the president is subject to criminal indictment at all which is a question that has been a lurking constitutional issue for for a long time in which at some point here should be resolved so that we can determine whether the congress or an independent counsel should investigate the president when his conduct is at issue I tend to think it has to be the Congress because of the kind of attacks that we've seen recently and because of the types of issues that were just pointed out it is war and if it's going to be war it's got to be Congress not an isolated prosecutor appointed by a panel of three judges we've never heard of I'd like to just take a little hand vote how many of you how many of you believe as a matter of law that a sitting president cannot be indicted during the term of office just raise it up for those of you who might not be able to see Brett Kavanaugh was one of the individuals on that panel who did raise his hand and this is important context for some of the questioning that Cavanaugh is now dealing with in these Senate confirmation hearings so there is real concern that Cavanaugh was specifically chosen by Donald Trump because he himself is being investigated there is a possibility that he will be indicted and so lawmakers want to know is Cavanaugh gonna do Trump's bidding yeah so before we get to today's testimony really important further context yeah you saw a lot of people raise their hands there and not just Cavanaugh and there's a huge difference between investigated and indicted so some people believe that robert muller also thinks that a president can't be indicted but if you don't do that do the investigation there is nothing for congress to work with so Cavanaugh's point there is disingenuous and first of all it shouldn't be war he says i should it's war no it shouldn't be about politics it should be did he do something wrong a high crime and misdemeanor and and second of all how would congress noted to invent to do the impeachment and and to take that kind of legislative action if there was no investigation so even if you think that he can't be indicted you certain no one in the right mind should think that the president is above the law and should never be investigated but Cavanaugh does make that claim and and especially after as we all know he's part of the Ken Starr report and and did the worst investigation from president in American history so during today's hearings Senator Dianne Feinstein from California asked Cavanaugh this very question do you believe that the president has to respond to a subpoena do you think the president can be subpoenaed and here is the interaction can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena so that's a hypothetical question about what would be an elaboration or a difference forum USV Nixon's precise holding and as a matter of the canons of judicial independence I can't give you an answer on that hypothetical question so you can't give me an answer on whether a president has to respond to a stuff subpoena from a court of law as my there's my understanding is that you're asking me to give my view on a potential hypothetical and that's something that the every each of the eight justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court when they're sitting in my seat declined to decide potential hypothetical cases he's playing dodgeball he's uninterested in answering that question it's very clear I just wanna make a quick statement drink before you jump in these Senate confirmation hearings I do think at some point they served a purpose but they no longer serve a purpose right like those long the Senate members of the Senate have decided how they're gonna vote like he can say whatever he wants to say he can lie he can dodge questions which he has done during the hearings so far and that's that I mean they've already decided how they're gonna vote and look I'm not saying that as you know a biased progressive because I think that even on the left they've decided how they're gonna vote members of the left said prior to receiving the documents that they wanted well I'm not gonna vote to confirm him I'm gonna vote against him okay so why are we wasting our time what are we doing yeah and then even the guys who are pretending to be contemplating which way they're gonna vote and there's someone on the left and the right so low the Democrats aren't really on the left the the mansions of the world well they're actually doing is playing politics do the problems have enough votes if they have enough votes and I'll boat with them because it won't make a difference if they don't have enough votes well then I then on to make a political decision as to which way to go it's not like they're listening to him go what is your thoughts on jurisprudence and and the Canon of the court no nobody's doing that and on the right there's the chaff flakes and the and the Rand Paul's that are pretending like well golly gee I really care about my principles like Rand Paul pretending to be a libertarian maybe so I'm going to aggressively question you about that it's a light touch right and then at the end of the day what do they do they vote with Trump every single time so there's a lot of theater being played here but most of all was that answer that was a the central part of the theater so it's not a complicated question and it's not a hypothetical it's a question about what is your belief about whether a president can be subpoenaed that is a question about the law you are going to be on the Supreme Court and you guys get to decide what the law is the the at least certainly the interpretation of the law it is a core core question the reason he does dodgeball is because he knows and it's not like he couldn't answer or you just saw my tape answer it so he's answered in the past you know what his position is he thinks the president is above the law and should subpoena means doesn't mean indicted subpoena means I'm going to get information about the president he believes the president shouldn't be subpoenaed you should never even get information about the president so you don't even get to find out if he did anything wrong or not okay that's why it doesn't answer the question and I've seen the Santos absolutely right this we're not unlike those guys are watching we're not partisan their left does this the right does this every time a guy sits in that seat they go oh my god first the zyb if any question they don't want to answer this is a hypothetical then they cite a random court case it doesn't matter which one it is nobody's looking it up and then they talk about the Canon of judicial independence prevents me from answering those hypotheticals so it's just it's the worst soap opera on television okay so the final part that I want to talk about is whether or not Brett Kavanaugh believes the president can pardon himself now that's something that Trump has weighed in on himself he believes that the president can pardon himself but what does Kavanagh think take a look Trump claims he has an absolute right to pardon himself does he the question of self pardons is something I have never analyzed it's a question that I have not written about it's a question therefore that's a hypothetical question that I can't begin with - or in this context as a sitting judge and as a nominee to the Supreme the other half of that is the obvious one because the president have the ability to pardon somebody in exchange for a promise from that person they wouldn't testify against him Sarah I'm not going to answer hypothetical questions of that sort I never decide anything alone I'm in a panel three and if I'm confirmed the Supreme Court I'd be on a team 89 but wait a minute everybody knows you're not answering alone what kind of answer is that yeah but we're asking you what's your opinion if we wouldn't ask other eight guys we would ask them okay so it once again falls back to oh it's a hypothetical is that a really a hard hypothetical if the president choose to pardon someone because they might testify against them well that's the definition of obstruction of justice why is that a that's like saying do you believe the president can murder anyone he likes well sorry sir that's a hypothetical I know isn't the whole point of these hearings not the whole point maybe 50% of the point of these hearings it's to give you hypotheticals and try to figure out how you would rule based on those hypotheticals right how you would decide on these cases the other half is trying to answer for you know the rulings that you've made in the past some of which were deeply problematic and we'll get to that later yeah and so where that hypothetical answer came from it was real in the beginning it's just been perverted now so if they gave you a hypothetical well okay there's a 17 year old daughter and should she get permission or not from her mom and whether she should get an abortion for example you say well that's a hypothetical because I don't really know the actual situation there would be so many more complicating factors in the real world if that was a case that's a good answer and that makes sense so that's why they didn't answer hypotheticals but these are not hypotheticals these are what is your judicial philosophy and so he's cheating as again almost all of them do oh well golly gee that's a high you know hypothetical they're not coming up with some elaborate scheme and try to get you to answer some scenario that you're not in they're asking you if the president pardons someone who would testify against them that seems like he's breaking the law every by every textbook definition that is illegal do you think it's illegal of drugs that's a hypothetical for God's sake right if they ask them can the president punch someone in the face or in Trump's example little issue someone on Fifth Avenue knows what Trump said would he be able to get away with it by the same exact so-called principal Cavanaugh would say that's a hypothetical I can't answer it's ridiculous and by the way from his earlier answer just so you know his answer is no he cannot be indicted and he can't be subpoenaed you can't even ask him if he shot someone on the face on Fifth Avenue that's amazing two easy ways for one has
