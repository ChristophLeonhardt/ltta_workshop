hundreds of EPA employees are no more under Trump times the ProPublica reported that the departures were buyouts retirements and individuals quitting but totaled more than 700 employees including more than 200 scientists have disappeared from the EPA despite the decrease in science posts there has been an uptick in political appointees at the EPA according to friday's report 73 jobs have been filled in the office of epa administrator scott pruett to replace 53 openings there has been a hiring freeze at the EPA one person one of the EPA workers unions representatives says that there was a hiring freeze of and the Trump administration seeks to get rid of 30 100 full-time employees and the budget hints at upwards of 4,000 so of course the EPA is under attack in addition to you know Scott Pruett being in charge of it who is suing the EPA when he took the post but Trump is still building walls to combat climate change that seems to be the only place he's taking a stand against climate change he's building two walls one wall will be 2,000 feet long while the other will be 840 feet long the time said the barriers will be made out of limestone rock and placed in front of holes 1 9 and 18 and his Golf Course in Ireland the Irish independent reported it there will be 38 thousand tons and so he's taking apart the EPA however and which seems to imply that he does not believe in climate change however his permit application to get the walls in 2016 he cited rising sea levels and extreme weather as it's reason to build the wall so what my favorite part of that story is we just earlier in the week told you that the Trump administration administration made the pentagon take out climate change as a threat to our military into our country he made them take it out even though they actually think it is a security threat and they've been saying it all along but when it serves his purposes he puts it in a permit to build the walls in Ireland oh my god climate change did you guys know rising sea-levels nobody knew about rising sea-levels until now so I need the walls and and unfortunately they approved it in the case of Ireland because actually there are rising sea levels that part is true and and what's going on at the EPA has more to do with a lot of things that affect the quality of water and air and and what's leaching into the water supply from the earth then even climate change you know EPA deals with the Superfund sites that have been we have been vastly compromised during the hurricane that remember in Texas the Texas hurricane we found out there all these the Superfund sites those are toxified areas that were being inundated with water so that all that toxic stuff was going everywhere well those are Superfund sites but now an ad fund at EPA and gun at EPA can't address so we're talking about real pollutants that are getting into the water supply of Americans add to that all the EPA restrictions which are being lifted I mean all those restrictions regulations as he's as he's called them that that effect of clean air and clean water across the board so what you're seeing played out of the EPA extends beyond climate change it extends to the air that we breathe and the water that we used to be able to drink yeah and in terms of the the damage that they're doing at the EPA so 700 employees gone already as per I told you but according to their budget they're gonna actually get rid of 4,000 employees at the EPA so if you thought put aside climate change pollution the Superfund sites all those things the streams in your neighborhoods well there's no more you know you like cops blue look these are cops to protect your family from something equally dangerous which is the poison in the air in the water etc and they've taken all the cops away so the robbers are world yeah and his cherry-picking of wet like it just proves that Trump is disingenuous period when it comes to his interest in preserving his own property he is saying I only essentially believe in climate change in the coast around my golf course that's the only time he thinks that it applies to anything and then when it comes to the EPA where you live he's like oh it's not a problem about climate change is not a thing don't worry about it it'll be totally fine which it's just proves that what he only uses these arguments when they bent it when they literally benefit him personally I hate look this is a guy who doesn't know climate change from nanka he he's he's he is regurgitating that which he knows is the party position on climate change and that with you but but the assault on the environment that he is unleashing and the EPA and the gutting of it is just one part of it the other part is allowing all of his corporate pals to do whatever the eff they want in terms of polluting those streams in terms of fracking and mineral exploitation on us parklands I mean what you're seeing is a selling out of this country and an assault on the environment on an unprecedented scale and I think the EPA is the tip of that iceberg yeah but to be fair to him he loves walls he does and and he knows how big the ocean is if you remember during the Puerto Rico disaster he said Puerto Rico is an island surrounded by water big water ocean water so maybe he realized oh my god Ireland also surrounded by big water the ocean water hey you know what the ocean is sending a lot of trouble to Ireland it's just sending some of its worst some of it you know some I'm sure it's a good ocean water okay but but but they need a wall Ireland needs a wall to keep out the dangerous ocean big ocean water I'm just trying to be fair - yeah he's been consistent on that if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and
