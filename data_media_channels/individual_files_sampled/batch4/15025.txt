when I was over in the UK they're still talking about the brexit right just over two years ago a majority of Brits voted to get out of the European Union for reasons of sovereignty and patriotism but also because of open borders and it was a it was like a warning tremor of what would hit America later that year in Donald Trump's presidency for the last two years the British establishment has been trying to push back against brexit and invalidate it even though was a democratic victory and they're still they're still going on about it they're still trying to deal Aegina mais it just like there's in America to try to deal agita mais trump 600 days into his presidency but I came across a clip on the BBC which is the worst network it's you know it's a state broadcaster like Russia today is but it's not even as good as Russia today and the Russian today you know you're getting Vladimir Putin's for you of the world but at least it's exciting and fun and well done the BBC is so dreary like you know you're getting the the elites point of view it's so awful some watch BBC and they have a guy on from the British sandwich Association now first of all if I was a Brit I would immediately join the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin because I love sandwiches I may have such interesting sandwiches over there they have like apple and cheese sandwiches you know they have all these things I can't even pronounce they're like chutney this and you know all that no no you know it's just British sandwiches so I would join the British sandwich so she Asian and they would say you have to be a sandwich company sir so I would obviously incorporate because I really would want to be part of the British Sam's Association I'd love a membership card I'd like you know if I were single it's a hey ladies you're looking at a VIP member of the British Sandwich sociation they'd look at me and they say yeah we could tell buddy anyways I'm joking around the fact that there is something called the British sandwich too so makes me laugh I actually googled it because I didn't believe it was real but here's their website the British sandwich and food to go Association member directory awards I would definitely win an award for sandwich eater of the year Members Only that's the spot that's the secret stuff sir I can't tell you a secret sandwich handshake events I would be at all the events I would just I would be like one of those Grateful Dead groupies just travelling around following the band all around the UK a man British sandwich the socio that's here crustless across on what kind of say anyways I didn't believe there was something called British Sammis Association but I checked them out and it's real because I didn't believe it because I saw this guy the boss or the British sandwich sociation saying if brexit is allowed to happen there will be no more good sandwiches in the UK you're probably thinking what are you talking about that sounds fake well yeah the Prince Sammis Association sounds fake to watch the head of the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin say people we cannot leave the European Union we cannot close our borders we cannot take back our sovereignty we not cannot keep our tax money because sandwiches won't be good anymore take a look what does No Deal mean for you for the sandwich industry I don't think it means absolutely no sandwiches because our industry is very creative and clever at coming up with new recipes but certainly there would be serious problems in terms of some of the fresh ingredients we bring in from the European Union and also from overseas if particularly if we have problems in the ports and we can't get ingredients through because they are all fresh and don't have a very long shelf life and we've got no chance to stop piling fresh ingredients so I think the answer from the sandwich industry is going to be that it's going to limit the amount of choice that consumers have if we suddenly crash out it breaks it in the way that's being talked about you know if I were a member of the British sandwich dissociation I would largely cool against Jim Winship first of all doesn't he look like the perfect boss of the sandwich Association but you did you and he said he said I'm not going to say there won't be absolutely no sandwiches because that might sound a little made-up but there will be and I'm quoting him serious problems for sandwich lovers if brexit goes through because I understand that there were no sandwiches in the United Kingdom especially there were no good sandwiches until the European Union came along you know you know sandwiches are named after the Earl of Sandwich right a Brit but and why am i showing you this silly sandwich clip above the silly sandwich Association saying I won't say there will be absolutely no sandwiches because we're very creative but we're gonna have some serious sandwich problems maybe even a sandwich crisis he didn't say that last part I made that up but you couldn't tell why am i playing that for you why am i laughing so hard at the British sandwich - so see a ssin because imagine a culture a country a media dialogue a narrative a political class an establishment where you seriously have the British sandwiches Oh see a ssin guy on your state broadcaster to whip up sandwich phobia sandwich mania sandwich dislocation syndrome what and and I think most sane people would say crazy but I think enough people would say oh my god the state broadcaster they wouldn't lie to me interviewed the British sandwiches Oh CA ssin they would never lie to me especially about sandwiches and if we are allowed to leave the European Union we will have quote a serious problem with sandwiches what kind of culture is that that's a culture of passivity of bureaucrats of rules and people saying oh well the experts said that's how it is so that's how it is the BBC said that's how it is we just got to live with it that's how it is and that is what I hate most about the United Kingdom in 2018 could you imagine if Jim Winship the big cheese of the British sandwich - so CA ssin we're leading something more important than the sandwich Association imagine if his tremendous executive and leadership skills and his raw charisma not to mention his sexy beard were deployed let's say - defending the United Kingdom against the Nazi Menace in 1940 well we can't fight I mean hair Chancellor Chancellor Hitler hair Hitler has offered us these terms and you know if we don't accept them we're gonna have some serious sandwich problems I mean the passivity and the surrender ISM and that's just how it is folks what are you gonna do the United Kingdom of 2018 is not the United Kingdom that it once was the spirit of free men and women does not burn as brightly today as it once did there's a state broadcaster that dominates the narrative if you speak out of it like Tommy does you're punished thrown in jail what was so incredible to me besides the sandwich Association clown show is that not a single broadcaster not a single presenter with the BBC we're glad that Tommy was freed were appalled by his treatment question putting in journalists in jail for 13 months not at not a single one all of them condemned Tommy anestine a national silent reporters without borders silent what kind of a culture is that a culture of passivity a culture of sheep and lambs that's not healthy you
