hello I'm Andrew Clavin and I'm here in Hollywood and I have a serious face today and when I have a serious face it's very serious because I'm in Hollywood usually I say funny things with a funny face and then we all laugh but today I'm serious and that means you have to take me seriously sometimes I may even have emotions and then it's very serious because my own emotions aren't ordinary emotions they're hollywood emotions and hollywood emotions make me an expert on things when i have hollywood emotions i become an expert on healthcare and gun control and anything else i want to talk about with my emotions and you have to take me seriously because I'm in Hollywood and I have a serious face and emotions now some of you may say wait why do we have to take you seriously just because you have a serious face and emotions shouldn't we calm down and get past our emotions so we can think clearly and make good decisions but I say no and when I say no it's not an ordinary no it's a no from Hollywood so it's important I say if you care now is the time to make decisions while you're emotional because if you calm down then you might think and gather facts and if you think and gather facts you might stop taking me seriously and you have to take me seriously because I'm in Hollywood and I have a serious face there are others among you who probably say well we have a constitution and we should probably follow the law set down in our Constitution what is the Constitution from Hollywood does a constitution have a serious Hollywood face with emotions how can we show we care if we're always obeying the Constitution instead of thinking about my emotions here in Hollywood so today no matter what happens remember three things I have a serious face I have emotions and I'm in Hollywood so what I say is important even though it's complete crap trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show
