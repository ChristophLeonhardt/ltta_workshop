I'm gonna tell your story about anti police bias on a public college campus that hope infuriates you as much as it does me all right the latest bout a snowflake stupidity comes to us courtesy of far left Brooklyn College in New York which is part of the City University of New York education system now that's a taxpayer subsidized public institution meaning the land on which it sits is owned by the city of New York well they don't want cops on the campus they don't want police officers to be able to use the restrooms on the campus that's from New York Post story even worse let me read you a quote from the public safety director of Brooklyn College a guy named Donald winds that I have no use for I'm gonna tell you why this guy man what a piece of work he is he's a disgrace he's the school's Director of Public Safety and he told the student newspaper the Excelsior that he's trying to keep New York's finest out of sight while when said all of the school's restrooms were technically open to cop the college prefers they stick to those in the isolated West End building quote rather than walking across either quad he used the bathroom but why am I so disgusted by the city at Donald Wentz he's a retired NYPD captain this guy must have been a piece of work as a boss he must have really looked after his cops right I mean people like this are everything wrong with law enforcement this is a public institution on public grounds they want cops to use a bathroom that apparently doesn't work is disgusting filthy has no soap and paper towels on an isolated end of the campus instead of using one of the many restrooms that are more convenient to access by walking through the gate now this one hits home for me because I was one of those cops on a foot-post for long hours sometimes you got to break off for 15 seconds after you drank your fifth coffee or your seventh bottle of water and use the restroom quickly but of course the snow flakes are terrified now I got to read you someone with the student body and these are guys these are these are guys a lot of these people in their late teens early 20s the same time I was walking on that foot post at 2:00 in the morning aren't they ashamed where are their dad's to smack them and say man up man up and stop embarrassing yourself and me and the rest of your family this is disgraceful I mean let me read this to you whoa I know oh here so this is a 21 year old god this is a woman there's a female but then again who I don't know it's a liberal University maybe it's a maybe they identified who knows by the way the cops can't use the bathrooms right but any gender Ken let me read this quote from one of the students quote I know students from every background then across every major she said they don't feel comfortable around cops they just don't my favorite it makes safe spaces feel not so safe the police make them feel unsafe in their safe spaces I I'm rarely speechless you watch the show I'm rarely speechless another 20 year-old junior majoring in psychology said it was quote weird seeing cops on campus and added quote your first instinct is to be scared bust a Brooklyn Colleges and exactly in the greatest neighborhood if your first instinct is to be scared by the police and not the perps on one side of that school you're more on you're a moron and you are personifying everything wrong with academia now this is my favorite okay this is my all-time favorite nude body president Nasim Syed lame the sentiments on an NYPD operation that sent an undercover cop to infiltrate the school's Muslim community in search of Islamic terrorists now you gotta understand something about this area of Brooklyn okay it's near the mijita Lanza mosque near the AL Farooq mosque we know and without me giving up too much that I can't give up those were hot beds of terror fundraising activity NYPD the FBI JTTF Joint Terrorism Task Force and other agencies had them under surveillance the intelligence yielded fruit was actionable intelligence that saved lives in fact the same undercover they're talking about ready for this another quote from the article the same female cop helped the feds in 2015 NAB two queens women Noel Belen sus and hacia Siddiqui who were awaiting who are awaiting trials on charges they stockpile tanks of propane gas or as who you know who Isis for an Isis inspired attack on the Big Apple on New York City well let's think about this for a second the student body the snowflake student body that's afraid of police in their safe spaces doesn't want police on campus because a female undercover acting on very good intelligence went into the school's Muslim community after successfully uncovering and having arrested two women who were plotting plotting an attack on New York City for Isis these morons aren't afraid of the potential terrorists on campus they're not afraid of the drug dealers on campus the potential rapists coming onto campus the armed robbers coming onto campus know they're afraid of the police because the police but they're afraid I gotta say it again they're afraid of the police because the police successfully stopped a terror attack and after that investigation information gleaned off the investigation directed the police to infiltrate the Brooklyn College Muslim community and these snowflakes are afraid of the cops not the terrorists this one has me so fired up this is insanity and the director of Public Safety a retired NYPD captain is playing in an enabling this nonsense where does it end where does it end now he back pedals a little bit it's useless do nothing captain retired well when stole the New York Post that we quote prefer rather that that quote we prefer we prefer were the keywords regarding where cops should use the colleges bathrooms adding quote if police are seen walking across the quad some may interpret that as an emergency going on well if you're in college if you're an adult in higher education and you can't interpret two police officers maybe joking around as they walk to a restroom as just that a stroll rather than them running yelling into their radios if you're too dumb you understand the difference in body language and response between somebody walking to a restroom or wherever in an emergency situation then you're probably too dumb to be in college all right and a college spokesperson said this is the one I love quote Brooklyn College offers the use of our facilities to the NYPD and other public servants dot dot dot as a courtesy although they don't it's public land it's a public building and what the New York City Police Department should do is arrest any moron snowflake who tries to block their access to the restrooms for disorderly conduct including the moron Public Safety Director NYPD captain retired whence this has got to end this has got to end when we are at a place where college students are more afraid of pulling they're not afraid of the cops is social justice nonsense sound bites so that you can be the coolest most liberal idiot on campus but when they're actually willing to go on the record and say that they're more afraid of the police and potential terrorists within their student body we are about to fall off a very steep Kliff we've got to turn this around and academia is gonna be the first first battleground gonna be the first battleground and then we've got to just put better people in the office but this one has me really fired up stay on top of this story I'm gonna this is just mind-blowing if this content fires you up as much as it fires me up
