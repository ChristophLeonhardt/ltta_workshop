a review into the information passed on to the Home Office regarding the Rotherham rape scandal has found that the home office did know about the pimping and grooming of children potentially 12 years before the Jay report was ordered a new review into the rather and rape scandal has been underway and the reports just been released I've been taking a look at it you can see it yourself online and I've been reading through it today to see what exactly they found and as I just mentioned one thing they did find is that actually the Home Office knew about this scandal potentially 12 years before the Jay report was even ordered well what is the Jay report if you don't know about this already you've at least probably heard about the robber and scandal the robber and 1400 but the Jay report was an investigation that was commissioned by the rather and council to look into that issue and it saw professor alexis Jay reviewing the extent of child sexual exploitation CSE as well as the handling of reports that go back to 1997 that report was commissioned all that that review was commissioned in October 2013 it was completed and published on the 26th of August 2014 and when it came out it discovered that up to 40 sorryi minimum actually of 1,400 young girls they specifically said it was a conservative estimate could have been exploited between 1997 and 2013 it was one of the biggest scandals of our time but what does this new report say well essentially it's a review of reviews the paper explains that on the 2nd of September 2014 the home office secretary indicated that Peter Wong las' and Richard Whitham QC would look at the process employed by the Home Office to review information passed to the Home Office in connection with allegations of child sexual abuse in Rotherham from 1998 to 2005 so specifically this review looked at the information that was passed to the Home Office regarding child sexual exploitation in rather absurd it's a review of the methodology of the Home Office in determining the problem and a review of the review that took place and it asked multiple questions and a few of the questions are what information about CS am rather immed the home office receive as a result of the crime reduction program what action was taken in response to any relevant information received and what were the general circumstances of the home offices engagement with the rather and research project so it's all fairly the stuff that's designed to keep a government department in check and it's all very fair enough and the document provided lots of recommendations for instance it recommended that their search terms when looking through documents were narrowed down a little bit because too much information was gathered that wasn't relevant yada yada yada following stuff like that but there's some really interesting stuff in here for instance in section 4.3 it says as the reviewer recognized no comprehensive attempt to identify records outside the period of relevance to the rather and research project was made in the course of conducting searches for the review some information concerning child sexual abuse in Rotherham more generally was identified and where it was considered by the reviewer to be of interest it is being referred to in the internal review the document also revealed that there were significant disputes between different agencies within Rotherham regarding the research project but reading on the document discusses an unpublished report from 2002 and this is where it gets really interesting it says the Jay report provided a detailed and wide-ranging consideration of the adequacy of the response of statutory bodies to child sexual exploitation in Rotherham this has included an assessment of the work of risky business an innovative child focused project which from 2001 to 2002 participated in a rather and based research project focused on targeting men who are believed to be responsible for pimping and grooming young people into prostitution the document goes on to say that this project was funded by the Home Office under its crime reduction program meaning that the Home Office knew about CSE going on in rather in 12 years before the Jay report even was commissioned and even then this 2001 2002 project criticized the way that CSE was being dealt with the former researcher even gave evidence to the Jay review in which she described an unwillingness within South Yorkshire police to investigate those perpetrating sexual abuse against young people and protect potential victims as well as her frustration the efforts to raise concerns with senior personnel were met with defensiveness and hostility so the problem of CSE in Rotherham and the problem with the authorities not taking it seriously enough has been on the radar of the Home Office for potentially 12 years before the Jay report was even commissioned the Home Office has been going round in circles examining instances of child sexual exploitation missing instances of exploitation and closing down projects before their research has even been concluded and a new review of investigations into CSE in Rotherham has found that the Home Office received reports that went unpublished showing pimping and grooming of young children in South Yorkshire and Rotherham and the independent review has found that ministers failed to act on evidence putting children at risk and the Rotherham MP Sarah champion who succeeded the disgraced Dennis McShane who said he didn't want to rock the multicultural boat while this child exploitation was going on is now speaking openly about child abuse and she's telling the press why when so many in authority knew the scale and severity of this crime did it take until 2014 with the publication of the Jay report for a large-scale investigation to occur how many lives could have been protected if swift action had been taken a decade before while Sarah champion I quite agree with you but your words just aren't good enough on this it's disgusting that after the industrial scale of rape of children in Rotherham under a Labour MP and labour councils that you a Labour MP were chosen to replace the disgusting and the disgraced Dennis McShane the Labour Party has been systematically complicit in this crime all over the country refusing to admit that there's a problem with grooming gangs from a particular section of society and you know what I'm talking about Sarah champion your words don't comfort me on this if you want to do something if so a champion wants to do something she can resign the Labour whip and speak even more openly about the real source of this problem the real ideological and religious source I encourage you all by the way to read this new report about Rotherham in full it's enlightening it shows systemic failures from our authorities and our ministers and if this happened in Rotherham and if this was covered up had such a huge scale you can bet that this is still happening all over the UK if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and download the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the
