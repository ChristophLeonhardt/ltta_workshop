1
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:13,312
>>> FORMER NAVY S.E.A.L. DAN

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,513
CRENSHAW SERVED OUR COUNTRY FOR

3
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,415
TEEN YEARS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE

4
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:18,717
TOURS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,

5
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:20,186
LOSING HIS RIGHT EYE DURING HIS

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,187
THIRD DEPLOYMENT.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,922
HE'S NOT DONE SERVING.

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,224
NOW HE'S RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN

9
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,293
TEXAS AND JUST DEFEATED THE

10
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,563
STATE REPRESENTATIVE FB

11
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,497
STATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE

12
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:33,632
REPUBLICAN SPOT.

13
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:36,101
A NEW OP-ED, VOTE VETERAN TO GET

14
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:36,769
THE JOB DONE.

15
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:39,805
THIS IS PART OF A NEW IMPORTANT

16
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:40,973
TREND?

17
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:43,943
LET'S ASK DAN CRENSHAW.

18
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,878
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:46,378
YOUR WIN.

20
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:47,046
>> THANK YOU.

21
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,081
>> YOU GOT TO THAT RUNOFF

22
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:52,218
BECAUSE YOU WERE A DISTANT

23
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,118
SECOND BEFORE THAT.

24
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:55,588
MORE MONEY WAS SPENT BY OTHER

25
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,722
CANDIDATES FROM OUTSIDE GROUPS

26
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,090
FOR OTHER CANDIDATES.

27
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,024
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE

28
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,359
RACE THAT YOU RAN THAT LED TO

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,098
THAT VOTE WHICH IS 70/30 IS NOT

30
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:09,201
A SMALL MARGIN OF VICTORY.

31
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:11,203
>> OUR CAMPAIGN CAUGHT FIRE

32
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,905
BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO INSPIRE

33
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:13,239
OTHERS.

34
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,608
I LIKE TO USE REAGAN'S QUOTE,

35
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,277
THE GREATEST LEADERS ARE NOT THE

36
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,645
ONE WHO DOES THE GREATEST

37
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:20,813
THINGS, THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

38
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,181
GET THE PEOPLE TO DO THE

39
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:22,948
GREATEST THINGS.

40
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,116
THEY REALLY DROVE OUR CAMPAIGN

41
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,184
TO THE FINISH LINE.

42
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,152
IT WAS AN AMAZING THING TO SEE.

43
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:29,088
AN AMAZING THING TO SEE SO MANY

44
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,889
PEOPLE GET INSPIRED.

45
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,891
THAT COMES FROM BEING AUTHENTIC,

46
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,726
RUNNING AN HONEST CAMPAIGN.

47
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,960
DON'T NECESSARILY TELL THE VOTER

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,129
WHAT IS THEY WANT TO HEAR BUT BE

49
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,297
CLEAR WITH THEM, HONEST WITH

50
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:38,631
THEM.

51
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,933
>> AND YOU SAY OUR COUNTRY NEEDS

52
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,102
LEADERS NOT POLITICIANS.

53
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,236
WHAT DID YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT

54
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:46,238
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR THAT

55
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,573
STILL DREW THEM TOWARD YOUR

56
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:47,940
CAMPAIGN?

57
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,142
>> WE TALK ABOUT HARD ISSUES, WE

58
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:52,578
TALKED ABOUT ENTITLEMENT REFORM,

59
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:55,281
THE REAL WORLD OUT THERE, THE

60
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:59,418
REAL REASON WE HAVE TROOPS

61
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:01,153
OVERSEAS AND WHY THAT MATTERS.

62
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:03,923
THESE AREN'T YOUR TYPICAL

63
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,990
POLITICAL TALKING POINTS BUT

64
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,592
VOTER CONSIST

65
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:06,692
VOTER CANSIST

66
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:06,725
VOTER CAN TST

67
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,126
VOTER CAN TAKE IT.

68
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,828
>> THE VOTER IS SMART AS OPPOSED

69
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:10,996
TO BEING DONE AND BEING TOLD

70
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:13,365
WHAT TO DO OR THEY'LL ABIND

71
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:15,668
WHAT TO DO OR THEY'LL ABIDE BY A

72
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,703
CAMPAIGN AD BA US THEY SAW IT,

73
00:02:17,703 --> 00:02:19,939
YOU WERE ABLE TO KUBT

74
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:19,972
YOU WERE ABLE TO CUBT

75
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:20,272
YOU WERE ABLE TO CUTT

76
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:20,639
YOU WERE ABLE TO CUT THROUGH

77
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,408
THAT PUTTING THE FLAG FIRST.

78
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,075
>> ABSOLUTELY.

79
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,510
A LOT OF HARD WORK.

80
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,245
VETERAN CANDIDATES ARE

81
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,847
DISCIPLINED, WE'RE FAST LEARNERS

82
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:33,052
AND WE CAN ADAPT TO FACTS ON THE

83
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:33,719
GROUND.

84
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,220
STAYING MISSION FOCUS IS

85
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,555
IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A

86
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:37,856
CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS, HUNDREDS OF

87
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,058
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OR MILLIONS

88
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,725
OF DOLLARS IN THIS CASE.

89
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,061
>> DID YOU THINK YOU COULD WIN?

90
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,529
>> WE ALWAYS THOUGHT WE WOULD

91
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:43,796
WIN.

92
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,431
I TELL YOU WHAT, WE ALWAYS GOT

93
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,099
TOLD RIGHT AWAY, THANK YOU FOR

94
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,501
YOUR SERVICE, WHEN THIS DOESN'T

95
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,103
WORK OUT WE HOPE YOU STICK WITH

96
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:51,470
IT.

97
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,440
AND MY WIFE AND I SAW THAT, NO.

98
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,808
HOW ABOUT WE JUST WIN.

99
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,109
WHY WOULD WE PUT OURSELVES

100
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,745
THROUGH THIS IF WE DIDN'T INTEND

101
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:01,680
TO WIN AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID.

102
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,049
WE'RE PROUD OF THE WAY WE RAN

103
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:04,984
THE CAMPAIGN.

104
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,118
IT'S NOT OVER.

105
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,087
WE STILL NEED HELP GOING INTO

106
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:08,454
NOVEMBER.

107
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,991
>> SPHIEMS THE

108
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,024

>> SOMETIMESHE

112
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:13,826
>> SOMETIMES THE POLITICAL CLASS

113
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,195
CAN BE PATRONIZING.

114
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,731
YOU BLEW RIGHT THROUGH THAT.

115
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,598
PART OF THAT IS UNDERSTANDING

116
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,332
WHAT SERVICE MEANS.

117
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,301
THIS IS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.

118
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,902
WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO GAVE

119
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,303
EVERYTHING.

120
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,938
AS A VET WHO SPENT SO MANY TOURS

121
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,606
ON THE BATTLEFIELD, TALK TO ME

122
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,541
ABOUT WHAT MEMORIAL DAY MEANS TO

123
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:29,808
YOU.

124
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,210
>> I'M GLAD YOU ASKED.

125
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,878
MEMORIAL DAY -- I MEAN IT IS

126
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,146
ABOUT CELEBRATION.

127
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:35,848
ACROSS AMERICA RIGHT NOW IT'S

128
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,351
FESTIVE, WE'RE BARBECUING,

129
00:03:39,351 --> 00:03:40,519
FIREWORKS, WE'RE HANGING OUT

130
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:41,487
WITH OUR FAMILY.

131
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,955
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

132
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:43,956
MEMORIAL DAY TO A DIFFERENT

133
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,324
CLASS OF PEOPLE MEANS A

134
00:03:45,324 --> 00:03:45,991
DIFFERENT THING.

135
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,693
AND THAT'S THE WARRIOR CLASS.

136
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,927
THAT'S THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO

137
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,296
HAVE BEEN OVERSEAS IN COMBAT AND

138
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:52,931
IT'S THEIR FAMILIES WHO HOLD

139
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:53,866
DOWN THE HOME FRONT.

140
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,801
TO THEM, HERE'S WHAT THEY ASK.

141
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,469
THEY ASK THAT YOU DO NOT FORGET

142
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:57,970
TO REMEMBER.

143
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,671
AND THAT IS SO IMPORTANT.

144
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,774
AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING WE

145
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,876
SHOULD BE ASKING OF PEOPLE.

146
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,577
REMEMBER WHY THESE MEN AND WOMEN

147
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,845
FELL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

148
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,747
AND THEY FELL SO THAT WE COULD

149
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:09,048
LIVE.

150
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,249
SO THAT WE COULD CONTINUE

151
00:04:10,249 --> 00:00:00,000
SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND SERVE
