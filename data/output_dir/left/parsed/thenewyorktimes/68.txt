Can you hear this noise?
Of course you can.
It’s well within the hearing
frequency range of humans.
What about this?
Probably not,
unless you’re furry
and bark when your human
won’t take you out.
And what if you paddle with
two webbed feet and quack?
What do ducks hear underwater?
That, as it happens, was one
of science’s unanswered —
actually, unasked —
questions until now.
Scientists from the
University of Delaware
have changed that by creating
an underwater hearing test
for ducks.
First, ducklings learn to
peck a target like this pipe.
Then they hear a sound
and receive a treat.
After months of work to learn
the complicated sequence
of the real test,
a few of the ducks
graduate to the big pool.
Here’s how it goes:
An LED light tells
the duck to dive.
We can’t see it.
The duck pecks a target —
the pipe.
If it hears the second
sound underwater —
Then it rises to peck
the second target
and get a treat.
By changing the frequency
of the second sound,
researchers learn the
range of duck hearing.
Researchers did dozens
of experiments —
some with one duck,
some with more,
and tried various frequencies.
Here’s one of the
researchers, Kate McGrew,
monitoring the ducks and
controlling the beeps.
Some ducks didn’t
make the cut.
So why does it matter
what ducks hear?
Diving ducks, also
called sea ducks,
are getting caught and killed
in commercial fishing nets —
probably many
thousands of them,
although the numbers
are hard to pin down.
Devices that send out
sounds or pings
have been used to warn
dolphins away from nets.
So, they might
work with ducks.
The trick is, the sounds
have to be inaudible to fish
and audible to ducks.
Early indications
from the study
are that the prime range
for duck hearing underwater
is between 1 and 3 kilohertz.
That’s good to
know, but it does
present some practical
problems because fish hear up
to 2 kilohertz,
and you don’t want
to scare them away.
But it’s a great first step
in understanding duck hearing.
