1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
“The motion is adopted.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,585
Without objection, the motion 
to reconsider is laid on the table.”

3
00:00:04,465 --> 00:00:05,465
Here we are again.

4
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:06,930
Partisan political bickering

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,140
has led to another
government shutdown.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,530
But what does that mean?

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,420
The federal fiscal year
starts on Oct. 1,

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,070
often without new
spending laws in place.

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,160
Instead, the
president and Congress

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,380
strike a short-term deal
to buy more time.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,150
If they can’t reach
a new agreement

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,440
before the next deadline,

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,350
much of the 
federal government shuts down.

14
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,176
Since October, 
there have already been

15
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:32,986
three short-term agreements.

16
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:37,170
When the government shuts down,
federal workers are either

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,680
forced off the job
or told to work without pay.

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,030
Essential services,
such as airport security

19
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,640
and food inspections, 
stay in place.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
The military remains active

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,690
but may not be paid on time,

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,950
depending on how long 
the shutdown drags on.

23
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,430
And national parks and
monuments will remain open,

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,830
at least this time.

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,910
In the event of a
shutdown,

26
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,790
the I.R.S. will likely
be forced to slow

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,709
implementation of 
the new tax bill.

28
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:06,960
Funding for Puerto Rico,

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,980
still rebuilding from Hurricane Maria,

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,070
also hangs in the balance.

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,880
The future will remain
unclear for DACA recipients.

32
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,490
And without an extension, 
the Children’s Health Insurance Program

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:00:00,000
will run out of money.
