to your presidency that I think we're finding the most difficult is that no matter what you do it always comes with an extra layer of gleeful cruelty and business it's it's not just that you don't want people taking Annie it's that they're sons of bitches if they do it's not just denying women who accuse you of sexual assault it's saying they were too ugly anyway but Donald Trump wants is for us to stop calling his cruelty and fear and divisive nasaw but to join him in calling it right and this we cannot do and I say by not yielding so even I spoke to me the executive today about about just what I think I just saw John Stewart do he is speaking to the 60-plus percent who know that the Trump presidency has us on a very very very unstable foundation not just for the policy indictments that he laid out they're criticizing NFL players who protest denying the women who accused him but but for that extra step he always takes to layer on cruelty in a word I can't say I'm family-friendly TV at 4:00 p.m. that is the Trump presidency in a nutshell that's right it's it's an effort to erode the concept of virtue to to create a scenario in which there is no virtue because if there is no virtue there's no there's neither right nor wrong it's all just the pursuit of power whoever has the most power to achieve their ends it wins and therefore is right and and therefore there is no right or wrong that's what he wants because in the scenario such as that he's no longer accountable he can get away with the corruption he is engaged in now and has been for some time and he can't be held accountable we can't hold our leaders accountable in those scenarios so there are one thing we banned at this table is talk of just how powerful and unshakable the base is Donald Trump didn't think his base was powerful or unshakable enough to get him elected he did not write a victory speech so that the idea that we've now accepted and march in lockstep with the notion that his base is so big and they'll never go anywhere is baloney and this idea of Jon Stewart sort of speaking to the 60% of the country you don't approve of this president and and maybe some who voted for him for the Supreme Court picks but no it's all wrong it's something that that I think represents sort of the beginning of the the turning of a notion I think you're right and I also think that they have to be concerned about how they've normalized this kind of cruelty in this kind of behavior you know the argument just a year and a half ago was end of respectable politics now we're talking about civility he has redefined both I mean what is respectable in an age of Trump what is simple in an age of Trump and I think that a lot of people that went along with him for whatever reasons the Supreme Court or other things are gonna have to really face the fact that they have helped to normalize some of the most decadent kind of values that we've seen in American I'm sorry there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
