00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
hi guys how's it going what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so for</font>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,250
our allies we meet lots of different

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,280
people whether it's friends family or

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,230
strangers and out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these people</font>

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are always those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stand out</font>

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually it's for unintentional</font>

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,859
reasons characteristics that they have

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,779
that I guess could be considered quirky

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,270
so in this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I challenge you to post</font>

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,210
three examples of three people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,670
you've come across who have interesting

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,340
traits<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here are my three roll</font>

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,809
sequence<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is sawing</font>

14
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,719
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked with in construction he</font>

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,030
doesn't work in the same field that I do

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,520
but whenever I see him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about he's never</font>

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing work and he's always chewing on</font>

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,660
chewing gum I'll be there doing work

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,520
maybe of a hammer demolish and slang

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,350
using a drill which is pretty loud and

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,309
in the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind I just hear this</font>

22
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:01,340
and I turnover and who's behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,500
and its really really off-putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,050
my second example is of a guy that I saw

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,940
on a train<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my way</font>

26
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to London to the BBC Television Centre</font>

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
last week and as usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was no</font>

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,930
space on the train<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I was standing</font>

29
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,140
up in the cafe bit there's a bar on this

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,790
carriage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the train where they sell</font>

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,960
stuff and there was this guy just

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,240
sitting there reading a newspaper having

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,920
a coffee and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then all sudden he sneezed</font>

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,860
without his hand there everyone was like

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,180
he sneezed he sneezed did he have swine

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,130
flu but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't the interesting part</font>

37
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,900
and don't ask why I started watching him

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,980
he then got a tissue and then as he

39
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">started like wiping his nose he then</font>

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,320
started sticking out his tongue and then

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,060
he started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kress the tissue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

42
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,700
slowly make a move with his tongue<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,890
he had this nice romantic experience

44
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,640
with this tissue and it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">weird no one else on the carriage</font>

46
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,050
noticed so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I feel special for</font>

47
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,570
experiencing such a weird behavior from

48
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,709
such a freak of nature

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,120
and my third example it was so on I went

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,830
to secondary school with and because I

51
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,240
can't give out the names I'm gonna just

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,690
call this guy one in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe and why would</font>

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,790
I call him<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may</font>

54
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,830
have guessed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep you're pretty smart</font>

55
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,640
he had one air he had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip-on ear that</font>

56
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,850
was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> made for him and it just</font>

57
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,310
clipped on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else with a clip clip</font>

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is new so we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been registration</font>

59
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,600
at school and he wasn't usually there

60
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,890
and we'd always get in trouble if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

61
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,180
didn't turn up and that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

62
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">like well where is he and everyone would</font>

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,090
say he is not here which<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok pun aside</font>

64
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,800
anyway he would then run him through the

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
door and he would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say something like</font>

66
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,690
I'll sorry miss I miss Huck I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't</font>

67
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,820
find my ear I lost it a teacher<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

68
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,830
though it's an excuse used over and over

69
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,780
again could<font color="#E5E5E5"> had questioned it just had</font>

70
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,430
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go okay well as long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you found</font>

71
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">your ear I mean how do you respond to</font>

72
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,630
that and it got worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever he didn't</font>

73
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,880
hand in homework what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> his excuse I</font>

74
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,430
lost my ear so the whole last night the

75
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,870
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my homework was</font>

76
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,850
because i lost my ear but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found it</font>

77
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">though there was another example where</font>

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,830
at lunch there was this girl sitting

79
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,870
down she<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a sandwich on the table he</font>

80
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,430
was sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> next to her and he literally</font>

81
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,260
just unclipped his ear put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

82
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,790
table next to her which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> illustrated</font>

83
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very well by a piece of</font>

84
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,860
ham it was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing I could find</font>

85
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,660
and I know it doesn't look much<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck in</font>

86
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and then as she sort</font>

87
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,980
of looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the air he then just</font>

88
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,230
started pushing it towards the sandwich

89
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,120
and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end she had to leave and</font>

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,060
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> another occasion where he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

91
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,910
punched me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I went Wow why'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

92
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,010
that and he went<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you've got one</font>

93
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,040
more air than I do it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay guys those</font>

94
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
were my three examples of interesting

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,150
people that I've experienced in my life
