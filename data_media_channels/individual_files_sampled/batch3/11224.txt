Donald Trump has completed his European trip which began with a NATO summit and ended with a historic meeting with Vladimir Putin positive steps and real progress those are the words both leaders used to describe the talks something that caused outrage in the media back home I I don't know which side is the bride and which side of is the groom Anderson but it sort of feels like we're at a wedding you have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president why is President Trump putting himself in his vulnerable high-stake scenario and letting Vladimir Putin lead politicians joined the media in denouncing Trump after the u.s. leader vouch for Putin when the topic of election meddling came up during their press conference President Putin did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular President Putin denied having anything to do with the election air Ference in 2016 every US intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did who do you believe I have great confidence in my intelligence people but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people I think that's an incredible offer I was an intelligence officer myself and I do know how dossiers are compiled what conclusions can only be made by a court and not by an intelligence service when that didn't happen q outrage Donald Trump should be arrested for treason the moment he sets foot on American soil look traits in treason a very serious words I have avoided them for nearly two years but today's Trump Putin summit cannot be sugar-coated with milder terms this was the day an American president stood on foreign soil next to a murderous lying thug and refused to back his own country patriots need to stand up and reject the behavior of this president I never thought I would see the day when our American president would stand on the stage with the Russian president and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression this is shameful John Brennan former CIA boss and now media darling even went as far as to brand Trump's appearance treason Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki Rises ternt exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors it was nothing short of treasonous not only were Trump's comments imbecilic his hole in the pocket of Putin Republican Patriots why are you not only does the Department of Justice failed to provide any conclusive evidence linking the Kremlin to the alleged crime it actually admits that the supposed conspiracy did not affect the vote count or the election so a confrontation with Putin over meddling was clearly the desired result following an onslaught of attacks after the media conference Trump decided to defend himself in the usual way on Twitter he stressed that he has great confidence in US intelligence which has repeatedly stated Russia meddled in the u.s. election but Trump also said he can't focus on the past as the two nuclear powers must get along earlier we spoke to former US congressman Ron Paul who believes the current drama is based on the old US media habit of making Russia out to be the enemy so you also mentioned so far in this program about the American media and that is a big problem because for some reason they're almost unanimously endorsing the idea that we have to have an enemy and at this point especially for the last 20 years they've been working very hard to make Russia the enemy and I think this is this is wrong and it's not the Democrats alone that do this it's the Democrats and along with some disgruntled Republicans who just they just don't like Trump but no I was very pleased with what went on and it's a step in the right direction they I think the biggest thing that if it ever had a serious discussion I guess it would come out on how much we've been involved when we shouldn't be involved for instance in Ukraine and how that occurred but if they don't have want to concentrate on those problem they want to look forward I think that is great but I would like to I think the next best state this step ever would be for us to reassess this and say that Trump's going in the right direction and talk them into getting rid of the sanctions on Russia you
