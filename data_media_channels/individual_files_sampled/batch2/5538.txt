fair to say the three most serious contenders in this race have been narrowed down by the president tell us more about who they are what we know well what's interesting Peter based on your reporting is that these three really represent three different options when you think of what the president's being presented with so you have Brett Kavanaugh he's sort of the establishment choice highly credentialed Bush administration official Yale undergrad and law school I believe and then you have Amy Kony Barrett she of course is almost the religious conservative pick she had a great deal of success in her Senate confirmation she's Catholic she of mother of seven children from her you get the sense that the religious right is really rallying around her as well and then you have Raymond Catholic he is from Michigan more of a geographic choice but we know these three really represent different paths to the court they're all serving in some capacity and federal district or federal appellate court right now and the decision that president's gonna have to make may come down to feel at the same time Peter there's a lot of back-and-forth here in Washington it seems as though Brett Kavanaugh the establishment choice does have some enemies and about some enemies some adversaries in the United States Senate Ted Cruz reportedly not had with them also Rand Paul so some conservative senators are trying to influence the president suggesting that maybe Brett Kavanaugh isn't as conservative as some of his supporters might suggest Peter garety fair to say after the fireworks outside the White House last night the real political pyrotechnics are about to heat up Hans Nichols on the North Lawn press Hans we'll see you there shortly hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
