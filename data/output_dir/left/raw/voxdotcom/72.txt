1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,940
If I asked you to imagine a soccer ball, what
would it look like?

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,880
This is starting to look a little bit like Mr. Potato Head.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,340
This is like asking a bro to draw his favorite drag queens.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm kinda guessing at this point.

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,660
The most iconic ball, the one with black and
white panels stitched together?

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,000
It’s known as the Telstar.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,460
And it got its start because of broadcast television.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,880
The 1966 World Cup was a turning point in
soccer history.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,810
The games that year were held in England,
home to the BBC which, aside from the US,

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,500
had the biggest television operation at the
time.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,730
The television broadcast became a huge part
of the World Cup.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,620
And, as The Times reported, four hundred million
fans were watching across five continents.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,860
But notice the ball.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,480
If you’re having a hard time following it,
it’s not just you.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,509
The ball used in the 1966 World Cup was reddish-brown.

16
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,710
And its solid color made it hard to spot on
TV.

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,970
Like the soccer balls that came before it,
this one was made of rectangular strips.

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,260
It actually looked more like a modern volleyball.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
But by the 1970 World Cup, the soccer ball
had changed.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,040
Compared to the ball used four years prior,
the black and white checkered design made

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,600
the ball stand out and made it easier to follow
for viewers at home.

22
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,040
And that was especially true on black and
white TV sets, which most people had at the time.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,460
Players on the field had reason to celebrate
too.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,570
The 32 panels of the Telstar brought it closer
to an actual sphere, giving the ball a more

25
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,960
predictable path through the air and on the
ground.

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,560
A version of the black and white Telstar design
stuck around for over two decades before being

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,340
replaced with other models.

28
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,830
But by then the Telstar had become the archetype
of soccer balls, synonymous with the sport.

29
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,950
And if you catch the World Cup this year,
you might recognize a familiar pattern.

30
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,080
The ball being used in Russia is called the
Telstar 18, a nod back to the iconic Telstar.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,279
It uses just six propellor-shaped pieces,
making the ball even more spherical.

32
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:23,969
But that black and white design is back — and,
almost five decades later it’s still what

33
00:02:23,969 --> 00:00:00,000
people think of when they think of soccer.
