right now President Trump is on Capitol Hill and he's huddling privately with House Republicans now some of them have been publicly critical they may unload even more so in this private meeting one of the real tragedies of illegal immigration that kids are often the greatest victims we can stop this a zero tolerance policy can be changed by the local white house could change it in five minutes and they should first I can do it too and I think it has to be fixed meanwhile Donald Trump saying this when he arrived on the hill this was moments ago we're learning that it is now up to 13 members of the Senate Republican caucus formally asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to stop it - stop cetera separating these families at the border until at least they can figure out an alternative no today the top Republican in Congress Mitch McConnell at least claims on the record that he is against separating families for any future legislation now remember before I show you this Republicans control the Senate in the house right now they could pass a bill tonight actually doing what Mitch McConnell's talking about actually stopping this if they want it I support and all of the members of Republican Conference support a plan that keeps families together while their immigration status is determined what we would do is move these families to the head of the line in the interim they would be in a humane safe and secure family facility and hopefully we'll get this problem addressed right away so that is what this all sounds like in the capitol where politicians talk meanwhile out in the country is we're going to show you tonight Donald Trump's orders are being enforced children split from their parents in some cases put in cages and they are crying and we're starting to hear the leaks the audio little slices of what is apparently a nationwide epidemic children crying a they struggle to make sense of what's being done to them that is what these orders sound like when enforced this is one picture of what it looks like now if you follow politics and you watch the news you're probably familiar with a basic pretty iron rule of American politics that's don't compare things to Nazi Germany because nothing is like Nazi Germany but I can show you something else happening right now on Fox News of all places that is the comparison that immigration hardliner Laura Ingraham pressed on Attorney General Sessions and he sort of accepted the framework because he responds by contrasting this zero-tolerance policy against inbound immigrants and children to Germany's treatment of what he views as outbound migrants Nazi Germany concentration camps human rights violations Laura Bush's weighed in Michelle Obama Rosalynn cardigan all the first lady's gone back to Eleanor Roosevelt she's apparently weighed in as well General Sessions what the what's going on here well it's a real exaggeration of course in Nazi Germany they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country now against this backdrop today Donald Trump is doubling down in this speech on his child separation policy he's also literally wrapping himself take a look giving a big hug to an American flag you can watch it twice it it looks the same way both times if you have a sense that things are starting to come off the rails in America right now that things are getting worse we can report for you tonight there is a lot of evidence to that end let's speak plainly your federal government openly admits it's using innocent children as a pawn in an international effort at what they call deterrence your government creating camps to detain these children and the president the United States is lying about his own policy in a way that is brazenly sloppy even by his own standard the kind of lies that actually gesture at one of the more significant questions an executive can ask the rest of the nation in a constitutional democracy what are you gonna do about it I'm joined now by California congresswoman Judy Chu she met yesterday with some of the children separated from their parents at facilities in California and Rico maroney's a founder and director of border angels and the Chicago Tribune's Clarence page congresswoman starting with the facts what did you see on your tour yesterday 14 Congress members including myself and Leader Nancy Pelosi went down to the border in San Diego to go to one of these shelters that is housing these children we saw 62 children ages 6 to 17 who were either unaccompanied minors or were separated from their parents and it was just overwhelming to see these really young kids as young as six being they're by themselves traumatized by the situation we were able to talk to the mental health counselors who told us what these children's are saying in private that they feel loss they feel abandoned they don't do not know where to turn next and they are scared for their lives and this is not the America that we know is this a consequence of what this Congress that you're a member of has passed or a consequence of Donald Trump zero tolerance orders this is solely the responsibility a president Donald Trump Donald Trump issued the zero-tolerance policy this is what is causing these young people to be separated now over 2,000 of them that have been separated from their parents and Donald Trump has the ability to reverse this he could call Jeff Sessions right now and tell him to stop this to stop this separation of children from their parents so yes it is squarely at the feet of President Trump and wreak a many things are polarized in a mayor right now this is an issue that as the light has shown and the facts have emerged the attempt to politically polarized it has become I think more difficult we showed in our intro some Republicans claiming they're against it although they're not acting on that in the Congress tonight take a listen to some of the coverage on the right since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border more kids are being separated from their parents and temporarily housed and what are essentially summer camp camps some have referred to them as cages but it keep in mind this is a great big warehouse facility where they built walls out of chain-link fences they're saying these child actors weeping and crying on all the other networks 24/7 right now do not fall for it mr. president these kids are being so sorry we have to go given scripts to read by liberals your response enrique i'm just outraged i have been to these facilities we've been working on the front lines with the people that cross the border or are on either side of the border for more than 30 years with the border angels and a society is judged on how we treat our children and what is taking place right now is horrific donald trump without a doubt is pure evil no other country in the Americas has walls no other country in the world separates children from their parents and to call them child actors or to have Laura Ingraham laughing or Jeff Sessions quoting the Bible same quotes that we use to justify slavery it's outrageous is unacceptable people are dying right now because of the law that already exists 11,000 people have died because of the 700 mile wall that already exists we've been putting water out there for more than 20 years I have dealt with these children in 2014 we took in more than a hundred children that were fleeing violence much of it caused by US policies in Central America these people have no legal way of entering their country they're desperate and most undocumented people in the world do not come to the United States there's 250 million around the world the US has 11 million but the u.s. is a country that for a long long time people looked up to no longer Donald Trump is doing is pure evil and Jeff Sessions and pants are right side by side as are the Republicans Donald Trump signed an executive order and changes this policy it's inhumane and I many people were crying right now when you played the tapes of opus heard a couple of days ago in the Senators it's horrific how can people do that that that hasn't happened in this country since the time of slavery it hasn't happened in the worlds at the time of the Nazis and Donald Trump is right there with them so I'm ashamed it's an embarrassment it's terrific and we need to be outraged and pay attention we need to make a change Donald Trump represents the worst of the American spirit and Clarence the white houses we've reported you know strenuously denies aspects of this they certainly object to the some of the historical comparisons I should mention we've invited mr. Miller and others on this show offered them ample time they're not taking us up on that at this moment but Clarence your view of all of this well that's what's striking to me Ari if you're going to have a policy like this on it president Trump ran for office on this immigration issue he was distorting it from the day he announced his campaign and now that this policy has been implemented and the administration was getting some blowback he wants to say well it's all Congress's fault it's they're the ones who created the law and blah blah blah which is not true i he changed the policy I three of general jeff sessions announced it and the Department Homeland Security has implemented it business comes right out of the Trump administration and now other Republicans are upset in Congress those who are getting blowback from their home districts or senators from their home states but at the same time they put themselves into this situation because they've stuck with Donald Trump because of some things on his agenda I share our shared interests that they have that they want to see passed but now it's like they're holding these children hostage in all areas you know Donald Trump's wall you're hitting let me ask you about that class you're hitting that point you use the word hostage and this is such a key point because there are always federal policies that have what is sometimes you know artfully referred to as collateral damaged alright don't usually see to urine and reek aids point and I would think the congresswoman was alluding this as well we don't usually see the claimant that the collateral damage especially to children is itself a goal a quote unquote deterrent take a listen to the administration struggling with that very issue our department of homeland security personnel going to separate the children from their moms and dad yes I am considering an audit to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous Network I am considering exactly that I find that offensive no because why would I ever create a policy that purposely does that hopefully people will get the message and come through the border at the port of entry and not break break across the block unlawfully is that policy meant to be a deterrent or not Howie I don't think it's so much meant to be at a turn is it's really just trying to enforce a law clearance this goes to the moral heart of this is this hurting children by accident somehow quote-unquote unavoidably or is it the deterrent goal you see there on tape people like John Kelly and others admitting it's a goal no one will admit to hurting children on purpose the fact that people want to dodge the reasoning behind the passage of these laws which was to try to have a deterrent the people wanting to come across the border again it's a there's a certain hypocrisy to wanting to dodge responsibility for a law which is admittedly flawed we're talking about our immigration system does need reform it has for a decade but it's been a mess in Congress because of a gridlock I'm part of it's because of the kind of wild accusations and the wild baseless statements that have been made about how we need we need to have closed borders we can't have open borders it's not a question of just having wide open borders versus having nobody come in at all we're talking about having a reasoned and orderly process and system set up and we can't do that everybody's just yelling at each other congresswoman yes I think that we need to make sure that we have comprehensive immigration reform that has been stuck and and stymied because of Republicans objections to it but the children should not be a bargaining chip in this process and that exact is exactly what is going on right now they are using being used as a bargaining chip for twenty five billion dollars worth of funding that Donald Trump wants for the border wall these are horrendous situations where the lives of these children will be affected forever just because of money that Donald Trump wants for that border wall and that that is not right we've gone a quarter of the our henrique it with the brief time we have left what are the key what's the key fact you want people to know about the truth on the ground the fact that these people that are coming in that they have no line to get into the people that are desperate that are crossing the border and those that do have a line apply for asylum and Trump calls them animals and ms-13 right there's a lot of lies out there these are human beings right between people with dignity and respect we need humane immigration reform it wasn't the Democrats fault it's one person's fault it's Donald Trump hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
