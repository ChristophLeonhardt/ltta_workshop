SEXUAL ASSAULT, ABUSE OF
BEHAVIOR, THE EXPLOITATION OF
WOMEN BY MEN, THESE ARE
DIFFICULT TOPICS TO ADDRESS.
WE NEED A REVOLUTION BUT
DEMOCRATS UNDERMINED IT LAST
WEEK WITH POMP AND GRANDSTAND
AND CHEAP MORALIZING.
MORE DEMOCRAT HYPOCRISY THIS
WEEK ON SWAMP WATCH.
>> LET'S START WITH SENATOR
CORY BOOKER.
>> THERE ARE DARK ELEMENTS
THAT ALLOW UNCONSCIONABLE
LEVELS OF ON ACCEPTABLE LEVELS
OF ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT.
YOU ARE OPENING UP TO OPEN
AIR, HURT AND PAIN THAT GOES
ON ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
IF YOU ARE SPEAKING TRUTH THAT
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO
UNDERSTAND.
>> I AGREE AND I CAN THINK OF
ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR WHO
NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND, CORY
BOOKER HIMSELF.
HE WROTE AN ARTICLE EXAMINING
HIS OWN MISDEEDS INCLUDING
GROPING A WOMAN WITHOUT
CONSENT WHILE SHE WAS DRUNK.
TO HIS CREDIT, BACK THEN, HE
USED THE INCIDENT TO HIGHLIGHT
HIS OWN ISSUES BUT IN 2013 HE
WAS CAUGHT EXCHANGING
SALACIOUS MESSAGES WITH A
STRIPPER.
LINDSAY WE WAS REPORTEDLY
WORKING AND TOUTED ITSELF AS
THE WORLD'S FIRST VEGAN STRIP
CLUB.
SHE TOLD CORY BOOKER THE WEST
COAST AND SHE LOVED HIM AND
THAT IF YOUR POTUS, I CALLED
DIBS ON FIRST LADY.
BOOKER REPLIED THE EAST COAST
LOVE YOU AND BY THE EAST
COAST, I MEAN ME.
SHE RESPONDED NOW I'M
BLUSHING.
IN THURSDAY'S HEARING HE
RAILED AGAINST THE CULTURE
ALTHOUGH FLIRTING WITH A
STRIPPER IS FINE, SEE HOW THAT
GOES DOWN AT YOUR NEXT MEETING
MEETING.
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE END OF
IT.
OVER THE YEARS CORY BOOKER HAS
BEEN A FREQUENT VISITOR TO MY
PART OF THE WORLD, SILICON
VALLEY.
HE'S CREATED QUITE THE
IMPRESSION FROM EVERYTHING A
PERSON YOU HAD THE EXACT SAME
THING, WOW, WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH CORY BOOKER.
HE'S A REAL MESS.
I TAKE A PRETTY LIBERTARIAN
ATTITUDE ON THIS.
CHURCHILL WAS A HEAVY DRINKER
AND ONE OF THE GREATEST
LEADERS IN HISTORY.
I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF YOUR
PERSONAL LIFE IS A MESS, BUT
I'M NOT THE ONE MORALIZING ON
THAT COMMITTEE.
HERE'S ANOTHER MASSIVE
HYPOCRITE.
DIANE FINDS DOWN, CHECK THIS
OUT.
>> SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS A
SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ONE THAT
LARGELY GOES UNSEEN.
WHILE YOUNG WOMEN ARE STANDING
UP AND SAYING NO MORE, OUR
INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT
PROGRESSED AND HOW THEY TREAT
WOMEN WHO COME FORWARD.
>> THAT SOAPBOX STARTS TO LOOK
PRETTY FLIMSY WHEN YOU
CONSIDER HOW CLOSE THAT WAS TO
TED KENNEDY.
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID WHEN HE
DIED.
HE WAS A COLLEAGUE AND
INSPIRATION AND A FRIEND.
I HAVE SEEN HIM GIVE FAIRNESS
AND EQUAL RIGHTS TO ALL,
EXCEPT THE WOMAN HE
EXPLOITED.
IT INCLUDED A 1990 REPORT OF
HAVING SEX IN PUBLIC ON THE
FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON D.C.
RESTAURANT WITH A LOBBYIST.
HOW PERFECTLY SWAMPY.
AT LEAST SHE LIVED TO TELL THE
TALE UNLIKE MARY JO KENNEDY
LEFT THE GROUND.
HOW CAN DIANE FEINSTEIN BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY OF SEXUAL
VIOLENCE WHEN SHE CALLED TED
KENNEDY AND INSPIRATION?
THERE ARE PLENTY MORE
DEMOCRATS, LET'S NOT FORGET
PATRICK LAHEY.
HE HAD THIS QUESTION ON
THURSDAY.
>> THE YEARBOOK, YOU TALKED
ABOUT DRINKING AND SEXUAL
EXPLOIT, DID YOU NOT.
>> AND DID YOU NOT SENATOR
LAHEY, DELIVER A SPEECH ON THE
SENATE FLOOR WHILE DRUNK
YOURSELF.
AND THEN THERE'S KAMALA
HARRIS, CRUSADER FOR JUSTICE
AND RIGHTEOUSNESS.
SHE HAD THIS QUESTION TWO YOU
AGREE IT'S POSSIBLE FOR MEN TO
BOTH BE FRIENDS TO BE WOMEN
AND TREAT OTHER WOMEN BADLY?
>> SHE WOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT
THAT.
SHE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF
ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR AGAINST HER
STAFF.
SHE STAYS AT TOP HOTELS LIKE
THE RITZ CARLTON REFUSES THE
EAT FOOD WITH ANYTHING BUT
METAL SILVERWARE.
THAT'S NOT THE WORST OF IT.
SHE'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS PRONE
TO HOSTILE OUTBURSTS.
SHE WAS WITNESS OPERATING AN
AIDE INSIDE AN ELEVATOR.
THEY'VE TOLD ME HOW BADLY SHE
TREATS PEOPLE, AN OPEN SECRET
IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY CIRCLES.
NO ONE SAID ANYTHING BECAUSE
THEY'RE FRIGHTENED ABOUT HER
POWERFUL POLITICAL MACHINE.
SENATOR HARRIS BEFORE YOU
LECTURE ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THAT
TEMPERAMENT, AND QUITE
HONESTLY BEFORE YOU RUN FOR
PRESIDENT YOURSELF, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO WORK ON YOUR OWN
ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR.
OF COURSE WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR
