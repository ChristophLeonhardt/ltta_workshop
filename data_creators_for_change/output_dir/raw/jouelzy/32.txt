00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,450
Ohhhh boy
Where do we even begin?

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,440
Well let’s begin with I’m Jouelzy, head
Smart Brown Girl in charge and go ahead and

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,780
thumbs up because whether you like it, love
it or don’t agree at all, you’re still

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,680
engaged in a critical dialogue and that’s
what we are here for. And subscribe if you

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,690
Last week Azealia Banks did an interview with
the Breakfast Club. About half way thru, DJ

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,970
Envy asked her about earlier comments she
had made bout Cardi calling her and I quote:

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,980
[DJ Envy]: Did you call Cardi B, uh uh what
was it, an untalented rat?

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,590
[Azealia Banks]: I did

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,310
[DJ Envy]: *laughing* why? Now was this out
of nowhere? Did she start?

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,310
[Azealia Banks]: *heavy sigh*

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,570
[DJ Envy]: Out of nowhere, oh my goodness...

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,420
[Azealia Banks]: No it's not out of no where

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,920
And thus begin a roughly two minute discussion
on how Azealia believes that Cardi has privilege

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,510
most Black women don’t, and it's bringing
down...idk I mean I guess the movement. Maybe

16
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,800
you know, if we generalize basically what
she was saying.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,610
And hold up! Before y’all even get your
tweedle fingers together to type out the question:

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,890
who is Azealia Banks, (girl I see y’all
gathering the palm tree leaves to throw some

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,170
shade here). Azealia is a Black woman rapper
who is popular in the house music scene. I

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,000
do like her music alot. What I think of Azealia
as a person is that she can be mean, rude

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,750
and nasty and I’m not talking about this
interview but to acknowledge what she’s

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,360
said and done in the past particularly on
Twitter. And her recent body shaming...like

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,130
sis how we talking about black woman empowerment
dohhhh, that is not okay. AZ got some new

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,920
titties and was talking about another woman’s
natural body. I can tell you, I can tell sis

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,450
you love them new biddies. I see they perky,
they sitting up right, you ain't gotta wear

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,420
no bra no more, you eh eh eh out here in the
streets. But body shaming ain’t ever it.

27
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,620
And when I look at all the things I don’t
really agree with her on, I just really want

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,760
her to understand her platform and what fame
now means for her. That talking shit as she's

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,760
used to with her friends, she gotta keep that
in the group chat. There is no being subtle

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,919
or shady on IG Stories or Twitter without
people knowing who you are talking about and

31
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,870
it becoming an even bigger problem when you
can’t back out of what you said. She’s

32
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,150
apologized for the anti-gay, xenophobic statements
and coming for Skai Jackson, so the more recent

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,810
hiccups, are generally over things that probably
sound good in her head well as I imagine it,

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,140
they probably sound good in her head but she
doesn’t realize until she says it outloud

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,010
that she’s being rude or mean. Because we
have those moments, maybe not as harsh or

36
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,209
frequently as Azealia but you know I'm saying,
we been thru it. And if you've ever dated

37
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,140
a Gemini and I dated one or two or three and
done a storytime about at least one. A regular...a

38
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,530
a regular occurrence is did you really just
say that to me?? Like that really just come

39
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,530
out your mouth?

40
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,820
She’s the friend who makes you think and
you’ll tell her personal things cause I’m

41
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,980
sure talking thru complex or just having like
a critical dialogue and discussion with her

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,620
can be fun and interesting and she’s not
necessarily saying anything unfactual but

43
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,690
her blurting out what you told her to other
people to the public never helps the situation.

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,930
It’s like yooo why you have to say that
out loud, that was between us. Like I know

45
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,330
I said that but I didn't need you to go repeat
it.

46
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:26,590
So with regard to her comments on Cardi. Where
I do take issue is I personally do not think

47
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:33,340
that being dumb is a voluntary act, therefore
I do not believe anyone is dumb unless they

48
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,629
put effort into being so. It’s a conscious
effort and everyone has the capability of

49
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,959
being intelligent though the way we express
our intelligence varies. Yup, yup. Calling

50
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,650
Cardi dumb or illiterate counters Azealia’s
argument about the expectations held against

51
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,690
identifiably Black women versus Cardi. Because
she's referencing Cardi’s manner of speech

52
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,650
and her grammar. Black women are sidelined
for the same things every day. When you take

53
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,110
a dig at that you’re setting the bar of
intelligence based on white supremacy. Not

54
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,510
cool. And I do believe this is what triggered
Cardi.

55
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,840
I was surprised to see Cardi so amped to respond
to of all people and all the things said about

56
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,969
her - this Azealia interview really got under
her skin. But in her GQ interview done by

57
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:25,340
Caity Weaver, Cardi out loud mentions that
she’s insecure about the way she pronounces

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,830
words and she takes alot of time in the studio
to make sure she's pronouncing correctly in

59
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,469
the studio. And how because of that people
perceive her as less than. It is an insecurity

60
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:41,550
of hers. Now I personally have a wee little
bit of internet notoriety and with that comes

61
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,759
people who invest in following me simply because
they despise me. It’s wild but most negative

62
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,319
things said about me don’t really hurt me,
but whenever someone by chance hits on something

63
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,409
that I’m already insecure about, no matter
how untrue or invalid it is, it's like poking

64
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:04,509
a bear with my feelings. I be like dag! Cardi
already insecure about her pronunciation so

65
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:09,629
Azealia triggered her, but I won’t call
it bullying because I’ve seen Azealia bully

66
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,960
and that two minutes of her interview, dat
that wasn’t it.

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,159
Centering this around an individual vs the
system is unfair and while, yes, Cardi has

68
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:23,440
privilege she doesn’t deserve to have this
put on her back. Cardi is successful, yea

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,889
by nature of being herself and an entire system
of people responding to that by giving her

70
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,629
a chance and putting her own. From us an audience
and fans to the male dominate urban music

71
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,529
industry...this is the same issue I took with
the Bruno Mars and cultural appropriation

72
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:45,349
conversation. Centering racial inequalities
around a person who themselves is not the

73
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:50,819
bigot, allows the systems and structures that
uphold this to go unchecked. Even how Azealia’s

74
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,839
comments became this bigger fallout shows
these same systems and structures at play

75
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,159
with how quickly this became simply nothing
more than a Cardi vs. Azealia thing and fans

76
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,879
just having too much fun attacking both sides.
We never get to the actual conversation. Cardi

77
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,150
herself is not offensive, and on some levels
I believe she is aware of her privilege. Azealia

78
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,690
ain’t bitter but they’ve both likely ran
up against the same music execs and I promise

79
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,270
you the way AZ as a darker skinned Black woman
was talked to versus Cardi -- was likely vastly

80
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,169
different. And as someone who formerly worked
in the industry...GIRL! Let me tell you something

81
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:28,150
as basic as the way I wore my hair out. Life
if I wore my natural hair out, the way Black

82
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,849
men who talk down to me and degrade me versus
if I was done up like this, and presented

83
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:37,080
a certain way. You know it's still not respectful
at the end of the day because they sexualize

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,069
you. There's a lot of patriarchy and misogyny
that exists in the industry. But the way that

85
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,990
you can navigate that and kind of say, that
all right I know that these men ain't ish.

86
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,430
I’m sure people came at Cardi sideways too.
But consider how quick we are to call darkskin

87
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:56,020
women bitter, angry, dirty, nasty and someone
more racially ambiguous is usually chided

88
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,999
as too pretty or cute to be like that.

89
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,500
If Azealia could just be more compassionate
I think her points would be read as much more

90
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,330
salient. Because I don’t believe that an
identifiably Black woman could get away with

91
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,300
what Cardi does. CC: Fantasia Barrino. CC:
the young girl who was a friend of Trayvon

92
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,559
Martin’s that testified during George Zimmerman’s
trial. You know the jokes made about Fantasia's

93
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:22,960
literacy and the way she talks. The comments
that were made about that young girl, her

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,449
pattern of speech and the way she dressed
and the way she looked and her being too hood,

95
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:32,629
when she got up there and testified against
Zimmerman. The closest thing we have to Cardi

96
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,509
is maybe Tiffany Pollard, New York from Flavor
of Love but the major difference is that Cardi

97
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:44,699
is respected and often held as empowering.
You know they both get meme'd I guess, but

98
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,999
we look to Cardi as like a geniune celebrity
and talent and we look to Tiffany as like

99
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:55,129
a more of like a B list, like reality star.
Even though technically aren't they the same

100
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:59,949
but who do we respect more? And I mean, ok
Tiffany Haddish, but even with her I see so

101
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:07,610
much push back and respectability politics
pushed on to her. Most Black women who act

102
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,219
similarly are not getting label or even production
company support and don’t let her have the

103
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:17,919
nerve to be someone’s fourth baby momma
cause we societally are not calling that relationship

104
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,509
goals, promoting a gang without being severely
chastised. Publicly out loud acknowledging

105
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,779
that they do not write their raps but they
still wealthy. You know how we would and how

106
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:32,460
we actually do drag Black women for the same
sort of sins. That we say "Oh I love Cardi

107
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,809
for" I’m not, at least I'm trying not to
putting this on Cardi,well the gang thing

108
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,869
yeeaaaaaah sis we need to call you out on
that. But I want us to consider the role we

109
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,640
play in this and the need to check the label
execs who keep the lightskin privilege in

110
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,520
the music industry churning. I really want
to make a comment abt Jorj...but uh you know

111
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,710
that is so unnecessary that's not what this
is about. Yeah girl...mhhmmm...don't do it.

112
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,020
I’ll do this as a whole separate video,
it'll be up later this week actually. But

113
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,310
to quickly address is Cardi B Black, I always
say I don’t need her to be, because then

114
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,890
we have to, as we are complicatedly now, have
this conversation about the privilege she

115
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,450
encompasses, because folks usually want to
tag her as Black to say she’s uplifting

116
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,710
or empowering Black women and I’m like sis---let’s
not front like we love or respect Black women

117
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,930
like this when they have a bit more color,
a bit more kink or a bit more nostrils. But

118
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,240
really I don’t want to have this argument
because the power of language is not on our

119
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,140
side. I do NOT want the comments to delve
into whether are not we perceive Cardi as

120
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,450
Black on this video. Okaaay! Race is a tricky
messy thing in the American context and think

121
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,160
about how unified we could be if we had the
language to discuss the nuances of our racial

122
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,130
identity in this imperalisitic system. Bruh!
So the conversations around ethnic diversity

123
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,370
and Black people not being monolithic, race
as a social construct, phenotyping, colorism,

124
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,970
lightskin privilege, xenophobia we don’t
have the language to productively discuss

125
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,430
in a far reaching and truly impactful way
so when any of these conversations are sparked

126
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,410
with the general masses they quickly devolve
into divisive attacks.

127
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,430
Even this argument that Azealia brought about.
Iy highlights how the power of language suits

128
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,310
white supremacy because the white man sets
the standard for the words we deem as intellectual.

129
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,560
Am I making sense here?

130
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,760
The long and the short of it, is Cardi B has
a privilege -- we don’t necessarily have

131
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,090
the language to term that privilege.But she
has a privilege that is rarely extended to

132
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:37,750
identifiably Black women. The privilege is
not her fault. Azealia referencing Beyonce

133
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:44,040
and Solange was an interesting hot take. I
don't know if that really stuck with greater

134
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,980
point she was making but it was interesting.
We do negatively chastise Black women for

135
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,820
being too hood, for not speaking right, for
being baby momma’s, for being members of

136
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,990
gangs, for not being educated and not the
first wife. We definitely don’t respect

137
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,200
them, follow them, or make stars of them.
So I'm not trying to throw this and I don't

138
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,220
want you to throw this in Cardi’s face though
because we are the same ones who made her

139
00:11:09,220 --> 00:00:00,000
a star.
