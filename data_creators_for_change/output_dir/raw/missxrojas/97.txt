00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I'm a really solution</font>

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,720
driven person but for the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> month for</font>

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,130
whatever reason whether it's mental

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,859
health or just winter not leaving today

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,510
it is very nice but generally when tis

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,490
not leaving I have struggled to look at

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,799
some problems and come up with the three

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,150
or four solutions that I would normally

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,560
come up with I don't know what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like something stop generating</font>

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,330
in my brain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes me feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

12
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,640
slow and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of slogged in my</font>

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,949
head and it just makes my head feel very

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,410
heavy it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice feeling but in</font>

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,000
an effort to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reanimate the</font>

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,098
solution driven part of myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd ask for your help in providing us</font>

18
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,300
all with solutions for in my mind one of

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,770
the biggest problems on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

20
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,719
the youtube comment system now first let

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,219
me say it is because this community is

22
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">so wonderful that many of the problems</font>

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,629
that we will be trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rectify coming</font>

24
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,789
up with solutions for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't really</font>

25
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,620
prevalent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> microwave system anymore</font>

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,329
they were once they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not anymore and</font>

27
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,699
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of like the Comets</font>

28
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,949
algorithm pushing up to the top comments

29
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,629
that have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most engagement but often</font>

30
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,620
they're either the comments that

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,420
provokes the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> outraged that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provoked</font>

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,100
most heated response or they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

33
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,110
people saying horrible nasty things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

34
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,970
somehow have a slew of other people

35
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,830
saying horrible nasty things following

36
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,960
them and leaving comments and support of

37
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
them and then those comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the</font>

38
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,530
top now okay it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet why is</font>

39
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,000
this a problem well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that there</font>

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,189
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of power in the last word I</font>

41
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,049
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because I'm the youngest</font>

42
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,460
of three but maybe it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

43
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,720
last word maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the most</font>

44
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,509
visible words the most visible statement

45
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:26,340
or response<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think sets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tone for</font>

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way you feel and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of wish it</font>

didn't did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like sometimes it's</font>

48
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:31,979
going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your brain a bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shaping</font>

49
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,450
the way you think about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

50
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,729
what comments tuned for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best and for</font>

51
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,229
the worst I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about this</font>

52
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:38,970
today in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> in regards to pay</font>

53
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,590
disparity John made an excellent

54
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,150
excellent excellent video about pay

55
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,770
disparity a little while ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

56
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,210
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I shared it with</font>

someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they went straight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

58
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,030
comments of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and use the</font>

comments as a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote-unquote</font>

60
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,829
disprove what was said in the video even

61
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,210
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the video and the</font>

62
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">comments were all of these statistics</font>

63
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,259
and all of these graphs and all of these

64
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,060
facts there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people that are</font>

65
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,500
just not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be persuaded by facts</font>

66
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,329
and I accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's this kind of</font>

67
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,450
like self-reinforcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mob style</font>

68
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,730
reaction when you

69
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,560
have all of these negative comments in

70
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,060
one place what are some possible

71
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,530
solutions for that and what is the best

72
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,940
approach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it best to just</font>

73
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,800
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the comments there even though</font>

74
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it might make people uncomfortable to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">making the video really not want to make</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the video but you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always see LGBTQ</font>

78

people women people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who aren't white or</font>

79
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,330
being i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess most targeted for that</font>

80
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,180
sort of hate and then we're less likely

81
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,330
to see them rise up and have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> voice</font>

82
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">has been given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume that they</font>

83
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,720
should despite the fact that you have

all these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess commenting on</font>

85
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,180
our videos but more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than they're not to</font>

86
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,590
tear them down I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

87
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,820
phrase that correctly but that's kind of

88
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,190
my my thinking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do we</font>

89
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach the problem of comments I just</font>

90
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,880
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like always complaining about</font>

91
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,230
comments we're not really knowing what

92
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,670
the solution is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there have</font>

93
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,380
been some features that are important

94
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,420
that our tremendous I think that's a

95
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,370
feature that lets you plug in words to

96
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">black ghost I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's fantastic I</font>

97
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,480
have a better sense of sort of asserting

98
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,180
my right to ban someone from my channel

99
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,310
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi some of my comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

100
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube has done a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things to</font>

101
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,160
through the dashboard feature to make

102
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">people more well equipped to tackle</font>

103
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,390
comments but even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things like</font>

104
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,010
comment moderation you still have to go

105
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,870
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these pages of horrible</font>

106
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,459
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are saying to see</font>

107
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:24,050
whether someone's like slip through the

108
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,580
net how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we create a system that</font>

109
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">favors comments that add to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality</font>

110

of discussion or even if not quality

111
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,459
like that don't poison the well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

112
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">think has happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times and</font>

113
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,739
also has granted the latest people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

115
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,700
because I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other week that there</font>

116
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,170
is a feature that allows on every single

117

<font color="#CCCCCC">video you decide whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

118
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">display top comments first or newest</font>

119
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,260
first as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default that video and</font>

120
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's great but what happens when you</font>

121
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,020
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video about pay disparity or</font>

LGBTQ issues race in any way shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

123
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,030
form and that video gets shared in

places and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who come to</font>

aren't productive or even true or just

problem really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what becomes a problem so</font>

that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot to do there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>
