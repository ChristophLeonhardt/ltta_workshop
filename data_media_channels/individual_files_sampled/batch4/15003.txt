he's in a conflict okay yeah he's got ethical issues that he needs to deal with Bill Morneau must go which is why we're spreading the message here today right in the financial district of downtown Toronto with this signage equipped truck telling Canadians to sign our petition to have the federal Finance Minister do the right thing and resign hey ladies have a quick second for questions quick question okay that's how they roll down here at being well folks the corner of Bayon King at the heart of the financial district in Toronto probably the worst place in Canada to do Streeters everyone is either late for a meeting or they just don't have time not even time enough to talk about our shady finance minister so we brought the show on the road to young Dundas Square and we'll see what the common man driving the common van has to say about Bill Morneau that's a resounding hell yes why do you think he hasn't resigned or the Prime Minister hasn't fired him given the alleged indiscretions well I think the Prime Minister is corrupt as much as he is if you're gonna take the risk to get into business then I think he should be rewarded for the the upside and the government shouldn't be taxing wealth creation I think it's a little bit of a irony that the Finance Minister has so much capital himself has not declared this to taxpayers I think that's terrible well he hasn't even apologized so do you think that maybe the Prime Minister should fire mm yeah if he's not going to apologize but if he apologized and that's admitting that he's done it so he's not gonna apologize well the ethics commissioner already found him in violation and this multi-millionaire was fined a grand total of $200 oh yes he should be fired I don't think so why is that sir well they'll just get someone else the same as him well certainly put it this way if you were indeed Prime Minister would you fire Finance Minister Bill Morneau well he would be one of them to be fired I think that the Prime Minister should take a look at his finance minister and make some tough decisions well I'll tell you the ethics commissioner found Finance Minister Bill Maher know in violation and the fine - this multi-millionaire was $200 what do you think about that yeah well it's fixed it says ante on your shirt you're not a member of anti-fire yeah no it's cousin to Rihanna it was a Rihanna concert yeah yeah you're not gonna beat me up or anything yeah oh no no no no not at all I am totally there's actually a van over here over there but I had firemen or mono comm on it so I guess it's a website you can go on to sign a petition you're gonna contribute to that petition probably hey folks running this truck with the jumbotron isn't cheap it's probably about 1,600 bucks all expenses in but we couldn't have done it without you are generous rebel viewers thank you so much and let's hope that Finance Minister Bill Morneau gets the message like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video
