1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,210
Can you hear this noise?

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,469
[beep]

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,910
Of course you can.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,890
It’s well within the hearing
frequency range of humans.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,730
What about this?

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,800
Probably not,
unless you’re furry

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,860
and bark when your human
won’t take you out.

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,094
And what if you paddle with
two webbed feet and quack?

9
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:22,730
What do ducks hear underwater?

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,820
That, as it happens, was one
of science’s unanswered —

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,970
actually, unasked —

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,270
questions until now.

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,220
Scientists from the
University of Delaware

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,830
have changed that by creating
an underwater hearing test

15
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,740
for ducks.

16
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,490
First, ducklings learn to
peck a target like this pipe.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,340
Then they hear a sound
and receive a treat.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,760
After months of work to learn
the complicated sequence

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,110
of the real test,
a few of the ducks

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,960
graduate to the big pool.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,220
Here’s how it goes:

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,980
An LED light tells
the duck to dive.

23
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,320
We can’t see it.

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,740
The duck pecks a target —

25
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,430
the pipe.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,590
If it hears the second
sound underwater —

27
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,290
[beep]

28
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,614
Then it rises to peck
the second target

29
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:04,950
and get a treat.

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,280
By changing the frequency
of the second sound,

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,370
researchers learn the
range of duck hearing.

32
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,390
Researchers did dozens
of experiments —

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,360
some with one duck,
some with more,

34
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,460
and tried various frequencies.

35
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,740
Here’s one of the
researchers, Kate McGrew,

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,290
monitoring the ducks and
controlling the beeps.

37
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,880
[click]

38
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,190
Some ducks didn’t
make the cut.

39
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,810
So why does it matter
what ducks hear?

40
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,300
Diving ducks, also
called sea ducks,

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,360
are getting caught and killed
in commercial fishing nets —

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,610
probably many
thousands of them,

43
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,070
although the numbers
are hard to pin down.

44
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,430
Devices that send out
sounds or pings

45
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,370
have been used to warn
dolphins away from nets.

46
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,680
So, they might
work with ducks.

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,250
The trick is, the sounds
have to be inaudible to fish

48
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,290
and audible to ducks.

49
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,210
Early indications
from the study

50
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,270
are that the prime range
for duck hearing underwater

51
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,790
is between 1 and 3 kilohertz.

52
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,710
That’s good to
know, but it does

53
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,010
present some practical
problems because fish hear up

54
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,450
to 2 kilohertz,

55
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,240
and you don’t want
to scare them away.

56
00:02:08,240 --> 00:00:00,000
But it’s a great first step
in understanding duck hearing.
