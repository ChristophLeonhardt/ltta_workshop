this is a Qatari indoor arena and it's one of the most extraordinary venues to host World Cup matches this summer it's a brand new stadium but they've put in 12,000 additional seats only for the four games being played here and you might ask yourself what's extraordinary about that well all of those extra seats are actually outside the arena what else is special about this city I'm Peter Schmeichel and I'm here to find out yeah got a rainbow is so close to the Ural Mountains which makes a place full of natural resources one of them is gold and now I'm gonna produce my own gold bar that's very hard by the way I'm gonna put a wide line on the form here when I pour the goal into here I need to be able to see when it's full that is a fridge that's cooling the gold down and when you see what that does in a minute turn down the fridge you can see by the exits and changes Paulo seems putting down by the way the color is changing you see the edges that it's orange in the middle once it's not too orange anymore that's when we turn this off so it's done now don't forget that only three minutes ago that was a thousand degrees fluid look at this I can pick it up now this is half a million dollars and enough goal to make two FIFA World Cup trophies so in Russia there is a very big tradition and circus performances and in yakitori Noire that's one of the best circuses in the whole country and what they also have is this school for young hopeful performance and this is where I am I'm trying to pick up one or two little tips circuit performance a little bit like football players or professional athlete they do train a little bit more I have to say the little girls here it's everyday for hours and then they grow into young ladies like these two 18 years of age it's taking them between 2 and 5 hours and 15 years to get to that level now it's my turn to go and have some fun one of the FIFA ambassadors in Yekaterinburg is Aleksandr Pantheon he's a rock legend and he's in this club rehearsing with a young band sorry sorry to interrupt you Alexander how are you good to meet you the official poster for the World Cup is featuring the biggest star live Yashin yes and you are writing a musical about him yes for Billy fashion as a grade we'll keep your own Prussia it's very important for me to say about this great goalkeeper what's also great is this city it's been likened to Manchester Allies because of Industry and music why don't we play a Manchester song
