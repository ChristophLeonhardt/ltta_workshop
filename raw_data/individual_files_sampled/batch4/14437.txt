fact of the matter is that reaons who believe that the 1979 revolution was going to lead to more freedom and more prosperity were disappointed and more recently Iranian to believe that the Iran deal that the President Obama concluded with the with the rulers of Iran which brought tens of billions of dollars to Loretta that was going to help their lives they've been disappointed with that as well because the money is gone for missile programs and to support terrorism and that sort of thing and I think they're just very frustrated now a lot of the media said oh this is mainly about the price of eggs about economics but if you listen to the chants in the street you know that's not true yeah it's amazing how uniformed the media is and oh this has nothing to do with politics it's all about economics and it's they sure are taking that uniform line I think it's because they want they don't want to have a democratic victory on Trump's watch I actually believe that journalists and pundits and a lot of the foreign policy establishment I mean I'm not going to say they would rather Iran remain a dictatorship than it become free but they're certainly grudging about acknowledging it for what it is I think because they don't want Barack Obama's Iran policy to be discredited and Donald Trump's straight talk to be credited I truly think Western observers are that petty what do you think I don't disagree with you they're also fight a few apologists that this Iranian regime have been for a very long time particularly on the Left Nyack folks who support the this regime in various ways and then as you say they don't want to discredit President Obama either because of his nuclear deal with Iran which never had majority support in Congress or with the public nor do they want to implicitly criticize President Obama for not supporting the demonstrators in 2009 when they were out in the streets saying Obama are you with us or against us and he refused to answer because he saw that to taught with their rulers with the Supreme Leader which is another which is a euphemism for dictator he saw that as the right road to take and by the way he was supported in that by a great most majority I would say of the foreign policy of Washington and of Europe as well that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
