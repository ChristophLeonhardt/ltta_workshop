00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
hey guys this is going to be the

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,389
quickest video of all time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

3
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:04,799
gonna be edited because it probably come

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,060
down after it stopped seeing relevant

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,269
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had this kind of like guilt</font>

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,700
about this channel and how like and like

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,870
I love the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">just overwhelmed at how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font>

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,410
actually watching and sometimes I feel

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,109
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eat use that power frivolously</font>

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,939
just to talk about mascara and obscure o

12
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,980
is of utmost importance at certain times

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,220
a day<font color="#CCCCCC"> but generally if you could have</font>

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,300
overseen a whole of your life<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I</font>

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,310
important and I kind of think that

16
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,900
sometimes I want the meaning of the

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,450
channel to transcend that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

18

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to somebody and a cause i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

funding for it which is understandable

48
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,049

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,869
Hollywood films I'm one of those people

62
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,540
like sometimes I'm like oh so every film

63
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,130
ends the same and like oh they always

64
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,360
just pick like the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good-looking</font>

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,310
actors and of course they all end up

66
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,229
together or of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course this happens and</font>

67
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh yeah like I you know if you think the</font>

68
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:11,879
clich√© of Hollywood is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> living up</font>

69
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:12,819
your expectations about

70
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,019
film you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your money</font>

71
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:15,640
where your mouth is and try and fund

72
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,099
these independent like projects that

73
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,150
people are coming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like really</font>

74
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,969
organic beautifully talented people are

75
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,290
here sitting there with all of these

76
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas and all these resources and and</font>

77
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,950
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they need that kind of little</font>

78
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,269
kick start to kind of push them forward

79
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,670
and like if you think that you're you

80
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,189
are being misread spoons reckless as an

81
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,450
audience member because you know let's

82
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">face it film is for the audience is not</font>

83
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,200
for anybody else but you feel like

84
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fulfilled at the odeon</font>

85
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,590

86
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking into these independent</font>

87
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,959
