this is another Kingdom by me Andrew Klavan performed by Michael Knowles in the last episode back in LA Austin Lively located a novel called another Kingdom that described the strange land of Galliano where he was accused of the murder of lady kata Paula but before he could find the book he was swept back into that land and put on trial a witness the beautiful lady Beth array claimed to have seen him committing adultery with the victim and now another Kingdom episode for it was impossible it was insane how could the lady Beth array love me I didn't even know her but all this was impossible it was all insane and the more I thought about it the more certain I was of what I saw her eyes condemned me her eyes were furious with me but it was the condemnation of betrayal the fury of her pain of her love and there was something else an image in my mind a visceral flashback something that never happened and yet something I felt I remembered a kiss her lips lady Beth araise lips on mine her soft shape pressed against me after all that I was in such a stupor of confusion that the rest of the trial passed by like a procession seen through deep fog there was other testimony I remember a physician of some sorts of the stand he testified that what lady Beth array said was true lady kata had in fact been pregnant when she was stabbed to death and I remember sir Arabist he told how I had appeared in the city suddenly how I insinuated my way into court insinuated was the word he used he said he had suspected me from the first of conspiring to overturn the New Republic and restore the monarchy he said he had had his agents follow me and they had eventually followed me to my meeting with lady cotta in the tower room he told how they had come to fetch him then and how he and his men had broken through the locked door and found lady caught a dead of a dagger wound and the bloody dagger still in my hands that was the worst part of it for me the locked room the bloody dagger because I knew it was true but all this as I said went by in a fog and if it was horrifying to hear the witnesses building a case around me like a coffin well it was also horrifying that I could barely feel it except as a general deadening atmosphere of horror oh but that was before the end of it I felt the end of it all right the final horror broke through the horror fog like a horror freight train and ran right over me at the end of it when the testimony was done the creepy wizard guy bent down again and whispered in Lord irons ear Lord iron listened and nodded and smacked his gavel on the judges bench he looked down at me from his great height so that I quailed with fresh fear even before he spoke and then he spoke he said Austin Lively the court has determined that the testimony of the witnesses has created substantial doubt about your claim of innocence therefore we decree in command that you should be returned to the dungeon and placed into the custody of the executioner to be tortured until you admit the full truth wait what I whispered take him away said Lord iron I shouted wait no you can't do that it's unconstitutional you can't but they could two guards grabbed my elbows I struggled as they forced me up the aisle toward the great doors toward the angry crowd toward the dungeon I'm innocent in my mind I could hear the endless shrieks of the tortured heretic as the guards dragged me away to suffer his same fate the dreary nightmare scenes replayed in Reverse the angry crowd trying to lynch me as I was hustled from the Tribunal Hall back to the castle the stone stairway down into the hell of the dungeon the beak nosed jailer with his giggle and his torch leading the way into the cell the one-eyed fang mouth - ogre going batshit roaring and squealing and straining against his chains so that dust flew from the walls and I expected the anchoring rings to fly free at any moment then the jailer and the guards were gone again the ogre settled down and slept again i sat in the dust again manacled to the wall it was all just the same as before except for the heretic he was back now chained in his corner naked but he was not the same while the jailer remained with his torch I could see everything that had been done to him I won't describe what he looked like it was unspeakable and I was next the executioner was coming to do the same to me any minute now any second hours and endless hours of torment would begin and when they were done my life would be over worse than over I would be that that thing in the corner I could hear him in the shadows trying to express his pain and anguish with what was left of his mouth even if I made it back to LA I would be that that thing I realized I had never been afraid before not really not like this I remembered back in elementary school being scared the teacher would call on me when I didn't know the answer I remembered being scared I would be grounded after I set the backyard shed on fire while sneaking some cigarettes I remembered finding a lump under my arm and how I thought it might be cancer I remembered a minor car accident I'd been in that was my history of fear all of it what a life I'd lived till now what an easy life because this this was unbearable sitting in the dark waiting for the executioner waiting for the hours of agony staring through the shadows at what I would be when it was over the remnant of a human being the weirdly surviving pieces I turned away from him I gazed down at the dust my whole body trembled I tried to swallow I couldn't I tried to hold back my tears I couldn't a high pooling wine of supplication and misery came out of me I was helpless with horror then a shock something caught my eye some dim momentary something to my left I turned and gasped startled that thing was back that rodent with a woman's face it was sitting right next to me a deformed Beast creepy staring at me it's black eyes glittering in the shadows the sight of it made me start back in gag Jesus Christ I cried out in a thin hoarse voice it just sat there part rat part woman a hideous mutant it just went on staring with its bizarrely human eyes after a second it glowed again the way it had last time briefly throwing off a confetti of colored lights then going dark horror added to horror force the words out of me for God's sake what are you she it snorted snorted with derision she was mocking me such a human sound but coming from this monstrosity made it seem all the more monstrous what I said what are you it spoke even that was awful even the fact that it spoke that such a creature could speak what are you it said she said because it had a woman's voice though so high-pitched and nasal it sounded as much like a mouse as squeal what I said again barely able to get the word out strangled by my fear of what was coming for me any minute any second what are you she said again I'm mod that's who I am what are you what him I'm a man I said through my tears she snorted again snorted derisively her rolled her eyes a man she said look at you what the I could barely think I was so terrified every word we spoke meant a second past every second that passed brought me closer to the torture chamber you're a rat and you're talking to me you're some kind of what the are you why are you here it's a long story said mod the mutant rodent woman a sin a curse a quest you want to hear about it or you want to get out of here what you want get out you can get me out I want to get out I eagerly turn toward her toward her away from what was left of the heretic I tried to focus what can you do not much said the rodent girl I have no magic of my own but if I can channel the forest Kings I might be able to get those manacles off you I thrust my hands toward her eagerly no clue what the she was talking about but if there was any chance she looked me dead in the eye and spoke with maddening slowness but I can't do it with you mewling like a hungry kitten a man she muttered derisively again just do it just get these things off me I said holding my hands out again so that my chains rattled can you get the door open to maybe like I said I have to channel torrid ano so you have to shut up and let me focus I'm quiet I'm quite a do-it I said I glanced over my shoulder toward the door it was silent out there in the dungeon maze in here in the cell the ogre snored the heretic and the shadows made his terrible low laments that was all I faced the awful rodent girl again Maud she was gazing at the manacles on my wrists taking deep breaths that made her furry front rise and fall come on come on I whispered shut up I'm focusing I managed to bite back my curse once again the rainbow sparkle of light flew off her as it did I saw her quickly raised her four paws and there clawed twig like fingers like the fingers of a squirrel it seemed like the coloured light was sucked back into her swoosh all at once and then colored lightnings sparked out of her claws there was an electric Fritz and I felt the heat on my wrists and saw the manacles leap and tremble under the flashing current then the sparks died I pulled at the manacle on my right wrist with the fingers in my left hand it held fast it isn't I started to say but Maud hissed at me shut up you think this is easy well do it do it again she sat there breathing focusing waiting again the colored lights came off her she raised her claws she gave a little high-pitched grunt of effort the light was sucked back into her and the sparks flew and hit the manacles I felt the metal jump and tremble against my flesh I willed the manacles to snap apart but then then horribly footsteps footsteps on the dungeon stairs jailer it was the executioner the heretic in the coroner heard him and gave a squeaking moan of fear through the hole in what was left of his face jailer I'm here for the prisoner lively the sparks from the rodents claws winked out I tried to break the manacle again again it wouldn't budge er I heard the jailers door come creaking open I saw the glow of torchlight spilling through the window hole in the cell door I'm coming I'm coming I heard the jailer say the mutant rodent was just sitting there again I whimpered at her please stop it she spat in a harsh whisper you say you're a man be a man I heard the jailers Keys rattle as his footsteps approached the door other footsteps joined with his the heavy footsteps big men the heretics tongueless moans of fear grew louder and more awful I tried to compose myself I thought be a man I drew a deep breath I said a prayer my parents had taught me there was no god but I prayed anyway it just came out of me I held my hands out and was silent letting the rodent girl focus the jailer was at the door I heard his key slip into the keyhole the confetti of colored lights flew off the rodent girl again and was sucked back into her again and shot out of her four paws again and the manacles heated and shook and rattled on my wrists I looked on in hope but desperate hope what good would this do me now even if my hands were free how could I fight the executioner in his armed guards they would cut me down with their swords or batter me senseless and in the end they would carry me off to the torture hole no matter how I tried to stop them the jailers key turned in the lock the heavy latch clunked back the heretic led out of pitifully inarticulate moan of terror and at the same moment the giant ogre left to its feet roaring its squealy roar and rattling its chains as it's one I rode wildly in its forehead and its mouth open wide to show its shark like fangs the manacles burst apart on my wrists yes dami cried Maud in triumph the cell door swung open there was the jailer with his flaming torch and his warty face and his sadistic grin there was the Blythe executioner in his man striding in to fetch me with his two husky armed guards right behind him the ogre squealed and roared he tried to get it straining his chains the jailor gleefully tormented him with his torch flames I left to my feet the executioner saw at once that the manacles were off me aw hell he's got free grab him he said he spoke quickly but casually he wasn't worried at all it was obvious why not the two guards were tall and thick and muscular with swords dangling from their belts I had no chance against them the cell was full of noise the ogre roaring and squealing the heretic moaning and groaning the guards rushed past the executioner on either side charging at me I threw a punch at one of them a week sloppy pathetic punch my muscles such as they were had gone wobbly with fear the guard blocked the blow easily and grabbed my arm the other guard grabbed my other arm just like that they had me locked up between them even struggling with all the strength of my terror I was helpless all right fellows bring him along said the executioner in his blithely competent way but before they could start to drag me to the door the colored lights came up out of my rodent friend again quickly Maud threw her fore paws out and the lights were sucked back into her and the sparks flew from her four balls this time she pointed her claws across the cell the spark slept the long distance and struck the ring in the wall that anchored the ogres chains the ring was already so loose it shuddered and fell from the stone immediately all at once the ogre was free in an unthinkably swift instant the one-eyed monsters great horse haunch of an arm lashed out and knocked the torch from the jailers hand the flaming stick went flying past my head and in the same second as we were all turning to look the ogre grabbed the jailer and his two huge fists and lifted him off his feet as if he had no weight at all the jailer shrieked like a little girl on a roller coaster or shrieked one half a shriek that was cut off as the ogre brought him to his gaping mouth as he would a chicken leg and bit through his throat with those gigantic fangs all this took a moment less then the jailers cowled head tumbled to the floor landing with a wet thud while a geyser of blood doubted from his severed roaring the ogre hurled the spasming corpse at the executioner the corpse hid the masked man and sent him stumbling back as yet more blood spouted and sprayed from its neck the ogre squealed and reached for the next nearest man the guard who held my left arm the monster tore him off me the guard threw wild punches at the creature screaming as he was hoisted off his feet the guard on my right arm let me go and drew his sword with a swish of metal the executioner cursed the heretic tried to yell and the rodent woman Maud screamed run knively Ron I ran I sprinted for the open cell door there was no one to stop me the executioner was down near The Heretic tangled under the jailers spouting juddering corpse one guard was rushing at the ogre as the ogre began to devour the other I shot through the door into the dancing shadows of the dungeon labyrinth I started to turn toward the stairway but then the mutant rodent woman came flying out of the cell all four legs splayed as she left off in the other direction her high cry reached me over the screams and shouts from within the cell this way I dashed after her she ran down a corridor of cells under an arch and I was right behind her springing ahead of me on her four legs she arced up over a wall as she scattered round a corner down another hall I made the turn a second later and plunged blindly into a long tortuous corridor that led away into blackness the shouts and cries from the cell faded behind me and the glow of the flame light faded too I raced down the corridor deeper and deeper into the dark I saw something straight in front of me and only just managed to duck before I smashed my head against a low ledge I had entered another corridor its ceiling lower its walls tighter I had to slow down had to raise my hands to either side of me to feel my way between the walls as the dark Ruth thicker and thicker only the feel of the rough stone under my fingers guided me only the occasional confetti of pastel lights from the rodent girl kept me from stumbling on the uneven floor the rodent turned another corner and I lumbered after her I lost sight of her in the darkness and was about to call out when I heard her voice again here she sparkled with colored light and I was stunned to find her suddenly right at my feet I'm not strong enough she said help me quick she had her four paws raised again the magic glimmer came off her swept back into her shot from her claws and sparks to hit an arched great set into the stone wall the great was about four feet tall and three feet wide made of heavy iron it jumped and trembled as the sparks battered it but it didn't come free come on she said I knelt down and braced my feet against the ground I grabbed the bars in my two hands I pulled it rattled but held fast wait for me damn it squealed Maud panting I waited kneeling there gripping the grate by the bars white-knuckled and now I heard the shouts of men approaching the executioner into guard the surviving guard come on he's on the run the executioner was shouting which way there there's his footsteps this way I don't know how they've gotten away from the ogre but they had and they were coming for me I glanced at the road and girl she sat there in the dark still gathering her energy steadying her focus I wanted to urge her on but I pressed my lips tight and kept silence I heard from the executioner they can't be far come on his voice was heart-stoppingly close one corridor away I could see the glow of torchlight now growing brighter as my pursuers came on I breathed deep trying to stay silent stay calm and there it was the rainbow sparkle off the rodent mod the flash of sparks from her four paws the double stream of colored electricity hit the barred gate and made it leap in my fingers at that same moment I yanked hard on the bars there was a loud scraping noise then I toppled backwards onto my ass as the grate broke out of the stone and came away in my hands instantly the rodents sprang through the opening come on Daria's came the shout from the end of the corridor I turned and with a jolt of sickening fear I saw the executioner come chasing around the corner his masked countenance lit by the fire of the torch he held high the remaining guard was running right behind him his sword flashing in his hand I threw the grate aside and scrambled on my belly over the dirt floor to the opening I slithered through as fast as I could and instantly found myself lying in the carpeted Hall outside my apartment in North Hollywood I lay there looking around me wild-eyed my heart was hammering and my mind teetered on the edge of madness I scrambled to my feet and stood there gaping I couldn't have been more dumbstruck if I had found myself lost among the stars in deepest space I turned this way and that my hands lifted my mouth open I sucked in breath trying to steal my heart the way you do when you come out of a nightmare I had no idea why I was out here in the hall I could not remember where I had been going I couldn't think at all in fact it came to me that I ought to get back into my apartment before someone saw me here and realized how crazed I was I went to my apartment door then froze in place what if I went through and found myself back in Galliano chasing through those dungeons with the executioner right behind me it took me several seconds to work up the courage but what choice did I have if anyone saw me like this they'd call an ambulance I'd be put away I drew my keys from my pocket unlocked the door and pushed it open I peeked through there was my apartment all right just as always but what would happen to me if I crossed the threshold I stepped over slowly gingerly as if that would prevent my being teleported or whatever the hell it was back into the dungeon I made it through into the living room I shut the door behind me and let out a held breath and I stumbled to my writing desk and dropped down dead weight into my chair I don't know how long I sat there trying to gather my wits probably only minutes but they were long minutes lost in a state of disjointed consciousness that was as close to insanity as I'd ever come I had to calm myself down before I could even become hysterical then I leaned my elbows on the desk and buried my face in my hands I started trembling uncontrollably what is happening to me i hissed into my palms what is happening it had to be psychosis or a brain tumor or some drugs I'd taken by mistake or something but how would anything explain the bruise on my head from Sir Arvest sword or the purple marks on my wrists from the manacles I pulled my face out of my hands and looked at them the bruises were still there on my wrists plus I saw red splotches where the sparks from the mutant rodent woman's Claus had singed me I shook my head the mutant rodent woman I said aloud with a kind of dazed wonder how could those words even make any sense let alone describe something real that I had seen with my own two eyes slowly slowly I got hold of myself at least to the point where I could start to string some thoughts together what had I been doing here here in this life before I'd been carried back to Galliano this life I thought my life real life it came back to me the book another Kingdom by Ella Nevermore that's right I had walked out of the apartment to go see Sean Gunther the writer who had submitted the book to mythos productions submitted it and then withdrawn it before I could read it through the book was linked to Galliano it took place in East Room where the castle was in the dungeon the characters in the book were the people I had seen there Sir arriviste Lord Iron Lady Beth RA and the rest the book was the connection the only connection I had between Galliano and la it was the only clue I had to what was going on I had to try and find it I stood up and almost had to sit right down again dizziness and nausea coming over me in a wave maybe instead of finding the book I should get to a doctor I thought but no I needed to know what was happening to me I fought the sickness off and made my way back to the door I reached for the doorknob held the doorknob but I couldn't turn it I was paralyzed paralyzed with the fear that I would step across the threshold and find myself back there back in the dungeon on the run I stood there long seconds unable to move be a man I whispered then I turned the knob opened the door and walked out I drove my battered Nissan out of the garage up onto the evening streets I was still in a daze my mind flashing from one impossible image to another I let out a shuddering sigh as I remember the moment when the ogre had ripped off the jailers head I've remembered the spout of blood and the wet sound the head made when it hit the cell floor Jesus Jesus I whispered as I drove there were other memories the jostling crowd raging at me the judges on their high bench looking down at me with cold doom in their eyes lady Beth array the thought of her seemed to draw me even deeper into a dream state the thought of how she looked in her tiara with her raven hair spilling down in her flowing gown of white and gold how she moved in it how she spoke like silver bells ringing and as I thought of her it happened again just as it had happened in the courtroom when she faced me I felt her kiss warm on my lips felt her arms around me her body pressed against mine a visceral memory that could not be a memory at all because it had never happened all the same the absurd realism of it made my body stir I drew a long deep breath forcing myself out of my trance I looked around to get my bearings where was I I was stopped the Nissan was stopped at a red light at an intersection on the desolate stretch of Lankershim that led to the freeway there was a Yummie Tummie donut shop to my right and a mini-mall way across the broad boulevard to my left lady better a melted from my vision as I focused on the barracks like buildings and glaring street lamps of the real world then I glanced up into my rearview mirror that's when I saw the black Mustang I said aloud in the craziness of transition from one world to another I had forgotten all about it that car that had been parked outside my building in the red no parking zone I could see the may be transgender maybe guy maybe girl sitting behind the wheel staring right at me I could see through his windshield the bland eerie smile on the kittenish face beneath his short blonde hair I could see another man sitting in the passenger seat beside him a great Hulk of a man shaved head enormous chest enormous arms face expressionless a thug if ever there was one why were they following me was i paranoid to think that now they had to be I remembered now how they had sat outside while I slept how I had caught the driver looking up at my window and now they were here come on I wasn't being paranoid at all they were watching me keeping tabs on where I was going the light turned green I drove on checking the rearview every few seconds the Mustang stayed a small distance behind me I changed lanes quickly without a turn signal heading for the freeway another car a red Passat pulled up into my wake but the Mustang pulled over behind the Passat and kept on coming what the hell I thought why would anyone follow me it made no sense did it have something to do with this nightmarish fantasy I was bouncing in and out of it had to write who was I a story analyst a reader another nobody showbiz wannabe one of a zillion in LA it had to be about this about Galliano why else would anyone even bother with me and what was I supposed to do about it that was the real question the urgent question should I just ignore these guys just let them trail me all the way to Shaun Gunther's house that didn't feel right somehow what business was it of theirs where I was going and why should Shaun Gunther be caught up in my troubles but what other options did I have I slit up the ramp onto the Hollywood Freeway the home from work traffic was dense but it was moving smoothly looking up in the rearview again I spotted the Mustang lurking a few cars back keeping its distance but sticking to my tail I tried to convince myself I was imagining things but I knew I wasn't I faced forward in my job I must have read at least two dozen books or scripts in which the hero got followed by the bad guy or vice versa I tried to think about how they had handled it I remembered one scene in one novel that had stuck with me because it had an air of realism I couldn't remember the book's title officer in trouble officer down something like that it was this gritty crime thing the narrator had talked about how hard it was to follow somebody especially if you didn't want to be obvious about it it really required teams of people he said one car alone was too obvious and made it too easy for the target to slip away that encouraged me if it was easy to give a single tale to lip then maybe even I could do it it was worth a try I remember the rest of the scene - it was a freeway scene just like this one I remembered how the hero had lost the tail I made my decision my heart sped up but I wasn't afraid well I was afraid but I was excited to Hollywood schmuck becomes Hollywood hero be a man I liked the idea i signaled and pulled into the next lane over then the next lane until I was up against the carpool lane as far to the left as I could go I checked the mirror sure enough the Mustang had edged over with me huh that was the exact same mistake the bad guys had made in the novel I read I looked ahead the accident of Burbank was coming up I waited my heart was really hopping now I let the exit get closer closer I was almost past it when I saw my chance a small opening in the traffic to my right quickly suddenly I hit the gas hit the wheel a horn bellowed as I cut into the lane brakes screech taz I cut over again into the right lane I was past the legal exit onto the ramp but I could still make it if I cross the double line I hold the wheel over another horn how old at me the next moment I was on the exit ramp rolling into Burbank before the freeway sank out of sight I cast a glance in the direction of the Mustang it was stuck one lane over no chance it could reach the ramp in time no way it could break or back up in the traffic I saw the shave headed Hulk turn and give me the sneering stare of cold death well bite me Sluggo the black car kept heading south helplessly until it was gone from view I came off the freeway and turned the Nissan away from the boulevard into the side streets the first chance I got I made turn after turn travelling block after block past lawns and houses making my roundabout way toward the Hollywood Hills I kept checking the rearview but there was no sign of the Mustang I had lost it for the first time in what seemed like forever I laughed out loud too soon I laughed way too soon this has been another Kingdom by Andrew Klavan performed by Michael nose
