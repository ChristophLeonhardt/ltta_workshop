earlier this week the House passed a bill that would ban 20-week abortions on the premise that that unborn fetuses can feel pain now unfortunately for them thousands of studies and doctors have come out to say that this is not rooted in any science or facts now earlier this week representative Trent Franks who introduced the bill called pain capable unborn child protection act tweeted out this thing saying it's science unborn babies feel pain by at least twenty weeks late dismemberment abortions are too extreme for America I like how you used the foot of like a three-year-old in that picture can you go back I mean that is like such a giant that's my foot but then Daniel Grossman who's a doctor who's a practicing physician public health researcher and a professor of ob/gyn and reproductive services at the University of California San Francisco responded to his tweet and it went viral so let's get into it he goes hi representative Trent Franks I'm a researcher and abortion provider this isn't actually science I'd be happy to educate you about it if you'd like so he did first you should know that late term abortion is not a medical term at all anti-abortion advocates made it up that's very interesting and because of restrictions on access patients have a hard time getting a first trimester abortion now he also tweeted out and very informative fact sheet of why patients might get an abortion at 20 weeks or right after and so said 80% of women seeking later abortion have at least one of five characteristics women raising children alone women with a history of substance abuse heavy drinking and/or depression that's the second most common reason women who experienced recent conflict or violence with their partner women who had trouble deciding what to do about the pregnancy followed by trouble accessing services and women under the age of 20 who had never given birth first of all any sort of abortion after 20 weeks only account for 1.4 percent of abortions but the second of all like when you look at these reasons like it just sort of like illuminates effect like you like you don't want to bring a child into these circumstances right if the mother is a you know heavy drug user or Drinker and is suffering from a mental illness and besides you know what this is not the right home to bring a child into or she's facing domestic abuse and she doesn't want to bring a child into that home why on earth would you say not too bad like sucks for you you have to bring a child there that world and then they're going they're going to be brought up in that world when you look at children who were brought up in homes with a drink heavy drinking or alcohol abuse or drug abuse or domestic violence that cycle is perpetuated cycle is continued and so you are not pro-life you are continuing a cycle of really awful behavior right but their argument is like you're killing a baby like I'd rather have get the baby in a new home I think it's more like it's still inside her it's her body get off it yeah stay away whatever reason like now now I've now have given room to your rhetorical approach and kind of given it merit as like yeah it is a baby and I don't it is a it is you know if I an individual and it's at you kind of describing it as once it's already outside the body and he and the thing is like no it's inside her it's her body let her make the decision I don't care what you think it's not your purview right and so there have been I mean know if we're gonna talk about science and facts like there have been multiple multiple studies that have tried to sort of figure out when the fetus might be able to feel pain and most of these things conclude that it's probably not until the third trimester due to the development of the fetus and so that's also important science to include in this right and there's not like third trimester abortions like that's not a thing but you're almost conceding too much there I feel like you're almost playing on their turf when you're even getting into that I think WordPress started that like at the end of the day you know like something that is inside a woman's body like something that like it is part of her it is connected to her like that's something that she should be able to decide what to do you know sort of litigating exactly what she's thinking is exactly what you're thinking and why she's making these decisions I agree I you have like if you were against abortion because of for whatever reason like great don't have one but you don't get to decide what another woman does with her body right but I do when I when they're talking and they're bringing up science and facts I do want to come back with the science and the facts behind what they're saying because morally and ethically I and ideologically like I'm like no of course not like you get to decide what happens to your body what happens to your unborn fetus of course yeah but also your facts are bullshit and all yeah and there's a refinery29 there's a I mentioned this really quickly at the end of the show there's a an article a column that says I carry my grief in a visible bump don't been abortion for women like me they thought it's a it's a woman who is pregnant and she's dealing with a child with a severe birth defect that will you know there's like a 99% chance that it'll be stillborn and she's still figuring out the realities of that situation until a late time and so she needs to have access to that medical procedure right based on on a very real reason and I think to your point for sure like to put more personal stories in front of people so they can understand that no no one's taking this decision like well it should I mean I agree with you that that's a great way to evoke like empathy and human emotion but at the same time it's like nobody is trying to take away rights of a man's like a man that a man has over his own body right you try to take away gun rights from people and they've flippin lose their shit but like okay let's just take a women's rights away from their own frickin body no gun control and no birth control no parental controls on my DVR I don't know I steamed my red dress
