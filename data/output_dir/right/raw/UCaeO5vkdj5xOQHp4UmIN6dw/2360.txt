upon us and before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet swirls</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,230
down into a fathomless an unnatural

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,900
72-hour darkness that will make the damn

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,210

<font color="#CCCCCC">past and review the events that make us</font>

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,590
all feel we're living in what used to be

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,630
the greatest country<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever to turn to</font>

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,460
ashes reeking with the fed of aroma of

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,130
insanity and corruption over the last

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,570
several days the choice that has been

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,800
set before us in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> upcoming</font>

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,520
clear and the differences between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

tripped climbing up a flight of stairs

21
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,860
causing some reporters to speculate that

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,170
her pure hunger for power had turned her

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,870
mind into a percolating worm-ridden soup

24
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,850
no longer capable of controlling the

25
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,980
actions of a body in which the soul had

26
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,989
been eaten to nothing by greed and evil

27
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,910
leaving the flesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> to begin the process</font>

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of decay even before the onset of death</font>

but instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of saying cities he</font>

for a woman's breasts revealing that

that Hillary had sold government favors

danced around the corpse with her arms

flung to the sky as she shrieked a

satanic incantation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that conjured a</font>

demon from the flaming bowels of the

finish his second term as president

Trump responded by putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on clown</font>

68
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,390
makeup but riding a unicycle in circles

69
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,459
around his podium until he fell<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the</font>

70
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,590
edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stage leading CNN to produce</font>

71
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,080
a five hour long documentary questioning

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,090
whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> businessman was as qualified</font>

73
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,040
as mrs. Clinton who had the experience

<font color="#CCCCCC">poise and good judgment to shoot a man</font>

75
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,790
in the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get away with it while</font>

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,370
simultaneously conjuring a demon as Wolf

77
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,650
Blitzer put it quote here's a woman who

78
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,959
can really multitask while Donald Trump

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,670
can't even ride a damned unicycle

80
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,370
unquote all in all I think every

81
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,410
patriotic Americans heart can take

82
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,510
encouragement from the fact that if the

83
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,130

85
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,330

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,770
when people gave it good reviews I have

160
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,840
to say I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say to be absolutely</font>

161
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,450
fair that Hillary Clinton did condemn

162
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that movie she did say it was despicable</font>

163
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,140
and a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and there was</font>

164
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,620
also Nicholson<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baker who is a prominent</font>

165
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,390
literary novelist he's one of those guys

166
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,220
that nobody reads but people like me he

167
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,050
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> a book called checkpoint in which</font>

168
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,540
they also discussed killing the

169
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,830
president I mean these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things were out</font>

170
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they was getting good reviews and</font>

171
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,430
again to be fair the New York Times did

172
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,930
call the book scummy they really went

173
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,850
after it and it was scum is I mean

174
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terrible sitting presidents so</font>

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,400
and and so Hilary has has earned the

176
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
right to strike back a trump which he

177
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,570
did so give us the Hillary content let

178
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,490
me say something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I think is a</font>

179
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,120
critical difference between my opponent

180
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,380
and myself words matter my friends

181
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,060
and if you are running to be President

182
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,130
or you are president of the United

183
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">States words can have tremendous</font>

184
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,020
consequences yesterday we witness the

185
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,190
latest in a long line of<font color="#E5E5E5"> casual comments</font>

186
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,720
from Donald Trump that crossed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font>

187
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,220
his casual cruelty to a gold star family

188
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,410
his casual suggestion that more

189
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,140
countries should have nuclear weapons

190
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,930
and now his casual inciting of violence

191
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,940
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these incidents</font>

192
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows us that Donald Trump simply does</font>

193
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,530
not have the temperament to be president

194
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,410
and commander and chief of the United

195
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's one side and this</font>

196
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,480
is Hillary's campaign now Donald<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump</font>

197
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,340
said something stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> never mind you</font>

198
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,230
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last eight years never mind my</font>

199
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,730
dishonesty never mind my corruption

200
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,290
never mind everything out Donald<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump</font>

201
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,090
said something stupid and Donald Trump

202
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,460
keeps giving her the material to run

203
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,870
that campaign so that's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

204
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,580
really well for her the polls show it

205
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,040
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one side that's one story ok</font>

206
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,870
the other story is of course this these

207
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,120
new emails that are released<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

208
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,770
Judicial Watch which is this

209
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,690
conservative watchdog group that just

210
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,960
keeps filing foi a reports that's all

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,520
they do Freedom of Information Act

212
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,190
reports requests give us these documents

213
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,460
give us these documents so this there's

214
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a double it not a triple whammy</font>

215
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,940
it's certainly a double whammy the

216
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,150
emails come out and they show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

217
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,190
you gave money to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton Foundation</font>

218
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,130
you got access to the State<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department</font>

219
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,320
through Hillary Clinton's aids so

220
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,210
Hillary Clinton<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in she's the</font>

221
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,830
secretary of state she made an agreement

222
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,740
with Obama because Obama remember Obama

223
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,190

people uses the IRS he's totally

226
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,580
politicized the Justice Department he's

227
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,030
used the FCC the<font color="#E5E5E5"> judge the judge just</font>

228
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,130
struck down the FCC trying to take

00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,650
control of people's Wi-Fi you know I

230
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,890
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tuft</font>

not money corrupt he is not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

234
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,850
money corrupt is a very special<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

235
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,280
you have to really really be a greedy

236
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,790
you know dirty person to be corrupt

237
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,840
Obama is an ideologue so he made an

238
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,310
agreement with Hillary Clinton yes you

239
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,310
can be Secretary of State but you've got

240
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,280
to separate the Clinton Foundation<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

241
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,130
slush fund from your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

242
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,720
Secretary of State now these emails come

243
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,480
out and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why this is why she had</font>

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,010
a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> server as I have been saying</font>

245
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,590
to you for over a year now the real dirt

246
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,590
is not whether she exposed some<font color="#E5E5E5"> spy in</font>

247
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,750
Iran though she<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have she might</font>

248
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done that but the real dirt is why</font>

249
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,280
did she do it in the first place why did

250
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,570
she do it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place we know it</font>

251
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,040
wasn't for convenience<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know it wasn't</font>

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,840
for all the reasons she said it was to

253
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,050
hide this pay-for-play arrangement that

254
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,060
she had with donors if you give her

255
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,080
enough money through the Clinton

256
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,940
Foundation if you pay bill enough to

257
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,590
make a speech<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you pay her enough to</font>

258
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,920
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> speech you got access plus you</font>

259
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
know not only that these are emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

260
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
show that the Department of Justice just

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
turned a blind eye to this they don't

262
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,470
have enough evidence we don't have

263
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,330
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence to you know prosecute</font>

264
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,920
any of this business<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Clinton</font>

265
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,020
Foundation so they are completely

266
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,600
complicit in this plus you know even

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">though Washington Post which has been</font>

268
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,440
relentlessly anti-trump relentlessly

269
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,470
one-sided they ran a story reminding

270
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,360
people first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all they pointed out</font>

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,830
that when Clinton<font color="#CCCCCC"> Senator in New York</font>

272
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,060
she promised that she was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

273
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,090
200,000 jobs to New York no way not even

274
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,490
close not i mean hard to find any jobs

275

that she brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to New York New York</font>

277
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,740
terrible shape she did nothing but in

278
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,300
the article they mentioned almost

279
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,310
offhandedly in the Senate Clinton

280
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,290
cultivated a mutually<font color="#CCCCCC"> beneficial</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wing center but I you know I know these</font>

348
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,970
guys they're just basically studying the

349
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,740
media the mainstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> media is reporting</font>

350
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,959
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentage of you know who covers</font>

351
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,990
what they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this Trump</font>

352
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,850
gaffe

353
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,649
and if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it was he's got this</font>

354
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,240
kind of offbeat sense of humor he

355
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,319
doesn't think and he doesn't think

356
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,680
before he talks this got four times the

357
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,959
coverage four times the coverage of

358
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,180
Hillary Clinton's emails here's Tim

359
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,209
Graham on talking to eric bolling on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fox</font>

360
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,880
from mr.c it's getting worse as we go

361
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,660
along and in particular CBS is really

362
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,550
standing out here because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have 14</font>

363
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,110
minutes on Trump 21 on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hillary so</font>

364
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,279
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really skewing the whole thing</font>

365
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,980
but it just shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a general election</font>

366
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,589
pattern that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have which is</font>

367
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,259
take whatever the gaff is like binders

368
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,110
full of women and completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> exaggerated</font>

369
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,839
it and hyper inflate it and with the

370
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Democrats it's like what story yeah so</font>

371
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,279
do you find it it's consistent along all

372
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,050
medium in other words broadcast medium

373
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,870
versus network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus cable yeah</font>

374
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,209
generally the pattern is is the same all

375
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,410
the way across<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's really</font>

376
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,360
interesting sometimes is when you think

377
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,430
that newspapers are going to be more in

378
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,000
depth and offer you more on some of

379
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,410
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hillary scandals and then once you</font>

380
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,029
find when you go back and you look at it

381
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:17,120
is no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for example the network's</font>

382
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,160
totally jumped all over kai zircon

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,839
network's ignored Patricia Smith you

385
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,759
look at the newspapers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find the same</font>

386
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,480
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to so</font>

387
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,310

389
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">very rare for New York Times because</font>

00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,339
of doing what we're going to talk about

00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that after the break we're going to have</font>

393
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,970
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> goodbye to you at Facebook and at</font>
