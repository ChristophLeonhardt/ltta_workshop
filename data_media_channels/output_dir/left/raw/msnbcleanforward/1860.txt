00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:02,595
THEY GAVE AWAY THEIR KIDS AND SAID CAN WE HAVE THEM BACK?

153
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:03,563
SAID CAN WE HAVE THEM BACK? NOW THERE’S NO PROCESS FOR THEM

154
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,798
NOW THERE’S NO PROCESS FOR THEM TO GET THEM BACK.

155
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,099
