1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,629
the health issue was a microcosm<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,899
problem she always has which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is she</font>

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,179
takes something relatively mundane that

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,519
can be explained with transparency and

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,470
turns it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a much bigger issue that</font>

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,410
sends her foes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the press into a</font>

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,150
frenzy because they feel they've been

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,039
misled or deceived and so it's a very

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">unhealthy symbiosis and you know health</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,640
is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive issue for all</font>

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,420
politicians none of them really like to

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,850
get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and say what's wrong and</font>

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,520
my brother was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a page a Capitol Hill</font>

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,340
page for JFK when JFK had his back

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,829
operation and he tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door</font>

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">for JFK because he was on crutches and</font>

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,539
JFK got really angry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to get</font>

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,300
him fired because politicians do not

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,730
like to be seen as weak and especially a

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,780
woman because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alt right is trying to</font>

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,020
paint her as like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wheat because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she's a</font>

22
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,430
woman and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why they've been</font>

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,619
pushing all these conspiracies about her

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,310
health but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is Hillary fell</font>

25
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,759
into a trap that's bad for her which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,100
Pete you know she just doesn't level

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,350
with people and so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,090
again this time she didn't level with

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,820
them about pneumonia which you know she

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,780
has amazing stamina really I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,610
book to her for two<font color="#CCCCCC"> days and I'm</font>

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,549
exhausted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's natural that she</font>

33
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,979
would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick but she just didn't admit</font>

34
00:01:37,979 --> 00:00:00,000
it
