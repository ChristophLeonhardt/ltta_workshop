oh yeah it's like the opening of firing line hey you know who uh Ben is actually really good at like doing whole songs with doing like the Brandenburg Concerto the bumblebees oh yeah are we live oh I'll write it I'll eat your crow I'm Michael Nolan you're watching Friday live we have lots to talk about this week including the weirdest music video I've ever seen like weirder than what's on that everybody makes fun of because they don't know the lyrics of it and it's from the 80s and then with the doves that sounds like a skank come on guys you're all too young in here to help me out it's not take on me it's another good one anyway so we'll get to ariana grande's you'll believe god is a looming song in just a moment boiler alert you won't believe God is a woman anyway welcome to that miss blasphemous and ridiculous full of witchcraft according to an article that Michael is a fan oh yeah yeah so but first we have to talk about last week we talked about how Scarlett Johansson dropped out of this role playing a transgender woman and in the what was it rub and tug cuz they're real clever out here in Hollywood folks and we asked you or is this mean that now acting has changed forever and the majority of the audience agrees with us that no this is ridiculous acting cannot change somebody brought up a good point I guess who was it Robert Downey jr. trolled this well they said in Tropic Thunder oh yeah thank you he literally heard my name or blackface and it was sort of ironic but you couldn't make that this today I mean this that was in 2008 that wasn't that long ago you couldn't do it today I mean he'd be run out of town on a rail he would and then somebody else brought up another famous movie where a Cuban played an Italian mob boss but I'm blinking well you mean an Italian played a Cuban mob boss and Al Pacino in Scarface there you go ha ha ha so I mean and people also said like isn't it acting like are you literally gonna get to the point where I said last week I mean the new movie with Sarah C Ronan in Robi I think it's Mary Queen of heart mayor clean of Scots yes Saoirse Ronan is playing Mary Queen of Scots she's Irish folks and Margot Robbie is Australian playing the British Queen so not allowed anymore I'll absolutely not allowed anymore but let's move on we have Dennis Rodman who Kanye wants to bring Kanye West and North Korea to sit down with Kim Jong here yeah this is basically peak 2018 I think I think we've now reached we're at the height of 2018 I love it I think it's great it's people have two different schools of thought when they when they read a headline like that you know Kanye wants Dennis Rodman to become the the mahdi of Iran or something I love that I get great joy out of that that's what that's what makes politics worth reading and paying attention to if Dennis Rodman weren't in politics why would I be watching there would just be a bunch of boring bureaucrats talking about marginal tax rates or something boring so apparently Dennis Rodman sent Kanye West a signed jersey and Kanye tweeted an Instagram about it and said that Dennis Rodman was one of his independent thinking heroes and Dennis said you're one I'm one let's go on a peace and love tour I think it's a great idea I want another I want at the next Putin summit in Washington DC I want Dennis Rodman and Kanye to have front-row seats oh I'll be paying attention you know what you know what Donald Trump could replace dan coats with Dennis right yeah no but I think you know I got to say the real advantage of these guys kind of these pop culture figures doing kind of crazy things is that people are paying attention and when people are paying attention I say this all the time president Trump is the greatest president for civics education in the history of the United States because people you know you've got Dennis Rodman jumping around over here so you're actually looking you're actually seeing what's going on okay all right so our Instagram poll question which everyone should go check out is should we send Kanye to North Korea like what could he do what would happen maybe it could be like the real interview movie and you'd end up killing Kim jong-un and the whole world would be better off he does he does have a lot of dragon energy so if anyone's gonna kill Kim jong-un it's gonna be mr. Yan Donald a rock in the dragon energy so now on to another pop culture thing this week of course our very own Benjamin matt walsh and michael knowles have lambasted is ariana grande's latest music video she's actually getting a lot of Sam hate for her new album in its entirety not so much for this song but people I think are really skeptical of her very rapid engagement to SNL commute and stand-up comedian star Pete Davidson and she the star is a little a little we're using that liberally I don't know I mean you start now the biggest fan of either of them although some of her music on the troll soundtrack is really catchy hashtag mom life yes my by of like actually 1 to 4 times uh he did a really funny interview I think with Jimmy Fallon where Jimmy was like yeah we're not just having you on because you're engaged Ariana Grande now and he shared these real-life stories about walking down the street in New York and men coming up to him be like man you're giving me hope because if you google Pete Davidson not the best looking up yeah yes no anyway so she's been getting some clap back from fans that said that she shouldn't have rushed into the engagement and shouldn't have named a song guys yeah no it was about Pete so but we are upset about the you'll believe God as a woman and I just watched the music video and I am beyond confused and weirded out and I feel like I need to take a shower now I totally get it it actually ariana grande has done this great thing which is proof Pat Robertson 100% correct one of the greatest quotes in all of politics I won't get it exactly right you've probably read it feminism is about convincing women to leave their families kill their babies practice witchcraft and become lesbians and he wrote this in 1992 in Iowa fundraising letter and Ariana Grande proved it all right because there's this thirty years later 30 years later she's done this video about God as a woman and all of the imagery in it there's a really good I don't usually read witchcraft literary criticisms there's a sexual witchcraft believing man yeah a male witch who's that who breaks down all of the like chakras free shot by shot of the witchcraft that is visible in this ariana grande and that's all there it's and there is this real occult aspect you know if you if you look at feminist slogans or you look at feminist art there is always this a cult aspect of the Divine Feminine and the in images mother mother or mother earthy vibe I didn't get the witchcraft vibe but then I read this article and that's why I'm like oh I need to go put some holy water on me or something no it's I need to have an exorcist up in here because there's no no the thing is there there are never accidental shots in works of art it's easy to write off all of Hollywood is a bunch of idiots but these are artists they do have artistic intuition see and I think this we were talking before the show in live was I actually don't know I you're an artist you like you're more creative you're an action all that stuff I'm like the Bible Belt homeschool chick that was a political geek my entire life so I have a hard time believing this article in its entirety because I don't know that a director would literally be that clever shot-for-shot to put all of these influences in an ariana grande top 40 music video I don't know I mean I do give them more credit but it also is the Breitbart thing it works both ways you know politics is downstream of culture and culture comes from the cult it's what we worship so even even just when feminists are using kind of cultural tropes of just feminist culture it does have a cultic aspect they come from the same thing so if they're using images like there's an image of the three-headed hellish dog of Cerberus or the image of the guards the underworld right they might just be using the image but the image has a representation too it's really because I like ariana grande I know I have to I've spent now a month making fun of soccer and now I have to turn in my masculinity part cuz I kind of like Ariana Grande but this is some pretty dark stuff I don't know I don't know where she's going in her career but doesn't seem like a great direction speaking of masculinity card Knowles thinks that you cannot be a nerd and a man so we're gonna debate that in a second but Comic Con is happening the big the original the og of Comic Cons is happening this weekend and today at Comic Con did you know that they are having an LGBTQ panel well of course I mean there's an LGBTQ everything now there I go to Starbucks I wonder the LGBTQ coffee so this specifically from the comic-con lineup website it's happening today right after we sign off of or it happened yesterday sorry at 11:00 at noon yesterday and it was founded or funded by boom studios and glad of course because blad has their hand in every that's related to entertainment and culture and all that is the gay it's a gay organization yep they all have such happy names it almost convinced me to well that's a no that's a story for another time never be mad or sad so they presented an in-depth roundtable discussion about LGBTQ representation in pop culture and the path forward to a brighter more inclusive future with special guests from all corners of the entertainment industry and it was entertainment is LGBTQ was the title of the panel well that that's been true for basically all of human history from the Greeks through who Broadway through Hollywood you know I don't think there's anything new about that they're just trying to come yeah they are and so this is a comic-con amount yes so this is what the superheroes and stuff yeah isn't that just a truism though isn't every every superhero is gay what are you talking they put on spandex would you leap around them I yeah oh yeah for sure you kidding black guy maybe not black I don't know it has a universe I'm sorry Marvel greater than DC I'm thinking I don't even know the difference I'm just thinking of Batman in the 1960s wearing that light gray spandex and hopping around with his you know little young boy a nubile young man attacking Adam West well not Adam West I'm attacking Batman with an Adam West who brought up yet like did Jacob bring up Adam West's almost James Bond yeah was he oh yeah can you and like I know that you wish you were James Bond I know I wish I were Adam West Adam I love Adam West but super by definition isn't it it's a little I'm just saying Supes Batman always looked a little light in his loafers a little light on I bet you we have tons of daily wired fans that are headed down to comic-con there's a few people in the office my husband is how to donate today in really cool exhibits Bob's Burgers is doing like a pop-up Shake Shack there's all these exhibits like outside of comic-con the new Jack Ryan series with John from the office Jim Chris John Krasinski mm-hmm they have like a whole virtual reality thing that's happening that they're doing down there there's lots of cool stuff that happens at Comic Con it sounds great I think it's neat that nerd culture isn't just for us nerds anymore it's like mainstream culture but what do we mean by like look because I'm not saying bad to be a nerd and have like really specific interests I'm like a cigar nerd you know or I'm a sir but it depends where do you look I'm definitely not writing books nerd but I but it does depend on what because now like we always we talk about this a lot as conservatives every single movie that comes out as a superhero movie people who were adults without kids go and like wait in line for days rather than go see that then enjoy the ariana grande video know it because you know frankly because it teaches like truth justice and the American Way well it used to now it's truth justice and all that other stuff it's because at least they are on a grande stuff you're engaging with like serious thoughts and myths sacrifice friendship liberties there's this safety I mean all of these trends happen in comic books and comic book baby but they're for children that's the trouble is you know you like it's good to engage lots of like it was a lot of dark stuff into the Bible is a lot more in common with that ariana grande video than with Superman so we're not true it's like the whole office gets very angry lord have mercy you guys should write in all of your hatred for Michael Knowles my next conversation is also with him so you should become a subscriber just so you know that's right yeah that's freaking a question yeah I can explain to you why these superhero movies are oversaturated that a buff just shut up Thanks so but our question we don't want you guys to shut up we want your feedback and we want you to tell us that I am right and Michael is wrong that's my favorite thing ever anyway if you're going to comic-con let us know but the question this week that we want everyone's feedback is you know with this LGBTQ kind of strain and push not just in the comic book world Hollywood WXYZ which and they have made some characters gay now like they've rewritten them as gay characters but which comic book character do you think you already think without them writing it it's gay that makes sense all of them can you select multiple or do you have to send in just one entry I would think it's Robin I would think it's Batman psychic Robin yeah there are multiple why it's that other oh my goodness gracious yeah is really in dollars into all I like the nerd that I read about the Easter eggs and I like read the cliff notes versions and I talked to all the nerds in the office about it and I'd like to buy the t-shirts and stuff and go see the movies opening weekend but there are some people in this office folks that legitimately will get into our long debates at our team meetings about this but you know if anyone in that situation is gonna be a little more sexually explorative it's got to be Batman right cuz Robin is just confused young kid yeah it's been his own invites him into his mansion says come to my lair and let's try on costumes I mean he's the one leading the charge Robin he's just maybe he's a little confused he's rich he's bored here that's right this costume is a little BDSM II just say a lot of acronyms today a lot of glass before we go further down the drain folks we're gonna end today's Friday so send us your feedback on Instagram YouTube Facebook Twitter however you are watching and mocking us right now do it let us know that your answer to that question and we'll see you next week is BDSM the one where they boycott Israel is that what that is oh okay okay we're done all right thank you
