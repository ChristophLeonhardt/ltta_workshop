WILL BE THE OUTCOME.

28
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,510

THE NORMAL PROCESS.

32
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:53,415
SINCE SENATOR FEINSTEIN SAT ON

33
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,351
THOSE ALLEGATIONS WERE ABOUT SIX

34
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,786
WEEKS AND DROP THEM ON US AFTER

37
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,526

38
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,795
WERE NO RULES.

00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:10,299
HANDLED MUCH BETTER AND I THINK

43
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,402

00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:31,420
FOR IS TO HAVE THE PUBLIC KNOW

54
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,623
WHAT'S IN THOSE FBI THREE OH TWO

55
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,325
REPORTS.

56
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:37,226
YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD

57
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:37,793
ESTABLISH A PRECEDENT.

58
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,595
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A

59
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:40,396
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

60
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:42,198

63
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,205
ABOUT THEY GIVE YOU THE

64
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,206
THERAPIST NOTES?

65
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:52,241

ASK RACHEL MITCHELL TO ASK THE

69
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:01,217
QUESTIONS OF DR. FORD IS BECAUSE

70
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,084

QUESTIONS.

75
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,261
WE REALLY NEEDED TO HAVE ANSWERS

76
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,463
TO THE QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO

77
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:15,598
TEST HER STORY.

78
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,267
AS YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN NO

79
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:18,901

80
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:21,770
IN FACT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE SHE

81
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,639
HAS IDENTIFIED HAVE REFUTED HER

VERSION OF THE STORY.

83
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:28,644

>> Juan: SENATOR CORNYN, YOU

190
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:50,812
ARE A DIGNIFIED GUY.

191
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:51,612
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

192
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,115
YOU ARE ON A BRAWL HERE ON

193
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:55,183
"THE FIVE."

194
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:55,850
LET'S START THE BRAWL.

195
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:58,386
>> Dana: WE ONLY HAVE A

196
00:05:58,387 --> 00:05:58,720
MINUTE.

197
00:05:58,721 --> 00:05:59,821
>> Juan: POLITICIZATION OF THE

198
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,389
SUPREME COURT, I WOULD HOPE IT

199
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,790
WOULD CONCERN YOU.

200
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,625
BUT YOU REFUSED TO LOOK AT

201
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,093
MERRICK GARLAND.

202
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:06,995
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT.

203
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:09,764
NOW YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

204
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:13,034
DEMOCRATS ARE SO UPSET OVER THIS

205
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:13,735
PROCESS THAT'S PRODUCED JUDGE

206
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:14,969
KAVANAUGH, I WORRY THAT THE

207
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,805
COURT ITSELF IS GOING TO, LIKE

208
00:06:17,806 --> 00:06:19,607
SO MANY AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS,

209
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,843
ABSOLUTELY GO DOWN IN THE TRUST

210
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:23,778
FACTOR AMONG AMERICANS.

211
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:30,184
>> JUAN, SINCE THE BORK

212
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:31,185
HEARINGS, THOSE WARS HAVE

213
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:32,820
ESCALATED WITH THE NUCLEAR

214
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:35,022
OPTION BY HARRY REID TO PACK THE

215
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:35,790
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT.

216
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:36,691
UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS GOTTEN

217
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,391
WORSE AND WORSE.

218
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,493
I HOPE WE HAVE REACHED THE END

219
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,396
OF THAT AND WE CAN RETURN TO US

220
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:43,664
MORE DIGNIFIED PROCESS, BOTH TO

221
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,433
THE NOMINEE AND THAT WOULD

222
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,969
REFLECT WELL ON THE SENATE.

223
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,137
WE HAVE A LOT OF HARDBALL

224
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:50,471
PLAYED.

225
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,573
I THINK WE ARE REAPING THE

226
00:06:52,574 --> 00:06:52,940
WHIRLWIND.

227
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,210
>> Juan: I THINK BLOCKING, YOU

228
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:56,978
KNOW, MERRICK GARLAND JUST

229
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,014
STICKS IN SO MANY PEOPLE'S CROP.

230
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:01,182
A TWICE ELECTED PRESIDENT AND

231
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,550
YOU WON'T LET HIM BE CONSIDERED.

232
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:04,085
YOU MIGHT SAY KAVANAUGH WAS

233
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:05,853
UNFAIRLY TREATED BUT YOU

234
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:06,554
WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE MERRICK

235
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:08,656
GARLAND A CHANCE, A FAIR

236
00:07:08,657 --> 00:07:08,989
HEARING.

237
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,225
>> THIS IS THE BIDEN PRECEDENT.

238
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,993
HE SAID YOU DON'T CONFIRM A

239
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,829
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DURING A

240
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
PRESIDENTIAL YEAR.

241
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,564
IF HILLARY CLINTON HAD WON COME

242
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:17,998
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE

243
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,967
HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT MERRICK

244
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,570
GARLAND.

245
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,204
BECAUSE PEOPLE CHOSE

246
00:07:23,205 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE CHOSE
