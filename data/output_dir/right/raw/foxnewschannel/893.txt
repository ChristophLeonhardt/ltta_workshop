00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:08,837
MISSIONS.

OF GOLF IS THE UNITED STATES

13
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,585
GOLF ASSOCIATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE

14
00:00:23,585 --> 00:00:25,920
OFFICER MIKE DAVIS.

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,855
MIKE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

16
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:27,488
BEING HERE.

17
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:30,124
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST.

18
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:30,658
THIS IS THE TROPHY?

19
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:33,127
>> THIS HAS THE TROPHY THAT HAS

20
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,296
BEEN AROUND SINCE 1895.

21
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,497
>> THAT'S FANTASTIC.

22
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:37,899
TO HEAR THE CHEERS COMING FROM

23
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,300
THE GOLF COURSE, EVERYONE IS

24
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,703
TRYING TO MAKE THE CUT RIGHT

25
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:42,537
NOW.

26
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:45,607
THIS HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING TWO

27
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:46,975
DAYS.

28
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:50,979
THIS IS A TOUGH PLACE.

29
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,248
>> IT IS ONE OF THE FIVE

30
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,649
FOUNDING CLUBS OF THE USGA, AND

31
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,718
IT TRULY IS A GREAT TEST OF GOLF

32
00:00:56,718 --> 00:00:59,554
BUT IT WAS THE TALE OF REALLY

33
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:00,221
TWO DAYS.

34
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:01,522
YESTERDAY SOME OF THE HIGHEST

35
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,191
WINDS WE'VE EVER HAD AT

36
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:04,726
U.S. OPEN AND PLAYERS WERE JUST

37
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:05,459
HANGING ON.

38
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,062
YET TODAY, REALLY GOOD SCORING

39
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,063
FOR THE CONDITIONS.

40
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:10,498
VERY LIGHT WIND AND SOME SOFT

41
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:12,867
CONDITIONS AND THEY CAN GO LOW

42
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:13,635
WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

43
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,303
>> SO DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD

44
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:17,272
TO SET IT UP TOUGHER BECAUSE

45
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:18,473
LAST YEAR WAS 16 AND UNDER?

46
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:21,976
YOU DIDN'T GET TO 16 OTHER THIS

47
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:22,277
YEAR?

48
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:24,479
>> IN SO MANY CASES,

49
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,214
MOTHER NATURE HAS A BIG SEAT AT

50
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:27,782
THE TABLE.

51
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:29,517
LAST YEAR SHE WAS VERY CALM TO

52
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,219
THE PLAYERS BUT SHE'S DOING A

53
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,688
FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THIS YEAR.

54
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:35,857
I THINK IN SOME WAYS YOU TRY TO

55
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:38,793
SET THIS GOLF COURSE UP, AND ANY

56
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,495
U.S. OPEN GOLF COURSE, SO YOU

57
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,664
ARE TESTING EVERY ELEMENT OF THE

58
00:01:42,664 --> 00:01:43,665
PLAYER'S SKILL.

59
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,166
SO THE COURSE MANAGEMENT SKILLS,

60
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:49,437
EVEN THE ABILITY TO HANDLE THEIR

61
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,005
NERVES.

62
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,874
THIS IS A GREAT GOLF COURSE AND

63
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,043
A GREAT TEST OF GOLF.

64
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:58,947
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT GOLF AS

65
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:00,548
A GAME AND WHERE IT'S GOING?

66
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:03,217
>> VERY HEALTHY GAME.

67
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:03,952
WE HAVE MORE JUNIOR GOLFERS IN

68
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:08,256
THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER.

69
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,693
SO IN A SENSE, AND THE GAME IS

70
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,427
GLOWING GLOBALLY.

71
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:16,631
IT'S A GAME OF A LIFETIME, IT'S

72
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,599
LIKE OTHER SPORTSWEAR PLAYERS OF

73
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,668
DIFFERING ABILITY CAN PLAY ON AN

74
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:21,736
EQUITABLE BASIS THROUGH THE

75
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:22,837
HANDICAP SYSTEM.

76
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:25,206
BUT AT THE SAME TIME GOLF HAS

77
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:26,941
ITS CHALLENGES.

78
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:27,742
ONE THING THAT GOLF CONTINUES TO

79
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:33,314
FOCUS ON IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO

80
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:34,449
PLAY THE GAME.

81
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,351
THEN THERE ARE EVEN LONG-TERM

82
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:40,355
ISSUES, AND IT WILL BE A BIGGER

83
00:02:40,355 --> 00:02:43,858
ISSUE IN THE DECADES TO COME.

84
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,093
IT IS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM HEALTH

85
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,261
AND ENJOYMENT OF THE GAME FOR

86
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,629
ALL THOSE WHO PLAY AT.

87
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,431
>> Bret: FOR SOMEONE WHO

88
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,468
DOESN'T WATCH GOLF RELIGIOUSLY,

89
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:55,036
WHY SHOULD THEY WATCH THIS

90
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:55,370
WEEKEND?

91
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,607
>> THIS IS OUR NATION'S NATIONAL

92
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:00,041
CHAMPIONSHIP.

93
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,309
IT'S THE OLDEST CHAMPIONSHIP IN

94
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:05,913
THIS COUNTRY, IT'S BEEN AROUND

95
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:06,647
SINCE 1895.

96
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,384
THIS WEEK IS TRULY UNIQUE IN THE

97
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:11,285
SENSE THAT, THIS IS THE ULTIMATE

98
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:12,687
TEST OF GOLF.

99
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:13,788
THIS IS UNLIKE OTHER WEEKS OF

100
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,624
THE YEAR WHERE WE ARE TESTING

101
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:17,792
EVERY ELEMENT OF THE SHOTMAKING

102
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,826
SKILLS.

103
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,129
FOR WELL OVER A CENTURY, THESE

104
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,865
GOLFERS KNOW THAT THE U.S. OPEN

105
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:25,266
TOUGH TEST TO GOLF, BUT AT THE

106
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:26,667
END OF THE DAY WE WILL HAND OF

107
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:31,339
TROPHY OUT RIGHT HERE AND AT THE

108
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,841
JACK NICKLAUS GOLD MEDAL TO THE

109
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:34,842
LOW 72 HOLE SCORE.

110
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,844
I CAN PROMISE YOU, IT'S GOING TO

111
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:37,912
BE SOMEBODY THAT HAS WORKED

112
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:39,213
THEIR WAY AROUND THIS GOLF

113
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:41,749
COURSE AND DONE A GREAT JOB IN

114
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,451
TERMS OF THINKING THEIR WAY

115
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:43,785
THROUGH.

116
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:45,053
>> Bret: RIGHT NOW DUSTIN

117
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:49,824
JOHNSON IS LEADING.

118
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,492
HE HAS THESE GUYS THAT ARE

119
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,594
HITTING GARGANTUAN DISTANCES AND

120
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:55,063
IT'S CHANGING THE GAME?

121
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:58,066
>> THE GAME HAS EVOLVED.

122
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,767
IT HAS INNOVATED ITSELF.

123
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:00,868
WHEN WE PLAYED THIS CHAMPIONSHIP

124
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:03,438
WELL OVER 100 YEARS AGO IN 1896,

125
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,240
THE COURSE WAS ONLY 4400 YARDS.

126
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,843
NOW IT'S ABOUT 7400 YARDS.

127
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:11,079
COURSES HAVE HAD TO EXPAND OVER

128
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,680
THOSE PERIODS OF TIME, BUT

129
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,416
DISTANCE IS ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF

130
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:15,983
THE TEST.

131
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,119
YOU KNOW, IT'S YOUR ABILITY TO

132
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,855
BE ACCURATE WITH THE BALL,

133
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:23,057
DISTANCE CONTROL, YOUR ABILITY

134
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:26,027
TO WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE,

135
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:26,861
RECOVER.

136
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,630
AND ULTIMATELY, THINK YOU ARE

137
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,700
WAY AROUND THE GOLF COURSE.

138
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,472
>> BACK IN 1896, THAT WINTER GOT

139
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:46,114
A A FEW BLOCKS, BASICALLY $150.

140
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,850
AND IN FIRST PLACE THIS YEAR,

141
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,584
2.1.

142
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,919
SECOND PLACE GETS MORE THAN THE

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,490
2,000 FOR WINTER.

144
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,692
I'M >> I WONDER WHEN HE WAS

145
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,527
PLAYING, IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT

146
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:00,761
FROM AN INFLATIONARY -- SOMEHOW

147
00:05:00,761 --> 00:00:00,000
I DON'T THINK $150 WOULD EQUAL
