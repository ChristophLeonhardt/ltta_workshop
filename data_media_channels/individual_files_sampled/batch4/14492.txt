and NYU professor has done the unthinkable he's told the truth I was very happy to see some sanity coming from an NYU professor this week because we see a lot of crap coming from NYU I studied math there and I was double glad to hear came from my own backyard professor Michael wrecked and washed a facebook status in which he explained quote we're undergoing a MAOIs like cultural revolution the power of the corporate mass media corporate social media the Academy most of corporate America the deep state the shadow government and most of the legal apparatuses behind it his post went on to talk about anti Western anti individual and anti-christian monsters ravaging our cultural legacies and art and he ended by explaining that a major resurgence and counter-attack is necessary and necessary soon amazing and of course he's totally correct media censorship has been the norm in China ever since the rise of the Communists and Chairman Mao the government exercises total control over newspapers like the People's Daily and their national broadcaster ironically called CCTV President Li Jing pings government has spent time amending historical documents online and removing journal articles from the 50s that challenged the Communist Party commitment to the rule of law I studied abroad in China about ten years ago and I saw this myself young students there did not know their own history from before communism they just didn't know it it was totally wiped out of their history books and this is something that we're starting to see today a change in history rewriting history books and rewriting our culture whether it's through social media popular entertainment and television or through the educational system the far left is rewriting our history it is a systemic attack on Western identity and as Professor recktenwald says we must be the resurgence and counter-attack so thank you professor for standing strong in the face of institutional bias if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
