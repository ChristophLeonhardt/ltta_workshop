Russian military has announced that Syria has been completely liberated from Islamic state terrorists artis crowd gasps dev has the latest the so-called Islamic state of Syria and Iraq is a state no more for all intents and purposes says the Russian Defense Ministry it has been destroyed as a faction there are still hotspots and isolated pockets Vladimir Putin added but with the liberation of the west bank of the Euphrates River Isis has done 799 days after Russia got involved in September 2015 when Isis was arguably at its peak when the Russian operation began Isis held more territory in Syria than any other faction two years and a few months on the Caliphate has been reduced to clumps of villages and uninhabited desert wasn't the Russian Air Force alone that did this the us-led coalition also played a huge part we've been covering the Syrian civil war in depth before Isis even had its name the four jihadists hijacked the rebels cause here are some of the more memorable moments filmed by my colleagues and I this is the air base in Latakia from which Russian jets are launching their sorties against Islamic state targets here in Syria the pilots are ready to go at a moment's notice it's quite incredible to be standing here in the pearl of the desert the ancient city of Palmyra that the months people around the wild fed will be reduced to dust in this amphitheatre laid down by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago that Isis staged one of its sickest massacres the Russian military considers it the crowning jewel of their operation here in Syria you can see here just some of the impressive military hardware that Isis have in their possession that has made the battle for Palmyra so tough we're extremely close to Isis positions less than two kilometres away whereas a syrian artillery position overlooking the industrial quarter of their resort the battle is said to be fierce isis fired back as we filmed shells began falling all around we ran but the syrian batteries kept firing life Indira's or is still far from normal but at least they won't be starving to death anymore ultimately it wasn't russian who are american jets that played the decisive role in this this victory belongs to the Syrians a thousands and thousands who fought and died to defeat Isis those who stood up to jihadists even when it seemed nothing could stop them unfortunately it's unlikely that this will end here many isis fighters have escaped oh god on the ground there sleeper cells will terrorize the world for years to come but now they'll no longer have their Caliphate to fight for with Russia saying ISIL has been essentially driven out of Syria there is still the question of what to do with the group's remaining fighters in neighboring countries including Iraq from their RTZ eager ton of reports Russia has effectively expressed its outright willingness to join the us-led coalition against Isis or the very same coalition that has been conducting airstrikes against terrorists both in Syria and Iraq now of course Russia is yet to hear back from Washington on this but Donald Trump has already made a statement and a rather peculiar one in relation to the Russia's announcement today the US president has praised the the fact that quote ISIL has been knocked out of Syria and knocked out of Iraq and just geographically speaking this may leave one wondering where ISIL has been knocked out too because I still can't really flee to say Saudi Arabia or to Iran or to Jordan I still only flees either from Iraq to Syria or vice versa and we've already seen such cases for example when Washington was pounding ISIL in Mosul they ran over the border and became a pain in the neck for both Russian and Syrian forces and now with Moscow and Damascus giving ISIL a pounding well their only escape route is back to Iraq or just to the border and so this I should say fluid situation kinda stresses the fact stresses the need of cooperation between the two militaries between the Russian and the US military but there is no love lost between them really the relationship was already very strained as the Russian announcement about the almost fall about the de facto victory over ISIL in Syria has already seen some disagreement as the Pentagon has said that they choose to respectfully disagree with the Russians and the Russians have the Russian military has responded with concern that this is just pretext to leave the u.s. forces on the ground in Syria even after the operation even after the victory over ISIL it'll be really interesting to see how all of this unfold especially with the US State Secretary Rex Tillerson meeting the Russian top diplomat Sergei Lavrov on Thursday in Vienna I've an eland a senior fellow and a director of the center on peace and liberty gave us his thoughts on what is next for Syria following isil's defeat there's always a question of who is going to you know occupy the lands that I saw that are had had occupied before after they were defeated and I think the u.s. always has trouble leaving theatres of war and troops still in Korea you know almost 70 years after the war ended there and we see troops still in Europe after the Cold War is over so I think III predicted that they prove the u.s. would probably stay around in Syria and with the help of the Kurds of course and so they don't want to give the that that territory back to Assad the Assad regime in Syria
