For years, China had been a global growth driver,
but that changed in the summer of 2015,
as a surprise devaluation of the yuan,
China’s currency, hit global markets.
Their shifting currency policy
caused uncertainty for global policymakers,
so we decided to answer the big question
on everyone’s mind:
How does China set its exchange rate?
To navigate the secrecy of the Chinese government,
I had to get creative.
I started with state-owned enterprises,
which often have big sway over policy.
I persuaded executives to talk to me,
which opened the door to government advisors
and eventually to party officials.
Based on interviews
with dozens of experts and insiders,
we offered a behind-the-scenes look
at the complex interests affecting China’s central bank.
Ultimately,
we showed how China’s long-term goals
of a more global role for the yuan
was balanced against short-term financial pressures
across various industries,
a complex balancing act
on which China’s economic future depended.
Global affairs for decades to come
will depend on how China manages that scale,
and I look forward to covering all of it.
