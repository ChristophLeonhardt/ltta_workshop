1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:05,590
FORMER REPRESENTATIVE JACK
KINGSTON WAS ON CNN.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:27,700
I'M NOT SURE HE PICKED THE RIGHT
SHOW TO PULL THIS MANEUVER.

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,880
I WOULD THINK THE STUDENTS HAD
PRETTY GOOD ROUNDS TO BE UPSET

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,350
AND PRETTY GOOD MOTIVATION TO

5
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,530
ORGANIZE.

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:47,930
THIS IS THE GUY WHO WAS OFTEN
CALLED A MODERATE REPUBLICAN.

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,030
LET'S SEE IF THAT IS THE CASE.

8
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,030
WATCH.

9
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,179
YOU ARE SERIOUS YOU THINK
THESE KIDS ARE NOT ACTING ON

10
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,370
THEIR OWN VOLITION?

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,129
ALLISON, I THINK IT'S A
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND I'M

12
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,770
HEARTBROKEN THAT YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS AND I

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,940
HOPE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN, BUT
I ALSO KNOW THEIR SORROW CAN

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:10,780
VERY EASILY BE HIJACKED BY LEFT
WING GROUPS WHO HAVE AN AGENDA.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:17,750
LET'S ASK OURSELVES DO WE REALLY
THINK 17-YEAR-OLDS ON THEIR OWN

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,620
ARE GOING TO PLAN A NATIONWIDE

17
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,220
RALLY?

18
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,860
I WOULD SAY TO YOU VERY PLAINLY
THAT ORGANIZE GROUPS THAT ARE

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,220
OUT THERE LIKE GEORGE SOROS ARE
ALWAYS READY TO TAKE THE

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,130
CHARGE AND IT IS KIND OF LIKE
INSTANT RALLY, INSTANT PROTEST.

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,360
SO WHO WOULD LOOK AT THIS
MASSACRE AND SAY REALLY?

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
THESE

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,220
KIDS HIS OTHER BEST FRIENDS
MURDERED IN FRONT OF THEM WOULD

24
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,270
BE MOTIVATED TO PULL OFF A
RALLY?

25
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,950
WHO WOULD BE THAT DEEPLY

26
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,950
CYNICAL?

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:02:02,350
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, IT IS THE HARDEST

28
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,990
THING IN THE WORLD IS TO ESCAPE
YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A

29
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,310
REPUBLICAN PERSPECTIVE EVERY
RALLY IS FINANCED BY SOME

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,990
OUTSIDE BILLIONAIRE OR
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION.

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:24,100
EVERY MOVEMENT IS FINANCED BY
THEM.

32
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:40,270
SO JACK KINGSTON NORMALLY
PROJECTS.

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:47,580
WHEN THE TEA PARTY HAPPENING
THEIR ORIGINAL RALLY WAS THE

34
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,390
BAILOUTS.

35
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:57,530
THAT IS ACTUALLY A RALLYING CRY
TOTALLY A LOT OF LIBERALS AND

36
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:05,000
PROGRESSIVES WOULD JOIN IF
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE ABOUT.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,760
THEY NEVER DID A SINGLE PROTEST
ABOUT WALL STREET.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,819
BECAUSE GIANT BUSES PULLED UP.

39
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:21,040
KOCH BROTHERS PULLED UP BUSES
THAT ARTIE HAD PAINTINGS

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:38,040
AGAINST OBAMA CARE PUT
ONTO 

41
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,640
THE BUSES.

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,860
SINCE THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS DO
JACK KINGSTON THINKS THE

43
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,519
DEMOCRATS MUST DO THE SAME.

44
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,950
THESE KIDS ACTUALLY SAW THEIR
FRIENDS GET KILLED AND ALLISON

45
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,950
WILL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ANYWAY.

46
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:11,150
I'M SORRY I HAVE TO CORRECT
YOU, I WAS DOWN THERE AND TALK

47
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,630
TO THOSE KIDS.

48
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,170
THESE KIDS WERE WILDLY
MOTIVATED.

49
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,079
I TALKED TO THESE KIDS BEFORE
THEY KNEW THE BODY COUNT OF HOW

50
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,349
MANY OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD
BEEN KILLED.

51
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:23,809
NO ONE HAD TALKED TO THEM YET.

52
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:27,499
THEY HAD NOT BEEN INDOCTRINATED
BY SOME LEFT RING GROUP.

53
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:32,680
THEY WERE MOTIVATED FROM WHAT
THEY SAW AND WHAT THEY ENDURED.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,130
ALLISON,
I DON'T DOUBT THEIR SINCERITY.

55
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,479
YES YOU DO.

56
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,379
I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THESE
CHILDREN ARE HEARTBROKEN, BUT I

57
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,539
ALSO KNOW THEY PROBABLY DO NOT
HAVE THE LOGISTICAL ABILITY TO

58
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,069
PLAN A NATIONWIDE RALLY WITHOUT
IT BEING HIJACKED BY GROUPS

59
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:51,849
ALREADY HAVE THE PRE-EXISTING
ANTI-GUN AGENDA.

60
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:53,069
JACK, IS JUST SILLY.

61
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,639
THEY ARE ON BUSES GOING TO THE
STATE LEGISLATURE TODAY.

62
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,870
THEY ARE 17 YEARS OLD THEY CAN
FIGURE THIS OUT.

63
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,350
I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME
BELIEVING IT.

64
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,350
SEE.

65
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,830
HE HAS A HARD TIME
BELIEVING THEY HAD MONEY FOR THE

66
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,520
BUS BECAUSE WHENEVER THEY DO A
RALLY SOMEBODY ALREADY PROVIDES

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,580
THE BUS AND IT WAS ONE OF
THEIR DONORS.

68
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,439
THE REALITY IS KIDS ARE DOING
FUNDRAISING RIGHT NOW.

69
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,240
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAPPY TO
GIVE THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,460
ARE OUTRAGED BY WHAT HAPPENED.

71
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:34,559
OF COURSE IT IS THE REPUBLICAN
IDEA OF 

72
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,940
THE YOUNG.

73
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:45,819
MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT WAS
THEM SAYING JACK.

74
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:53,490
NOW FINALLY LET THE KIDS
RESPOND.

75
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,279
I THINK IT'S VERY DESPICABLE
THAT HE WOULD EVEN HAVE THE

76
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,599
AUDACITY TO SAY THAT.

77
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,979
YOUNG PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY AND OVER THE WORLD

78
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,800
SHOULD FEEL THEY HAVE THE POWER
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT ESPECIALLY

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,539
IN THE WAKE OF THE TRAGEDY WE
REALLY SHOW WHO WE TRULY ARE.

80
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,050
TO SAY THAT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE
YOUNG WE CAN'T MAKE A

81
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:28,460
DIFFERENCE IS NOT RIGHT AND HE
SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

82
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:40,240
THE REASON WHY 
IS BECAUSE

83
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,449
THERE IS THE MERCER'S OR

84
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:51,259
INCREDIBLY RICH DONORS WHO WOULD
LIKE TAX CUTS AND DEREGULATION.

85
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:57,699
SO THAT IS WHY THEY NATURALLY
THINK THEY MUST BE LIKEWISE.

86
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,460
I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU THERE ARE
ACTUAL CITIZENS IN THIS

87
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,020
COUNTRY WHO CARE ABOUT THINGS.

88
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,520
THEY DON'T NEED A BILLIONAIRE TO
TELL YOU THEY CARE.

89
00:07:05,520 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY ACTUALLY CARE AND
ACTUALLY WHAT ACTION.
