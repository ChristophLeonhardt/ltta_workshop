A STORY OUT OF THE NEW YORK
TIMES EXPLAINING HOW NOW TO
BE FAIR, BUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT
REPUBLICANS ARE ANGLING TO
RUN IN 2020.
WAIT A
MINUTE, THERE IS A REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENT HE WOULD BE UP FOR A
SECOND TERM IN 2020.
THEY ARE LIKE, SURE.
SURE HE
WILL STILL BE THERE AND RUNNING.
HE WILL BE UNOPPOSED, OF COURSE.
NOW LET'S GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.
AS YOU CAN TELL, IT ALSO
INVOLVES HIS OWN VICE PRESIDENT.
WHO ARE THE PLAYERS HERE?
SENATORS TOM COTTON AND BEEN
SASSE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TO
IOWA THIS YEAR.
GOVERNOR JOHN CASE AGAINST
HIRING A RETURN VISIT TO
NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND MIKE PENCE'S
SCHEDULE IS SO FULL OF POLITICAL
EVENTS THAT REPUBLICAN STROKE
THAT HE IS ACTING MORE LIKE
A SECOND TERM VICE PRESIDENT
HOPING TO CLEAR THE FIELD
THEN A NUMBER TWO SWORN IN JUST
A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS AGO.
IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH
POLITICS, GOING TO IOWA IS
A TALE TELL SIGN THAT YOU ARE
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
YOU DON'T RANDOMLY GO TO IOWA
WHICH IS THE FIRST STATE TO
HAVE A CAUCUS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.
DID I WIND UP IN IOWA AND NEW
HAMPSHIRE?
WHAT FUN TO RANDOM STATES THAT I
WENT TO AS A SENATOR.
NO, THAT MEANS YOU'RE RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT THAT NOT EVERY
TIME, BUT MOST OF THE TIME AND
CERTAINLY, IT IS A WAY TO
DIP YOUR TOE IN AND TEST THE
WATER.
HOW MY RECEIVED IN IOWA NEW
HAMPSHIRE?
THEY'RE NOT RANDOMLY GOING TO
ALASKA AND NEBRASKA BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR
US TO CONTEST IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE DO.
TOM COTTON, ICU, BROTHER.
TIMECARD WHO WAS LIKE TRUMP,
SURE, FIND OUT WHAT IS
GOING ON IN IOWA?
HAVE TO GET OVER THERE.
AT LEAST SASSE HAS HONESTY TO
ADMIT THAT HE IS OPPOSING
TRUMP ON MANY ISSUES AND KASICH
HAS BEEN VERY BLUNT ABOUT
IT SO THERE IS NO ISSUE AT
ALL.
KASICH RAN AGAINST HIM, DIDN'T
SUPPORT HIM, DIDN'T SUPPORT
THE PROPOSAL THAT IS A DIFFERENT
VIEW ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
A CONSERVATIVE, SO HE IS DOING
THIS IN PLAIN SIGHT.
SIGNPOST NUMBER TWO IS DONORS,
WHERE THE MONEY AT?
SHOW ME THE MONEY.
YOU CAN CLAIM THAT YOU ARE
RAISING FOR YOUR OWN SENATE
CANDIDACY.
I DONíT KNOW WHAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT WOULD BE RAISING
FOR THE FIRST TIME?
DID YOU KNOW THAT MIKE PENCE HAS
HIS OWN PAC, WE WILL GET
TO IT, AND IT HAS RAISED MORE
MONEY THAN TRUMPíS PAC.
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT A LITTLE
MORE OBVIOUS?
THERE IS NO CAMPAIGN FOR THE
VICE PRESIDENCY THAT WOULD
COME UP IN A REELECTION.
IF IT WAS THE SECOND TERM, THE
VICE PRESIDENT IS LIKELY TO
RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IT MAKES A
LOT OF SENSE.
AND THE FIRST TERM THAT IS
GOING, JUST IN CASE.
LINDSAY WALTER, A WHITE HOUSE
SPOKESPERSON SAYS -
BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE WHITE
HOUSE NOT DENYING THE STORY.
BUT IS SAYING THE STORY IS TRUE,
BUT THEY BETTER WATCH THEMSELVES
BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG IN IOWA
AND WE WILL KICK THEIR ASS.
INTERESTING.
JOHN MCCAIN IS ASKED ABOUT IT,
AND HE SAYS, I LOVE THIS QUOTE ñ
IN 
OTHER WORDS, THEY ARE GOING
TO CUT YOU IF THEY THINK
YOU WILL BE, ESPECIALLY
REPUBLICANS.
NOW LET'S GO TO KASICH.
SO CASEY, IPOD MENU.
HE IS BEING HONEST ABOUT IT.
THAT'S ALL, HE PROBABLY WILL RUN
AGAINST TRUMP.
HAVE AT IT.
THE DUPLICITOUS
ONES OF INTERESTING ONES,
ESPECIALLY MIKE PENCE.
THE NEW YORK TIMES CONTINUES ñ
TO BE FAIR IT'S IF TRUMP DOESN'T
RUN BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF
PLANS.
YOU DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT
TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IN THE
OFFICE AT THE TIME OR THAT HE
IS GOING TO BE IN GOOD ENOUGH
SHAPE TO SEEK REELECTION WHICH
IS A VERY LOW BAR.
YOU DON'T PUT TOGETHER THIS
COMMITTEE AND GET ALL THESE
FOLKS OF YOUR
INTERESTING IN RUNNING, BUT I
HAVE MORE.
WE SHOULD DO THIS IN PREVIOUS
WEEKS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY
SMART MOVE BY MIKE PENCE.
1, YOU GO ON TV WHICH TRUMP
WATCHES AND IN PERSON AND
SAY MISTER PRESIDENT, I BOW TO
YOU.
YOU ARE SO GREAT THAT ME?
RAISE MONEY BEHIND YOUR BACK AND
GOT IOWA AND THESE EVENTS?
AND OTHERS ON MY RUN?
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
I BOW TO YOU, MISTER PRESIDENT.
HE DOES THAT TO KEEP HIS JOB.
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENTRANCE
CONTROL ANYWAY, BUT IT IS
MY POLITICALLY TO KEEP THE
PRESIDENT HAPPY, PLUS, MORE
IMPORTANT, HE GETS TO TURN
AROUND OR SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO TRUMP, HE CAN GO TO THE
TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND GO, I WAS
BEHIND YOUR GUY
THE WHOLE TIME.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME
EMBARRASSING MYSELF ON NATIONAL
TV?
MR.
TRUMP, YOU ARE SO
RIGHT.
THIS IS THE GREATEST HONOR AND
PRIVILEGE OF MY LIFE TO
EVEN BE SEATED NEXT TO YOU.
IT IS CRAFTY, BUT LET'S GET YOU
MORE DETAILS IF YOU ARE NOT
CONVINCED.
THIS THING IS OVER.
YOU DON'T HIRE A POLITICAL
OPERATIVE WHO HAS NEVER
WORKED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED
IN RUNNING A POLITICAL RACE,
LET ALONE THE FACT THAT YOU
MADE HIM YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF.
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS THE
ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT.
HE'S NOT ALONE, TO BE FAIR.
LET'S GO TO NIKKI HALEY.
LOOK, YOU 
CAN SAY REPUBLICANS,
THEY MEET WITH DONORS
ALL THE TIME.
BUT AS U.N.
AMBASSADOR, WHAT DO DONORS
HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR JOB?
I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, FINE.
BUT YOU HIRED A
POLLSTER?
WHAT ARE YOU POLLING, THE
OPINIONS OF ZIMBABWE ON OUR
LATEST
RESOLUTION?
THERE'S NO REASON FOR A
POLITICAL POLLSTER TO BE ON
THE STAFF OF A U.N. AMBASSADOR.
THESE PEOPLE ARE BRAZINGLY
GOING OUT THERE AND GOING OF
COURSE WE'RE GOING TO RUN WHEN
THIS IMPLODES.
TURN ON THE TV.
CAN'T YOU SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN
EYES?
THIS KIND OF INSUBORDINATION
IS FASCINATING, AND TRUMP
USUALLY HATES THIS STUFF, BUT
AGAIN, YOU KNOW WHY THEY DO
THIS SO PUBLICLY AND OPENLY?
BECAUSE THEY THINK HE IS TOO
STUPID TO FIGURE IT OUT.
UNTIL THE NEW YORK TIMES
SPELLED OUT FOR HIM, IT WAS
PROBABLY TRUE.
OF COURSE, MIKE PENCE IS GOING
TO DENY IT.
HERE'S HIS DENIAL.
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS BRING FAMILY
INTO IT?
NO ONE CARE WHAT YOUR WIFE IS
DOING.
BUT ALWAYS THESE GUYS ARE
LIKE,
I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN.
MY FAMILY IS OFFENDED THAT YOU
HAVE POINTED OUT HOW MUCH
MONEY I'VE RAISED.
DID YOU RAISE THE MONEY OR
DIDN'T YOU?
FINALLY WE GO TO THAT DENIAL.
AND THEN HE WENT ON TO CALL THE
NEW YORK TIMES FAKE NEWS.
I KNOW, TRUMP WILL GIVE YOU A
NICE PAT ON THE HEAD FOR THAT,
BUT WHICH PART IS FAKE?
YOU CAN SAY, WELL, I DIDN'T
REALLY SAY THAT TO THE
DONORS AND MY ADVISORS DIDN'T
REALLY SAY THAT TO THE
DONORS, AND THAT WILL BE HARD TO
PROVE.
IT IS A LITTLE HE SAID, SHE
SAID, BUT DID YOU GO TO THE
DONORS?
YES.
DID YOU RAISE MORE MONEY THAN
TRUMP'S PAC AND DISCLOSED
DONORS?
YES BUT DID YOU GO TO THESE
EVENTS THAT LOOK LIKE CAMPAIGN
EVENTS?
THEY WENT TO THE PIG ROAST IN
IOWA.
THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON TO GO
THERE, IF YOU ARE PLANNING
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
WAS IT FALSE?
NO.
NOT FALSE.
ALL THAT STUFF IS TOTALLY TRUE.
SO IF YOU THINK KNOW, TRUMP IS
FINE.
THE MEDIA IS
MAKING IT ALL UP.
YOU SHOULD TELL PEOPLE IN HIS
ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER
REPUBLICAN SENATORS BECAUSE THEY
DON'T THINK HE IS FINE.
THEY THINK HE IS ALREADY
MORTALLY WOUNDED AND THEY
ARE PICKING AT HIS CARCASS.
