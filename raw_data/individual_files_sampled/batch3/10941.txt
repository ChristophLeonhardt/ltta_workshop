questions are being raised in the US over the treatment of celebrities who've made highly controversial public statements on Tuesday American actor Peter Fonda called for an act of extreme violence to be committed against president Trump's son but didn't face any real criticism over his remarks while for instance talk-show host was on a bar recently lost her job of a racist tweet with more details let's cross live to Samira Collins Samira good to see you could you talk us through the controversy and apparent discrepancy here here we have another case of liberal hypocrisy two very different cases with two very different outcomes first we have legendary actor Peter Fonda a staunch liberal who came under fire for a series of unhinged anti-trump tweets I in one of the tweets he said that Trump's twelve-year-old son should be kidnapped and given to pedophiles saying quote we should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles now this tweet prompted Baron Trump's mother First Lady Melania Trump to report fond at a secret service then Fonda deleted the tweet and apologized saying quote I tweeted something highly inappropriate and vulgar about the president and his family in response to the devastating images I was seeing on television now many conservatives are called for Fonda to be sacked but Sony Pictures while condemning Fonda's actions refused saying that they will not make any changes to the upcoming film saying that it would unfairly affect the quote filmmakers actors crew members and other creative talent that worked hard on the project so no punishment for liberal Fonda however when Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett an african-american Obama official saying quote Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby her TV sitcom was canceled many have pointed out that liberals ignored Roseanne vars racism until she crossed the Obama administration a saying that she has previously compared Muslims to Nazis and refer to supporters of Palestinians as quote Nazi helpers and most infamously when a university endorsed the boycott divestment sanctions movement Roseanne Barr called for the killing of all Jews on campus tweeting quote I hope all the Jews leave UC Davis and Bennett get snoot somehow this was all ignored but once her racism was geared towards the Obama administration that's when liberals drew a line but even after Barr apologized for the recent tweet it's been announced that her show will be relaunched without her the point is when we look at Fonda's case and Bars case why were the outcome so different well one is anti-trump and the other is pro Trump so it looks like we're witnessing a classic example of liberal hypocrisy
