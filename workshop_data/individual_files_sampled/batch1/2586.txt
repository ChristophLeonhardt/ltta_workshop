a relationship in which the partners are attracted to one another and have regular sex is really important because sex somehow makes all the other things easier to deal with sex becomes much more important when it's not going well it becomes it kind of becomes the destructive factor in a good relationship sex is about 25% of the the substance and in a bad relationship it's about 90% personality shared values all those other things are way more important in a relationship where sex is just working fine this physical component of attractiveness and sexual engagement is huge it's hugely important it might sound superficial but I don't think you can do without it on the other hand you know you have to have somebody whose personality you know jives with your own in some ways complements your own someone who you genuinely like and respect I don't think you can do without that either
