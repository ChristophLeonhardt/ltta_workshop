you know it's not enough to get a great degree anymore you really have to go to a place that has the labor market in your industry and that isn't many places you know if you want to do finance you're going to New York you're going to London you're going to Hong Kong maybe you can go to Toronto if you're going to do media you know and and you're going to go to New York or London or maybe San Francisco if you're going to do movies and film and entertainment you're going to go to LA if you're going to go to music you're going to do New York or LA or London or Nashville so these job markets are very concentrated so the one thing I can say for sure when you're young when you don't have a family when you can cram you know 16 people in a rental apartment the amount of value-added you'll get to your career it almost dictates that you go to these places I think the question then becomes you know we make several big moves in our lives I wrote about this in a book called future city the first move is that movie after college where we position ourselves in a labor market the second move is not when we get married when we have kids and here I think what people tend to do is they tend if they're priced out of Manhattan over there print priced out of the center of San Francisco or Back Bay and blossom they tend to look first at the suburbs right they tend to say well you know I could get more space I can get a backyard they don't do enough of a search I think of looking at other cities you know does it make sense for me to go to Pittsburgh take a look at Detroit or should I head to a place like Atlanta or meeting afterwards so I think one thing I would encourage people at that stage once they've built the networking I met Peter Jackson a long time ago and I went to visit him in Wellington the great director and he said this he said I went to LA and establish a great film directing career I couldn't start off in Wellington New Zealand but once I had developed that network then I could move back to Wellington which I love I'm from but I could also create at a much lower cost a studio complex where I could attract global talent cuz Peter Jackson I'm making cool movies I can have a facility and I can track people so I think at that stage people need to be a little bit I would encourage people to be a little bit more all-encompassing and a little bit more strategic about their choice of where to live when they get a little bit old more established
