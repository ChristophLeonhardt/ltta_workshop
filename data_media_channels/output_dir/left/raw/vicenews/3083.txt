35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,930
hunting because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

36
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,620
is never to kill her owner if we were

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,860
allowed to sell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rhino home that we</font>

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,289
take off a live runner and leave it

39
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,709
alive no farmer would ever want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill</font>

40
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,440
her honor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I argue with my peers</font>

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,959
and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't kill the runner save</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

42
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,660
in its life you can take off 60 kilos of

43
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,120
horn you killing it for eight kilos

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say don't be mad we need</font>

45
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,860
cash to run our business what am I going

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,560
to do with your 60 kilos of horn in fact

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,170
it's a danger to me and my staff because

48
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,540
we can be add up we can be murdered for

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,150
that warm why would somebody want this

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,780
until about 30 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was not</font>

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,640
possible for a landowner<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own liners</font>

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,100
they then allowed private owners to have

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,700
runners and it was the price on the head

54
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,570
that made it viable for farmers to breed

55
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,630
them and it is now a huge industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

56
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,850
this country hunters will tell you that

57
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we hunt an animal it will never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,220
extinct because we'll just breed more

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,650
and more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a pretty</font>

60
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,140
bizarre world bizarre world and

61
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,260
unfortunately the Reiner is the sufferer

62
00:03:21,780 --> 00:00:00,000
