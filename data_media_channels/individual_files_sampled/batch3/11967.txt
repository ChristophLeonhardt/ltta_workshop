well it is interesting to see how Trump and his his top advisors seem to be at odds with each other I don't know if his management style is to create chaos and see if some order comes from it or what in fact maybe his style but you saw last week a few days ago you saw John Bolton talking bringing up the issue of the Libya scenario I don't believe this was an accident this is the same John Bolton who just before he was confirmed as the president's national security advisor wrote an article encouraging the United States to have a first strike against North Korea I don't believe that he's changed his tune in just a couple of months so I'm not have him basically talking about Libya as a model for North Korea we know what happened to Libya as your reporter pointed out Libya voluntarily gave up its weapons and was overthrown nonetheless if that's not a red flag to the North Koreans I don't know what is and they did take it as a red flag they said John Bolton is not welcome here we don't want to we don't even want to talk to the south as long as this kind of nonsense is going on yeah I mean hence what happened last week that reaction we got from the North Korean side saying if you forces to give up nuclear weapons we're going to walk away from it but any person looking on at this not being party to what's going on behind these various camps closed doors you couldn't have even imagined meeting like this happening say five six months ago the Rockets flying over Japan etc so okay there's this great big u-turn what in the lead-up to that u-turn is what convinced the North Korean leader to go yeah I'll go along with this in fact I'll give up my nuclear weapons where there seems to be now coming out from all sides so much confusion and well actually no we didn't agree that was it all the problem go ahead yeah I mean where's all this confusion coming from you two thought they'd have actually quietly talked about this before the big announcements were made would you know well the problem is that Washington confuses the idea of negotiation with the idea of surrender the meeting for Trump and Kim in Singapore should have been the beginning of a dialogue of a process instead John bolt and others have laid down the law here's what you got to do I think Bolton said tell us where we should send our planes to pick up your stuff and take it away you know so it's the whole idea that you you immediately surrender and we give you they promises in the future of making you very very rich I mean if I were North Korea particularly watching at how the u.s. tore up the Iran agreement I would be if you have any mind at all you would be very very skeptical sauce the was North Korea ever taking this seriously do you think I mean knowing what or how the Trump administration behaves at the moment it seemed that some sincere talks with President moon of the South again it's we can only go what's reported but do you think behind this seems maybe the North isn't taking it as seriously as they should well I think III I don't think that is the case because I think the u.s. is essentially irrelevant to the solution of the Korea problem and that made one of the silver linings of the fact that the Trump administration seems to have no clue what it's doing the north and south are clearly moving ahead we saw the historic meeting on the border we saw up a talk to progress moon was elected to do exactly what he's trying to do and I think it's actually the u.s. the interventionist the neoconservatives who were isolating the u.s. and making us irrelevant which from her libertarian perspective is actually very good easily you I said but really going well out of South Korea it's never on the cards is it well things happened very quickly overnight who would have thought just before December of 1989 that the wall would come down these things do happen historic events do happen the antecedents are there they're planted we don't see them until it comes to fruition I think that the ball is in play with North and South Korea the u.s. is irrelevant at some point if a deal is made between the north and the south eventually the US will have to be asked to leave you
