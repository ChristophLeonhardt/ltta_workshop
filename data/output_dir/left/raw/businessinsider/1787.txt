00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,250
trained for this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well yeah you want</font>

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area basically our</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">training has been over the past decade</font>

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,110
plus we both had careers prior to

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,920
joining powers and becoming man tricks

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,409
which then became Tsar tacular so really

27
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,360
our experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> our training and</font>

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
performance background prior and over

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past decade right this particular</font>

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,840
skill of course that we can't train it

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,939
to a world record speed every time what

32
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:27,810
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing is we're gonna</font>

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,310
be flying around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna like look</font>

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,320
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a human flag getting spun on this</font>

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,439
rope but when I'm holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with sheer</font>

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,060
strength and he's putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all sorts</font>

37
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,310
of power into this rogue system to get

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,130
the speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> going we can't train it like</font>

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all the time because it completely</font>

40
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,820
wrecks us for our performances which is

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,920
what we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so the truth is we</font>

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,380
only train this<font color="#E5E5E5"> once in a great while so</font>

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,479
today when when we do it it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a great feat and something that</font>

45
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,080
doesn't happen often on this

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,260
once in a lifetime so now do you shrink

47
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,390
like what's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> training routine like</font>

48
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,790
and your first purchase have a lot of

49
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,490
her body strength yeah absolutely so we

50
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,289
both trained a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin trains more than</font>

51
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,910
I do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> motivate each other how did</font>

52
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">between we perform of quite often so in</font>

53
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,280
between performing we get in as much

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,560
training time with the company with

55
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,300
individual partners and with each other

56
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,690
as we can basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> less training now</font>

57
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,310
and more actually just rehearsals for

58
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,130
shows we do over 200 shows a year so

59
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,800
that is what keeps us bit and we because

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
what we're doing is sort of on the

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,610
extreme edges and capability we have to

62
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,500
save our energy reserves or the actual

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,870
performance so we spend our time in

64
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,580
rehearsals for those performances and

65
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,380
that is our training of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we do</font>

66
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,060
warm-ups and everything or<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do</font>

67
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,220
go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gym and yeah but mostly we're</font>

68
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,500
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our different acrobatic</font>

69
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,410
partners rhythms they become our human

70
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,420
barbells and dumbbells so to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

71
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,200
definitely that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

72
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,700
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the events that you could see</font>

73
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,290
during your performances so aside from

74
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,320
what your errand I have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills</font>

75
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,190
I mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> range of performances is its</font>

76
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,800
tremendous it can be anywhere from the

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">prince or prime minister</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a country to</font>

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,030
cancer camp for children to burlesque

79
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,760
and little clubs in the city so the

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,150
range is tremendous it goes it runs the

81
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,640
gamut we really perform all over the

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">place sometimes crowds for tens and tens</font>

83
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,050
of thousands or other times very small

84
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,030
private parties so it keeps it really

85
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,050
interesting we never know what we're

86
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,370
going to get whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a stadium full</font>

87
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,290
of people or a small private party

88
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,300
somewhere we also get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go all over</font>

89
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,220
which is pretty cool we've been in 70

90
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,660
countries at this point which

91
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,000
which is it's a nice way to travel the

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,350
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's for sure and get to meet</font>

93
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,240
cool and interesting people all over the

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,000
place and then in terms of our skill

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,040
sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron does a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

96
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">circuits apparatuses we're both multi</font>

99
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,860
ground ground skills based on the

100
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">theaters or where we are sometimes we</font>

101
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">have very little space so we have to go</font>

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all ground stuff so we have a lot of</font>

103
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,250
skills Aaron does Cyr wheel which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

104
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,079
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool apparatus it's a spinning</font>

107
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,140
from the Ringmaster's and all of the

ground acrobatics and body balancing and

110
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,420
hand-to-hand where we balance each other

111
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,970
in positions and like he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ariel is</font>

112
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,260
what we're most known for we have a

113
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,790
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> other specialties skills that are</font>

114
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,810
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool that they'll just happen</font>

119
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,130

120
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of our hand spins the world</font>

121
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,630
record for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most number of hands in</font>

122
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,440
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spanish web in 30 seconds now happy</font>

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,710
by during rehearsals or hide so here's

124
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we've tied it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we've tied</font>

125
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,770
and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that for our dog so it's</font>

126
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,200
the current record<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 52 which is</font>

127
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,190
legitimately really really

128
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,220
really really really hard and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

129
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,820
tied that in record in rehearsals so

130
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,650
today's the day we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break it</font>

131
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,280
to all right so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you guys kind</font>

132
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
of hang out for a second we're going to

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,190
talk to Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here he's going to</font>

134
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,780
be our judge for today how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drove</font>

135
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">backwards how are you thinking I'm so</font>

136
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited to be oh I'm so excited do I</font>

137
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,750
feel like I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

138
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,600
up there<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm fine right here</font>

139
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,480
Counting so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must witness oh I mean</font>

140
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,310
so many different attempts that people

141
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,260
are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for absolutely but this is so</font>

142
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,820
exciting because it's one of those

143
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,010
classic circus thing that everyone

144
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,370
recognizes but it's incredibly hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

145
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,190
break this record also current record 52

146
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,740
spins and that was set by Rebecca and

147
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,980
Donovan from the UK and USA in August of

148
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,460
2015 that's crazy they have broken this

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,740
record multiple times ticking up every

150
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,700
time 52 so now if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chad and Erin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

151
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,550
tie today are they considered like a

152
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,620
record<font color="#E5E5E5"> holder there's any better so if</font>

153
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,530
someone ties the number they officially

154
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,780
tie the record so they are cold record

155
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,760
orders there's still members of the

156
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,590
Guinness World Records family I would

157
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">love to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see them break the right way to</font>

158
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,530
I think so arguing so can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk us</font>

159
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,419
through the protocol like the process

160
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aleut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee so they'll have 30 seconds</font>

161
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,730
that's 30 seconds of me counting have 10

162
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,820
seconds to build up to speed dad's going

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me a verbal go that is when the</font>

164
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">time will start so as long as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't</font>

165
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,330
go over that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds it will be a</font>

166
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,520
valid attempt so he'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
five to six seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get up to speed</font>

168
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,270
give me the start then I'll start

169
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">counting they'll have 30 seconds I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

170
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,070
count it down and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give us the</font>

171
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,770
results depending on how the attempt

172
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,840
goes I may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and check the</font>

173
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,580
slo-mo video

174
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,289
just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure we got every spin</font>

175
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,720
accurately but it should be clean

176
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,909
attempt oh really 310 they could break

177
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,680
it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first attempt I hope they</font>

178
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,500
break it on the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> night breaking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

179
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,840
the first attempt also do I think so too

180
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,840
so now dad how high up are you actually

181
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,849
going to be good so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an 8 meter</font>

183
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,310
do have a safety loop on there but

184
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,689
truthfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm holding on with sheer</font>

185
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,639
strength and especially at this speed

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,500
errands going to be putting the power

187
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,650

and and and artwork goes into just that

281
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,110
what we just saw is like the culmination

282
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,300
of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and how much training</font>

283
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,690
its most people when they come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 810 years of solid training and</font>

288
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,780
then they work on ax which also takes

289
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,930
quite a long time so depends on the

290
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,240
skill I mean I'm every once in a while

291
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,310
when I'm teaching I have to turn to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

292
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,470
students and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I've been dancing and</font>

293
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,440

294
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,750

00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,720
gymnastics as a kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">up coming back here was kind of like</font>

302
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,990
trip down memory lane a little bit yeah

303
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,780
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's some i think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot</font>

304
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,990
of childhood fantasies have to do with

305
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,050
and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of movement and spinning</font>

306

and that's true happiness yes Lloyd I

307
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,860
did not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no but it also has to</font>
