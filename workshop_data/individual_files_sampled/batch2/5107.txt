they're talking about this blue wave I don't think so I don't think so Maxine Waters is leading the tale maxi she's a real beauty Maxine hey seriously low IQ person Maxine Waters she's leading the charge back with me on set Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi leader Pelosi what's her reaction to Donald Trump's attacks on your colleague he's afraid of Maxine in fact he's afraid of me he's afraid of the women who are gonna be coming into Congress he he talks about there's no place for racism and then he speaks that way it's really disgraceful it's disrespectful to Maxine of course to women to minorities but he's I'm always guided by our founders he pluribus unum from many one they couldn't imagine how many we would be or how different we would be but they knew we had to be one we had to try to unite he's such a divider and so he likes to make some statement and his tweet about no place for racism and engages in it constantly it's shameful before we went to a break I asked you about congressman Chris Collins of New York the Republican who was arrested yesterday he announced he's suspending his campaign is gonna try to get his name taken off the ballot cook Political Report put it as a likely Republican seat but who knows now that now that it's he's suspended his campaign I think we just showed yet that was a statement I thought it was a shot but he says Democrats are laser focused on taking back the house electing Nancy Pelosi speaker and then we and then launching impeachment proceedings against President Trump and then he goes on to talk about how he's suspending his campaign if the Democrats do take back the house how likely are you going to impeach the president when Democrats take the house we will seek the truth we will have the power of subpoena we want to get to the bottom of how the Russians undermined our elections we want to protect the integrity of our electoral system we have to know the truth the Republicans refuse to seek the truth by committee assignment by establishing an outside independent commission and the president of course counts house two to Putin rather than respecting the consensus of his own intelligence engine so we will seek the truth and where the truth takes us well then we'll see so you'll you'll seek the truth is that will that require you to wait until special counsel Bob Muller is done with his investigation or if the Democrats take back the house you first you will proceed accordingly well I think they're two different things so what is happening and we can't possibly know what's happening in that investigation and that won't be its own path but in terms of our ability as as the majority in the house then to investigate the disruption of our own elections that's a responsibility we have we have a responsibility for oversight of the executive branch not to protect the president as mr. Nunez says over who are there to protect the president know we're there as the first branch of government article 1 the legislative branch with our own responsibilities so I think that you will see a seeking of truth fact evidence and data truth and then we can make our decisions as we go forward now I said a couple of times if Democrats take back the majority you said when Democrats and the majority if the Democrats do take back the majority there they will be in need of a speaker Manukau and you are the you are the focal point of that discussion because you were Speaker of the House when Democrats took back control in officially in 2007 you were the first woman Speaker of the House now though NBC News has a story about all the Democrats who were running who are running for election this year they interviewed you you see if there are Democrats opposing Pelosi and these are the 51 people who were surveyed who are candidates 42 of them are not Democratic nominees nine of them Kumble one I mean why not if the Democrats take back the house give up the gavel well first of all let me just say this and I know NBC has been on a jag of this this is one of their priorities to undermine my prospects the speaker but putting that aside the I have not asked one person for a vote I haven't asked a candidate or an incumbent for a vote what's important and I know better than anybody how important it is for us to win this election because I see up close and personal what the Republicans and this president are doing I do not think our opponents should select the leaders of our party the Republicans are spending millions tens of millions of dollars against me because they're afraid of me because I out raise them and the political arena because I outsmart them at the negotiating table and because I'm a woman who is going to be a seat at that table and that for me is very important if Hillary Clinton had won and had the sat at the head of that table be different but I'm not yielding I'm not yielding that now I do believe that none of us is indispensable but I think I'm the best person for the job and I won't let the Republican ads which are just flooding these districts and I say the candidates do whatever you have to do just win baby I know one in five children America lives in property we must win this when the caucus decides it will decide whose name they will send to the floor of then only then after the election will I ask people for their support I would a zero in on something you said in that answer and that you said that it's part of the reason is because we're a woman and in doing my research your favorable rating among Democrats actually surprised me given given the scuttlebutt it's fifty five percent favorable rating among among Democrats in the latest Gallup poll your counterpart Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell his favorable rating is 48 percent among among Republicans neither of you nationally is terribly popular but you're more popular than he is you are about this about the same age do you think that the reason why there's so much focus on you in opposition to you is based on is based on your gender what first of all let me say there's a better poll than that it's three to one Democrats favor and within the party so my numbers are better than any of the other leaders but at that point you reference it but it's better than that but let me just say this I have made some very powerful enemies are challenging the fossil fuel industry in terms of clean air clean water food safety and the rest Wall Street with dodd-frank reform health care the bringing in all of the anti-government ideologues name any subject whether its environment whether its women's right to choose whether it's gun safety whether it's immigration fairness in the rest there's big money Oh labor rights too I named that there's big money that comes in against the role of government because many of them are anti governance and specifically to these issues so there's big money out there against me the more they make this point though the more money I raise if you see their letters their fundraising letters they said we have to stop her because she is just a a force of it is amassing the resources to win this election and that is what I will continue to do and they only help me when they go after me but you know what I'm the least important part of all this what's as important is what matters in people's lives and I tell the the candidates don't even mention Donald Trump it's not about him he's self-evident it's about your relationship to the constituents their financial security which is related to health care cost of prescription drugs cost of premiums Medicare and Medicaid pre-existing condition as a benefit it's about how they are not getting big raises in there pay even though we're giving big money to corporate America so it's about some natural stability and their families and they the public sees better than most other people in politics the connection between big money being an obstacle to big raises for them and lower cost for them so I've amassed a good array of very wealthy people who do not want to see me a speaker because I'm effective a final question do you foresee a situation or a possibility where you would decide not to see the speakership if Democrats were to win the majority in the middle again is at least its least important question of all with all due respect it's an NBC question I know because that's a jag you all are on what's important is that I'm staying focused on winning this election I'm not even thinking about what happens next because what is important to the country is that we take it back for the American people and that means winning the house for the Democrats and hopefully winning the Senate the governorships and all the rest so it's not important as to what happens about me after what's important is what happens at the polls and what that means in the lives of the American people but they're afraid they're afraid cause we're gonna have so many women coming in it's going to many more people of color I remind you that our house Democratic caucus is a majority women people of color and LGBTQ and that number will only increase when we win in this election that's frightening to some people in that country and with that leader Pelosi thank
