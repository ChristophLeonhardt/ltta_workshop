1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:03,259
(upbeat jazz music)

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,690
- [Interviewer] How do you run a meeting?

3
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,980
- I like to have a clear agenda,

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,890
know what we're trying to get done,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,140
and get it done as quickly
as possible and move on.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,780
- Listen more, talk less,

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,810
and be decisive when the time comes.

8
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:29,070
- Well prepared, pre-reads, and an agenda.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,500
- I don't have a desk,
we have an open table

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
with the entire management team sits there

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,110
which means people can walk up to us

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,700
but I like the interruptions,
I like people coming up

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,860
because those are unique
moments to interact with people

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,720
and learn things quickly, a
lot of five minute meetings.

15
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,210
- Collaborative, active
listening, dynamic tension.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,750
- To have a mixture of being on time

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:00,000
and having open discussion.
