- Thank you for taking my question.
This question's pretty much for anyone
who's opposed to abortion.
I'm going to use the
number that I always hear,
that Planned Parenthood has
aborted, is it 50 or 60 million?
-  All of them.
- You get my point, high number.
So my question is, so I am pro-choice,
and I think I've heard Ben
say that abortion is evil,
but my question is when
is it a necessary evil
for population control,
and my opinion is that
we're already at 325
million people right now,
I think wages are stagnant,
I think jobs are scarce,
because simply we are
overpopulated, so what is--
-  What statistic
can you provide to show
that wages are stagnant or
that we've run out of jobs?
-  I mean
people are struggling,
people are struggling,
and I'm seeing everyone--
- So you should kill a
whole lot of other people?
I'm not tracking your logic.
- Okay, so my question is
primarily do you guys think
we would better off with an
additional 60 million people
in this country right now
versus had we aborted them?
- Yeah, so there's this
other thing that happened
in the mid-20th century
where several million people
were killed in Europe,
and I think the world
would be better off with
them, what do you guys think?
- You can solve an awful lot
of problems by killing people.
It's kind of where you
sort of draw the line.
If you don't draw the
line at killing people,
you could solve the problem
of not liking your wife,
you could solve the problem
some guy has the job you want.
You could solve all those
problems by killing people.
The thing is though there are
seven million unfilled jobs
in this country, seven
million unfilled jobs,
so we could actually use some population,
and wages are actually not stagnating
because there are so many
transfers the money people have,
the value of the money people
have is so much further
than it used to be, a poor person today
is living at the level of a
middle-class person in the '80s,
which is not that long ago,
so we're actually doing
quite well in that regard,
but even if we weren't, I'm
not sure that killing people
is my first go-to.
- Malthusian Theory, Malthusian economics,
has basically been disproved
over the past 50 years.
Paul Ehrlich was one of the main exponents
of Malthusian population control theories.
He wrote a book called The Population Bomb
back in the 1960s in which he predicted
that within 15 years, there
would be mass starvation,
hundreds of millions of
people dying from starvation,
and in the mid '80s he made a bet
with another social
scientist named Julian Simon.
Julian Simon said to him
pick any five commodities,
any five, and tell me that
the price is going to go up,
meaning that we're going
to hit scarcity levels
because of overpopulation,
and Ehrlich picked five,
and Simon says I don't
care which five you pick,
the price will go down over
time because human ingenuity
is so much more powerful
than population forces.
Simon won the bet, Ehrlich lost the bet,
Ehrlich still teaches at Berkeley.
So it doesn't seem to matter who's right
and who's wrong in this particular debate,
the fact is that the
population now sustained
on planet Earth is well
over seven billion.
A century ago, it was significantly
less than half of that,
but we are now living more prosperously
across virtually every area of the world,
specifically because human
ingenuity is so grand and great,
and killing off incipient human life,
forget about the moral problem
of killing human beings,
killing off the creativity of 60 million
additional human beings
means killing our own future.
-  I used
to be in favor of abortion
when I was young and
irresponsible and stupid.
- Before we forced him into
marriage and childbearing.
- Forced into living more morally,
so I actually do see this point
and I remember the point at
which my mind was opened,
which is that one has to recognize,
without going into all
the moral questions,
that it is a human life, and as Drew said,
you can solve a lot of
problems by killing people,
so I'll give you the
question that Diana Shaw,
a bioethicist asked me, which is (laughs),
which is if you wanna
control economic problems
or political problems,
other than unborn babies,
which group of Americans
would you be willing to kill?
-  So, can you hear me?
-  Yes.
-  So I
think there's a significant
difference between a life
that hasn't been born
versus human lives that
are already living,
breathing, eating, et cetera.
-  So where's
your point of viability then?
If you're going to make
the viability argument,
where is your point of viability?
You recognize that it's a human.
- Most like, I'm not exactly
sure how I'm gonna answer.
- Are you a parent?
I think your opinion will
change when you become a parent.
I think your opinion
will change when you hear
the most beautiful sound
on the face of the planet
which is your child's heartbeat
when it is in your partner's womb.
I think your opinion will
change when a blood test
at eight weeks shows that
it is a boy or a girl,
and then you can come back to me
and try to make an argument
to kill a human being
because you are making a argument
to value one life more than another,
and I just don't think that's an argument
that's your right to make.
