disease and sorry sexual assault allegations have split a wedge between people however this time the split is between those on the left and this asks a very important question has the oppression hierarchy changed in their political lexicon and what does this mean for the hashtag me to movement I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood an article was published in babe magazine accusing aziz ansari of sexual assault and harassment and i'm not going to give you the details because of course according to left details no matter because the pillar of the political left and the me2 movement is every woman needs to be believed no matter what Hillary Clinton even said this so the facts in the details don't matter so these rules are perfectly understood and progressed by the political left why do we see a split in the social justice warriors some people coming out defending Aziz and others being furious that anyone would stand up defending him and the reason for this is the oppression hierarchy victim hierarchy or my very favorite the oppression Olympics as you've never heard these terms let me just explain them for you real quick if your entire ideology is based on Marxist I mean equality obviously not equality of opportunity but rather equality of outcome and since that is obviously impossible this also means you're fighting and battle constantly with some sort of outside force an oppressive force and for the left it's capitalism and cisgender white men and in this system your merit is based on how oppress you are in this overbearing system and because the left likes to push people into categories instead of treating them as an individual some people's beliefs or their struggles have to take a backseat to others thus the hierarchy well I still claim to be fighting for all let me explain you always here on the political left we were fighting against sexism Islamophobia transphobia and anti-semitism but that's not the case according to get behind Jews which only make up 2% of the American population are victims of over 50% of all hate crimes let me repeat that 50% of all recorded hate crimes something why does this group of oppressed minorities have to take a backseat to issues such as Islam and mass immigration from the Middle East I mean even in Hamas in its actual charter its bill of rights if you were it would calls for the eradication of all Jews I mean why don't the political left call out people like Hamas an elected group of people in the Middle East who in their very Charter say we're going to destroy all the Jews you want to eradicate all the Jews and when many political leaders in the least call for the exact same thing how come that is not criticize you can see another example this hierarchy with feminism in the lbgtq community but he got furious at Patricia Arnett to her speech for winning in the movie boyhood when she talked about now we need to move forward and promote feminism and equality for women everywhere and then in an interview afterwards spoke about how now the LGBTQ community has gotten gay rights and gay marriage and everything's equal then they should move over and start focusing on feminine issues for equality pay gap all this kind of stuff BuzzFeed ripped her up and down for this and she was widely criticized by the LGBTQ community for saying this LGBTQ feminism there's another great example of a hierarchy moving above another one in this community when you check out the black lives matter protest that shut down a gay pride parade LGBTQ black lives matter you also don't see the political left because of the hierarchy of oppression talking about the recent surveys in London fifty two percent of the hundred thousand Muslims surveyed thought that homosexuality should be illegal and thirty five percent thought that a man should have more than one wife I mean I thought this was all equal right like I thought they were protecting against my already classes like Jews gays women because it's a hierarchy and they're not high enough to dictate what the cause of the month is so why is it important talking about Aziz Ansari's allegations as well as the social justice hierarchy and the political left reaction to it well of all women should be believed now and Aziz is getting a pass by many on the left that would seem like a person of color and a Muslim to send me across the finish line for the others winning the oppression Olympics I believe this kind of ideology is so divisive and unproductive for society as a whole if your fundamental beliefs are that you should be able to think and say whatever you like without risk of being offensive or offending someone else if you believe that you should be free to choose whether you want to take part and celebrate someone else's lifestyle or be totally free to live that lifestyle out for yourself and we should be able to live our lives without government intervention and that we should be judged not by on our race class or gender but rather on merit and content of character then welcome to the political right because we do not care her you treat me good I'll treat you good don't live your life however you want just don't ask me to pay for it that is of course unless you like taking orders and getting a back seat from any class of people that is wearing the current oppression Olympics medal around their neck I'm Ben Davies this is
