government spending is as ludicrous as you would expect it to be more about that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel you know every so often I like to take a little inventory and just have an episode where we can hold our government accountable now I love our country but I hate our government I love our president but I hate the amount of corruption that surrounds him in Washington DC and so today I want to focus on government spending because I think that the way that our founding fathers structured our government with bicameral checks and balances and you know try and attempt to keep government small I just I think they would be rolling over in their graves if they saw the types of things that we are spending money on so I did a little bit of research found some some of the most egregious I think things that we are spending money on so I'm just gonna go through a few of those all right the US government spent seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars on a new soccer field for detainees at Gitmo at Guantanamo Bay the US government has spent a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars to determine if cocaine makes Japanese quail engage in sexually risky behavior it's very important don't you think the US government spent $200,000 on a tattoo removal program in Mission Hills California now I am assuming that pertains to rehabilitate rehabilitated gang members but still two hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money I think we've got something that we should be provided by the private sector charities things like that federal government shelled out three million dollars to researchers at the University of California at Irvine one of our many franchised education units to fund their research on videogames searches such as World of Warcraft now I don't actually mind this one too much because my downstairs is a video gamer and he plays games all night long and I would like to know if there's some type of link between world of warcraft and possibly schizophrenia and a tendency to be reclusive the Department of Health and Human Services plans to spend five hundred million dollars on a program that will among other things seek to solve the problem of five-year-old children that can't sit still in kindergarten classrooms really we need 500 million dollars to figure out why children are just rambunctious pretty sure that's just called being a child yeah four point six billion dollar payout for Fannie Mae thirteen different government agencies fund two hundred and nine different science technology engineering and math programs at STEM education one hundred and seventy three of those programs overlap with at least at least one other program so hello redundancy a total of six hundred and fifteen thousand dollars was given to the University of California at Santa Cruz you notice a theme here California yeah to digitize photos t-shirts and concert tickets belonging to the Grateful Dead yeah China lends us more money than any other foreign nation but that didn't stop our government from spending seventeen point eight million dollars on social and environmental programs for China tell me how that makes sense yeah the US Postal Service spent thirteen thousand five hundred dollars on a single dinner at Ruth's Chris I don't know about you but my mail lady sucks she's too lazy to bring a two-pound package up a couple flights of stairs I don't think she deserves any meal at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse a total of 1.8 million dollars was spent on a museum of neon signs in Las Vegas the federal government spends 25 billion dollars a year maintaining federal buildings that are either unused or totally vacant vacant I say sell to the private sector the US government handed one tennessee library felt $5,000 for the purpose of hosting a series of video game parties yellow I guess one professor at Dartmouth University was given a hundred and thirty-seven thousand dollars to create a recession themed video game entitled layoffs Wow I don't know maybe that's preparing Millennials for their future the US Department of Agriculture once shelled out 30,000 dollars to a group of farmers to develop a tourist-friendly database of farms that host guests for overnight hey K shion's not staycations or vacations hey k shion's so I guess that's for couples who meet on farmersonly.com and they want to have a little romp in the hay the National Institutes of Health paid researchers $400,000 to find out why gay men and Argentina engage in risky sexual behavior when they are drunk why does anyone engage in risky sexual behavior when they're drunk because they're drunk or they're hoes the feds once gave Alaska Airlines five hundred thousand dollars to paint a chinook salmon on the side of the Boeing 737 this year the Department of Defense approved a two hundred and eighty three thousand dollar grant to monitor day-to-day life of baby nap catchers in California because there are threatened species National Science Foundation studies whether or not TV pundits are responsible for media polarization they gave MIT four hundred thousand dollars to study this yeah I think we all know the results of that study the federal government paid 3.1 billion with AB e 3.1 billion dollars paid them out 3.1 billion dollars to federal employee employees placed on administrative leave often times for disciplinary reasons and we are paying them 3.1 billion dollars to go on administrative leave the National Endowment for the Arts Foundation spent $30,000 on a production of doggie Hamlet that's pretty much exactly what you would think it is except it's worse it's actors chasing dogs and sheep around a field in New Hampshire now why do I bring all this up because I was a little upset over the Trump omnibus bill that massive massive spending cap package that President Trump vowed to never never to do again so I will be holding him to that the House of Representatives has the power of the purse midterm elections coming up very very important that we retain the house and I hope that we get a speaker in there who will actually hold some people accountable shore up the purse strings tighten them tighten them tighten them somebody should probably tell me to do that with my credit cards but anyway that's my money not theirs so yeah so we can slash some of the spending because I like like I said earlier this is not what the founding fathers intended so thanks for watching everybody I hope this didn't enrage you too much I'm a man that had the Hollywood conservative for the road if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
