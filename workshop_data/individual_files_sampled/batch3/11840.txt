I'm joined in the studio by get builders Dutch politician and leader of the party for freedom welcome guests people who read the news and see get builders in Russia will they will jump to some conclusions have you met with President Putin will you meet with the president no no I have not I'm a simple parliamentarian I'm not an important minister or prime minister not yet but I saw my colleagues the chairman of the duma committee of foreign affairs mr. Slutsky but also today just because I came to your studio I met with the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs mr. yushka I held a speech before the University of Moscow where diplomats were trained and I used the venues that I had to send a message that we should engage we should not only talk about capabilities you know if you watch at the speech of mr. Putin yesterday in the duma it was all about new weaponry and capabilities and of course and i understand the nato will do exactly the same and this is how people react but we should start talking about intentions you know if you know anything about the world of security of intelligence you know that there are two things important it's the capabilities military capabilities but also the intentions you know you can have very small capabilities and with wrong intentions you can do a lot of harm you can have a lot of capabilities but with good intentions you can do almost no harm and people don't know the west and Russia we work on either side on building up more capabilities and we forget about talking about the intentions you know and I believe by visiting Russia and I hope that Russian parliamentarians that Russian ministers will come to Holland to any other country in the European Union and that parliamentary delegations will come here I mean it have been worst time in history where parliamentarians met and discussed with one another a lot of countries are very worried about being friendly with Russia I would say this is certain toxicity certainly in the press why would you like to see closer relations well because I believe Russia is not our enemy then I believe that we have so much in common I already told you that I believe we have long term relationships we have also we are bound by the same culture from 140 million Russians 100 million of the Russians are and Christian them so we share the same values when it comes to our identity we are patriotic countries as well we are the victims both of Islamic terrorism in the past and even today we have a lot of trade so I think there is so much that we both could benefit from better relations of course there was also a lot of problems between NATO of the European Union and Russia and I'm not saying that I want to ignore all that but I believe that has today that if you only shout at one another if you only build up the almost war rhetoric that at the end of the day you will not come any step further what do you think if flooding Mir Putin is a world leader well Vladimir Putin is a leader whatever you think of him and I criticize a lot of his policies but I applaud him as I applaud mr. Trump for being leaders that are standing there on behalf of the Russian and the American people as I said before this interview we lack that kind of leadership in Europe Europe being a nonentity countries combined almost 30 nowadays and still trying to enlarge whether is a total lack of common sense and identity and therefore I believe mr. Putin and mr. Trump and more favorable than our own leaders when it comes to them and policies also of course I have a lot of criticism when it comes to the amount of democracy and freedom of speech when it comes to the Crim when it comes to parts of the policy of in the Middle East when it comes to the relations with Iran when it comes to the mh17 where once again I hope that they would work and whoever is responsible work with Dutch authorities but still it's a country that we share a lot with that we have a lot of common interest that we I don't consider as an enemy there was a lot of enmity too much Amity Russia is not our enemy the Russian people are certainly not our enemy we should understand each other better work together and and not only talk in russophobia or in wartime talk and that is what is happening today it's it's a disgrace that our Minister of Foreign Affairs had to step down the day he planned to go to visit mr. Lavrov in Russia because he lied about being in a Dasha with mr. Putin and because he lied about the fact that mr. Putin she would have said that he wanted to have a greater Russia including a Kazakhstan even and Belarus and Ukraine and the Baltic states and he had to step down because it's all lies it was all russophobia fake news and that's not how it will work if we need Russia and America as an ally we should engage in responsible and adult conversation you mentioned Donald Trump and letting me put in a list took Donald Trump because the media is very dangerous to believe what you read and hear in the media often but they regularly compare you with Donald Trump do you see any similarities do you see big differences had your ideologies compare no maybe some of them speak about the hair I don't know whether that's true or not but now I'm not and to be compared with Donald Trump or anybody else not because it would be an insult or maybe a compliment but I'm my own man and I'm in politics much longer than a mr. Trump is in politics and with all respect to mr. Trump I don't need to look like him or anything else well ante that's the thing that people if you look at the policy he says America first and I don't want to have more immigration and I want the jobs for Americans instead of Mexicans or Chinese and I want fair trade deals instead of deals where the American people have to pay in some kind of development scheme for other countries and to have more economical growth so yes I support that I believe today in Europe we face even something worse than an economical problem we face what I call an existential problem because of all those open borders that we have and the invitations of leaders like Angela Merkel who sent me a chef honest we will make it come and to our society and for the last decades millions of people have come and they unfortunately not always assimilated it is a toxic combination to have open borders and no demands of assimilation or integration of foreigners in your own society I've nothing against the people I've nothing against Muslims but I know that if you look at the end of the century the United Nations predicts that will be an explosion of the demographics in Africa at the end of the centuries we'll go from 1 billion people to 4 billion people at the same time there will be a decrease of people in Europe and they also predicted one third of those four billion will leave Africa will come to Europe many of them would be with an Islamic background and unfortunately I believe that Islam is not there to assimilate people can assimilate but the Islamic ideology will not and Europe is not an Islamic entity either so this is what I also spoke about within the Duma and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the stability in the region and the stability in the Middle East on Africa how do we deal with mass immigration not only to David in the future is something that we have in common with Russia without Russia I believe in the future it will be very problematic to deal and to solve just a clarifier because you brought the you know the issue of Islam and immigration is it fundamentally just Islamic immigrants that you're against you're not opposed to just immigration on its own now today because of the immigration crisis of the last few years it's very difficult to have any more immigrants at all but we advocate my party advocates the stop of immigrants from non-western mostly Islamic countries and today those are indeed the majority huge majority of the asylum seekers or immigrants coming and to the Netherlands and to Western you so is this because you feel that they are harder to assimilate for them to join in and become part of that society but first most of them are not refugees I mean you have to make a distinction between asylum seekers and immigrants those are two separate groups and you saw that in the last few years to Europe millions of asylum seekers came who actually were no asylum seekers many of them travelled to five or six so-called safe countries before they entered Germany or Holland or the United Kingdom or any other country because of their big fat welfare state they did not stop at Bulgaria and it did not go to Lithuania either and still if people seek refugee if people are unsafe I believed it is a shelter whoever they are and whatever background they have but why not is it the case that today or in the last few years rich Arab countries Islamic countries like Gulf states or Saudi Arabia who have the same culture the same climate the same ideology or religion and who are not the poorest countries in the world why don't mean didn't they take in and some of the real refugees as well even though I'm against the more Islamic immigrants to Holland that that's not the same that by that by claiming that all those people are bad people that is not the case there are also many people in Holland from Islamic origin that have assimilated and integrated and are doing a very zero dije with some Muslims coming in to the Netherlands how do you get them to adapt to not be one of the problem isms I would propose to have no more immigrants from Islamic country in Holland today we already have in Holland out of the population of 70 million 1 million Muslims and we have a lot of problems with them already now over-representation in crime and social benefits the University of Amsterdam which actually is quite a left Asian liberal institution made a survey not so long ago that proved that 11 percent of the Muslims in Holland today which is 110,000 people said that they are willing to use violence in the Netherlands in the name of Islam it's twice the amount of the soldiers and the Dutch army people are not acting like it today but are willing to do that in the name of Islam so we have a huge problem so I would say no stop no more immigration from Islamic countries and for the people are already in our societies if you as many very luckily do and I am certainly the first one to admit if you abide by our laws by our Constitution by our values you are not only welcome to stay but you are equal as anybody else and we wish you the best life for you and your children and your family but if you don't if you cross the red line that is called the Dutch law that is called our Constitution if you start acting according to Sharia law and another survey if you don't mind telling you said that more than 50% 60% of the Dutch Muslims find that Islamic law Sharia law is more important to them than the Dutch and civil and constitution and the Dutch civil law made by Parliament that is totally unacceptable in any democracy so that's why I'm talking about an existential problem we don't hate people but we want to stay free and in order to stay free and to for our children and grandchildren to exist we have to stop the Islamization of our society and this is something a lot of people might find it surprising but also Russia is talking about it's thinking about there is a Islamic community in Russia that existed as long as Russia does that is integrated and assimilated but they also have today a lot of working force coming from other parts of Asia to Russia today and if you ask people on the street it's not like like Holland or the United Kingdom or Denmark or Germany or Belgium or France today they sense the issue and we can work together here I'm sure you've proposed in the past the travel ban in the EU so I want to know how you feel about EU policies when it comes to immigration well you know my party supported the current Prime Minister's government a few years ago for two years time they've got the one government was for the first time in Dutch history was a minority government that's very common in Scandinavia but it was the first time in Holland without the support of my party that government would not have been able to exist and we made a deal in exchange for our support for some billions of austerity measures that my party didn't like to be honest that we signed off on it we got in return a tougher immigration policy so our Minister of Immigration travelled through all the European Union because we send away we gave away the key to a front door already we are not in charge of our own immigration policy anymore and he had to travel and he was not able to find a majority or even a qualified majority that you need in Europe and to support the idea that the Dutch would have a stronger immigration policy the Belgium's or the Eastern Europeans or others they thought well if Holland is tougher they will probably come to my country now the more immigrants we don't want that to happen so my point is that I would believe that if you want to have a stronger immigration policy it cannot be done within the context of the European Union that's what would you want the Netherlands and of the European Union you're part of a club that's playing by rules that you don't agree with exactly and I believe that next set the Dutch the Netherlands leaving the European Union would be the best route so my party issued a report about the consequences on the Netherlands both leaving the European Union and leaving the eurozone and that was commissioned by a prestigious Bureau from the United Kingdom who even won the Wolfson prize of economics a very prestigious Bureau and it proved both that as is happening in the kingdom today that in the first few years to be honest it would hurt it would hurt a lot but after that and if you would have not the ties of the European Union if you would not have to pay the bill of the southern European countries that we did with Greece with Cyprus with Portugal maybe in the future with countries like Italy within the eurozone you know we had to cut expenditure of the Dutch pension astray had to raise the premiums of our of our own social security in order to send the money to Greece people don't want that people don't like that so I believe we should get out of it it will hurt me beginning of at the end of the day we will benefit from it and even more important I believe that the real democracy can only flourish in the concept of a nation state and a nation state needs a national flag and national anthem a national culture but also to be in charge of your own budget and to be in charge of your own immigration policy it's everybody who is looking to this program today well understand that if you lost or gave away the front the key of your own front door of your own house you are not in charge anymore of who will enter or when a guest should leave there can be no national sovereignty if you don't have the key to the front door of your own house so I believe we should do that and of course I want to work together the European Union how it started in the 50s as an institution with economical cooperation the Holland was one of the six founding members it was perfect it was ideal but it unfortunately it became from an economical union it transferred in a political union if you look at what's happened in America are you not concerned that you know pushing for an exit and being anti-immigration might split your country right down the middle like it seems to have done with the United States you not look at them and think maybe that's not a direction we want to go in well I don't think Holland will become America tomorrow we are a different country again we share a lot with the Americans but we are not Americans I believe that what we want what America has even though it's a federal state what we long for is national sovereignty we are patriots there is nothing wrong on nasty about being a patriot how do you convince the many people who don't want these policies that it's the best thing for them because it's certainly not worked for Donald Trump and he's fighting at every turn half of the country at least wouldn't you be in the same position well you know it's maybe it's even easier for Donald Trump because America is more or less a two-party system and you get $1 you get nothing and whatever you think of mr. Trump he won the elections he's the President of the United States POTUS today and it's far more difficult to live in Holland once again my party became the second biggest party we won and a half million people voted for us but indeed for majority it's not enough our Parliament consists even our government consists of four parties the biggest party of the Dutch Prime Minister today only has 20 percent of the vote you need three four five parties to get a majority still in order to beat this what I called and mention to you this existential problem which is more than about immigration it's about national values it's about the security of our people it's about the safety of our children and grandchildren it's about our identity it's about our economy there will be no alternative and the longer we wait and the tougher it will be to create that country that Netherlands that you want do you need to be the Prime Minister do you want to be the Prime Minister of course every politician who answers you that he does not want to be the Prime Minister and is I think more a liar than telling the truth of course I would like to be the Prime Minister but even though still if somebody else would be the Prime Minister that would be fine as well as long as he's taking into account the interest of the Dutch people everybody can criticize mr. Trump that he believes that he's fighting for the interest of the American people everybody can criticize mr. Putin but mr. Putin thinks about only one thing and that is the interest of the Russian people and haven't we have a Prime Minister that I believe doesn't even know what the Dutch people are like he goes to Brussels and has to wheel and deal with all the other European Union countries and and then go to Copenhagen and then for lunch to Angela Merkel and then you find that compromise from a compromise from a compromise and nothing will change so I'm longing for leadership and I of course I would like to be the leader myself but to any leader who takes the interest of their own people first and of course you have to work with other countries and of course you don't have to build a wall around your own country I will be a favour of economical cooperation or cooperation any level but it doesn't have to be institutionalized and a body like the European Union where we transfer national sovereignty to it can be done on a voluntary basis on behalf of a country after the national parliament says it's okay a lot of people listening to your views on Islam will be thinking what are you yourself are you religious do you believe in God well um I wrote a book marked for death and it was published in America and not so long ago in a translated in Hungarian and an angei inversion and there I explained that I am an apple state I don't really believe in a god but I cannot deny that there is a God either but more important than that I believe in Christian values you know if you disagree with each other you either have compassion or you talk with one another and you engage in a debate I don't believe in if you dis if you disagree with our totalitarian ideologically ideally like I said Islam or you want to leave it the penalty is death or we will put you in jail so that the values of Christianity are shared by so many people in Western Europe and even in Russia even though they do not consider themselves Christians the amount of Christians I believe is on the decrease in many parts of Europe with the support for Christian values and the fight for freedom against the totalitarianism of Islam is on a remand from my own personal experience I would suggest that if somebody is hated by large portions of society or organizations they're either doing something very very right or very very wrong have you ever just analyzed yourself and just thought you know am I on the wrong side of this will history judge me that I got this wrong have you self evaluated yes and I believe I'm not a historian and I cannot speak about future people how they remember me that would be court desk will not do that but I really truly believe in what I'm doing and a lot of people once again one and a half million people voted for me and my party which made us the second biggest party in the kingdom of the Netherlands which is for a party that only exists for ten years an enormous accomplishment and I believe that I'm doing the right thing I'm even willing and I gave my personal freedom for that and all the people today we have municipality elections in a few weeks time in Holland we go for my party and stand up and our candidates for the municipalities are heroes because you are right they are loved by many people that they are hated by anybody else and this is the situation maybe in many Western countries certainly in Holland today that if you speak out if you are not afraid to tell the truth if you address the issues you're either lost or hate hated where are you then in realizing your your goal your dream for the country your what the second largest party was that a success for you in the last election how do you build how do you create the coalition it sounds like you would need a coalition to achieve your goals yes well we did not become the first party that's true so a lot of people hoped for that my party would become the number one party in Holland and we did not achieve that to be honest but we want seats we went from 15 seats in our lower house to 20 seats so we were one of the biggest winners the party of the prime minister who became the biggest party lost a third or quarter of the seats in power so there was the biggest party who lost and we the second party who won still because of all the issues we are talking about today stopping of the Islamization getting out of the European Union other parties are unwilling to work with us the only thing you can do and the only thing I always did and will do and I lost my own personal freedom for almost 14 years now I live under 24/7 protection my wife and I lived in army barracks and prison cells just in order to be safe because organizations like al-qaeda and the Taliban put a price on my head and I know one thing never give him as the great Winston Churchill once said never give him if you believe you are doing the right thing whatever the price and the consequence is continue and it might be difficult and you might not achieve it tomorrow but if you are doing the right thing I'm here in Russia it was on the 8 o'clock news as we spoke before in Holland that they try to make me very unpopular because of that but I believe I'm doing the right thing on behalf of a big part of my own people and that's why I do it and that's why I will continue to do it
