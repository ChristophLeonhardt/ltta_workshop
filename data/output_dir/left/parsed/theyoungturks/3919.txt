THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE RIGHT WING AND
THE LEFT RING.
THE RIGHT WING WANTS TO DESTROY
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND REPLACE
IT WITH ITS OWN PROPAGANDA.
WE ON THE LEFT WANT TO IMPROVE
THE MEDIA SO WE GIVE
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIQUE FROM TIME
TO TIME.
JOHN HERRMANN FROM THE NEW
YORK TIMES WROTE AN ERROR
ARTICLE THAT WAS TERRIBLE.
THE REASON WHY CUT PRINTED AND
THE EDITOR SIGNED OFF IS BECAUSE
THEY DO NOT WANT TO COVER THE
LEFT OR GIVE IT CREDENCE,
BUT EVERY OPPORTUNITY THEY GET
THEY HYPED UP THE RIGHT.
DOES ANYBODY EVER TRACK HOW MANY
LISTENERS RUSH LIMBAUGH HAS?
NO,
THEY TAKE THE WORD OF TALKERS
MAGAZINE WHICH THEY ITSELF
ADMIT THEY ARE MAKING UP.
THE MAINSTREAM PRESS GIVES
RUSH LIMBAUGH SO MUCH MORE
CREDIT AND POWER THAN HE
DESERVES.
NO ONE HAS EVER BOTHERED TO
VERIFY HIS NUMBERS.
GLENN BECK, NO ONE BOTHERS TO
VERIFY HIS NUMBERS.
DID YOU NOT GAIN A SINGLE
SUBSCRIBER OR LOSE A SINGLE
SUBSCRIBER?
NO ONE EVER CHECKS BECAUSE THEY
ALL BOW DOWN TO THEM.
DO KNOW THE AVERAGE AGE OF FOX
NEWS VIEWER IS 68 YEARS OLD?
THEY GIVE THEM WAY TOO MUCH
POWER AND RESPECT.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEFT THEY
LITERALLY REFUSE TO COVER IT.
IN THIS ARTICLE THEY SAY THAT
YOU YOUTUBE IS DOMINATED BY
THE RIGHT WING.
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY SAY THAT
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE?
DID YOU
NOT DO A SINGLE TREND OF
RESEARCH FOR THIS?
THEY TAKE
SMALLER OUTLETS ñ IF YOU THINK
THAT IS 
A SIGNIFICANT FOLLOWING,
I ASSUME THE NEW YORK TIMES WILL
BE WRITING ENDLESS STORIES ABOUT
US EVERY SINGLE DAY BECAUSE WE
ARE SO MUCH LARGER THAN
THEM, I'M NOT SURE I COULD DO
THE MATH.
250,000 FOLLOWERS.
THAT IS A GIANT PIMPLE ON OUR
ASS.
AND IN THE NEW YORK TIMES
WRITES A GIANT STORY ABOUT IT.
THEY SAY THE BIGGEST ONE IS PAUL
JOSEPH WATSON OF INFO WARS.
THAT SEEMS LIKE A BIG NUMBER.
AND THEY TAKE HIS WORD FOR
EVERYTHING.
THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE, BUT
CONTEXT IS MISSING.
WE WILL GET TO THE MONUMENTAL
ASS WHIPPING IN A SECOND.
SO ALL THAT TALK OF LIBERAL
MEDIA AND THEY ARE LIKE THIS
INSANE VLOGGER WHO HAS
RIDICULOUS LUNATIC CONSPIRACY
THEORIES SAYS SOMETHING IT
MUST BE TRUE.
ONE LAST QUOTE WHERE THEY FLUFF
UP THE RIGHT WING.
REALLY?
THERE IS NO ONE 
WITH AN ANSWER?
LET'S LOOK AT PAUL JOSEPH
WATSON AND SEE IF THE NEW YORK
TIMES HAS THE RIGHT NUMBERS.
THIS IS FROM HIS YOUTUBE PAGE.
HE DOES IN FACT HAVE OVER 1
MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, AND NOW
ENTER 226 MILLION VIEWS.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.
IF YOU ARE A MAINSTREAM REPORTER
AND YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
YOUTUBE AND CAN DO YOUR JOB YOU
MIGHT SAY I MIGHT WRITE AN
ARTICLE ABOUT THAT.
LET ME SHOW YOU OUR NUMBERS.
THAT IS 3.43 MILLION
SUBSCRIBERS, 3.7 BILLION VIEWS.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT EIGHT
MONUMENTAL ASS WHIPPING?
3.7
BILLION VIEWS, AND THAT IS JUST
ONE OF OUR CHANNELS, THE
FLAGSHIP CHANNEL.
LET ME SHOW YOU ARE OUR SMALLER
CHANNELS, WHICH ARE ALL
GREAT, YOU SHOULD WATCH THEM.
THINK TANK,
1.3 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, MORE
THAN 560 MILLION VIEWS.
BUT YET NO ONE HAS AN ANSWER FOR
THE RIGHT WING.
LET'S GO TO SECULAR TALK.
LOOK AT THE VIEW COUNT, 361
MILLION VIEWS.
WHERE IS YOUR ARTICLE 
ON THAT?
YOU DIDN'T DO ANY RESEARCH TO
DO?
POP TRIGGER OUR ENTERTAINMENT
CHANNEL, ALSO MORE VIEWS,
237 MILLION VIEWS.
BY THE WAY GREAT ENTERTAINMENT
AND SPORTS STUFF, AND WE
ALSO HAVE SPORTS.
FOR THE ENTIRE NETWORK IF THEY
HAD DONE THE RESEARCH, TYT
ACROSS YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK HAS
7 BILLION VIEWS AND 11
MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.
IT IS AS MANY PEOPLE AS EXISTS
ON THE PLANET.
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
NO ANSWER?
THEY HAVE NO ANSWER FOR US.
WE ARE THE GIANTS, WE DOMINATE
YOUTUBE AND ALL OF ONLINE MEDIA.
AMONG MILLENNIAL'S, ACCORDING TO
COMSCORE.
AMONG MILLENNIAL'S WE
BEADS NOT THESE PODUNK
RIGHT-WINGERS, WE BEAT CNN,
MSNBC, AND FOX NEWS COMBINED.
NEW YORK TIMES, IT IS CALLED
RESEARCH IN JOURNALISM ñ
LOOK INTO IT.
WE TOOK ALL OF THE GUYS THEY
MENTIONED AS GIANT BIG
DEALS AND WE ADDED 
THEM UP.
THAT IS ALMOST 3 MILLION
SUBSCRIBERS.
WHEN YOU ADD ALL OF THEM UP, LET
ME SEE TYT SUBSCRIBERS?
FOR JUST
ONE CHANNEL, WE BEAT ALL OF THEM
COMBINED.
NO ANSWER.
WHO WAS NUMBER ONE ON YOUTUBE IN
THE NEWS CATEGORY?
THE YOUNG TURKS.
NUMBER TWO IS ABC, THEN YOU HAVE
CNN AND 
NUMBER FIVE.
CONGRATULATIONS ALEX, YOU MADE
THE LIST.
NEW YORK TIMES, I KNOW YOU HAVE
DISDAIN FOR THE LEFT WING, YOU
NEVER WANT TO COVER THEM.
IT IS TRUE FOR ALL THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA.
TEA PARTY DOES SOMETHING STRANGE
THEY GO BALLISTIC.
THE MOST AMOUNT OF RELAXING
CAPITOL HILL HISTORY BECAUSE OF
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE ON GETTING
MONEY OUT OF POLITICS, THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE ARRESTED AN AMAZING
MOMENT, NO COVERAGE.
I ASKED ONE OF THE CABLE NEWS
HOSTS IF THEY WOULD'VE COVERED
IT IF THEY WOULD'VE BROKEN THE
RECORD, HE BEGRUDGINGLY
SAID YES.
IF THE RIGHT-WING DOES SOMETHING
THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA SAYS
OH WE ARE THE LIBERAL MEDIA,
RIGHT WING YOU ARE SO GREAT.
WHEN PROGRESSIVES DO SOMETHING
IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS MET WITH
ENORMOUS DISDAIN AND NO COVERAGE
AT ALL.
UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS ONE CASE,
IT IS THE DEFINITION OF
FAKE NEWS.
NEW YORK TIMES, I KNOW THEY HATE
YOU BUT WE ACTUALLY WANT
YOU TO DO BETTER.
THIS WAS NOT BETTER, THIS WAS
TERRIBLE.
