welcome to Kazan arena this magnificent
stadium has already seen channel sleek
and Confederation Cup football and this
summer it's gonna be hosting six games
in the World Cup one of them will
feature local hero Rubin Kazan striker
Zahra has moved from Iran and he goes
face to face with Spain's Sergio Ramos
Kazan is a significant Muslim city so
for Iran to play on this pitch is
obviously massive but what else is going
on well I'm Peter Schmeichel
and I'm here to find out the first thing
I will tell you about Kazan is that I
think it's beautiful and that's only one
way where I can see everything at once
and that's from inside the flying bird
it's also very diverse it's a half the
population they pray in there that's a
cathedral that's for the Christians the
other half they pray over there in the
mosque that's some Muslims but come work
up time they're all going to be praying
to the football guard
I've been invited to a traditional chat
on Muslim wedding today and the best
idea I could come up with as a gift was
to cook my own chuck 'chuck which is the
most traditional TARDIS than dessert
it's the first time I'm doing this but
I'm pretty confident and I'm off running
attending them it's nice look at that
now I need to roll it nice and even now
I'm gonna cut it like that so I'm gonna
take half of this now and put it in the
oil and the reason it's half is that if
you protect the whole thing they might
just grow together in the oil and I'm
now gonna prepare this syrup which is
basically just half honey and half sugar
and this is where the cha-cha starts to
become a bit
I'm health if you like so this is nice
and perfect just have a look at that a
lot of calories in there pour it over
here
and it really needs to be quick because
it's stick together I now have to form
it with my hands I think in the history
of Georgia this doesn't come first I'll
tell you what I can do
let's just do this there's no way that I
can bring this to the happy couple
that's gonna mean bad luck for them
to Hawaii I made you one oh so that's a
that's how it's supposed to look
thank you very much for teaching me
thank you thank you very much or
whatever you would call that
that was really unique I've never
experienced anything like that but I'm
gonna leave them to Kazan is known as
one of Russia's major sports cities the
current champions in volleyball
they've been football champions ice
hockey champions banded champions and
also water polo champion water polo
never tried that before I'm gonna have a
go
now it's hard and difficult I've got so
much respect for these guys but also a
concern for me that football is
definitely something that I can do
