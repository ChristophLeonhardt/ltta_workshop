JILLIAN: A FOX NEWS ALERT, THREE

00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,332
AMERICANS JUST FREED FROM NORTH

00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:18,735
KOREA ARRIVING AT WALTER REED

MEDICAL CENTER, LANDED ON

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,275
AMERICAN SOIL FOR THE FIRST

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:25,575
TIME.

8
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:30,547
>> DETAINEES GREETED WARMLY BY

9
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:32,281
DONALD TRUMP, AND THE FIRST

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,617
LADY.

11
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,952
THE UNAUTHORIZED AUTOBIOGRAPHY

12
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:38,822
OF KIM JONG-IL, MICHAEL MALICE,

13
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:41,658
HERE TODAY, THE FATHER OF KIM

14
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:42,359
JONG UN, THE FORMER LEADER OF

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,495
NORTH KOREA, A BIG MOMENT.

16
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,099
HOW BIG A SUCCESS STORY IS THIS?

17
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:52,970
>> SOME PEOPLE REMEMBER 1980,

18
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,704
RONALD REAGAN WAS SWORN IN AND

19
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:57,040
HOSTAGES WERE FREED.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,447
THE FACT THE LAST TIME -- THIS

21
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:06,950
IS A BIG WIN FOR US.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,552
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT GIVE ANY

23
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:08,952
CONCESSIONS.

24
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:09,653
AND KIM JONG UN SULTAN EASILY.

25
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,724
>> HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT?

26
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:22,933
>> NORTH KOREA HAD A REPORTER,

27
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,369
PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD THE FAMOUS

28
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,737
PHOTO, LOOKING LIKE A HOSTAGE

29
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:36,847
HIMSELF.

30
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:38,081
HIMSELF.

31
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:38,648
HAD TO BE OBSEQUIOUS.

32
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:39,282
AND IF KIM JONG-IL AND IS

33
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:40,017
WILLING TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND

34
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:46,957
MEET DONALD TRUMP ON NEUTRAL

35
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:47,457
SOIL IS A CHANGE.

36
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,259
ROB: THERE ARE BRAGGING RIGHTS

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,726
FOR KIM JONG UN.

38
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,228
HAVING THE PRESIDENT OF THE

39
00:01:51,228 --> 00:01:55,298
UNITED STATES CONSIDERING YOU, A

40
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,300
SMALL LITTLE HERMIT KINGDOM.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,939
>> IT IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR

42
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:03,240
THEM.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,674
THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH IS GREAT,

44
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:05,342
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP

45
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:14,184
DIDN'T HAVE A MEETING, THAT IS

46
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:14,684
HOW THEY OPERATE.

47
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:16,286
ALSO TO CONCESSIONS WITHOUT THE

48
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:20,557
MEETINGS HAVING BEEN HELD.

49
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,291
DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS, AND THE

50
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,727
JAPANESE RUN UP THE ISSUE.

51
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,930
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF HAVING THE

52
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,298
NEGOTIATION.

53
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:32,269
THIS IS A BIG STEP AND WE HAVE

54
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,973
THREE HOSTAGES, 25 MILLION MORE

55
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,543
HOSTAGES TO GO.

56
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:46,416
>> IT IS FAIR TO CELEBRATE AND

57
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,150
BE THRILLED AND HAPPY FOR WHAT

58
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,884
PLAYS OUT IN THE WE HOURS OF THE

59
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:48,218
MORNING.

60
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,954
HOW DO WE FEEL AND LOOK FORWARD

61
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:57,160
FROM HERE?

62
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,962
SKEPTICAL, OPTIMISTIC?

63
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:03,834
>> WE LOOK AT THEIR ACTIONS AND

64
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:04,568
THESE ARE CONCRETE DEMONSTRABLE

65
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:05,302
MOVES THE THINGS THAT WE WANT,

66
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:07,270
THAT THEY SHOULD WANT AS WELL TO

67
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:16,379
BE A COUNTRY IN THE 21ST CENTURY

68
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:16,880
AND NOT THE 19TH.

69
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,614
ROB: LOOKING AT THIS SITUATION

70
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,315
IN EARLY JUNE WHEN THEY MEET

71
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:19,049
SUPPOSEDLY IN SINGAPORE I DON'T

72
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:19,783
SEE HOW THIS DOESN'T TURN INTO A

73
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:25,055
STALEMATE BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE

74
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:25,655
GUYS NEED TO WIN IN ANY

75
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:26,389
NEGOTIATION WAS BOTH SIDES CAN'T

76
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:26,656
WIN.

77
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:30,527
WHO IS THE ONE WHO GIVES ON

78
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:30,927
THIS?

79
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:31,661
IT WON'T BE THE PRES. NO WAY HE

80
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,295
WILL LET THIS BE A LOSING

81
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,766
SITUATION FOR THE UNITED STATES.

82
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:41,171
>> DON'T THINK THAT IS TO SOME

83
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,873
EXTENT, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD

84
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:46,309
DEAL.

85
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,877
>> WOULD THEY DO THAT?

86
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:47,544
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT FROM THEM.

87
00:03:47,544 --> 00:03:52,582
>> THE FACT THEY ARE WILLING TO

88
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:58,955
TALK ABOUT THAT, ON SOCIAL MEDIA

89
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:04,594
AND IN COURSE TERMS, IT IS

90
00:04:04,594 --> 00:04:05,529
INTENSE AND KIND OF LIKE THE

91
00:04:05,529 --> 00:00:00,000
BIBLE, AFTER REFERRING TO THAT,
