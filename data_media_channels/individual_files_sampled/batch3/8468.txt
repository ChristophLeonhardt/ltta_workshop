WE ARE LIVE IN THE MIDDLE EAST PUREE WITH CONNOR. WHO WAS THE EXACT SPECIFIC TARGET OF THESE ATTACKS? THIS CEASE-FIRE DID NOT STOP ALL THE VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN. THEY WERE REAL WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE TALIBAN. WE SAW THE TALIBAN GOES INTO CITIES, LAID ON WEAPONS AND CELEBRATE THE MUSLIM HOLIDAY. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS CEASE-FIRE IS IT DID NOT INCLUDE ISIS WHO LAUNCHED A SERIES OF ATTACKS ON THE TALIBAN FIGHTERS.

THEN THE ISIS MILITANTS USE THIS TO ATTACK THE TALIBAN FIGHTERS THERE. THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE THAT THIS MAY LEAD TO SOME TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND THE TALIBAN THAT THERE ARE MUCH MORE IN COMMON OF WHERE THEY SEE AFGHANISTAN GOING AND THAT THEIR WORK TOGETHER TO BATTLE ISIS THAT IS REALLY STILL A
