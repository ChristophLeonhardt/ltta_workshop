1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
to the members of the Security Council I
must say enough is enough we have taken

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,230
an incremental approach and despite the
best of intentions it has not worked

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,050
members of this council will no doubt
urge negotiations and a return to talks

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,550
but as I have just outlined we have
engaged in numerous direct and

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,220
multilateral talks with the North Korean
regime and time after time they have not

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,430
worked the time for half-measures in the
Security Council is over the time has

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,579
come to exhaust all of our diplomatic
means before it's too late we must now

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,690
adopt the strongest possible measures
Kim Jong Un's action cannot be seen as

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,420
defensive he wants to be acknowledged as
a nuclear power but being a nuclear

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,550
power is not about using those terrible
weapons to threaten others nuclear

11
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,450
powers understand their responsibilities
Kim jong-un shows no such understanding

12
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,580
his abusive use of missiles and his
nuclear threats show that he is begging

13
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,880
for war war is never something the
United States wants we don't want it now

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:00:00,000
but our country's patience is not
unlimited
