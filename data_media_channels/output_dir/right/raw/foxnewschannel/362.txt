1
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,100
>> Ed: AT THIS HOUR, BRETT

2
00:00:07,101 --> 00:00:09,602
KAVANAUGH POISED TO BECOME THE

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,437
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

4
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:13,339
IT WILL NO DOUBT ANGER HIS

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,307
CRITICED THAT LASHED OUT AGAINST

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,876
HIM ALL WEEK AND BEFORE THAT.

7
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:18,144
INCLUDING CHELSEA CLINTON.

8
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,913
>> WHAT WAS SO TROUBLING WITH

9
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:21,548
HOW NAKEDLY PARTISAN HE WAS.

10
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:25,051
SO ADMITTEDLY MY OPPOSITION TO

11
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:29,522
HIM IS ROOTED IN POLICY, BUT I

12
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,724
NOW AM EVEN MORE KIND OF INTENSE

13
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:34,594
IN MY FEELINGS BECAUSE OF HOW

14
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:35,361
POLITICAL HE'S BECOME.

15
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:37,463
>> I'M WONDERING WHAT YOUR

16
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:38,565
RESPONSE IS TO HOW WE'VE SEEN

17
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,066
DR. FORD'S PLAY?

18
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:41,401
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE

19
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:42,602
THAT SAID I WAS GOING TO DO THAT

20
00:00:42,603 --> 00:00:44,037
BUT I DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH

21
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:44,437
THAT?

22
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,673
>> I WOULD SAY I UNDERSTAND THAT

23
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:48,274
AND I HOPE YOU'RE STILL WILLING

24
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,411
TO RAISE YOUR HAND, RAISE YOUR

25
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:52,078
VOICE.

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,913
>> Ed: HERE NOW, JUANITA

27
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:56,983
BRODRICK THAT ACCUSED FORMER

28
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:58,685
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON OF RAPING

29
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:02,055
HER IN 1978 WHILE HE WAS RUNNING

30
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:02,722
FOR GOVERNOR.

31
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:03,957
NIGHT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

32
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,892
>> GOOD TO BE HERE.

33
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,961
>> WHAT ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED

34
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:09,395
BETWEEN YOU AND BILL CLINTON DID

35
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:12,198
TO YOU THAT YOU ALLEGE?

36
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:16,002
CHELSEA CLINTON IS NOT CULPABLE

37
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,071
FOR THAT BUT HOW DO YOU REACT

38
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:19,038
WITH WHAT SHE SAID?

39
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,007
>> I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

40
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:22,241
I DO.

41
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:24,577
I FEEL LIKE SHE NEEDS TO SAY

42
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:26,079
SOMETHING ABOUT HER OWN FAMILY

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,981
AND DEAL WITH HER OWN FAMILY AND

44
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:30,483
WHAT THEY DID TO ME BEFORE SHE

45
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:33,419
CAN EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE

46
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,420
A COMMENT AGAINST JUDGE

47
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:36,122
KAVANAUGH OR IN FAVOR OF

48
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:36,589
DR. FORD.

49
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,291
>> SPEAKING OF HER FAMILY, LET'S

50
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,226
LOOK AT WHAT HILLARY CLINTON, OF

51
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:42,362
COURSE, THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL

52
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,631
CANDIDATE SAID IN 2015.

53
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:45,698
LISTEN TO THIS.

54
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:48,301
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY THAT

55
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:49,836
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE BELIEVED AT

56
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:52,672
FIRST UNTIL THEY ARE DISBELIEVED

57
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:53,473
BASED ON EVIDENCE.

58
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:54,841
>> Ed: EVERYONE SHOULD BE

59
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,376
BELIEVED AND MOVE IT FORWARD TO

60
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:58,478
THE DEBATE THIS PAST WEEK OR SO.

61
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,113
WE HEARD DEMOCRAT AFTER DEMOCRAT

62
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:03,049
SAY WHEN IT CAME TO DR. FORD, WE

63
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,716
BELIEVE HER.

64
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,619
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A

65
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,487
DIFFERENT REACTION.

66
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,254
>> I DID.

67
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:11,257
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE ON MY SIDE

68
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,225
EXCEPT THE PUBLIC.

69
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:14,961
THE PUBLIC WAS ON MY SIDE.

70
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:17,397
BUT THE MEDIA JUST HOUNDED ME

71
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,432
AND HAD THE MOST AWFUL, YOU

72
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:22,935
KNOW, THINGS TO SAY ABOUT ME.

73
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:25,438
IT WAS VERY DISHEARTENING.

74
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,539
>> Ed: WHAT WE HEARD IN THE LAST

75
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,840
WEEK THAT MIGHT HAVE TILTED THE

76
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,143
LAST DAY, SUSAN COLLINS AND JOE

77
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,544
MANCHIN TO SUPPORT JUDGE

78
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:31,911
KAVANAUGH.

79
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,980
THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS NO

80
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,214
CORROBORATION TO THE ALLEGATIONS

81
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,683
THAT DR. FORD RAISED.

82
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:39,752
WHAT WAS THE CORROBORATION THAT

83
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,020
YOU BROUGHT TO THE TABLE TO BE

84
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:41,454
FAIR HERE?

85
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:42,989
>> I HAD THE LATE DID THAT FOUND

86
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,924
ME 30 MINUTES AFTER THE RAPE AND

87
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:46,926
I TOLD FIVE OTHER PEOPLE.

88
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:49,495
I HAD THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE

89
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:52,198
SEMINAR THAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO

90
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,735
BE ATTENDING THAT DAY.

91
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:57,603
IT WAS -- THERE WERE SO MANY

92
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:57,937
THINGS.

93
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:00,239
I CAN REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT

94
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,474
THE EVENT.

95
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,042
I CAN'T IMAGINE DR. FORD, IF

96
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,944
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENED TO

97
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:07,447
HER, NOT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER

98
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,781
THE LITTLEST DETAILS.

99
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:09,182
I DO.

100
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,818
>> Ed: DID YOU COME FORWARD TO

101
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,418
THE ARKANSAS POLICE?

102
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:12,952
>> NO.

103
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:15,121
HOW COULD I COME FORWARD TO THE

104
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:15,455
POLICE?

105
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,023
BILL CLINTON WAS THE POLICE.

106
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:18,257
HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

107
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:19,592
>> Ed: ATTORNEY GENERAL, LATER

108
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:20,159
GOVERNOR, OF COURSE.

109
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,693
>> RIGHT.

110
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:23,730
HE REGULATED MY NURSING HOMES.

111
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,164
I OWNED NURSING HOLMES AT THE

112
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:25,565
TIME.

113
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,033
HE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS

114
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,334
RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING

115
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:29,168
NURSING HOMES.

116
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,303
>> Ed: WE HEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP

117
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:31,504
TAKE SOME HEAT THIS WEEK FOR

118
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,138
RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT

119
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,439
DR. FORD'S STORY.

120
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,042
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID, YOU

121
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,443
KNOW, WE DIDN'T SHE, WHY DIDN'T

122
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:39,345
HER LOVING PARENTS COME FORWARD

123
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,847
WITH THIS STORY DECADES AGO.

124
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,848
HOW DO YOU ANSWER THAT?

125
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,549
>> I WAS FRIGHTENED.

126
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,085
I WAS INTIMIDATED BY HILLARY

127
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,854
CLINTON THREE WEEKS AFTER THE

128
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:48,554
RAPE.

129
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:49,789
AND I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED.

130
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,592
I WAS FRIGHTENED OF THEM.

131
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:54,360
THEY GAIN POWER BY THE YEAR.

132
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,763
I STILL WAS A STRUGGLING

133
00:03:56,764 --> 00:03:58,231
BUSINESS OWNER THAT BILL CLINTON

134
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:00,566
COULD HAVE SHUT DOWN AT A

135
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:01,267
MOMENT'S NOTICE.

136
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:03,002
>> Ed: YOU TALKED ABOUT DIANNE

137
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:04,604
FEINSTEIN WHO HAS BEEN FRONT AND

138
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:06,272
CENTER IN THE BATTLE, RECEIVING

139
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:07,774
THE ANONYMOUS LETTER FROM

140
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,642
DR. FORD, SITTING ON IT AND A

141
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:10,309
ALL THE REST.

142
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,878
WHEN YOU CAME FORWARD, SHE

143
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,513
DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORY.

144
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:14,514
>> NOT AT ALL.

145
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,516
I DIDN'T COME FORWARD WILLINGLY.

146
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:19,552
I WAS OUTED BY THE PAULA JONES

147
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:19,852
SUIT.

148
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,287
THEN HERE'S KEN STARR'S PEOPLE.

149
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:24,390
THAT'S WHEN I TOLD THE TRUTH.

150
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,959
I WENT THROUGH A DIFFICULT

151
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,296
DEPOSITION, YOU KNOW, WITH THE

152
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:30,997
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL.

153
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:33,533
AND THEY REFUSED TO READ IT.

154
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,434
NOT ONE DEMOCRAT WOULD READ IT.

155
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:37,336
>> Ed: SO FINAL QUESTION.

156
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,805
WHAT DO YOU WANT ALL OF THESE

157
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:39,539
YEARS LATER?

158
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,074
WHAT WOULD BE JUSTICE FOR YOU?

159
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,843
>> JUSTICE WOULD BE FOR ME TO

160
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:44,877
HAVE AN INVESTIGATION.

161
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:47,046
IF THEY'RE GOING TO GO BACK 35

162
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,981
YEARS, 36 YEARS FOR CHRISTINE

163
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:51,984
FORD, THEY OUGHT TO GO BACK 39

164
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:52,718
FOR ME.

165
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:55,154
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, IF THEY

166
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:57,456
CAN -- IF IT CAN BE PROVED THAT

167
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,560
THIS HAPPENED, I WOULD LIKE TO

168
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:03,462
SEE PRESIDENT CLINTON PERKS AS A

169
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:04,463
FORMER PRESIDENT REMOVED.

170
00:05:04,464 --> 00:00:00,000
HE RECEIVES MILLIONS FROM OUR
