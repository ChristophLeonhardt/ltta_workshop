1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,200
If you switched on the
television in the U.S. this week,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,450
you’ve seen a lot of this:

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,550
“... the world watching

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,890
that high-stakes summit”

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,180
“... we’re continuing our
breaking coverage ahead

6
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,060
of President Trump and Kim
Jong-un’s high-stakes summit ...”

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,680
“... an unprecedented
nuclear summit with

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,590
North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un ...”

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,870
But meanwhile, viewers
in North Korea

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,520
saw a lot of this.

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,930
“The Sunday broadcast
was much the same

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,610
as every Sunday.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,030
So, documentaries about the
life of one of the Kims,

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,260
revolutionary movies —
one of the programs

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,880
this Sunday was about
evils of tobacco.

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,940
And there were
children’s shows as well.”

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,920
“Normally North Koreans don’t
see anything in real time

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,430
about any foreign excursion
by the supreme leader.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,790
There’s normally nothing
until after he has come back

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,580
to the country.”

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,370
In a country
built on controlling

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,990
the flow of information,

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,990
the state-run media
apparatus holds all the power.

24
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,510
“By not reporting on
things beforehand,

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,830
the North Korean government
a) doesn’t build expectations

26
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,328
and b) gets to decide
that whatever happens,

27
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:07,456
it was a success.”

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,240
But on Monday morning,
North Korean state media

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,200
did something unheard of.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,270
“We saw an unprecedented
amount of North Korean media

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,390
activity about Kim Jong-un’s
visits in Singapore.

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,780
All of it was
reported in real time.

33
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,830
And in fact, the anchor,
a woman named Ri Chun-hee,

34
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,220
a very famous anchor in North
Korea, used the name

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,570
Donald Trump —

36
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:37,365
and used the
the honorific form in Korean

37
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:39,810
to describe President Trump.

38
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,190
So this is unprecedented.”

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,040
This giant departure
from tradition

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,050
is part of a bigger
seismic shift.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,780
Since Kim’s conciliatory
New Year’s speech,

42
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,290
North Korea’s
propaganda machine

43
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,430
has toned down its
anti-American messaging.

44
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,100
Broadcasts like
this one,

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,520
have become less frequent.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
And so have North Korean
propaganda leaflets

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,180
like these dropped
over South Korea.

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,880
They had been depicting
Donald Trump and U.S. allies

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,980
in a hostile light.

50
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,870
But early this
year, the leaflets

51
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,110
suddenly started taking a
much less aggressive tone.

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,440
“A lot of messages about
reconciliation, unification,

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,580
peace, et cetera, and there
was even a Olympic-themed one

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,879
which showed the
Olympic mascots,

55
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,200
and they genuinely look like
they could have been

56
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,320
from South Korea.”

57
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,250
And in April,
when both Koreas agreed

58
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,560
to cease all propaganda initiatives,

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,516
the fliers stopped altogether.

60
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,560
But time will tell
whether a

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,590
friendlier tone in
North Korea’s propaganda

62
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,380
will translate into a
shift in Kim’s policies.

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,570
“North Korea likes
very big gestures

64
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,480
and having a meeting with
the president of the United States —

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,930
that means a lot.

66
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,620
And that can provide
a certain momentum

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,570
internally in North Korea to
get some tangible steps going

68
00:03:09,570 --> 00:00:00,000
in terms of denuclearization.”
