the head of Germany's security service has called into question the veracity of videos and media reports to that claim to show scenes of anti-migrant mob violence in this city of chemnitz the very same reports that Chancellor Merkel cited in her condemnation of the unrest there it comes amid a series of anti-migrant rallies and counter demonstrations in the city as Peter Oliver reports right-wing demonstrators were back out on the streets of Chemnitz on Friday evening around a thousand people gathered in the city they were holding up banners saying that we are the people also that they were not Nazis that wasn't a repeat of the type of violence that we saw last week or even two weeks ago they seems to have gone off relatively peacefully but on Friday there was another big development this is after the head of Germany's internal Intelligence Service the BFL pointed to videos that are emerged around two weeks ago of the demonstrations that were said to show far-right demonstrators hunting down chasing people that looked like foreigners and trying to attack them now he gave an interview to a major newspaper here in Germany saying he doesn't think they're legitimate there was no reliable information that such hunts took place based on my cautious assessment there are good reasons to believe that this was intentional false information possibly to detract attention from the murder in Chemnitz I share the skepticism towards the media reports on right-wing extremist hunts in Chemnitz well there's been a lot of calls for mr. Masson to and to clarify what he said or produce evidence for the reasons why he said it one of the the main reasons for this skepticism is the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel cited these videos herself in her condemnation of right-wing violence in Chemnitz although there certainly are extremist right-wing people amongst those crowds we've seen straight arm salutes the Nazi salute of course in there in the past there but there are also those who are coming out to these demonstrations who are just saying they're not right-wing extremists they're just concerned citizens you cognize a chick but don't send enum and sex I've talked it off with my dad too well amongst those talking about the demonstrations and in fact saying that he would take part in one under different circumstances was the always outspoken German interior minister Horst zero offer if I wasn't a minister I would have taken to the streets as a citizen but of course not with the radicals Angela Merkel has accused the far-right of exploiting the killing of that 35 year old man for their own aims however whether that's true or not alternative for Germany the right-wing party that has well being claimed to be anti Islam anti-immigrant in the past they have shot up to second place in polling here in Germany 17% of those polled said that they would vote for them in a general election that if there was a general election tomorrow would make them the second largest political body taking a seat in the Bundestag well we spoke to bhishan Tavis Ollie he's a member of the Left Party in Germany and he says that the left has failed to address people's concerns and that has allowed the right to flourish it seems to be very difficult and as the left as myself and the son of an immigrant I have to say that it's also the fault of my party that we should have been guiding those people but instead it's the radical right that are doing Hitler salutes and radical things and they are guiding those people in the wrong direction I think what we've seen after this is complete and utter chaos if one interior intelligence chief who says no all of this is just fake news you know under normal circumstances he should have been fired already and I don't know what it tell us about the state of the German government that Angela Merkel is apparently not capable of firing him right now you
