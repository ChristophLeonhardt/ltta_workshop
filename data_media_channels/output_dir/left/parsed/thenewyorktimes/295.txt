My name's Alex Garland, and I'm
the director of "Annihilation."
So here we have our five
scientists having just
arrived inside Area X, which
is this sealed off area
somewhere in a kind
of unspecified part
of coastal America.
And what they're finding
is strange plant forms
and strange lighting
effects, kind
of rainbow prismatic
effects in the sky.
And they're really, just â€”
This is their first
hours in this area,
and they're trying to
figure out what's going on
and what's happening here.
And what we're about
to do is introduce
a new element, which is
not lighting and plants,
but a creature, a rather sort
of gently mutated creature,
and they get more
extreme as we go in.
And this here is
just in my mind,
a very beautiful bit
of production design.
It's a good example about
how production designers
improve what is in a script.
"Anything interesting in there?"
"No.
It's been long abandoned,
maybe even before--"
I'd written "EXTERIOR
FISHING HUT, DAY."
And Michelle Day, who is
one of the people who's
very responsible for
the look of this film,
found all sorts of
images of slightly
sort of cutesy ramshackle
fishing huts in Louisiana
and Florida, and
decided this was not
the right way for us to
go, and actually went out
and found this really
interesting sort
of trailer-like hut that was
half submerged in the swamp,
and it gave a completely
different vibe.
It was less sort of
picturesque and less cutesy.
And offset against this very
beautiful background of trees,
and Spanish moss,
and sunlight, I just
thought it was a
very smart choice,
and it was very typical of
Miche that that's what she did.
We actually shot this
just outside London
in an area of Parkland.
And most of what you see
there, in some respects,
is constructed.
There are trees
and there is water,
but the hut and really
a lot of the foliage,
the sort of spiky plants, and
grasses, and stuff like that
have been arranged
by the set dressers
to make this not look like
England, really, but look
like a sort of mutated version,
a sort of broken version,
maybe, of somewhere in coastal
southern North America.
"Sheppard!
Sheppard, watch out!"
And this becomes a
character beat, really,
about Natalie Portman's
character at this point, which
is the strange way she zones
in to this moment of violence.
As everyone else is backing
away from this creature,
she kind of leans into it
and has this slightly zen
experience as she kills it.
