AND THEN SOME. Neil: I WANT TO SWITCH TO A SUBJECT THAT PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO. THIS IS A DOCTOR SUING A PATIENT FOR A MILLION BUCKS BECAUSE SHE GAVE A BAD REVIEW ON YELP. SO I GET YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WRITE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHO READS REVIEWS ON YELP ANY WAYS? YOU DO? I NEVER DO. I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE THAT LEAVE REVIEWS ON YELP ARE PICKY. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GREAT. THE FOOD WAS GREAT BUT THE FREE BREAD WAS STALE. THIS IS A DOCTOR THOUGH. DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY HE WAS CHARACTERIZED. YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WRITING IT. I READ IT, TOO. I'M TOO LAZY TO WRITE YEAH. STUDY CAME OUT. 49 PEOPLE SAID THEY WON'T GO TO A BUSINESS IF THEY PEOPLE IF IT'S BELOW FOUR STARS. SO THIS DOCTOR HAS A RIGHT TO MAINTAIN WHAT IS BEING SAID. Neil: HOW TO ANSWER IT IF IT'S NOT FACTUAL. TO ME, IT KILLS THIS INDUSTRY OF YELP AND TRIP ADVISER AND THE OTHER HEALTH GRADES. IT'S ONE THING, YES, IF PEOPLE LEAVE NEGATIVE COMPLETELY EGREGIOUS THINGS. IF SOMEONE LEAVES SOMETHING THAT IS TRUTHFUL. I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME. I WENT TO SEE YOU AND THEN YOUR RECOURSE IS JUST SUE ME. WHAT IS THIS? LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS? YEAH. A MILLION BUCKS SEEMS LIKE QUITE A BIT. IT'S PR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEM RIGHT NOW. THIS DOCTOR. HIS FACE IS IN ALL OF THESE ADVERTISEMENTS. HE'S GETTING FREE AIR TIME. BUT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO TO HIM. Neil: PEOPLE ARE THINKING, I HAVE TO BE CRITICAL. I COULD BE SUED. SHE'S NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO SUE SOMEBODY WITH A NEGATIVE REVIEW. REALLY? YEAH. THERE WAS A CHIMNEY COMPANY IT'S AN EXAMPLE. IT'S WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YOU TRUST GOING BACK TO THIS GUY. HE'S AN OB-GYN. YOU GO BACK AND LIKE Neil: WE'RE NOT GOING THERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN MAKING CONTROVERSIAL PARDONS. BLAGOJEVICH, MARTHA STEWART AND ON AND ON. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? TAKE NOTE? I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THESE PARDONS. IF HE'S GOING TO BE PARDONING PEOPLE, HE NEEDS TO PARDON MATTHEW CHARLES. HE WAS OUT FOR TWO YEARS. HE HAD A STEADY JOB, STEADY GIRLFRIEND. VOLUNTEERS EVERY SATURDAY. TURNS OUT HE WAS RELEASED IN ERROR SO THEY'RE SENDING HIM BACK FOR ANOTHER DECADE. THEY SENT HIM BACK Neil: AND THEY HAVE PETITIONED HIM TO DO THAT. IT'S AWFUL. IF HE'S PARDONING Neil: AND BLAGOJEVICH, MARCH A COMMUTE RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE TRUMP IS PARDONING PEOPLE ON "THE APPRENTICE" OR PEOPLE SUPPORTING HIM OR IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING IF JUSTICE IS BEING SERVED AND THE PRESIDENT IS USING THEIR POWER IN A GOOD WAY. 2016, 17, BEFORE OBAMA LEFT, HE PARDONED THE FALM TERRORIST. Neil: DO WE KNOW IF THIS PRESIDENT HAS HAD MORE NO, AT THIS STAGE. FEELS LIKE IT. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT IT. COULD BE TWO THINGS. ONE THING THAT HE SHOWS HE HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABOVE THE LAW. IF IT'S WERE MARTHA STEWART, I'M GETTING A COMEBACK, DOING THINGS WITH SNOOP DOG. I DON'T WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT I LIED ON AN INSIDER TRADING CASE. WHAT'S THE POINT? Neil: IS THAT EXPUNGED FROM HER RECORD? THE PONCHO SHE WORE SOLD WELL. IT WAS A KNITTED PONCHO. YOU HAVE DETAILS. IT SEEMED HYPOCRITE IT SEEMED HYPOCRIIE IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICA IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL T IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL THA IT SEEMED HYPOCRIICAL THAT
