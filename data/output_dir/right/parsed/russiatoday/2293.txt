from 1952 to 2001 it was a solid glass
here and then it broke into northern and
southern parts we started watching the
second one
we are ver whelmed with emotion when we
saw the outlines of the island we kept
watching as a connecting strip got
smaller and smaller and finally in
December we got a picture of the fully
for mine
when we suddenly became ground breakers
who began to treat all those great
discoveries in a different way
and I still can't believe who became a
part of this world
now maybe like as well our suggestion is
based on the form of the island which
looks like a manatee but the scientists
are now called in there the island of
pupils and we like the same as well
