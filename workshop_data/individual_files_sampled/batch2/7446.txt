Before we jump into the next clip I just want to tell you real quick we got a new audio network go to TYT dot-com slash audio and get all of our new podcasts James Gunn was the director of guardians of the galaxy I say was because he was recently let go by Disney because of a controversy online regarding some very old tweets that he sent now he came up through an area where he did shock humor and and did some entertainment that was more schlocky as well and and he wrote some tweets that were definitely considered offensive today he has apologized for them and and people think well that's it that's the whole story no that is not the whole story let me tell you what actually happened so that you have the proper context first of all there are a lot of people who understand the context and a lot of people who work with them who are now rallying to his defense so they too are being attacked which is part of the game plan as I will outline to you so selma Blair is one of the people who were supporting and worked with him in the past so she sent out this tweet encouraging people to sign a petition to get him rehired by Disney by the way this morning it's probably now much higher but that petition already had over a hundred and seventy thousand signatures now the reason for that is not because people necessarily know all of James Gunn's track record but those people understand where these attacks came from and why conceding to those attacks a terrible terrible idea give you some background on Blair how post rights selma Blair a victim of sexual harassment who was encouraged by gun to step forward in her claims against the writer James Toback as a me-too moving gained steam thank Gunn for decency and your evolution as a man she went on to write I thank you for your talent your decency in your evolution you prop me up when I was in a scary place and guided me towards a decent and right thing to do you have shown strength of character more than most anyone I know you understood so his actions showed that he was actually incredibly supportive women and and so others in the destroy defending him including patton oswalt and now they are being viciously attacked by a smear machine on on the right and so these are over by the way old jokes now you can say the jokes were off-color they were offensive and that's what James Gunn says and he agrees with you on that and that's why he does not stand by them but they were clearly jokes nobody thinks that he was being serious so with a guy who took them seriously on purpose is Mike Tsarevich so he is a leading all right figure sometimes he says he's all right sometimes he says he's all light I don't really care he's a right winger who revels in this kind of smears and has done it over and over again to people like Sam cedar Patton Oswalt myself and the list goes on so he feigns concern about rape and pedophilia those are his go-to moves so since the jokes of James Gunn were on those topics Mike service pretends to care deeply now let's find out Mike cert which is real opinions on the issues he once wrote rape via an alpha male is different from other forms of rape we can't really understand this as our culture is too detached from instinct so apparently if you consider yourself an alpha male that is a different kind of rape and is what permissible this is the guy pretending to be concerned buckle up I mean we're at the tip of this iceberg I'm going to show you a lot of the iceberg there's way too many outrageous quotes to give you all but it was gonna give you plenty so you get a sense of who this guy is now he makes his own race here he says today we have a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin's rape victims kidding he got got before he was able to rape anyone now why would you presume in the Trayvon Martin who was 17 years old was gonna rape anyone I think the answer is very very obvious but by the way he wrote kitty in the middle of that tweet should everyone fire him from everything ever cuz he just made a rape joke interesting and so almost seems like he's hypocritical to say the least here's him maybe more racial comments not being a slut is the only proven way to avoid aids if you love black women slut-shame them now look there's so many things offensive about that but understand that what he's mainly saying is he's implying that black men have AIDS so you would be helping black woman if you slut-shame them and make sure they don't sleep with black men who presumably have AIDS now you could say oh no and he will oh I meant all men what okay look let's just keep going because there's too much to analyze anyone tweet too much then he goes for anti-semitism I don't know if you've seen this on Twitter but though right was putting three parentheses around Jewish writers names it's just go bow it's called echo he defended of course of course so he says echo exists because people got tired of seeing we white people are evil and oppress blacks speak as Jews not whites honesty okay so he's saying I'm just labeling the Jews because they're not really white and they shouldn't speak for whites okay that's Serna bitch now you might have heard of beet pizza a huge proponent of pizza gate and by the way all he does is lie so in the beginning pizza gate and Podesta and Clinton and they've got a pedophile ring that's his favorite go-to move accused every one of his opponents of being a pedophile see why in a second and then later when a guy goes in and shoots up the place he's like god I never did pizza gate okay here's one of wait actually before I get to that let me give you important on his real views on rape okay so he says do a google image search for a lions mating that's basically rape and it's also the natural form of sex okay so period stop anyone who gets a call for Mike Serta bitch who says oh I have a scoop for you I'm really outraged about rape or pedophilia the correct answer is no thank you hang up okay he did pizza gate he does these conspiracies all the time you're a fool to trust them because even if he gives you the correct tweets he purposely mangles the context and he does it on purpose so any guy who calls me who said that pretending to be concerned about rape the correct answer is immediately hang up why are we having a conversation because people like Disney MSNBC in the Sam cedar situation react and they go oh my god sort of it said something fire someone are you nuts this is one of the worst people on earth more from him he says the hotter the sex the more closely it resembles rape that means and he says he does the he plays a quote anti-rape game oh boy he says after abusing a girl I always immediately send a text and save her reply by the way you're not gonna be shocked to find out that he of course was accused of rape and then he bragged about how he hired a private investigator to go after the victim so that he could get out of the charge okay never went to court on it so not convicted it was able to successfully intimidate the witness and the victim now on to his strategy he says that the right way to go is to create compelling spectacle using conflict use trolling tactics to build his brand alright well we go to those aforementioned trolling tactics in the case of pizza gate he had gone after John Podesta and there was his idea that he was running a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor shop this insanity how does anyone take this guy's call how does anyone take him seriously okay he said pedophile Podesta won't concede tonight thought it was Trump who wouldn't concede hashtag election night now this is a theme that he returns to over and over again then he says salon published Pro pedophilia articles it is platform for pedophiles time to write investors why do they fund money losing company anyone who disagrees with him is a pedophile anyone who supports anyone who disagrees with them supports pedophilia did sell salon write pro pedophilia articles of course not he also accused a BBC of running things that were pro pedophilia why cuz he doesn't like the BBC then he went after by the way conservative publications that didn't agree with him he says the National Review supports pedophilia it doesn't it doesn't matter that is irrelevant as he's going to explain himself in a second then he went after Republican senators that were not sufficiently loyal to Donald Trump including Ben Sasse of Nebraska he said whoa Ben Sasse is paedophile connections keep going deeper on and on and on it's the same MO every single time of the one he used against James Gunn and why did he do it he said oh I didn't like that he was criticizing Donald Trump and they didn't like what the reaction to the actor mark Duplass when he said he likes ben shapiro they're like oh yeah that's it we're gonna destroy you okay well at least you're clear no Jesse sangil had written a piece about him and in New York Magazine and so he struck back against them I hope you're sitting guess what he called him he says I'm 100% sure Jesse single is a sexual predator he has all the tell-tale signs of a date rapist it's no end to it so then but this is the important part he then bragged on Twitter that he's doing it on purpose he wrote jesse single is a sexual predator I can get that on page one of Google in due time now he knows this single is not he just wrote a piece about Serna vich that he didn't like so that's him basically bragging I could ruin this guy's reputation by lying about him as long as I get it into Google one day page one of Google that's what he does and yet people take attacks from him seriously okay he explains his method he says to beat a person you lower his or her social status and what's the best way to lower anyone's social status just call the pedophile call him a sexual predator now if you happen to support those guys who actually are who cares why and if they're not actually sexual predators or pedophiles who cares here's another why here's their another quote from Sirte Mitch well logic is pointless doesn't have to be logical it doesn't have to be true it just has to work and people companies like Disney keep on helping him by saying oh my god I'm so concerned about what like sort of it just found let's go fire someone okay now the anatomy of a hit job Vic burger is a guy who went after him on Twitter so he decided he was gonna go after Vic burger so what does he do of course charges of pedophilia totally unsubstantiated made out of whole cloth like every single time so then big burger says I'm not a child molester as anyone would say and then certain bitch turns that around goes the whiner doth protest too much methinks so you accuse him being a child molester he says I'm not a child molester you go aha so you must be but it works for assault right lunatics who sometimes show up with guns he then goes on that says as they did in the pizza gate situation he says life tip for Vic burger when you have to tell people you're not a child molester you've gone wrong in life please get help now wait a minute you have to constantly tell people that you're not a rapist mike Serna bitch because you've been accused of rape and you have at least half a dozen quotes where you celebrate rape oh you want to explore your life choices and in this case you made up that charge against them you made them deny never you denied it you go examine your life choices I got you okay and then of course on the big burger situation he says there is an active pedophile ring being run on Twitter yes I heard you and got your tips Department of Justice etc under Trump have been alerted and by the way these guys have brown shirts so if you think that the Department of Justice under Trump won't one day act on these so-called tips you might want to think again these are scary times with these monsters that go around and have access to power so now another part of the Mo is if you dare support anyone he has falsely accused you will lump you in with them so as a tweet with a whole bunch of perfectly innocent people who are decent human beings and he writes these are quote-unquote mainstream people all of them came to the defense of an admitted pedophile here and so don't you dare ever defend anyone I have attacked otherwise I will say that you came to the defense of a pedophile and I will smear you and try to get that on page 1 of Google and I'll do my tactics against you now does he know any kind of people who might support pedophilia actually Milo gianopolous lost everything because on Joe Rogan's podcasts he seemed to turn a blind eye to pedophilia so what a certain bitch have to say against him is she gotta be tough against Milo instead he says this Sirte which calls gianopolous one of the only guys other than me who's doing social media right the only guy who actually was involved in a pedophilia scandal I started which is like that guy's got a totally right the ones I've falsely accused how dare you and Matt immediately fire them finally back to the issue of whether Cerner which actually cares about sexual assault one more quote for you said when is the last time women organized the support and men's rights issue stop being and I got a meet it for you because it's word to be used said stop being fags who cares about breast cancer and rape not me that's siRNA which whenever you see an attack against someone you have to do a couple of things because right now I'm afraid and especially the media removes the attack from outside of its context and then by definition makes it deeply misleading I have to say where did the attack come from why did it come and what is the context of it so by the way this happens in politics all the time not into the this degree of you know lies and insanity and the cruelty that sort of it's another all right guys use but they'll do Oppo research and then the media will report it there's a great candidates that will have investigations of them know vestigation ever gets done of their opponent and then people especially in the media will report that one attack of the golf I got look at this one guy it was terrible well how come you didn't investigate the other guys and who asks you to investigate that guy who gave you that information in the first place and oftentimes it is opposition research from other campaigns but Media never tells you that by the way not only Republicans but Democrats do that as well and they most especially do it against progressives so I'm asking you as the audience whenever you see something like this and if you're in the media business for God's sake right the context that's supposed to be your job where did the attack come from and this came it clearly came from the all right why do they do it not because they're actually concerned about any of the issues that James Gunn joked about it's because they think that this is the number way to way to smear him and to get him fired and that the context is not that hey is James Gunn's tweets from 9-10 some 14 years ago a big problem as to what he actually believes no I mean look the Sam cedar case was the perfect case Sam cedar went after a pedophile he went after Roman Polanski but he joked about it in how he went after Roman Polanski's tournaments pretended the Sam cedar was not joking and that was supporting Polanski the exact opposite of what sam cedar was saying so MSNBC fired Sam cedar why because corporations panic oh my god somebody attacked and they fired him and later we all fought back and for that by the way I was also attacked also totally out of context and I'm gonna say one last thing about that NSA but we did defend him and we're defending James Gunn right now because you it is our job to give you that context and I want you in the audience to understand that context and so one last part of the context is when they go to old tweets and they twist them or even if they don't twist them it's because they got nothing else so they went after Sam cedar and twisted a tweet that he wrote to mean the opposite because you think they didn't try to go after Sam cedar in a hundred other ways they did but apparently Sam bless his heart leaves a really boring life and so look you could get almost anybody on anything and all they had on Sam was a twisted tweet that's it nothing for us like at all we're gonna get these guys in the meat to women they call every woman at the Young Turks right they get nothing they look at all of our stuff and man we have tens of thousands of videos they get nothing so what do they do oh I got an idea remember when Genk was a republican he was a prick like us so let's go see if he said things that were bad back in the day so they went and found things from decades ago and things that I had deleted over 10 years ago why not what I got caught but when when I said looked at him I go That's not me and I deleted it right like oh we found them from the wayback machine in the cetera you know what that means guys I don't look it's easy for me to say because this about me but you could say it about any of these guys they went to that because they couldn't get anything else so when you see a charge it isn't about me or Sam or even James Gunn when you see the next charge understand that these guys went and tried to get him on everything and they couldn't and all they could find in the case of James Gunn was really old tweets that doesn't mean that he did any of those things actually ironically it means he didn't Young Turks two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
