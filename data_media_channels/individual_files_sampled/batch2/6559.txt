there was recently a poll done by an organization known as America first policies now by the name you can probably already tell that this is a pro Trump organization and so they specifically spoke to Trump supporters to see how they feel about Trump's policies and what they would like to see in America in the future and even though the questions were leading a pretty significant portion of these Trump voters were actually in favor of socialist policies or leftist policies I should be clear so vice covered this and they wrote using strongly leading language a question about immigration asked respondents if they supported open borders a question on health care ask people whether they would prefer getting rid of fraud and waste in the system to create a whole new health care system the poll actually found that people were more in favor of Republican positions than leftist policies so that's to be expected it these are leading questions they're framing it in a certain way but even so here's what the polling found nineteen percent of these voters again Trump supporters wanted socialism twenty five percent of self-identified Trump supporters wanted to abolish ice okay so let's stop right there I'm a little worried that they mixed up ice with Isis like I don't know like I can't believe that 25% of Trump supporters want to abolish ice that's outrageous that's the you know what that is a really good yeah I said Isis it sounds the same I don't know I mean I'd want to hold them again but based on this twenty five percent of them would want to get rid of ice while twenty four percent thought Medicare should be expanded to everyone so the Medicare part of this was not that surprising to me yes because Medicare is a very popular program and when Trump was campaigning he said over and over again that he wanted to protect Medicare that he wanted to expand Medicare in fact he would go after Democrats and argue that Democrats want to cut Medicare so it doesn't surprise me that his voters a sizable portion of them at least would want to expand the program ya know I you know I think that a lot of people see the value in having their own health coverage and that's something that hits them directly and they feel that impact so immediate and so I think that they understand that we need that value and so that they're okay and going that direction but you know it's one of those it's interesting how we'll get there I just think that politics activism have gone mainstream and everyone has a political point of view and everyone is an activist and quite a few people don't know what they're talking about they don't have the information they get their information from you know whatever links they see on the Internet they go to Twitter or now they go to Fox News things are slanted and it makes me a little bit nervous because those are the people who vote right and so they're not voting on issues I've always been registered independent and I've always voted collectively in the best interest of my people you know women and I just worry that that these people have a voice you know well I'm glad you brought up I'm glad you brought up media because if you if you focus specifically on policy I feel like Americans are way more United rather than divided right so they're of course the more divisive issues maybe immigration is an example of that but when it comes to economic issues when it comes to health care when it comes to Social Security when it comes to wages I think that those are the issues that really do unite us I think that all of us at the end of the day regardless of what our perspectives are on policy we all want the same things right we all want to prosper we want to thrive we want to be able to take care of our families and so and we want peace and there might be disagreements on how we get there but I think the way that the media focuses on the horse race and the way it focuses on the drama and the way it focuses on our differences unfortunately has led to this insane divide that we have and then there's also the the role corporations play they don't want all of these policies they hate these policies and so I think I if we genuinely want the country to do better the media as a whole needs to take a step back and be like okay maybe we don't talk about all of the nonsense and garbage and maybe we focus on what the voters actually want and how similar they can be because either I mean anytime you hear them talking about medicare-for-all they think it's a joke yeah and I think it's like you're absolutely right in terms of the role the media plays in shaping people's viewpoints and actually just misinforming people and just how we see that play out in terms of the policies and the route we take and I've actually given this a lot of thought I think just being a lawyer and just finding this stuff really crazy fascinating because you know we got that First Amendment protection and protecting the media and letting it be an independent body so it can be a check on the government but when it starts to essentially have an incestuous relationship with it and that misleads the people who's gonna be a check on the media and so part of me wonders like is does there need to be an independent government agency how does this work do you need to have some kind of UN set up for media on a worldwide basis that you know issue sanctions or does all sorts of things because we're almost at a point now where well we do have these media conglomerates that are owned by companies and you know everybody's got an agenda and if they can use whatever arms or outlets they can to shift that agenda in a certain direction we can have a lot of problems and we happen to yeah we do have a lot of problems but then there's also this massive disagreement regarding what to do about things like fake news for instance or conspiracy theorists right I mean just look at how controversial the whole Alex Jones thing was I mean there was a lot of disagreement when it came to all these online platforms getting rid of Alex Jones or banning him by the way after he had been warned for years over and over again he just kept violating Terms of Service but people think this is censorship he should be able to you know spread lies propaganda conspiracy theories as much as he wants because if these platforms get rid of him then maybe they'll come for me later and so I don't know what the answer is I do know that I like the fact that Alex Jones was banned and I'll never back down from that I think that he was beyond toxic and he was actually leading or inciting violence toward very specific people and you have that that's not even protected speech under our Constitution but I will say this I do think that I try my best to use my voice for the good side and one thing that I always tell young people is when you get your information good get your information from various places and that way you can make an intelligent decision an assessment about what you're reading about because if you keep going to the same place at the same time then you're just being programmed and you're a robot so that's one thing you can do as an individual because this feels helpless and hopeless sometimes it's really inform yourself so that when you're passionate about something you're also informed and know what you're talking about exactly on the go don't worry we got you covered you can still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
