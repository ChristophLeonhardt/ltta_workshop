I've never been so happy but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel that there is some you should know
I will never forget you
and you will always be by my side
from the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side till the day I die
till the day I die
till the day I die
till the day I die
till the day I die
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright
I wonder what would happen if you went back and put up a fight
Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
from the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side till the day I die
feeling it, loving it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had, something special with you
But sometimes, you gotta know, that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you
feeling it, loving it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had, something special with you
But sometimes, you gotta know, that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
from the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you till the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side till the day I die
