how screwed up how liberal loony how hypocritical is the City of Toronto well how about this apparently in the name of appeasement Toronto is now handing out awards to racists so there was perpetually pissed-off loose Rocco gali co-founder of black lives matter Toronto at Toronto City Hall the other day she was receiving something called B Pam McConnell award for a young woman in leadership Kigali is on something of a winning streak regarding the award circuit after all Toronto City Council officially approved awarding black lives matter Toronto with the William P Hubbard award for race relations back in 2016 no seriously now I don't mean to be rude here but why is the city awarding and applauding someone who dines out on spewing vile racist rhetoric case in point last year a Toronto Sun story by Anthony fury revealed that Kigali argued that white people are quote recessive genetic defects end quote yeah recessive genetic defects I think she conveyed that thought on a social media platform invented by one of those recessive genetic defects oh but there's more Kigali has also purportedly pondered how the white race could be quote wiped out end quote the latter statement being a post on what appears to be her Facebook page so not only is she racist but she has a passion for genocide too fury notes that Kigali appears to have made other odious statements on her Facebook page back in late 2015 now try this one on for size quote whiteness is not humanists in fact white skin is subhuman end quote Wow imagine dealing with her at the shoppers cosmetics counter and the eloquent lady Kigali continues quote white people need white supremacy as a mechanism to protect their survival as a people because all they can do is produce themselves black people simply through their dominant genes can literally wipe out the white race if we had the power to end quote why I do declare Rhett Butler I mean really got a fetish for race-based genocide doesn't she oh let's not forget her lovely tweet from two years ago quote please Allah give me strength to not cuss kill these men and white folk out here today please please please end quote the worst part is she's never apologized for this tweet or any other and what if we did some role reversal here what if Kigali wasn't a Black Muslim female but a white Christian male would she be up for an award more like a hate crime or hate speech charges at least but the bottom line is this people at City Hall surely know about looser acog Ali's racist pronouncements they've been well documented in the popular press yet City Hall still feels obliged to give her awards why well I have two theories number one some of the Looney Tunes at Toronto City Council are actually onside with their beliefs given how trendy it is to speak out against so called white privilege these days and theory number two maybe the people behind these awards actually believe that if you give cranks like Kigali a few trinkets they'll be so smitten and won over that they'll voluntarily put the brakes on their inherent nastiness in other words more carrot less stick well sorry councillors you're not reprogramming anyone here by lauding them for their actions rather than condemning them quite the opposite indeed when you say you approve of someone who is racist and advocates for violence then the likes of Kigali are only going to double down on such vileness because why you've actually done is enable and incentivize people like us raka goalie to be disgusting look I'll frame this in a way that even our spine challenge Mayor John Tory can understand when you go to a Provincial Park you will come across signs that state please don't feed the animals there's a good reason for that for the rebel dog media I'm David the man Zoid Menzies hey folks have you heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
