Rudy Giuliani is technically
off the clock,
and physically
across the globe.
But America’s mayor is very
much in the limelight.
“What is going on
with Rudy Giuliani?”
“Rudy Giuliani is being widely
criticized today
for comments he made
in Israel.”
“Going rogue once again.”
“Rudy Giuliani diverted
from the official lines.”
“And you have to wonder:
Why?”
During a trip to Israel for
a private speaking engagement,
Giuliani, who is now one
of Trump’s private lawyers,
chose to weigh in on an array
of hot-button issues.
First, there was his
explosive account
of how the North Korean
leader apparently
demeaned himself to get
President Trump to reschedule
the summit.
“Well, Kim Jong-un
got back on his hands
and knees and begged for
it, which is exactly
the position you
want to put him in.”
Giuliani also floated a theory
to tarnish the Russia investigation.
“A group of 13 highly
partisan Democrats
that make up the Mueller
team — excluding him —
are trying very, very hard
to frame ,
to get him in trouble when
he hasn’t done anything wrong.”
But Giuliani reserved
the bulk of his fire
for Stormy Daniels,
who has become one of
President Trump’s archenemies.
“I’m sorry.
I don’t respect a
porn star star the way
I respect a career woman.
So, Stormy, you want
to bring a case?
Let me cross-examine you.”
As for Daniels’ alleged affair
with President Trump in 2006,
Giuliani said it was a lie.
“Oh, very, very
credible source: Stormy,
Stormy the porn star.
I don’t believe her.
I don’t know — sue me, Stormy.
I don’t believe you.”
And neither does
Melania Trump,
according to Giuliani.
“She believes in her husband.
She knows it’s not true.
Look at his three wives, right?
Beautiful women, classy women,
women of great substance.
Stormy Daniels?”
“We have to respect
on the stage every woman.”
“Yes, I respect porn stars.
Don’t you respect porn stars?
Or do you think that
porn stars desecrate women?”
One thing that was less
controversial:
Giuliani appeared to be enjoying
his visit to the Holy Land
as cameras spotted
him partaking in some
napkin-spinning revelry
at a Jerusalem hot spot.
