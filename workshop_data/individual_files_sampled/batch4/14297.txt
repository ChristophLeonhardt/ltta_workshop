today is the anniversary of the Lee Rigby murder and the Manchester Arena bombing and the country's response is as cowardly as ever so today is not particularly a nice day it's the anniversary of the murder of Lee Rigby for Americans watching this you might not know he was a soldier who was butchered in the middle of the street by Islamic terrorists they they mowed him down and tried to cut off his head and they told us in the street exactly why they did it is recited verses of the Quran and yet somehow the media tried to tell us that that wasn't the case it's also the first year anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombings were 22 people were killed and ariana grande concert and of course those memorials going on today in Manchester there was a manchester cathedral as a service that Theresa May attended good old Teresa May but there's also a communal sing song it's an event called Manchester together with one voice being held at Albert Square with 3,500 people singing don't look back in anger again don't look back in anger guys you get blown up at concerts have you know terrorists mowing down people and killing children but don't you dare look back in anger and also isn't it fine Theresa May turns up to this memorial service as if she has some deep felt connection with these victims what the hell is her government done about any of the Islamic terror that we've been suffering for ages Theresa May in fact I did a video on this I did a video on this not too long ago and it was about all the terror attacks that have happened since the Westminster Bridge attack we'll put a link in the description we've had a lot of Terror we've had a lot of cases of grooming all kinds of jihad and nothing's been done about it nothing's been to grooming still happening terror attacks still happened we recently had the chief of mi5 telling us that a terrorist has been stopped every month over the last year every month and what's our response from our political leaders well Teresa May turns up for a nice old sing song with the people of Manchester oh great loaded good that's gonna do and then to top this all off there was a film that's just aired on channel 4 called Manchester a year of hate crime what an insult to not only to the people that died not only to the people that hurt not only to that were hurt not only to the families of the people that were hurt and killed and not only to the nation you know a year of hate crime okay first off if there was a surge in hate crime don't you think maybe it's got something to do with the fact that a Muslim terrorist bloom people up maybe but this film told us there's been a year of hate crime and how terrible it's been and then not too long ago the remember the police told us that hate crime doubled in Greater Manchester in the days that followed the terror attack now let me tell you something about these claims about hate crime increasing after terror attacks it sounds convenient doesn't it well I'm telling you it is convenient because it's fake it's a lie I talked about this in my book a paradoxical alliance in Chapter four and I always remember this is I said when a trigger event occurs the New Scotland Yard says the authorities instigate a community engagement plan which quote ensures those in communities who may be victims of hate crime know that we will not tolerate this kind of crime and that we encourage them to report this to the police so what this means is a New Scotland Yard have admitted this when there is a trigger event I don't know say a terror attack when there's a trigger event the police want to make sure that people who might be victims of counter-attacks you know makes maybe someone said something mean to you in the street they want to make sure that these people actually go out and report the crime so it's not a year-long campaign to encourage people to report hate crimes no no no after a trigger event the police will encourage people to come forward and so when this happens what do you think happens with hate crime reporting after a trigger event it increases it's a lie it's a fabrication this is a total live from the politicians from the media and the police and they all seem in on it together and you know I was also sad to see the mother of a man the mother of a man who was killed in this attack saying that love is the only way to conquer terror this is what this is what this kind of behavior from the police from the media from the politicians does to people it makes us weak love can only conquer terror no what good is love doing yeah every time I see a terror attack we have people on the street singing songs and it's you know I can't be too harsh on this because there are children going out and singing these songs children who were at that horrible attack and they're going out singing and you know what hats off it's probably good for the kids it's good for the kids but as a nation when our response to terrorism is to sing don't look back in anger we know we have a problem when the mother the mother of a victim when we see what she well it is she said here when a mother says love is the only way to conquer terror and then she goes on to talk about Islamophobia in this article in the standard mrs. Murray said she would not give in to hatred and fear and rebuked right-wing extremists who have tried to use her son's death to fuel Islamophobia nobody wants to fuel Islamophobia I don't want to fuel an irrational fear of something I don't want to feel anything when I see the murder of these innocent people I don't want to fuel anything I want to stop something I want to stop more people from dying if that makes me Islamophobic then so bloody be it but the fact that we've got a mother of a victim saying this does this not show how weak our society has become does this not show how crippling political correctness has become when people die and all we can do about it is sing on the anniversary of Lee Rigby's murder on the anniversary of the brutal terror attack in Manchester I'm not going to be singing in fact I'm on here ranting right now because I want people to know what the problems are here I want people to know that singing doesn't solve anything love does not conquer terror and by the way we must remember that when the police tell us that hate crime doubles after terror attacks it is a lie it is a fabrication it is verifiably untrue the politicians are working against us the politicians don't give a damn that these things happen the police don't give a damn about what happens to us they're more interested in pushing their Marxist common purpose agenda they don't care about the victims of these crimes and by the way singing don't look back in anger doesn't solve anything if anything today I will be looking back in anger if you like that and want to see more remember to like and subscribe and download the new rebel app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store you
