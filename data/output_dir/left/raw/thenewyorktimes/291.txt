1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,835
Nationality feels so powerful.

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,140
We fight for our country.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,550
We cheer for it.

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,140
We draw our values from it.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,900
It’s a big way many of
us describe who we are,

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,630
but it didn’t used to be.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,630
Up until really recently, our
identities came from stuff

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,220
immediately around us —

9
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,860
clans, religion, family.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,450
If you think about
it, nationality

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,670
is weird, the idea
that you identify

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,430
with millions of strangers
just based on borders.

13
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,476
That’s because national
identity is made up.

14
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:35,232
“U.S.A.!

15
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:36,032
U.S.A.!”

16
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,916
“And then [INAUDIBLE] scores!”

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,150
National identity is the myth
that built the modern world,

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,870
but it also primes us for
dictatorship, racism, genocide.

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,930
And today, we’re fighting
over whether to keep

20
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,800
that kind of national identity.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,154
To understand why, you have
to see how new this idea is.

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,160
So you think you
know what France is.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,080
It’s a place united
by the French language

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,209
and the French ethnicity, right?

25
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,580
But as of the French
Revolution, half of the people

26
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,170
there could not speak French.

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,910
Only one in eight spoke it well.

28
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,800
These are the languages
that people spoke,

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,680
just a patchwork that
didn’t line up with borders.

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,350
We know from modern genetics
that ethnicity didn’t line up

31
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,120
with borders, either.

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,590
National identity
became the idea

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,090
that language, race, and borders
should add up to a country.

34
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,010
Nations can’t admit
they’re made up,

35
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,810
so they invent a
national mythology

36
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,025
that says they’ve been
like this forever.

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,180
The modern era brought
four big changes

38
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,400
that led to national identity.

39
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,640
People moved in big numbers
from the country to the city,

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,480
and they needed a
common language.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,435
New technology, like
newspapers and trains,

42
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:50,601
made countries feel smaller
and more interconnected.

43
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,794
War was changing into this
vast all-consuming thing.

44
00:01:54,794 --> 00:01:56,210
Countries needed
people that cared

45
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,700
so much about 
their nation,

46
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,675
they’d fight for it 
in huge numbers.

47
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,650
Governments were challenging
religion for power.

48
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,780
Here’s Napoleon taking
his crown from the pope

49
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,980
to crown himself emperor.

50
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,936
It was a big deal.

51
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,420
These four things sparked an
era of revolutions in democracy,

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,370
but they also unleashed ideas
of nationalism, militarism,

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,780
and leader worship.

54
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
People came to see
their countries

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,710
as extensions of themselves.

56
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,500
This new identity meant that
a nation got its authority,

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,170
not from the government,
or the King, or God,

58
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,790
but from the people.

59
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,792
This changed the world, but
it also changed how we think.

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,380
National identity
changes our reality.

61
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,720
We experience whatever
happens to our nation

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,327
as if it happened to us.

63
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,550
“Rocky IV” can tell us a lot
about what national identity

64
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,390
does to our brains.

65
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,670
“The Russian towers
above the American.”

66
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,760
A 1994 study tested the
attitudes of Americans

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,660
watching the movie.

68
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,430
It includes an amazing footnote.

69
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,720
All 216 participants were
women because, quote,

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,200
“There were no males who
had not seen ‘Rocky IV.’”

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,070
Anyway —

72
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,270
When Rocky beat his
Russian opponent,

73
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,890
participants who strongly
identified as American

74
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,908
felt a boost in self-esteem.

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,610
When they were shown
re-edited footage

76
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,260
to make it look like Rocky lost,
they felt a drop in self-esteem

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,260
and they became likelier to hold
negative views about Russians.

78
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,360
But when they said something
bad about Russians,

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,680
their self-esteem recovered.

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,380
When we feel
threatened, it makes

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,730
us want to humiliate and
dominate the outsider.

82
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,070
That dynamic doesn’t just
apply to individuals.

83
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,003
It can apply to whole societies.

84
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:44,560
This can drive war, itself.

85
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,870
One study found that
any country whose team

86
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,330
plays in the World
Cup becomes likelier

87
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,560
to launch attacks abroad.

88
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,710
That hostility also plays out
against minorities and migrants

89
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,470
who don’t fit the national myth.

90
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,220
It only took a century for these
problems of modern nationalism

91
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,570
to culminate into World War II, 
something so terrible,

92
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:11,274
it convinced the world to try a
new kind of national identity.

93
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:15,474
(SINGING) “Great American
melting pot.”

94
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:18,630
This model of identity is based
on an idea from the United

95
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,649
States.

96
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,200
Anyone can be American
if you share values

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,940
like freedom and hard work.

98
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,480
“May I please remind you
that it does not say

99
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,616
RSVP on the Statue of Liberty.”

100
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,540
It’s a stirring idea, but
it never completely worked.

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,115
“Your race is your nation.”

102
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:39,510
“If you don’t speak English
and don’t contribute, get out!”

103
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,730
The belief that being
American is really

104
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,650
about race, religion,
and language

105
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,420
also runs throughout history.

106
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,250
So what makes a country?

107
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,800
Which identity should matter?

108
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,620
That fight defines so much
of the world right now.

109
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,270
And it’s intensified.

110
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,610
You see it in the backlash
to the European Union.

111
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,320
“We’ve got our country back.”

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,030
You see it in how Donald
Trump began his campaign.

113
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,850
“We either have a
country or we don’t,

114
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,750
and it’s that simple.”

115
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,040
The national myth is powerful.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,940
We fight for a common
past and a common future.

117
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,630
It isn’t real, but
that doesn’t matter.

118
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,040
We’ve been taught for so
long that this is who we are.

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,500
Building a world
based on shared values

120
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,920
really means
creating a new myth.

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:00:00,000
But that only works if it feels
as powerful as the last one.
