come on England all the way
I made it just in time it's one mad rush
and the people absolutely love you
it's been some bad press for example
talking about hooligans in Russia then
attack the English and about the
poisoning England in Iraq so what were
the things that you were hearing about
Russia before I came here I'm safe like
it's like it's like scary ish but
through lots of em nice place everyone
gosh go friendly you get favored with
his bad press it was starting to believe
it but once people realize this is not
the case
they're out if we've got another page we
want to go over in the world and enjoy
the world and everybody's heard that
nice it is they want to come over
but yeah we speak to them pretty much
every day and we see them after the
games as well you'll remember the case
with Danny grows when it buys members of
his family not to come to Russia because
impossible racism something like that
having been here a week you have
anything to say about them yeah I think
that whatever was said before has
completely been overruled by all my
experience in this week we've had
absolutely no problem
people like Matt have been fantastic
they've been food has been great the
beers been great and I look forward to
coming back again another time Thank You
Russia Spyder possible
you still got time England fans coming
back to Russia he's coming home
you
