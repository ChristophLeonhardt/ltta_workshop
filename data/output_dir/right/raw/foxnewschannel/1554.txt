1
00:00:00,675 --> 00:00:01,642
AND GREG GUTFELD.

2
00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:02,677
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

3
00:00:02,677 --> 00:00:09,650
THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,219
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING TWO

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,053
MAJOR ISSUES TODAY WHILE MEETING

6
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:12,920
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,823
SOUTH KOREA, INCLUDING HIS

8
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:16,557
SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN LEADER

9
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:16,958
KIM JONG UN.

10
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,025
WE WILL GET TO HIS COMMENTS ON

11
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:20,294
THAT IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST THE

12
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,796
PRESIDENT IS COMMENTING FOR THE

13
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:25,032
FIRST TIME ON CAMERA ABOUT AN

14
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:25,800
FBI INFORMANT COMMUNICATING WITH

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,236
ASSOCIATES OF HIS CAMPAIGN.

16
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,805
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING

17
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,240
THEY HAD SPIES IN MY CAMPAIGN.

18
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,741
I HOPE THERE WEREN'T, FRANKLY.

19
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,210
BUT SOME MAN GOT PAID BASED ON

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,046
WHAT I READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS.

21
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:39,680
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,548
JUSTICE WANTS TO GET DOWN TO IT

23
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,583
AND I CAN TELL YOU CONGRESS

24
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:42,884
DOES.

25
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:45,486
IF THEY HAD SPIES IN MY

26
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:48,055
CAMPAIGN, DURING MY CAMPAIGN FOR

27
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:48,990
POLITICAL PURPOSES, THAT WOULD

28
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,391
BE UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY

29
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:51,726
OF OUR COUNTRY.

30
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:53,728
>> Dana: 'S MENTOR

31
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,997
CHUCK SCHUMER SAYING THESE MOVES

32
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:57,999
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE

33
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,835
INFORMANT ATTEMPT TO OBSTRUCT

34
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:04,638
THE INVESTIGATION.

35
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:05,306
>> DEMANDS FOR OVERSIGHT ARE

36
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:10,144
TANTAMOUNT TO INTERFERENCE.

37
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,580
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FOLKS

38
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,347
DEMANDING THE INFORMATION ARE

39
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:16,717
THE MOST BIASED, IRRESPONSIBLE

40
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:20,254
ACTORS, A MAN LIKE DEVIN NUNES,

41
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,589
WHO I HEAR PRIVATELY FOR MY

42
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:23,691
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THINK HE

43
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:24,258
IS OFF THE DEEP END.

44
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,460
>> Dana: ALL RIGHT.

45
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,894
I DON'T KNOW.

46
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:29,363
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF STUFF GOING

47
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:29,730
ON.

48
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,833
HERE'S A QUESTION, KIMBERLY.

49
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,302
THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER IS

50
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:38,439
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO

51
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,641
DECLASSIFY ALL THESE DOCUMENTS.

52
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,676
WITHOUT BE A GOOD IDEA?

53
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:44,245
>> Kimberly: I'M GLAD THAT WAS

54
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:44,812
THE FIRST QUESTION.

55
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,247
IT'S FASCINATING AND THERE ARE A

56
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,282
LOT OF PEOPLE CALLING FOR IT,

57
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:49,650
SAYING LET'S GO COMPLETE

58
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,685
TRANSPARENCY, DECLASSIFY THE

59
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,720
DOCUMENTS, END.

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,455
ALL OTHER SO THERE ISN'T THIS

61
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,856
LEAKING THIS AND LEAKING THAT.

62
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,258
BITS AND PIECES OUT.

63
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,292
SHOW THE WHOLE FRAMEWORK AND

64
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,894
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO

65
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:00,261
DID WHAT.

66
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,662
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN

67
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,998
PEOPLE NEED AT THIS POINT

68
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,966
INSTEAD OF LIKE DRIP FROM THE

69
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:05,499
FAUCET COMING DOWN.

70
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:06,734
PUT IT ALL OUT THERE, AND THEN

71
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:09,036
WE WILL KNOW.

72
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:11,138
>> Dana: WHAT DO YOU THINK,

73
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:12,273
BRIAN?

74
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:14,108
>> Brian: A LEGAL EXPERT WILL

75
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:15,242
SAY THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE

76
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,211
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE SOMEBODY

77
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:17,945
INSIDE RUSSIA THAT WE ARE

78
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:19,146
DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

79
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,048
HELPING US TODAY.

80
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,050
I WOULD SAY IF YOU ARE DOING A

81
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,918
COUNTERTERROR OPERATION, WHY

82
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,785
DON'T YOU START WITH THE PEOPLE

83
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,054
THAT ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

84
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,456
INFILTRATE, THE RUSSIANS.

85
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,257
SHOW SOME GUTS, GO TO RUSSIAN

86
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,859
ESTIMATES GOING ON.

87
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:33,661
OR USE YOUR CONTACTS TO FIND OUT

88
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:34,829
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

89
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,297
INSTEAD YOU'RE GOING UP TO THESE

90
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:37,665
ANCILLARY PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP

91
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:39,266
CAMPAIGN AND NOBODY SAYS THEY

92
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,101
ARE MAJOR PLAYERS.

93
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,436
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT SOMEBODY

94
00:02:42,436 --> 00:02:44,238
MIGHT HAVE WHISPERED TO THEM IN

95
00:02:44,238 --> 00:02:45,106
A DRUNKEN CONVERSATION.

96
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,708
FOR PEOPLE TO SAY, LIKE

97
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,309
CHUCK SCHUMER, IT'S

98
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,544
IRRESPONSIBLE TO ALLOW THESE

99
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,246
PEOPLE TO FIND OUT WHO HAS

100
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:56,083
INFILTRATED YOUR CAMPAIGN.

101
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,251
IF ANYONE INFILTRATED

102
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:58,185
CHUCK SCHUMER'S CAMPAIGN, THEY

103
00:02:58,185 --> 00:02:59,587
WOULDN'T SAY THE FBI WAS ALLOWED

104
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,289
TO HAVE THEIR SOURCES.

105
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,658
I DON'T BLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP

106
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:05,126
FOR BEING OUTRAGED, TO FIND OUT

107
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:06,093
WHAT WAS GOING ON ARE NOT GOING

108
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,997
ON WITH THIS CAMBRIDGE

109
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,565
PROFESSOR.

110
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,266
I DON'T BLAME HIM FOR FINDING

111
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:18,506
OUT CARTER PAGE, AND CAPUTO,

112
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,541
WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THESE

113
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,509
GUYS.

114
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,210
THE ONLY THING AT STAKE IS HIS

115
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,479
PRESIDENCY AND HOW LONG HE STAYS

116
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,013
PRESIDENCY AND HOW LONG HE STAY

117
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:26,681
STAYS.

118
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,650
>> Dana: JUAN, LET ME ASK YOU.

119
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,619
THE IDEA THAT IF THE DEEP STATE,

120
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,988
IF WE ARE CALLING IT BACK, WAS

121
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:35,489
SO DETERMINED TO HURT

122
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,457
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT ABOUT THE

123
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,125
DEMOCRATS FEELING LIKE THEY

124
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:38,759
ACTUALLY HURT CLINTON MORE

125
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,229
BECAUSE THEY KEPT THE FBI

126
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,264
INVESTIGATION INTO THE TRUMP

127
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,165
CAMPAIGN UNDER WRAPS BUT WERE

128
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,733
MORE FORTHCOMING IN THE PRESS

129
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,636
ABOUT QUENTIN.

130
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:49,570
>> Juan: IT CONTRADICTS THE

131
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,705
WHOLE FLOOR WHAT YOU ARE SEEN

132
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:54,442
COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT.

133
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,977
THE CAMPAIGN THAT WAS HURT BY

134
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,913
THE FBI WAS THE CLINTON

135
00:03:58,913 --> 00:03:59,280
CAMPAIGN.

136
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,248
THERE WAS NO DAMAGE DONE TO

137
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:02,283
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.

138
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,984
IN FACT, SOME PEOPLE ARE ARGUING

139
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,886
THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE

140
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,988
CONDUCTING COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

141
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:08,856
OPERATIONS AS OPPOSED TO A

142
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,291
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, THEY

143
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,560
WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PROTECT

144
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,895
AND TRY TO ACT AS A BUFFER TO

145
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,130
KEEP THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE OUT

146
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,665
OF ALL THE CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING

147
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:18,833
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

148
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,668
I THINK WHAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW

149
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:23,671
IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION,

150
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:26,173
DANA, AN EFFORT BY THE

151
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:27,074
PRESIDENT.

152
00:04:27,074 --> 00:04:28,209
I THINK IT'S UNPRECEDENTED TO

153
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:31,045
SORT OF WEAPONIZED INVESTIGATION

154
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:33,280
INTO THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIM.

155
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,648
>> Dana: ISN'T WEAPONIZING,

156
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,584
GREG, IF IT IS THE JUSTICE

157
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:38,352
DEPARTMENT SAYING WE HAVE AN

158
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,320
INSPECTOR GENERAL HOWEVER ONE

159
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,855
SEEMS TO SUPPORT, MICHAEL

160
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:41,989
HOROWITZ, BECAUSE HE IS A FAIR

161
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:42,256
GUY.

162
00:04:42,256 --> 00:04:43,257
HE SAYS HE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT

163
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:43,891
IT.

164
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,159
CAN WE LET IT PLAY OUT?

165
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,661
COULD BE MONTHS.

166
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,231
>> Greg: WHAT IS RUSSIAN FOR

167
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:50,731
MEXICAN STANDOFF?

168
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:56,137
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

169
00:04:56,137 --> 00:05:00,508
I SEE THE OPPOSITE.

170
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,109
HILLARY'S INVESTIGATION WAS PUT

171
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,979
IN THE PRESS TO HELP HER.

172
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:05,846
REMEMBER WHAT COMEY SAID, HAVE

173
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:06,947
TO GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY

174
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:08,883
BECAUSE IF SHE WINS AND IT COMES

175
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,050
OUT, WE LOOK REALLY BAD.

176
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,986
SO LET'S HELP HER.

177
00:05:11,986 --> 00:05:13,287
TRUMP WAS KEPT UNDER WRAPS

178
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,155
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATCH

179
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:14,688
THEM.

180
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,190
WHY IS THIS ONE KNOWN.

181
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,793
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT ANYWAY.

182
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:19,560
>> Dana: OR BECAUSE THEY

183
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,463
THOUGHT HE WASN'T GOING TO WIN.

184
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,732
>> Greg: YOU WILL GO BACK TO

185
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:31,438
THE LAUREL AND YANNY.

186
00:05:31,438 --> 00:05:34,041
WHICH COLLUSION STORY IS MORE

187
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,475
PERSUASIVE.

188
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:35,910
THE STORY, IT'S BEEN GOING ON

189
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,112
FOR 18 MONTHS.

190
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:41,849
ON THE OTHER SIDE, FBI, HOWEVER,

191
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:43,851
DEMOCRATS, BRITISH BUY.

192
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:46,053
ONE INFORMANT, MAY BE TWO.

193
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,189
IF YOU COMPARE THESE TWO SIDES,

194
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,524
YOU HAVE ONE WITH A MEETING

195
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,326
ABOUT THE MISSING SKI

196
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,665
ACT YOU HAVE A DOSSIER PAID FOR

197
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:58,065
BY HILLARY.

198
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,267
YOU HAVE BEEN INFORMANT, MAY BE

199
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,869
TWO, PLACED AS A FAVOR.

200
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:04,238
YOU HAVE THE PRESS PLAYING IT

201
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:04,538
DOWN.

202
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,674
YOU HAVE THE DOSSIER CONTENTS

203
00:06:06,674 --> 00:06:07,641
LEAKED.

204
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,777
WE START COMPARING THESE THINGS,

205
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:10,544
ONE IS MAKING MORE SENSE THAN

206
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,513
THE OTHER.

207
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:16,050
>> Juan: I THINK YOU WOULD --

208
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,152
I THINK YOU ARE GOING DOWN THE

209
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:18,552
RABBIT HOLE.

210
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,654
>> Greg: WE HAVE BEEN GOING

211
00:06:20,654 --> 00:06:21,455
DOWN FOR 18 MONTHS.

212
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:24,425
EXCUSE ME IF I FIND ANOTHER

213
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,660
RABBIT HOLE.

214
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,828
>> Brian: "WASHINGTON POST"

215
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,664
BEGAN TO LEAK OUT INFORMATION TO

216
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:31,565
MAYBE GET A HEAD TO LET US KNOW

217
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:36,270
THERE'S A RABBIT HOLE.

218
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,038
I THINK ALAN DERSHOWITZ NAILED

219
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,074
IT WHEN HE SAID I DON'T CARE OF

220
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,508
IT IS THE '98 CLINTON

221
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:45,279
INVESTIGATION, NOW THE 2016

222
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,880
CLINTON-TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

223
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,814
YOU'LL NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM

224
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:52,353
OF IT AS LONG AS IT IS THIS TYPE

225
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:52,853
OF OPERATION.

226
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:55,055
WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE 9/11

227
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:56,857
COMMISSION TO GET ANSWERS,

228
00:06:56,857 --> 00:06:58,692
PUBLISH THE RESULTS BECAUSE IT

229
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,060
DID NOT EFFECT THE ELECTION.

230
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,862
YOU JUST FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG

231
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:04,098
TO STOP THE NEXT PROBLEM BECAUSE

232
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:05,766
THIS HORSE IS OUT OF THE BARN

233
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,568
AND NO ONE EVEN SAW THE HORSE.

234
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:08,802
>> Juan: I THINK THE PROBLEM,

235
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:12,072
FIRST OF ALL, THIS LATEST EFFORT

236
00:07:12,072 --> 00:07:15,209
TO SOMEHOW SAY I HEREBY DEMAND,

237
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,978
LIKE HE'S NOT PRESIDENT BUT SOME

238
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:18,646
AUTHORITARIAN RULER.

239
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,082
I HEREBY DEMAND.

240
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,852
WHAT HAPPENED, GREG, IMMEDIATELY

241
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:25,452
ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY

242
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,054
ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID OKAY, I'M

243
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:27,788
GOING TO DO THIS.

244
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,857
THE QUESTION IS HE TRYING TO

245
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:32,059
APPEASE THE PRESIDENT OR SEE

246
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:33,294
FOLLOWING ORDERS?

247
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,695
>> Greg: YOU ARE OBSESSING

248
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:35,663
OVER WORDS.

249
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,865
I HEREBY -- SOUNDS LIKE

250
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:38,599
KING ARTHUR'S CASTLE.

251
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,467
>> Juan: SURE DOES.

252
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:41,902
SOUNDS LIKE A KING, NOT THE

253
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:42,870
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

254
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,871
YOU ARE NORMALIZING THIS KIND OF

255
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,873
ABUSE OF A POWER WHILE THE

256
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,008
PRESIDENT IS UNDER A SPECIAL

257
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:48,442
INVESTIGATION.

258
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,009
>> Brian: WHAT I THINK

259
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,448
EVERYONE IS MISSING.

260
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:55,783
TRUMP HIRED THIS FOREIGN POLICY

261
00:07:55,783 --> 00:07:57,651
COUNCIL HE GOT ON THE BACK OF A

262
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,521
CHEERIOS BOX THEY GO OUT AND DO

263
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,058
THEIR THING AND SOMEHOW THEY

264
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:04,992
AREN'T TARGETED BY THIS

265
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:05,359
INFORMANT.

266
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,063
>> Dana: THE GOVERNMENT TOLD

267
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:09,830
THEM THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO

268
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,267
TRY TO DO THIS.

269
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:13,634
THEY KNEW.

270
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,436
THE PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN

271
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:18,105
COMMODE WE KNOW THEY HAVE THESE

272
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:18,472
CONTACTS.

273
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:20,040
MICKEY MOUSE WHATEVER DRUNKEN

274
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,708
THINGS.

275
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,875
THOSE WEREN'T DISCLOSED,

276
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,644
KIMBERLY, SO THEN YOU HAVE THIS

277
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:24,011
QUESTION.

278
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:30,250
I AGREE, THE LAUREL AND YANNY

279
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,551
THING.

280
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,285
12 HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE ASKING

281
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:35,289
FOR A SECOND SPECIAL COUNSEL.

282
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,658
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS SO MUCH

283
00:08:37,658 --> 00:08:38,458
LONGER AND LEAD THE SHOW EVERY

284
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,294
DAY FOR THE NEXT TEN MONTHS,

285
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,528
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO DO IT.

286
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:44,465
>> Greg: YOU ARE SAYING KEEP

287
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,300
GOING WITH THIS OTHER

288
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,967
INVESTIGATION WE WILL KEEP

289
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,334
SAYING --

290
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,770
>> Dana: I AM SAYING RELEASE

291
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,672
ALL THE DOCUMENTS TOMORROW.

292
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,574
>> Greg: YOU SHOULD ALSO SAY

293
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,575
IF THEY THINK THIS IS JUST AS

294
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,311
IMPORTANT, THEN IT'S JUST AS

295
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:57,678
IMPORTANT.

296
00:08:57,678 --> 00:08:59,480
>> Kimberly: WE CONCUR ON THAT

297
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,948
THEY SHOULD RELEASE THE

298
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:01,815
DOCUMENTS.

299
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,417
I THINK WE WILL THEN GET ANOTHER

300
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:03,884
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

301
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,986
LET'S HAVE THE IG REPORT, HAVE

302
00:09:05,986 --> 00:09:06,587
THE DOCUMENTS RELEASED,

303
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,822
CERTAINLY WITHIN THE POWER AND

304
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:09,823
AUTHORITY OF THE PRESIDENT OF

305
00:09:09,823 --> 00:09:10,457
THE PRESIDENT OF THE

306
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:11,458
UNITED STATES TO DO SO.

307
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,093
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S TRYING TO

308
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:13,560
HIDE SOMETHING.

309
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,062
HE IS THING LET'S PUT IT ALL OUT

310
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,463
THERE AND AS IT RELATES TO ANY

311
00:09:16,463 --> 00:09:17,865
PEOPLE WE HAVE OPERATING THE

312
00:09:17,865 --> 00:09:19,299
THEATER THEY COULD RECOVER MOST,

313
00:09:19,299 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU CAN REDACT THEIR NAMES.
