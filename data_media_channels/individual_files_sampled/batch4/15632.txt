Hollywood hottie gal gadot is in Hollywood hot water Millennials are crisis in Trump makes a very bad Pinocchio to Russia's Geppetto very intriguing huh all of that today on the rebel buzz you know we pro-israel gals in Hollywood sure do have a tough time now I'm speaking about one specific gal gal gadot who was ripped up and down twitter this week for a very innocent statement about the passing of famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking now naturally this isn't anything new for her she's been in hot Hollywood water in the past for her support of Israel because Hollywood is all about Palestinians and I guarantee you they can't even tell you why but this time she's been deemed ablest by her peers in la-la land in a tweet posted on Wednesday she said rest in peace dr. Hawking now you're free of any physical constraints your brilliance and wisdom will be cherished forever now a very complimentary and by the way gracious tweet considering Hawking has been very critical of her homeland he supported the BDS movement and frequently condemned the Israeli military's actions and self-defense and yet during all of this ironically Hawking failed to mention that technology developed by Israeli scientists for the Israeli branch of Intel is what actually allowed him to function and communicate via his computer program and equipment I can't believe he didn't mention that now responses to gal gadot's tweet are going to absolutely blow your mind this is why we can't have nice things people okay a tweet from the account of a B's M said let's take a look at this I think you're fantastic gal but this tweet is very ablest his physical constraints didn't stop him from changing the world people with disabilities don't wish for death to be freed of their challenges we wish to be valued for what we can do not pitied for what we can't all right first of all dude come on I don't think any sane individual would view that as gal gadot suggesting that Hawking wished for death second of all Hawking was valued for his accomplishments and discoveries but this guy a B Zim was not finished he then tweeted you look at this that sentiment affects me personally it affects all people with disabilities because it impacts how we are perceived the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is 70 to 80 percent and the idea that disabilities are scary things to be freed from is a big reason why who what how what who said anything about them being scary by the way his profile header says member of the resistance and bringer of the funny sorry bro nothing funny about your overly sensitive victim Derby tendencies to criticize what should have been viewed as a very heartfelt tribute speaking of overly sensitive over half of Millennials in a recent survey reported that they feel they are going through a quarter life crisis are you freaking kidding me maybe it's because you're a bunch of mushy brained tender-hearted jelly spine wimps who complained about everything and act on virtually nothing famed philosopher just kidding she's musician Melissa Etheridge once sang a song about how the only thing that stays the same is changed but I don't really think that's any longer true these kids won't change they don't know how to change themselves or their circumstances they just scream bloody murder at the sky and take selfies and chomp down on Tide Pods the only time I think they've ever truly felt like they've done something wrong is when they accidentally like their exes new boyfriends Instagram picture from 21 weeks ago now that is catastrophic and life-changing because you're busted now the survey said the study surveyed 2000 people between the ages of 25 and 35 years old the study found that 56% of respondents feel that they are struggling with financial career and personal pressures newsflash that's life that's not a crisis welcome to the real world which reminds me of a song called real world by day all-american rejects I don't know if you guys remember them but yeah the all-american rejects kind of an ironic band name considering the subject of his survey now I think that they should make a new music video using images after Trump's election especially for the part of the song that says at first we learn to walk then we learn to scream you can't understand when you're fed from a TV screen those are the real lyrics how timely right 53 percent of those surveyed also reported difficulty in making ends meet and 1/3 revealed that their living situation has left them with feelings of despair wait you mean living in your parents basement at age 28 doesn't make you feel like you're an accomplished individual yeah I guess air mattress technology hasn't advanced enough well Millennials here's a little PSA for you there's always something that you can do to improve your situation get a job and if your degree is something like East African Gender Studies and you can't find that coveted job pertaining to it get a job anyway you can always do something to make your life better and if nothing else makes someone else's life better volunteer it'll teach you hard work and reward without fiscal compensation and that's that's a great deal of value so to wrap up the buzz today let's talk about Russia's puppetry skills when it comes to Trump they're lacking to say the least if President Trump is a puppet for Russia whoever is pulling the strings in Moscow well they should be fired apprentice TV show style you're fired so here are some of the things these are just a few things that have happened in just the last few days alone the united states treasury imposed economic sanctions on over 20 individuals and entities for cyberattacks and meddling during the 2016 election nikki Haley condemned Russia at the UN while the Trump administration accused Russia of deliberate operation to penetrate our energy grid that would be bad let me tell you and we issued a joint statement with France UK and Germany saying the Russians were likely responsible for the chemical attack on against a former spy in Britain so it kind of kills that whole minute of Russian puppetry narrative right and that doesn't even include the 47 million dollar arms package that President Trump approved for Ukraine or the troops that he sent to poland's border with russia remember what Obama told Mitt Romney that joke that didn't age so well about how the 80s called and they want their foreign policy back yeah maybe Obama shouldn't have been so flexible with the Rooskies and we wouldn't be in this position so
