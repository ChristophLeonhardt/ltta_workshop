1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,986
- I'm a guy who went to Russia
to run an investment fund,

2
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:05,464
I discovered corruption, I exposed it,

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,011
and I fell out with the regime.

4
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:09,761
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,051
- So we have a lot to talk about.

6
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:17,272
Over the last few days
we've seen some incredible,

7
00:00:17,272 --> 00:00:19,876
incredible news from Russia and the UK,

8
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:21,568
all around the United States,

9
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:23,501
about violence at the
hands of Putin's regime

10
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,059
which you've experienced.

11
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,124
In the UK, a former Soviet
spy and his daughter

12
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:31,587
were attacked using a nerve
gas that we haven't seen

13
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:33,214
since World War II.

14
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:37,797
We have a ally of Boris
Berezovsky mysteriously killed.

15
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:42,564
And now we have new sanctions
against the Russian government

16
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:45,481
from the United States, UK, France.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,938
Give us your take on this,
what should we expect to see

18
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:52,482
and what does this mean that
is going through Putin's head,

19
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:55,058
and what is happening in Russia right now?

20
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:58,370
- First of all, let's put
something in perspective.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,781
Russia is at the headlines of
almost every different issue.

22
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:06,892
This is a country with an economy
the size of New York state

23
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:10,239
so this is not because
they're an economic superpower

24
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,801
that they're doing all this kind of stuff,

25
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,380
this is because Vladimir
Putin is effectively

26
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,199
the biggest criminal in the world.

27
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,294
He's a Mafia boss and
he's going around doing

28
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:20,926
Mafia techniques in
international relations

29
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,984
and he's gotten everybody's attention.

30
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,085
And part of the reason
he's doing this is that

31
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,446
he needs to distract everybody in Russia

32
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:30,160
from the problems that
are going on in Russia.

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,042
And so he's just poking
at every different thing

34
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,922
and creating all this
crisis and controversy.

35
00:01:35,922 --> 00:01:39,333
- You spearheaded the Magnitsky
Act which some Russians,

36
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,886
I think, blame for part of
their economic situation.

37
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:47,240
Can you explain what you've
done, how you did it, and why?

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,714
- So first of all, who am I?

39
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:53,064
I'm a guy who went to Russia
to run an investment fund,

40
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:55,402
I discovered corruption, I exposed it,

41
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:58,295
and I fell out with the
regime and in retaliation

42
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:00,826
they kicked me out of the
country, they raided my offices,

43
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,429
they seized my investment
holding companies

44
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,720
and used them to steal 230
million dollars in taxes

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,500
that I paid to the Russian government.

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,602
A young lawyer named Sergei
Magnitsky discovered the crime,

47
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:14,715
exposed it and he was
subsequently arrested,

48
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:19,191
tortured for 358 days, and
killed at the age of 37

49
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:20,941
on November 16, 2009.

50
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:25,232
Since then, I've been on a
mission to get justice for Sergei

51
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,144
and that's led to a piece of legislation

52
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,728
here in the United States
called the Magnitsky Act,

53
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:32,890
which freezes the assets
and bans the visas of people

54
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,152
who killed Sergei and people
who do similar types of things.

55
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:38,622
The Magnitsky Act is now in
seven countries around the world

56
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:41,620
and Putin hates it with all of his heart.

57
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,832
Why does he hate it?

58
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:46,060
Because Putin has stolen
an enormous amount of money

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,658
and he's killed a lot of
people in the process.

60
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:51,130
And he understands, rightfully so,

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,147
that the money that he's
stolen which he keeps

62
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,920
in Western banks could be
seized under the Magnitsky Act.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,137
And so as a result, he's
made it his single largest

64
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,272
foreign policy priority to
repeal the Magnitsky Act.

65
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:04,889
He stated that publicly.

66
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:08,057
- So why do Putin's cronies
hate Magnitsky so much?

67
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,718
- So normally when you go into government,

68
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:12,356
in a regular country, you
go in to serve the country

69
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,004
and serve the people of the country.

70
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:17,518
In Russia, people go into
government to effectively become

71
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:22,518
sub capos or Mafia bosses of
different areas of the economy,

72
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,357
and they steal an
enormous amount of money.

73
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:27,476
And every different government official is

74
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:31,169
spectacularly rich but as
much as they steal that money

75
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,577
in Russia they don't feel
comfortable keeping it in Russia.

76
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:35,089
They want to keep it in the West.

77
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,449
And because they keep it in the West,

78
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,907
all that money is exposed
and then the whole purpose

79
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,827
of going into government,
where they've spent all this

80
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:43,547
time and energy stealing
money and terrorizing people,

81
00:03:43,547 --> 00:03:45,904
is all for naught, all that
hard work is for naught

82
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,029
if that money gets frozen.

83
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,662
And so for them...

84
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,390
And I should point out that
these people value money

85
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,868
over human life and therefore,

86
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,705
it's so crucial to them
that their money is safe

87
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:58,630
and if their money's not safe
then they feel very angry.

88
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,388
And they're particularly angry
at the guy who created the

89
00:04:01,388 --> 00:00:00,000
Magnitsky Act to make their
money unsafe, which is me.
