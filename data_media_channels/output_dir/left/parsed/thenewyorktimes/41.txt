In 2007 charlie bit my finger became one of the most watched youtube videos ever
Everyone saw this video from your fun aunt to Osama bin Laden
And it launched a whole genre of Internet content
Parents unexpectedly capturing their kids doing hilariously
adorable things
Adults have always been captivated by kids. Duh. They are cute
But as the internet
professionalized the cute kid genre morphed into something new
Now the Internet is producing kid makeup artists kid power eaters and kid parody music video stars
And then there are kids whose parents just film everything they do
One of YouTube's most popular channels is run by the Shaytards a YouTube family of seven that lives by the motto
But most of the time life is pretty boring

In order to make a living on YouTube you have to push out content really consistently, but that content also needs to be
exciting for
YouTube family that means making normal everyday life into something that feels
Sensational and no YouTube couple has pushed the limits of the family genre more than Sam and Mia
The first time Sam and Nia Rayder went viral was in 2014 when they installed a dashcam on their minivan
Dubbed themselves the good-looking parents and lip synced a song from frozen
the second time Sam in the year went viral was when Sam
Extracted Mia's pee from an unflushed toilet and then announced his wife's surprise pregnancy
to her
At least that's what they said happened
This is the part where I try to think of what's not so bad about this trend
Okay, so these family vloggers show the messy negative parts of parenting
Not just the idyllic cutesy stuff
They've helped to open up
Conversations about infertility and miscarriages that are often taboo in the mainstream and some parents have always treated their kids like commodities
But on the Internet that impulse can be blown up and popularized on a massive scale
the result is that childhood itself is being molded to YouTube's expectations if the traditional baby photo album
Crystallizes the warmest loveliest moments of a person's young life the YouTube algorithm
Seems to be drawn to the extreme highs and lows
Cuteness is fine
But embarrassment also works
Baby fails is now its own thriving at YouTube genre and if you want your own famous YouTube, baby
It would be really convenient if your kid failed like every day
In one particularly disturbing YouTube sub-genre
Parents dress up their kids like their babies and have them suck on pacifiers and fake poop in diapers
At least I think it's fake I
Hope it's fake at its most extreme this genre teeters on the edge of abuse
we put things on the internet that should not be there the parents behind Daddy of five a YouTube channel where they habitually
Played horrifying pranks on their kids were convicted on misdemeanor
counts of neglect of a minor after the videos came to the attention of Child Protective Services
We just kept going more and more for the shock factor
versus
Reality and to see what could get more views actually
but even kids who aren't outright terrorized on these channels don't have the same rights that traditional child performers do
The protections of child labor laws or something like the Coogan Act which saves child actors earnings in a trust until they reach adulthood
These kids don't even get the respite of a distinction between performance and life
They're being raised to seek validation by a moding on cue and being taught that that's what family is for back here smile
Say something on the blogs, that means performing a lot of emotional labor
maybe before you even know what emotions are when bogging and
Filming we don't cry
The Raiders youngest child Juliette has been famous since she was born Truman Show style
Her birth has been seen 14 million times
Now she's just 2 years old, but she's already experienced a lifetime of drama
We don't yet know what that means for a child's development just that millions of other parents and kids are watching
Hey, this is Amanda, this is Shane he edits the videos
She writes the videos you watch the videos and if you like the videos
