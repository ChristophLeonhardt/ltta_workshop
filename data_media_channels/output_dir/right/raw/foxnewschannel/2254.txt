WRONG DAY AFTER DAY.

68
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,726
AND HE ENDS UP REVEALING THEM

69
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:06,632
FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE.

70
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:12,504
I HAVE TO SAY, GUYS, WHEN YOU

84
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:46,138
WHEN YOU COMPARE WHAT SHE WAS

00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:47,773
SAYING TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE

86
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:50,242

00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:20,806
TRUMP.

102
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:21,407
UNLIKE OTHER REPUBLICAN

103
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,074
PRESIDENTS WHO RAN TO THE

104
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:26,278
NEAREST CORNER AND DID NOT

105
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:27,446
APOLOGIZE WITH THE MEDIA

106
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:29,748
ATTACKS, TRUMP RETURNED FIRE.

107
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:31,483
BY CHOOSING WOLF AS THEIR

108
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:34,386
AVATAR, THE D.C. MEDIA ELITE

109
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,588
HAVE CONFIRMED THEIR BIAS FOR

110
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,956
ANYONE WHO WILL GIVE THEM EVEN

111
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,224
THE SLIGHTEST BENEFIT OF THE

112
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:39,758
DOUBT.

113
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,527
BOY, WAS I GLAD MY KIDS AND I

114
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,996
WEREN'T WATCHING.

115
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,597
>> I KNOW PEOPLE REALLY WANT ME

116
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,032
TO GO AFTER TRUMP TONIGHT BUT I

117
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:48,567
THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THE

118
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,201
PRESIDENT CREDIT WHEN HE

119
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,202
DESERVES IT.

120
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,804
LIKE, HE PULLED OUT OF THE PARIS

121
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:52,171
AGREEMENT.

122
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:53,672
AND I THINK HE SHOULD GET CREDIT

123
00:03:53,672 --> 00:00:00,000
FOR THAT BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS
