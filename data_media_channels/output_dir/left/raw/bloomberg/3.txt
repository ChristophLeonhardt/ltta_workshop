1
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,212
It's one of the most important technologies
of the 20th century.

2
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:09,550
If it failed tomorrow, banks would crash,
planes would get lost

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,720
and you'd probably struggle to find
your way around the city

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,058
It's called GPS and it was designed to defeat
the Soviet Union.

5
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:22,271
This is how a Cold War technology went from
guiding bombs to guiding your Uber.

6
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:30,154
GPS is a network of satellites which allows
you to open your phone and know where you

7
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,531
are anywhere in the world.

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:35,492
Billions of people use it everyday.

9
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:38,787
But its roots can be traced back to the
world's first satellite.

10
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:44,042
"Today a new moon is in the sky. A 23 inch
metal sphere, place in orbit by a Russian

11
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:45,043
rocket"

12
00:00:45,043 --> 00:00:49,173
In October 1957 The Soviet Union launched
Sputnik.

13
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:54,511
The Space Race between the USSR and America
had begun and the U.S. was losing.

14
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:59,808
"All over the world people are tuning in to
the bleep bleep of the satellite, which carries

15
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:04,980
aboard the complex mechanism necessary to
transmit secrets of the universe"

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,568
As the beach ball sized satellite flew above,
American scientists noticed that the radio

17
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:14,990
frequency it was transmitting increased as
it approached and decreased as it moved away.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,453
It's called the Doppler Effect, and it could
be used to locate the satellite.

19
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:23,707
This was a Eureka moment. If a satellites
position was known, the position of a receiver

20
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:26,293
on earth could be determined

21
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,879
This is the basic idea of GPS.

22
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:40,724
In 1978, over twenty years after Sputnik,
the U.S.A. launched its first Navstar satellite.

23
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,101
This is the system we now call GPS.

24
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:46,855
"They will provide highly accurate and continuous global coverage

25
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:50,484
to authorised users by the late 1980's"

26
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:54,988
Unlike earlier navigation satellites , Navstar
would give a constant positioning service

27
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,115
with unheard of accuracy.

28
00:01:57,115 --> 00:02:02,746
Each satellite carried an atomic clock which
broadcasts its location with a time stamp.

29
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:07,376
By using the location and time data from at
least four satellites, a GPS receiver can

30
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:12,840
tell you where you are, your altitude and
the speed and direction you're moving in.

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,008
24 satellites are needed to cover the globe.

32
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:24,393
This was cutting edge technology, run by the military, for the military

33
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:26,854
But that all changed when tragedy struck.

34
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:32,234
"My fellow Americans, I'm coming before
you tonight about the Korean Airline massacre"

35
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:38,323
On September 1, 1983, a Russian fighter jet
shot down a Korean Airline's plane on its

36
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,242
way from New York to Seoul.

37
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:43,704
All 269 people onboard were killed.

38
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:49,209
The plane had deviated from its original route
and flown through Soviet airspace.

39
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,713
Radio technology couldn't track the plane
because of its limited range.

40
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,132
GPS would have solved this

41
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,388
Just two weeks after the attack, President
Reagan made GPS available for civilian use

42
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:02,556
as a common good.

43
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:06,310
But the U.S. military was concerned. They
didn't want to give away

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,478
their latest space technology

45
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:13,191
The decision was made to restrict GPS's
accuracy by purposefully messing with the

46
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,860
location signal.

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,531
It would take another decade, several more
GPS satellites, and a war, for the technology

48
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:22,117
to develop into what we recognise now.

49
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:30,959
In August 1990, the U.S. and it allies launched
Operation Desert Storm to remove Iraqi forces

50
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,128
from neighbouring Kuwait.

51
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:38,175
This was GPS's first full military test
and it passed with flying colours.

52
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:43,680
It allowed troops to navigate and direct fire
with unprecedented accuracy.

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,059
While cruise missiles were guided to their
exact locations

54
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:50,896
The Department of Defence paid million to
U.S. manufacturers to provide troops with

55
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,481
GPS units.

56
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:57,694
After the war, manufacturers quickly found
ways to market the new technology.

57
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,743
Then in 2000 GPS's accuracy restrictions
were lifted

58
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,119
and the flood gates opened.

59
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:10,791
Since then the technology has become intertwined
with our modern lives

60
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:15,921
GPS is the global time keeper. Its atomic
clocks are accurate to within 40 nano seconds

61
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,757
that's four thousand-millionths of a second.

62
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:25,555
Banking systems rely on it to timestamp transactions,
including withdrawing money from ATMs.

63
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:29,893
It is used to keep our trains running on time
and reduce farm wastage

64
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:33,438
Not to mention all the apps that rely on GPS.

65
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:39,027
Today the civilian satellite navigation market
is worth nearly thirty five billion dollars

66
00:04:39,027 --> 00:04:43,407
And is expected to grow to more than eighty
three billion by 2022.

67
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:49,162
Compare that with the global military market
and civilian uses now dwarfs it

68
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:53,917
It may have been born out of the Cold War,
but GPS services are now a critical part of

69
00:04:53,917 --> 00:00:00,000
our everyday lives.
