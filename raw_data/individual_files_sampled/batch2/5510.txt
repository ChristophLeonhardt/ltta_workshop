what would be the problem with the FBI reopening their background investigation into judge Cavanaugh would you support such a thing the FBI John said that they really don't do that that's not what they do President Trump today suggesting the FBI shouldn't get involved in the new judge Cavanaugh investigation because the agency doesn't want to the president insisting it's not really their thing yet the president has directed the FBI along with the Department of Justice and the Director of National Intelligence to declassify sensitive information related to the ongoing Russia investigation of his administration in an interview with the hill today the president cast himself as rooting out corruption at the FBI he says it will be viewed as a quote crowning achievement of his presidency because it will quote expose something that is truly a cancer in our country here to talk about all of it Chuck Rosenberg a former US attorney and former senior official at the FBI and matthew Miller former chief spokesman for the Department of Justice Chuck's not the first time I've asked you to fact-check the president likely won't be the last when the president says this isn't their kind of thing and they really don't want to do it what should we think we should take a look at the letter I Brian and FBI because it actually stands for investigation this is precisely their thing this is what they do every day around the country and around the world they do investigations but the way it works here there's a protocol this is not their first rodeo this is not their first background investigation they pass along information to the White House on mr. Cavanaugh and if the White House wants more information all they have to do is ask it is literally that simple they asked the FBI to do more interviews to collect more information to do an investigation and the FBI does it so the president Brian in a shocking development is wrong Matt the president doesn't want the FBI involved here he would very much like the FBI to reveal formerly confidential communicate patience that could reveal sources and methods conceivably yeah it's a bit ironic that after a year and a half of the president making you know repeated inappropriate demands of the FBI the one thing we found that he won't ask him to do is investigate allegations of sexual assault at the same time as you point out he's taking this step using the powers of the presidency really to advance his personal interest if you get to the bottom line of what he's doing with with declassifying this information you have to go back to the fact that this this FISA application in de Carter page has already gone through declassification review and the professional security professionals at the Justice Department at the FBI have determined that the 21 pages that they held back some some in total some partially were held back because releasing that information would either compromise sources and methods or reject eyes ongoing active investigations so that review has already been done and the president is now kind of swooping in after the fact and ordering it released anyway because it'll aid his personal and his his personal campaign against the FBI and his legal teams campaign against the FBI all to try to undermine the investigation it is kind of the worst abuse of power possible to use your official powers to advance your personal interests Chuck how much of your life's work does this order by the president go against how read a line does it cross in your view that he's releasing material germane to the investigation into his administration it's enormous ly perplexing and damaging and disheartening Brian look there's an immediate danger to the case to this particular case and to the investigation that Matt Miller is talking about but there's also a long-term institutional damage for instance we share information intelligence and intelligence information with allies around the world including our closest allies the UK the Canadians the Australians New Zealand we have information sharing protocols and now suddenly our allies our best allies in the intelligence world see us being information into the public sphere for partisan political reasons and so how likely are they to trust us in the future with the most important stuff they have and the answer is not very likely so there is a damage to the immediate case and there's damage to our long-term institutional interest as part of a larger intelligence community very disheartening Brian hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
