1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,900
I was speaking to a law enforcement officer.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,300
He came home from a bad day at work, and left
his gun on the kitchen table.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,740
And when he was in the other room, he fell
asleep,

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,700
and his kid found the gun.

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,580
His wife was able to intervene and take the
firearm away from his kid,

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,020
and so nothing happened.

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,960
But let’s say his wife hadn’t been home.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,020
That could have been a very very bad situation.

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,520
If that had been a smart gun, it would have
been different.

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,100
With a smart gun, the kid finds the gun, it’s
gonna be locked.

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:02,820
We want change! We want change!

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,300
Americans have never been more politically engaged
on the issue of gun violence.

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,260
And yet, attempts at widespread gun control
laws keep hitting a brick wall.

14
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,100
As the gun debate rages on, some are considering
a different kind of solution –

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,640
one that could have a huge impact on certain kinds
of gun violence.

16
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,520
A smart gun is a gun that can
only be used by the owner, either because

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,600
of biometrics, that is, fingerprint, or some
other technology.

18
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,420
Smart guns could prevent thousands of suicides,
let’s start there.

19
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,920
If a teenager wants to kill himself and the
easiest means is their father or mother’s

20
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,780
gun, they’re unable to do that.

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,260
It wouldn’t stop all mass shootings, but
it would stop some of them, because so often

22
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:04,400
in mass shootings, the young man is using
a gun that isn’t actually theirs.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,640
So smart guns could have a profound effect
in terms of gun safety in America.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,060
My name is Kai Kloepfer. I’m the founder
of Biofire Technologies,

25
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,520
an early-stage startup based here in Boston.

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,160
Basically what we’re doing is incorporating fingerprint sensors or other authentication methods into firearms.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,920
Our prototype, as far as I know it’s the
first fingerprint smartgun in the world.

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,080
So we’ve got our live-fire prototype here.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,380
What this is is we’ve taken an off-the-shelf
firearm and incorporated

30
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,440
all of our technology into it.

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,840
So uh, this is my teammate Luke.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,650
We’ve got this here, it’s programmed to me.

33
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,860
And so if I hand it to you here, um got it?

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,320
And you put your finger on the sensor here,
it’s just gonna flash white.

35
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,660
So no matter how much he pulls on the trigger,
it’s just gonna be completely locked.

36
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,640
But if I take it, and do the exact same thing,
it’s gonna go red.

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,860
And what that means is if I close the slide
here, it’s gonna fire.

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
I’ve been involved in the smart gun
space for about 6 years now.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,980
I originally got into it as a sophomore in
high school.

40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,420
I thought, well of course smart guns are gonna work.

41
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,330
Like, I understand the technology, and I’ve
shot guns, I’ve used guns in the past.

42
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,720
There’s no reason why we shouldn’t
be able to combine these, right?

43
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,390
It turns out that, at the time, if I’d talked
to pretty much anybody, most people would

44
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,320
have probably told me that was impossible.

45
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,060
There is no smart gun available in the
United States today, because

46
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,280
2nd amendment absolutists are vehemently
opposed to smart guns.

47
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,360
A safe gun is one that fires
when you pull the trigger every single time.

48
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,200
If tech companies can’t make
electronics that are 100% reliable, how are

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,839
firearms companies supposed to do it?

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,580
When you need a firearm, there is zero time to be
messing with rebooting your gun.

51
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,220
The government could turn these
things off.

52
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,860
They could be like, well, there’s a natural
disaster in Florida, let’s turn all the

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
guns off for a while, for their own protection.

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,540
I swear, if one more liberal tells me how I
have to live my life, my head’s gonna explode!

55
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,120
As if this basic level of mistrust weren’t
enough, one state’s attempt to mandate

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,900
smart gun technology has made things even worse.

57
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,080
There’s a law that was passed in New
Jersey, it’s called the Childproof Handgun Act,

58
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,070
that says that in New Jersey, once a
smart gun is available anywhere in the United

59
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,870
States, all guns sold in New Jersey after
a certain time period have to be smart guns.

60
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,240
So if you try to sell a firearm in, say, Texas
– a smart gun – that is going to trigger

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
the New Jersey law.

62
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,400
What that did was, anytime someone has thought
about selling a smart gun anywhere in the

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,080
United States, there’s been some pushback.

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,340
There are several instances in recent
years where a store had decided they were

65
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,820
going to carry a smart gun from Europe.

66
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:37,440
And because of New Jersey, the store owner
received so many threats of violence against him

67
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,300
that he decided not to carry the smart gun.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,300
So basically mob violence has kept smart guns
off the market.

69
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,620
New Jersey, everybody involved, including
the state senators that initially

70
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,880
introduced the bill, have realized that it
didn’t quite work the way they intended.

71
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,100
So that law is in the final stages of being
repealed; that is on its way out the door.

72
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,200
This technology can only have impact if people
are choosing to buy it

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,480
instead of traditional firearms.

74
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,740
We would much rather have the opportunity
to get this out there and prove to people

75
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,580
that it’s a superior product that people
want to buy.

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,520
All right, well we’re about to do a
live fire demo here.

77
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,370
You can see if I put my finger on it, it’s
gonna go red.

78
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,640
And then when I come up here to fire…

79
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
And that’s sort of all there is to it.

80
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,140
NARR: Kai still faces a lot of challenges.

81
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,860
Many potential buyers could be put off by
the unreliability of fingerprint readers under

82
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,560
wet or dirty conditions.

83
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,600
And past attempts at smart guns have been
unaffordable for most buyers,

84
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,380
because of the high-tech electronics involved.

85
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,880
But if his startup can get a smart gun on
the market, it just might inspire

86
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,520
bigger gun companies to do the same.

87
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,980
The gun industry’s in a slump now,
a terrible slump.

88
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,700
The great irony of course is that the president,
Donald Trump, is a big gun supporter.

89
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,770
And that’s the reason so many fewer guns
are being sold, ‘cause gun owners aren’t afraid

90
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,180
anymore that someone’s gonna take their
gun away.

91
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,080
So one really strong reason for getting a
smart gun on the market

92
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
is that it’s a new technology, and it’s a new product.

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,380
I think it’s inevitable that smart guns
will take their place alongside

94
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,040
not-smart guns in America.

95
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,440
Actually solving gun violence is gonna
be a big task.

96
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,540
You know, this is not something that can be
solved just with smart guns.

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,020
But I think technology has a role to play.

98
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,860
If I can even save one life, I think that’s
worth it at the end of the day.

99
00:08:11,860 --> 00:00:00,000
And this honestly has the opportunity to save
a lot more than that.
