REMEMBER THAT. 
THEY ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE MY FRIENDS. 
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. 
I LOVE YOU, TOO. 
IT IS A GUY, BUT I LOVE YOU, 
TOO. 
YOU ARE PROUD OF OUR COUNTRY. 
YOU ARE PROUD OF OUR HISTORY. 
AND UNLIKE THE NFL, YOU ALWAYS 
HONOR AND CHERISH OUR GREAT 
AMERICAN FLAG. 
IT WAS JUST ANNOUNCED BY ESPN, 
THAT RATHER THAN DEFENDING OUR 
ANTHEM, OUR BEAUTIFUL, 
BEAUTIFUL, NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND 
DEFENDING OUR FLAG, THEY HAVE 
DECIDED THAT THEY JUST WON'T 
BROADCAST WHEN THEY PLAY THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
WE DON'T LIKE THAT. 
SO, WHILE THE PLAYERS ARE 
KNEELING, SOME OF THEM, NOT ALL 
OF THEM, AT ALL. 
YOU ARE ALL PROUDLY STANDING 
FOR OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
THANK YOU. 
THE ESPN THING WAS TERRIBLE. 
IT JUST CAME OUT. 
UNDER OUR ADMINISTRATION, 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AND 
BEING RESPECTED AGAIN, ALL OVER 
THE WORLD. 
IT IS AMERICA FIRST. 
THIS IS THE GREATEST ECONOMY 
THAT WE HAVE HAD IN OUR 
HISTORY. 
THE BEST. 
OUR STEEL MILLS ARE BACK. 
THEY ARE ROARING BACK. 
WE ARE MAKING STEEL, AGAIN. 
UNITED STATES STEEL ANNOUNCED A 
MASSIVE INFUSION OF CASH. 
THEY ARE OPENING UP SEVEN 
DIFFERENT PLANTS. 
OTHER STEEL COMPANIES ALL OVER 
THE COUNTRY, THEY ARE OPENING 
UP PLANTS. 
PEOPLE SAID STEEL WOULD NEVER 
BE BACK. 
STEEL IS BACK. 
IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST 
INDUSTRIES IN OUR COUNTRY, 
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE 
WITH OUR TARIFFS. 
THEY WERE DUMPING STEEL ALL 
OVER OUR COUNTRY. 
DESTROYING OUR BUSINESS. 
THEY ARE NOT DUMPING SO MUCH, 
ANYMORE, AND IF THEY DO, THEY 
ARE PAYING A LOT. 
OUR MILITARY WILL SOON BE 
STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN 
BEFORE. 
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
AMAZING VETERANS. 
AND I KNOW THIS DOESN'T MATTER 
TO YOU, BUT WE ARE PUTTING OUR 
GREAT COAL MINERS BACK TO WORK. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT, I 
TELL YOU. 
A LOT OF COURAGE. 
BUT WE LOVE CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL, 
WEST VIRGINIA COAL. 
WE LOVE IT. 
AND, YOU KNOW, IT IS 
INDESTRUCTIBLE STUFF. 
IN TIMES OF WAR, IN TIMES OF 
CONFLICT, YOU CAN BLOW UP THOSE 
WINDMILLS. 
THEY FALL DOWN REAL QUICKLY. 
YOU CAN BLOW UP THOSE PIPELINES 
THAT GO LIKE THIS, YOU ARE NOT 
GOING TO FIX THEM TOO FAST. 
YOU CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS TO 
THOSE SOLAR PANELS, BUT YOU 
KNOW WHAT YOU CAN'T HURT? 
COAL. 
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 
COAL. 
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
WE ARE WORKING NOW ON A 
MILITARY PLAN THAT IS GOING TO 
BE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL. 
I AM HONORED TONIGHT TO HAVE A 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
LET'S SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF 
POLICY. 
A DEMOCRAT. 
HE DECIDED TO BECOME A 
REPUBLICAN AND IT IS BECAUSE OF 
POLICY. 
I WANT TO BRING HIM UP, IF I 
CAN. 
CAN I BRING UP YOUR GOVERNOR? 
GOVERNOR BIG JIM JUSTICE. 
>> OKAY. 
I DEPUTIZED YOU, DID I NOT? 
THE OTHER THING I KNOW, YOU, AS 
WEST VIRGINIANS ARE 
APPRECIATIVE PEOPLE. 
JUST THINK, WE KNOW WHAT THIS 
GREAT MAN, RIGHT BESIDE ME, HAS 
DONE FOR US. 
NOW, LET ME SAY THIS. 
IT IS TIME FOR US TO SHOW THAT 
APPRECIATION AND DELIVER BACK. 
WE HAVE TO REELECT OUR HOUSE 
MEMBERS AND WE CANNOT, WHATEVER 
WE DO, TO GOD ABOVE, WE CANNOT 
PUT IT ON THIS MAN. 
BUT IT GOES FURTHER THAN THAT. 
PATRICK MORRISEY IS A LITTLE 
BEHIND, RIGHT NOW. 
HE NEEDS YOU. 
HE NEEDS ALL OF YOU. 
HE NEEDS YOU TO GO OUT AND BE 
WARRIORS AND DEPUTIES FOR HIM. 
HE CAN WIN THIS AND THIS MAN 
NEEDS HIM. 
I WOULD SAY, GOD BLESS THIS 
GREAT MAN, GOD BLESS THIS GREAT 
COUNTRY, AND THANK YOU FOR 
HAVING ME. 
>> HE IS A BIG MAN. 
HE IS ALL MAN. 
6'11". 
I WON'T TALK ABOUT THE WEIGHT. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WEIGHT 
IS. 
I WON'T GO THERE, BUT HE IS A 
BIG MAN AND A GREAT MAN. 
A WONDERFUL FRIEND OF MINE. 
IT IS REALLY NICE WHAT HE JUST 
SAID ABOUT THE MAN YOU WANT TO 
BE, YOUR NEXT SENATOR. 
THAT IS VERY NICE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
ALSO, WE HAVE YOUR SENATOR, WHO 
IS A SPECIAL FRIEND OF MINE. 
HE HAS BEEN SO HELPFUL TO ME 
AND SO HELPFUL TO YOU, SHE 
LOVES YOUR STATE. 
CONGRESSMAN DAVID McKINNEY, 
ALEX MOONEY, AND EVAN JENKINS. 
EVAN, YOU PUT UP ONE HELL OF A 
FIGHT. 
THANK YOU. 
BOY, YOU WERE SOMETHING. 
AND YOUR STATE GOP CHAIRWOMAN, 
MELANIE POTTER. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU, MELANIE. 
ALSO WITH US IS A TREMENDOUS 
SENATOR, SOMEBODY WHO HAS 
HELPED US TO OUR AGENDA, WHICH 
IS, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, 
PRETTY MUCH. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
NAMES. 
YOU SEE PROMISES MADE, PROMISES 
KEPT. 
THEY ARE COPYING IT NOW, THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
THEY ARE COPYING IT. 
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. 
THEY ARE COPYING IT. 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? 
THIS IS A MAN WHO MAKES A 
PROMISE AND IT IS 100% GOOD. 
HE IS TREMENDOUS AND HAS DONE 
SO MUCH. 
HE IS FROM A PLACE CALLED 
COLORADO. 
HE IS HELPING TO LEAD OUR 
CAMPAIGN, TO ELECT MORE SENATE 
REPUBLICANS, LIKE THE GUY WE 
WILL ELECT IN WEST VIRGINIA, 
CORY GARDNER. 
THANK YOU. 
YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB, 
THANK YOU. 
AND WE ARE THRILLED TO BE 
JOINED BY THE NEXT HOUSE MEMBERS
FROM WEST VIRGINIA'S THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. 
A WOMAN THAT WORKS VERY HARD 
FOR YOU, CAROL MILLER. 
CAROL. 
THANKS, CAROL. 
FINALLY, IT IS MY GREAT HONOR 
TO INTRODUCE THE PERSON WE ARE 
HERE TO SUPPORT TONIGHT. 
A TREMENDOUS GENTLEMAN. 
I GOT TO KNOW HIM, DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN. 
HE HAS AN ENERGY. 
IT TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE TO 
FIGURE IT OUT. 
I HAVE TO BE HONEST. 
ONCE I GOT TO SEE WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING, EVAN WOULD BE THE 
FIRST TO TELL YOU, HE WAS SO 
TOUGH, SO SMART. 
HE DIDN'T STOP. 
HE DOES NOT STOP AND HE WILL 
FIGHT FOR YOU LIKE NOBODY HAS 
EVER FOUGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
YOUR NEXT SENATOR, PATRICK 
MORRISEY. 
PATRICK, COME UP HERE. 
COME UP HERE, PATRICK. 
COME UP HERE, PATRICK. 
>> JOE DOES HAVE TO GO. 
LET ME BE CLEAR. 
GUYS, I WANT TO START OUT, BY 
THINKING THE PRESIDENT FOR 
COMING BACK TO WILD AND 
WONDERFUL WEST VIRGINIA, FOR 
THE SIXTH TIME. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS GUY? 
WEST VIRGINIA HAS NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 
WE LOVE YOU, MISTER PRESIDENT. 
AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS, WE 
KNOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
BUT, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING WEST 
VIRGINIA GREAT AGAIN. 
TONIGHT, WE ARE JOINED BY SOME 
OF THE MOUNTAIN STATES FINEST 
COAL MINERS. 
CAN YOU STAND UP? 
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR 
HARDEST WORKING COAL MINERS. 
DONALD TRUMP AND I ARE FIGHTING 
EVERY DAY FOR OUR COAL MINERS 
AND THE HARD-WORKING MEN AND 
WOMEN OF OUR STATE. 
HE IS TRYING TO GET THE MAN OFF 
YOUR BACK, AND I AM WORKING 
EVERY DAY TO HELP HIM DO IT. 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, ONE OF THE 
BEST WAYS I CAN HELP PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, IS TO HAVE YOU SEND ME 
TO THE U.S. SENATE, WHERE I 
WILL BE A BIG ALLY OF THIS U.S. 
PRESIDENT. 
WEST VIRGINIA NEEDS TO SEND A 
CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER TO THE 
U.S. SENATE TO HELP DRAIN THAT 
SWAMP. 
NOW -- 
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD. 
NOW LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE 
BIT. 
I HAVE AN OPPONENT IN THIS 
RACE. 
HIS NAME IS DISHONEST, LIBERAL, 
JOE MANCHIN. 
LET ME BE CLEAR. 
LIBERAL JOE IS NO SUPPORTER OF 
THIS PRESIDENT. 
HE STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND VOTED 
FOR HILLARY CLINTON, AFTER -- 
HANG ON, HANG ON. 
AFTER SHE SAID, WE WILL PUT A 
LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL 
COMPANIES OUT OF WORK. 
YEAH, PRETTY BAD. 
JOE MANCHIN EVEN CALLED HILLARY 
WARM, COMPASSIONATE, ENGAGING, 
TOUGH. 
CAN YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT? 
JOE HAS TO GO. 
LIBERAL JOE NO LONGER HAS WEST 
VIRGINIA VALUES. 
LET'S GO THROUGH THE RECORD. 
JOE MANCHIN WAS FOR OBAMA. 
HE WAS FOR HILLARY. 
HE HAS FOUR RADICAL GUN 
CONTROL, PLANNED PARENTHOOD. 
HE SHILLS FOR EPIPEN AND HE 
OPPOSED THE TRUMP TAX CUTS. 
PRETTY BAD, RIGHT? 
REMEMBER, THIS IS WEST VIRGINIA.
WE BENEFIT, AS MUCH OR MORE AS 
ANYONE, FROM THE TRUMP TAX CUTS.
JOE MANCHIN NO LONGER HAS WEST 
VIRGINIA VALUES, PERIOD. 
WHEN I GET TO THE U.S. SENATE, 
I AM GOING TO BE A STRONG ALLY 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
I WILL BE THE CONSERVATIVE 
FIGHTER THAT YOU CAN RELY ON. 
WE ARE GOING TO STAND UP FOR 
COAL AND OUR ENERGY RESOURCES 
AND WE WILL TACKLE THIS OPIOID 
EPIDEMIC, MORE AGGRESSIVELY 
THAN ANYONE. 
IT IS MY HONOR TO BE HERE 
TONIGHT AND BE ON THE SAME 
STAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT. 
MISTER PRESIDENT, THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR LEADERSHIP, YOUR WORK, AND 
FOR STANDING UP FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
AMEN. 
TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL GOING TO 
HELP THIS GUY MAKE SURE, NOT 
ONLY THAT WE MAKE WEST VIRGINIA 
GREAT AGAIN, WE CONTINUE TO 
MAKE WEST VIRGINIA GREAT AGAIN. 
BEST WAY TO DO THAT, LIBERAL 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO. 
GUYS. 
JOE HAS GOT TO GO. 
AND NOW, I WILL TURN THIS BACK 
OVER TO THE BIG MAN, WHO YOU 
ARE HERE TO SEE. 
AMEN, BROTHER. 
>> HE HAS ENERGY. 
HE HAS A LOT OF TALENT AND HE 
LOVES THIS PLACE. 
HE LOVES THE PEOPLE. 
HE IS OUT CAMPAIGNING. 
I SAID, HOW MANY DAYS ARE YOU 
CAMPAIGNING? 
I SAID, THE LAST 60 DAYS OF MY 
CAMPAIGN, EVERY SINGLE DAY WE 
WOULD GO OUT. 
EVERY SINGLE DAY, AS MANY STOPS 
AS YOU COULD MAKE. 
HUMANLY. 
HUMANLY. 
EVERY SINGLE DAY, YOU CAN'T GET 
TIRED. 
HE HAS THAT SAME THING. 
HE HAS A VERY SPECIAL SPARK. 
YOU SEE IT AND YOU KNOW IT. 
HE IS DOING A HELL OF A JOB AND 
YOU HAVE TO GET HIM WITH US. 
HE IS GOING TO BRING IT BACK 
HOME, FOR THE PEOPLE OF WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
THIS NOVEMBER, VOTERS IN WEST 
VIRGINIA WILL FACE A VERY 
SIMPLE CHOICE. 
A VOTE FOR PATRICK MORRISEY IS 
TRULY A VOTE TO MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN. 
HE IS GOING TO VOTE. 
AND I LIKE JOE, BUT JOE DOESN'T 
VOTE. 
HE JUST DOESN'T VOTE FOR US. 
HE VOTES FOR SCHUMER, NANCY 
PELOSI, THEIR NEW LEADER, 
MAXINE WATERS. 
BUT BETWEEN WATERS AND PELOSI, 
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
CHARGE OF CONGRESS. 
THEY ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WEST 
VIRGINIA EXISTS. 
THEY DON'T LIKE COAL. 
THEY DON'T LIKE ENERGY. 
SO, WHEN YOU CAST YOUR BALLOT, 
FOR CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER, YOU 
WANT TO JUST VOTING FOR A 
CANDIDATE. 
YOU ARE VOTING FOR WHICH PARTY 
CONTROLS THE HOUSE AND WHICH 
PARTY CONTROLS THE SENATE. 
SO ALL THESE CONGRESS PEOPLE, 
AND I TELL YOU, WE HAVE TO GET 
 
WE REALLY HAVE TO GET THERE. 
I WILL BE GOING OUT AS MANY 
DAYS AS I CAN AND AM ALLOWED TO.
I HAVE A LITTLE, WITH ALL THE 
SECRET SERVICE, THEY ARE 
FANTASTIC PEOPLE, BUT IT SORT 
OF HOLDS YOU BACK. 
MAYBE SOMETIMES I WILL JUST 
MAKE A FEW TRIPS WITHOUT THEM. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT A LOT. 
WE ARE GOING TO A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT STATES AND I AM 
COMING BACK HERE, BEFORE THE 
ELECTION. 
AND IT IS A VERY CLOSE 
ELECTION. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. 
THERE IS A SIX POINT SPREAD. 
IT COULD BE ENDED, BY THIS 
EVENING. 
YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS BEEN 
HAPPENING. 
WE HAVE HAD A GOOD RECORD OF 
ENJOYED -- RECORD OF 
ENDORSEMENTS IN GEORGIA. 
A GOOD MAN, THE GOVERNOR. 
HE WON, 70-30. 
SO, I GUESS HE PICKED UP 45 OR 
50 POINTS, IN OHIO RECENTLY. 
HE WAS UP, THEN HE WENT DOWN A 
LITTLE BIT. 
WE WENT THERE, AND HE WON. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
BALDERSON, A GOOD MAN. 
CONGRESSMAN BALDERSON, NOW. 
WE WON EIGHT OUT OF NINE 
SPECIAL ELECTIONS. 
NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT. 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. 
EIGHT OUT OF NINE SPECIAL 
ELECTIONS AND THEY DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT IT. 
MY RECORD, LOOK, I DON'T WANT 
TO BRAG ABOUT IT, BUT, MAN, I 
HAVE A GOOD RECORD OF 
ENDORSEMENT. 
IN FLORIDA WE HAVE A GREAT 
CANDIDATE. 
HE CALLED ME AND ASKED WHETHER 
OR NOT I COULD ENDORSE HIM. 
I SAID, LET ME CHECK IT OUT. 
HE WAS AT 3. THIS WAS A FEW 
MONTHS AGO. 
HE WAS AT 3. I GAVE HIM A NICE 
SHOT AND A LITTLE TWEAK AND HE 
WENT FROM 3 TO TWENTYSOMETHING. 
THEN I GAVE HIM MY FULL AND 
TOTAL ENDORSEMENT. 
HE IS NOW LEADING BY, LIKE, 19 
POINTS. 
AND THAT ELECTION IS NEXT WEEK. 
LEADING IN THE PRIMARY. 
A GOOD MAN. 
AND SO MANY OTHERS. 
STATEN ISLAND. 
THE CONGRESSMAN WAS DOWN. 
BEFORE THE ELECTION. 
WE ENDORSED HIM AND I THINK HE 
WON BY 24 POINTS. 
ALL MY LIFE I HAVE HEARD 
ENDORSEMENTS DON'T MEAN 
ANYTHING. 
THEY SAID IF YOU GET AN 
ENDORSEMENT BY RONALD REAGAN, 
WE LIKE RONALD REAGAN, IT WAS A 
WONDERFUL THING TO HAVE BUT IT 
DIDN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE. 
IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT, IF 
YOU LOOK? 
IF YOU GET AN ENDORSEMENT, IT 
WAS NICE IT HAPPENED, BUT IT 
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. 
THESE ENDORSEMENTS, THEY ARE 
GOING 20, 30, 40, 50 POINTS. 
50 POINTS. 
IT IS CRAZY. 
AND THEN YOU WATCH THE NEWS. 
WILL THIS ENDORSEMENT MEAN 
ANYTHING? 
IT IS GOING TO MEAN A LOT. 
AND I DON'T CARE, WE HAVE TO 
GET SENATORS IN. 
WE HAVE, REALLY, NO MAJORITY. 
WE HAVE, IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT 
IT, WE COULD PROBABLY SAY 49-
49.51-49. 
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE 
UNABLE TO VOTE AND SOME PEOPLE 
THAT ARE A LITTLE UNRELIABLE. 
THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT I HAVE 
DONE TO THEIR CAREER. 
THEY DON'T LOVE WHAT I HAVE 
DONE. 
THAT IS OKAY. 
AND I DO NOT LIKE WHAT THEY 
HAVE DONE, EITHER. 
BUT WE NEED TO ELECT FIVE, SIX, 
OR EVEN SEVEN MORE SENATORS. 
AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT. 
I THINK WE CAN DO IT. 
AND WE HAVE TO START WITH 
PATRICK MORRISEY, HE IS GOING 
TO BE FANTASTIC. 
IF YOU VOTE FOR JOE MANCHIN, OR 
ANY OTHER DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER, 
YOU ARE VOTING FOR THE PARTY 
THAT WANTS TO REALLY DESTROY 
THE COAL INDUSTRY. 
PATRICK SAID IT. 
JOE ENDORSED HILLARY, 100% AND 
HE GOT ALONG WITH HER, EVEN 
BETTER, AFTER HE CAME OUT WITH 
A STATEMENT THAT HE WANTS TO 
DESTROY COAL AND COAL 
COMPANIES. 
THAT IS A BAD THING. 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN 
AMERICA INTO ONE BIG FAT 
SANCTUARY CITY. 
FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS. 
AND HONESTLY, HONESTLY, THEY 
ARE MORE PROTECTIVE OF ALIENS, 
THE CRIMINAL ALIENS, THEN THEY 
ARE OF THE PEOPLE. 
THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT. 
YOU SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT PLAYED WITH. 
THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER THE 
MILLIKEN -- TAKE OVER AMERICAN 
HEALTH CORE -- HEALTHCARE AND 
USE OUR COURTS TO REWRITE THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE JUDGES I 
HAVE BEEN APPOINTING? 
THERE IS NO WORST NIGHTMARE FOR 
WEST NOVEMBER -- FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA THIS NOVEMBER, THEN 
CHUCK SCHUMER RUNNING THE 
SENATE AND NANCY PELOSI, WITH 
MAXINE WATERS, RUNNING THE 
HOUSE. 
THAT IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. 
THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE 
BLUE WAVE. 
I DON'T SEE IT. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY WE 
HAVE EVER HAD. 
JOE MANCHIN ALWAYS VOTED FOR 
OBAMA AND HE VOTED TO KEEP THE 
DISASTER KNOWN AS OBAMA CARE. 
I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS BEING 
CHIPPED AWAY. 
YOU KNOW, WE HAD IT BEATEN, BUT 
ONE MAN, AND I AM SURE NOBODY 
KNOWS WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT, 
VOTED NO. 
SHOCKINGLY. 
REALLY SURPRISING TO A LOT OF 
PEOPLE, BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNED 
ON REPEAL AND REPLACE. 
BUT WE HAVE REALLY KNOCKED IT 
OUT. 
INCLUDING THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE. 
WE GOT RID OF THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR PART OF OBAMA CARE, 
WHERE YOU HAVE A PRIVILEGE OF 
PAYING A FORTUNE FOR NOT HAVING 
TO PAY A FORTUNE FOR REALLY BAD 
HEALTHCARE. 
WE GOT RID OF IT. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY HAPPY 
WITH THAT. 
THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE 
BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN OUR HISTORY.
AND JOE MANCHIN VOTED NO ON THE 
TAX CUTS. 
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME I WAS 
HERE I SAW SIGNS ALONG THE 
HIGHWAY, JOE, YOU VOTED NO ON 
TAX CUTS. 
AND JOE, YOU VOTED NO FOR OUR 
PRESIDENT. 
YOU VOTED NO. 
AND HE IS GOING TO VOTE NO. 
I AM NOT KNOCKING HIM, BUT 
SCHUMER IS THE BOSS. 
HE MAY GIVE US A VOTE ON 
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH. 
HE SHOULD. 
HERE IS A GUY. 
IS THIS CENTRAL CASTING? 
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT. 
A GREAT, BRILLIANT MAN. 
BUT HE IS NOT VOTING WITH US. 
HE HAS VOTING AGAINST YOUR TAX 
CUTS. 
HE VOTED AGAINST REPEAL AND 
REPLACE. 
HE VOTES AGAINST THE THINGS 
THAT WE WANT AND VOTES AGAINST 
THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA. 
YOU KNOW, JOE OPPOSED THE WALL 
AND HE OPPOSED THE TRAVEL BAN. 
BY THE WAY, THE WALL, RIGHT NOW,
THAT WALL IS COMING ALONG. 
OVER $3 BILLION. 
IT IS MOVING ALONG, VERY 
NICELY. 
VERY NICELY. 
AND IF YOU THINK IT IS EASY 
WITH THESE PEOPLE, IT IS NOT 
EASY. 
IT IS NOT EASY. 
WE ARE GETTING THE WALL BUILT. 
IT IS GOING UP. 
WE ARE GETTING IT BUILT. 
AND WE HAVE A BIG NUMBER IN, 
RIGHT NOW. 
SHELLEY AND COREY, YOU HEAR 
THAT, RIGHT? 
WE ARE LOOKING FOR $5 BILLION 
THIS YEAR, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN 
IT WILL BE FINISHED AND VERY, 
VERY EFFECTIVE. 
YOU HEARD ABOUT, TODAY, WITH 
THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, COMING IN, 
VERY SADLY FROM MEXICO. 
AND YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO 
THAT INCREDIBLE, BEAUTIFUL, 
YOUNG WOMAN. 
IT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. 
ILLEGALLY IN OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAD A HUGE IMPACT, BUT THE 
LAWS ARE SO BAD. 
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE SUCH A 
DISGRACE. 
WE ARE GETTING THEM CHANGED, 
BUT WE HAVE TO GET MORE 
REPUBLICANS. 
THIS ELECTION IS BIGGER THAN 
ANY ONE RACE. 
IT IS ABOUT WHETHER WE WANT TO 
CONTINUE THE AMAZING PROGRESS 
WE HAVE MADE FOR AMERICA OR 
WHETHER WE WANT TO SURRENDER 
THAT PROGRESS TO THE FORCES OF 
EXTREMISM AND OBSTRUCTION. 
YOU KNOW, THERE LITTLE PHRASE 
THAT THEY LIKE, RESIST. 
THAT IS ALL THEY ARE GOOD AT. 
THEY HAVE NO POLICY. 
THEY ARE NOT GOOD POLITICIANS, 
BUT THEY ARE GOOD AT STICKING 
TOGETHER AND RESISTING. 
I HAVE ALMOST 400 PEOPLE THAT 
HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED. 
THEY ARE SLOW WALKING. 
WE HAVE ALMOST 400 PEOPLE IN 
OUR ADMINISTRATION. 
PEOPLE WHO GAVE UP THEIR 
CAREERS, WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING 
OVER A YEAR TO GET APPROVED AND 
THEY ARE BEING SLOW WALKED BY 
THE DEMOCRATS. 
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED THAT WAY 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
AND IT IS A DISGRACE. 
IT IS A DISGRACE. 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS HELD 
HOSTAGE, BY THE SO-CALLED 
RESISTANCE. 
THE LEFT WING HATERS AND A 
GREAT MOBS, TRYING TO TEAR DOWN 
OUR INSTITUTIONS. 
DISRESPECT OUR FLAG. 
DEMEAN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
DENIGRATE OUR HISTORY AND 
DISPARAGE OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT 
HAPPEN. 
NEW YORK'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, 
ANDREW CUOMO, EVEN DECLARED 
THAT AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 
OH, I SAID IT. 
TELL THAT TO OUR GREAT SOLDIERS 
IN WORLD WAR I. WORLD WAR II. 
KOREAN WAR. 
SO MANY OTHERS. 
TELL THEM TO THE FOLKS THAT 
SENT A ROCKET UP TO THE MOON, 
OUR GREAT ASTRONAUTS. 
TELL THAT TO ALL THE GREAT 
MEDICAL RESEARCH WE HAVE DONE 
IN THIS COUNTRY. 
HE SAYS AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT.
I WOULD IMAGINE, THAT IS CAREER 
THREATENING. 
HOW DO YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT 
ONE? 
DID YOU HEAR, HE WAS SPEAKING 
TO A ROOM LOADED UP WITH 
SOCIALIST AND PROBABLY OTHERS. 
NOT COMMUNISTS, BUT THERE COULD 
HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF THEM. 
AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT 
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 
DID YOU HEAR? 
THEY COULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT. 
THAT IS JOB THREATENING. 
HIS COMMENTS ARE AN INSULT TO 
THE GENERATIONS OF BRAVE 
AMERICANS WHOSE BLOOD AND SWEAT 
AND TEARS BUILT OUR MAGNIFICENT 
COUNTRY. 
SO, THIS NOVEMBER, YOU CAN 
EITHER VOTE FOR THE PARTY THAT 
SAYS AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT, 
THAT WILL BE THERE THEME NOW, 
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 
LET'S DO THAT. 
THEY COPIED MINE. 
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT. 
LET'S GIVE THEM A NEW THEME, 
AMERICA WAS NEVER GREAT. 
THAT IS THE DEMOCRATS NEW 
THEME. 
CAN WE DO THAT? 
YOU CAN VOTE PROUDLY FOR 
EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR. 
WE ARE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN 
THE WORLD AND WE ARE NOW, WE 
ARE NOW THE GREATEST ECONOMY 
THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD. 
WE ARE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN 
THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE GONE UP $10 TRILLION IN 
VALUE SINCE MY ELECTION. 
WE HAVE GONE UP $10 TRILLION. 
THINK OF IT? 
SINCE THE ELECTION. 
WASN'T THAT A GREAT ELECTION? 
BOY. 
REMEMBER I WAS HERE, JUST 
BEFORE THE ELECTION? 
AND I BROUGHT A COUPLE OF GUYS 
INTO A ROOM AND I SAID FELLAS, 
SUPPOSING WE TEACH YOU A NEW 
SKILL. 
SUPPOSING WE TEACH YOU HOW TO 
MAKE LITTLE WIDGETS OR GADGETS. 
THESE ARE BIG, STRONG COAL 
MINERS. 
THEY SAID, SIR, WE WANT TO DIG 
COAL. 
I SAID, I AGREE WITH YOU. 
REMEMBER THAT? 
THEY ARE GRANDFATHERS, THEY DID 
IT. 
FATHERS, DID IT. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
IT IS REALLY HAPPENING. 
WE ARE BACK. 
THE COAL INDUSTRY IS REALLY 
BACK. 
SO, WHEN I CAME HERE 
ORIGINALLY, WEST VIRGINIA, 
FRANKLY, WAS DOWN AND OUT. 
IT WAS NOT DOING EXACTLY WELL. 
ONE OF THE LAST. 
YOU KNOW THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
IT HIT WERE WEST VIRGINIA, ON A 
PER CAPITA BASIS, IS ONE OF THE 
MOST SUCCESSFUL GDP STATES IN 
OUR UNION. 
SO WE WENT FROM BEING DOWN AND 
OUT, TO ONE OF THE MOST 
SUCCESSFUL IN THE UNION. 
VERY CLOSE TO THE TOP. 
THAT IS SOME BIG CHANGE. 
I HAVE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE. 
I WAS BACKSTAGE. 
PEOPLE ARE COMING UP TO ME. 
MISTER PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 
SIR, FOR SAVING OUR NATION. 
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THAT MEANS. 
WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. 
HAD THE OTHER SIDE ONE, THEY 
WOULD'VE POURED ON MORE 
REGULATIONS, RAISED YOUR TAXES. 
THEY WOULD'VE DONE THINGS THAT 
WERE SO BAD, YOU HAD A VERY LOW 
GDP. 
IT WAS 1.2%. 
IT WAS GOING DOWN. 
IT WAS GOING TO BE IN THE 
NEGATIVE. 
LAST QUARTER WE JUST HAD, 4.1%. 
AS YOU ALL KNOW. 
I ALWAYS SAY, IF I WOULD HAVE 
NEVER SAID THAT SHORTLY AFTER 
WINNING WE WOULD'VE HIT 4.1, 
THOSE PEOPLE BACK THERE 
WOULD'VE SAID THIS GUY, NO 
GOOD. 
FAKE NEWS. 
FAKE NEWS. 
HOW FAKE ARE THEY? 
FAKE NEWS AND THE RUSSIAN 
WITCHHUNT. 
WE HAVE A WHOLE BIG 
COMBINATION. 
WHERE IS THE COLLUSION? 
THEY ARE STILL LOOKING FOR 
COLLUSION. 
WHERE IS THE COLLUSION? 
FIND SOME COLLUSION. 
WE WANT TO FIND THE COLLUSION. 
AT THE BEATING HEART OF THIS 
ELECTION, IS BORDER SECURITY. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT. 
IOWA OFFICIALS AND SO MANY 
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN 
REPORTING NUMBERS WHERE THEY 
ARE HAVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
WITH PEOPLE COMING IN. 
PEOPLE ARE COMING IN. 
BUT WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT. 
WE HAVE MS-13 ON THE RUN. 
THEY POURED IN HERE WITH OBAMA. 
WE HAVE THEM ON THE RUN. 
BECAUSE WE LOVE THE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF I.C.E. 
A BLUE WAVE IN NOVEMBER, MEANS 
OPEN BORDERS, WHICH MEANS 
MASSIVE CRIME. 
A RED WAVE MEANS SAFETY AND 
STRENGTH. 
THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 
I.C.E. 
A VOTE FOR ANY DEMOCRAT IN 
NOVEMBER IS A VOTE TO ELIMINATE 
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY WILL OPEN OUR BORDERS AND 
SET LOOSE VICIOUS CRIMINALS AND 
VIOLENT PREDATORS. 
THEY WILL BE ALL OVER OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
THEY WILL BE PRAYING ON OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
YET, WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS ARE 
CALLING TO ABOLISH I.C.E. 
TODAY OUR BRAVE ICE OFFICERS 
SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED OUT A 14-
YEAR-OLD DEPORTATION ORDER 
AGAINST A TRAN 27 CRIMINAL 
LIVING IN NEW YORK. 
THE LAST KNOWN TRAN 27 LIVING 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET 
HIM OUT FOR DECADES. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA TRIED. 
THEY ALL TRIED. 
WE GOT HIM OUT. 
GONE. 
HE IS GONE. 
BACK IN GERMANY. 
I.C.E. 
OFFICERS ARE HEROES WHO UPHOLD 
OUR LAWS, AND THEY REALLY DO. 
THEY UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND DEFEND 
OUR COMMUNITIES, LIKE NOBODY 
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN. 
AND, YES, THEY ARE TOUGH, THEY 
ARE STRONG, THEY ARE SMART. 
THEY HAVE GREAT HEART. 
THEY GO INTO THESE COMMUNITIES 
LOADED UP WITH THE KIND OF 
CRIMINALS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 
DEALING WITH. 
THEY WALK IN LIKE IT IS ANOTHER 
DAY IN THE OFFICE. 
THEY ARE TOUGHER, THEY ARE 
STRONGER. 
IT IS WHAT THESE OTHER PEOPLE 
FEAR. 
BY THE WAY, OUR I.C.E. 
FOLKS AND BORDER PATROL FOLKS, 
THEY HAVE NO FEAR. 
THE JOB THEY DO IS INCREDIBLE. 
EITHER WAY, WHY -- BY THE WAY, 
WHILE WE ARE AT IT, OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE 
AND THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. 
EVERY SINGLE DAY, I.C.E. 
IS TRACKING DOWN DRUG DEALERS, 
PREDATORS AND KILLERS, AND WE 
ARE EITHER THROWING THEM IN JAIL
OR THROWING THEM OUT OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE I.C.E., IF 
YOU WANT TO PROTECT OUR BORDER 
AND OUR BORDER PATROL, IF YOU 
WANT TO STOP THIS CRAZINESS OF 
SANCTUARY CITIES, WHERE 
CRIMINALS ARE PROTECTED, TAKE A 
LOOK AT CHICAGO. 
HOW ABOUT THE MAYOR OF CHICAGO? 
IT IS LIKE A WAR ZONE. 
IT IS A GREAT CITY. 
IT IS LIKE A WAR ZONE. 
THIS IS WHAT THOSE POLICIES DO. 
LAST WEEK, 62 PEOPLE WERE SHOT 
AND 12 DIED. 
THIS IS OUR COUNTRY. 
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS. 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS 
PROUDLY WITH OUR COURAGEOUS 
I.C.E. 
OFFICERS AND BORDER PATROL 
AGENTS. 
AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW WHO 
WANTS THE WALL MORE THAN ANY OF 
US? 
I.C.E. 
AND BORDER PATROL, BECAUSE THEY 
KNOW THAT IS GOING TO BE A BIG, 
BIG FACTOR IN STOPPING THE 
DRUGS FROM COMING IN. 
THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS, WHICH IS 
WORSE ALL OVER THE WORLD, THEN 
AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR WORLD. 
HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. 
WHO WOULD BELIEVE, IT IS 
BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET. 
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SECURITY 
AND THIS ELECTION IS ALSO ABOUT 
JOBS. 
WE HAVE PRODUCED. 
WE HAVE PRODUCED. 
THANKS TO REPUBLICANS, OUR 
ECONOMY IS BOOMING, LIKE IT HAS 
NEVER BOOMED BEFORE. 
WE HAVE CREATED ANOTHER NUMBER 
THAT NOBODY WOULD HAVE 
BELIEVED, IF I SAID IT DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN. 
4 MILLION NEW JOBS SINCE THE 
ELECTION. 
NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT. 
ALMOST 3.9 MILLION AMERICANS 
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 
STAMPS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
THEY DON'T NEED THEM, BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE A JOB. 
THEY ARE EATING BETTER, NOW. 
THEY DON'T NEED FOOD STAMPS. 
ALMOST 4 MILLION, THINK OF IT. 
LAST YEAR IN WEST VIRGINIA, PER 
CAPITA INCOME GREW 40% FASTER 
THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. 
40%, CONGRATULATIONS. 
I TOLD YOU, LAST TIME I WAS 
HERE, YOU WEREN'T SO HAPPY LIKE 
YOU ARE NOW. 
WE HAVE ADDED OVER 400,000 NEW 
MANUFACTURING JOBS NATIONWIDE. 
THAT NUMBER IS SOON GOING TO 
EXCEED 600,000. 
AND OUR OPPONENTS SAID, THERE'S 
NO SUCH THING AS MANUFACTURING 
JOBS ANYMORE, RIGHT? 
AND I SAID, I SEE, WERE NOT 
GOING TO MAKE THINGS ANYMORE. 
THINK OF IT. 
WE WILL BE CLOSE TO 600,000, 
VERY SOON. 
WE HAVE COMPANIES POURING INTO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
THESE ARE COMPANIES WHO LEFT. 
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO 
MICHIGAN. 
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
THEY ARE COMING BACK TO 
PENNSYLVANIA AND OHIO. 
THEY ARE COMING TO FLORIDA. 
THEY ARE COMING BACK, NOT JUST 
OPENING, THEY ARE COMING BACK. 
THEY LEFT AND NOW THEY ARE 
COMING BACK, BECAUSE THEY WANT 
TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS AND 
THE ACTION IS IN THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA. 
SO, THE ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS I 
SAID, WHEN IT HIT 4.1%, EVERYONE
WAS LIKE THAT IS AMAZING, 
EXCEPT ME. 
IT WILL GO MUCH HIGHER. 
WHEN I FINISHED THESE TRADE 
DEALS, AND THE TARIFFS ARE VERY 
IMPORTANT, THESE COMPANIES COME 
IN AND I SAY TO THE EUROPEAN 
UNION, VERY NICE PEOPLE, I SAY, 
WE WOULD LIKE TO NEGOTIATE A 
NEW TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE 
EUROPEAN UNION. 
WE LOST $151 BILLION OVER THE 
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS, PER YEAR. 
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT 151 
BILLION PER YEAR IS? 
HE PROMPTLY SAID, MISTER 
PRESIDENT, BUT WE ARE VERY 
HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 
I SAID, I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH 
THE DEAL, IF I WERE YOU, TOO. 
I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY. 
I SAID A SECOND TIME, A THIRD 
TIME AND A FOURTH TIME. 
THEY WERE HAPPY WITH THE DEAL. 
WE WEREN'T HAPPY. 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BARRIERS UP 
AND THEY HAVE TARIFFS. 
YOU WANT TO BUILD A CAR AND 
SEND IT TO EUROPE. 
HOW MANY CHEVROLETS ARE THERE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF BERLIN? 
NOT TOO MANY. 
MAYBE ONE. 
I DOUBT IT. 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND ONE. 
SO THEY HAVE BARRIERS. 
I SAID, COME ON, LET'S GO. 
I SAID THIS TO NUMEROUS 
COUNTRIES. 
LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE 
GOING TO DO. 
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE CARS. 
WE ARE GOING TO PUT A $.25 TAX 
ON EVERY CAR THAT COMES FROM 
THE EUROPEAN UNION INTO THE U.S.
AND THAT WILL TAKE OUR LOSS AND 
TRADE DEFICIT OF $151 BILLION 
AND IT WILL GIVE US A SURPLUS 
OF $151 BILLION. 
THAT IS A FAIRLY DRAMATIC SWING 
AND THAT WILL TAKE ONE LITTLE 
SIGNATURE, DONALD J. TRUMP.
>>> WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA. 
I USED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 
I DID NOT PRESS IT INITIALLY 
BECAUSE I WANTED THEM TO HELP 
US WITH NORTH KOREA AND THEY 
HAD AND WE ARE DOING WELL WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
THEY SAY WHAT'S HAPPENING, HEY 
FOLKS, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING 
THIS FOR 75 YEARS. 
WHAT HAPPENED? 
I CAN TELL YOU, AND I GOT ALONG 
VERY WELL WITH KIM. 
REALLY WELL. 
THERE'S BEEN NO -- 
>> WE ARE GETTING THINGS GOING. 
PAYING $1.8 MILLION IN CASH. 
AND THEY SAY WHAT IS TAKING SO 
LONG? 
I SAID, FOR 40 OR 60 YEARS, 
DOING -- DURING THE NUCLEAR AGE 
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING. 
NO ONE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE 
FACT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS 
UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH 
NORTH KOREA AND CONSIDERED THIS 
LIKE JUST, READ THE PAPERS YOU 
WILL SEE WHAT HE SAID SO I'VE 
BEEN REALLY HONEST AND WHO 
KNOWS, I HAVE BEEN TAKING OFF 
THESE SANCTIONS BUT THEY HAVE 
TO GET READY TO BE RID OF THE 
NUKES. 
THEY HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM 
BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
MAYBE IT WILL WORK OUT BUT I 
THINK THAT WE HAVE DONE A GOOD 
JOB IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
REMEMBER THEY WERE EXTREMELY 
HOSTILE AND SAID THAT I WAS 
GOING TO GET THEM INTO A WAR. 
THEY THOUGHT MY RHETORIC WAS 
TOO STRONG. 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I 
DON'T WANT TO INSULT CHAIRMAN 
KIM. 
YOU REMEMBER. 
ELTON JOHN, I DON'T WANT TO 
INSULT HIM SO I WON'T MENTION 
IT BUT, THE FAKE NEWS BACK 
THERE SAID HE IS GOING TO GET 
US INTO A WAR. HE IS CRAZY. 
THIS GUY, HE IS CRAZY, OUR 
PRESIDENT IS CRAZY. 
AND THEN I WENT TO MEET 
EVERYONE THAT RUNS NATO, THE 
LEADERS OF NATO AND THEY 
WEREN'T PAYING THEIR BILLS, 
THEY WERE DELINQUENT. 
AND IN REAL ESTATE, I LOVE REAL 
ESTATE, WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR 
RENT YOU ARE DELINQUENT. 
AND I MET THEM LAST YEAR. 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL, THE 
GREAT GUY, -- A GREAT GUY. HE 
WAS IN CHARGE OF NATO BUT HE 
COULD NOT GET ANY MONEY BUT 
LAST YEAR I WENT A YEAR AGO AND 
SAID, YOU AREN'T PAYING YOUR 
BILLS, YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR 
BILLS. 
HE PICKED UP $44 BILLION. 
BUT THEY DID NOT REPRESS THAT 
MIKE REPORT THAT TO THE PRESS 
-- REPORT THAT TO THE PRESS. 
WE ARE GOING TO PICK UP AT 
LEAST ANOTHER CLOSE TO $100 
BILLION EXTRA. I SAID, YOU HAVE 
TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 
THE UNITED STATES IS PAYING 
CLOSE TO 90% OF THE COST FOR 
PROTECTING EUROPE WHICH I THINK 
IS WONDERFUL AND I SAID, FOLKS 
NATO IS BETTER FOR YOU THAN IT 
IS FOR US. 
BELIEVE ME. 
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THEY 
ASKED THE QUESTION, THEY HAVE 
SMALL COUNTRIES, BIG COUNTRIES, 
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT 
THEM. 
THEY SAID LOOK, IT'S SIMPLE, 
PAY UP. 
PAY YOUR BILLS. 
AND SOMEONE SAID SIR, THERE'S A 
PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY SHOWING 
ME RESPECT, I SAID YES MISTER 
PRESIDENT HE SAID, WOULD YOU 
LEAVE US IF WE DON'T PAY OUR 
BILLS? 
AND THEY DID NOT LIKE MY ANSWER.
AND I SAID YES I WOULD HAVE TO 
CONSIDER THIS. 
YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR BILLS. 
THEY HATED THAT ANSWER. 
BUT IF I SAID NO, I WON'T LEAVE 
YOU AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY 
YOUR BILLS, I PROMISE WE WILL 
ALWAYS PROTECT YOU AND YOU WILL 
ALWAYS BE PROTECTED DON'T PAY 
YOUR BILLS, THEN THEY WON'T 
EVER PAY THEIR BILLS. 
SO I SAID, YES I WILL LEAVE IF 
YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS. 
AND YOU COULD SEE THOSE CHECKS 
COMING OUT FOR BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS SO THEY PAID THEIR 
BILLS AND I THINK WE WILL PICK 
UP OVER THE NEXT SHORT WHILE. 
OVER $100 BILLION. 
AND THEN THEY SAID, THE FAKE 
NEWS SAID, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TREATED THE NATO NATION LEADERS
, I PUT THIS IN BRACKETS, WHO 
HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF. 
TREATED THE NATO LEADERS WITH 
TREMENDOUS CONTEMPT AND 
DISRESPECT. 
AND I SAID, NO. 
THEY DISRESPECTED OUR COUNTRY 
BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT PAY. 
NOW THEY ARE PAYING. 
HOW ABOUT IF WE GOT INTO A 
CONFLICT BECAUSE A COUNTRY WAS 
ATTACKED AND NOW WE ARE IN 
WORLD WAR III? 
WE ARE PROTECTING A COUNTRY 
THAT WAS ATTACKED AND DIDN'T 
PAY ITS BILLS I WOULD FEEL SO 
STUPID. 
WE ARE PROTECTING A COUNTRY 
THAT WAS NOT PAYING ITS BILLS 
SO I GOT THEM TO PAY $100 
BILLION. 
IT COULDN'T BE MUCH MORE THAN 
THAT BUT IT WAS A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF MONEY. 
NOW THEY ARE PAYING NOW. 
THEN THEY MADE THE STATEMENT 
THAT I SHOWED GREAT DISRESPECT 
BUT ACTUALLY, I HAVE A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF THOSE 
PEOPLE. 
28 PEOPLE. 
ALL OF THEM. 
BECAUSE NOW THEY RESPECT US. 
THEY RESPECT OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. 
THEY DID NOT RESPECT OUR 
COUNTRY. 
BUT THEY RESPECT US AGAIN AND 
YOU SEE THIS WITH CHINA. CHINA 
WAS WALKING THEIR WAY DOWN THAT 
NOW THEY ARE MARKING THEIR WAY 
DOWN TO 30% BUT I WANT THEM TO 
DO WELL AND I WANT TO BE THEIR 
FRIEND BUT WE HAD TO DO'S -- WE 
HAD TO DO THINGS WE HAD TO DO. 
WE WERE GOING INTO A CERTAIN 
DIRECTION THAT WOULD ALLOW 
DIRECTIONS -- CHINA TO BE 
BIGGER THAN US IN A SHORT 
AMOUNT OF TIME. 
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
ANYMORE. 
THE LONG WINDING ROAD, YOU 
KNOW? 
I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR 
CHINA. 
THE ENERGY, THE GENIUS, IT IS 
INCREDIBLE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE 
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A 
GREAT RELATIONSHIP THAT IT HAS 
TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE A TWO-WAY 
STREET WITH EVERYONE. 
OUR ENEMIES AND OUR FRIENDS AND 
ALLIES, OUR ALLIES TREAT US 
WORSE THAN OUR ENEMIES. 
BELIEVE IT. 
SO IT'S ALL CHANGING AND WHEN 
WE GET THE TRADE DEALS DONE 
PROPERLY, YOU KNOW WHAT BOTHERS 
ME? 
I HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO ME, 
SOME PEOPLE IN CONGRESS, SIR 
CAN YOU GET THIS DEAL DONE 
IMMEDIATELY? 
I SAID IT DOES NOT WORK THIS 
WAY I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO 
FAST. 
WE HAVE TO TAKE TIME AND WE 
HAVE TO GESTATE. 
LIKE WHEN YOU ARE COOKING A 
CHICKEN. 
TIME. 
TURKEY FOR THINGS GIVING. 
MY MOTHER WOULD SAY, EIGHT 
HOURS. 
I SAID EIGHT HOURS? 
SHE MADE THE GREATEST TURKEY I 
HAVE EVER HAD, IT TAKES TIME. ú 
>> IT TAKES TIME. 
SO WHEN THEY RUN AND THEY SAY, 
COULD YOU DO NATO RIGHT NOW? 
CAN'T WE SIGN IT NEXT WEEK I 
SAY LOOK, I LIKE MEXICO, I LIKE 
THE NEW LEADER AND I THINK HE'S 
GOING TO BE TERRIFIC A LITTLE 
DIFFERENT FROM WHO WE ARE BUT I 
THINK I AM DOING BETTER WITH 
HIM THAN WHEN THE CAPITALISTS 
BUT HE KNOWS THAT MEXICO NEEDS 
THE UNITED STATES, THEY NEED 
THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA 
CHARGES US CLOSE TO 300% 
TARIFFS FOR DAIRY PRODUCTS 
OING INTO CANADA WHICH IS 
ESSENTIALLY SAYING WE DON'T 
WANT YOUR DAIRY PRODUCTS THIS 
IS A WALL THEY HAVE A WALL IN A 
DIFFERENT WAY, A ECONOMIC WALL. 
I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE 
TOO MUCH FUN BUT I CAN'T DO 
THAT. 
HE IS A NICE GUY JUSTIN. 
BUT THEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT WE HAVE 
TO TAKE OUR TIME. 
WITH THAT SAID, WE ARE DOING 
VERY WELL AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY 
WITH A GOOD DEAL AND A FAIR 
DEAR -- A FAIR DEAL. 
A FAIR DEAL WITH MEXICO. 
AND YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY, AS 
AN EXAMPLE, WHEN CHINA MAKES A 
CAR THEY SELL IT IN TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
2 1/2% TARIFFS OF WHICH THEY DO 
NOT PAY SO THEN THEY PAY 
NOTHING. 
BUT THAT, IT IS A WONDERFUL 
DEAL. 
WE SELL IT INTO CHINA. 
IT'S A 25% TARIFFS. A MAN WAS 
DRIVING DOWN THE STREET IN 
CHINA AND HE LOOKED OVER AND IT 
WAS A CHEVROLET LIKE CAMARO. 
I THINK IT COST 39 OR $40,000. 
HE IS IN BEIJING AND HE SHOUTS 
ACROSS AND, THEY ARE STOPPED, 
HE SHOUTS ACROSS, TELL ME HOW 
MUCH DID THAT CAR COST IN 
CHINA? 
AND THE GUY LOOKS, $119,000. 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT? 
IT IS ALL TAXES AND TAXES AND 
TAXES AND WE CAN'T DO THAT 
ANYMORE. 
WE CAN'T DO IT. 
WE ARE A COUNTRY WITH 
UNBELIEVABLE POTENTIAL. 
WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN 
RIPPED OFF BY EVERYONE AND WE 
WON'T TO BE RIPPED OFF ANY 
LONGER. 
IF IT TAKES ME A LITTLE ANGST 
TO TELL SENATORS AND 
CONGRESSMEN AND THE PEOPLE WHO 
REALLY HAVE YOUR, YOUR HEART IN 
THEIR HANDS IN MANY CASES. 
SOMETIMES I WONDER WHERE THEY 
ARE COMING FROM WITH THESE 
SUGGESTIONS BUT IT WILL HAVE TO 
TAKE THAT LITTLE BIT OF TIME. 
BUT WE ARE MOVING SO FAST AND 
NO ONE CAN BELIEVE IT AND EVERY 
COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A 
DEAL BECAUSE WE ARE LIKE A 
PIGGY BANK THAT EVERYONE WANTS 
TO ROB AND WE WON'T LET THEM 
ROB US ANYMORE. 
IS THAT OKAY WEST VIRGINIA? 
WE WON'T LET THEM ROB US 
ANYMORE. 
  
>> EVERY DAY WE ARE KEEPING OUR 
PROMISES. 
WE ARE CANCELING OBAMA'S 
ILLEGAL ANTI-COAL DESTROYING 
REGULATIONS. 
THE SO-CALLED, CLEAN POWER PLANT
DOESN'T THAT SOUND NICE? 
CLEAN POWER? WHEN I ENDED THE 
PARIS ACCORD WHAT IS A MORE 
BEAUTIFUL NAME THEN THE PARIS 
ACCORD? 
LET'S CALL IT THE WEST VIRGINIA 
ACCORD THAT I WANT TO SIGN. BUT 
WHEN I ENTERED IT IT WOULD COST 
US HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS. HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS. 
AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS AN 
EXAMPLE, CHINA, THEY DID NOT 
KICK IN UNTIL MANY YEARS IN THE 
FUTURE. 
WE KICKED IN IMMEDIATELY. 
RUSSIA WENT BACK MANY YEARS 
WHICH WAS NOT A CLEAN TIME IN 
TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? 
WE AGREE WE WANT A CLEAN AND 
STRONG ENVIRONMENT. 
I WANT CLEAN AIR, CRYSTAL CLEAN 
WATER AND WE HAVE GOT IT. 
WE HAVE GOT THE CLEANEST COUNTRY
, THE CLEANEST COUNTRY AND THE 
PLANET RIGHT NOW BUT I'M 
GETTING RID OF SOME OF THESE 
RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH ARE 
KILLING OUR COMPANIES. WE 
ANNOUNCED THE CLEAN ENERGY 
PROPOSAL WHICH WILL HELP OUR 
COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS AND 
SAVE CONSUMERS, YOU, ME, 
EVERYONE BILLIONS AND BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS. 
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF JOB KILLING 
REGULATIONS. 
AND REPUBLICANS HAVE PASSED THE 
BIGGEST TAX CUTS AND REFORM, 
THE REFORM IS VERY IMPORTANT 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE SAID. 
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
REFORM BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS 
WHAT THIS MEANS I SAID, HOW 
BECAUSE -- HOW IS IT THAT IT 
HAS BEEN SINCE RONALD REAGAN 
SINCE THE LAST BIG TAX CUT AND 
THEY DIDN'T KNOW. 
A LOT OF THEM CAME UP TO SEE ME 
AND HAD THE 2018 TAX REFORM. 
AND I SAID, WHAT IS THAT MEAN? 
ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE TAXES 
THAN I FOUND OUT THIS IS WHAT 
THEY HAVE DONE FOR 40 YEARS. 
TAX REFORM. 
AND I SAID NO ONE KNOWS WHAT 
THIS MEANS AND WE HAVE REFORM 
IN THERE. 
A GREAT REFORM BUT THEY SAID NO 
ONE KNOWS. 
AND I SAID NO ONE KNOWS WHAT 
THIS MEANS. 
I WANT TO PUT THIS DOWN, TAX 
CUTS. 
I SAID WHAT WOULD BE OUR 
FAVORITE NAME? 
I SAID THE TAX CUT-CUT-CUT TO 
BILL. 
AND WE ALMOST DID THAT, WE 
ALMOST DID THAT BUT IN ALL 
FAIRNESS IN THIS CASE COUPLE OF 
THEM THOUGHT IT WAS TACKY. SO 
WE CALLED IT THE TAX CUT AND 
JOBS BILL BUT WE HAVE DONE 
GREAT REFORM. 
IT WAS THE BIGGEST TAX CUT. 
AND YOU ARE BENEFITING FROM IT. 
YOU ARE BENEFITING FROM IT AND 
COMPANIES ARE BENEFITING. THEY 
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PROVIDING 
ALL OF THE JOBS. 
WE ARE SETTING RECORDS WITH OUR 
JOBS AND PROTECTING, IT'S SO 
IMPORTANT FOR WEST VIRGINIA AND 
A LOT OF STATES, TEXTING AGAIN, 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. 
 . 
>> WE ARE STANDING UP TO SOCIAL 
MEDIA CENSORSHIP THAT IS THE 
NEW THING THAT IS THE NEW 
THING. 
YOU KNOW? 
I WOULD RATHER HAVE FAKE NEWS 
LIKE CNN, IT'S TRUE, THEN HAVE 
ANYONE INCLUDING LIBERALS, 
SOCIALISTS, ANYTHING, THEN HAVE 
ANYONE STOPPED OR CENSORED. 
WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT. 
WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH FAKE NEWS 
THERE'S TOO MANY SOURCES. 
EVERYONE IS LIKE A NEWSPAPER. 
YOU HAVE TWITTER, WHATEVER YOU 
HAVE, FACEBOOK. 
EVERYONE. 
YOU CAN'T HAVE CENSORSHIP. 
YOU CAN'T PICK ONE PERSON AND 
SAY, WELL WE DON'T LIKE WHAT HE 
HAS BEEN SAYING SO HE IS OUT SO 
WE LIVE WITH FAKE NEWS. 
I HATE TO SAY IT BUT WE HAVE NO 
CHOICE BECAUSE THIS IS BY FAR 
BETTER ALTERNATIVE WE CAN'T 
HAVE PEOPLE SAYING CENSORSHIP 
BECAUSE IT COULD TURN AROUND 
AND BE THEM NEXT. 
IT COULD BE THEM NEXT. 
WE BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT FOR 
AMERICANS TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS. 
WE REPEAL THE CORE OF OBAMA 
CARE. 
I TOLD YOU, INDIVIDUAL MANDATE 
BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE 
CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WE HAVE 
TO GIVE THEM ACCESS AND 
HEALTHCARE TO PEOPLE. 
WE WANT THE RIGHT TO TRY. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET 
THIS FOR 40 YEARS AND COULD NOT 
GET IT. 
A PERSON IS TERMINALLY ILL 
TERMINALLY ILL, THEY ARE REALLY 
SICK AND I KNOW PEOPLE IF THEY 
HAVE MONEY TO TRAVEL ALL OVER 
THE WORLD TO TRY TO FIND A CURE 
AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY 
THEY DIE. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS 
IN THE WORLD WHICH IS WHY CHINA 
AND SO MANY OTHERS ARE TRYING 
TO STEAL OUR TECHNOLOGY AND WE 
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN. 
THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE 
THAT WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. 
IT IS LIKE HOPE. 
THE RIGHT TO TRY. 
I LOVE THAT NAME. 
THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THIS 
BEFORE. 
SO IF A PERSON IS TERMINALLY 
ILL AND WE HAVE A GREAT DEW 
DROP THAT IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER 
TWO OR THREE AERIALS -- THREE 
YEARS TO HAVE IT APPROACHED BUT 
THE TESTS ARE LOOKING GOOD AND 
THIS PERSON IS SICK AND THIS 
PERSON IS GOING TO BE DEAD IN 
90 DAYS AND WE COULD NOT GET 
THE DRUG FOR THAT PERSON NO 
MATTER WHO YOU WERE AND I SAID, 
WAIT A MINUTE WHAT IS THE STORY 
WITH IT? 
NOW, THERE WERE SOME 
COMPLICATIONS. 
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD 
PROBLEMS, EVERYONE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE DID NOT 
UNDERSTAND THE STATS. 
IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING AND I 
WONDERED WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE RIGHT 
TO TRY AND WE WENT THROUGH WITH 
THE HELP OF COREY, YOU'RE GREAT 
AND WONDERFUL, YOU ARE A COAL 
LOVER, WITH THE HELP OF 
SHELLEY. 
SOON TO BE WITH THE HELP OF 
PATRICK. 
PATRICK IS GOING TO GET A LOT 
OF THINGS. 
WE GOT IT APPROVED. 
SO NOW IF WE HAVE A GREAT THING 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED AND 
SOMEONE HAS A CERTAIN ILLNESS 
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE, THEY 
WILL BE ABLE TO TRY AND YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
SOME OF THE DRUGS WE HAVE IN 
THE BLEND ARE AMAZING AND IT 
WILL WORK FOR MANY PEOPLE AND 
GIVE THEM HOPE IT'S GOING TO 
GIVE THEM HOPE. 
  
>> WE JUST SECURED $6 BILLION 
TO FIGHT TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
AND I KNOW IN WEST VIRGINIA 
THAT IS A BIG DEAL, RIGHT? 
IT IS A BIG DEAL. WE CONFIRMED 
A RECORD NUMBER OF CIRCUIT 
COURT JUDGES, IT IS A RECORD 
AND IT'S GETTING BIGGER AND 
BIGGER. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM IF 
SCHUMER WOULD EVER GET THEM 
APPROVED. 
HE'S NOT THRILLED ABOUT 
APPROVING. 
WE CONFIRMED THE GREAT DEAL. 
TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
AND AS I JUST SAID, JUSTICE 
BRETT CAVANAUGH IS DOING GREAT. 
IT LOOKS TOUGH. 
CENTRAL CASTING. 
HOW DO YOU VOTE AGAINST HIM? 
BUT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT FIND A 
WAY. 
WE HAVE SECURED A RECORD $700 
BILLION FOR OUR MILITARY THIS 
YEAR AND $716 BILLION, BILLION 
WITH A B. OUR MILITARY WILL BE 
STRONGER AND BIGGER AND BETTER 
AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN IT 
HAS EVER BEEN. 
EVER. 
 
>> HOPEFULLY WE WILL NEVER HAVE 
TO USE IT . YOU DON'T GET A LOT 
OF GOOD FIGHTERS OUT HERE, I 
SEE SOME OF THEM AND I KNOW 
SOME OF THEM. 
A ONE -- THE STRONGER YOUR 
MILITARY, THE BETTER CHANCE YOU 
WILL HAVE OF NEVER HAVING TO 
USE IT. 
WE DON'T WANT TO USE IT. 
WE DON'T WANT TO. 
  
>> ALL OF THAT EQUIPMENT IS 
BEING BUILT RIGHT HERE IN THE 
USA. 
WE MAKE THE GREATEST FIGHTER 
JETS IN THE WORLD, THE GREATEST 
SHIPS IN THE WORLD WE MAKE THE 
GREATEST MISSILES AND ROCKETS. 
NO ONE DOES IT LIKE US. 
AND FROM MY DIRECTION THE 
PENTAGON HAS WORKED HARD TO 
CREATE THE SIX BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES THE 
"SPACE FORCE". 
  
>> IS VERY EXCITING. 
WE NEED THEM. THAT IS THE NEW 
FRONTIER. 
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 
SENDING ROCKETS TO THE MOON. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT MILITARY, 
THIS IS WHERE IT'S AT. 
THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
UN AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY, WE 
HAVE REDUCED THE UNITED NATIONS 
SPENDING BY $1.3 BILLION SAVING 
U.S. TAX DOLLARS, $350 MILLION 
BUT NO ONE WANTS TO WRITE ABOUT 
THAT. WE JUST PASSED A LANDMARK 
VA ACCOUNTABILITY LAW WHERE 
PEOPLE THAT DON'T TREAT OUR 
VETS PROPERLY. 
WE LOOK AT THEM AND WE SAY YOU 
ARE FIRED GET OUT. 
45 YEARS. 45 YEARS THEY HAVE 
TRIED TO PASS THIS AND WE ALSO 
PASSED VETERANS CHOICE SO THAT 
IF OUR VETERANS CAN'T GET THE 
CARE THAT THEY NEED THEY HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO SEE A PRIVATE 
DOCTOR. 
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT IN 
LINE FOR THREE WEEKS, FOUR 
WEEKS, TWO MONTHS. 
I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE IRAN NUCLEAR 
DEAL. 
  AND THIS MONTH WE 
REIMPOSED TOUGH SANCTIONS ON 
THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM. I 
RECOGNIZE THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL 
AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY 
IN JERUSALEM. 
  I UNDERSTAND NOW 
WHAT HAPPENED. 
EVERY PRESIDENT, MANY PRESIDENTS
THEY SAID, WE ARE GOING TO DO 
IT. 
WE GOING -- WE ARE GOING TO 
MOVE OUR EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM 
IT'S GOING TO BE THE CAPITAL OF 
ISRAEL AND WE ARE GOING TO DO 
IT THEN THEY DON'T DO IT. 
POLITICIANS THEY DON'T DO IT SO 
I SAID I'M GOING TO DO THIS 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND I SAID 
THIS RIGHT HERE IN WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
AND I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY MANY-
MANY PRESIDENTS BEFORE ME SAID 
THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT THAT 
DID NOT BECAUSE I WAS INUNDATED 
WITH CALLS FROM FOREIGN 
LEADERS, EVERY COUNTRY, DON'T 
DO IT, DON'T DO IT. PLEASE 
DON'T DO IT. 
DON'T DO IT! 
SO ACTUALLY WHAT I DID, I WAS 
FIVE DAYS OFF AND I STOPPED 
TAKING CALLS AND I WOULD SAY I 
WILL CALL YOU BACK NEXT WEEK. 
I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
SO, I APPROVED IT. IT SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN YEARS AGO. [ APPLAUSE 
]  
>> IF THERE IS EVER GOING TO BE 
PEACE, REMEMBER I SAID, IT WAS 
A GOOD THING TO HAVE DONE 
BECAUSE WE TOOK IT OFF OF THE 
TABLE. 
EVERY TIME THERE WERE PEACE 
TALKS THEY NEVER WERE PASSED 
JERUSALEM BECOMING THE CAPITAL. 
SO LET'S TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE 
I SAID. 
AND IN THE NEGOTIATION ISRAEL 
WILL HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED A BIG THING 
BUT I TOOK THIS OFF OF THE 
TABLE AND THEY COULD NEVER GET 
BY. 
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. 
YOU BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT. 
SHELLEY, THEY COULDN'T GET PAST 
THE FACT OF JERUSALEM BECOMING 
THE CAPITAL. 
NOW IT IS OFF OF THE TABLE AND 
THERE'S NOTHING TO NEGOTIATE 
BUT THEY WILL GET SOMETHING 
VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT IS THEIR 
TURN SO LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
I'VE HEARD THAT WAS THE 
TOUGHEST DEAL OF ALL DEALS AND 
IT'S CALLED PEACE BETWEEN 
ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS AND 
THEY SAY IT'S THE TOUGHEST OF 
ALL DEALS SO LET'S SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS SO INSTEAD OF 
APOLOGIZING THIS IS WHAT WE ARE 
DOING WE ARE WINNING AND 
INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR 
AMERICA, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
AMERICA AND WE ARE STANDING UP 
FOR THE HEROES WHO DEFEND OUR 
COUNTRY BUT TO CONTINUE THIS 
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WE MUST 
ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS.

FROM MORGANTOWN TO MADISON TO 
CHARLESTON, THIS GREAT STATE 
WAS SETTLED BY TOUGH PIONEER 
MEN AND STRONG PIONEER WOMEN 
WHO TAMED THE WORLDLINESS IN 
ORDER TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE 
FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR 
INCREDIBLE AMERICAN FAMILIES, 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY, BUT THEY HAD GRIT AND 
FACE. THEY LOVED EACH OTHER -- 
FAITH, THEY LOVE EACH OTHER AND 
THEY ARE SMART. 
WE ARE SMART REMEMBER. 
I SAY ALL OF THE TIME, WE ARE 
ELITE. 
YOU ARE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE 
AND YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THAN 
THEY ARE. 
YOU HAVE BETTER JOBS. 
YOU ARE THE ELITE. 
LET THEM HAVE THE WORD ELITE AS 
YOU ARE THE SUPER ELITE. 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 
I ALWAYS HATE WHEN THEY SAY, 
WELL THE ELITE DECIDED NOT TO 
GO TO SOMETHING I'M DOING. 
THE ELITE. 
THEY SAY WELL, I'VE GOT A LOT 
MORE MONEY THAN THEY DO. 
I HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION THAN 
THEY. 
I AM SMARTER THAN THEY ARE. 
I HAVE MANY AND MUCH MORE 
BEAUTIFUL HOMES THAN THEY DO. 
I HAVE A BETTER APARTMENT AT 
THE TOP OF FIFTH AVENUE WHY ARE 
THEY THE ELITE? 
TELL ME? 
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ELITE SO 
REMEMBER THAT. 
THEY ARE NOT THE ELITE. 
THAT IS JUST A NAME. 
AREN'T YOU INSULTED WHEN THEY 
SAY THAT? 
I'M ALWAYS INSULTED. 
THEY ARE NOT THE ELITE. 
YOUR PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE THAT 
PROCEEDED YOU IN WEST VIRGINIA 
WERE THE CARPENTERS AND COAL 
MINERS, THE MINISTERS, THE 
METALWORKERS, THE FACTORY 
WORKERS AND THEY ALL HAD ONE 
THING IN COMMON, THEY LOVED 
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR 
COUNTRIES, THEY LOVED THEIR GOD.
  WE STAND ON THE 
SHOULDERS OF GENERATIONS OF 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO KNEW HOW 
TO FIGHT AND THEY KNEW HOW TO 
WIN. 
WE ARE WINNING AGAIN. 
WE ARE WINNING AGAIN. 
JUST LIKE THEM, WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP ON FIGHTING AND WE WILL 
KEEP ON WINNING AND WE ARE 
GOING TO WIN FOR OUR NATION, WE 
ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR 
CONTINUED FREEDOM. 
I JOKE THAT I WILL HAVE PATRICK 
MORRISSEY COMING TO ME SOON AND 
HE WILL BE YOUR SENATOR AND HE 
WILL SAY, MISTER PRESIDENT, THE 
PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA CAN'T 
STAND WINNING SO MUCH, THEY 
HAVE NOT ONE IN DECADES AND NOW 
YOU ARE WAITING WITH COLE AND 
EVERYTHING -- AND NOW YOU ARE 
WINNING WITH EVERYTHING. 
HE'S GOING TO SAY, MISTER 
PRESIDENT PLEASE, THEY DON'T 
WANT TO WIN SO MUCH, THEY CAN'T 
STAND IT. 
PLEASE, YOU ARE WINNING TOO 
MUCH FOR WEST VIRGINIA. 
PLEASE STOP WINNING AND I'M 
GOING TO SAY, PATRICK I'M 
SORRY. 
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE HELL THE 
PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA WANT, 
WERE GONNA KEEP ON WINNING 
ANYWAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S 
WHAT THEY WANT,  RIGHT? 
  
>> THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT. 
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF WEST 
VIRGINIA NEVER GIVE UP, THEY 
NEVER GIVE IN AND THEY NEVER 
BACK DOWN. 
WE ARE AMERICANS AND OUR HEARTS 
BLEED RED, WHITE, AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD. 
TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA 
WEALTHY AGAIN, THAT IS HAPPENING
, THAT IS HAPPENING FASTER THAN 
THE FAKE NEWS EVER SAID IT 
COULD HAPPEN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA 
SAFE AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU WEST VIRGINIA, THANK 
YOU. 
  
>> YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT 
YOU WANT. 
>> WE JUST HEARD THE PRESIDENT, 
ONE OF HIS MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN RALLIES IN WEST VIRGINIA. 
HE WAS DELIVERING HIS CLASSIC 
MESSAGE OF AMERICA FIRST AND 
BEING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION, 
RINGING UP THE MOLLY -- THE 
MOLLIE TIBBETTS CASE AND  THE 
ISIS DEPORTATION OF A  
WAR CRIMINAL HERE IN QUEENS  
AND IS THERE TO CAMPAIGN FOR 
PARICK MORRISEY WHO IS RUNNING 
FOR INCUMBENT SENATOR  JOE 
MANCHIN. 
IT WAS A PART OF  HIS SPEECH 
TODAY TO RALLY SUPPORT FOR 
REPUBLICANS AHEAD OF THE 
MIDTERMS. 
JOINING ME NOW FROM CHARLESTON 
WEST VIRGINIA'S WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT THERE AT THE 
PRESIDENTS RALLY. 
TELUS ABOUT THE MOOD ON THE 
GROUND? 
>> Reporter: THERE IS NO DOUBT 
ABOUT IT WEST VIRGINIA LOVES 
DONALD TRUMP AND THE MOOD WAS 
EXTREMELY ENERGETIC AND TO SOME 
EXTENT HE WAVED TO THE AUDIENCE 
AND FOR THAT REASON IT FELT 
LIKE A MIXTURE OF TRUMP'S 
GREATEST HITS WITH SOME OF HIS 
MORE RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND 
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE THE USUAL 
CHANCE, -- THERE WAS THE USUAL 
CHANTING CONDEMNING THE MEDIA 
OR BUILDING THE WALL BUT ONE 
THING THAT STRUCK ME IS THAT HE 
DID NOT MENTION, MAYBE THE 
HEADLINE HERE IN WEST VIRGINIA, 
FOR ABOUT 60 MINUTES INTO HIS 
SPEECH, WHAT THE EVENING DID 
TODAY, TO ROLLBACK A RONNIE 
ERROR REGULATIONS -- IRAN ERROR 
REGULATIONS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE 
MENTIONED COAL MINERS AND HOW 
MUCH HE LIKED COAL MINERS HE 
TOOK THAT MUCH TIME TO BE VERY 
SPECIFIC AND TO CELEBRATE WHAT 
IS A VICTORY FOR HIS 
ADMINISTRATION AND FOR WEST 
VIRGINIANS AS THEY VIEW IT. 
HIS SPEECH HERE WAS ALL OVER 
THE PLACE AS YOU MENTIONED. 
TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM 
REPLACING JOE MANCHIN  AND 
PARICK MORRISEY, TAX REFORM, 
OBAMA CARE,  AND SO I CAN'T PUT 
MY FINGER ON EXACTLY WHAT THE 
MESSAGE WAS TONIGHT EXCEPT 
VOTING IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION 
IS CRITICAL. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE 
CONTINUED TO COME BACK TO OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN. 
>> HE VERY NOTABLY DIDN'T 
MENTION PAUL MANAFORT OR 
MICHAEL COHEN. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> Reporter: AFTER THE DAY WE 
HAD TODAY. 
THE BREAKING NEWS WITH THESE 
TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE VERY CLOSE 
TO HIM DURING THE CAMPAIGN IT 
IS NOT SURPRISING HE DID NOT 
BRING IT UP BUT I HAVE TO SAY 
THE FACT THAT HE RAMPED UP THE 
NEED FOR VOTING IN THE NOVEMBER 
MIDTERMS, THAT WAS IN THE 
BACKDROP. 
I MEAN, LOOK THE FACT IS 
DESPITE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH
THEM BEING FOUND GUILTY RATHER 
IN THE CASE OF MANAFORT, TO 
THESE CRIMINAL CHARGES, THERE'S 
STILL A LOT OF GRAY AREA IN 
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT A 
SITTING PRESIDENT WILL BE 
INDICTED. 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER 
HAS INDICATED HE DOESN'T INTEND 
TO INDICT THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE 
HE IS A SITTING PRESIDENT BUT 
THERE ARE STILL DOORS OPEN 
THERE. 
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING 
DEFINITIVE. 
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT IS CHARGED WITH A 
CRIME. 
THIS STILL BRINGS IT CLOSER TO 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND TO 
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS IF THE 
DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL OF 
CONGRESS. WE KNOW THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE BRINGING FORWARD 
IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS AND IT'S 
REAL AND THE PRESIDENT IS AWARE 
OF THAT AND SO PERHAPS WE SAW 
SUCH AN EFFORT TODAY TO GET 
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS TO TURN ANY 
DEMOCRATIC SCENE INTO A 
REPUBLICAN ONE. 
>> AND A BIG PART OF THE EFFORT 
HERE WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR 
PATRICK MORRISSEY AS WE SAID, 
HE SPOKE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE 
BOOST THAT HIS ENDORSEMENT 
GIVES. 
IS THIS NOW GOING TO BE PART OF 
HIS STRATEGY AHEAD OF THE 
MIDTERMS? 
>> Reporter: IT'S ALREADY A 
STRATEGY IN MOTION AND WE'VE 
LREADY SEEN THE PRESIDENT 
HOLDING SEVERAL CAMPAIGN RALLIES
THAT ARE CAMPAIGN RALLIES FOR 
HIMSELF OF COURSE BUT THE 
HEADLINE, IT'S MEANT TO BE AN 
ENDORSEMENT FOR CANDIDATES 
GOING INTO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID MANY 
TIMES HE PLANS TO BE VERY 
INVOLVED. 
THE WHITE HOUSE UNVEILED THE 
PRESIDENTS PLAN THAT HE IS 
GOING TO BE BUSY. 
HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE ROAD 
AND CAMPAIGNING FOR THESE 
CANDIDATES. 
HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT A VOTE 
FOR WHATEVER CANDIDATE IS 
RUNNING IN WHATEVER STATE IS A 
VOTE FOR HIM AT LEAST THIS IS 
THE MESSAGE HE'S TRYING TO 
CONVEY TO VOTERS IN SPECIALLY 
DECIMATED ESPECIALLY IN PLACES 
LIKE WEST VIRGINIA AND THAT 
THEY CAN COUNT ON HIS SUPPORT 
BUT HE IS NOT ON THE BALLOT SO 
HE'S TRYING TO TRANSFER THAT 
ENTHUSIASM AND TRANSFER THAT TO 
THE MIDTERM ELECTION SO WE 
SHOULD EXPECT MORE OF THIS NOW 
THAT WE ARE COUNTING DOWN TO 
NOVEMBER. 
>> WE WILL SEE HOW SUCCESSFUL A 
STRATEGY THAT IS. 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT OUIJA 
JIANG, THANK YOU . AS WE 
DISCUSSED THE BIG NEWS OF THE 
DAY, TWO OF HIS FORMER ALLIES 
ú 
MICHAEL COHEN AND CAMPAIGN 
CHAIRMAN PAUL MANAFORT. 
MICHAEL COHEN PLEADED GUILTY TO 
EIGHT CRIMINAL COUNTS ONE FOR 
PAYMENTS TO TWO WOMEN WHO
