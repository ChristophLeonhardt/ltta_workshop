north Korea has performed a political 180 saying there is no reason to further pursue nuclear weapons if it gets a security guarantee the country even promises to halt nuclear tests during proposed talks with the US this latest development came after a visit to North Korea by a delegation from the south the head of the group says he was told Pyongyang says there would be no need for a nuclear program if there is no threat of invasion referring to the u.s. military presence in South Korea as a result the two Korean nations will hold their first joint political summit in decades in April and yet even with an albeit cautious prospect of peace on the horizon not everyone is happy with more on that here's Kelly Moulton the Winter Olympic Games have seen an unprecedented thaw in relations between North and South Korea and now that the games are over the two countries have not given up on their road to better relations for the first time in more than a decade South Korean envoy's are meeting with Kim jong-un you won't hear any celebrating in the US though take Donald Trump's tough talk as far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned that's his problem not mine while war hawk neo-cons talk about a military solution all the damage that would come from a war would be worth it in terms of long-term stability and national security to be fair US leaders did pause their rehearsal for all-out war during the Olympic Games but almost as soon as the closing ceremonies were over the tanks and planes were out once again and they were rehearsing for mass death New York Times reports that a classified US military exercise examined the number of US troops that would be involved in a potential conflict on the Korean Peninsula according to their estimate roughly 10,000 u.s. soldiers would be wounded in just the first few days of a new Korean War the brutality of this war will be beyond the experience of any living soldier North and South Korea may be tentatively moving forward but the reluctant United States will only sit down with conditions Trump says that a meeting can only be arranged via Beijing if the north will give up their nuclear weapons that according to Pyongyang is a ridiculous and Posterous demand we've waited so long for this to come about there's now leadership in South Korea that is recognizing that this has gone on for far too long and this leadership under president moon who's a progressive lawyer he knows what dialogue can do and has seen how it can get interrupted by one side or another wanting to engage in this ongoing type of tug-of-war in the United States has not necessarily had an interest for peace in Korea really it doesn't seem like the leadership wants to create a real atmosphere for peace that brings us back to the beginning full circle to the vitriolic war of words which has not exactly been helpful in previous years Kalib Maupin RT New York
