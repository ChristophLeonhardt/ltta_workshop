bring in someone else who some consider one of those potential 20/20 challengers but first he needs to win reelection in two weeks Democratic congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio also with us for this conversation is Washington bureau chief for USA Today Susan page good to have you Susan Congressman Ryan first of all how's your election looking two weeks in two weeks away it's going good we're working hard you know campaigning on what we've done the past 16 years and turning around cities like Youngstown Ohio like Akron Ohio a lot of the positive things trying to diversify our economy but also what we're fighting for and it's it is health care it's pensions it's making sure that young kids have an opportunity to live in our community and if they've moved away to be able to come back by making sure we have high tech jobs being developed whether it's around the energy sector or additive manufacturing sector so you know we're excited to campaign about that but we're also trying to help other candidates around the country to win a Democratic majority so what do you think is happening 15 days out why aren't the polls wider apart for the Democrats what happened to this blue wave that everyone was I guess maybe hoping for or predicting is it there well you know these races if you look you know you can't really take the national statistics you have to look at them race by race by race and a lot of these races across the board that are considered quote unquote toss-up races very very close they're within a point or two one way or the other and this is going to be an election about turnout and I think what you're seeing in these House races are gerrymandered districts where we are extremely competitive look at Danny O'Conner in Columbus Ohio he almost won a special election which is a Republican plus ten seat Conner Lamb one republican plus twenty seat in Western PA so we are doing extremely well in some of these communities in some of these congressional districts and it's all going to get out to turnout so if you're if you're worried if you're concerned if you're a Democrat you need to go start knocking on some doors we can't send tweets out or put new social media posts we got to go old-school grassroots campaigning and that's getting our voters out out the vote and out to the polls and Tim are you worried no I wouldn't I mean I'm cautiously optimistic I don't think I've never thought there was this big blue wave that was gonna come I mean I'm from Ohio I've seen the redistricting process over the last couple of decades and these are really really hard districts for us to win fortunately we got really really good candidates we've got a lot of veterans that are out there running people talking about manufacturing you know the National narrative Mika is much different than what our candidates are talking about no one in Youngstown Ohio talking about impeachment no one in Youngstown Ohio is talking about Russia they're talking about how they're gonna make ends meet they're talking about potentially losing their pension here's a great example look at senator sherrod Brown he's doing extremely well in the polls right now I think up seven eight nine ten points depending on the poll what's he talking about he's talking about jobs he's talking about pensions he's talking about health care bread-and-butter issues that most people can understand and that they're thinking about when they go to bed every night whether their kids are sick their spouses are sick all of those issues he's talking about him and he's winning and I hope that's a recipe for for Democrats across the country as to what they should be talking about Nick confessori and then Susan page Nick go ahead you know it's fascinating I'm wondering what we see here on the country is a decline in enthusiasm or lack of power from Hispanic Americans and what's that saying to me as Democrats were kind of you know kind of hoping that was in the bag right that with this president and his policies on the border and immigration that there would of course be a huge outpouring of but it's not there so what do Democrats not understand yet about this group of Americans and potential voters well I think you know we should have learned from 2016 a president Trump did as well if maybe slightly worse than Mitt Romney did among Hispanic voters so the reality of it is yes Hispanic voters leave vote on immigration guess what else they want a job they want a pension they want health care for their kids they want opportunity for their kids that's why a robust economic message not that we can't talk about an advocate and before all these other justice issues which are obviously critically important we want everybody to participate in a growing economy and have the opportunity not to be discriminated against but a robust economic message how are we gonna make your life better regardless if you're white black brown gay straight we're talking about your pocketbook every single day and as I said sherrod Brown does this and he's doing really well on a purple state like Ohio you know congressman it's no surprise that Republican that party voters come home when you get close to the election so everybody knew that there'd be some tightening of the big Democratic edge that we saw a couple weeks ago but I wonder too if you think that the Cavanaugh that Brett Kavanaugh hearings actually were kind of a break point that is really we help the Republicans as they go into these final few weeks of the campaign did that make a big difference I think it did solidify their base I mean these judicial appointments with Republicans are a huge issue I do think it woke up their base I think we saw that energy level increase in the polls it we had an already energized base on our side for for the Cavanaugh issue and a variety of other issues so I do think it helped tighten things up now there's still two weeks left and there are a lot of really important issues and I think as long as we pound those issues hard the economic issues you know the issues around health care I think what Joe said earlier about the tax cut we should be campaigning on we're gonna repeal 83% of the tax cut 83% of this tax cut went to the top one percent of the people in the country that should be repealed and we're gonna take that money and we're gonna make sure we protect Medicare that with slight adjustments we could actually expand Social Security for people who are struggling in many of these communities and then rebuild the country and use that money to rebuild the country and I think we should say we want to hold Donald Trump to the promises he made he said he was gonna raise taxes on the top one percent we're gonna give him an opportunity to do that when we get in he said he was gonna expand health care we're gonna give him an opportunity to do that when when we get in he said he was going to rebuild the country and spend one one and a half trillion dollars rebuilding the United States cleaning the country up we're gonna give him an opportunity to do that and I think if you stay focused on those issues our people will come home and we'll be able to persuade a lot of independent voters to say these these guys look responsible here's an issue do you think it doesn't get a whole lot of attention young married couple say in late 20s early 30s two kids one two one four what are you gonna do about them in terms of pre-k for their children in court in the tax code helping them up with daycare costs yeah I think that's an important issue again these need to be tailored but part of a lot larger narrative for us is we're gonna have policies that are gonna help working-class people if you're working hard you're playing by the rules you have a couple kids we're the party that will be for these kind of tax benefits to help these people and also college savings I mean go on and on from there but these are the these are the people the mom's a nurse the dad's a firefighter they're making a hundred and ten thousand one hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year everything that comes out of our mouth as Democrats should be how we're gonna help those people that's how you rebuild the blue wall that's how you rebuild Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan Wisconsin and if you want to make strides into the the southern communities you're gonna have to be talking about those economic issues congressman Tim Ryan thank you very much for being on the show this morning he's also the author of the book healing
