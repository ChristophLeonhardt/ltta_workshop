Aaron says should someone lie about who they voted for if they fear severe retaliation from their university employer or other leftists with power over them oh this is really hard why don't you any of those people have any right to ask them how they voted they don't have any right to do it but they do it they do it anyway and they'll do it kind of jokingly at the water cooler yeah ha ha ha I wouldn't recommend that you lie I don't think that you should lie and live us another life there were occasions back in the long-ago days when I would work as an actor where I would be on cetera or in a theater and I would keep my mouth shut or I would even say things that seemed that could be interpreted as a little bit lefty and you do it just so that you keep working and you get along but you feel a little icky about it you don't I don't think that leads to a good life you might want to keep quiet even if you keep quiet they'll probably find out that you're a conservative or a Trump supporter but you might want to do that I can't go out there and tell you that you should be honest Blair your views from the rooftop I did that I've done that my whole life and now in many ways it's my job to do that so I get to do it but that turn turned off other opportunities other social opportunities other professional opportunities obviously in Hollywood it turns off a lot of professional opportunities and there's a cost to that I don't regret the cost I've had a great time I sleep very well at night I get to do whatever I want it's a blast and I feel good and I feel that I get to maintain the integrity of my convictions but if you work for the widget company and you know your political views don't align with the president of the widget company and it's going to create a bad situation for you you might want to keep quiet you might be doing greater good by keeping that job and not hampering your career I wouldn't lie but you might have to play it safe that's not a again that's not a clear-cut easy answer but you know life isn't clear-cut or easy shallows are clear
