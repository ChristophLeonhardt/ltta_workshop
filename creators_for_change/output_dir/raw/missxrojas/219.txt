00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
hey guys today I'm going to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,019
about poetry oh you are leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,060
wait well for those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you who are left</font>

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,680
I don't read poetry as much they used to

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,480
I'd say the height of my poetry reading

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,910
poetry consumption was in a levels the

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,740
a-level years maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I was being</font>

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,690
exposed to so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it was my exams</font>

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,550
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

10
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,840
that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,640
dip in and out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> books as well anyway</font>

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">so now my poetry slam that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,580
place in April first got me thinking a

14
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,410
lot about contemporary poets really made

15
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,310
me dig and look for them especially

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,930
because I normally go back to my old

17
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,369
staple favorites by Sylvia Plath

18
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,219
Christina Rossetti<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a rich ordered let</font>

19
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,170
Tennyson like all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> although</font>

20
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,910
classics as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it were one of the</font>

21
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,770
organizers of the panjab poetry slam

22
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,660
sent me<font color="#CCCCCC"> dean at his debut collection</font>

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,879
which is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> living in london living</font>

24
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,559
as a gay man living as a black man

25
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,870
living with anger living for brotherhood

26
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,090
and really just living in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,170
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by this collection</font>

28
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,180
which is only like 90 pages or so seven

29
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,680
pounds ninety-nine and it's published by

30
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,239
Westbourne press<font color="#E5E5E5"> running through some of</font>

31
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,500
the poems and the lines that really

32
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,180
stood out for me the line and young

33
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,559
black and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gay that you could befriend</font>

34
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,100
sinners and still not sin came as a min

35
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,470
really Karen came as a moment of strange

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,510
relief and reflection within the poem

37
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,220
often my<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite poems are those that</font>

38
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
really play with language and this is

39
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,010
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those collectors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where there</font>

40
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,140
certainly is a lot of wordplay lot of

41
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,420
punning and rhyming and double meaning

42
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,189
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the repeated idea that he is</font>

43
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,380
kind of denied access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some language</font>

44
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,420
especially his mother's language which

45
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,430
is Greek I believe the provocative line

46
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,020
from paper cuts you can't prove a thing

47
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,759
with a page left blank and a fantastic

48
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">firm about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the London riots called smash</font>

49
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,570
and grab and the powers that came into

50
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether that was the riot is taking</font>

51
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,140
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> this session of mourning and</font>

52
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">protest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whether it address the</font>

53
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,380
greater problem that led these writers

54
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,180
still want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first place</font>

55
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,490
it repeats the image of brushing things

56
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,409
under the rug and test these powerful

57
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,750
lines as a carpet of crime covers this

58
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,670
country what's truly criminal is the

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,290
neglect with which we have raised his

60
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,700
children some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the poems are quite</font>

61
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,799
short or dislike or stream of

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,810
consciousness like others take on a

63
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,969
broader narrative format like the poem

64
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,649
key to the city and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in those poems</font>

65
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:00,689
really find<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself in part of London</font>

66
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,149
itself or in part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cyprus or just</font>

67
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,490
somewhere around so I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

68

inspired some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you to pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a poetry</font>
