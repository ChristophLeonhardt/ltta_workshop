IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HELD.
>> Neil: BLAKE, THANK YOU, GREAT
JOB.
MANY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND
OUT WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT
MEETING BETWEEN THE SOUTH AND
NORTH KOREAN LEADERS.
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING
ALONG FAMOUSLY.
WHAT TO READ INTO THAT AND WHAT
IT SETS THE STAGE FOR WHEN THE
NORTH KOREAN LEADER MEETS HIS
AMERICAN COUNTERPART, DONALD
TRUMP.
LET'S GET THE RODE FROM FORMER
CIA INTELLIGENCE OFFICER AND
FOREIGN POLICY.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW
THE MEETING WENT AND WHAT WE CAN
GLEAN FROM THAT.
IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE GETTING
ALONG JUST FINE.
>> WELL, SPECTACULAR AND
HISTORIC.
I CAN'T THINK OF ENOUGH
ADJECTIVES TO DESCRIBE WHAT HAS
HAPPENED.
BUT IT WAS ABOVE ALL, IT WAS
SUBSTANTIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE.
THEY TALKED NOT ONLY ABOUT
DEKNEW CLEEIZING --
DENUCLEARIZING THE PENINSULA,
BUT BROADER DISARMAMENT, ENDING
THE WAR BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.
AND ABOUT NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION.
SOMETHING I'VE HEARD NO ONE TALK
ABOUT THIS MORNING.
BRINGING THE FAMILIES TOGETHER.
TRYING TO HEAL THE NATION.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS N ADDITION
TO THE FACT IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT A NORTH CROW AN LEADER SET
FOOT ON SOUTH CROW AN SOIL --
NORTH KOREAN LEADER SET FOOT ON
SOUTH KOREAN SOIL.
IT'S HALF OF WHAT THEY TALKED
ABOUT IN THE JOINT DECLARATION,
IF HALF OF IT OCCURS THE WORLD
HAS CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
>> Neil: PETER THERE'S SO MUCH
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
BEHIND THE SCENES.
THEIR GOALS WERE STATED IN
MUTUAL STATEMENTS THAT CAME OUT
SHORTLY THEREAFTER WHERE THEY
SAID AN END TO WAR AND COMPLETE
DENUCLEARIZATION.
THAT PUTS THE ONUS ON THE SOUTH
CROW A THAN AS WELL, WORKING ON
THE UNITED STATES TOWNS DO THE
SAME.
HOW WILL THAT BE RECEIVED?
>> WELL, THE DEVIL IS IN THE
DETAILS, NEIL.
RIGHT NOW, I ASSUME THE WHITE
HOUSE HAS BEEN BRIEFED BY THE
BLUE HOUSE IN SEOUL ABOUT THESE
MEETINGS.
THEY KNOW MORE THAN WE DO.
WE'LL PROBABLY KNOW MORE IN THE
COMING DAYS.
FOR US IT'S LIGHT IN DETAILS.
TAKING ALL OF THE PROMISES ON
PAPER AND PUTTING THEM IN ACTION
ON THE GROUND THAT,'S A
CHALLENGE, HEAVY LIFTING TO BE
DONE THERE.
THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN
SEPARATED BY AN ARMIES ADVERTISE
FOR -- ARMIES ADVERTISE FOR 75
YEARS.
IT'S AN ASPIRATION, I SUPPORT.
THAT AND THE DENUCLEARIZATION
ISSUE, WHAT DOES NORTH KOREA
MEAN BY THAT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF US WORKING ON
NORTH KOREA FOR MANY YEARS, HAVE
BEEN THROUGH THE FAILED
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST THAT ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT NORTH KOREA
ISN'T REALLY WILLING TO
COMPLETELY DENUCLEARIZE.
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION
THAN WE DO.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW MORE
AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE
DONE.
ALTHOUGH, SO COLOR ME CAUTIOUSLY
OPTIMISTIC BUT DEEPLY SKEPTICAL
OF INTENTIONS.
>> Neil: WE HAVE SEEN PROGRESS
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVE NOT
SEEN IN DECADES, TO YOUR POINT,
THE CONCERN SEEMS TO BE WHAT
WOULD MAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP GET
AWAY FROM THE TABLE, STAND UP
AND WALK AWAY.
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT NOT MAKING
MUCH PROGRESS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE?
>> FIRST OF ALL LET ME ALSO ADD
THAT THE UPS UNITED STATES IS
MENTIONED IN THE JOINT STATEMENT
AS BEING A CENTRAL PLAYER IN ANY
NEGOTIATIONS GOING FORWARD
BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH.
AND CHINA WAS MENTIONED ONLY
AFTER THAT AS A POTENTIAL FOURTH
PARTY.
AND I THINK THAT MEANS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL STICK TO
HIS WORD, BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN
VERY CREDIBLE.
FOR HIM, IT MEANS
DENUCLEARIZATION IN THE WAY WE
UNDERSTAND IT, NO NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE U.S.
PRESIDENT AND THE STRONG
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, HE'S
RECENTLY ASSEMBLED, WITH
MR. POMPEO AND MR. BOLTEN IN
ADDITION TO SECRETARY MATTIS
WILL ALLOW ANY OTHER DEFINITION
OF DENUCLEARIZATION THAN WHAT IT
ACTUALLY MEANS TO THE BROADER
WORLD.
BUT ALSO, WE WILL HELP
FACILITATE THE PEACE PROCESS.
AND THIS IS IN A WAY FULFILLING
THE AMERICA FIRST DOCTRINE IN
THE SENSE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS CALLED FOR SELF
DETERMINATION, REGIONAL
SOLUTIONS TO REGIONAL PROBLEMS.
HE'S HELPED AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
FACILITATE A DISCUSSION BETWEEN
NORTH AND SOUTH KREE OH.
THAT'S WHAT -- KOREA.
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED ALL ALONG.
>> Neil: PETER, EVERY AGREEMENT
YOU COME TO, YOU HAVE TO VERIFY
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.
WE KNOW FROM PRIOR UNITED
NATIONS INSPECTION TEAMS IN
PLACES LIKE IRAQ, LIBYA,
ELSEWHERE, THAT CAN BE BROKEN.
>> YEAH, I'M SURE THAT THE WHITE
HOUSE TEAM WILL INSIST UPON
THAT.
THAT WE HAVE INTRUSIVE
INSPECTIONS, NO NOTICE
INSPECTIONS.
BUT THIS COULD BE A CHALLENGE
WITH NORTH KOREA.
THIS WEEK, WE HAVE MADE
PROGRESS, LIKE I SAID, THERE'S
REASON TO BE AUSHSLY APARTMENT
MYSTIC BUT A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
AND OUR HISTORY WITH NORTH KOREA
SHOWS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT
CHALLENGES.
LET'S TEST THEIR DIPLOMATIC
