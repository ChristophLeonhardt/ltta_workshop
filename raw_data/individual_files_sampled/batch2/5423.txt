our hearts and prayers are going to the family of Senator John McCain gonna be a lot of activity over the next number of days and we very much appreciate everything that Senator McCain has done for our countries those are the very first public words spoken by President Trump about Senator John McCain since he passed away Saturday earlier today this was the president's response when asked about McCain to belief John McCain was a hero sir nothing at all about John McCain the American Legion and other veterans groups and lawmakers criticized the White House for raising the flag over the White House to full staff less than 48 hours after the Senators death after a morning of public pushback the flag was lowered to half-staff again and president Trump issued a statement that read in part quote despite our differences on policy and politics I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country and in his honor have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment tonight a Washington Post report goes behind the scenes as the controversy escalated quote several administration officials said Trump was frustrated with the TV coverage and felt besieged that nothing he said about McCain would be enough Trump also suggested to advisors that many of those speaking out on television were merely looking for reasons to attack him and that some of the same people now praising McCain previously did not like the senator chunk told advisors over the weekend that lavishing praise on McCain would not be genuine because he did not feel that way quote everyone knows we don't like each other the president according to one White House official who spoke with him Trump wrote much of Monday statement White House official said and wanted to express that he disagreed with McCain on policy and politics Senator McCain wrote a statement before he died meant to be both a farewell to the nation he loved and a warning Rick Davis's longtime aide and friend and former campaign manager read it at a press conference today here's some of that we weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe we weaken it when we hide behind walls rather than tear them down when we doubt the power of our ideals rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been back with us to talk about all of this is Robert Costa and joining the conversation Ashley Parker Pulitzer Prize winning White House reporter for The Washington Post and Jill Colvin White House reporter for The Associated Press Jill let me start with you you were in many of those pool sprays today and you saw the president arms crossed mumbling thank you thank you barely making eye contact with Jonathan Karl or anybody else in the pool asking about John McCain what was it that pushed him over the top was it this as the Washington Post reports the crush of cable news coverage or did was it the the revolt sort of on his own White House staff that finally got him to make this turn well it seemed to be a combination of those factors the president was just peppered with questions for different opportunities this afternoon where the president was asked about John McCain do you have nothing else to say about him do you believe he is a hero why is that the only statement that you have to the nation referring to that tweet that he put out his only public response up until this afternoon you could feel the pressure mounting you could sort of see in the president that he he understood and he felt that the tension in the room as we were all bombarding him with those questions she's also been reporting that there were a number of staff members from John Kelly the chief of staff to Sarah Huckabee Sanders the communications were the press secretary of who are urging him telling him that this is not a good look for you the president was also seeing as he turned on cable news channels endless criticism you had that very powerful image it was an aerial shot of the White House that flag on top of the White House residence with a flag up at full staff this morning and then you had the Washington Monument in the background you're looking at it right now with all of those flags at half-staff you had you know veterans groups that the president has claimed that he is such a champion of coming out and criticizing him and at the end he decided to do exactly what his aides had been urging him to do previously and put out that statement Oishi parker color me deeply skeptical that anyone on the White House staff was offended on behalf of an American Hero because this was the same White House staff Sarah Huckabee Sanders in particular who took to the podium in the briefing room and defended Kelly Sadler when she said while John McCain will be dead soon so I have a hard time believing that it was anything more than concern about Donald Trump's political standing that brought about the pressure on him am I getting that wrong your skepticism is absolutely fair I will say one of the reasons for instance we know as the Post reported that you know president Trump initially nixed putting out a statement calling Senator McCain a hero and praising his life and his military service is because there were a number of people in that White House who were really sickened by the president's initial behavior that said a lot of their dismay and disagreement sort of took place in private or in anonymous quotes to reporters and there is a difference in this White House between people often saying they don't like the behavior there personally disgusted and then sort of taking the next step that more crucial step and taking an actual public stand and we did not see that we did see them ultimately through that combination of cable news coverage in the president getting peppered with questions and private pressure being applied get the president to a public place but again no one resigned and no one in that White has stepped forward to say that they disagreed with the way this was handled initially from Acosta what is the sort of ripple if Donald Trump again threw a boulder in the middle of a peaceful pond what is the ripple look like in the GOP when John McCain in death was able to shame Donald Trump in life many Republicans were appalled by what they heard about the White House keeping that flag up not at half man-half half-staff and you see pressure from throughout the party calling into the White House saying there has to be a Republican Party in lockstep here this is a sitting Republican senator a veteran Republican senator a military veteran and a war hero there's going to be proceedings at the Capitol he's going to lie there this week the funeral here in Washington buried at the Naval Academy in Annapolis all these factors have led the Republican Party mostly privately though we should point that out mostly privately to reach out to this white doesn't say change your mind and this is more than just a personal battle actually I spoke to a presidential ally and and friend and an outside advisor this morning and I said what's wrong with him do you know john mccain is on his way to heaven had had you know left everything on the field if you will have nothing unsaid this is hurting Donald Trump why can't Donald Trump you know be big for five minutes just to save himself did you get any insight in your reporting with with White House officials as to why this sort of insistence on always biting his nose to spite his face part of it again was the president sort of saying as he did and we reported over the weekend that he people know that he and Senator McCain did not get along did not like each other and a small bit of that was sort of that authenticity people seem to like about him and staying true to himself and staying true to his feud but but the real reason of the core reason is that President Trump especially he cannot stand not being the center of attention the the person who all the adulation is focused on and again even in this behavior which was very politically bad for this White House bad for this president president Trump managed to do what he does best and what he enjoys most which is to make it all about himself today was a day about mourning the late senator from Arizona and and while that did happen at its core was president Trump and the controversies of his own making and that is where he feels most comfortable Jill Colvin there are six days ahead of us of past presidents Democratic presidents Republican presidents all coming together to honor the life and the legacy of John McCain any predictions about how Donald Trump will weather what will undoubtedly be a very difficult six days for him I think Ashley hit it on the head there this is a president who likes to be the center of attention you know he was hosting the president of Kenya today and he congratulated the president for having arrived on such a fabulous day because it was the day that the president was announcing the sort of small-scale confusing trade deal trade agreement with Mexico it was a day when he was touting that the stock market was hitting a new high and so this was a really fabulous time to be visiting the White House meanwhile you have the rest of the nation in mourning I think what you're likely to see is a series of split shots on your television screen of people across the country in Arizona in the United Stated John McCain there will be military processions that the President signed off on and meanwhile you'll have whatever the president is doing whatever he's deciding to tweet about whatever is angering him at the moment on the other side of the screen Robert Costa there was sort of a half-baked attempt to change the subject NAFTA and trade a good issue for this president with his base but it was a poorly executed event at best with you know it reminded me of the Verizon commercial you know can you hear me now can you hear me now but but what was behind this and why not get some policy behind something that had the potential to actually be helpful for this president you've seen this tension within the administration for months the President himself has inclined to these bilateral trade agreements against the multilateral agreements that have often been the staple of US trade policy and he has had strained attempts to try to put these together with Mexico other company other countries like Japan and the UK have been having talks and and more informal talks about trying to sketch out their own bilateral agreements but the president has a lot on his plate politically with a Muller investigation trade is something he keeps coming back to because it's a core run for him and going back to the campaign his whole career he's always been pretty much consistent on trade but cutting these bilateral deals is complicated and candidate is watching and there's there's not a lot of appetite in in this whole region to get out of NAFTA even if the president is offering a few things to Mexico hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or
