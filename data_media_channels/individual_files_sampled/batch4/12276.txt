but we wouldn't want Christmas to come without making a visit to our favorite website everyday feminism because everyday feminism is where women go at Christmas to learn how to perform useful womanly activities like baking those sensational star shaped shortbread cookies and complaining endlessly about every little thing until they make themselves and everyone around them miserable except I was kidding about the cookies today on everyday feminism there's a post called 5/5 gaslighting phrases Donald Trump used that remind me a lot of my abusive ex-boyfriend by Susanna Weiss I'm not making this up now gaslighting is an expression that comes from an old stage play in which an evil husband tries to make his wife think she's going crazy by among other things turning the gas lights up and down and then pretending he doesn't see the change to gas light someone means to tell them that they're not seeing what they obviously see you can try it yourself by telling a friend there are no Muslims blowing things up and killing people anyone who sees that must be Islamophobic just watch it'll drive them nuts anyway back to everyday feminism one phrase Donald Trump views that reminded Susanna Weiss of how her abusive ex-boyfriend used to gas lighter is I never said I'm a perfect person this phrase reminded Susanna Weiss of how her abusive ex-boyfriend used to borrow money from her and not pay her back when she would complain he would say I never said I was a perfect person and then she would forgive him and loan him more money leading us to question Susanna Weiss's intelligence now she's crying and moaning about all the money she loaned him but that's ridiculous after all the man never said he was a perfect person another gaslighting phrase Trump views that reminded Susanna Weiss of her abusive ex-boyfriend was this is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues this reminded Susanna Weiss of how she would tried to discuss things like gay marriage with her abusive ex-boyfriend and he would say why discuss gay marriage when there are some places where gay people are being killed really come to think of it that's a good point so maybe on that one Susanna why should have tried to focus on them more important issues Trump also accused Hillary Clinton of playing the woman's car this reminded Susanna Weiss of that time she was watching him movie with her abusive ex-boyfriend and a sexy nude scene came on and Susanna Weiss told her abusive ex-boyfriend that it was sexist because it was always the women in movies who were nude and he said she was just playing the woman card and she got all whiny about it because obviously she didn't realize he was just trying to get her to pipe down so he could enjoy the hot naked babes so as we can see there are many ways Donald Trump reminds Susanna Weiss of her abusive ex-boyfriend there are also many ways Suzanna Weiss reminds me of a really annoying girl I used to go out with who's also named Suzanna Weiss huh trigger warning Clavin show Merry Christmas everyday feminism it's like it's the site that gives all year with the least we can do all right who is this out there with the guy what is this

weekend day yesterday throughout your a lot of violence going on obviously we that horrific assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey which was caught on video because the ambassador was making a speech in a an art gallery and the guy who killed him was a security guy was a police guy and was standing right next to him just blew him away and started shouting Allahu Akbar and about Syria you know we're dying in Syria you're killing us in Syria will kill you here I have to say that Vladimir Putin handled this really well I'm gonna become a trump guy I like Putin but he did they said that this is obviously they're trying to cause a rift between Turkey and Russia and he's not gonna let it happen and that's a good thing that is a good thing you do not want people who you know people have gone to war over less than this and you don't want that happening you know but it was it was just a shocking moment I have to say even even at this point we're all getting in order to it but the one I want to talk about is the one in Berlin this is you know they have these they call them crisps Kindle marked it means you know it's a Christmas market Christmas children market I think they're now 12 dead guy drove his truck in like the like the one in Nice I drove his truck in just wiped people out with it they arrested a Pakistani immigrant at this point but they're not sure I'm not sure if it's the right guy who one of the police spokesman said they might not have the right guy and one of or or somebody else may still be on the loose with a gun so it's a scary situation these things these Christmas markets I was at the one in Munich which has been there since like the 13th 14th century and it really the first of all they're beautiful I like I write about this in the great good thing they're like stepping into a Christmas card do you get there and it's snowing beautiful Christmas tree there's children singing markets all over the place where they're selling you know very beautiful old-fashioned toys and and things like this and so but this is an old old Christmas tradition so the symbolism here is really really intense these are this these people people feel like they have been invaded Angela Merkel has let in hundreds of thousands of these refugees and people feel like they're under invasion and even before this crisis that was brought on by the ba-bling of the ball of our leaders including Barack Obama that lets Syria devolve into the Civil War and all these refugees coming in but even before this there was a sense in Europe that they were being invaded by an alien population let's listen to a British tourist Emma Rushton who was in the market when this happened this is an interview she gave to Sky News I'm running on adrenaline at the moment so everything's coming out quite fast so we arrived that many times they've never been to Berlin before first a holiday and we decided to wander down to the Christmas market and partake in some of the malt wine and what why else was on offer and we sat and we were drinking and very luckily I broke my leg a few years ago and have to sit down for a lot longer than I was normally my friend said let's go and I said well give me two minutes and then we heard a really loud bang and saw some of the Christmas lights to our left starting to be pulled down and then we saw the articulated vehicle going through people and through the stall and just pulling everything down and then everything went dark so it was very difficult to be there yeah so you know the interior minister of Germany came out and said we're at war we're at war and the thing about that war though is that lady is in the war and that's not the way thing wars usually go I mean wars are usually fought on battlefields or in the past and fought in battlefields and yes civilians get caught up in it but this is a war there's taking place against civilians against ladies like that here she goes on to talk about how she how she got out yeah there's lots of there's lots of screaming there were lots of people yelling so the stall that we felt for emerald wine from was completely crushed and there were people tearing off the wooden panels to get the people out luckily everyone in there was pulled out but as we walked we just wanted to get back to the hotel as quickly as possible and we just didn't want to stay because we didn't know if something else was going to happen or or whether we were we just didn't know we just didn't know and we saw people we just had to kind of steal our eyes and just walk through and I wanted to stop and help but we just wanted to make sure that we were safe firstly yeah well you know you hear that it's it's it's very it's very moving because of course these are people out there you know celebrating Christmas as I said I've been to these markets the one in Munich and it really is a beautiful beautiful uplifting experience and to have these guys invading it is really you know a symbol of something that has gone terribly wrong see this is the thing when these attacks take place it's a very emotional moment and you often hear the left guys you know nutcase is like Paul Krugman of the New York Times you know it will say oh well I hope it's a you know it's probably a right-wing white male or something like you know I hope that you know as if that would change the situation we're in if a right-wing white male were to go on a rampage heaven forfend and kills somebody that would mean that there was a crazy right-wing white male what this means is it is reminding us of a steady state of a problem that we're in over the overall arching problem we are watching the we're not only watching a bad idea in the sense that Islamism is a bad idea we were watching the true collapse of the elites great idea they're great what they thought was their great idea has failed and it is failed everywhere and this is why the British are leaving the EU this is why there's brexit this is where there's Donald Trump this is why the Italian government fell this is why angle a Merkel who may be in big trouble when she is up for re-election next year you know this is why the people are revolting the idea has failed and the idea that has fed that has failed is that experts should rule us that the elites should rule us that they'll elites know best this idea has been in the wind at least at least since the Enlightenment has really been around since Plato I think this idea that there is a right way to be you can reason your way to the right way wise men are those people who can reason well there for wise men should tell you what to do and you know they argue well you're not you're not unfree because no free man who was wise do anything other than what we're telling you to do and this is why they hate religion because religion sort of says no it's you inside you each one of you where the truth resides the truth does not reside in a panel of experts it is not to be reached entirely by reason it has to be reached to some degree by revelation and to some degree by feeling your way there is no science of morality and there is no way that the experts can do it and this is you know this is the idea behind communism that is the idea behind every totalitarian government and it is collapsing they let a you know listen this is not to me to attack Islam in general there are 1.6 billion Islamic people in the world I haven't there's no doubt in my mind that some of them use Islam to connect with the true God I'm sure that that is true the problem is that there is something in Islam and always has been that is antithetical to the West the West was built the West as we know it was built war with Islam Islam was trying to wipe out Europe Europe won and established itself an islam faded into primitivism essentially and in every country where Islam is the majority religion not perhaps in every single country but in most countries there is oppression there is inequality there is a mistreatment of women that is just you know I mean I love to make fun of feminism but I'm deeply committed to the rights of women which I consider to be too antithetical things to things that are opposed to one another but but there is a problem with letting people in in these numbers who might hold the philosophy that is completely opposed to everything we love and you can't sit in a room with a bunch of experts and say yes but this makes us feel so you see we understand the people may be prejudiced the people may be presents what we understand that you know this is the good this is the great global thing that we have to go forward you know Brett Stevens wrote a column today about something entirely different that have an insight in it that was so brilliant you know sometimes people say things that put into words things you're already thinking and you think oh that's really great but every now and again somebody comes up with an idea that just has not occurred to you that is so right that the minute you read it it's like bingo and Brett Stevens is interesting because I had real problems with him during the election he went off on Ted Cruz I felt without any evidence without supplying at least any evidence that his attacks on Cruz were justified I thought he was wrong I thought he was it I didn't necessarily think he was wrong in his attacks on Donald Trump but I thought he was being blind to what was happening he wasn't listening to the people and what their discontents were and he is and he isn't elite you know he's a very elitist kind of guy and he doesn't understand why people get upset about the immigration however he's also a brilliant capacious mind with a real moral compass and so you don't reject people because they're wrong because everybody's wrong sometimes and sometimes I think thought Brett Stevens wrong but at least he's thinking about why he was wrong and he wrote a piece today and I'm sure it went to press way before the terrorist attacks about regulations and I you know this is something I hump about all the time too many regulations and he talks about the fact that the World Bank published a survey on how friendly governments are to business and the United States under Obama has fallen in that survey it when he when Obama took office the US was third in the overall index of how easy it was to do business here and now it is I think it's 8th it's in 8th place since Obama can 8th and everything has become harder it's become harder to start a business it's become harder to enforce a contract all these things have become harder because of regulations and what and this is part of what's driving people crazy in the Midwest and part of the manufacturing class and here's Stevens insight that is just brilliant you know I think I'm gonna cut off here and get to that insight in just a minute we have to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire you can hear the rest and you can subscribe and you can watch the whole thing on the site you never have to go on Facebook or YouTube you can just watch it on the site if you subscribe and then you can be in the mailbag and ask your questions for
