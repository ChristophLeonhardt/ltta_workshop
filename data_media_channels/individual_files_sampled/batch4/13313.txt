today we confront two questions so terrifying that no one else in the entire country has dared to ask it what if everything is fine that's right everyone and his mother and even your mother has seen the internet meme in which a dog sits drinking coffee in a burning building and then says this is fine but as shocking as it may be to contemplate is it at least possible that an internet meme is not a reflection of actual reality is it possible that the truth is exactly the opposite of the meme maybe in real life the dog is sitting drinking coffee in a perfectly pleasant environment and then suddenly starts shouting fire when there is no fire there's just coffee and a dog ever since Donald Trump fired James Comey reporters and commentators on both the left and the right have been using words like crisis disaster and debacle but what if when the President of the United States decides to fire someone who serves at his pleasure it's not a crisis it's just Tuesday journalists keep telling us that it's a big story but ask yourself is it a big story in your life does it raise your taxes or weaken your system of government does it even undermine an ongoing FBI investigation is it possible this is just a big story in the gossip mill of Washington DC but for the rest of us everything is fine in fact maybe the entire election of Donald Trump is like this Trump's an offbeat character with a tendency to tweet himself in the foot from time to time but he doesn't seem to be violating any of the basic principles of American governance checks and balances are still working Democrats are still dishonest Republicans are still incompetent with the exception of all the hysteria in the media everything's pretty much the same as it's always been is it possible that even after the election of Donald Trump everything is basically fine but you might say what if I'm a leftist and I'm terrified about the make-believe climate crisis or Trump's make-believe fascism or all them make-believe oppression confronting Americans with no real problems take a look around you lefties are the people who are telling you to panic panic to themselves Al Gore is still making long-term investments Keith Olbermann and Charles blow aren't in hiding and all those Hollywood celebrities who promised they were going to flee to Canada they're all still here sure there are lots of predictions of coming disaster but a prediction of disaster is not a disaster it's not even an event it's just a guy saying stuff about the future who doesn't know any more about the future than you do predictions of disaster make the predictors seem important and they're a good way to make you panic so you'll give the predictors prestige power and money but look around you look at yourself how's life going are you a dog drinking coffee shouting fire stop shouting fire and ask yourself what if everything is actually fine trigger I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right

ago in a story I'm not going to tell I spent the night with a congenital liar somebody who just lied and lied and lied and I found this very strange thing that by the end of the evening it was easier for her to fool me than it was at the beginning of the evening because I just found it almost impossible to believe that someone could be lying about every single thing but everything she said oh I and by the end of the evening he just got worn out and that's the way I feel about the media now with Donald Trump I mean everything they say they said remember Co memes fire they said rod Rosenstein the deputy AG was gonna resign he's threatened to resign because Trump had put the firing on him Rosa Singh says not true the Russian investigation is gonna be compromised that's why try Andrew McCabe the guy who's the acting head of the FBI says not happening the FBI is low morale they're starting a war with Donald Trump they you know they predicted this month they said months ago the FBI had low morale because of of Comey so now they're reporting that the country's in a crisis everything is a crisis the you know Donald Trump is going to fire this one and fine he's gonna clean house he's gonna do this he's threatening he's threatening James Comey that was the one that really got to me because that I'll get back to that in a minute cuz that just is totally untrue but you know it's like why you start to believe them you start to think well they've been wrong about everything but they wouldn't be lying about this you know it's like wouldn't they wouldn't be lying about the whole thing the whole thing can't be a lot you know Michael Crichton gave a great speech once Molli hammy we talked about it in her broadside that we were talking about last week when Molly was here Michael Crichton gave this wonderful speech about how much meaningless speculation and lack of fact there isn't the media was a long time ago I guess yeah but it's a it's a brilliant speech but at one point he talks about the fact that every now and again you come upon a newspaper piece about something you know about so for instance I've been in publishing and all my life and I'll start to read a thing about publishing you realize they don't know anything about the anything you know about they don't know about when they write about Hollywood I've worked in Hollywood I think no that's not really the way it works you know the other day the LA Weekly had a story about you know this theoretically secret band of Republicans Tory was totally untrue that totally their sources were wrong the guy was just you know throwing shade at them no truth in it whatsoever then what Crichton noticed is you turn the page and you start to read a story about Indonesia and you think oh well this must be true because you don't know anything about Indonesia it's something you know about you realize their line so all weekend long the media and the Democrats but I repeat myself are working to spread this sense of crisis of the the administration is falling apart and all this stuff and of course well we've already had the whole we've been you know we're we're in touch with we're in league with Russia Trump's a Russian spy and all this remember remember James Comey serves at Donald Trump's pleasure he can fire him for picking his toes in Poughkeepsie he can fire a chewing gum he can fire him for looking at him cross lighting environment any reason he want there's nothing's going on there's like it's just a firing Clinton fired one did Obama I don't can't remember a fillip on fire than that FBI got but it's just it just is what it is you know it's a story in the sense like you go like wow that's an interesting story but it doesn't doesn't change anything except it gets this kind of grandstanding guy out of the FBI so former defense secretary Robert Gates was on with John Dickerson and he was talking about the Russians meddling with elections and this is what he said was Putin's objective here's gates look I think this is a guy who saw the u.s. basically come out against him in his re-election campaign in 2012 he saw the u.s. being behind all of the color revolutions in Eastern Europe and in Georgia and Ukraine and so on so his view is the West has been interfering in in his politics for years and I think that he has decided in a very strategic way to turn the tables and do everything in his power to as we describe Russian elections as illegitimate to try and communicate to the best of the world that Western elections are illegitimate and it's not just us we know that now it's Germany its France it's a number of other countries and it's a very broad and not very well disguised effort to to create questions about the legitimacy of these Western elections and I think I mean this is very cagey being so he's trying to create Putin is trying to create your questions about the legitimacy so were the Democrats you know he's trying to create chaos and dissent so are the Democrats so is the media I mean just here's here's Chuck Schumer talking about Jeff Sessions roll it the Attorney General's role in the firing of James Comey but you're gonna cross okay maybe that wasn't it was close enough here he is is it for real I have asked the inspector general and the request I've made is not only to look into any interference to thwart the investigation but whether attorney general sessions should have participated in the firing of Comey and should participate in FBI director you know attorney general sessions has a much higher obligation he didn't tell the truth about meeting with the Russians so he recused himself now he seems to be violating that recusal that would seem on its face to be part of this and look I called for him to step down when he didn't tell the truth about the Russians because it's the highest law enforcement officer in the land if the actions of the last week make all the more reason that he should not be attorney general this is clownish stupidity and spreading of panic and spread you know everything with Schumer is like amped up to this hot to shrill everything stirred the dial is always on shrill what the hell does he mean Jeff Sessions shouldn't have a say in the firing of James Comey you know he says oh well he recused himself from a Russian investigation Comey wasn't doing the Russian and Russian investigation he's running the entire bureau processions has got to have a say in firing the bureau is part of the Justice Department that sessions runs it's nonsense the entire thing is nonsense that Lawrence tribe the Harvard lefty law guy is saying well this might be obstruction of justice there has to be a crime for there to be obstruction of justice the FBI investigation into the Russian collusion is not an investigation into a crime it's an intelligence investigation there's no crime it's not it's not a federal crime for Putin to mess around with us you know you can do if that's what he does you know it's like there's no there is no crime alleged so there's no special prosecutor you don't need a special prosecutor so of course who's the hero who all eyes in such a crisis because we all see what a horrible crisis the press Putin the press and the Democrats are trying to tell us who's really in collusion here who is included so Putin the press and the Democrats were all trying to tell us of crisis but who's the hero who's going to save the day well Fareed Zakaria who else has the answer for us Donald from in much of his rhetoric and many of his actions poses a danger to American democracy there is just one real check on the president impeachment and it is political not legal since Trump's own party controls both chambers of Congress there has been little resistance to him there so far it appears that the Republican Party is losing any resemblance to a traditional Western political party instead simply turning into something more commonly found in the developing world a platform to support the ego appetites and interests of one man and his family there are only two forces left that can place some constraints on Donald Trump the courts and the media and he has relentlessly attacked both every time a court has ruled against one of his executive orders the president has ridiculed the decision or demeaned the judges involved that leaves the media Trump has gone at them at us like no president before smearing news organizations attacking individual journalists and threatening to strip legal protections guaranteed to a free press what a shock the media is the hero the media its Fareed Zakaria is the hero of Sekar it's like Charlie David Copperfield that might to be the hero of my own life for Reed's Akari as the hero of his own life you know what they needed CNN they need to check their seats that the audience can operate you know be just it was just you know Donald Trump poses a danger to democracy he went far that time everywhere everybody the entire I would play Keith Olbermann except the entire media has turned into Keith Olbermann I would have to New York Times it which used to be a newspaper GOP senators pulling away from Trump have a lot less fear of him I could see Oh beautiful Republican senators in public and senators was lucky they're just not walking in yes there's somebody to take them out of a corner they need an aide whenever they walk in the corner to tell them how to get out of it Senate Republicans increasingly unnerved by president Trump's volatility and unpopularity are starting to show signs of breaking away from him as they try to forge a more traditional Republican agenda so he says several Republicans have openly questioned mr. Trump's decision to fire the FBI director James Comey and even law makers who supported the move have complained privately that was poorly timed and disruptive to their work many were dismayed when mr. Trump seems to threaten mr. Comey this thing about threatened because this was on The Daily wire too and I really object to this but what Trump said was James Comey there's a tweet James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press that's not a threat I don't see I don't see where that's a threat what he was saying was first of all I I thought it was a joke I thought he what he was saying was you know I know the truth and he's better not lie about it but I mean come on you know we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which means you're gonna miss Michael Knowles and how he trolled Cuba unless you come over to the Daily wire.com if you subscribe you can just watch the whole thing we don't you don't have to get bounced around like this and you can be part of the mailbag which is coming on Wednesday you
