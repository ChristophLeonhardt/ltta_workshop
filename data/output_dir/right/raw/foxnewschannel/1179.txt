1
00:00:00,272 --> 00:00:01,139
ROUNDS SAYING THE PRESIDENT

2
00:00:01,139 --> 00:00:02,774
COULD PARDON HIMSELF BUT HE

3
00:00:02,774 --> 00:00:03,141
WOULDN'T.

4
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,543
ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE

5
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:05,177
HOUSE WITH THE STORY.

6
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:06,111
HI, ED.

7
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:07,579
>> IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

8
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:08,613
PRESIDENT TRUMP RAISING THE

9
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:11,817
STAKES TONIGHT BECLAIRING THE

10
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:13,218
PERSON COUNSEL PROBE IN HIS

11
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:15,220
WORDS -- BY DECLARING THAT THE

12
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,491
SPECIAL COUNSEL'S PROBE IS

13
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:20,425
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND HE WOULD

14
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:21,993
PARDON HIMSELF IF HE WANTS

15
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:22,727
THERE.

16
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,496
MAY BE CLASHES AHEAD WITH

17
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,764
MUELLER AND THE CONGRESS AND

18
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:26,498
THE SUPREME COURT AS WELL.

19
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,333
THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR HE

20
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,468
DOES NOT EXPECT TO PARDON

21
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:30,735
HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAYS HE HAS

22
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,705
DONE NOTHING WRONG.

23
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:34,806
CLOSELY MATCHING THE MESSAGE

24
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:37,309
OF THE WEEKEND OF THE LEAD

25
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:38,510
ATTORNEY RUDY GIULIANI WHO

26
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,678
RAISED THE SPECTER OF THIS AND

27
00:00:39,678 --> 00:00:40,946
THEN ADDED IT'S UNTHINKABLE

28
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:42,147
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD DO IT

29
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:43,748
BECAUSE IT WOULD LIKELY LEAD

30
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:44,749
TO IMPEACHMENT.

31
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,985
THE KEY TRUMP ADVISERS TELL ME

32
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,186
AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT

33
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:49,187
GIULIANI IS DOING WITH THE

34
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,522
PRESIDENT'S BLESSING IS

35
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:52,157
SIGNALING TO MUELLER THERE IS

36
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:53,692
STILL A SMALL CHANCE OF

37
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:54,593
ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW BUT ONLY

38
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:56,661
IF THE QUESTIONS ARE SEVERELY

39
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:57,028
LIMITED.

40
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,030
THIS IS A WARNING SHOT IF THE

41
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,632
SPECIAL COUNSEL WANTS TO ISSUE

42
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,367
A SUBPOENA TO COMPEL THE

43
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,335
PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY HE IS

44
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,736
READY FOR A BATTLE IN COURT.

45
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:07,005
I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT

46
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,840
OFFERED COMBATIVE TONE AS HE

47
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,442
DID A PHONE CALL A SHORT TIME

48
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,011
AGO WITH THE MINNESOTA

49
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,212
REPUBLICAN PARTY CELEBRATING

50
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:15,981
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF HIS

51
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:18,783
FIRST 500 DAYS IN OFFICE.

52
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,051
LISTEN.

53
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:20,752
>> President Trump: WE HAVE

54
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,654
A LOT OF PEOPLE AGAINST US AND

55
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:24,222
THE PHONY RUSSIAN WITCH HUNT

56
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,490
THAT IS BEING DISCREDITED.

57
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,092
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

58
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:27,792
DISCREDITED DISGRACE.

59
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:28,860
IT'S NOT EVEN CONSTITUTIONAL

60
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,428
IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S OPINION,

61
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:31,663
IN MY OPINION, TOO.

62
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,298
>> AS YOU NOTED THIS BATTLE OF

63
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:35,066
COURSE COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF

64
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,601
THE EXTRAORDINARY 20-PAGE MEM

65
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,737
ROW THAT IS SENT -- MEMO SENT

66
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,038
TO THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN

67
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:41,206
JANUARY BUT TWO OF THE

68
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:41,940
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEYS

69
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,775
AT THE TIME.

70
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,310
JOHN DOWD WHO IS NOW OUT AND

71
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,479
JAY SEKULOW WHO IS STILL IN.

72
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,948
HE SAYS THE PRESIDENT CANNOT

73
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,316
ASSERT JUSTICE BUT HAS THE

74
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,250
POWER TO SHUT THE

75
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,185
INVESTIGATION DOWN WHEN HE

76
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:53,552
WANTS.

77
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:54,853
THE MEMO SAYS THE PRESIDENT

78
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,154
HIMSELF DICTATED A STATEMENT

79
00:01:56,154 --> 00:01:57,689
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE

80
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,957
MISLEADING ABOUT HIS SON

81
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:00,158
DONALD TRUMP JR.'S 2016

82
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:01,092
MEETING AT THE TRUMP TOWELLER

83
00:02:01,092 --> 00:02:01,793
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

84
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,861
THAT CONFLICTS WITH SARAH

85
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:03,695
SANDERS.

86
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:07,599
AND WHAT JAY SEKULOW LAST YEAR

87
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,600
SAID MINIMIZING THE

88
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,668
PRESIDENT'S ROLE DRAFTING THE

89
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:10,134
STATEMENT.

90
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,404
I CAN TELL YOU THE FORMER

91
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,706
DEPUTY TO INDEPENDENT COUNSEL

92
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:17,309
KEN STARR SAYS THE MEMO IS

93
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:18,176
HELPFUL TO PRESIDENT.

94
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:18,677
WATCH.

95
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:19,811
>> IT'S THE LEAKING OF THE

96
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,246
LETTER WHICH I BELIEVE HAD TO

97
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:23,081
HAVE COME FROM THE CAMP OF THE

98
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,749
PRESIDENT THAT I THINK IS SO,

99
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:29,254
SUCH A BRILLIANT MANEUVER.

100
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,690
THIS SHOWS A NUMBER OF THINGS.

101
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,325
FIRST, IT SHOWS THAT THE

102
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:34,392
MUELLER'S TEAM VIEW OF

103
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:39,231
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS

104
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:39,965
FRIGHTENLY BROAD.

105
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:41,066
>> Sarah: HE CERTAINLY

106
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:41,633
DIDN'T DICTATE.

107
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,402
HE WEIGHED IN AND OFFERED

108
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:45,804
SUGGESTION LIKE ANY FATHER

109
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,471
WOULD DO.

110
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,339
>> THAT WAS LAST YEAR.

111
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:48,506
TODAY AT THE PODIUM SARAH

112
00:02:48,506 --> 00:02:49,407
SANDERS AGAIN SAID THE

113
00:02:49,407 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT DID NOT DICTATE THAT
