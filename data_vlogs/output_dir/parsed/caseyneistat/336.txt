just straight up stay here con state
Johnny okay
I normally I ride the skateboard to him
from work but last night I came home on
this ridiculous electric motorcycle
thing
so with that time getting to work today
pretty ridiculous on this thing
haven't done an update on the new space
in a while things are really coming
along now during the last update people
expressed a lot of concern over the
integrity of the loft behind me here
firstly I shared those concerns I just
didn't want to say things I didn't want
Dylan up there to feel bad but the lots
been reinforced and anywhere also the
lighting under the loft here is just
about done so now we have this space
here a space up there and then this
enormous space behind me where
production is gonna take place
major progress
I haven't done a proper like tech camera
review and a lot of time people always
ask me about technology people always
ask me about cameras it's something I
want to talk about more I think a lot of
the people that watch this channel are
also interested in filmmaking and things
like that so any opportunity I have to
like share insights
I haven't the gear is something I'm
psyched to do what this is here is a
piece of technology I'm super excited
about so I have like this I have this
big expensive camera stabilizer here and
then I also have the DJI Osmo which is a
tiny stabilized camera that looks like
this this thing's pretty great but the
image quality
it doesn't quite match like the digital
SLR this is an image stabilizer
for my camera that's supposed to be
really small this is not a product
endorsement I'm not being paid by these
guys if this thing sucks I promise you
I'll tell you it sucks whoa all right
so theoretically how this let me get it
theoretically how this thing works you
take an SLR camera like this put it on
here hold it like this and it keeps it
perfectly steady seems a little too good
to be true for me but let me set it up
test it and I'll let you know what I
think
invested in something wrong Sione
absolutely ate
I got it balanced it seems pretty good
I'm gonna run around the studio now
shooting in selfie mode to see what this
thing looks like get ready
test number one
all right it looks pretty good I need to
play with this thing I need to get into
it before I can give like a proper
thumbs-up or thumbs-down but I'm glad
the technology exists
Shawn it has brakes I don't know how to
use the brakes
I feel like it's gonna break so I just
jump off Shawn asked for the best pizza
in New York City naturally I took him
two Joe's pip we got some in New York
City today what's up guys oh hey whoa
oh no oh yeah what do you want nothing
for me I'm just it's not that I don't
walk Pete's I do want pizza I'm just
trying to refrain from pizza for a
couple of days I'm meeting a lot of crap
lately so
Shawn wanted to eat in the park so we
wrote of the park which is like three
blocks away but he's carrying his pizza
on the skateboard Oh impressive done
Pepita right there on the left Shawn
your other left
dude I am gonna die in that intersection
because there are cars coming and I
couldn't stop so I just had to turn and
go with it the look successful Pizza
ready for this first fight being
unhealthy is the best feeling in the
world can see John's RTD is crust so
it's cheating but it's not really
either you can live in a place like New
York City I like K I hated New York City
my first game cuz I just like the
challenge your question no you couldn't
live yeah I couldn't I couldn't hack it
I'd die in like 18 days do you recognize
this is where we got in our place
so we're just going to me Jesus straight
up stay here constant
if you want to raw vegan organic juice
that looks so much less cool than pizza
how was your New York City ish tour it
wasn't a tour it was you had seats I had
juice it's good sort of sums up my
afternoon pizzas way better than juice
though yeah I don't think anybody's
gonna argue with you on that
this is Broadway show see Broadway is a
slight downhill lot of pedestrian
don't be intra stops at Subway
Shawn is a fantastic skateboarder but on
a boosted board
it's a bhutesu board is so different
from regular skateboard and I don't
think he appreciates that enough case in
point
him attempting to go down these stairs
here on an electric skateboard

scared to the ball over dere oh no I
didn't hear you I won't skateboard
enough no skateboarding on those stairs
