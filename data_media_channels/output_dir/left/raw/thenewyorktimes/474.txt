1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,675
Most of the objects look
like a kind of an oversized

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:15,248
walnut, and you open it up 
and inside are tiny scenes —

3
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:20,553
very complicated,
almost noisy.

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:24,124
There's one bead where 
my colleagues counted how many

5
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,593
figures were just
in the top half —

6
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:33,066
58 separate figures
within that tiny space.

7
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,108
These really existed as ways 
for people to meditate.

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,946
Kind of a portal to prayer.
So for example in a scene like

9
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,483
the crucifixion there
are tiny spears.

10
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,522
Every spear is a little
splinter of wood,

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,658
separately inserted.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,770
With the wise men,
I love it because

13
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,573
the first of the kings is
already offering a gift to the

14
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,641
baby Jesus.

15
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,709
The second king is right 
behind him.

16
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,479
The third king is on the
opposite side

17
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,850
right next to his camel and
his servant has this bag

18
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,920
and you can tell he's
hurrying him to get that gift

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,358
out of the bag because his turn
is coming and he might be late.

20
00:01:32,358 --> 00:00:00,000
All of that within two inches.
It's extraordinary.
