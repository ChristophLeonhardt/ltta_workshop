trapping a Ferrari is nothing like driving a Honda Accord and I'm not just talking about how it feels when you're actually on the road I'm talking about how you actually get the car moving unlike most really fancy modern cars the f12 berlinetta actually comes with a physical key so this part is pretty standard put on the brake key in turn plenty of cars sound great when you start them up and they'll throw in a little extra Flair this is the best starting noise I've ever heard and it feels like an explosion under you I've been driving this car pretty much constantly for the last three days and it has not gotten old yet now there's no gearshift in this car the only button that's relevant here is our four reverse so you're going to get it into gear is with the paddle shifters here now the car will start in automatic mode and you don't have to do anything with the shifters it'll change gears all on its own but if you want to have a little more fun or you're bold enough to think you know how to drive better than the car you can just drop it into manual mode just by using the shifters yourself oh my god I am having so much fun once you can hit on the pedal and have the liberty of a few hundred yards to have in front of you of freedom then you understand why people spend $300,000 and up on cars like these
