the oceans about to get a lot cleaner this is an amazing story a lot of people have ideas about like here's how we should fix this giant thing but there's a the time a high school student named boy onslaught and here is the best cover of anything I've ever seen the hair is everywhere and all good screaming in fidelity's is these boy onslaught and it says relative on ocean which is neederlander force Savior of the oceans oh okay there's these huge garbage patches out in the middle of the ocean but most oceans have at least one and they're the biggest one is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it's a bunch of floating plastic up to 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic are just floating in the ocean Wow because and don't worry these are reusable straws but straws contribute in a in a large way to this but Boyan was like what if we just floated something out there to just kind of round it up just scoop it all at once just get it all going and now that idea years later literally just left the San Francisco Bay that's awesome to go and round it all up it is a fantastic invention essentially what it is is it floats on you take it out to where it needs to be and it floats on its own and it uses the wind to push the top of it so that it goes faster than the plastic and then the bottom has like the skirt that hangs down and it naturally just wraps up all the plastic oh okay like get groups at all together yeah he was just like why don't we rounded up like in my pool it's by like the little hose thing like a big noodle pulling it off it's the ocean noodle I mean I've I've had a lot of ideas yeah have you ever had an idea for an invention that you were just like I gotta do this not one I'm proud of but my mom is very proud of when I was nine years old at the Invention Convention and fourth grade where I made a cat box which is basically I put Tupperware over my cat but I carved out a hole so like it was basically a house for a cat so the cat could eat the food without my dog eating the food oh it was just a wall that my mom is very proud a really good idea maybe I went a little wild with that I threw in a disco ball and some music case the cat got lonely with his food I use or whatever was gonna happen that is great what you did has made the dog jealous probably I also made my mom proud and I got a see yes who gives kids a seat mr. Evans does so that is so so annoying yeah I think of your life now right if you were a teacher and someone made like a house for a cat and made disco balls in it right who in their right mind would be like yeah that's at least a - work I think at least I think I think the disco ball brings it right up to an a what is so valuable to mr. Evans that he needs to do that I had a terrible invention I'm just remembering it what is it I had it was a planter mm-hmm but it was also a shovel okay but now it makes and the idea was the scooper you detach the handle and now it's just a pot oh that's not that's not a good idea oh no it's not a good because now you don't have a shovel you just got rid of it right okay now I see why that that's the sea that's where the sea grade would probably say I'm an idiot anyways this this Oh at the ocean cleanup calm you can go see all the information about it it aims to clean up 50% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch if it is successful within five years Wow and collect up 90% of it by 2040 amazing a plus he deserves the A+
