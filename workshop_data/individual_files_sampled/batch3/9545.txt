ON THE 12TH, DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT GETS ALL DONE AT ONE MEETING. MAYBE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND OR THIRD. MAYBE WE WILL HAVE NONE! Bret: MULTIPLE SUMMITS? WE HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE. BY THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THIS POSSIBLE SUMMIT ON JUNE 12TH, IF IT STAYS, TALKING TO REUTERS ON AIR FORCE ONE, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT DONE IN ONE MEETING, BUT OFTENTIMES THAT IS NOT THE WAY THAT THE DEAL WORKS. THERE IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT IT WILL NOT BE DONE IN ONE MEETING OR TWO MEETINGS OR THREE MEETINGS, BUT IT WILL GET DONE AT SOME POINT. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE LETTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO JUNE 12, WHERE HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TOTAL DENUCLEARIZATION AND AS QUICK AS PRACTICABLE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MACHINERY. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY, BUT THEY CAN HAPPEN IN AS RAPID A FASHION AS THEY CAN HAPPEN. THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, START THERE. JONATHAN SWANN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR AXIOS, MOLLIE HEMINGWAY. A SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST COMING IN CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST." I SENSE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A SETTING OF EXPECTATIONS HERE OF WHAT COULD BE A FIRST IN A SERIES THAT THEY DO NOT THINK THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT ALL IN ONE. I TALKED TO A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL YESTERDAY THEY SAY THAT TODAY ARE STILL HOPING THAT IT IS JUNE 12, BUT THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY, THERE WERE NOT DETAILS WITH NORTH KOREA, IT COULD BE PUSHED OUT BY A FEW DAYS. AND OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS, IF KIM JONG UN, SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN THAT BLOWS NO BOLTING UP. Bret: IT IS SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TOP GUY IS COMING. TO THE OVAL OFFICE. VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND WORKING UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN, THE PRESIDENT WANTS IT TO HAPPEN. AND EVEN THE SKEPTICS ON HIS TEAM LIKE JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR KNOWS THAT THE PRESIDENCY IS A PATH HERE. AND THEY ARE NOT FIGHTING THE DECISION. Bret: IT DOES NOT MATTER THE DATE OF JUNE 12, IT MATTERS WHAT THEY GET OUT OF IT. AND IF THEY GET OUT OF IT. THERE IS A PATTERN IN HISTORY WHERE YOU HAVE A REALLY LONG LEAD UP TO A MEETING. WORK OUT AND YOU NEGOTIATE WHAT WILL BE DISCUSSED. THEN YOU HOPE FOR THE BEST I WILL HAVE AN EDIT WEEDING. ONE GETS THE SENSE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SUCH BAD COMMUNICATION, MAY BE JUST MEETING AND GETTING THINGS STARTED RIGHT AWAY WILL BE HELPFUL EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT THINK THAT TERRIBLY MUCH WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED SO EARLY THAT IT WILL TAKE FURTHER MEETINGS AND MORE HASHING OUT. AND IF WE DID HERE BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP CANCELED A MEETING THAT NORTH KOREA HAVE PROPOSED SIMILAR THINGS ALONG THE LINE TO WHAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED IN THE PAST. WHEN THEY GET A BIG BUNDLE OF MONEY FOR PROMISING TO DO SOMETHING. I DO NOT THINK THAT THAT WILL SATISFY THE U.S. NEGOTIATORS THIS TIME AROUND. Bret: IN THE MEANTIME, THE RUSSIANS ARE MAKING A MOVE TO NORTH KOREA. HE SENDS HIS WARMEST REGARDS AND BEST WISHES AND THE ENDEAVORS THAT HAVE BEEN INITIATED ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION. THE SITUATION ON THE CAN KOREAN PENINSULA IS CHANGING ACCORDING THAT PUTIN'S GOVERNMENT IS ACTING IN OPPOSITION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE READY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE RUSSIAN SIDE. PIECE, PER VILLAGE HE, AND PROSPERITY IN SOUTHEAST IN GENERAL ARE IN OUR INTEREST. Bret: WARM AND FUZZY WITH KIM JONG UN, CLEARLY SENDING A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE STILL AROUND. WE ARE STILL AROUND, WE ARE STILL ON YOUR BORDER. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. YES, IT IS A BIG EVENT, WHATEVER IT WAS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE IS GETTING SERIOUS BETWEEN YOU AND DONALD TRUMP. WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING ABOUT THAT LITTLE MEETING IS THAT IT SHOWS KIM JONG UN HAS SOMEHOW MANAGED TO PUT HIMSELF, IT'S ON THE PSYCHE IS COURTING, HE IS SORT OF THE MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR IN NORTHEAST ASIA, AND EVERYBODY IS COMING TO HIM TO SEE WHAT HE WANTS. AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. TRYING TO GET INFLUENCE WITH HIM. I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY STRONG POSITION FOR HIM TO BE IN. THE UNITED STATES HAS QUITE OPENLY SAID, IF YOU DO BUSINESS WITH US, IF YOU GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, WE ARE PREPARED TO GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY, MAKE YOU RICH. THE PRESIDENT EVEN SAID, MAKE YOU HAPPY. AND THAT IS A VERY SWEET OFFER THAT PROBABLY ALARMS THE RUSSIANS AND THE CHINESE A LITTLE BIT THAT MAY BE THE UNITED STATES, MY GOSH, WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL POWER RIGHT HERE IN NORTHEAST ASIA. AND THEY ARE MOVING TO CHECK IT OUT. Bret: IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE STILL CHECKING THE RUSSIA PROBE ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT FRONTS. THE PRESIDENT TWEETING TODAY A NUMBER OF TWEETS, BUT THIS ONE, NOT THAT IT MATTERS WHAT I NEVER FIRED JAMES COMEY BECAUSE OF RUSSIA. THE CORRUPT MAINSTREAM MEDIA LOVES TO KEEP PUSHING THAT NARRATIVE, BUT THEY KNOW THAT IT IS NOT TRUE. THAT PROMPTED A LOT OF LOOKING INTO SOUND BITES. LIKE THIS ONE FROM NBC. REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATION, I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY, KNOWING THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD TIME TO DO IT. IN FACT, WHEN I DECIDED TO JUST DO IT, I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIAN THING WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A MADE UP STORY, IT IS A EXCUSE BY THE DEMOCRATS FOR HER LOST INCORPORATED LOSING AN ELECTION THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE WON. Bret: WHAT IS THE DEAL? DID YOU FIGURE OUT THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE? THEY ARE NOT TALKING MUCH ON THIS. I ACTUALLY DID SOME REPORTING TODAY ON OTHER CONVERSATIONS THAT TRUMP HAS BEEN HAVING PRIVATELY, PRESSURING JEFF SESSIONS FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR OVER THIS. THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A PARTICULARLY GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT COMMENT. THERE IS A GREAT ANSWER, IF YOU DO THE CLIP JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER HE TALKS ABOUT MORE THAT HE KNOWS THAT FIRING COMEY MIGHT EXTEND THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. BUT IT STILL MUST BE DONE. THAT CLIP IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND PIT HE IS SAYING THAT HE DID NOT LIKE HOW JAMES COMEY WAS PRIVATELY ASSURING HIM THAT HE WAS NOW THE TARGET OF A RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WHILE PUBLICLY SUGGESTING TO THE WORLD THAT HE WAS. EVEN THOUGH JAMES COMEY WAS DOING THESE J. EDGAR HOOVER TYPE OF GAMES IT MIGHT CAUSE HIM TROUBLE ON THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, HE NEEDED TO FIRE HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SO BAD AT HIS JOB AND BECAUSE HE WAS BAD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I THINK PARTICULARLY WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT JAMES COMEY IN THE YEAR SINCE THAT INTERVIEW WAS GIVEN, WHICH I THINK WAS JUST ABOUT A YEAR AGO NOW, WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTAND OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING. Bret: SURE, BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE YOU TALKING FOR THEM AND THEY DO NOT HAVE YOU EXPLAINING IT TO. WHEN THE TWEETS COMES OUT, IT IS NOT THAT CLEAR. SO A LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE TO READ BETWEEN I WILL NOT DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB MESSAGING WHAT IS BEING SAID. AND PUTTING OUT WHAT THAT WHOLE INTERVIEW WAS SHOWN. IT IN THE MEANTIME RUDY GIULIANI IS GOING AFTER TREY GOWDY ON WHAT HE SAID OF THE INFORMANT OR SPY, TAKE A LISTEN. I WENT TO SEE THE DOCUMENTS THAT TREY GOWDY HAS NEVER SEEN, WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET MY CLIENT TESTIFY, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, EVEN IF HE WANTS TO WITHOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS BEING PRODUCED. IF AND WHEN WE FIND THAT THIS WAS HANDLED APPROPRIATELY, AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN BASE THIS ON THE INVESTIGATION, WE WILL HAVE HIM TESTIFY. Bret: CHUCKLED. WELL TREY GOWDY DID DELIVER AT LEAST IN P.R. TERMS A VERY HEAVY BLOW TO THE TRUMP POSITION IN THIS BY COMING FORWARD AND BLESSING THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION, SORRY, THE FBI INVESTIGATION PRIOR TO MUELLER, DURING THE ELECTION. SO OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE PUSHING BACK VERY HARD. I THINK THAT IF I MAY STEP BACK, WITH WHAT RUDY GIULIANI IS DOING IS A PIECE THAT WOULD PUT THE TRUMP TWEET TODAY, PREPARING THE GROUND ON ALL KINDS OF AREAS FOR WHAT MIGHT BE THE EVENTUAL CONFRONTATION WITH MUELLER. LAYING DOWN MARKERS OF HERE IS OUR VERSION OF EVENTS. HERE IS OUR VERSION OF THE FACTS. TREY GOWDY GOING TO FOLLOW THAT, SO THEY PUSH BACK. I WROTE AT "THE FEDERALIST" THAT TREY GOWDY DID NOT SEE ALL OF THE SUBPOENAED DOCUMENTS THAT THEY ARE SEEKING TO USE THE INFORMANT THAT HE ALSO SEEMS CONFUSED WHETHER IT WAS A CRIMINAL PROBE, WE DO NOT USE THE TERM SPY AND CRIMINAL PROBES, BUT WE SHOULD ALL KNOW BECAUSE JAMES COMEY TESTIFIED ABOUT THIS IN MARCH 2017, THIS WAS NOT A CRIMINAL PROBE, THIS WAS A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROBE. SPIES ARE COMMON IN A COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROBE, WE DO WITH POLITICAL OPPONENTS DURING A CAMPAIGN, I THINK IT IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING. AND THINKING THROUGH AND KNOWING SO MUCH MORE ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS, INTERNAL WATCHDOGS, OR PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA. Bret: WHEN TREY GOWDY HAS THESE MEETINGS AND AGREE THAT THEY DID NOT BRING IN ANY DOCUMENTS, AND THEY HAVE A CLASSIFIED DEBRIEFING AND THEY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND HE SAYS, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHAT THE FBI WAS DOING AT THE TIME, AND YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT. HOW IS THAT INTERPRETED ANY OTHER WAY? WELL I AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT TREY GOWDY WAS SAYING. ALTHOUGH HE DOES HAVE A HISTORY OF BEING A FAN OF THE FBI. BUT HE ALSO COMPLETED WHAT HE WAS SAYING IN THESE INTERVIEWS ABOUT WHAT'S PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD. WHEN JAMES COMEY FIRST PRESENTED TO HIM INFORMATION ABOUT THE RUSSIANS, WHICH WAS AFTER THE ELECTION PERIOD HE SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE A FULLY INVESTIGATED. AND TREY GOWDY SAID, THIS MEANS THAT IT WAS OKAY TO RUN AN INFORMANT AGAINST YOUR CAMPAIGN. AND I DO NOT THINK THAT HE FURTHER SAID THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT THE USE OF INFORMANTS. HE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD GRASP ON WHAT AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT RUNNING INFORMANTS ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. Bret: I WANT TO GET TO THE REST OF THE PANEL, WE ONLY HAVE A QUICK AMOUNT OF TIME, BUT JONATHAN, ALSO TODAY, THE PARDON OF DINESH DESOUSA, THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A PARDON OF MARTHA STEWART SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT USE OF PARDON POWERS IS CONCERNING ENOUGH BREAD FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY BE SENDING A MESSAGE TO WITNESSES IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. IS A PART IN A PARDON OR A PART IN A MESSAGE? I AM A REPORTER, SO I NEED FACTS. AND THIS IS THE SAME THING AS BEFORE, I CAN ONLY REPORT WHAT I KNOW FOR A FACT. I DO NOT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID TO DO
