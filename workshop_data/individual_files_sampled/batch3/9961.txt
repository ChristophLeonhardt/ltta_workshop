NIKKI HALEY, AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL FOR ME. SHE HAS DONE A SHE HAS DONE GREAT JOB. WE'RE SAD TO LOSE YOU. YOU WILL COME BACK AT SOME POINT MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PICK. STEVE: LOOK AT THAT HE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN TO HER. KELLYANNE, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. KELLYANNE, YOU ARE THERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. WHITE HOUSE IT LOOKS LIKE PROBABLY KNEW BEHIND THE SCENES THAT SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE. WE DIDN'T. WHY IS SHE LEAVING? CAN YOU TELL US. IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE AMBASSADOR AND PRESIDENT HAVE SEEN. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE SHEAR VOLUME AND VELOCITY WITH THE WAY THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS SENIOR ADVISORS WORK MEANS YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH A GREAT AMOUNT IN A VERY LIMITED TIME. LOOK WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE. HISTORIC ECONOMY. WORKING ON PEACE. NEW TRADE DEALS. MODERNIZED TRADE DEALS. DEREGULATION, OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST TAX CUT. TWO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. 26 ON THE CIRCUIT COURTS. THAT ACTUALLY HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT INTO ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AS WELL. I THINK AT THE UNITED NATIONS AMBASSADOR HALEY HAS DISTINGUISHED HERSELF FOR THAT SERVICE. SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED ON THE WORLD STAGE SINCE THIS PRESIDENT HAS BECOME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND HELD OFFICE HERE. AND ALSO, I'M GOING TO TAKE AMBASSADOR HALEY AT HER WORD THAT SHE IS LEAVING PUBLIC SERVICE NOW, OBVIOUSLY SHE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC SERVANT FOR, GOSH, I THINK IT'S MAYBE 15 OR 16 CONSECUTIVE YEARS NOW. AND SHE WILL GO OUT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR, I BELIEVE, AND DO VERY WELL. I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE HER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. I SORT OF THOUGHT MAYBE SHE WOULD SAY SHE WAS LEAVING NEW ZEALAND TO JOIN THE PRESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THESE LAST 30 DAYS BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT OUT THERE. BUT, SHE FEELS LIKE SHE HAS MORE WORK TO ACCOMPLISH. BUT, AMBASSADOR HALEY WILL BE DEEPLY MISSED AND WIDELY RESPECTED. AND FINALLY REGARDED FOR A FONDLY REGARDED FOR A VERY LONG TIME. NOT JUST THE WORK SHE ACCOMPLISHED BUT THE WAY SHE ACCOMPLISHED THAT WORK THE GRACE, DIGNITY. THE AMERICA FIRST WAY SHE WENT ABOUT HER WORK. REMEMBER WHEN SHE RAISED HER HAND, SHE PRESIDED OVER HISTORIC BACK-TO-BACK UNANIMOUS VOTES AGAINST I BELIEVE IT WAS RUSSIA OR NORTH KOREA AT THE TIME. THOSE WERE SIGNIFICANT. WITH HER AT THE TABLE, THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SPLISH SO MUCH ON THE WORLD STAGE. WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL AND SHE'LL BE MISSED. BRIAN: KELLYANNE, IN YOUR PRIOR LIFE AND NEW LIFE YOU LOOK AT POLLS ALL THE TIME AND LOOK AT TRENDS ALL THE TIME. THEY SAY, POLITICO SAYS 209 SEATS EITHER FIRMLY OR LEANING DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE. ONLY FINAL SHINE OF THE 218. DO YOU AGREE WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND, IF SO, OR IF NOT, WHAT DO THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS DO FOR THOSE NUMBERS? A COUPLE THINGS. HISTORICAL FRIENDS MEAN THAT THE PARTY IN POWER LOSES SEATS IN THE HOUSE. THIS IS JUST A PRESIDENT WHO DEFIES TRENDS. AND RATHER THAN REPEATING HISTORY HE TENDS TO MAKE HISTORY. YOU CAN SEE WHAT HIS STRATEGY IS BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY. HE IS LEAVING IT ALL ON THE FIELD, RUNNING THROUGH THE TAPE, EXACTLY WHAT HE AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE DID IN 2016. SAME STRATEGY. AND HE IS BRINGING IN HUGE CROWDS TO THESE RALLIES NOT BECAUSE IT'S NEW TO THEM THAT MR. TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD COME TO THEIR STATE OR AREAS, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE AS A WAY TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MAKING GOOD ON SO MANY PROMISES SPARING AN ECONOMIC BOOM THAT MANY IN THE MEDIA WANT TO CONTINUAL TO IGNORE EVERY DAY BUT THAT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL THEY HAVE GOT JOB SECURITY BUT ALSO JOB MOBILITY. AND SO THERE ARE 43 RETIREMENTS. I THINK THE HARDEST THING ABOUT THE HOUSE MAP IS THAT THERE ARE 43 REPUBLICAN RETIREMENTS. INCLUDING IN STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY AND CALIFORNIA WHERE HAD YOU LONG-TERM REPUBLICAN MEMBERS IN SEATS THAT IN 23 SEATS, FRANKLY THAT EVEN THE WOMAN WHO LOST THAT ELECTION HAD CARDS HAD CEEDS HAD CEERD HAD CARRD HAD CARRIED IN 2016. THAT'S TOUGH BUT THIS PRESIDENT IS OUT THERE SAYING HEY A VOTE FOR THIS PERSON IS A VOTE FOR MY AGENDA AND HE CAN DO THAT HAVING SAID ALL THAT LET'S NOT FORGET THE SAME GENIUSES THAT PREDICTED A HUGE ROMP BY THAT WOMAN WHO LOST IN 2016 ARE THE SAME PEOPLE PREDICTING A HUGE WIN BY THE DEMOCRATS THIS TIME. SO WE HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS. I HEAR THAT OFTEN WHEN I'M OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND MY PERSONAL TIME. PEOPLE WILL SAY HEY, I DON'T BELIEVE THESE POLLS BECAUSE IT COMES FROM THE SAME MEDIA THAT'S 92% NEGATIVE IN THEIR COVERAGE ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. AND SO, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO DETER THEM FROM SHOWING UP. WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THE KAVANAUGH HEARINGS? I THINK BECAUSE THE LEFT CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT ALONE. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LOOK AT THE DIGNITY AND STURDINESS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, ALL 8 JUSTICES COMING TO THIS WHITE HOUSE IN THE EAST ROOM IN THE FRONT ROW TO WELCOME PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LATEST NOMINEE, JUSTIFIABLE KAVANAUGH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REMARKABLE MOMENT TO SEE ALL OF THEM HERE, INCLUDING THE THREE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOMINATED BY TWO DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS. THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS A SACROSANCT STURDY INSTITUTION THAT WILL WITH STABBED THOSE PEOPLE FLAILING AND WHALEY IN FRONT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. ARE THEY ENERGIZED? PERHAPS. ARE THEY IS IT PURPOSEFUL? DID THEY BECOME ANGRY LAST THREE WEEKS BECAUSE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH OR LAST THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP. I DON'T THINK SO. THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAY THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAR THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAT THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAG THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAI THEY HAVE BEEN MARION NAGHTD MAN RANCOR AND SHOW UP AT THE POLLS AS WELL. AGES AGES THEY ARE MAD BECAUSE THEIR CANDIDATE DIDN'T WIN, THAT WAS HILLARY CLINTON. MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING LET'S BE CIVIL, LET'S GET ALONG. LET'S UNIFY BUTLIKE, SHE IS AGREEING WITH THE MAXINE WATERS OF THE WORLD IT A APPEARS. SEE IS SAYING CIVILITY IS NOT AN OPTION. YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IF WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE AND/OR THE SENATE, THAT'S WHEN CIVILITY CAN START AGAIN. STEVE: WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY, KELLYANNE? LOOK, SHE USUALLY WHEN SHE OPENINGS HER MOUTH RESPECTFULLY SHE OFFENDS ONE HALF OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE DID IT AGAIN. I THINK HER DISCOURSE NOW IS DANGEROUS. I DON'T LIKE THE IMPLICATIONS HERE. ONE THING TO CALL US DEPLORABLE, IRREDEEMABLE. LAUGH AT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD ALL THE PRIVILEGES SHE HAS HAD WITH IVY LEAGUE LAW DEGREE AND MARRIAGE A MAN WHO WAS A TWO TERM PRESIDENT THAT SHE WILL NEVER BE. I DON'T LIKE THAT KIND OF TALK AND I AVOID IT MY BOSS HAS CALLED FOR CIVILITY. HE SAYS HE REPRESENTS ALL AMERICANS. WE DON'T RUN AROUND ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION IS WHEN HE IS CUTTING THEIR TAXES AND ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE FREE OF REGULATIONS AND GROWTH. WE ARE IMPERVIOUS TO THAT. AND, YET, I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE, I DON'T SEE ALL THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BANGING DOWN HILLARY CLINTON'S DOOR ASKING HER. BRIAN: SHE IS DYING TO MATTER. AGAIN, SHE HAS TO GO WITH HER HUSBAND TO DO THIS 13-CITY TOUR, 120 MILLION BUCKS. BRIAN: 700 BUCKS A TICKET. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DONATE TO SOME WOMEN AND GIRLS. I DON'T SEE HER DOING THAT UNFORTUNATE AND GRACELESS BUT A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS. BRIAN: GOTCHA. KANYE WEST COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE TOMORROW. WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA BESIDES LUNCH? MAYBE HE WILL HAVE HIS FAMOUS RED HAT. SEVERAL THINGS ON THE AGENDA. OBVIOUSLY HE HAS CONNECTED TISSUE WITH MANY AMERICANS. AND CAN, I THINK, COMMUNICATE PARTS OF PRESIDENT'S AGENDA THAT HE AGREES WITH AND WILLING TO FIGHT FOR. OBVIOUSLY JARED KUSHNER AND THE PRESIDENT ARE WORKING ON PRISON REFORM. KANYE WEST'S WIFE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE TALKING ABOUT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND VERY BIG IN WHAT I CALL GRAND MUM ALICE ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDEOTAPES OF ALL TIME WATCHING HER RUN TO FREEDOM. I'M HOPING HE WILL ALSO HELP US TACKLE, JOIN WITH US TACKLING OPIOID CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS RANK LING EVERYBODY. TO GET PEOPLE OF HIS STATURE TO ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT THAT. BUT, I THINK, LOOK, WE WELCOME PEOPLE TO THE WHITE HOUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY WHO MAY NOT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THIS PRESIDENT DOES. IT'S ONE OF THE MANY QUALITIES THAT AMERICANS LOVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT WHO ARE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION. NOT BLINDED BY THEIR HATRED. BRIAN: GOTCHA. WE WELCOME HIM AND OTHERS. MANY PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE DOOR THAT YOU DON'T KNOW OF AND HAVE LUNCH WITH THE PRESIDENT. PRIVATELY. AND IT'S AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AND THE PRESIDENT IS INCREDIBLY RESPECTFUL AND OPEN TO LISTENING. IS HE A GREAT LISTENER. MEDICARE FOR ALL BY THE WAY MEDICARE FOR ALL IS SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I ASSUME HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE SAYS THAT THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS PARTY DISAGREE WITH THEIR AGENDA. MEDICARE FOR ALL IS ONE OF THOSE. IT'S ANTI-SENIOR, ANTICHOICE, ANTICONSUMER. THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR IT PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE A NEW GOOD IDEA. TOM PEREZ HAS SAID THAT THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY IS FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL. ABOUT 60 HOUSE MEMBERS AND A THIRD OF THE DEMOCRATS BEHIND IT SENIORS DON'T BE FOOLED. IT'S ANTI-SENIOR, ANTICHOICE. LOSE YOUR DOCTORS AND DESTROY MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AND I KNOW ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WOULD COST. LET ME HELP HER OUT AGAIN ABOUT $32 TRILLION IS THE ESTIMATE OF ITS PRICE TAG. IT'S A HORRIBLE THING. I THINK POST OBAMACARE WITH 20 MILLION AMERICANS STILL LACKING HEALTHCARE, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD ACTUALLY HURT SENIORS AND THEY SHOULD KNOW IT AND THE
