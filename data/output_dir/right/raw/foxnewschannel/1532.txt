GOVERNORSHIP.

23
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,326
HOWEVER, NOT ABLE TO PASS THE

24
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,027
50% THRESHOLD HE WOULD HAVE

25
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:49,596
NEEDED TO AVOID A RUNOFF IN

26
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:49,997

27
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:51,131

PRIMARY WITH A LOT OF PLAYERS IN

33
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:03,243
THE RACE.

34
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:04,077
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT AND IT

35
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:06,213
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE TO MY

36
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:08,415
KNOWLEDGE TO GET TO 50 PLUS ONE.

37
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,816
BUT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT OUR

38
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:10,751
STRATEGY REALLY IS TO CONTINUE

00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,854
TO CARRY OUR MESSAGE ACROSS

40
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:15,222

48
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,237
G.O.P. CONTENDERS.

49
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:31,738
WITH ONLY TWO CANDIDATES IN THE

52
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:34,975

56
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,451
REPRESENTATIVE STACY EVANS.

57
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,620
BOTH STACYS HAD SIMILAR

58
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,221
PLATFORMS BUT DIFFERENT CAMPAIGN

59
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:48,822
STRATEGIES.

60
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:49,689
STACY EVANS TRIED TO BRING

61
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:51,825
SUBURBANITES AND WORKING-CLASS

62
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,026

00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,069
MINORITIES THAT SEEM TO HAVE

68
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,803
PAID OFF.

69
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:03,904
OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL

70
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,072
LIKELY TAKE NOTE OF THIS AS THEY

71
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:09,643
HEAD INTO THE MIDTERMS AND 2020

72
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:10,811
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

73
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:12,446
IF SHE WERE TO WIN BACK THE

74
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,214
GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER,

75
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:15,649

80
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,824
DEMOCRATS DO FACE AN UPHILL

81
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:25,725
BATTLE IN STATEWIDE ELECTIONS IN

82
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,027
GEORGIA.

83
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:29,296
AFTER ALL, GEORGIA REMAINS A

84
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,032
STRONGLY RED STATE, BUT WITH

85
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:35,302
