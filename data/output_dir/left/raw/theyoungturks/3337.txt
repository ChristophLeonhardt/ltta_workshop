1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,889
SAUDI ARABIA HAS BEEN ROILED
WITH CONFLICT OVER THE PAST TWO

2
00:00:02,889 --> 00:00:08,230
DAYS OF BOTH DOMESTIC AND
INTERNATIONAL SORTS.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,230
YOU HAVE

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,400
THIS INTERNAL POWER STRUGGLE
WHERE POWERFUL, WEALTHY PEOPLE

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,440
INSIDE SAUDI ARABIA HAVE BEEN
ROUNDED UP, THEN YOU ALSO HAVE

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,430
AN INCREASING IN THEIR ONGOING
WAR WITH YEMEN, WHERE OVER THE

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,820
WEEKEND A BALLISTIC MISSILE WAS
FIRED INSIDE OF YEMEN TARGETING

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,180
AN AIRPORT NEAR THE CAPITAL OF
SAUDI ARABIA, SOMETHING THAT HAD

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,790
NOT YET HAPPENED IN THIS
CONFLICT, THE MISSILE WAS SHOT

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,790
DOWN, BUT IN RESPONSE SAUDI
ARABIA LAUNCHED WHAT HAS BEEN

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,170
PITCHED AS, OR REPORTERS ARE
SAYING, IS THE BIGGEST, MOST

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,270
DAMAGING ROUND OF AIRSTRIKES IN
ANY ONE PERIOD SINCE THE

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,360
CONFLICT BEGAN.

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,680
THIS IS A
CONFLICT THAT HAS ALREADY KILLED

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,670
MORE THAN 10,000 CIVILIANS, SOME
ARE SAYING OVER 13,000, IT HAS

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,590
DESTROYED SO MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT 7 MILLION PEOPLE ON THE

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,590
BRINK OF FAMINE, AND YEMEN HAS
BEEN THE SITE OF SOME OF THE

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,729
WORST CHOLERA OUTBREAKS IN
RECENT WORLD HISTORY, WHICH THIS

19
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,220
IS NOT THE SORT OF HISTORY YOU
WANT TO BE MAKING.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,220
UNDERSTAND

21
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,740
THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS
MULTIPLE TIMES, THIS IS A

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,990
CONFLICT THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN
AIDING THE SAUDI COALITION ON BY

23
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,900
REFUELING THEIR PLANES,
PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE AND

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,540
LOGISTICS, SO THIS ISN'T
SOMETHING WE ARE INNOCENT ON,

25
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,299
THANKS TO DONALD TRUMP'S
EXTREMELY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,040
WITH THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,080
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, ALEX
JONES CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,630
HE'S A BIG FAN OF THEM.

29
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:48,450
THAT CONTINUED YESTERDAY WITH
HIM SAYING --

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,729
THAT IS NOT A REFERENCE TO
THE WAR, THAT'S A REFERENCE TO

31
00:01:50,729 --> 00:02:03,340
THE MESS THAT CONFLICT, AND HERE
IS HOW THAT HAS LOOKED --

32
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,409
THAT IS A 100,000 SOLDIER
STRONG UNIT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO

33
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,770
PROTECT THE ROYAL FAMILY -- DAMN
THEY HAVE A LOT OF BODYGUARDS --

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,051
THE LEADERSHIP OF THAT WAS
TURNED AROUND, AND THERE WAS A

35
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:24,410
GREATER PURGE --

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,540
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
STILL ALIVE, TWO PRINCES WERE

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:45,150
KILLED --

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,370
THAT IS A THING THAT COULD
HAPPEN, CERTAINLY -- IT'S ALSO

39
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,780
SUSPICIOUSLY TIMED, ALTHOUGH
MAYBE WE WILL FIND OUT MORE IN

40
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
THE FUTURE.

41
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,140
SO THAT IS THE AREA
THAT DONALD TRUMP IS APPARENTLY

42
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,920
IN FAVOR OF, SAYS THAT THESE
SORTS OF ROUNDUPS DONE FOR

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,260
ANTICORRUPTION PURPOSES ARE
POTENTIALLY A GOOD THING.

44
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
WHAT

45
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,459
IS YOUR REACTION TO THE
SITUATION?

46
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,960
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT, I DON'T

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,379
THINK HE HAS THE FOREIGN POLICY
EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND THE

48
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,450
INNER DYNAMICS OF THE SAUDI
ROYAL FAMILY, BUT I JUST KNOW

49
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,520
THAT IN MY LIFETIME I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE SAUDI ROYALS DO THIS TO

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,739
EACH OTHER.

51
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,180
CERTAINLY NOT THIS MUCH AT
ONCE.

52
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,830
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.

53
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,380
WE TALKED ABOUT THE YEMEN

54
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,430
FACTOR AND SAUDI ARABIA, BUT
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THEY HAVE

55
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,880
THIS BOMB THAT THE YEMENIS ARE
SAYING WE DID IT, WE WERE TRYING

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,581
TO BOMB YOUR AIRPORT IN SAUDI
ARABIA, BUT SAUDI ARABIA IS

57
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:47,470
SAYING THIS IS IRAN'S FAULT,
THAT'S WEIRD, AND LEBANON IS

58
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,110
SOMEHOW INVOLVED -- EVERYTHING
IS HITTING THE FAN IN A SCARY

59
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,790
WAY, AND WE HAVE SUPPORTED SAUDI
ARABIA WITH WEAPONS, THE WAY THE

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,510
AIRPORT WAS SAVED WAS WITH AN
AMERICAN MISSILE, SO WE ARE

61
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,989
INVOLVED.

62
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,409
AND I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
THAT IT WILL END UP GOING

63
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,379
THROUGH BUT THERE WAS THIS
GIGANTIC WEAPONS DEAL THAT HE

64
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,330
PUSHED FOR IN THE WAKE OF HIS
WEIRD CRYSTAL BALL MEETING WITH

65
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,349
SAUDI OFFICIALS, THERE WAS
ANOTHER DEAL FOR BILLIONS OF

66
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,139
DOLLARS IN TANKS -- WE ALREADY
KNOW THAT CLUSTER MUNITIONS THAT

67
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,979
HAVE BEEN USED IN YEMEN WERE
SUPPLIED BY THE U.S., THERE WAS

68
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:30,580
AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THOSE SALES,
BUT THEN THE POLITICIANS SAID

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,979
THAT WOULD STIGMATIZE A WEAPON
THAT IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES

70
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:35,460
COULD LOWER CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,639
YES, THAT'S WHAT CLUSTER

72
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,020
MUNITIONS ARE FOR, MAKING SURE
THE WRONG PERSON DOESN'T DIE.

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,770
YEAH, WE ARE WRAPPED UP IN THIS
THING, THE SITUATION IN YEMEN IS

74
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,180
ABOUT AS ROUGH AS IT GETS AROUND
THE WORLD OTHER THAN MAYBE

75
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,550
SYRIA, AND WE ARE PART OF THAT,
AND HE FOR WHATEVER REASON,

76
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,789
WHETHER IT'S IDEOLOGICAL,
WHETHER IT'S BUSINESS, IS GOING

77
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,750
RIGHT ALONG WITH IT. AND I
AGREE, IRAN, THAT'S THE BIG

78
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,330
FACTOR, BECAUSE THAT LURKS IN
THE BACKGROUND OF THIS ENTIRE

79
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,080
SAUDI/YEMEN CONFLICT.

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,150
IF THAT
GOES FROM BEING A PROXY WAR

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,620
EFFECTIVELY, OR 1/2 PROXY WAR,
TO A FULL WAR BETWEEN SAUDI

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,849
ARABIA AND IRAN, YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT SERIOUS DAMAGE BECAUSE

83
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,819
BOTH OF THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT
MILITARIES.

84
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:18,819
AND I AGREE WITH

85
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,800
YOUR INITIAL EVALUATION, I DON'T
KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS SITUATION

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,379
TO TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I
GUARANTEE THAT WHAT I JUST TOLD

87
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,919
YOU IS GREATER THAN THE
UNDERSTANDING OUR PRESIDENT HAS

88
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:27,919
OF THE SITUATION.

89
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,740
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S LITERALLY PLAYING WITH

90
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,759
FIRE, HE IS BLANKET SIGNING ON
TO THESE SORTS OF PURGES.

91
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:37,229
IT'S INTERESTING TOO, ONE
THING WE SKIPPED OVER THAT'S

92
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,430
STRANGE IS THAT ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE BEING ARRESTED ARE BEING

93
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,639
HELD IN THE RITZ-CARLTON.

94
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,169
NICE
JAIL YOU HAVE THERE, SAUDI

95
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:46,169
ARABIA.

96
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:48,720
THEY ARE SOME OF THE RICHEST
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, I'M

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,599
SURE THEY HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF
LUXURY.

98
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,529
THEY ARE GETTING IT.

99
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,300
BUT IN
THAT SAME HOTEL THERE WAS A

100
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,839
BUSINESS CONFERENCE THE WEEK
BEFORE, THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK

101
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,279
ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA'S STATE OWNED
OIL COMPANY, TRUMP ONCE THEM TO

102
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:10,379
OFFER SHARES IN THE U.S. STOCK
EXCHANGE, SO HE IS A BUSINESS

103
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,539
GUY, THAT IS HIS WHOLE PERSONA.

104
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,780
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND SEE

105
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,270
HIM TALKING ABOUT OIL AND
PRAISING THE KING, I'M THINKING

106
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,789
THAT WE WILL UNDERSTAND TRUMP
MUCH BETTER IF WE FOLLOW THE

107
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:22,789
MONEY.

108
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,030
THE WARRING STUFF, I
DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT

109
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,979
SO I TAKE EVERYTHING HE SAYS
WITH A GRAIN OF SALT AND I HOPE

110
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,169
TO GOD THE REST OF THE WORLD
DOES TOO.

111
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,889
I'M WORRIED THAT THE STATE
DEPARTMENT IS BEING RUN LIKE

112
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,370
TRUMP STEAKS.

113
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:44,199
IT'S BEING RUN BY EXXON MOBIL.

114
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,490
THE OIL FACTOR, I DON'T KNOW

115
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:50,559
WHAT IS GOING ON BUT IT SMELLS
LIKE FOSSIL FUELS AND IT MAKES

116
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:51,559
ME REALLY NERVOUS.

117
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:54,770
THAT IS CERTAINLY TRUE.

118
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,770
IT'S
BEEN OBVIOUSLY NOT JUST A

119
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,039
DANGEROUS SITUATION, IT'S BEEN A
DEADLY SITUATION, OVER 10,000

120
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,849
CIVILIANS DEAD, THAT CONTINUES
TO THIS DAY, IT'S A SITUATION

121
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,159
WHERE IF YOU WERE TO GO AROUND
THE COUNTRY AND TALK TO PEOPLE

122
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,439
ABOUT THIS CONFLICT AND OUR ROLE
IN IT, NO ONE WOULD UNDERSTAND

123
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,449
WHY WE ARE IN THE POSITION WE
ARE IN.

124
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:14,449
I'M NOT JUST TALKING

125
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:17,430
ABOUT HIPPIES, YOU GO TO THE
STRONGEST TRUMP SUPPORTER IN THE

126
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,159
WORLD, AND IF YOU DON'T PRIME
THEM WITH DONALD TRUMP LOVES

127
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:23,619
THESE DUDES, BECAUSE THEY WILL
BE ABLE TO SWIFTLY TURNAROUND ON

128
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,819
SAUDI ARABIA THEN, IF YOU JUST
TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE

129
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,300
SITUATION, WHY DO THEY WANT OUR
MONEY BEING SPENT IN SUPPORT OF

130
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,610
THIS CONFLICT IN PART OF THE
WORLD 50% OF THE POPULATION

131
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,659
COULDN'T FIND ON A MAP, THAT
THEY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY

132
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,929
INHERENTLY OPPOSED TO, THAT'S
KILLING CIVILIANS, WHY WOULD

133
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:42,020
ANYONE BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT?

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,559
I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S THE

135
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,649
UNIFORM POSITION OF OUR CURRENT
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO DO THIS WHEN

136
00:07:48,649 --> 00:00:00,000
THERE'S NO SUPPORT AMONG THE
POPULATION.
