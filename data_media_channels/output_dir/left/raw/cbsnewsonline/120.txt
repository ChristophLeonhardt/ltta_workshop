HAPPENING OUT THERE. 

117
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,609
EVERY DAY WE ARE LIFTING OUR 

118
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:04,711

00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,347
SIDELINES, OUT OF THE MARGINS 

120
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,382

OF THAT SITUATION. 

128
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,267
IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENED 

129
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,838
WITH PEOPLE THAT WERE IN PRISON 

130
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:36,509

131
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,410

IT'S A MIRACLE WHAT'S HAPPENED 

139
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,460
IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE 

140
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,663
MUST INVEST IN JOB TRAINING AND 

141
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,065
VOCATIO IN, AL EDUCATION. 

142
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,969
THE FACT IS THAT COMPANIES ARE 

143
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,838
COMING BACK INTO THE COUNTRY. 

144
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,140
COMPANIES THAT LEFT TEN AND20 

145

00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,810
BACK AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO WORK 

147
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,077

WE NEED TALENTED PEOPLE.

00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,648
CALLED HIM A GREAT PATRIOT. 

559
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:27,218
>>  YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR.  

560
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,947
ON THAT BASIS WE STARTED -- A 

561
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,116
GOOD  RELATIONSHIP -- I JUST 

562
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:03,021
FELT AT THIS TIME, POINT IN 

563
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,924
TIME THAT WHAT WE HAD ASSESSED 

564
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,328
AND REASSESSED AND REASSESSED 

565
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,231
AND GONE OVER -- STILL STANDS. 

566
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,333
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT 

567
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,033
STAND ON BEHALF OF THE 

568
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,069
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.  

569
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,378
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE 

570
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:29,614
STATEMENTS RELATIVE TO -- IN 

571
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,750
SUPPORT OF THAT WHICH I 

572
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,418
APPRECIATE. 

573
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:38,223
THE LATEST BEING ON -- I THINK 

574
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,823
ONE OF YOUR RIVAL NETWORKS. 

575
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:42,827
THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT NAMING 

576
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,027
THEM. 

577
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:46,531
KEEP NBC IN FRONT HERE. 

578
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,433
IT WAS A PART OF MY ROLE AND I 

579
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,235
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT I DO 

580
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,870
THAT IT HAS BEEN SAID AND 

581
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,570
DISCUSSED WITH THE PRESIDENT 

582
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,007
AND -- I THINK THAT IT'S TIME 

583
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,008
TO MOVE ON. 

584
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:58,343
>>  WELL,  

585
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:06,650
HE HAS SWITCHED FROM ONE 

586
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,953
POSITION TO THE OTHER EVEN IN 

587
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,923
THE SAME DAY, AS RECENTLY AS 

588
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,223
YESTERDAY. 

589
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:15,527
WHEN YOU WATCH THAT -- WHAT WAS 

590
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,229
YOUR GUT REACTION WATCHING HIM 

591
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,731
VALIDATE PUTIN'S ASSESSMENT 

592
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,064
OVER YOURS? 

593
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:22,066
>>  MY THOUGHT WAS THAT I -- I 

594
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:26,905
BELIEVED THAT I NEED TO CORRECT 

595
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:27,505
THE RECORD FOR THAT. 

596
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,908
THIS IS THE -- THE JOB I SIGNED 

597
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,912
UP FOR AND THAT WAS MY 

598
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,279
RESPONSIBILITY. 

599
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,147
OBVIOUSLY I WISHED HE HAD MADE 

600
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,648
A DIFFERENT STATEMENT. 

601
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:44,155
I THINK THAT NOW THAT HAS -- 

602
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:50,161
BEEN CLARIFIED BASED ON HIS 

603
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:50,828
LATE REACTIONS TO THIS. 

604
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:52,196
SO, I DON'T THINK I WANT TO GO 

605
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:53,031
ANY FURTHER THAN THAT. 

606
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,568
>>  IN THE CABINET ROOM ONE OF 

607
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,202
STATEMENT THAT YOU REFERRED TO. 

608
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,805
HE SAID I ACCEPT OUR 

609
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:01,706
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY'S 

610
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:02,907
CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA'S 

611
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,411
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION 

612
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,147
TOOK PLACE, COULD BE OTHER 

613
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:09,747
PEOPLE ALSO. 

614
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:10,548
COULD BE OTHER PEOPLE ALSO? 

615
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:16,654
WHAT DOES HE KNOW THAT YOU 

616
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,256
DON'T KNOW? 

617
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,060
>>  WELL -- COULD IS NOT A 

618
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,460
DEFINITIVE WORD. 

619
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,429
COULD SOMEONE ELSE BE LOOKING 

620
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,465
AT HOW TO DO THIS? 

621
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,067
RELATIVE TO OUR ELECTIONS? 

622
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,869
POSSIBLY ROGUE STATES, 

623
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,003
WHATEVER? 

624
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,104
WE KNOW OTHERS HAVE POTENTIAL 

625
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,605
ABILITIES. 

626
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,405
IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT THE 

627
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,441
RUSSIANS ARE TAKING THE LEAD ON 

628
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,943
THIS AND THAT BASICALLY THEY 

629
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:45,049
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TRYING TO 

630
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,952
UNDERMINE OUR BASIC VALUES AND 

631
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:53,458
DIVIDE US WITH OUR ALLIES AND 

632
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,860
WREAK HAVOC OVER THE ELECTION 

633
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,127
PROCESS. 

634
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,662
WE NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO MAKE 

635
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,264
SURE THEY AREN'T ABLE TO DO 

636
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,865
THIS WITH THE ELECTION COMING 

637
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,566
UP. 

638
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,368
LEARN THE LESSONS FROM THE 

639
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:03,568
PAST. 

640
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:04,569
PUT IN PLACE THE THINGS THAT WE 

641
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,438
NEED TO PUT IN PLACE IN TERMS 

642
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,605
OF MAKING SURE WE CAN GUARANTEE 

643
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,008
TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHEN 

644
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,110
THEY WALK IN THAT VOTING BOOTH 

645
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,745
AND CAST THEIR VOTE, HOWEVER 

646
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,581
THEY CAST IT IT'S A VALID VOTE. 

647
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,449
IT WON'T BE TAMPERED WITH. 

648
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,049
WHATEVER RESULT COMES THESE 

649
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:20,685
ELECTION IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

650
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,954
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN HAVE 

651
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,157
CONFIDENCE IN, THAT IT WAS NOT 

652
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,292
MANIPULATED BY ANYONE. 

653
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,161
WHETHER THAT WAS EXTERNAL ORRIN 

654
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,195
EVEN INTERNAL. 

655
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,463
WE KNOW WHEN PARTIES HAVE TRIED 

656
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,066
TO MANIPULATE THE VOTES ONE WAY 

657
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:42,039
OR THE OTHER. 

658
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,508
THAT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE. 

659
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,243
DEMOCRACY IS THE ABILITY TO 

660
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,011
HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTED 

661
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,247
OFFICIALS AND WE HAVE TO TAKE 

662
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,181
EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT 

663
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,918
MAKES -- THAT HAPPENS IN THIS 

664
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,986
UPCOMING ELECTION AND FUTURE 

665
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,286
ELECTIONS. 

666
00:30:55,286 --> 00:31:03,461
>>  JUST TO NAIL THIS DOWN THE 

667
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:06,331
-- THE 2017 INTELLIGENCE. 

668
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,566
IT SAID THAT PUTIN HAD A CLEAR 

669
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,900
PRECEDENCE FOR TRUMP. 

670
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,769
18 MONTHS LATER HAS ANYTHING 

671
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,640
CHANGED THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE 

672
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,941
OR LESS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS 

673
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:17,174
PUTIN? 

674
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,743
>>  I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO 

675
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,044
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION THAT'S 

676
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,879
GOING ON AND WHAT THEY MAY 

677
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:22,380
PRODUCE FROM THAT. 

678
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,452
>>  IT TERMS OF THE ASSESSMENT. 

679
00:31:28,452 --> 00:00:00,000
>>
