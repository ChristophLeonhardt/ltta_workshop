but let us stuff I like I'm gonna do some memoirs I like and I'm gonna begin with a completely fake memoir this is this is Norm Macdonald nor MacDonald is of course the comedian who was most famous for being on Saturday Night Live he was fired from Saturday Night Live for making jokes about OJ Simpson because one of the people one of the people at the NBC was a pal of The Simpsons and he has had all kinds of troubles gambling troubles and things like that so he's had a quite an interesting life and he is he's kind of he's less a comedian than he is a performance artist and what he did was he wrote his memoir as a work of fiction it's called I'm sorry I Lawson it's based on a true story sorry based on a true story and the whole point of it is that of course there is no such thing as a true story when the minute you start telling a story it becomes fake and that this thing is so funny and I recommend that you get it on audible get an audible version of it I was listening in the car and this is not an exaggeration I had to pull off the road twice I was laughing so hard that my eyes filled with tears I couldn't see I thought I was gonna die really I thought I was gonna die you know it is so funny it is just he what he does is he kind of it's almost a commentary on the entire idea of of a life story because he gets that a lot of truth and meaning about his life but it's not the true story it's so overblown and so and so crazy and he does he's a master of what used to be called shaggy dog stories these long long long stories that have a kind of weird punchline so we have a little dude with a little bit of a cut but yeah let's play just a little bit of noir McDonald's based on a true story and I stand by the Pyramid of Luxor and gaze upon the firmament above and in a sudden the sky becomes a face and I look away and fear and shame it is the face of God and he speaks and his voice is both yours and mine at once and he speaks unto me why do you not look at me neither yesterday nor today and so I removed my dirty work hat and look upon him and study his countenance now I was wonder if God is a man or a woman or black or white or yellow but I'm here to tell you that none of this silly stuff matters he's a white guy by the way it's really really a funny book I mean you just have to get into the kind of the fact that it's pure irony like nothing in it is serious and it's it but he tells the story and I just think he has a he has a unique point of view he's kind of like fallen off the radar but I think he's just four he's one of those guys who was it for a select number of people who get it I suspect if you were listening to the show you are one of those people so you should get based on a true story get the audible version if you can by Norm Macdonald it really is hilarious
