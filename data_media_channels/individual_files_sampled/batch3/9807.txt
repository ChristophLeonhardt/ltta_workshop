ISRAELI JETS STRUCK AT IRANIAN TARGETS INSIDE OF SYRIA. Bret: THANK YOU. PRESIDENT TRUMP APPEARS TO HAVE A BANNER DAY AFTER ONE OF THE CLOSEST ALLIES LAID OUT EVIDENCE AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SAYS ABOUT THE NUCLEAR DEAL. AND ANOTHER LEADER SAID PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE FOR THE DEVELOPMENTS IN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP INSISTED THAT IRAN IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE JCBA. AND THAT IS WHY DESPITE LOUD CRITICISM HE DECERTIFIED IT AND DESPITE THE U.N. AND JAMES MATTIS CERTIFIED THAT IRAN IS IN COMPLIANCE. SPEAK NOTHING THE ROSE GARDEN WITH THE PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE EVIDENCE REVEALED BY ISRAEL. I TOLD YOU SO. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THEY ARE NOT SITTING BACK IDLY. AND THEY SET OFF MISSILES FOR TELEVISION PURPOSES. I DON'T KNOWING SO. Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP FACES A MAY 12TH WAIVER. I AM NOT TELLING YOU WHAT I AM DOING. PEOPLE THINK THEY KNOW. WE'LL MAKE A DECISION. Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP INDICATED HE MAY BE OPEN TO LEAVING THE NUCLEAR DEAL IN PLACE IF THE U.S. AND ALLIES CAN ADDRESS IRAN'S LONG- TERM BALLISTIC PROGRAM AND DESTABILIZING BEHAVIOR. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND I THINK IF ANYTHING WHAT HAPPEN TODAY AND WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED HAS REALLY SHOWN THAT I WAS 100 PERCENT RIGHT. Reporter: ON NORTH KOREA. TWEETING THAT HIS PENDING SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG-UN SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE DMZ AT THE SAME LOCATION THAT THE KIM AND THE SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT MET. IT IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT. SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE LOOK. AND I THREW IT OUT AS AN IDEA. Reporter: HIS ADVISORS RULED IT OUT ON THE KOREAN PRESIDENT. BUT HE LOVED THE IMAGE OF KIM JONG-UN TO WALK ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT. AND THINKS IT WOULD BE A MORE POWERFUL STATEMENT THAN MEETING IN THE THIRD COUNTRY. I LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE THERE. AND IF THINGS WORK OUT THERE IS A GREAT CELEBRATION TO BE HAD ON THE SITE AND NOT THE THIRD PARTY COUNTRY. AND MORE CONFIDENCE BUILDING STEPS. AND THAT IS ON MAY FIFTH. AND PEYONGCHANG WAS 30 MINUTES EARLIER. A SMALL GESTURE AND ARE ONE SOUTH CORP CORE ATTACHES SIGNIFICANCE. SUCH MEASURES CARRY OUT HIS WILL AND WILL TAKE PLACE IN A FACE PLACE. SOUTH KOREA WILL DISMANTLE THE LOUD SPEAKER SYSTEM THAT HAS BRAUFD CASTED OVER NORTH KOREA. THE SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
