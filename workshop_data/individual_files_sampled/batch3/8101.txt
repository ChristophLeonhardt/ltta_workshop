WE NEED TO OCCUPY EVERY AIRPORT, NEED TO OCCUPY EVERY WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN IF WE DON'T STAND FOR ANYTHING. PAUL: THAT WAS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE ALEXANDRIA OCASIO CORTEZ THIS WEEK CALLING ON ACTIVISTS TO OCCUPY I.C.E. OFFICES. PRIMARY IS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES PULLING THE PARTY LEFT AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER MIDTERMS. LAST WEEKEND CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS DEALT A BLOW TO ANOTHER PARTY ELDER, ENDORSING PROGRESSIVE STATE SENATOR KEVIN DELEON OVER FOUR TERM SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. DELEON BACKS A SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. KARL ROVE SERVED AS DEPUTY CHIEF SO WELCOME, KARL. HOW DIVIDED ARE DEMOCRATS GOING INTO THIS ELECTION? WELL, INCREASINGLY DIVIDED BECAUSE YOU JUST TOUCHED ON A COUPLE OF THEM. WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE PRIMARY SEASON, THAT IN CASES OF RACES WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAD A SHOT TO WIN, THEY THREW IT AWAY BY GOING HARD LEFT. THE KEY EXAMPLE TO ME WAS NEBRASKA TOO. THIS IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC PART OF NEBRASKA. IT IS PART OF THE STATE THAT OBAMA CARRIED, THAT HILARY CLINTON DID WELL IN. THEY HAD A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN UNTIL RECENTLY. HE WAS TRYING TO GET THE DEMOCRAT NOD BACK AGAIN. AND HE'D HAVE A SHOT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. BUT THE DEMOCRATS INSTEAD WENT HARD LEFT WITH A WOMAN NAMED KARA EASTMAN WHO IS IN FAVOR OF MEDICARE FOR ALL, FREE COLLEGE, GUARANTEED JOB WITH A GUARANTEED PAYCHECK, AND IN A MIDWEST DISTRICT LIKE THAT, THAT IS SANE AND SENSIBLE, EVEN A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO FIND THAT TOO MUCH TO GO FOR. PAUL: BUT YOU KNOW, KARL, LOOK, OCASIO CORTEZ IT SEEMS TO ME HAS A POINT AT LEAST ON ONE THING, AND THAT IS ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY AND PASSION. IN 2010, AS YOU KNOW, THE RESPONSE FROM REPUBLICANS TO PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS DRIVEN IN PART BY THAT KIND OF PASSION. VOTERS KNOW THAT TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE THE VETO AUTHORITY. BUT THE DEMOCRATS MAY BE MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO PUT A CHECK ON THAT AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES MAY NOT MATTER AS MUCH. WELL, MAYBE, BUT LOOK, SHE COMES FROM A VERY LIBERAL DISTRICT THAT IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRY. WHEN SHE GOES OUT TO CAMPAIGN AROUND THE COUNTRY, SHE'S GOING TO RAISE QUESTIONS THAT LOCAL CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, IF SHE COMES IN AND CAMPAIGNS FOR COLLIN ALLRED, PEOPLE WILL ASK HIM DO YOU AGREE WITH HER THAT ISRAEL IS CONDUCTING AN ILLEGAL OCCUPATION OF PALESTINE? ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF FREE JOBS, ARE YOU A DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST? SOME OF THAT STUFF WILL WORK WELL IF YOU ARE IN, YOU KNOW, TO WIN A LOT OF SEATS IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, ILLINOIS AND TEXAS AND THE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T LIKE HOW THEY VOTED IN THE BAY AREA. PAUL: KARL, THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU DON'T INVITE CORTEZ OR WARREN IN THOSE DISTRICTS YOU INVITE BILL CLINTON OR SOMEBODY WHO IS MORE POPULAR IN THOSE DISTRICTS. SURE, BUT LOOK THIS IS A SENTIMENT THAT IS GRABBING THAT IS GAINING STRENGTH INSIDE ROCK STAR NAMED ROBERT FRANCIS FOR THE U.S. SENATE AGAINST TED BUT HE CAME OUT THIS WEEK IN IT MAY BE POPULAR IN THE STATE LIKE TEXAS. TAKE PENNSYLVANIA, THIS IS A DISTRICT HELD BY A REPUBLICAN, WON BY HILARY CLINTON, THEY NOMINATE THE MOST LEFT WING GUY RUNNING IN THE PRIMARY TURNS OUT TO CONTRIBUTED $300,000 TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT DISINVESTMENT IN ISRAEL AND IT IS THE DISTRICT HAS THE 38TH HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF CONCENTRATION OF JEWISH VOTERS OF ANY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY. SO YEAH, LOOK, IT MATTERS THAT YOU STAND FOR SOMETHING. BUT IF WHAT YOU STAND FOR SOMETHING IS HARD LEFT POLITICS, AND YOU'RE RUNNING IN SORT OF MIDDLE AMERICA, THEN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS NOT GOING TO WIN AS MANY SEATS AS IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE WON. PAUL: ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS IS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE OUTPERFORMED WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD EXPECTATIONS FOR VOTER TURNOUT. THAT'S GENERATED BY ENTHUSIASM. A LOT OF IS WE SAW THIS IN VIRGINIA IN PARTICULAR IS ANTITRUMP ENTHUSIASM. WHY ISN'T THE BEST DEMOCRATIC ARGUMENT WERE TO BE SIMPLY SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WE ARE GOING TO PUT A CHECK ON PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE CHECK ON TRUMP. CANDIDATES ARE DEFINING THEIR AGENDA BY ADOPTING LEFT WING POSITIONS, MEDICARE FOR ALL, FREE COLLEGE, GUARANTEED JOBS AND SO FORTH. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. IF THEY RAN A SORT OF CENTRIST, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO WORK RELATIVELY MODERATE CENTRIST LIBERAL DEMOCRATS, WE'RE NOT NUTS CALLING FOR IMPEACHMENT. WE'RE NOT CALLING FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT. THEY COULD WIN A LOT OF SEATS, BUT THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF CANDIDATES THEY ARE NOMINATING IN SOME CRITICAL RACES. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IF THEY WERE SMART, THAT'S WHAT THEY WOULD DO. TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR OLD STOMPING GROUNDS, WISCONSIN, A LEFT WINGER RUNNING IN WISCONSIN WON. IT TURNS OUT TO NOT ONLY BE LEFT WING BUT TURNS OUT TO BE A DEADBEAT WHO COULDN'T EITHER PAY BACK LOANS TO HIS FORMER WIFE OR THE MOST LEFT WING.
