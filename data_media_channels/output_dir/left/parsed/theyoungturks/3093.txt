THE PARLIAMENT IN AUSTRALIA HAS
OFFICIALLY VOTEDON
LEGALIZING GAY MARRIAGE IT CAME
THREE WEEKS AFTER A NATIONAL
REFERENDUM SHOWED STRONG PUBLIC
SUPPORT FOR GAY MARRIAGE.
THE REFERENDUM INDICATED THAT
61% OF THE VOTERS WERE IN FAVOR
OF LEGALIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE
BUT IT WAS NONBINDING.
LUCKILY THEY DID TAKE ACTION AND
VOTE IN THE BEST INTEREST
TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF
AUSTRALIA AND WHAT THEY WANTED.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS BUT THERE WAS
ALSO ANOTHER COMPONENT TO THE
STORY THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THAT
WE DIDN'T GET TO.
I THOUGHT NOW WOULD BE A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.
TIM WILSON WHO IS A MEMBER OF
PARLIAMENT DECIDED TO DO
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WHILE
TALKING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> THIS DEBATE HAS BEEN THE
SOUNDTRACK TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.
WE BOTH KNOW THIS ISSUE ISN'T
THE REASON WE GOT INVOLVED IN
POLITICS.
GIVE US TAX REFORM ANY DAY.
BUT IN MY FIRST SPEECH I DEFINED
OUR BOND BY THE RING THAT SITS
ON BOTH OF OUR LEFT HANDS.
SO THERE'S ONLY ONE THING LEFT
TO DO, RYAN WILL YOU MARRY ME?
>> I LIKE IT.
>> THAT IS WONDERFUL.
IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WE HAVE
TO FIGHT TO JUST GET PEOPLE TO
RECOGNIZE THAT GAY HUMAN BEINGS
SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME
WAY AS STRAIGHT ONES.
IS NOT THAT HARD TO ASK.
WE ARE ALL PEOPLE, WE ARE ALL
THE SAME.
THESE ARE DEMOCRACIES YET WE
STILL STRUGGLE FOR THE BARE
MINIMUM.
ON A DAY LIKE TODAY WE REALLY
SHOULD TAKE A MOMENT TO
CELEBRATE.
THEY 
ALWAYS WORN ON FOX NEWS
THAT WE ARE WINNING THE
CULTURE WARS.
THEY ARE RIGHT.
OUR SIDE SAYS THAT ALL HUMAN
BEINGS ARE EQUAL, THEY SAY
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
FOR GAY PEOPLE THEY ARE
DEFINITELY A LOWER CATEGORY.
61% IN AUSTRALIA AND SO MANY
OTHER PLACES YES WITH THE HELP
OF THE INTERNET AND OUR
INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND KNOWLEDGE
AND TRUTH AND INFORMATION PEOPLE
ARE LOOKING AROUND AND GOING
WAIT A MINUTE THEY KEEP SAYING
THAT BEING GAY IS UNNATURAL.
THEN WHY ARE THERE SO MANY GAY
HUMANS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
PERHAPS SOME OF OUR ANCIENT
HATREDS ARE IN FACT ANCIENT
AND MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL TODAY.
YES WHERE WINNING WHEN A DAY
LIKE TODAY WHEN AUSTRALIA PASSES
THIS I AM THRILLED AND PROUD TO
BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY
AND I'M SO HAPPY FOR THE LGBT
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN
AUSTRALIA AND I HOPE WE WENT ALL
ACROSS THE WORLD AND CRUSH THE
DEMAGOGUES ON THE RIGHT WHEN
THEY TRY TO DENY EQUAL
RIGHTS TO OUR FELLOW HUMAN
BEINGS.
>> OF COURSE I'M HAPPY THERE
IS MORE EQUALITY FOR GAY
COUPLES LIVING IN AUSTRALIA.
FOR ME THERE IS A BROADER POINT
TO THIS STORY THAT I THINK
GOES TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.
IS FRUSTRATING THAT YOU HAVE TO
FIGHT SO HARD FOR THINGS
THAT SHOULD NOT BE HARD TO FIGHT
FOR.
THEY SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE LIKE
EQUALITY.
RIGHT NOW IN THE UNITED STATES
WE ARE DEALING WITH A VERY
TUMULTUOUS TIME, A LOT OF
DESPAIR, PEOPLE FEELING THAT
FIGHTING IS LEADING 
TO NOTHING.
THAT IS AMAZING TO ME BECAUSE
THAT TELLS ME YOU HAVE TO KEEP
FIGHTING REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE
ISSUE IS THAT YOU ARE MOST
PASSIONATE ABOUT, KEEP FIGHTING.
>> PEOPLE THINK OFTENTIMES IT IS
NOT REALISTIC.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
OPTIMISM IS WARRANTED.
WE WON ON THE ISSUE OF SLAVERY
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
NOW WE ARE WINNING ON THE ISSUE
OF GAY RIGHTS.
WE NEVER WOULD'VE ONE IF WE HAD
ACTUALLY CHANGE PEOPLE'S
MINDS AND CHANGE THE CULTURE.
BUT WE HAVE THROUGH FIGHTING AND
BEING RIGHT.
61% OF PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA SAID
YES, OUR FELLOW BROTHERS
AND SISTERS WHO ARE GAY ARE JUST
AS HUMAN AS US.
NOW IT'S TICKET TO 
EVERY SINGLE
COUNTRY ON 
THE PLANET.
