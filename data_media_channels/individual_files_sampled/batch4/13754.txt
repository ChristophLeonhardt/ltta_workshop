it's been on my mind a lot recently I'm about to head out to New York I'm gonna be there getting ready for my wedding I've got my bachelor party coming up this weekend so if you don't see me next week or any other time in the future you know I'm sorry I had too much fun at my bachelor party not a bad way to go at but I'm thinking about the future a lot and have you noticed this I have actually noticed this over the past nine months Donald Trump has this weird ability to predict the future or at least it seems like he's predicting the future and it's much more pronounced because all of his opponents have a total lack of ability to predict the future in fact all of their predictions do not come true they make these totally insane predictions these we're certain it's definitely going to happen Trump can't win 99% sure no there's gonna and then none of them come true and what Trump says which we all say is crazy at the time that seems to happen here's just a little reminder from Nancy Pelosi Democrats talk about the Spill often in very apocalyptic terms but isn't really what's going on is that many people are getting a very modest tax cut and some people are getting a tax increase while a lot of this is also going to business but it's not the end of the world no it is the end of this healthcare the debate on health care is life death this is Armageddon this is a very big deal no this is Armageddon no this is no let me do it is the end of the world I don't want to so that was Nancy Pelosi and okay so now we've lived through it because the trouble with predictions this happens in political predictions and in sports predictions is these guys they go on TV Nancy Pelosi gets up there in front of the cameras and they make their predictions and then they don't come true and then we keep listening to them for some reason so we got you know Nancy Pelosi says this is Armageddon and yet we still listen to her we still believe her we still give her the floor and it isn't just Nancy Pelosi Paul Krugman predicted that the markets would plunge if Trump won the election what have you said the markets are going to plunge what happened Trump won the election the markets Rose why don't we do we even handle this in sports and sports they say this is no this could never happen then it happens and we keep listening to them the next day there's a Bloomberg headline from 2016 the headline with Citigroup says a Trump victory in November could cause a global recession what happened not only was there not a global recession but the global economy rose in fact the IMF gave credit to Donald Trump for that jump in the global economy okay we still read Bloomberg though we still listen to Citigroup Politico predicted quote Wall Street is set up for a major crash if Donald Trump shocks the world on election day and wins the White House major crash' just didn't happen and they weren't set up for a major crash because the markets rose MIT Romney MIT Rosso it's not just these crazy lefties MIT's MIT Romney who's at least nominally a Republican I know he invented Obamacare and he spends most of his time criticizing the effective conservative Republican president but you know he's nominally at least a Republican he said Donald Trump's domestic policies would lead to recession what's happened we've we've had one of the greatest bull market runs in history that happened last year none of the experts predicted it but that's exactly what happened six trillion dollars worth of wealth created particularly for the 55 million Americans with 401k plans the the other 25 million Americans who have IRAs 20 million who have company pensions stock ownership plans and for virtually everybody else because of tax reform so even if you're not among the many many many millions of people who have some stake in the market first of all you do because the you're in the economy but also because of tax reform everybody is rising the median a household income rose pretty significantly within the last year that's the median household income that just reported very recently we were told by Donald Trump's economists and by Donald Trump himself we'll we won't see 3 percent economic growth anymore those are the old days now we have the new normal it can't happen what happened under Donald Trump we got we saw greater than 3% economic growth and it isn't just on these election predictions Donald Trump came out and said that ms-13 they're animals that that awful gang that kills children rapes people there their motto is something like kill rape control so maybe there's some other permutation of those three but that's their motto right I said those guys are animals and the left said they're not animals there people have dare you they start defending ms-13 not one week later an ms-13 member named animal is sentenced to 40 years in a federal prison for murdering a 15 year old boy this seems a little weird doesn't it yes I think the whole thing is about animal and then not a week later the guys name is animal that's his street name and he goes to prison for 40 years you saw this Donald Trump was talking about during the campaign the building a border wall and all those awful criminals coming over from the Mexican side of the the US border and they said how you couldn't what are you talking about there's no crime there's no crime and then the k-t Steinle incident erupted right after that he seems to just be able to predict one step ahead see exactly what's happening right in the future in 2013 Donald Trump tweeted out what Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone next will be lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is he a crook he's worse than Spitzer or Weiner so he tweets that and I don't know people say what's new Schneiderman who care what are we worried about Schneiderman just five years later this happened a couple weeks ago Eric Schneiderman was forced to resign within hours after allegations came out from multiple women that he abused them sexually in the throes of sex he got drunk and was battering them and hitting them this is a guy he was a full-throated me too supporter right nobody could have expected who could have predicted this wonderful feminist this great Democrat politician in New York was actually beating women against their will when he got a little too drunk in New York who predicted it Donald Trump did how on earth does president cough fa the voice of one tweeting in the wilderness how does he predict all of these things go back even further don't even worry about 2013 1987 Donald Trump took out a full-page ad in The New York Times it said there's nothing wrong with America's foreign defense policy that a little backbone Cure now it seemed like he was taking a shot at the Reagan administration here and you got to say we did win the Cold War so I don't know that's if that is exactly the best way to read that but the statement taken on its own is true there's nothing wrong with a little with America's foreign policy that a little backbone can't cure and we look around and we see that in action he did this to Iran he did this to Korea and experts have lost their minds when he said to North Korea a little rocket man is short and fat and I've got a button on my desk with nuclear weapons and mine works when he said that the experts lost their mind they said he's belligerent he's bellicose he's gonna throw us into World War 3 if he rips up the Iran deal we're gonna go into World War 3 it's certain to happen I have a PhD and I wear a tie and my glasses are horn room you have to believe me it's gonna cause the end of the world here you just see a little bit from what the mainstream media said when he did all of those things the most important political news of the weekend and today also happens to be the most important news in the world because it's about nothing less than World War three and this news doesn't come from some conspiracy theory website this news comes from the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Republican senator bob Corker senator corker shocked Washington yesterday by saying what virtually everyone in Washington was thinking which is always always the best way to shock Washington by saying something that everyone is thinking but not saying I can't I don't even know where to begin with how wrong that is but just to begin just first nobody in Washington has ever thought anything without saying it the most dangerous place on planet earth is between Washington politicians and a TV camera none of them are having these grand thoughts and not saying them they're Craven they're crass and their publicity hounds so that's to begin most people in DC say things without thinking at all that does happen people will say things without thinking about them they won't think things without saying but everybody is thinking this everybody's that look everybody is saying and that just take lawrence O'Donnell his own points everybody's saying that we're going to have World War three everybody's thinking at all of the smart people all the people in ties who have really strong jaws and comb their hair the right way and that you know they wear ties on camera they're all and they go on TV sometimes they're all saying it so it has to be true except that they're all wrong except it turned out they're all wrong we will get to even more of this in one second before that though visit this ties in beautifully actually because sometimes we need to get advice we need to get advice from people who actually know what they're talking about not people who pretend to know what they're talking about people who actually know what they're talking about when you're dealing with a real head-scratcher having your go to

consulted their own empty brains you know their own just rattling around in their heads so they got that wrong how about let's pull it back forward to 2018 just this Russia investigation all of the nonsense and the lies and the fake news and the bad predictions how many times have you turned into the news you've tuned in and they've said this is it for Trump now we got him now now we got him weep Michael Flynn had lunch he had borscht for lunch so now we got Trump you know stormy Daniels a porn store a currently working porn star who has admitted to lying publicly in official documents and has been a Democrat operative for years and tried to run for the Senate as a Democrat and is an acknowledged and admitted public liar stormy Daniel says something they got Trump they got him now they've got him now and then the betting they never have Trump do you notice that they always say that we're gonna get him and then it never happens does it uh and on all of this it seems that Donald Trump has been right the whole time Donald Trump has been right the whole time Obama and his bureaucratic Crohn's have been caught lying multiple times Donald Trump said that Barack Obama wiretapped his campaign and I'd like to eat okay so he said we've been wiretapped when he tweeted it he used quotation marks wiretapped the importance of this is that it shows as Donald Trump usually does when he speaks he can speak using metonym or synecdoche or many literary devices that perhaps he's unaware he's using but he even used that phrase because I don't think Donald Trump was alleging that Barack Obama personally went into Trump Tower and installed a little device on his actual telephone right nobody thinks that that's what Donald Trump was saying but all of the people who want to prove Trump wrong even though Trump was right they say well he didn't wiretap him said right well Donald Trump also said Obama did it does anyone doesn't even think Donald Trump actually alleged Barack Obama broke into Trump Tower no he's speaking metaphorically and using metonym z' and the Obama administration did surveil his campaign they didn't just surveil some aides although they did surveil aides but they surveilled the head of his campaign that the chairman of his campaign this is what we heard when this came out this is from the FBI quote with respect to the president's tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration I have no information that supports those tweets and we have looked carefully inside the FBI the Department of Justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the Department of Justice and all its components the department has no information that supports those tweets that's what we heard right except that's not true we later learned that Barack Obama was directly surveillance administration was directly surveilling the Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and likely picked up the calls of the President himself how about now cuz the big story in the news is the deep State gunning for Trump and what does this mean does this mean that there's some guy with a mustache twirling his mustache around sitting at the FBI some regular agent who's doing his job and just trying to protect the country of course not that's not what that means but what it does mean is there is bureaucratic creep here there is political creep we know that Barack Obama weaponized the federal government and the bureaucracy to attack his political opponents I'm a member of an organization that was the victim of this oh so is it really so crazy to suggest that there was a White House influence on the FBI in these investigations as a matter of fact we know from the leaked Peter struck texts that the White House was running the investigation right that was one now if even if that's contradicted later we have that coming out that the White House is influencing these investigations we went through the timeline a bit yesterday The Wall Street Journal lays it out very well the FBI claims that they didn't open up the probe into donald trump and russia collusion or whatever until july 31st 2016 now that was the claim and donald trump came and he said BS i don't believe it all the smart people said you have to believe the FBI come on you have to believe you can't believe Donald Trump he's a crazy guy so then the New York Times reports on Friday the FBI's top secret informant Steven Halper met with Donald Trump aide quarter-page only after a July 31st launch of the probe see keeps the FBI's timeline see it keeps the Obama administration timeline the Washington Post went further in their flacking they said nah hopper and Paige didn't meet until August 31st until early September they didn't know well into that probe now quarter-page says something different Carter Paige says that he met with the FBI informant helper in mid-july early to mid July and we know this actually happened because it occurred at a very public symposium at Cambridge University in the UK Paige further says that he was invited to that symposium at the end of May end of May or early June ok now I know that this is one reason by the way why people aren't talking about this too extensively on the news is it's kind of hard to wrap your head around there are so many moving parts when you get into nefarious politics that's what happens but Halper the FBI informant was a central figure in that symposium the quarter Paige was invited to the symposium was titled 2016 s race to change the world another central figure at that symposium was Sir Richard Dearlove who spent four decades working for British intelligence mi6 he was the chief of mi6 from 1999 to 2004 so we've got an FBI informant who worked in for the federal government and for the intelligence agencies for decades we then have a British intelligence agent who'd worked for decades that means that dear love by the way worked with Christopher Steele who ran the Russia desk for mi6 and compiled the famous dossier that was funded by Hillary Clinton and by the Democrats whoa that's a lot of coincidences so they all just coincidentally just hate coincidentally they all invited this Trump campaign aide to this symposium before the Russia probe allegedly began into Donald Trump and it's just a coincidence probably right it's just a that look sometimes decades-long intelligence officers for multiple countries sometimes they just invite members of political campaigns who they're surveilling to you know to academic conferences in who knows and then coincidentally two months later they start surveilling him right that's just what happens I don't know about that now does this mean for sure that Barack Obama was sitting there saying we're gonna spy on Trump we're gonna kill him we're gonna kill him no doesn't mean that for sure we don't want to jump the gun we want to be serious here doesn't mean we should investigate yeah I think we probably should investigate I think that's probably a good idea because now the left is denying it and Scott Adams summed it up perfectly you had a great tweet on all of this he tweeted out quote four things to understand about Spygate that's what they're calling it number one there was no spy in the Trump campaign number two the spying that did not happen was totally justified number three it would be bad for national security to identify the spy who doesn't exist number four the spies name is stephane some of those seem to you sure that that's basically the argument from the left now it's really hard to believe we'll see where that investigation goes I will just say though all the people who go on TV with the ties and we win with the sharp we know with my glasses basically there's Rachel Maddow they go on and they give the expert opinion they've been wrong the whole time not only have they been wrong we know that they've lied publicly we know that they've lied on the record we know that people from the administration the Obama administration of lied Donald Trump has a pretty good track record here I don't know I don't know which side I'd lean toward if I were a gambling man which I am and I have the check from Ben to prove it probably put my bets on president Koch that they and this will get back so we have to answer this question how why is it that Donald Trump a gigantic reality TV star casino real estate mogul wins the presidency on his first try how did that guy why is he a prophet why Adam that guy can predict the future but all of the experts with PhDs can't predict the future it all goes back well it goes back further than this but it certainly goes back to the 2011 Comedy Central Roast of Donald Trump this is sort of a long clip but it's really important and people haven't dug this one up in a while the thing is so rich with clues as to why Trump has succeeded in politics here it is of the atrocities that we as a nation must endure like the Jersey Shore a piece of advice my greasy friend you don't need to put all of that product in your hair you just don't look how great my hair looks and I don't use anything and it looks very good what's the difference between a wet raccoon and Donald J Trump's hair a wet raccoon doesn't have 7 billion dollars in the bag very funny very funny America is going through tough times and we all need to laugh true I know that better days are ahead if we believe in ourselves and the way I believe in myself and I really do believe in myself then come June if I decide to run you'll have the great pleasure of voting for the man that will easily go down as the greatest president in the history of the United States me Donald John Trump god bless america and good night there is so much you there there this was not in 2015 even this was not before this look recent run this was in 2011 this isn't because he was considering running in 2012 and I actually just remembered this he said in some interview might have been as part of this roast he said at the time he said you know if I choose to run for president I'm gonna do a lot better and all you people think I'm gonna do and we all you know we all laughed at him at the time that thought President Donald Trump that was a joke right it was a joke in movies people joked about it as a punchline and there's so much here there's so much political skill and that's I think why he seems like he can predict the future you know he's having fun he's joking around with the celebrities who were on the dais there are a lot of celebrities on the dais there's Snoop Dogg the family guy guy Seth MacFarlane Lisa Lampanelli a ton of people the Jersey Shore guy Mike the situation and he's there and he's joking around and they're joking around with him because in those days it was okay to joke around with Donald Trump it wasn't you know now you're not allowed to if you're a Hollywood celebrity now you have to pretend you hate him but you know until five minutes ago all of Hollywood loved this guy he was a king of Hollywood so he goes out there and some good lines you had a line about Snoop Dogg he said some nuke dog is a do rags to riches story yeah line about Lisa Lampanelli she's a comedian who's old joke about her is that she's not the not the most spell to last in the world who know she is not terribly thin and so people make fat jokes about her and she loved it she's laughing clapping you know that was all nice he's making jokes about the other people have their basic cable hacks you know talentless people and he's this big star also true in some ways about certain people up there and but what we see here is he jokes about himself easily he jokes about you know people say that he can't joke about himself Donald Trump can't take a joke that isn't true at all they say Donald Trump is a narcissist you know like like Barack Obama's a narcissist no way no way I mean does Donald Trump have an ego yeah Trump has an ego I don't think anyway he's denying that but is he narcissist no and here's the difference an egotist hard-charging puts his name on building says his name a lot gets it out there pushes back won't you know won't take the hits he's gonna go he's gonna punch right if he if he takes a joke he's gonna give that joke right back what the narcissist does is he takes it so personally with Donald Trump I don't think it's personal I don't think he takes I don't think he goes home and cries he says well he didn't like me or he gets really angry says though they didn't they I'm gonna get him back oh man no I don't think it's that at all I think he has a great ability to compartmentalize to abstract himself from situations and that's why he has some pretty cold thinking because it can't be both right he can't be coldly strategic and this angry narcissist Barack Obama seems like a narcissist I mean he wrote two books about his favorite subject by the time he was in his 20s or something like that or I think the second memoir came in is 30s that there is a certain narcissism there it's the difference I suppose is that Donald Trump writes his own press releases and Barack Obama believes his own press releases and those are two different things you can even see it you see it in the way that Donald Trump talks so he leans into the money thing he's always talking about how much money he has you know the difference is the hair the the wet raccoon or whatever he says isn't worth seven billion dollars but he pushes you past the sale when he talks he says if I run you will have the pleasure of voting for the greatest president in the history of the United States and what he does this is another thing Scott Adam says as mentioned though not on this particular point just the category Donald Trump pushes you past the sale so instead of saying I'm gonna win the presidency okay he said that you say no you won't but he says I will be not only will I be the president I will be the greatest president not just in the recent years I will be the greatest president in the history of the country not only that you will have the you will have pleasure voting for me it will be a pleasure to vote for me and the reason you do this it's the same reason Trump talks about the wall and he says Mexico is gonna pay for the wall he says it not because Mexico is gonna pay for the wall who cares if Mexico pays for the wall it's not that expensive what he's doing is he's establishing in your mind that the wall will be built the wall is going to be built and so that's not up for debate all that's up for debate is who's gonna pay for it I will be the president that's not up for debate all that's up for debate is will I be the greatest president in American history or just the greatest president in the last twenty years or something right that's what he's pushed I will be the president the only question is are you gonna have pleasure voting for me or great pleasure voting for me right he does this it's a really strong tactic of his and by the way he did better at this roast than most of the other performers cuz he's funnier because he's more in the culture the other guys were funny I don't mean to denigrate them I'm not I don't wanna be a hack here they are funny people Seth MacFarlane's very funny guy Snoop Dogg actually was pretty funny Mike the situation wasn't you know it's not his strong suit but but a lot of them were funny but Trump was better why because people relate to Trump and because Trump knew his people he talks about this he said one of the secrets to my success is I really know people I'm a people person so I think here we have the answer to our question can Trump actually predict the future as he plugged in to you know the cosmos and the natural order of the universe I don't know about that but why does it seem like he can predict the future it's because he can put his finger on the pulse of the culture he knows people he talks to people he's not isolated he doesn't live in a little bubble in DC he doesn't just go to lunches at the Brookings institution and talk about how sad it is that people don't hold their champagne glass in the right way anymore it's why he's a good salesman I mean he's the greatest salesman in the modern era he is all sales right he sells everything he sold his he sold real estate and he made incredible deals on real estate in New York basically by just tricking the media but you know it's great in that book I just read by Conrad Black Lord Conrad Black Donald J Trump a president like no other we had him on the show this week I guess this week or last week he talks about how when he put the Commodore deal together he just did it by sheer tyranny of will he knows people he knew how the city would react to this how the state the this company would react to this how the media would react to this and he just put it all together and he did it he's totally in the culture so he can shape the culture this is why Andrew Breitbart was right he's if he's in the culture if Donald Trump is in the culture means Donald Trump is in the present most people are living in the past most people are fighting the last war especially in politics people who are living in the past think people who are living in the present or seeing the future most people are fighting the Mitt Romney campaign by the way now people are fighting the 2016 race they're trying to fight the 2016 race in 2020 2020 is gonna be different and you're gonna see this all over again you're gonna see it's gonna look like Donald Trump's predicting the future again it's not cuz he is predicting the future it's because he's living in the present I've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube we have a ton more to get to you cannot miss it very important points look I'm gonna be gone for a week on my honeymoon so I got to give you all the good cough effe now otherwise Ben is gonna just depress everybody and he's gonna say like things aren't that great he doesn't snort nearly as much cofee as I do so you're gonna want you know at least at least you'll have Clavin to say that everything is tickety-boo but we got to get all that cough fao right now if you're on the Le wire comm thank you you helped us keep the lights on you keep Kofi Fae in my cup and I'm gonna bring this cup to the beach on my honeymoon and I'm gonna probably get arrested for that but I need it cuz you're not allowed to drink open containers of cough f/a on the beach that's not a lads against the law you got to put it in the appropriate fda-approved vessel for leftist tiers so what do you get it's $10 a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the end of Clevenger you get the bench up here you can't ask questions in the mailbag as there are questions in the conversation you should get your questions in for this final no not final I have one more before my wedding but penultimate pre-wedding mailbag I'm probably gonna be asking you questions that's what I really need you won't get this because none of that other stuff matters this matters the leftist tears tumblr because every time Nostra Donald predicts the future every time our great prophet the one tweeting out in the wilderness predicts the future the tears are going to flow and you're going to need this vessel go to daily wire calm we'll be right back all right we're back and I'm glad I'm kind of glad we put this one behind the paywall because I have to criticize Bill Kristol and I really like Bill Kristol personally yeah bill kristol was a professor of mine for a summer in DC and I like him very much person he's a very nice guy these tweets though these you know I've held off long enough these tweets bill kristol tweeted the other day said quote one striking contrast between reagan and trump reagan's conservatism was a youthful movement in spirit and often in fact fueled by hopefulness for the future Trump's conservatism is a reactionary movement of older Americans fueled by anger and fear you know I've always been an old soul I guess I guess I've always been an old so Kanye West maybe is very old too maybe Kandice oh and mr. Charlie Kirk or they all hold all that all of the YouTube people who are they all really old is that it I don't think so I don't think that's true at all in fact I think the oldest trump supporter I know is Andrew Clavin and he behaves like a younger man than I do you know the the latest I ever stay out when I go out at night is when I'm hanging out with Drew the Trump movement is a youthful movement it's energized and it's exuberant Donald Trump one more Millennials than John McCain or Mitt Romney and Donald Trump did just fine with the Utes you know I worry I fear without descending into psychobabble that Bill Kristol might be projecting here angry old fearful I don't know does that describe Kanye West or does that describe president Trump's detractors Ronald Reagan's movement was youthful that's absolutely true Ronald Reagan's movement happened almost 40 years ago well it really had happened over 40 years ago because it began in the 60s and 70s now the Ronald Reagan movement is older it's older now we need something new Ronald Reagan solved the problems of his time he did his part he kept the faith that's what he said when he said farewell to Americans he said we did it let them say of us we did it we kept the faith we did our part we can't dig up the body of Ronald Reagan and have him become the head of the Republican Party and the present again you can't exhume poor Gipper Gipper did a good job let him rest let him have his eternal reward now we're dealing with something new we're dealing with something new and a reactionary movement of older Americans fueled by anger and fear oppose him but that's that's no legitimate reason the the remaining antitrump right is living in a fantasy world one because it barely exists anymore of all of the the more prominent Trump critics on the right we had been was one during the campaign certainly he was always the most reasonable about this it kills me to be too complimentary toward the big boss on the show but he was always the most reasonable he put that Magga hat on the day that Trump nominated Gorsuch right he wore that maggot but even some of the holdouts the people who have still just really were constantly negative toward Trump Jonah Goldberg said the other day that he would vote for Donald Trump that was pretty good and look there's news out today that I don't even want to tell you about I actually do I've tried to avoid talking about this on the show because I don't want to jinx us I don't want to jinx November bloomberg is reporting that the blue wave may be dissipating the headline today is Democrats prep for battle not surfing a blue wave remember though all those really smart guys in suits with glasses on TV and they go on TV so you know you have to believe them all those guys told us it was gonna be a blue wave of Republicans we're gonna lose the house and the Senate and and Donald Trump was gonna be kicked out of office and what are we seeing now we're seeing maybe there are some cracks now I don't want to tell you don't tell anybody I know that only the most you know the the fringe East most extreme people of the vast right-wing conspiracy tune in here so I feel like I can tell you guys but don't tell anybody else historically speaking we should lose this election in November the Republicans should lose the house if not the Senate also I don't know if that's what we see on the ground I don't know if that's what we see on the culture because everything's getting better I don't tell them that because conservatives have to go out for us to win it so don't tell anybody but I dare I say I'm hopeful things are looking good right now so you know that's not an excuse to to go ahead and do battle in November but things are looking so good even Glenn Beck was a big he was a big anti-trump he was a trump critic for a long time I love Glenn Beck Glenn Beck this is such a beautiful day he came around here's the video enjoy here's why I'm predicting a 2020 win when I saw yesterday the how the press was all reporting the same damn story that Donald Trump was calling ms-13 gang members they left that out of the story animals and they were spinning it as if he was saying that about all immigrants I'd had enough I have enough media if you can get me Glenn back to do this there it is and in case you're only listening to us on radio I just donned a red make America great again if you can drive me to the point to where I say you know what I've had enough I'll vote for him in 2020 gladly I'll vote for him in 2020 and not really even on his record which we'll talk about here in a second is pretty damn amazing pretty damn amazing yes that is that video is pretty damn amazing I love it I love it because it where is it the anti-trump right is basically just gone now it's basically over save for a few tweets the remaining anti Trump stuff on the right and and even largely on the left it comes from fantasy and this is the cultural side of things we have to get to this in the last five minutes here a spell has been broken the cultural hypnosis has cracked to use the phrase of Kanye West the consciousness has shifted here's an example Kendrick Lamar Kendrick Lamar is some popular musician I take it I'm using those words loosely he invited a white fan on stage at one of his concerts he asked her to sing his song then he decided to publicly shame her for singing the lyrics which he wrote here's the clip lady she's there when we started it's it is painful to watch cuz it was obviously a setup I mean it's just ridiculous do you see she goes she's having fun she thinks she's still in it right in she goes I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't know I'm sorry I didn't mean to be so disrespectful to his fans he put the words in the song it's like every third word in his songs by the way he won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature he won the Pulitzer Prize I just that's that's what happened in recent years that's what's happened to our culture that's a sidebar Hey it's outrageous it's ridiculous you look up there and you see you just feel so bad for her he invites her onstage he says sing the lyrics that I wrote and then she sings the lyrics that he wrote and then he calls her a racist basically and publicly shame sir so so wrong even Whoopi Goldberg agrees on this by the way Whoopi Goldberg on the view and I don't look to the view for wisdom but Whoopi Goldberg on the view said that's ridiculous was wrong for him to do it he shouldn't have done it and you know what most people agree with her and with that opinion there are two explanations that we could believe for why and how that woman sang the the n-word in this song here's one explanation this is this is crazy as my conspiracy theory that he wrote the lyrics and asked her to sing them yeah that's my crazy conspiracy theory the other one is that she hates black people it's got to be that right but nobody actually thinks that nobody thinks that this woman has Animists for black people and that's why he's getting that flack I you know the it's really really ridiculous we have so many so little racial animus today that we have to invent it we actually get there's so little racial animus that we just have to make it up at a pole cloth it's just a fantasy this ties in with our theme of Trump predicting everything because the NFL has now banned kneeling for the flag in the national anthem this was another one you know people were doing it and they were they were banning the flag or that they were kneeling for the flag and they were saying because racism is so awful in America we're going to disrespect the American flag so there's a lot to deal with there there's al I don't know if I agree with this or that or that that's crazy but you certainly wouldn't disrespect the flag which gives you the right to protest which gives you the right to self-government so NFL now has banned kneeling for the flag by the way it was already banned in the game operations manual which existed long before this hullabaloo the game operations manual for the NFL read the national anthem must be played prior to every NFL game and all players must be on the sidelines for the national anthem during the national anthem players on the field and bench area should stand at attention face the flag hold helmets in their left hand refrain from talking the home team should ensure the flag is in good condition it should be pointed out to players and coaches we continue to be judged by the public in this area of respect for the flag and our country failure to be on the field by the start of the anthem may result in disciplines such as fine suspensions and forfeiture of draft choice for violations of the above including the first offense it was announced today teams will be fined by the league if players go on the field and kneel now they're letting them stay in the locker room if they really want to but if they go and kneel they'll be fined by the league this is all this isn't about the great patriotism of the NFL I don't know that they care at all about the country this is about money and this is about reality and Donald Trump there's a lot about both of those things and brags have betted a lot you know the the kneeling thing started a couple years ago it really took off last year what happened the NFL ratings tanked the 2017 audience was almost 10 percent down over the 2016 season Trump brought the issue to a head why because he's nostra Donald or because he's living in the present he sees what's happening in the culture he was really strong on this issue so now but in our last couple minutes here I'm gonna get to some predictions for the future that don't involve Trump or NFL players or Kendrick Lamar or Nancy Pelosi or any of that these are predictions that we're seeing over in Ireland they've been big news items on Friday Ireland is gonna vote on a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment to ban abortion Ireland is a strong Catholic country it's got some of the strictest abortion laws in the world and there's a vote now to possibly ban it now by the way if you want an abortion in Ireland you just go to England and you get one and that's that's what people do but it's a strong Catholic country this is being called the end of Catholicism in that country the poles are too close to call it's we're not really sure there's been momentum on the side of pro-life hopefully pro-life will eat get out but to call it the end of Catholicism is a little crazy I was talking with our colleague here Paul Cardinal Bois about this earlier Ireland rejected its strict Catholicism a few years ago when it voted to redefine marriage to redefine marriage to include same-sex gay unions and so that's a question whereas Ireland going what is Ireland is it a Catholic country is it something new this brings us to the Pope the big headline this week as the Pope is okay with being gay or something I was with the popular media were reporting because he told a victim of Chilean sexual abuse Juan Carlos Cruz that God loves him this was reported by the media as the Pope says it's totally cool to do a lot of gay stuff now Pope loves gay sex beibei's was the headline and it's a little more nuanced than that they thought it was shocking that the Pope would tell a gay man that God loves him as though this were breaking with Catholic tradition as though previously the Catholic doctrine was God hates gay people when that has never been that has never once been the Catholic dogma or a doctrine at all God loves you God loves you if you're if you have any sort of assortment of proclivities in your mind God still loves you you know the old man has fallen people do many worse things then wink at the cute fella down the bar you know there's a deception and fraud and all of this God still loves you just don't want you to turn to him and do the right thing the culture is very confused and so where's the prediction coming where's the living in the present to seem like we're predicting the future the Catholic Church will either hold true to its divine institution to it to the Gospels to the sacred tradition or it would fade away that's it it won't it won't become some sort of Protestant Church and it won't like so many mainline churches here won't say okay but now we're gonna change this piece of 2000 year old doctrine no it'll defend its doctrine and its truth or it will disappear Ireland will be Ireland it we'll be Catholic Ireland the land you know the beautiful old Ireland or Ireland will cease to exist and something new will happen but Ireland will be Ireland or will cease to exist the cultural argument of all of trumps talk about globalism and nationalism that this is what that gets to this is what it all is but think of the brexit Britain will be Britain or there won't be a Britain there will be said there will just be a big blobby EU Britain will be Britain or there won't be a Britain Americans will salute our flag and defend our country or they won't have a country we won't have a country Trump said this on the trail he said we will we either have a country or we don't have a country Irving Kristol said this in 93 a quitter Irving Kristol bill Crystal's father said conservative thought is religion nationalism and economic growth the foundations of civilization religion nationalism and of course economic growth it has to grow it has to advance or it'll wither away and die the foundations of civilization are worth conserving those are the sure predictions those are the only sure I'm not as good as Nostra Donald so I know that's all I can predict for sure we will defend our countries in our faiths or we won't have any countries or faiths to defend that's it I'll leave it to the other prophets who tweet out in the wilderness to predict which one that will be but it is up to us and for that I am hopeful okay and I know you know I get all I'm thinking about the future a lot these days folks send in your questions to the mailbag we will be back tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show I'll see you them the
