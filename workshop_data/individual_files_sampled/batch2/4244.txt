there's a new national moneth University poll that shows just 35% of Americans say the country's on the right track 57% say it's on the wrong track that's a nine-point swing of the negative direction since June we'll get to other parts of the poll in a second but that right track wrong track how important is that as we go into off off off year elections when we're picking who's going to be running the house in the Senate I think right track run track is a very important indicator that in the there's often polling numbers of does this guy or this person this candidate fight for people like you those are the type of polls that I find are a little bit more credible what's astonishing to me is that it can be down at 35 percent when the economy on its surface and in its aggregate numbers is doing so well I'd ask an expert like John Heilemann or somebody have you ever seen right track being 35 percent what unemployment is below 4% and since I think the economic numbers won't always be as good this could really tumble down if there's a if there starts to be any blips in the economy especially from this continued China trade dispute which could you know start bringing down the economy a little bit so Joe since Walter invited me to to comment I will that 35 number will be familiar to you because I've heard you mention it on some occasions over the course the last 18 months it's the number that if you look at all the polling that we've all the polling that we've looked at since Donald Trump has put in office and you had to ask what's the honest assessment of what Trump core basis you'd say as you have many times it's about 35% so we're looking at right track wrong track is as Walter says often a useful thing in polling but what we've learned is that it often essentially tracks not the approval rating of the president but tracks kind of where the president's bases at that kind of no matter what else is going on those are the people who think the country's on the right track they're just with the president 35% that's the Trump base right there you're looking at it those people they don't care about they don't care about the Russia probe they don't care about about what's going on North Korea that I particularly care about NATO that what you care about anything Donald Trump's doing or what we say in the media those the people who think no matter what they're with Donald Trump and if Donald Trump's in office the country's on the right track but a question I have is can you ever chip away at Donald Trump's pure base I mean we all sorts of things have happened in that 35 percent it's like chiseled and marble well you know I don't a lot of times the Democrats don't like me to bring it up but there was about you know 33 35 38 percent that would have said anything about george w bush from 2001 to 2009 so I think that third you know maybe that 33 percent that 35 percent is set hard and will be set hard but at least Jordan when you look at the people that are going to be getting out and voting like I always talk about the women that we had reports that were standing in the rain in Northern Virginia or black voters across what's called the black belt in Alabama during that special election you look at the crosstabs there it's probably much lower for the people who were the most likely to vote this fall the people that are most motivated by what has happened motivated in a negative sense by what's happened since Donald Trump became president on January 20th 2017 well now I'm most fascinated by watching college-educated voters and Women Voters across the country and are they going to be was their vote a protest vote against Hillary Clinton or are they actually going to turnout and be motivated by Donald Trump in the ways govern governing and as of now my bet is that they aren't and we've seen that in a lot of the special elections and certainly in these suburban districts but you look at you know especially what happened in Alabama too and black women in Alabama really saved the day with that election and so women across the country it's going to be interesting to see how they actually come out and vote if they're motivated to do so caddy let me get to another part of the poll the president of course is we all know always repeatedly claims and claimed on the campaign trail that he hires the best people and that he would hire the best people if elected president but with Forex advisors indicted three of those pleading guilty his former campaign chairman on trial right now a former aide in open revolt Monmouth posed this question and its latest survey does Donald Trump hire the best people here we actually cracked that oh well thirty percent said yes but a majority 58% said no and on a serious note here caddy when we get let's move beyond this fall and if Donald Trump decides to run for reelection and actually I count me as one of the few people who don't believe he will but if Donald Trump does decide to run for reelection that's when Americans take a serious look at whoever sitting in the Oval Office and they ask does he or she have the leadership qualities that we need to run America and part of Donald Trump stick was I've run this big business I've run that yeah I guess that yeah that was his big stick I know how to run things I hire the best people this actually is a good peak and oh let's just say a preview of 2020 and the type of attacks at Donald Trump would face if he did seek reelection well Donald Trump has lost 5% of that 35% on that question of whether he hires the best people because of all the drama in the White House and the comings and goings in the White House and repeatedly when you ask Trump supporters over the course of the last year and a half what are the things that you don't like about the way this president is handling the office it's the drama it is all the white house chaos and and Trump himself feeds into that when he criticizes his own choices when he talks repeatedly about Jeff Sessions as somebody who is not the best person for that job well who hired Jeff Sessions for that job that was Donald Trump who hired him that job so he undermines his own message that he has the best people and you combine that with the fact that we know that there are a raft of people who don't actually want to go into the white house word Donald Trump to one run for a second term or where the call to be made to them because it's too toxic and they fear for their own reputations and it's not surprising that people are starting to think well actually yeah this is perhaps not the best the smoothest management operation we've ever seen in in the history of the White House yeah and yet Walter Isaacson you're heading back to Louisiana hurricane season and all pretty soon when you head back there when I head back to my home state of Florida I will talk to a lot of people who say I don't like how he tweets I sure as hell don't like how he cozies up to Vladimir Putin I don't like what he's doing with NATO makes me nervous the way he's talking about Muller but the economy is doing better than it's ever done before my my small business is doing better than it's ever done before and hey the country's strong they'll be able to put up with some of the president's crazy tweets I'm still supporting him there are people that do tune out all of Donald Trump successes and just look at their individual lives and say hey things are going pretty darn well for me I think that's actually more true here in New York you have people who are totally appalled by his character and yet they work on Wall Street or whatever and they're very happy about the way he's treated the rich and the investment class in this country if you go back to when I go back to Louisiana and spending time there there were only two or three types of people the business leaders in Louisiana depend a lot on trade when the amount of soybeans going through the Port of New Orleans is down 30% or the companies in Louisiana can't import aluminum and steel to make the products they're doing there's a Sun certainty now about Donald Trump among business leaders in places like New Orleans on the other hand in a lot of rural Louisiana there's just a deep contempt for any who would speak ill of Donald Trump and they are really still very strongly in your face that Donald Trump is setting this country right yeah and I've got to tell you from my read that's not thirty three percent of Americans that's closer to forty percent of Americans who still will say hey things are going well and it still is a binary choice for so many Americans so many people I talked to if you say are you happy with Donald Trump they go well he's better than Nancy Pelosi he's better than Hillary Clinton it still is an either/or black-white-red team you know it's still blue team is still very very tribal thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on
