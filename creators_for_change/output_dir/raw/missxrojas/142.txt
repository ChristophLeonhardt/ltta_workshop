00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
hello this video was commissioned by pan

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,419
macmillan by my friend Amy<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pan</font>

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,799
McMahon who sent me an email that

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,080
actually sent Tara down my spine and not

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">because she was forcing me to accept</font>

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,590
payment to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about books which I love</font>

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,509
no nothing like that it was because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,410
used the word meditation I have a real

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,600
fear of the word meditation it is a deep

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,000
set fear like deep inside my stomach it

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,130
gives me panic it makes me stressed out

12
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,560
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it years of therapy still</font>

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,060
can't figure this out I hear the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,740
meditation and I channel Dudley Dursley

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,720
and I say shot and there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I</font>

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,250
understand about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even</font>

17
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,930
think it's meditation itself it's the

18
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,270
whole culture around it it's that weird

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,370
superiority that I think comes with it

20
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,980
and it's someone else telling you what

21
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,540
you're not doing right with your life I

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
think that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,690
been inherent to the way we've talked

24
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,520
about meditation in recent years but

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> N word that has been</font>

26
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,370
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rounds recently and that's</font>

27
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,440
mindfulness there's mindfulness coloring

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,270
books and it's all about mindfulness in

29
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,770
your daily life but the email from know

30
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,780
me and Pam<font color="#E5E5E5"> I arrived at the end of the</font>

31
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,850
bananas work period that has been this

32
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,710
summer have I mentioned it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

33
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,390
five thousand times 24 hours of

34
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,129
mindfulness is actually a nice short and

35
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's also free a lot in my day-to-day</font>

36
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,790
life and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> online as well I</font>

37
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked a bit about I need to slow</font>

38
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,720
moments down so slow down the instant

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,250
purchase and so down there's moments

40
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,960
where we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something is default</font>

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,310
realize that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have control</font>

42
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the way we decide to do something</font>

43
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,360
we have control over our dresses one of

44
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,350
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really liked about</font>

45
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,030
this short and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had me emailing know</font>

46
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,009
me back like yes I'll do it was that

47
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an invitation to notice</font>

48
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,880
things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an invitation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to slow</font>

49
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,680
moments down so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short kind of time</font>

50
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,180
starts it starts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning goes</font>

51
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,189
through the day and I try to do the same

52
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,960
things with my day and at the end of

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,610
each time stamped section there's a

54
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,290
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> prompt like asking you questions</font>

55
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,509
I try to do this very consciously for

56
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,299
one day yesterday and I think it turned

57
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,530
out really well here are some things

58
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that really resonated with me so even if</font>

59
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,310
I shorts aren't your thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still</font>

60
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,380
make like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful in it via me</font>

61
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,689
via this channel that is made so when I

62
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,189
read physical books i scribble notes and

63
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,049
margins when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read ebooks I normally</font>

64
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,640
read them on my computer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,290
have a word document open so I can copy

66
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,940
and paste<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite bits kind of turns</font>

67
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,560
it into like a little poem or something

68
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,970
we just have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be open to the</font>

69
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can use anything and</font>

70
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,660
everything that we encounter in our day

71
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support our natural ability to be</font>

72
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,010
aware com and wise I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

73
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,900
kindness it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't</font>

74
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'm naturally very fine first my</font>

75
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,500
instinct go super<font color="#CCCCCC"> bored to being</font>

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,880
critical and two something's been quite

77
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,200
harsh i have might be kind to yourself

78
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,450
poster that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i also have to be a</font>

79
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,010
little kinder than you have to Costa

80
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,900
from we rely as curiosity and interest

81
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,850
enough to ask the question how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

82
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,530
engage at this moment says to support

83
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,810
awareness calm and connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

84
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,940
this stuff sounds like someone else

85
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,410
would do it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person would be</font>

86
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing lululemon yoga trousers leggings</font>

87
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,950
what's the English word for them yoga

88
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,930
leggings I've been changed already all

89
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,280
I'm thinking is yoga pants but there's

90
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,330
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these was that can</font>

91
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,160
sometimes feel pretentious but in this

92
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,040
it all made a lot of sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me I felt</font>

93
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,050
the same when I actually read taking

94
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,700
that pan and add to pronounce his name

95
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,310
apologize the heart I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing it's</font>

96
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,010
that something just connected you that

97
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make sense and this was something</font>

98
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,040
that connected with me I'm definitely a

99
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,470
curious person I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new google</font>

100
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,970
feature we can type in<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm feeling</font>

101
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,769
curious and it gives you a fact another

102
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:11,880
thing it really resonated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me was</font>

103
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,650
that there was a big section on paying

104
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,780
attention to breathing and that the

105
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,640
author go so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he has a</font>

106
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,280
post it on his computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a big be on</font>

107
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,900
it my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mum has a tracking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or to me which</font>

108
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,700
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like a hole in her throat and she's</font>

109
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,709
got tubes and things in it helps her

110
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,880
breathe it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font>

111
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,350
normal to me but it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that I</font>

112
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,510
have a certain kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hyper awareness</font>

113
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,010
of her breathing and of my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathing</font>

114
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,630
and when I was a teenager especially I

115
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,220
became really aware of the moments when

116
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,230
my mom was a breathing and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

117
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,900
just tell her breathe pray but<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

118
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,760
more fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> i notice that i do the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

119
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,920
would mimic those non breathing patterns

120
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,540
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time you can notice your</font>

121
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,640
breath without getting to that place is

122
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,200
a good thing another thing I really took

123
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,030
away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was that you don't have</font>

124
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like banish technology think about</font>

125
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you reach for your</font>

126
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,100
phone but it's also when you're in

127
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,520
you're in

128
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,740
the new books is mad it's looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

129
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,960
those emails and thinking of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

130
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,120
as having come from a person who's just

131
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,410
trying to do their job the final thing I

132
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,460
mentioned which came up when i was doing

133
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,230
my 24 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> on mindfulness yesterday is</font>

134
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about memory it's about</font>

135
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,290
spotting patterns<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's pretty</font>

136
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,420
much verbatim from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> east shore itself</font>

137
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,160
what are the patterns in my day whatever

138
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,660
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do without thinking what are</font>

139
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,160
the things that actually bring me life

140
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,110
and bring me happiness and make me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

141
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,430
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> calmer and make me feel a bit a</font>

142
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,988
little curious making fit feel a bit

143
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">more interested in the world the</font>

144
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,200
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spotting patterns reinforces</font>

145
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,670
the fact that it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you these</font>

146
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,290
are your patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is your behavior</font>

147
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't anyone elses you can't carbon</font>

148
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,650
copy that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to hear your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts</font>

149
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,180
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also your thoughts on</font>

150
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,920
meditation and mindfulness and things

like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comments like does that</font>

152
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,010

you let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more oh I think next I</font>
