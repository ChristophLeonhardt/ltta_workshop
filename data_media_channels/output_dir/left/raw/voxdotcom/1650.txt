2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,780
Where Silk Comes from

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,920
Well, worm spit

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,320
Bombyx Mori 
aka. Silkworm

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,140
The silk production process 
is also known as Sericutlture.

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,560
It dates back to around 4,800 years ago in China.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,400
Here is the process in action at the silk farm
Artisans Angkor, near Siem Reap, Cambodia

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,920
Larvae hatch out of these eggs after 14 days

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,600
Those eggs were laid by adult moths 
This one is dead

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,840
After millennia of domestication, 
the adult moths cannot fly

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,520
The larvae feast on MulberryLeaves

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,640
They eat continuously

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,520
For about 42 days

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,020
Then it's cocoon time

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,280
They spin their silk cocoon for 3-8 days

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,540
One strand. Secreted by sailvry glands.

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,480
About 1,000 feet long.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
The chrysalis inside is then killed by steam
 or by laying in the sun or boiling

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,160
The cocoons are loosened in hot wtr and unwound

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,200
Several strands are spun together into a thread

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
Raw silk (outside of cocoon)

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,520
Fine silk (inside of cocoon)

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,360
Workers painstakingly remove lumps and debris

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,440
The silk is dyed any color of the rainbow

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,720
A  warping whel divides the fine silk thread

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,000
Fine silk

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,600
Raw silk

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:00:00,000
It takes about  2500 silkworms to make 1 pound of silk
