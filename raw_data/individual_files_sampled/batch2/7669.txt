now some believe that the Trump and the Russians are not working together and that there's no evidence of that and one of the arguments made is well what does Trump ever done for the Russians he hasn't done anything for them if there's a deal it's a kind of a funny deal because Trump hasn't delivered on his end now we told you that he was fighting the idea of putting new sanctions on Russia or even continuing the old sanctions on Russia but people didn't believe it every report that came in from the White House their allies said Trump doesn't want to do the sanctions but for whatever reason people didn't want to believe it well now we have more conclusive evidence that in fact he never wanted to do the sanctions and it's not doing them now which would be potentially Trump's end of the deal so first of all did the Russians hack into our systems and might they do it again hence the severity of the situation and why you'd want to put sanctions on in the first place here is Donald Trump's CIA chief that's Mike Pompeo and put in there by Donald Trump very loyal to Donald Trump and even he admits yeah of course they're looking to do more hacking watch do you have concerns that they might try and interfere in the u.s. midterms which are coming out of course I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that but I'm confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election that will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won't be great and that was the reason for the sanctions hey we know they did it in the past and now we are afraid they were going to try to do it in fact Pompeo said of course they're gonna try to do it in 2018 to actually interfere with the vote so is that enough to drive Trump to finally actually enforce the sanctions now remember the sanctions were passed ninety eight to two in the Senate overwhelmingly in the house and it put Trump in a position where vetoing it wouldn't have done him any good so he's forced to sign it but to this day he still hasn't enforced it and we were wondering is there ever going to come a point where I need you to enforce well actually it turns out there was a deadline and that deadline has a now pass so let's go to Reuters to find out what happened the Trump administration said on Monday it would not immediately impose additional sanctions on Russia despite a new law designed to punish Moscow's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election assisting the measure was already hitting Russian companies the sanctions are working because we did not put them in place that's the excuse that the Trump administration is using what did I tell you I told you he never wants to do those sanctions because Putin told him not to do the sanctions now what is the contours of that deal I mean I hope Muller finds out and it is very hard to know but it's Trump doing things to make Putin happy it is glaringly obvious let me give you more details Trump who wanted quote warmer ties with Moscow and had opposed the legislation as it worked its way through Congress signed it reluctantly in August just six months into his presidency but I told you then he had no intention of putting those sanctions into place and now he hasn't so that leads us to the State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert Reuters explains under the measure the administration faced the deadline on money to impose sanctions on anyone determined to conduct significant business with Russian defense and intelligence sectors already sanctioned for their alleged role in the election but citing long time frames associated with major defense deals Nauert said that it was better to wait to impose those sanctions wait if it takes a long time to put into effect why would you want to wait wouldn't you want to do it right away or maybe your boss never ever wants to do the sanctions because he works for the Russians there look if please pressive look the right wing is hopeless but the progressives if you think it's because Donald Trump has a philosophy that he shares with you guys though he doesn't want war with Russia and he wants a warmer relationship and he's doing it for geopolitical reasons listen to yourself talk Donald Trump with principles and a philosophy a governing philosophy for Donald Trump and and he really wants peace in the world and that's why he's doing no the only things up in terms of deals money and and what's in it for him and it's obvious that helping the Russians for whatever reason is something that is to the benefit of Donald Trump shortly before midnight on Monday the Treasury Department to be fair released and unclassified oligarchs lists including a hundred and fourteen senior Russian political figures and ninety-six businesspeople so that seems like they're doing some part of the sanctions that was part of the bill right you got to come up with a list and then once you have the list and now if you punish those oligarchs those that's actually the most effective thing you could do in terms of sanctions because you knew sanctions on the whole country what do they care they're oligarchs they cared they would've been oligarchs in the first place Soho but if you knew sanctions on the oligarchs or freeze their assets well then they get very very upset in fact that's what that Donald Trump jr. meeting was about during the campaign to get rid of the Magnitsky Act which puts sanctions on the oligarchs so let's be fair here I mean they've come up with a list so let's see what they're gonna do with the list those named on the lists will not immediately face any immediate penalties like asset freezes or visa bans in other words not a damn thing Trump's riding high he thinks stock markets booming all my donors are thrilled I gave them trillions of dollars in tax cuts so I'm in a comfortable position so now I will do whatever I want including making sure that those sanctions are never put on Russia so now if you don't trust me on it and you say no no no I'm sure that there's a different explanation well let's go to a Republican senator Susan Collins see if she thinks is a good idea why why didn't the White House move on the sanctions that you voted on that is perplexing to me that bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate it was not partisan in the least bob corker and Ben Cardin the leaders of the Foreign Relations Committee worked very closely together they came up with a bill that was balanced and needed perplexing well it's perplexing if you're looking at them from a policy position I can actually make a progressive argument for it you cannot make a right-wing argument for it if you ask me but it isn't about arguments it isn't about debated in about policy positions is that Donald Trump doesn't want to put sanctions on the Russians all right well bob Corker was one of his biggest critics early on but now that he himself has got a nice loophole tax cut in that giant bill and his donors are happy and he's happy and they've got all that money stuffed in their pockets bob Corker who was one of the guys who led the sanctions bill in the first place not as concerned all of a sudden reuters reporting again here senator corker the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee one of the main congressional architects of the sanctions law said he was not concerned that the administration did not announce sanctions by Monday's deadline now that he's got his tax cuts all of a sudden he's not concerned quote this is one sanction season begins so they'll be rolling them out you keep waiting Bob let's see if they wind up rolling them out pretty sure that I'm gonna get to say wrong again bob is no intention of rolling them out cuz he works for Putin okay and by the way if you want to know my theory as to why it's because he's been money laundering for this same oligarchs for decades it isn't around the edges oh my god they hacked in and got some emails from Podesta to me that is peanuts and if that's what the Democrats are hanging their hopes on I think they're gonna be sorely disappointed that it's not a I don't believe that's the thing that you impeach a president over but if he in fact does have an active deal with the Russians and especially it involves money and in return he's given them something like making sure the sanctions don't get put into place well there's a word for that and it's a pretty significant crime in America as it is in any country now one last piece of evidence egg we go to a Russian television station and maybe they have a different perspective on this so let's be fair on that count - let's take a look what the Slava Marjan sang say polka yep additional sheet polka Trump appears to be ours again so by the way when the sanctions were put into place and Trump didn't be to it and couldn't block it some stuff leaked about Trump yeah I thought that was interesting as well but now Trump is there again and so everything is hunky-dory if you think all this is a coincidence or the deep philosophical political ideological viewpoint of Donald Trump as it relates to geopolitics he thought Oh Donald Trump at all there's a deal and this is one end of the deal most obvious thing in the world you just watch the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd
