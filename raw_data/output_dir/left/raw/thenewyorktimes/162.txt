1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,010
Seven billion people inhabit
planet Earth, and their fates

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,590
rest in the hands
of these two men.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,160
“Uh, they will
be doing things.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,640
And, uh, I think he
wants to do things.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,310
I think he wants to, uh, we’ll be
doing something on it.”

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,710
What if we’ve been
overthinking foreign policy

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,150
all along?

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,910
And what the world really
needed was a movie trailer?

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,580
No, really.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,350
This actually happened.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,090
Trump made a fake
movie trailer

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,640
to deal with an
actual nuclear threat.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,409
“I showed it to
him today, and I

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,250
think he loved it.”

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,080
From the administration who

16
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,450
tanked the Iran nuclear
deal, which eliminated

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,800
98% of Iran’s enriched
uranium, comes an epic mash-up

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,340
of stock footage.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,650
Like these horses running through water.

20
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,180
This guy dunking and
this girl in a field.

21
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,220
Donald Trump plays
the Dotard,

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,920
and Kim Jong un is Rocket
Man.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,850
In his performance, Trump doesn’t hold back.

24
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,910
Suspending military
exercises with South Korea.

25
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,250
“I think it’s inappropriate
to be having war games.”

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,120
As for Kim’s performance,

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,800
he gives... nothing,
really, because he

28
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,270
made no concessions.

29
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,720
Nothing about a timetable
for denuclearization

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,800
or verification
or even destroying

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,690
intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

32
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,040
“Can you ensure anything?

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
Can I ensure that you’re
going to be able to sit down

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,330
properly when you sit down?

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,970
I mean, you can’t
ensure anything.”

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,520
But look at this cloud.

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,930
And this guy doing VR.

38
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,090
And this really fast train.

39
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,670
Many people are saying this

40
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:33,250
could be a Nobel Prize-
winning performance.

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,970
New York Times says, “Holy [bleep], I
can’t believe this is real.”

42
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,670
Critics are raving, “What about
Kim Jong-un’s human rights

43
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,490
violations and these
concentration camps?”

44
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,410
But look at these fast boats.

45
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,840
Machu Picchu, and
these beautiful condos

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,470
on the beach.

47
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,720
“You see that whenever they
are exploding their cannons

48
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,430
into the ocean.

49
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,370
I said, ‘Boy, look at that.

50
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,060
Wouldn‘t that make a
great condo?’”

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,050
Coming to North Korea on a
smuggled thumb drive soon.

52
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,440
“Really, he’s got
a great personality.

53
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,230
He’s a, you know, funny guy.

54
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,450
He’s a very smart guy.

55
00:02:02,450 --> 00:00:00,000
He’s a great negotiator.
