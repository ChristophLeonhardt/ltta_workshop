here's how to clean your computer you want to get a can of compressed air and some electronics cleaner you can make it up if you don't have any it's just equal parts water and rubbing alcohol then get yourself a flat weave microfiber cloth this is one that can pick up any debris so it won't scratch a surface that is really really important especially when you're cleaning a monitor what I like to do is pick up whether it's my laptop or a keyboard you want to pick it up and sort of tip it on its side that way anything that you blow out with the compressed air is gonna fall down instead of back into the keyboard or worse on your face so do that get rid of any gunk that's stuck in your keyboard using compressed air then you can spray your microfiber cloth here's my imaginary microfiber cloth with your electronics cleaner there it is tap it off on the back of your hand too much moisture on a cloth especially around electronics very bad thing on another rule never spray your Electronics directly with product so once you have this cloth wet you can give your keyboard a quick wipe again whether it's your laptop or a standalone keyboard and you can wrap the cloth around your pointer finger and just get into those little nooks and crannies and really clean any of those dirty areas you know which ones I'm talking about and then you can use another section of that cloth spray it down again tap it off on the back of your hand and you can clean your monitor using what I call the S pattern which is where you start at the top you work your way to one side and then you keep sweeping downward using an S pattern until you get to the bottom and that will get rid of streaks for you
