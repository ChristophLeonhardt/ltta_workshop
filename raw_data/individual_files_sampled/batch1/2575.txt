fortunately I think I'm a good listener and I think if you're if you are a leader you need to be a good listener and at the bar on Necker you know I meet the extraordinary people I mean Jack Dorsey some years ago and he told me about Twitter and you know we ended up investing in his company when somebody comes to me who's interested in starting a business I mean I think my first question is you know do you have an idea that's going to make other people's lives better if you do you have a business and then a second thing a bit of advice would be screw it just get on and do it and surround yourself with great people make sure you have a lot of fun in the process make sure you find time for yourself and and and just get on with it
