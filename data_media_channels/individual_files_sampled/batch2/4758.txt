I was told by someone familiar with it who I trust implicitly that with a nudge and a wink we've been hired by Trump NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel sat down recently with a source familiar with the work of black cube an Israeli private security firm that was hired to dig up dirt on proponents of the Iran nuclear deal during the Obama administration the source alleged that the person behind the discredit asian campaign was ultimately donald trump or someone close to it the White House did not respond to NBC's request for comment and black cube says it quote has no relation whatsoever to the Trump administration to trump aids to anyone close to the administration what are their on nuclear deal unquote etosha Bergeron is back with me and joining me now is treat a Parsi president of the National Iranian American Council and author of losing an enemy Obama Iran and the triumph of diplomacy and treati yet you figure in this story where apparently someone we don't know who hired black cube this Israeli firm with ties to the Mossad Israeli intelligence services - and they'd also figures in the Harvey Weinstein case they were hired to discredit and harass some of the women who accused Harvey Weinstein they get hired to try and discredit Ben Rhodes than a second former Obama administration aide by going through their wives but they try to just credit people who would put the deal together they also came at you I want to play a little bit of Richard angles report regarding a phone call that you received from a black cube operative take a listen so base it is today we've been right memorizing calling the coal hunters a lot of guys new simplified see in it I mean it's t strong satanic eruptions beside me just a minute there any other geysers but it did some Watchers I don't quite follow what exactly what did that happen what was this person who were they did you ever find out who they were what were they trying to get out of you so I was just contacted by someone who said that they were a journalist my book had just come out so I did a lot of media interviews without necessarily doing the the screening that I might have done otherwise and the conversation takes a strange turn in which he wants to go after the band and go after : cow and essentially trying to get me to say that there were individuals in the Obama administration that wanted to strike this deal because they had financial reasons to do so that they would benefit themselves financially if this deal was struck and it was very odd because he was essentially trying to force those words into my mouth and he's also essentially they wanted your help and to use your credibility to discredit Ben Rhodes and Colin cow yes because my book is on the nuclear deal and what was happening as to the inside story of it so I think that's part of the reason why they came to me and essentially tried to get me to say things that would validate some of these conspiracy theories that they were putting out there and did you get the sense during the putting together of the deal or in the immediate aftermath of it were you aware could you sense that there was a disinformation campaign trying to undermine the basis for the deal as a prelude to what obviously Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel wants which is the deal to go away without a doubt I mean the effort to try to discredit the deal discredit the people behind the deal has been going on for a very long time even before diplomacy started what the difference here is though that if this allegation is true and it really needs to be investigated by Congress then we actually have the President of the United States ordering a foreign intelligence firm to go after former Obama officials people supportive of the deal and try to essentially entrap them that's a major escalation compared to the type of disinformation and slanderous things that were being done prior to this and bring you back in here nice house because we know that for perverted angles reporting the black cube operation is launched very shortly after Donald Trump returns from Israel and we know that Donald Trump is a very close relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu who was facing his own corruption criminal charges back home and that we know that Netanyahu wanted the deal scrapped they wanted this piece of Obama's legacy done because now they're doing military operations against the riding facilities is there any reporting on whether or not there is a direct link that can be made between Donald Trump himself any of his aides and Israeli foreign intelligence services or you know their acolytes well we know that an Israeli firm briefed the Trump campaign before the election about psychological operations and we know that Trump does have this close relationship with Netanyahu but we have not been able to link black queue and its client directly to the Trump administration I think that what we have that the biggest clue that we have right now is that Colin call and Ben Rhodes were made targets by Trump aids last year so people like Sebastian Gorka were going out on Fox News right and saying these are the and basically putting a bull's-eye on these two people saying these are the guys that are most responsible for the Iran deal happening of course Colin call is is wonderful but he's very low I mean he's compared to Ben Rhodes compared to the higher level people he's really not all that senior yeah so the fact that you had this attention being placed on these two men is really really telling and of course coincidentally maybe not they have been among the most vocal critics of Donald Trump especially on social media right ever since he was running he's good that feels like that and just to let the audience know we're talking about this is a separate Israeli firm called psy group that Natasha was talking about the Wall Street Journal report on Friday the Israeli intelligence firms election meddling analysis comes under mullah scrutiny Robert mullahs now looking at them that what you're looking at is a presentation that was made by this group called Sai Sai group and one of the slides talked about the creation of fake news discrediting news organizations and spreading fate spreading uncertainty and fake content a lot of it directed at Sanders supporters trying to turn them against Hillary Clinton using fake BOTS to react to real-life situations and further polarizing the target audience that's one of their slides and then if we just go to a element 5 it just so happens at the guy who runs that group he's showed up at that Trump Tower meeting there he was with Don Jr Eric Prince of Blackwater Jorge nadir the emissary to the United Arab Emirates in Saudi Arabia and there he is Joel's Amell just showing up there but before we go treati is there been any follow-up have you received any outreach from investigators from FBI from mullahs organization from Muller's grand jury to talk about your experience I have not but what I'm hoping to see is that Congress will actually start looking into this because the link that Natasha mentioned it might be very difficult to be able to get unless there is some form of Investigation yeah clearly Natasha Bertrand treati Parsi thank you both very much for your time yes and coming up the woman who could be the next governor of the
