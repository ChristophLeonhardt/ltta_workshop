1
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:14,459
WE ARE IN A CULTURAL MOMENT,

2
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,594
WE ARE IN A VITAL POLITICAL

3
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:16,928
MOMENT.

4
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:18,596
JUST AS WE ARE MOVING IN THE

5
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:21,432
RIGHT DIRECTION IN GENDER

6
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:22,300
EQUALITY, WE ARE MOVING IN THE

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,936
WRONG DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES

8
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:26,270
TO POLICY.

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,038
ONE PARTY IS OVERWHELMINGLY TO

10
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:27,338
BLAME.

11
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:27,972
WE DISCOVERED THAT LAST

12
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:28,339
THURSDAY.

13
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,476
CHRISTINE FORD IS A GOOD

14
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:32,476
PERSON CAUGHT UP IN AN UGLY

15
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:32,744
WAR.

16
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,414
IT WAS A SMALL DETAIL THAT

17
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:36,948
GAVE THE GAME AWAY.

18
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:37,649
THE REVELATION THAT EVEN AS

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:38,716
THE DEMOCRATS WERE HOLDING THE

20
00:00:38,716 --> 00:00:44,322
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATION,

21
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:47,892
FROM THE FBI AND FROM BRETT

22
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:48,827
KAVANAUGH HIMSELF, THEY KNEW

23
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:51,262
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE HER

24
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:52,096
NAME PUBLIC, THEY KNEW THEY

25
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:53,131
WERE GOING TO DO IT AFTER THE

26
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:56,301
STRENGTH SO NOW WE KNOW THE

27
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,035
DEMOCRATS WERE NOT PROTECTING

28
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,670
A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

29
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,407
THEY WERE PREPARING HER FOR

30
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:03,041
USE AS APPLICABLE WEAPON.

31
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,578
WHEN I WATCH THAT HEARING,

32
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:07,212
SOMETHING CHANGED FOR ME.

33
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:08,313
I WOKE UP TO THE TRUTH ABOUT

34
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:10,248
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

35
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:10,682
ESTABLISHMENT.

36
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:11,349
THIS WHOLE THING, IT'S NOT

37
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:11,917
ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS.

38
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:15,253
IF IT WAS THEY WOULD BE

39
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:20,058
EQUALLY OUTRAGED ABOUT THEIR

40
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:20,725
OWN ABUSER KEITH ELLISON.

41
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:21,393
IT'S NOT ABOUT OVER TO

42
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:22,127
OVERTURNING THE PATRIARCHY IS

43
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,328
ABOUT OVERTURNING THE

44
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,463
ELECTION.

45
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:25,564
THEY SEE IT THAT IF THEY LET

46
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:26,331
THE PRESIDENT FILL THE SEAT

47
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:28,400
THEIR POWER IS LOSS FOR

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,934
GENERATION OR MORE.

49
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:29,968
THEY WILL TAKE ANY PRICE TO

50
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,503
TAKE THAT POWER.

51
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:36,108
THROW HER TO THE WOLVES, JUDGE

52
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:43,915
KAVANAUGH, WHO CARES, THE

53
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:44,683
SUPREME COURT, THROUGH THAT AS

54
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:45,250
LONG AS WE WIT.

55
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,084
THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY, RIP

56
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:47,219
IT TO PIECES AS LONG AS WE

57
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:47,786
KEEP THE BIGGEST ONE.

58
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:48,720
YOU KNOW ME, I TRY TO BE

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,122
REASONABLE, OPEN-MINDED, I

60
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:50,622
HATE PARTISANSHIP.

61
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:55,761
I WANT HELP BUILD THE POPULACE

62
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:56,428
MOVEMENT BEYOND PARTY, ONE

63
00:01:56,428 --> 00:01:56,995
THAT IS PRO- WORKER,

64
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,330
PROFAMILY, PRO- AMERICA, BUT I

65
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,064
CAN'T TAKE THESE ESTABLISHMENT

66
00:01:59,064 --> 00:01:59,598
DEMOCRATS ANYMORE.

67
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:02,034
THESE IDENTITY POLITICS IDIOT

68
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:05,470
FOR RECKLESSLY DIVIDING THIS

69
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,171

00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,639
YOUNG AGAINST OLD, A AGAINST

71
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,941
STRAIGHT AND MEN AGAINST

72
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:10,508
WOMEN.

73
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:11,777
WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH THE

74
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:12,444
BRETT KAVANAUGH SITUATION,

75
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:15,881
WHETHER HE'S CONFIRMED OR

76
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,249
BROUGHT DOWN BY NEW

77
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:17,649
ALLEGATIONS.

78
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,886
THE WAY THAT THE DEMOCRATS

79
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,221
HAVE FOUGHT HIS NOMINATION

80
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,124
WILL HAVE A LASTING, CORROSIVE

81
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:25,758
EFFECT ON THIS COUNTRY.

82
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,358
BEFORE THURSDAY I JUST

83
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:26,892
DISAGREED WITH THEM.

84
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:31,330
NOW I'M FRIGHTENED OF THEM.

85
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,064
BECAUSE THE MASK WAS RIPPED

86
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,331
OFF.

87
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,700
UNDERNEATH ALL THAT POMPOUS

88
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,869
SANCTIMONIOUS PREENING ABOUT

SOCIAL JUSTICE AND BEING ON

90
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,707
THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY,

91
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:42,641
THEY REMIND US OF THE DARKEST

92
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:48,580
DAYS OF HISTORY, THE SNARLING

CENTURY EUROPE.

95
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:50,349
IT IS A FRIGHTENING FUTURE IF

96
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,650
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PREVAIL.

97
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,520
