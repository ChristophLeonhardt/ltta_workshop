we are here today to call out as they're all aware Jordan Reed Peterson for his refusal to respect the pronouns of his transgender students Jordan B Peterson has made it clear that he feels that he has the authority to dictate the gender identities of his students which we are here to say that he does not learn Sutherland is not a is not a member of the transgender community they're here with an all-right media organization did you want to do an interview about this I'm trying to get all opinions you don't think we're supposed to prioritize trans and non-binary voices are you binary well let me prioritize your voice I don't think that's fair is awaits this woman I'm actually not sis but what does that mean saying that's not fair for me as a white sister so you're trans Center your non-binary I didn't you just say you're non-binary you asked me if I was and I said no I'm sick okay your sister so you think it's unfair to talk because you're cisgender no I'm supportive of the trans community and I think that it's important that we listen to transit non-binary horses first I think everyone's opinion matters equally ladies are willing if you're willing to be educated I'm willing to teach but if you're not willing today you aren't necessarily an educator that's the problem everyone everyone everyone so we're going to be and trans people we have a little bit more we have standing then we have more knowledge on the subject and other people do we have to don't have to go on the Sun to talk about the Sun you look into it you can read the statistics but someone who's been closer to the Sun would have a better course I think they'd be dead to be honest yeah they would but that's what but like if they wouldn't they would have more to say I can tell you how hot the Sun is without going to the Sun I'll tell you right now but anyone can tell you how hot the Sun is any of us can tell you trans people are trans have you dawn to go have a discussion with Peterson what he said was that he would not acknowledge our pronouns that is not the same as saying he must have a describe he said because and gave a reason now if you went and asked him for more to have a debate on that if I say I don't believe the sky is cream you think he'd hurt you a trans-masculine person in a dress talking to trans folks is never take whether it's physical or verbal okay so you're not willing to have a discussion because it wouldn't be a safe space I am not willing to have a discussion about whether or not I am real and valid people just don't want to talk it's it's always like yelling or just saying like I'm right my point of view is always right and no one no one looks at both sides of the story anymore I question if people have even seen the video sometimes based on what they're saying about what Peterson has said like the existence like he never stated that they didn't exist just that he didn't recognize like non-binary genders but I just feel like if they were just having an open discussion I feel like it'd be better cuz I don't agree with everything Peterson said but you know I don't I don't think he's a racist bigot and all this he well I would just like to say that as sympathetic as I am to the trans an lgbtq+ community's goals I am very I'm also very disappointed to just hear my race my own skin color be attacked I think that's very inappropriate and I don't want to be in the position in which I have to oppose bill c16 but simply due to the fact that I believe it's poorly written the fact that refusing to simply refusing to refer to someone's pronoun could constitute discrimination simply means the bill needs to be rewritten for its examined the the ralliers the protestors here keep referring to the fact that they claim that dr. peterson has said that non-binary people simply do not exist in fact that is not what he said he has said that gender sex at birth gender expression and gender identity simply do not vary independently that's simply the only claim he's made in his videos and he actually has made that very clear so I highly encourage everyone to actually give the video as a watch before protesting many of the organizers actually informed me that they didn't and I would also like to say to anyone who wants to stop any sort of discrimination not to yell at people based on their skin color ads just happen to me thank you very much so would you like to give your opinion I mean and we just had someone scream at us that I'm interviewing too many white people's too many white men I got a problem going up to the straightest sisters waitis people you can find and trying to get their opinions on this it just came up to you for your opinions who actually has knowledgeable and informed opinions and people who don't have experience in this area are just less likely we're talking about free speech actually I'm talking to people because I want to know whether they want a man to be fired I want to know about Bill c16 I want to know what they think about campus freedom everyone here can give their opinion on whether they think this is a campus with free speech anyone anyone of any skin color or gender can give that opinion what are your thoughts on the event today well actually I'm not Canadian on Europeans say things in Europe are so different like I'm all for this one's gender rights and everything but I think this is going overboard my tea sack someone things just not using the word die I think this is this is absurd to be honest like I understand Canadians say politically correct and all that this is going overboard to be honest do you believe in free speech on this do you think do you think you have the right to disagree with this on the campus do you think that people will attack you if you disagree with it well free I've just said that you cameraman who's getting attacked say I might get attacked suitable learn here's the deal I want to learn about you guys I I genuinely do I so here's the deal I was born in Toronto a raised in Pakistan you need to realize that people who are gay over there get killed that's that's and I'm telling you this I'm telling you this I grew up over there okay alright I came about four years ago and I need to learn everybody who's oppressed right now everybody who's you know I you can be whoever I support you guys that's the number one thing you need to realize if you want to be a tri Ron osiris-rex tomorrow you could be it I'm gay I don't care what you want to be that the thing is that to educate a crowd and know that they they want to be educated but the fact that you're just being offended but just the fact right now you just you just turned and you're like oh that's not like do you not realize that trans people get killed i Emily option worker and I work with kids and I've seen and worked with trans youth that have been murdered over and over killed them all right and I yeah one peg just just tell me what you would come and instigate this is a place where people are talking about serious issues of death anything do that I'm just sitting over here no why is this your space okay we're having a conversation this is space to do it why you came over to talk about why are you yelling because you this look like free speech I don't even know what to say you know it's just that I tried my best I'm just I swear to god that's you can't scream listen at us while he's trying to ask me a question I'm just gonna shut down and we're gonna you're honestly a gem you know you gotta kill them with kindness I'm Lauren by the way are you up for a quick interview after this maybe sure yeah so are you helping arrange this event no I wasn't I'm just attending in solidarity what do you think do you think that the professor should be fired for saying he doesn't want to use pronouns so that he should be removed from his position well I think we should talk to him and maybe if he met me or like anyone else like us and we had a talk he could see like where we're coming from it would be nice to have an open conversation where hopefully we could express ourselves to him the problem is that you have to either conform to what exactly they're saying or you have to be on the other side and you can't find any middle ground whatsoever I think I've met a lot of people who actually agree with transgenderism there just have questions exactly but like I think it's important to you know identify these things but you know you can't it can't be a complete thing where you eyes are conforming absolutely to everything they're saying or nothing at all and they can't start you know policing language like they were doing with you blocking your camera I think that's ludicrous you know it's all about getting the message out and talking about these things you guys would you support Peterson's right to not use they/them pronouns yeah I would but I can see where they're having the conflict as well that yeah he's in a public space but I absolutely believe in his freedom of speech to do so thanks for watching if you enjoyed that video then be sure to hit the subscribe button to check out more content I'm not antagonist ik I'm just you know I'm doing my job yeah a lot of people are just doing their job that's a good argument I wonder where else that was made in history sorry I wonder else that arguments been made just yes I am I am literally Hitler yes that's what I said
