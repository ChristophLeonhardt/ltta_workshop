1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
you haven't spoken publicly really until
today and just to either of you

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,760
why are you breaking your silence what
do you want people to know

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,150
well for starters Brooke Cindy and I
knew the day we met

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,910
OTO at the airport that we were going to
we were going to share our experience

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,930
the the horribleness of what North Korea
did to him was so devastating to our

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,930
family that it we experienced a shock
that I have never experienced in my life

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,790
as a family we needed to come together
and process this as as best we could and

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,890
over the past three months we've we've
we've started the grief process my kids

9
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,219
Austin and Greta are amazing and and and
now we we see North Korea with the

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,129
tensions claiming to be a victim and
they're claiming that the world is

11
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,709
picking on them and we're here to tell
you as witnesses to the terror of their

12
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:12,240
regime North Korea is not a victim so we
felt it was time to tell the truth about

13
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,549
the condition that Ida was in let's
start there

14
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,820
this warm beer if you don't mind sure
tell me about the day sure yeah in the

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,520
morning of the day that he was going to
be medevacked home senator portman

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,200
called us to tell us we weren't sure
that North Korea was going to release

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,860
him even though we knew he was in a coma
and that he had been in a coma

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:53,130
pretty much shortly after his trial and
so he was out of their airspace so he

19
00:01:53,130 --> 00:02:00,899
sent her deportment said he'll be home
tonight and I said to him can you tell

20
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:10,630
me how odd oh how his
how his brain is functioning I was were

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,230
really optimistic people and so we were
just still hopeful that we would get

22
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,250
auto back and he he could be like with
good American health care he could

23
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,920
improve and not be okay and Senator
Portman said it was severe brain damage

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:42,190
so still not knowing what that entailed
we went to the airport and waited and we

25
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:50,680
were kept away from all the press we
weren't sure what was going on

26
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,080
but we knew that the press wasn't going
to be involved because this was our

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,880
private time understandable with auto so
I'm going to let Fred start but we were

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:15,310
at at a little private hangar and tarmac
and the plane landed and using the term

29
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:23,790
coma for Otto's condition is completely
unfair Otto had severe brain damage otto

30
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,750
was systematically tortured and
intentionally injured by kim jong kim

31
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:40,810
and his regime and this was no accident
it they intentionally injured Otto I'll

32
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,150
tell you what it was like when we met
Otto at the airport we were in a waiting

33
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:53,769
room and the plane comes in comes near
to where we are the medical team agrees

34
00:03:53,769 --> 00:04:00,640
they'll go out and meet Otto first and
then it's a great they come down five or

35
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,700
seven minutes later and it's time for
the family to go up and meet him and so

36
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,780
we walked out to the plane the engines
are whining it's myself Cindy Austin and

37
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:21,029
Greta we climb the stairs to the
to meet with auto halfway up the stairs

38
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:31,340
we hear this this loud guttural howling
inhuman sound we don't know what it is

39
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,050
we continue up the steps we get to the
top of the steps and we look across in

40
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,720
the airplane and Auto is laying on a
stretcher he's strapped to the stretcher

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,979
and he's moving around and jerking
violently making these howling inhuman

42
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,789
sounds
Greta and Cyndi go back leave go down

43
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:03,000
the steps it's too much for them to
handle Austin and I walk over to Otto

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,409
and he's in this condition he's has a
shaved head his eyes are darting around

45
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:18,750
in the it hit there as big as saucers
he's blind he's deaf he's got a feeding

46
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,909
tube and it we kneel down and we hug him
and try to connect with him and he's a

47
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:33,449
complete vegetable and I and his bottom
teeth look like they had taken a pair of

48
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:42,389
pliers and rearrange them and so there
was no comforting Auto this was horrible

49
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:49,740
and this noise kept he kept doing this
today we weren't prepared for this at

50
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,349
all no one would you know one how could
you be had any idea going in there what

51
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:01,620
we were gonna see his hands and legs
were totally deformed and he was you

52
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,240
know you want to say she want to say
this was not our son this was our son

53
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,710
and we're proud of him
yeah but this was our son and this was

54
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:18,719
the condition that Kim and his regime
intentionally put him in how I'm

55
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:22,370
listening me what I'm just trying to how
did he

56
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,009
how did he die specifically cousin
explained to you oh you mean in the well

57
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:35,509
oh sure um two days after Otto came home
his fever spiked to over a hundred and

58
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:38,990
four degrees
I don't had this huge scar on his right

59
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:47,780
foot he was he was on his deathbed when
he was when he came to home to us this

60
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:53,539
was not a pleasant sight this was always
a release they didn't want him to die on

61
00:06:53,539 --> 00:07:00,919
their soil how has it been explained to
you what North Korea did when you say

62
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:08,180
torture what did they do do you know we
know North Korea North Korea doesn't

63
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,940
even acknowledge that they considered it
a humanitarian gesture sending Otto home

64
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,009
his teeth looked like they had been
rearranged with a pair of pliers you can

65
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,099
only look at the evidence perfectly
healthy

66
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,110
a young American visiting there an
innocent young American comes home with

67
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,680
severe brain damage but it's not like it
happened and they shipped him home

68
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,610
immediately
it's it's a year later these people are

69
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,380
terrorists Kim and his regime
intentionally injured Otto help me

70
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,010
understand because looking at the
doctors they said you know if suffered

71
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,159
extensive loss of brain tissue
consistent with cardiopulmonary arrest

72
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:50,240
was in a state of unresponsive wake
wakefulness didn't know what causes

73
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,530
brain damage they say he didn't show any
obvious indications of trauma or

74
00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,400
evidence of either acute or healing
fractures why opt out of an autopsy

75
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,710
that's a really good question absolutely
yeah I don't and our family have been

76
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:13,820
through enough enough we were Ottawa's
abandoned by his family his country and

77
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,190
the rest of the world he was kidnapped
in North Korea he was isolated from his

78
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,789
family and the world
he was paraded in front of him there

79
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,199
puppy was human
our family and out of work humiliated by

80
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,169
the North Koreans and ultimately when
Kim made the decision otto was tortured

81
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:39,380
and essentially murder
enough enough irony Otto needs to be a

82
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:47,210
Otto is at peace and it's about time I
wasn't going to let him out of my sight

83
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:55,400
and I didn't and she did a visual our
coroner did a visual and then she's the

84
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,920
one that product that huge scar on his
foot we don't know you've no idea

85
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,510
it covered the entire top of his foot
how do you get a scar that covers the

86
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:11,810
entire top of your foot it looked like
she said it had to be an open wound for

87
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:19,100
months and months and months what is the
US government said to you we don't we

88
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,850
don't we don't engage with them at this
level and it's not that we can't we

89
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,820
don't need to ask them what condition or
what happened to Otto obviously you want

90
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,960
this as a nation what kind of what any
of any information has the government

91
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,080
given to you none none in fact in fact
we don't need it right and we're not

92
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,390
here to bad-mouth the Obama
administration the State Department any

93
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:50,839
of them this is solely the
responsibility of the Kim regime Kim and

94
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,750
his regime and nobody should go there
ever

95
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,770
nobody needs to go there it was legal he
went with the tour group

96
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,950
nobody needs to go there you know the
Wall Street Journal just went there they

97
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,710
show you what they want you to see so
why are we playing into this why do we

98
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,230
play into this at all anymore I mean I
don't want to see anyone else hurt or

99
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,270
taken that's also why you're speaking
out oh yeah how are you feeling

100
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:27,440
no I'm not I'm feeling like like I'm
getting stronger all the time I'm every

101
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,070
day I think about him I mean almost
every minute of every day I think of

102
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,290
Otto he's always going to be with me
it's a wonderful memory and I don't want

103
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:47,420
to remember Otto in North Korea or in
the hospital I have enough Fantana

104
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:55,640
stick memories of the 21 years we had
together so in my last minute you tell

105
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,020
me tell me about tell me about Auto what
we what do you think about in your bones

106
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:09,590
about your son he was a good boy he was
all boy so so again when you you have to

107
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,150
remind yourself that he wasn't perfect
and that he would call you up and talk

108
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,110
and then you realize he's scamming you
because he wants to borrow money or some

109
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,620
so he was all boy but but he was loving
and kind and we just we had fun together

110
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,620
and we we you know we were older when we
had kids we wanted to be a part of our

111
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,710
kids lives we're currently a part of our
other kids lives and so we have no

112
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,300
regrets I can honestly say that and I
would point out when aughtta was

113
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,040
kidnapped our family got together and we
had to make a decision of how we were

114
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,120
going to move forward with this new
situation and we also had to do it again

115
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,700
by the way when auto was sent home and
ultimately passed away and we buried him

116
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,530
we had to make a decision on how we're
gonna how we're gonna move forward and

117
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:08,540
we we said autos death and circumstances
are not an excuse to fail and then if

118
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,400
the reverse were true and Cindy and I
were killed we would need auto to carry

119
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,680
on to be a positive person and to do the
absolute best he could in life and

120
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,360
that's that's that's what we're charged
with as well and we're proud proud

121
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,820
people I can proud people proud parents
I have 20 seconds left just finally to

them a special day so he took them to a

126
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,950
gorge hiking at a gorge just on a day
