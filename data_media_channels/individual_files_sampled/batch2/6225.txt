Donald Trump has now announced that in addition to the federal and state level funding that will go to the hurricane recovery in Texas in Louisiana he will also personally donate 1 million dollars maybe we'll see about it because when his representative Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked by a reporter if she knew whether Trump's donation would be quote coming from his own money or from the Trump foundation Sanders said I haven't had a chance to do that to find out she also couldn't say where the money was going to be donated to or basically any information that would lead you to believe that his assurance that he's enduring this money is anything more than a offhand comment that isn't going to amount to anything now whether it comes from his money or the organization's money is not an academic question Trump hasn't personally donated to his charity since 2008 he might well not remember that it exists now it does get money donated from other people and so perhaps he'll feel free to donate a million of someone else's dollars to the hurricane recovery but I wouldn't even guarantee you that in addition about if you want to get into the idea of whether Sarah Huckabee Sanders is at all sure that this is actually gonna happen look at her response to another question she said he actually asked that I checked with the folks in this room the pressroom since you were very good at research and I've been doing a lot of reporting into the groups and organizations that are best and most effective in helping and providing aid and he'd love some suggestions from the folks here and I'd be happy to take those I mean come on mm-hmm yeah so a couple things here first of all he said the same thing after superstorm sandy and he in fact he promised Governor Chris Christie's wife that he would give a million dollars he said just tell me what the number is and I'll write to jet how much does the cheque need to be just tell me and I'll send it it's never happened guess how much he spent I said nothing don't it yeah okay the guy is a notorious pathological liar we're the best we don't need to go back that far because earlier this year he said he would donate a million dollars to a veterans group that's repeatedly pissing them off journalists thankfully followed up on that months later and only in response to that investigation did he finally donate the money when the weight of public shame was on him but he wouldn't have done it otherwise but on that one he goes oh you'll fake news I was gonna do it anyway like you know it's like the classics liar I was gonna do it anyway right but in that case at least after the shame he gave the money for sandy he said I'm going to give a million dollars he never did not a dollar nothing what I don't understand is why he keeps getting himself in the same mess over and over again you don't want to donate the money you haven't donated the money unless there was tremendous public pressure forcing you to do so so stop saying that you are going to personally donate any money look I get it there are people who will fall for it hook line and sinker they won't read the follow-ups they won't know what really goes on and they'll think oh what a stand-up guy he's donating this money but look the vast majority of people who are skeptical of his claims do follow up and they do know that he's lying about it and not only that there were veterans that were very supportive of him during the election and now they're kind of raising their eyebrows and realizing oh my god he's actually not interested in supporting us whatsoever he used us as props so he's really just hurting himself I don't want to give him advice to help him so keep doing you boo right but at the same time like it's amazing how astonishingly stupid he is well look I don't know about this so let me let me explain why he does it ain't a literal answer to your question first of all in the past when he was a celebrity no one ever followed up so he would say I'm giving a million dollars no one bothered to check six months later or a year later ever did give the million dollars and he would get headlines that'll trump sometimes they say offers a million no sometimes they say gives a million dollars and he says he never got caught on his lies he thought there's no consequences every time I give this wonderful benefit of great publicity for myself and I seem like a wonderful person and I never give the money there's no cause these idiot reporters never check up now it's different because you're president you were running for president people found out but now the problem is it's becoming pathological that's why I call him a pathological liar he can't help himself if you like if I had him here in this room and like you say whatever is provable is there a mug in front of you there could be a mug in front of him but there is it as long as it suits his purposes right and so is your hair orange no it's not it's black right he can't help himself because he's had over 70 years of lying with no consequence exactly yeah and then finally one little third part of why he does it is because there is some logic in it and say see what the Pentagon does a lot it's it's because of what I've just invented term right now disproportionate headlines so when we launch a bomb and it kills civilians the Pentagon comes out super strong and says it's not civilians because they know that's the only day anybody's gonna pay attention yeah and so all the headlines will say not civilians Pentagon says not to those that's right yeah and then we find out six days later or six weeks later Pentagon will say oh yeah well maybe it was and you know a little bit and we're still looking into it that goes in page a17 or 827 of the paper never makes it on to TV they're way past that story and then when you call them out on the line later the Pentagon goes no six weeks later I did a correction and that's Donald Trump 101 Trump gives a million dollars by the time you do the correction that's hurricane Harvey's past Sandy's past well nobody called him out on sandy until now and we also I mean we we have that in this exact thing in his family so he said he's going to give the money there's no proof he's going to his son that Eric or Joe Joe or whatever his name is he goes and says CNN's never gonna report it fake news seen in an RT reporter on it three hours early earlier I don't think a lot of people pay attention to him because look at his face but he said it and the supporters will hear it and think Oh fake news CNN and when CNN later says hey we totally reported on this even though we probably shouldn't have because there was no proof of it they're not gonna hear that because they don't watch CNN and so it works really well for him but I want to contrast a Donald Trump who is a little a weenie a guy who's not as rich as he says he is it's another reason why he continually says he's gonna donate a million dollars because that sounds like something a rich person would do and he sees actual rich charitably charitable people do it and he wants to do it so you have him saying he's gonna give a million dollars and probably never actually will but there are people who are raising a lot of money so athlete from the region JJ was football right yeah yeah God see I know he's a football player anyway he decides to help organize for fundraising and so he sets a goal of he wants to raise $200,000 for the effort which is a ton of money of course and he's not as rich as Donald Trump says he is and he does raise it $200,000 but he effed up because he just kept raising money after the $200,000 and uh this graphic is gonna be a little bit out of date you're gonna see the most recent number for that and that is over 15 million dollars he's raised as using more than one and a half million more than I saw first thing this morning and it continues to go up it will continue to go up and that is that's gonna help so many people's lives and you can see it right there you don't have to take the word of a pathological liar it's an actual and Pathak human being raising money and we've got a little bit of a video of him explaining what its gonna be used for here do you know how you're gonna go about doing that so my first phase is what I'm doing is this weekend my teammates and I we have semi trucks rolling in from out of town that we've filled up we have about nine semi trucks are gonna come into town and we have those all filled with stock supplies water food clothing everything so we're gonna give that out this weekend that's our first step and then I'm gonna regroup after this weekend because obviously like I said I was planning for 200,000 and now with a new plan for Multi multi millions I'm gonna make sure that get with the people that dig Katrina and that learn from Katrina so that I can make sure I do it right because what these people trust me with their money I want to make sure that I don't do it hastily I want to do it exactly the right way and I want people to know that that's what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take my time to make sure I do it right because I want to do right by these people that need it and I also wanted to right by the people that trust me with their money yeah and you saw there in the graphic you carrying is J / JJ Watt you can go there or you can google it if you want to also donate so JJ want arguably the best offensive player in the NFL I have no I was gonna say that I just ending we had time a obviously place for the Houston Texans which John was also going to tell you and and I have no idea what his politics him is but now I love the guy and I think part of the reason that they have given him a lot of money is because people care and they're good human beings and partly because we become so jaded by our lying politicians that you have I have a sense that I again not knowing a thing about JJ Watt his politics this person I don't know anything about him right other than he does he's excellent at defense is that you get a sense this guy's rich he's in the is an athlete in the area and he's actually doing it for the right purposes yeah and he's actually going to get them blankets in a pickup truck and he's actually gonna get them food and things they need where is the six billion dollars coming from the government is a good thing the people of Houston really need it as long as it doesn't go to the companies but exactly we don't know a lot of that money is probably gonna get funneled to ExxonMobil for their oil refineries and we've grown jaded by our incredibly corrupt politician yeah so when I got like JJ Watt doesn't like yes I'll give him money that makes sense I think he'll actually give it in aid to the people who need it exactly so I know nothing about JJ Watt I didn't even know he existed prior to right now okay but what I love about what he's doing is that it's illuminating the fact that there are a lot of really great people in this country probably in other countries I don't know if they can donate you know internationally but the fact that he raises that much money is telling right I think with everything that's going on with the rhetoric that we're seeing with the hate rallies that are happening we lose sight of the fact that there are so many great people who do want to look out for one another and for anyone who donated anyone who's actually part of the relief efforts who's volunteering their time and their resources thank you you know you give me hope personally and I hope we continue taking care of one another all right last couple of thoughts on this I'm now going to trade for the Texans defense in honor of JJ Watt in my fantasy football team and in all seriousness in his fantasies exactly is a fantasy football team so download a castle going back to doll trap for a second he is not rich he said that he has ten billion dollars if you have ten billion dollars and million dollars is nothing the fact that he has already retracted his offer to give it out of his own personal money and they're backpedaling out of that you don't even have a million if you have ten billion dollars you are the worst person on earth for trying to backpedal out of your million dollar pledge a million dollars for us is all the money in the world for if you have 10 billion knows it's nothing it's nothing you know the Think Progress tracked how much money Trump is actually giving a charity it is 0.0001 3 percent of his income well that's what Jesus said you should donate yes I remember it I remember that all ya numbers 2 T YT membership gets your commercial-free Young Turks downloaded stream it podcasts that get all the network shows and support
