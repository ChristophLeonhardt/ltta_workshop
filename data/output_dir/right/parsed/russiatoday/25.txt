there is now a clear and present danger
of an imminent and great big famine
engulfing Yemen much bigger than
anything any professional in this field
has seen during their working lives the
total number of people facing pre famine
conditions meaning they're entirely
reliant on external aid for survival
could soon reach not 11 million but 14
million that's half the total population
of the country in the absence of a
cessation of hostilities especially
around two data we're fighting for more
than four months now has damaged the key
facilities and infrastructure on which
the aid operation relies the relief
effort will ultimately be simply
overwhelmed the time surely mr.
president has come for all parties to
heed these warnings
