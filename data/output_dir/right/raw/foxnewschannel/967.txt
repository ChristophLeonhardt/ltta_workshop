IT HAPPENED AFTER MONTHS OF

7
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:16,894
DOUBTS, SPECULATIONS AND

8
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:17,395
NEGOTIATION WHILE

9
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:18,162
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE HISTORY AND

10
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:29,273
MADE THE

11
00:01:41,912 --> 00:01:42,246
HISTORY.

12
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:42,980
BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE SUMMIT WENT

13
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,514
VERY WELL EXCEEDING

14
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:43,948
EXPECTATIONS.

15
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:44,482
THE MEETINGS BETWEEN

16
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:45,216
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN

17
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,883
WERE REPORTEDLY PRODUCTIVE.

18
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:46,450
A SOLID FIRST STEP IN

19
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,051
NEGOTIATING WHAT IS THE

IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION OF

22
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:48,919
THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

23

PENINSULA.

34
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:56,360
AND IF THIS IS NOT REALLY WIDELY

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,094
REPORTED, NORTH KOREA AGREED TO

OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS THAT WERE

38
00:01:58,496 --> 00:01:59,196
KILLED DURING THE KOREAN WAR.

39
00:01:59,196 --> 00:01:59,930
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN

40
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,631
HAD THIS TO SAY AFTER SIGNING

41
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:01,198
THAT JOINT RESOLUTION.

42
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:01,699
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

43
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:02,233
SPEAK TO THE LETTER

R GOODW PROUD OF WHA TOOK

00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:03,601
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN IT

46
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,068
HAS IN THE PAST.

47
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:04,769
WE BOTH WANT TO DO SOMETHING,

48
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:05,436
AND WE HAVE DEVELOPED A VERY

49
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:05,870
SPECIAL BOND.

50
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,570
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY IMPRESSED,

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,271
VERY HAPPY AND WE ARE GOING TO

52
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:08,005
TAKE CARE OF A VERY BIG AND VERY

53
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:08,739
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD.

54
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:09,407
>> Sean: TODAY THE POSITIVE

55
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,039
REACTION CONTINUED AND THE

56
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,741
PRESIDENT REPORTED QUOTE THE

57
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,041
WORLD HAS TAKEN A

58
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:13,711
FROM POTENTIAL NUCLEAR

59
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,714
CATASTROPHE AND MORE ROCKET

60
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:19,417
LAUNCHES, NUCLEAR TESTING, OR

61
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,452
RESEARCH.

62
00:02:21,452 --> 00:02:22,787
OUR DAY TOGETHER WAS HISTORIC

63
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:24,789
AND AT LEAST TALKS OCCURRED ONLY

64
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:27,124
AFTER THE RELEASE OF THREE

65
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:29,326
AMERICAN HOSTAGES AFTER AN

66
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:31,896
AGREEMENT FROM KIM JONG UN TO

67
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,397

00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,333
TESTS AND FIRING MISSILES OVER

69
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,101
JAPAN.

70
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,335
OF COURSE NORTH KOREA'S

71
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:40,704
DESTRUCTION OF ONE OF THEIR KEY

72
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:46,477
MISSILE ON SITES.

73
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,512
ALL OF THIS IS WITHOUT ANY

74
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:51,315
CONCESSION.

75
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,517
IN MY INTERVIEW WITH

76
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:54,418
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEY EVEN

77
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:55,119
INDICATED THAT NORTH KOREANS

78
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:55,853
CONCESSIONS WILL GO MUCH DEEPER

79
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:59,156
THAN THEIR WHAT THEY SAID OPENLY

80
00:02:59,156 --> 00:02:59,757
THAN THEIR WHAT THEY SAID OPENL

81
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:00,357
OPENLY.

82
00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:01,926
>> President Trump: WE LOOK AT

83
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,828
WHAT HE HAS DONE, SO WE GOT OUR

84
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:06,564
HOUSES BACK BUT WE HAVE BLOWN UP

85
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:07,598
ONE OF THE PRIMARY TESTING

86
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:07,898
SITES.

87
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:15,539
SOME PEOPLE SAY THEIR ONLY

88
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,876
TESTING SITES.

89
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:20,177
SO IT'S THE PROCESS AND IT'S

90
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:23,514
REALLY MOVING RAPIDLY.

91
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:25,115
>> MEANWHILE SHORTLY AFTER

92
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:26,317
SIGNING THE AGREEMENT OR

93
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,953
WRAPPING UP THE TALKS,

94
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,321
PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A VERY

95
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:31,722
LENGTHY NEWS CONFERENCE GIVING

96
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:32,623
IMMEDIATE REACTION TO HIS

97
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:33,724
HISTORIC MEETING.

98
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:36,760
I GOT TO SIT IN THE SECOND ROW.

99
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,762
JIM ACOSTA WAS FOUR SEATS DOWN.

100
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,333
THEY CAN NEWS CNN, TAKE A LOOK.

101
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,133
>> President Trump: CHAIRMAN

102
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:46,504

104
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:51,876
HIS COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE

105
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:54,011
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

106
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,512
PENINSULA.

107
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,580
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO

108
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,516
THIS AS MUCH, IF NOT MORE THAN

109
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:58,916
ME.

110
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,519
WE SEE A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE FOR

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,720
NORTH KOREA.

112
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,621
THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF WHEN

113
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:10,294
WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES ARE

114
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:11,095
NO LONGER EFFECTIVE.

115
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,163
THE PRESIDENT HAS AGREED TO

116
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:15,533
MEET, HE HAS GIVEN UP SO MUCH.

117
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,334
I GIVE UP NOTHING, I'M HERE.

118
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,036
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS BUT

119
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,738
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO

120
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,273
DO SINCE WE HAVE BEEN

121
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,308
NEGOTIATING LITERALLY AROUND THE

122
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:27,478
CLOCK.

123
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:29,914
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL

124
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:33,284
PERSON AND HE WILL BE IN A LONG

125
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,819
TIME -- FOR A LONG TIME IN MY

126
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:36,120
LIFE.

127
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,721
HIS PARENTS ARE VERY GOOD

128
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,255
FRIENDS OF MINE.

129
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,524
HE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN, HE HAD A

130
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:43,060
LOT TO DO WITH WHY WE ARE HERE

131
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,928
TODAY.

132
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,364
>> OF THE PRESIDENT HAD MORE TO

133
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,333
SAY ABOUT OTTO WARMBIER IN OUR

134
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:49,934
INTERVIEW.

135
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,702
IT'S A STRATEGY OF PEACE THROUGH

136
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:54,271
STRENGTH AND A STRATEGY OF

137
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:56,340
BRIBERY AND APPEASEMENT THROUGH

138
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,509
BOWING THROUGH DICTATORS.

139
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,710
NOW TONIGHT THE SIMILARITIES

140
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,578
BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN

141
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:02,580
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE NOW

142
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,117
COMING INTO THE FLOOR.

143
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:07,918
THE WEAK AND FECKLESS

144
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:09,320
LEADERSHIP, THEY WERE LEFT TO

145
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,857
DEAL WITH A WORLD AND THE SAME

146
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:20,764
CAN BE SAID OF OBAMA'S PEOPLE OF

147
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:21,832
EARTH'S THAT GIVE THE

148
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:25,903
OPPORTUNITY TO USHER IN TRUMP.

149
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:27,204
RAGAN IS CALLING THE FORMER

150
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:29,106
SOVIET UNION AND EVIL EMPIRE

151
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:31,709
WITH MANY IN THE MEDIA FREAKING

152
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:33,744
OUT THAT THE CALIFORNIA COWBOY,

153
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:35,546
RAGAN, WAS LEADING US TOWARD A

154
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,548
NUCLEAR WAR.

155
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:38,248
LET'S GO THROUGH HISTORY.

156
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:43,320
>> THEY HAVE PREACHED THE

157
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,622
SUPREMACY OF THE STATE.

158
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:46,523
AND THE DOMINATION OF ALL

159
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:47,358
PEOPLES ON THE EARTH.

160
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:50,260
THEY ARE THE FOCUS OF EVIL ON

161
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,529
THE MODERN WORLD.

162
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,398
SO IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS, I URGE

163
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:57,501
YOU TO BE AWARE OF THE

164
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,637
TEMPTATION OF PRIDE AND

165
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,505
TEMPTATION OF LIVELY DECLARING

166
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:11,715
YOURSELVES ABOVE IT ALL AND

167
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,117
EQUALLY AT FAULT.

168
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:14,718
THEREBY REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE

169
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,387
STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG

170
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,422
AND GOOD AND EVIL.

171
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:21,125
>> Tucker: JUST MONTHS AGO

172
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,726
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO ENGAGED IN

173
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,328
TOUGH RHETORIC CALLING

174
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,130
KIM JONG UN, LITTLE ROCKET MAN.

175
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,534
JUST LIKE REAGAN, HE WENT INTO A

176
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:31,802
COMPLETE MELTDOWN ONCE AGAIN

177
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:37,708
PREDICTING A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN.

178
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,308
>> President Trump:

179
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,511
NORTH KOREA DOES NOT MAKE ANY

180
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:41,712
THREATS TOWARD THE

181
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,314
UNITED STATES, THEY WILL BE MET

182
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:46,550
WITH FIRE, FURY AND POWER, THE

183
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,620
LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS

184
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,122
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

185
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:53,323
FRANKLY, THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

186
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,525
QUESTIONING THAT STATEMENT,

187
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,326
MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.

188
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:57,928
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS TO OUR

189
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:59,563
COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME FOR MANY

190
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:01,298
YEARS AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT

191
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:05,169
PEOPLE SUCK UP TO THE COUNTRY

192
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:05,703
AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

193
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,171
WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING AWAY

194
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:10,174
WITH IS A TRAGEDY AND CAN'T BE

195
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:10,774
ALLOWED.

196
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,443
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS IN GUAM,

197
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:15,145
THERE WILL BE BIG, BIG TROUBLE

198
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:18,582
IN NORTH KOREA.

199
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:19,349
HE DOES ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO

200
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,287
MAMA OR ANYPLACE ELSE THAT IS AN

201
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:30,327
AMERICAN TERRITORY OR AMERICAN

202
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,763
ALLY, HE WILL REGRET IT.

203
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:35,399
>> Tucker: THEY RAMPED UP

204
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,334
MILITARY SPENDING, MILITARY

205
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:38,602
DRILLS AND MILITARY PRESENCE AND

206
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:40,904
REAFFIRMED COMMITMENTS TO SHIELD

207
00:07:40,904 --> 00:07:42,539
OUR ALLIES FROM HOSTILE

208
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:43,540
ADVERSARIES.

209
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,542
ONE WAY OR SIMILARITY COMES FROM

210
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,111
THE TWO PRESIDENTS' WILLINGNESS

211
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:50,114
TO WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

212
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:50,681
AND BEFORE ULTIMATELY

213
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,518
NEGOTIATING THE END OF THE COLD

214
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:57,521
WAR, PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY FROM

215
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,123
TALKS WITH MIKAL GORBACHEV.

216
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,758
A FEW WEEKS AGO PRESIDENT TRUMP

217
00:08:00,758 --> 00:08:02,126
CANCELED THE SUMMIT OVER A

218
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:03,093
DISPUTE AND HAS FREQUENTLY

219
00:08:03,093 --> 00:08:04,528
ASSERTED HIS WILLINGNESS TO WALK

220
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,530
AWAY FROM A BAD DEAL.

221
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,732
AND A BONUS, BOTH REAGAN AND

222
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:11,368
TRUMP OVERSAW A BOOMING

223
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,803
ECONOMIES, BOTH IMPLEMENTING

224
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:15,773
SIGNIFICANT TAX REFORM, TAX

225
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:22,579
CUTS, REMOVING BIRDING SOME

226
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,515
REGULAR REGULATIONS.

227
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:27,117
THE MEDIA SAW THIS COMING, WE

228
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,118
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED.

229
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:30,320
BUT THESE WERE THE SAME PEOPLE.

230
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,722
THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT

231
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:32,722
DONALD TRUMP WINNING THE

232
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,558
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY AND LAUGHING

233
00:08:34,558 --> 00:08:37,327
WHEN HE GOT INTO THE RACE.

234
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,530
AND AT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE

235
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,933
WRONG ABOUT TRUMP AND RUSSIA

236
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,567
COLLUSION IN THE SO-CALLED

237
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:43,900
SCANDAL.

238
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,136
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ONLY ONE

239
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:47,571
COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS WAS

240
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,705
HILLARY CLINTON.

241
00:08:48,705 --> 00:08:51,041
OF COURSE THEY ARE COMPLETELY

242
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:56,713
OBSESSED WITH ANYTHING TABLOID.

243
00:08:56,713 --> 00:09:00,984
>> THIS COULD BE THE LAST NAIL

244
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:03,587
IN THE COFFIN.

245
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:04,955
>> STORMY DANIELS CLAIMS

246
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,456
PRESIDENT TRUMP BROKE THE LAW

247
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:09,126
AND HAD HER BOWLING TO.

248
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:10,928
>> DOES STORMY DANIELS HAVE THE

249
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:11,929
PRESIDENT'S NUMBER?

250
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,330
IT SEEMS THAT WAY.

251
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,335
>> HOW HIS STORMY WEATHERING

252
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,635
THIS?

253
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:19,369
>> STORMY SPEAKS.

254
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:22,739
>> ARE YOU SHOCKED OR SURPRISED

255
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:23,073
BY THIS?

256
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:26,877
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED, IN ONE WAY

257
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:27,878
I AM PROUD OF.

258
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:30,314
>> WE ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL,

259
00:09:30,314 --> 00:09:32,516
AT LEAST NOT IF YOU ARE BORN IN

260
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:41,124
AS THE PRESIDENT PUT IT, A

261
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:41,625
[BLEEP] COUNTRY.

262
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:46,496
>> IS THERE A DIFFERENT, IF THE

263
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,932
PRESIDENT SAID LEAP HOLE AND

264
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:50,133
LEAP HOUSE?

265
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,869
>> APPARENTLY NOT.

266
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:55,272
LISTEN TO HOW THE CNN FAKE NEWS

267
00:09:55,272 --> 00:09:58,909
PANEL COVERED THE SUMMIT.

268
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,410
>> I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO

269
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,746
THE MENU NOT BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY

270
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:03,447
BUT BECAUSE TYPICALLY THE

271
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,649
WHITE HOUSE RELEASES THIS KIND

272
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:06,450
OF DETAILS AFTER FOR EXAMPLE THE

273
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,185
FRENCH PRESIDENT COMES TO THE

274
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:09,119
WHITE HOUSE OR ANOTHER HEAD OF

275
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,355
STATE COMES FOR A STATE VISIT.

276
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,557
SO BY RELEASING THE DETAILS OF

277
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:16,760
THE MENU, THIS IS A LEGITIMIZING

278
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,160
KIM JONG UN.

279
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,964
>> ONE PARTICULAR THING, THE

280
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:24,134
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE, IF THEY

281
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,502
KNEW WHAT WAS BEING DISHED OUT

282
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:26,637
THERE, THEY CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

283
00:10:26,637 --> 00:10:27,671
THE TYPES OF FOODS THAT YOU HAVE

284
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:30,507
ROLLED OFF OF YOUR TONGUE.

285
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:31,541
>> RIGHT.

286
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,545
IT'S A POOR COUNTRY, BECAUSE OF

287
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:36,947
KIM JONG UN, HIMSELF AND HIS

288
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:37,948
COUNTRY.

289
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:41,318
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, BEEF SHORT

290
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,921
RIBS, A COMBINATION OF CRISPY

291
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:48,525
PORK, I MEAN, THAT IS -- IT

292
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,127
SOUNDS REALLY YUMMY AND VERY

293
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:50,727
EXPENSIVE.

294
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:53,330
>> IT SOUNDS YUMMY AND

295
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,697
EXPENSIVE.

296
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:54,097
THAT'S NEWS?

297
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,934
AND OF COURSE, THAT'S ONLY THE

298
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,536
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

299
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:05,709
>> AND SOME IT IS NOT A MAJOR

300
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:06,910
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

301
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,279
THE SPECTACLE OF SEEING THIS

302
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,950
AMERICAN FLAGS IS REALLY JARRING

303
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,685
ACTUALLY TO SEE AND WITNESS.

304
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:16,987
IN FACT I WOULD SAY IT'S

305
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:19,556
SOMEWHAT DISGUSTING AND IT'S A

306
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:21,725
DEBASEMENT OF THE AMERICAN FLAG.

307
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,327
THIS IS A DESPOTIC REGIME THAT

308
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:24,728
MURDERS ITS OWN CITIZENS AND SO

309
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:27,631
WE ARE PUTTING THEM ON THE SAME

310
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,299
STAGE AS THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT.

311
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:35,339
>> I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD --

312
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,208
IT'S NOT REALIZING THAT

313
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,010
COUNTRIES HAVE INTEREST.

314
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,645
KIM JONG UN DID A VERY GOOD JOB

315
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:42,713
OF REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF

316
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:44,147
HIS NATION AND HIS OWN PERSONAL

317
00:11:44,147 --> 00:11:47,284
INTEREST AND HE SNICKERED

318
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:47,718
DONALD TRUMP.

319
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,553
>> HE MAY BE OKAY IN THE

320
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:50,654
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS BUT IT'S

321
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:51,755
ODIOUS AND DISGUSTING WHEN HE'S

322
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:54,191
FAWNING OVER ONE OF THE MOST

323
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,126
VICIOUS DICTATORS ON THE PLANET.

324
00:11:56,126 --> 00:12:00,330
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLL,

325
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,332
THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

326
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:02,899
RUSSIA.

327
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:05,936
THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

328
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,738
ISSUES AT HOME.

329
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:12,809
>> Tucker: THIS HATRED CLEARLY

330
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:13,543
BORDERS ON PSYCHOSIS.

331
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:15,946
EVERY ANCHOR WOULD BE HERE 24/7

332
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,415
AND THEY WOULD ALL BE -- THEY

333
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:20,417
WOULD TRAVEL 50 HOURS IN THE AIR

334
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,151
FOR THAT.

335
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:23,687
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT

336
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:24,955
ON MSNBC.

337
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,757
THEY WEREN'T HERE.

338
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,592
RACHEL MADDOW, CHRIS HAYES,

339
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:28,992
JOLIE MIKA?

340
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:32,295
TOO LONG ON THE PLANE FOR YOU.

341
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:35,365
PLUS IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR FAULTS

342
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,366
NARRATIVE, YOUR CARICATURE AND

343
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:37,467
THE LIES YOU MANUFACTURE EVERY

344
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:42,939
SINGLE DAY.

345
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:43,774
MEANWHILE, THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

346
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,575
PUSH FOR PEACE IN NORTH KOREA A

347
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:47,210
FEW YEARS AGO, THEY WERE

348
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,912
STEPPING ALL OVER THEMSELVES TO

349
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:51,415
PRAISE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS

350
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,550
HORRIBLY FLAWED AND DEFUNCT

351
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,352
IRANIAN DEAL, WHICH IS THE

352
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:59,956
DUMBEST DEAL IN WORLD HISTORY.

353
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:00,690
$150 BILLION TO RADICAL MULLAHS

354
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,025
IN IRAN, AND CHANTING DEATH TO

355
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:04,561
AMERICA, DEATH TO ISRAEL?

356
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:07,130
IT DOESN'T GET ANY DUMBER THAN

357
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,431
THIS.

358
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:10,133
BUT THEY ALL IN THE MEDIA LOVE

359
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:10,901
IT.

360
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:11,301
TAKE A LOOK.

361
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,736
>> OF THE U.S. AND WORLD POWER

362
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,871
IS REACHING A MAJOR AGREEMENT

363
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:16,373
WITH IRAN.

364
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:17,574
WATCHING ONE OF OUR BIGGEST

365
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:19,976
RIVALS FROM DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR

366
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:20,310
WEAPON.

367
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,079
>> THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO

368
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,514
DELIVER A STATEMENT ON THIS

369
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:26,049
HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL REACHED

370
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:26,850
WITH IRAN OVERNIGHT.

371
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,018
DISAGREEMENT IS SUPPOSED TO

372
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,754
FREEZE THAT COUNTRY'S PURSUIT OF

373
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,189
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

374
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:35,325
>> HAS THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES

375
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,928
SUCCESSFULLY BLOCKED THE NUCLEAR

376
00:13:37,928 --> 00:13:39,329
BOMB FOR NOW?

377
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,933
>> I THINK IT BEGINS TO CHANGE

378
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,534
THE DYNAMICS OF A TENSE

379
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,803
RELATIONSHIP OF 36 YEARS BETWEEN

380
00:13:46,803 --> 00:13:48,738
WASHINGTON AND TEHRAN.

381
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:51,208
I THINK THE DEAL PROVIDES MORE

382
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,375
THAN THE UNITED STATES

383
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,743
ANTICIPATED AND IT COULD PREVENT

384
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:56,012
AN ARMS RACE IN THE REGION THAT

385
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:58,415
WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO NOT JUST

386
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,349
OF THE LEAST BUT THE WHOLE

387
00:13:59,349 --> 00:13:59,749
WORLD.

388
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:01,151
>> Tucker: IT SEEMS LIKE THEY

389
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,752
ALL HAD THAT CHRIS MATTHEWS

390
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,454
THRILL RUNNING UP AND DOWN HER

391
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:05,622
LEG.

392
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:07,324
OBVIOUSLY THIS MEDIA IS

393
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:08,391
INCAPABLE OF COVERING THIS

394
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:10,727
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN

395
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,529
ANY FAIR AND UNBIASED WAY.

396
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:14,231
AND IN THAT SENSE, HIS SUCCESS

397
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,532
WAS THEIR FAILURE.

398
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,634
HE WOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THEY WERE

399
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:17,934
WRONG.

400
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:22,739
IN DOING SO, IF THEY WERE

401
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,942
CORRECT, THE WORLD WOULD BE LEFT

402
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,511
FAITH.

403
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,546
SO FAR, BETTING AGAINST

404
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:31,181
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT BEEN

405
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:31,882
WORKING OUT PARTICULARLY WELL

406
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,750
FOR ANY OF THEM.

407
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,518
THEY ARE GETTING EVERYTHING

408
00:14:34,518 --> 00:14:35,152
WRONG.

409
00:14:35,152 --> 00:14:37,154
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO

410
00:14:37,154 --> 00:14:38,421
START ASKING THEMSELVES, WHAT IS

411
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,557
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

412
00:14:40,557 --> 00:14:41,958
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND

413
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,361
MAYBE THEY SHOULD JUST KEEP

414
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,129
PUSHING THEIR RADICAL LEFTIST

415
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:46,463
AGENDA.

416
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:51,568
TRUMP WOULD BE AN UNMITIGATED

417
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:51,935
DISASTER.

418
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:54,971
LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN, AND AS WE

419
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:57,774
POINTED OUT MANY TIMES THIS WAS

420
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:00,544
ESPECIALLY TRUE ON THE ECONOMY.

421
00:15:00,544 --> 00:15:01,945
THEY GENERATED WEALTH LIKE NEVER

422
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:03,613
BEFORE AND THAT IS WHY TONIGHT

423
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:05,549
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT PROGRESS

424
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:06,950
WILL HAPPEN ON THE KOREAN

425
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:07,350
PENINSULA.

426
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,152
IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY AND GOOD

427
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:09,953
FOR THE WORLD.

428
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:12,222
PROGRESS MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE

429
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:12,722
KOREAN PENINSULA.

430
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:14,424
LOOK AT THE MAP RIGHT THERE ON

431
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,527
YOUR SCREEN.

432
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,629
IT MERELY TOPS 10 MILLION PEOPLE

433
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:21,364
MAKING IT MORE POPULOUS THAN

434
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,399
EVEN NEW YORK CITY.

435
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,334
SOUL IS ONLY LOCATED 35 MILES

436
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:27,571
AWAY FROM THE DMZ, WELL WITHIN

437
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:28,738
STRIKING DISTANCE OF KIM JONG UN

438
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,440
AND ONLY MILES AWAY FROM TENS OF

439
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,142
THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS

440
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,878
WHO WERE TASKED WITH PROTECTING

441
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:36,513
SOUTH KOREA.

442
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:39,950
ONE NUCLEAR WEAPON COULD WIPE IT

443
00:15:39,950 --> 00:00:00,000
OFF THE FACE OF THE PLANET.
