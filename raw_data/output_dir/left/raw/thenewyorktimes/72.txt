00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,216
[loud knocking]

2
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:15,730
“The government has
separated 2,000 kids

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,690
from their parents.”

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,680
“They are being held in
so-called tender-age

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,300
shelters.”

6
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:29,350
“Some of these kids might
not never potentially be

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:32,305
reunited with their mothers.”

8
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,330
“Even after all the
trauma and separation

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,040
that these kids
just went through,

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,702
their nightmare is
only getting worse.”

11
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:54,045
“Illegal entry is a crime,
as determined by Congress.”

12
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,230
“Every child that crosses
the border without permission

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,680
has an immigration
court case to fight.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,959
The U.S. government is
actually expecting

15
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,510
these children, as
young as 18 months,

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,240
unable to speak, to
represent themselves

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,166
in court against a
government attorney.”

18
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,150
“Everyone in America,
including non-citizens,

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,490
have a right to fair trial.

20
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,640
However, under this
administration,

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,300
immigration judges are under
pressure to meet quotas.

22
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,800
They’re expected to close
700 cases every year,

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,550
and we’re seeing that
children’s cases are

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,010
being sped up.”

25
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,300
“We were recently in court
with a 3-year-old.”

26
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:30,720
“She can’t say anything,
not even her name.”

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,132
“The child can’t even sit
on the chair by herself.”

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,250
“We have to physically
pick up the child

29
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,463
and place her on the chair.”

30
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,080
“Some of them
talk about seeing

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,970
family members murdered.

32
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,400
It’s not uncommon for us to
have a 5-year-old describe

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,820
to us what a dead body
on the street looks like,

34
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,500
or how he heard bullets
from a gun being shot.

35
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
For many of these
kids, if they

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
get ordered deported, going
back to their home country

37
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,280
could mean death.”

38
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,760
“It’s up to Congress to
act, and give children

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,300
the right to attorneys
in immigration court.

40
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,240
These children are fighting,
not just to stay here,

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,500
but to live.

42
00:03:40,500 --> 00:00:00,000
They deserve at least a
chance to a fair fight.”
