allegations of sexual misconduct are nothing new at Yale's Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity the frat which claims both Bush presidents as members shot into the national spotlight eight years ago when videos emerged online of brothers chanting profanities about consent and rape after that incident sixteen men and women filed a complaint with the Department of Education they alleged that Yale was allowing a sexually hostile environment for its students the office for civil rights which is a part of the Department of Education stepped in and they launched an investigation and shortly after Yale actually sanctioned the fraternity they suspended it for a period of five years today women I've spoken with on Yale's campus have told me that not all that much has changed women describe because having this reputation of being placed that they say they warn one another about not going alone certainly not if they've had a little bit too much to drink fraternities are really powerful organizations on Yale's campus they hold a lot of the social capital oftentimes the members of this fraternity are popular charismatic men on campus and women describe feeling uncertain about reporting will somehow stigmatize them on campus some of these women decide not to actually file formal complaints they talk about a lack of faith in institutional support at Yale and they don't believe that the university-wide Committee on sexual misconduct will adequately or appropriately adjudicate their claims of sexual assault sororities on campus have said they use their collective power together as a cohort to really shine a light on fraternities they feel are letting women down and in turn they've seen some profound changes they have anonymous Google forums that senior leadership sends out to any of the members of the sorority they fill out specific individuals either personally had a negative altercation with or if they know a close friend who's experienced something similar they'll add that person to the list since 2011 when the university instituted its university-wide Committee on sexual misconduct there have been more than 60 complaints of sexual misconduct so in some cases the whisper networks don't protect against every single incident I think women recognize that without strong institutional support their efforts can only go so far
