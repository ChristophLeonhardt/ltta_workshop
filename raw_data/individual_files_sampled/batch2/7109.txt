so today Ryan's Enki cabinet member for Donald Trump comes out and goes yeah surely we're gonna do it everywhere we're gonna do it offshore off the Atlantic off the Pacific in a Gulf Coast where we already had disastrous and just everywhere you could imagine in fact let me read you the details interior secretary Ryan's inky has proposed a sweeping new offshore drilling plan aimed at opening huge swaths of the Arctic the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to oil exploration the draft plan released Thursday includes 25 of 26 offshore planning areas it makes available for at least roughly 90% of the u.s. outer continental shelf in other words have at it Hoss drill anywhere you want right off the coast of Florida tourism fishing all other things that people rely on who cares do you guys pay me you're a small business you run a hotel on the water or you run a restaurant on the water I don't care about you you're not my donors the fossil fuel industry oil and gas those guys are our donors big-time donors we're gonna let them drill everywhere even the conservative Republican governors of South Carolina and Florida are like no don't do this this is a really really bad idea they don't care last month interior also abruptly cut off funding for the National Academies of Sciences engineering and medicine to study offshore drilling in an effort to identify ways to avoid another disaster like Deepwater Horizon let that sink in for a second they cut off the funding to study how do you prevent other disasters if you're gonna drill can we at least have scientists and engineers looking into how to prevent disasters nope nope don't care just run wild run wild and if you spill into the ocean who cares did the ocean give me a donation no it didn't he's literally trying to turn our oceans into the swamps that he claimed he was against there are no bounds with this guy so this is the the drilling and it's an absolute disaster then you turn that's the interior sex today you turn to Scott Pruett who runs the Environmental Protection Agency and I just want to give you guys a sense of what he's done over the last year it fits - this story is a matter of how they deal with the environment within days of taking office the Washington Post explains Pruitt cancelled the EPA's request that nearly 20,000 oil and gas companies gauge their emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas yeah why would you want to measure methane I mean that is not only terrible for the environment and and for climate change but potentially toxic who cares well let all the kids have methane great we appreciate it you don't want they don't want to investigate any of this you know why they keep firing the scientists cuz they're afraid of what they're fine not like oh now they're releasing methane now we've got to do something about it and it's gonna cost my donors some money I don't want it to cost money I want them to be able to poison the environment any way they like just fire the scientists be done with it okay so the following month he was true a proposed ban on a commonly used pesticide great pesticide that might poison the food that we have at it Hoss and on Wednesday a separate federal appeals court in California ordered the agency to quickly issue new standards to protect children from lead and pain rejecting the Trump administration's position that a new rule on acceptable levels of exposure could take six years you get that so they had a rule they had to do a rule on how do we get the lead out of the paint so the kids don't suffer lead poisoning which stunts their growth and development and their mental capability forever and by the way makes people more violent - and the Trump administration is like I don't really want to study that so I'm gonna delayed for six years because if your kids get lead poisoning what why care are they my donors is your six-year-old my donor don't care okay so all these toxic industries they're my daughters I care your kids couldn't give it could care less but now the courts are making them do something about letting the pain okay now we got more no longer with the EPA be second guessing this is about a company in Michigan DTE Energy's emission projections they explained rather it would accept the firm's intent to manage its pollution without requiring an enforceable agreement so this is an example of they take a particular company and they're saying okay you've got a mission problems so they that's what the government said before should you fix it they go no we're gonna trust your intent without any enforcement that you guys will fix it at some point anyways to check in yet checks in great job keep going okay now let's go to their reaction for flooding and sea level rise Obama signed an executive order in 2015 required the federal government consider sea level rises storm surge when designing infrastructure and building in flood prone areas just days before hurricane Harvey hit Texas Trump signed an executive order revoking Obama's order oops it was the chance that the you dam flooding in a major city oops it happened days after does he care doesn't care all he wants to do is work for his donors one week after the camp at Standing Rock was clear details of the Trump administration's proposed budget emerged calling for a complete dismantling of their environmental protection agency's office of environmental justice this is probably the least surprising environmental just poor people suffer the effects of lead poisoning toxicity poison in the in the water and in the air far more often Trump's like yeah and yeah I don't wanted to go to rich me but won't go to poor people disbanded immediately okay then in March an EPA Administrator Scott Pruett suspended new chemical plant safety rules that would have helped prevent and mitigate accidents at petrochemical facilities and protects surrounding communities where residents are disproportionately low-income and minority I mean chemical plant protection why would you need that know disbanded that happened in March on August 31st a chemical plant in Crosby Texas was rocked with explosions after being flooded by hurricane Harvey it's safety at a chemical blend how about that one that just exploded oops yet in other hoops but it's not a noobs mission accomplished what do you mean I lowered the costs for the industry Oh your local plant exploded and by the way cops got hurt their first responders got hurt and and that all those chemicals went in the air all the families that live nearby got hurt who cares they're not Trump stoners just keep deregulating this is what deregulating means you know what regulations are their rules their laws meant to protect you it doesn't mean they're all perfect but overall the idea is to protect your families and Trump is saying no we're not going to do that all we're gonna do is protect business interests all right we're getting near the end here the trumpet and it is exhausting list of things that they have deregulated and allowed to poison us the Trump administration halted a mountaintop mining health risk study by the National Academy of Sciences in August West Virginia officials had asked for the study after scientists described increased risks of cancer and birth defects near surface coal mining operations and Pruitt and Trump were like yeah but I don't live in West Virginia so that's increased cancer risk for you and the coal mining industry gave me money they gave me campaign contributions your kids with the increased cancer they didn't give me anything so I won't even let you study it if you get the cancer I rather not find out now one last thing for you guys in terms of what Scott Pruitt's priorities are at the EPA get a lot of who he's met with and it might give you a sense of what he values he has met with as you see on the left there environmental and public health groups 12 times since he's been in office you should meet with those guys and by the way you should meet with business interests as well you should weigh all that and balance it and figure out what the right amount of regulation is so he's met with those guys 12 times as you can see in the middle he's met with the fossil fuel industry and agriculture and other industries 218 times gee I wonder where his priorities lie I can't quite tell I mean look if you said to me a Democratic administration is not meeting with industry enough and then to be even I don't know that it should be even I think that you your the job of the EPA is to protect us that we're their constituents not those corporations but if you said hey make it even meet with the public health groups and the environmental groups and the scientists as much as you meet with industry I'd say okay that's fine nothing wrong with that but just flip it on its head and meet with all the businesses that have donated to you 218 times and meet with people who actually want to protect the environment 12 times you know that Scott Perot goes around the country he brags that he's been in 30 states already EPA has 10 regional offices you know how many of the regional offices he stepped into zero because he doesn't care he's going to meet with donors he doesn't go into the regional offices because he doesn't want them to do the work he wants to shut them down if you thought Trump was going to be a disaster for the environment it was a gross understatement just a debacle in every imaginable way so we've now set the clock back four years not just on climate change and addressing it but into literally our pollution in our air and our water and and cancer and lead poisoning and and methane and all of these things and now on top of that Zinke cut comes in today and says by the way we're also gonna ruin the oceans I told you to brace for impact and here it is this is impact you just watch the video by the young turks the home of the revolution if you'd like to get the full show
