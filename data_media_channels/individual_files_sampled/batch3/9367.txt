DREAM TO DEMOCRATS PROMISED A BLUE WAVE DURING THE 2018 MIDTERMS AND AS WE SAW THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS READY TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY FOR MORE PACKED TO THE RAFTERS CAMPAIGN RALLY. A LOOK AT THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS COMING UP THIS WEEK. WITHOUT THEM WE BRING IN OUR TALK RADIO PANEL ROSS KAMINSKY, RADIO HOST OUT OF THE GREAT CITY OF DENVER, COLORADO AND BERLIN MIX IN HERE IN WASHINGTON. NICE TO SEE YOU. THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS OUT FOR THESE CAMPAIGN RALLIES IN THE PLACES HE IS GOING AS NO SURPRISE. INDIANA BEFORE THE PRIMARY IN OHIO BEFORE THE PRIMARY THERE. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS ARE VIEWING 2018? I THINK IT SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE VERY PRO-TRAMPLING OF THE PARTY AND THE THE LESS PRO-TRAMPLING OF THE PARTY TO AGREE ON A CANDIDATE TO THEN ACCOMPLISH THEIR MORE FUNDAMENTAL MISSION OF BEATING A DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER. I THOUGHT THE INDIANA THING IN PARTICULAR A COUPLE DAYS AGO WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. LELAND: TO THAT POINT AND WE WILL STAY ON THIS PARTICULARLY IN COLORADO THIS IS AN ISSUE IN 2010 WHEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PICKED SOMEBODY SO FAR TO THE RIGHT THAT IT MADE AN EASY RACE UNWINNABLE. YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT AGAIN FOR HIS PRESIDENT TRUMP THE ABILITY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING THOSE TWO PARTS OF THE PARTY TOGETHER? THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE'VE SEEN THAT A FEW TIMES IN COLORADO. IF YOU PREPARE WEST VIRGINIA AND OHIO AND INDIANA, YOU SEE A REPUBLICAN ALIKE DREAD THAT'S FAIRLY RATIONAL. I THINK YOU SAW A GUY WHO COULDN'T WADE IN NOVEMBER ARE LOSING WEST VIRGINIA WHEREAS A BUSINESSMAN AND INDIANA BEAT TO IT, CONGRESSMAN, MAYBE THEY SPLIT THE VOTE, BUT IN THE CASE YOU ARE SEEING REPUBLICANS BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEVER THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. LELAND: NOTEWORTHY IN WEST VIRGINIA THE PRESIDENT CAME ON AND SAID THE CANDIDATE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ISN'T GOING TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. THEY'LL VOTE FOR ONE OF THE OTHER TWO GUYS AND PEOPLE LISTEN. I WILL FLIP THE QUESTION AROUND. AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE PROGRESSIVES RUNNING IN THESE PRIMARIES, SOME WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN CANDIDATES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. IF THEY'RE THE SAME RISK ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAT YOU'LL END UP WITH SUCH PROGRESSIVE AND FAR LEFT CANDIDATE THAT THEY MAY BE GREAT FOR THE BASE, BUT TERRIBLE COME NOVEMBER. I DON'T THINK SO. LELAND: REALLY? THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SHOW WHAT APPEARED THE QUESTION IS IN WHAT NUMBERS. LELAND: WHAT DEMOCRATS, WHAT DEMOCRATS, WHAT DEMOCRATS FROM A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT THAN FAR LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE THE MORE MODERATE DEMOCRATS? PART OF IT IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ANTI-TRUMP THE WILL SHOW UP AND VOTE DEMOCRAT. THE QUESTION FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS GOING TO BE THIS. AT SOME TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE MIDTERMS, WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH A CONCRETE ECONOMIC POLICY AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY RUN A NON-WE ARE NOT TRUMP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UPSET AND ANGRY. RIGHT NOW BOTH PARTIES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SHIFTED FROM A TOP-DOWN TOTALLY TO FOREIGN POLICY. WHICHEVER PARTY GOES BACK TO ECONOMIC POLICY AND FOCUSES ON THAT GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, IT HAS A LOT OF SUCCESS. LELAND: JAMES CARVILLE IS THAT IT'S THE ECONOMY,. LOOK AT THE GENERIC HOLE RIGHT NOW FROM CBS NEWS DID REPUBLICAN 41%, DEMOCRATS 50%. UNSURE, NO ANSWER 3%. DOES IT SCARE YOU A LITTLE BIT THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE AT NINE POINTS UNDERWATER IN THIS? YES AND NO. OF COURSE IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN, IT WOULD SCARE YOU AND FOR THE RECORD I'M UNAFFILIATED THAT I TEND TO LEAN TO THE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT. I ALSO SEE POSITIVE TRENDS IN VARIOUS GENERIC POLLS, REPUBLICANS DOING BETTER THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST. REGARDING THE COMMENT ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY, I THINK THE JOB ALL IN ALL THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN NORTH KOREA. YOU DON'T ONLY HAVE THESE ELECTIONS ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY UNLESS YOU ARE AT WAR. THIS COULD BE AN OUTLIER AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE WITH NORTH KOREA, AND THE KOREAN WAR AND STARTS TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION. I CAN HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT. LELAND: WE HAVE SEEN DEMOCRATS ON ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT A NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS IN THE WORDS OF ONE YESTERDAY BUT DIDN'T KILL THE UNIT GOT TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE ABOUT BRINGING HOSTAGES HOME.
