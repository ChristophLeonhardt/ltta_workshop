IN COMMON.

23
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:28,245
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

24
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,047
IN THE LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

25
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:30,347
TODAY.

00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:31,749
CHRISTIAN REPORTED ON IT AND HAD

27
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:32,183
SOME PASSAGES.

28
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:34,685
INCLUDING THIS ONE AS WELL.

29
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,086
THE PRESIDENT SAYS, YOU TALK

30
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,254
ABOUT YOUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES,

31
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:38,722
BUT OURS EVER SO MASSIVE AND

32
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,224
POWERFUL THAT I PRAY TO GOD THEY

33
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:42,026
WILL NEVER HAVE TO BE USED.

34
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:45,362
DO YOU THINK -- THEY WERE

35
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,363
CARROTS AND STICKS IN THIS

36
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,064
LETTER.

37
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,299
WHAT WORKS BETTER WITH

38
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:48,699
NORTH KOREA?

39
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:50,634
>> WHAT ICS PROMISES MADE,

40
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,671
PROMISES KEPT.

41
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:57,107
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT IF THE

42
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,275
NEGOTIATIONS COULD LEAD TO

43
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,043
DENUCLEARIZATION, THE REMOVAL OF

44
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,878
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THAT HE WOULD

45
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:01,245
WITHDRAW.

46
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,013
IN FACT, THIS WEEK, WE KNOW THAT

47
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,683
THE NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN

48
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,184
MINISTER ACTUALLY ISSUED A

49
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:09,286
THROAT AND SO THE PRESIDENT I

50
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:10,688

00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:11,322
THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENA

56
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:11,689

THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENO

61
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:12,456
THINK ACTED DECISIVELY AND THENS

62
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:14,158
THAT NORTH KOREA ACTUALLY SAYS

63
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,026
WE'LL MEET ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.

64
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:17,127
>> Shannon: IS INTERESTING HOW

65
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,395
QUICKLY THAT TURNED AROUND,

66
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:19,330
COMING FROM THE VICE FOREIGN

67
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,364
MINISTER TONIGHT, SAYING, THIS

68
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:21,699
ISN'T THE WAY WE THOUGHT THIS

69
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:23,601
WAS GOING TO GO, LET'S GET BACK

70
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,668
TOGETHER AND KEEP TALKING.

71
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,003
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE FACT THAT

72
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,705
THE LEFT HAS JUMPED ON THIS?

73
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,874
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER,

74
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,041
SAYING, HE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE A

75
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,876
NOBEL PRIZE, HE DOESN'T KNOW

76
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:35,045
WHAT HE'S DOING.

77
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,080
EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON

78
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,548
THE LEFT HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE

79
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:38,682
GLAD THE PRESIDENT WALKED AWAY,

80
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,550
THE RIGHT THING FOR HIM TO DO.

81
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,620
HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S

82
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,920
DOING.

83
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,856
>> IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF TRUMP

84
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,423
DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

85
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,659
THE GOOD NEWS FOR THE AMERICAN

86
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,095
PEOPLE, WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP

87
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:51,729

POMPEO, AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON,

89
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,200
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY.

90
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,068
A TEAM IN PLACE THAT WILL

91
00:01:58,068 --> 00:01:58,969
PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES.

92
00:01:58,969 --> 00:01:59,904
>> Shannon: I WANT TO READ THE

93
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:00,971
STATEMENT WE ARE GETTING FROM

94
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:02,506
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, THE

95
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:04,308
FIRST VICE FOREIGN MINISTER.

96
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,243
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING TONIGHT.

97
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:07,878
"THE ABRUPT ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE

98
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,079
CANCELLATION OF THE MEETING IS

99
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,514
UNEXPECTED FOR US.

100
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,516
WE CANNOT BUT FIND IT EXTREMELY

101
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:12,917
REGRETTABLE.

102
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,218
WE AGAIN STATED TO THE U.S. OUR

103
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:15,719
WILLINGNESS TO SIT FACE-TO-FACE

104
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,322
AT ANY TIME, IN ANY FORM, TO

105
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:19,323
RESOLVE THE PROBLEM."

106
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:21,325
HOW QUICKLY DO YOU THINK THE

107
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:22,526
WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE OR DOES

108
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,094
THIS GET BACK ON TRACK?

109
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,596
DOES THE JUNE 12TH DAVE TOLD?

110
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:28,532
TO THE HOLD OUT FOR A BIT?

111
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,199
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

112
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,835
>> AGAIN, THE GOOD NEWS, WHETHER

113
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,170
IT BE JUNE 12 THERE WERE NEVER

114
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,273
COME OF THE DOOR IS STILL OPEN.

115
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,007
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN AN

116
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:42,446
ACHIEVEMENT, THE RELIEF OF

117
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:46,083
RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES, I AM

118
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,484
SO PROUD OF DONALD TRUMP AND THE

119
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,053
DIFFERENCES HE IS MAKING FOR

120
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:49,553
AMERICAN FAMILIES.

121
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:50,487
>> Shannon: HE DID THINK THE

122
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:51,488
NORTH KOREANS IN HIS LETTER VERY

123
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,690
NICELY, SAYING IT WAS A

124
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,892
BEAUTIFUL THING THEY HAD DONE

125
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:55,693
ALLOWING THE AMERICANS TO COME

126
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:55,993
HOME.

127
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:56,827
THERE WAS A LOT OF PRAISE FOR

128
00:02:56,827 --> 00:03:00,731
HIM IN THIS LETTER AND IT WAS

129
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,665
SOMETHING THAT HOUSE MINORITY

130
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:02,499
LEADER CONGRESSWOMAN

131
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:03,233
NANCY PELOSI ACTUALLY MADE FUN

132
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,101
OF.

133
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,069
SHE SAID THAT KIM JONG UN MUST

134
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,907
BE HAVING A GIGGLE FIT READING

135
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:10,574
THIS LETTER, IT WAS WAY TOO

136
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:11,275
NICE, AND ALSO A VALENTINE TO

137
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,278
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER.

138
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,113
>> I THINK IT WAS A WELL-WRITTEN

139
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:16,447
LETTER.

140
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,481
I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY

141
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:17,881
INTERESTING.

142
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,083
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SO

143
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:19,483
DIPLOMATIC.

144
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,885
THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WE HAVE A

145
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,253
LEADER WHO IS PROTECTING

146
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:23,754
AMERICAN FAMILIES.

147
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:24,922
TODAY'S A BIG DAY IN THE

148
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:26,090
NATIONAL DEFENSE ORGANIZATION

149
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,059
ACT WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS, WE

150
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,160
REBUILDING THE MILITARY AGAIN,

151
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,963
THE CONGRESS LIVING UP TO HIS

152
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,798
PROMISES TO REBUILD THE

153
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,399
MILITARY, PEACE THROUGH

154
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:35,766
STRENGTH.

155
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,900
>> Shannon: YOU HAVE SEEN A

156
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,701
VIDEO OF THE SUPPOSED DEMOLITION

157
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,470
OF THE NUCLEAR TEST SITE, IT WAS

158
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,239
SAID THAT THERE WERE

159
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,707
COLLAPSING AND TUNNELS ON THE

160
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:44,675
BUILDING UNDERNEATH US.

161
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:46,844
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

162
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,113
DO YOU THINK THAT IS A

163
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:49,880
LEGITIMATE WAY TO ASSESS THAT?

164
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,315
WE DON'T HAVE EXPERTS ON THE

165
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:51,882
SITE.

166
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,050
>> WE DON'T HAVE FULL

167
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,484
VERIFICATION.

168
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,519
THAT IS ENCOURAGING, TOO.

169
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,354
WHO WOULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED, WE

170
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:58,889
ALREADY KNOW THE FAR LEFT WOULD

171
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,190
HAVE DISMISSED THIS AS NOT BEING

172
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,892
ABLE TO EVER OCCUR.

173
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:04,461
WELL, WHATEVER OCCURRED, A STEP

174
00:04:04,461 --> 00:00:00,000
FORWARD, AND AGAIN, I'M GRATEFUL
