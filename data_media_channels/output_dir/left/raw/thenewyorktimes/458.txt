1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,773
This is Emily Dickinson's
bedroom.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,775
And this is her desk.

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:13,046
I've heard that this can be a
transformative experience.

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:13,079
I've heard that this can be a
transformative experience.
Writers have told me that they
feel closer to Dickinson here.

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,416
Writers have told me that they
feel closer to Dickinson here.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,818
Some say that her presence
helps them write.

7
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,392
What happens next might sound
weird.

8
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,227
A calm comes over me.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,330
And I do something I haven't
done since elementary school.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,198
I begin to compose a poem.

11
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:39,339
The thoughts spill out in order
and do not step over each other.

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,274
I don't stop to think.

13
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,542
It feels thrilling.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,444
It feels uncanny.

15
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't stop writing until an
hour passes and it's time to go.
