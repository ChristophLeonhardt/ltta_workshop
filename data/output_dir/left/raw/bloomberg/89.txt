1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,820
“The European Union’s chief negotiator
Michel Barnier says the Brexit talks are deadlocked

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,880
over the U.K.s divorce bill”

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,850
U.K’s Brexit negotiations are stumbling
and farmers across Britain are concerned.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,280
Either there is labour to pick the crops or
what?

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,100
There are no crops. We will have to start
importing vast quantities of fresh food.

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:33,740
Farmers believe the UK government is scared
of confronting the immigration issue. Leaving

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,280
them in the dark over who will work in the
fields.

8
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,360
The words migration and immigration are just
dirty words in the UK now and we can’t even

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,840
talk about it.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,420
And farmers are being caught up in the argument.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,180
I had hate mail you’re taking work from

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,220
British workers - it’s absolute
garbage

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,060
If the workers can’t be found fruit and
vegetables will be left to rot in the fields

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,489
and you’ll pay more at the supermarket.

15
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,940
We are are facing significant labour shortages
which will impact on the economy and on the

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,829
ability of this nation to produce food.

17
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:15,380
This is Bloomberg’s The Real Cost of Brexit.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
We’re traveled to Kent in Southern England.
This regions voted overwhelmingly for Brexit

19
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,259
but farmers are divided down the middle.

20
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:30,039
Their businesses rely on migrant labour.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,320
80,000 migrant workers
are needed every year across the country

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,200
Brexit has but their future in doubt.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,180
We think we produce about 5 percent of the U.K.'s lettuce requirements

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,500
Nick Ottewell is the farm manager at Laurence
J Bett’s,  one of Kent’s biggest salad growers

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,140
He employs around 140 farm workers. Of those
working in the fields, all are from eastern

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,119
Europe, most from Romania.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,580
They live on the farm and work for up to 6 days
a week, for 7 pounds 50 and hour.

28
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,780
So these guys are cutting the lettuce by knife

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,040
because they're naked and then it's coming up here into this machine and it's being packed

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
This is what it takes to run a farm like this.

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,460
We need people who can do that every day, all day, otherwise we haven't got a business

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,780
Since the Brexit vote, attracting migrant
workers has got harder.

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,620
A survey by the National Farmers Union found
the number of seasonal workers coming to work

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,500
on British farms has dropped 17%.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,700
If next year you can’t get the people you
need, what will happen?

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,840
I don’t have a business, that’s what I
keep trying to say to anyone that interviews…

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,219
I do not have a business here with out
60 to 80 people prepared to bend their

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,280
back every day and work hard and cut lettuce, I do not have a business model

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,360
And why can’t those people be British?

40
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,500
There's two or three points I would like
to make on this.

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,430
The first is we are at 3 percent unemployment.

42
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,370
I can go down to the local job centre, I can
get one or two people. I need 100 people here.

43
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,220
I’m not taking work from British workers.

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,230
According to industry bodies, virtually all
of Britain’s agricultural seasonal workers

45
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,969
come from the E.U. most from Eastern Europe.

46
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:20,220
Of the 13,000 workers recruited between January
and May, only 14 were British

47
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,700
What to come and meet the workers?

48
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,480
Nick introduces us to Kamila. She’s worked
on the farm for six years and is now a team leader

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,640
And where are you from?

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,580
Romania

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,520
And most of you're team are from Romania?

52
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,480
In my team now, yes, it's all Romanian

53
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,560
Kamila doesn’t share Nick’s concerns,
she shrugs off Brexit fears and argues it’s

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,780
not hard to recruit eager workers.

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,980
No it’s not hard because Romanian people
need money and come back.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
Despite Kamilia confidence, farmers are seeing
the opposite

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,340
falling numbers of migrant workers from the E.U.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,180
Nick’s whole business relies on visa free
E.U. labour but that will almost certainly

59
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,420
stop post-Brexit. He’s left asking where
the workers will come from.

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,520
We’ve heading 30 minutes down the road to
WB Chambers and Son.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,860
How many tonnes of fruit do you produce?

62
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,860
Two thousand tonnes of Raspberries...

63
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,500
Tim’s farm is one of the biggest berry growers
in the U.K.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,870
He employs over 1200 migrant labourers - over
90 percent of which are from Bulgaria.

65
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,639
He also voted to leave the E.U. despite
the decision complicating his business in

66
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,750
the short term,

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,150
I’m very positive, I didn’t vote for my
business, I voted for the greater good of

68
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,770
the country.

69
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,479
Tim believes leaving the E.U. will likely
harm the U.K. economy but in the long run

70
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
it is the right decision.

71
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,460
He also argues when Britain stop visa free
E.U. immigration - migrant workers can be

72
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,860
found elsewhere.

73
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,150
The work force can come from outside Europe,
the rest of Europe has a labour shortage and

74
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,500
other countries in europe are already solving
that by bringing in workers from Ukraine and

75
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,520
Byelorussia

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,840
Although Tim and Nick disagree on Brexit, they
agree on the problem.

77
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,170
Tim is already finding it harder to get the
workers he needs.

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,290
Earlier in the year, we ourselves walked
away from 100, 150 tonnes of fruit that

79
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,940
we didn’t have the people in June to harvest

80
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,380
That’s around 5 percent of the farm’s
monthly total. Tim didn’t want to be specific..

81
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,370
but says his margins are tight and that loss
significantly hurts his business.

82
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,680
For some reason the words migration, immigration are just dirty words in the UK now

83
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
we can’t even talk about it

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,009
but other countries are solving their labour solutions
and we’re not doing it

85
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,710
and it's because of a political minefield that we
have got ourselves into where we can’t even

86
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,550
discuss openly this requirement.

87
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,300
On Tim’s farms a sense of being unwelcome
in the U.K. and a falling pounds is weighing

88
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,009
on worker’s minds.

89
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,240
Some are already considering their options.

90
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,440
What would stop you from coming back next
year? Is it about the money?

91
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,099
The first thing yeah. If I have to pay too
expensive visa to stay here and work it is not going

92
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,580
to make sense actually.

93
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,389
Farmers and workers need to know at least
a year in advance what the government’s

94
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,620
plan is. As the March 2019 Brexit deadline
approaches no one seems the wiser...

95
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,920
We’ve left Kent and headed up to London
to speak with the National Farmers Union.

96
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,710
They’ve been sounding the alarm bell about
at potential labour crisis.

97
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,990
We want to know, is the government listening?

98
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:20,700
“Yes but we are concerned they don’t properly
access the enormity of the problem.

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,860
Guy Smith is the NFU’s vice president and
an Essex farmer himself.

100
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,699
He’s calling on the government to give guidance
on the sort of visa scheme farmers will have

101
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,560
to deal post Brexit.

102
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,310
His concerns is, the government doesn’t
know themselves

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,060
We feel the government is in the dark
about what direction they are going in.

104
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,890
Things are politically very opaque. We have
an unusual political situation internally

105
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,259
in Britain at the moment,

106
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,639
with two political parties who seem to be
in some sort of internal turmoil about how they

107
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,580
should approach the Brexit challenge. Farmers
need certainty for year ahead.

108
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,050
The NFU argues the government should introduce
a seasonal workers scheme as soon as possible

109
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,370
because if no decision is reached soon, migrant
labor could suddenly dry up.

110
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:22,400
So for instance abattoir workers, food processing
factories, waitresses, chefs, they are disproportionately

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,479
maned by migrant labour,

112
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,340
if you suddenly withdraw that labour pool
for that food chain you will have all sorts

113
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,770
of dysfunctionality

114
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,740
which will then impact back on the farmer
who was the start of the food chain.

115
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,440
The union in warning next year will be worse.
They’re expect further falls in migrant

116
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,250
labour.

117
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,190
Farmers are calling on the government to ensure
they’re business are not jeopardised as

118
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,240
negotiations get tough.

119
00:08:57,240 --> 00:00:00,000
The clock is ticking
