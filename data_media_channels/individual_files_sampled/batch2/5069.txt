hey welcome back good morning Joe it's the top of the hour let's bring in now former CIA director and senior national security and Intel analyst for NBC News John Brennan thank you so much for being with us and you just posted an opinion piece and which leads to in The Washington Post which leads in the first question right why do you feel the need as a former director of the CIA to speak out so strongly so aggressively about what you see happening in the Trump administration and in the Intel community you served well Good Morning Joe well this is the first op-ed I've written since I left the government and I felt a need to explain why I and so many other former NASCAR officials are speaking out because of the abnormal and aberrant behavior of mr. Trump that very much concerns us because of the negative impact we believe it is having on our national security a bad signal that it sends to our young Americans as I say in the op-ed who look upon him as somebody who should be emulated as the most powerful position in the world the president United States and his continual lying as well as lack of ethics as well as lack of rigor in terms of the policies that he pursues so these are it is abnormal for us to speak out as as critically and as vocally as we have but these are abnormal times and he is an abnormal president and not in he's aberration and not in a good way that's what gives us the motivation to speak out director Brennan this David Ignatius welcome to the fellowship of biped columnist I want to ask you a question Pat about North Korea if I might we have a North Korean intelligence chief in the United States say he's coming to Washington and that raises it for me the question how much do we know about what goes on inside North Korea so that we'll be able to verify with some confidence what North Korea is doing as it moves toward we hope completed nuclear disarmament what what kind of intelligence base do we have well when I was in government North Korea was probably the most difficult target to penetrate as far as getting the insights into what Kim jong-un and others are planning and thinking but I think over the years US intelligence working with a lot of our partners as increased our understanding of what's happening there so I think we have better intelligence than we had before but still it's gonna be very very difficult Kim jong-un keeps his his confidence very much to a very small group of individuals and the fact that he's sending such a high-level emissary over here now I think underscores his interest and picking up on mr. Trump's willingness to have a summit and but it's gonna be difficult I think for the US intelligence community to really understand what is in store in terms of the future the North Koreans I think will want to have this summit but I and many others believe that they have no intention at this point of denuclearizing director Brennan it's Cayce hunts I wanted to turn back to the Muller investigation because there have been suggestions from the president and his allies that perhaps the CIA was involved in the beginning of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign and the president and his allies have embarked on this attempt to essentially raise questions about the investigators to undermine the overall credibility of that investigation are you concerned at all that with this op-ed you might be playing into the president's hands no I think the mr. Trump has demonstrated a paranoia and insecurity as well as a real concern about the investigation that is underway certainly his tweets do not seem like they're coming from a person of innocence and confidence I don't believe that are speaking out feeds that narrative among those who understand that the Department of Justice and the FBI and the CIA are the institutions that the American people rely on to protect our freedoms and our liberties mr. Trump is going to promote his narrative he certainly is going to continue to try to discredit the FBI and the CIA and others but I think make no mistake about it the American justice system I think is going to prevail in this endeavor to get to the bottom of who might have been collaborating and working with foreign actors to try to undermine the integrity of the election John you were just talking about the difficulty the CIA has traditionally had in penetrating North Korea such a secretive closed society and yet in Langley I'm telling you nothing that you don't know obviously the level of psychological profiling is off the charts so my question to you is this potential summit what does it mean for Kim jong-un to have a photograph taken in the same stage next to a President of the United States being on the same stage with a President of the United States what does it mean for him well something that he has sought for many years he wants to be seen as the international equivalent of the President of the United States he has clamored for this this world stage spotlight so it's I think very important for him both in terms of his domestic standing but also for his ego to show that he was able to bring the President of the United States to a negotiating table without making any concession on his nuclear program yes he has said he's going to dismantle the nuclear test site about by all accounts it had was near collapse so I don't see anything that he has given so far but yet we have given what I think is a premier prize which is a stage an international and a very public stage with the president United States hey director Brennan it's Heilmann here I want to ask you a historical question we've got some competing narratives about the beginning of the Russia counterintelligence investigation all right president Trump and his allies continue to assert that it began with you and the dossier the steel dossier the New York Times is reported and others say no no that's not right it began with George papadopolis and and his conversations drunkenly in London about the weather the Russians might have Hillary Clinton dirt and how that came back to you there's another narrative which is the one I'm interested in it's been reported in The Guardian and and in the observer here in the United States that in fact the the your interest in this and that the real roots of this counterintelligence operation or investigation began earlier than that with signal intelligence that was brought to the United States by some of our allies particularly Great Britain but others in Western Europe can you can you tell me which one of those narratives is right well I continuously shake my head at how much fabrication is going on people make things up out of whole cloth the one report you're referring to says that Robert Hannegan the head of GCHQ which is Great Britain's NSA equivalents came over and delivered information to me that involved the Trump campaign no such visit or meeting took place I didn't put eyes on the steel dossier until December of 2016 after the election right but yet people claimed that I was the one that was sharing it around town and briefing it that is not true and so I think what it shows that mr. Trump with his continued emphasis on lying and fabrication and untruths falsehoods it just feeds this and it encourages others to do it right and this is what I think is really so corrosive on our country in our government today okay can I just follow up real quick I know you just specifically denied the notion of the meeting with with with the gentleman from the GCHQ are you are you more in more general way saying that the broader narrative the notion that the beginning of the counterintelligence investigation began with some kinds of tips from allies based on signal intelligence are you making a broader claim there are you just specifically refuting the notion that that is one story that you referred to is false well my response to you was related to that one specific story CIA during the course of 2016 worked very closely with our domestic partners and if there were opportunities to work with foreign partners to try to understand what Russia was doing not what US persons the US officials were doing but what the Russians were doing to try to undermine us and I shared information with Jim Comey and with the White House as well as with the folks on the hill to make sure that there was a complete awareness of the things that we knew in terms of what Russia was doing so but again I I keep reading stories that are fiction and that's what they should be titled again broad final questions so as the planners in Moscow this active measures program is attempt to interfere our elections look back to years later at what's happened what do you what do you suppose they say to themselves about the outcome well I think they're quite pleased by how disruptive their campaign has been on US politics as you say we're here we are 60 months past the inauguration of a new president yet our entire political system seems to continue to be almost paralyzed in many respects as a result of this dispute about what the Russians were doing the Russians were trying to undermine the integrity election because they believe that anything that is done to hurt the United States of America anything that hurts the government benefits them and so when I think about the last of 16 months I think mr. Putin and others are quite content that they were able to disrupt the politics the government of the the greatest country in the world so director Brennan let's end interview where we began with your new op-ed out this morning in the Washington Post entitled I will speak out until the integrity returns to the White House and I want to read a bit of it here you say quote the esteem with which I held the presidency was dealt a serious blow and Donald Trump took office for more than three decades I observed and analyzed the traits and tactics of corrupt incompetent and narcissistic foreign officials who did whatever the thought necessary to retain power it never dawned on me that we could face such a development in the United States many have condemned my public criticism of mr. Trump arguing that as a former CIA director I should bite my tongue my criticisms however are not political I have never been and will never be a partisan I speak out for the simple reason that mr. Trump is failing to live up to the standards that we should expect all presidents to live up to as someone who had the rare privilege of directly serving for presidents I will continue to speak out loudly and critically until integrity decency wisdom and maybe even some humility return to the White House and of course you've been joined with others Michael Hayden Mike Morell who have raised questions former CIA directors who have raised questions and I certainly know in Michael Hayden's case he had grave concerns about Donald Trump when he was running but I had many private conversations that I'm sure he wouldn't mind me revealing here during the transition where general Hayden said he's the president we have one president we have to hope and pray and do everything we can to make this president succeed well he tried that now of course he feels like you the need to speak out is that perhaps because intelligence officers and the Intel community is as he said your mission is to to find out what the real facts are to analyze the facts and to act on those facts sometimes you get it right sometimes you get it wrong but it's still fact-based is that what it causes Donald Trump the biggest concerns that whether it's the media whether it's the Intel community whether it's law enforcement investigations he lives in a post fact world well yes I think we all hoped and prayed when Donald Trump was elected president that he would grow into the office that he would mature as a as a person and he would do what is right for the country and set his ego aside but I think myself as well as Mike Hayden and Jim clapper and others I think we have been very dismayed at what we have seen over 16 months and as national security officials former and sql's and non-partisans we are very very concerned that what we're seeing here is something that we have seen in other countries around the globe which really led to the degradation of democratic principles as well as the the standards of governance that should not be happening here this is the United States of America Donald Trump has not lived up to those standards yeah all right thank you so much director Brennan we really appreciate you being with us today and still at a Morning Joe the jobs numbers aren't going to cross the wires for another 15 minutes but Donald Trump's Twitter feed may already be giving some early hints will that presidential tweet move the markets will go straight to CNBC when we return you're watching Morning Joe we're coming right back thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
