so it looks like Danny O'Conner is going to narrowly lose in Ohio so that was plus 11 seat for the Republicans it was a nail-biter that's not good news for the Republicans overall but the Democrats it looks like are going to lose that seat narrowly you on the other hand were in a plus 27 race and you had only a sliver of time because it was a special election last time around and you wound up closing it by 21 points so the lesson I get out of that is it does depend on the candidate that if you've got a candidate that has a certain message you can outperform by more than plus 11 obviously you are performed by plus 21 the first time around so what do you think was the message that resident is so well in Kansas well I think that people here in Kansas are hard workers they respond to somebody that's out there trying to talk to people Alexandria LoCascio cortez talks about respecting the hustle and that's exactly right you have to respect the hustle when somebody's getting out there and putting in the time to get to know their district and the people in their district and issues that they're concerned about and when you're talking about working people and listening to them and responding to the things that they're telling you they're going to respond back to you so it's a matter of making sure you're out there working hard and that's what we've been doing for a year and a half and we're excited about it so James one more thing that's important for the general election because that's where you're headed now at least one more thing which is what are the policy positions you're going to focus on between now and November to try to close that last six points between you and Estes we're gonna continue focusing on the same things that we've been focusing on making sure that we have a living wage they have the ability to get their kids educated but they have the ability that every single person has the ability to get health care in this country these things are common issues regardless if it's in Kansas or the wrongs of Vermont or California or Texas or anywhere else people want to have the ability to take care of their family so when we're talking about health care we're going to be talking about Medicare we're talking about living wage we're gonna be talking about raising that minimum wage so that it is something that a person can live on in the district and area that they live in when we're talking about Social Security we're gonna talk about expanding it not just trying to prevent people from cutting it but actually expanding it so that our senior citizens are not living in poverty we're gonna talk about taking care of our veterans so that they have the care that they need so you can stop losing 20 veterans a day these are the things that the people in my district and the people across the country care about and that's what we're going to continue pushing that message and then finally James now you're the official Democratic candidate in that race and in that in the special election you made it obvious that it is a close race so clearly winnable do you expect the Democratic Party to come in and and spend some money in helping you win that race I've learned not to expect anything from the Democratic Party if they come in great if they don't I'm gonna win without so we did it the last time we came within six this time I've got more time I hope that they do come in and hope that they help out but if they don't unprepared for that as well I'm used to going to them alone on my own I grew up in poverty was homeless at one point so I'm used to fighting on my own and I'll continue to do that but I don't have to fight on my own here because I've got an entire army to volunteers and staff people that are willing put in the work and the time to flip this district we
