Tunisia has seen a third consecutive day of violent protests since the first rally on Monday more than 600 people have been arrested with one killed and around 50 injured when our witness in the third day our violent protests across Tunisia both in the capital of Tunis and in at least 10 other locations now the protests started peacefully but since Monday night they've taken a violent nature in just a last night Wednesday more than 300 people were arrested the Army has been called in to try and deal with the situation they've been used to protect government buildings they and the police have accused protesters of attacking government officials of trying to take over shopping centers of blockading roads for example whereas the protesters and response have accused the security forces of using a heavy hand and conducting a heavy crackdown all of it is in response to the government's announcement at the beginning of January of a 2018 budget plan now this budget plan has seen a dramatic increase in taxes on basic goods so you have for example fuel increases you have tax hikes on food items and all of this is of course being met with fury and outrage on these streets of Tunisia at the same time we do witness similar protests happening in another country also focused on the economic situation and that of course is in Iran but there is a noticeable difference while there has been international outrage against the situation in Iran and the way the government is dealing with it there when it comes to Tunisia basically the international community is keeping mum so for example with Iran you had the French president microrna you had the head of the European Union High Commission and you had the American president Donald Trump basically calling for regime change here in Tunisia same situation and yet we're hearing nothing from the international community and it might be because back in 2011 at the start of the Arab Spring the Tunisia was the first country to asked a dictator in a move that the Western world widely hailed as democratic change but since then there have been no less than nine governments in place in Tunisia and none of them have been able to get a grip on the economic situation there
