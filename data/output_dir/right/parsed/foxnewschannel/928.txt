>> Bret: IT NOW TO REACTION OF
THAT IG REPORT FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE, WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING THE
DAY OFF ESSENTIALLY FROM PUBLIC
EVENTS, CELEBRATING HIS 72ND
OVERSHADOWED BY A LEGAL
CHALLENGE COMING OUT OF NEW YORK
TO THE PRESIDENT'S CHARITABLE
FOUNDATION.
CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CORKE
REPORTS FOR US TONIGHT.
>> CERTAINLY, THERE ARE A LOT OF
THINGS IN THIS REPORT THAT NOT
ONLY WORRY THOSE OF US IN THE
ADMINISTRATION BUT SHOULD WORRY
A LOT OF AMERICANS.
>> Reporter: EVEN AT THE
WHITE HOUSE TODAY OFFERED ITS
FULL THROATED SUPPORT FOR THE
INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT, IT
WAS A LAWSUIT FROM
NEW YORK STATE THAT REALLY GOT
THE WHITE HOUSE'S ATTENTION.
>> OF THE CURRENT ACTING
NEW YORK AG HAS STATED THAT
BATTLING THE WHITE HOUSE IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT JOB SHE HAS EVER
DONE.
THAT SOUNDS OUTRAGEOUSLY BIASED
AND CERTAINLY PROBLEMATIC.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER, ASKING
FOR MONEY FOR VETERANS CHARITIES
AND I LIVE JUST BEFORE THE
CAUCUSES THEY ARE.
INDEED, THE AG'S OFFICE SAID IT
GAVE FIVE, $100,000 GRANTS WERE
MADE THEY ARE RIGHT BEFORE THE
VOTES WERE CAST IN THE HAWKEYE
STATE.
BUT THE PRESIDENT PUSHED BACK ON
TWITTER: NEW YORK DEMOCRATS
SLEAZY, SAYING THEY ARE SUING A
FOUNDATION THAT TOOK IN
$8.8 MILLION AND GAVE OUT TO
CHARITY MORE MONEY THAN IT TOOK
HIM TO COME UP 19.2 MILLION.
