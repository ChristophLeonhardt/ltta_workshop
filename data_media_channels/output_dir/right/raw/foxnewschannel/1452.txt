1
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:09,750
>> Laura: YESTERDAY, THE NFL

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,018
ANNOUNCED IT WILL REQUIRE

3
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:12,119
PLAYERS TO EITHER STAND ON THE

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,921
FIELD OR REMAIN IN THE

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,055
LOCKER ROOM DURING THE PLAYING

6
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:17,391
OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

7
00:00:17,391 --> 00:00:18,058
TODAY, NUMEROUS REPORTS SAID

8
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:20,894
THAT INSTEAD OF KNEELING DURING

9
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:23,764
THE ANTHEM, NFL PLAYERS ARE NOW

10
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:25,732
ALREADY PLANNING NEW WAYS TO

11
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:26,934
PROTEST.

12
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,902
THE EVER PATRIOTIC EDITORIAL

13
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,137
BOARD OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

14
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:31,772
HELPFULLY SUGGESTED THAT PLAYERS

15
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:35,909
RAISE BLACK GLOVED FISTS IN THE

16
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,077
AIR.

17
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:37,744
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINKS IT'S

18
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:42,316
IMPORTANT THAT ALL PLAYERS

19
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:43,517
RESPECT THE ANTHEM.

20
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,519
>> President Trump: I THINK

21
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:46,486
IT'S GOOD TO STAND PROUDLY FOR

22
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:47,587
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

23
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,723
WHERE YOU SHOULD BE PLAIN,

24
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:50,924
SHOULD BE THERE.

25
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:52,559
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN THE

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:52,893
COUNTRY.

27
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:54,561
YOU HAVE TO STAND PROUDLY FOR

28
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,563
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND THE NFL

29
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:58,031
ON THE REST OF THE RIGHT THING.

30
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,133
>> Laura: LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT,

31
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:00,968
BABY.

32
00:01:00,968 --> 00:01:03,136
I THOUGHT THAT WAS HILARIOUS.

33
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:05,105
SO TO PROTEST BE TOLERATED?

34
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,741
LET'S DEBATE THAT WITH THE

35
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,778
FORMER NFL STAR AND AUTHOR OF

36
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:14,748
THE NEW BOOK, ANTOINE C RIGHT.

37
00:01:14,748 --> 00:01:18,218
LET'S GO TO YOU, ANTOINE.

38
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:19,152
LOOK, I THINK A LOT OF PLAYERS

39
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:22,122
ARE TIRED OF THIS WHOLE

40
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:22,823
CONTROVERSY, AND I BET IF YOU

41
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,924
REALLY TALK TO THEM THEY JUST

42
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:25,359
WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL AND ENJOY

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,928
THE GAME THAT MOST OF THEM ARE

44
00:01:27,928 --> 00:01:28,729
PLAYED AND A DECENT AMOUNT OF

45
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,163
MONEY TO PLAY.

46
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:32,232
BUT NEVERTHELESS, IT'S BUBBLED

47
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:34,334
UP AGAIN, WHY A NEW ROUND OF

48
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:38,939
PROTEST TO DRAG THE NFL THROUGH

49
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,143
YET ANOTHER SEASON OF

50
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:43,543
DISCONTENT?

51
00:01:43,543 --> 00:01:45,946
>> I THINK PEOPLE WILL BRING WHY

52
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,315
WE EVEN ARE HAVING THIS COME

53
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:49,316
CONVERSATION.

54
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,184
THERE WERE NFL PLAYERS THAT

55
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:53,520
BELIEVED AT THE HANDS OF

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,388
LAW ENFORCEMENT, BLACK AND BROWN

57
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:56,957
PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN

58
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,925
MISTREATED MISTREATED,

59
00:01:58,925 --> 00:02:00,127
MISHANDLED AND KILLED HER.

60
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,362
AND THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S WRONG.

61
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:06,333
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY BASED ON

62
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,568
THE HALLMARKS OF DEMOCRACY AND

63
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:13,173
THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN ABOUT

64
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:13,740
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

65
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,408
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON BEING

66
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,575
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

67
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:16,810
HE WANTS TO TELL NFL PLAYERS

68
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,179
WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY SHOULD

69
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:20,747
DO THEIR JOBS.

70
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,949
>> THEY HAVE AN OPINION, AND

71
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,518
THAT'S FAIR.

72
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:25,919
I MEAN NFL PLAYERS HAVE THEIR

73
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,354
OPINION, AND THE PRESIDENT IS

74
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,589
LIKE, YOU SHOULD STAND FOR THE

75
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,490
ANTHEM.

76
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,726
EVERYONE HAS A GIVE AND TAKE

77
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:33,060
CARE OF.

78
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,628
IF YOU ARE A FOOTBALL PLAYER,

79
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,730
YOU ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE

80
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,330
RULES OF THE NFL.

81
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,634
THE OWNERS TO WRITE THE RULES,

82
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:42,202
THE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION HAS

83
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:43,537
THEIR SAY.

84
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:45,138
AND BURGESS OWENS, OBVIOUSLY AS

85
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:46,139
A FORMER PLAYER YOURSELF, THE

86
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,340
RULES OF THE GAME ARE THE RULES

87
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,409
OF THE GAME AND THE OWNER SET

88
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,944
THE RULES.

89
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,179
THEY WERE GETTING TIRED OF THE

90
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:54,147
LOWER ATTENDANCE AND THE PUBLIC

91
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,982
UPSET OVER THIS, EVEN THOUGH

92
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,584
THEY ARE TRYING TO GO GLOBAL.

93
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:00,520
>> CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING

94
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:00,954
REALLY QUICK?

95
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:02,622
I'M GOING TO BRING A DIFFERENT

96
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:05,826
FLAVOR TO THIS THING BECAUSE IT

97
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:08,995
TAKES A LOT OF HARD WORK TO

98
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:12,833
BRING 60 YEARS TO MESS IT UP

99
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,836
WITHIN TWO YEARS.

100
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:18,438
THEY'VE EITHER BASED UPON TOTAL

101
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:20,006
INCOMPETENCE, RECKLESS

102
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:21,341
LEADERSHIP FOR ITS STUNNING

103
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:21,675
PURPOSE.

104
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,277
A COMMISSION IS PAID $40 MILLION

105
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,246
PER YEAR AND 90% OF THAT IS

106
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,849
BASED ON GROWTH INCENTIVE.

107
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:34,187
WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AS ELITIST.

108
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:37,491
YOU DON'T MIND THE MEANING OF

109
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:39,092
THE AMERICAN FLAG, TARNISHING

110
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:40,293
THE AMERICAN BRAND, BECAUSE IT

111
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:51,538
LOOKS LIKE INTERNATIONAL.

112
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:52,906
AND IF THEY CHANGE THE RULE, IF

113
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:56,443
THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE

114
00:03:56,443 --> 00:04:07,120
GLOBAL BRAND, AND THUS IS THE

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,787
DEAL.

116
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:09,089
YOU CAN STAY IN THE LOCKER ROOM

117
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:11,758
IF YOU WANT TO HELP PROTEST.

118
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:12,826
OR YOU CAN STAND ON THE SIDELINE

119
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:16,963
AND THE KEY PAYS THE FINE.

120
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:19,166
NBA IS NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT

121
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:23,003
THIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS

122
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,238
THAT THAT PLAYERS WILL RESPECT

123
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:29,342
THE CORPORATION AND RESPECT THE

124
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:29,643
FLAG.

125
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,344
>> Laura: THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

126
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,946
THE NBA DOESN'T HAVE THIS

127
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:34,247
PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RULE

128
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:35,348
THAT YOU STAND FOR THE ANTHEM

129
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,783
AND YOU RESPECT THE PLAYING OF

130
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,718
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, CORRECT?

131
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:42,756
THERE WAS A GREAT PIECE ON ESPN

132
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:45,825
ABOUT THIS.

133
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,595
>> A LITTLE KNOWN FACT, THE SAME

134
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:51,131
DAY THIS CAME DOWN BY NFL OWNERS

135
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,767
WHO BY THE WAY DID NOT HAVE AN

136
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,535
NFL REPRESENTATIVE IN THE ROOM

137
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,970
WHEN THEY MADE THIS DECISION.

138
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,406
THE SAME DAY THIS CAME DOWN A

139
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:01,007
VIDEO WAS RELEASED BY THE

140
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,943
MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN

141
00:05:02,943 --> 00:05:05,545
WHICH AN NBA PLAYER WAS TASED

142
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,513
OVER PARKING VIOLATIONS.

143
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,149
KEEP IN MIND WE ARE HAVING THIS

144
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:09,783
CONVERSATION AGAIN BECAUSE

145
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:11,084
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND BLACK AND

146
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,620
BROWN PEOPLE ARE FIVE TIMES IS

147
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,423
MORE LIKELY TO BE INJURED OR

148
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,290
KILLED AT THE HANDS OF --

149
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,358
>> Laura: ANTOINE, WHAT DOES

150
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:23,897
THAT HAVE TO DO WITH A FOOTBALL

151
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:26,132
GAME?

152
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,134
>> Antoine: LAURA, --

153
00:05:28,134 --> 00:05:29,736
>> Laura: WRITE AN OP-ED, MANY

154
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:34,941
OF THEM VOLUNTEER AND HAVE GREAT

155
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,543
CHARITIES, THAT'S FANTASTIC.

156
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,378
BUT PEOPLE TUNE IN TO WATCH THE

157
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:38,745
GAME.

158
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,146
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR

159
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:42,882
POLITICAL VIEWS, I HATE TO TELL

160
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:43,149
YOU.

161
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,553
THEY DON'T CARE.

162
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:51,124
B3 IF THEY DON'T CARE THEN WHY

163
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:54,327
IS THE PRESIDENT -- >> THEY USE,

164
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:59,132
ABUSE AND DISCARD.

165
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:00,934
ANTOINE, HOW ABOUT RESPECT, MY

166
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,303
FRIEND, WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN FOR

167
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:04,337
A FEW MINUTES.

168
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:06,139
WHAT THE NFL IS DOING IS

169
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:11,544
ACCUSING AMERICAN FANS AND

170
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:14,347
ABUSING THEM EVERY SINGLE

171
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:15,649
SUNDAY, SHARING THIS AIR OF

172
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:19,686
SOCIALISM AND ABLE TO SCORE

173
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:21,321
DISCARD THEM FOR INTERNATIONAL

174
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,322
FOREIGN VANS.

175
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,657
ALL THEY ARE DOING WITH THE NEW

176
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:24,891
PLAN COMPANY KEEPS THIS WHOLE

177
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,759
THING ALIVE.

178
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,760
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS

179
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,628
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHILE

180
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,729
PLAYERS ARE DECIDING HOW THEY

181
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,098
WANT TO DEMONSTRATE.

182
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:36,536
>> Laura: FINAL WORD, ANTOINE?

183
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:38,972
>> Antoine: BURGESS, LET ME

184
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:41,875
REMIND YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE ME.

185
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,543
>> I AM AN AMERICAN FIRST.

186
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:44,744
>> Antoine: ARE YOU GOING TO

187
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:46,546
LET ME FINISH MY POINT OR TALK

188
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:47,347
OVER ME?

189
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:50,183
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US HAVE IT

190
00:06:50,183 --> 00:06:51,551
FIVE MORE TIMES LIKELY TO

191
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:52,952
EXPERIENCE BEING MISHANDLED AT

192
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:55,088
THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

193
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,156
THAT'S WHY THESE PLAYERS ARE

194
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:57,524
TAKING A KNEE AND THAT'S WHY

195
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,359
THEY ARE TAKING A STAND AND I

196
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:01,528
COMMEND THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS.

197
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:06,132
I'M SORRY THIS PRESIDENT -- >>

198
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:09,202
WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF WHO WE

199
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:09,602
ARE.

200
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,137
>> Laura: GUYS, LOOK.

201
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,139
I THINK WE ALL WANT THINGS TO BE

202
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:13,540
BETTER.

203
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,542
WE ALL WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE JOBS,

204
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:17,143
WE WANT FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO

205
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:17,944
STAY TOGETHER.

206
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,446
WE WANT THE POLICE TO RESPECT

207
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,981
EVERYONE, AND I THINK THEY

208
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,451
GENERALLY DO BUT MISTAKES ARE

209
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:24,751
MADE.

210
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,185
>> ABSOLUTELY.

211
00:07:25,185 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Laura: I DON'T THINK A LOT
