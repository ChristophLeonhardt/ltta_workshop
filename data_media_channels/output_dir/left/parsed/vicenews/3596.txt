okay my name is Courtney Barnett and
today we're gonna be talking about city
looks pretty from my album tell me how
you really feel
city looks pretty I started riding when
I was in my early 20s really depressed
and wouldn't leave my room the city
takes pity on you injured soul and
heavenly pros ain't enough good to fill
that hole I love that line I think that
I don't really understand it still the
baseline it kind of just rolls and
drones throughout the whole song like a
constant movement of the city sometimes
I give
it's not half this bad
the drums in the chorus tickets that's
it that was the one tiny thing that
broke up the constant kind of driving
they're all quite simple and consistent
so they create foreboding like when is
something gonna happen
a lot of my discussions were just to
play weird making lots of happy melodic
accidents in the process
the change in the song from the up-tempo
to the kind of that outro it kind of
turned into it like a real ballad
slowing down and seeing what's around
you in contrast to that speedy letting
everything rush past you the kind of
journey of the whole song it seemed kind
of ridiculous in a good way
you
you
