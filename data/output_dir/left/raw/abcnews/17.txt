THE COURT GOING FORWARD IF 

69
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:04,657
DONALD J. TRUMP CAN PLACE HIS 

70
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,658
PICK IN HIS STEAD?

TRUMP IS CONSIDERING TO THE 

74
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,965
SUPREME COURT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 

75
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,634
NEIL GORSUCH, HIS FIRST PICK OF 

76
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:16,936

77
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,572
VACANCY HE WAS ABLE TO FILL LAST

78
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:19,772
YEAR.

79
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,873
HE IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO 

80
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,910
APPOINT SOMEONE WHO IS MUCH MORE

81
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,113
IN THE MODE OF JUSTICE ALITO, 

82
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,916
JUSTICE TOM A A SOLID 

83
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,984
CONSERVATIVE ON THE COURT RATHER

84
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,851
THAN SOMEONE LIKE JUSTICE 

85
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,720
KENNEDY WHO HAS BEEN SOMEONE WHO

86
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,054
HAS MOVED BETWEEN THE 

87
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,422
COALITIONS, MOVED BETWEEN THE 

88
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,658
LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES ON 

89
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,493
DIFFERENT ISSUES IN ORDER TO 

90
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,362
FORM THOSE 5 TO 4 MAJORITIES.

91
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:44,964
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS HIS WAY 

92
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,066
WITH WHOEVER HE APPOINTS, HE IS 

93
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,868
GOING TO HAVE A SUPREME COURT 

94
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,638
THAT IS DECIDEDLY CONSCONSERVAT 

95
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,707
THAT IS ABLE TO FORM A MUCH MORE

96
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,210
DECISIVE MAJORITY AROUND SOME OF

97
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,610
THESE BIG ISSUES. 

98
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,445
>> LET'S GIVE IT TO ABC NEWS 

99
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,848
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT 

100
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,549
JOHN CARL WHO IS STANDING BY IN 

101
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:04,516
THE WASHINGTON BUREAU.

102
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,620
GIVE US A SENSE, I KNOW THIS IS 

103
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,322
EXTREMELY EARLY AND THIS NEWS IS

104
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,524
MINUTES OLD AND HOW LIKELY IS IT

105
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,591
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO 

106
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:13,626
GET HIS PICK THROUGH?

107
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,328
>> I THINK IT WILL BE AN EPIC 

108
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,164
BATTLE AS GEORGE JUST MENTIONED,

109
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,365
BUT I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE 

110
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,366
INVOLVED ON THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM

111
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,502
ON THIS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO 

112
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,371
PUSH TO GET A PERSON NOMINATED 

113
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,308
AND CONFIRMED BEFORE THE MIDTERM

114
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:28,641
ELECTIONS.

115
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:32,378
THAT WILL BE A MONUMENTAL TASK.

116
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,479
DEMOCRATS WILL DO EVERYTHING IN 

117
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,281
THEIR POWER TO PREVENT THAT FROM

118
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:35,548
HAPPENING.

119
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,584
REMEMBER, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 

120
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,987
RIGHT NOW, DAN, SIMPLY A 

121
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,054
ONE-SEAT MAJORITY IN THE SENATE 

122
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:43,022
THANKS TO THE WAY THEY HAVE 

123
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,658
CHANGED THE RULES, THEY CAN 

124
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,728
CONFIRM A JUSTICE ON A SIMPLE 

125
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,762
MAJORITY AND THEY WILL WANT TO 

126
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,332
GET THIS DONE BEFORE THE MIDTERM

127
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,833
ELECTIONS, BEFORE THERE IS ANY 

128
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,501
CHANCE THAT THAT MAJORITY GOES 

129
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,236
AWAY, AND I AM TOLD ALSO THAT 

130
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:59,405
THAT LIST THAT YOU HEARD GEORGE 

131
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,307
MENTION, THE LIST OF 

132
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,944
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES THAT THE 

133
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,612
PRESIDENT-ELECT BACK IN 

134
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:09,048
NOVEMBER, AFTER THE ELECTION PUT

135
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,351
OUT IS THE LIST THEY'LL BE GOING

136
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,851
FROM TO LOOK FOR A REPLACEMENT 

137
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,887
FOR KENNEDY.

138
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,322
IN OTHER WORDS, A HARD-LINE 

139
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:17,656
CONSERVATIVE.

140
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:18,791
THE PEOPLE ON THE PRESIDENT'S 

141
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,059
TEAM INVOLVED IN THIS DO NOT 

142
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,327
BELIEVE IN THE TRADITION OF YOU 

143
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,795
REPLACE A MODERATE WITH A 

144
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,262
MODERATE.

145
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,363
THERE WILL BE AN EFFORT TO 

146
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,098
REPLACE KENNEDY WITH SOMEBODY 

147
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,700
THAT WOULD DECISIVELY SWAY THE 

148
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,104
BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SUPREME 

149
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,337
COURT. 

150
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,304
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE U.S. 

151
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,539
SENATE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT 

152
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,707
WILL ALL COME DOWN TO THE UNITED

153
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,041
STATES SENATE AND AS YOU SAID, 

154
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,512
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A ONE-VOTE 

155
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,482
MAJORITY THERE.

156
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,617
SO THERE ARE REPUBLICAN SENATORS

157
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,651
WHO HAVE CONTENTIOUS 

158
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,619
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PRESIDENT

159
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,387
OF THE UNITED STATES, JOHN 

160
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,256
McCAIN COMES TO MIND, JEFF FLAKE

161
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,492
FROM ARIZONA COMES TO MIND.

162
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,560
SO IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD 

163
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,332
SEE MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S 

164
00:04:59,332 --> 00:04:59,899
OWN PARTY STOP HIM ON THIS?

165
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,266
>> NO QUESTION.

166
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,535
ALSO, THERE IS A QUESTION OF 

167
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,637
JOHN McCAIN HAS NOT BEEN IN 

168
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,939
WASHINGTON FOR A VOTE FOR SOME 

169
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,441
TIME, OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING FROM 

170
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,442
BRAIN CANCER.

171
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,876
HE'S BEEN BACK IN ARIZONA.

172
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,511
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR

173
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:13,846
NOT HE WOULD EVEN BE HERE TO 

174
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,782
CAST A VOTE, A VOTE WHICH THEY 

175
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,418
WOULD NEED POTENTIALLY, AND ALSO

176
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,753
YOU HAVE SUSAN COLLINS WHO 

177
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,056
HASN'T HAD AS OPENLY A 

178
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:24,824
CONTENTIOUS A RELATIONSHIP AS 

179
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,659
SOMEONE LIKE JEFF FLAKE OR JOHN 

180
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,794
McCAIN, BUT WHO IS VERY MUCH A 

181
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,998
MODERATE PRO-ABORTION RIGHTS 

182
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,434
REPUBLICAN WHO COULD POTENTIALLY

183
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,301
BALK AT THE IDEA OF SOMEBODY 

184
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,738
THAT WOULD DO AWAY, FOR 

185
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,639
INSTANCE, WITH ROE V. WADE, THE 

186
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,975
DECISIVE VOTE TO DO AWAY WITH 

187

188
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,513
EVEN IF THE REPUBLICANS, EVEN IF

189
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,814
THE PRESIDENT CAN MANAGE TO GET 

190
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,350
SOMEBODY NOMINATED, TO GET 

191
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,584
THROUGH A CONFIRMATION HEARINGS

SENATE BEFORE THE MIDTERMS WITH

THE ONE-SEAT MAJORITY, IT WILL 

195
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,892
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET 

196
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,927
SOMEBODY FROM THIS LIST OF 

197
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,196

ON THIS SCORE.

203
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:11,370
GEORGE?

204
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,505
>> LET ME PICK UP THAT.

205
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,506
JOHN IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

206
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,041
THERE WILL BE ENORMOUS PRESSURE 

207
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,541
ON EVERY REPUBLICAN TO HANG 

208
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,810
TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 

209
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,979
APPROVE HIS NOMINEE.

210
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:20,813
JUDGES HAS BEEN ONE OF THE 

211
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,982
POLICY ISSUES THAT'S BEEN A GLUE

212
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,217
FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

213
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,618
ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH THE 

214
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,353
ONE-SEAT MAJORITY THAT JOHN IS 

215
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,687
TALKING ABOUT, EVERY SENATOR, 

216
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,990
REPUBLICAN SENATOR WILL HAVE 

217
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,423
TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE.

218
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,059
YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE LIKE JEFF 

219
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:37,029
FLAKE, YOU MENTIONED HIM, BOB 

220
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,830
CORKER, FROM TENNESSEE, BOTH 

221
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,599
WILL BE RETIRING FROM THE SENATE

222
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,567
AND SENATOR FLAKE ESPECIALLY HAS

223
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,503
TALKED ABOUT HOLDING UP JUDICIAL

224
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,238

225
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,573

IMPOSING TARIFFS AND OTHER 

227
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,610
REPUBLICAN ISSUES AND BOB CORKER

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,913
HAS BEEN QUITE CRITICAL OF THE 

229
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,047
PRESIDENT.

230
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:59,519
AS JOHN MENTIONED, ALSO SENATOR 

231
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,921
LISA MURKOWSKI WOULD BE ANOTHER 

232
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,421
SEN

233
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,989
SENATOR WHO WOULD BE RELUCTANT 

234
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,992
FOR A JUSTICE THAT WOULD 

235
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:06,826
OVERTURN ROE V. WADE.

236
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,628
THIS WILL BE A MONUMENTAL BATTLE

237
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,062
AND THERE IS A QUESTION ON THE 

238
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,696
DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

239
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,265
YOU'VE GOT DEMOCRATS IN RED 

240
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,902
STATES WHO ARE UP FOR 

241
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:16,202
RE-ELECTION.

AND HEIDI WHO WILL VOTE AGAINST 

244
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,745
THE PRESIDENT AND AGAINST THEIR 

245
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:26,678
PARTY AND THIS IS THE KIND OF 

246
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,814
ISSUE THAT TENDS TO GALVANIZE 

247
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,982
PARTIES AND TENDS TO BRING THEM 

248
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:30,816
TOGETHER.

249
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,485
I REALLY CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW BIG

250
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,387
A BATTLE THIS IS GOING TO BE. 

251
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,989
>> AS IF WE DID NOT ALREADY LIVE

252
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,890
IN INTERESTING TIMES.

253
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,760
LET'S BRING IN ABC NEWS SUPREME 

254
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,796
COURT REPORTER TERRY MORAN WHO 

255
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,834
HAS BEEN COVERING THEM FOR MANY,

256
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,403
MANY YEARS.

257
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,704
WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY,

258
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,539
IN PARTICULAR, HE MADE HIS MARK 

259
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,207
ON GAY RIGHTS.

260
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,342
>> HE DID.

261
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,546
HE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A 

262
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,948
GREAT JUSTICE AT THE VANGUARD OF

263
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,816
THE GAY LIBERATION MOVEMENT IN 

264
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:08,454
THE LAW, AND AN UNLIKELY 

265
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:08,721
CANDIDATE.

266
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,690
HE WAS ORIGINALLY, 30 YEARS AGO 

267
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,257
NOW, HE CAME TO THE COURT AFTER 

268
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,560
THE NOMINATION OF ROBERT BORK, 

269
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,997
THE STAUNCH CONSERVATIVE FAIL 

270
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,532
AND THAT WAS THE MOST EPIC 

271
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,900
BATTLE TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT

272
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,201
ANYONE HAD SEEN UP TO THAT TIME 

273
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,736
AND IT MAKES SENSE IN SOME WAYS 

274
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,172
THAT KENNEDY'S REPLACEMENT WILL 

275
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,541
FACE A SIMILAR EPIC BATTLE, BUT 

276
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,976
IN ADDITION TO GAY RIGHTS, 

277
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,044
JUSTICE KENNEDY WAS VERY 

278
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,114
IMPORTANT IN OTHER FIELDS, AS 

279
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:35,548
WELL.

280
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,182
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE CAME ON THE

281
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,086
COURT THERE WAS A BATTLE TO 

282
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,886
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND 

283
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,688
MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT AT THE TIME 

284
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,658
THAT HE WOULD BE THE VOTE TO 

285
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,526
OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE.

286
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:50,295
HE HELPED PRESERVE THE CORE OF 

287
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:52,398
THAT DECISION AND NOW IF HE 

288
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:55,067
LEAVES IT IS ONCE AGAIN AN OPEN 

289
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,235
QUESTION ABOUT THAT DECISION AND

290
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,304
OTHER, BUT HE LEAVES A LEGACY OF

291
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:02,208
A LIBERTARIAN BEND AND A GENTLE 

292
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,310
APPROACH, IN MANY WAYS THAT IS, 

293
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,577
FRANKLY, OUT OF STEP WITH THE 

294
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,079
TIMES THAT WE'RE IN TODAY. 

295
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,683
>> TERRY MORAN, JOHN KARL AND 

296
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,918
