WolframAlpha is one of easily the coolest sites on the internet and we're going to look at one really interesting aspect of it today which is how you can use Wolfram Alpha to analyze stock data to get a snapshot of a company any sort of basic information that you need about it so first we look at Disney which is on the New York Stock Exchange so we type in NY a seat : is which is their ticker symbol and then we get a whole bunch of information about for instance right up top we can see what their latest trade is right now 63 97 as of 45 minutes ago you can see how how much they're down from the last close what their previous close was but they opened add any of that information that you need about the rudimentary stock data you can also get a lot of cool information about the company fundamentals you can get market cap revenue to employees you can see how much they're making their employees work for them revenue per employee you can also take a look at their balance sheet annual or quarterly to get a nice little snapshot of what the company is performing it you can also go down to the income statement get the quarterly income statement any kind of data that you need from that you can take a look at the cash flow statement and just a really good picture of how the company is doing so you can also take a look at how the returns are doing for instance Disney's up 30 percent over the year over the five year it's up 118 percent over the day it's not doing so well you can do price history you can go as far as thirty years with Disney you can also take a look at analyst ratings right now analysts are rating at a moderate bot you can also get a breakdown of what those analysts are saying about it so 12 strong by nine hold three moderate by either way looking good you can take a look at performance comparisons against competitors like Time Warner Cable's CBS you can also take a look at it how it's doing against the rest of the S&P 500 against bonds or its t-bills so we can see that Disney is doing pretty good it's not doing anywhere near as well with realized return as Time Warner Cable or CBS but it's also a lot more stable you can see how these stocks are correlated you can get daily return analysis and it also has a ton of projection so that you can take a look at to see what folks are thinking it's gonna look like you can take a look at the daily returns against the S&P 500 again it's relatively normal stock it's doing some of that or somewhat worse you can get information just basic location website things like that logo but most importantly you can also take a look at who the offices the company are you can get a detailed breakdown of who's running the show and you can also see how much skin of the game they have you can see that Robert a Iger controls 1.6 million shares which is a little less than 0.1% of the company but is worth 75 million so you can use it for any company you can look at any kind of bond performance you can do a ton of cool financial data analysis using Wolfram Alpha
