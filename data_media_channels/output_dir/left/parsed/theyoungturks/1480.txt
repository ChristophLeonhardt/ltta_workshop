I DO WANT TO GIVE A RANDOM
SHOUT OUT HERE.
WE DIDN'T GET TO IT ON ONE OF
THE STORIES WE WERE COVERING.
MY SHOUT OUT IS TO JUDGE
NAPOLITANO ON FOX NEWS.
HE HAS BEEN REALLY HONEST ABOUT
THE TRUMP COVERAGE.
LOW STANDARDS IN THE COUNTRY.
I WANT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT.
KEEPING HIM HONEST.
SOMEONE ON TELEVISION, ON
CABLE NEWS, FOX NEWS BEING
HONEST.
SHEP HAS ALSO BEEN GREAT BUT HE
IS LIBERAL TO MODERATE.
NAPOLITANO IS VERY CONSERVATIVE.
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIM ON AN
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE
CASES AND ISSUES BUT HIM TALKING
ABOUT HOW TRUMP CALLING THE FBI
INFORMANT A SPY, HE SAID IT WAS
A STUNNINGLY UNREMARKABLE EVENT.
IN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT, HE IS A
JUDGE, YOU GET AN INFORMANT.
IT IS NOT A SPY.
HE SAID IT WAS THAT GIULIANI
TALKING ABOUT THE FBI AGENT WAS
TRYING TO SOMEHOW DO A POLITICAL
SPY OPERATION ON TRUMP WAS AN
OUTLANDISH AND OUTRAGEOUS
ALLEGATIONS.
AND TRIMMED REALLY LIKED
NAPOLITANO BECAUSE HE ONLY
WATCHES TV.
NOT ANYMORE.
ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES HE WAS
ASKED ABOUT WHO HE WOULD
PICK FOR THE SUPREME COURT HE
SAID NAPOLITANO BECAUSE
THAT IS THE ONLY JUDGING YOU.
WHAT ABOUT JUDGE JUDY Ã±
OR JUDGE WALTER.
IT COULD OF BEEN.
FOR A GUY TO CONTINUALLY
CRITICIZE HIM ON ALL THE THINGS
HE THINKS HE'S WRONG ABOUT,
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
THESE ARE THE TIMES WE LIVE IN.
