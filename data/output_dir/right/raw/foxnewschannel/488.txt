18
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:41,010

GOOD JOB.

HALF.

VERY COOL, EVERYBODY WAS

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,120
LIKE, HE DIDN'T.

HE MAY YET.

75
00:01:58,288 --> 00:01:59,323
DEPENDING ON HOW THIS THING

76
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:00,257

ELECTION.

95
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:16,006
ANOTHER LESSON TODAY, WHICH

96
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:16,874
IS THAT IF YOU WIN THE

97
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:19,042
SENATE BY ONLY ONE OR TWO

98
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:19,743
VOTES, HAVE YOU TO BE ABLE

00:02:19,743 --> 00:02:21,044

00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:23,013
THIS WEEK.

102
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:23,847
I DON'T THINK MUCH DAMAGE

103
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:26,416
WILL BE DONE PROVIDED ITS

104
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:26,750
LIMITED.

105
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,555
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE WILL ASK

106
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:34,758
FOR AN EXTENSION, YEAH,

107
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:35,058
RIGHT.

108
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,159
I THINK IT'S OKAY.

109
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,795
I ONLY FEEL BADLY FOR THE

110
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:38,128
JUDGE.

111
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:38,796
ANOTHER TERRIBLE WEEK FOR

112
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,532
HIM AND THERE WILL BE SOME

113
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:42,099
CRAZINESS.

114
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,033
>> Bret: A.B., IT REALLY IS

115
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:43,700
JUST NUMBERS HERE.

116
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,035
IF THEY HAD TWO MORE

117
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,004
SENATORS WHO WERE READY TO

118
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:47,971
SIGN ON, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

119
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,040
TO HAVE THIS OVER A BARREL

120
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,841
SITUATION.

121
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:53,610
>> THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS

122
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,645
JUST THE POLITICAL REALITY

123
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:55,946
HAS FORCED THEM INTO THIS

124
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,514
CORNER TO PROVIDE THE FBI

125
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,315
INVESTIGATION AND AN

126
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,383
ADDITIONAL WEEK.

127
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:01,218
THAT SAID, IT IS GOING TO

128
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:02,453
HELP THE SENATE, IT'S GOING

129
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:03,921
TO HELP THE COURT, IT'S

130
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:04,488
GOING TO HELP JUDGE

131
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:05,355
KAVANAUGH AND IT'S GOING TO

132
00:03:05,355 --> 00:03:06,890
HELP THE COUNTRY IF THIS

133
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,394
CONCLUDES IN A CLEANER, MORE

134
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,063
COMPREHENSIVE WAY, A LESS

135
00:03:13,063 --> 00:03:17,368
DIVISIVE PROCESS.

136
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:20,271
AND I JUST THINK AN FBI

137
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:20,905
INVESTIGATION COULD HAVE

138
00:03:20,905 --> 00:03:22,406
BEEN CONCLUDED BY NOW IF IT

139
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,908
WERE ALLOWED 10 DAYS AGO.

140
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,443
I THINK IT'S THE BEST WAY TO

141
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:26,610
SWEAR HIM ONTO THE BENCH OF

142
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,445
THE SUPREME COURT IF THAT'S

143
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,479
WHAT THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO

144
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,746
BE.

145
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:30,281
HE NEEDS THIS REMOVED FROM

146
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:33,451
HIM BEFORE HIS TENURE THERE.

147
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:33,951
>> Bret: MOLLIE?

148
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:34,985
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT THE

149
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,053
REAL REASON WHY PEOPLE WERE

150
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:37,188
ASKING FOR AN FBI

151
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:37,988
INVESTIGATION WAS THAT THEY

152
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,256
WERE JUST TRYING TO DELAY

153
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:39,824
THE PROCESS.

154
00:03:39,824 --> 00:03:40,925
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH

155
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:41,826
HAVING AN FBI INVESTIGATION

156
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:42,293
AT THIS POINT.

157
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,228
AND THERE WERE MANY THINGS

158
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:45,296
THAT HAPPENED THAT ARE GOOD

159
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:46,664
FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO

160
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:47,832
SEE BRETT KAVANAUGH SEATED

161
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:48,499
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

162
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,900
IT GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE

163
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,201
TODAY.

164
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:50,835
THAT WAS HUGE.

165
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,303
IT GOT OUT OF COMMITTEE WITH

166
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:53,170
JEFF FLAKE SAYING IS HE

167
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,373
GOING TO VOTE YES PENDING

168
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:57,508
THIS RETURN OF THIS

169
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:57,942
INVESTIGATION.

170
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,076
AND THE FBI INVESTIGATION

171
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:01,078
ITSELF ACTUALLY HAS FEWER

172
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:01,846
INVESTIGATORY TOOLS THAN THE

173
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:02,446
SENATE HAS.

174
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,914
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPEL

175
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:04,348
TESTIMONY.

176
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:05,516
WE ALREADY KNOW WHO ALL THE

177
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:06,951
PLAYERS ARE THEY HAVE

178
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:07,651
ALREADY GIVEN STATEMENTS.

179
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:08,953
IT SHOULD NOT TAKE LONG IT

180
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,755
ONLY TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO

181
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:11,655
INVESTIGATE THE ANITA HILL

182
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,022
SITUATION.

183
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,525
ONLY TOOK A COUPLE DAYS TO

184
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,360
INVESTIGATE ANTHONY WEINER'S

185
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,793
LAPTOP.

186
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:17,862
CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO TAKE

187
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:19,262
MORE THAN A COUPLE DAYS TO

188
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,765
FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

189
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:21,065

190
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:22,166
THIS PUBLIC APPETITE FOR

191
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,100
DELAY, DELAY, DELAY.

192
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,834
I CAN'T FLY.

193
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:25,570
OH, WE CAN'T FLY WITH THIS

194
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,237
IS GONE.

195
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,772
SO, IT JUST HAS TO HAPPEN

196
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:28,039
NOW.

197
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,206
AND WHEN IT COMES BACK, I

198
00:04:29,206 --> 00:04:30,875
THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

199
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:35,146
>> Bret: IS THERE A

200
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,113
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT ANY

201
00:04:36,113 --> 00:04:37,048
ONE OF THOSE DEMOCRATS ON

202
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:37,882
THE SENATE JUDICIARY

203
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:40,318
COMMITTEE AFTER AN FBI IF IT

204
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,686
COMES BACK CLEARING HIS NAME

205
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:42,987
IS GOING TO SOMEHOW VOTE FOR

206
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:43,588
JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

207
00:04:43,588 --> 00:04:45,023
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE.

208
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:48,026
THESE ARE REDUNDANT

209
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:48,493
INVESTIGATIONS.

210
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,527
INTENDED TO DELAY THE VOTE.

211
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,029
NOT TO SEEK THE TRUTH AS TO

212
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,663
WHAT DID OR DID NOT HAPPEN.

213
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,165
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF

214
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:55,066
THE BAD FAITH THAT THE

215
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,468
DEMOCRATS ARE ARGUING HERE,

216
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:58,870
SHORTLY AFTER -- ALMOST

217
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,871
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

218
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:03,107
REPUBLICANS AGREED TO AN FBI

219
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:04,409
INVESTIGATION, SENATOR CHRIS

220
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,377
MURPHY OF CONNECTICUT, A

221
00:05:06,377 --> 00:05:07,645
DEMOCRAT SENATOR, TWEETED.

222
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:08,579
THIS.

223
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,380
HE SAID OF COURSE THERE

224
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,515
SHOULD BE AN FBI

225
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:11,482
INVESTIGATION BUT WHATEVER

226
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:13,151
THEY FIND DOESN'T CHANGE THE

227
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,285
FACT THAT KAVANAUGH,

228
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,520
ESPECIALLY AFTER HIS

229
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,788
PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY IS THE

230
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:17,488
MOST DANGEROUS SUPREME COURT

231
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:20,792
PICK OF OUR LIFETIME.

232
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:21,592
DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY COME

233
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,794
OUT AND SAID A WEEK?

234
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:23,895
HOW CAN WE GET THIS DONE IN

235
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:24,629
A WEEK?

236
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,563
THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEEKING

237
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:26,631
THE TRUTH, BRET.

238
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,299
IT IS SIMPLY TO RIDE OUT THE

239
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,235
CLOCK HERE TO RUN OUT THE

240
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:30,602
CLOCK.

241
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,135
>> Bret: ALL RIGHT.

242
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:33,004
SO LET'S SAY IN THE ELECTION

243
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,906
COMING UP HOW DOES THIS

244
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:35,206
PLAY?

245
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:35,940
YOU HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO

246
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,142
SAID THEY SUPPORT THIS FBI

247
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:38,576
INVESTIGATION.

248
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,411
HEIDI HEITKAMP AND JOE

249
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:40,912
MANCHIN.

250
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:44,215
TRUMP WON NORTH DAKOTA BY

251
00:05:44,215 --> 00:05:44,515
35.7%.

252
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,718
WEST VIRGINIA BY 42.2%.

253
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:47,852
THEY ARE LOOKING, OBVIOUSLY,

254
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:55,793
AT RACES MAYBE MORE HEITCAMP

255
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,095
THAN MANCHIN, HOW DOES THIS

256
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:57,962
PLAY NOT ONLY WITH THIS

257
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,864
DELAY BUT ALSO FOR WOMEN WHO

258
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:05,603
DO LOOK AT DR. BLASEY FORD

259
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,805
WHO SAY I SEE SOMEONE WHO

260
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:08,006
CAME UP AND TOLD HER STORY?

261
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,908
>> ARE YOU ASKING ME ABOUT

262
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:10,275
WOMEN?

263
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:10,708
>> Bret: YEAH.

264
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,976
>> I DON'T THINK WE ARE

265
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:13,511
ALLOWED TO COMMENT ANYMORE.

266
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:14,145
>> Bret: I'M GOING TO ASK

267
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:15,213
YOU TO, HOLD ON.

268
00:06:15,213 --> 00:06:17,015
>> I THINK IN THE CASE OF A

269
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,016
WOMAN, HEIDI HEITKAMP, I

270
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,317
THINK IF SHE LOOKS AT THE

271
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,619
NUMBERS AND IS FAIR SHE WILL

272
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:23,154
END UP SUPPORTING, IF

273
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,489
NOTHING ELSE COMES OUT ONLY

274
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,757
THING THAT WILL COME OUT IS

275
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,092
MORE CRAZINESS OUT OF THE

276
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,828
WOODWORK, THEN SHE MAY WELL

277
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:31,329
SUPPORT HIM AS WILL MANCHIN.

278
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,065
I THINK THIS IS POSSIBLE IT

279
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,500
COULD HEAL TO SOME EXTENT

280
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,535
WHAT A.B. SAID.

281
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:37,435
ALSO ON THE SAME TIME A PART

282
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:41,473
OF THE THE DEMOCRATS A

283
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:41,806
REUSE.

284
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:43,074
WHAT DOES ONE WEEK GET THEM?

285
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,442
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ONE WEEK

286
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:44,976
GETS THEM.

287
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,578
THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND IT

288
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:47,145
FURTHER, WEREN'T THEY.

289
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,480
>> YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT'S

290
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,648
THEIR PLAN TO PUSH IT PAST

291
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:50,549
THE MID TERMS.

292
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,917
YOU CAN'T TAKE SENATOR COONS

293
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:52,651
AT HIS WORD?

294
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,152
HE ASKED FOR A WEEK.

295
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:55,454
>> I GUESS I CAN'T.

296
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,055
>> WOMEN BELIEVE IN DUE

297
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:57,723
PROCESS THEY HAVE HUSBANDS

298
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,158
AND SONS AND BROTHERS.  BRET

299
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:00,926
LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP

300
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:02,794
TODAY ON THIS TESTIMONY AND

301
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,162
ON DR. FORD.

302
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,331
>> I FEEL THAT HER TESTIMONY

303
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:07,365
WAS VERY COMPELLING.

304
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,667
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE A VERY

305
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,001
FINE WOMAN TO ME.

306
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:15,540
VERY FINE WOMAN.

307
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,510
TESTIMONY,

308
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:18,543
THSTIMONY,

309
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:18,977
THATIMONY,

310
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:19,010
THAT BONY,

311
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,044
THAT BREY,

312
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:22,848
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WS

313
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:22,881
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WL

314
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:11,470
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WK

315
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:22,914
AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT'S

316
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:23,181
THAT BRET'STESTIMONY LIKEWISE WE

317
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,116
SOMETHING I HADN'T SEEN

318
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:24,449
BEFORE.

319
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,518
IT WAS INCREDIBLE MOMENT, I

320
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:27,953
THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

321
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:28,287
COUNTRY.

322
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:31,390
BUT CERTAINLY SHE WAS A VERY

323
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,726
CREDIBLE WITNESS.

324
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,394
SHE WAS VERY GOOD IN MANY

325
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:35,761
RESPECTS.

326
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:37,162
I JUST WANT IT TO WORK OUT

327
00:07:37,162 --> 00:07:38,230
WELL FOR THE COUNTRY.

328
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,101
IF THAT HAPPENS, I'M HAPPY.

329
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:42,568
>> Bret: MOLLIE?

330
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:44,136
>> SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND

331
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:44,737
DR. FORD CREDIBLE.

332
00:07:44,737 --> 00:07:45,671
OTHER PEOPLE WILL NOT.

333
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:46,772
THAT'S WHY IN THIS COUNTRY

334
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,040
WE GO WITH WHAT EVIDENCE IS,

335
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,208
NOT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT

336
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,110
SOMEONE BUT WHETHER YOU HAVE

337
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,277
PROVIDED THE EVIDENCE TO

338
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:53,946
DESTROY A MAN'S LIFE AND TO

339
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:55,514
DESTROY HIS CAREER AND I

340
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:57,216
JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT

341
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,684
JASON SAID, WHICH IS WOMEN

342
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:00,853
ARE NOT SOME MONOLITHIC

343
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:01,153
BLOCK.

344
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,154
WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS

345
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:02,788
ABOUT THINGS.

346
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,556
JUST BECAUSE WE ARE WOMEN

347
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,391
DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T CARE

348
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,559
ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OR

349
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,860
DUE PROCESS OR RULE OF LAW.

350
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,662
WE ALSO JUST CARE VERY

351
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:10,596
DEEPLY AS PEOPLE WHO LOVE

352
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:11,697
MEN, WHO LOVE OUR HUSBANDS

353
00:08:11,697 --> 00:08:12,898
AND OUR FATHERS AND OUR

354
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:13,966
BROTHERS AND OUR SONS.

355
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,134
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A

356
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,502
COUNTRY WHERE YOU CAN HAVE

357
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:17,503
YOUR LIFE DESTROYED WITHOUT

358
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:18,771
HAVING EVIDENCE TO DESTROY

359
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,005
SOMEONE'S LIFE.

360
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,507
>> TWO SEPARATE CREDIBILITY

361
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:22,708
QUESTIONS I THINK ARE BEING

362
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,243
COLLAPSED INTO ONE.

363
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:25,678
EMOTIONAL CREDIBILITY AND

364
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:26,845
FACTUAL CREDIBILITY.

365
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,180
EMOTIONALLY, THEY WERE BOTH

366
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,481
CREDIBLE, SEEMS TO ME THEY

367
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:30,516
WERE BOTH PERSUASIVE.

368
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,717
I GENERALLY BELIEVE SHE

369
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:34,053
BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING.

370
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:34,787
I KNOW BRETT KAVANAUGH

371
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:35,621
BELIEVES WHAT HE IS SAYING.

372
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,323
IN TERMS OF FACTUAL

373
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:39,758
CREDIBILITY, THE CASE IS

374
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:40,392
OVERWHELMINGLY STRONG FOR

375
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:41,360
KAVANAUGH, AND SHE HAS NO

376
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,995
EVIDENCE, FACTUAL

377
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:43,395
CREDIBILITY.

378
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,031
>> BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS

379
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,600
PASSED A HALF DOZEN FBI

380
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,934
BACKGROUND CHECKS IN THE

381
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,170
PAST QUARTER CENTURY.

382
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,770
>> Bret: WITHOUT THE

383
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,938
ALLEGATIONS THOUGH.

384
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,373
I GET IT, THE ALLEGATIONS

385
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:55,341
UNDERSTANDING THE TIMING AND

386
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:56,175
PROCESS THEY WEREN'T A PART

387
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,343
OF THOSE SIX INVESTIGATIONS.

388
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,444
>> YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY

389
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,046
WORK, YOU WERE ASKED I HAVE

390
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:01,380
BEEN THROUGH DOZENS OF THEM

391
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,548
AND YOU ARE ASKED IS THERE

392
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:03,849
ANYTHING IN THIS PERSON'S

393
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:04,550
BACKGROUND THAT OUGHT TO BE

394
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,285
BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION,

395
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:08,421
WHICH SUGGESTS INVITATION

396
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,956
WITH PROBLEM OF CHARACTER,

397
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:10,890
RELIABILITY, DEPENDABILITY,

398
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,725
VIOLATIONS OF LAW.

399
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:13,359
>> Bret: THERE ARE TWO

400
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,427
SEPARATE THINGS HERE, ONE IS

401
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,561
THE PROCESS THE DEMOCRATS

402
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,630
HAD AND HOW THEY HELD THE

403
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,901
BALL AND FEINSTEIN HAD THE

404
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,502
LETTER THEY COULD HAVE

405
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:23,469
STARTED THIS PROCESS A LONG

406
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:23,937
TIME AGO.

407
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:25,071
THE OTHER IS THE ACTUAL

408
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:25,905
CREDIBILITY OF THE INCIDENT

409
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:28,141
IN THE EARLY 1980S, THOSE

410
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:29,075
ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.

411
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:31,711
>> IF I I HAVE CRITICISM OF

412
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,879
THE PROCESS THE WAY BOTH

413
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,114
PARTIES HAVE HANDLED IT AND

414
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,348
I THINK YOU CAN CRITICIZE

415
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:37,350
THE DEMOCRATS IF IN A WEEK

416
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,419
ASK FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION.

417
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,454
BUT THEY HAVE, IN GOOD FAITH

418
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:42,689
JOINED WITH JEFF FLAKE WHO

419
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,124
HAS GIVEN THEM COVER.

420
00:09:44,124 --> 00:09:45,025
>> YES, HE WAS.

421
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,960
>> GIVEN COLLINS COVER,

422
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,161
MURKOWSKI COVER, DEMOCRATS

423
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:49,262
IN RED STATES COVER TO BE

424
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:50,764
ABLE TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

425
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:51,731
KAVANAUGH BY SAYING THIS WAS

426
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:57,170
A CLEAN PROCESS.

427
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,171
WOMEN AND MEN OUT THERE

428
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:00,140
WATCHING THIS TESTIMONY

429
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,840
YESTERDAY AND MILLIONS OF

430
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,142
THEM DID WHO ARE NOT

431
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,677
PARTISANS AND NOT MEMBERS OF

432
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:05,312
THE POLITICAL DO NOT KNOW

433
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,813
ABOUT JULY 30TH AND SOME

434
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,881
LETTER FROM FEINSTEIN'S

435
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:08,214
OFFICE.

436
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:09,582
WHAT THEY LEARNED ABOUT

437
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:10,617
YESTERDAY IS THERE HASN'T

438
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:11,518
BEEN AN FBI INVESTIGATION

439
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:13,019
AND SUBPOENA FOR MARK JUDGE.

440
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,120
THEY HEARD IT ALL DAY LONG.

441
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,288
AND THEY WANT TO KNOW THE

442
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,122
ANSWER TO THAT.

443
00:10:16,122 --> 00:10:17,791
WHICH IS WHY JEFF FLAKE CAME

444
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:22,662
OUT WITH THIS DEMAND.

445
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:26,599
IT IS -- IN THE INTEREST OF

446
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,033
HEALING --

447
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:27,667
>> Bret: DO YOU THINK ANY

448
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,568
DEMOCRATS AT THE END OF A

449
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:29,602
WEEK WHEN THE FBI COMES BACK

450
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:30,770
AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT?

451
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,138
WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT

452
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:32,839
CORROBORATES HER STORY.

453
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,274
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THOSE

454
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:34,674
DEMOCRATS --

455
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:37,010
>> -- I THINK HEITKAMP --

456
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,546
SENATOR HEITKAMP AND

457
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:39,879
MANCHIN.

458
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,580
>> COONS?

459
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,915
ANYBODY ON THE SENATE

460
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:42,282
JUDICIARY.

461
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:43,283
>> COONS ALREADY SAID IS HE

462
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,884
VOTING NO AFTER THE HEARING

463
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:48,655
EXECUTIVE POWER.

464
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:49,189
>> Bret: KLOBUCHAR.

465
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:49,856
>> HEALING THE DIVISIONS OF

466
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:50,724
THE COMMITTEE AND NOT

467
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:51,458
TRASHING THE SENATE.

468
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,459
THEY ALREADY HAVE COMPLAINTS

469
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,361
ON HIM ON POLICY QUESTION.

470
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,028
>> Bret: THAT'S MY POINT.

471
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:55,829
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT HEALING

472
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,030
THE DIVIDES THAT HAVE

473
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,897
EXPLODED IN THE LAST FEW

474
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:58,932
DAYS ABOUT THE PROCESS AND

475
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,400
HELPING THE COURT RETAIN ITS

476
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,202
RESPECT AND TRUST IN THIS

477
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,236
COUNTRY AS THE ONLY

478
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,773
INSTITUTION LEFT THAT HAS IT

479
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:08,408
MY POINT IS LINDSEY GRAHAM

480
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:09,843
POINTED FOR ALL OF THESE

481
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:10,210
SENATORS.

482
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,144
>> UNFORTUNATELY THOSE DAYS

483
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,579
ARE DONE I AGREE WITH YOU.

484
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,548
I WISH THIS WAS A BIPARTISAN

485
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:14,881
PROCESS.

486
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:15,949
>> BUT THE PRECEDENT IS

487
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:16,483
IMPORTANT HERE.

488
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:17,417
THINK OF THE PRESS DENTING

489
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,352
WE ARE SETTING.

490
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:21,355
ALLEGATIONS DECADES OLD AND

491
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,856
ALLEGATIONS ALONE NONE OF

492
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,157
DR. FORD'S SUPPOSED

493
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:24,825
WITNESSES CORROBORATE WHAT

494
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,827
SHE IS SAYING AND SEVERAL OF

495
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:28,762
THEM REFUTE WHAT SHE IS

496
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:29,096
SAYING.

497
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:30,464
THINK OF THE PRECEDENCE.

498
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,065
>> I HAVE COMPLAINTS WITH

499
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,100
BOTH PARTIES ABOUT HOW THEY

500
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,401
HAVE HANDLED THE NOMINATION

501
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,135
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

502
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:36,403
I THINK IT'S IN HIS BEST

503
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,638
INTEREST TO GO THROUGH WITH

504
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:38,705
THIS AND SEE IT THROUGH

505
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:41,174
ANOTHER WEEK AND NOT GO

506
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:41,475
PAST.

507
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,877
>> I THINK THIS WEEK WILL DO

508
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:46,480
A LOT TO PROVIDE HEALING FOR

509
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,681
THE LEFT.

510
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,116
THE RIGHT WILL NEED HEALING

511
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,217
FROM WHAT THEY SAW THIS MAN

512
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,418
BEING PUT THROUGH.

513
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,053
THAT'S WHAT SOME PEOPLE NEED

514
00:11:53,053 --> 00:00:00,000
THOUGH THINK ABOUT AND ANGER
