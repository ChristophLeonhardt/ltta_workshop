Donald Trump is finally really upset about police use of deadly force against unarmed black men well I'd say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very is a very difficult time now he wasn't talking about America's enduring problem of police use of deadly force against unarmed black men he was talking about himself and people he knows like Brett Kavanaugh who get accused of sexual assault of course the big difference between Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh is that Donald Trump has actually admitted that he is a sexual assault her and he has described exactly the way he likes to grab women when he first meets them and assaults them so why is it so scary for young men in America who might be accused of this is the country where you can still grow up to be president even if you are very credibly accused of sexual assault and even if you actually admit to it yourself you could be somebody that was perfect your entire life and somebody could accuse you of something doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say but somebody could accuse you of something and you're automatically guilty but in this realm you are truly guilty until proven innocent that's one of the very very bad things that's taking place right now joining us now Jason Johnson politics editor at the root common and MSNBC contributor and Dalia looook is back with us and so Jason Donald Trump doesn't see any of this as a teachable moment for the men of America doesn't see it as a teachable moment for his young son of course not because the president is a living example that you can be abusive you can be verbally abusive to women you can be physically abusive to women you can be professionally abusive to women you can be sexually abusive to women and 53% of white women in America will still vote for you that's what he is operating under and I think we need to talk about the fact that for every horrible wretched thing that the president says in support of misogynistic and violent men there are women in this country who are just as invested in that kind of patriarchy and we have to address that as well because that is part of why men like Brett Kavanaugh have been able to score it through in their lives men like Donald Trump have been able to get through in their lives because there are also women that support them in this kind of behavior and dahlia it wouldn't occur to Donald Trump just how scary the world has been a world that that has a crime called rape it has a an attack on a human being called rape and that's never crossed Donald Trump's mind of what it's like to live with that it's an extraordinary lesson in first of all that the rule of Trump is but enough about Cavanaugh let's talk about me right and immediately the narcissism kicks in and now we're talking about him and in it's an extraordinary moment if you have lived the week this country has lived where I'm sure it's happened to you women I've known for decades are coming out and saying I'm now coming forward this is killing me I'm going to tell my truth and we've seen that explode into reality and an amazing Washington Post story today about why women don't tell their fathers and for Donald Trump to be wearing the Donald Trump Roy Moore rub for their headphones that are just like that poor guy you know all of the reality that has been materially true in a way this week that I've never seen that that just elides him completely because all he can think about is that these 1 in 4 1 in 3 women who are reporting sexual assault are all lying to setup men and maybe extract money and Jason it's even more perverse than that with Donald Trump he had a bunch of Republicans in the Rose Garden the other day for this discussion about trade and he pointed to them and said there's stories about every one of them he except Mike Pence he said there are stories about every one of them that Donald Trump stirred he's lying of course he's making that up but those buffoons those Republican buffoons sat there and laughed and clapped when Donald Trump accused every one of them of being at least as guilty as Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault well we hope he was kidding right I mean we don't know what the president might not but I think it was like all Trump accusations it's based on absolutely nothing whether he exactly was correct about some of them is another matter right I think though in Lawrence you point out the most dangerous thing about this is that they all laughed that they they cosign this kind of abusive behavior that he's surrounded by that kind of locker room talk that allows this president to feel that this is okay and and I think one of the most disturbing things that we've seen above and beyond the possibility of Brett Kavanaugh getting on the Supreme Court after all of this is to see an entire political party basically Gaslight sexual violence survivors in this country for seven days I have heard so many people men and women in my life talk about how this is traumatizing to watch and to see a President of the United States mock and defend this man a man who arguably hasn't done a good job of defending himself Brett Kavanaugh is doing so much damage to the mental and emotional state of this country it is an embarrassment and I hope that anybody any of these Republican senators and certainly some of these wavering Democrats if they watch this president's behavior if they watch up at this rally tonight they should be ashamed of themselves if they can still vote for Brett Kavanaugh or Bart Kavanaugh and Adalia of my parents and the nuns who had me in elementary school scared me very clearly about my capacity as a child to do something that I would regret for the rest of my life to do something that would haunt me for the rest of my life and my decision upon learning that was to not do anything like that I didn't live in some terror that I might I have Queen and teenage boys and I think that we have as a country done such extraordinary work in the last few years trying to explain to them about consent and about alcohol and about confusion and mixed signals and Donald Trump gets a whole bunch of people in Mississippi chanting lock her up about Christine Blasi Ford who do nothing other than come forward and tell to the best of her recollection the truth and the idea that we can set this back that we can in fact say not just watch what you do because you can hurt someone I like to think we're still communicating that to our children but that if you are a victim of something that was confusing and unclear and embarrassing and filled with laughter by the perpetrators and you come forward a whole bunch of people in Mississippi are gonna chant like her it's it's you keep thinking it's rock bottom and then it's there's a basement Mississippi holding on to its place in the traditional very very darkest corners of American culture Jason Johnson Dahlia with Wieck thank you very much for joining us tonight thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for
