When I’m spinning I feel calm.
Like, it relaxes me.
Especially when I’m doing the suicide
slide, it's like a stress reliever for me.
And, the smell of burning tires just, I don’t
know, it just makes me feel so at home.
I actually just wanted to learn how to
drive. I mean, nobody wanted to teach
me because I was too young so I just got
into a car and started driving on my own.
Spinning was illegal, it was more
of a gangster sport.
People used to steal cars and
go and spin it.
Today spinning is more of a family sport.
We have controlled environments.
It's now a legal sport in South Africa.
It’s now, part of our life,
it’s part of our culture.
I don’t feel scared because, before
I go spinning, I get into my car and
I start praying, asking
God to keep me safe.
When I’m in that car, my face, it’s just,
you can’t explain the look on my face.
I feel like nobody can tell me
what to do, what to be.
I’m just being myself. And
that’s amazing because I feel
like I’m on top of the world,
like I control everything.
I tried a new stunt, and I
ended up falling
off the bonnet and getting hurt.
After I fell and got hurt, I decided that
I'm not going to let that stop me.
I got back up and I went back out
to show the world that
this is what I do for love.
I think it's very important for women to
experience feeling in control because at
that second it’s like the world is yours,
you can do whatever you want with it.
I plan on opening up a school for
spinning, and showing younger females
that you can spin, you can do
anything you set your mind to.
I mean, the sky's the limit,
just do your best.
