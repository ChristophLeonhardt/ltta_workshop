what I do believe is that the scientific materialist world view cannot construct a moral system because is has nothing to do with thought science is about isn't has no capacity to say anything about God other than instructions that are based in a notion of free will but you yourself reject I'm a well I'm happy to get into all that you know time is short but I've written two books on on those two but if that were true how would you explain the moral character of my life I'm assuming I'm not raping and killing people live in a very way a life that you would recognize today I mean as I just I just said moments ago I don't think that you have to be able to person to leave immoral life I do think that there has to be religious underpinning to a moral system
