00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:48,130
of Western democracy was a guest on

total rock radio for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time in</font>

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks Matt received loads of</font>

325
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,009
amazing shirts from my friend or riot

326
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:55,899
thank you which included this one

327
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,060
standing rock proved the true power of

328
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,970
nonviolent resistance in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North Dakota so</font>

329
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,339
so inspiring even though the battle is

330
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,339
far from over a rival I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember a</font>

331
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,720
movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me feeling more</font>

332
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,449
blown away with such powerful nuances

333
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,430
tailored into its message glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

334
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,319
that one us politician is making an

335
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:15,880
effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with those</font>

337
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,410
third bugged me but the final third was

338
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,600
absolutely incredible loved it overall

339
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,610
spent Christmas at my parents with my

340
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,040
brother and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fiancee oh and little</font>

341
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,139
Theo of course played some VR<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

342
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,209
received so many great gifts some that

343
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,980
were practical ones that made me smile

344
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,639
and ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fell into both categories</font>

345
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,639
what year and now I've got to reflect on

346
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">it all it has been a huge battle with</font>

347
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,990
myself and there were some struggles

348
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,990
that I didn't touch upon because it was

349
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">constant throughout the year and they</font>

350
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,839
relate to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my depression I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying</font>

351
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,389
to take off these shackles of my past

352
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:03,819
with my injury the fact it exacerbated

353
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,120
certain characteristics of me December

354
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this will be the first month that I have</font>

355
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,470
kicked an addiction in a very long time

356
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,380
which has had knock-on effects see my

357
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,150
financial situation where I've been

358
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,090
going in debt<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much and my family has</font>

359
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,560
been there every step of the way

360
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,750
supporting me and that has obviously

361
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,330
caused issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my depression</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and my</font>

362
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,290
feeling of self-worth and it's weird

363
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you never think it's going to</font>

364

happen to you it was the case with the

365
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,310
head injury which I laughed off when the

366
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,860
doctor said you'll probably have

367
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,480
concussion for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of weeks and you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 23 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later here we are still</font>

369
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,570
and it was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when doing cognitive</font>

370
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,950
behavioral therapy and learning these

371

tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking back I realized how</font>

372
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,950
far I had come and I was only going to

373
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get further if I acknowledged the things</font>

374
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,140
that were wrong with me not to say I'm

375
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,330
inherently flawed but to know if I

376
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,040
identified the problems I could move

377
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward and I kept falling back on many</font>

378
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,690
occasions i had many arguments for my

379
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,200
family who were concerned for me they

380
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to be in a better place but</font>

381
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
they stuck<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,250
friends my<font color="#CCCCCC"> family and all my viewers out</font>

383
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,020
there who have shown so much love<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

384
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,820
support for me throughout this

385
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,320
incredibly difficult time because

386
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,840
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> you much of this would not have</font>

387
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,910
been possible so to end on a few key

388
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,580
points despite what<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people say I</font>

389
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,710
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's an age of post truth</font>

390
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,260
that we live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> but instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of anti</font>

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">nuance which in many ways is far more</font>

392
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,880
dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is intellectually dishonest</font>

393
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,760
when people focus on an abusive minority

394
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,610
in public discourse as a means to define

395
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,890
a wider group and that's something we

396
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,720
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try so much harder in the new</font>

397
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,940
year to combat continue to vent anger

398
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,770
and frustration at those that don't

399
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,500
think the same way as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

400
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,730
societal divisions will only worsen

401
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,100
there were many doors I open this year

402
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,350
we're behind it was a big monster named

403
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,440
anxiety and what I realized is that

404
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,570
closing the door again is only half the

405
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,450
battle life is generally good but when

406
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,300
it's not it's just progress<font color="#CCCCCC"> in process</font>

407
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,190
yes there are a lot of struggles that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

408
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,320
have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of yes there are going</font>

409
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be some huge challenges waiting for</font>

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,030
us over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horizon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

411
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,850
organize and use technology to liberate

412
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,070
the individuals around the world who are

413
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">geographically isolated we</font>
