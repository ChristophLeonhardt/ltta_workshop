Hi friends.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,810
This week I turn 27.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:13,440
So I want to capture what being 26 is like.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,680
[slow drum & bass beat]

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,550
26 has been a reconstruction.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,230
I started the year living in my parent’s
house in WI and unemployed.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,840
My world was my childhood bedroom.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,360
And i felt like a total failure.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,470
But of course, I wasn’t a failure, I just
wasn’t patient enough.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,630
2 weeks later, moved to new york for a job.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,470
Everything I owned fit in this trunk.

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,041
So there was this thing I used to do when
I was broke and living at home.I would imagine

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,910
what my life would be like once I could afford
to get my own place.

14
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,070
I had a secret pinterest board where I would
decorate my imaginary apartment and dream

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,960
of being independent.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,079
AT 26 I like to I work, and then for fun I
work.

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,410
Or look at makeup and skincare reviews.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,000
Or make playlists or write, which is kind
of work, but kind of art.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,200
Slowly, I constructed a life for myself.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,290
I went to work, I saved my money, I paid back
everything I owed my parents for helping me

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,290
move.

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,590
And Reader, I bought that bed, and that bookshelf,
and that desk, and that art, And I made my

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,770
little tiny apartment exactly how I wanted
it to be.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,049
I built my life.

25
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,619
And everything that was in it was what *I*
chose.

26
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:35,090
It was mine.

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,659
[slow drum & bass beat]

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:50,590
I also got to go to LA, and to London, I created
some change, I made new friends at work, sometimes

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,060
a dog came to visit.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,480
my world got bigger and bigger.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Until it started getting smaller.

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,340
At 26, I also worry—that I’m not doing
enough to make the world better.

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,729
I worry i’ve run out of stories to tell
and that no one wants to hear them anymore.

34
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,409
I worry that I use the word I to much.

35
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:15,849
The job I moved here for wasn’t everything
i hoped it would be.

36
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,959
I felt so angry and unheard.

37
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,030
And a friend from work gently suggested I
go back to therapy, which was a gift.

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,939
It helped me decide that I didn’t have to
let anyone make me feel so small.

39
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,540
So I left.

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,950
And I found another job that fit so much better.

41
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,379
At 26, I have the gift of a group chat to
gas me up when i needed it, a beautiful queer

42
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:45,299
family who just gets all the context of me,
and I have myself.

43
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,049
I have my independence.

44
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:49,959
But better still wasn’t enough.

45
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,290
I decided this year would be the year of asking
for what I want but I didn’t anticipate

46
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,109
that the answer to almost all the questions
would be no.

47
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:04,519
Even though I have been working my ass off,
and making what I thought were some of my

48
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,519
best videos.

49
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,680
See, part of my brain is a little jealous
demon that hates when other people succeed

50
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,090
while I’m still floundering.

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,449
I know she’s not helpful.

52
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:19,750
But I’ve just been constructing and reconstructing
my life and myself and for what?

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,750
[record scratch]

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,280
I think maybe I need to build something else,
build something new, I just don’t know what

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,599
that is yet.

56
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,870
AT 26.

57
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:39,760
I secretly wish that I could be a rock star,
but more rock stars have died at 27 than have

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,809
started writing music at that age.

59
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:49,299
I feel most powerful, wearing all black, standing
on a subway platform, headphones on.

60
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,760
Here’s what I hope for 27.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,229
I hope I can figure out what type of thing
I want to make next, and that people whose

62
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:00,709
opinions I care about will like that thing.

63
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,209
But if they don’t, I hope that won’t discourage
me.

64
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,180
I hope I can make myself useful in ways that
are not about me.

65
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,349
I hope I can worry a little less about what
opportunities that other people are getting,

66
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:14,829
and make my own.

67
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:18,970
I hope that if I take everything apart again,
I still know who I am.

68
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,500
Because I still believe in my potential.

69
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:35,070
And I’m going to make it something real.

70
00:04:35,070 --> 00:00:00,000
