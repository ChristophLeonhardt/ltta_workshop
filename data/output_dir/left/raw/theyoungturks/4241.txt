1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,209
NOW THAT DONALD TRUMP
IS THE PRESIDENT, HOW IS THE GUN

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:04,930
INDUSTRY RESPONDING?

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,270
THERE HAS
BEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,070
OF SALES FOR THE GUN INDUSTRY.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,450
THE DIFFERENCE IS PRETTY STARK.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,810
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, SHARES OF
GUN MAKER RGR DOWN AS MUCH AS

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,390
9% AFTER REPORTING RESULTS
WEDNESDAY THAT MISSED

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,390
EXPECTATIONS.

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,730
IN THE SECOND
QUARTER SALES WERE DOWN 22%

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,090
AGAINST THE SAME PERIOD LAST
YEAR WHILE PROFITS FELL A TOTAL

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,870
OF 53%.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,720
WHEN DEMOCRATS ARE IN
OFFICE IT IS GREAT BUSINESS FOR

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,560
GUN MANUFACTURERS BECAUSE THERE
IS THIS FEAR OF GUN REGULATION,

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,520
GUN CONTROL.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,621
SINCE THEY ARE
WORRIED ABOUT IT THEY WILL GO

16
00:00:50,621 --> 00:01:06,810
OUT AND BUY GUNS 

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,070
AND STOCKPILE.

18
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,020
THEY ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,649
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT NECESSARILY
GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

20
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:23,120
>> IT'S NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY
ARE NOT AS AFRAID UNDER TRUMP,

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,570
BUT ALSO DURING THE ELECTION
THAT IS WHEN THEY WERE DOING ALL

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,920
THE PROPAGANDA.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,310
PEOPLE PANICKED
AND STOCKPILED.

24
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,450
THEN THAT MEANS

25
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,310
THEY ALSO HAVE LESS MONEY TO
BUY ALL THEIR GUNS NOW.

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,090
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SALES
ARE GOING DOWN.

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,700
>> KEEP IN MIND THE NRA ENDORSED
AS POLITICIANS, THEY ENDORSED

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,350
DONALD TRUMP.

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,670
THE NRA IS ALSO
VERY CLOSELY TIED TO THESE GUN

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,670
MANUFACTURERS.

31
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,600
GUN MANUFACTURERS
FUND THE NRA, WHICH IS WHY IT IS

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,030
A POWERFUL LOBBYING GROUP.

33
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,100
I WAS
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THEY DO TO

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,600
MAKE UP FOR SLUGGISH SALES.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,950
THIS
QUOTE KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,600
OF WHAT THEIR MENTALITY IS AND
WHAT THEIR MARKETING STRATEGY

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,310
IS.

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:21,819
THIS IS BASED ON THE CEO OF
RGR.

39
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:37,450
IT IS 

40
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,000
THIS CYCLE OF

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,220
PARANOIA.

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,180
MORE PARANOIA LEADS TO
MORE PEOPLE BUYING GUNS, MORE

43
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,340
GUNS LEAD TO MORE VIOLENCE,
WHICH LEAD TO MORE COPS FEELING

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,020
PARANOID.

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,410
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE.

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,630
IT'S FASCINATING TO SEE AT WORK.

47
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:04,739
>>IT'S FASCINATING FOR HIM TO
ADMIT IT.

48
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,650
IF YOU BREAK IT DOWN

49
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,530
INTO HUMAN TERMS IT IS
INCREDIBLY GROSS.

50
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,530
HE IS SAYING

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:18,290
BASICALLY COPS ARE AFRAID THAT
YOU HAVE A GUN, SO THEY ARE MORE

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,560
LIKELY TO SHOOT, THAT MAKES
PEOPLE SAY BACK OFF.

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,560
HE THEN

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,379
CLAIMS THAT NOW CRIME IS RUNNING
RAMPANT BECAUSE OF THAT.

55
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,379
THERE

56
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:28,379
IS NO PROOF OF THAT.

57
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,600
THAT MAKES
A VIDEO ELSE NERVOUS.

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,270
BUT IT IS

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,400
GOOD NEWS FOR US BECAUSE IT
DRIVES DEMAND AS LONG AS

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
EVERYBODY IS AFRAID.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,900
BUT THE
FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE IS

62
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,610
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.

63
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,819
WHAT WE SEE
TO BE A VICIOUS CYCLE, NEW

64
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,410
SHOOTERS, THEN PEOPLE GET WORD
AND GRAB THEIR GUNS OR BUY NEW

65
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,130
GUNS AND THEN THERE ARE MORE
SHOOTINGS BECAUSE OF THAT.

66
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,130
IF

67
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,640
YOU ARE A GUN MAKER, THAT IS A
VIRTUOUS CYCLE.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
THAT LEADS TO

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,100
MORE PROFITS.

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,760
BUT AS THE CEO
BASICALLY ADMITTING THAT IT IS

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,470
GOOD NEWS.

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,050
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE
HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,140
THOUGH.

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,370
LAST YEAR THERE WAS
LITERALLY ONE MASS SHOOTING

75
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,650
WHERE FOUR PEOPLE WERE SHOT
EVERY DAY.

76
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,650
ON THE OTHER HAND

77
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:36,229
THEY ARE LIKE THIS 
IS GREAT.

78
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,259
>>TO BE FAIR DEMOCRATS KIND OF
PROPOSE GUN LEGISLATION.

79
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:51,059
>> BY THE WAY LEGISLATION THAT
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF GUN

80
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:56,190
OWNERS AGREE WITH.

81
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:07,219
73% OF NRA
MEMBERS AGREE WITH THE

82
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:11,310
LEGISLATION THAT WAS PROPOSED BY
THE DEMOCRATS DURING OBAMA.

83
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,310
BUT

84
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:19,509
THE NRA GETS MOST OF THEIR
FUNDING FROM GUN MANUFACTURERS.

85
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,439
CRIME LEADS TO MORE PARANOIA
WHICH LEADS TO MORE GUN SALES.

86
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,400
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
PROBLEM WITH CRIME.

87
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,529
>>WHEN I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IS ñ
EVEN THE MAJORITY OF NRA MEMBERS

88
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:35,820
ARE IN FAVOR OF CLOSING THE
LOOPHOLES TO ENSURE THAT GUYS

89
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,860
DON'T GET ACCESS TO GUNS.

90
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,409
HOW
COME EVERY TIME THERE IS ANY

91
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:47,410
TYPE OF DEBATE OR DISCUSSION IT
IMMEDIATELY DEVOLVES INTO TWO

92
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,800
INSANELY POLARIZED GROUPS THAT
REFUSE TO SEE THE PERSPECTIVES

93
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
OF ONE ANOTHER.

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:59,229
I AM NOT IN
FAVOR OF BANNING GUNS.

95
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,229
I'M IN

96
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,509
FAVOR OF THE BACKGROUND CHECKS,
CLOSING THINGS LIKE GUN SHOW

97
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,610
LOOPHOLES.

98
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,059
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
I AM ALSO VERY WELL AWARE OF HOW

99
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:18,899
THE NRA IS FUNDED, HOW THEY ARE
CORRUPTED BY GUN MANUFACTURERS,

100
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,569
HOW IT ALL HAS TO DO WITH
PROFIT.

101
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:23,569
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

102
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,110
HARD-CORE GUN ADVOCATES ARE YOU
AT LEAST ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

103
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,110
THAT?

104
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,900
>>I THINK THE 27% ñ IT'S NOT
LIKE THEY DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT,

105
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,960
THEY ARE SUPER FIRM.

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,080
THEY HAVE
BEEN RILED UP FOR THE PROFIT OF

107
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,990
OTHERS.

108
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,599
IF YOU PROPOSE
LEGISLATION WHERE YOU KNOW WHO

109
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,490
BOUGHT THE GUN AND THEY ARE NOT
MENTALLY DERANGED OR A FELON

110
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,889
THAT WILL LEAD TO ñ IF YOU HAVE
A TERRORIST WATCH LIST AND WE

111
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,580
DON'T LET TERRORISTS BUY GUNS
NEXT THING YOU KNOW WE WON'T LET

112
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,669
CITIZENS BUY GUNS.

113
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:26,740
THE SLIPPERY
SLOPE SLIDES BOTH WAYS.

114
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,189
THAT IS

115
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:29,740
PRETTY EXTREME ALREADY.

116
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,111
BUT THEN
YOU CAN SAY WE SHOULD LET THE

117
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:40,149
PEOPLE ON THE TERRORIST WATCH
LIST BY BAZOOKAS.

118
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:41,149
THE SLIPPERY

119
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,960
SLOPE SLIDES BOTH WAYS.

120
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,659
BUT THEY
DON'T HEAR THAT.

121
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,800
THE REASON THEY

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,369
THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS
A SOPHISTICATED PROPAGANDA

123
00:07:52,369 --> 00:08:05,139
CAMPAIGN DONE TO DRIVE GUN
SALES.

124
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,770
BUT I DO ENJOY THE IRONY

125
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,349
OF THEM SUPPORTING REPUBLICANS
AND FINDING OUT.

126
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,349
LOOKS LIKE THEY

127
00:08:14,349 --> 00:00:00,000
SHOT THEMSELVES IN 
THE FOOT.
