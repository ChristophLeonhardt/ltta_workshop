I love the idea that the government made the banks do the subprime mortgages and ecology the government twist the banks are billions upon billions of dollars oh man oh don't make me make another million no baby make another billion no they did those if they thought they're gonna lose money off of it they would have a fiduciary responsibility not to do it I agree okay it was they were not forced to make billions of dollars they were not forced to then have us bail them out they did all that because there's legalized bribery in America right because the government was giving them money so so now let me address that you say well what's the difference between your speech in their speech mine is actually speech and theirs is money so there's a giant different you spend money first off so they say no no Supreme Court says no money's speech now no money's property it's not speech and so if money was speech well then if you go to a hooker and you say oh no I office er I was just talking to her okay money is in the hot speech so for example to give you a sense of it to compare me saying I like Bernie Sanders and you saying whoever you like is the equivalent of this is obviously nonsensical I believe it's obvious so in a five-year recent five-year period the top 200 corporate givers they both in donations and in lobbying spent 5.8 billion dollars okay so that is not the same thing as me saying hey I like what Bernie is saying about college and Medicare and and when they did why do you think they did it was not because hey they genuinely liked Bernie or Trump or Hillary because in return for that 5.8 billion dollars they got four point four trillion dollars in government subsidies so which leads which leads to I actually think the biggest point here the difference between big government and small government so a lot of times conservatives say oh you guys like big government that's not true so let me explain if I ask you hey you got a plumbing job what would you like big pipes or small pipes I don't know what's the job we have it depends it's the same thing with the government okay what size government would you like I don't know what's the job we have so to say big government or skull government doesn't make any sense so for example do I want a big government that invades Iraq hell no I don't no way and and then you were vociferously for the Iraq war so in that sense you owe the big government couldn't get enough of it and I could go on and on and on Republicans say no no we don't like big government but we'd like to be inside your uterus so just admit it it's no problem just say it say I love big government it's okay so you're talking about when you like tack when you're rich and you want tax cuts oh no I don't want big government I want small government but when it's convened for you you'd like oil subsidies and you'd like Wars and you'd like to meddle in people's private lives then you love big government if you liked this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
