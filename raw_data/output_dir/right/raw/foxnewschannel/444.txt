00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:08,129
PARTY IS FINALLY FINISHED ITS

3
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:10,164
PROBE OF THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF

4
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,132
THE DNC KEITH ELLISON.

5
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:14,335
AS LAW FIRMS AS THE ALLEGATIONS

6
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:16,137
AGAINST ELLISON CAN'T BE

7
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:16,771
SUBSTANTIATED BECAUSE THE

8
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,907
ACCUSER DOESN'T HAVE VIDEOTAPE.

9
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:22,244
THEY ARE IGNORING HER WORD, THAT

10
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:25,313
WOULD BE CALLED VICTIM SHAMING.

11
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,648
KAREN HOUSLEY, THE U.S. SENATE

12
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:28,116
CANDIDATE FROM MINNESOTA AND SHE

13
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:28,617
JOINS US TONIGHT.

14
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:30,919
KAREN ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THIS

15
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,821
NEW STANDARD THAT THE DNC HAS A

16
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,323
TICKET RELATED?

17
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:35,624
>> NO.

18
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:38,393
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.

19
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:39,327
IT JUST SO THE HYPOCRISY OF THE

20
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,061
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE DOUBLE

21
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:41,529
STANDARD THAT THEY DO HAVE.

22
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:46,968
I AM RUNNING FOR THE MEAT TO

23
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:48,169
AL FRANKEN SEAT AND MY OPPONENT

24
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:49,371
IS STILL OUT THERE CAMPAIGNING

25
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:49,738
WITH THEM.

26
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,641
SHE SAYS THAT KEITH ELLISON

27
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,643
CATEGORICALLY DENIES THESE

28
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:55,343
ALLEGATIONS.

29
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,745
THEREFORE SHE BELIEVES THEM AND

30
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,513
SHE STANDS WITH THEM.

31
00:00:58,513 --> 00:00:59,247
ONE IT IS BRETT KAVANAUGH OR A

32
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,417
REPUBLICAN THEY WANT TO PULL A

33
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:02,851
INVESTIGATION.

34
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,486
IT SHOWS THE HYPOCRISY.

35
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:07,756
THE INVESTIGATION WAS DONE OF

36
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:08,757
KEITH ELLISON WHO WAS THE VICE

37
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,725
CHAIR OF THE DNC PARTY, DEAD BY

38
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,294
THE LAW FIRM OF A DEMOCRATIC OF

39
00:01:12,294 --> 00:01:15,564
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MINNESOTA.

40
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:16,231
IT IS LIKE THE FOX

41
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:21,336
WATCHING THE HENHOUSE.

42
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:22,905
KAREN MONAHAN, KEITH ELLISON'S

43
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:23,572
FORMER GIRLFRIEND.

44
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:25,474
SHE IS BEGGING FOR SOMEBODY TO

45
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:28,977
LISTEN TO HER BUT THE DEMOCRATI

46
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:29,678
DEMOCRATIC'S AND THE COMPLETE

47
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:31,380
HYPOCRISY THAT THEY ARE NOT

48
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,548
LISTENING.

49
00:01:32,548 --> 00:01:34,183
>> Tucker: HAVE NO IDEA IF THE

50
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:35,150
ALLEGATIONS ARE CORRECT OR NOT.

51
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,819
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

52
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:37,720
I WOULD WITHHOLD JUDGMENT

53
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,254
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT

54
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:40,155
PEOPLE WOULD DO.

55
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,925
I AM SURPRISED BY THE REACTION,

56
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:44,993
HAS THE PRESS IN MINNESOTA, THE

57
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:46,662
PAPER AT MINNEAPOLIS BUT HOW DO

58
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:47,763
KEITH ELLISON TO EXPLAIN WHAT

59
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:50,933
EXACTLY THIS IS ABOUT?

60
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,534
>> NO ABSOLUTELY NOT.

61
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:54,503
IT IS DEAD SILENT AMONG THE

62
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:55,604
MEDIA AND THE DEMOCRATS AND

63
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:56,572
MINNESOTA.

64
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:58,507
ALL WE HEAR ABOUT IS BRETT

65
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,142
KAVANAUGH AND HOW WE SHOULD HAVE

66
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:02,745
A FULL FBI INVESTIGATION.

67
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:03,779
THE MEDIA IS QUITE IN MY

68
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:06,014
OPPONENT TINA SMITH IS OUT THERE

69
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,916
FULLY CAMPAIGNING AND SUPPORTING

70
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,051
KEITH ELLISON AND NOBODY, NOBODY

71
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,354
IS BRINGING THESE ACCUSATIONS OR

72
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:13,789
CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION.

73
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:14,757
I DID.

74
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,125
I CALLED AND THE

75
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:16,959
ATTORNEY GENERAL MINNESOTA TO DO

76
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,660
A FULL INVESTIGATION OF KEITH

77
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,528
ELLISON BECAUSE THE VOTERS OF

78
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:20,696
MINNESOTA, THEY WANT TO KNOW

79
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,765
BEFORE THEY VOTE TO THE POLLS.

80
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:23,332
WHO IS KEITH ELLISON?

81
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:24,967
HAS HE REALLY DONE THESE THINGS

82
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,935
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND?

83
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,037
>> Tucker: I CAN KEEP UP WITH

84
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:28,771
WHAT THE RULES ARE BECAUSE THEY

85
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,740
CHANGE SO OFTEN.

86
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,142
QUICKLY, AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO

87
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:33,676
BELIEVE THE WOMAN?

88
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:37,346
I KEEP HEARING THAT.

89
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:39,849
>> SEXUAL-HARASSMENT ABUSE,

90
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:42,418
DOMESTIC ABUSE, DOES ALL WRONG.

91
00:02:42,418 --> 00:02:45,354
EVERY ACCUSER SHOULD BE HEARD.

92
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,122
AGAINST KEITH ELLISON, THESE ARE

93
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:50,159
SOME SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS.

94
00:02:50,159 --> 00:00:00,000
NOBODY IS LISTENING.
