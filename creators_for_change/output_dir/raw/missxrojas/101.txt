31
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,470
started to comprehend until I started

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,510
seeing them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they are and</font>

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,119
looking at them in the eye<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use apps</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in I am on Twitter and elsewhere and</font>

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,080
just like in the news and about

situations of sexual assault and that

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,950

wasn't Lee heard the stories of sexual

42
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,020
assault and harassment that happened in

43
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,900
like unlicensed minicabs but also in

44
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,360
some black cabs and just other really

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,950
horrible experiences that my friend

46
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,110
shared and that I'd heard of in the news

47
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,430
and things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I knew that it</font>

48
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,040
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably happening in uber and in</font>

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,290
lift but I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing it as much so I</font>

50
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,030
has like this long<font color="#E5E5E5"> run of generally good</font>

51
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,070
experiences like the odd experience that

52
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,200
was like slightly off but I felt fine

53
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,329
and my trips here are very short<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

54
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,159
the time and I some good the airport

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,110
there like eight minutes six minute trip

56
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,659
so like no big no big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took over</font>

57
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,520
like every other

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,429
day at the very least I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but a</font>

59
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,340
lot so I just had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this run of really bad</font>

60
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,010
experiences I had drivers asking for my

61
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,440
number bizarre things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that made me feel</font>

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,720
really uncomfortable and like bring

63
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,840
politics into it but in a really

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
threatening way but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also tied</font>

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,870
into this weird like give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> your number</font>

66
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're also in a locked car I can't do</font>

67
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,980
anything since then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people told me about</font>

68
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,290
apps like burner where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can give a</font>

69
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,390
phone number and if they call it which

70
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,430
they always do after you give them a

71
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,620
number which is infuriating then it will

72
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,630
ring all these things happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even</font>

73
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,040
though I got refunded from those trips I

74
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,650
was feeling really like I didn't feel

75
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that safe there's no didn't feel that</font>

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,099
safe and uber and all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

77
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,410
getting really frustrated so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jews lift</font>

78
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,569
once or twice before mainly in LA I

79
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,700
hadn't used it as much here because

80
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,799
every time I requested it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

81
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,660
initially there was a long wait for cars

82
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,599
but when I tried it today there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,150
bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cars around and the first</font>

84
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,430
driver I got was lovely he was a great

85
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,000
dry for a great car it was fine second

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,160
driver<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got was like my worst nightmare</font>

87
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,329
rolled into an experience it was

88
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,310
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go to see</font>

89
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,920
what she thought about it because it was

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,799
there was no physical harassment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

91
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,959
was sexual harassment I called up the

92
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">crisis line and I explained</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what had</font>

93
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,209
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the person the phone from</font>

94
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,579
lift and she was like oh no that sexual

95
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,200
harassment were what frustrates me is

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,639
that when I called her on the phone I

97
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,500
said yeah I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,359
would qualify a sexual harassment but

99
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,299
like why do we do that why do me oh it's

100
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,760
the the frustration of internalized

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,340
misogyny is that we tear down our own

102
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">voices and we tear down our own stories</font>

103
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,959
and I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happening time and time</font>

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,690
again and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do that to other women</font>

105
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,930
sharing their experiences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I</font>

106
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,069
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's the most painful</font>

107
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,769
thing even more than guys doing it

108
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:08,450
because when girls do it to each other

109
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">or to themselves it just shows how</font>

110
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,670
deeply ingrained it is so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had this</font>

111
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,050
and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten-minute lived</font>

112
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,940
right at most in which the driver talked

113
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,639
a lot about sex and particularly sex

114
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">with me and talked about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he had a</font>

115
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,360
gun and all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like</font>

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,830
batshit crazy but of course thing is

117
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,320
smiled and laughed and went on my merry

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,500
way and back in my head was Kalamazoo I

119
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,320
had Cashin story actually in my head<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,210
had the fact that she she is using her

121
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,850
voice she is telling people what

122
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened she is trying to put herself in</font>

123
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,470
a situation where she can produce things

124
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,700
and the law and the company she has

125
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,530
contract with and this one individual

126
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,940
they have decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that her like that her</font>

127
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,130
harm isn't real you know like that what

128
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,960
she's saying is in real I think about

129
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and that like is that's really</font>

130
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,540
upsetting to me I see people who I know

131
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be abuses saying like cashiers only</font>

132
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,220
one side of the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> people ask why we</font>

133
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,490
have these discussions and why sometimes

134
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,850
we might go too far unlike trial by

135
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter stuff and I sometimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foolish</font>

136
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,169
that camper might need judge too harshly

137
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:27,050
and too quickly and without any nuance

138
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,539
but you see these stories and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

139
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:30,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and you</font>

140
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close hat and time and</font>

141
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,320
time again and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no fucking</font>

142
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,210
wonder we have child by Twitter and try

143
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,840
out my tumblr and those conversations

144
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,880
because there is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that voice they're</font>

145
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,810
having those conversations and we're not

146
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,370
protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the things that are</font>

147
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,310
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect us it's horrifying</font>

148
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,289
it's horrifying the other story<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had in</font>

149
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:56,780
my head today was this woman Joyce canal

150
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,800
he was dragged out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hospital and taken</font>

151
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,340
to jail<font color="#E5E5E5"> over some unpaid fines and she</font>

152
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,250
wasn't given the intravenous fluids that

153
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,780
she was basically given and I don't

154
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,490
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was given water in the jail</font>

155
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,930
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember exactly the story i'll</font>

156
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,910
try and find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> any giveaway where she</font>

157
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,530
died<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thirst because of that when that</font>

158
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,720
of course is at an intersection of so

159
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,479
many different in justices at once that

160
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,530
it is and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting</font>

161
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">always wears protective</font>

162
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at places like flint or the</font>

163
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,249
towns in New Orleans<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still haven't</font>

164
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,990
been given a protection they're supposed

165
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,090
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about that in</font>

166
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,949
London<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are supposed to</font>

167
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,680
protect you instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of spending money</font>

168
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,249
and investing it in communities and

169
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:45,529
investing it in housing are investing in

170
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,240
garden bridges for a long time I

171
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't report when an uber driver said</font>

172
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:50,210
something that made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel really</font>

173
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,039
uncomfortable well partly because I

174
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,610
didn't want them to punish<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for it if</font>

175
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,610
that makes sense like I have this like

176
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,969
deep fear of retributive violence that

177
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,789
you'll put into a position where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

178
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:07,189
for whatever reason know that you were

179
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,340
the person who complained and or or like

180
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,870
they sometimes like they pick you up

181
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,270
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> area by your house so they know</font>

182
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,310
your address like it's not difficult for

183
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,110
my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to that place because</font>

184
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,719
there is such<font color="#E5E5E5"> a violence inherent in</font>

185
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,520
misogyny this guide today was like

186
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,379
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how this person he was</font>

187
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">married to is like a bitch and how ugly</font>

188
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:30,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">women are way better at sex and pretty</font>

189
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,270
women<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this whole</font>

190
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,550
sense of owing people something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

191
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,680
men's don't think owing men something

192
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,759
owing them sags and attention the whole

193
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,860
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> friend zone bullshit man I knew</font>

194
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,509
we've had this conversation time and

195
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,669
time again but it like it's so fucking

196
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:48,800
annoying and I hate that I even feel the

197
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,569
need to interject this but many of my

198
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,520
closest friends a man and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful man they're wonderful friends</font>

200
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,569
they're wonderful people whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in</font>

201
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,419
these situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's men having these</font>

202
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,099
conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not to say I</font>

203
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,379
think men should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> exterminated or</font>

204
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,029
anything like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

205
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,729
conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this that upset me the</font>

206
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,310
most are when women have internalized

207
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,889
misogyny the conversations that scare<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

208
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,409
the most are the ones with men

209
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:18,379
displaying that misogyny because it is

210
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,990
violent it is inherently violent it is

211
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,289
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman he was killed by a man</font>

212
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,009
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> she turned him down a bar that for</font>

213
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,250
me was a crystal clear explanation of

214
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,409
the problems that we're facing and

215
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,559
grappling with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,529
all concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not believing a victim of</font>

217
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,000
abuse assault rape I don't I don't get

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,779
it because you look at the statistics

219
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and statistically you're not backed up</font>

220
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,760
the thing is you'll claim me when you

221
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,130
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're probably lying isn't</font>

222
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,520
backed up by statistics like what

223
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">cutting some great things for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

224
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
he tweets that Bill Cosby is innocent

225
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,310
I'm like fuck that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuck that like I'm</font>

226
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,200
fucking done that's not a gay and you

227
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,580
see people doing these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

228
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh I don't know man i take i</font>

229
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,350
don't know i<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate the the sort of</font>

230
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,529
vulture culture that sees people as one

231
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,240
thing that I hate that we're not

232
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,950
protecting people who need protection

233
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,670
and not prosecuting people who should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

234
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,250
prosecuted and not addressing the

235
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,930
systemic misogyny in the way that we

236
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,089
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not treating it as real</font>

237
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:29,490
and making people's voices tiny making

238
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,620
women's voices tiny making the voices of

239
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,300
people from minority backgrounds tiny

240
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,029
just squashing people squashing them and

241
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:38,400
making them<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel really small really</font>

242
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,130
small but really visible and unable to

243
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">access this kind of invisibility that a</font>

244
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,300
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to access through</font>

245
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,120
just looking the way their local

246
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,560
identifying the way they identify and I

247
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,260
don't know why people sometimes think

248
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they say that I'm saying that</font>

249
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,520
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are in those positions</font>

250
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,070
a positive kind of invisibility where

251
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,540
they're not hyper visible where they're

252
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,970
not sexualized but they're not seen as

253
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,990
an intruder or a danger or a some

254
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,089
threatening thing when I say that I'm

255
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:13,980
not saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

256
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,560
experience sadness or problems or

257
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">insecurity or danger or tragedy or</font>

258
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,070
anything like that of course I'm not

259
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,750
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm also not saying that</font>

260
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,280
they're always separated from these

261
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,140
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm talking about by any</font>

262
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,040
means but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we</font>
