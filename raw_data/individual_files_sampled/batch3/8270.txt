LITTLE TIME, LELAND. GREG PALKOT, THANK YOU. WITH THAT, WE BRING IN GORDON CHANG, FOREIGN AFFAIRS CONSULTANT. NICE TO SEE YOU. WE GOT A TIDBIT THERE FROM PALKOT'S REPORTING THAT THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO DENUCLEARIZE ON THEIR OWN TIMETABLE. THEIR TIMETABLE, OUR TIMETABLE HAVE TO BE VASTLY DIFFERENT. CERTAINLY. WE WANT THE NORTH KOREANS TO DISMANTLE IMMEDIATELY. THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO DISMANTLE THEIR PROGRAM NEVER. SO YEAH, A DIFFERENCE IN TIMETABLE. IS THERE AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN HAVE A DEAL THAT WE COULD PROPOSE RIGHT HERE? WE COULD WRITE IT UP THAT THE NORTH KOREANS AND THE AMERICANS WOULD ACCEPT? IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE'S A PRETTY BIG CHASM THERE. THERE'S NO DEAL THAT BOTH SIDES WOULD ACCEPT. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF NOT OF WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS WANT. THIS IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DO TO USE AMERICAN POWER TO PUSH THE CHINESE AND RUSSIANS OUT OF THE WAY AND DO OTHER THINGS TO MAKE SURE THE NORTH KOREANS DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. IF THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY, THEY CAN'T LAUNCH MISSILES, DETONATE NUKES AND KIM JONG-UN CAN'T GIVE GETS TO SENIOR REGIME MEMBERS TO BUY LOYALTY. WHICH MEANS HE HAS TO GIVE UP HIS WEAPONS. SO BASICALLY IT'S UP TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO USE THE ELEMENTS OF AMERICAN POWER. WE KNOW THE KIM REGIME LIKES IMPORTS. YOU TALK ABOUT AMERICAN POWER. PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED THE NAVAL MIDSHIPMEN GRADUATING AT ANNAPOLIS. TAKE A LISTEN. WE'RE BUILDING THAT MODERN FLEET MANNED BY THE GREATEST SAILORS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WE'RE SHARPENING THE FIGHTING EDGE OF EVERYTHING FROM MARINE INFANTRY SQUADS TO COMBAT SHIPS TO DELIVER MAXIMUM LETHAL FORCE. THE ENEMY HAS TO KNOW WE HAVE THAT. WE KNOW THAT KIM JONG-UN WATCHES AMERICAN NEWS. HE HEARS THAT. WHAT DOES HE MAKE OF IT? CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THREATS THE AMERICANS HAVE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. IT'S ALSO JOHN BOLTON, WHEN HE WAS A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS FORCED THE NORTH KOREANS TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES BUT THE SOUTH KOREANS AND THE CHINESE. THAT'S WHY KIM IS THERE RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT ONLY THE SANCTIONS BUT THE THREAT OF THE USE OF FORCE. GO BACK TO WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO USE COERCIVE U.S. POWER TO NOT ONLY AFFECT NORTH KOREA BUT AFFECT THE CHINESE. THINGS LIKE BLACK LISTING THE BANK OF CHINA. DO YOU GET THE SENSE THERE'S THE POLITICAL WILL IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT? NOT AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. KIM SEEMS TO KNOW THAT AT SOME LEVEL, RIGHT? OR THINKS IT? I THINK THAT HE SORT OF LOOKED AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH ZTE. ZTE IS THAT EMBATTLED CHINESE TELECOM EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER. THE CHINESE SAID PUBLICLY, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A TRADE DEAL, MR. TRUMP, UNLESS YOU GIVE US SANCTION RELIEF ON ZTE. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL DO THAT. TRUMP WILTED UNDER PRESSURE THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN'T PUSH THE CHINESE AROUND AGAIN. OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO THAT AS A DEMONSTRATION FOR KIM. ONCE HE SEES THAT TRUMP IS WILLING TO BULLY THE CHINESE A LITTLE BIT, THEN I THINK KIM WILL ACTUALLY START TO PLAY BALL WITH US. UNTIL WE TO THAT, THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT. IF YOU'RE KIM JONG-UN, YOU SEE HIM BULLY THE CHINESE, IT'S EASIER TO BE BULLIED AS THE NORTH KOREANS HAS THE CHINESE.
