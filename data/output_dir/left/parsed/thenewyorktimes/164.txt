If you switched on the
television in the U.S. this week,
you’ve seen a lot of this:
“... the world watching
that high-stakes summit”
“... we’re continuing our
breaking coverage ahead
of President Trump and Kim
Jong-un’s high-stakes summit ...”
“... an unprecedented
nuclear summit with
North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un ...”
But meanwhile, viewers
in North Korea
saw a lot of this.
“The Sunday broadcast
was much the same
as every Sunday.
So, documentaries about the
life of one of the Kims,
revolutionary movies —
one of the programs
this Sunday was about
evils of tobacco.
And there were
children’s shows as well.”
“Normally North Koreans don’t
see anything in real time
about any foreign excursion
by the supreme leader.
There’s normally nothing
until after he has come back
to the country.”
In a country
built on controlling
the flow of information,
the state-run media
apparatus holds all the power.
“By not reporting on
things beforehand,
the North Korean government
a) doesn’t build expectations
and b) gets to decide
that whatever happens,
it was a success.”
But on Monday morning,
North Korean state media
did something unheard of.
“We saw an unprecedented
amount of North Korean media
activity about Kim Jong-un’s
visits in Singapore.
All of it was
reported in real time.
And in fact, the anchor,
a woman named Ri Chun-hee,
a very famous anchor in North
Korea, used the name
Donald Trump —
and used the
the honorific form in Korean
to describe President Trump.
So this is unprecedented.”
This giant departure
from tradition
is part of a bigger
seismic shift.
Since Kim’s conciliatory
New Year’s speech,
North Korea’s
propaganda machine
has toned down its
anti-American messaging.
Broadcasts like
this one,
have become less frequent.
And so have North Korean
propaganda leaflets
like these dropped
over South Korea.
They had been depicting
Donald Trump and U.S. allies
in a hostile light.
But early this
year, the leaflets
suddenly started taking a
much less aggressive tone.
“A lot of messages about
reconciliation, unification,
peace, et cetera, and there
was even a Olympic-themed one
which showed the
Olympic mascots,
and they genuinely look like
they could have been
from South Korea.”
And in April,
when both Koreas agreed
to cease all propaganda initiatives,
the fliers stopped altogether.
But time will tell
whether a
friendlier tone in
North Korea’s propaganda
will translate into a
shift in Kim’s policies.
“North Korea likes
very big gestures
and having a meeting with
the president of the United States —
that means a lot.
And that can provide
a certain momentum
internally in North Korea to
get some tangible steps going
in terms of denuclearization.”
