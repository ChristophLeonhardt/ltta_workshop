♪ ♪ President Trump: YOU DON'T HAND MATCHES TO AN ARSONIST AND YOU DON'T GIVE POWER TO AN ANGRY LEFT-WING MOB, AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME. THEY WOULD TURN OUR COUNTRY SO FAST INTO VENEZUELA, AND VENEZUELA IS NOT DOING TOO WELL, FOLKS. IT'S TIME FOR US AS DEMOCRATS TO BE AS TOUGH AS THEY ARE, AND, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO LOW. NO, WHEN WE GO LOW WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK THEM. IN RESPONSE TO THAT STATEMENT, COLORADO SENATOR CORY GARDNER JUST PUT OUT A TWEET THAT SAYS, YOU HAVE OTHER PARTY REDRESSING MICHELLE OBAMA WAS WRONG, SHE SAID WHEN WE GO AFTER THE CAVANAGH VOTE. IN THE MEANTIME THE PRESIDENT IS CAMPAIGNING IN PENNSYLVANIA, TWEETING OUT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FROM ERIE, PENNSYLVANIA, I CANNOT DISAPPOINT THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING EVERYONE THIS EVENING. EVEN AS HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE HURRICANE. ANDY McCARTHY, FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY AND COUNTRY BIDDING EDITOR AT NATIONAL RADIO. BYRON, LET ME START WITH YOU. THE POLITICS AND PROTEST, MOBS AND ANGER, HOW IS THIS ALL PLAYING? REPUBLICANS ARE EXTREMELY ON MESSAGE NOW. AND THEY ARE DANGEROUS. IT'S TOO MUCH OF A CHANCE AND THEY ARE AN ANGRY MOB. THEY WILL TAKE AWAY YOUR MEDICARE, THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING CAMPAIGN THAT THEY HAVE CENTERED ON. TALKING TO REPUBLICANS AND WORKING TO KEEP THE HOUSE, THEY HAVE HAD THE BEST WEEK OR SO PULLING THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN QUITE A WHILE. THEY ATTRIBUTED MOST OF IT TO THE CAVANAGH EFFECT BUT ALSO SOME OF IT TO THE TRADE VICTORY, THEY FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT FACE DOWN IN CANADA AND ONE. SO THEY ARE STILL SCARED, THEY ARE VERY SCARED BUT THEY FEELING BETTER. FROM THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC, USUALLY DEMOCRATS ARE GOOD AT THAT. EVERY DAY IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT FITS INTO THIS NARRATIVE THAT THE G.O.P. HAS CREATED. ERIC HOLDER, YOU HAVE THE CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, ALL OF THAT. EVERY TIME ONE DEMOCRAT SAYS, THIS IS A BIG DEBATE GOING ON INSIDE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SHOULD THEY BE MICHAEL AVENATTI DEMOCRATS? SHOULD THEY BE THE LEFT-WING EQUIVALENT OF DONALD TRUMP AND FIGHT BACK LIKE HE DOES OR SHOULD THEY STAND FOR SOMETHING AS MICHELLE OBAMA WOULD SAY, HIGHER? THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH DIRECTION THEY WANT TO GO. ESPECIALLY IN THE ACTIVIST BASE. AND IF THIS THEY WIN, IT WILL BE AN EVEN TOUGHER DEBATE. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING MORE THEN, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT ON TUESDAY NIGHT FOR WEEKS FROM NOW. THIS IS NOT A GENIE THAT GETS EASILY PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE, IT IS THE EERIE FEELING OF THE 1960s OR 1970s RADICALISM. WE ARE JUST GETTING IT TO THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE CONTAINED IN FOUR WEEKS. WE ARE COVERING THE MIDTERMS FOR THE NEXT 47 DAYS. I ASKED ALL THE PANELS TO CHOOSE A RACE THAT THEY THINK IS INTERESTING FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER. I LOOKED AT THE ARIZONA RACE BECAUSE SUDDENLY, IT'S MORE PERSONAL TO ME. THIS IS KYRSTEN SINEMA THE DEMOCRAT MURK VERSUS MICK SALLY THE REPUBLICAN? YES. THE NEWS THAT CAME OUT TODAY WAS THAT SHE HOSTED LYNN STEWART WHO WAS MY ADVERSARY AND THE BLIND SHAKE PROSECUTION IN THE 1990s, RISING OUT OF THE BOMBING OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. TURNS OUT THAT LYNN WAS LATER ON TRIAL HERSELF OR MATERIAL SUPPORT TO TERRORISM FOR COMMUNICATING MESSAGES FROM THE BLIND SHAKE, WHERE HE WAS IN JAIL, TO HIS EGYPTIAN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. THEY TURNS OUT THAT SHE EVIDENTLY PROMOTED TWO OF HER APPEARANCES AT UNIVERSITY IN ARIZONA. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS. YOUR RACE? TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT AMONG DEMOCRATS. O'ROURKE GETS CROWDS OF LIKE 50,000 AND NOBODY THAT I'VE TALKED TO ACTUALLY THINKS THAT HE'S GOING TO WIN IT, BUT THE THING IS, HE'S KIND OF PLOWING THE FIELDS OR FERTILIZING THE FIELDS IN TEXAS FOR WHAT DEMOCRATS HOPE WILL BE EVENTUALLY THAT STATE TURNING PURPLE. THEY'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN THE PAST BUT THIS TIME THEY THINK THEY WILL MAKE INROADS. I PICKED THE MONTANA SENATE RACE, THE INCUMBENT IS THE SENATE, AND I THINK IT'S THE BEST CHANCE FOR A REPUBLICAN PICKUP THAT IS NOT GETTING VERY MUCH ATTENTION. THE POLLS ARE VERY, VERY CLOSE AND REPUBLICANS ARE WAITING FOR ASP 15 EFFECT. WE BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE PLACE AND EARLY VOTING STARTS NEXT WEEK IN MONTANA. SO IF THERE IS ANOTHER CAVANAUGH EFFECT AND WHEN IT'S STRONGEST,
