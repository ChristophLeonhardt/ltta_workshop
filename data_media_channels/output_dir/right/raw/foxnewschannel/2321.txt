1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,631
ELIZABETH: THAT'S RIGHT, OF

2
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:01,998
COURSE.

3
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:03,366
THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.

4
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:06,302
HERE TO WEIGH IN, FOX NEWS

5
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:07,970
NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,573
POLICY ANALYST WALID PHARES.

7
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,308
YOU'VE HEARD GREG PALKOT SAY

8
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:13,976
THAT THIS HAS GONE WRONG IN THE

9
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:14,310
PAST.

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,745
MY FIRST QUESTION, WHAT EXACTLY

11
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:17,513
DOES HE WANT, AND I'M SPEAKING

12
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,949
OF KIM JONG-UN AND ALSO, AS

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,584
THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE, IF

14
00:00:21,584 --> 00:00:23,185
THEY CONTINUE, HOW CAN WE SORT

15
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,520
OF DECIPHER PROGRESS?

16
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,888
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

17
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,623
THAT'S THE QUESTION OF THE DAY.

18
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:30,593
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, OR

19
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:31,761
DICTATOR, WANTS BASICALLY TO

20
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,496
PROTECT HIS REGIME, AND HE'S

21
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:35,164
MEASURING HOW MUCH HE'S GOING TO

22
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:36,432
BE PAYING FOR THIS.

23
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,467
STOPPING THE MISSILE TEST, HE

24
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:39,936
COULD DO THAT.

25
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,404
MAYBE START TO REDIRECT THE

26
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:43,539
PROGRAM, HE COULD DO THAT.

27
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,577
THE THING, HIS RED LINE, WOULD

28
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:49,645
BE DO NOT TOUCH MY REGIME, IT'S

29
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,247
A ONE-PARTY REGIME AND THAT'S

30
00:00:51,247 --> 00:00:52,682
THE CHALLENGE, THERE COULD BE

31
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:54,383
CHANGES ON THE GROUND.

32
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:55,384
NORTH KOREANS COULD BE GIVEN

33
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:56,953
POSSIBILITIES AND THAT COULD BE

34
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:58,621
A RISK FOR HIM.

35
00:00:58,621 --> 00:00:59,789
ELIZABETH: THERE WAS ONE

36
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,891
STATEMENT PUT OUT THIS MORNING,

37
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,492
NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE, PENINSULA, IF

38
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:04,393
YOU WILL.

39
00:01:04,393 --> 00:01:06,062
MY QUESTION TO YOU WOULD MEAN

40
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:07,063
THAT WOULD PROBABLY INCLUDE

41
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:09,031
PROBABLY THE 28,000 TROOPS IN

42
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:10,333
SOUTH KOREA TO LEAVE AND THAT'S

43
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,567
PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN?

44
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,470
>> IT COULD, BUT, YES, AT THIS

45
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,504
POINT IN TIME THE 20,000 TROOPS

46
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,506
ARE BASICALLY FACING THE

47
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,275
MILITARY TROOPS TO THE NORTH.

48
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,243
SO, IT'S REALLY THE TASK FORCES

49
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,745
THAT WE HAVE IN THE OCEAN,

50
00:01:22,745 --> 00:01:23,379
VERSUS THE MISSILES.

51
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,747
SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A

52
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:27,149
BALANCE OF POWER, IF HE DISARMS

53
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:30,486
HIS MISSILES THEN WE COULD

54
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:31,921
REDEPLOY:

55
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,556
IF HE WOULD LISTEN HIS MILITARY

56
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:36,192
IN THE NORTH, WE COULD REDEPLOY.

57
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:37,526
THE MAJOR QUESTION THAT I HAVE

58
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,828
HERE, HOW DO WE MEASURE THAT

59
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,563
HE'S GOING TO THAT DIRECTION.

60
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:41,831
WE HAVE THE MILITARY MONITORING,

61
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,265
OF COURSE, AND SURVEILLANCE,

62
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,567
VERY STRICT, BUT ALSO THE MOST

63
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,236
IMPORTANT FACTOR, WILL HE ALLOW

64
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:50,072
HIS CITIZENS TO VISIT THE SOUTH?

65
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:52,174
THAT WILL BE A MAINLY GAME

66
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:52,508
CHANGER.

67
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:53,643
ELIZABETH: I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

68
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:53,976
THAT.

69
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,711
I'M SORT OF CURIOUS ON WHO HAS

70
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,779
THE UPPER HAND GOING INTO THE

71
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,781
MEETINGS AND AS WE GO INTO THE

72
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,017
MEETINGS, WOULD HE SORT OF TREAD

73
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,318
LIGHTLY AND MAYBE NOT ASK FOR

74
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:04,387
SANCTIONS TO BE RELEASED

75
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:05,087
IMMEDIATELY?

76
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:06,355
WOULD HE START SORT OF LOWERING

77
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:08,157
THE BAR, IF YOU WILL?

78
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,091
>> NORMALLY HE WILL ASK FOR

79
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,526
EVERYTHING HE WANTS TO ASK FOR

80
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,696
AND THEN, OF COURSE--

81
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:15,364
>> HE READ ART OF THE DEAL,

82
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:15,665
MAYBE.

83
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,166
>> YES, MAYBE TRANSLATED TO HIM,

84
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,968
BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO CHINA

85
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:19,635
BEHIND HIM.

86
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:21,303
HE HAS BEEN PREPPED BY THE CHINA

87
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,438
DURING HIS VISITS SO THEY WILL

88
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:23,806
BE BASICALLY DOING THE LARGER

89
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,174
NEGOTIATION WITH US, WITH THE

90
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,309
UNITED STATES, AND HE WILL BE

91
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:28,778
PART OF THAT NEGOTIATION,

92
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:29,145
BASICALLY.

93
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,279
>> BEFORE YOU GO, I DO WANT TO

94
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,947
SHIFT TO SORT OF A LARGER

95
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,282
FOREIGN POLICY OUTLOOK.

96
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:34,250
OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS A BIG WEEK

97
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,951
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE, WE SAW THE

98
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,120
FRENCH PRESIDENT, SAW THE GERMAN

99
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,554
CHANCELLOR.

100
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:39,588
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE AWAY THIS WEEK

101
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:41,657
ON WHERE WE STAND IN THE WORLD?

102
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:44,694
>> WELL, BASICALLY THE TWO

103
00:02:44,694 --> 00:02:46,462
EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE HERE FOR

104
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:49,732
ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE, THE IRAN

105
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:50,099
DEAL.

106
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,167
THEY FEEL THAT THE PRESIDENT AND

107
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,635
HIS ADMINISTRATION ARE HEADING

108
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:55,037
TOWARDS WITHDRAWING FROM THE

109
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:55,371
DEAL.

110
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,506
THEY FEEL THERE'S A MAJORITY IN

111
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:58,441
CONGRESS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC

112
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,576
WHO DO NOT TRUST THE DEAL.

113
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:03,412
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO,

114
00:03:03,412 --> 00:03:04,613
CONVINCE THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, WE

115
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:06,248
HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU, WE

116
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,717
HAVE ANOTHER DEAL, BUT DO NOT

117
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:09,318
LET GO OF THE DEAL BEFORE HAVING

118
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:10,186
THE ALTERNATIVE.

119
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:11,220
AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S

120
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,289
POSITION IS, FIRST I'LL WITHDRAW

121
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,758
FROM THE DEAL, BUT I'M READY TO

122
00:03:15,758 --> 00:03:17,426
RENEGOTIATE SO IT PUTS PRESSURE

123
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:18,160
ON HIM AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

124
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,028
ELIZABETH: HE'S MAKING THAT

125
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:19,962
DECISION ON MAY 12TH.

126
00:03:19,962 --> 00:00:00,000
>> HE'S MAKING THE DECISION ON
