1
00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:02,063
PRESIDENT'S DESK WHERE HE'S

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:06,067
EXPECTED TO SIGN IT INTO LAW.

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,836
MEANWHILE -- AINSLEY: DEMOCRATS

4
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,937
TAKING A CUE FROM THE

5
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,439
PRESIDENT'S PLAY BOOK IN

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,607
DRAMATIC SHIFT TO THEIR OWN

7
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:14,275
MESSAGE.

8
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,510
>> THE SWAMP HAS NEVER BEEN MORE

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:19,280
FOUL OR MORE FETED THAN UNDER

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,414
THIS PRESIDENT.

11
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:21,882
>> INSTEAD OF DELIVERING ON HIS

12
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:24,452
PROMISE TO DRAIN THE SWAMP,

13
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:27,788
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME THE

14
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,056
SWAMP.

15
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:33,661
BRIAN: BUT WILL THIS WORK?

16
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,631
TOMMY LARREN, THEY DID THE

17
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,566
STATS, ARE THE DEMOCRATS DOING

18
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,101
THE RIGHT THING BY JUST TAKING

19
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:42,937
HIS LINE?

20
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,071
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T

21
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:45,439
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING BEHIND

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,141
THAT LINE BECAUSE DRAIN THE

23
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:50,177
SWAMP IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THEY

24
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,412
BELIEVE, IT'S ABOUT IMPEACHING

25
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,148
THIS PRESIDENT OR ATTACKING THIS

26
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,850
PRESIDENT, DISPARAGING THIS

27
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,318
PRESIDENT AND SUPPORTERS, THAT'S

28
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,886
NOT WHAT DRAIN THE SWAMP MEANS.

29
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:00,421
CUTTING TAXES FOR THE AMERICAN

30
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,956
PEOPLE, PUTTING AMERICANS FIRST,

31
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,791
IT MEANS PROTECTING AND SECURING

32
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,426
THE BORDER AND THEY'RE NOT ABOUT

33
00:01:05,426 --> 00:01:07,128
ANY OF THOSE THINGS WHICH IS WHY

34
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:08,229
I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE HURTING

35
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,531
IN MIDTERMS AND HURTING IN 2020

36
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,199
YET AGAIN.

37
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:13,768
STEVE: TOMMY, WHEN YOU LOOK,

38
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:15,803
EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT TRIES

39
00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:19,640
TO DO SOMETHING, SWAMP-DRAINISH

40
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,275
HE BANGS HIS HEAD ON WASHINGTON,

41
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:21,542
D.C.

42
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,210
IT'S BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO GET

43
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,281
ANYTHING DONE.

44
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:28,115
>> PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

45
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:29,483
THAT THE SWAMP EXISTS IN THE

46
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:31,352
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND FRUSTRATING

47
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:32,953
FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT THIS

48
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:34,688
PRESIDENT AND WHAT HE'S DOING TO

49
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,056
REACH OBSTRUCTION IN OUR OWN

50
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:36,357
PARTY.

51
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,459
DRAIN THE SWAMP ISN'T ABOUT

52
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,593
DRAINING THE DEMOCRATS, DRAINING

53
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,029
THOSE IN OUR OWN PARTY WHO HAVE

54
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:42,797
FORGOTTEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

55
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:43,864
REALLY WHAT DRAIN THE SWAMP

56
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:47,067
MEANS IS TO BRING BACK TO DC THE

57
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,769
REAL VOICE AND THE INTENTIONS TO

58
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,205
HAVE SILENT MAJORITY AND NANCY

59
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,007
PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER, THEY

60
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,342
DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT,

61
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:57,178
THEIR ENTIRE AGENDA IS TO RAISE

62
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:59,013
TAX, SHIELD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS,

63
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,015
CHIP AWAY AT SECOND AMENDMENT

64
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:03,450
RIGHTS AND IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT

65
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,552
OR DISPARAGE THE PRESIDENT.

66
00:02:04,552 --> 00:02:06,053
THAT WON'T BE WINNING FOR

67
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,087
AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE PRESIDENT

68
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,354
TRUMP IS DOING INTERNATIONALLY

69
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:09,455
AND DOMESTICALLY.

70
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,258
AINSLEY: IT'S IRONIC THAT IT'S

71
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,060
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER,

72
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,128
THEY ARE THE SWAMP THAT THE

73
00:02:14,128 --> 00:02:15,729
PRESIDENT RAN ON DRAINING.

74
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,832
LOOKS LIKE, IT OF COURSE WORKED

75
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,200
FOR THIS PRESIDENT, HE GOT

76
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,267
ELECTED ON THAT MESSAGE AND

77
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,468
LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS ARE

78
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:22,870
STEALING IT AND MAYBE THEY ARE

79
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,104
TRYING TO WIN AND THEY ARE

80
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,172
GETTING DESPERATE BECAUSE IF YOU

81
00:02:25,172 --> 00:02:28,409
LOOK AT RECENT POLL, REUTERS

82
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,978
POLL, REPUBLICANS HOLD SLIM LEAD

83
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,346
IN GENERIC BALLOT.

84
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,815
THEY ASKED PEOPLE WHO THEY WERE

85
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,418
POLLING, WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR

86
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,854
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT, LOOK AT

87
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,255
THAT, 38% SAID THEY WOULD VOTE

88
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:43,924
FOR REPUBLICAN AND 36.7 WOULD

89
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:46,060
VOTE FOR DEMOCRAT.

90
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,794
>> WELL, OF COURSE, BECAUSE AT

91
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:47,962
THE END OF THE DAY I BELIEVE

92
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,363
THAT AMERICAN VOTERS ON BOTH

93
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,031
SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE GOING TO

94
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,032
VOTE WITH POCKETBOOKS AND THE

95
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,334
TRUTH IS THIS PRESIDENT IS

96
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:54,535
WINNING FOR AMERICAN PEOPLE.

97
00:02:54,535 --> 00:02:56,070
YOU LOOK AT THE TAX CUTS, YOU

98
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,905
LOOK AT WHAT THAT HAS DONE FOR

99
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,973
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN.

100
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,876
I KNOW NANCY PELOSI THINKS IT'S

101
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,410
JUST CRUMBS, TO AVERAGE

102
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,012
AMERICANS IT REALLY MEANS

103
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:05,379
SOMETHING.

104
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:06,513
LOOKING AT THE PRESIDENT THAT'S

105
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:07,214
DOING GREAT THINGS

106
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:09,016
INTERNATIONALLY BUT ALSO MOST

107
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:09,884
IMPORTANTLY DOMESTICALLY, I ALSO

108
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:10,684
THINK THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOING

109
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,119
TO BE A HUGE PART OF THIS

110
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,754
BECAUSE AS WE ARE SEEING, AS WE

111
00:03:13,754 --> 00:03:15,489
TALK ABOUT EVERY WEEK, EVEN IN

112
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:16,590
PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA, THE

113
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,225
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH

114
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,927
THE DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE FED

115
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,296
UP WITH THEIR AGENDA OR THERE

116
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,898
LACK THEREOF AND READY FOR WHAT

117
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:25,199
THE PRESIDENT IS BRINGING TO THE

118
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,799
TABLE.

119
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,735
STEVE: TOMMY, WHEN YOU ARE ON

120
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,136
YOUR PROGRAM AND ON THIS

121
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,504
PROGRAM, YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND BUT

122
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:32,706
SOMETIMES YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC

123
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:34,041
AND WEIRD THINGS HAPPEN.

124
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,843
I KNOW OVER THE WEEKEND YOU WERE

125
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,011
IN MINNEAPOLIS, I THINK YOU WERE

126
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:41,015
WITH YOUR MOM, WHAT WENT

127
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:42,383
HAYWIRE?

128
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:43,384
>> WELL, I WAS ACTUALLY WITH

129
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,919
BOTH MY PARENTS AND WE WERE

130
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,120
ENJOYING BRUNCH AFTER I DID A

131
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,689
SHOW THE NIGHT BEFORE AND

132
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,657
UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS A GROUP

133
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,692
OF PEOPLE PROBABLY AROUND MY AGE

134
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,261
THAT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY

135
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,263
TO THROW WATER AT ME AND THEN

136
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:58,699
START CHANTING PROFANITY AND,

137
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,768
AGAIN, NOT SOMETHING THAT NOT

138
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:04,004
USED TO BUT REALLY

139
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:04,672
DISHEARTENING.

140
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:06,173
BRIAN: IN FRONT OF YOUR PARENTS?

141
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:07,775
AINSLEY: WAS THAT YOUR MOM IN

142
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:10,010
ONE OF THE VIDEOS THAT WAS

143
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,613
WALKING BEHIND YOU WHEN THE GIRL

144
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,648
THREW THE DRINK ON YOUR BACK?

145
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:18,118
>> THROWN AT ME AND GOT MY MOM

146
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:20,487
WET AS WELL.

147
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,490
THIS SOMETHING THAT WAS

148
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,391
EMBARRASSING, AT THE END OF THE

149
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,427
DAY I'M A PERSON TOO, BUT I'M

150
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,095
TOUGH, MY FAMILY IS TOUGH, WE

151
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:28,796
CAN HANDLE IT.

152
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:29,997
I THINK THAT THOSE THAT THREW

153
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:31,932
THE WATER AND WERE APPLAUDING

154
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,100
AND LAUGHING ABOUT IT WE WANTED

155
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,069
TO GET THEIR 15 MINUTES OF FAME

156
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:36,971
BY MAKING VIDEO OF ME.

157
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,172
LOOKING BACK, THOSE ARE THE

158
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,540
PEOPLE THAT WILL BE EMBA RASED

159
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,641
BY THE ACTION.

160
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,544
THEIR PARENTS RAISED THEM

161
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:44,745
BETTER, FURTHERMORE, YOU DON'T

162
00:04:44,745 --> 00:04:46,113
HAVE TO LIKE ME BUT YOU DON'T

163
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,948
HAVE THE RIGHT TO THROW THINGS

164
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:48,615
AT ME?

165
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:52,052
IS THAT THE POINT THAT YOU CAN'T

166
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,688
DISAGREE WITH SOMEBODY CIVILLY,

167
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,390
IT'S REALLY DISHEARTENING, I'M

168
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,791
TOUGH, I CAN HANDLE IT.

169
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,892
THERE ARE THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT

170
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:00,361
HAVE A THICK OF SKIN AND THAT'S

171
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:03,263
THE PEOPLE THAT I WORRY ABOUT.

172
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:06,767
STEVE: HERE IS THE THING, TOMI,

173
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,302
TWITTER, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

174
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,937
AT POLAR OPPOSITES TO YOU

175
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,005
POLITICALLY ARE SUPPORTING YOUR

176
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,439
RIGHT TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO

177
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:12,906
SAY.

178
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,376
AINSLEY: KATHY GRIFFIN IS ONE OF

179
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:15,976
THEM.

180
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:17,144
STEVE: ABSOLUTELY.

181
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,245
>> HEY, THAT'S THE SILVER LINING

182
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:19,480
IN THE WHOLE THING, THERE ARE

183
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,482
PEOPLE THAT NORMALLY DETEST ME

184
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,117
AND THEY'RE COMING TO MY DEFENSE

185
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,285
AT LEAST ON THIS INCIDENTS, SO

186
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:28,022
MAYBE MOVING FORWARD WHO THOUGHT

187
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:30,190
IT WAS FUN TO THROW PARTY, MAYBE
