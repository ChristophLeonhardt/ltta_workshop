He has ripped one doctor's
pocket off his shirt.
He's bit a couple of other people along the
way.
>>  I hear him now.
Oh my goodness.
He's mad.
>> 
People with intellectual disabilities have a
very
difficult time accessing good quality health
care.
>> It's not uncommon to hear a parent or
a guardian say the last time we went to a
dental office or a medical office,
we were told, get your son or your daughter
out of here and don't ever bring them back.
Our professions have turned their back on
them in many cases.
>> Well, recently, an ambulance refused to
transport him to
the hospital because of his autism.
He was transported to the hospital by a
police officer.
>> We have generations of physicians in
Venice who have been trained, and
that training didn't include taking care of
adults with developmental disabilities.
Lee Specialty Clinic, how can I help you?
>> All of our clinicians here have
exceptional expertise and
experience focused on this population.
>> You're ready for about a ride cookie,
dude?
>> Feels like we're forgetting something.
>> All yours.
>> Oh, change of pants just in case.
>> Due to Trey's autism, he's an odd little
fellow.
Trey was actually a joy until he hit puberty.
>> All right, Trey.
Let's go, buddy.
>> He became just extremely self-abusive.
He's going to go see his friends.
It kills me to have to restrain him and
it's amazing how many doctors, I have sat
there with the phone book and
literally called one after another to try to
get him into a certain specialist.
The answer I love the most is we are not
taking any
new Medicaid patients at this time when they
hear he's challenged.
It's been really hard to even find anyone to
take him,
much less the experience when you go into a
waiting room.
Everyone's staring and you know, why is he
like that?
>> Momma, Mom, Momma.
>> We have a term for that.
We call it Waiting Room Syndrome.
.
It's a syndrome that the doctors have.
It's the fear that the patient with the
disability is going to scare the other
clients or make the other patients
uncomfortable who are in that waiting room.
>> Additionally, it takes more time.
>> We're living in a time now when a doctor
may be in the room with you for
five minutes, if you're lucky, and you just
can't do that with this population.
What makes this facility different is we
offer medical care,
dental care, psychiatric, physical therapy,
occupational therapy,
speech therapy, all focused on people with
intellectual developmental disabilities.
>> When you have a child like this who can't
communicate and
has you know, complex issues, and has
challenging behaviors,
you can't go around to typical doctors
because they're not familiar with autism.
>> Danny also has SIB, or self injurious
behaviour,
where he hits himself and he's had a
cauliflower ear on this side.
He had surgeries last summer.
>> You can see the hair loss.
We, thankfully, got referred here and we
started addressing what all the physical or
dental problems could possibly be that might
contribute to this,
which we're still dealing with.
>> When you attribute a behavior to the
disability rather than looking for
an underlying cause, they'll start to
medicate the behavior.
In this population, often times there's an
underlying physical diagnosis that
is actually causing pain or discomfort and
because our patients sometimes have
limited verbal abilities, their method of
communicating to us is that behavior.
>> So this pain, anywhere?
>> He usually starts here first to give us
the signal.
Sometimes he can't decipher, he just knows he
hurts, so.
>> Sometimes people have dental pain, for
example, and the physical self-injurious
behavior might be the person actually doing
this, tapping on the part that hurts.
Funding is also a problem.
When a patient with an intellectual
disability reaches the age of 18
in the United States, they fall off a cliff.
A funding cliff.
Public assistance, medical assistance
services and programs just dry up.
>> In the past, when I've tried to do
anything else, punch a clock, so
to speak, it never works out because Trey
could be having a bad day,
so I've cleaned houses most of his 33 years.
The older he's gotten, the more frustrated
he's gotten.
Haven't been on vacation in at least 10
years.
It's hard for me to say, I would really like
to find placement for
him while I'm still young enough to oversee
it.
He's been on a waiting list at one facility
since he was 18 yearsold.
>> We solve the problem of healthcare here at
this clinic but for
the parents, healthcare's just one piece of
their life.
Everything that they do.
>> Is more complicated.
>> Mama, mama.
>> There's my boy.
>> Mama.
>> There's my boy.
