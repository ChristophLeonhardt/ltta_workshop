AN ALABAMA SHERIFF HAS BEEN
VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.
THIS WAS A SHERIFF WHO MADE
HEADLINES AFTER IT WAS
REPORTED THAT HE TOOK MONEY FROM
A PRISON FOOD FUND IN ORDER
TO FUND HIS OWN HOME.
BY THE WAY, HE HAD MULTIPLE
HOMES.
THIS IS TODD ENTREKIN.
A 
REPUBLICAN HAS REPLACED HIM
AND
IT DOESN'T APPEAR HAS ANY
CHALLENGERS.
THIS IS THE
PRIMARY ELECTION AND NO ONE
APPEARS TO BE CHALLENGING
JONATHAN HORTON BUT HE DID
CALL HIM OUT IN REGARD TO
STEALING THIS MONEY FROM THE
PRISON FOOD FUND.
BY THE WAY CREDIT TO THE LOCAL
COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS
REALLY DID RAISE SOME RED
FLAGS FOR THEM.
THEY NOTICED HE HAD MULTIPLE
HOMES AND THEY ARE LIKE YOU
ARE A SHERIFF, WHERE DID THIS
MONEY COME FROM?
GREAT JOB ON BREAKING THE
STORY OVERALL.
HE IS LIKE THE 750 I TOOK FROM
THERE, AND THE MONEY I
SPENT FOR MY HOME, TOTAL
COINCIDENCE.
HE HAD GIVEN A PRESS
CONFERENCE AFTER THE STORY
BROKE AND THE PRESS CONFERENCE
WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU THE
VIDEO TO REMIND YOU IF YOU
FORGOT OR HADN'T SEEN IT.
TAKE A LOOK.
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, ME,
MY FAMILY, MY OFFICE, THE
CITIZENS OF OUR COUNTY
HAVE BEEN TARGETS OF
MISCELLANEOUS FAKE NEWS STORIES.
THIS IS A JAIL.
THIS IS NOT A BED-AND-BREAKFAST.
IF YOU ARE USED TO EATING
GRANDMA'S FRIED CHICKEN AND
ORDERING PIZZA SEVERAL TIMES A
WEEK YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
BE HAPPY.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
IF IT IS WRONG, SOMEONE NEEDS TO
CHANGE THE LAW.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT ALL TO
CHARITY SO THERE IS NO QUESTION?
THIS IS LIKE ANYBODY WHO GETS
HERE AND WORKS EVERY DAY AND
IT IS AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF
YOU MAKE A PROFIT, IT IS YOURS.
BUT THIS IS PUBLIC SERVICE.
I ASKED TO BE THE SHERIFF AND
IT CAME WITH THAT JOB.
I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU
HAPPY.
THAT IS AMAZING.
HE JUST TALKED ABOUT MAKING A
PROFIT AS SHERIFF.
HE SAYS, FRIED CHICKEN, YOU KNOW
WITH THE FOOD WAS?
IT WAS LITERALLY LABELED NOT FIT
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.
HE IS LIKE THAT SOUNDS GOOD,
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE SOME
MONEY AND I'M GOING TO POCKET
MY PROFIT.
I AM GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE EAT
FOOD NOT FIT FOR HUMAN
CONSUMPTION.
HE SAYS I DIDN'T NECESSARILY
SPEND IT ON MY HOUSE OR OTHER
THINGS.
ON THE CHECK THAT WAS
FOUND, ONE OF THE ITEMS WAS FOR
A KID WHO WAS
MOWING HIS LAWN AND ON THE CHECK
WERE PRINTED THE WORDS SHERIFF
TODD ENTREKIN'S FOOD PROVISION
ACCOUNT.
THAT IS WHAT HE KEPT TAKING FROM
INSTEAD OF GIVING IT TO THE
PRISONERS.
I WAS CURIOUS WHY WE HAD TO
WAIT UNTIL HE GOT ELECTED
OUT OF OFFICE, RIGHT?
I THOUGHT SHOULDN'T HE BE
PROSECUTED FOR THIS?
IT TURNS OUT HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T
BREAK THE LAW.
THAT IS THE THING THAT SHOULD
UPSET EVERYONE AND THE LAWS
NEED TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE THIS
IS A LAW PROTECTING HIM NOT
ONLY IN ALABAMA BUT IN SEVERAL
OTHER STATES AS WELL.
ALABAMA HAS A DEPRESSION ERA
LAW THAT ALLOWS SHERIFFS TO
KEEP AND RETAIN UNSPENT MONEY
FROM FOOD PROVISION ACCOUNTS.
SHERIFFS ACROSS THE STATE TAKE
EXCESS MONEY AS PERSONAL INCOME
AND IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTFALL
ARE PERSONAL LIABLE FOR COVERING
THE GAPS.
WHAT HE DID WAS HE
TOOK THAT MONEY FOR HIMSELF AND
THEN GAVE THE PRISONERS FOOD BUT
THAT FOOD WAS NOT FIT FOR
HUMAN CONSUMPTION SO A CASE
COULD BE MADE THAT WHAT HE DID
WAS UNLAWFUL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THERE WAS A SHORTFALL
WHICH LED TO THE PRISONERS
EATING FOOD THAT WAS NOT
SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION BUT
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GO AFTER
HIM AND THESE LAWS NEED TO BE
WIPED OUT.
DEPRESSION ERA LAW SHOULD NOT BE
HERE ANYMORE.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE ORIGINAL
PRIVATE PRISONS, RIGHT?
IF YOU GIVE A SHERIFF AN
INCENTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE
DOES NOT TREAT HIS PRISONERS
DECENTLY AND HE CAN KEEP THE
PROFITS FROM THAT BAD TREATMENT,
THEN YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM
TO DO THAT TERRIBLE TREATMENT SO
HE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY AND
SO IT IS UNSURPRISING THAT YOU
HAVE THE SHERIFF DOING IT.
MAYBE HE IS DOING IT ON A HUGE
SCALE AND THAT IS WHY IT
STUCK OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB IN
THE MIDDLE OF ALABAMA, BUT
I BET YOU THIS IS ON THE BOOKS
IN A LOT OF THE STATES,
THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF
SHERIFFS ABUSING THEIR
DETAINEES SO THEY CAN MAKE
ABOUT.
THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT
THAT HIS INCOME SO IT IS
HARD TO TRACK HOW OFTEN AND HOW
MUCH THEY DO THIS.
IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE TO REPORT THAT
IS INCOME SO WE SHOULD BE
TRACKING THIS AND GETTING
ALL OF THESE LAWS OF THE BOOKS.
BY THE WAY, CREDITS OF THE
VOTERS AN ALABAMA DIET IS
NOT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN
ISSUE, THEY REPLACED HIM
WITH THE REPUBLICAN BUT THEY
SAID YOU HAVE TO GO, THIS
IS TERRIBLE CORRUPTION 
AND THEY
WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
