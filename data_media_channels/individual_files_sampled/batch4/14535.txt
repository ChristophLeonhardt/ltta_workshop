today is a bad day for Canada but it is particularly tragic and infuriating and dispiriting to Westerners let me explain why today Justin Trudeau killed a fifteen point seven billion dollar pipeline project called energy East that state-of-the-art pipeline would have taken more than a million barrels of oil every single day from Alberta and Saskatchewan to New Brunswick where if you can believe it Canada's largest oil refineries located in a new browser it's the Irving refinery that refinery actually imports oil from OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia so not only would this pipeline have been the largest shovel-ready infrastructure project construction project in Canada no government money needed thousands of new jobs in parts of Canada where they sure could use the work but it would have replaced OPEC conflict oil with Canadian ethical oil stop funding the terrorists and the Saudi princes and it would have brought Canadian oil to a port so we could possibly have exported oil to a customer other than the United States well that's dead now Trudeau killed it the mainstream media is reporting this as if the pipeline company TransCanada made the decision now they were still gung-ho until just a few weeks ago when Justin Trudeau changed the rules for energy East application you see all these headlines here they're blaming TransCanada as if it was a business decision no see Trudeau changed the rules since a few weeks ago saying that even if the pipeline was great by all standard measures even if it was safe it's no longer enough now energy East would have to answer for any global warming from any oil companies who might ship oil through the pipeline in the future and people who use oil from the pipeline in the future I'm serious that's not a thing by the way that's that's never been done that was made up just to kill the application and it worked that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
