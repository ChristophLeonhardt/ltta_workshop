thank for final thoughts and yes I will address the despicable display in Charlottesville this weekend yes it's time for final thoughts sponsored by Toyota where I will also be addressing these Charlottesville protests but unlike you Tommy I won't be using this as a way to launch yet another insane attack at the left but first tell us how much you hate your fan base do you think white supremacists still exist in 2017 is saddening maddening and disgusting I have no association with these people I don't know about that president Trump has no association with these people I definitely don't know about that and the millions of hard-working and kind-hearted Trump supporters around this country have nothing to do with these people if you want to see how these people will behave under the veil of anonymity you can look no further than the comments section of my Instagram page I've been getting death threats for the past two days in fact I've seen almost every single prominent conservative including our president come out and denounce this ugliness head-on okay first of all it took Donald Trump three full days before he came out to declare that racism is evil and since you made this video before Trump's press conference this morning and currently lack the capabilities of future seeing let's talk about Trump's first reaction to Nazis parading in the streets this egregious display of hatred bigotry and violence on many shots on many searched I'm sorry what hell no there isn't you have Nazis working side-by-side with Confederates and then you have the good guys on the other side too that's two sides isn't fucking Game of Thrones and by the way it's not like Trump is known for measured mild-tempered responses so his neutral tone in this instance was absolutely deliberate I mean look at some of the subjects Donald Trump has been harsher on than Nazis he called Mexicans rapists and thugs and murderers he called New Hampshire a drug-infested den he's called Rosie O'Donnell a pig I mean I'd look at right in that fat ugly face of hers I'd say Rosie you're fired he's called mainstream media an enemy of the American people he's even attacked Diet Coke he said no skinny person drinks it Donald Trump drinks Diet Coke but when it comes to white supremacist and Nazis who happen to be prominent vocal members of his voting bloc we get deflection the fucking tiki torch company has shown more integrity denouncing neo-nazis then Donald Trump has but what do you have to say about that Tommy and let me say this to all of you social media years out there you are broadcasting from your Honda Civic to Facebook newsflash Tommy you and I are both social media warriors although only one of us got fired from a TV network that was that was you we've gone out of your way to pin this on conservatives on Trump supporters on Republicans you should be ashamed of yourselves that kind of nonsense is uncalled for that guy nasus is a call for it I love this part I love this part because you made a career pinning bullshit on liberals you said black lives matter is the KKK and now that we're actually dealing with the KKK you're still using this as an opportunity attack the left what good you think you're doing especially when you use this violent racist attack that left 20 people wounded and killed Heather hair to go back and launch an attack on an tufa as if counter protesters were equally at fault you want to call it violence and hate and wildness and bigotry don't forget to include the so-called anti fascist on your list they're far from innocent in this so let's hear you call them out to that's like saying the KKK and civil rights activists were both at fault for lynchings in the Jim Crow South it's so disingenuous to on the one hand empower your Confederate fan base with your anti immigration anti BLM rhetoric and then briefly denounce Nazis only to follow it up with why won't the left denounced an tyfa is it fascists and anti-fascists are the same this is exactly why these assholes no longer feel that need to wear robes and hide their faces Tommy they feel emboldened by commentators like you providing them cover with terrifying false equivalencies let's hear you denounce the crap as well you literally just said I denounced Nazis for killing people and then asked why won't the left announce the people protesting Nazis for killing people your reaction videos basically Donald Trump's original bullshit non-response drawn out to its logical limits Tommy where are the Democrats after the violence at Berkeley in Portland and yeah Charlottesville after the dalm riots and Ferguson Baltimore bedrooms and st. Paul and then you've been a broad-brush over all the left-wing activism and equate it back to Nazis beating black people with baseball bats here's why that's incredibly intellectually dishonest even for you well first off because Nazis duh working side by side with Confederates there were armed militia patrolling the streets with Confederate flag and Nazi patches like they're doing an Isis style hostile takeover how is this the same can you imagine black people who can't protest without opposition even attempt to exercise their second Amendment rights while protesting like this you still shit on Colin Kaepernick for kneeling in his protest and now you direct your crosshairs of blame at liberals will you call out the violent left a fucking neo-nazi drove from Ohio to Charlottesville to kill people and successfully drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters like a goddamn terrorist so yeah let's call out the violent left when we have 18 Republican legislators who have introduced bills to make this act of terrorism legal this is why there aren't many size of this Tommy and it might seem like I'm attacking you but I'm actually asking you for help this is why we need people like you to issue condemnation without trying to lob back cheap shots against the left because you can't truly condemn Nazis and then claim that Charlottesville is no different from liberal protests I want you to understand that just like I understand that not all Trump supporters are Nazis and look talk of economic anxiety aside it is undeniable that race has played an important role for some and this administration is absolutely aware of that otherwise it wouldn't take three days of bipartisan verbal tomahawks launched at them before coming out with a real statement of condemnation this is why taking on white supremacy has to be a collaborative effort and I call upon you Tommy and other like-minded conservatives to have these difficult conversations with your friends and fans we always ask black people and Muslims to police their own communities and the time has now come for white people to do the same I'm a psalm piker please share this video with your friends if you want to condemn Nazis without attacking the left please don't forget to follow me on Instagram and a Sandeep Iker and on Twitter Tucson the Hun and this has been the breakdown you
