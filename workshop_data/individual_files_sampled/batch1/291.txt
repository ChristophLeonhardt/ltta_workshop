air strikes on Gaza by Israel rocket attacks by Palestinians the worst fighting between the size in four years a truce is in place but for Hollande and once triggered this latest escalation this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I am Hoshi Mahabharatha it's the most intense attack on Israel by Palestine armed groups is the 2014 war in Gaza and it could have sparked another war Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched a barrage of rockets into Israel on Tuesday wounding three soldiers it was in response to the deaths of Palestinians by Israeli military Israel then targeted dozens of facilities that belonged to Hamas and Islamic Jihad Egypt intervened and brokered a fragile truce and ceasefire but there's no guarantee how long that will last the flare up of fighting in Gaza follows weeks of unrest and the killing of at least 121 Palestinians in protests leading after the neck power catastrophe day when 70 years ago Palestinians were driven from their homes and the State of Israel was created this is what Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had to say difficult days have passed on the West Bank Jerusalem and especially on the Gaza Strip the Israeli occupation launched today a fierce aggression on the Gaza Strip with rockets and aircrafts this indicates that the occupation does not want peace however we want peace and we demand peace the Palestinian Islamic Jihad the pIJ is a fashion that opposes the existence of Israel it was founded in the late 70s by Palestinian students in Egypt who were inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood and later influenced by the Islamic Revolution in Iran the group's aim is to destroy Israel liberate Palestine and form an Islamic state within the pre 1948 borders Islamic Jihad does not take part in the Palestinian political process and has opposed these agreements like the Oslo agreements the pIJ concentrates on armed revolt his military wing the aughts brigades use suicide bombs against Israel during the Second Intifada of al-aqsa in 2000 the group which has its headquarters in Syria reportedly receives funds from Iran it is designated as a terrorist group by the US EU and the UK let's now go to our guests joining us in ASDA heimer abu sada is professor of political science at al-azhar university in jerusalem l Hannon Miller Palestinian politics researcher at the Forum for regional thinking and in Istanbul Middlebury a lecture at the Istanbul iodine University welcome to you all Mahima the recent truce between the Palestinian armed groups and the Israelis is this an isolated security arrangement or do you read more into it well that is a very important question up till this moment we don't really know a lot of details about what happened last night until this moment Israel has not admitted that there has been an agreement for a new ceasefire on what we know that firing between the Palestinians and the Israeli side ended last night at about 3:00 a.m. in the morning when a senior leader from Hamas dr. harrell hired a deputy leader of Hamas in Gaza admitted that there has been an understanding to respect the ceasefire which was brokered by Egypt in August of 2014 and put an end to the Israeli aggression against Gaza and that summer so it seems to me that we are not approaching and you ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian resistance groups but more of a new commitment from both parties to the old ceasefire understanding that we reached by the Egyptians about four years ago which basically put pressure on both sides to respect their commitments and to stop hostilities even though the term hostilities is not icy Palestinians but that that was the term of the ceasefire which was reached in 2014 that Israel must cease all of its hostilities toward the Palestinians and also the palace resistance groups must seize all of their fire rocket firing against Israeli thousand El Hannah and the the Hamas says there is a truce there's been an agreement towards a truce the Israelis still distance themselves from the notion of any agreement with Hamas why do you think is this this is the case I think Israel would like to leave its options open for any case of escalation we've seen kites being used to ignite fires burning 750 acres of fields outside of the Gaza Strip in Israeli communities so I think Israel wouldn't like to commit itself to bind itself to behavior and would like to leave its options open at the moment we have enjoyed for years of relative calm on the Gaza border and I think Israel would certainly like to return to that situation but for the time being probably Israel wouldn't like to obligate itself to a one-sided truce by Hamas I met we've seen this barrage of mortar and rocket fire by Hamas and jihad at the same time from hazzah is this a coordinated push by the armed groups in Gaza to move forward against the backdrop of the violence that we've seen in the hundred and twenty one people who were killed over the past few weeks well there is a kind of pressure Hashem on these two groups on the ground when the Palestinians are being killed for more than a two nine weeks now since the outset of these demonstrations peaceful protests on the border with Israel asking for the lift of the siege and alleviating the conditions the people are living under now there's real ease by continuing this kind of aggression and violence unilateral killing and committing a massacre against the people these militant groups will find themselves in out of options they only have to retaliate in order to try to maintain and sustain not the truce but the deterrence formula to keep the Israeli army away from going ahead with killing especially their militants and that is the new thing because a hundreds of people have been killed and wounded in the past few weeks not now because the Israelis are targeting their militants directly these two groups found themselves applies and forced to go ahead with a retaliatory step taking these kind of majors to tell them that this is a snowball and if you continue by your aggression this doesn't mean that we don't need it is a violation or a an escalation in terms of the you know the clashes the tit-for-tat operations but on the other hand we cannot just keep silent while you going on with the aggression okay course this is going to have dire ramifications on the people on the ground because in any scenario any war on the Gaza Strip will have catastrophic consequences on the people or the science okay primer I mean the Egyptians seem to have stepped in brokering this ceasefire are they likely to shape any future arrangements between the Israelis and the Palestinian factions operating in Gaza well it's no secret that the Egyptians have always played this role whenever an eruption of violence between the Palestinian and Israel has happened let me remind your viewers that Egypt brokered a ceasefire when the war erupted in November 2012 when it was Egypt who brokered the latest ceasefire in August 2014 which was brought to attention yesterday again and it also seems to me that there are an Egyptian efforts right now between be taken by the Egyptians to broker a long-term ceasefire or what we call it a long-term Hrodna or truce between Israel and the Palestinian resistance groups mainly Hamas and the Islamic Jihad in which both parties will will respect their commitment to the ceasefire agreement but also which will extend it for a long time in exchange for Israel to lift and is it's a sea jump lock aid against the Gaza Strip but also a return for Hamas will have to stop digging in new tunnels between Gaza and Israel and also will stop the improvement of its missile and rocket technology but whether that a new ceasefire will be implemented or would be reached any time soon it's it's it's that is the big question because as long as there is no long ceasefire or loan no truce between the Palestinians and Israel which started more than two two months ago will continue until June 5th at least or until Israel put again to its siege on blockade over the Gaza Strip l Hana is it possible to talk about long term arrangements a truce as long as the core issues are not addressed properly particularly when it comes to the 12 year long blockade imposed on Gaza well I think when talking about core issues we should first be honest about the sides to this conflict now there aren't just Israel and the Palestinians but in fact there are three sides to this conflict namely Israel Hamas and Fatah now these two Palestinian governments are now engaged in a battle of mutual destruction it's muga bus who demanded that Israel reduced Gaza's electricity by 40% last June it's mahmoud abbas who stopped paying for patients to be treated in the West Bank it's mahmoud abbas who stopped paying salaries for all civil servants in gaza so in order to reach an agreement with Hamas Israel is in a dilemma Israel by accommodating Hamas which I think or the people of the Gaza Strip which I believe it should do to some extent for humanitarian reasons would be putting itself in direct conflict with Mahmoud Abbas whose strategy is today to starve the Gaza Strip into submission and force Hamas to capitulate and return all of its authorities security authority to the palestinian government so israel now needs to choose between siding with the site with the government of hamas which is committed to its destruction over the the the side of mahmoud abbas which works and coordinates and security and assures israel's security in the West Bank I have a serious dilemma which I think the viewers should appreciate okay what will govern how to talk a little bit in detail about that political divide between the two fashions I meant is it as al Haddad is basically saying the problem lies in the political divide between Hamas and Fatah well to be honest this is like the very easy pretext to use the dilemma is in fact the Israeli occupation it's not the Hamas and Fatah split with all due respect this is what the Israeli side is always using this obsolete outdated rhetoric and narrative they always speak about this but let's remind the viewers that yes Ralph at was the founder of the Oslo agreement and he was besieged by the Israelis when he was the sole and only reddit himmat representative of the Palestinian people and he was the partner of a Rabi I'm the one who was killed by a radical settlers in Israel please please just let me finish my well I'm talking if I don't go back and the most insulting thing the most important thing the aschen is the Israelis are now in a big ethical a dilemma where it is the whole rugged State of Israel is being exposed to the international exposure this scandal of the Israeli forces using this kind of excessive violence and force against civilians where their labor man the defence minister is saying there is no innocent people inside the Gaza Strip this is the democracy of Israel let's say racist democracy of Israel when they try to tell the people look at what happened to the flotilla to the ship that is trying to breach the the siege on the Gaza Strip why they still going on with the siege of the Gaza Strip Gaza Strip is still under the occupation and the First Solar is responsible for that that should be held accountable by the international community is their Israeli occupation okay your point let's get the chance to El Hana and to respond go ahead Alan let me be clear I think that Israel's government has been unimaginative and maybe even lazy and finding solutions to Gaza situation it should improve Gaza's infrastructure in electricity it should expand the fishing it should expand some example yes I am Tory like it should allow people's right allow Gaza not just grant disables were I in Israel and expand and expand the permit regime of allowing permits in in Israel having said that let's not pretend uses Israel's responsibility alone there is a strategy by the Palestinian Authority which works closely with Israel to cause to force Hamas to give up authorities there's a coordinated effort now by Egypt and command the Palestinian Authority and Israel to put pressure on Hamas now Israel needs to choose whether its sides with his act with its Arab allies in the form of Egypt and Mahmoud Abbas or whether it defends its own security concerns on the Gaza border whether there is even someone in the Gaza side in Hamas was willing to reach understandings with Israel only a few weeks ago smile Neah said that they want to cause israel Annunaki be' a new catastrophe he said that on the day of the Nakba memorial so israel is really here facing a hard choice it wants to improve conditions in gaza it realizes that Gaza's humanitarian crisis has difficult repercussions not only on Gaza but also on Israel but it needs to decide politically as well what ramifications these moves will have speaking of the ramifications bahama the international community does not seem to be really willing to implement an aggressive approach for as far as Gaza is concerned why do you think its response has been so far muted well you can say that yes and no yes the international community has been very much silent over the past 12 years since Israel imposes siege on blockade against the Gaza Strip after Hamas took over the Gaza from the PA in the summer of 2007 and the UN at that time accepted the Israeli definition of Gaza as a hostile entity and the Israeli measures against Gaza at that time but gradually I have to say that the international community's position toward the Israeli siege and blockade of against Gaza has changed and we had seen a numerous occasions when the UN secretary-general with a mr. Gutierrez or his predecessor ban ki-moon who has asked Israel to put an end to its siege a blockade of the Gaza Strip and to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe or in the Gaza Strip which we have seen many facets of it in terms of poverty unemployment lack of electricity lack of potable water and also access and movement for the two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip but let me also remind your guest mr. Allen and mineral that it's not the Palestinian divide who caused all of these problems to the two million Palestinians in Gaza before we we are talking about the Palestinian internal divide it's the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the power and territories for more than 50 years now and it's also the policy of the Israeli government to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza are not Turkey not to recognize and accept and respect so to speak the results of the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006 when Hamas win the elections and Israel did not accept the results of those elections and let me also add one more point is that the Palestinians are really in a very delicate situation whenever there are serious talks between Hamas and Fatah to try to put an end to the Palestinian internal divide and there comes the Israeli role to sabotage any efforts to end the politically the internal divide it was in 2014 when Hamas and Fatah reached a new agreement and on that day Prime Minister Netanyahu came out and said a President Mahmoud Abbas must choose between peace with Israel every conciliation with Hamas so it's the Israeli government led by Netanyahu and the white wing who are sabotaging every effort that put forward to put an end to the Palestinian okay not divided because it does serve the interest of Israel the Palestinians divided between West Bank and Gaza general black to move forward to an another angle related to this story in particular I met the Israeli intelligence minister Israel Kant said that describing I mean the the barrage of rockets fired by Hamas and jihad into Israel saying I see an Iranian fingerprint here is this could this be taken as an indication that the Israelis could further escalate their action in Gaza well first of all I don't think that any party is interested in any escalation whether the Israelis or even Hamas on the other hand because the situation is so fragile and in case this kind of new cycle of violence erupted nobody anybody can start the war but nobody can know where it's going and when it's going to end and that's why the other angle of this has Hashem is the Iranian cause and the Saudi coalition you should put things into bigger context understand the dynamics of the whole region where in yousa new coalition is being set up by the Saudis the Emiratis and trying to include Israel and to do that Israel should always show that they are the enemy of the Iranians that's why you would understand the rhetoric coming from the Gulf states against the Hamas the Muslim Brotherhood and more intimate to Israel and the United States and that would explain why Israel is always trying to portray that it's Iran the hegemony of Iran in the region that is they're trying to counter and they Sunni the Arab countries are more a adamantly insisting on normalizing their relations with the Israeli government in order to confront this kind of him over expansionist policy of the Iranians but on the other hand Hamas and the Islamic Jihad and the other factions on the ground they do have a kind of responsibility to keep these kind of a formulas on the ground like to keep the truth the de facto status but on the other hand there peacefully working with the people in a peaceful demonstration to expose the hypocrisy of the international community the inaction of the United States the United Nations and also the Arab world they are oblique that they are unable even to condemn now and I'm too poor to offer the other friends like something to work on like Turkey okay and Hanna and do you think that the Iranian factor that has been mentioned by Israel Kass is something that could be seen as an attempt by the Israelis to deflect attention from the fact that Iran is not the issue the issue is the killing of civilians of innocent people in Gaza by the Israelis which is the issue that has to be addressed well Iran is part of the issue because Iran is the main financier today of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad but going back to the previous subject certainly the government of Netanyahu has benefited or seized the situation of disunity between Hamas and Fatah between Gaza and the West Bank as beneficial to Israel I disagree with that position I think that the two sides can only reach an agreement when there is Palestinian unity but on the other hand let's not kid ourselves I mean a few weeks ago when there was an attempt on the life of Prime Minister Rami hamdallah in Gaza it was Mahmoud Abbas who accused Hamas of trying to assassinate hamdallah and saying that he has proof of that so professor Abu Saud let's not absolve the Palestinian side of responsibility for the state of disunity when Israel had to establish its state in 48 it managed to overcome very deep political divides and I would say arms and militias that existed in multiple groups and unify under one arms on one Derwin army under one leadership and under one strategy the Palestinians in order to reach peace with Israel in order to return to the negotiating table will have to do the same thing they'll have to overcome attempts to weaken them both by Israel and both by other countries including Arab countries the Palestinians can't throw all the responsibility and all the blame just on the Israelis maybe take that question too Mahima you've heard what Hannah is basically was saying that Palestinians need to get their act together set aside their differences and move forward do you see it that way now now it is it is interesting what was mentioned by Mr Al Hana and Miller but let me remind al Hana and a few a few points here that yes I'm not exempting the Palestinians from their own responsibilities with regard to the continuation of the internal political divide between West Bank and Gaza which has been going on for almost 11 years now and it is definitely a sad thing for the Palestinians are for the Palestinian national projects but let me remind mr. al haaj on Miller that it was Israel who encouraged the Palestinians to clash out between Hamas and Fatah when Israel decided to disengage from the Gaza Strip in the summer of 2005 without negotiating this Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip with the Palestinian Authority which was the address for the Palestinian people and Israeli intention well that as a mishit - I'm not exempting the Palestinians from going with or directly or not - with this Israeli interest but let me let me also let me also add that fortunately many years now thank you thank you thank you very much thank you Mohammed Abu Saud el
