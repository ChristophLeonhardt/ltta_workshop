1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,710
there are seemingly a ton of online ad

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,910
marketplaces how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you differentiate</font>

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,010
yourself from the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's a</font>

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,150
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question it's definitely something</font>

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,849
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a lot as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I start up for</font>

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,530
us the market in which we operate is

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,299
really a brand new segment of the cost

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,920
per lead marketplace so you can separate

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,840
gospel<font color="#E5E5E5"> early to advertising into two</font>

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,580
categories the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first is kind of the only</font>

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">category which is sales leads those are</font>

12
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,779
generic leads mortgages car loans

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,000
insurance those leads can be resold to

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,769
multiple buyers so if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

15
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,330
lending tree for offers for your loan

16
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,610
that means your data sold four times for

17
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,710
mortgage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes sense however in the</font>

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,300
category that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been creating which</font>

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,280
is marketing leads the data is one

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,960
hundred percent owned by the advertiser

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,570
and is specific to that advertiser so

22
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,100
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we were the only cost per</font>

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,329
lead company to work with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obama</font>

24
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,399
campaign those leads that we generated

25
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,809
were the property of the Obama campaign

26
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,280
obviously we couldn't sell them to

27
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,050
another political candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> reigns there</font>

28
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,250
wouldn't be happy I would clearly not

29
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,680
given the the lead generation regulatory

30
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">screen d a couple years ago I believe</font>

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys came in after that did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

32
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,989
affect your vision at all or did you see

33
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:05,459
a niche come about because of the

34
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,950
regulation yeah so really certainly saw

35
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,659
that there was an overarching need for

36
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,280
transparency in the market so

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,350
transparently in this case simply means

38
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,700
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know where your offers are</font>

39
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,930
running do you know what publishers

40
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,030
you're using where your creative is what

41
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,920
it looks like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in itself is very</font>

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,900
disruptive and the cost per lead market

43
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,070
because it really never existed before

44
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,380
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of our underlying</font>

45
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,750
premise now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think your third</font>

46
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,119
startup yes how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you walk the</font>

47
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,560
tightrope we were just talking about

48
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,299
venture capitalist yeah how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font>

49
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,549
the tightrope between cash conservation

50
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,159
and further in your brand yeah yeah I

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,180
think that's something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to think</font>

52
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">about every day when you're running a</font>

53
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,299
start-up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the bottom line is</font>

54
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to be ruthlessly honest with</font>

55
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,689
yourself about your position in the

56
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,880
market and you know what is your real

57
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,250
access to capital if you have access to

58
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,110
capital then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you can</font>

59
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,939
be more aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can postpone</font>

60
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,530
profitability and go for market share

61
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,329
you know especially if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a very</font>

62
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">large market you know like we do you</font>

63
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,509
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are other companies</font>

64
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know not</font>

65
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,410
they don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as large a</font>

66
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,000
potential market and you don't

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,380
necessarily want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create an entity</font>

68
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,740
with a massive burn rate we want to

69
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,970
target profitability and there as

70
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,280
quickly as you can now what's the best

71
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,680
advice you've ever received with regard

72
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,500
to starting a company yeah yeah well I

73
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the two the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two best pieces of</font>

74
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,980
advice because they're interrelated and

75
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,360
it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Marc</font>

76
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Andreessen talks about a lot with</font>

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,350
product market fit is one you have to

78
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">love risk if you're an entrepreneur you</font>

79
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,100
have to love risk and we're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

80
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,200
take a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of risk and go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep at</font>

81
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,850
night with a lot of risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

82
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,489
able to sleep inhale asleep re not

83
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,800
obviously but the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take that</font>

84
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk means you can get through the</font>

85
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,190
second or third obstacle and the 200th

86
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,200
obstacle that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face as an</font>

87
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,270
entrepreneur<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really that risk is</font>

88
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,650
also related to the need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be flexible</font>

89
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,989
because you know as Mark I think said a

90
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,090
while ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's setting a lot of blog</font>

91
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,890
posts you have to be really willing to

92
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,830
change your initial mission because you

93
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,410
know has a great military leader once

94
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,239
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know no battle plan survives</font>

95
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,489
contact with the enemy you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

96
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,769
have to change your mission based on

97
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,910
conditions on the ground and we

98
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,130
certainly evolved a lot has a company

99
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a core vision but the specifics</font>

100
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,799
changed and that flexibility is really

101
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,560
key to success now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go sit down</font>

102
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Marc Andreessen what does any</font>

103
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,269
executive of a new startup need to know

104
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:27,510
what do you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to pull off</font>

105
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that meeting sure well I think you</font>

106
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,930
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have something that you know</font>

107
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,430
ideally has never been done<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and</font>

108
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,320
sometimes those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't</font>

109
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,480
necessarily as pie in the sky as people

110
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see a lot of buzz</font>

111
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,870
out in the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

112
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,120
media<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual worlds virtual currency</font>

113
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,530
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the biggest</font>

114
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,880
opportunities are right in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

115
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,920
I mean look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at cost per lead you know</font>

116
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,200
fundamentally people are creating all

117
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,329
these new<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and mobile and</font>

118
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:53,190
gagement all these different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

119
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,720
so much of that media is still being

120
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,310
bought and sold in very old models

121
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,070
either CPM which is an old newspaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

122
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,500
essential yep pricing model or CPC which

123
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,530
is newer but fundamentally you know this

124
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,390
there's still big pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

125
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,590
that needs to be developed

126
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,720
in order to monetize content for

127
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,209
publishers and now make advertising more

128
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,260
effective there's still a lot of

129
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,489
fundamental problems that are right<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

130
00:04:14,489 --> 00:00:00,000
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that need to be solved</font>
