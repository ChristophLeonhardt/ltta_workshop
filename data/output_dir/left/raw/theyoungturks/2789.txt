1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,650
EARLIER THIS WEEK, A STORY WENT
VIRAL INVOLVING A TEACHER

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,919
IN LOUISIANA WHO CALLED INTO
QUESTION ARRAYS AT THE

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,310
SUPERINTENDENT WAS GOING TO GET
TO THE TUNE OF $38,000.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,420
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE TEACHERS
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE NOT

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,060
RECEIVED A RAISE IN YEARS AND SO
DURING THIS PUBLIC MEETING, SHE

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,080
DECIDED TO VOICE HER CONCERNS
AND THE BOARD PRESIDENTS, NOT

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,600
ONLY KICKED HER OUT BUT GAVE A
NOD TO THE MARSHALL IN THE

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,110
ROOM AND UNFORTUNATELY SHE GOT
ARRESTED.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,120
THE SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT HAS
DECIDED TO DEFEND THE

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,860
MARSHALL'S DECISION TO ARREST
HER.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,190
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE YOU HIS
STATEMENTS IN JUST A

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,780
SECOND, BUT I JUST WANT TO SHOW
YOU THE VIDEO AGAIN TO GIVE

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,070
YOU AN IDEA OF HOW RIDICULOUS
THIS WAS.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,390
TAKE A LOOK.

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,120
SHE SPOKE UP DURING PUBLIC
COMMENTS.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,670
IT'S BASICALLY TAKING IT OUT OF
OUR POCKETS.

17
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,120
HER ISSUE, THE
SUPERINTENDENT'S NEW CONTRACT.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,330
ANY PERSON IN A POSITION OF
LEADERSHIP GETTING ANY TYPE OF

19
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,749
RAISE, I FEEL LIKE IT IS A SLAP
IN THE FACE ALL THE TEACHERS,

20
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:08,939
CAFETERIA WORKERS, ANY OTHER
SUPPORT STAFF THAT WE HAVE.

21
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,880
SHE RECEIVED A WARNING DIET WAS
PUBLIC COMMENTS ONLY, NOT A

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,859
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
ALTHOUGH BOARD OFFICIALS

23
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,880
WERE ANSWERING HER QUESTIONS.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,479
AFTER BEING CALLED ON THE SECOND
TIME, THAT'S WHEN THE CITY

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,009
MARSHALL STEPPED IN.

26
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,229
EXCUSE ME.

27
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,680
IS IT AGAINST POLICY TO STAND?

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,399
SIR, DO NOT.

29
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,340
THIS IS THE MOST IS GRATEFUL.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,619
SHE LEFT THE MEETING, BUT IN THE
HALLWAY.

31
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:34,619
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:35,619
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,619
CAN YOU EXPLAIN?

34
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:37,619
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,619
STOP RESISTING.

36
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:39,659
I AM NOT, YOU JUST PUSHED ME TO
THE FLOOR.

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:53,880
SIR, HOLD ON I AM WAY SMALLER
THAN YOU.

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,270
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
OUTRAGED AFTER SEEING THE

39
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,319
VIDEO BUT THE PRESIDENT OF THE
SCHOOL BOARD IS DEFENDING

40
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,790
THE DECISION TO GET HER
ARRESTED.

41
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:08,110
ANTHONY FONTANA SAID:

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:29,730
CHOICES 
LIKE 

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,360
ASKING A QUESTION.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,299
I LOVE AMERICA.

45
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,500
I DEFEND IT.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,950
I WANT TO GET BACK TO AN AMERICA
THAT BELIEVED IN FREEDOM OF

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,599
SPEECH AND BELIEVES IN ITS
CITIZENS.

48
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,569
FOR US TO TREAT OUR CITIZENS
THAT WAY, YOU EITHER AGREE

49
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,489
OR DISAGREE ON WHETHER THE
SUPERINTENDENT HAS SHOULD'VE

50
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,860
GOTTEN THE RAZOR WHETHER THE
TEACHER SHOULD GET THE RACE, BUT

51
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,200
DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK THAT
THE TEACHER SHOULD BE ARRESTED.

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,219
A TEACHER ARRESTED FOR ASKING A
QUESTION OR SPEAKING OUT ON

53
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,170
HER POSITION ON THE ISSUE.

54
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,739
IT IS A POLICE STATE EVERYWHERE
AND ALL OF COURSE THE GUY

55
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:04,739
DEFENDS IT.

56
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,170
HE IS THE ONE YOU SAW ON TAPE
NODDING TO THE MARSHALL

57
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,330
LIKE TAKE HER OUT.

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS A TERRIBLE ABUSE OF POWER.
