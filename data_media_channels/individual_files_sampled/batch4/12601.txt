show and I have to figure out what am I going to talk about today and then president Trump does my show prep for me because he goes on Twitter and that's what happened this morning when the president decided to tweet about tariffs and here's what the president tweeted and it is pretty spectacular he tweeted tariffs are the greatest exclamation point either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal and order gets hit with tariffs it's as simple as that and everybody's talking remember we are the piggy bank scare quotes that's being robbed all will be great capital G Wow there's a lot there to unpack okay so we could talk about the back are not in fact the greatest the last people who thought the tariffs were the greatest were a couple of guys named Smoot and Harley they were responsible for a tariff regime that ended up lengthening the Great Depression by probably eight years so tariffs are not in fact the greatest specifically because they're artificially increasing the price of products that you pay for on the shelves and they are also artificially increasing the part the prices of inputs for American companies they also draw a retaliatory tariffs so that means that American companies can't ship their products overseas to sell them how do I know all this well it's not Theory according to Bloomberg harley-davidson has now cut his profit margin forecast for this year because of tariffs this is breaking today harley-davidson has cut its forecast for profit margin by an amount that suggests it's finding a way to cope with the damage done by President Donald Trump's trade war operating margin this year will drop to about nine point five percent that's a midpoint of a range the Milwaukee based manufacturer gave in a statement on Tuesday citing the expected impacts of tariffs they had been projecting a margin of roughly 10 percent so this is a little bit lower than their normal margins and they're also moving some of their factories to Europe also whirlpool has now announced that they are lowering their estimates for this year the maker of home appliance has said rising raw material costs hurt results in three out of four of its regional markets in the second quarter including North America Asia and it's struggling Europe Middle East and Africa division the only region where it didn't cite input cost inflation was in Latin America which faced its own problems in the second quarter according to Bloomberg including a Brazilian trucker strikes according to chief executive officer mark Robert Bitzer he said our annual steel contracts and hedging contracts with our base metals give us some protection but do not insulate us from these more material trends so in other words all of those manufacturing jobs that President Trump wants to protect are actually being hurt by the tariffs that he loves and thinks are the greatest technically by the way Muhammad Ali is the greatest I mean we all know that but according to president trump tariffs are in fact the greatest also I do love that everybody is talking I didn't realize that that was a school of economics now the everybody's talking school of economics and I was also under the impression that everybody was talking about the bird because of course the bird is the word but the fact that the President of the United States continues to tweet out about the stuff suggests that he doesn't actually know what he's talking about we are not a piggy bank being robbed again for the 1,000th time when I make a trade with you you are not robbing me robbing me involves you using force or deception in order to take products or services or money from me without my knowledge or without my consent that is not what happens in a trade if I have a trade deficit with you that's because I gave you money and you gave me a product I have a trade deficit with lots of people over all I do okay ask fiscally that's true of the United States as well but I have a trade deficit with my dry cleaners I have a trade deficit with our nanny I have a trade deficit with our gardener I have a trade deficit with the with the local restaurants around here a pretty massive trade deficit with the local restaurants around here that doesn't mean the solution is for me to stop shopping at those restaurants or stores at the grocery and instead artificially increase costs now how do we know that this is actually having an impact I know there are a lot of people right now are shaking their heads no if Trump says tariffs are great it's because tariffs are great because he's making tariffs great again or somesuch if this were the case then why exactly is the president now announcing that he is going to be providing aid to farmers so according to Politico today the Trump administration is planning to ease fears of a trade war by announcing later on Tuesday billions of dollars in aid to farmers hurt by tariffs according to two sources familiar with the plan the administration's plan will use two commodities support programs in the farm bill as well as the agricultural department's broad authority to stabilize the agricultural economy during times of turmoil the plan has been in the works for months it seeks to ensure US farmers and ranchers a key constituency for President Trump and Republicans don't bear the brunt of an escalating trade fight with China the European Union and other major economies as the administration pursues an aggressive course to rebalance America's trade relationships Trump's move to slap tariffs on imports from some of America's largest trading partners have prompted retaliation against US farm goods like pork beef soybeans sorghum and a range of fruits so it's happening is that President Trump decided he wanted to tariffs cars for example and these countries that we are now terrifying have decided they're going to tariffs America and extra cultural exports which means that our farmers don't have any place to ship their goods which are now withering on the vine so now President Trump is going to borrow from the future in order to pay off those farmers this is exactly what FDR did this is exactly FDR's policy FDR's policy from 1933 all the way until the war began in 1941 was this policy the policy was that we are going to leverage tariffs against people who are screwing us in trade wars we're gonna those trade Wars and then we were going to somehow make up for all the farmers who were losing money by artificially boosting prices now if the are ones how virus to actually regulate farmers and force farmers to actually burn off their excess grain and supply in order to boost prices so he provided them with all sorts of subsidies and then he also regulated up them up the wazoo see didn't have an oversupply of grain this led to a very famous case at the Supreme Court called Wickard V filburn when a guy was growing grain for his own consumption and the federal government said you have to burn off the grain for your own consumption because you're artificially lowering the price of grain you're creating too much grain it's lowering the price in the global market because you are eating that grain instead of buying it from somebody else and the Supreme Court idiotically under pressure from FDR found that the federal government could actually regulate your ability to grow grain in your own backyard for your own use somehow this impact in interstate commerce Trump's policy here is FDR policy and this is one of the problems with the areas where the president has sole control the Constitution of the United States does not delegate tariff power to the President of the United States it delegates tariff power to the legislature now originally the legislature delegated tariff power the President of the United States because they wanted the presidency they wanted the executive branch to lower tariffs and they figured that it would be easier to have a president who could unilaterally lower tariffs than it would be to have a legislature that has a lower tariffs by Fiat by legislation well the problem is once you give a lot of power to the executive the executive can use it however he wants so the presidents of the United States can simply play with the tariff rights this is what FDR did in the 1930s it was a disaster area and Donald Trump is doing it now none of this is particularly good policy and and the president should reverse this as fast as possible larry cudlow somewhere is spinning in his grave wait he's still alive right okay larry cudlow somewhere is spinning in his office but all the people in the in the administration who are pro free-trade are looking at tweets like this and thinking why would the president undercut his own strong economy with this sort of foolishness and you can't you can't hope that the economy holds out forever when you are taking measures that are designed to tamp down the economy tariffs are not in fact great and the president is going to find that out the hard way if he continues along this path now the all of this has some impact on the generic congressional ballot right now it looks like the Democrats do have the momentum again in the congressional races the president's approval ratings as I discussed yesterday continue to be very high but the congressional races are starting to open up in favor of Democrats at least on the generic ballot and part of that is because the president is unpopular if as I said yesterday the Democrats are going to climb back into this thing if the if the Republicans are going to climb back into this thing it's going to be a reliant on the Democrats overstepping their boundaries fortunately there is a good shot of that the the I think solid critiques that could be leveraged against policies of the Trump administration of gone by the wayside in favor of completely unhinged insane sort of critiques so kirsten gillibrand leads the way she suggests that it's time for the Democratic Party to abolish ice if she wants to ensure that the Democrats never win back Congress is a pretty solid way to do it right here I think we should get rid of ice we should separate out to missions and do the anti-terrorism mission the national security mission and then on the other side make sure you're doing looking at immigration as a humanitarian issue these are civil issues these are families look at as the economic engine that it is that immigration is our strength it is our diversity is what makes this country and our economy so strong okay so she wants to abolish ice that's obviously going to be a very unpopular point of view but she's nothing compared to Andrew Cuomo so Andrew Cuomo wants to run for president of the United States which would be amazing he'd be the first inanimate object ever to be presidents of the United States Andrew Cuomo that'd be like an actual incredible thing I used to think that Chris Cuomo was the dummer of the Cuomo brothers and it turns out that Andrew is actually the dummer of the Cuomo brothers and also the least charming which is pretty amazing I mean like I really didn't think that was possible yesterday Andrew Cuomo was speaking and he said that President Trump had declared a jihad he'd put a jihad on you he declared a jihad on the on immigrants to the United States yeah this kind of language is definitely gonna win Democrats a lot of friends and supporters what they've done at the border is an example of it what they've done in Puerto Rico and they are on a jihad to deport as many people as they can who they believe are not in the United States legally okay so they are on a jihad first of all I would just like to point out that if a Republican ever said that any politician was on a jihad against anything people would immediately call them an Islamophobe right you're only allowed to use the word jihad when you are specifically referring to an internal struggle because that's what it means according to Quran okay so guys get that right and then Andrew but Andrew Cuomo says the Trump is on a jihad against immigrants yeah that's that's the way you're gonna win over all those people in the middle of the country who are attempting to cope with falling wages in particular industries if you really think that any of that is going to win back the the base of Trump support to the Democratic side of the aisle you have to be crazy in the second I want to talk about the elitism that is evident in some of these particular comments which is translated over to the reaction to the the New York Daily News I'm going to talk about that in just one second first let's talk about your suits okay so the fact is that the suit you are wearing right now you look like your schlump okay I know you're at the office and you think you look like you don't you look like a schlump the reason I know you look like there slump is because you got that suit off the rack didn't you you went down to the local suit warehouse and then you picked up the front of the thing you thought was gonna fit you and now it looks like you're wearing a burlap sack with a couple

guess when you look at president Trump's trade policy and then you look at the Democrats response to President Trump on immigration there's a bigger message that comes out from it as much as I dislike president Trump's trade policy and I do I think it's garbage I think the president Trump doesn't understand basic economics when it comes to trade I think has a bizarre version of how trade deficits actually work I think this is likely to be harmful to his account to the economy that he is president during I don't like using the phrase his economy cuz I don't think the president runs the economy but the economy over which he presides I think it's going to hurt him to pursue this policy with that said if you have to contrast president Trump's apparent like for sort of the manufacturing base and the people in the middle of the country what the Democrats dislike for those people there's a reason that President Trump won Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio going away there's a reason that he did that and the reason that he that is a feeling of sympathy for these workers now I think the tariff policy he's pursuing hurts a lot of those workers and I think the president ought to understand that I think he's gonna lose votes in these states with his tariff policy but it's pretty clear that the president's heart is with a lot of those people even if the policy he's pursuing doesn't actually end with with benefit to those particular folks the same is not true of a lot of the folks in our media how do I know this because take a look at the reaction to the to the failing New York Daily News okay so the New York Daily News is having some serious problems the presidents of the United States always likes to say the failing New York Times this the failing New York Times that the reality is that there is one major newspaper that is failing in New York and it is the New York Daily News the New York Daily News decided they were going to cut 50% of their editorial team they announced this on Monday they sent a letter to their entire staff they said we're reducing today the size of the editorial team by approximately 50% and refocusing much of our talents on breaking news especially in areas of crime civil justice and public responsibility this is according to trunk which is the parent company the editor in chief with enemy Jim Ritchie tweeted out his disappointment he said if you hate democracy and think local governments should operate unchecked and in the dark then today is a good day for you because that's clearly what the parent company was thinking they weren't thinking about the profit margins they were thinking how do we make room for local government to operate in the dark and unchecked let's fire half our staff that's probably what was going on at trunk but the part that's really telling is the reaction from all of these leftist politicians in New York State so a bunch of journalists get fired over the New York Daily News and it's kind of amazing how these politicians react so here's how the politicians react Bill DeBlasio is the New York mayor and he says quote it's no secret that I've disagreed with the newt with the Daily News from time to time but trunks greedy decision to gut the newsroom is bad for government and a disaster for New York City trunks should sell the paper to someone committed to local journalism and keeping reporters on the beat well thanks for your advice communist mayor of New York who's never owned a business really really appreciate that and then Andrew Cuomo also issued a statement so the block of wood known as the governor of New York he issued a statement as well again mostly amazing the blocks of wood can become animate and issue statements like this but I guess you know anything is possible in today's world he identifies as a human the Daily News now owned by trunk Inc is apparently firing a major portion of their reporting staffs as the governor this will undoubtedly devastate many households and hurt an important New York institution and one of our nation's journalism Giants whether do I think that Andrew Cuomo to react the same way of Fox News fired half its staff I have some doubts since these layoffs were made without notifying the state or asking for assistance this is a free country when is the last time if I fire someone at this company I don't actually have to notify Jerry Brown the governor of the state of California first of all I assume Jerry Brown be happy if people if we lost employees at the Daily wire but that in itself is a bizarre statement then he says my father as governor came to the aid of the New York Post when it faced difficult financial times even though the post represented an opposing active partisan interest my father understood the value of a robust Free Press so do i purge trunk to reconsider this drastic move and stand ready to work with them to avert this disaster I understand that large corporations often only see profit and dividends as the bottom line well that's how they got to be large corporations if you don't see profit as a bottom line then that's because you're bad at business says but in New York we also calculate loss of an important institution loss of jobs and the impact of families affected I hope trunk does the same and recalculates its decision New York State stands ready to help first of all let me point out the conflict between the editor-in-chief of the New York Daily News saying if you want heavier scrutiny on government what happened today is terrible and then the government saying will help you rehire all those reporters do you think maybe those reporters might go easy on Governor Cuomo if Governor Cuomo is the person who gets them rehired at the New York Daily News you think maybe a corrupt relationship between the government in the press is probably a bad idea but that's really not the point that I'm seeking to make the point I'm seeking to make is that the level of outrage over the firing of these journalists is wildly outsized there are industries in the United States where people have lost their job they're talking about dying industry towns we're talking about production factories that existed in the Rust Belt that have gone empty they've turned into ghost towns and there are those of us who are free-market people who say you know there are certain things that just happened under a capitalist system Joseph Schumpeter called it creative destruction where every time there's a new technological development certain people in certain industries lose jobs and we have to try and grease the skids so that they can get new jobs in a different industry or move out of those dying towns right we have to do something to help those people move out of dyeing industry but that's just the way the economy works but there are a bunch of people in the press who just ignore those people completely who sort of have scorn for all those people who are working in factory towns one of these rubes who voted for Donald Trump he's stupid rubes voted for Donald Trump don't they understand how the economy works don't they understand creative destruction don't they understand that the economy moves on and these are low IQ idiot plumbers showing their butt cracks you know it don't they under then when it's journalists then the world ends right when it's journalists then we all have to cry about it we have to deep tears pity rage now the thing is that the journalistic industry is actually not in all that much trouble the New York Times is doing fine The Wall Street Journal is doing fine it's just that everybody is moving over to a subscription basis online as opposed to free online content the New York Daily News thought that they could cover for a bad press strategy and a bad business strategy by just printing nasty covers about President Trump incessantly they thought that was going to raise their profile and their circulation it did not but because they made a bunch of bad decisions they laid off a bunch of people but it is indicative of a certain self-centeredness that exists on the coast and in particular industries that journalists jobs are more important than the rest of your jobs that somehow these journalists losing their jobs is a tragedy for the country but the factory worker in the center of the country losing his job is just fine now my view on this is that anybody who loses a job that's a sad thing but we have to determine whether that is a free-market force at play and whether we can help those people out on the back end but without actually regulating all of these other industries into into sort of subservience to keeping lacking industries alive but the but the fact that there is this dichotomy in the cultural attitude toward various jobs I think is very telling and one of the reasons the President of the United States continues to be very successful there's a feeling people too York Daily News don't care very much about you if you're in Ohio and the president does even if the policy the president is pursuing on trade is just not correct okay now meanwhile don't talk a little bit about something that nikki Haley did last night that I think is really spectacular so president Trump's ambassador to the UN nikki Haley did something that is is quite great she's speaking to a bunch of high schoolers at the at the TP USA at the turning point USA High School Leadership Summit and she spoke specifically about owning the libs now we'll talk about this in just a second first I want to tell you about what happens if you experience a disaster there's an emergency what is your first impulse okay here in California we are now experiencing a massive heat wave and the government is telling us we should turn off our air conditioner and lights which is just not going to happen but if all the lights go out if the air conditioner should go out if all the food in your fridge starts to spoil and suddenly all of the grocery shelves are empty because everybody's running out to try and replenish what are you gonna do that and well one of the ways that you can help kind of militate against all of this is trusting the folks at my Patriots supply for food storage you should have some food in your home and emergency food supply and it's time free to go out and make it happen right now right now each person in your household should get a two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply these food kits are only 67 bucks right now again this is not because we're prepping for the apocalypse or anything it's because there are times when natural disasters hit there are times when the police can't get to you there are times when first responders can't get to you or emergency aid and it's just worthwhile there's an earthquake and you need to be in your house for 24 hours without being able to go to the grocery store you want to make sure that you have taken care of and for relatively cheap you can make that happen with the two-week emergency food supply from my Patriot supply it's eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen go to my special website prepare with been calm let's prepare with Ben comm 888 803 1413 the food lasts up to 25 years in storage and the meals come packed in a rugged slimline tote as well only 67 bucks rest easier tonight knowing you're prepared again that's 888 803 1413 prepare with Ben comprehend calm again eight eight eight eight o 314 at 13 okay so nikki Haley US ambassador to the UN and my spirit animal as I had suggested before I'm a big nikki Haley fan she also happens to be absolutely charming in person and she spoke yesterday at the turning point USA event in Washington DC and I've spoken at many turning-point USA events and it's filled with great kids who really want to help push America in a more conservative direction I mean these are really motivating kids one of the things that's become very common among the younger said and I know because I'm still one of the younger set is that is this this notion then what we ought to do here and the conservative movement is own the libs if you've ever been on Twitter this is all we talk about all day long is owning the lids and here at the Daily wire we are not averse to owning the libs right we have this the leftist here is hot or cold tumblr and it comes free with your membership for 99 bucks a year right we need the whole point of the left is tears tumblr is that we own lives okay but the thing is and when you're going to own the lives meaning own the Liberals when you when you are worried about owning the web's you actually ought to own the lives by purchasing them in a fair market rate and the way that you do this is by actually making a good argument convincing them right that is the way that you own the lives and nikki Haley understands this unfortunately a lot of folks in sort of conservative circles think that triggering the libs is the same as owning the libs triggering the legs is not in fact owning the lives you can take off people on the left very very easily all you have to do is say something basically factual about men and women and people on the left hand very very upset that's fine but triggering people on the left you can do that just by being a jerk as well and I think it's very important to recognize that the way that you win people over is not always by being a jerk so Nikki Haley was speaking at CPUSA and she said raise your hands if you've ever posted anything online to quote-unquote on libs and everybody raised their hand because this is the thing that you do on Twitter and Facebook and then Nikki said I know that it's fun and then it can feel good but step back and think about what you're accomplishing when you do this are you persuading anyone who are you persuading we've all been guilty of it at some point or another but this kind of speech isn't leadership it's the exact opposite real leadership is about persuasion it's about movement it's about bringing people around to your point of view not by shouting them down but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way that you do not only do I think that that message is eminently correct I said basically the same thing at a teepee USA event just a few weeks ago at the Young Women's Leadership Summit but I think that we ought to here on the right take Nikki Haley's words to heart that doesn't mean that we have to be weak and how we promote our viewpoint not at all we should be strong we should be powerful we should be forward with how we promote our viewpoint but we should also recognize that just doing things to tick off people on the left is not actually going to win over the people in the middle that you need in order to win elections in order to win the day the reason I bring this up is because the presidents of the United States yesterday decided that he was going to think about pulling the clearances of various Trump critics from previous administration now here's the thing about security clearances I think that they should automatically expire upon you leaving the government right this is normally the way that it works if you are a if you are fired like James Comey was fired he lost his security clearance I believe the same thing happened with with James clapper as well when you leave an administration very often your security clearance goes away with it but there are certain people who are allowed to keep their security clearance now just because you have a security clearance doesn't mean that you can access classified material it's not like Susan Rice can stroll into the White House any day of the week and then just start accessing the computers and looking up classified materials the idea is that she retains her security clearance in case somebody in the government needs to talk with her or in case she that there's another Democrat who's elected and they want to bring her back in so she doesn't have to be cleared again she retains her security clearance well there's a fair argument to be made by the Trump administration that security clearances should just go away as soon as you no longer work for the government if you have to redo it later than we redo it later that's a fair argument but instead it seems like the Trump administration is talking about removing security clearances from various actors they perceive as bad and many of whom are bad simply out of some sort of retaliatory anger Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked yesterday about a president Trump was going to do with regard to the clearance is exploring these mechanisms to resume remove security clearance because they've politicized and in some cases actually monetize their public service and their security cleanse clearances and making baseless accusations of improper contact with Russia or being influenced by Russia against the president is extremely inappropriate so what that sounds like is Trump is simply removing security clearances from anyone who has one who has been critical of him with regard to Russia and that's not good stuff now again I think there's a case to be made that if you actually think that James clapper or Susan Rice are using their security clearance to get access to information that they are then using to lie about on national television first of all we probably ought to discuss whether there's a legal violation that is prosecutable by the DOJ but if there is not then this sounds like simple troller e now is that owning the libs well ticked off a lot of people yesterday I ticked off a lot of people on the left so Adam Schiff who literally has a pup that is actually pitched at the CNN headquarters is what he does all day he's no longer a congress person he's a congress person to name only and he actually sits out there drinking from a thermos and then he just waits outside until they call him in for his latest hit on CNN so Adam Schiff he says that this is just like I authoritarian regime so the libs have been in fact triggered by President Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggesting that we will punish critics of the present by stripping them of their security clearance that is not what you've seen in democracy that is exactly what you see in authoritarian regimes okay it is not exactly what you see in authoritarian regimes typically an authoritarian regimes you arrest your opponents you don't strip them of a security clearance to which they have no actual solid claim so shift is triggered it's not just chef who's triggered CNN's Gloria Borger was also quite triggered here's what she had to say on CNN yesterday look the president wants to silence his critics period I just think the precedent is sort of stunning and petty small rude and and doesn't speak well for for a President of the United States who is supposed to be able to handle his critics okay so again triggering for Goering everywhere and people on the right celebrate this because when CNN is triggered that means something good is happening well sometimes that's true sometimes it's true than when you trigger CNN it's because something good is happening the president has triggered CNN before for a good reason and I've pointed it out when he has done so the question is whether this is actually beneficial or whether this is just you know trolling the troll Paul Ryan Speaker of the House he was outgoing so he can now speak some truths he says that this is basically just president from trolling people I think he's trolling people honestly this is something that's in the purview of the executive branch I think some of these people already lost their clearances some people keep their clearances that's something that the executive branch deals with it's not really in our purview you can see he's just really annoyed at this point and honestly I'm kind of with Paul Ryan here it is it is one thing to pursue good policy that happens to trigger people on the left to take them off to own them it is another thing simply to trigger them and then assume that you have done something good based on this reaction from the left this is what you end up with in this case is a pure reactionary policy on both sides of the aisle and it's happening on the left - right the left will do stuff just to trigger the right the left will say things like let's abolish ice now how do I know they're lying about abolishing ice because they brought it up for a vote right the Senate Mitch McConnell cocaine Mitch he actually brought this thing up for a vote so Democrats proposed what if we just abolished ice and Mitch McConnell was like let's do that now let's put that up for a vote it went down unanimously not a single Democrat voted to abolish ice even people like Kirsten Gillibrand who said that they want to abolish ice why do they say it then because they're triggering the cons so on the one side you have people triggering the libs on the other side you have people triggering the cons and at no point you have anybody who's actually having a real rational conversation now in just a second I want to talk about what the cost of that is why that stuff actually matters cuz maybe it's all just fun and games and listen on Twitter I do it too right it is fun and games to a certain extent I don't talk about the real cost of this in terms of public policy in just a second but for that you're gonna have to go over to Daley wire calm and subscribe for $9.99 a month you can get the

greatest in all beverage vessels the leftist here is hot or cold tumblr triggering the libs but also because we like to we don't actually wanna on the lips okay we want to lease them because if you honestly if you're going to if you if you own the libs then you actually have to take care and maintenance of them if you lease the libs then the good news is you can turn them in every few years because there are new cupholders right every every new year's they update the cupholders and then you can actually just leased them and turn in one Lib for the next which is actually a better deal so

conservative podcast in the nation so what is all of this triggering the libs triggering the constant what does it matter isn't it all just in good fun well there are two reasons that it matters reason number one when people are very interested in triggering the libs in triggering the Khans they're also very interested in sometimes sometimes going too far so there are those of us who understand that a lot of this is just jokey and in sort of gamey and yes you want to fight the leftist positions as hard as possible because those positions are wrong and in some cases are actually evil you want to fight those positions as hard as you can but that's not the same thing as I'm just gonna say something to say something because it made Whoopi Goldberg man or whatever Whoopi Goldberg is mad about a lot of stuff I don't have to say much to get her mad if you're focused solely and completely on making the other side mad all the time then it stands to reason that you're also going to be more likely to want to do things that cross the bounds of civility you're more likely to want to destroy people's lives based on giant nothing's for example you're more likely to say well I want a grand victory because the ends justify the means after all I triggered them and if I triggered them that means I did something right well that doesn't make for good dialogue also it is true that it brings you to a certain sort of crisis mentality right that the whole triggering phenomenon basically assumes the people on the other side of the aisle are the worst that humanity has to offer so simply by dint of you making them angry you've done something good and done something right that you making them angry is in and of itself an achievable and easy goal and therefore it's something that we should aim at but what if it turns out that the stuff that we're triggering each other over is actually rather minor but the stuff we spend most of our time agonizing over is actually relatively unimportant the reason I think about this is that you know I live in Los Angeles and everybody in my immediate vicinity everybody within a nuclear blast radius of this office is on the left and all of those people invariably invariably think we're living in a crisis scenario you look around la people are living pretty good I'm pretty high on the hog everybody has a nice house people have nice cars aside from the mass number of homeless people brought in by the left in the city which is a serious problem people are living pretty well okay people are you can be born in the society and expect to live a full eight decades and then things are good things are good and yet we think that everything is a crisis because we think everything is a crisis every headline becomes an excuse to fight the daily battle by triggering the other side but what if the real crisis that our society is facing our crises that are much deeper than that crises of for example entitlement spending that is going to cripple our ability to do anything in the future crises of a of a young population that is losing its purpose amidst all of this internecine warfare what if it turns out that our broader issues at stake and serious conversations are merited well if you're too busy triggering the other side you can't have those serious conversations because it's more important to slander the other side is something terrible than it is to have conversations that are actually productive you know it's it's been very telling I think the last couple of weeks now I try to make a point as much as I enjoy triggering the occasional Lib and I do have a stock of libs in my garage I mean it's sort of like season 2 of The Walking Dead I actually have in my garage a bunch of libs you just sort of wander around in there because I own many of them but you know when when you one of the things I've been trying to do and I've been really this is not new I've been trying to this since law school is have substantive conversations with people on the left the reason I want to have the substance of conversations is because it at least clarifies where we stand in where the real rifts in our society are going to be when it comes to solving these serious and deep issues and if we can't have those conversations then what we end up doing is trying to simply destroy each other for purposes of the latest news cycle and that means making people lose their jobs and it means destroying people's careers and it means going back through everybody's old tweets and destroying them one by one all right this is it this is what it means it becomes a war we treat it like a war guess what America is not actually at war I know that a lot of folks on the right who want to say that we're at civil war there is an ideological battle that is going on and it is meaningful and it is deep but it is not the conversation that we are having today the conversation we're having today is how angry are you at X and X invariably something stupid and something small and something petty and something worthless there are real societal issues that require us to have real societal discussions that cannot be happening that it's not going to happen if all we worry about today is winning that winning this particular Battle of the headlines and that's not to say again that we don't fight that battle of the headlines but we fight it in good faith in good spirits we fight it with a smile on our face we don't fight it with this kind of sour outrage and this vicious glee in oh my gosh the other guy got really really really really mad if you don't like it on the left you shouldn't like it on the right and I promise you you don't like it on the left and when you see people on the Left who are penalty suggesting that the presidents in the pocket of the Russians you're angry aren't you you should be angry because that's unbaked they don't actually have evidence for that and they're doing this to win the headline of the day how many people on the left honestly believe that the presidents of the United States is in the pay of the Russians and that we're being run by Russia how many people actually believe that and how many people believe that because our tribal need to own the other is is too strong how many people actually believe that folks on the right are truly deeply evil they don't believe it about members of their own family they don't believe it about people they know on the other side of the aisle they just believe that this sort of other that's out there is truly terrible and social media exacerbates this because you get to hide behind your computer screen all day you get to hide behind your phone screen you get to pretend that you're somebody that you're not you say things to people on Twitter that you'd never say to anybody in real life louis c.k the the comic who no longer gets to work louis c.k has a very funny routine about how people are in their cars when we suggest is that you scream things at people in your car that you would never say to them in an elevator and if you're in a car and somebody cuts you off in traffic you will curse a blue streak you'll say things like I hope you die or as if you're in an elevator and somebody brushed up next to you wouldn't turn to that person right in your physical I hope you die right you just wouldn't do that social media does that to people because you feel a certain level of disconnect you can always turn off the social media and it goes away but here's the thing the problems that creates in the country do not go away and that's why nikki Haley is right we ought to be operating in good faith and we ought to be a lot less focused on troller e and a lot more focused on solving substantive issues now speaking of substantive issues I want to talk about a substantive issue that very few people are going to talk about today and that is that the New York Times has a long piece about childless women and men this is a substantive issue because there are just too many people in American society who are not having children I know I'm popular viewpoint with the left this is a true thing I'm going to say that is going to trigger the webs by virtue of it being true Americans are not having enough children we're not having enough children to support our giant social welfare state we're also not having enough children just generally because we're replacing ourselves at barely replacement rates Europe is dying Europe is falling apart the reason Europe is reliant on mass immigration from the Middle East is because they don't have enough people to actually do the jobs the United States is falling into the same trap why because people have found meaning not in what is the future hold and building a better future but in this sort of self-obsession how can I live a more satisfying personal life so the New York Times is this fawning article about a bunch of old people who don't have kids now you might think that that's sad a bunch of old people who don't have kids there are kids to visit them that have grandkids to visit them and in fact there's a picture leading this piece of for old people sitting on a bench looking out into the ocean right which is really depressing just in it's sort of context where you put a child in that photo and suddenly it's charming but without a child just looks like a bunch of old people that are soon gonna turn into tombstones that's essentially what it looks like and here's what the article says the vast majority of American women have children yet fewer women are deciding to become mothers the fertility rate is at a record low when we ask people who don't plan to have children about the reasons for an article in the upshot the top answers or the desire for more leisure time the need to find a partner and the inability to afford child care many women said motherhood had become more of a choice and they were choosing to forego it whether for whether for personal or economic reasons in response to that article and related one about a woman who was happily child free we heard from many older childless women and some older childless men reflecting on their lives without children many celebrated their decision some wondered what might have been others said they had moved from feeling heartbroken to feeling grateful okay now let's just face a basic fact about humanity okay a basic fact about humanity you will always justify the decisions you made it's very rare to find human beings who look at the decisions they've made in their life and said you know what really botched that one that was a mistake I think the first step toward becoming a better human being and saying I made a mistake and maybe I can do better but people have a real stake in doubling down on the stuff that they've already done but here are some of the comments Joanne from Georgia she is 62 over my life of 62 years I've gone from being heartbroken to relieved to proud that I never had children why would you be proud that you never had children what sort of what sort of contribution to society have you made by not generating a second generation that's one thing if you obviously can't have children few have said that sort of trouble but to choose not to have children is an inherently selfish act again this is very controversial proposition in today's day and age the reason it is a selfish act is because you are you are voluntarily disconnecting yourself from the future of the human species you no longer have a stake in what happens next the world stops turning the moment you die once you have kids you start realizing that your decisions mean something more nothing changes human beings more than having children nothing makes you wreaths the decisions that you've made in your life more than having children and deciding what to pass on to those kids nothing makes you care more about building a better society than having children nothing makes you more protective of the things that we have that are good than having children and when you sacrifice all that because hey I had a good time and my kids weren't a pain in the ass at least said enough to deal with with little Timmy's drug problem when he was 16 yes having kids is a risk but it's that risk that not only makes life worth living it makes civilization worth preserving hey Carson from from River Heights he's 66 she's 66 she says I'm a 66 year old woman who chose not to have children and I've never regretted it for a minute friends lovers professional colleagues siblings nieces and nephews neighbors and other people can be constants in a person's life too right that means that you are basically mooching off of someone else's kids implying that women who don't have children are doomed to loneliness as ignorant no it's not by poll data it is certainly not ignorant the vast majority of women want to have kids and they want to have kids for a reason and just because human beings have an enormous capacity for self-deception and may want to suggest to themselves that everything is hunky-dory when they're 60 years old living at home with no one else there you know in a house by themselves with no kids yeah good luck with that good luck with that and then the fact that New York Times is pushing this is pretty telling retired and loved it from the Oregon coast I'm retired woman 66 he never had children I went to college on the GI Bill dan always works a white-collar job women like me were considered oddities when I was in my 20s and through and through my 40s instead of having kids I spend time traveling owning my own home and doing very fulfilling volunteer work I was fortunate to be able to retire at 65 I've never rented being travelers this is fine the real question is why is the New York Times actually pushing this and the answer is because the New York Times believes that this inherently self-absorbed culture is something good for the country this is something we need to talk about how do we instill a culture of purpose and meaning again in people that they want to contribute to the next generation and that they actually want to be part of the great chain of history that leads backward toward a time when people did not live in prosperity and decency with with safety for their children toward a time when people will live in ever-increasing prosperity and decency with a sense of meaning for their kids those are the conversations we need to be having and that's not going to be happening if we are so focused on the triggering of the Libs okay all that stuff's just not that important okay time forward things I like and then some things that I hate so things I like tennis I've been doing jazz all week which is to say yesterday we're doing another piece of jazz today Ella Fitzgerald of course one of the great jazz singers of all time so my grandfather guy would call Papa he he was a jazz drummer so my dad is Janice pianist my grandfather was a jazz drummer sort of in his spare time and he used to go down to a club where Ella Fitzgerald would sing and he would bring her corned beef sandwiches right before she would perform actually and an Ella Fitzgerald is considered by many probably most to be the greatest jazz singer who ever lived at least on the female side of the ow here is a here's Ella Fitzgerald is from her album Ella in Hollywood I've got the world on a string what a world the biggest problem with playing Ella Fitzgerald is you don't actually want to stop playing Ella Fitzgerald she's just terrific first-rate first-rate musician and beautiful voice yeah she's just great okay now let's go to a bunch of stuff that I hate because now I'm in a good mood I got to put myself back in a bad mood as you know I have a rule on the show I cannot end the show none of the mood so let's do some things that I hate so we begin with the story of a Texas waiter this Texas waiter decided that he was going to tell everyone that there is a racist message on a receipt okay this guy his name is Khalil Cavill a 20 year old server for salt grass steakhouse in Odessa and he claimed in a post on Facebook that a customer had left a racist note on a receipt the post along with a photo of the receipt quickly went viral it said we don't tip terrorists cavil claimed the message had left him sick to his stomach he said the experience tested his faith but then he added that he wanted to let it inspire him to change the world okay now I will give you three guesses as to whether this receipt was fake oh you got it on the first try okay here is a basic rule of thumb whenever anybody posts a receipt it's fake yeah unless did somebody giving a giant tip okay if it's something bad that somebody wrote under-seat no one writes nasty things on receipts as a general rule do you know anyone who's ever done that I never have okay I like really the nastiest thing that I've ever done to any sort of waiter or waitress is under tip them if the service was really really poor this is my grandfather's thing also when he wasn't bringing in corned beef sandwiches to to Ella Fitzgerald if so if the service is really poor and he thought the waitress juror could leave them with a nickel tip just to just to show them up I don't actually do that I might end to over tip because these people are working really really hard but it's amazing how the entire media will fall for these stories time after time oh my gosh we don't know who did it but somebody wrote on the bottom of receipt we don't tip terrorists do we have any verification nodes we know who didn't know but we know that the receipt is real how do we know the receipt is real because right because America's racist that's the answer the answer is because they think America's racist and therefore the tip the the receipt has to be real once again this receipt was not in fact real it's just a bunch of stupid okay other things that I hate so this is a crazy story so there's a a shooting in Florida a guy named Michael dredge gunned down Marquis McLaughlin his 28 year old father of three McLaughlin is black Jessica is white and there is some video that was shown on Good Morning America it's kind of disturbing so if you don't want to see it then then don't watch but basically what the video is going to show is that this guide rezku walked out to a car and he apparently started berating McLaughlin's girlfriend outside the store he yelled at her for parking in the handicapped space without a permit so he was the the do-gooder who was going to virtue signal by telling these people to get out of the handicap spot and instead of just walking by and saying you know miss do you mind moving this or in a handicap spot first of all their spaces open in the parking lot like it's in the video so it's bad to park in a handicap spot but it does not justify what happens next Michael dredge qey tells this lady to get out of the handicap spot and then it turns into a shouting match her boyfriend comes he out of the store and it appears that this guy's yelling at his girlfriend and so he pushes the guy down and then what happens next is that the guy pulls out a gun and points it at the at the guy who just pushed him down and the the person who pushed him down McLaughlin he starts to back off a little bit and then Drago shoots the guy in the chest and kills him so here's what here's what the video looks like it's really disturbing was sitting in her boyfriend's idling car when she says 47 year-old Michael dredge chica approached to tell her that she illegally parked in a handicapped spot you can see McLaughlin the store he sees and hears the argument runs over and pushes dredge go to the ground but that's when the irreversible happens dredge qey takes out a gun and shoots McLaughlin McLaughlin holding his chest runs back into the store Jacobs and the children watching from the car he collapsed in front of my son and within 30 minutes he was gone okay now this is not now the reason that's nuts is because they decided not to charge the shooter and they decided not to charge the guy the reason they decided not to charge the guy is because they invoked the Florida Stand Your Ground law that is crazy okay the stay on your ground law does not say that you get to shoot anybody who pushes you down on the floor now if he'd taken out the gun and threatened the guy with it the guy backed off and then he'd call the police or something then we're not talking about the same thing he shot a guy to death after being pushed to the ground the standard ground law does not actually say that and this is the that's a little bit crazy is the fact that the police decided not to charge him based on this Mis invocation of the standard grandma standard ground law there has to be a deadly threat to you and then you are allowed to stand your ground now the media routinely mist-covered the standard ground law so they said that for example in the Trayvon Martin case stand your ground was was implicated stand your ground was not implicated in the Trayvon Martin case because Trayvon Martin was was shot in self-defense according to the jury by George Zimmerman he was having his head pounded against the ground by according to witness testimony and forensic evidence but that the standard ground law actually was never actually invoked by the defense in that case in this case for the police to invoke stand your ground to say that it's okay for this guy to shoot this other guy who's basically backing away when he pulls the gun is just crazy and demonstrates how the police sometimes get it wrong I do not understand the logic behind this and and I'm having some trouble understanding it frankly okay so that brings us to the end of our show we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest hopefully we won't be in a full-fledged rage what with trade war by the time that happens but we'll find out i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya Villarreal
