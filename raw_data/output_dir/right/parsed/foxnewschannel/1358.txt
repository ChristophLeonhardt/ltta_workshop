THANK YOU.
>> Melissa: JUST ONE YEAR INTO
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM.
ONE REPUBLICAN IS LOOKING AT
2020 AS A CHANCE TO POSSIBLY
RUN AGAINST HIM.
RETIRING ARIZONA SENATOR JEFF
FLAKE SAYING HE IS
CONTEMPLATING ENTERING THE RACE.
ADDING THAT HE HOPES PRESIDENT
TRUMP FACES A CHALLENGER OR TWO
IN THE GOP PRIMARIES.
>> NOT IN MY PLANS BUT I HAVE
NOT RULED ANYTHING OUT.
I DO HOPE THAT SOMEBODY RUNS ON
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OTHER THAN
THE PRESIDENT.
IF NOTHING ELSE, SIMPLY TO
REMIND REPUBLICANS WHAT
CONSERVATIVEISM IS AND WHAT
STOOD FOR.
>> Melissa: LET'S BRING IN OUR
PANEL.
BRAD BLAKEMAN AND DAVE BROWN.
THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR
JOINING US.
DAVE, LET ME START WITH YOU.
WHAT I FIND SOMEWHAT AMUSING
ABOUT THIS IS THAT JEFF FLAKE
HAS VOTED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
84% OF THE TIME.
SO I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE IS OPPOSING.
>> I THINK IT'S A GREAT POINT.
UNDERSCORES THE SENATOR FLAKE
HAS BEEN ALL TALK BUT REALLY NO
ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO
OPPOSING THE PRESIDENT.
HE STILL IS A SITTING UNITED
STATES SENATOR.
IF HE WANTED TO GRIND THE
SENATE TO A HALT DAY AFTER DAY
TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
AGENDA HE COULD DO THAT.
INSTEAD HE HAS CHOSEN TO
SUPPORT ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES NO
MATTER HOW UNQUALIFIED AND
FAILED TO STAND UP TO THE
PRESIDENT ON IMMIGRATION AND HE
GIVES A REALLY GOOD SPEECH BUT
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY
SENATOR FLAKE NEEDS TO TAKE
ACTION.
HE HAS FAILED TO DO THAT.
>> Melissa: BRAD, WHAT I FIND
AMUSING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE IS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS
I GUESS CLEVER GAME TO POKE THE
BEAR, TO SET OFF AND DO
ANYTHING YOU CAN TO TRY TO EN
FLAME PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HOPE
HE RESPONDS ON TWITTER OR HOPE
HE CALLS YOU OUT BY NAME AND
USE THAT TO GET YOURSELF
ATTENTION.
WE SEE IT FROM POLITICIANS,
FROM PEOPLE WRITING BOOKS, WE
SEE IT FROM COMEDIANS.
IT SEEMS TO WORK SPECTACULARLY
FOR GETTING YOURSELF ATTENTION.
IS THAT KIND OF WHAT JEFF FLAKE
IS DOING HERE DO YOU THINK?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THE PRESIDENT ISN'T TAKING
THE BAIT.
AS DAVE PROPERLY POINTED OUT,
HOW DO YOU GO AGAINST A
PRESIDENT WHEN YOU VOTED FOR
HIM 84% OF THE TIME?
HIS POLICIES YOU SUPPORT.
YOUR PLATFORM IS GEE, HE IS NOT
A NICE GUY.
NICE GUYS FINISH LAST AND JEFF
FLAKE MAY BE A NICE GUY BUT HE
WON'T GO ANYWHERE AGAINST AN
INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LIKE
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAS A
RECORD TO RUN ON.
A RECORD THAT SENATOR FLAKE
SUPPORTS.
>> Melissa: DAVE, WHO DO YOU
THINK WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE
PERSON TO STAND UP AGAINST
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS YOU PUT IT?
YOU SAY SOMEBODY HAS TO STAND
UP AGAINST HIM.
THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS THAT
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE
THEY SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.
BUT WHO IN YOUR MIND COULD
MOUNT AN EFFECTIVE CHALLENGE?
>> SURE, LET ME SAY I SINCERELY
HOPE SENATOR FLAKE DOES RUN.
I SUSPECT ALL DEMOCRATS WOULD
BE PLEASED TO SEE A CROWDED
REPUBLICAN FIELD IN 2020.
BUT FOR SOMEONE TO BE EFFECTIVE
AT COMPETING WITH THIS
PRESIDENT, YOU CAN SIT BACK AND
SEND A TWEET AND CAPTURE AND
EARN A MEDIA NEWS CYCLE WILL
HAVE TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS
CHARISMATIC AND SELF-FUND.
I IMAGINE REPUBLICAN DONORS
WON'T BE SUPER SUPPORTIVE OF A
POTENTIAL SPOILER IN THE RACE.
>> Melissa: THERE IS A LOT OF
NEVER TRUMPERS OUT THERE AND
THEY RAISED MONEY THAT TIME.
DO YOU SEE THAT PERSON, DAVE?
ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT COULD BE
EFFECTIVE?
>> AT THIS POINT I KNOW
GOVERNOR KASICH EXPRESSED
INTEREST.
WE SAW HOW WELL HE DID LAST
CYCLE.
SENATOR RUBIO IF HE GROWS A
BACKBONE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
HIM GO INTO THE RACE.
>> Melissa: IS THERE ANYONE TON
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT CAN
POSE A THREAT?
>> NO.
BECAUSE HE HAS A RECORD.
I'M TALKING ABOUT STYLISTICALLY
BUT YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
SUCCESS.
IF I WAS ADVISING THE PRESIDENT
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY MANTRA.
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH A RECORD.
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, HE
IS MAKING INROADS IN FOREIGN
POLICY THAT PEOPLE HAVE THROWN
THEIR HANDS UP FOR DECADES AND
SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN NORTH
KOREA AND IRAN.
HE IS HAVING IT WITH GREAT
SUCCESS.
I DON'T SEE ANY REPUBLICAN
HAVING THE WHEREWITHAL BOTH
FINANCIALLY AND IDEOLOGICALLY
TO CHALLENGE THIS PRESIDENT.
>> Melissa: DAVE, I'VE HEARD
DEMOCRATS SAY THE EXACT SAME
THING.
THAT'S THEIR CONCERN.
THAT YOU MAY HATE HIS STYLE BUT
HE HAS A LOT TO POINT TO IN
TERMS OF RESULTS.
>> I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY
DISAGREE WITH THAT.
HE IS VERY GOOD AT BEING
BOMBASTIC.
HE ANNOUNCED HASTILY THE NORTH
KOREAN SUMMIT BEFORE HE
CANCELED THE SUMMIT.
>> Melissa: LOOK WHERE THEY ARE
NOW.
THAT LOOKS LIKE A SMART MOVE.
HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE
AND GOT EVERYBODY SNAPPING
RIGHT BACK ON HIS TERMS.
>> EVEN A SMART MOVE OR THIS
NEW CYCLE AND SOMETHING ELSE
WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW?
ANYBODY WHO READ THAT BOOK THAT
HE HAD GHOST WRITTEN FOR HIM
THE ART OF THE DEAL KNOWS HE
THRIVES ON BEING UNPREDICTABLE
AND THROWING HAND GRENADES.
>> THAT'S A GOOD THING.
>> WE'RE COMPLETELY ALIENATED
FROM OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE ABOUT
IRAN.
>> IT'S LEADERSHIP.
>> WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY.
>> SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO IT
ALONE STANDING ON PRINCIPLES.
>> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
THE DETAILS.
YOU KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BUSH,
LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, MUCH MORE
METHODICAL AND STRATEGIC IN HOW
THEY ENGAGED.
>> CAN'T ARGUE WITH SUCCESS IS
THE POINT.
>> Melissa: ISN'T THAT THE
POINT?
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY WHO HAVE
WALKED THIS ROAD AHEAD OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WERE IN THE
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN AND
THEY DID IT THE TRADITIONAL WAY
AND NOW MANY AMERICANS WANT TO
SEE SOMEONE JUST TRY SOMETHING
ELSE.
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY.
DOING IT THE SAME WAY OVER AND
OVER AGAIN TO THE SAME BRAD
RESULT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SOMETIMES IT'S A SHAME THAT
YOUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES DON'T
SEE IT BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTING
IN THEIR OWN SELFISH INTERESTS
AND YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO
COMES IN AND CHANGES THE
DYNAMIC.
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING
SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENTS
SHOULD BE DOING ALL ALONG.
ACTING IN OUR INTEREST FIRST.
