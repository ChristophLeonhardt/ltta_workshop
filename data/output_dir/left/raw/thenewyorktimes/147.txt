1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,530
To see what democracy
looks like when

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,950
its institutions are under
threat and its very survival

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,640
is in question,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,730
we came to Istanbul.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,060
The streets were
filled with supporters

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,180
of President Erdogan
a who’s been riding

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,160
a wave of popularity
that has kept him

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,310
in power for 15 years.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,120
For a while, he was the face
of a hopeful, modern Islam,

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,940
an outlier in a region torn
by conflict and tyranny.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,590
But over the past
two years, he’s

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,410
killed tens of thousands
of dissidents

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,490
— professors, lawyers, journalists, anyone
he wants — without trial.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,950
Now he’s called snap
elections hoping

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,425
to return to office with
more power than ever before.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,590
His critics fear he’s driving
Turkey towards a dictatorship

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,440
that Turkey will be
synonymous with Erdogan.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,690
Ahmet Cik was one of
Turkey’s most fearless

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,900
investigative journalists.
Then, Erdogan’s government

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,560
jailed him, twice.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,660
He was released in March,

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,550
but he could end
up back in prison.

23
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,490
In the meantime, he decided
to run for an opposition

24
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,870
seat in Parliament.

25
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,140
Erdogan supporters are mainly

26
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,650
pious and conservative
working-class Turks.

27
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,258
They tout him as
their champion.

28
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,810
A kid from one of Istanbul’s
blue-collar neighborhoods,

29
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,795
who thrust Turkey forward and
unleashed a booming economy.

30
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,840
That sense of collective
accomplishment

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,090
It’s lifted Erdogan to become
a symbol of national pride.

32
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,760
Many people here see

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,160
Erdogan as a moderate
advocate of Muslim values

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,890
who managed to push out
the secular elite

35
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,860
that had ignored the country’s
religious majority for decades.

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,350
His party is hosting a sundown meal

37
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,210
for Ramadan in the
streets.

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
Among many reforms,

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Erdogan expanded religion
in school curriculums

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,270
and allowed women to wear
headscarfs in official institutions.

41
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,560
"This is my choice, first of all."

42
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,360
"This is a freedom."

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,330
"They give it to me."

44
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,580
"This is our right to have it."

45
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,734
But for every Turk who
praises Erdogan’s reforms,

46
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,400
There’s one who will
tell you that there

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,420
is a disturbing subtext.

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,210
Dissent is not tolerated.

49
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,040
This is Yaren, a
college freshman

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,360
who is in prison
for two months

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,730
along with 13 other
classmates, for attending

52
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,060
a protest on campus.

53
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,330
Yaren isn't alone.

54
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,020
We visited the newsroom of
Cumhuriyet,

55
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,090
Turkey's oldest newspaper

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,720
and one of the
last independent voices

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,620
in the country.

58
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,940
In recent years,

59
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,600
Erdogan has been 
one of the most prolific

60
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,860
jailers of journalists
in the world.

61
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,779
14 of Cumhuriyet's 
executives and journalists

62
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,899
were convicted of aiding terrorism.

63
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,270
They're out jail now,
now pending appeal.

64
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,039
But they’re back
at work determined

65
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,330
to expose the
government that’s

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,620
been trying to silence them.

67
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,180
As the opposition
tries to defy Erdogan

68
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,550
its greatest
advantage right now

69
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,810
is the sudden downturn
in the economy.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,030
We traveled to Ordu,
a village on the Black Sea

71
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,190
to ask ordinary people
how they’re faring.

72
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,400
More than 20 percent of the
world’s hazelnuts

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,860
shipped from this one
corner of the country.

74
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,660
Muvaffak Aydemir, a
farmer, said the slump is

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,760
leaving him empty-handed.

76
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,270
Later, Muvaffak went to a
Farmers' Union meeting

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,700
to debate who to support
in the upcoming election.

78
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,470
Their frustration,
echoed in small towns

79
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,270
across the country, is
shaking Erdogan's rural base.

80
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,010
To a country at a crossroads,

81
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,570
Erdogan’s message
about the future

82
00:06:03,570 --> 00:00:00,000
sounds either promising
or terrifying.
