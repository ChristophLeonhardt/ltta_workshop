to say 2017 has been an important year for news and world events would be a huge understatement it's been a year filled with consequential stories that have changed and shaped the political landscape around the world from indigenous rights in the Amazon to the Secession battle in Spain's Catalonia region Kenya is not one but two controversial presidential elections and then there's the crisis that hit the Gulf region with a blockade of Qatar the growing refugee crisis stretching from Iraq Libya to Europe and beyond al Jazeera has been there covering at all over the next half an hour we'll look back on some of our most memorable and news making interviews of 2017 I'm Jane dutton welcome to the special edition of talk to Al Jazeera we start in Doha on June the 5th Qatar's Nationals and residents woke up to the news that Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Egypt had all cut off diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar the dispute caused major disruptions to air travelers across the region home to several of the world's major long-haul carriers cata Airways has been impacted by the crisis and has had to adjust its flight path and other operational procedures so what does the future look like for one of the world's leading airlines Qatar Airways chief executive Iqbal bucker talked to Andrew Simmons back in June this is the last thing any CEO of an airline would want to hear that the airspace in which it operates international airspace in which it operates has illegally been blocked we've heard of air wars this transcends everything do you feel that in effect you're under attack in fact Qatar is under attack as we are being affected so our our neighbors who have got into this illegal act in blocking us their national carriers are also getting affected what is also doing is letting the entire regions air connectivity confidence to be lost so they are in the same basket so they should not think that they will be going laughing to the bank was they are putting economic pain on my country individuals have climbed on a tree which is very tall and now to get down from this tree they will be injured my country will persevere this is not a situation that we have taken we have taken a moral high ground because the country has very wise leadership could be a commercial motivation as well as a political one in what's happened actually they want butter to coax them into their sphere of influence they want butter sovereignty to be to be under their control and I don't think state of Qatar will will agree - to relinquish our foreign policy and our sovereignty in hand of anybody this is a wound that has been created for a generation this will never be forgotten I'm not a politician again there are certain of parts of this question should be should be answered by the political assurance of my country but one thing I can tell you regardless if it lasts less or long the wound has already been very deep and people will not forget in the fight against ISIL Iraq has been at the forefront in a bloody military campaign that started in early 2014 Iraqi and Kurdish forces supported by an international coalition fought to rout art ISIL Mosul was the first major city in Iraq the armed group took control of but after two years 20:17 bought the end of ISIL in Mosul and its surrounding villages and people began to return to their homes but what is homecoming like when you find out that ISIL fighters lived in your house we made some returning Iraqis take a look this is or should we say was the town of Bar sheikah Selim and sadhya are a sed couple who fled their home with their children they had heard what ISIL did in Sinjar where scores of people were killed and many women kidnapped raped and enslaved well look at high five you Marchionne handle of Osman Jota hello Elena and has them know yeah elevator hiya how does it make you feel that these fighters were staying in your house yeah sure I just saw it but some zengid una

always known as now and did you find out I fly like you this way I mean nobody back there oh I saw my husband life McCrea up the lad no man so hmm I'll have laughs well slaughter no rat hole one of our most controversial interviews of this past year was the one our correspondent Mohammed vaulted with Uganda's president you wear him a 70 who's been in power for over 31 years he's been elected to office five times but he's been accused of corruption human rights abuse and nepotism let's have a look at Mohamed's interview with the president after five terms you are now 71 or 72 I don't know servant to two in three years you will be you will reach the age limit and you can't run for another term who is there in the country now qualified capable sitting in the wings waiting to be the next leader the people of Uganda are there they will select two who according to the what they're the other leaders are there but to maximize to maximize the leadership input we use all our leaders the young ones the old ones now they want to come about to come forward but alas not about one thing this is the whole problem we are talking about one thing I want salute you wanted it is what the situation demands your own son who is now very high highly elevated in the army and his you're also special advisor on certain issues your wife also is a minister she's sitting next to you in the Cabinet reports that you are preparing one of these two to be the next leader you can do what do you say to this why should I prepare them which is the people you're gonna choose the one they want if I ask the people of Uganda maybe they will say something different because we are reading what the opposition says and what T you can do different from what you read what the opposition says why don't you said it asked me to ask the people that people say something different the people are not the owner the opposition how would you guarantee that in the future in history you won't go down as a dictator instead of a Democratic president dictator who is elected five times that's that must be a wonderful dictator let's hear more from Mohammed Val Mohammed President Museveni doesn't give interviews very often does he what was the reaction like in Uganda after this interview inside Uganda people were divided according to their loyalty to President Museveni or the lack of it those loyal to him they felt insulted and they said this interview shouldn't happen like this they addressed me in their social media messages saying how do you dare ask our president this type of questions so you're not used to see president in seventy being challenged in this manner those who are opposed to Museveni on the other hand celebrated the interview and they said the president has never been put on the spot like this has never been pinned down and grilled in this way and they were very satisfied they sent me private messages to thank me for that interview but what do you think is next for Uganda will there be a regime change or will President Museveni stay in office and for how long it doesn't look this is going to happen anytime soon despite the fact that he's the age limit in the Ugandan Constitution for a president to be able to run again for office in 75 and 170 is now 73 as we speak when the next election comes he will be almost 77 however there is debate now in the Parliament for him to be able to continue to run for office a sixth term if it if it happens so that gives you a science that the man is not about to be willing to leave office thanks Muhammad the Ringo have been called the most persecuted people in the world and their decades-long plea for recognition and Myanmar turned into a desperate battle for survival this year when the military began its violent crackdown in Rakhine State in late August hundreds of thousands of Muslim Ranga fled to neighboring Bangladesh where they've been living in over camps without adequate food or medicine the UN has called it an ethnic cleansing but at the core of this crisis is Myanmar's refusal to recognize its Ranga population as citizens so can the Muslim and Buddhist communities of recurrent State come to an understanding under an sands hoochies leadership talk to Al Jazeera traveled to the centre of the crisis Myanmar was a British colony until independence in 1948 the man considered the father of the nation was Aung San su cheese Father General Aung San he founded an armed group that was later transformed into the nation's army but he was assassinated shortly before independence after an initial period with a parliamentary system the military staged a coup in 1962 and stayed in power until a military leadership gave way to elections in 2010 Aung San su Chi who had led a campaign against the military was elected to Parliament two years later and when her party won a majority in 2015 she was named state chancellor and thereby solidly becoming the leading member of the new government meanwhile the RO hinga throughout this period they were living primarily in the western state of Rakhine but unlike many other ethnic groups and there are hundreds of them they were never considered part of the Myanmar population you say that discrimination and persecution of the younger people in Myanmar has been going on for 50 years do you still have hope that this government of Aung San su Chi will reestablish the citizen rights of the Rohingya people all since Russia issues the Nobel laureate she always talking for the justice so and we believe I think there is some challenges in front of her I think international community should have a gorman to address this issue the government has said that there's a group of extremists of militants were behind the attacks of October 9 and they even call them terrorists with help from abroad do you think that that is true one thing we don't encourage any kind of insurgency we do encourage any kind of terrorism and even all the wrong angle they are peace-loving people they will not encourage these things so we want peace and we want to leave with harmony and now we take you to Catalonia it is a prosperous region in the northeast of Spain but in recent years secessionist sentiments have risen among Catalans Carla's frigimon was the president of the Catalan regional government but he was forced out of his job by the Spanish government for holding a referendum on secession that Spain had ruled was illegal he picked talk to Al Jazeera as the first international news program to discuss explicit details about the referendum this is what he said to her dr.

moment we'll face it there's two quite hard positions on both sides on one side you either what negotiations or we're going ahead with the independent so you're saying on the other hand the Spanish government is not compromising too much at the moment do you think that this could escalate in a dangerous way you think do you think that the Spanish government could use force military for now a police force even if you go with the vote not familiar we say when Ashton Bashar jo not correct absolute chaos turf espanol aspirant NGO delicious your answer sheet nozawa for sophistica this is envy apply this response to vista park animal men colleges la forza physica a pursuit a pert Costanza Toshio the conflict in eastern Ukraine has now been raging for over three years the UN says the

opponents of socialist president Nicolas Maduro took to the streets demanding immediate elections blaming him for acute shortages and the world's highest inflation maduras response was to call for and when a referendum to rewrite the Constitution a move many believe will turn Venezuela into a one-party state like Cuba more than 120 people were killed and thousands arrested during months of unrest as president of the new Constituent Assembly dasu Rodriguez is arguably the most powerful person in Venezuela today the Assembly has the power to override and even replace the president at what may have been been as well as most critical our she talked to Al Jazeera's Lucia Neuman you said the other day and I was very surprised and so with the Venezuelans that were near me that there is no hunger in Venezuela but yet I see people and so I'm sure have you in your neighborhood picking through the rubbish Emilia communication and I run a persona que está buscando comida novice ooh pero por

dictatorship Venezuela viv un proceso de democracia participative oh yes a democracy participative ax C a victory force' con la elección assembly honest you know a constituent a what about all the opposition people who were unarmed who were killed many times by the National Guardsman at point-blank range estimate entiendo lo caso de toda la víctima y mo dijo que a gente del estado que actual Yolanda los reg lamento soory lament OD equation y ou yang kau Sol una muerte Venezuela c'est le seguirá un proceso Yahoo tiene su casa let's go now - Lucia neumann and Santiago Chile you see how is the food situation right now is there still a shortage Jane there is a desperate shortage of food and also of medicine even the most basic medicine that people need just to keep alive but it's not just a matter of not finding these things it's being able to afford it people cannot afford to eat any longer because of the inflation rate in Venezuela which is going up day by day in fact by the end of this year we'll reached at least 1,000% which is difficult to imagine and according to the International Monetary Fund in 2018 it should surpass two thousand three hundred percent that is called hyperinflation that is sending tens of thousands of Venezuelans across the border into Colombia to try to find food but it is also increasing infant mortality there is massive malnutrition not just amongst children and bitten in newborns but also mothers and so maternal mortality has now soared and it was once the lowest in the region now it is probably the highest in all of South America what about the people who've been killed are there any of those cases on trial has anyone been held accountable for the killings of people in theory the authorities have investigated charges of abuse of power on the part of the security forces I know of at least two cases where a policeman and a National Guardsman were arrested after they were filmed shooting at point-blank - protesters who were killed one of them with a tear gas canister this video went viral it forced the authorities to arrest them but as far as I know and certainly according to their relatives these people have not been tried and certainly have not been convicted thank you very much indeed listen to Carter's former governor known as a hawk was sentenced to two years in prison earlier this year he was charged and convicted of blasphemy over comments he made about a qur'anic verse and the court case against the Indonesian capitals first Christian and ethnic Chinese governor since the 1960s was brought forward by several conservative Islamic groups a hawk talked to Al Jazeera step vasan back in January before his verdict was announced she spoke to him about his legal battle and what it means for country with the world's biggest Muslim population now you're on trial for a blasphemy and you're facing five years in prison do you think it's fair to use the blasphemy law in this context against you gammy Massimo yes Harris pop ya ibadi saya in Edessa java cuando bang sorry me Bhagawan bang bang cyanea despondency Pancasila de no no no Rema thermos entire in a be- Iike yes a bozo Cucaracha Jaromir Isaiah until the position Sephardi Hirini dinosaur and I hope some more runners mah rethinking about pancasila reinventing banda Zilla and Emin re can I'm open jaws here the burgundy India Lobby stepheson joins us now from Jakarta step what is the latest with a hug he's still in jail but where does his case stand yes Jane Hawk is still serving his prison term soon after his verdict was handed down in May two years in prison he decided not to appeal this verdict because he said he didn't want to create more controversy in society as you remember his case and also his controversial remarks about this Quranic verse led to huge protests here in the Indonesian capital one of the largest protests in Indonesian modern history and also his supporters went to the streets trying to defend him Amnesty International has called a hawk a prisoner of conscience and has asked for his immediate release but as things are looking now because also the prosecutor didn't appeal the verdict it looks like a hawk will be released somewhere in 2019 he will probably get some deductions for good behavior he's basically spending his time reading a lot he's reading a lot of religious books the Koran and also the Bible he's learning local languages and he's receiving a lot of visitors in prison and he's still quite popular here among some groups here in Jakarta at the moment do you think a hoax political careers over what's next for him well no his political career is not necessarily over he will be released in 2019 which is a very important political year here in Indonesia it will be the next presidential election and before this whole case happened and before he went to jail a hawk even hinted at joining these this race for the presidency and that seems of course quite unlikely right now but he can still run for public office in Indonesia the law says that anyone who has been in prison for less than five years can actually run for any year public office and it's very likely that a hawk will still have these ambitions he was a very very passionate governor and he's a very passionate bureaucrat but the big question of course will be how controversial will the former governor be when he comes out of prison will he still be as controversial as he is today or will his present term and also his his activities in prison will gain his popularity will this turn him into some kind of hero this can only of course be answered by the time he will be released thanks Ted that's it for us a big thanks to you our audience for watching we hope you'll join us on talk to Al Jazeera in 2018 I'm Jane dutton goodbye you
