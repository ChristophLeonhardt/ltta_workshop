00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,769
were you hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get what did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hope</font>

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,530
to achieve well a couple of things one

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,480
I've said that I know these documents

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,400
exist so that gives a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of the</font>

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">story quite realistically and</font>

9
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:21,900
realistically I wasn't expecting much

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,869
other than the globe our defense but I

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,789
was pleasantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised in this</font>

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,670
particular document to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,740
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proof even like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an read these</font>

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,130
blank pages of how high up this case

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,950
went all the way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2030 there are</font>

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,469
emails and here right up to that time so

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,899
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of the story come</font>

18
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">together I guess when you do file a</font>

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,260
Freedom of Information<font color="#E5E5E5"> Act what's clever</font>

20
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">glomar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you can neither confirm</font>

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,050
nor deny so the government neither

22
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,270
confirms not nor denies that this

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,800
rendition took place what other

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,480
documents do you think are out there

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,309
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be telling for your case</font>

26
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're helpful what's interesting here</font>

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,750
is not just events<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading up to the</font>

28
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,150
rendition but more importantly as of

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,760
becoming the more I think about it more

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,330
importantly is the aftermath the process

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,509
by which the government goes full you

32
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,229
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the entire might to make sure</font>

33
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,810
that nothing is ever released so what

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,270
they gave you here is not much are there

35
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,850
other things that exist out there that

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,009
you know yes there are lots that exists

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">others some I know about because I've</font>

38
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,970
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> them myself right which is why I'm</font>

39
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,460
using FOIA to try and get that

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,009
information as opposed to just leaking

41
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,780
it to the press or token to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the press</font>

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,259
about it and that's again when I filed

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,509
the FOIA request everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

44
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,009
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for um I know exists through</font>

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,380
either conversations emails are their

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,100
internal CIA documents that say like

47
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,689
Sabrina de<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sousa was only part of the</font>

48
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">initial planning stage and then the</font>

49
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,070
rendition team came<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

50
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,120
involved does it is not really

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,479
I mean oh that actually does it does I

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,360
just remembered so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hayden so Jose</font>

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,460
Rodriguez who was the chief of the

54

IG John<font color="#CCCCCC"> helgerson the inspector general</font>

56
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,500
of the CIA wanted to investigate the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Milan rendition as soon as it broken to</font>

58
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,720

<font color="#E5E5E5">Jose Rodriguez the head of the national</font>

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,270
clandestine service said no we will

61
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,340
investigate things ourselves and he

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,200
asked general Hayden to appoint his own

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,500
person to do an accountability Review so

64
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,580
they established this accountability

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,180
Review Board and then that was completed

66
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> call they invited whoever wanted to</font>

67

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,350

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,060
to take a look at this document and I

70
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,950
was told no you can't see the document

71
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,660
because you were not involved

72
00:03:03,700 --> 00:00:00,000
