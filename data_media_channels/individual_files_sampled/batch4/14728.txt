you've heard A Tale of Two Cities but have you heard the tale of three mascots this is California State University Long Beach's perspective Pete mascot meant to resemble a miner from the California Gold Rush here's Louisiana State University's Mike the tiger mascot and finally we have the University of Utah UT mascot they actually use a bird on the field but it's still representative of the Native American ute tribe so what do all three of these mascots have in common well they're all apparently offensive let's check it out so last Thursday students at Cal State Long Beach found themselves well mascot lists Jane Connelly the school's president said as our diversity grew and more voices were heard we came to know that the 18-49 California Gold Rush was a time in history when the indigenous peoples of California endured subjugation violence and threats of genocide today the spirit of inclusivity is reflected in our students faculty staff alumni and community that's gone so what next must the San Francisco 49ers football team also be trashed in the name of inclusivity and here's the strangest part of this story some students and faculty are apparently urging Cali State Long Beach not to model their next mascot on a person or group to prevent offending others or participating in that dreaded cultural appropriation so that pretty much only leaves animals right and can we even use animals if they can't give informed consent just asking questions folks speaking of animals a petition for Louisiana State University to drop its live Mike the tiger mascot has reached around a hundred thousand signatures many from people who might don't think I've been to Louisiana much less even the country the petition demands the school release Mike and says while the university has made efforts to improve the quality of the tigers enclosure increasing its size and adding a variety of outdoor activities it is cruel to sentence a tiger to such captivity and are not here for our amusement captivity this is kind of like calling the Garden of Eden a prison just because you can't roam earth hell or purgatory as Joshua Tucker the LSU College Republicans Chairman points out mike has a huge fan base that nearly worships him top of the line medical care and a staff that serves at his beck and call a multi-million dollar habitat that has room for him to run and play and even a large swimming pool for him to swim in I want a pool I mean if this is animal cruelty sign me up the university also pointed out that the four most recent mics were donated to the school from rescue shelters but when it comes to appeasing the social justice God's no good deed goes unpunished good deeds like you know honoring the Native American ute tribe by adopting it as your team name the University of Utah has done just that and was prepared to face off against Washington State University for football when the latter school sent out this rather mystifying statement homecoming teams must only refer to our opponent as Utah or the University of Utah and any use of the word youths during homecoming events will result in a penalty Wow that's just a bit overbearing wouldn't you say this is of course despite the University of Utah adopting the ute with the consent of the ute tribe this really is looking like another case of the Redskins where white liberals get offended on behalf of natives ninety percent of whom are honored by the mascot or simply couldn't care less for campus unmasked I'm Rob simcha if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mast comm
