Neil: ON THIS, THE SENATE IS MOVING FAST. THIS IS THE VETERANS CHOICE PROGRAM. YOU MIGHT RECALL WE HAVE SCOTT DAVIS WITH US SAYING THAT WAIT TIMES ARE STILL THE SAME, THINGS HAVEN'T IMPROVED. COMPLIMENTED THE PRESIDENT THAT HE MEANS WELL BUT JUST ISN'T HAPPENING. WE HAVE A NEW ACTING DIRECTOR. THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO MAKE THE PERMANENT DIRECTOR. THIS CHOICE PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW VETERANS THAT IF YOU GO TO A VETERAN HOSPITAL, THEY CAN'T MAKE APPOINTMENTS FOR MONTHS, YEARS TO COME, THEY CAN JUST TAKE A PIECE OF PAPER, GO TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL AND GETS TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT AWAY. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED HEADLINE.
