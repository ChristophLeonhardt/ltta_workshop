we have breaking news with the release of the monthly jobs report CNBC's Dominic Chu joins us now and Dom when we were expecting 200,000 new jobs where over 300,000 unemployment stays at four point one percent what does it mean for the markets what does it mean for the economy well it means that we have a better than expected jobs report Joe meek and what you're seeing in the marketplace right now is a stock market that's reacting at least for the time being positively like you said that three hundred and thirteen thousand jobs created headline number is getting a lot of attention the unemployment rate does stay steady at four point one percent one other employment measure that some people like to look at is something called the u6 with the Bureau of Labor Statistics it's jargon for the underemployment rate that the true unemployment rate some people look at it as it stays unchanged at eight point two percent one of the big headlines that a lot of people are going to focus on especially in Washington DC is the labor force participation rate that actually went higher meaning that more Americans are actually out there looking for jobs not considered structurally unemployed giving up on looking for a job they've actually entered their workforce again so that's set that's a pretty decent sign there I would also note that the job growth where the jobs are came from a few pretty specific locations when it comes to construction we saw 61 thousand jobs created there retail and then professional services each added 50,000 jobs and even manufacturing added 31,000 you take all those together along with some numbers with regard to average hourly earnings they came in less than expected so more people are working but they're not making nearly as much money as people thought they were going to it leads to what some call on Wall Street a Goldilocks scenario where the economy is getting more people involved in the workplace but you don't have fears that inflation or rising prices is really going to drive things at least for the time being for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates so that's the reason why you're seeing a lot of green on the board guys alrighty VC's dominic - thank you so much it's really appreciated those are the best numbers for new jobs in a year-and-a-half you'd expect the unemployment rate to go down but it didn't go down because actually the job participation rate crept up to 63% we'll say the unemployment rate is the most meaningless number because this was a month of good news really good means that more people are going out looking for jobs really good news that we had new jobs my only communist you know heaven forbid for the markets that people would make more money heaven did that that would be a horrible thing all right we will be back in three minutes with more morning job thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more four Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
