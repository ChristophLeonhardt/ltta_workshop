the country last month South Africans laid to rest one of their iconic anti-apartheid leaders Winnie Madikizela Mandela for all those years that her husband Nelson Mandela was imprisoned mama Winnie as she was known moved to the front line in the fight against white minority rule earning the respect of her people and the ire of the apartheid era government which is why in the days after her death many South Africans took exception to the way her obituaries read how she had been reduced to the former wife of a president who played a bit part in the struggle or was caricatured as an angry vengeful woman who had lost her way then just days before her funeral a documentary aired in the country that showed how the apartheid government with the help of the white owned news media had smeared Madikizela Mandela with deceptions and lies that made it into those obits that documentary changed things the listening-posts Nick Muirhead now on Winnie Madikizela Mandela her life death and partial rehabilitation in the media ex-wife of the late president Nelson Mandela Winnie Madikizela eterna she was a powerful when youth broke off when he met the COS element Ellis death and the obits started coming out it scene became clear that some news outlets hadn't done their homework from the mother of the nation to a tarnished reputation beautiful brave also brutal Madiga Salem and Ayla and like her husband became the evil that she condemned because the role of the person many considered a Titan of the anti-apartheid struggle was being diminished the obits were flat they just didn't have the kind of work that should have been done for this individual and you had one editor referred to her as damaged goods in international media reports you had voices referring to her as the mother then my go of the nation in the New York Times said that her legacy in apartheid as a liberator was overshadowed by scandal you had the BBC wearing her as Mandela's wife that was all that she was diminished you just his wife and you have this backlash this groundswell from the public which says that is not the only Winnie Mandela who existed and so you see this remarkable shift in the narrative especially local media covering her now in a much more respectful way to understand why so many South Africans objected to the portrayal of mataji's element Ella in the days after her death it helps to look at her life in 1964 she and her two young children watched as her husband Nelson Mandela was sentenced to life in prison the apartheid government outlawed the African National Congress the ANC and prohibited journalists from covering the party in any way that supposedly advanced its so-called terrorist agenda the struggle for liberation that had been gaining momentum was dealt a severe blow in the midst of this there was one person Winnie Mandela who seemed to live without fear who spoke art we spoke on behalf of the banned organization who spoke on behalf of her husband and was a very powerful image and figure so she kept that voice alive but she also develops quite an important relationship with people in the grassroots and so in some ways if an international or domestic media is interested in understanding the feeling of the people they do so through the lens of a Winnie Mandela as such a visible leader of the resistance Madikizela Mandela needed to be silenced for two decades the apartheid government harassed her shuttled her in and out of prison held her in solitary confinement reportedly tortured and demeaned her and eventually in 1977 banished her to remote part of the country eight years later Winnie Madikizela Mandela defied the government and returned to the media spotlight this time the world saw a different side to her with ratcheted up rhetoric and new militancy many saw that as an endorsement of necklacing a beautiful form of execution predominantly in black communities where suspected police informants had tires filled with petrol placed around their necks that were then set alight the apartheid government and its media apparatus looked at the pneumatic izella Mandela and her personal bodyguards and enforcers who operated under the name of the Mandela United Football Club and saw an opportunity the government who pretended like it was you know conducting this this war by parliamentary rules when in fact it was conducting a dirty war and when he Mandela's attitude was we should respond you know fire with fire the agency actually said by the late nineteen eighties make the country on government people would burn things with protests and so Winnie Mandela became sort of the the personification of that kind of politics and so there were excesses the government can exploit those excesses I was co-editor of the week email and this story started to emerge in particular we had one or two young reporters who came and said and there's an issue there's a problem there's increasing complaints about the behavior of this football cap the question for us was how to cover it because the security police and the apartheid state would be eager to use any information and controversy to damage the liberation movement by the late 1980s it emerged that the apartheid government had created a covert unit called Stratcom that specialized in spreading misinformation and propaganda against opponents of the state as many as 40 journalists were involved from multiple news organizations and among the anti-apartheid leaders they targeted Winnie Madikizela Mandela in 1989 Stratcom got a story it could work with a young boy named stomp ISA Pere was accused of being a police informant he was kidnapped tortured and then murdered by members of the Mandela United Football Club when arrested they said that the order had come from Mataji Salem and Ella and Marcia is never convicted of any involvement in the murder only in the kidnapping of cepe the story was explosive enough for Stratcom through its media network to start turning black South Africans against her it becomes the single story about Winnie Mandela and so here is where I think the media both domestically and internationally it begins to see Winnie Mandela only as a caricature and only as the woman who had something to do with the stomp ISA came at her in fact she was convicted of kidnapping him and her reasons for that kidnap where that she was taking him to a place of safety a lot of people started to turn against her they were graffitis on walls saying we must hang and give us Nelson Mandela back take Winnie to Robben Island and so that was the effect of that coverage on Winnie Madikizela Mandela she she was completely denied by her own people I think she for all intents and purposes disappears and becomes something of a bit of a pariah and post apartheid South Africa she doesn't live on TV in the papers in books and documentaries she doesn't live in that way that was until three days before mataji's Ella Mandela's funeral a documentary called Winnie aired on a domestic TV channel it showed through interviews with former stratum agents how motiki's element Ella had been targeted in the media already heard about 40 journalists working directly or in origin for me so thrilling I could have specific reports placed in newspapers and it in front page even back then she tried to warn South Africans about the coverage of the Stompa soup a story the deliberate and mischievous lies that cute being perpetrated by the media is beyond anything we have seen and then the kicker that Jerry Richardson the member of the Mandela United Football Club who had killed stompy and then pointed the finger at Winnie was in fact a police informant himself they have been questions over the veracity of some of the claims made in the film but for many South Africans the documentary reiterated why there was so angry with some of the initial coverage of Madikizela Mandela's death because it read like a pothead era propaganda the documentary it was a piece I think of necessary revisionism historical revisionism but I think because when Winnie Mandela died and all the grievances that people have about the way we talk about woman and political struggle a woman and violence kind of came back I think the tragedy is and it's rarely been accentuated in this period of of mourning since her death that we have two competing caricatures of her we seem unable to move beyond either Winnie as the extraordinary hero or Winnie the witch and the truth is they they are both crude caricatures and she's a complicated human being that like all of us comes with baggage from the ugly racist past
