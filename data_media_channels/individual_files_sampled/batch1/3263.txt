at Trump University we teach success that's what it's all about success it's going to happen to you this wasn't your average college student even though there was some of them that were young enough these are middle aged students these are the single housewives where their husband had passed away these are the people that wanted to make a difference in their life through real estate and you know Donald Trump's ads and videos on YouTube and everything is you too can be rich in real estate you could be a millionaire and you know what a person you know everybody believed it these people were taking their life savings or some cases their life savings or taking their retirements and some of them were even maxing out their credit cards to pay thirty five thousand dollars to get that coaching the in field some retreats you heard of Donald Trump and you thought real estate Empire you know self-made man and then I came up from Florida and the interviewing process realized that you know in the beginning a lot of people ask me questions about real estate transactions real estate deals state laws real estate contract laws there was pretty much easy to answer but I felt like from a get-go I was teaching and educating the people that actually worked there I was Delusion at the time because I thought to myself what kind of business does this Trump view is and what kind of business is it and especially when it seems like no one inside that's interviewing me really knows real estate they picked me to actually worked as their inside house coach mentor and at that point in time it wasn't totally honest what was going on in the beginning I admired Trump in the beginning I actually look forward to working for him I loved working with the students I'd love to be in the advisor position it wasn't until I started noticing things where they started attending these live events because I would get phone calls from students saying well I was taught this at this live event in New York City or in Texas or in Florida and at that point in time I was like well you can't do that that's illegal in your state so then I went to Michael Sexton and the owners and the people that were in charge and I said to them I said somebody needs to go and audit these live events because I think something's being taught not kosher or illegal so I was the guy who had to be attending those live events and they took that and they used it to do more up cells and cells and all and I was the inside guy coming back thinking myself these people don't really know real estate they're sharks in the water and they're just high pressured cells people so I was credentialed and I had to prove it why didn't they have to prove it and here we found out later through the subpoenas and to the whole entire court process that I went through is that they weren't and that they were lying and through the students calling me in and telling me through the hotlines that's when we realized that oh this is not going to go far and it's going to go downhill you
