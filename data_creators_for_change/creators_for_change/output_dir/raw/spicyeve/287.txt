wife I decided to think about it it's

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,260
interesting to think about because you

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,730
know of course we always want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> refer</font>

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,160
back to the Arab Spring in North Africa

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Middle East as the you know</font>

19

revolution of social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know</font>

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,570
even still a revolution is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,820
men and women<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to die right</font>

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,380
that's fine a revolution you know a

24
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,140
movement is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing without those</font>

25
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,829
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so although social I</font>

26
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,380
think social media is great it spreads

27
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,600
the word against the word out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and such</font>

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,049
what it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do sometimes is make</font>

29
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,950
people feel like they're participating

30
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,810
even when they're not you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> II mean</font>

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,899
as far as sole rights movement goes and

32
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,479
all of that social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be good</font>

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,600
in getting the mainstream media to pay

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,510
attention

35
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,430
kind of forcing them to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention</font>

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,890
granted again was a different time black

37
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,870
newspapers in reporting on civil rights

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,110
of course and it took a while for them

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">for mainstream media AKA white people</font>

40

about how the civil rights movement came

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,030
into the larger arena of mainstream
