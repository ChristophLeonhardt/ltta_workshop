LET'S TAKE TOYOU RALEIGH, NORTH 
CAROLINA WHERE GOVERNOR ROY 
COOPER IS GIVING AN UPDATE IN 
THE AFTERMATH OF FLORENCE LET'S 
LISTEN IN. 
>> THINGS ARE LOOKING BETTER AS 
MOST OF THE RAIN HAS MOVED OUT 
AND THE RISK OF ROCK SLIDES AND 
MUD SLIDES HAS DECREASED. 
HOWEVER, MANY ROADS 
PARTICULARLY IN EASTERN NORTH 
CAROLINA AND THE SAND HIS TO 
CHARLOTTE REMAIN EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS.      
AND OTHERS ARE BEING ADDED TO 
THE LIST.      
I YOU, IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
DRIVE STAY OFF THE ROADS 
PARTICULARLY SOUTH OF U.S. 64.  
DON'T DRIVE AROUND BARRICADES.  
WE'RE SEEING THIS HAPPEN NOW 
AND THE RESULT IS NOT GOOD.     
LISTEN TO EVACUATION ORDERS.    
BE SAFE,  AND WAIT THIS OUT.   
HERE'S SOME UPDATES: AS OF THIS 
MORNING  NORTH CAROLINA HAS 17 
CONFIRMED DEATHS DUE TO THIS 
STORM.      
WE MOURN THE LOSS OF EACH AND 
EVERY LIFE, AND OUR HEARTS GO 
OUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR 
FAMILY.      
WE HAVE MORE THAN 1,200 ROAD 
CLOSURES  INCLUDING 356 PRIMARY 
ROADS. 
OUR MAJOR NORTH SOUTH CONNECTOR 
INTERSTATE 95, AND PORTIONS OF 
INTERSTATE 40  REMAIN CLOSED TO 
TRAFFIC.      
AS OF THIS MORNING  A LITTLE 
MORE THAN 484,000 PEOPLE IN 
NORTH CAROLINA DON'T HAVE 
POWER.      
EVEN THOUGH THE RAIN IS MOVING 
AWAY  THE GROUND IS SATURATED 
AND EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF RAIN 
CAN CAUSE FLASH FLOODING.    
FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE REPORTED 
RESCUING AND EVACUATING OVER 
2,600 PEOPLE AN OVER 300 
ANIMALS FROM FLOODED AREAS SO 
FAR.     
AND RESCUES ARE ONGOING.      
WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET 
SUPPLIES THROUGH TO MANY IN 
NEED INCLUDING SOME COMMUNITIES 
THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY WATER.   
23 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD, WATER 
AND SUPPLIES MADE IT INTO 
WILMINGTON THIS MORNING.   
IF AND OTHER COMMUNITIES FACING 
THIS HAVE BEING ADDRESSED WELL. 
WE HAVEREQUESTED AND FEMA HAS 
ADDED  MORE COUNTIES TO OUR 
MAJOR FEDERAL DISASTER 
DECLARATION REQUEST. 
BLADEN, COLUMBUS,CBSN, HARNETT, 
LENOIR, JONES, ROBESON, SAMPSON

WE'VE REQUESTED  THAT HOKE AND 
SCOTLAND COUNTIES BE ADDED AND 
KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE MORE 
COUNTIES ADDED.      
RIGHT NOW  THE BLACK, LITTLE, 
LUMBER, CAPE FEAR AND NEUSE 
RIVERS ARE INUNDATED WITH MAJOR 
FLOODING AND 13 MORE RIVERS ARE 
FORECAST TO REACH MAJOR OR 
MODERATE FLOOD STAGE.      
PLEASE DON'T MAKE YOURSELF 
SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO BE 
RESCUED.      
AGAIN, STAY OFF THE ROADS IN 
MUCH OF THE STATE ESPECIALLY 
SOUTH OF U.S. 64 AND EAST OF 
INTERSTATE 73/74. 
MANYROADS IN OUR STATE  ARE 
STILL AT RISK OF FLOODS.     
ROADS YOU THINK ARE SAFE, CAN 
BE WASHED AWAY IN A MATTER OF 
MINUTES. 
AND IF YOUMUST DRIVE DON'T 
DRIVE ON FLOODED ROADS. 
JUST A FEWINCHES OF WATER CAN 
SWEEP YOUR CAR AWAY AND AGAIN, 
DON'T DRIVE AROUND BARRICADES.  
BE ALERT FOR SUDDEN FLOODING. 
AND BE PREPARED TOGET HIGHER 
GROUND QUICKLY. 
PAYCLOSE ATTENTION TO FLASH 
FLOOD WARNINGS AND FOLLOW LOCAL 
EVACUATION ORDERS.

THANK YOU.       
. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
WE'RE GETTING ALOT OF CALLS 
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO HELP. 
THERE ARE A LOT OFWONDERFUL 
CHARITIES HELPING. 
YOU CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
NORTH CAROLINA DISASTER RELIEF 
FUND  AT GOVERNOR -- WE HAVE A 
NUMBER OF EXPERTS HERE WORKING 
AS PART OF THIS TEAM IN THE 
DISASTER RESPONSE AND WE'LL BE 
GLAD TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS.  
. 
>> WE TALKED ABOUT COUPLE DAYS 
AGO  
COMPARED TO OTHER NORTH 
CAROLINA STORMS. 
NOW, AS WE'RE SEEMINGLY ON DAY 
5 OR 6 OF THE STORM START 
THINKING ABOUT ARE THESE STORMS 
LIKE  
WE HEAR IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY? 
WE HEARDABOUT -- RE REMEMBER 
ANDREW, KATRINA, I MEAN, BASED 
ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN  AND THE 
LIFE LOSS AND DAMAGE HOW WOULD 
YOU SQUARE THOSE UP WITH THE 
OTHER -- THESE OTHER MONUMENTAL 
STORMS? 
>> THIS IS AN EPIC STORM THAT 
IS STILL  CONTINUING  BECAUSE 
THE RIVERS ARE RISING IN 
CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR STATE. 
SOME AREAS  HAVE NOT SEEN  THE 
WORST FLOODING YET. 
SOTHIS IS  A MONUMENTAL  
DISASTER FOR OUR STATE.     
THAT AFFECTS  MANY OF OUR 
COUNTIES,   MANY OF OUR PEOPLE. 
WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH 
AN ASSESSMENT HERE  OVER THE  
WEEKS AND MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO  
QUANTIFY  THE MAGNITUDE BUT 
ALREADY WE HAVE 17 PEOPLE  WHO 
HAVE DIED, WE HOPE THEY'RE 
THERE ARE NOT MORE, NOT ANOTHER 
LIFE LOST BUT WE KNOW THAT 
RAGING RIVERS ARE STILL OUT 
THERE AND MORE LIVES CAN BE 
CLAIMED. 
WE'REGOING TO WORK HARD.     
. 
>> GOVERNOR,  
DOES THAT INCLUDE THE ONE FROM 
UNION COUNTY REGARDING THE 
TODDLER? 
AND ALSO PRESIDENT TRUMP COMING 
TO THE STATE      
. 
>> FIRST, I THINK NUMBER ONE 
THE ANSWER IS YES, THAT IT DOES 
INCLUDE THE TODDLER  TRAGICALLY 
DIVIDE IN UNION COUNTY. 
I KNOW OUR OFFICE HASBEEN IN 
TOUCH WITH  THE PRESIDENT'S 
OFFICE  AND THEY ARE WORKING ON 
SOME ARRANGEMENTS FOR THAT. 
WE'REGOING TO HAVE A NUMBER OF 
FEDERAL OFFICIALS VISITING US 
INCLUDING FEMA ADMINISTRATOR 
AND HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY 
AND I'M SURE THERE WILL LIKELY 
BE OTHERS AS WELL.     
. 
>>  HI, GOVERNOR, AS YOU'VE BEEN
COPING WITH THIS CRISIS, ARE 
YOU GAINING ANY INSIGHT INTO, 
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU LIVE WITH 
WATER IN THIS STATE AND ARE YOU 
THINKING ABOUT PLANNING FOR 
THAT? 
ANDALSO JUST  THE PUBLIC 
RESOURCES NEEDED TO COPE WITH 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
SMART ABOUT OUR RECOVERY.    
AND ABOUT OUR LONG RANGE 
PLANNING.      
WHEN YOU HAVE 2 , 500-YEAR 
FLOODS  WITHIN 2 YEARS OF EACH 
OTHER,    IT'S PRETTY CLEAR 
IT'S NOT A 500-YEAR FLOOD.      
SO  AS WE  APPROACH  RECOVERY  
BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, 
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT  FLOODED 
PROPERTY  WORK ON MITIGATION,   
AND BUY OUTS. 
AND BEINGSMART ABOUT HOW WE 
RECOVER.    
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE 
INVOLVING LOCAL, STATE AND 
FEDERAL OFFICIALS .  WE'RE GOING
TO NEEDSIGNIFICANT RESOURCES  
TO RECOVER. 
THERE'S NO QUESTIONABOUT THAT.  
PEOPLE NEED HELP IMMEDIATELY. 
SO I WILL JUST TELL YOU THIS: 
WITH THAT CERTAINLY KEPT IN MY 
MIND BUT OUR IMMEDIATE CONCERN 
IS PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE 
WATER KEEPING THEM SAFE AND 
DEALING WITH THE SHORT-TERM 
EMERGENCY NEEDS THAT PEOPLE 
HAVE.     
. 
>> CAN YOU GIVE US SOME DAYS 
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO GET IN 
AND OUT OF WILMINGTON, WHAT 
WENT INTO THAT? 
>> EITHER MIKE OR JIM.      
. 
>>  YES, SIR. 
WE HAVE ONELIMITED ROUTE INTO 
WILMINGTON AND IT IS CLEAR, UM, 
SO OUR -- OUR D.O.T. 
CREWS SUPPORTING ARE USING THAT 
ROUTE.     
BUT IT IS ONE ROUTE THAT  BASED 
ON WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OVER 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WE DON'T HAVE 
A HUNDRED PERCENT DEGREE OF 
CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN SUSTAIN 
IT. 
SO IT IS OPENEDTODAY AND 
PUSHING SUPPLIES AS HARD AS WE 
POSSIBLY CAN WITH THE -- WITH 
THE PLAN  THAT IT MAY NOT 
SUSTAIN US OVER THE NEXT WEEK.  
. 
>> CAN YOU TELL US HOW 
. 
>>  NO, IT WAS ALL  HIGH WATER 
GOING DOWN AND DEBRIS GETTING 
OUT OF THAT ROAD. 
SO ACOMBINATION OF GETTING THE 
TREES CUT, UTILITY CREWS 
HELPING US GET THE POWER LINES 
OUT AND THEN GETTING THE -- AND 
LETTING THE WATER GET DOWN 
BELOW THE PAVEMENT LEVEL. 
>> ARE YOU ABLE TO GET NORMAL 
VEHICLES THROUGH THERE? 
>> ALL OF OUR VEHICLES. 
>>  I'LL EMPHASIZE AGAIN THIS IS
ANOTHER POINT WHY WE DON'T NEED 
EVACUEES GOING BACK. 
WE'VE GOTONE LIMITED ROUTE INTO 
WILMINGTON.     
AND IT'S BEING USED  FOR 
SUPPLIES AND NECESSARY 
EMERGENCY MATERIAL AND  UTILITY 
WORKERS.     
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
AND WE DON'T NEEDPEOPLE GOING 
BACK RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY 
WHEN  THIS ROUTE MAY DISAPPEAR 
TONIGHT.    
. 
>>  I'M SORRY, THIS ISN'T MY
QUESTION BUT JUST A FOLLOW-UP. 
ARE YOU TELLING US THAT LIMITS 
THE ROUTE IF A REGULAR DRIVER 
CAME UP THERE THAT THEY WOULD 
BE TURNED AWAY? 
I JUST WANT TOUNDERSTAND HOW -- 
LIMITED ACCESS. 
>>  YES, TO WE'RE PUSHING
HUNDRED DOLLARS IF NOT 
THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES SO THOSE 
HAVE PRIORITY. 
HOWEVER, WE'RE NOT --WE'RE NOT 
-- THE ROUTE IS NOT CLOSED.    
BUT WE'RE JUST DISCOURAGING 
UNLESS YOU'RE A FIRST RESPONDER 
OR HAVE DIRE REASON TO GET TO 
WILMINGTON, PLEASE WAIT.     
. 
>>  
HOTELS AND A LOT OF RURAL AREAS 
THAT DON'T HAVE HOTELS AND A 
LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
STRUGGLING. 
HAVEYOU THOUGHT ABOUT AND 
PROVIDED DETAILS ABOUT WHAT 
YOU'RE GOING TO DO FOR PEOPLE 
IN RURAL AREAS BUT REALLY ISN'T 
ENOUGH HOTEL SPACE TO SET THEM 
UP FOR WEEKS?  
. 
>> RIGHT, SO THERE'S ALSO OTHER 
PROGRAMS WHERE  THE DISASTER 
SURVIVOR CAN ACTUALLY MOVE BACK 
INTO THEIR HOUSE, UM AND BEGIN 
TO  DO SOME MINOR REPAIRS THAT 
WILL BE COVERED.   
AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MAYBE GETTING 
SOME TRAVEL TRAILERS TOO.      
. 
>> CAN YOU SPEAK TO DAM 
BREACHES THAT WE'VE SEEN AND 
OTHERS THAT WE'RE MONITORING 
PARTICULARLY IF  
DANGER TORE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT 
EVACUATED YET?  
. 
>>> WE'RE MONITORING ALL THE 
HIGH HAZARD DAMS. 
WE HAD ONEDAM BREACH, SANFORD 
DAM. 
THEREWERE NO HOUSE HOLDS YOU 
KNOW IN UNKOWN OCCASION FLOOD 
MAP. 
SOWE'RE WATCHING THOSE VERY 
CAREFULLY, UM, YOU CAN TO MAKE 
SURE THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING 
ISSUES TO US. 
STILL EARLY,STILL MUCH FLOODING 
AND RIVER CRESTING TO GO.
