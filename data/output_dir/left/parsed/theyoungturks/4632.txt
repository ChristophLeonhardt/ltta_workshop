A FLORIDA COP CITES AN IMAGINARY
LAW WHILE THREATENING A
21-YEAR-OLD BLACK MAN FOR,
JAYWALKING?
IT'S KIND OF FUZZY, BUT
FORTUNATELY THE WHOLE THING WAS
CAUGHT ON VIDEO, LET'S TAKE A
LOOK.
WHAT IS IT THAT WE DID WRONG
OFFICER?
TAKE YOUR CAMERA AND POINTED
OVER THERE AT THE RED HAND.
THAT IS A CROSSWALK.
YOU WERE IN THE CROSSWALK, AND
NUMBER TWO, THERE WAS A RED
SIGN.
YOU ARE BEING LEGALLY DETAINED ñ
PUT YOU IN JAIL.
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW RIGHT
THERE.
YOU LOOK AT ME.
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK TO MY CAR.
I'M ABOUT TO PUT YOU IN JAIL.
FOR WHAT?
DISOBEYING A DIRECT ORDER.
THAT IS NOT DISOBEYING.
RESISTING.
THAT IS NOT RESISTING.
LISTEN TO ME.
I AM DOING YOU A FAVOR.
I AM NOT TELLING YOU AGAIN.
YOU GOT YOUR ID ON YOU?
NO I DON'T.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
THERE'S ANOTHER INFRACTION.
IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA YOU
HAVE TO HAVE ID ON YOU TO
IDENTIFY WHO YOU ARE.
I CAN CONTINUE FOR UP TO SEVEN
HOURS.
YEAH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
FLORIDA DOES HAVE A STOP AND
FRISK LAW THAT ALLOWS OFFICERS
TO DETAIN INDIVIDUALS UNDER
CRIMINAL SUSPICION IN ORDER TO
GUIDE ñ TO IDENTIFY THEM, BUT
ONE, HE TOLD THE OFFICER HIS
NAME AND STATE OF WHEN ASKED,
AND NUMBER TWO, THE STOP IN
FIRST LAW IS NOT STATUTE THAT
THE POLICE OFFICER SAID,
AND NUMBER THREE, JAYWALKING IS
IDENTIFIED AS A NONCRIMINAL
OFFENSE IN FLORIDA CODE.
SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION GUYS, IS
THIS INTIMATE OR MALICIOUS?
DID THE COP NOT KNOW THE RULE,
OR WAS HE JUST GOING ON A
POWER TRIP HERE?
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT WAS
IGNORANCE OR HIM BEING
MALICIOUS.
YOU CAN ONLY SPECULATE ON THAT
AND I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
SPECULATE ON THAT.
WHAT I DO KNOW IS, BOTH ARE
PRETTY BAD.
IF YOU ARE A COP AND YOU ARE
IGNORANT OF THE LAWS, HOW
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT AND
SERVE?
AND IF YOU DID THIS WITH
MALICIOUS INTENT,
ñ INTENT, KNOWING WHAT THE LAWS
ARE, THEN I THINK THAT ALSO
SPEAKS TO HOW YOU ARE NOT FIT TO
BE A COP.
I AGREE EXACTLY WITH THAT
ASSESSMENT.
IS UNCLEAR IF THIS WAS SORT OF
HIM JUST PICKING ON THIS
GUY, OR IF HE GENUINELY THOUGHT
HE DISOBEYED, BUT EITHER WAY
THAT IS AWFUL, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB CORRECTLY.
JUST GIVE HIM A TICKET FOR
JAYWALKING, I GET IT, HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN JAYWALKING.
I DO IT TOO, IF I WERE CAUGHT I
WOULD ACCEPT THE TICKET AND
MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.
BUT WHY DOES HE START TREATING
HIM LIKE A CRIMINAL FOR
JAYWALKING?
WHY DOES HE MAKE STATEMENTS THAT
IMPLY THAT JAYWALKING IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE?
IT IS OBVIOUS NOT JUST A ñ IT IS
ALWAYS A NOT A, NO OFFENSE,
I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT.
IF THERE WAS MALICIOUS INTENT, I
THINK HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BANKING
ON A YOUNG MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE LAW IS FOR HIMSELF, SO
MAYBE JUST LIE TO HIM AND SCARE
HIM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTION
WAS.
EITHER WAY, YOU WANT TO CREATE
AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE
PEOPLE TRUST YOU AS A COP,
RIGHT?
THAT THE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE
CALLING YOU IF THEY NEED
YOU FOR HELP.
AND OFTEN TIMES WE DO STORIES
ABOUT THE WAY THAT CERTAIN
DISENFRANCHISED GROUPS REACTS TO
COPS, PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE,
WHY ARE YOU REACTING THAT WAY?
I WOULD REACT THAT WAY TO COPS
IF THEY WERE LYING TO ME
ABOUT WHAT THE LAWS ARE, IF THEY
TREAT ME LIKE A CRIMINAL
STRICTLY FOR JAYWALKING.
OKAY, YOU SHOULD JAYWALK, BUT
GIVE HIM A CITATION AND
MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
I SUPPOSE YOU GIVE HIM A
CITATION.
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE JUST
SAID, HEY MAN, SORRY TO BOTHER
YOU, BUT YOU JAYWALK BACK THERE
AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT WE
GOT ACCIDENT AROUND HERE ñ
ACCIDENTS AROUND HERE, WHEN
PEOPLE CROSS THE STREET IN THE
MIDDLE, SO JUST DON'T DO IT.
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY IT.
THE WHOLE THING DURING THE
VIDEO, SOUNDED LIKE HE THE
CALL ALREADY HAD A HEAD OF STEAM
GOING ALREADY.
WHY DON'T YOU POINT YOUR CAMERA
OVER THERE?
THEY TAKE THE CAMERA THING
OBVIOUSLY IN AN AGGRESSIVE WAY.
YES, THEY HATE THE CAMERAS.
THEY DON'T DO THAT AS THEIR
YOUTUBE MOMENT, THEY VIEW
THAT AS A PROBLEM.
SO, RIGHT AWAY I THINK THERE WAS
FRICTION, IF I CAN JUST SAY,
BETWEEN THE TWO, BUT THEN WHEN
HE START SERVING UP ALL THIS
CRAP ABOUT THE LAW, I THINK THEY
WERE DISCOUNTING ON THE GUY NOT
REALLY KNOWING THE LAW.
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE
BOTHERING PEOPLE ON THIS
KIND OF THING, AND ESPECIALLY TO
THIS LEVEL.
I MEAN, YOU GOT PEOPLE ON BATH
SALTS IN FLORIDA, GO DO
SOMETHING WITH THAT, RIGHT?
YOU ARE WASTING RESOURCES AND
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON HARASSING
SOMEONE ACROSS THE STREET IN A
WAY THAT YOU DIDN'T LIKE, RIGHT?
WHICH, AGAIN IS AGAINST THE LAW,
BUT ISN'T CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
SO, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT
INSPECTION WAS.
AND I THINK THE WORST ADJECTIVE
TO DESCRIBE THIS OFFICER WOULD
BE PETTY.
YOU DON'T WANT A PETTY POLICE
OFFICER.
HE HAS IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR PROTECTING AND SERVING THE
COMMUNITY, AND HE IS JUST BEING
A REALLY ANNOYING, LITTLE BITCH.
RIGHT.
BEING ANNOYING IS BAD, BUT IT'S
A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN
YOU COME AWAY FROM A STORY LIKE
THIS AND LIKE, JUST HAVE
LIKE, THIS HEAVY SIGH OF RELIEF
BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDN'T GET
SHOT AND KILLED.
THAT'S TRUE.
SO THAT IS ANOTHER SAD PART.
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR THE COP TO
BE LIKE A HOTEL CONCIERGE WITH
THE GUY, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR A
LITTLE BIT LESS CONFRONTATION.
THESE SITUATIONS NEED TO BE
DEFUSED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS.
NOW THIS DIDN'T ESCALATE TO THE
POINT WHERE ANYBODY WAS
HARMED, BUT NONETHELESS, YOU
CAN DE-ESCALATE EVEN THE
INITIAL FRICTION, RIGHT?
IF I SEE YOU AGAIN I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO WRITE IT UP.
I AGREE, JUST A LITTLE
SENSITIVITY TO THE CLIMATE
THAT THEY ARE SERVING AND
WOULD BE NICE TO SEE, AND WE
DIDN'T SEE THAT, SO 
THAT SUCKS.
