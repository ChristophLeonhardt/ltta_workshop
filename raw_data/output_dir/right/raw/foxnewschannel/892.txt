1
00:00:00,275 --> 00:00:01,075
TO CALL BACK SOME OF THE

2
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:03,845
EXECUTIVE POWER THAT HE HAS

3
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:05,480
CEASED FOR HIMSELF IN RECENT

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:05,780
YEARS.

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,048
>> Bret: A CONOR POWELL IN OUR

6
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:08,716
MIDDLE EAST NEWSROOM.

7
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:09,884
PLEASE JOIN ME SUNDAY NIGHT FOR

8
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,819
A SPECIAL LOOK AT THE HISTORIC

9
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:13,354
POINT IN TIME WHEN RONALD REAGAN

10
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:16,724
BROUGHT THE MESSAGE OF PEACE AND

11
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:17,659
FREEDOM TO WHAT WAS THEN THE

12
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:18,259
SOVIET UNION.

13
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,662
THE PROGRAM IS CALLED "THREE

14
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:23,298
DAYS IN MOSCOW."

15
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:25,934
IT'S BASED ON MY BOOK, AND HERE

16
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,702
IS A PREVIEW WITH THE MAN WHO

17
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:28,903
SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS

18
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,674
SECRETARY AT THE TIME.

19
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:35,476
>> I GIVE A SPEECH AT MOSCOW

20
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:36,277
UNIVERSITY WHERE THE PRESIDENT

21
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:38,613
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT FREEDOM OF

22
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:38,947
SPEECH.

23
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:41,049
>> SET THE STAGE FOR THAT ONE.

24
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,051
>> WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR, I

25
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,119
WALKED INTO THE HEAD OF THE

26
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,288
CHURCH WITH THIS HUGE STATUE OF

27
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:48,890
LENIN AND A LECTERN WHICH WAS

28
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,525
SET UP FOR REAGAN WITH A LIGHT

29
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:51,759
IN FRONT OF IT.

30
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,561
>> YOU WERE THINKING IT WAS A

31
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:53,995
BAD THING?

32
00:00:53,995 --> 00:00:57,532
>> I THINK IT WAS A HORRIBLE

33
00:00:57,532 --> 00:00:58,099
THING.

34
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,801
BUT PRESIDENT REAGAN SAW IT AS

35
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:05,239
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER THIS

36
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,240
MESSAGE.

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,842
HIS JOKE LATER WAS, HOW GREAT

38
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:13,247
WAS IT TO HAVE LENIN BACK TO

39
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,115
STARE AT MY BACKSIDE FOR AN HOUR

40
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:14,649
AND A HALF?

41
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:17,185
BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE

42
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:18,486
PERFECT FORUM FOR HIM TO DELIVER

43
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:24,492
HIS MESSAGE.

44
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:26,461
>> Bret: THE STUDENTS FILED IN

45
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,662
AND SETTLE DOWN.

46
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,063
HE WARMED UP HIS AUDIENCE BY

47
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:30,932
WISHING THEM SUCCESS IN THEIR

48
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:32,700
OWN LANGUAGE.

49
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,469
>> I KNOW YOU MUST BE VERY BUSY

50
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,270
THIS WEEK STUDYING AND TAKING

51
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,871
HER FINAL EXAMINATIONS.

52
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:43,111
SO LET ME JUST SAY -- [SPEAKING

53
00:01:43,111 --> 00:00:00,000
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
