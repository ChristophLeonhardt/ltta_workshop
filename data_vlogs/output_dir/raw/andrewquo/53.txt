00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,909
hi I'm Andrew and new years has always

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,009
meant a lot to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a big believer in</font>

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole new year new me thing and I</font>

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">always saw new use as a chance to forget</font>

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the bad stuff that happened</font>

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,440
the previous year and build upon all the

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,389
good stuff so what better way to end

8
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:17,340
your positively<font color="#E5E5E5"> than with a bang and</font>

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,630
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> better way to start a brand new</font>

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,730
year then with a night filled with tons

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,800
of memories and<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiences that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,630
remember forever so for these reasons I

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,160
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this year I was gonna plan</font>

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,529
a crazy New Year's Eve night and record

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,990
what I do and what I spend because my

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,000
friends and I we're not millionaires but

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,010
for one night we can damn sure pretend

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be so the day before New Year's Eve</font>

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,610
is when the expenses really started my

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,809
friends and I all agreed we wanted to

21
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:41,610
dress up for new years which left me

22
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,350
with the problem of not having the

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,450
clothes I needed mainly rest pants and a

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,770
nice dress shirt but systems after

25
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christmas tons of places had sales on</font>

26
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,950
other stocks so we shopped around a

27
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,180
little bit and i found what i needed

28
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,640
both pieces i got on clearance but it

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,829
actually costs<font color="#CCCCCC"> an extra 15</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks to get</font>

30
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,510
the pants tailored to fit perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,789
so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that together was just under</font>

32
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,789
150 bucks so that plus my own cufflinks

33
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,188
tie jacket and shoes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was good to go</font>

34
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,110
the next thing on my list was our

35
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,030
alcohol so I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lcbo</font>

36
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,650
which is the liquor store people go to

37
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,689
in Ontario to shop around for champagne

38
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,280
and that was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time I'd ever</font>

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,320
done that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bottles</font>

40
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,270
range anywhere from 60 to 120 bucks

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,220
which is way more that I've ever spent

42
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,810
on a bottle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

43
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,939
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is New Year's I wanted to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a neck</font>

44
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I remembered so much so then we</font>

45
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,390
walked past the glass doors containing

46
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,729
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the liquor stores most expensive</font>

47
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,310
stuff bottle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom Perignon come I I</font>

48
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,530
that I can see that right I don't know

49
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,079
if you don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is is a 230</font>

50
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,390
dollar bottle of champagne I never spent

51
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,640
anywhere close<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much on anything but</font>

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,990
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna have a night they'll never</font>

53
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,700
forget I got do things I would never do

54
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,880
so I got it so the Dom Perignon and two

55
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,250
bottles of the cheaper champagne and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

56
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,689
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> just cuz we're in Toronto why</font>

57
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,310
not get a bit of Drake's whiskey so we

58
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,720
got a bottle of Virginia black as well

59
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the total of all of that four hundred</font>

60
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,479
dollars that plus the clothes I bought

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,870
over there put our total to 500

62
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,420
oh my pocket starting to hurt the day of

63
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,250
New Year's Eve finally arrived<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

64
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,660
it meant getting to the condo we were

65
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,009
staying in<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the night and picking up</font>

66
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the keys we had a place in central</font>

67
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,600
downtown 15 stories up with a beautiful

68
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,760
view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> city the place itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

69
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,010
massive with huge windows and really

70
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,590
nice countertops and it was everything

71
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have in dream condo</font>

72
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,880
unfortunately for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us prices skyrocket on</font>

73
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,590
New Year's Eve for places like this so

74
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage was probably our biggest</font>

75
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,950
expense of the night eight hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,560
twenty dollars whoo this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is gonna suck</font>

77
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,770
so that plus the 550 from before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

78
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,090
were up to thirteen seventy okay well uh

79
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm up packing my own lunches for the

80
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,210
next little while the last main expense

81
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,800
was tickets for the event we were going

82
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,900
to as a bar called the Madison and early

83
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,940
bird tickets cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 bucks each so if</font>

84
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,220
one ticket costs ten dollars and I was

85
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a group of 15 15 tickets cost a</font>

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,590
hundred and fifty dollars bringing the

87
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,340
total value of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> night to 15 20 so I'm</font>

88
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run out of ways to let you</font>

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this expense is going to be</font>

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">something on be feeling for a while but</font>

91
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,870
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will so so eight o'clock comes</font>

92
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,310
around and people finally start showing

93
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,020
out we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first bottle of champagne</font>

94
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,250
while we wait for more people to show up

95
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then over the course of the night we</font>

96
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,270
pop the second bottle the Virginia<font color="#CCCCCC"> black</font>

97
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally and with the toast the</font>

98
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,800
domperidone and for the record it was

99
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,750
way better than the cheaper stuff

100
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,000
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't buy it again soon but it</font>

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
was the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

102
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,020
ever drank and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were ready</font>

103
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,820
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> head over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the bar at this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

104
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,770
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had spent so much already that a</font>

105
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,290
little extra for a nicer uber wasn't

106
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,700
even an amount that we would notice so

107
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,250
to back<font color="#E5E5E5"> SUVs later and we arrived having</font>

108
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,020
paid eighty dollars for them both<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

109
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to throw down on top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of everything</font>

110
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">else we're sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on sixteen hundred</font>

111
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,140
dollars so I pull up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar and this</font>

112
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,850
is the point at which our night really

113
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,310
begins because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do social media I</font>

114
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,540
reached out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar we're going to</font>

115
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,010
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and worked out a way to</font>

116
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,080
get a line bypass which is not something

117
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,880
that they sell so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just made the</font>

118
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,160
whole experience that much cooler so we

119
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,390
walked right in and made our way<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

120
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,200
the bar it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> New Year's Eve event</font>

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,420
a popular bar so needless<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it was</font>

122
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,300
packed so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> danced make some new</font>

123
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,970
friends we get a few drinks probably an

124
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,010
extra with thirty dollars on top of

125
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything else and as I count down here</font>

126
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,310
I made sure I had as many my friends

127
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,290
with me as I could find and we yelled at

128
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top of our lungs together bringing</font>

129
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,560
in the new year first of the night went

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,660
exactly how you'd expect we kept dancing

131
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,940
we kept making new friends and we had a

132
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,740
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more drinks until it hit about 2</font>

133
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,540
a.m. then we headed<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to her condo to</font>

134
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,070
end the night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and having been planning</font>

135
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,240
this whole event for the last two weeks

136
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,190
it's funny how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took me until now to</font>

137
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,930
fully realize something between the

138
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,330
alcohol the clothes I needed the condo

139
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,160
we rented the ticket prices for the

140
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,290
event and the ubers and the drinks we

141
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,290
got there we spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 1,700 bucks but</font>

142
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,820
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what the night was about I</font>

143
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,740
mean money is a nice thing to have but I

144
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,850
would have had a good night even without

145
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,770
all the luxuries we splurged on cuz

146
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,050
truth is that's been every other New

147
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,240
Year's Eve I've ever had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me this was</font>

148
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,790
about starting 2017 in the best way with

149
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,680
the best people experiences are worth

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,389
way more than any materialistic things

151
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,639
sometimes those things just help to

152
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,350
enhance an experienced a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

153
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,180
in the end all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have left is</font>

154
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,950
our memories and I just wanna be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
