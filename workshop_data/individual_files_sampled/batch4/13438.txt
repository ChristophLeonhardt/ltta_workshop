this is a very good day we're going to be very thankful because at one time I a priest that I listened to in New York he said that there were three prayers that you should always be saying I love you thank you and I'm sorry today we're going to be focusing on the former - we can all repent in our own time and you know flog ourselves and things like that probably we should all do it but we've got a lot to be thankful for because Michelle Obama let's just begin with the first lady first ladies first she is no longer the first lady here is Michelle Obama talking at Temple University everything it takes to succeed I know that you are me and if I can be standing here as your forever first lady then you can do anything you put your mind if I well you can if ifs and buts were candy and nuts we'd all have a Merry Christmas you're not the forever first lady apparently some Democrats on the internet refer to Michelle Obama that way but just imagine the disrespect of that she gets up there and says I'm I am your forever first lady forget about that woman who's him it was actually the first lady who cares about her I'm the forever first lady this was not as bad as Michelle Obama's classic gaffe when she said and by gaffe I mean when she accidentally was honest to the american people and she said that she'd never been proud of her country except when they elected her president or her elected her husband president that she said otherwise i've never been proud of my country this is pretty bad though this uh she says you are me no we're not we're not you we're not why are we you why would we want to be you I don't we I don't know that people like you very much no speaking of this speaking of the National Prayer day and this me me me you are me I'm your forever first lady this is a classic Obama both her and her husband the classic Obama Messiah Complex here was Barack Obama speaking just a little while ago you know I would create a hundred or a thousand or a million young Barack Obama's or Michelle Obama's or you know the next group of people who could take that baton this is the Obama Messiah Complex it's why people call Donald Trump a narcissist Donald Trump is the most humble man in the world compared to the Obamas whenever they need an example of a good thing or something good to be they refer to themselves she says you are me you say you are bright you're ambitious you're talented you're the future you're that no no that all of that pales in comparison to you are me Barack Obama when he says I want to change the future I want to have a wonderful country and the only the best way to do that is to create little versions of me me the greatest American ever because Barack Obama said he doesn't really like America he doesn't like the way that America is that's why he wanted to fundamentally transform America you don't want to fund they transform something that you love I don't say to sweet little ELISA I love you so much honey but I want to fundamentally transform you that isn't what you do and thankfully on the National Day of Prayer they're no longer in the White House ha that is so nice
