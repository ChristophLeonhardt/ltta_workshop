iPhones Millennials and the sacrament of self-love have infected every aspect of society from Alex Jones's browser history all the way up to the White House and even the Vatican we will discuss the virtues and vices of selfishness then on this day in history George Washington shows the difference between pride and dignity finally the mailbag on Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Noel's show we got to get right into it today there's so much to get to beginning with Alex Jones's browser history the the question here is selfishness because this is something that cuts across conservatives and leftists I remember when I was 17 years old I was introduced to ein Rand the author of The Fountainhead and what's that other one book that nobody's read Atlas Shrugged and the virtue of selfishness and this is the her philosophy her ideology is a selfish ideology it's also atheistic and I like every other seventeen-year-old who reads eine rand immediately bought it this is a phase that I think every seventeen-year-old boy has to go through is really liking Iran for a couple years and then usually people move on past that some people still like really love her forever and ever and she talks about the virtue of selfishness when is selfishness good when is selfishness bad when it is selfishness when can it be used to a better purpose and when does it make us look ridiculous and degrade our humanity let's begin at the back end of all of that here is Alex Jones explaining why in a in a videotape of his cellphone browser he had what appeared to be transgender pornography coming up mr. Jones take it away and also what about the trans porn on your phone Alex are you order to talk about that say that again transport on your phone that's all they keep talking about you know I saw a couple of news articles about that it's ridiculous I was like looking up some reporter we're trying to hire today and punched in some number and it popped up porn on my phone everybody's had porn pop up on their phones hundreds of times so I'm sitting with a phone on air showing it to everybody because I couldn't get a URL up in the studio and then like something pops up like oh my god and I looked at it wasn't the news blurted out because there was nothing there they blurred it to then say something was there then you went to it was some porn menu I probably had porn menus pop up 500 times on my phone so I appreciate your call I mean it's the same ladies and gentlemen there's two types of people people that look at porn and people that lie about it but I wasn't looking at porn on my phone I don't take phones on air that I look at porn on and so I saw all that I didn't respond to it I mean if I respond to half the attacks on me it'll be ridiculous but I'll say this the Amazon ads the viagra ads the weird non plastic bag ads are taking my iphone over I thought didn't used to be that bad like Android jeans note to self never show cell phone screen on the air ever never see Alex Jones I actually don't really want to beat up on Alex Jones for this because I felt the same way when Kurt I can Wald that insufferable left-wing writer when he got caught looking at tentacle porn on the Internet there's this sub-genre of pornography where its tentacles and he got caught looking at it and he gave some bogus excuse for he said oh uh it was just a joke haha right everybody it was just you know and which is he was obviously looking at tentacle porn and I sort of feel this way with Alex Jones because he's exactly right there are two kinds of people people who have looked at pornography on the internet and Liars at least among men at least among guys there are like statistically in the United States one-hundred percent of men have looked at naked ladies on the internet or in the case of Alex Jones they have looked at men who look like naked ladies on the internet because perhaps mr. Jones was drinking the same water that the frogs have been drinking for the last few years I said I wasn't gonna make any jokes about it and I did that's awful you know because everyone's done it everybody has looked at porn on the internet especially for the generation of people like my age and younger who grew up basically with the internet like a full 100% of people have have seen porn on the internet so that isn't the issue it isn't about judging people for looking at porn on the internet it's not about judging Alex Jones it's not about judging Kurt I can hold or whatever but it does this is very important because it shows porn usage for what it is like there's a reason that he's embarrassed by this there's a reason I just made that note you know don't ever show your don't ever show your phone on camera there's a reason people are ashamed of this which is that it's a shameful thing it's a shameful thing to look at tentacle porn or whatever what here's the proof of this the Norm Macdonald theory on sex he has a whole bit on one of his albums about have sex as a dirty shameful filthy thing that it's obviously only meant for procreation and his evidence for this is that when you go into your room to have sex you close the blinds you don't like open the windows but a camera there broadcast it to all your friends and and obviously that's even more so true of when you look at porn on the internet when people look at porn on the internet and then they get caught like Alex Jones even Alex Jones who is a master of just exposing himself literally exposing himself he takes his shirt off a lot he's just out there he's not ashamed of anything even he gets flustered even he says oh well I didn't and these are crazy and I don't know he even he can't spin this you're and even Kurt I can Walt says Zoe this wasn't true this didn't happen people get very flustered because it's obviously a shameful thing and the reason it's proliferated is because it's so easy everybody has seen it you get it instantly nobody can catch you it's very difficult to catch you so people say oh it's a harmless activity but it isn't really harmless you know a lot of studies have been done on this a overuse of porn and high speed internet porn and video porn can cause erectile dysfunction in young guys it can cause really perverted fantasies it's caused guys to stop wanting to sleep with their wives or girlfriends because it doesn't match the fantasy important you know we talked a little bit about this I think yesterday that porn is a fantasy and so it's a shameful thing but this should be a lesson to ever obviously people when when the lights are out and the walls are closed and the windows down people do things that they're not proud of that's human nature that's that is just built into us but this is a lesson that we shouldn't do that you know these things do come to light and you don't you just don't want to to do those things you know what is the old I think when old Jim coach of mine said a character is what you do when you think nobody's watching so you know if you're looking at transgender tentacle porn on the internet when nobody's watching that's that's not a good thing because it's it's selfish it's ultimately selfish to just sit in a room and pleasure yourself it's not gratifying because you're not doing anything you're not helping anybody you're not producing anything and and you won't it won't make you happy over time just like any other selfish activity doing drugs abusing alcohol you know staring in the mirror and admiring yourself or whatever I mean that's like the extreme example of selfishness anytime you're just doing something for your own pleasure your own gratification you're gonna get tired of that and ultimately you're not going to be fulfilled there are some uses though there are some uses to selfish behavior if you can put your self-interest and channel it toward a public good then selfishness is not a dirty thing then it's not like the tentacle porn and Kanye West describing Donald Trump to very self-interested men actually explains this very well and that's why selfishness is not necessarily a dirty word and Paulo politics kanya take it away I feel that he cares about the way black people feel about him and he would like for black people to like him like they did when he was cool and their rap songs and all this stuff yeah and he and he will do the things that are necessary to make that happen because he's got an ego like all the rest of us and he doesn't he wants to be the greatest president and he knows that he can't be the greatest president without the acceptance of black community okay is something that he's gonna work towards but we're gonna have to speak to him yeah I need to go with you to the White House and I got a couple things I got to say so this is a longer interview and you know he goes on and on about this but the point is very important which is Donald Trump doesn't want to offend the black vote he doesn't want to offend black people he wants them to like him he remembers in the 1990s you know there were all these rap songs about how cool it was to be Donald Trump his Donald Trump was this billionaire playboy and that's you know that's very popular now he wants to get that back he wants to channel his self-interest for black people it's not it's not that kanye west says Donald Trump he's thought through the ideals of the American Founding and he realizes that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights because that comes from the natural law in the natural creator and therefore we only had blood no it isn't that he gives him he gives a much straighter argument that I think everyone can believe which is that he wants black people to like him because he wants to be liked as he wants to be a successful president that's that's a good enough answer I think people on the right conservatives mocked us sometimes they say oh he's he's so narrow he's so shallow Trump he's so oh who wants Kanye West support Kanye West is shallow and selfish and not he's not this high ideal guy fine but they're doing good things you can channel these natural instincts you can channel lower passions toward a public good I mean there's there is a selfishness there that's a good thing if Donald Trump can be a good president for everybody help everybody succeed put black unemployment at historic lows put the economy at historic eyes high market highs you know have wages increase if he does that because he read the Federalist Papers one day and it really opened his eyes or if he does that because he just wants the history books to be nice to him either way I'm happy either way the black unemployment rate goes down either way the stock market goes up either way I win that's fine you know we don't need to treat the presidency like it's a religion we don't need to treat it like it's the Vatican we nowadays we might have to treat the Vatican like it's the presidency but we'll get to that later ooh we don't have to treat it in these exclusively idealistic terms if he's using his selfishness to become a good president that's a very good thing and this applies not just to the individual players in politics this applies to national policy to the Washington Post has this story today this is an absurd story but it shows you it shows you where that the logic of this ends up especially for the left and it shows you why you do need self-interest or you can't look after anybody else from the Washington Post this is the headline quote u.s. is denying passports to Americans along the border throwing their citizenship into question so it's based on this policy right now the US isn't if people present their documents they say here's my birth certificate or whatever I want a US passport but if they were born along the southern border the State Department is saying hold on a second we need to prove that you're a citizen now people are up in arms they're saying this is racist this is denying Americans their rights this is bigoted that some dumb-dumb on Twitter was comparing Trump to Hitler because of this widget by the way you remember Donald Trump deported that Nazi a couple weeks ago that should buy him some he's not Hitler credit for a little while but that's neither here nor there here is what the piece goes on to say in the Washington Post quote on paper he's a devoted US citizen his official American birth certificate shows he was delivered by a midwife in Brownsville at the southern tip of Texas he spent his life wearing American uniforms three years as a private in the army then as a cadet in the border patrol and now as a state prison guard but when 140 applied to renew his US passport this year the government's response floored him in a letter the State Department said it didn't believe he was an American citizen okay so that's bad that doesn't sound good on its surface right there's a guy serve his country 40 years old and they said they don't believe he's an American citizen so this has to raise a few questions why don't they believe he's an American citizen is it is this question just or is it unjust and has this happened before is this some totally new thing so despite the headline despite the first scare paragraph the the article actually goes on to explain all of this and it should refute the entire headline because this goes back to the first sentence of the article four sentences his official and birth certificate shows he was delivered by a midwife in Brownsville blah-blah-blah-blah-blah the official one the question is is that true so the piece goes on quote the government alleges that from 1950s through the 1990s some midwives and physicians along the texas-mexico border provided us birth certificates to babies who were actually born in Mexico in a series of federal court cases in the 1990s several birth attendants admitted to providing fraudulent documents so just listen even to even when they're admitting that this is a totally legit thing the washington post can't quite give it to them they say the government alleges blah blah blah but then it meant later in that same paragraph they say in a series of federal court cases the birth attendants admitted to providing fraudulent documents so it's not that the government alleges this it's that we know for a fact it's true because the people who did it admitted it years ago so that forget alleges this we know this is a legitimate thing this isn't the government trying to pull a fast one we know this is a legitimate thing and is this new is this something that just happened is this a brand new policy it's never happened before Trump's just using it as an excuse to deport people he doesn't like or to discriminate against people he doesn't like is that's what's being alleged by the left but the same exact piece in The Washington Post goes on but based on those suspicions the State Department during the George W Bush and Barack Obama administration's denied passports to people who were delivered by midwives in Texas Rio Grande Valley did you really bury the lede doesn't it the last thing says not only during the last Republican administration george w bush but even during the previous democrat administration under barack obama this exact same policy was in place nothing new so why is this a news story it's a news story because the mainstream media are trying to use it as a cudgel against donald trump's they're going to dig up something that was barely reported on if it all reported on when it happened in the first place they're gonna say see Trump's Trump's being a racist trinks being this trumps being of that the reason I bring this up those not just to beat up on the mainstream media which is a daily hobby it's a wonderful thing to do I encourage it but the reason I bring it up is because of the policy itself which is we have not just credible evidence we have proof that some of these birth certificates were fraudulent the during the 1950s to the 1990s we're talking about a four decade period here five decade period and so the United States has two options here either it can say oh well it doesn't really matter if we're giving foreign nationals the rights of US citizens that's okay that's fine whatever hey it's okay what what does it matter to us those guys are poor in Mexico and they whatever they can do that or they can pursue their selfish interest they're there at their self-interest in this case for the United States is to protect its borders to protect the its sovereignty to protect the legitimacy of its citizenship and to kick people out who shouldn't be here now this seems icky to people all the whole left is saying that selfish that's selfish that's selfish some to be selfish governments have to pursue their own interests and when governments don't pursue their own interests when they don't pursue the interests of their people it's not just that they're being charitable or compassionate or something they're being tyrannical they're being tyrannical if a government is not pursuing your interests if you are not being represented by your government that that isn't a small matter that's a that's a matter of the government becoming tyrannical of opposing the will of the people which in in the United States is not kosher that's not what our republic was built on it's a very very bad thing governments have to pursue their interest these days among the left and among the idealistic ideological right they're pretending that countries don't have interests this is where nationalism has become a bad word we're gonna talk to your impose oniy on the author of the virtues of nationalism we're gonna be talking to him I think next week about this this issue today the country has its own interests as a bad thing all you heard from the idealistic right all you heard from the left is Oh Trump he's he's saying that other countries need to pay up to their responsibilities he's saying that the United States is gonna pursue our own interests he's saying we're gonna put America first where are my pearls where can I got a clutch where are they they what's wrong about saying America they said that America first is a harkens back to Charles Lindbergh or something it doesn't harken back to Charles Lindbergh in the minds of the people using it today the Americans who say yeah I think we should put America first they're not thinking of Charles Lindbergh they're saying we have a national interest and it's incumbent upon the government to follow our interests because we're the people were their bosses there's nothing wrong with that that's self-interest it isn't you know people draw a difference between self-interest and selfishness you know between being childlike and childish one one of those is bad one of those is perfectly appropriate and it is perfectly appropriate for the government to pursue the interest of the people putting America first is not a bad thing then let the late Senator John McCain ran his 2008 presidential campaign on the phrase country first do you remember this was the whole country first thing and other candidates have used this true they say country first can someone explain to me the difference between country first and America first America is the country right we're talking it we're not talking these people aren't running for president of Mexico or president of Hungary or something right it's America first or country first and yet it's but it's a bad word you're not allowed to say it's a good thing for countries to pursue their interest because in the United States by the way when the United States pursues its own interest everything gets better for everybody when the United States is allowed to pursue its own foreign interests abroad the world is more peaceful when the United States is allowed to pursue its own economic interests the world is more prosperous when the United States is allowed to pursue its own environmental interests the environment improves this was the issue of this pair of climate treaty we pull out of the Paris climate treaty because we say we're putting our country first you don't get to take away our sovereignty you don't get to tell us what to do what happens we're the only people who improve the economy or improve the environment so many other signatories of the Paris treaty actually are destroying the environment they were not living up to their promises they're polluting at even higher rates the United States when we pursue our interest things get better this is almost always the case we've got to move on a little bit but I as a matter of national policy don't let the mainstream media fool you don't let them pretend that a country pursuing its own self-interest is a bad thing self-interest can be a very good thing this is the premise of liberal economies this is the premise of liberal democracy is that when you allow people to pursue their interests in good faith to pursue their interests in good faith and discipline themselves into order themselves and not just look at transsexual porn all day but to actually discipline themselves and pursue virtue but when they pursue their interests in that with that discipline things get better freedom works and it does you know when when Americans keep an orderly sense of self interest and virtue and pursue their interests the country thrives the world thrives when they do that without the sense of discipline then it falls apart and then they start worshipping fire demons in the Nevada desert have sex with each other in or Genomes you don't want that I mean these things can fall apart but self-interest can be a good thing freedom works when you have people who are ordered to it when when liberty doesn't become life sensuousness and this this perversion of the idea of liberty this perversion of the idea of self-interest is nowhere more apparent than in this billboard this was going around Twitter yesterday this billboard is unbelievable the Billboard says do we have the words that it's something to the effect of black women look after their families and they take care of themselves abortion is self-care abortion is self-care and I so I'm looking at this thing and all these progressives are sending it around Twitter they're saying yeah support black women so yeah I just the logic of this billboard is support black women kill black babies because it's not even saying like all women or over there it's saying no no we need to kill specifically black babies and that's progress that's progressivism in 2018 is kill black babies at a higher rate because it's self-care and the argument here by the way is that somehow it's good for a mother it's good for herself to kill her child there's no evidence of that mother Teresa said I believe in 1994 that the greatest cause of evil in the world the greatest policy issue of evil in the world is abortion everyone mocked her they said no what about genocide what about this what about that but she said if a mother can kill her own child that is the greatest font of evil interpersonal evil because if a mother can kill her own child what can't we do what won't we do is there any bond more sacred than that from mother to child and if you can murder your own child what won't you do and that's what they're saying they're saying now it's self care this is not proper or self-interest this is real selfishness this is base wicked selfishness and you don't want to do that because when a man is wrapped up in his own self he makes a very small package indeed you know you don't only if you if you're just there staring at the transsexual frog porn or whatever I don't know what it is if you're just doing that you will not be fulfilled do you ever you know whenever someone satisfies the flesh that can be you go and you just eat a table full of food or you drink three bottles whiskey or you do whatever you do on your cell phone browser or whatever or you leave the orgy dome at what's the what's the festival called Burning Man you leave the orgy dome at Burning Man I don't think people ever walk out of there and they say gosh I feel great about myself now yeah I really did I really pleasured myself I gave myself a lot of pleasure you know what they're gonna read at my funeral someday they're gonna say you know he owed John John lived a lie he went to the orgy dome and looked at stuff on his cell phone brass or an eight a table of food and guzzled bottles of whiskey morning tonight he really pleasured himself let it let it be said of that great and glorious man he pleasured himself nobody wants that nobody wants that on their as their epitaph nobody wants that on their on their headstone but that's what this stupid billboard is saying they're saying it's really self it's really caring for yourself to kill your baby nobody not a soul not the biggest shout your abortion proponent in the entire world once it written on her headstone here lies Sally Jones she killed her babies nobody wants that it's a shameful thing it is far more shameful than looking at transgender porn on your browser it's far more shameful than that we all know that that's true and the people who put up these billboards and say it's self care its self care it's shout your abortion it's good it's loving it's they know it's a lie it's such an absurd lie kill black babies that's progress we that is such an absurd and no amount of singing it doesn't matter how big your billboard is gonna get doesn't matter how loud you shout your abortion that isn't going to change the fact that is a shameful thing there the next one they're gonna do is euthanasia they're gonna do it for assisted suicide but you know black women take care of themselves they have to look after themselves assisted suicide is self-care that's what they're going to say that's that's that is as incoherent as a abortion being self care it's as incoherent those things are in self care when the challenge that we have to do because we have a broken human nature and we have original sin is to take our inherent selfishness the pride that caused the fall and turn that away from ourselves to not look away to channel all that to do something good and that can be done that can be done in politics as we're seeing it can be done in the government we're seeing it can be done in business if those things can be done but that's the only way we're gonna do it we're not going to do it do it by denying the reality of selfishness and we're not going to do it by by by pretending that awful shameful things are somehow good and glorious this of course brings us to the Catholic Church I do have to address this in our last minutes before the mailbag here well I do want to correct one thing I think I said on the show the other day I referred to that whistleblower that high-ranking Catholic official the nun CEO to Washington the Vatican's ambassador to the US I referred to him as a Cardinal Cardinal figa no he's not a cardinal he's an archbishop but he's not a cardinal and it seems like a minor distinction it's easy to get confused but the reason that's important is because he's not a cardinal he's not in a power play a personal power play in the Vatican he's not you know in the College of Cardinals or something like that there's there's a lot less to selfishly gain from this there's just the this is much more clearly an act of an act of conscience and an act of love for the church to air at this dirty laundry which so many a cleric so many Vatican officials don't want to do but I've got to play this for you this this guy at Cardinal cubish I said that's unshared Obol people refer to this guy as Cardinal cupcake which is not nice I wouldn't do it nice to do but cubish I think she pronounced soup ish but people call him cupcake so then they think it's cupich I believe it's super whatever his name is this is a guy who he's the one who came out immediately said the Pope doesn't have to say anything well I'll let him tell you himself here's Cardinal supers the Pope has a bigger agenda he's got to get on with other things of talking about the environment and protecting migrants and carrying on the work of the church we're not going to go down a rabbit hole on this the record shows that whenever there's actionable information Pope Francis acts quite frankly they also don't like him because he's a Latino it's not just about the Catholic Church let's look at all the agencies and institutions that deal with children on day to day basis anything else anything else you want to blame this on except for except for what's actually being discussed this is unbelievable look at what he said just there I can't even go through all of that he's saying that it's because people are racist that they're attacking him they're saying that Pope Francis can't address the major sex abuse scandal that he is now implicated in by a high-ranking incredible church official because he's got to talk about what air conditioners and subverting immigration law is he's got to talk about global warming and immigration so he can't address the serious accusations credibly leveled against him then that what at what else what does he say he says we have to talk to about other groups because because he makes a fair point here which is that the Catholic Church does not have higher rates of child abuse than any other religious denomination according to any study and children are orders of magnitude more likely to be abused by school teachers than by priests sure that's fine but that's not where we're talking about that's not what we're talking about at all we're talking about specifically this guy's buddy Cardinal soup is buddy Cardinal McCarrick who has been seriously accused credibly so of abuse not just of seminarians and priests but also of minors we're talking about Pope Francis who has been implicated in a cover-up here but we're talking about another story that just came out today which is that Pope Francis apparently gave a sweetheart apartment to really posh Vatican apart to a priest who was known to be a problem priest to this guy what is his name a Monsignor Luigi kaput see he was known to be a problem priest he was known to engage in sexual behavior known to be a big issue he gave it to him as a favor for his friend Cardinal Francesco Coco Palmieri Palmieri oh and this priest ended up having a drug-fueled gay orgy in this Vatican apartment for hours and hours on end it's only because the neighbors who also are priests almost certainly called the cops on him he finally got arrested for this there were serious sex abuse and coverup issues here and what is Cardinal su pitchers response no no no we've got I've got more important things to do than to deal with this this is the classic response of the left by the way which is that the left loves humanity and they don't care that much about humans they say no I've got I can't talk about these people who have been sexually abused I can't talk about these people who have covered up sexual abuse and who have been personally directly implicated in this I've got to care for humanity I've got to stop global warming I've got to subvert u.s. immigration laws III have a much more important task than your silly little sex abuse scandal give me a Brit this is outrageous an outrageous response I mean this this response by by the Cardinal is the most tone-deaf response to a legitimate social grievance since Marie Antoinette's apocryphal line let them eat cake which she didn't actually say but this is this is at least just tone-deaf as that and they need to give an answer for it but I'm sure more is gonna come out every day and by the way well this is all happening just a note for the New York Times the New York Times ran a headline well all of this is I mean worse and worse news every single day for Pope Francis this is the headline Francis takes high road as conservatives pounced taking criticisms public that's the news report that's not an op-ed the news report from the New York Times Francis takes high road as conservatives pounce taking criticisms public so they're saying that they're judging that Francis is taking the high road by refusing to acknowledge the legitimate and credible allegations about him covering up sex abuse for one there then saying that the news story is not the credible allegations of sex abuse but that conservatives are pouncing and by pouncing they mean asking questions about the credible allegations of sex abuse and cover-ups by the priests and then and then the this is the best part the third part is the New York Times headline is that the Conservatives are pouncing and that's bad and they're not taking I Road because they're taking the criticisms public so they should be covering them up that's what the headline is saying usually the Conservatives should be good they should be nice and they should cover up all of the sex abuse they should cover up all of the cover-up of the sex abuse this is uh this shows you by the way for certain that the New York Times does not care about the victims of sexual assault they do not care one little bit they care about leftism and they have what they think is a pope who is pushing leftism and who was covering for cardinals who are pushing leftism and there does seem to be a strange coincidence of leftism and these Cardinals and bishops who are covering things up and the that's all they care that is what they clearly care about here they don't care about abuse the headline is begging them to keep covering up the abuse now they actually had to change this online because they it was so beyond the pale it's the online versions Vatican power-struggle bursts into open as conservatives pounds conservatives aren't pouncing there's a credible allegation that these left-wing clerics have been covering up or participating in sexual abuse for a long time that's what happened that's the news story but conservatives pass they do this in politics all the time you know there's more I want to get to there's another important story to get to and there's this day in history man I ain't get to anything today we got to get to the mail bag though I'm sorry to say we'll have to save those other things for next week in the meantime go to daily wire.com because we've got a lot of mailbag what do you get you get me you get the intro claims or you get a bunch of Peoria's questions in the mailbag that's coming right up you get asked questions in the conversation I'm practicing my ben shapiro voice I wanna see how fast I can talk talk talk talk talk but before any of that you got to get the leftist tears tumblr you got to get it because this hmm this leftist here's tumblr tastes like the effects of people pursuing their appropriate rational self-interest this tastes like the effects of enforcing immigration law this tastes like the effects of Donald Trump doubling more than doubling his support among the black vote which is traditionally a Democrat stalworth vote this tastes like the the virtues of pursuing self-interest not the vices and that's a wonderful thing because there is nothing vicious about leftist ears they are a true true wonder and a blessing go to daily wire.com we'll be right back with the mailbag I never get to everything that I want to get to but I also never get to finish the mailbag and I'm probably not going to today we're gonna give it a good try though from Robert I wanted to point out that smoking substances grown from the earth to get high has been around for thousands of years mainly in Asia so it's not exactly a new drug i generally appreciate your insight on most subjects but your anti-pot rant was lacking depth love your show well thank you for watching the show I appreciate it I knew I was gonna get this objection so I wanted to head it off but I'll say it again I don't deny that yeah smoking pot has been around for like all of human history using drugs smoking drugs to get high too you know whether it be shamans in the desert or eating or smoking whatever in Asia or the pre Columbus America's yeah that's been around for all of human history that hasn't been mainstream in the West that's true that's that's from other cultures absolutely in fact this is my defense of alcohol alcohol has been with our culture since the dawn of time Oh calls been around a very long time in fact Christ the from which we get our Christian culture from whom we get our Christian culture his first miracle was to turn water into wine for drunk people not just any wine but very good wine so this was the argument people say if you why don't we have pot pot is not as bad for you as alcohol well I'm not arguing that one way or the other I'm just saying alcohol is part of our culture so if you try to get rid of alcohol you're going to fail you're gonna end up with prohibition you're gonna it's just simply not gonna work you're butting up against thousands and thousands and thousands of years of tradition and culture and ideologue think that they can get rid of thousands and thousands of years of tradition overnight but we know that that can't really happen so I'm not I'm not arguing one way or the other I'm just saying that's not gonna work my question is why would we introduce a new one why would we introduce marijuana into the culture marijuana doesn't come from our culture marijuana was introduced as a mainstream concept very very recently so why would we help that become mainstreamed yes that's part of asian culture whatever shows but smoking things to get high is part of a lot of cultures they can have it that's their culture why would we introduce it towards what's the benefit why would we do it I see no reason I'm not even saying that like pot is a terrible thing or that it's worse than alcohol it's we're not saying that at all there's a time and a place for everything that places college know what 1 in 7 Americans smokes pot on occasion year to year to year I'm not saying I'm just saying why would we mainstream it why would we legalize it why would we encourage you if the government were to pull away alcohol from our culture that would be a real incursion that would be a real interference into our culture in our society but if the government were to take it were to stop legalizing marijuana that's not interfering in our society marijuana has never had a place in our society so why would we introduce it now people have to think not ideologically about this because ideologue think they can get rid of culture overnight they have to think about this more broadly from a traditional perspective from a perspective culture in society and conservative thought next question from Emanuel God God with us hi Michael I was wondering if you could speak to the vocation of the artist particularly with your background as an actor and now in the context of Catholicism I've been struggling with this for ages constantly looking for something to tell me that it's a good thing I wasn't built to be an accountant or a mechanic or anything with any conceivable life skill I have no problem paying my dues working at a regular job until I can do what I ought that's not the issue I just want to know that it's a good thing to aspire to that the church and the world perhaps might need someone like me thanks so much love the show and keep up the good work well as somebody who has no discernible hard skills whatsoever I feel able to answer your question of course you should pursue art if that's what you should be doing but you can't really you can't plan these things out too much and if you make an idol out of your art or your preferred job or your preferred craft you're gonna go down a bad path and that isn't the thing that you should be doing I'll say this as someone who's never gonna work in this town again I still on occasion get the opportunity to work as an actor so I'm doing another Kingdom with Andrew Clavin right now we're doing the second season of that the first season was very successful second season is going to be successful I've been able to do a handful of movies and play as some of which were good some of which got good reviews and that's always nice but you don't get to do it all the time I say now the only time I get hired as an actress by Ted Cruz a dennis prager and andrew Clavin this is the last employers that doesn't keep me up at night I don't I'm not crying and sad all the time because I'm doing something different than that you'll do what you can do you take the step that's in front of you but art is a wonderful thing I I've never wanted to become an accountant or to become mechanic or to do anything that is practically useful whatsoever and I think I'd be unhappy doing that and I don't think I'd make a contribution to that at all but if you're if you're interested in things such as art or politics philosophy those sorts of things that that's one to theology whatever then pursue those things pursue what you think that you're called to do a good way to measure this to see if you're actually doing the right thing is one are you willing to work when people offer you an opportunity are you willing to do it even if it's not exactly what you planned out you can never plan your own life for you it never works out that way if it did work out that way we'd be in a very shallow poultry world so are you willing to do that work do you do you mind being led where the thing leads you to go then perhaps you're you're willing to do that and are you willing to deal with it if you can't pursue that art for a year or two years or three years or you do something else if you're willing to go where God is leading you to go then you're on the right path if you're making an idol out of your art and your languishing and you're upset all the time like like virtually everyone is in Hollywood especially actors and directors and writers if your language and saying I want to do this I want to do this I want to tell God how my life is gonna go then you're not doing the right thing and you should really rethink your priorities from Jody hey Michael why was Alexandria Ocasio Cortes mmm why was Alexandria Ocasio Cortes late to the socialist political rally in Boston because she was Stalin thanks Michael I thought that was a question when I read that I realized it had the punch line built in I'm gonna use that that's really got me use that while I wear my shirt why were my she Guevara shirt from Nathan hey Michael you have multiple times put down churches that use acoustic guitars I know there are typically more problems with those kind of churches but let's ignore that for now I feel the same way but I don't know why other than pure tradition it should be this way because it's always been this way do you have a reason why some instruments are more or less propria to use from praising the Lord and where why do you draw at that line I assume organs are okay but what about pianos keep up the good work and God bless yes there is a hierarchy certain instruments are more fit for worship than others and I say this as a guitar player you know I've played guitar since I was like 12 or something like that actually enjoy playing guitar and strumming around but guitar is a lesser instrument the reason I've been playing guitar since I was 12 I basically taught me what it took a couple classes but I basically taught myself how to play guitar most people teach themself how to play guitar it's because it's an easy instrument to play now certain composers have have made good use of guitar classical guitar made it a complicated instrument but not not as complicated as a violin for instance not as complicated as the harp not as you know there are there are higher instruments to play harder instruments to play the French horn whatever there are and they do different things you know the ancient Greeks and all wise people throughout history have recognized that music plays upon your soul it's the most important of the arts because it speaks right to your soul it can put you in a different mood it can put you in a different perspective it can make you rethink certain things which is why when you play really guttural visceral ugly tribal music you feel less elevated you feel less human than if you're listening to Bach or something the what I think should be used for worship is actually just the voice I think the the early church had it right I think the Eastern Orthodox Church still has it right it should be the voice I think the whole liturgy should be sung the reason for this is it takes out that personality there's nothing worse than a you know there I suppose there are some worse things but when it comes to the liturgy there's nothing worse than a priest getting up there and and giving the performance of Hamlet that he never got to play you know he goes up there I'm gonna really perform this gospel today I'm gonna make you feel it with my emotions and goes up there and does a shtick and starts telling jokes and as a little soft-shoe during his homily people don't want that you don't want personality you want the priest to be a conduit between God and you you want you want to see Christ through the priest and this is why you want the ad orientem facing you don't want the priest facing you like he's doing a sticky vaudeville show you want you and the priest together to be looking up toward God to be looking at the altar to be looking through to heaven so I much prefer the voice Oregon is nice too there are a lot of great old Protestant hymns that sound very nice in Oregon and but you know when you get to the guitar Church you get these saccharine things Catholic and Protestant alike you get these you know eagle's wings and oh yeah it's really like a bad 90s rock song that doesn't that that will not lift you up to worship that makes you just look back at yourself and your own saccharine sentimental pop culture and then looking at the priest and seeing if the priest is putting on a good show and if he's entertaining you you know one of the real giveaways for this is if people applaud at the end of mass if you're applauding then you're then you're going to the theater I hope you I hope you like the play and so is it a good musical did they do the good dance at the end that's a that's a better play if you're if you're applauding people in church you're probably not looking at who you're supposed to be looking at so I you know even when it comes to this old Protestant Tim's the ones on the organ and everything I really like those very straight ones worth like oh we will worship God and we're worshipping God let's keep worship God you know whatever those are great because they take out this saccharine personality and they they direct you toward God if if you can do that with an instrument very good certain instruments are more likely to do that but otherwise use the human voice I think it was a Gustin who said to sing well is to pray twice to sing well yeah that's an important qualifier there but to sing well is to pray twice and that's I think we should be singing the whole time when we get up to heaven we're gonna be singing and we should do that in the liturgy because the mass should be heaven on earth from Jonathan we have more time I can do like one more hello hello I've been single for several years and have thought of getting back into the dating game again but I have little to no confidence is there some way out of this trouble yes I'm gonna give you the advice that Don Corleone I gave to Johnny Fontaine when he was trying to get out of his contract to get a better contract imagine that these are your shoulders you're gonna act like a man what's the matter with you you got act like a man that's that's the answer you got to act like a man and that should tell you every single thing about it you are a man you are a man gender is not socially constructed biological sex is not socially constructed act like a man act like what you were built to be you have no confidence just do it forget about when when people say I have no confidence that's because they're thinking about themselves they go on thinking of me should I be doing this shit am I doing this right do I look good and might wear this stop it stop thinking about yourself don't do that just act like a man acting like a man doesn't mean dragging your knuckles and like knocking the lady on the head with a mallet or something acting like a man means being a gentleman to doing the other thing but what it really means is focusing on the girl if you're on the date focus on the girl if you're trying to meet a girl don't be desperate because when you're desperate you're thinking about yourself you're just think about your own desires your own needs as a matter of practical where do you meet girls there are a lot of places you can meet girls you can meet girls at a bar you meet girls at a church you can meet girls in a club a lot of times you can meet girls through friends you can meet girls on those apps I kind of missed the apps because I had a girlfriend during the apps but I know multiple people who have gotten married from the apps close friends and family of mine so the apps can work and you know some of them are very religious so you know some of the apps are to hook up and and some or or not they're for more serious things so why don't we use that do whatever works I'm not saying you've got to be prudish about it and be waiting to meet her in the choir loft at your church or something you go meet a girl wherever you're gonna go meet a girl but just be confident about it you say I don't have confidence just be confident but how do I be confident just be act like a man that's that's really what it takes when you're when you're thinking of yourself this is actually a perfect question to end on because it ties exactly in with selfishness and self-interest if so they're used interchangeably today but there really should be a distinction if you're being selfish you're just trying to use the girl to fill some hole in yourself some desires I really want sex or I really want dinner companion or whatever but self-interest is it's not good for man to be alone you got to go out there you got to find a partner you you want to men want women that's a natural fact and you're gonna pursue that self-interest and the way you're gonna do it is do the things that men are supposed to do hold the door open pay for dinner don't go dutch dinner pay for dinner pay for the drinks whatever and be interested in her this is the advice for when you're on the date I am shocked at how men do not understand this shut up and listen to her you'll it'll be the best conversation it'll be they will love it this is ironic because I talk every day you know 45 minutes to you but I'm telling maybe it's because of that that I've like learned this in every other aspect of my life listen to them if you're just there to pontificate then you're not you're not going to learn anything you're not gonna have a good time it's only talking to people is only interesting when they teach you something when they show you some aspect of human nature and I promise you at the end if you let this girl talk for 90% of the time then you're gonna walk away she's gonna say well you're an excellent conversationalist well I've never met a better conversationalist but just do that don't I know it's it's it seems like a cop-out to say be normal be a man go get the girl I know that seems like I'm not giving you good advice I'm giving you excellent advice but there is no secret it's not in that book you know the pick-up guidebook there's no trick there's no you're gonna hack their brain or what I know there's no you just people can sense it don't be don't be inauthentic be authentically the best version of you be authentically who you're supposed to be hope that helps get back to me let me know if it works out hey you've got a binge another Kingdom because we're filming the new season of another Kingdom
