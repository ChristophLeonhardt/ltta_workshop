THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BREAKING NEWS, OPENING MONOLOGUE. TONIGHT, JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS FIGHTING BACK AND STANDING UP FOR HIS GOOD NAME AND HIS REPUTATION, AND HE IS DEMANDING A FAIR PROCESS. HE SAYS HE WON'T BE INTIMIDATED AFTER DAYS OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. PROFESSOR CHRISTINE FORD HAS NOW AGREED TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS SHE MADE AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH. LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. THESE ARE MYSTERIOUS ALLEGATION ALLEGATIONS, SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS, I SAID IT MANY TIMES. PROFESSOR FORD DESERVES TO BE HEARD AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. THIS COMING THURSDAY, YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM BOTH PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN AN OPEN SETTING. CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WAS RIGHT TO HOLD THE HEARING, AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING EXTREMELY FAIR AND ACCOMMODATING AND TAKING THESE BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO TO A S BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO TO A E ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY. BUT TONIGHT WE NEED TO TO A P BACK AND REMEMBER WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THESE ARE 35-YEAR-OLD SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS MADE BY PROFESSIONAL OR FORWARD IT TO CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS. THE CLAIMS DATE BACK TO WHEN FORD AND KAVANAUGH WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN, SHE WAS AWARE OF PROFESSOR FORD'S ALLEGATIONS SINCE JULY. SHE SAT ON THEM AND KEPT IN THE SECRET. UNTIL AFTER CAVANAUGH AND KAVANAUGH'S A PUBLIC HEARING LENGTHY MEETINGS WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH. IN FACT, DIANNE FEINSTEIN REFUSED TO CONSENT REPUBLICANS, OR COLLEAGUES, THE FULL UNREDACTED LETTER WHERE ACCUSATIONS WERE FIRST MADE BACK IN JULY UNTIL TODAY. NOW PROFESSOR FORD CANNOT REMEMBER THE DATE OR LOCATION OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT. THE FOUR WITNESSES THAT FORD HERSELF LISTED TO CORROBORATE HER CLAIMS, THEY ARE ALL NOW ON RECORD DENYING WHAT FORD IS ALLEGING. JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAT DOWN WITH OUR OWN MARTHA MacCALLUM AND CATEGORICALLY REFUTED THESE CLAIMS ONCE AGAIN. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. Judge Kavanaugh: I MAY HAVE MET HER, WE DID NOT TRAVEL IN THE SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES. SHE WAS NOT A FRIEND OR SOMEONE I KNEW. Martha: IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER BEING AT PARTIES WITH HER EVER? Judge Kavanaugh: I DO NOT. THIS IS AN ALLEGATION ABOUT A PARTY IN THE SUMMER OF 1982 AT A HOUSE ON CONNECTICUT AVENUE ON EAST WEST HIGHWAY WITH FIVE PEOPLE PRESENT. I WAS NEVER AT ANY SUCH PARTY. THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLEGED TO BE PRESENT SAID THEY DON'T REMEMBER ANY SUCH PARTY. A WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT, OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT WHO IS DR. FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND HAS SAID SHE DOESN'T KNOW ME, AND NEVER REMEMBERS BEING AT A PARTY WITH ME AT ANY TIME IN HER LIFE. Sean: NOW KAVANAUGH IS FACING ONE MORE ALLEGATION BECAUSE OVER THE WEEKEND, THE NEW YORKER BROUGHT UP ANOTHER DECADES-OLD CLAIM AGAINST AND KAVANAUGH, IN THIS CASE A WOMAN NAMED DEBORAH RAMIREZ. SHE IS CLAIMING THAT IN THE 1980s WHEN HE WAS IN COLLEGE, THAT KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF TO HER AT A DRUNKEN COLLEGE PARTY AT YALE UNIVERSITY. RAMIREZ HERSELF WASN'T TOTALLY SURE IF KAVANAUGH WAS A PERPETRATOR. SHE BECAME "QUICKLY INEBRIATED" AT THE PARTY, HER WORDS. SHE TOLD THE NEW YORKER THAT SHE WASN'T "FOGGY AND SLURRING HER WORDS." SHE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES SHE HAD SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAP FROM THAT EVENING. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SPENT OVER A WEEK TRYING TO CORROBORATE HER STORY, TALKING TO DOZENS OF PEOPLE, AND OF THE TIME SAID THIS, "THEY HAVE INTERVIEWED SEVERAL DOZEN PEOPLE OVER THE PAST WEEK IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORROBORATE HER STORY. THEY COULD FIND NO ONE WITH FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE. MS. RAMIREZ HERSELF CONTACTED FORMER YALE CLASSMATES ASKING IF THEY RECALL THE INCIDENT AND TOLD SOME OF THEM THAT SHE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN THAT MR. KAVANAUGH WAS THE ONE WHO EXPOSED HIMSELF. AND THOSE WHO REMARRY IS LISTED AS WITNESSES IN YET ANOTHER CASE HERE, WELCOME TO THE INDECENT CHARGES? THEY ARE ALL FLATLY DENYING. IF THE INCIDENT DEBBIE ALLEGES EVER OCCURRED, WE WOULD HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ABOUT IT. BUT WE HAVE NOT. THE BEHAVIOR SHE DESCRIBES WOULD BE COMPLETELY OUT OF CHARACTER FOR BRETT. IN ADDITION, SOME OF US KNEW DEBBIE LONG AFTER YALE AND SHE NEVER DESCRIBES THIS INCIDENT UNTIL HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINATION WAS PENDING. THE NEW YORKER ALSO INTERVIEWED RAMIREZ'S BEST FRIEND AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT AND SHE'S ALSO DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLAIMS. AND SHE SAID IT "THIS WAS A WOMAN KNOWS BEST FRIEND WITH, WE SHARED INTIMATE DETAILS OF HER, OUR LIVES. I WAS NEVER TOLD THE STORY BY HER OR ANYONE ELSE. I NEVER SAW IT OR HEARD OF IT HAPPENING." JUDGE KAVANAUGH ALSO DENIED EMPHATICALLY THESE DECADE-OLD CHARGES. IN A STATEMENT HE WROTE "THESE ARE SMEARS, PURE AND SIMPLE AND THEY DEBASE OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE. BUT THEY ARE ALSO A THREAT TO ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO WISHES TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY. SUCH GROTESQUE AND OBVIOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS, IF ALLOWED TO SUCCEED, IT WILL DISSUADE COMPETENT AND GOOD PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS FROM SERVICE. AS I TOLD THE COMMITTEE DURING THE HEARING, A FEDERAL JUDGE MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT SWAYED BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL PRESSURE. THAT'S A KIND OF JUDGE I WOULD ALWAYS BE AND AND AT THE VIOLENCE AGAINST MY FAMILY WOULD NOT DRIVE THEM OUT. KAVANAUGH DENIED THESE CHARGES IN HIS INTERVIEW WITH MARTHA. TAKE A LOOK. Judge Kavanaugh: I NEVER DID ANY SUCH THING. THE OTHER PEOPLE ALLEGED TO BE THERE DON'T RECALL ANY SUCH THING. IF SUCH A THING HAD HAPPENED, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TALK OF CAMPUS. THE WOMEN I KNEW IN COLLEGE, AND THE MEN I KNEW IN COLLEGE THAT IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT I COULD HAVE DONE SUCH A THING, AND "THE NEW YORK TIMES" HAS REPORTED THAT JUST LAST WEEK THE PERSON MAKING THE ACCUSATION WAS CALLING OTHER CLASSMATES, SAYING SHE WAS NOT SURE THAT AND I HAD DONE THIS. AGAIN, JUST ASKING FOR A FAIR PROCESS WHERE I CAN BE HEARD AND I CAN DEFEND MY INTEGRITY. Sean: DURING THIS INTERVIEW HE TOOK IT EVEN A STEP FURTHER. WATCH THIS. Judge Kavanaugh: PEOPLE GENERALLY IN HIGH SCHOOL, I THINK ALL OF US HAVE LOOKED BACK ON THINGS AND REGRETTED OR CRINGED A BIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ANYONE. I NEVER HAVE DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Martha: SO ALL THESE YEARS IN QUESTION, YOU ARE A? Judge Kavanaugh: THAT'S CORRECT. Martha: YOU NEVER HAD INTERCOURSE WITH ANYONE IN HIGH SCHOOL? Judge Kavanaugh: AND MANY YEARS AFTER. Sean: THEN HE WENT ON TO DEFEND HIS CHARACTER IN HIGH SCHOOL. Martha: WAS THERE EVER A TIME YOU DRINK SO MUCH SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT BEFORE? WOMEN BEING TAKEN INTO ROOMS AND OR HAVING WITH A NUMBER OF MEN, CONSENSUAL OR OTHERWISE, WAS NOT GOING ON AT THE PARTY'S ERRATIC? Judge Kavanaugh: I NEVER SAW ANY SUCH THING. I CERTAINLY NEVER PARTICIPATED IN ANY SUCH THING BUT I NEVER SAW OR HEARD OF ANY SUCH THING. I WAS FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BE NUMBER ONE IN MY CLASS AND BEING CAPTAIN OF THE VARSITY BASKETBALL TEAM, AND IT DURING MY SERVICE PROJECTS, AND GOING TO CHURCH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME I SPENT IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS STUDYING, OR FOCUSED ON SPORTS AND BEING A GOOD FRIEND TO THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS THAT I WAS FRIENDS WITH. WE HAVE THESE GREAT LIFELONG FRIENDSHIPS. Sean: DESPITE ALL THESE CHARGES, JUDGE KAVANAUGH SAYS HE WILL NOT BE QUIET AND HE'S VOWING NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED INTO WITHDRAWING HIS NOMINATION. WHILE JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS STANDING FIRM, RIGHTLY DEMANDING A FAIR PROCESS, IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE TOLD THAT IT ALSO TAKES ON A FAMILY. AGAIN, WHERE IS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE? LET'S TAKE A LOOK. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS, AND THEY KNOW BRETT AND THEY KNOW, WE TOLD HIM AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS THAT IT'S NOT FUN SOMETIMES. HE WILL HEAR THINGS THAT PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY, AND JUST REMEMBER, YOU KNOW YOUR DAD. Sean: NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS STANDING BY HIS NOMINEE AND PREDICTED HER EARLIER TONIGHT THAT HE WILL BE CONFIRMED. LOOK AT THIS. IT WILL BE SAD INDEED IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO REROUTE THAT. THIS IS A FINE MAN AND CERTAINLY HOPE HE'S GOING TO BE CONFIRMED AND QUICKLY. HIS FAMILY HAS SUFFERED. WHAT IS GOING ON IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN. BRETT KAVANAUGH IS AN ABSOLUTE OUTSTANDING PERSON AND HOPEFULLY, HE WILL BE CONFIRMED QUICKLY. Sean: THIS ALL COMES AS ONE FALLS RUMOR HAS BEEN DEBUNKED. MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS WERE GLEEFULLY SPREADING A RUMOR THAT FEMALE STUDENTS WERE COACHED BY A LAW PROFESSOR ON HOW TO DRESS IN AN OUTGOING WAY WHEN THEY WERE INTERVIEWING WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH, A RUMOR THAT THE PROFESSOR HAS COMPLETELY DENIED. AT IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE JUST SHOWED YOU, THEIR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL. DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE ON THE LEFT, THEY HAVE ALREADY CONVICTED JUDGE KAVANAUGH. ACCORDING TO THEM HE HAS KNOWN PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND NO RIGHT TO BE HEARD, NO REASON TO BE BELIEVED, NO DUE PROCESS. ACTUALLY, THERE WERE LAWMAKERS, LAWMAKERS THAT WERE THROWING LAW OUT THE WINDOW AND CLAIMING HIS GUILT BY ACCUSATION. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY. TAKE A LOOK. THE SENATE SHOULDN'T RELY ON TO CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS AND DECIDE, WE ARE OKAY WITH NOT KNOWING, WE ARE OKAY WITH THE FACT THAT WE MIGHT BE PUTTING SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED ATTEMPTED RAPE. I BELIEVE HER. ANYONE WHO COMES FORWARD AT THIS POINT TO BE PREPARED TO TESTIFY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IS BEING NOMINATED TO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, THAT TAKES AN EXTRA ORDINARY AMOUNT OF COURAGE. NOT ONLY DO WOMEN LIKE DR. FORD WHO BRAVELY COME FORWARD NEED TO BE HER TO COME UP BUT THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED. THEY NEED TO BE BELIEVED. I WANT TO SAY TO THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY, SHUT UP AND STEP UP, DO THE RIGHT THING. LET ME SAY RIGHT AT THE OUTSET, I BELIEVE DR. FORD. I BELIEVE THE SURVIVOR HERE. THERE'S EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE HER. SHE HAS COME FORWARD COURAGEOUSLY AND BRAVELY. I BELIEVE WITH HER AND I STAND WITH HER. SO IF SHE SHOWS UP ON MONDAY I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD BE BULLIED INTO THE SCENARIO, IT'S A SHAM HEARING AND I DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN IT. I BELIEVE PROFESSOR FORD. I THINK SHE'S CREDIBLE AND I THINK WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS FINISHED AND WHEN SHE TESTIFIES AND WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIES, I THINK A MAJORITY OF SENATORS WILL FIND HER CREDIBLE. AND I DON'T THINK I NEVER THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOULD GET APPOINTED. NO PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. AT THE VERY SAME TIME, ALL THE PEOPLE YOU ARE WATCHING HERE, WE HAVE A CASE NOT 36 OR SEVEN OR FIVE YEARS AGO, BUT KEITH ELLISON, THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT THE DNC HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF REPEATED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND THE DNC HAS SMEARED AND SLANDERED AND IGNORED THE PERSON MAKING THAT ALLEGATION. THAT WAS BACK IN AUGUST. THIS YEAR. SO WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING IS A DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLAYING POLITICS, SADLY EXPLOITING A CONDUCT ALLEGATION ACCUSATION, THAT'S IT, FOR POLITICAL GAIN. JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS AND RUSHING TO JUDGMENT. THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS. BUT TONIGHT EVERY AMERICAN, REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT, CONSERVATIVE AND LIBERAL. THIS IS WHY YOU NEED A HEALTHY DOSE OF SKEPTICISM. LET ME TELL YOU WHY. DEBORAH KATZ HAS VIEWS ON SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY POLITICAL AND INCONSISTENT AT BEST. FOR EXAMPLE, SHE SAID THIS ABOUT PAULA JONES. NOBODY IN THE MEDIA REPORTS IT. PAULA JONES' SUIT IS VERY, VERY WEAK AND, NOT BY HER OWN TESTIMONY HAD LASTED TEN OR 12 MINUTES. SHE SUFFERED NO REPERCUSSIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. SHE SAID, CLEARLY A ONE-TIME INCIDENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN 10-12 MINUTES, SHE LEFT OF HER OWN VOLITION, AND THE COURTS ARE FINDING THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT CLAIM. SHE ALSO SET OF CREEPY SENATOR AL FRANKEN "CONTEXT IS RELEVANT. HE DID NOT DO THIS AS A MEMBER THE U.S. SENATE." YES HE DID. AND BY THE WAY HE DID THIS IN THE CAPACITY OF SOMEONE WHO IS STILL FUNCTIONING AS AN ENTERTAINER. CLEARLY, PROFESSOR FORD'S ATTORNEY HAS A LEFT-WING RADICAL INCONSISTENT POLITICAL AGENDA, AND "THE DAILY CALLER" EVEN UNCOVERED BACK IN 2017. AND WE HAVE THE TAPE. HERE IT IS. FINALLY OVER THE FINISH LINE COME UP WITH A GENERAL GRATEFUL TO THE COLLEAGUES WHO WENT FOR HIM. I CAN'T APPRECIATE, EXPRESS HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO STOOD BY ME DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. IT WAS A A BITTER FEUD TO THE VERY END. GOING TO FIGHT BACK, GOING TO RESIST. WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT PROFESSOR FORD IS ADDING ANOTHER PERSON TO HIS LEGAL TEAM, AN ATTORNEY NAMED MICHAEL BROMWICH. HE'S THE LAWYER REPRESENTING FIRED FBI DIRECTOR ANDREW McCABE. THIS BRINGS US TO OUR HANNITY HISTORY LESSON SURROUNDING THE DEMOCRATIC PLAYBOOK. EVERY ELECTION CYCLE, AND THEY ARE LITERALLY NAMING THE CHARACTER OF THE POLITICAL OPPONENTS, EVEN IF IT MEANS LYING IN THE PROCESS. THEY DEMONIZE ALL CONSERVATIVES. THERE'S NOT A CONSERVATIVE THAT I KNOW THAT HAS NOT BEEN THROUGH THIS. IN FACT EVERY FOUR YEARS, EVERY TWO YEARS, REPUBLICANS ARE RACIST, MISOGYNISTIC, HOMOPHOBIC, ISLAMOPHOBIC. THEY WANT DIRTY AIR AND WATER, THEY WANT TO KILL YOUR CHILDREN AND THROW GRANNY OVER A CLIFF. THE LEFT HAS ALSO RUSHED TO JUDGMENT IN THE WAKE OF OTHER MAJOR EVENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN WRONG. ON THIS PROGRAM THEY'VE BEEN RIGHT. WE DIDN'T RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN THE DUKE LACROSSE CASE. REMEMBER THE SUMMER OLYMPICS AND BOMBING? REMEMBER BECAUSE HE SAID HE FIT THE PROFILE OF A LOAN BOMBER, BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHE MOTHER. RICHARD JULES LISTENING TO MY RADIO SHOW WAS A LOCALHOST IN ATLANTA AT THE TIME. HE MUST THINK ME FOR BEING THE ONLY ONE NOT TO RUSH TO JUDGMEN JUDGMENT. REMEMBER THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN BALTIMORE, WITH FREDDIE GRAY? NEVER WHEN OBAMA SAID THE CAMBRIDGE BELIEF ACTED STUPIDLY? WE HAVE ON THIS PROGRAM ADOPTED THE "WE WILL NOT RUSH TO JUDGMENT. WE WILL WAIT AND WE WILL SEE." ON THE DUKE LACROSSE KIDS I WENT TO MEET WITH THEIR PARENTS AND I MET WAS GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S ATTORNEY AND THAT GEORGE ZIMMERMAN AND ASKED HIM TOUGH QUESTIONS. YOU SEE HAD NOW COME EVERY TIME THERE IS A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, AND THAT'S THE REPUBLICAN APPOINTS HIM. WE WE SOUGHT JUDGE BORK, AND MITT ROMNEY WAS SEXIST. HE HAD BINDERS FULL OF WOMEN'S RESUMES. REMEMBER THEY TURN HIS EFFORTS TO HIRE WOMEN INTO AN ATTACK ABOUT HIM BEING SEXIST. MITT ROMNEY WAS NOT. WHENEVER THEY HAD FALSELY ACCUSED HIM, REMEMBER HARRY REI HARRY REID, AND HE HAD NO REAL REGRETS ABOUT SPENDING THOSE LIES AND FALSE ATTACKS. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THIS IS WHY AMERICAN DUTIES HAVE A DUTY TO SKEPTICAL. WE SEE IT EVERY TWO YEARS, EVERY FOUR YEARS, EVERY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AND EVERY BIG HIGH-PROFILE CASE THAT THEY POLITICIZE. HERE'S A LOOK AT HAIRY REDA. LET HIM PROVE THAT HE HAS PAID TAXES, BECAUSE HE HASN'T. I DON'T REGRET THAT AT ALL. NO ONE WOULD HELP ME, SO I DID IT ON MY OWN. NO REGRETS ABOUT ROMNEY OR THE COAT BROTHERS. I REGRET TELLING A TOTAL LIE AND SMEARING SOMEBODY. FROM MITT ROMNEY TO ROBERT BORK TO CLARENCE THOMAS TO GEORGE BUSH, FRANKLY EVERY A CONSERVATIVE I KNOW, I WAS BEEN FORCED TO DEAL WITH THEIR LIFE AND SOME OF THESE BASELESS CHARACTER SMEARS AND CHARACTER ASSASSINATIONS. THAT IS TO CALL REPUBLICANS RACIST AND IT HAPPENS EVERY REPUBLICAN SEASON. MANY REPUBLICANS TALK IN CODED RACIAL LANGUAGE ABOUT TAKERS AND LOSERS. THEY DEMONIZE AT PRESIDENT OBAMA AND ENCOURAGE THE UGLIEST IMPULSES OF THE PARANOID FRENCH. YOU EXPECT THE SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT , YOU WILL ACCEPT THE CLAN SYMPATHIZERS BEFORE YOU ARE PRESIDENT , YOU WILL ACCEPT THR SUPPORT AFTER THEY ARE PRESIDENT? HE WILL LET THEM WRITE THEIR OWN RULES. UNCHAINED WALL STREET. THEY WILL PUT YOU ALL BACK IN CHAINS. IT'S WRONG WHAT THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THIS CONGRESS ARE DOING AND BLOCKING AN ACCURATE CENSUS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO COUNT EVERYONE THAT THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN COUNT ON. THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, IF YOU CAN DUNK THE BASKETBALL OR A SINK A THREE-POINT SHOT. BUT THEY ARE NOT IN FAVOR OF IT IF YOU MERELY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A LEADER IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. DON'T TELL ME WE HAVE A COLOR-BLIND SOCIETY. 2-7, WHEN GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH REFUSED TO SUPPORT HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION, IT WAS LIKE MY FATHER WAS KILLED ALL OVER AGAIN. WHEN YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU LET ANOTHER CHURCH EXPLODE. WHEN YOU DON'T VOTE, YOU ALLOW ANOTHER CROSS TO BURN. REAL SMEARS, REAL CHARACTER ASSASSINATION, AND IT HAPPENS PREDICTABLY EVERY ELECTION SEASON AND IT HAPPENS WITH SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. THIS IS A GUTTER POLITICS AT ITS WORST AND SADLY, WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THESE TACTICS AS WE NOW MARCH 43 DAYS OR SO TOWARDS THE MIDTERMS. WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE ON THIS IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST BREAKING TODAY IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN IS HANGING ONTO HIS JOB, AT LEAST FOR NOW. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ISSUED ON REPORT ACCUSING ROD ROSENSTEIN, AND THEY ARE STICKING BY IT, OF PLOTTING TO RALLY CABINET OFFICIALS AND INVOKED THE 25TH AMENDMENT.
