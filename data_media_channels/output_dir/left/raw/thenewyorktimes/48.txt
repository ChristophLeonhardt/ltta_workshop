1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,890
I’m Nicole Holofcener.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,680
And I adapted the book
and directed the movie,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,120
"The Land of Steady Habits."

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,510
This is Ben Mendelsohn
playing Anders Hill.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,210
He’s left his wife and
moved into a condo.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,920
And while he was drunk,
he told the cab driver

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,320
his old address.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,690
And when they pulled up, he
didn’t realize where he was.

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,450
And then he decided
to go in anyway.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,410
What the hell?

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,090
I wanted this scene —

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,610
it’s not in the book —

13
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:31,560
and I wanted to see
Anders enjoy being a jerk.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,064
But he sort of wears his
jerkiness with pride.

15
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,020
"Who the ____ is in my house?

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,345
Jesus Christ, Anders."

17
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:44,590
And he makes a
fool of himself.

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,574
And I think that
it always helps

19
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,990
when a character is drunk, if
they need to make a fool out

20
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,770
of themselves.

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,295
And Ben plays a
terrific drunk.

22
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,557
“You can’t just come in here."

23
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:56,700
“I’m getting some things
that are rightfully mine."

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,555
“No, you’re drunk."

25
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:00,140
“Some of this stuff,
I have a right

26
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,435
to have it in my house."

27
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,450
“I left a whole box
of stuff for you

28
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,302
over here by the door."

29
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,724
“Then what’s all this?"

30
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:08,973
“I gave you half."

31
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:12,416
And I feel he played
a very subtle drunk.

32
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,225
“Oh."

33
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,110
So he breaks into
the house and he

34
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,340
goes straight into
the refrigerator

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,750
and doesn’t
recognize anything.

36
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,740
I wanted really like
airy, fairy healthy crap

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,655
in the freezer that would
not have been in his house.

38
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:28,290
We shoot the refrigerator.

39
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,660
I think we had a
fake light in it.

40
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,440
Because the
refrigerator is noisy.

41
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,680
So we turn it off for
the sound department.

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,390
And by the time we
got to the next scene,

43
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,550
where he’s eating a
Popsicle, the refrigerator

44
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,260
had been turned off.

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,720
And the Popsicles just
kept cracking in half

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,100
and falling on the floor.

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,000
That was pretty sad.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,930
It was like, what happened?

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,830
Why don’t they freeze?

50
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,580
Why don’t they freeze?

51
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,246
And then we realized
the prop department

52
00:01:52,246 --> 00:00:00,000
didn’t realize that they had
not turned the power back on.
