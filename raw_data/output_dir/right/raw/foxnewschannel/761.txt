1
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:14,328
JUDGE JEANINE: I READ RECENTLY

2
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:16,163
THAT KIM KARDASHIAN MAY BE

3
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:18,165
TAKING A BREAK FROM TAKING

4
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:18,632
SELFIES.

5
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:21,168
BUT IT PUT ME IN A SELFIE FRAME

6
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,269
OF MIND.

7
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:25,439
NATIONAL SELFIE DAY I HIT THE

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,108
STREETS WITH STREET JUSTICE.

9
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:28,943
HERE I AM IN NEW YORK TRYING TO

10
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:30,511
FIGURE OUT IF NEW YORKERS ARE

11
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:33,381
GOING TO GIVE UP DOING SELFIES

12
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,816
SINCE KIM KARDASHIAN IS NO

13
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,718
LONGER HIGH ON SELFIES.

14
00:00:37,718 --> 00:00:39,587
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:43,557
WANT TO TAKE A SELFIE?

16
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:45,559
KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT

17
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,895
TAKING THEM THAT MUCH ANYMORE.

18
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,132
>> THAT'S A LIE.

19
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:52,566
JUDGE JEANINE: WHY?

20
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,236
BECAUSE SHE IS SO SELF-ABSORBED

21
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,638
SHE WANTS TO SEE HERSELF.

22
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:01,075
DO PEOPLE SMILE, DO THEY SMOOCH?

23
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:07,715
>> SMILE.

24
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:10,351
JUDGE JEANINE: LET'S TAKE A

25
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,786
SELFIE.

26
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:14,655
KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT

27
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:16,724
TAKING SELFIES THAT MUCH.

28
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:19,193
DO YOU THINK SHE CAN GET THROUGH

29
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:21,595
THE DAY WITHOUT TAKING PICTURES

30
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,363
OF HERSELF.

31
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:25,266
>> SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE

32
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,467
TAKING PICTURES OF HER SHE

33
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:29,003
DOESN'T NEED TO DO IT HERSELF.

34
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,238
JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU TAKE

35
00:01:31,238 --> 00:01:31,572
SELFIES?

36
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:38,212
>> NO.

37
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,447
JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU KNOW WHAT

38
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,981
A SELFIE IS?

39
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,716
>> YES.

40
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:45,286
JUDGE JEANINE: IT'S ON VIDEO.

41
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:47,455
WATCH IT.

42
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,523
KIM KARDASHIAN SAYS SHE IS NOT

43
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,225
TAKING SELFIES ANYMORE.

44
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,761
>> OH, PLEASE, NEVER.

45
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,497
I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT.

46
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,332
I CAN'T IMAGINE HER STAYING OUT

47
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:00,034
OF THE LIMELIGHT.

48
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:03,103
JUDGE JEANINE: WHAT MAKES A GOOD

49
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:03,437
SELFIE?

50
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:07,908
>> GOING HIGHER THAN YOURSELF.

51
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,243
JUDGE JEANINE: LIKE THIS?

52
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:16,283
>> IT PROJECTS AMAZING LIGHT.

53
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,718
JUDGE JEANINE: WHY WOULDN'T YOU

54
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:19,286
WANT TO LOOK BETTER THAN YOU

55
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:21,489
LOOK IN PERSON, THEN WHEN PEOPLE

56
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,591
MEET YOU THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED.

57
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,894
>> YOU HIDE IN YOUR ROOM AND

58
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,229
MAKE EVERYONE THINK YOU ARE

59
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:29,096
BEAUTIFUL.

60
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:31,198
JUDGE JEANINE: SHOULD YOU SMILE?

61
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:34,335
>> A LOT OF GIRLS GO FOR THE

62
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:35,436
DUCK FACE.

63
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:37,671
JUDGE JEANINE: HOW MANY SELFIES

64
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,041
DOES IT TAKE TO GET THE PERFECT

65
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:41,375
SELFIE?

66
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,512
>> AT LEAST 100.

67
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,280
JUDGE JEANINE: DO YOU KNOW HOW

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,483
MANY SELFIES IT TAKES TO GET A

69
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:52,186
PERFECT SELFIE?

70
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:54,188
WHO HAS THAT KIND OF TIME?

71
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:56,357
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN SELFIES?

72
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:59,827
>> YES, BUT I DON'T SHARE THEM.

73
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:03,531
JUDGE JEANINE: YOU MAKE THEM FOR

74
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:03,898
YOURSELF?

75
00:03:03,898 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT'S A SELFIE.
