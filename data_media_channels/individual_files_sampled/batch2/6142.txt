an enormous majority of Americans want gun control there are certainly debates about what degree of gun control but a universal background check so for example to get rid of the gun show loophole polls at over 90 percent so especially with the country in a rage now over the another school shooting another massacre on Valentine's Day this appears to be a good time for the Democrats to say all right we're gonna stand up for progressive values here because it would be a wonderful thing to do for the American people it is the right thing to do in policy and it would be the right thing to do politically so are the Democrats going to do that now if you know the establishment Democrats unfortunately you know the rest of the story the answer is of course not so here's a headline from a story in the pit in the paper today in the hill Dems want gun control but worried it could cost them the midterms oh-oh they are repulsive why will progressives just bow their heads and unify behind the Coward corporate democrats gee I can't tell her I wonder why here let's go to the heart of the story and tell you why they won't fight on this issue there unreal they're unreal as the issue continues to dominate the headlines some Democrats back an understated approach of course they do God forbid they should fight hard particularly with vulnerable Democrats like senators Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin up for reelection in red states get him out get him out get him out I hope to god they lose in primaries in general elections look i republicans are low some and i don't want them to win but if it turns out a couple of really conservative democrats are preventing the rest of the democratic party from fighting hard then they are doing more harm than good well I mean because I don't want Joe Manchin who's incredibly conservative to lose a seat on his behalf we're gonna power down the whole Democratic Party at the national level oh for God's sake by the way look if that was true I'd be I don't know if I'd be angry or less agree I think less angry I'll tell you why it's an excuse they don't want to do anything they get paid to lose so they're like well look over 90% of Americans agree with us so how how do we lose this one well they figured out a way okay so as Senate democratic aide says quote it's certainly more of a base issue than in years past do you know what that means I'll decipher for you because I speak politics it means I mean all the senators are not progressive they don't care at all so this is what the base cares about oh they're so annoying these progressive voters we have that actually want progressive policy positions it's more of a base issue this year than it used to be we used to be able to ignore this with no problem but now the progressive base hounds us and makes us actually work for a living a little bit I'm so sorry to have bothered you okay here's another former Democratic leadership aide he says how do you keep from having a conversation about sensible changes to be turned into they want to take your guns away so in other words he said well the problem is if we go to do any gun control even one backed by 90% of Americans will say oh they're just trying to take your guns away he says so obviously we have to give up how would we fight back you would use this thing called a mouse it actually can emit words you would actually fight back by saying other things oh wow they never thought about that they're like what the Republicans will say this well that you say that you counter them you moron you coward you go oh hey the Republicans say that we're trying to take your guns away but we're not we're doing sensible gun control that 93% of Americans agree with wow that was so hard so hard yeah you might as well just surrender instead I can't tell why people loathes establishment Democrats I can't tell it but they really can't in Washington they are perplexed they're like why does the progressive base there is so much we just wanted to just get back into our comfy little beds and surrender already why won't you let us surrender okay Meredith Kellis spokeswoman for the House Democrats campaign arm Oh said the party has no plan for a national messaging strategy on gun reform citing the geographically and culturally diverse house battlefields for God's sake man look we understand politics so if you're running in New York you might run on a more pro gun control platform if you're running in the middle of Montana you might not and those candidates might do different things we're perfectly aware of that but that doesn't mean that you have to do unilateral disarmament almost literal in this case at a national level so what is that create it creates Republicans who go on TV non-stop oh they're taking your guns away they're taking your guns away Second Amendment Second Amendment Second Amendment NRA is awesome these are American rights and whatever what are the Democrats what do you say nothing nothing no idea I can't might lose in North Dakota joe Manchin my donors opes that I say that Ella whatever I don't know I just want to go back to bed so at the national level they will have no messaging on guns they are the worst of the worst the Republicans are so deeply corrupt they take all that NRA money and then they work at their behalf no matter how many kids get shot in how many schools but the Democrats and their surrender to those loathsome people or arguably maybe even lower them them now of course it's not every Democrat and there are progressives who fight back but unfortunately the majority of the establishment Democrats will not fight they will have no national messaging on this by the way if you want more polls I'll give you more oppose one that just came out a political morning console poll conducted after the deadly shooting last week at a Florida high school finds 64% of respondents are in favor of tougher gun control OHS now that's not the specific universal background check that says over 90 percent that is in general in general they say oh they're trying to take your guns away you say no I want tougher gun control OHS you have 64% of country on your side if you can't win with two-thirds of the country behind you please retire please please let progressives run instead get out of the way get out of the way you miserable losers by the way the polls who found the 45% of Republicans said they would support tougher gun laws you've got almost half the Republicans on your side and you still won't fight one last one among Democrats eighty-four percent support stricter gun laws compared with just 13% who oppose them but almost all of their politicians are in that 13% so yes some fight back Chris Murphy almost all the progressive senators and however little there are of them and and and members some members of the Progressive Caucus etcetera but the majority of the Democrats are the establishment Democrats and ago eighty-four percent of my voters wanted even half the Republican voters wanted I don't care Joe Manchin says no by the apology Swearengen is running against Joe Manchin in West Virginia go out there in the primers go in the primaries in every race primaries are more important than general elections get rid of these bums you if you don't vote in primaries you're you're you don't care about this country if you care about being a progressive and you care about rescuing this country you must vote in primaries to vote these bums out and put real progressives that are uncorrupted to represent you justice Tavarez calm that is one group there are other groups but the just Democrats don't take corporate packs Paulie G Swearengen and guests Manchin get rid of a bomb get rid of the bomb if he's holding back all Progress primary the living hell out of all of them and let them cry oh they don't like me I keep surrendering to Republicans but I can't figure out why they don't like me we don't like you
