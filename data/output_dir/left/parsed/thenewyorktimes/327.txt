As soon as they laid her on
my chest, I felt the weight.
From the first time I saw her,
I wanted her to have everything.
But subconsciously, I knew
I didn’t have it in me.
I peed on a stick alone
in a stall at McDonald’s.
And I watched the
line turn pink.
I loved being young and feeling
like anything was possible.
And I knew in that
instant, that I was never
going to feel that again.
Having an abortion
was never an option.
I was 17, a minor.
The laws in Ohio
made it so I had
to have my parents’ consent.
And asking them felt a lot
harder than telling them I
was pregnant.
I just always did what I
felt I was supposed to do —
had the baby, took care
of her, went to college.
But inside, I didn’t feel
connected to motherhood at all.
I just felt lost, and then
guilty for feeling lost.
I felt like I was
failing, but then,
wanted to blame it
on somebody else.
It took me a long time
to admit that I actually
resented Maya for existing,
because that felt so wrong.
Years from now, she could
easily tell her therapist,
“My mom made it clear
that I was a mistake.
My mom made it clear
that I ruined her life.”
And I couldn’t really
argue with that.
I always have these
three words in my head, like,
strong, and
independent, and woman.
I wanted those words
to be attached to her.
When I was pregnant, I
had found a book of poems
by Maya Angelou.
In that collection was her
poem “Phenomenal Woman."
That’s when I confirmed that
I would name Maya, Maya.
And I like to think
she’s phenomenal.
I look at her and, I feel like
there is some sort of balance
or fairness in the universe.
I believe again in something.
She’s everything I wasn’t —
the possibilities, and hopes,
and dreams that I
used to be full of.
But I regret that I
was never the mother
my daughter deserved.
I regret that, even
though I made my peace
and can be much more present
now, that it took this long
and that so much damage
was done in the meantime.
I regret that the line between
wanting everything for her
and speaking of my life with
such resentment is a fine one.
I sometimes dream
I’m childless and free
and I regret having the dream
and loving the dream equally.
When I looked at my mother,
my grandmother,
and my great-grandmother,
I just saw women who 
were burdened,
women who weren't free.
I was just intent on having
another kind of life.
