1
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,411
>> Tucker: NASA ANNOUNCED IT

2
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,378
HAS DISCOVERED ORGANIC MATERIAL

3
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:15,446
THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF LIFE ALL

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:17,548
THE WAY ON MARS BUT THAT'S NOT

5
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:18,916
THE ONLY FASCINATING SPACE

6
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,284
RELATED NEWS TO COME OUT

7
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:21,318
RECENTLY.

8
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:22,286
ACCORDING TO A NEWLY LEAKED

9
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,922
PENTAGON REPORT, AND 2004 A U.S.

10
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:28,025
AIRCRAFT CARRIER WAS STOCKED FOR

11
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:31,295
SEVERAL DAYS BY A UFO BY

12
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,496
WITNESSES WHO SAID IT RESEMBLED

13
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,932
EIGHT SUPERSONIC TIC TAC, IT

14
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:35,666
COULD MAKE ITSELF INVISIBLE.

15
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,102
THIS SHOCKED AND CONFUSED NAVY

16
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:44,408
PILOTS WHO MONITORED IT.

17
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:47,778
NEXT, WHY WOULD INFORMATION ON

18
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:49,146
THIS -- WHY WOULD WE NEED TO

19
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:50,915
READ ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT WAS

20
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:51,248
LEAKED?

21
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:52,783
WHY ONE TO THE U.S. TELL US

22
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:57,888
THIS, IS THERE SOME REASON?

23
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:59,757
>> I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS

24
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:01,125
EMBARRASSMENT ON ANYTHING IN OUR

25
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,462
AIRSPACE THE PERFORMANCE FACTORS

26
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:05,896
SIX EXCEED IN OUR INVENTORY.

27
00:01:05,896 --> 00:01:07,765
IF THAT WAS THE CONCLUSION IN

28
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:09,333
THIS PENTAGON DOCUMENT, THIS

29
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,136
THING RAN RINGS AROUND OUR F-18

30
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:13,437
SUPER HORNETS THAT TRIED TO

31
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:15,539
CHASE THIS THING, IT WAS BRIEFLY

32
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,474
TRACKED ON RADAR BUT IT SEEMS TO

33
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:19,710
BE ABLE TO -- AGAIN IT'S A

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,412
PHRASE FROM THE DOCUMENT IT'S

35
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:22,446
ALMOST LIKE IT CLOAKED ITSELF

36
00:01:22,446 --> 00:01:25,116
AND BECAME INVISIBLE.

37
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:26,851
YOU'D THINK THIS WAS A SCIENCE

38
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,585
FICTION IF YOU WEREN'T READING

39
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:30,654
IT IN PENTAGON DOCUMENTS AND WE

40
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:33,224
KNOW NOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT

41
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:36,527
TOOK THIS VERY SERIOUSLY, THESE

42
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:39,230
THINGS ARE BE SEEING IN OUR

43
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,099
SKIES BY PILOTS TRACKED ON RADAR

44
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,067
AND IT'S A SERIOUS DEFENSE OF

45
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,369
NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE HERE.

46
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:47,338
>> Tucker: WE DON'T BELIEVE

47
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:48,472
THAT ANY OTHER COUNTRY POSSESSES

48
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:49,306
THE TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE AN

49
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:52,009
AIRCRAFT LIKE THIS.

50
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,745
>> ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

51
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:56,914
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WENT INTO

52
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,516
THIS REPORT WAS LOOKING TO SEE

53
00:01:58,516 --> 00:01:59,583
IF THIS SORT OF THING WAS ANY

54
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,887
THING IN OUR OWN INVENTORY AND

55
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:03,621
INDEED ANYTHING THAT ANY OTHER

56
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:06,690
NATION HAS.

57
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,292
WHEN I WAS INVESTIGATING UFOs

58
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,026
FOR THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, WE

59
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:09,827
KNEW THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS

60
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:16,133
WOULD TURN OUT TO BE SECRET

61
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,468
PROTOTYPE AIRCRAFT DRONES AND

62
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:17,835
MISSILES.

63
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,371
WE ALWAYS KNEW WHO HAS WHAT SO

64
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,308
YOU CAN ELIMINATE THAT.

65
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:25,943
>> Tucker: WHAT YOU ARE REALLY

66
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:26,644
SAYING IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

67
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:31,715
AND THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS

68
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,483
ESSENTIALLY CONCLUDED IT'S

69
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:33,350
SOMETHING NOT FROM THIS WORLD

70
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,420
THAT IS BEEN CHECKED ON RADAR

71
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,189
AND WATCHED BY PEOPLE WHO WATCH

72
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,291
AIRCRAFT FOR LIVING -- THIS IS

73
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:40,891
REAL.

74
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,459
>> IT IS REAL.

75
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,897
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T GO SO FAR

76
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:47,565
AS TO SAY THESE THINGS ARE

77
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,500
EXTRATERRESTRIAL BUT CERTAINLY

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,235
WHEN I WAS DOING THIS FOR THE

79
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,337
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OUR POLICY

80
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,238
STATEMENT SAID NEITHER DO WE

81
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:57,074
RULE OUT THAT POSSIBILITY.

82
00:02:57,074 --> 00:03:03,080
WE KEPT AN OPEN MIND ON THIS.

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,315
THEIR SPEEDS AND MANEUVERS ARE

84
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,250
IN EXCESS OF ANYTHING THAT

85
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,621
YOU'VE GOT, YOU ARE FORCED

86
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:13,390
ALMOST TO THINK THE UNTHINKABLE.

87
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,827
PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT

88
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:20,965
SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES AND

89
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,967
MILITARY CHIEFS OFTEN JUST SAID

90
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:23,968
UFOs AND THEY ROLLED THEIR

91
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:26,437
EYES AND IT WAS THE RIDICULE

92
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,873
FACTOR.

93
00:03:28,873 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME
