all right you guys how we looking at it we have any sound for you now guys not about the modem are you getting sound now nope how about now you guys have sound well you got to let me know cuz I'm not seeing it on this end and I've got do we have sound now guys well we're gonna try to get this again for you guys but still trying to make this work and I don't know where in the world we are trying to diagnose this for you so bear with me we think we might have it not sure but let's try to make this sound problem work again let's see we can make this work all right sound is good I'm being told are s awesome guys thank you yeah this uh we changed just so you know what's going on and I'll start over I was pretty much trying to diagnose sound hey guys we changed the way we were getting up on a youtube link it on at YouTube because we're having all those buffering problems that disappears to fix the problem but for some dumb reason it screwed the mics all up so I had to just restart the whole thing just do me a favor guys keep me poppin slug the t-shirt Linda do me a favor guys just keep me posted on the sound and the video quality I'm noticing our video quality looks a little bit more hi-def than I'd like and it's a little choppy but we'll fix that for tomorrow I don't wanna mess with it today alright something epic hey Australia something epic happened yesterday I know if you guys were watching the White House press briefing but John Gizzi a White House correspondent one of the guys in the press corps asked press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if she had any information on the president's meeting Georgia Ireland Nagasaki Australia New Zealand you guys are awesome so John cos he asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders had any information on the Prescott on the meeting between President Trump and Rand Paul where Rand Paul was gonna discuss revoking John Brennan former CIA director under Obama's security clearance and Sarah Huckabee Sanders kind of stunned the crowd when she said well the president's not only thinking about suspending John Brennan security clearance president is considering suspending the security clearances of clapper Comey McCabe Michael Hayden and Susan Rice in addition to John Brennan hello from Finland hello from Finland so the so Sara welcoming senators blows everybody away she says it's gonna suspend these security clearances of potentially six Obama administration employees Obama administration employees and appointees Manchester England how you doing and the course predictably the liberal press corps goes nuts oh isn't this the president punishing his political allies how could he do that well number one he number one and by the way blade not the rebel telling people to wait on a dead stream when the new stream was up that was me trying to diagnose the problem not realizing that YouTube was not was going to put up a second unique stream so that was me and me alone that told you to do that so the the press corps goes nuts right the liberal press corps oh the president punishing people the president's punishing Obama people but the dumbest commentary on this the absolute dumbest came from Jennifer Rubin over at The Washington Post that that fake conservative we've Norwich England in the house we have Scotland in the house awesome she did this entire moronic piece in The Washington Post in which she claims and I and I love I love how liberals like Jennifer Rubin masquerade his Conservatives but even better how they make these insane leaps she argued if you didn't see her piece of the Washington Post from yesterday that by removing the secure I feel Dumber for having read Rubens piece if but by removing their security clearances revoking their security clearances Donald Trump is somehow infringing their first amendment rights it is the dumbest argument I've ever heard now all of a sudden a security clearance is constitutionally guaranteed and protected oh and by the way you don't have First Amendment rights but for your security clearance now it sure seemed to me I don't know Jennifer Rubin the motivations stupidity or maybe it's more sinister maybe some of these people were her and the Washington Post's anonymous sources and the New York Times anonymous sources and without those security clearances without that access they can no longer be effective as anonymous sources Fredrik pace from New York State my old home state how's it going up there Cuomo driving you guys to nuts no blonde Melbourne Australia a Melbourne thanks for watching now URI on the edge says president can revoke anyone's security clearance he's their boss theoretically no not theoretically he's their boss you're dead spot on right on point one and you're being too mild on point too you mean is it I said Melbourne wrong is it Melbourne now am I saying it right maria diaz from Sydney Australia a lot of Australia we've got Birmingham we've got Telford UK this is awesome love hearing from you guys and remember right under where it says rebel media in yellow you can do a super chat you could donate and I'll talk about you as if you're the smartest person in the world for smarter than jennifer rubin from The Washington Post Jason Turner says haha had a security clearance but it was never guaranteed Oh exactly exactly and I saw these other morons out there making an argument that when you're at the level of John Brennan you have a security clearance for life for life even active duty CIA people have their clearances reviewed active duty FBI people active duty DEA people military people your Clarence your clearances are reviewed Dru risers from Toronto Canada hi drew another from Manchester no list area I believe I don't know I don't know but I believe by the mainstream media is because these people call me clapper Brennan McCabe Hayden rice and I'm sure others these were some of those well-placed anonymous sources anonymous sources close to the investigation anonymous sources close to the administration anonymous sources blah blah blah Oregon USA it's early in Oregon it's like 4:45 a.m. Mathew thanks for watching well evil bastard said if you have a security clearance opposed to tell random people on the internet that you have one dum-dum now you could tell people you have a security clearance there's nothing you're not prohibited from telling people you have a clearance in other words somebody doesn't have a clearance to know you have a clearance for example everybody who works in the FBI is a top secret clearance as an agent so if somebody goes on television as an FBI agent you see a bunch of guys in windbreakers and a crime scene that say FBI you know that each of them has a top secret clearance now it's Jason Turner exactly he says I've seen people have their clearances revoke simply because they have bad credit it's actually the number one reason clearances are revoked they can be revoked for any reason Jack McCloskey from Scotland how are you jack good morning bread from California Rebecca from Vegas dark Sun likes my t-shirt thanks yeah I love these trying t-shirts looking at a retro triumph right now but uh this is um this is ridiculous this notion that security clearances of her life and you can never lose them and and Edinburgh Scotland Wow not Nottingham UK London demons ah from London sentence to be con my regards and then second thought don't he is the bill de blasio of Europe but this notion that you have a security clearance for life and John Brennan is somehow entitled to his clearance and and all these people this is so dumb I don't even know where to begin I don't even know where to begin cat of the year says I like your setup thanks we got to get this video perfected now that we're streaming direct from YouTube we're not having the buffering problems because we're not going through a middleman but we're I don't like this choppiness it's not a good and accurate representation of the way I want this show to look so we'll get that worked out for you Isle of Skye Paul off we blackburn says don't mention the K word to a cockney I'm guessing you mean Sadiq Khan anyway Oh Paul Vic says my dad has to take a polygraph among other things every year so because of the security clearance he has not unique to only our third-party application and yeah I mean look if you have a security clearance I've got like I said I've got a good friend who's a senior federal agent when he moved from one home to another and the guy literally moved around the corners my neighbor and he moved a cheese it's got to be a four block walk I mean it's literally around this little lake we have in the neighborhood and he had to go in and answer you know some additional questions and just to keep his clearance in check if they don't mess around with security clearances then something that they take very lightly you know this is uh this is uh some some pretty sensitive stuff so I I don't know I don't know why there's just mass hysteria but I would love to see what happens when Trump does in fact pull these clearances I wanna try get some clarity today on they're not he it was a bluff or whether or not he's he's seriously considering pulling the clearances now diamond ghazzal says your clearance got taken when you retired that is unique to the agency the nation because I do know that friends of mine who leave federal law enforcement for example they get five years from the time their clients was last for nude so their clearance was renewed a year before they left they're gonna keep it for four years and they can do some consulting on the outside things of that nature and I notice our quality is not necessarily any better right now doing this direct from YouTube so if this doesn't get better I might just well I might just go back to the old way tomorrow and we'll test both of them but it's somebody found me hello it's not working it's working it's just I don't love the quality I'm seeing here on the stream again we're we've been having majorie well now I would look at a little bit better as far as I can see it seems to look a little better we're a little clearer but yeah they don't miss Rama clearances and these ludicrous assertions Jason Turner's right it's usually five years before lower clearance is up to ten years I know secret goes longer than top secret then depending if you're an sei with your TS but but point being we don't need to get into the minutiae of it's five years seven years ten years Jason you're right it's something that eventually goes away it's not lifetime and it's something that if you mess up you're gonna lose and if you're out there leaking if you're out there leaking meta tech is right you needed jobs having a clearance oh yeah really well-paying jobs and if you're out there leaky and if you're out there politicizing your clearance but worse if you're out there lying if you're john brennan the former director of the CIA and you're out there lying upon lying upon lying about the president colluding with russia and the president engaging in crime and the president doing this that and the other thing you don't deserve your clearance you don't deserve a clearance you don't deserve it and somebody asked me if there's any new info and tommy robinson check ezra's feed quite frankly that's his story he's in canada he's over he's been over in the UK with Tommy he's I'm trying to handle the us stories Ezra is really doing a great job on that leading on it and somebody saying they have no picture just a green background I would refresh I'm actually I've got the show open and a browser here in addition to my interface and it looks good to me let's see Matthew Hoffman says I was told by Portland police yes sir and it take down my Trump an American flag because it's distractive to other drivers really really can you reach out to me and let me know you can do the Twitter DM me or email me here at the rebel let me know where exactly that happened I'd like to reach out to the Portland Police and get some clarity on that well go quality 37 says John Brennan is a communist Muslim well we know he voted for a communist back in 1976 at the height of the Cold War when Russia was winning we know that good to hear it's perfectly clear the show in the UK yeah poor consciousness Portland is run by the lid tardes awesome but uh yeah I mean this soda go back to the topic at hand this whole notion that these people are allowed to use these clearances to go out there to leak to smear the administration is ridiculous but I'll take it a step further what john brennan is doing now is seditious john brennan should be hauled before the House Committee and the Senate committee now Bob Goodlatte the chairman of Senate Judiciary said as much he wants running before that committee he will subpoena Brennan to testify before that committee JC is saying the president deserves loyalty from his staff they cannot be loyal than the hell with their clearance Hey look these people aren't even the president's staff Brendan Obama guy call me an Obama guy that Trump fired McCabe but Obama loyalists a Hillary loyalist Michael Hayden was a bush guy Susan Rice and Obama person James clapper and Obama person so these aren't Trump's people these aren't Trump's people John Zeeland yeah that's exactly right as we said I'll be heading back to the UK as soon as it gets the word from Tommy's lawyers about the day of the court decision and that really is the update that's really the update yeah look David may ask should we trust Jeff Sessions no I think Jeff Sessions is useless and I think all those conspiracy theories trust the plan sessions the silent assassin well finally finally I hope they're all debunked hope is queuing on nonsense is seeing for what it is a Kirkland II that knows nothing because everything was fake yes David May is asking me is Q fake yes yes you saw the FISA warrant application renewals came while Jeff session was the Attorney General Rod Rosenstein plays Jeff Sessions like a cheap banjo Josh Carlin would your country be in a better situation if a woman had the helm I think our country's in a great situation Trump is doing an amazing job an amazing job yeah minitex askew is just fun to think about entertainment yes q is faked all those saying Q is in Vegas is fake if you look at what q reports and you go back for days you can find it pieced together from other reports has been dead wrong about everything dead wrong about everything the FISA application proves that all of these conspiracy there is telling you trust the plan and sessions the silent assassin and and Muller is a white hat and all these things are going on behind the scenes I don't know how things work it never worked inside the process q and on is not some super secret government agent okay it's like a guy in his mom's couch laughing that people are actually listening to the nonsense he pieces together from open source material that's it look I don't here's the thing people are asking me we'd better if there was a woman and there was what I don't care who's in power I don't give her the man or woman I give their white black Hispanic Asian purple just be tough and do a good job you're the president United States of America put America first you're the president of Canada put Canada first put business first put people first fortune Q comes from fortune or read it or write I don't care with their 297 B Ches I think they're all children so then literally think that like kids on their mom's couch well look if you uh maybe if you're if you're gonna lead any nation lead from the front don't be Obama don't be true though don't be the world's doormats don't be Merkel who floods your country with Muslim migrants with illegals yeah you know putting your own we know the guys name is faisal hussein they hid that name for quite a while for obvious reasons yes but they're already starting with the mental health and narrative his family is saying he had mental problems medication help look I don't know what happened and I'm not sure we're gonna get accurate information in Trudeau's Canada on the real motives but I will say that it's pretty peculiar to me the guys name was Faisal Hussain pretty pretty peculiar cope with Asano says what his skin color had to do with whether one can lead a country nothing nothing Obama was a disaster because he was a weak disaster had nothing to do with his race he was horrible Trudeau is the whitest guy in the world he's a disaster Merkel is white she's a disaster so Paul dick me MWR I had an hour 1200 RT tear the RT 1200 or the R 1200 RT because I got rid of my R 1200 RT also had a Street Glide that I sold it was too hot and I wasn't riding much in Florida Harley Street Glide but I'm probably picking up another Harley Suzuki gs-7 fifties fast bike Jeff Jones nice bike look the no no race gender doesn't really matter to me doesn't really matter to me be effective puts people first cat boys is leaving see you later cat enjoy your day that is J vlog says one of the reasons he and his wife moved to Japan that's a pretty strict place to live no is America superior because of its First Amendment that's a I think America is a model for the world because of our Bill of Rights you know I think that's what uh make some makes America as strong as it is unfortunately liberals wanna infringe on that as well they'd love to do all they can to a rogue that so yeah I don't know how I don't know how that's gonna play for them in the midterms I don't think very very well anyway beaming bizarre I'm gonna disagree with you there I think America is superior in many many ways cruisin Dora says people should stop focusing on race and ethnicity to run the country no one does no one does in fact Barack Obama was the only one about race into that equation he set race relations in the u.s. back about 50 years the J blog interesting all right so are you originally Canadian and if so what is it like living in Japan what's it like living there for seven years as a westerner very very curious if you can share with us let's see I'm gonna go do some of your questions now because the comments are coming in Fast and Furious Lee too many Trump threats and no action he's paving the way for a Hillary victory I have to fundamentally disagree with you there I have the fundamentally decision there Trump is is digging more action than anybody else and America has a second Amendment and our to sissy to use I yeah it's gotta be a troll post I don't I don't I think you are either that are you're woefully misinformed on Trump successes Glenn Ward asks do I think the Russia story helps Trump or hurts Trump I think now it helps him I think that Trump voters and those independents who care who our economic voters are looking at this they know it's a hoax that's your really good question Glenn they know it's a hoax after the FISA release and they realize that it's um it's now the only narrow the Democrats have because there have a platform and so I think now it hurts Trump and the Democrats continue down this path they're going to be doing themselves a great great disservice in the midterms I hope they do I hope they do evil bastards also come and I agree with a he says Comey was right and that if the Democrats keep sliding left they're gonna lose in 2020 look the Democrats are I love what they're doing I love what they're doing they're making the grossest miscalculation in political history by calling people like Acacio Cortez the future of the party you've got keith ellison the number two man over National Committee Tom Perez number one both radical radical as Keith bliss and embracing people like Louis Farrakhan talking about how they love socialism and they love all of these radically far left ideas and and abolishing ice these things are not resonating with America they are not resonating with the American people not at all and I think I think the Democrats keep this up their party is going to disintegrate there you can see they're having a civil war in their party right now you've got guys like Joe Lieberman who was Al Gore's running mate back in 2000 you know they're they're saying hey Alexandria cause he'll Cortes is not the future get away from even James Comey Stalin Democrats don't move towards socialism they're not listening they're not listening Joseph Linnet says Trump has done more in the first six months of his presidency than the last five or six presidents did in their entire terms I got to agree with you I've got to agree with you Josh Carlin asked my take on Edward Snowden I thought he was a whistleblower then he became a traitor when he ran to China and Russia Matthew Hoffman makes an interesting comment he says the more the left shows how bad it is the more people are coming to the right it's true because you've got the look elections in the United States have long been decided by like four to seven percent of the country right and that four to seven percent was for the most part economic voters they weren't political ideologues they weren't firebrand voters look you're not gonna find them we're second amendment centric guy than me but second amendment in terms of importance to voters typically polls around I mean at best at best like 6% like 6% the US needs to allow the house provide plug mejor let me let me meet my home let me dispel the myth for you the US needs to allow the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to have top-secret security clearances would stop the redaction issues now they do have it they're allowed to view on redacted versions of materials as is the Judiciary Committee the public isn't so when you see a redacted version that's the version that can be released to the public the HPS CI the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence SSCI judiciary oversight they have clearances they can see the unredacted versions behind closed doors are in skiffs sensitive compartmented information facilities when you're seeing a redacted version it's for us it's a public consumption Alex Freedom says you used to be Center but now Center is right so lol yeah it is because left is like falls off San Francisco the Jay blog in Canada we paid 30 40 percent taxes in Japan you pay 8 percent for health care you pay 30 percent the government pays 70 percent I get that but what's it like to live there is it restrictive or the things you can't do as a Western under that ethnic Japanese Japanese birthright citizens can do demon ghazan no you cannot get unredacted versions of the FISA application thanks for the offer though and those that were up that people claimed were unredacted we're not accurate let's see I got to go back through my Wow you guys are are really fast and furious the comments right this is a good one red Saab Dems will ultimately turn to celebrities to leave their charge for 2020 there nobody candidates will try to rely on people they think are popular yeah maybe but Elizabeth Warren is their big frontrunner so I do I have agree with you I think what they're gonna do is they're gonna have celebrities rally around the Liz Warren's and the Acacio Cortez is now here's what's interesting in this New York 14th congressional district 14 in New York race okay beam exam you have the unredacted if you have unredacted accurate versions of the FISA applications you're a multimillionaire you're a multi-millionaire every outlet in the world to buy him from you so I suggest you go try to sell them but I think what the Democrats are gonna do is they're gonna throw celebrities behind these people the Elizabeth Warren Acacio Cortez well I was saying the interesting thing about Acacio Cortez is District New York 14 is that in New York so joseph Crowley's the incumbent Democrat she beat him in the primary terrible turnout he didn't really campaign but in New York he's now allowed to run on the same ticket in the general with another party so he's running with the Working Families Party so in light of a Cosby protest his recent dumb comments and her showing she has zero command of the issues and of anything really Crowley will probably win running second party third party because I'll even call it second Marty because there's no real Republican challenger in this race let's say there are two restrictions in Japan renting an apartment the owner vets can say no foreigners and you can't vote ah so number two is pretty much everywhere in the world and number one they are allowed to discriminate if you're not Japanese otherwise very very interesting cool let's see I'm living in Japan now pug Malone says if you step in a line you likely to be put on a plane example get into a brawl very much a beehive Society interesting interesting interesting but you know what not the worst policy I kind of agree with it maybe we should maybe we should be doing more of that in the US and Canada huh maybe we should be taking care of our people like the Japanese take care of theirs but look the people what do I think yes yes well look hold on let me go back Robert kajak says because celebrities help Hillary so much I said it was her strategy I don't think is gonna work what they can do it doesn't mean it's gonna be successful Trump will win in 2020 barring any bari him dropping out or you know 72 years old is health being compromised I think Trump sails to victory but let me put something in perspective for you Donald Trump ready for this is one year older than Jeff Sessions Trump is seventy-two sessions in 71 Donald Trump could run a marathon around Jeff Sessions twice a day so Laura Fisher says one-term president smartest move yet now I don't think so I originally thought he might do that I really did but now I think he's winning and he's not gonna want to stop the progress I think he sees how disastrous from the Democratic agenda will be to this country and I don't think he's gonna let them take pick the reins I just I don't see it happening I just don't see it happening let's say we need the two terms free gamma Boonta says yes Kevin s says loved the picture behind me yeah this is a forgotten man it was actually given to me interesting story it's a print you know nothing special but it was given to me by my old neighbor who was an older Cuban guys like 85 years old and he was a member of Task Force 2506 which was the Bay of Pigs the Bay of Pigs insurgents fascinating fascinating stories about how he tried to fight Castro in the communists I used to sit over at his house and listen to him for hours have a drink and then when I moved tears back he gave me that picture asked me to hang it in the studio and I did and so that's the story behind that Matthew Hoffman says then is anyone noticed how Portland Oregon has had more riots than anywhere else please correct me if I'm wrong well I don't know if they've been more but they certainly have a lot and I would have to agree with you I think I know where you go and it has to do with they're very liberal governance and they're embracing of groups like Ann Tifa life is simple says funny on the left hated all Confederate statues after Trump was elected yeah statues that have been around 150 years they all of a sudden were the most offensive things ever III know it was ridiculous the ran man is saying YouTube's really got our feed messed up you just gotta do a refresh yeah we've been having problems it's look let's face it we know that these social media companies are leftist we know that they don't love conservative content what are you gonna do you got to keep putting out your content and getting the word out there you know that's what you got to do raven bloody says life has been good for us since trump got elected yeah and getting better every day Trump Cromwell thirty thirteen 6:49 Trump looking after his own countrymen first it's called patriotism liberals and Dems see it otherwise outsiders come first in their eyes that's true that's true Steve Rosen says sessions probably blackmailed or threatened seemed like a good guy for years and our bad guy something came up only the bad guy I just think that sessions never thought the job was gonna be this that it was gonna be this controversial this contentious this adversarial I think he's tired I think the guy doesn't want to fight I think he's deferred to Rosenstein a gentleman's journey says thoughts on soy boy Justin Trudeau yeah I hope for you guys sake that he is not your Prime Minister much longer do I like the first lady life is simple yeah she's a nice lady I don't think much about her I I've never been one that cares much about the families of politicians I didn't care much about Michelle Obama I don't care much about Melania Trump she seems like a nice woman you know she doesn't run the country so god bless her Jones donation thanks turbo very generous of you we appreciate it CNBC says Russia hacked Ukraine power grid twice it's Trump being nice to Russia because our grid is vulnerable Trump isn't being nice to Russia see that's what the mainstream media is reporting but go back to February we killed and airstrikes in syria about three to four hundred two to three hundred russian mercenaries we took their ground troops out so when Trump went to Helsinki and he was cordial to Putin he went to Helsinki and was quoted the Putin predicated him on the fact that a few months earlier we were whacking Russians on the ground in Syria left and right by the way we had 40 special operations guys up against 300 Russian mercenaries with a couple of our combat controllers we killed two to three hundred of those Russian mercenaries we didn't lose a single man we didn't even suffer an injury the gloves are off so Trump isn't being nice to Putin Turbo but a great question otherwise let's see who said Louis I'm a tax break corrupt UK government Dems are suing Republicans because of the tax breaks yeah good luck good luck Demi's no collusion cooperation is more like it no I don't think Trump cooperated with the Russians to win the election robo's what about Ted Cruz to replace sessions uh yeah yeah I would said Ted Cruz to the Supreme Court or leave him in the Senate David Goliath so the hope Hillary runs again I miss the entertainment she brought in 2016 yeah well she's giving us that entertainment every day she will not go away Greg a so they bought a confederate flag in new york last week and it'll be a collector's item soon look I don't know if people get so hysterical over the Confederate flag it's a piece of history you don't have to agree with the intent behind so having historical items doesn't mean you agree with the intent behind the creation of this for the more politically correct version let's see it was a good comment here Robinson Mason media itching to report mana fort guilty yeah I think you're right I think you are right let's see thank God for Trump making our military great again he really has mm you know it's not just building up troop strength it's not just getting money appropriated to strengthen the military to grow it to enhance it it's about morale they have their morale back Obama crushed their morale crushed their morale evil bastards right Trump sent arms to Ukraine helping defend against Russian invasion and I would venture a guess our special operators are they're training them though plug Mahone is right Trump is building a relationship with Putin if you don't have a friend and you have a potential enemy very basic principles people and Trump was clear he called him a competitor a competitor because he is a competitor a competitor wants to beat you competitor want you to lose committer wants you out of the game it's a great way to put it it's a great way to put it qualm Cromwell 13 6:49 says Hillary coated with Russians probably I don't know there's a big payment the Clinton Foundation of 150 million seems like more probably than more than probably to me g-got Spa says trey gowdy to replace sessions god no trey gowdy is all bark and no bite he's a big establishment guy who sounds good so we use his sound bites and cheer him on but in terms of action no no no no no let's see what else we got here let's see Jed Jen Johnson says why doesn't anyone ever talk about statistics for illegal aliens it's bad what do you mean crime stats actually in the grand scheme it's not it's about in line with the rest of the population but that's too many because they shouldn't be here Jeff Jones as we brits love our friends across the pond good we love you Brits as well my allergies are still really bad that hey guys so excuse me terrible that I have to do that for you but trying to fight through this judge Jeanine Pirro for attorney general now that's when I can get behind I also like Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi she's tough she's good Nowell Nowell russell paid over the 400 million i think you're talking about that comment putin made that bill Browder illegally earned 1.5 billion and sent 400 million hillary and not able to confirm that yet but it was interesting it was interesting let's say Cromwell says I'm a Brit and I support everything Trump does because what happens in the u.s. affects the rest of the world it's true that is very true very accurate accurate statement kuku Kasich Sciences Judge Judy for Ginsburg replacement Judge Judy huh dr. Stephen is telling me I'm so wrong about trey gowdy except that I'm not I'm not trey Gowdy is like this with Lindsey Graham he's like this with Marco Rubio trey Gowdy is all bark and no bite remember the Benghazi hearings what came of those trey Gowdy made a lot of noise to Hillary Clinton put her on the carpet we cheered him on Hillary never faced one second of punishment over Benghazi none once Trump Greg F says is finished fixing the US perhaps he can fix Canada when he does from Conservative leader I think he's got his hands full here David Goliath says I was in the Navy under Obama you're right he killed morale by cutting our pay and kicking out good guys with 14 years in because he couldn't pay everyone thank you very much for your service yeah I think the way Obama hurt the morale of military in law enforcement was tragic absolutely tragic evil bastard says that wasn't gaudi's fault man Obama ordered the Attorney General to stop prosecutions and block all investigation Gowdy doesn't work for the Attorney General gaudí worked for Congress Congress a separate branch Congress could have issued resolutions and statements Congress could have moved to impeach Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder Congress could have moved to impeach other officials because of their behavior during mandazi they didn't trey Gowdy led that committee please spare me guys all bark and no bite his sound bites are good but when it comes time to get things done he doesn't get him done he needs to go to the private sector he needs to go to the private sector and that comment of some evil bastard you and I normally agree but not on trey Gowdy look I love that he beats people up I love using those sound bites I love it I'll keep using them but the guy's not a man of action let's see what else we got Obama hurt the whole country Shelley Bayless says I agree Shelley Roy Lopez says wasn't Gaddy bashing Trump about the Russia summit he's not Trump won her percent supported look I don't need anybody to be a 100n supporter of anybody but yeah gaudí is often a nod ends with Trump and if you notice he's in lockstep with Marco Rubio somebody I know that I've known for about 11 years somebody I'm very very disappointed with maybe 12 years very disappointed but evil bastard said you can impeach if you don't of the votes for impeachment you could draw up articles of impeachment my friend the Devens do it every day - Trump they do something and why didn't we have the votes why we controlled the House of Representatives it's just that the time Speaker John Boehner was head over heels in love with Barack Obama as was Paul Ryan after him so we had the votes the Republicans controlled the house remember impeachment is a two-step process you're impeached in the house and then you go to trial for removal in the Senate that never would have happened because Dems at the time control the Senate but we had the votes for impeachment in the house much like we did with Bill Clinton we impeached him so evil with respect you're wrong on this one my friend let's see what else we got see Rosen wants Hillary sentence for five years to help out a Martha Stewart well I think the statute of limitations on that has long long expired from Taiwan we love president Trump he's the best ever to lead America Wow thanks for watching from Taiwan life is simple what I bring Jordan B Peterson for a political talk on my show I would love to but Jordan is very booked these days I've reached out many times he's in high high demand Jim Jordan Cromwell says Jim Jordan and Matt gates will push till hurler Hillary Clinton gets impeached as will mark meadows and I'm a big fan of Jordan gates Meadows all those guys big fan of every guy I backed Matt gates his first run first political run when he was running as a state representative in Florida he was hardcore than he's hardcore now he's the real deal good guy good guy that Matt Gaetz let's see what else we got let's see you need a two-thirds vote for impeachment mmm we would have had it if we had a strong Speaker of the House a strong majority leader I'm a strong whip but we didn't that's what they do they whip votes the way the Speaker of the House works is you're voting with us on impeachment and if you don't your bills will never see the light of day your district will never get one red cent but John Boehner and Paul Ryan and not those guys they're establishment hacks who want to be conciliatory to Democrats let's see Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize but several members of the committee would rather have a massive global thermonuclear war they would just never give it to him Obama got it for getting up one morning and brushing his teeth plug Mahone's as it seems to me that Congress are ineffectual and I've never seen any action yeah well that's why their approval ratings are like at 3% you know they are ineffective America's done with them America is done with them Meadows is excellent Steve Rose and says yeah mark Meadows is great and it's a really nice guy I've had spoken with him one-on-one a couple of times real nice man loves his country real deal and and we should have more like him Matthew Hoffman says my tow hitch has and will hurt more people than any of my guns or any of my friends exactly exactly it's the anti Gunners are out of their minds Gill Cochran says the so the failure of Benghazi was trey Gowdy and jason Chaffetz and others not failure in Benghazi proper well that's on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama the failure to hold him accountable is on John Boehner and and Paul Ryan and Gowdy and Shabbats and all of the other Republican congressional leadership because there is no conservatism there there is none let's see well none of these coming to make it John Zeeland says the second most hated person by the OLT left after Trump is Devin Nunez do I agree he's up there he's up there certainly is I think they yeah Devin Nunez I think they're not loving Jim Jordan they went after him with that dumb scandal according to Freeman freedom watches founder Larry claim in a citizen's grand jury could be formed by the people and citizens of all those involved in Clinton mess I know Larry very well I speak to him all the time fundamentally he's right practically it can't be done and I and I like Larry very much so yes legally can it be done constitutionally it can will it ever happen no no turbo Jones as NSA says American power grid will be hacked not if but when yeah and I don't think we do enough to protect it and there are some there are some very smart people who tend to agree it's one of our it's really one of our critical failure points and we need to get better and smarter about it Steve Rosen's the shifts Republicans or JFK Democrats and Democrats of the National Socialists pretty much pretty much I mean I think even the establishment Republicans are left of JFK Democrats and conservative Republicans are right of it but the left is you know we were talking about before we used to have the center here right but down the left for the center is over here on the left and the center of the center for the left over here Center for the right is over here we don't have a center anymore we just don't have it we don't have common ground in that Center anymore and only we will I don't think we're going to see that in many many years for many many years I just unfortunately don't crombel says what all the nasty rhetoric from people like Maxine Waters Trump's 28 campaign will be a landslide well he's not running in 2018 2018 is the midterms you mean 2020 but yes Glenn Ward what is the best cure for Trump derangement syndrome they could always move to Canada ah you don't want him uh how about moving to Mexico let him move to Mexico Jumbo leader says do I partake in vaping no nope not a vape guy I don't I smoke cigars every now and again but never been into this vape trend don't really understand it don't enjoy it not my thing Jeff Jones says you all beat our British asses in 72 1776 and deserved the win yeah but you guys have been some pretty damn good allies since then in world wars in this war on terror so I think it all

old bay this is not happening if nobody wants immigration from s whole countries Alastair Williams asks how has it been happening why do our governments not represent our peoples best interests well that is the question Gabrielle Toby asks what is Gitmo it's its the nickname for Guantanamo Bay yeah Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba where we hold and interrogate terrorists what should Congress do to protect Christians in their homelands not much the US Congress can do to protect Christians and other places here in the US they've got to make sure religious liberties aren't legislatively
