First you get on a bus,
you get comfortable
and then that's when they turn on 
movies. And after a while, I fall asleep.
I don't talk to anyone about my dad 
being in prison.
Please everyone, you leave everything
on the bus, no electronics
no cellphones. Just have your 
money if you are taking money.
If you have a baby with you you...
And then we walk in the prison and 
they call our names
by alphabetical order. 
And then we walk in the they check us
and then I run to him and hug him.
I don't, I don't like being in a prison.
I love my kids, I go do anything to try 
to get them, be there for them,
communicate with them.
They didn't even ask to be here, to
go through this, but they are here in it.
They don't know exactly when I get out.
Because there was problems 
that I would have with my daughter,
where she would be distant.
And she said to me,
you're my dad I know you,
but I don't know you.
He says he has a 50-50 percent 
chance he might get out.
It's going to be different if he
came home, I would be happy.
