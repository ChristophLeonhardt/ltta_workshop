while appearing on a show that lowers the collective IQ of the nation by at least one standard deviation the view Ally Wentworth who's the wife of ABC News objective news anchor George Stephanopoulos explained what election night was like at the Stephanopoulos Wentworth home here's what it looked like and I have an 11 year old daughter who doesn't really understand what Isis is but she knows that she's scared and she's now sleeping in bed with us every night which what do you do Alec what do you say what do you do you got little girls you you see what's happening what can what can you say that other parents who have who are at their wit's end with their children who are scared and they're also scared as adults this is what I say I say two things I say to my kids one is we help out everybody in this country that is really going to need our help whatever whatever in organization you know we we give we volunteer we help out well as my my 14 year old getting upset about the election and screaming no abortions really loudly 14 year old and I was like you haven't kissed a boy yet don't use that word so quickly but okay let's just point something out if you're wondering why the left have gone completely insane perhaps it's because they were raised to be insane another raising their kids the exact same way why in the world when a fourteen-year-old girl think that her world is ending because Donald Trump has been elected president more importantly why would she think her world is ending because of possible restrictions on abortion she's 14 are left his parents truly raising their daughters to believe that their right to freedom is dependent on their ability to kill their own offspring in the womb I'll raise my kids to believe that certain rights are sacred the right to religious practice the right to freedom of speech the right to defend ourselves the notion of teaching a little girl that abortion is the chief right women should expect from their government or that their life is somehow inevitably impacted by laws cracking down on abortion that's patently crazy the fact that someone left us apparently teach their kids that Liberty can be boiled down not to individual choice and responsibility for that choice but to the ability to pay a clinic to kill a baby in the womb and then take it out that's pretty disgusting as the parents of a daughter here's what I plan to tell her about abortion I plan to say sweetheart when you get married and when you have sex and get pregnant that will be the greatest joy you can experience I know that because it was the greatest joy that your mom and I ever experienced your birth was the highlight of our lives your existence is a timeless reminder that God loves us and he loves and that he favors us with miracles every day none greater than your creation your beloved of God and your children will be two children are the greatest gift we can receive to spurn that gift to destroy another human life is a great evil no matter any countervailing concerns now here's what they were religious but even if we weren't that lecture wouldn't change all that much children are the greatest thing in life and they are lives regardless of whether you're religious or secular and suggesting that true freedom lies in the ability to kill children in the womb it's just disgust it means gross come on propagandizing fourteen year olds with that suggestion that's even more gross but if you tell your kids that evil Republicans are coming in the nighttime raid your womb it's no wonder they get hysterical when Democrats lose elections i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show alright he's so much to get to today so much leftist craziness out there i mean we've been focusing a lot on sort of the soul-sucking that's been happening in certain parts of the Republican Party but there's so much that's crazy that's happening on the left we're gonna get to that in just a second but first we have to say hello to our sponsors at helix sleep so if you go to helix sleep comm slash Ben this is the place to go to get the most comfortable mattress in the world we have a one of these helix sleep mattresses and they are just fantastic the way that it works you go to helix sleep calm and they ask you for your height and weight and your body type and what kind of mattress you like sleeping on do you like it to absorb heat do you like it to be cool do you like it to be more firm or more soft and they can even make mattresses that are different for the different sides of the bed so if you or your partner have different sleep behaviors then then you can change the the mattress that way they then send it to your house in a giant box and and you unwrap the box and it inflates and it's yeah it's super cool it's very very comfortable apparently they've done surveys and they found that sleep quality increases like 30 percent based on sleeping on a helix sleep mattress really nice mattress they run that 3d biomechanical model of your body through algorithms they've developed and then if you don't like it you can try it for for a hundred nights and then you can send it back for free if you don't love it no questions asked for 100% refund so it's great service helix sleep comm slash spending at $50 off your order helix sleep calm slash men and their prices are extraordinarily competitive very very reasonable the quality of the mattress is really good I know because I sleep on one every single night okay so as you mentioned you just saw Ally Wentworth talked about her daughter and it really is amazing how many people on the left teach their kids that Republicans are to be feared and hated because Republicans oppose abortion because Republicans don't like babies being killed in the womb and again I think that children innately understand what kids are and they innately understand there's a baby in mommy's tummy I know this because right now we have a seven month old and we have in almost three year old and three year old knew all the way through the the pregnancy that there was a baby in mommy's tummy I mean she's to walk around the house with a little doll under her shirt saying that she was pregnant just like mommy when kids understand this but adults are trained they trained themselves not to understand certain basic truths about life so that they can do what's convenient this is making a nation of crazy people and it really is dividing us along lines that don't need division you know there was a question somebody put out on Twitter must have been a few weeks ago where they said what's the thing where in a hundred years people are gonna look back on American politics and say I can't believe that was even a debate this is the one this is the one he's a science gets better as we see into the womb better as we it is clear to people what exactly is going on inside the womb what happens in pregnancy as more people become aware of it people are going to see this for the evil that it is again the idea of a fourteen-year-old runarounds running around screaming because she won't be able to get an abortion under Trump number one it's not true number two even if it were true how about mommy says to her sweetheart you're never gonna want an abortion and abortion is bad and actually what you should be focused on is making the decisions in your life and not your ability to kill a baby you know the idea that your lifestyle is compromised because you have a baby it's just it's its stomach churning and the basic notion the left promotes with regard to abortion that your lifestyle must be preserved at the cost of another human life is life is really really stomach-turning that's not the only stomach-churning thing though the left proclaims itself a big fan of human rights and in the big news story of the day is what's happening in Aleppo in Syria so Aleppo as Gary Johnson well knows now is a city in Syria it's a lot but that's what it is and Aleppo has been the site of a raging battle that's been taking place over the course of several months between rebels against Bashar Assad and the Assad regime the Russians back Assad the Russian have been lending support to Assad to go in and slaughter his own people and the reports out of out of out of Aleppo are becoming increasingly insane we're talking about there's a report yesterday the 20 women had committed suicide in order to avoid being raped by Assad's forces apparently there are a hundred schoolchildren who are who were killed but when they were when they were suffocated under a building that was blown up by Assad's forces the UN is saying that there are scores and scores of people who are civilians who are being killed in Aleppo and the Obama administration is just devastated about this and so they sent out Samantha power who's the UN Ambassador and who by the way wrote a book about American in action during genocide I mean that's her claim to fame her actual book is about this which is an incredible thing right I mean the fact is the issues appointed specifically because of her unwillingness to stand by blindly supposedly when genocide was occurring the book was called a problem from hell's big bestseller back in like 2002 and it explicitly talked about American inaction it goes through all of the the various genocides that have happened around the planet during the last hundred years and gets very upset with the United States for not stepping in the New York Times Book Review talked about her book at the time and it said this in Washington is a place of defeatism inertia selfishness and cowardice warnings pass up the chain to disappear intelligence is gathered and then ignored or denied the will of the executive remains steadfastly opposed to intervention it's guiding assumption is that the cost of stopping genocide is great while the political cost of ignoring it is next to nil and then basically she makes the case that we ought to be more interested in genocide around the world well the Obama administration obviously didn't care about the genocide those happening in Syria and it is a genocide I mean you're talking hundreds of thousands of people dead the way assessment is four hundred seventy thousand people dead in in Syria and several million have been exiled from Syria the entire refugee crisis in Europe is largely due to what's happening in Syria Obama as you recall he said that he drew a red line if Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people then Assad did use chemical weapons against his own people and Obama said that he was going to take military action there's blowback to that then he said he was gonna do what John Kerry called a pinprick strike we're just going hey won't be hover it'll be tiny it'll be like a needle and then Putin comes along and says you know what I'll kind of deal on behalf of Bashar Assad we'll get rid of some of these WMDs they didn't and we will make sure that Assad is kept under control they didn't and Obama jumps on that he said sure of lad you lead the way you lead the way of Latin Vladimir Putin says excellent and then he proceeds to enshrine Assad work with Iran to enshrine Assad right now and a lot of the rebels and on one side you have the Iranian militias who are going in there to slaughter everybody on the other side you have Assad's people who are going in there to slaughter everybody and the Obama administration claiming all the way through that this is totally wild how could this have possibly happen here is Samantha Power's that the lady who wrote this book literally about American non intervention during genocides and and she's being feeded by the media the media think she is just wonderful for doing this I mean talk about virtue signaling here she is Russia Iran and their affiliated militia are the ones responsible for what the UN called a complete meltdown of humanity and they are showing no mercy no mercy despite their territorial conquest even now no mercy in the last 24 hours alone pro-assad forces reportedly killed at least 82 civilians including 11 women and 13 children and it is up to each and every one of us here to defend those rules to the Assad regime Russia and Iran three member states behind the conquest of and carnage in Aleppo you bear responsibility for these atrocities by rejecting un ICRC evacuation efforts you are signaling to those militia who are massacring innocents to keep doing what they are doing denying or obfuscating the facts as you will do today saying up is down black is white will not absolve you to the Assad regime Russia and Iran your forces and proxies are carrying out these crimes your barrel bombs and mortars and airstrikes have allowed the militia in Aleppo to encircle tens of thousands of civilians in your ever tightening noose okay so she is obviously condemning Russia Iran Syria only one problem she's I did with Russia Iran and Syria her administration sided with all three of those they left us odd in power the the Hillary Clinton you remember Hillary Clinton called Hassan reformer the media used to treat Assad with kid gloves these to pretend that he was a good guy in the region Iran has been empowered massively by the same administration that cutting a nuclear deal with Iran giving them the capacity to broaden their economy give him a hundred fifty billion dollars open their economy to the world allows them to continue funding terrorism including terrorism in Syria and in Iraq and as far as Russia obviously the Obama administration has been super warm toward Putin they've allowed Putin to do anything that he could possibly want to do they've allowed Putin to take over everything and so the hypocrisy of left when it comes to criticizing Russia is really amazing the pocket of the left is now ripping on Russia for what's going on in Syria they're the ones who handed it over to Putin and on point something else out here too and that is that there's this weird idea that is prevailed in inside the Obama administration that you can shame bad people into doing good things if you just shame them and they'll do the right thing right you remember Michelle Obama with her bring back our girls hash tag after Boko Haram the terrorist group in Nigeria kidnapped a bunch of schoolgirls she held up that hashtag like Boko Haram cares what you hatch tagged you remember that after Putin invaded Ukraine Jen Psaki of the State Department she tweeted hashtag United for Ukraine did that get Putin out of Ukraine of course not it didn't do anything but this is this all extends back to the same mentality as Gandhi so Gandhi was a big fan of nonviolent resistance back in 1938 he said this about the Jews he said if I were a Jew born in Germany this is during the Nazi period if I were a Jew born in Germany and earn my livelihood there I would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest Gentile German might and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon the Jews of Germany can offer satyagraha that's the passive resistance under infinitely better auspices than the Indians of South Africa of course that was inherently untrue because the British were not vile Nazis and the Nazis were in 1946 after he found out about the Holocaust he continued to maintain this he said Hitler killed five the five million Jews it is the greatest crime of our time but the Jews should have offered themselves to the butcher's knife it would have aroused the world in the people of Germany they sort of didn't have a choice and they were slaughtered by the millions the idea that the world would have been aroused by knowledge of the Holocaust is nonsense everybody knew about the Holocaust well is happening the contemporaneous documents show that was the case and the United States wouldn't even bomb the rail lines so the idea that you can offer passive resistance to evil and then that somehow suffices that's ridiculous but that's been the Obama administration policy all the way through and yes Putin is an evil man Putin is a deeply evil human being who has not only expanded Russian borders at the expense of free peoples he's also he's also murdered dissidents imprisoned dissidents imprisoned people who are Oleg ARCIC who he doesn't like and then handed their money to other oligarchs that he does like personally enriched himself to the tune of 40 billion dollars supposedly he is he's taken measures to to destroy lives all throughout the world I mean Vladimir Putin is one of the world's worst human beings he really is one of the world's worst human beings and the fact that the Obama administration is now calling it out after years of propping him up is truly hypocritical now what's just as hypocritical is the Republican take on Putin so there's a poll that came out today that is really quite disturbing this a poll from The Economist YouGov and it talks about net favorability of Vladimir Putin among Republicans so the net favorability of Vladimir Putin among Republicans in in 2016 in to that in 2014 July 2014 Republican net favorability for Putin meaning the number of people who like him minus the number of people who hate him was negative 66 percent so it's probably like 10 percent like them 676 percent thought that Putin was evil today today December 2016 that is a negative 10 percent so that means that 35 percent probably like him and 45 percent think that he's bad okay that's not good folks that's not good if you're one of these people who's gotten warm to Putin because you think that Putin was mean to Hillary and the enemy of my enemy is my friend understand he's not your friend Vladimir Putin has now played two straight administrations he played Bush remember Bush saying that he looked into Putin so I looked into his soul and he saw something good there and it turns out that you know McCain was actually right about this he looked into Putin's soul and saw KGB and then Obama came in and said you know the thing about that Bush he was too hard on Putin give him a reset button give him more power everything will be hunky-dory spent Putin proceeded to screw the United States once again and expand his power and our expense and now Trump is doing the exact same thing and you've got Republicans going right along for you've got Republicans going right along with it and that's dangerous stuff as dangerous tough Putin is not a good man Putin is not your ally Putin is not the guy you can rely on to be a bulwark against the bad guys he is one of the bad guys if you want to say that there are alliances of convenience that you might be able to draw with Putin from time to time that's one thing but if you want to say that Putin is an actual ally in the war on terror you want to say that Vladimir Putin is the guy you're gonna delegate foreign policy to what Putin knows what he's doing here and he knows which buttons to push and I think that it's only a matter of time before Putin makes a very aggressive move in Central Asia you know talking about Kazakhstan or he makes it makes a strong move against Latvia or Estonia or Lithuania and then he dares Trump to stop him and the chances are Trump won't do anything the chances are very strong that the Trump won't do anything the proof is in the pudding Trump's election of Rex Tillerson is CEO of Exxon Tillerson as I said yesterday this is about Tillerson it's about Trump the only thing Trump cares about from Tillerson is presumably what Tillerson thinks of Putin until her sin in Putin get along Trump said this yesterday in Wisconsin here's what he said you know Rex is friendly with many of the leaders in the world that we don't get along with and some people don't like that they don't want them to be friendly that's why I'm doing the deal with Rex because I like what this is all about and we're gonna have somebody that's gonna be very special okay so he likes the fact that Tillerson has relationships to some of the worst people on earth this is Obama s language isn't it better that we should talk to Cuba isn't it better that we should hang out with the bad guys that we shouldn't be talking with the bad guys wouldn't be better if we were talking to Iran rather than not talking to Iran this is not a positive development it's not and for all the people who are complaining about what's happening in Syria Trump has no intention of doing anything in Syria to help people now maybe you think that's good maybe you do but the truth is that there are certain basic truths about foreign policy that very few people want to acknowledge the the most fundamental truth is that when it comes to a choice between genocide and American intervention most people will choose genocide and that's been true historically for the United States you'd rather watch from abroad as genocide happens somewhere then we would get involved and that's a question that we ought to be asking ourselves is what extent is they involvement necessary should that involvement include airstrikes or should also include boots on the ground how much do we about this and if we're not honest with ourselves about this question more people are gonna die while we did there around but clearly Trump doesn't care particularly much here's Donald from spokesperson Jason Miller he asked about Vladimir Putin's involvement in Syria do we have that no we don't have that okay well he said earlier he said that that hundreds of thousands of people in Syria being killed we were viewing that through the wrong lens that's what he said on Fox News a little bit earlier today we should view that through a different lens it's again no we shouldn't something is really bad happening and you can say that we don't have the wherewithal or we don't have the resources or we don't have the will to stop it but to pretend that Obama's awful awful awful about Syria and then pursue exactly the same policy and actually warm to trump is more than a little bit hypocritical the same thing is happening by the way that Russian hacking of course the the the real reason that Republicans shifted on Putin is not because they thought the Putin was fighting Isis hey the real reason the Republicans shifted on Isis is the same reason they shifted on WikiLeaks when WikiLeaks was targeting the American military we hated WikiLeaks then it started targeting Hillary and a lot of Republicans said hey WikiLeaks they're great they know how by the way they they went from a 47% net unfavorable rating among Republicans in 2014 to a net 27% favorable rating among Republicans now WikiLeaks hey they still are releasing American military information but we're cool with that because they're serving our purposes again this just goes to show you that most people down deep don't really care about anything remotely approaching intellectual honesty they care much more about does it serve my interest does it not serve my interest and that's true also of the Russian hacking so long as the Russian hacking we think helped Trump it's okay if the Russian hacking had helped Hillary we'd be over the moon about it'd be the end of the world we'd be losing our minds but if you're bob Corker right the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I'm a guy who's become sort of an ally of Trump he says that there's no reason we should have our hair on fire about Russian hacking I'm assuming that plenty of people are attempting to listen to my phone calls I mean that's the way intelligence is gathered so the hacking piece the hacking piece is I mean I don't think we ought to have a hair on fire about that I'm sorry I mean that's what people do it's what you do with that and I mean we need to guard against it we need to do everything we can to make sure that it doesn't happen is certainly in our office we're doing everything we can to make sure that our computer systems are not hacked and right this is obviously raising alarms for everyone but but at the end of the day trying to understand what Russia is doing not only here in the United States but in elections around the world is an important thing for us to know right we shouldn't have our hair on fire about it right we should we should just I don't even know what that means and I'm not sure I would like to see Bob corkers hair on fire just for the thrill of the the fun of it I mean just the deputy dog of him running around where this hair on fire is still speaking with the slow cadence would be would be amusing but we have to sign off here but there's a lot more to come we are going to talk about some good things that Donald Trump has been doing the man obviously has tremendous personal magnetism and will talk about the evidence of that that daily
