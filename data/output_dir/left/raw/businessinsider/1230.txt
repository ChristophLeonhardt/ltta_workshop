it's such a cheesy thing but you have to

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of follow your instinct a little</font>

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,710
bit I think it's that's like the

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,469
greatest tool for sure people try to

5
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,900
give me advice all the time actually and

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,420
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually ignore it because I don't I</font>

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,220
think everybody has to find their own

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,859
path I'm sure there was you know there

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,119
was tons of people in the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,430
said why are you doing a collection with

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">payless like that why do you think that</font>

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,570
that's interesting and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I</font>

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,279
think it's interesting because I was 20

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,500
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old being offered multi-million</font>

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,969
dollar deal to design shoes and bags and

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,829
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shoe designer who's going to</font>

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,110
say no<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that that's exciting and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,460
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost ten years later</font>

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,620
selling almost you know billions of

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,390
shoes like that's kind of crazy so

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,250
imagine if I took that advice and said

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,590
and didn't go with it so I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

23
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,629
there is a big part about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you like</font>

26
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,550
bit I think it's that's like the

27
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,309
greatest tool for sure at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

28
