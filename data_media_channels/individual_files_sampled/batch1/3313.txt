one of the weird things about frequent flyer miles nowadays is that the vast majority of miles are not earned through actually flying most miles are given out through credit cards my name is Scott cos I'm the CEO and co-founder of Scott's cheap flights really at the end of the day all that matters is the signup bonus I've gotten you know hundreds of thousands millions of miles just via the signup bonus alone in order to get the signup bonus the credit card will say you have to spend X amount of dollars in X amount of time so typically let's say it's typically something like three thousand dollars in three months I'll put all my spending on that credit card for the first two and a half months and then I'll set myself a calendar reminder two and a half months after I've opened up that card and I'll check my statement at that point how much have I spent on there let's say I've only spent $2,000 you know I'm not gonna go out and just blow $1,000 in the next two weeks just to hit the spending threshold what I can do is actually just let's say send my wife $1,000 over PayPal you pay you know a three percent fee to do that so you're gonna pay 30 bucks that puts a thousand dollars in spending on your credit card and all of a sudden you're at the $3,000 threshold you get those 50,000 miles for just you know 30 bucks extra and you would have spent typically that you really want to focus on making sure you're putting all your spending on that new card to hit that spending the threshold and credit card companies aren't necessary gonna like hearing this but once I hit that spending threshold that credit card is going in the drawer and I'm just gonna go on to the next one and then I'll set myself a calendar reminder so that 11 months after I've opened up that card pull up my calendar in the morning gives me a note oh snap you need to call City Bank and be like hey you know I've really enjoyed using this card but the annual fee is just a little bit too rich for my blood can you waive it for the next year sometimes they'll say yes sometimes they'll say no if they say no that's unfortunate can we downgrade to a No Fee card and doing that helps preserve your credit score a little bit because it maintains the credit line that you have open there and you'd saved yourself the hundred bucks or whatever the annual fee might have been he paying annual fees why should I pay for credit cards there's so many out there so many good ones it's not something I like to do and try to avoid it whenever possible
