1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,160
HE KISSED A GIRL,
DID HE LIKE IT?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,350
YOU KNOW WHAT I

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,269
MEAN BY THOSE WORDS?

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:08,310
FROM
THIS SEASON OF AMERICAN IDOL

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,130
THAT NOONE IN ASKED FOR CAME
A KISS THAT NO ONE ASKED FOR.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,950
KATY PERRY IS ONE OF THE
JUDGES.

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,020
SHE IS ON AMERICAN
IDOL.

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,020
THIS

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,020
IS THE GUY.

10
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,020
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS GENTLEMAN.

11
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
HIS NAME IS

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
BENJAMIN GLACE.

13
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,160
HE'S 20 YEARS
OLD AND HAD NEVER KISSED A GIRL

14
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
THIS LIFE.

15
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,840
THE PRODUCERS TOLD
KATY PARRY AND SHE ASKED

16
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,189
HIM IF HE HAD EVER KISSED A GIRL
AND HE SAID NO.

17
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:28,140
SHE SAID, LET'S
REMEDY THAT AND

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
SHE OFFERED WHAT?

19
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,140
HER CHEEK.

20
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
HE
WENT UP AND KISS HER ON THE

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,789
CHEEK AND SHE IS LIKE THAT WAS
GREAT, THEN SHE SAID CAN YOU

22
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,800
KISS THE OTHER CHEEK AND AS HE
WAS GOING TO KISS THE OTHER

23
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,300
CHEEK WHAT HAPPENS?

24
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,899
SHE TURNS
HER FACE, MOUTH TO MOUTH.

25
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,899
IT

26
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,219
WAS THE KISS HEARD ROUND THE
WORLD AS EVIDENCED BY THIS

27
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,219
NEXT PHOTO.

28
00:00:45,219 --> 00:01:13,680
IT KNOCKED HIM ON
HIS BUNS.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,630
THAT IS UNREAL.

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,630
IN

31
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,200
THE WAKE OF THIS HE SAID:

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,980
I HAVE 
MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS

33
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,980
STORY.

34
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,740
I LOVE IT.

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
NUMBER ONE,

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,380
THERE IS SOMETHING SUPER
ENDEARING ABOUT THE KID.

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
I DO

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,450
NOT KNOW IF YOU GUYS KNOW THIS
BUT I'M NOT A CONSERVATIVE

39
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,390
BUT HE IS A CONSERVATIVE KID
AND HE IS 19

40
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,390
AND HE WANTED HIS FIRST KISS TO
BE SPECIAL AND FOR ALL THE

41
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,649
KIDS OUT THERE, DO NOT SWEAT IT.

42
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,189
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE THAT
SPECIAL THAT JUST MOVE ON,

43
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,189
GET THE KISS AND MOVE FORWARD.

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,350
ALSO IT IS NOT GOING TO BE
WITH KATY PERRY.

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,659
AND BY THE WAY, GETTING YOUR
KIDS FROM GETTING IS PRETTY

46
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,659
SPECIAL.

47
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,009
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN IT.

48
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,729
SO HE IS CUTE, HE FELL DOWN, HE

49
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,130
WAS LIKE I WANT TO BE IN A
RELATIONSHIP BEFORE.

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,220
I DO NOT

51
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,430
AGREE WITH HIM, DON'T THINK YOU
NEED TO BE, I THINK YOU SHOULD

52
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,630
GET GOING AND ALL OF THAT BUT TO
YOUR POINT, AWW, THE PEOPLE ARE

53
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,520
SAYING IF YOU DIDN'T KATY PERRY
WAS A GUY OF HER AGE AND KISSED

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL WITHOUT
PERMISSION, PEOPLE WOULD'VE

55
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,930
FLIPPED OUT AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT I WANT TO HEAR YOU

56
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,060
GUYS OUT ON THAT.

57
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,019
THIS IS A PRETTY BIG GRAY
AREA.

58
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:37,019
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.

59
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,769
IF YOU FLIP THE GENDERS, I AM
KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

60
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:43,879
IT RIGHT NOW.

61
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,879
I DO NOT KNOW.

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,909
SO THERE IS A LOT LOGICALLY
TO SIFT THROUGH A NEWSLETTER

63
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,470
FRAMEWORK THAT IS PRESENT IN THE
RECENT YEARS ABOUT POWER

64
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,220
DYNAMICS AND RACES ARE GENDER OF
TRADITIONAL POWER AND HOW THAT

65
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,849
AFFECTS HOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO
INTERPRET IT, AND I THINK THAT

66
00:02:58,849 --> 00:02:59,849
IT IS TWOFOLD.

67
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,510
SO FLIP IT, IN
REVERSE.

68
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,510
THERE ARE A LOT OF

69
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,110
THINGS THAT I'VE COVERED ON
VARIOUS SHOWS WERE IT IS LIKE IF

70
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,560
YOU FLIP THE RACES AND THE
RESPONSES YEAH, BUT ONE RACES

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,549
BEEN TRADITIONALLY IN A POSITION
OF POWER AND SO THAT EQUIVALENCY

72
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,049
DOESN'T REALLY WORK OUT, KNOW
THAT THAT IS A FRAMEWORK OF

73
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,140
DISCOURSE IN AMERICA THAT IS
EVOLVING.

74
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
HOWEVER, IF YOU GO

75
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,299
BACK TO THE POWER GENETIC IN
THIS SITUATION, THERE IS A HOST

76
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:33,210
THERE WAS ALSO A JUDGE IN OF
POSITION OF EXTREME POWER AND

77
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,210
SHE KISSED HIM.

78
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,030
I DO THINK IF
YOU GO TO A MORE SPECIFIC LEVEL,

79
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,160
THIS GUY IS I HAD A CASE.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,000
HE IS
20 YEARS OLD, HE IS NOT POSITION

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,379
WHERE HE IS LIKE SHIFTLESS
COOTIES, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO

82
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,540
DO, HE DIDN'T LIKE IT AND HE MAY
HAVE LIKE THAT.

83
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,560
THE DOMINATING

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,610
UP A LOT OF IN MY OPINION IS SHE
SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE IT.

85
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,610
HE

86
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,500
SEEMS UBER MARKETING BECAUSE THE
LAST TWO THINGS, GRACE POINTED

87
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,049
THIS OUT ON POP TRIGGER, THEY
ARE DOING A LOT OF MARKETING

88
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:04,180
ABOUT HOW KATIE PERIODS IN LOVE
WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE.

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
THAT IS ALSO WEIRD MARKETING.

90
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,460
AS SOMEBODY ANECDOTALLY WHO,
ONE OF MY FIRST KISSES LIKE MY

91
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,310
THIRD CASE HAD TO BE IN A
REHEARSAL SPACE IN FRONT OF MY

92
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,380
MOM IN A PLAY AND THEY REALLY
WANTED ME TO GO FOR IT SO I GET

93
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,911
THAT THIS KID WAS LIKE SUPER
UNCOMFORTABLE AND JUST BECAUSE

94
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:23,880
HE IS A BOY, WHO CARES, IT'S
STILL SAD BUT THE THING I

95
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,354
COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT I AM GOING TO GO OUT ON A

96
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:29,050
LIMB AND ASSUME THIS WAS NOT
KATY PERRY'S IDEA.

97
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,050
SHE HAS

98
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,050
PRODUCERS IN HER EAR.

99
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,330
THEY ARE
TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE WATCH THE

100
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,780
SHOW AND CREATE CONTROVERSY
BECAUSE NOBODY GIVES A CRAP

101
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,030
ABOUT THE SHOW ANYMORE AND THEY
ARE LIKE HERE, WE ARE SENDING

102
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,830
THIS KID AND DIE HIRES OUT IS
GOING TO PLAY OUT, DO YOUR

103
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,601
THINGÃ– POINT IN HIS LIKE SHE
COULD SAY, I'M GETTING, I DO NOT

104
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:49,640
DO ANYTHING OR, WOULD BE A TEAM
PLAYER, LET'S GET THIS DONE.

105
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,380
I ALWAYS THINK WHO IS IN HER EAR
AND PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,670
HER TO DO SOMETHING WHETHER SHE
WANTS TO WERE NOT THE.

107
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,470
SHE SEEMED MORE THAN TEAM
PLAYER THAT SHE SEEMED TO DO IT.

108
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,410
YOU SWUNG ME A LITTLE BIT.

109
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,480
MY INCLINATION IS TO SCREAM LET

110
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
HER GO.

111
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,950
IT IS ALL IN GOOD FUN.

112
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,430
HE WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

113
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,430
BUT AT

114
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,230
THE SAME TIME, WHEN YOU TAKE
INTO ACCOUNT WHAT BRENT SAID

115
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,330
ABOUT, SHE IS GOING TO JUDGE
HIM.

116
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,330
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A

117
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,191
POWER DYNAMIC, SHE IS INCREDIBLY
RICH AND FAMOUS WE CAN'T THINK

118
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:25,620
ABOUT THAT SAY THAT ABOUT THE
HARVEY WEINSTEIN OF THE WORLD,

119
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,840
IT IS NOT COMPARABLE, HE DID
TERRIBLE THINGS, THAT IS A POWER

120
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,872
DYNAMIC AND THIS IS A POWER
DYNAMIC AND TO GINA'S POINT,

121
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:37,830
THE PRODUCERS, THESE ARE HIGHLY
PRODUCED TV

122
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
SHOWS.

123
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,490
THEN IT BECOMES DOING IT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANIPULATION

124
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,300
AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF RATINGS
AND ALL THAT STUFF AND IF WE

125
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,060
SAID LET'S TAKE A 19-YEAR-OLD
VIRGIN GIRL AND FOR RATINGS

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,730
LET'S HAVE AN OLDER MAN JUST
KISS HER WITHOUT PERMISSION AND

127
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,750
THEN WE WILL CALL THAT GUY
DONALD TRUMP.

128
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,750
IF IT HAD

129
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,140
HAPPENED ON THE APPRENTICE, WE
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT AS A

130
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
POLITICAL ISSUE.

131
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,510
AND THEY WANTED TO COUPLE
WEINSTEIN THEY WOULD BRING A

132
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,000
FERN OUT THERE WITH A GUITAR.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
I AM SURE THIS KID IS LIKE
KIND OF WRITING THE HIGH OF THIS

134
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,290
MOMENT OF BEING KISSED BY KATY
PERRY AND I DO NOT THINK HE IS

135
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,070
GOING TO BE EMOTIONALLY SCARRED
BY THIS BUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

136
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,780
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS SOMETHING
THAT TAKES A WHILE, MAY BE EVEN

137
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,870
YEARS TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
WERE MADE UNCOMFORTABLE BY IT.

138
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,180
THAT IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE
MOMENT FOR YOU.

139
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,360
HE SAID HE DOES

140
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,650
NOT THINK IT IS SEXUAL
HARASSMENT NOW AND I THINK THAT

141
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,220
ASSIGNMENTS SHOULD TAKE HIM AT
HIS WORD BUT HOW IS HE GOING TO

142
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,610
FILL IN FIVE YEARS OR SO.

143
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,590
HE IS GOING TO REALIZE HE
SHOULD'VE KISSED PEOPLE

144
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,430
MUCH EARLIER AND A SITE TO
HAPPENED WITH KATY PERRY.

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,500
NOW YOU PUT ME IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND BACK

146
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,620
TO WHERE I WANTED TO GO.

147
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,550
HE SAID IT WAS NOT SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, I'M GOING TO

148
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,010
TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD.

149
00:07:00,010 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT GUILTY.
