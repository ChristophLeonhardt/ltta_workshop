WELCOME TO

"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT."

00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:12,272
THIS IS THE 13TH NIGHT IN A ROW

7
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:15,041
THAT WE HAVE LET THE SHOW WITH

8
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,876
THE BRETT KAVANAUGH STORY.

9
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:19,045
IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER DELAYS AND

10
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:20,246
COUNTLESS TWISTS IN THE SAGA, IT

11
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:23,816
MAY FINALLY BE COMING TO A

12
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,684
CONCLUSION.

13
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:26,186
THE FBI INVESTIGATION, THE ONE

14
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:27,787
THAT SENATOR JEFF FLAKE DEMANDED

15
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:28,688
LAST FRIDAY APPEARS TO BE

16
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:29,322
WRAPPING UP.

17
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:31,257
A FINAL VOTE COULD BE HELD THIS

18
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:33,059
WEEKEND, THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

19
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,393
SAYING.

20
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:35,628
WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS, AFTER ALL

21
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,096
THAT WE HAVE LEARNED, THERE ARE

22
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:37,730
STILL BASIC QUESTIONS THAT

23
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:41,034
REMAIN UNANSWERED.

24
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,635
SEVERAL MONTHS TO THE CORE

25
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:44,237
ALLEGATION HERE, THE ONES THAT

26
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:46,372
CHRISTINE FORD MADE MORE THAN

27
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:47,807
TWO WEEKS AGO.

28
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:49,075
YESTERDAY, FOR EXAMPLE, FOX NEWS

29
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:51,077
OBTAINED A WRITTEN DECLARATION

30
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:52,679
FROM AN EX-BOYFRIEND OF

31
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,280
CHRISTINE FORD'S.

32
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,882
IN THAT DECLARATION THE

33
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,684
EX-BOYFRIEND SAID THAT FORD ONCE

34
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:59,085
COACHED A FRIEND THROUGH A

35
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:01,888
POLYGRAPH EXAM TO HELP HER GET A

36
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:02,322
FEDERAL JOB.

37
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,224
IF TRUE, THAT WOULD CONTRADICT

38
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:05,592
WHAT FORD TOLD CONGRESS.

39
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:07,694
THE MAN ALSO SAID THAT DURING

40
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,295
THEIR ENTIRE SIX YEAR

41
00:01:09,296 --> 00:01:09,996
RELATIONSHIP, FORD NEVER

42
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:12,865
MENTIONED IT BEING A VICTIM OF

43
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:13,600
SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ANY OTHER KIND

44
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,403
OF TRAUMA AND SAID SHE FLEW ON

45
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:18,805
AIRPLANES MANY TIMES INCLUDING

46
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:19,572
SMALL PROP PLANES AROUND HAWAII.

47
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:22,242
YOU WILL RECALL THAT SHE WAS TOO

48
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,344
AFRAID TO FLY TO COME TO

49
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,079
WASHINGTON.

50
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,846
SHE ALSO CLAIMS SHE WAS A

51
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:28,047
CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND HE CLAIMED

52
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,882
THAT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF

53
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:31,050
ENCLOSED SPACES.

54
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,285
ARE THESE CLAIMS TRUE?

55
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:33,453
WE DON'T KNOW.

56
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:35,622
FOR DISPUTES THEM AND THERE'S NO

57
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:36,256
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THEM

58
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:39,025
INDEPENDENTLY BUT THERE'S ALSO

59
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:41,261
NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT FORD'S

60
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:41,894
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT

61
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:42,262
KAVANAUGH.

62
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:43,196
AND THAT'S A POINT, WE NEED TO

63
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,932
KNOW MORE BUT WE DON'T KNOW MORE

64
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,867
BECAUSE NO ONE IS ASKING THESE

65
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:49,836
QUESTIONS.

66
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:51,037
IN MANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

67
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:54,073
FOR EXAMPLE, WE STILL HAVEN'T

68
00:01:54,074 --> 00:01:56,276
SEEN FORD'S THERAPY NOTES.

69
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:57,477
FORD'S TEAM IS ONLY NOW AT THE

70
00:01:57,478 --> 00:01:58,278
LAST MOMENT COVERING TO REVEAL

71
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,280
THESE BUT ONLY IF THE FBI AGREES

72
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:04,250
TO INTERVIEW CHRISTINE FORD.

73
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,918
I WANT THESE NOTES TURNED OVER

74
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,453
AT THE BEGINNING OF ALL THIS?

75
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:08,855
IF THE GOAL WOULD HAVE BEEN TO

76
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,056
GET TO THE TRUTH, THEY WOULD

77
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:10,555
HAVE BEEN.

78
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:18,264
WHY HAS FORD TOLD DIFFERENT

79
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:18,598
STORIES?

80
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,265
IT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT

81
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:22,135
BEARS DIRECTLY ON HER

82
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:22,535
CREDIBILITY.

83
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,972
AND HER CREDIBILITY IS THE ONLY

84
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:27,173
REASON TO BELIEVE HER STORY IS

85
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:27,840
TRUE.

86
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,876
AND THERE ARE OTHER OBVIOUS

87
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,477
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, HERE'S

88
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:32,245
THIS ONE.

89
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,646
FORD SAID THE ASSAULT DEFINED

90
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,048
HER ENTIRE LIFE.

91
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,649
APPARENTLY, SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT

92
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,284
EVERY DAY.

93
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:38,885
IT DEFINED HER ACADEMIC

94
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:40,119
PERFORMANCE AND ALL OF HER

95
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,654
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND YET,

96
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,455
SHE SAYS SHE TOLD NOT A SINGLE

97
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:45,458
OTHER HUMAN BEING AROUND ABOUT

98
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,162
IT FOR A FULLY 30 YEARS.

99
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:50,263
HOW CAN THAT BE?

100
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,265
IN A "WASHINGTON POST" PROFILE,

101
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:55,635
FORD SAYS THAT SHE "CAME TO

102
00:02:55,636 --> 00:03:00,640
UNDERSTAND HER ASSAULT AND ITS

103
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,674
SIGNIFICANCE DURING A THERAPY

104
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:03,209
SESSION."

105
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,477
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

106
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,879
THIS IS A CENTRAL QUESTION

107
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,716
BECAUSE MOST THE PSYCHIATRIST

108
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:10,450
CONSIDER RECOVERED MEMORIES

109
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,285
HOWEVER SINCERE ROUGHLY AS

110
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,086
RELIABLE AS DREAMS.

111
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:13,720
IT'S WORTH GETTING A CLEAR

112
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,521
ANSWER ON THAT BUT SO FAR,

113
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,523
NOBODY HAS BECAUSE NOBODY HAS

114
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:18,891
ASKED THAT QUESTION.

115
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:21,627
WHY IS THAT?

116
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,730
WHEN AN ADULT MAKES A SERIOUS

117
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:27,066
ALLEGATION ASKING REAL QUESTION

118
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,935
QUESTIONS, WHAT IS THE CORRECT

119
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,069
RESPONSE?

120
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,871
IT'S NOT VICTIM SHAMING.

121
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:33,906
IN FACT, IT'S PATRONIZING NOT

122
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:34,640
TO.

123
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,608
WE DON'T CONSIDER IT CHRISTINE

124
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,944
FORD A CHILD, BUT MANY OF HER

125
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,679
ADVOCATES CLEARLY DO.

126
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
THE PRESS OBVIOUSLY DOES.

127
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,382
INSTEAD OF GATHERING FACTS ABOUT

128
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:43,282
THE STORY THEY ARE BUSY

129
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,084
MORALIZING AND LECTURING THE

130
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:47,086
REST OF US ABOUT HOW BRETT

131
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:47,887
KAVANAUGH'S VERY EXISTENCE

132
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:50,123
PROVES THAT AN ENTIRE CLASS OF

133
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:50,690
PEOPLE AS EVIL.

134
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:51,924
JUST THE OTHER DAY,

135
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,093
DONALD TRUMP JR. MADE THE POINT

136
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:55,528
THAT WHAT HE'S BEEN WATCHING ON

137
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,797
TELEVISION MAKES HIM FEAR FOR

138
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:58,498
HIS SONS.

139
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:58,798
WATCH.

140
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,367
>> WHEN I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

141
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,735
RIGHT NOW, IT'S SCARY.

142
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:05,738
>> WHO ARE YOU SCARED FOR, YOUR

143
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:06,906
SONS OR YOUR DAUGHTERS?

144
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,241
>> RIGHT NOW MY SONS.

145
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:10,943
WHEN THE OTHER SIDE WEAPONIZE IS

146
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,678
MADE AGAINST MEN AND SAYS, 40

147
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,313
YEARS LATER WE CAN BRING IT UP

148
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,883
AND YOU DID SOMETHING IN

149
00:04:16,884 --> 00:04:18,284
HIGH SCHOOL BUT NO ONE

150
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:19,018
REMEMBERS, IT SHOULD DISQUALIFY

151
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,286
YOU FROM EVER DOING ANYTHING

152
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,523
AGAIN, IT DIMINISHES THE ROLE

153
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,457
CLAIMS.

154
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:25,224
>> Tucker: MAYBE YOU AGREE

155
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:25,925
WITH THAT AND MAYBE YOU DON'T

156
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:34,467
BUT IT'S HARDLY A CRAZY POINT.

157
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,669
AND THEY ARE ATTACKING AN ENTIRE

158
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,372
ETHNIC GROUP ON THE BASIS OF THE

159
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:39,672
CITY.

160
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,674
>> EVERY NIGHT I CRY MYSELF TO

161
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:43,676
SLEEP OVER THE FEET OF WHITE MEN

162
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:47,213
IN AMERICA.

163
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,081
IT'S SUCH GARBAGE.

164
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,050
IF YOU SEXUALLY ASSAULT SOMEONE

165
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,985
IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOUR LIFE SHOULD

166
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:56,456
BE RUINED.

167
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:57,757
ALL THIS WHINING ABOUT THE POOR

168
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:00,293
PLIGHT OF THE WHITE MAN IS

169
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:00,726
RIDICULOUS.

170
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,562
>> YOU ARE HEARING A LOT OF THIS

171
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,263
FILTH RECENTLY AND IT'S WRONG

172
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:04,997
BECAUSE RACISM IS ALWAYS WRONG

173
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:07,667
NO MATTER WHO IT'S AIMED AT.

174
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:10,403
YOU SHOULD NOT ATTACK PEOPLE FOR

175
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:12,472
THEIR IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS,

176
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:15,475
PERIOD.

177
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:16,476
YOU SHOULDN'T EVER REDUCE PEOPLE

178
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,077
TO THEIR SKIN COLOR BECAUSE THEY

179
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:21,214
ARE MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

180
00:05:21,215 --> 00:05:25,418
TO TREAT PEOPLE AS INDIVIDUALS,

181
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,454
UNIQUE HUMAN BEINGS, THAT'S

182
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:29,889
EXACTLY THE ARGUMENT YOU COULD

183
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,325
HAVE MADE IN 1960 AGAINST BULL

184
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:32,859
CONNOR.

185
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,260
IF THEY'D BEEN THERE, YOU

186
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,061
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT

187
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:35,461
ARGUMENT.

188
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:38,698
IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT WE ARE

189
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,665
MAKING TODAY.

190
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,900
IT WAS TRUE THEN, IT'S TRUE NOW

191
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,468
AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE TRUE.

192
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:44,103
YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D HAVE TO

193
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:45,505
SAY SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUS IN A

194
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,306
DEVELOPED COUNTRY, ONE THAT

195
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:49,475
LITERALLY HAS A STATUE OF

196
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,109
MARTIN LUTHER KING ON THE

197
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,543
NATIONAL MALL.

198
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,345
BUT YOU DO HAVE TO SAY THAT WE

199
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:52,812
HAVE NO CHOICE.

200
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:56,015
AND FOR THE CRIME OF ARGUING

201
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:57,216
AGAINST RACISM WE ARE DENOUNCED

202
00:05:57,217 --> 00:06:03,723
BY THE LEFT AS, YES, RACIST.

203
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:04,156
THAT'S INSANE.

204
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:07,393
IT'S THE MIRROR IMAGE OF THE

205
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:10,863
TRUTH AND, THERE IS THE REASON

206
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:13,866
THAT THEY ARE SAYING IT.

207
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,268
PEOPLE ARE EASIER TO CONTROL

208
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,869
WHEN THEY ARE DIVIDED INTO

209
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,871
TRIBES SORTED BY COLOR.

210
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:19,672
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

211
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,674
IT'S ALSO THAT EVIL, JUST LIKE

212
00:06:21,675 --> 00:00:00,000
THE RACISM THEY ARE PEDALING TO
