HER IN HER GARAGE. THEY STILL NOT HAVE GOTTEN JUSTICE OR ANY SENSE OF CLOSURE. Martha: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE, MORE OF THAT ON MONDAY. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SO TONIGHT WE ARE GETTING INCREDIBLE IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE STORY BEHIND THE BIGGEST LOTTERY SCAM IN U.S. HISTORY, WORTH $25 MILLION PAID HOW A LITTLE-KNOWN MAN FROM RURAL, IOWA MANAGED TO CRACK THE SYSTEM AND RIG THE GAME IN FIVE DIFFERENT STATES. HE FOUND A WAY TO PICK THE WINNING NUMBERS BEFORE THEY WERE EVEN PICKED UP BY THE COMPUTER IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THIS. AND NOW WE KNOW HOW. THE ANSWER LIES IN THIS GRAINY SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT WAS TAKEN FROM A QUICK TRIP GAS STATION OFF OF INTERSTATE 80 IN IOWA. RAISING A LOT OF EYEBROWS IN 2010 WHEN THE MAN YOU SEE WEARING THE HOODIE AND HIDING HIS FACE COMES IN AND PURCHASES A TICKET THAT WOULD BE WORTH $16 MILLION. BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO CLAIM THE PRIZE, HE NEVER SHOWED UP. HIS LAWYER DID. JUST TWO HOURS BEFORE THE DEADLINE. DEMANDING THAT THEY WIRED THE MONEY TO A BANK IN BELIZE. SOMETHING DID NOT SMELL RIGHT, SO THAT TIPPED THE FBI IN A POSITION TO PUT THIS PROSECUTOR ROB STANDS ON THIS CASE, FINDING SOME SIMILAR SIMILARITIES IN WINNING TICKETS THE SAME YEAR, MAY 27TH, NOVEMBER 23RD, DECEMBER 29TH, ALL SOLD ON THOSE DAYS HAPPEN TO BE PURCHASED BY FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OF ONE MAN PUT HIS NAME WAS EDDIE TIPTON AND HE HAPPENED TO BE A TOP I.T. WORKER AT THE AGENCY THAT COORDINATES THE LOTTERIES BETWEEN THE STATES. ROB SAND, THE MAN WHO CRACKED THE CASE JOINS ME NOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THIS IS QUITE A STORY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COMPUTER HACKERS, EXPLAIN IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, HOW DID HE DO THIS? ESSENTIALLY HE HAD THE JOB OF WRITING CODE TO PICK THE WINNING NUMBERS. AND WHAT HE DID WAS HE ADDED JUST A COUPLE OF LINES OF CODE THAT WOULD ENABLE HIM ON CERTAIN DAYS OF THE YEAR TO ACTUALLY USE A FORMULA TO KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS WOULD BE RATHER THAN HAVING TO PICK FROM ONE IN MILLIONS, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO NARROW IT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY. Martha: IT IS INCREDIBLE, SO YOU THOUGHT THIS CASE WAS TOSSED ONTO YOUR DESK AS A YOUNG PROSECUTOR, YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO AND YOU START PIECING THINGS TOGETHER, HOW DID YOU BEGIN TO CRACK THE CASE? WE HAD A GREAT TEAM TO WORK WITH. A SPECIAL AGENTS IN THE IOWA DIVISION OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AT ANDERSON AND DON SMITH WERE HELPFUL. TERRY RICH AND ROBBIE PORTER AT THE IOWA LOTTERY WERE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL, AND REPORTERS IN WISCONSIN AS WELL. WE UNRAVELED THIS THREAD PIECE BY PIECE OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW YEARS. WE JUST HAD THE IOWA TICKET AT FIRST AND HAD TO GO TO TRIAL KNOWING ONLY ABOUT THAT TICKET WITHOUT A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO HAVE AT THE TIME. YET WE WERE ABLE TO WIN THAT CASE, SECURE A COUPLE OF GUILTY VERDICTS AND AT THAT POINT WE HAD A TIP FROM SOMEONE IN TEXAS WHO TOLD US THAT EDDIE TIPTON'S BROTHER HAD WON THE LOTTERY IN COLORADO ABOUT TEN YEARS EARLIER. WE WENT TO GOING FROM THERE FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE TICKET. Martha: YOU KNEW AFTER THE FIRST CASE WHEN YOU GOT THE HINT THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY MORE, THAT IF HE HAD DONE IT OR PULLED IT OFF THE ONE TIME, AND IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HE WORKED WITH AT THE LOTTERY ORGANIZATION, THEY LOOKED AT THE VIDEO AND HELP TO YOU GUYS FIND HIM, RIGHT? AND THEY WERE SHOCKED THAT THIS GUY THAT THEY WORKED WITH COULD BE PULLING THIS OFF. YES, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE STORY. PEOPLE SAID THINGS LIKE, IT WAS LIKE FINDING OUT THAT MY MOTHER WAS AN AX MURDERER, WAS THE QUOTE FROM ONE OF HIS BEST FRIENDS WHO HAD WORKED SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH HIM FOR OVER A DECADE. PEOPLE WERE VERY BLINDSIDED BY THE IDEA THAT HE COULD DO THIS, BUT HE WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT AND THE KNOW-HOW TO DO IT AND THE MOTIVATION TO DO IT. Martha: HAVE THEY FIXED THIS? IF ANYTHING TODAY PEOPLE ARE EVEN MORE SOPHISTICATED AT BEING ABLE TO HACK INTO SYSTEMS, SO HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT HAPPENING AGAIN? I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THERE IS DARKNESS IN THE WORLD AND THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO TRY TO HACK THE SYSTEM. WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING TO MAKE SYSTEMS BETTER AND MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM TO BACK IT UP. AS THEY SAY, YOU BUILD A BETTER MOUSETRAP, SOMEBODY BUILDS A BETTER MOUSE. Martha: VERY TRUE. THIS IS AN AMAZING STORY. GOOD FOR YOU FOR PULLING THIS OFF. YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO GET OUT EARLY? WELL, AND I WHILE WE HAVE MADE DETERMINATE SENTENCING, SO UP TO 25 YEARS, BUT HE WOULD GET A GOOD TIME CREDIT OF ABOUT HALF
