1
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:06,483
IS IT JUST A HE SAID-SHE SAID?

2
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:08,385
IS IT REALLY THAT SIMPLE?

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,787
AND WHY IS THIS NOW IN THE HANDS

4
00:00:10,787 --> 00:00:13,423
OF THE FBI?

5
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:13,690
WHY?

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,527
BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT

7
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,796
REPUBLICANS ARE BUCKLED, CAUSED

8
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:22,232
AND BOWED TO THE DEMOCRATS OR

9
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:26,536
SHOULD I SAY DEMON RATS.

10
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:28,772
THE SPECTACLE I SAW THIS WEEK

11
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:32,275
WAS ONE OF THE MOST OF PATHETIC,

12
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:33,810
DISHEARTENING, SADDEST DISPLAYS

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,280
TO WHICH THIS NATION HAS EVER

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,048
STOOD WITNESS.

15
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:40,350
IT WAS FOR ALL INTENTS AND

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,653
PURPOSES A CRUCIFIXION OF A MAN

17
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:46,456
WHO LED THE KIND OF EXEMPLARY

18
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:48,458
LIFE KNEW OF US CAN MIRROR.

19
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,961
I WAS A FELONY COURT JUDGE.

20
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,564
I WAS A PROSECUTOR AND D.A.

21
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,333
SEX CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN AND

22
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,535
CHILDREN WERE MY CRUSADE.

23
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,171
I ASSESSED WHETHER CASES SHOULD

24
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:03,307
GO FORWARD, IF THE ACCUSED

25
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,474
SHOULD BE CONVICTED AND AS A

26
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,344
JUDGE WHAT THE SENTENCE SHOULD

27
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:07,911
BE.

28
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:10,547
NO ONE SYMPATHIZES MORE THAN I

29
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,216
WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN WHO ARE

30
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:14,685
THE SILENT VICTIMS OF CRIMES.

31
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:24,528
I CREATED THE FIRST DOMESTIC

32
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,965
CHRIS TEEN  *

33
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:27,998
NARIS TEEN  *

34
00:01:27,998 --> 00:01:28,031
NATIS TEEN  *

NATIONTEEN  *

36
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:28,065
VIOLENCE SECTION IN THE NATION.

37
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:29,399
NATION.EEN  *

38
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:30,868
-- CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS A

39
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:32,302
LOVEY LADY AND I BELIEVE

40
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:33,437
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER.

41
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,239
BUT SHE IS IN OVER HER HEAD AND

42
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,175
SHE IS BEING USED.

43
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:42,279
NO MATTER HOW MANY HIPPOCAMPUS

44
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,281
BRAIN COMPARISONS SHE MADE.

45
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,751
SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THE

46
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:48,986
FUNDAMENTALS, WHOSE HOUSE IT

47
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:50,854
WAS, WHERE IT WAS, HOW SHE GOT

48
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:55,192
TO THE HOUSE OR HOW SHE GOT

49
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:55,492
HOME.

50
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:57,828
SHE WENT 36 YEARS WITHOUT

51
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:00,230
TELLING ANYONE BEFORE NOW.

52
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,433
IF FORD SAID NO ONE WAS THERE,

53
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:05,035
THAT IT WAS JUST SHE AND

54
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,037
KAVANAUGH AND JUST HE AND SHE

55
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:09,038
ALONE IN THE PARKING LOT, THEN

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,475
IT'S A TRUE HE SAID-SHE SAID.

57
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:14,244
BUT ONCE SHE CHOSE TO SAY THERE

58
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:18,015
WERE FOUR PEOPLE THERE IT'S A

59
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,717
THEY SAID.

60
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:23,221
YET ALL FOUR OF THEY SAID

61
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,922
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

62
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:26,757
THEY WEREN'T THERE.

63
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:29,193
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS

64
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:29,860
TALKING ABOUT.

65
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,296
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT

66
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,297
FORD'S MEMORY?

67
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:36,567
IF THEY WEREN'T THERE, IS IT

68
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:42,106
POSSIBLE KAVANAUGH WASN'T THERE

69
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:42,873
EITHER?

70
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:46,444
CRUCIAL HERE IS FORD'S THERAPY

71
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,312
VISIT IN 2012.

72
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:50,348
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE

73
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:52,650
DECADE SHE SAYS SHE MENTIONED

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,884
KAVANAUGH'S NAME.

75
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:56,287
IF TRUE, WHY WAS THE NAME

76
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,855
KAVANAUGH NOT IN THE THERAPIST

77
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:58,723
NOTES.

78
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:01,159
AND WHY WOULD FORD'S LAWYERS

79
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,927
WITH HOLD THOSE THERAPIST NOTES,

80
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:04,962
AT LEAST THE PART THAT REFERRED

81
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:07,465
TO THIS ALLEGED EVENT.

82
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,701
WHY WAS FORD SO EVASIVE WHEN

83
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,803
QUESTIONED BY THE PROSECUTOR ON

84
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:13,137
THIS ISSUE.

85
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:15,440
WHY DID HER ATTORNEY INTERFERE

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,076
WITH HER ANSWERING IN HER

87
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,044
TESTIMONY ON THIS POINT.

88
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,347
THE MESSAGE USED TO HELP HER

89
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,983
RECALL WHATEVER TRAUMATIC EVENT

90
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:26,517
OCCURRED.

91
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:31,589
IF A RAPE VICTIM UNDERGOES

92
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,258
HYPNOSIS THE COURT AND JURY IS

93
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,327
ENTITLED TO KNOW.

94
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:41,366
BECAUSE OF THE RISK LIKE

95
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,868
TELEVISION, NEWSPAPERS, THAT

96
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:48,273
IMPACT ONE'S MEMORY, IT IS NOT A

97
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:54,179
RELIABLE MEANS REFRESHING ONE'S

98
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:54,746
RECOLLECTION.

99
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:57,282
HER ATTORNEYS SAID SHE WAS

100
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,551
AFRAID TO FLY AND HAD TO DRIVE

101
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:00,986
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

102
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,288
BUT SHE WAS NEVER TOLD THE

103
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,889
COMMITTEE WAS WILLING TO COME TO

104
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:05,323
HER.

105
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,759
SHE IS NOT AFRAID TO FLY.

106
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,661
SHE HAS FLOWN ALL OVER THE

107
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,630
COUNTRY, THE WORLD, THE SOUTH

108
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,397
PACIFIC AND HAWAII.

109
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,299
MOVE ALL OF THAT OUT OF THE WAY.

110
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,935
WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE IS

111
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:17,601
HYPOCRISY.

112
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,603
NOT WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG,

113
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,507
WHO'S GUILTY AND INNOCENT.

114
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,075
THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE DESPERATE

115
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,077
TO WIN AT ALL COSTS.

116
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:28,246
TAKE A MAN AND HIS FAMILY DOWN,

117
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:29,347
NO PROBLEM.

118
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:31,216
IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE

119
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:32,184
HYPOCRITES.

120
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,985
JEFF FLAKE IS THE PERFECT

121
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,053
EXAMPLE.

122
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,955
HE SAYS AFTER THE HEARING HE'S

123
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,491
GOING TO VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH.

124
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:41,493
BUT THE MAN BUCKLES AFTER TWO

125
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:43,495
WOMEN SCREAM AT HIM WHILE

126
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:45,363
PREVENTING HIS ELEVATOR DOOR

127
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:46,598
FROM CLOSING.

128
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,700
>> LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING

129
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,134
TO YOU.

130
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:52,270
YOU ARE TELLING  ME MY VOTE

131
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,071
DOESN'T MATTER.

132
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:55,907
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DOESN'T

133
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:56,341
MATTER.

134
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:58,043
JUDGE JEANINE: OF COURSE IT

135
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:58,376
MATTERS.

136
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,512
BUT WHAT DOES YOUR ABUSE HAVE TO

137
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,981
DO WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH?

138
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:04,649
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN

139
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,052
HAVE BEEN ABUSED IN THIS

140
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:07,719
COUNTRY.

141
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,388
TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT ON THE

142
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:11,056
PERSON WHO ABUSED YOU.

143
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,825
GO TO COURT, CONVICT HIM, SEND

144
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:15,861
HIM TO JAIL, SPIT ON HIM, I

145
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,763
DON'T CARE.

146
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:21,099
BUT DON'T YOU DARE BLAME BRETT

147
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,302
KAVANAUGH FOR YOUR

148
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:24,202
VICTIMIZATION.

149
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:27,372
ONLY WHEN JEFF FLAKE IS DUMB

150
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:28,940
ENOUGH, WEAK ENOUGH TO NOT EVEN

151
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,313
GET.

152
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:38,083
SPARTACUS HAS THE GAL TO

153
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:38,116
SPARTACUS HAS THE -AL TO

00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:38,317

SPARTACUS HAS THE -- THE GALL TO

158
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:44,122
STAND UP AND CRITICIZE.

159
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,091
BERKE ADMITS GROPING ANOTHER

160
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,859
YOUNG WOMAN WHEN HE WAS 15.

161
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:51,029
WHY AREN'T WE GOING AFTER HIM.

162
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:57,903
AND GNATS GENIUS -- THAT GENIUS

163
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:00,839
SENATOR MAIZIE HIRONO WHO

164
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,175
ALLEGEDLY GRADUATED FROM HIGH

165
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:05,344
SCHOOL.

166
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,079
SKIPPED THE PRESUMPTION OF

167
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,851
INNOCENCE CLASS.

168
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,687
WHEN YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY

169
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,156
THE REPUBLICANS TOSSED OUT THE

170
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:17,456
RULES.

171
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:21,827
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DECLARED

172
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,062
KAVANAUGH GUILTY BEFORE YOU

173
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,496
HEARD ANY DEFENDANT MONEY

174
00:06:24,496 --> 00:06:26,565
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ACCUSER AND

175
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,467
ALL MEN SHOULD SHUT UP.

176
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,102
AND YOU ARE SAYING ALL

177
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:32,037
CONSERVATIVES ARE NOT ENTITLED

178
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,139
TO THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE?

179
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,541
WHO ARE YOU?

180
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,943
BUT MY FAVORITE, DIANNE

181
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,044
FEINSTEIN.

182
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:40,913
MADAME, YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE

183
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:42,915
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

184
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,483
AND NO ONE CAN BELIEVE ANYTHING

185
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:46,018
YOU HAVE TO SAY.

186
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:49,288
EACH OF THESE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD

187
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:53,492
BE INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI.

188
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,161
JUDGE JEANINE: TWO DAYS AGO YOU

189
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,363
