Marcus says hey been given the statistics that the statistics showed that Millennials favor gun rights are democrats shooting themselves in the foot by pushing legislation that essentially denies them the ability to oh god I think Democrats are always shooting themselves in the foot on the gun issue I think they mistake a couple of polls so I've said this many times on the show when there's a poll that shows that a vast majority of Americans support more gun control that's about the same as saying the vast majority of Americans support cuts to government it means nothing the question is do they support of this cuts government they support this gun control method so I think the Democrats mistake that as well that means that we should just shout about taking away guns nobody wants that nobody wants that when people hear gun control what they hear is something that would stop the guy from shooting up the school we all like that sounds great but when you say that also mean you're gonna have to give up your shotgun that used for home defense everybody goes nope not interested
