here Cubs Rock Trevino in fact here he is right here in the studio good to meet you right yeah do it man doing great great thank you for inviting me out no problem well Rick is running in Texas 23rd district if you watched our primary coverage on that night you heard a lot of our screaming going here clubs were behind he didn't turns out we're not the only ones San Antonio express-news said that you were one of the great underdog stories in Texas yeah and and you were indeed so now there's a new twist of the story because now you're in the runoff okay we'll get to that in a second but for the folks who didn't see it on primary night and it was really really exciting there was three of you vying to get into that top two and tell us about the guy that you beat and that is not in the runoff sure so I beat a gentleman by the name of Jake he leans nice guy but he is a establishment candidate he was backed up by the Castro brothers who Leon and Joaquin very influential in Texas politics also be back in October the guy before you even had a bio and his pager issues on his page he had the endorsement of like a tea house for Representatives so he was the DC candidate and you know the d-triple-c back them up old pack you know also the blue dog pack so he was a third way you know democratic coalition so he's that moderate proud moderate and he spent he raised spent upwards to $500,000 and me and this other lady named Judy Canales were in a fantastic race in the winter garden area and in the district we both beat Jay who spent really what it would take a teacher about ten years of work to you know to earn so it really shows the accomplishment of what we've done and that grassroots politics is really alive and well in the United States so Rick he spent five hundred thousand dollars but what did you spend a little less than like maybe 480 or 400 you specially up into the primer about twenty two thousand dollars so that that equates to about two thousand sixty four cents of vote and Jay was spinning up upwards close to sixty bucks a vote and then the winner Gina Jones she spent ten as much as me about 20 bucks of oh yeah well at least some consultants were very happy down in Texas so that's the thing I think what you've been what you saw you saw it also in the Texas is 21st district as well you see the d-triple-c really fleeced these candidates and whether they want to lose they got paid and I think you guys have done some reporting and we seen some reporting from the left media about it these contract stipulations that that these d-trip candidates have to are held to so it really limits the way they spend our money and it's very so basically DC has created this environment that's insular it serves itself and instead of doing field in mail they say well let's just do a bunch of TV and and I'm glad that these people are now in our race again and help you not Gina Jones because they are the worst political minds that you could find in in Texas they don't have a good track record here and it shows the disconnect that Washington has with our district and that's why I think you're seeing a strength and resurgence of grassroots candidates like myself so I it reminds me what FDR said I welcome their hatred when when the powerful and the rich were fighting against them this is a topsy-turvy world in the old days people would bag the d-triple-c there yeah to support them right now and it's such a mark of shame in a sense that yeah like if they go to support your opponent you're like yes hey well I think what you're seeing is the American people realizing the influence of the donor class in our politics and I like to tell people that if we continue to get you know sent people that come from the same places that say the same things and take money from the same folks we get the same results and the proof of that representation is our lives the donor classes they are basically the ones that handpick these candidates and that representation has led to the society that we're living in which really doesn't work for working-class people so some some candidates might actually like the fact that they're backed up by the d-triple-c but they're so out of touch with what's going on because the d-trip analyze this they are establishment candidates say yes they are socially progressive but when it comes to economics and finance they're as interest and hard ride as you could get I mean really you have one party in this country as a business party it's got two factions Dems and Republicans and I'm fighting within the Democratic Party just to represent working-class people you can say your working class but I mean in the past or you were a banker right always been a teacher but funny you bring that up like you know if I would have taken a different path in life like even if I would have taught in a different area of town you know I don't think I'd have been the person that I am you know teaching on the east side of San Antonio one of the poorest ZIP codes in the United States of America I was a part was called a Promise Neighborhood initiative was part of Obama's urban revitalization programs across the country and I got to see poverty every single day and it really created the kind of person that I am and the type of politician that I am is yes I ruffle feathers and the establishment doesn't like me but they don't like me not because of my ideas but because I'm not beholding to them yeah look I'm given the links here earlier I want to make sure that you click on the links in the description box if you're watching on YouTube in the conversation on Facebook Rick 4:23 calm just Democrat calm slash Rick 2018 for donations he's he's not gonna get the big donor money so you gotta help him out you can tell because he's got that just Democrat shirt I've never seen that before yeah that's badass it's got your name on it yeah and we were just talking about how you guys are like the Avengers and here you're coming with like an Avenger like shirt everybody love these shirts they gave me a dozen of these I own on two but the rest I've given out but yeah there I think people always say hey what's up with that logo and then it starts that conversation about what JD's doing and how were challenged challenging corporate Democrats and and supporting non-traditional candidates like myself so I think it's really exciting to be part of this movement with JD brand new Congress our revolution like the these are like the first iteration of new political organizations that came out of this movement and we've seen success and we're also trying to draw attention to you know the hustle that is American politics and how you know how the donor class has been influencing our lives so in this case D Triple C has have they literally endorsed your opponent now and then off yeah and so isn't that weird because I in the memo that we unveiled at the young turks we found a memo that they had sent to the candidates not you because if they did one never wanted to support you and and it said that you know that you shouldn't pick sides and then you should have a kumbaya moment afterwards and boy we got a great one in 21st district when Derrick crow lost and then supported mighty Mary Wilson and and now she's the JD candidate etc but they seem to like that you said you wanted unity but they weren't supposed to pick sides but here they are in a primary saying yeah I like this step we'll grab better than I like that democratic because she has more money one of the most damaging there it is that came out of the 2016 primary was the fact and that came out of from the leaks ever written in English about how the d-trip and the DNC tipped the scales for Hillary the same thing you know the Hillary if you go back even in oh wait the Hillary camp actually thought the d-trip was tipping the scales for Obama then so like you seen that in where the whether it was a no wait or 2016 you you got a sense that the d-triple-c wasn't playing fair and they know this and they still are entering elections early we saw what happened with in Houston 7:00 that can be attack against Laura Moser I think it was really inappropriate and you know if anything I think they think these run offs are an annoyance and they want to get through with them it's like and they're coming in and they're tipping the scale against a working class candidate a teacher a mexican-american a district at seventy percent Latino you know I think it goes to show where they're at and the d-trip wants doesn't want what we want and when I say we have talking about the American people they don't want Medicare for all the living wage or free cause universities they don't want that because you know that it will hurt their interest and and really you've seen the 1% co-op both parties and I've been successful because of the issues that I'm running on and working people like them yeah so Rick I was just did tweet earlier today supporting Allison aartsen who was another JD yeah against Dianne Feinstein as she sent her bots and it's super obvious that they the Feinstein campaign as these all of a sudden all these real people appear with the same exact message why hurting the Democratic Party shouldn't we be fighting republished shouldn't we spend all of our money cuz their money obsessed I'm like yeah you sound like a real person shouldn't we be spending our money attacking Republicans so I wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to that so they're saying basically why don't you just get out of the way already and they've already picked the winner and let's just save all of our money to fight against the Republican in the face well look I've been a Democrat at least an official level for like six years now and you know when is it appropriate to have a debate in a primary and a run-up I think that's the most appropriate time to have a debate and in the democracy we wish you shouldn't be afraid of having a debate and the reality is if you look at you know the the the leadership of the Democratic Party they always say that it's not appropriate to be critical of our own party that as if it's going to hurt us but really what we need to have is a is an honest dialogue about ourselves and where we're going as a party you know we've lost a lot of seats across the country ever since Obama came into office because we're not vision oriented and what you've seen with JD and brand-new Congress and oh are they're they're electing candidate or they're supporting candidates that are looking for the future and when we're talking about Medicare fraud we're talking about a society that guarantees health care is our right then no longer is someone going to be profiteering off of your misfortune and that's what we see here now and you know it's I know they're threatened by it but we need to have this discussion because you know the American people have to see what is happening to their party the Democratic Party doesn't talk about military foreign policy anymore I have yet to be asked one question on this and I don't think the media has done a good job vetting me or my opponents about where we stand on the Iran nuclear deal our relationship with Saudi Arabia Yemen drones you know the leaks that came out of the drone papers Jeremy Scahill the assassination complex some of those stories you know they really troubled me and and I saw a Democratic Party that was there railing against the Bush administration when this happened and now because Obama embraced it and expanded those things were silent on them I mean we we need to make sure that we're not only just sending Democrats and working-class Democrats but Democrats are gonna say no to war and it really does hurt me to see so many jobs in my district rely on that complex and I won move to a immoral type of economy and a society that is trying to create peace you know and I just think that that's what's missing in our in our dialogue right now you talked about Dianne Feinstein and I'm not surprised that she has all those BOTS seeing how she knows everything that the NSA is doing and you know what I mean it just it goes to show how how how politically vulnerable the American people are right now I think with that that the hack of Cambridge analytics what we got we got to see what these institutions that are doing to manipulate the American people keep them away from the issues that are through that they really care about and now we're talking about a star McDaniels or the the chaos in the Trump White House but we're not talking about the real problems in my district which is a health care which is the infrastructure and in my district all we ever talk about is the border and now Trump is gonna send the military to my to my district insinuating that it's like a war zone that it needs to be protected like that and I mean we we need to have candidates that talk about real issues and then put the focus of the American people on the stuff that really matters and not this drama in DC right well when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail right yeah so their answer for everything and I think that why they like your opponent is oh we'll pretend this about the jobs in your district but it's really about the money that's coming in from the military industrial complex fara giant donor checks to Democratic Party over and over again and if we don't recapture the Democratic Party what's the point of meeting their opponents if they're gonna vote the same way anyway on all the financial issues and all the things that affect our lives the wages etc then there's no point at all so last thing for you Rick so she does have a serious financial advantage yeah she's got Washington back in her and all that I'm sure they'll bring in some endorsements for her and etc so how are you gonna beat her so yeah so in terms of financial numbers she released a bit that she raised $700,000 in this first quarter which is Wow a disgusting amount of money really is it I mean think about what all that money could be used for in stand what it's gonna be used for is paying consultants to make slick videos and then dozens and dozens of mailers to people so it's a really passive campaign the way they interact with the with the with the electorate is gonna be you know you know very passive and not and not personal and I need a personal touch so the way I'm gonna win is to first concentrate on the areas where the voting base is active that's in South Texas right now there's a lot of countywide elections in that district also there are some just some real advantages to me in this race I am the only Mexican American and the race so I could compete in that this is the way she can and it's bilingual you know I lived on the border all my life over 20 years my mother's when all that over Mexico I have family on the border have family and an Eagle Pass so I understand the culture so I'm gonna be able to campaign and interact with the with the with the district you know in a political sense that she can't and will also run off certain primaries I mean that the same amount of voters come out and what I've seen from this movement the burning movement is that we have a motivated voting base and we know what's on the line and that's why they were supporting me not just because they weren't looking for numbers and money to support the Karen they were looking for ideas so I know that I'm on May 22nd that they're gonna be there again so you guys could help out by donating signing up to volunteer making phone calls but you know we have a candidate that's well financed and a candidate like me gets up when working people from across the country chip in a bit Rick I got your nickname giant-slayer Rick true okay yeah like that because look you already took down Jay Hollings he's spending no four hundred thousand dollars and he's already gone now your next opponents got seven hundred thousand in just one quarter but here comes Rick Trevino and then finally we take down the Republican it was three for three richer Reno winner of the Battle Royale in the 23rd district how great would it be to say that on election now it's gonna be nice alright Joyce lair okay Thank You Man thank you alright everybody go to the links go help Rick
