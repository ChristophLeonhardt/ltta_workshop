1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:05,705
CHIANG RAI, TAKEN BY AMBULANCE.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,607
NINE OTHER MEMBERS ARE IN THE

3
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:07,807
CAVE.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:08,841
MORE RAIN IS IN THE FORECAST.

5
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:12,545
THIS IS THE START OF THE RAINY

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:12,978
SEASON IN THAILAND.

7
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,414
RESCUE CREWS SAY IT MAY TAKE UP

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:18,318
TO FOUR MORE DAYS TO GET

9
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:22,989
EVERYBODY OUT.

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,724
BEN TRACY IS IN CHIANG RAI,

11
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,459
JOINING US FROM THE HOSPITAL

12
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,729
WHERE THE BOYS WERE TAKEN.

13
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,867
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,300
CONDITION?

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,404
>> Reporter: THEY ARRIVED LATE

16
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:38,738
LAST NIGHT.

17
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,673
FOUR PEOPLE RESCUED.

18
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,741
ONE INTERESTING THING, WE ARE

19
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:48,748
READING ONE OF THE PEOPLE

20
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,983
RESCUED WOULD BE THE 25-YEAR-OLD

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,784
COACH, THREE RESCUED AND THE

22
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:51,984
COACH.

23
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,052
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD FOR DAYS NOW

24
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,156
THAT HE WAS IN PERHAPS THE WORST

25
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,256
SHAPE OF ANYONE INSIDE.

26
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,958
THAT'S BECAUSE EARLY ON IN THIS

27
00:00:58,958 --> 00:00:59,959
ORDEAL, APPARENTLY HE GAVE THE

28
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,961
BOYS ALL THE FOOD AND WATER THAT

29
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,863
HE HAD ON HIM WHEN THEY FIRST

30
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,266
WENT INTO THE CAVE, BEFORE THEY

31
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,733
WERE FOUND BY THE RESCUERS.

32
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,736
SO HE APPARENTLY HAD BEEN

33
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,538
SUFFERING FROM MALNUTRITION AND

34
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,471
WAS NOT IN GOOD SHAPE.

35
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,806
SO THAT APPEARS THAT HE IS ONE

36
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,942
OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAS COME OUT.

37
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,844
IN TERMS OF THEIR CONDITION, THE

38
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,045
BOYS AND THE COACH WILL BE

39
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,413
EVALUATED AT THIS HOSPITAL FOR

40
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,948
THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE DAYS.

41
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,683
THIS IS ALSO WHERE THE YOUNG

42
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,084
BOYS WILL BE REUNITED WITH THEIR

43
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,386
FAMILIES BECAUSE WHEN THEY CAME

44
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,154
OUT OF THE CAVE, THERE WAS VERY

45
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,756
LITTLE TIME FROM THE MINUTE THEY

46
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,558
WALKED OUT OF THE CAVE, TO WHEN

47
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,893
THEY GOT OUT OF THOSE

48
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:34,894
HELICOPTERS WAS LESS THAN TWO

49
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:35,127
MINUTES.

50
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:36,362
THEIR FAMILIES HAVE NOT BEEN

51
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:43,770
ABLE TO SPEND MUCH TIME WITH

52
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,904
THEM.

53
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,571
THAT'LL HAPPEN AT THE HOSPITAL.

54
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,406
BROOK?

55
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:48,708
>> BEN, THE SECOND ATTEMPT IS

56
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,009
SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING OR

57
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,578
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

58
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,113
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THAT?

59
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,949
>> Reporter: SO THE OPERATION

60
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,648
BEGINS AGAIN THIS MORNING.

61
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,351
THEY WILL GO IN, TRY TO BRING

62
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,919
OUT ANOTHER GROUP OF BOYS FROM

63
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:00,186
THE CAVE.

64
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,155
THE REASON THERE IS A BIT OF LAG

65
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,456
IN THE TIME ON THIS OPERATION,

66
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,058
THEY TOLD US LAST NIGHT IT WOULD

67
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,926
BE ABOUT TEN TO 20 HOURS BEFORE

68
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,794
WE MIGHT SEE ANOTHER GROUP OF

69
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:09,929
BOYS EMERGE FROM THE CAVE.

70
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,130
THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY

71
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,966
BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK INTO

72
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,168
THIS CAPE AND REPLACE ALL THE

73
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,402
OXYGEN TANKS ALONG THE

74
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:16,835
EVACUATION ROUTE.

75
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,537
THE WAY THAT THIS WORKS IS AS

76
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:23,142
THEY'RE COMING OUT OF THE CAVE,

77
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,311
THERE ARE CANISTERS

78
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,846
STRATEGICALLY PLACED, SO THEY

79
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,614
CAN REPLACE THEIR OXYGEN SO

80
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,382
THERE IS AMPLE OXYGEN IF THEY

81
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,986
HAVE TO STAY IN THERE FOR LONGER

82
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,186
TIME.

83
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,887
THEY HAD TO GO REPLACE THOSE,

84
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:36,889
THEN GET THE DIVERS ON THE LONG

85
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:37,924
YOUR HONOREE THAT TAKES ABOUT

86
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:41,260
SIX HOURS TO WHERE THE BOYS ARE.

87
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,228
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOME TIME

88
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,999
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO

89
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,434
TO GET THEM OUT, AND THEN BEGIN

90
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,235
THE LONG JOURNEY BACK.

91
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,104
THIS IS WHY OFFICIALS HERE HAVE

92
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,805
SAID THIS MAY TAKE PLACE OVER

93
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,775
THE COURSE OF TWO TO FOUR DAYS.

94
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,076
IT'S A VERY LONG AND

95
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:57,743
LABOR-INTENSIVE PROCESS.

96
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,180
>> AND, BEN, IT LOOKS PRETTY

97
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,148
SUNNY THERE IN CHIANG RAI.

98
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,551
THIS IS THE START OF THE MONSOON

99
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:05,785
SEASON.

100
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,387
THE WEATHER REPORT ISN'T GREAT

101
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,455
BUT HOW HAS THE WEATHER BEFORE

102
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,724
SO FAR THE SUN HAS BEEN UP?

103
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,326
>> Reporter: SO IT'S JUST KIND

104
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:13,593
OF CLOUDY.

105
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,161
YOU LOOK IN THE DISTANCE AND YOU

106
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,496
SEE SOME CLOUDS THAT LOOK LIKE

107
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,129
WE MAY HAVE RAIN TODAY.

108
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,364
IT'S RARE THIS TIME OF THE YEAR

109
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,266
TO HAVE A DAY WHERE YOU DON'T

110
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:20,833
HAVE RAIN.

111
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,201
THEY DID GET LUCKY FOR ABOUT

112
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,337
THREE DAYS IN A ROW.

113
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,571
IT WAS ABNORMALLY DRY HERE,

114
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,073
WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE TAKEN

115
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,141
THIS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO

116
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,911
TRY TO GET THESE BOYS OUT OF THE

117
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,446
CAVE, BUT AS YOU SAY, THOSE

118
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,680
MONSOON RAINS ARE BACK.

119
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,317
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WE'VE HAD

120
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:37,750
SEVERAL DOWNPOURS.

121
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,088
WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ISF

122
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:42,755
SUSTAINED MONSOON RAIN, THOSE

123
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,257
WOULD LIKELY FLOOD THE CAVE

124
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,226
AGAIN AND IF YOU FLOOD THE CAVE

125
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,429
AGAIN YOU CUT OFF THE RESCUERS'

126
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,830
ACCESS TO THESE BOYS.

127
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,964
THEY COULD BE STRANDED AND THE

128
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:55,368
VERY SMALL PIECE OF REAL ESTATE

129
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,003
THEY'RE CURRENTLY ON COULD GET

130
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,637
SMALLER AS THOSE FLOODWATERS

131
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,938
RISE, SO THEY FEEL THIS IS A

132
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,440
RACE AGAINST TIME AND THE

133
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,942
WEATHER ASK THEY'RE HOPING TODAY

134
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,644
THEY WILL HAVE AT LEAST FOUR

135
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,012
MORE OUT, WHICH WOULD MEAN THEY

136
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,780
HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE

137
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,816
PEOPLE WHO WERE STRANDED THERE

138
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,451
IN THE CAVE FREE.

139
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:11,684
BROOK?

140
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,719
>> AND BEST YOU CAN DESCRIBE

141
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,388
THAT REAL ESTATE, IT'S A LONG

142
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,490
WAY, IT'S NOT WET THE WHOLE WAY

143
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,959
DOWN WITH THIS LEVEL OF WATER.

144
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,760
THERE COULD BE MORE WATER

145
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,031
POURING IN THAT WOULD MAKE THE

146
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:25,331
DIVE HARDER.

147
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,101
HOW DO WE -- HOW SHOULD WE

148
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,469
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT SPACE LOOK?

149
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,338
>> Reporter: YEAH, SO WHAT WE'RE

150
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,374
TOLD IS THEY FOUND THIS DRY,

151
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,076
KIND OF ELEVATED PIECE OF LAND

152
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,278
WHERE THEY HAD BEEN HUDDLED FOR

153
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,613
16 DAYS NOW ESSENTIALLY.

154
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,716
ONCE THEY BEGIN THE JOURNEY OUT

155
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,318
OF THE CAVE, OUR UNDERSTANDING

156
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,153
IS THERE ARE PARTS THAT ARE

157
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,788
FLOODED AND IT'S USUALLY THOSE

158
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,288
NARROW PASSAGE WAYS.

159
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,223
IMAGINE IF YOU'RE WALKING IN A

160
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,494
CAVE OR GOING ON A HIKE AND YOU

161
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,362
GO UP A STEEP INCLINE AND A

162
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,563
DECLINE, NOW IMAGINE IN THAT'S

163
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,698
INSIDE A CAVE WHERE YOU HAVE

164
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,666
ROCK ABOVE YOU AND FILL IT ALL

165
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,834
UP WITH WATER, THAT IS BASICALLY

166
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,302
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SWIM

167
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:05,271
THROUGH TO GET OUT OF THIS CAVE.

168
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,472
BUT WE ARE TOLD THAT ONCE THEY

169
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,573
GET TO A CERTAIN POINT IT'S

170
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,941
PRETTY MUCH DRY LAND FROM THERE

171
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,543
AND THEY CAN WALK MUCH OF THE

172
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,211
WAY AND THAT IS BECAUSE THEY

173
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,680
HAVE PUMPED SO MUCH WATER OUT OF

174
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,250
THIS CAVE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

175
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,219
UPWARDS OF 35 MILLION GALLONS OF

176
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:20,586
WATER.

177
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,754
SO CERTAINLY THOSE EFFORTS HAVE

178
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,054
PAID OFF.

179
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:25,825
THAT'S PART OF WHY WE ALSO SAW

180
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826
YESTERDAY THIS FIRST RESCUE

181
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:33,165
OPERATION WENT MUCH QUICKER THAN

182
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,835
THEY TOLD US IT WOULD.

183
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,470
WE SAW THE FIRST TWO BOYS COME

184
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,104
OUT IN LESS THAN EIGHT HOURS.

185
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:40,740
THEY'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND

186
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,775
HOPING TO REPEAT THAT AGAIN

187
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,677
TODAY, BUT OBVIOUSLY A LOT CAN

188
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,646
STILL GO WRONG SO THERE IS A LOT

189
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:46,979
TO FOCUS ON.

190
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,316
>> BEN TRACY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

191
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,820
WE'LL BE WATCHING YOUR REPORTS

192
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,689
IN HOURS AHEAD CBS MONDAY

193
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:56,922
MORNING.

194
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:57,323
THANK YOU, BEN.

195
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,626
>> I WANT TO BRING IN DAVE

196
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,296
SEARS, HE JOINS US NOW BY PHONE,

197
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,797
FROM WASHINGTON, A FORMER NAVY

198
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,665
SEAL.

199
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,068
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT THE SITUATION

200
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,337
IS THERE, AND WHAT THE CAVE IS

201
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,638
LIKE, WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST

202
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,407
CONCERNS, THE BIGGEST THREATS IN

203
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,007
YOUR HEAD?

204
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,976
>> Reporter: REALLY, IT'S GOING

205
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,910
TO BE BEATING THE RAINS.

206
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,513
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT

207
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,614
UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE

208
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,814
CONDITIONS YOU CAN AND I BELIEVE

209
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,884
THE REASON THEY'RE ABLE TO MOVE

210
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,687
THESE KIDS OUT IS BECAUSE A LOT

211
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,322
OF THE JOURNEY TREKKED THROUGH

212
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,823
THE CAVE IS ABOVE WATER AND THEY

213
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,959
DON'T HAVE TO DIVE THE WHOLE

214
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,860
THING, SO THEY'RE EITHER WADING

215
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,395
THEM AND FLOATING THEM AND

216
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,897
THEY'RE ABLE TO WALK LARGE

217
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,998
PORTIONS IF THAT CAVE GETS

218
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,300
FLOODED UP AGAIN WITH THE RAINS,

219
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,935
THEN YOU'RE TALKING TOTAL DIVE

220
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,939
TO GET THEM OUT, WHICH IS JUST

221
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,275
ALMOST UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THE

222
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:49,775
KIDS.

223
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,944
IT TOOK SIX HOURS FOR

224
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,046
EXPERIENCED DIVERS TO KNOCK IT

225
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:54,246
OUT.

226
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,182
>> PRETTY CONSIDERABLE BREAK

227
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,651
BETWEEN THE LAST RESCUES, WHICH

228
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,620
WERE COMPLETED NOW, WHAT,

229
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,821
14 HOURS AGO.

230
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,589
TALK ABOUT WHAT THESE CREWS

231
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,691
WOULD BE DOING IN THESE

232
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,191
INTERVENING HOURS?

233
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:09,695
OBVIOUSLY THEY WANT TO DO THIS

234
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,762
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

235
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,298
WHY DO THEY NEED THIS TIME?

236
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,501
>> THEY NEED THIS TIME TO

237
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,469
REPLENISH THE OXYGEN OR

238
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,369
COMPRESSED AIR TANKS OR WHATEVER

239
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,472
THEY HAPPEN TO BE USING TO GET

240
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,376
AIR UNDER WATER AND IN THE CAVE.

241
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,312
SO IMAGINE, THIS IS OVER 2 1/2

242
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,813
MILES OF CAVE THEY HAVE TO GO

243
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,748
THROUGH AND THERE ARE CERTAIN

244
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,849
PORTIONS WHERE THEY HAVE TO DIVE

245
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,252
DOWN SO THEY'RE GOING TO NEED

246
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,287
THAT SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN OR

247
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,423
SUPPLEMENTAL AIR AND THEY'VE

248
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,291
UTILIZED THAT.

249
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,260
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE RESCUERS

250
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,197
COMING IN, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE

251
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:49,869
TANKS COMING IN, AIR CUBIC FOOT

252
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,069
TANKS.

253
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:50,903
THEY HAVE TO NOT ONLY BRING IN

254
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,305
THEIR OWN IN ORDER TO DIVE, BUT

255
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,207
THEY HAVE TO CARRY IN SPARES SO

256
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:56,342
THEY CAN HAVE SUPPLEMENTAL

257
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,377
OXYGEN FOR THE KIDS THAT ARE

258
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,479
COMING OUT.

259
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,349
SO THEY HAVE TO REDO THAT ENTIRE

260
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,119
2 1/2 MILES OF CAVE SYSTEM WITH

261
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,688
ALL THESE SUPPORT SYSTEMS IN

262
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:09,889
PLACE.

263
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,024
SO THAT'S ALL BEEN UTAH LIESED

264
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,658
TO GET FOUR OUT.

265
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,227
THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE

266
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:20,266
ANOTHER BREAK TO REPLENISH THAT

267
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:20,899
STOCK AGAIN.

268
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,234
-- UTILIZED TO GET FOUR OUT.

269
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,402
THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE TO TAKE

270
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,870
ANOTHER BREAK TO GET THEM OUT.

271
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,607
>> WE'VE SEEN THE BOYS 11 TO 16

272
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,709
AND THEY AREN'T IN GREAT

273
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,843
PHYSICAL CONDITION AND MANY OR

274
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,779
MOST OF THEM CANNOT SWIM OR SWIM

275
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,380
WELL.

276
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,082
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS VERY

277
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,683
TREACHEROUS DIVE, GRANTED WITH

278
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:39,919
THE SUPPORT OF TWO EXPERT

279
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,087
DIVERS, BUT IF YOU ARE ONE OF

280
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,423
THOSE EXPERT DIVERS TRYING TO

281
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,558
HELP THESE VERY NOVICE DIVERS,

282
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,293
SWIMMERS THROUGH THIS, WHAT ARE

283
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:47,793
YOUR MAIN CONCERNS?

284
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,897
WHAT DO YOU TRY TO DO TO HELP

285
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:51,564
THAT SITUATION?

286
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,699
HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT WHAT SEEMS

287
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,900
LIKE A VERY CHALLENGING FIRST

288
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,602
DIVE FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER

289
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,703
PUT ON A SCUBA MASK?

290
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,840
>> YOUR BIGGEST FIRST CONCERN IS

291
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,574
YOU HAVE CONSTANT AIR, RIHT?

292
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,176
THAT'S THE LARGEST ONE WE WANT

293
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,544
TO WORRY ABOUT.

294
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,812
SO THAT'S MITIGATED SOMEWHAT BY

295
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,014
THIS FULL FACE MASK THEY'RE

296
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,515
GOING TO WEAR AND THEY CAN'T

297
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,117
ESSENTIALLY -- IT'S VERY

298
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,720
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF

299
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,988
OR BE INADVERTENTLY HIT OR A

300
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,023
MISTAKE COMES AGAINST SOMETHING

301
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,091
THAT COMES OUT LIKE A NORMAL

302
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:19,758
MOUTH PIECE SOMETHING MIGHT.

303
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,394
THAT FACE MASK WILL KEEP THEM

304
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:21,727
AIR.

305
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,563
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ON

306
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:25,664
THEM AS AIR.

307
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:30,135
THE SWIMMING PART YOU COULD USE

308
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,436
DIFFERENT PIECES AND LIFE

309
00:09:31,436 --> 00:09:33,773
JACKETS AND INFLATE AND DEFLATE

310
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,775
AND HELP PUSH THE KIDS ALONG OR

311
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,609
LET THEM WALK ON THE BOTTOM.

312
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,778
YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS MAKING

313
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,111
SURE THEY HAVE AIR THE ENTIRE

314
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,715
TIME AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

315
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,617
YOU'RE READY FOR THE CONTINGENCY

316
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:49,021
IF THEY USE IT, IF THEY -- AIR

317
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,723
SUPPLY HOSE GETS CUT ON A ROCK

318
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,192
YOU'RE RED TO REACT TO THAT.

319
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,627
YOU ONLY HAVE LESS THAN A MINUTE

320
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,028
WITHOUT AIR FOR MOST OF THESE

321
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,030
KIDS IS GOING TO PUT THEM

322
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,031
UNCONSCIOUS.

323
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,866
SO YOU HAVE TO REACT QUICKLY,

324
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:06,939
BUT CALMLY AND MOVE THEM THROUGH

325
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,507
THE CAVE SYSTEM.

326
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:08,908
>> OKAY.

327
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:12,678
FORMER NAVY SEAL, DAVE SEARS,

328
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:18,250
JOINING US, THANK YOU, DAVE.

329
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,386
BBC REPORTER JONATHAN HEAD HAS

330
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,921
BEEN FOLLOWING THE RESCUE AND

331
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,022
THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES SOLVED IN

332
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:23,723
THE MISSION.

333
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,124
>> Reporter: IT BEGAN WITH MORE

334
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,326
DIVERS AND AIR TANKS GOING IN

335
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,229
AND ALL OTHER NONESSENTIAL

336
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,331
VEHICLES BEING SENT OUT.

337
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:39,572
A DARING AND COMPLEX RESCUE WAS

338
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:39,838
UNDERWAY.

339
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,941
THE GOVERNOR WHO COMMANDS THE

340
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,909
OPERATION DESCRIBED IT AS D-DAY.

341
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,912
CONDITIONS WILL NEVER BE BETTER,

342
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,379
HE SAID.

343
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:48,914
AFTER THAT DRAMATIC DISCOVERY ON

344
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,483
MONDAY, THE BOYS HAVE BEEN FED

345
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,252
AND TREATED BY AN ARMY MEDIC ON

346
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,955
THE ROCK SHELF WHERE THEY'D BEEN

347
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,023
FORCED TO RETREAT BY RISING

348
00:10:58,023 --> 00:10:58,223
WATER.

349
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:00,025
THEY WERE JUDGED FIT ENOUGH TO

350
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:02,995
MAKE THE JOURNEY, THOUGH NONE

351
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,930
HAS EVER DIVED BEFORE.

352
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,700
IT INVOLVES TWO DIVERS SWIMMING

353
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,602
WITH EACH CHILD WHO IS TETHERED

354
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,637
TO THE CHILD IN FRONT AND FOLLOW

355
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,540
A GUIDE ROPE TO HELP WITH

356
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,241
DIFFICULT RAIN AND POOR

357
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:15,775
VISIBILITY.

358
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,843
THE NARROWEST PART OF THE ROUTE

359
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,445
IS LESS THAN 40 CENTIMETERS

360
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:19,745
WIDE.

361
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,748
THE BOYS ARE HELPED THROUGH BY

362
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,749
THE DIVER IN FRONT BEFORE

363
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:30,189
RESTING ON A ROCKY OUT CROP AND

364
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:30,489
CONTINUING.

365
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:31,657
AS THE LIGHT OUTSIDE FADED, THE

366
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,458
SIGHT OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND THE

367
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,128
SOUND OF HELICOPTERS TOLD US AT

368
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,497
LEAST SOME OF THEM WERE OUT.

369
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:42,167
THEY WERE THEN FLOWN TO THE CITY

370
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:42,567
OF CHIANG RAI.

371
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,436
>> THIS IS WHAT ALL OF THOSE

372
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:45,637
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE.

373
00:11:45,637 --> 00:11:49,074
WE SAW TWO AMBULANCES GO INTO

374
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:53,278
THIS HOSPITAL EARLIER.

375
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:53,645
THAT'S ANOTHER.

376
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:54,680
THE BOYS ARE COMING OUT.

377
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,683
>> Reporter: THEN THE GOVERNOR

378
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,850
MADE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

379
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,885
AFTER 16 DAYS OF WAITING, TODAY

380
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,122
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FACES OF

381
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,358
THE WILD BOARS, HE SAID, TO

382
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:06,958
CHEERING JOURNALISTS REFERRING

383
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,562
TO THE ANYMORE MAKE THAT OF THE

384
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,062
BOYS FOOTBALL TEAM.

385
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,997
THE FOUR WHO WERE BROUGHT OUT

386
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,533
TODAY WERE DESCRIBED BY ONE

387
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,201
RESCUER AS DOING REMARKABLY

388
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:16,434
WELL.

389
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:20,372
THEY HOPED TO GET THE REMAINING

390
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,573
NINE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

391
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:21,874
>> OKAY.

392
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,945
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON

393
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,779
THE SITUATION FROM THAILAND

394
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,514
RESCUE EFFORTS STILL UNDERWAY.

395
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:32,150
FOR NOW A SHORT BREAK.

396
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,651
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.

397
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:32,597
>>> 600 MILES ON FOOT THROUGH TO

398
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,566
THE SOUTH POLE ITSELF.

399
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,772
WE ARE GOING TO SURVIVE ONLY ON

400
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,539
RENEWABLE ENERGY.

401
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,440
IT'S AN ACT OF TAKING THE

402
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,243
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CALL TO

403
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:49,748
ACTION IN RELATION TO CLIMATE,

404
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,916
IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

405
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,118
I'M TAKING A FEARFUL BATTERING

406
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,453
TODAY FOR ALL SIDES.

407
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,392
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH PAIN

408
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:00,792
THAT MAN IS IN.

409
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,961
>> ALL IT TAKES IS THAT ONE

410
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,530
DEGREE TOO FAR AND YOU CAN DIE.

411
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:11,136
>> IF WE COULD SURVIVE OUT THERE

412
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:18,310
ONLY ON RENEWABLE IN THE HOSTILE

413
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,211
PLACE, PEOPLE CAN MAKE A

414
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,414
DIFFERENCE.

415
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,116
>> RESCUE DIVERS IN THAILAND ARE

416
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,450
GETTING BACK IN THE WATER.

417
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,685
IT'S MONDAY MORNING ALREADY IN

418
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:30,889
THAILAND AND THEY'RE HOPING TO

419
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:31,790
RESCUE MORE MEMBERS OF THAT THAI

420
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,026
SOCCER TEAM STUCK IN A CAVE FOR

421
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,294
MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

422
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,361
ALREADY FOUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN

423
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:36,595
RESCUED.

424
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,665
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT MISSION

425
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,833
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.

426
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,569
WE WANT TO DISCUSS IT BRENT WHO

427
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,872
JOINS US FROM GASTONIA, NORTH

428
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:51,009
CAROLINA, THE PRESIDENT OF SINK

429
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:51,543
OR SWIM SCUBA.

430
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,178
EACH OF THESE YOUNG MEN IS BEING

431
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,482
ASSISTED BY TWO DIVERS AS THEY

432
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,450
GO THROUGH THIS VERY NARROW CAVE

433
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,619
AND I'VE BEEN CURIOUS WHETHER

434
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,455
THIS IS KIND OF AN ESTABLISHED

435
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,290
RESCUE TECHNIQUE OR SOUNDS LIKE

436
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,127
AD HOC RESCUE MISSION THE

437
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,060
RESCUERS CAME UP WITH.

438
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,230
>> I BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE AN AD

439
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,696
HOC TECHNIQUE.

440
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,598
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD SET

441
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:17,769
A PRECEDENT.

442
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,637
ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED

443
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:20,305
BEFORE THEY WOULD NEED A

444
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:20,605
TECHNIQUE.

445
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,273
>> WHAT ARE THE MAIN CONCERNS

446
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:24,276
AND ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

447
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,613
DEAL WITH TO GET THROUGH IT

448
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,080
SAFELY?

449
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:32,184
>> Caller: AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

450
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,653
THE CONDITIONS ARE VERY

451
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:34,920
DIFFICULT.

452
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,554
THEY'RE STRONG CURRENTS, LIMITED

453
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,688
VISIBILITY, AS WELL AS KIDS WHO

454
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,890
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DIVE SO THAT

455
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,424
WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

456
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,359
CONCERNS IS EVEN IN GREAT

457
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,059
CONDITIONS THESE CHILDREN DON'T

458
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,795
KNOW HOW TO DIVE AND SOME OF

459
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,764
THEM DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM AND

460
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,932
YOU'RE TAKING THEM DEEP INTO

461
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:53,071
THESE CONDITIONS THAT WOULD BE

462
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,705
DIFFICULT FOR A KIND OF DIVERER

463
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,305
THAT HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL THE

464
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:54,706
PROPER TRAINING.

465
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:55,541
>>> I SUSPECT THE ANSWER IS

466
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,075
GOING TO BE BOTH, BUT HOW MUCH

467
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,309
WOULD YOU BE CONCERND THEY

468
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,745
CAN'T SWIM THERE AND HOW MUCH

469
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,414
WOULD YOU BE CONCERNED THEY'RE

470
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,949
PUTTING A REGULATOR OVER THEIR

471
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,116
FACE, DIVING, ANY OF THAT?

472
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,784
>> I THINK BOTH.

473
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,753
THERE IS JUST NOTHING EASY ABOUT

474
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,253
THIS AT ALL.

475
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,621
WITH PLENTY OF TIME I THINK IT

476
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:12,124
WOULD BE A GOOD BIT EASIER TO DO

477
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,492
BUT STILL THE CONDITIONS ARE

478
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,760
JUST DIFFICULT AND THE KIDS JUST

479
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,895
HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER.

480
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,764
>> LOTS OF FOLKS MAYBE WOULD

481
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,600
HAVE DONE A PLEASURE DIVE OFF A

482
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,402
BOAT IN HAWAII, OR CANCUN OR

483
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,771
SOMETHING, BUT FEW OF US HAVE

484
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,607
BEEN THROUGH A NARROW CAVE DIVE

485
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,141
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

486
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:37,783
EXPLAIN FOR EVEN THOSE OF US WHO

487
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,318
MAYBE HAVE SCUBA DOVE, WHAT THE

488
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,086
PARTICULAR CHALLENGES ARE?

489
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,121
>> MOST DIVERS ARE CALLED

490
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:43,521
OPEN-WATER DIVERS.

491
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,523
THEY CAN MAKE A DIRECT DESCENT

492
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,825
TO THE SURFACE AT ANY TIME.

493
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,126
FOR THE CAVE CONDITIONS YOU

494
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:48,693
CAN'T NECESSARILY COME UP.

495
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:52,164
YOU CAN'T RAISE YOUR HEAD UP AND

496
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:52,497
START OVER.

497
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,967
YOU'RE IN THE -- YOU'RE IN THE

498
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:59,771
CAVE UNTIL YOU'RE RUBBING YOUR

499
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:00,972
STOMACH AND BUMPING WHATEVER

500
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:01,440
ELSE.

501
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,474
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE KIDS

502
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,811
CAN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TANKS ON

503
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,111
THEIR BACK.

504
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:13,352
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TANKS OFF,

505
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:13,919
PUSHING THEM AHEAD, OR THEIR

506
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,486
RESCUERS ARE DOING THAT FOR

507
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:14,720
THEM.

508
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,420
>> ONE OF THE DIVERS IS CARRYING

509
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,721
THE TANK.

510
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,421
>> RIGHT AND THAT JUST SOUNDS

511
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,422
DIFFICULT BECAUSE EVERYTHING

512
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,490
JUST HAS TO GO PERFECTLY RIGHT

513
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,492
FOR THESE KIDS TO COME OUT SAFE

514
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,293
IF ARE THIS.

515
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,095
>> LUCKILY WE'RE ALREADY 4 FOR

516
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,198
4, SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS, BUT WE

517
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,299
UNDERSTAND THERE COULD BE RAIN

518
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:27,733
TODAY.

519
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,935
HOW MUCH COULD RAIN BE A FACTOR?

520
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,104
IT COULD INCREASE THE RAIN

521
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:34,505
LEVEL, BUT IN TERMS OF

522
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,640
VISIBILITY, IS RAIN A CONCERN?

523
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,007
>> IT IS.

524
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,509
IN ADDITION TO BEING MORE WATER

525
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,911
THERE, THERE IS GOING TO BE

526
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:40,279
CURRENT.

527
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,580
IT'S ALMOST LIKE DIVING IN A

528
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,315
CONVEYOR BELT WHERE YOU'RE --

529
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,783
WHERE THE FLOW IS CONSTANTLY

530
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,151
MOVING AT YOU AND YOU HAVE TO

531
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,152
CONTEND WITH FIGHTING THIS FLOW

532
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:52,224
OR THIS CURRENT TO GET THROUGH

533
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:52,424
IT.

534
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,892
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN AND EXTRA

535
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,561
RAIN AND FLOW WILL STIR THE

536
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:56,928
VISIBILITY UP.

537
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,163
IF THEY HAVE ANY VISIBILITY AT

538
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,364
ALL IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

539
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,266
BE BETTER FOR ANY STORM RAIN

540
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:01,900
COMING IN.

541
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,135
>> ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR NOVICE

542
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,604
DIVERS IS THEY JUST GET NERVOUS

543
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,740
UNDER WATER, THEY BREATHE MORE

544
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,108
HEAVILY AND GO THROUGH THEIR

545
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:10,741
OXYGEN TANK MORE QUICKLY.

546
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,144
WE KNOW THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT

547
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:17,281
HOW MUCH OXYGEN THEY CAN GET IN

548
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:17,949
THIS VERY LONG RUN.

549
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:20,018
THEY'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

550
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,653
GETTING THE TANKS IN THERE.

551
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,657
WOULD THIS BE A BIG CONCERN FOR

552
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,759
YOU HOW THESE INEXPERIENCED

553
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,194
DIVERS COULD CHEW THROUGH THEIR

554
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,295
TANKS?

555
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:30,695
>> ABSOLUTELY.

556
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:34,333
AN EXPERIENCED DIVER HAS A

557
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,401
PRETTY GOOD IDEA HOW MUCH OXYGEN

558
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,972
AND HOW LONG HIS AIR WILL LAST.

559
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,908
THESE KIDS YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

560
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,143
FAST THE AIR WILL LAST AND HOW

561
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,545
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM.

562
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,746
IT'S A DIFFICULT SCENARIO AND

563
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
IT'S A LONG WAY BACK FROM THE

564
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,048
SURFACE.

565
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,184
A NORMAL DIVER THEY CAN RAISE

566
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,952
THEIR HEAD, TAKE THEIR REGULATOR

567
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,787
OUT OF THEIR MOUTH AND CALM

568
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:55,987
DOWN.

569
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:56,888
THIS ISN'T A POSSIBILITY FOR

570
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,421
THESE KIDS RIGHT NOW.

571
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:59,925
>> AND WHAT'S THE TALK YOU GIVE

572
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,360
TO SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN UNDER

573
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,962
WATER BEFORE AND IS DOING IT FOR

574
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,565
FIRST TIME AND YOU'RE TRYING TO

575
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,434
GIVE THEM BOTH ADVICE AND

576
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:09,801
CONFIDENCE.

577
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,536
I'M SURE YOU'VE GIVEN THAT TALK.

578
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,704
WHT IS THAT TALK?

579
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,073
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE OF

580
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,408
SCUBA DIVING IS TO NEVER HOLD

581
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,775
YOUR BREATH AND I TELL PEOPLE

582
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,510
HOWEVER OLD YOU ARE, IF YOU'RE

583
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,013
30 YEARS OLD TO TEN YEARS OLD,

584
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,681
YOU HAVE 15 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

585
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:25,083
THAT SAYS I CAN'T BREATHE UNDER

586
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,751
WATER AND NOW YOU'VE MET ME FOR

587
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,621
A DAY, A WEEK, A MONTH AND I'M

588
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,690
SAYING AS SOON AS YOU PUT YOUR

589
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,557
HEAD UNDER WATER, THE MOST

590
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,526
DANGEROUS THING YOU CAN DO IS

591
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,594
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

592
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,463
THE BIGGEST PART OF SCUBA DIVING

593
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,864
THAT INJURIES PEOPLE IS PANIC.

594
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,900
AS LONG AS YOU STAY CALM UNDER

595
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,236
WATER YOU CAN USUALLY SORT

596
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,803
THROUGH MOST PROBLEMS.

597
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,973
IF YOU PANIC YOU NO LONGER THINK

598
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,408
RATIONALLY AND THAT'S GOING TO

599
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,308
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

600
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,011
>> THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THE

601
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,714
OXYGEN CHAMBER IS DOWN TO 15%,

602
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:59,718
THE NORMAL AIR IS 21%, DOCTORS

603
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,018
SAY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

604
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:06,992
COMPROMISE D IS THINKING.

605
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,427
THAT SAID, THEY'RE 4 FOR 4.

606
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,762
AS YOU HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT

607
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:11,563
THIS AND HEARING ABOUT THIS,

608
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,499
WHAT HAS STRUCK YOU ABOUT THE

609
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,835
MISSION, ABOUT THE CHALLENGE AND

610
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,769
THE WAY THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

611
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,002
THIS?

612
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,671
>> I THINK THEY'RE SETTING NEW

613
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:20,204
GROUND BY DOING THIS.

614
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:22,307
I THINK THEY'RE IN A BIT OF A

615
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,209
RACE AGAINST TIME, OR AT LEAST A

616
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,444
RACE AGAINST THE WEATHER, BUT

617
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:28,914
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD IN MY

618
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,014
OPINION, THEY HAVE GOT FOUR OUT,

619
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,350
NOW THEY NEED TO HURRY AND GET

620
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,817
THE REST OUT.

621
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,454
I'VE ALSO SEEN THEY TOOK THE

622
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,289
NIGHT OFF TO REFILL AIR TANKS

623
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,289
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW GOOD

624
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,025
THEIR SUPPORT IS THEY DO HAVE TO

625
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,293
TAKE THE TIME OFF, IF THEY CAN'T

626
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:45,163
IMMEDIATELY TURN OVER TANKS AND

627
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,666
KEEP GOING WITH THIS.

628
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,000
>> OKAY.

629
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,837

THOSE RESCUERS DIVERS REMOVED

FOUR PEOPLE SUCCESSFULLY FROM

648
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,076
THE CAVE.

649
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,077
THE MISSION WAS PUT ON HOLD

650
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,180
THOUGH FOR THE LAST HALF A DAY

651
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,183
BECAUSE OF LOW OXYGEN LEVELS IN

652
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,552
THE DIVERS' TANKS, OR NOT ENOUGH

653
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,621
OXYGEN TANKS ALONG THE CAVE

00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:56,821
ROUTE.

655
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,490
THE TEAM OF DIVERS HAS TO GO

656
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,792
THROUGH MILES OF TUNNELS JUST TO

657
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,793
REACH THE BOYS.

THROUGH A SERIES OF DARK AND

671
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:26,951
FLOODED TUNNELS.

672
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,953
>> YOU CAN'T MAKE A HORROR MOVIE

673
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:30,221
THAT WOULD COMPARE AND I'VE BEEN

674
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:31,756
INVOLVED IN CAVE RESCUE FOR

675
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,727
30 YEARS AND I CANNOT EVEN THINK

676
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,195
OF ONE THAT WAS THIS

677
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:37,528

RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL IN

FIRST PHASE WAS SUCCESSFUL.

THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

689
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:53,811
SHOW IT WORKS.

690
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:55,080
IT'S STILL DANGEROUS, BUT MUCH

691
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,550
BETTER ODDS FOR THE REMAININGúKF

692
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,350
THOSE INITIAL ONES.

693

>> BEFORE THEY ATTEMPT ANOTHER

694

REFILL THEIR OXYGEN TANKS AND

696
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,493
REPLENISH THE SUPPLIES ALONG THE

CHIEF METEOROLOGIST AT WFOR, AND

CRAIG, MIAMI IS A PLACE THAT

710
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,984
KNOWS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF FLASH

711
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,251
FLOODING.

712
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,886
WE SEE THE SITUATION NOW IN

713
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,721
THAILAND WHERE HEAVY RAIN COULD

714
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,123
RAPIDLY CHANGE THE CONDITIONS

715
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:38,356
THERE.

716
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,858
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT

717
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,493
LOOKS LIKE WHEN THESE HEAVY

718
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,961
RAINS AND FLASH FLOODS HIT?

719
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,131
>> Caller: THE SITUATION IS

720
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,299
SIMILAR IN THE ASPECT THAT

721
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,400
FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY SOUTH

722
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,901
FLORIDA, HAS A RAINY SEASON.

723
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:53,171
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND

724
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,006
THE SOUTHWEST U.S. IS CALLED A

725
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,741
MONSOON SEASON WHERE THE SUMMER

726
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,642
RAINS COME IN.

727
00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:59,644
WE SEE THAT TYPICALLY COLORADO

728
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:05,483
THROUGH ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO,

729
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,218
ESPECIALLY THE LOWER ATTITUDE,

730
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,386
SUCH AS THAILAND WHERE THEY GET

731
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,622
A RAINY SEASON AND A DRY SEASON

732
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:11,756
AND THEIR RAINY SEASON,

733
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,092
SIMILARLY LASTS ALMOST AS LONG

734
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,895
AS MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN U.S.'S

735
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,062
RAINY SEASON, TYPICALLY FROM MAY

736
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:19,564
OR JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER AND

737
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,799
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S

738
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,734
GOING TO RAIN EVERY SINGLE DAY,

739
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,702
BUT THE CHANCES OF IT RAINING ON

740
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,737
A DAY ARE GREATER THAN IT NOT

741
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:27,405
RAINING ON A DAY.

742
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,506
WHEN THEY HAVE THESE WINDOWS

743
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,674
LIKE NOW IN THAILAND THEY'VE GOT

744
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,609
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND THE

745
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,812
INTERESTING THING ABOUT THIS IS

746
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:38,082
I'M SURE YOU'VE DISCUSSED IT, AS

747
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:41,252
WE'VE BEEN GOING HERE, IS WATER

748
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,821
LEVELS, THESE CAVES WHICH WERE

749
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,857
FORMED BY WATER FLOWING, THE

750
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,959
WATER IS GOING TO COME UP AND 2

751
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,495
1/2 MILES IN OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY

752
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,531
LONG JOURNEY, EVEN IN DRY

753
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:53,831
CONDITIONS.

754
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:54,465
IT'S ESPECIALLY CRITICAL HERE.

755
00:28:54,465 --> 00:28:55,633
I THINK THEY'RE WISE IN NOT

756
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,502
WAITING UNTIL THE END OF RAINY

757
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,604
SEASON BECAUSE THAT WAS SUCH A

758
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,538
RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME INTO

759
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:00,805
OCTOBER.

760
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:01,606
>> AND WE'RE TOWARD THE

761
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,308
BEGINNING OF THE RAINY SEASON A

762
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:07,645
FEW WEEKS IN ANY WAY, AND IS IT

763
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:12,817
KIND OF LIKE A CURVE, IN OTHER

764
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,686
WORDS WOULD IT GET A BIT WORSE

765
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,454
OR NOT NECESSARILY?

766
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,122
>> SO IT KIND OF DEPENDS.

767
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,690
TYPICALLY IN RAINY SEASON, THE

768
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,259
BEGINNING OF RAINY SEASON IT'S A

769
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,394
LITTLE BIT WETTER SIMPLY BECAUSE

770
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,430
THE ATMOSPHERE IS STILL COOLER

771
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,931
HIGHER UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE,

772
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,800
WHICH RESULTS IN WHAT WE CALL

773
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,001
INSTABILITY,O USUALLY THE

774
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,736
BEGINNING OR FIRST COUPLE WEEKS

775
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,372
OR MONTHS OF RAINY SEASON ARE

776
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:34,905
MORE PROLIFIC.

777
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:36,507
RAIN PRODUCTION IS QUITE A BIT

778
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:37,308
HIGHER AND THE ATMOSPHERE WARMS

779
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,344
AND BECOMES A LITTLE BIT MORE

780
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:39,577
STABLE.

781
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,045
IT TAPERS OFF A BIT.

782
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,413
YOU STILL GET THE OCCASIONAL

783
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,549
SHOWERS IN THE RAINY SEASON OR

784
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,017
MONSOONAL PATTERN BUT YOU DON'T

785
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,418
HAVE THE REALLY HEAVY DOWNPOURS.

786
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,954
THAT'S NOT TRUE IN THE SOUTHWEST

787
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,623
U.S. WHERE THE MONSOON SEASON,

788
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,723
WHICH COMES ON STRONG THERE,

789
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:54,392
MOISTURE FROM THE GULF MAKES IT

790
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,094
UP THROUGH THE RIO GRANDE AND

791
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,595
SPECIFIC MOISTURE COMES IN AND

792
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,565
IS DRAWN IN FROM THE WARMTH OF

793
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,333
THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND YOU GET

794
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,033
THESE VERY HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS

795
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,136
AND FLASH FLOODING THERE AND OF

796
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,306
COURSE IN THE SOUTHWEST U.S.,

797
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,842
YOU HAVE VALLEYS, LITTLE VALLEYS

798
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,443
OR WATERS OF WATER WILL

799
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,278
LITERALLY TEAR DOWN THROUGH A

800
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:20,884
VALLEY AND HIGH HIKE ER --

801
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,253
HIKERS AND

802
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,855
CAMPERS HAVE TO BE AWARE OF

803
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:24,155
THAT.

804
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,790
>> IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD,

805
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,625
ARE THERE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

806
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,527
AREAS DURING THE PART OF THE

807
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,364
CALENDAR, AND WHAT WAS OR WASN'T

808
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,668
DONE IN THIS CASE IN THAILAND?

809
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:38,235
>> Caller: MOST MODERN

810
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:39,137
CIVILIZATIONS AND COUNTRIES HAVE

811
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,838
SOME TYPE OF WARNIN SYSTEM AND

812
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,341
I THINK IT'S A TWO-SIDED

813
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,877
QUESTION BECAUSE ONE IS THAT THE

814
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,511
WARNINGS GO OUT, BUT DO PEOPLE

815
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:53,251
GET THE WARNING OR HEED THE

816
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:53,484
WARNING?

817
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,987
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CONSIDER

818
00:30:55,987 --> 00:31:05,063
IF I WAS GOING CAVING IF IT

819
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,397
RAINING -- OR SPELUNKING, IN

820
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,200
EVEN THINKING THE CAVE WOULD BE

821
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,401
CUT OFF OR FILLED WITH WATER.

822
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,203
>> WHAT ARE ELSE ARE YOU

823
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,537
THINKING ABOUT THE WEATHER

824
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,273
CONDITIONS, THE CONDITIONS THE

825
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,342
DIVERS AND KIDS ARE IN FROM A

826
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:17,842
WEATHER PERSPECTIVE?

827
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:18,810
>> Reporter: I THINK THE CONCERN

828
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,511
WOULD BE IF THE RAINS COME IT

829
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,379
AGAIN AND WHEN THEY COME AGAIN

830
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,780
IS THERE IS GOING TO BE CURRENT

831
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,383
AND OF COURSE ANY TIME ANYBODY

832
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,885
THAT DOES ANY SCUBA DIVING KNOWS

833
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,853
HOW JUST -- HOW INCREDIBLY

834
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,923
STRONG EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF

835
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,056
CURRENT CAN BE, QUICKLY EXHAUSTS

836
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:38,129
YOU, SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A

837
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,029
CONSIDERATION GOING THROUGH THE

838
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,199
CAVE AND IT'S JUST A WAKE-UP

839
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,301
CALL IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO IS

840
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,468
AN AVID OUT DOORS MAN, ANYWHERE

841
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:45,970
IN THE COUNTRY OF THE WORLD AND

842
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,871
YOU'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE

843
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,740
THERE ARE HEAVY RAINS AND THINGS

844
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,274
LIKE THAT, THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE

845
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,008
TO BE AWARE OF.

846
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,144
I'VE HEARD OF CASES WHERE KIDS

847
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,545
GO UP STORM DRAINS RATHER LARGE

848
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:55,680
STORM DRAINS AND THEN A FLASH

849
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,915
FLOOD OR A WALL OF WATER WILL

850
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:58,582
COME THROUGH AND UNFORTUNATELY

851
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,718
IN THAT CASE THERE IS A LOSS OF

852
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:00,951
LIFE.

853
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:01,619

THEY'VE GOT THE PERFECT STORM

932
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,703
FOR EVERYTHING YOU COULD THROW

933
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,904
AT THIS.

934
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,572
JUST BEING IN AN OVERHEAD IS

935
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,708
INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL FOR MOST

936
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,076
PEOPLE IN A WATER-FILLED

937
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:52,376
ENVIRONMENT.

938
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,445
THE WATER IN ITSELF IS A SERIOUS

939
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,347
THREAT FOR THESE -- IN THIS

940
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,448
PARTICULAR INSTANCE BECAUSE THEY

941
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,051
DON'T SWIM, WHICH MEANS THEY

942
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,154
HAVEN'T HAD MUCH TIME IN BEING

943
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,656
SUBMERGED IN THE WATER.

944
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:10,294
THE HIGH FLOW OF FLOODWATERS,

945
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,662
THE ZERO VISIBILITY, THE NOT

946
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,997
BEING ON CUBA.

947
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,265
THERE IS JUST EVERYTHING YOU

948
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,232
COULD POSSIBLY THROW AT THESE

949
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:15,899
KIDS IS HERE.

950
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:20,571
>> SO WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT A TEAM

951
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,506
OF SOME 90 DIVERS THAT ARE

952
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,077
ASSISTING IN THIS EFFORT AND A

953
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,779
LOT OF THEM NOT BEING THAI

954
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:29,647
DIVERS, WHAT LAYER OF COMPLEXITY

955
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,049
DOES THAT AD WHEN YOU HAVE

956
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,452
SOMETHING AS BASIC AS FOR

957
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:41,325
INSTANCE COMMUNICATIONS POSSIBLY

958
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,893
BEING A FACTOR HERE?

959
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,627
>> Caller: ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS

960
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,863
IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IF THEY

961
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,065
DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY THAT SPEAKS

962
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:48,999
WHATEVER LANGUAGE PER THE

963
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,201
INTERNATIONAL TEAM, BUT THEN

964
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,702
COMMUNICATION IN THE WATER IS

965
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:52,403
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

966
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:53,770
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE

967
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,705
TEACH IN CAVE DIVING IS THERE IS

968
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,075
NO TALKING SO EVERYTHING HAS TO

969
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,511
BE DONE USUALLY BY HAND SIGNALS

970
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,347
BUT IN 0 VISIBILITY, IT HAS TO

971
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,814
BE TOUCH CONTACT.

972
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:05,783
COMMUNICATIONS IS A REALLY

973
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,816
STRESSFUL FACTOR.

974
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:09,353
>> AND YOU KNOW, THE NOTION THAT

975
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,889
KEEPING CALM IS SUCH A CRITICAL

976
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,357
ELEMENT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

977
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,725
SWIMMING, WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT

978
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,660
BEING IN THAT KIND OF

979
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,896
ENVIRONMENT, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

980
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,997
USING SCUBA APPARATUS, CAN YOU

981
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,499
GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW CRITICAL

982
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:25,503
THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

983
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,139
IN FACT A SAFE PASSAGE FOR THESE

984
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,241
BOYS AS THEY HEAD OUT.

985
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,978
THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A SENSE

986
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,945
OF CALM.

987
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,680
>> Caller: THAT'S ONE OF THE

988
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,450
BIGGEST ISSUES WITH A LOT OF

989
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,486
DIVERS IN CAVE TRAINING IS BEING

990
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,253
ABLE TO HANDLE STRESSFUL

991
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:44,255
SITUATIONS, EVEN THOUGH THEY

992
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,757
KNOW IT'S A DRILL AND THESE

993
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,760
KIDS, IT'S NOT A DRILL, THAT

994
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,697
HESE STRESSES MAY RISE E

995
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,300
AND ADVANTAGE TURNS TO PANIC,

996
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,269
WHICH IS USUALLY FATAL.

997
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,907
SO THAT'S WHY IN CAVE DIVING YOU

998
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:08,178
CAN'T EVEN START YOUR VERY FIRST

999
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,446
INJURY-LEVEL CAVERN UNTIL YOU'RE

1000
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:11,682
18 YEARS OF AGE.

1001
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:15,119
>> BECAUSE THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT

1002
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,053
OF STRESS IT CAN INVOLVE.

1003
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:17,855
WE SAW HEAVY RAINFALL COMING

1004
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,989
DOWN SHORTLY AFTER THE CREWS

1005
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:19,757
WENT ON BREAK.

1006
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,425
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO

1007
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,027
AFFECT THE CONDITIONS AND GIVE

1008
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,763
US A SENSE IF YOU CAN, ED, I

1009
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,431
KNOW YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT THERE.

1010
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,832
WHAT IS THAT CAVE ENVIRONMENT

1011
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:29,834
LIKE WHERE YOU ARE TALKIN ABOUT

1012
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,470
AN AREA THERE THAT HAS BEEN

1013
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,072
FLOODED WITH WATER AND

1014
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:36,874
VISIBILITY IS OBVIOUSLY AN

1015
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,207
ISSUE?

1016
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:41,212
>> Caller: AND ON A SYSTEM LIKE

1017
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,548
THAT, IT'S -- A LOT OF TIMES

1018
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,851
IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN IT'S WET

1019
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,286
JUST TO NAVIGATE IN THE DRY CAVE

1020
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,389
PORTIONS AND THEN NOW YOU'VE GOT

1021
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:55,593
A COMPLETELY WATER-FILLED CAVE

1022
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:59,764
SO YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT TO TOUCH,

1023
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,167
GRAB, WALK IN SOME CASES,

1024
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,568
BECAUSE OF THE ZERO-VISIBILITY

1025
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,503
WATERS.

1026
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,637
SO IT'S A DAUNTING TASK FOR

1027
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,004
THESE KIDS AND JUST THE FACT

1028
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,340
THEY'VE GOTTEN SO MANY OF THEM

1029
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,879
OUT SO FAR IS NOTHING SHORT OF A

1030
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:15,612
MIRACLE AGAINST ALL ODDS.

1031
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,748
>> AND TIME IS SOMETHING THAT IS

1032
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,518
A DIFFICULT THING FOR PEOPLE TO

1033
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,653
UNDERSTAND WHY IT TAKES SO LONG

1034
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,322
TO GET THE PROPER SORT OF

1035
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:29,727
PREPARATION IN PLACE AHEAD OF

WITH YOUR PEOPLE AND A LOT OF

1040
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:43,107
FOLKS WONDER WHERE DOES IT TAKE

1041
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,042
SO LONG TO PREPARE FOR THAT?

1042
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,413
>> Caller: A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

1043
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,215
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IT'S NOT

1044
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:55,419
JUST A TUBE, A TUNNEL TO GO

1045
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,321
THROUGH, IT'S FALLING DOWN

1046
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:57,988
BOLDERS, CLIFFS, RESTRICTIONS --

1047
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,624
BOULDERS, CLIFFS, THERE IS

1048
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,426
PROBABLY LOOSE ROCKS, HAZARDS

1049
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,295
BEYOND HAZARDS AND WHEN YOU'RE

1050
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,963
IN ZERO VISIBILITY YOU HAVE TO

1051
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,430
FOLLOW THAT LINE.

1052
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,299
IF YOU LET GO OF THAT LINE YOU

1053
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,402
MAY NEVER GO OUT AND IF YOU'RE

1054
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,170
IN A VERY, VERY SMALL

1055
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,304
RESTRICTION, IT'S STRESSFUL BUT

1056
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:15,272
IT'S NOT LIFE-THREATENING.

1057
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,640
BUT YOU GET INTO A BIGGER

1058
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,508
PORTION, THAT LINE MAY BE INCHES

1059
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:21,045
FROM YOU AND YOU'LL -- IT MAY AS

1060
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,613
WELL BE A MILE AWAY.

1061
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,448
SO THAT LINE IS YOUR LIFE LINE.

1062
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,584
>> AND IN SOME OF THESE IMAGES

1063
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:29,253
THAT WE'RE SEEING, YOU GET A

1064
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,388
SENSE OF JUST HOW CONFINED A

1065
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,589
SPACE IS AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE

1066
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,592
GOING TO NEED THESE AIR TANKS.

1067
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:36,226
HOW DOES THAT PHYSICALLY WORK,

1068
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,329
TRYING TO GET THROUGH SOME OF

1069
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,563
THESE NARROW CREVICES WHEN

1070
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,632
YOU'VE -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE

1071
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,936
RELYING ON THESE AIR THANKS TO

1072
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,705
ALLOW YOU TO BREATHE AND YOU'VE

1073
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,973
GOT THESE BOYS AS YOU'VE POINTED

1075
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:54,311
THE WATER.

1076
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:54,945
WHAT IS THAT LIKE?

1077
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,616
>> Caller: THAT IS -- CAVE

1078
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,183
DIVING IS AN EXTREME SPORT.

1079
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:02,119
IT HAS A LOT OF INHERENT RISKS,

1080
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,892
BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO WHAT WE

1081
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,494
CALL GEAR MANIPULATION, OR

1082
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,562
DOUBLE BOTTLE-UP RESTRICTIONS,

1083
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,429
NORMALLY DIVERS HAVE TWO TANKS,

1084
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,967
NOT ONE.

1085
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,369
WHEN YOU GET TO A GEAR

1086
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:20,003
RESTRICTION, THAT'S EXPERIENCED

1087
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,805
CAVE DIVING.

1088
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,106
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1089
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:25,809
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHEN

1090
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:26,944
YOU SAY MANIPULATION?

1091
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,046
>> THAT MEANS REMOVAL OF GEAR.

1092
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,416
MOST CAVE DIVERS ARE NEVER

1093
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,017
TAUGHT TO REMOVE THEIR GEAR.

1094
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:40,624
SO TO DO THESE KIND OF

1095
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,124
RESTRICTIONS, GEAR-OFF

1096
00:42:41,124 --> 00:42:42,026
RESTRICTIONS, THAT'S AN

1097
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,093
ADVANCED, ADVANCED FORM OF CAVE

1098
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:45,663
DIVING AND I DON'T LET PEOPLE

1099
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,931
TAKE MY ADVANCED CAVE DIVING

1100
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,734
COURSE WHERE WE DO GEAR

1101
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,434
MANIPULATION AND BOTTLE-OFF

1102
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,303
REALLY TIGHT RESTRICTIONS UNTIL

1103
00:42:53,303 --> 00:42:55,339
THEY HAVE AT LEAST 100, MINIMUM

1104
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,006
SAFE CAVE DIVES.

1105
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,275
SO THAT'S AFTER ALL OF THEIR

1106
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:58,909
TRAINING.

1107
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,779
>> SO THE FACT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY

1108
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,846
RESORTING TO THIS TELLS YOU

1109
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,079
WHAT?

1110
00:43:03,146 --> 00:43:08,385
>> IT TELLS ME THEY HAVE NO

1111
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:08,618
CHOICE.

1112
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:10,521
SO THAT'S WHAT -- THAT'S WHY I

1113
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,856
WAS SAYING IT'S A MIRACLE

1114
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:16,226
THEY'VE GOTTEN THIS MANY OUT

1115
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:16,860
ALREADY AGAINST UNSURMOUNTABLE

1116
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,294
ODDS.

1117
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,697
>> AND AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH

1118
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,498
THESE IMAGES, IT IS JUST SO

1119
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:22,866
COMPELLING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

1120
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,702
MUST BE GOING THROUGH THE MINDS

1121
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,071
OF THE BOYS WHO HAVE BEEN

1122
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:30,174
TRAPPED THERE FOR MORE THAN TWO

1123
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:34,712
WEEKS, BUT THEN THOSE NOW

1124
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,646
ENTRUSTED WITH SAVING THEM AND

1125
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,047
THE PRESSURE THEY'RE UNDER AND

1126
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,748
WHAT THAT PHYSICALLY REQUIRES TO

1127
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:41,418
MAINTAIN A SENSE OF MENTAL FOCUS

1128
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,055
TO TRY TO GO ABOUT THIS MISSION?

1129
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,825
>> Caller: WELL, THIS WOULD

1130
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,494
BE -- THIS WOULD BE UNBELIEVABLY

1131
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,395
STRESSFUL FOR AN EXPERIENCED

1132
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:55,499
CAVE DIVER THAT'S DONE A -- AN

1133
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,434
ADVANCED TYPE OF GEAR

1134
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:58,302
MANIPULATION, OR REMOVABLE

1135
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,338
CLASS, LET ALONE SOMEBODY THAT

1136
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,774
IS NOT AN EXPERIENCED SCUBA

1137
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,342
DIVER, OR NOT SCUBA CERTIFIED AT

1138
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,779
ALL AND THESE BOYS, AS FAR AS I

1139
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,846
UNDERSTAND IT, DON'T EVEN KNOW

1140
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:10,280
HOW TO SWIM.

1141
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,750
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM

1142
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,118
YOU MOST LIKELY HAVEN'T BEEN

1143
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,154
SUBMERGED FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME

1144
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:17,521
WHATSOEVER.

1145
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:18,756
SO IT'S -- IT REALLY IS

1146
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,357
MIRACULOUS THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN

1147
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,424
THIS MANY OUT SO FAR.

1148
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:24,160
>> JUST REMARKABLE TO THINK OF

1149
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,727
THESE EFFORTS UNDERWAY.

1150
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:26,930
ED, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

1151
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,566
HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

1153
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,168
HAVE A NICE DAY.

1154
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:34,772

00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,609

THEIR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THOSE 15

1164
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:23,072
MEMBERS OF A THAI YOUTH SOCCER

1165
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:24,041
TEAM FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS

1166
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,643
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN A CAVE.

1167
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:27,778
FOUR MEMBERS WERE REMOVED ABOUT

00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,250

EIGHT-HOUR MISSION ROUND TRIP TO

00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,657
GET FOUR MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM.

1173
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,092
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND

1174
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,795
WE ARE JOINED BY A FORMER NAVY

1175
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:45,762
SEAL, JAKE, GREAT TO SEE YOU.

1176
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,397
IF YOU WERE GETTING IN THE WATER

1177
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,265
THIS MORNING WHAT WOULD BE YOUR

1178
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:49,699
BIGGEST CONCERN?

1179
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,234
>> Reporter: AT THAT POINT YOU

1180
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:52,569
REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS,

1181
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,137
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

1182
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,240
YOU'RE JUST FOCUSED ON THE TASK

1183
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,908
ORDER AT HAND.

1184
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:58,942
BASICALLY YOU'VE REHEARSED THIS.

1185
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,109
THEY'VE GOT IT DOWN TO TEN

1186
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:03,313
MINUTES ON THE FIRST RUN FROM

1187
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,581
THE REHEARSAL SO YOU'RE

1188
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:05,482
BASICALLY GOING THREW YOUR

1189
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,817
CHECKLIST OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE

1190
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,087
GOT TO DO IN THE MISSION AND

1191
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:10,721
YOU'VE PRACTICED FOR

1192
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,922
CONTINGENCIES BUT YOU'RE REALLY

1193
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,256
NOT THINKING ABOUT CONCERNS SO

1194
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:13,456
MUCH.

1195
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:14,491
IT'S MORE SO ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE

1196
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,226
GOT TO DO TO ACHIEVE THE

1197
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:16,493
MISSION.

1198
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,562
>> AND GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT

1199
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,829
THAT CHECKLIST LOOKS LIKE.

1200
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,164
>> SO FIRST THING YOU'RE GOING

1201
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,233
TO START WITH, EVERYBODY HAS

1202
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:23,533
THEIR JOB.

1203
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,935
I'M SURE THEY'VE WALKED THROUGH

1204
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,369
IT A NUMBER OF TIMES RIGHT

1205
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,271
BEFORE THEY ALL GO INTO THE CAVE

1206
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:29,573
THEY'VE PROBABLY WALKED THROUGH

1207
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,673
IT AGAIN, HEY, I'M STANDING

1208
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:31,775
HERE, THIS IS MY JOB, AND THE

1209
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:34,177
GUY IN CHARGE IS GOING TO MAKE

1210
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,113
SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS

1211
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,981
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

1212
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,082
THERE IS PROBABLY SOME

1213
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,650
MID--LEVEL LEADERS THAT ARE IN

1214
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,352
CHARGE OF THE SPACE -- MID-LEVEL

1215
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,121
LEADERS IN CHARGE OF THE SPACES,

1216
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,355
I.E., THE PLACE WHERE THE SOCCER

1217
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,191
TEAM IS GETTING OUT OF THE WATER

1218
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:48,558
AND WALKING.

1219
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:51,395
THEY PUT A BUNCH OF LAYERS OF

1220
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,195
REDUNDANCY TO MAKE SURE

1221
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,730
EVERYBODY IS CAPABLE OF DOING

1222
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,698
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND

1223
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:59,336
LIMIT TO THE RISK TO THE SOCCER

1224
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:02,939
PLAYERS AND THE RESCUE TEAM.

1225
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,642
>> DID YOU EVER PRACTICE FOR

1226
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:06,175
RESCUING NOVICE DIVERS?

1227
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:10,047
>> I NEVER TRAINED FOR IT BUT WE

1228
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:15,418
TRAIN FOR RESCUING DOWNED PILOTS

1229
00:49:15,418 --> 00:49:16,152
BEHIND ENEMY LINES.

1230
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:17,554
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME

1231
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:17,921
DEAL.

1232
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,322
MOST OF THE TIME THE PILOTS

1233
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,457
DON'T GET SHOT DOWN NEAR THE

1234
00:49:21,457 --> 00:49:22,726
LINE, THEY GET SHOT DOWN WILL BE

1235
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,360
BEHIND IT AND IT'S JUST ONE OF

1236
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,062
THOSE THINGS.

1237
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,897
THE DIFFERENCE IS THOUGH AS A

1238
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,265
FORMER NAVY SEAL AND WE'VE GOT

1239
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,900
U.S. NAVY SEALS ON THE GROUND

1240
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,268
THERE NOW, THEY'RE SOME OF THE

1241
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,837
WORLD'S BEST AT THINKING AND

1242
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:34,337
OVER COMING ADVERSITY.

1243
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:35,972
SO I DON'T CARE WHAT THE MISSION

1244
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,075
IS, THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY

1245
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:40,410
TO WIN.

1246
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:41,878
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE WORLD'S

1247
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,915
BEST CAVE RESCUE DIVER THERE IS

1248
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:46,717
AND THAI SEALS THERE.

1249
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,552
AND YOU'VE GOT ELON MUSK ON THE

1250
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:49,719
GROUND, SOME OF HIS CREW.

1251
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:51,054
YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THE SMARTEST

1252
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,257
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AND YOU

1253
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,558
DEFINITELY HAVE THE MOST CAPABLE

1254
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:55,792
PEOPLE.

1255
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,928
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE TRYING

1256
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:58,561
TO BUILD A SPACE SHUTTLE,

1257
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:01,631
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO

1258
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,031
WIN.

1259
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:03,800
>> I LOVE THE SHOUT OUT.

1260
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,801
WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE KIDS 11

1261
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:08,905
TO 16-YEAR-OLD KIDS IN NOT AT

1262
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,740
THE RIRIVE HEALTH IN THIS CAVE.

1263
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:16,546
NOT A TRAINED U.S. AIR FORCE

1264
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,749
PILOT WHO YOU POTENTIAL LOW

1265
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:20,216
POTENTIALLY RESCUING.

1266
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:21,351
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEIR

1267
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,152
SKILL SET IS.

1268
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,287
>> IS IT HELPS THEY'RE KIDS

1269
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,921
BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT SMALLER.

1270
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:31,528
AT THIS POINT, THEY'VE MADE AN

1271
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,763
ASSESSMENT OF EVERY PERSON'S

1272
00:50:33,763 --> 00:50:36,232
KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKE UP.

1273
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,168
THEY'RE PROBABLY GIVEN SOME

1274
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,570
SEDATIVES BEFORE THEY PULL THEM

1275
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,606
THROUGH, THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN THE

1276
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:44,741
NERVOUS KID FIRST TO GET THEM

1277
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,544
OUT OF THE SITUATION AND CALM

1278
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:52,315
EVERYBODY ELSE DOWN, AND THE

1279
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,651
YOUNG AND LITTLE, RULES IT OUT,

1280
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,954
BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING ALONG

1281
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,757
AND PUSHING THEM DOWN THE ROAD.

1282
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:01,625
IT'S A GODSEND THEY'RE LITTLE

1283
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,192
PEOPLE.

1284
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,994
>> IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN

1285
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,228
THINKING ABOUT, WOULD YOU BRING

1286
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,931
THE STRONGEST KIDS FIRST TO MAKE

1287
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,366
SURE THE TECHNIQUE WORKS, THE

1288
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:10,167
WEAKEST KIDS BECAUSE YOU'RE

1289
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,835
WORRIED ABOUT HOW LONG THEY CAN

1290
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:15,605
BE IN THE CAVE IN?

1291
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,174
HOW WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO BRING

1292
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:17,607
THEM OUT?

1293
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,209
>> THEY PROBABLY TOOK THE TWO

1294
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,577
STRONG KIDS IN THAT FIRST WAVE.

1295
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,179
THEY BELIEVE THEY WERE DOING

1296
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,780
THEM IN TWOS AND ONCE THEY GOT

1297
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,647
THOSE FIRST TWO THROUGH, THEY

1298
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:26,917
WENT TO THE NEXT TWO THAT WERE

1299
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,384
PROBABLY THE WEAKEST.

1300
00:51:28,384 --> 00:51:35,025
THE THING YOU'VE GOT TO

1301
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,561
UNDERSTAND THOUGH IS THEY DIDN'T

1302
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,127
KNOW THE OUTCOME.

1303
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,996
THEY PROBABLY PASSED THEM OUT TO

1304
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:40,329
SOMEBODY ELSE.

1305
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,064
THEY HAD AN ORDER THAT

1306
00:51:41,064 --> 00:51:42,365
DETERMINED THERE WAS A DOCTOR

1307
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,135
AND TWO NAVY SEALS, YOU KNOW ONE

1308
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,204
THING WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT IS

1309
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:47,971
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING OF

1310
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:48,504
PEOPLE.

1311
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:50,073
YOU'VE GOTTEN WHO TO SHOOT IN A

1312
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,441
BAD SITUATION, SO THEY KNEW WHO

1313
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,275
WAS GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM,

1314
00:51:53,275 --> 00:51:54,244
KIDS, AND THEY PROBABLY PLAN

1315
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,179
TODAY THAT WAY SO THEY COULD GET

1316
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,282
THEM OUT RIGHT BEHIND THE TWO

1317
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,683
SUCCESSFUL KIDS.

1318
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,786
>> WE'VE BELIEVED -- AND I MEAN

1319
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,721
EVERYONE HAS SAID THIS IS AN

1320
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:08,325
INCREDIBLE MISSION AND YOU SEE

1321
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,061
THEM SUCCEED SO WELL YESTERDAY

1322
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:11,761
AND QUICKER THAN THEY

1323
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:12,329
ANTICIPATED.

1324
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,231
DOES THIS STILL STRIKE YOU AS AN

1325
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,098
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS MISSION

1326
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,733
WHEN YOU SEE THOSE FOUR YOUNG

1327
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,535
PEOPLE COME OUT?

1328
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,637
I THINK THIS MAY BE DOABLE?

1329
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,105
>> BROOK, LET'S BE HONEST.

1330
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,173
WE CAN'T COUNT OUR CHICKENS

1331
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,174
BEFORE THEY HATCH, RIGHT?

1332
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:29,379
I MEAN WE'VE ALREADY LOST ONE

1333
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,814
VERY EXPERIENCED THAI NAVY SEAL.

1334
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,916
SO TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO

1335
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,819
GET THESE NEXT EIGHT PEOPLE OUT

1336
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,386
UNSCATHED, WITHOUT ANY MORE

1337
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,022
FATALITIES, I'M GOING TO BE

1338
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,057
HONEST WITH YOU, MAN.

1339
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:41,724
IT'S A STRETCH.

1340
00:52:41,724 --> 00:52:44,995
IT'S STILL JUST AS DANGEROUS AS

1341
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:45,761
CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.

1342
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:49,065
IT MAY BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN

1343
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:49,899
CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.

1344
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:52,968
AT LEAST YOU'RE JUST WORRIED

1345
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,071
ABOUT FALLING.

1346
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,072
THERE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

1347
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,642
BREATHING, FALLING, GETTING

1348
00:52:58,642 --> 00:52:59,943
LOST, A WHOLE BUNCH OF FACTORS.

1349
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,344
>> I'M CURIOUS HOW MUCH

1350
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,747
EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE DEALING IN

1351
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,882
THESE NARROW CAVE SITUATIONS AND

1352
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,317
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

1353
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:07,984
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

1354
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,087
A COUPLE YEARS BACK, I WAS DOWN

1355
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,456
IN MEXICO, THOSE UNDER WATER

1356
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,458
CAVERNS, AND I WAS FREE DIVING A

1357
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,828
HOLE BASICALLY IN A CAVE WHERE I

1358
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,228
WAS STAYING.

1359
00:53:19,228 --> 00:53:20,696
I WAS DOWN ABOUT 20 FEET WITH NO

1360
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:25,101
AIR AND IT GOT REAL TIGHT AND I

1361
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:26,836
HAD TO TURN AROUND AND WE ALL

1362
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,137
HAVE THIS LITTLE SPIDEY SENSE

1363
00:53:28,137 --> 00:53:30,473
WHEN YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT

1364
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,009
CAN GET YOU KILLED AND MY SPIDEY

1365
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,011
SENSE WENT TO 100 AND I MANAGED

1366
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,816
TO OUT OF THE LITTLE TIGHT SPACE

1367
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,484
BUT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH BEING

1368
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,985
UNDERGROUND IN TIGHT SPACES AND

1369
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:43,719
IT'S NEVER A NICE THING.

1370
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:47,223
>> HOW MUCH DOES THE RAIN

1371
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,358
CONCERN YOU IN THAT CONTEXT?

1372
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,760
>> I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST WITH

1373
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,562
YOU, THAT'S WHAT GOT THEM IN

1374
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,663
TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE, SO

1375
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,400
AT THIS POINT, IT'S JUST ONE OF

1376
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,569
THE HAZARDS OF THE JOB.

1377
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,937
>> THANK YOU, JAKE, REALLY

1378
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,472
INSIGHTFUL STUFF FROM A FORMER

1379
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,173

HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.

1383
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,314
