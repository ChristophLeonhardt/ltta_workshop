1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,900
In my  38 years of reporting

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,380
I’ve covered multiple presidential administrations

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,240
and plenty of DC intrigue,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,580
but still, nothing compares to my unscheduled stay

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,900
in a foreign prison.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,220
It was 1987

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,160
and I was in Iran as part of a press group

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,820
invited to cover the war with Iraq.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,580
We visited the war front during an artillery exchange

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,380
and spent a night in a bunker filled with maps

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,040
before returning to Tehran.

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,760
As we prepared to leave,

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,400
Iranian officials inexplicably withheld my passport.

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,600
We had returned to our hotel parking lot

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,080
when a vehicle abruptly pulled up alongside us.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,700
Four men in military camouflage

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,920
got out and threw me in the back seat of their car.

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,600
I was blindfolded and berated the entire ride

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,020
until reaching Evin Prison,

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,760
a notorious detention center for political detainees.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
They were accusing me of espionage.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,960
I spent most of the time in an interrogation room

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,239
and one night in a hot, brightly lit cell.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,080
For days, they accused me of spying and pressed me to confess,

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,600
but I stood my ground.

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,860
Then on the fourth day, I was told I was free to go,

27
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,340
just like that.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,700
They led me to the gates where I removed my blindfold

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,460
and turned towards one of my captors.

30
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,840
He shook my hand and asked,

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,020
“Can I have your business card?

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,560
If I come to America, I would like to call you.”

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,580
Since then, I’ve interviewed world leaders

34
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,320
and covered major international events,

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,500
but that story still stands as the easiest

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,620
and the hardest of my entire career.

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
I gave the guy my business card.

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,180
I never heard from him.

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,380
My name is Jerry Seib,

40
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,260
I’m Executive Washington Editor

41
00:01:26,260 --> 00:00:00,000
for The Wall Street Journal.
