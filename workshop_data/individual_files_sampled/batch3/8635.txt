ON JULY 14TH, 2016, SHEP? Shepard: THAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. THERE IS MORE TO THIS. AT&T AND THE DRUG COMPANY NOVARTIS ACKNOWLEDGED THEY PAID THIS SAME FIRM, THIS SAME LLC OF SORTS WHICH IS MICHAEL COHEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AFTER THE ELECTION. FOR WHAT? JOHN, WHAT DO THEY SAY? . $200,000 AT LEAST TO AT&T. AND THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN TAT WAS SEEKING GOVERNMENT APPROVAL FOR MERGER WITH TIME WARNER WHICH OWNS CNN. $1.2 MILLION PAID TO COHEN'S COMPANY OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR BY KNOW YEAR BY NNOW YEAR BY NOVW YEAR BY NOVARTIS. ESSENTIAL CONSULTING WAS ONE OF SEVERAL FIRMS WE ENGAGED IN EARLY 2017 TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO UNDERSTANDING THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. THEY DID NO LEGAL OR LOBBYING WORK FOR US AND THE CONTRACT ENDED IN DECEMBER OF 2017. IN A STATEMENT TO FOX NEWS, WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF MY NOTES HERE, GIVE ME A MOMENT BECAUSE THE PAGES ARE STUCK TOGETHER, NOVARTIS SAYING BELIEVED MICHAEL COHEN COULD ADVISE THE COMPANY AS TO HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MIGHT CERTAIN HEALTHCARE MATTERS INCLUDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AFTER ONE MEETING NOVART SIR. WOULD BE UNABLE TO PRESIDE THE SERVICES ANTICIPATED RELATED TO U.S. HEALTHCARE POLICY MATTERS AND THE DECISION WAS TAKEN NOT TONE GAUGE FURTHER. BASICALLY THEY GAVE MICHAEL COHEN $1.2 MILLION FOR A SINGLE MEETING, SHEP. THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT. MICHAEL AVENATTI WILL NOT SAY WHERE HE GOT THE INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL RECORDS. THE TREASURY'S OFFICE ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOKING INTO ALL OF THAT SHEP? Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS BACK LIVE WHEN THE BRIEFING BEGINS. FIRST TO DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND FORMER PROSECUTOR U TO BE CLEAR, RUSSIAN OLIGARCH AND THEN NOVARTIS SAYS THERE WAS ONE MEETING AND THEY DETERMINED OH, NOT SO MUCH BUT THEY KEPT PAYING HIM EVERY MONTH $1.2 MILLION. THE QUESTION IS RE THEY GIVING MONEY FOR ACCESS TO TRUMP AND DID ANY OF THE MONEY EVENTUALLY GO TO TRUMP? THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE UNANSWERED, SHEP. CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE FBI, NOT ONLY IS LOOKING AT, ALREADY HAS LOOKED AT. AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE CHARGES THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT WERE REMANDED BACK TO NEW YORK SO THEY MAY NOT HAVE SEEN ANYTHING NECESSARILY WITH A CONNECTION BETWEEN COHEN'S ACTIVITIES AND THE TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. YOU KNOW, SHEP, WHAT HAPPENS IN POLITICS AND WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE POLITICAL CORRUPTION CASES IS GUYS LIKE COHEN WANT TO SELL. THEY WANT TO PEDDLE OUT THERE HEY I HAVE INFLUENCE. I HAVE GOT ACCESS. I CAN HELP YOU OUT. YOU HAVE PAY ME MONEY I WILL GIVE YOU INSIDE TRACK. I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE CANDIDATE IS THINKING. I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW TO IT COULD BE THAT THOSE COMPANIES WENT OUT THERE ON THE UNDER THE LINE OF THE LAW BUT NOT OVER THE LINE. Shepard: CLOSE TO SOMEONE MAKING A REPRESENTATION. I GOT HIS EAR. I WILL LET YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT HE IS THINKING. THEY COULD PAY FOR THAT ACCESS. WHEN IT BECOMES DICEY ORISM LEGAL IS IF THE MONEY CHANGES HAND BETWEEN THAT PERSON AND THE PERSON NOW EMPLOYED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. RIGHT. I CALL IT STRAIGHT AS A PROSECUTOR. IT'S THOUGHT A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN ISSUE. WHEN HE WOULD JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS THAT SOMEHOW TRUMP EVEN KNEW WHAT IT WAS THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS DOING. IT COULD WELL BE. Shepard: WHO JUMPED TO THAT CONCLUSION? PEOPLE ARE SAYING IN THE MEDIA WEAPON. Shepard: WE COULD KNOW HE IS INVESTIGATING. BOB MUELLER'S TEAM HAD ALREADY INTERVIEWED THIS RUSSIAN OLIGARCH WHO STEPPED OFF A PLANE ONE DAY, THEY TRIED TO LOOK AT HIGG DIGITAL RECORDS. PHONE. WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT IS ANOTHER MATTER. DOCUMENTS REQUESTED TO. THEY ARE WAY AHEAD OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE ON THIS AS THEY HAVE BEEN ON ALL OF. THIS THEY HAD THE DATA AND AFTER THEY INTERVIEWED THE OLIGARCH, WHAT DID THEY DO? THEY DIDN'T RETAIN JURISDICTION. Shepard: THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS SENT BACK HERE. WHICH, TO ME, INDICATES AT LEAST IN THAT ASPECT THAT THEY'RE NOT SEEING A CONNECTION BETWEEN TRUMP, RICKENBACKER SHAH QUOTE, UNQUOTE COLLUSION AND THESE PAYMENTS. MORE OF A MICHAEL COHEN PROBLEM. Shepard: DETRACTORS HAVE SAID THAT COULD BE THAT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR OR THE SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THIS CASE IS TRYING TO PROTECT PARTS OF THE INVESTIGATION FROM MAYBE THE DISBANDING OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL BY PUTTING OFF PARTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION TO OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. RIGHT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS TRUE. Shepard: WE JUST DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW. SOUTHERN DISTRICT MAY BE TOLD HEY, GUYS, IF YOU FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT OF ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON WITH COHEN FILES, THESE RECORDS OR WHATEVER YOU
