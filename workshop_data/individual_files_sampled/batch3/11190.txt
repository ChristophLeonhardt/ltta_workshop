hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle a cursory glance at the media environment could easily give you the impression that the vast majority of journalists studied psychology at university so many are convinced Donald Trump is not mentally fit to be President are the same journalists suffering from Trump derangement syndrome crosstalk in the medium joined by my guests team Ellsberg in New York he is a conservative political commentator in Bloomington Indiana we have Kevin Holley he is a professor of Media Studies at DePaul University and author of drones media discourse and the public imagination I love that title and in West Palm Beach we cross through dr. Gina loud and she is a psychology expert and host of America trends with dr. Gina okay crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want I always appreciate it yeah Kevin let me go to you first here is the media suffering from trumped arrangement syndrome because I could go through the things that we've had to deal with I mean I actually made up a list here you know from hat marches to the Comey stuff to the steel dossier and its contents we have the molar investigation we have a shady lawyer and Don Don jr. being just a shady one-bite saying then we have these long distance experts determining the mental health of the President of the United States and everything and there's a lot more the media goes bonkers so are the media bonkers go ahead Kevin nothing new Under the Sun in many respects we've seen this before we can go back to any number of instances think about the Clinton impeachment and and how that became a national obsession or the OJ Simpson trial what we're seeing here I think is an amplification and intensification of a tendency that's been part of the media part of sort of the part of the DNA of the corporate media for many years now okay Steve I but I do think it is different because they're trying to unseat this president without any due cause and you know you know I'm a layperson we'll we'll talk to Gina in a second she has more expertise in this here but when I see people going on in CNN and MSNBC saying the president of United States is insane and should be reviewed by reviewed removed from office that's going too far I don't think anybody said Bill Clinton was insane okay he had a problem with his zipper not as mental health go ahead Steve no I mean this to me this is unprecedented it's a continuation of Bush derangement syndrome notice it skips Democratic presidents they hated bush they said all kinds of disrespectful things against him but not to this extent I mean I've talked to people like you know in the Nixon White House who said they hated Nixon but they've never seen anything like this what the media is doing now is more dangerous than anything they have done because they're telling the world you know they're so worried about Donald Trump's tweets they're telling the world every single day and of course it's not true that our president is mentally incapacitated unable to perform his duties and that we're very very weak at this point and that we have a lot of enemies out there so they think they're playing this little game to get rid of the president and throwing journalism aside but they're actually doing severe harm to our country and I would say to journalism itself and we'll talk about that a little bit later Jeana let me go to you in West Palm Beach I mean you're a you're a professional mendel of a mental health I mean how do you react be seeing journalists on them and the cable stations talking about the mint of the health level of the President of the United States it must be quite shocking for you because you are an expert what's interesting because I don't think that they would diagnose the president you know without ever even talking to him in most cases or having a chance to speak with him clinically and so it really is it really does say a lot more honestly about their own obsession with overturning an American election I mean that's what this really comes down to they really just want to make this whole thing go away they're not happy with the election results so they'll try everything they can to negate it and and it says a lot more about their mental steadiness if you will than it does his if you look at the fact that he has functioned so amazingly well even despite all of the constant barrage of hate coming at him from the media and from the establishment and even some on his own side it says that he is a pretty mentally fit guy to be able to withstand all that and still be so productive you know Kevin you know I was looking at some of the excerpts of Michael Wolf's book I don't want to pay for it WikiLeaks put it on online for free goodness they did more good there I look through some of the excerpts there and you know I I this is his trash I uh I can't believes a lot of the things that he's writing there's no cooperation there the reason why I mention it you know who cares about the National Inquirer okay but again it's pulled on to the network something in the cable stations confirming their prejudice their blind hatred and it hurts the country it hurts journalism and I think Gina just brought up a really good point I mean I'd have never seen anyone takes so much pressure you know day in and day out and he's still going on I mean I find that actually quite remarkable not but I'm not saying I agree with everything he says or tweets I'm exasperated by a lot why a lot of it's like a lot of other people go ahead Kevin yeah a couple things I think we have to again take a little historical perspective here right the partisan press of the eighteen 1800's was young yes the advice of in ways that are very reminiscent to what we're seeing today so again I I don't think that it helps to suggest that this is somehow an anomaly I think this has historical precedent particularly when you have a very partisan press whether it was back in the days of Abraham Lincoln or in contemporary America as far as Trump taking the pressure quite well I think that is definitely debatable okay it strikes me and I'm not alone on this right it strikes me that there are many instances where he seems a particularly you know rattled by any sort of criticism and the tweet storms are you know frankly embarrassing and so you have the president United States lashing out at critics in ways that undermines the legitimacy of the presidency now I'm not a psychologist so I'm not going to get into those that's true at all sure at all all right well again here we need you may not like go ahead kick jump you can ever had we've never had a eight sorry that's okay look the fact of the matter is this president took the press to task from day one he told it like it is he was the only person who could beat Hillary Clinton because he was the only person who would stand up there and scold the press and scold his detractors and call him out for what they are that's what the people who voted for him love about him the fact that he tweaks out these things there's nothing wrong with that doesn't diminish the presidency it's who he is he's not a politician and people have to get used to that they never will and that's too darn bad he's like Franklin you're right yeah I absolutely agree with that and that's that I think it's part of the problem I mean he is in many ways a tabloid creature he's a teacher but at the same time okay now we have just a creature okay yes that's - now we have symmetry because he's an anomalous president and I would say we have an anomalous media Geena jump in you know all of these mistakes all of these bad reporting that we've seen you know and never never a backstory or you know explanation you know the last one would Don jr. and the emails you know the dates are wrong the CNN held accountable okay so this is the president who has decreased black unemployment to an all-time low this is the president who has black housing more black families have houses than ever before certainly during the Obama presidency who was supposed to be the so-called black president because he likes to chop people up and divide him that way this president is the president of all people he said he wants all people to be as rich as him and yet where's the heralding of that in the media he's the please declare January human trafficking month is slavery not an issue we can all agree on where is that in the media I mean you can see the bias written all over them and for anyone who wants to argue that his tweets are somehow not presidential that's how he communicates his message because he has no other way since the press won't do it and we know that he's a counter-puncher and you know what Americans live we are so tired of having a president that will their stand up for us to the rest of the world and put America first this is not only this is not only not diminishing the presidency this is the presidency going forward okay Steve do you want to jump in there before we go to the break go ahead Peter they they just they're putting this wolf character out there who admits half my book is inaccurate when people like Ed Klein and conservative authors can't buy a ticket to any of the shows when they write a book critical of Hillary or Obama they're ignored they're mocked as you know jokes and an inaccurate but but this wolf guy he's all over the place the double standard is just horrific okay Kevin you know I think we all saw this segment with Stephen Miller and Jake a Jake trapper on CNN I mean you know we have Stephen Miller he's invited on his program to talk about talk about what was going on in Camp David with GOP officials the weekend before he was asked to come on and talk a policy I watched it's the tape i Jake Tapper did not want to talk about policy Gina does Gina just mentioned facts okay where is CNN when talking about facts that was an ambush he was very rude Jake Tapper was very unprofessional go ahead that's the bias that I'm talking about Kevin well again I think it's I think what you're seeing is a lot of the corporate channels are chasing this story particularly the Russia Gate story you know whether or not that's a legitimate investigation not that remains to be seen right what we need to keep in mind is that there are some substantive questions about this presidency right I think in terms of his Twitter feed alone I think it would be booth corporate media to ignore that for a time in fact I'd like to see Twitter suspend his account because he's breaking user agreements oh my god but let's get back to that let's get back we're we're all chasing this same okay Wow you'd have a conversation but we were all chasing the same yes it's scandalous I asked for a conversation right now let's tone it down right and to liberate a little bit and because worries I'm sorry can be so serious then light are you directing that to the president the United States or the liberal media if you want a sense of the president you're gonna go a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the media stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Doyle to remind you were discussing Trump and the media okay let me go back to West Palm Beach where it's probably the warmest on this program Gina you know I consider myself a Midwestern all right I grew up my childhood in Colorado so I know that the heartland you know and you know we can talk about all of the intricacies of the campaign who did it say who did who did it right who did it wrong how much money was paid but you know it was really the deplorable statement and I think that really brought home to the voters you know who they are the voters in this in the in the country and where they stand in the eyes of the media because I still contend that the media elected Donald Trump because they took their you have contempt for the public the media has absolute contempt for the public and and Donald Trump he stood up for them I mean again I'm not gonna carry water for the president that I say it's a very complicated man and he's done and said things that I really don't like okay but the fact of the matter is he the the way that the media treated him actually helped him and and and the media continues to help him because of the way their their bad treatment of him and and in the heartland they feel it every single day go ahead Gina yeah that the Trump Rush a conspiracy theory that they just cannot seem to let go of is is helping him every single day that that's still in the news because it is going to come out mark my words I said it right here and I promise you it is going to come out that the only collusion that took place was on the Democrats side we will see this and all of the people who have been beating this drum so relentlessly for so long are going to look like the fools that they are and furthermore it's going to expose them the more that they talk about him being insane or anything other than policy as you said earlier the the more that they talk about how he shouldn't tweet or how he's not mentally fit or any of those things the more it exposes them their lack of mental fitness their collusion and their own problems within their party the bottom line is they don't have policy issues to run on they don't have candidates unless it's Oprah and even she is yet to be determined as anything viable and so it just it really they have themselves in a really bad place and their despair is what is showing you know it Kevin you know one Gwen can you know call the President of the United States deplorable I mean now we know that there are high officials at the FBI calling the President of the United States an idiot to buffoon insane you know what that's all fine that's all your opinion and I think people have a right to say that here but you know shouldn't the media hold itself up to a higher bar because it's not getting them anywhere they're the people have very little regard and trust in them in the news right now CNN goes from one blunder to another and brushes it off like don't look here move on they don't take any responsibility so I wonder who has to be held up to a higher bar I mean all these sophisticated people on the coasts are better than Donald Trump they don't show it on a daily basis go ahead Kevin well again I think we need to put this in a larger perspective right journalists make mistakes often times usually they they own up to it CNN CBS NBC made a horrific mistake last week and they weren't held they weren't held accountable and they weren't holding themselves accountable right that's that's a problem I agree 100% on that score but to suggest that the the news media shouldn't take an adversarial position two people in positions of power and authority is to give way to authoritarianism all right and this is not the way we need to conduct our press that's not afraid to ask tough questions and to hold people in positions of power accountable now I don't know that these are well suited to do that okay I mean this gets down to it I'll dress this to let me hang on here let me save and just this to both of you Steve and Gina here I mean what happened to the idea of a loyal opposition because this the media has abandoned that okay asking hard questions is fine over eight years Barack Obama was never asked one hard question okay not one he was given a complete free pass for eight years you know and I but Kevin is right I mean there should be adversarial but they treat him as the enemy okay that is very different than how they treated like Nixon or even Bush go ahead Steve look they said nothing to Hillary about their about the women for years and years and years that accused Bill Clinton and then how Hillary helped treat them and that never would have been an issue today if Hillary had won you're absolutely right look Barack Obama stood by and watched putin take Crimea he stood by any watch Putin go into Syria he stood by and he watched uranium one go to Putin he stood by and he did nothing at nearly as much as he could have done when it came to cybersecurity with Russia and he said on the hot mic tell Vladimir I'll have more leeway after the election yet it's Trump who's the Putin night it's Trump who's in bed with Putin that's because we don't have an adversarial media when it comes to Democrats we just plain don't because they're all Democrats that they're all Democrats well they let me go to Gina I mean most of people working with Mueller or Democrats to engage the Democratic candidates okay go ahead Gina yeah you're absolutely right and and that's why that's why this president is such a threat because he has come in and said he's going to clean house and as the elite who have enjoyed their very luxurious cushy lifestyles their access to the White House right the bureaucrats extend beyond the media as part of those enjoying that whole cushy lifestyle and so that's when the when the president came along and said he was going to drain the swamp you couldn't say more paralyzing frightening words to the elite establishment in Washington DC than those and and that goes all the way to both coasts to the banking industry to you know to where that to the real money in in the United States and that's why as you mentioned early in the conversation they want to deal Ajith amaizing fact if they could just make the Electoral College go away so the only votes that count were those in the financial centers on the coasts and just overlook the heartland altogether they would do it in a heartbeat because that would mean they could get away with the corruption that this president is cleaning up okay okay the eternal college is really interesting I just say to our viewers here if they get rid of the Ettore electoral college then we have to get rid of California Washington and Oregon okay and that'll create a little bit of balance there or else it'll be it'll be Democrat forever okay just these little acapella goes on the east and west coasts will dominate the country's politics here you know Kevin you know what does the media have to do to get its credibility back because as we pointed out on this program so many gaffes and or is it just the business model it just built in right now I mean you write these trashy salacious stories and you get hits and eyeballs and yeah that's your that's your that's your model well I mean you know there's nothing wrong with making money for your shareholders but I thought journalism had a higher cause like informing people go ahead well lot to take on there I think we need to start with trying to avoid taking on very difficult complex nuanced questions and do it in such a simple-minded fashion yeah right and I think that's large part of what's going on you know to take just one example the whole notion of Trump coming in to drain the swamp if you look at the man's cabinet if you look at his policies I have to look at what he's done over the past year clearly this is a textbook example of crony capitalism there's no such thing as draining the swamp he's what he's done is he's putting people people in positions of power to dismantle the government to dismantle regulations and to invite you know take the tax package that just passed all right this is a giant giveaway this has very little to do with the middle class and certainly nothing to do with working class the taxpayer does giveaway this the gift to the moneyed class okay Gina go ahead jump in go ahead yeah his words don't even make sense to most people normal deplorable types like me out there when he says that he's eliminated regulations that is eliminating government that is quintessentially draining the swamp when he says that eliminated whole vast parts of departments making government smaller is bringing it closer to the people that was the intention of the founders of our Constitution and the president is restoring that in record time with more than 80 accomplishments in his first year and repealing more than 11 of Obama's rule by edict he is eliminating the swamp it's systemic and you can say that his his cabinet is comprised of I mean you can label people however you want but the the actions speak a lot louder than the words my friend okay well you know Steve I mean speaking speaking quite loudly in terms of whether words whether it's environmental policy or whether it's the tax policy all right any any suggestion that this is nothing more than a handout to the well-to-do is wishful thinking okay we're getting up we're going into the weeds here okay I want to talk about the media so we got two more minutes though yeah and you know Steve I mean the problem is is that the media is so damn elitist in the end and they and they they cannot they cannot see outside of their ideological bubble they simply can't comprehend how other people live okay and you know Donald Trump like him or hate him he traveled the country back and forth back and forth he even went up to the blue the blue wall no wonder it fell okay he saw how the American people live this is one of the things that I I admire him for actually getting his hands dirty and actually talking to people and that the Democrats don't have a message in there they don't they're not connected with the people this one man is I don't know about the GOP one minute left go ahead Steve yeah yeah Peter the media doesn't care they're in they're elitist bubble and their purpose is to ruin the presidency of Donald Trump in them in the meantime it's to get the Congress back in the hands of the Democrats and the first thing they'll do is impeach the president that is their whole purpose when you have ESPN anchors calling the president effin stupid and when you have Fareed Zakaria on two separate occasions saying over and over in the same separate shows the presidents of BS artists but he says the word and nothing happens and there's many examples of that throughout the media they have a goal they don't care about middle America they don't care about anything their management is on board they're on board ruin the presidency of Donald Trump at all costs Gina 20 seconds go ahead I chose to support this president when I saw him stay after very early on in the campaign while all the other 15 Republican candidates ducked out after they talked to the alphabet-soup media I watched this president stay for two hours and answer questions from every little citizen journalists bloggers that's how much he cares about the people that haven't had a voice in America including the the low-level media and oK we've totally run out of time many thanks to my guest in New York Bloomington and in West Palm Beach and thanks to our viewers who are watching us here at RT see you next time and remember across tocqueville's
