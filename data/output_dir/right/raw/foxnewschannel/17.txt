00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:03,195
WHIP STEVE SCALISE.

2
00:00:03,196 --> 00:00:05,464
HE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.

3
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:06,465
MR. SCALISE, WHAT DO YOU THINK

4
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,033
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH A WAVE

5
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,001
OF PACKAGES ADDRESSED TO

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,703
DEMOCRATS AND PROMINENT CRITICS

7
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,271
OF THE PRESIDENT BEING DELIVERED

8
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:14,272
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

9
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:16,141
>> WELL, GOOD MORNING.

10
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,376
THIS IS VERY DISTURBING WHAT

11
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:18,844
YOU'RE SEEING.

12
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:21,980
I'M VERY FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF LAW

13
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,814
ENFORCEMENT, CONFIDENT THEY WILL

14
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,249
FIND OUT WHO EXACTLY DID THIS

15
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,384
THEY WILL FIGURE THIS OUT.

16
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,952
THAT PERSON SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO

17
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:33,325
JUSTICE AND IT SHOULD BE SWIFT.

18
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:34,893
FOR NOW MAKE SURE WE'RE CALMING

19
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:37,462
DOWN THE RHETORIC, NOT POINTING

20
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,864
FINGERS, MY GOODNESS THE WE

21
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:39,898
SHOULD ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT

22
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,734
WITH ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED.

23
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:44,469
BRIAN: WHEN SOMEONE ALMOST BLED

24
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,172
TO DEATH WHEN YOU WERE SHOT BY A

25
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,807
BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER AT

26
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:50,675
SECOND BASE TRYING TO PRACTICE

27
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,244
FOR A SOFTBALL GAME, WHAT DO YOU

28
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:53,945
WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW WHAT DO

29
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,314
YOU HOPE HAPPENS NEXT 24, 48

30
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:58,216
HOURS AS WE GO ON AN MASSIVE

31
00:00:58,217 --> 00:00:59,785
HUNT TO FIND OUT WHO IS

32
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:00,185
RESPONSIBLE?

33
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,889
WHAT WILL BE YOUR FOCUS, STEVE?

34
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,424
>> MY FOCUS IS TO BE CLEAR THERE

35
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,893
IS NO PLACE FOR THIS IN AMERICAN

36
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,461
POLITICS THIS IS HOW THINGS GO

37
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:10,996
IN THIRD WORLD NATIONS WHERE

38
00:01:10,997 --> 00:01:12,464
PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN GO

39
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:15,267
THREATEN, BULLY, INTIMIDATE,

40
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:16,435
TERRORIZE PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR

41
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:17,269
POLITICAL VIEWS.

42
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,004
THAT IS NOT WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS

43
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:19,538
ABOUT.

44
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,274
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'LL BE

45
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,076
ULTIMATELY B WE'LL FIGURE OUTLAW

46
00:01:25,077 --> 00:01:26,645
ENFORCEMENT WILL FIGURE OUT WHO

47
00:01:26,646 --> 00:01:27,946
DID THIS BUT THERE IS NO PLACE

48
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:28,413
FOR IT.

49
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,916
AINSLEY: AFTER ALL THE

50
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,617
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES WE STARTED

51
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:33,952
TO DETERMINE THEY WERE ALL BEING

52
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:36,354
SENT TO DEMOCRATS PEOPLE WERE ON

53
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:37,189
NETWORK SHOWS BLAMING THE

54
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,323
PRESIDENT FOR THIS.

55
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,858
JOHN BRENNAN IS EVEN RESPONDING

56
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,593
TO THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET THIS

57
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:42,727
MORNING SAYING STOP BLAMING

58
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,863
OTHER THE, LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

59
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,565
BLAMING HIM FOR HIS INFLAMMATORY

60
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,700
RHETORIC AN INSULTS AND LIES

61
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:49,968
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET

62
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:50,302
VIOLENT.

63
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:52,003
WE HAD DEMOCRATS THAT ENCOURAGED

64
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,572
PEOPLE TO GET VIOLENT, GET IN

65
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,341
THE FACE OR SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE

66
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:56,975
ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE.

67
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:58,677
WHEN YOU HEAR BOTH SIDES HAVING

68
00:01:58,678 --> 00:01:59,945
THESE ARGUMENTS, WHAT GOES

69
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:01,112
THROUGH YOUR MIND?

70
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:02,180
BECAUSE YOU WERE TARGETED

71
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:03,548
BECAUSE YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN.

72
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:04,916
TODAY THE STORY IS A LITTLE

73
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,318
DIFFERENT IN FACT THAT DEMOCRATS

74
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,487
ARE BEING TARGETED BUT IS YOUR

75
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:11,756
MESSAGE, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH?

76
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,624
>> IT IS.

77
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,559
LOOK THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY CAN

78
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,130
USE THIS AND TRY TO GO AND HAVE

79
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,866
A PRESS CONFERENCE BLAME

80
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:21,900
SOMEBODY ELSE THAT HAS NOTHING

81
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,401
TO DO WITH IT, THEY DON'T EVEN

82
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,837
KNOW THE FACTS, THIS IS THE NOT

83
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,239
THE TIME TO POINT FINGERS.

84
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,107
WE NEED TO CALM IT DOWN.

85
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,375
EVERYBODY'S RHETORIC SHOULD BE

86
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,077
FOCUSED ON THE IDEA WE HAVE A

87
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,778
GREAT NATION WE CAN DISAGREE

88
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,280
WITH EACH OTHER, YOU DON'T MAKE

89
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,916
IT PERSONAL, YOU DON'T RESORT TO

90
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:38,483
ATTACKS.

91
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:41,186
IF YOU THREATENING SOMEBODY ELSE

92
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:42,587
YOU PRETTY MUCH LOST THE

93
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:43,455
ARGUMENT ALREADY.

94
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,023
FOCUS WING DEBATE, IF YOU HAVE

95
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,025
BETTER IDEAS, SHOW THE IDEAS.

96
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,427
WE'LL HAVE AN ELECTION 12 DAYS

97
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,862
ULTIMATELY SETTLE THE POLITICAL

98
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:51,263
DIFFERENCES.

99
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,531
THAT IS HOW WE SETTLE THEM IN

100
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,966
AMERICA AT THE BALLOT BOX, NOT

101
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:55,667
THE VIOLENCE.

102
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,068
BRIAN: STEVE, DID YOU BLAME

103
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,703
BERNIE SANDERS FOR YOU BEING

104
00:02:58,704 --> 00:02:59,104
SHOT?

105
00:02:59,105 --> 00:02:59,538
>> NO.

106
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:00,805
BRIAN: SO WHY DO YOU THINK

107
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,674
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON BLAMING

108
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:03,408
THE PRESIDENT?

109
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,943
>> YOU KNOW THESE ARE PEOPLE

110
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:07,078
THAT HAVE HATED EVERYTHING THE

111
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,347
PRESIDENT STOOD FOR.

112
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,348
DONALD TRUMP RAN SOMEBODY LAYING

113
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,917
OUT A VERY SPECIFIC AGENDA FOR

114
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,618
THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE AMERICA

115
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:14,886
GREAT AGAIN AND HE IS DOING IT.

116
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,721
ALL THE THINGS HE HAS DONE AS

117
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,156
PRESIDENT, HAVE BEEN THINGS HE

118
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,691
PROMISED AND IT IS WORKING.

119
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:21,426
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THE

120
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:22,727
FACT OUR ECONOMY IS DOING SO

121
00:03:22,728 --> 00:03:23,028
WELL.

122
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,829
THAT WE'RE FINALLY CHANGING THE

123
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,264
DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY,

124
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:27,399
GETTING THINGS BACK ON TRACK.

125
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,434
IF SOMEBODY HAS A BETTER IDEA,

126
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:30,969
BETTER SET OF IDEAS, LET THEM

127
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,836
LAY THAT OUT.

128
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,371
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA.

129
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,507
THEY WANT TO MAKE THIS ABOUT

130
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,207
PERSONALITY, THEY'RE AGAINST

131
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:36,575
SOMEBODY.

132
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,510
THAT IS NOT WHAT WILL WIN THIS

133
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:38,877
ELECTION.

134
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:40,312
I'VE BEEN GETTING ALL AROUND THE

135
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:43,181
COUNTRY, PEOPLE FIRST OF ALL

136
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,449
THEY LIKE ECONOMIC GROWTH WE'RE

137
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,783
HAVING.

138
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:46,151
THEY DON'T LIKE TONE OF

139
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,587
POLITICS, WHEN THEY SEE PEOPLE

140
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,755
THREATENING CABINET SECRETARIES,

141
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,190
RUN PEOPLE IT OF RESTAURANTS

142
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,558
BASED ON THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.

143
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:54,859
THAT IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS.

144
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,561
THAT WILL NOT WIN THEM THE HOUSE

145
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,296
OR SENATE, WHATEVER ELSE THEY'RE

146
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:59,831
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH FOR

147
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:00,532
ELECTION CYCLE.

148
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,967
IT'S A BATTLE OF IDEAS.

149
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,535
I THINK WE HAVE BETTER IDEAS.

150
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:04,536
WE'RE WORKING FOR PRESIDENT

151
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,404
TRUMP, WORKING FOR FAMILIES THAT

152
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,574
HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN FOR SO LONG.

153
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,209
THEY ARE GLAD SOMEBODY FINALLY

154
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,477
STANDING UP FOR THEM.

155
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:13,311
AINSLEY: DOES THIS CHANGE THE

156
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:16,014
WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE, WHEN YOU

157
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:18,049
GO TO THE MAILBOX OR EVEN

158
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,150
PRACTICING FOR BASEBALL?

159
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,719
>> YOU CAN'T LET IT CHANGE THE

160
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,753
WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE.

161
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,288
IF YOU DO THEN THEY WIN.

162
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,423
SO ULTIMATELY WE'VE GOT TO

163
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:27,392
CONTINUE TO GO ON WITH OUR LIFE,

164
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,260
BE MORE VIGILANT, PEOPLE HAVE

165
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,397
BEEN REALLY GOOD OVER THE YEARS,

166
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:33,565
ESPECIALLY SINCE

167
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,667
SEPTEMBER 11th, IF THEY SEE

168
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,801
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS THEY REPORT

169
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:37,202
IT.

170
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:38,503
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE SEEING SO

171
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,640
MANY LATEST PACKAGES BEING

172
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,007
REPORTED.

173
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:43,908
PEOPLE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

174
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,743
VIGILANT IN AMERICA.

175
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,478
PEOPLE HATE US FOR WHO WE ARE,

176
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,046
WHAT OUR VALUES ARE.

177
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:50,448
IT MAKES OUR COUNTRY GREAT

178
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,883
BECAUSE WE HAVE GREAT VALUES.

179
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:53,718
PEOPLE WANT TO MANY COULD TO OUR

180
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:54,586
COUNTRY TO BE PART OF THE

181
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:55,420
AMERICAN DREAM.

182
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,588
PEOPLE WANT TO COME TO THE

183
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,822
COUNTRY TO DO US HARM.

184
00:04:57,823 --> 00:04:59,858
WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF BOTH.

185
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,960
STEVE: MR. SCALISE, ONE OF THE

186
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,828
THINGS DOESN'T ADD UP TO THE

187
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,664
ANALYSTS ON THE AIR, EVERYBODY

188
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,565
KNOWS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,

189
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,668
FORMER PRESIDENTS, DEMOCRATS,

190
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:10,669
AMERICANS, DON'T NECESSARILY

191
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,070
OPEN THEIR OWN MAIL.

192
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,173
THEY GO TO A CONTAINMENT

193
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:15,540
FACILITY.

194
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,042
EVERY PIECE OF MAIL IN CONGRESS

195
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:20,845
IS OPENED OFF SIGHT, OFTEN TIME

196
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,548
IN OTHER STATES.

197
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,583
IF THEY WERE TRYING, TO YOU

198
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:28,420
KNOW, THE PERSON, BLOW UP THE

199
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,422
PERSON THAT IT WAS ADDRESSED TO,

200
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:33,391
THAT PERSON DOESN'T OPEN THE

201
00:05:33,392 --> 00:05:33,758
ENVELOPE.

202
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,959
>> WHO KNOWS WHAT THE REAL

203
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,661
MOTIVATION IS, WHAT THEY'RE

204
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,364
REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH, BUT

205
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:40,799
ULTIMATELY WHAT I AM CONFIDENT

206
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
OF IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET

207
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:42,834
CAUGHT.

208
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,502
WHEN THEY GET CAUGHT WE'LL KNOW

209
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:45,503
A LOT MORE.

210
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:46,938
RIGHT NOW NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING

211
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,640
ABOUT WHO IS BEHIND THIS.

212
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,341
FOR THEM TO TRY TO GIVE SOME

213
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:52,477
KIND OF COMMENTARY ABOUT WHO IS

214
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,778
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, WHEN THEY

215
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,714
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO IS

216
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:57,749
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, TRYING TO

217
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,583
ASSIGN BLAME TO SOMEBODY, THAT

218
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:01,553
IS THE KIND OF POLITICS PEOPLE

219
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:04,122
REALLY ARE DISGUSTED BY.

220
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,523
THIS IS NOT TIME FOR THAT.

221
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,558
TIME FOR UNIFYING.

222
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,093
NOT CHANGE WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT

223
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:08,426
AMERICA.

224
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:09,661
WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LAW

225
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,063
ENFORCEMENT WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW

226
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,932
WHO DID THIS AND CONTINUE TO

227
00:06:13,933 --> 00:00:00,000
MOVE FORWARD AS THE GREATEST
