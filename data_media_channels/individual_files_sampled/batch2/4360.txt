there is other news tonight on the Russia investigation this morning the president was on Twitter lo that many hours ago to weigh in on the Muller investigation quote why did the Obama administration start an investigation into the Trump campaign with zero proof of wrongdoing long before the election in November wanted to discredit so crooked Hillary would win unprecedented bigger than Watergate Plus Obama did nothing about Russian meddling also NBC News has confirmed the New York Times reporting that the State Department has still not spent any of the 120 million dollars set aside to counter Russian election interference plus there is this a piece in The New Yorker book-length we might add about Christopher Steele author of the Trump Russia dossier has this detail alleging that the Kremlin was involved in more than just our elections The New Yorker reports Steele is believed to have discussed a memo he wrote after the 2016 election with special counsel Muller that memo was based on one source described as a senior Russian official and we quote from the journalist Jane Mayer the official said that he was merely relaying talks circulating in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs but what he heard was astonishing people were saying that the Kremlin had intervened to block Trump's initial choice for Secretary of State Mitt Romney if what the source heard was true then a foreign power was exercising pivotal influence over u.s. foreign policy and an incoming president we have a surprise because we've talked our three journalists into sticking around Phill Rucker Jill Colvin John Heilemann John this this is alleging but you have to kind of gather yourself and reset that Russia the Kremlin had some form of veto power over who our Secretary of State well Jay Maher was very careful in the way she couched it as was Christopher Steele apparently in this memo one source single source not clear you know again it's it's raw intelligence like all the rest of the the steel dossier but look if you think about Donald Trump's candidacy and his presidency the things he says the policies he's pursued the policies he hasn't pursued the appointments he's made who is Secretary of State who isn't spending the money that's designed to combat Russian meddling all of those things each one of them would be the choice that Vladimir Putin would make in every instance if you look at the entirety of it and I and if you think about that and you think about the fact that we're still concerned about Russians meddling in the 2018 elections there's none of this that is actually terribly surprising including the detail if true that Jamie offers up from this unpublished Steele memo Philip how is this likely all of it going over in the Oval Office and by this hour I guess in the residents and remember this in so many of his appearances today nunberg has casually tossed into the conversation you know I came up with the wall and what does Donald Trump hate it's a it's a remark like that from someone he sees as an underling that's exactly right remember Trump fumed over Steve ban and taking credit for aspects of the campaign and for being this so-called mastermind that helped get him elected in the general election Trump wants credit for all of it but the more and more headlines about Russia the more frustrated and angry the president gets we had a story over the weekend about how for much of last week he was raging in the residence staying up late at night watching television up earlier the next morning watching television calling his friends calling his kitchen cabinet of advisers in fits of rage over aspects of the Russia probe whether it's the conduct of Attorney General Jeff Sessions or the scrutiny every day there was a new drip about Jared Kushner his son-in-law and White House senior adviser so it bothers him and I can't imagine that he's pleased to see this Jane Mayer piece which by the way is an extraordinary piece of reporting it really is some forty pages and length and Jill Colvin same question do your reporting as well how much more will this darken the atmosphere yeah I mean very similar to what Phil said what we've heard is that the White House right now is in dire times people are comparing this to the lowest moments during the White House during the campaign comparing it for instance to the Charlottesville back and forth that got so much criticism and the president is increasingly isolated here you've got hope Hicks who's departing you've got all of this attention on Jared Kushner now you've got questions about John Kelly he just doesn't really have anybody around him to turn to which is why you're seeing him calling more and more of these outside advisors who then white up leaking and and just kind of creating the cycle of more stories about the turmoil in the chaos all right now you guys when I say thank you for joining us I really mean that Phillip record Jill Colvin John Heilemann three superb journalists helping to start us off tonight coming up for us how does the Trump legal team now react to these allegations made all day on live television we'll ask the man who once
