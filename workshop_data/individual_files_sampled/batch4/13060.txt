that we've got the cellphone squared away we've were mourning the loss of my rachel maddow glasses let's mourn the loss of leftist companies money because they are learning this hard lesson repeat after me get woke go baroque the first guy that's learning about this is is the CEO of Nike right now because you might have heard Ryan Gosling angered half of the country over the weekend by writing the American flag out of the moon landing and defending that decision so I I think he thought that he had the best way to offend Americans over the weekend and then Nike turned to him and said Ryan hold my gatorade because they decided to make the new face of Nike the new image that they are gonna put on all of their advertising Colin Kaepernick the guy who who disrespects and protests the American flag the symbol of the country itself the the quote that they're using on this stupid image of Kaepernick said it says believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything here's how people are reacting I'm enjoy hell I might buy go buy some adidas hmm you know how many other sneakers are to buy to choose from there to go ahead you're gonna go ahead and say hey buy them our shoes we stand with people who kneel for the national anthem well sorry Nike I've been buying you for the past twenty plus years not anymore for those of you who are just listening I think you got the gist of it you could probably hear the little sweatshop produced shoes crackling in the background but this guy's burning is set of sneakers and this is really hard for me because I don't know that I've ever even considered wearing running shoes out in public I don't I'm not a big exercise guy as you might have discovered but let me tell you something if Nike produced penny loafers they would have lost one customer today baby they would be out of it they don't they don't make that unfortunately but I still now anytime I do buy athletic you're not using Nike I think this is true of half the country this statement is obviously ridiculous this believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything conservatives get this wrong sometimes because we to focus on the form and not just the and and not the content so you can believe in I mean it now believed in something Stalin believed in something Hitler believed in something all of the worst ideologues in history have believed in something they've just believed in bad things David Duke believes in something right doesn't Louis Farrakhan believes it do you believe in something but the question is what are you believing in and what Colin Kaepernick believes in is that he hates the United States he hates this country i I want to spell this out I've been tweeting about this and and the left doesn't seem to understand this Colin Kaepernick is protesting the United States itself the country itself how do i deduce this well Colin Kaepernick is protesting the national anthem which is the star-spangled banner which is the American flag which is a symbol of the country itself the flag represents the country the star-spangled banner represents the country now people will say well he doesn't say he's he's protesting the flag that's not true by the way he does say that he's protesting the flag he said I will not stand up for a flag of a country that oppresses black people or whatever whatever hitch a new juror is so he actually does say that he's protesting the flag but even if he didn't even if he said even if he stands there he's kneeling he's he's not gonna stand up for the American flag and he says I'm really protesting mint chocolate chip ice cream no you don't understand I'm protesting mint chocolate chip ice cream you said no but no you're not you might be saying that you might think that that's what you're protesting but you're not because what you are protesting in a demonstrable way in a verifiable way I can look at the video you are protesting the star-spangled banner which is the flag which represents the country that's what he's doing and this guy I don't think we should defend this guy at all because some of the conservatives get this wrong true they'll say well I defend I defend his right to protest say sure like sure I don't know that anybody does agrees with that and they'll say the flag stands in part for the right to protest and therefore I support his protest know that yeah you're actually right the flag does in part stand for the right to protest that's why it's so idiotic to protest it because it's a self-defeating protest your approach that is true if the flag stands in part for the right to protest then you're protesting the right to protest so what are you left with you're undercutting your own demonstration the jesters and said there's a thought that stops thought that's the only thought that ought to be stopped but beyond this for the people who think that Colin Kaepernick is really just this high-minded racial justice activist who's really seeing something that we're not all seeing it beyond the statistics he's really seeing a de jure or de facto policy of discrimination against black people by the police department if that's really what's happening first of all why isn't he protesting police departments why is he protesting the flag but also why does he make all of his other statements why does he wear t-shirts of Fidel Castro why does he make openly anti-american statements the the the left is trying to turn this guy into as some civil rights hero that's not what he is he's what the communists would call a useful idiot here's Colin Kaepernick defending Fidel Castro so it's good to have an open mind about Fidel Castro and his oppression I'm not talking about the Bell Castro and I'm talking about literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in our prisons or public we do not do here he also did something that we do not do here he broke up families he took over a country again without any you know justice and without any elections we do break up families here that's what mass incarceration is that was the foundation of slavery so our country has been based on that as well as identified Native American are you equated the breaking up of Cuban families with people going to jail in the United States of America i'ma craving the breaking up of family who's breaking up with them Wow amazing that is amazing that is really amazing because this guy's a dolt I mean I'm not saying that he's the main issue here but he's a dolt who is being used by seriously bad people and defending seriously bad things like Fidel Castro none of what he said is true by the way that I've been to Cuba I don't think Colin Kapernick has been to Cuba I've been to Cuba I've talked to the Cuban people the the propaganda that comes out of the Castro slave regime is that they have the greatest education system they have the greatest health care system it isn't true I was talking to a Cuban he said there's the there's the hospital there's the famous hospital in Havana said oh so anybody can go in there and it's universal health care said yeah anybody can go in there there won't be any medicine you can't get any surgery done but you can go in yeah everybody can go in and when you do go and you've got to bring your own toilet paper you've got to bring your own tools you've got to bring your own instruments and really what happens is people just purchase healthcare on the black market they're it's it's slavery says the the Castro's don't break up families they're not though that we weep by imprisoning our criminals we're a slave country Fidel Castro imprisoned a whole nation a whole country for decade upon decade this is the kind of stuff Colin Kaepernick stands up for this has nothing to do with police brutality in the United States that says everything to do with his is actually communist idiocy is actual defense demonstrable verifiable there it is I'm not creating something out of thin air defending communist thugs this is an anti-american ideology and it's an anti-american ideology that fuels that protest before we get any further I cuz I've got to check the time so that we don't run out of time today let me thank movement you know movement in VMT we don't got time for Val movement is that company founded by those two college dropouts they started a watch company it's growing like crazy they've sold almost 2 million watches in over 160 countries around the world they are revolutionising fashion on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank I loved

store you got this movement watch this one is from the revolver collection which is their coolest collection this would cost four or five hundred dollars movement cuts out the middleman I will tell you every time I go to specifically to the bank but I've noticed this at other places too but literally every single time I go to the bank people compliment me on this watch other places I go to the

e CY movement keeps growing CY I keep buying it for my family and friends it is great and they've got an expanding collection MVM t.com / co f fa co the fe fe joy and the movement so that's that's Colin Kapernick the issue here though isn't just Colin Kaepernick because some some guy you know some guy who is at the end of his football career and now has to become a shoe salesman that's the real life story of Al Bundy as many people in the internet we're pointing out this is also terrible business so I woke up this morning this was trending all day yesterday Nike hashtag just do it hashtag boycott Nike said this isn't good I've noticed that when when the left when the left takes over businesses those businesses go down their profit margins shrink and they start to lose money this is exactly what happened by the time I woke up this morning Nike was down four billion dollars in market capitalization this is all because of Colin Kaepernick and it's been fluctuating all day between three and four billion dollars they're down this is not just a regular fluctuation in their trading this is a direct response to Kaepernick and it is a significant drop of the 3% in the the value of their company this is true across businesses they I don't I really don't understand why the left keeps doubling down on this or rather why businesses keep doubling down on the left it is costing the money left and right and this tells us something about our politics you're gonna hear Democrats and critics of the administration harping on the generic ballot oh no the generic ballot looks really bad for the midterm so no the generic ballot looks really bad for 2020 the numbers that we're seeing coming out of Nike the numbers that we're seeing coming out of other businesses who embrace the left are telling us a lot more than the generic opinion polls from political analysts are telling us a lot more and well we can see it with this Ryan Gosling movie the first man directed by Damien Chazelle is that how you pronounce his name Damien chase all I don't know he's the guy who did lala land and now they've done this movie called the first man which is about the moon landing and in the moment where Neil Armstrong touches down they cut out the planting of the American flag in the moon Ryan Gosling gave his explanation of this he said quote I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement and that's how we chose to view it I also think Neil was extremely humble as were many of these astronauts and time and time again he deferred the focus from himself to the 400,000 people who made the mission possible so Ryan Gosling you're speaking for Neil Armstrong who most certainly would have called himself an American and was a proud American Buzz Aldrin is ripping this movie for not showing the American flag ripping this political talking point but it's I think I've actually explode out why Ryan Gosling is spouting the sort of stupidity this was in a little watched aspect of a Jimmy Kimmel interview that's why nobody watched it obviously because it was part of a Jimmy Kimmel interview but here Ryan Gosling explains the only plausible explanation for his defense of not including the flag but it's this thing that kind of sends you like you know ass over teakettle for like you know like they would only do it for maybe 20 minutes at a time or something but in the movie because we had to get a lot of shots I was in it for like six to eight hours for real got with it going yeah so I started to just sort of smell a rat up here you know what do you mean well like that I was something was wrong like I was I was that and getting banged or in the capsules and hitting my head that something might be wrong what was wrong well I knew something was wrong when I called I went home one night and I called Ava and I was uh I was just hell-bent on this idea that there were people in donut stores all around the world you know trying to charm their way into getting free donuts and what did what did Ava say to that she was she was so patient and listening and you know and then she was saying you know I I think you might have you know drain Babbage no notice there's doughnut charmers everywhere and it's a problem and and no one's doing anything about it if this really happened yeah and she was like I've been saying you have drain damage as a joke but I think you might have brain damage you know you should go to the hospital did you go to the hospital yes you did yeah and what they say that I had a minor concussion that explains it that's the only way to explain this defense and all of that is to say I don't really care what actors think generally speaking it doesn't really matter to me that if Ryan Gosling thinks that this wasn't an American achievement who cares what matters is that the movie lies about history revises history and it says this wasn't an American achievement this is a human achievement and Jeremy boring the god-king and you know the sports correspondent from our sister network daily wire - he wrote a great piece about this over the weekend where he explained that sure it's a human achievement America is the human achievement all of the great achievements of the last 200 years have come from the United States they've come from the United States because the United States itself is a magnificent human achievement an achievement of freedom of the of the body politic of the way that free markets and free ideas and free thought and the anglo-american inheritance of free politics has allowed unbelievable developments in science even art even the art that Ryan Gosling is allowed to take part in that that's certainly true it's a human achievement but it's a human achievement done by particular humans in a particular time by a particular that's America they want to wash over that but when you abstract to beyond what actually happened when you try to create this generic abstraction you lose all of the things that actually happened and the issue here is the audience because actors I say this I've acted before that you know in indie movies and plays and things like that I say this in all humility actress aren't often not the brightest people in the world my old acting teacher one of the great acting teachers he's been around for 70 years probably at this point teaching he would say that actors have to become gullible fools you have to become a gullible fool that's not a knock on actors it's because you need to be so receptive to imaginary circumstances and live truthfully and imaginary circumstances so we don't expect our actors to be able to you know lecture on aspects of history or philosophy or whatever the classic image you have is of the sort of dumb actor there were plenty of smart actors by the way I know a lot of them out here I won't name them oh there that James Woods is so out there on Twitter I'll say he's very smart I mean you went to MIT I think I won't name the other smart actors I know because they'll probably lose their careers by virtue of having any association with me but but James Woods has already lost his agents that's fine but but the trouble here is the audience because about half the country is gonna eat this up about half the country believes where Ryan Gosling is saying right now and look fortunately probably half the country doesn't believe that which is why I can't imagine this movie is going to do very well it's it's certainly not going to hit its expectations there gonna be a lot of people so turned off by this that gogo broke is almost certainly going to affect them as well but even then what if their thought is because one of the explanations for this is that they want to be able to sell it overseas they don't want to offend the foreign markets by making this about planting an American flag and so they're not gonna put it in there that is a good argument for nationalism if we are so dislodged from our bonds of loyalty to our own country this wonderful country of ours is the greatest country in the history of the world the most prosperous the most generous the most charitable country in the history of the world if we're so divorced from our bonds of loyalty to that country because we want to make a buck in China that is a good argument for national that's actually an argument against unfettered free trade that is I mean there is something really that's lost by this we're gonna be talking to the political philosopher Yoram hezonia week about his new book the virtues of nationalism but that's this is a good good argument for that we saw this in 2006 with that Superman movie when they replaced truth justice in the American way with truth justice and all that other stuff so that's so horribly offensive but it's going to affect this movie mark my words if go get woke go broke this has happened for every company that's touched it Facebook and Twitter for the first time ever this year Facebook saw a decline in its daily usership for the first time Twitter saw a massive decline in its monthly user ship why is that all of those numbers coincided with the mass censorship and ad integration of conservatives suppression of conservative ideas on those platforms when you start picking aside when you start alienating half of the country you're going to lose money that's no

additional 10% I wonder why gee I wonder why this corresponds exactly to the timing of the Colin Kaepernick protest and Nike apparently saw that and they said wow the NFL has managed to turn off virtually all of their audience by promoting this guy now we should get him to be our spokesman that oh that's a great we're making too much money we got to start hemorrhaging money how about the Oscars when the Oscars became this political left-wing gab fest there last year the Oscars ratings were down 19% they were down 19% over the previous year which was a nine-year low how about CNN's ratings good is anybody watching CNN no CNN is down 25% now year-over-year in primetime and you got to remember there on in every airport in the world if you took out the airports I think they would have negative ratings I don't know how that works technically but I think there would be fewer than zero people watching them eat this even effects Marvel comic books DC finally overtook Marvel comic books in sales this was largely attributed by analysts to Marvel taking a turn for the social justice warriors this is a really bad idea and it has a lot to do with our politics as well we can learn a lot when they're these lefties are gonna be telling you look at the polls it's awful for Republicans don't stay just stay home Republicans you're gonna lose it Trump's bad it's blah blah blah blah blah look at the real polls which are all of those numbers because those polls are very reactive they're very reactive to markets and to real people it's still socially unacceptable in many orders to say that you support Donald Trump it's acceptable and unacceptable in many workplaces certainly on the campuses in a lot of aspects of our society so people are just not going to say it but I'm telling you this guy has not lost folks he's only gained votes and you're seeing this reflected in markets and you're seeing it in our politics so today we had a really hearing for Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed to the Supreme Court look at how the Democrats behave themselves here's Chuck Grassley the Republican trying to hold these confirmation hearings good morning I welcome everyone to this confirmation hearing on the nomination of mr. Brett Kavanaugh mr. chairman to serve as associate justice mr. Chairman I before we proceed mr. chairman I'd like to be recognized to ask a question before we proceed the committee received just last night less than 15 hours ago 4,000 pages of documents that we have not had an opportunity to review or read or analyze you are you're out of order I'll proceed we cannot possibly move forward mr. chairman there's two daughters mr. chairman or Harris mr. chairman even doors were closed and documents that we have and everyone else join me tonight and we believe this hearing should know this an exciting day for all of you here and you're rightly proud of them and if we cannot be recognized I move to adjourn the American people Chairman I move to adjourn directly mr. Chairman I move to adjourn and mr. chairman petulant little children chuck grassley handed him handled himself so well here by not even acknowledging their childish outbursts their their neuralgic little outbursts here it's it's it says a lot about this party they have no political recourse to this nomination because the American people voted them out resoundingly in large part because of these Supreme Court seats and they have nothing to offer they have no points to say and so they're going to interrupt they have no respect for rules they have no respect for decorum and they're just gonna say but I don't like it I'm gonna don't use it listen you have to conduct yourself like an adult if you're not gonna conduct yourself like an adult you're going to be ignored all of them mr. Chairman I move to adjourn well all right you can move move whatever you want go move right on out of this place man because we're gonna confirm Brett Kavanaugh hah hah hah hah hah they've got nothing and this is what they're gonna run on I mean the reason they did this today is because they want to get good footage for their TV commercials in when they're in their own elections and Kamala Harris who started all of that off wants to get good footage for her presidential commercials this is not going to play well this doesn't look good people don't really like this they don't it's sort of like the psychology of lines you know people don't mind it how long a line is until people start breaking the rules and then everybody gets very anxious it's the same thing with politics people don't mind when they're out of power as long as they as everyone's playing by the rules because they know there's a way for them to get back in power but when they start breaking the rules like this when they start trying to undercut the rules shouting over people having no sense of decorum it's chaos people hate that people on the left and the right will hate that voters will not like that so good I hope you air this all over television I hope you got your clips today guys because it really doesn't look good speaking of being petulant little children Steve Bannon was invited to headline the New Yorker conference you know that magazine that nobody's read for 30 years the one with the cartoons that nobody understands the the cartoons that are just dry to the point of not being a joke so he was invited to headline this conference and then there was this massive pushback by Judd Apatow and Patton Oswalt's you know the great minds of our generation Judd Apatow and Patton Oswalt they they both said we're gonna pull out of this if Steve Bannon is invited to come and you know I'm gonna pull out of it too I wasn't invited but I'm gonna pull out of it too and they're gonna pull out like petulant children I think when finally the editor of The New Yorker said okay we're gonna disinvite him now okay and then they all said oh good and they said I'm so relieved I'm so relieved and of course they're relieved heaven forfend you hear a political opinion that you disagree with heaven forfend because what they're saying about Steve Bannon is that he's a Nazi and well I don't know Steve Bannon I've never met Steve Bannon some of my friends really don't like Steve Bannon I'm more than willing to take their word for it on him his interpersonal relationships the guy's not a Nazi there's no evidence that he's a Nazi there's no evidence of that but they just throw that around and they call Steve Bannon a Nazi and they call everybody else a Nazi they call Ben a Nazi they call him an Orthodox Jewish Nazi they banded us about as look Steve Bannon there are there many criticisms that one can make of Steve Bannon like for instance how he lost us a Republican seat in Alabama how do you do that but this guy is very important he was very important in the 2016 election he was a chief adviser of the President this guy could shed a lot of light on this moment in politics he is a perfect guest to headline a conference that's about ideas but they don't care about ideas they want to they want to shut out any idea that they disagree with they would be horrified they'll start shaking and crying if they hear an idea that they disagree with Malcolm Gladwell the guy who wrote those books like blink it was the other outliers he wrote these very popular books he eat tweeted about this he said quote huh call me old-fashioned but I would have thought that the point of a festival of ideas was to expose the audience to ideas if you only invite your friends over it's called a dinner party this is a very good point and they're all everyone is coming in there they're now piling on Malcolm Gladwell this is a good point it's okay ideas that you disagree with won't hurt you by the way even they say well this is racism and that's different it's it's actually not really different you should you should read ideas that are that bad you should read ideas that are that you really really disagree that you really really really disagree with it's important to do that the only reason that you wouldn't expose yourself to those ideas is because you're not confident in your own ideas because you're afraid that you'll become a Nazi if you read on a book by a Nazi know if you're if you're confident in your own ideas and you'll see why the Nazi was wrong and it will shed light on how the Nazi thinks but they don't care about any of that Chelsea Clinton tweeted IG said quote for anyone who wonders what normalization of bigotry looks like please look no further than Steve Bannon being invited by The Economist in The New Yorker to their respective events in New York a few weeks apart Chelsea Clinton daughter of Bill Clinton who recently sat on stage on a dais at a wreath of Franklin's funeral with Louis Farrakhan who regularly talks about how we've got to get rid of all those Satanic Jews who regularly in Vaes against the Jews the head of the Nation of Islam what about that bigotry she didn't tweet about that when her father was doing that did she talk about hate they talk about hate hate hate the Democrats are always projecting and so they're always projecting their own feelings onto someone else they're saying Bannon is hateful he's hateful and that's why we got to get them out and you can't speak anywhere you say who's the hateful one here who's the hateful one seems like in there a little irony here it seems like you might be the hateful one here but it's that politics that is so so despicable it's so disgusting people don't like it there are a lot of people who legitimately are liberals who were on the Left who have voted for a lot of Democrats who won't vote for it now who won't vote for Democrats now because they don't like them we don't like this chaos we like a little bit of order we like a little bit of reason we like facts and facts don't care about your feelings I mean that this is true of liberals too and those are the polls that matter I mean these are the these are the things that matter in this election we're told Trump is never ever gonna win he can't win Republicans are getting totally blown out though we're gonna they're gonna lose the Senate look at look at the polls that matter though look at what the left is doing what votes have the Republicans lost what votes did they have in 2016 that they've lost in 2018 I don't see a whole lot and and the news keeps getting better we've got to go pretty soon but the news just keeps getting better right now another news report out today Manufacturing Index is at a 14-year high it's a 14-year high we've got illegal aliens are getting off of welfare and huge numbers that it's down 20% in certain states 600,000 people off of the Dole because of President Trump actually enforcing immigration well things are going very well and the economy is going very well consumer confidence I don't know you're high at an all-time high and manufacturing this 14-year high this is really good stuff 14 18 year highs really good stuff and it's what really makes me not believe the polls and it's what really makes me not believe the new book by Bob Woodward there's a new book out by Bob board border which is saying that all of trumps staff says he's crazy and he's an idiot and he's a lunatic and he doesn't know what he's doing and it's just chaos at the White House it okay I'm I kind of like Bob Woodward he's a good journalist but what am I gonna believe am I gonna believe what I see happening in the country in the world around me or am I gonna read the gossip from X staffers that talk to Bob Woodward what am I gonna believe because all I know is that manufacturing is at a 14-year high consumer confidence 18-year high unemployment is that in some in some sectors all-time lows as stock markets at all-time highs what am I supposed to conclude from that if chaos is what leads to that bring on the chaos if crazy tweets is what leads to that bring on the crazy tweets bring it on man because I will all love the gossip and Ivanka said this and John Kelly said this and he said okay who cares I don't care about any of that I care about what's happening in the country in the world and what's happening is very good stuff and I that's what the American people care about that's why poll after poll show they don't care about the rush investigation they don't care about but Bob Muller they don't care they care about what's happening in their country economically politically and culturally but they care about what's happening in their country that they can see and and what we're seeing is good stuff so we've got to get to what this means for the elections we got to decrepit old Democrats who are declaring or all but declaring that they're gonna run for office before we do that I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube I'm sorry I don't want to do it but I have to we still have a lot to get to I want to talk about John McCain's funeral politicians politicizing the funeral I also want to explain Sarah Silverman's joke to her because she doesn't seem to understand it she tweeted at me that she doesn't she doesn't seem to understand it so I'll explain it to her before all that though you're gonna want get the leftist here's tumblr before Nikes stock falls even more because then you're not gonna be able to contain it you're not gonna be able to swim to safety if you don't have the leftist here's tumblr to contain all of that so go to daily wire.com right now get the Colin Kapernick edition believe in something even if it means drinking all the leftist tears believe and just do it just go to daily wire come just do it we'll be right back so what does this mean for politics we see the left imploding we see companies that embrace the left imploding we see all of the economic and political indicators in the country going up and up and up and up and up for Republicans so what does this mean it means and I don't want to say I don't want to jinx this by even saying it out loud it means that in 2020 the the Democrat nominee might be it might be John Kerry if my okay I'll say it I hope I didn't just jinx it for comment because John Kerry has suggested as much as he might run for comment we turn now to former Secretary of State John Kerry news and dream that's well I hope if he's elected president that he'll just news and dreamin dreamin snooze there is John Kerry Howell the third uh monkey Teresa really bring me Masha bleah really John Kerry might actually run for president he was asked about this in an interview and he said well well well monkey I'm not thinking about 2020 right now I'm just thinking about electing people in 2018 which is what people say when they're running in 2020 it does seem he's very interested in he said before that he got close enough that he should run again he didn't get close enough by the way Georgia W Bush decisively won its election against John Kerry but that is neither here nor there if only he runs President Trump says the same thing he tweeted up oh I should only be so lucky to run against John Kerry John Kerry is the most out of touch candidate second only perhaps to the other woman who is now certainly going to run for president Elizabeth alaya wathah Warren Elizabeth Warren the way we know that she's running for president now is she's sending out this PR blitz in just the last week you might have seen this the the Boston Globe ran a headline quote ethnicity not a factor in Elizabeth Warren's rise in law first of all why is that news second of all that isn't true we know that it was because she put it on her application and we know that a native of Americans have an advantage in hiring they have an ethnic advantage in hiring because of affirmative action policies so that just isn't true other stories have been planted - it wasn't a factor it wasn't a factor but it was a factor and this this woman is so unlikable she's so shrill and unlikable but the reason that that's gonna dog her the reason I think that's a fatal blow to her candidacy for president is it it just shows how utterly inauthentic she is it shows what a total fraud she is when you look at Liz Warren she is the whitest woman to ever walk the face of the earth she is she is whiter than Thurston Howell the third John Kerry I mean she is so and she cynically played on affirmative action and she's cynically playing on policies that she supports so there's even the fraud and the inauthenticity of the support for those policies because she gained the system to get an advantage the minute she could you know it's all words words words talk talk talk with her and it's so divorced from reality so I I mean if those are the two candidates I hope so if we get Kamala Harris great you know just shouting down like a deranged maniac shouting down chuck Grassley in what's supposed to be an orderly Senate hearing I hope so cory booker can't control any of his emotions cory booker tears of rage totally off the deep end this is why you'll you'll hear the left and the anti-trump right they'll say but the generic ballot we're really down on the generic ballot there is no generic Canada there's no generic race for president the closest we came was Mitt Romney and they even managed to turn him into some monstrous vicious dog abusing gay boy hair cutting criminal I don't know there is no generic candidate it's only people you only run against people sometimes the anti-trump right we'll say well Trump didn't win the election Hillary lost the election sure Hillary Hillary lost and therefore Trump won and Trump won and therefore Hillary lost you run against real people you don't presidential elections are not abstractions they're not a theory they happen in real time with real people so the question is right now and look the the 2020 nominee for the Democrats could be someone that we haven't heard from yet probably will be someone we haven't heard from yet but if it's the people we have heard from who's gonna beat Donald Trump John Kerry is John Kerry and Theresa and I really want to beat Donnie I have to beat him on down in the polls RiRi is he really gonna be Donald Trump how about Joe Biden this guy is creepy guy who's on video and undeniably on video is creeping on all these young girls smelling their hair is that guy gonna do it a guy who was run out of the presidential race thirty years ago because he's a plagiarist is that guy gonna beat him Joe Biden is with the least sincere person in America he plays an author and authentic guy on TV but he isn't one is that guy really gonna win a contest of authenticity with Donald Trump about Kamala Harris is she gonna beat him I bet Liz Warren Lyle Wafaa Foca hunt is is she gonna beat him who's gonna bat cory booker weeping tears of rage as donald trump gobbles up his leftist ears is he gonna who's gonna beat him where is he then these are all put particular races nothing is generic if we were in generic times we wouldn't have donald trump as the president we're in real particular times I've got to go pretty soon so I do want to say a few words about John McCain's funeral because that was wall-to-wall coverage for the last few days the the issue with this funeral I'll give some personal thoughts on this the issue is in 20 years everyone's gonna feel foolish about this funeral that's the really sad part because John McCain had made great sacrifices he served his country and his funeral was made small by politicians here is Barack Obama using John McCain's funeral to swipe at Trump John believed in honest argument and hearing other views he understood that if we get in the habit of bending of the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy our democracy will not work that's why I was willing to buck his own party at times occasionally work across the aisle on campaign finance reform and immigration reform that's why he championed a free and independent press as vital to our democratic debate and the fact that it some good coverage didn't hurt either you see look at what he is focusing on immigration reform the press CBC that's why McCain is good because he didn't want to enforce immigration law and he wanted to change immigration law to allow more people to come in and to give amnesty to illegal aliens here and because he was really he really liked the press notice that he's using all of these swipes at Donald Trump the reason John McCain was good to Barack Obama is because he would go against his own party you know the Republican Party that wicked party that's an office right now and he actually kind of shows his hand which is that it got him good headlines that is true it did get him good headlines by the press which is the communications wing of the Democrat Party and Barack Obama goes on John understood as JFK understood as Ronald Reagan understood that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our bloodline not on what we look like what our last name sorry it's not based on where our parents or grandparents came from or how recently they arrived but on adherence to a common creed or how recently they arrived hmm looking at you Donald mmm it's so shallow and now I I want to play Megan McCain's clip because it is being played all over the world this was the defining moment of the funeral I don't I give Megan McCain a pass because her father died so I'll preface it with that but I do want to talk about what she said because people can learn some lessons from it here's megan mccain we gather here to mourn the passing of american greatness the real thing not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served the america of john mccain is generous and welcoming and bold she is resourceful and con's secur she meets her responsibilities she speaks quietly because she is strong America does not both because she has no need to the America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great there is the line there is the line this whole final in vain against Donald Trump the the reason this was a bad idea and again I give Megan a pass because her father died but I speak a little bit from experience having eulogized to parent myself the feelings in that moment are so intense the apparent crisis the urgency the shock even you know and obviously people knew that John McCain was was going to die but that when it actually happens the the shock is so intense that it distorts your perspective and it distorts your perspective of the significance of the moment and the importance of outside circumstances to the moment and and all of those things and you really have to be careful because you you don't want to let the the craziness of the moment the shock they hurt the pain of the moment caused you to say things that are a little off tone because John McCain's life is bigger than one presidency I hope it's bigger than one presidency I hope John McCain's life doesn't just boil down to a guy who was elected president in 2016 I think it has more to it than that but by politicizing this funeral it it shrinks the life of John McCain and it politicizes it into a moment that won't really matter because the fact is we were told time and again that if Donald Trump were elected the sky would fall and it didn't fall he's been a good president the country has thrived under his leadership will it be a historic presidency perhaps it will or perhaps it won't be perhaps there'll be a bigger presidency that comes afterward and the circumstances of the daily politics are not going to matter when we think about the life of John McCain but when we look back at the funeral of John McCain it's going to be all about Trump that's a very strange thing I say this with great compassion for Megan McCain I know what it feels like but I think we can all take something from that which is that this this guy is alive John McCain's life is bigger than a than the president than the current president it's bigger than that it should be bigger than that and we should remember him for things that don't have to do with daily politics before we go I just have to make fun of serif Silverman Sarah Silverman I've been tweeting with her all morning because she doesn't understand her own joke here is Sarah Silverman's promo for her show I Love You America I will send you to hell for eternity if you murder steal do guy-on-guy but sex what what that's true you really put people in hell for eternity if they put their penis in an anus mm-hmm are you serious I cannot believe Sarah take a chill pill I'm kidding I created gay people Oh whew ah you got me you're a real son of a gun god call me oh okay oh Allah well well well hey everyone frantically typing emails about how I'm once again disrespecting the Christian God guess what mother so I tweeted to Sarah Silverman I said wow that was really funny now do it for Muslims now do that joke for Muslims and she responded sarah said ha you didn't watch the clip because at the end I'm really talking to Allah ha ha ha ha ha is it right right so I'd like to explain Sarah Silverman's joke to her there were two parts of this joke the first part opens up and you're talking to God you're not talking to Holly you're talking to God hey God and you're right and you're you're talking about the moral law and he says don't kill don't steal and don't commit sodomy and you say what that's crazy and then he's like yeah I was just kidding about that one ha ha right so that's the first joke that's a joke about Christianity then it turns at the end and he says and my name is Allah right and the second part of that joke is a joke that ostensibly you were always making a joke about the Muslim God and therefore the Christian mother effers who are frantically typing emails should stuff it that's there are two jokes one is about the moral law to God that you're talking to and the second part is a joke the object of which is the Christian people who are offended by your first joke and you say ha ha joke's on you mother effers I was really talking about the God of Islam but you weren't really talking about the God of Islam that's the that's the turn of the joke ok so the object of that joke are Christians right my challenge to Sarah Silverman is now do a joke were the object of ridicule as Muslims do that one the guys that Charlie Hebdo did that Danish cartoonists did that and they paid what they paid with their lives so you won't do that will you and as she actually responded she admitted this she said yes you're right the the object of ridicule here is the Christians and the reason I'm doing that is because America is a Christian country is mostly Christian and so I punch up I don't punch down Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the entire world this is not don't take my word for it the study and study from various centers including Pew Research and University of Notre Dame have shown this it's the most persecuted religious group in the world they're beheaded in Libya they are crucified in Syria they are mutilated in Indonesia they are the most persecuted religious group in the world most of that persecution a lot of that persecution comes at the hands of Muslim terrorists so what is punching up really mean what is punching let's see if she has the guts to do a joke the object of which is Muslims I don't think she will which is why it's why our typical boring comedy does she know that Michelle wolf got canceled by the way did someone someone should tell her before Sarah Silverman gets a rude awakening okay that's our show for today we got a lot more coming up so be sure to tune back in tomorrow because the this man that long weekend really messes you up you got
