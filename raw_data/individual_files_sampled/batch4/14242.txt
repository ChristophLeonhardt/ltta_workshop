I'm in London outside the Thames Magistrate Court were two people have today faced charges of female genital mutilation Thames Magistrate Courts today heard that a three-year-old girl required emergency surgery following what appears to have been an FGM female genital mutilation procedure section 45 I might add of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act prevents us from talking about personal details of this case names and things like that so we're gonna stick to what can be reported and indeed what is being reported so what we can say is a 42 year old man and a 36 year old woman are alleged to have mutilated a three year old girl in their own London home this Sikh crime there's been happening for quite a long time here now it's happening in the homes behind the scenes of seemingly regular people it's a really really sick crime and they're said to have rushed the girl to hospital following the alleged incident where the girl received emergency treatment for to stand bleeding is this serious issue when these girls undergo this procedure so often it involves in bleed outs people have died because of this so it was a serious rush at the hospital and when they were asked at the hospital what had happened they are said the court heard to have blamed it on a household accident one can only imagine what kind of accident that would have been now the charges let's look at the charges the woman is a dual Ugandan British national and she's charged with genital mutilation of a female but she's also charged with failing to protect a girl at risk of female genital mutilation but here's when it gets even weirder because she's also been charged with possession of extreme pornographic images that involved a human and a dog a human and a dog but it she was also by the way also charged with distributing an indecent photograph of a child and the charges remain weird when you look at the man as well he was a Ghanaian national he's been charged with FGM and also charged with failing to protect a girl at risk of FGM but he's also been charged with possession of extreme pornographic images like the woman but this time involving a human a snake and a horse these people are sick these people are sick if these crimes to be turn out to be true if these alleged crimes are true then this is sick it's hard to think of anything sicker now as I say these are only charges and it will be heard at a trial at the Old Bailey at the end of this month and I will be there and I'll be reporting on it because it's important we know about these things that happening but it's also important to know why these things matter so FGM has been illegal since 1985 for decades it's been completely illegal and yet it's been happening as we know at a massive massive scale and it's not just in pockets of this country it's happening all over the country in our capital city it's been doing being done in the homes of seemingly regular people and the NSPCC prevention of cruelty to children estimates 137 thousand women and girls are affected by a GM in England and Wales 137 thousand they're the ones they know about by the way think how often this goes unreported think how often so many girls are terrified to go to the police or talk to anybody about this happening one can only imagine the real number the real number of this happening here so the NHS is also shown is that between 2016 and 2017 five thousand three hundred and nineteen one new cases were referred to them again a female genital mutilation and despite this despite this a case like this has only gone to trial three times three times since 1985 and by the way each time no justice was served so we're gonna have to wait to see what happens now we've got to wait until the trial but I've got a few questions because if our government really cares about this shouldn't more be done if we know that hundreds of thousands of cases exist across the UK of women who've had this done to them abroad and in the UK then why haven't more come to trial and why hasn't justice been served and as far as I'm concerned and I hope you agree whether this happens on English soil whether it happens abroad this is something that our own security services and our own police should be looking at I'm extremely concerned that in this country the the treatment of young girls in this way is being completely ignored and I would like to see more money more sources poured into helping young girls and giving them the support to come forward and talk about these issues and I also want to see that when trials like this happen that justice is actually serve let's hope that that's what happens later this month but also we should be thinking about the politicians we elect and we should be thinking about the politicians who are already in Westminster why isn't enough being done and why is it when politicians come forward about the abuse of young girls they are so often slammed down as racist this is a serious problem and I hope it's solved soon so I'll check in soon we'll report on the trial and until then let's wait and see I'm Jack but be for the rebel media to follow this case and to find out what happens at the trial and for more content from me and the rest of the rebel team please be sure to LIKE and subscribe you
