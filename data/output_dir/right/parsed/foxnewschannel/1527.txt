AT ITS DISCRETION.
>>> ALSO.
BRIAN: NUCLEAR TESTS AS EARLY AS
TODAY?
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADMITS THE
HIGH-STAKES MEETING WITH KIM
JONG-UN ON THIN ICE.
AINSLEY: HERE TO WEIGH IN ON
THIS "FOX AND FRIENDS WEEKEND"
CO-HOST PETE HEGSETH.
DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAPPEN?
>> I THINK SO.
ONE OF THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADERS
PUTS IT AT 99.9.
WE'LL SEE.
THEY HAVE MORE INSIDE KNOWLEDGE
THAN WE DO.
JUNE 12th, THAT SPECIFIC
DATE IS NOT THE IMPORTANT PART.
THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE RIGHT
TERMS AND COMING TO THE TABLE
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.
KIM JONG-UN WANTS TO MAINTAIN
HIS POWER AND MAINTAIN HIS
PERSONAL SECURITY AND CHINA
WANTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR LEVERAGE
WHICH IS WHY YOU SAW THEM CHANGE
THEIR TUNE.
YOU SAW KIM JONG-UN CHANGE HIS
TUNE.
BECAUSE HE WENT AND MET WITH THE
CHINESE.
THE CHINESE SIDE WE WANT TO KEEP
OUR BARGAINING CHIPS, SO KEEP
AGITATING T KEEPS US RELEVANT.
WE CAN GET BETTER TERMS ON OTHER
ISSUES AS TRADE.
STEVE: SOUND LIKE JOHN BOLTON
FREAKED HIM OUT, KIM, THAT WE
ARE USING LIBYA AS THE MODEL.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIBYA, IN
2003, THEY GAVE AWAY THEIR NUKE
PROGRAM.
IN 2011 THAT'S WHEN ESSENTIALLY
GADHAFI WAS KILLED AND DRAGGED
THROUGH THE STREETS.
>> JOHN BOLTON WAS RIGHT AND
EXAMPLE.
MUAMMAR QADDAFI ENDED UP IN A
DITCH KNIFED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE.
BUT HE WAS CORRECT, HE GAVE UP
WEAPONS BECAUSE OF POWER
AMERICAN MILITARY.
WHAT HE SAW HAPPENED TO SADDAM
HUSSEIN IT WAS POWER AND
PRESSURE THAT CAUSED HIM TO IN
THE TABLE.
BRIAN: NOT US THAT CAUSED
INSURRECTION IN HIS OWN COUNTRY
BUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
KIM JONG-UN WANTS A PHASE-OUT OF
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
WE WANT IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF
THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND
IRREVERSIBLE.
IS THERE SOME PLAY THERE OR IS
THAT THE BIG QUESTION?
>> SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOME
PLAY THERE.
PRETTY TOUGH TO SAY WE'LL LOAD
UP ON CARGO SHIP AND TAKE IT UP
AT ONE TIME.
BRIAN: LIKE UKRAINE IN
SOUTH AFRICA.
>> MUCH MORE ROBUST IN
NORTH KOREA.
YOU CAN'T COMMIT THE SINS OF THE
IRAN DEAL.
IF ONE ADMINISTRATION
UNDERSTANDS THAT, IT IS THIS
ONE.
NO MONEY RELIEF.
NO SANCTIONS RELIEF.
WE'LL NOT PUT A SUNSET CLAUSE
AND WE'LL NOT ALLOW YOU TO DO
SOME TESTING OVER HERE AND KEEP
THE PATHWAY IS VERIFIABLE
DENUCLEARIZATION.
MAYBE THERE IS A PHASE TWO,
MAYBE THERE IS ATHEIZE THREE.
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A CARROT.
HE HAS TO HAVE REASON TO DO IT.
YOU WILL BE RICH AND POWERFUL.
YOUR PEOPLE WILL LOVE YOU, NOT
WANT TO STAB YOU IN A DITCH LIKE
MUAMMAR QADDAFI.
IT IS A DELICATE, DELICATE
BALANCE.
MAYBE PHASES.
LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL.
DON'T DO THAT.
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GOOD.
>> WHY DO YOU THINK HE AGREED TO
THIS MEETING KIM JONG-UN?
>> HE WANTS A PICTURE WITH THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
STEVE: HE IS HUNGRY.
>> THE SANCTIONS HAVING MASSIVE
EFFECT NO DOUBT.
THE CHINESE PUT THE SCREWS ON
HIM.
THE CHINESE ARE PLAYING A DOUBLE
GAME ABSOLUTELY.
THERE IS POINT WHICH THE GUY WHO
WANTS TO MEET WITH DENNIS RODMAN
AND LOVES NBA BASKETBALL AND
WESTERN POP CULTURE, PROBABLY
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE GUY WHO
MURDERS HIS PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG.
PROBABLY WANTS NORMALIZATION.
LET'S GIVE IT TO HIM.
BRIAN: HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT
MILITARY COUPE IF HE LEAVES THE
COUNTRY.
>> REMEMBER TURKEY?
HOW COULD YOU NOT BE?
STEVE: PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES MADE IT CLEAR IF HE DOES
