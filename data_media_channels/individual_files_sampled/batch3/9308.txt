PRESIDENT TRUMP RECOGNIZED THE CITY AS ISRAEL'S CAPITAL LATE LAST YEAR. STEVE? STEVE: THANKS, AINSLEY. FROM DAY ONE PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED HOPE FOR THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES. THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY WILL BE FORGOTTEN NO LONGER. EVERYONE IS LISTENING TO YOU NOW. YOU CAME BY THE TENS OF MILLIONS TO BECOME PART OF A HISTORIC MOVEMENT, THE LIKES OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. STEVE: IN THEIR BRAND NEW BOOK, THE GREAT REVOLT, INSIDE THE POPULIST COALITION. THE RISE INTO THE DONALD TRUMP AND WHY VOTERS LOVE HIM. CO-AUTHORS SELENA ZITO AND BRAD TODD JOIN US LIVE IN THE STUDIO. GOOD MORNING. STEVE: THE EXPERTS GOT THE WHOLE ELECTION WRONG IN 2016 AND THEY CONTINUE TO GET IT WRONG REGARDING WHO VOTED FOR HIM. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS THIS MOVEMENT GOING ON. AND WE'RE STILL NOT LISTENING TO WHAT IT IS SAYING TO US. AND THAT'S SORT OF THE IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BOOK. IS THAT IT TAKES READERS NOT ONLY REMINDS THEM WHO THESE VOTERS ARE AND THE DIFFERENT ARCHITECTS THAT MAKE UP THE COALITION. BUT HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD BEYOND THE BALLOT BOX. STEVE: SURE. BRAD, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP, NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHAT THE EXPERTS GOT WRONG IS THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE PEOPLE IN THE RUST BELT COUNTIES, WHO VOTED FOR BARACK OBAMA, WHY THEY WOULD EVER VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICAN DONALD TRUMP. BUT THEY DID. NO QUESTION. YOU KNOW, WHEN BILL CLINTON WON RE-ELECTION IN THE 1990s, HE WON 1500 COUNTIES. WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE SHE DID SO WINNING LESS THAN 500 COUNTIES. A LOT OF THESE PLACES IF YOU LOOK AT OHIO AND WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA ARE PLACES WHERE DOZENS OF COUNTIES FLIPPED FROM OBAMA IN 2012 TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2016. STEVE: ALL RIGHT, IN YOUR BOOK, HAVE YOU GOT DIFFERENT NAMES FOR SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. FOR INSTANCE, ROUGH REBOUNDERS, KING CYRUS EVANGELICALS. REPORTER RELIABLES. LET'S START AT THE TOP. ROUGH REBOUNDERS WHO ARE THEY? THOSE ARE THE VOTERS WHO HAVE HAD A SET BACK IN LIFE, EITHER WHETHER IT'S A TRAGEDY IN THE FAMILY, AN ECONOMIC SET BACK THAT LOST THEIR JOB, AND THOSE WERE THE VOTERS THAT WENT TO DONALD TRUMP PRETTY DARN QUICKLY. BECAUSE THEY SAW IN HIM SOMEONE WHO MADE A COME BACK. AND SOMEONE WHO WAS ABLE TO LAND ON THEIR FEET AND THEY JUST RALLIED AROUND HIM VERY QUICKLY. STEVE: KING CYRUS EVANGELICALS? A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOTED THAT EVANGELICAL SUPPORTED TRUMP. BUT THAT STARTED EVEN IN THE PRIMARIES. IT REALLY WAS A VERY PRAGMATIC VOTE. THEY DIDN'T FIND A LOT IN SORT OF PERSONAL BACKGROUND IN COMMON WITH DONALD TRUMP, BUT THEY FOUND SHARED PRIORITIES. STEVE: REPORTER STEVE: ROPORTER STEVE: ROTARTER STEVE: ROTARYER STEVE: ROTARY RELIABLES. REGULAR REPUBLICANS WHO LIVED IN SUBURBAN COUNTIES THAT IF THEY LIVED IN COUNTIES THAT WHERE EVERYONE WAS LIKE THEM. THEY HAD THE SAME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR TRUMP BUT IF THEY LIVED IN COUNTIES WHERE THERE WAS A MIXED ECONOMIC SITUATION, THEY WENT FOR TRUMP AND THEY WENT FOR TRUMP STRONG ALONG WITH THE UNCOLLEGED EDUCATED VOTERS. STEVE: THAT'S A LOOK BACK. WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IF YOU WATCH ALL THE OTHER CHANNELS, YOU KNOW THEY ARE PROBABLY RIGHT NOW DOING A BULLETIN ON STORMY DANIELS. HOW MUCH DOES STORMY DANIELS AND THAT SAGA PLAY INTO THE LOYALTY THAT THESE PEOPLE INVESTED IN DONALD TRUMP? WELL, WE DIDN'T HEAR STORIES ABOUT SCANDAL ON THE ROAD AND TALKING TO TRUMP VOTERS IN THE RUST BELT. STEVE: DO THEY CARE? THEY TEND TO THINK THIS IS ABOUT THEM NOT ABOUT THE SOAP OPERAS GOING ON IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK. IF YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS ELECTION COMING, WE HOPE THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. IF YOU DIDN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH DICK'S SPORTING GOODS AND SOME OF THE OTHER COMMERCIAL BRANDS MADE BAD DECISIONS REGARDING THIS COALITION IN THE LAST YEAR, WE THINK THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU, TOO. YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING. STEVE: YOU WATCH THE OTHER CHANNELS AND SEE PEOPLE ON THIS CHANNEL AS WELL WHO SAY LOOK, THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 2016, THEY GOT AN FUL. THEY HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE WITH HIM. THEY ARE GOING TO FLIP. DO YOU BUY THAT. I HAVEN'T SEEN WHOLESALE EVIDENCE OF THAT IF ANYTHING, I HAVE SEEN STRENGTHENING AND MORE OF A COALESCING AROUND HIM. DONALD TRUMP WAS THE RESULT OF THIS ELECTION IT WASN'T THE CAUSE. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT ACTUALLY TAKES A LOOK AT THE PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM INTO OFFICE AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO NEXT. STEVE: EXCELLENT. THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT TO KNOW. THE BOOK IS TERRIFIC.
