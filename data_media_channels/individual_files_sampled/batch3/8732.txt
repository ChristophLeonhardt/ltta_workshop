WATTERS, THIS IS "THE FIVE." A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH WITH NORTH KOREA AFTER HISTORIC MEETING INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING HE'LL SIT DOWN WITH KIM JONG-UN IN SINGAPORE. President Trump: WE'LL BE MEETING ON JUNE 12, IN SINGAPORE. I THINK IT'LL BE A PROCESS. I NEVER SAID IT GOES IN ONE MEETING. I THINK IT WILL BE A PROCESS. BUT THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILDING AND THAT'S POSITIVE. WE TALKED ABOUT ENDING THE WAR. THIS WAR HAS TO BE THE LONGEST WAR, ALMOST 70 YEARS. CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ENDING OF THE KOREAN WAR? THE ANNOUNCEMENT COMING AFTER TALKING WITH VICE CHAIRMAN KIM YONG CHOI AFTER OVER AN HOUR. PRESIDENT TRUMP SURPRISING SOME WHEN ASKED ABOUT RECEIVING A LETTER FROM KIM JONG-UN. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LETTER YET. I PURPOSELY DIDN'T OPEN THE LETTER. I HAVEN'T OPENED IT. I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN FRONT OF THE DIRECTOR. I SAID WOULD YOU WANT ME TO OPEN IT? HE SAID YOU CAN READ IT LATER. I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE, FOLKS. THE PRESIDENT HAS SINCE READ THE LETTER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A BIG SURPRISE, BUT THAT HAPPENED DURING THE DAILY BRIEFING, MY FAVORITE PART, WHEN HE MADE THAT JOKE. AN AMAZING DAY, I THINK THAT THE BIG NEWS KIMBERLY IS THAT, YES, OF COURSE THE SUMMIT IS A GO, AT LEAST TODAY, WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES NEXT WEEK. BUT ALSO, THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING FOR THIS POSSIBILITY OF SIGNING AN END TO THE KOREAN WAR. AND THE PRESIDENT INDICATING THAT THAT IS LIKELY TO BE AN OUTCOME OF THAT FIRST MEETING. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE FULL deNUCLEARIZATION THAT HE WANTS, BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE GO-TOS FOR THE SOUTH KOREANS. BY THE NORTH KOREANS AS WELL. I THINK IS HISTORIC IN TERMS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR. NO OTHER PRESIDENCY HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THE BALL SO FAR DOWN IN THE COURT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IN TERMS OF BROKERING A PEACE AGREEMENT, DENUCLEARIZATION, SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS SUMMIT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE VERY EXCITED ABOUT INTERNATIONALLY. IT BRINGS THE CHANCE AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE REGION THAT'S BEEN SO GEOPOLITICALLY FRAUGHT WITH DANGER, THE REGIME. WHAT WE SEE IS HE'S ABLE TO BRING KIM JONG-UN TO THE TABLE AND TO HIS KNEES, ESSENTIALLY. HIS ECONOMY IS ON THE BRING OF HE HAS REALLY NO CHOICE BUT TO COME TO THE TABLE. WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE WITH TARIFFS, PUTTING PRESSURE, APPLYING PRESSURE WITH THE CHINESE, WHAT HE'S DONE IN TERMS OF HIS OUTREACH AND RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA AS WELL HAS ALL PUT THIS INTO MOTION. RELATIVELY QUICK PERIOD OF TIME EARLY IN HIS PRESIDENCY. I THINK IT'S MOST YOU A SPACIOUS AND FAVORABLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND FOR NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA. YOU MEANT SANCTIONS NOT TARIFFS. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAD OVER. 00 ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS THAT HE WAS READY TO PUT ON. AND THE NORTH KOREANS KNEW ABOUT THAT, IN THE MEETING THE PRESIDENT SAID, OKAY, I WON'T DO IT. AT LEAST NOT AT THIS MOMENT. IF HE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT HE SEE WHEN IS HE OPENS THE LETTER, SLAP A FEW MORE SANCTIONS BACK ON. I WAS DOWNSTAIRS EARLIER AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE MSNBC CHANNEL, ON IT'S RIGHT UNDER ROCK CENTER, I WAS FORCED TO WATCH THEM COVER THIS YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS. WE WON'T JUDGE YOU. I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO MAKE IT CLEAR. I WASN'T WATCHING IT ON PURPOSE. HE'S TALKING ABOUT BRINGING, LIKE KIMBERLY SAID, THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER AND ENDING A WAR THAT'S GONE ON. WE'RE STILL AT WAR, TECHNICALLY, THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. AND THE ANCHORS COME OUT AND THEY CRITICIZE HIM REALLY? I SAW THAT. GOING BACK AND FORTH ON THE SINGAPORE SUM INTEREST FOR CANCELLING IT, GOING BACK, ON THEN SAYING WHAT A HYPOCRITE, HE GETS OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL, THEN WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA. I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, IF THIS WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND THIS WAS GOING ALONG THE WAY IT'S GOING ALONG UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE WOULD BE HAILED. NO KIDDING. THE GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, IT'S AMAZING THEY WOULD BRING A GUY WHO RESPONSIBLE FOR HACKING SONY, HACKING ON PEOPLE'S LIMBS, DOING SOME OF THE MOST ATROCIOUS THINGS TO HUMAN BEINGS IN THE WORLD, ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL PEEP AIM ROUND, INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, INTO THE OVAL OFFICE, NOT JUST FOR HANDING OFF. LETTER BUT THEN TO SIT AND DISCUSS THINGS, BUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE FORCED TO DEAL WITH SAVAGE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, SAYS A LOT ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO DO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE. CHINA IS AS YOU'VE BEEN SAYING, PRETTY INTEGRAL IN THIS. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SEE NORTH KOREA deFANGED. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT A CRISIS WITH MIGRANTS FLOWING ACROSS. AND LET'S JUST SAY KOREA COMES TOGETHER AS ONE, EVENTUALLY A POWERHOUSE, THEN JAPAN RIGHT THERE. AND THEIR ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE A PRETTY BOLD KIND OF WESTERN ORIENTED ALLIANCE, RIGHT ON CHINA'S DOORSTEP. THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE THAT. WE'LL JUST CONTINUE TO SEE HOW CHINA REACTS. . THE PRESIDENT SAID, MY FAVORITE LINE, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, HE WENT A LITTLE BIT MORE EMPHATIC WILL NOT BE THE ONLY MEETING, THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WHERE YOU FINISH THE WHOLE DEAL. THE OTHER THING, HE DID, I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE VIDEO, IF YOU CAN PULL IT UP, HE NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE AN HOUR-LONG MEETING BUT HE DID A PERSONAL DIPLOMACY AND WALKED THEM TO THEIR CARS. A HUGE SIGN OF RESPECT. HE TOOK THAT, LIKE SORT OF GROUP PICTURE THAT THEY COULD BE SHOWING BACK IN NORTH KOREA. WELL, TWO POINTS. ONE, HE KEPT SAYING AGAIN AND AGAIN IT'S PROCESS. THIS IS ALWAYS A PROCESS. IS A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS NOT A PROFESSOR FROM COLUMBIA. HE DOES THINGS LIKE A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS. MEANING, IT'S ABOUT RESPECT AND RECIPROCITY, SERVICING A CLIENTD. SO A CLIENT. YOU KAEFL RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR CLIENT, YOU MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD, YOU WAVE THE CARROT, YOU GOT THE STICK BUT YOU WAVE THE CARROT. THE TONE HAS TO REFLECT WIN-WIN. IT'S LIKE YOU AND YOU I ARE BOTH GOING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE CRITICAL, YOU'RE DOING A WIN HIVE WIN WITH A HEARTLESS KILLER. HE'S A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS, HE'S DEALT WITH WORSE. THE OMGSS THAT YOU HAVE, OKAY, YOU GOT TO MEET WITH DR. EVIL BUT THE OTHER OPTION IF YOU DON'T, THAT MEANS WAR OR STARVATION F YOU'RE AGAINST THIS MEETING, THEN ARE YOU SAYING MAYBE WE STARVE THESE PEOPLE TO DEATH, 25 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGH SANCTIONS AND WHAT NOT. IF YOU ACTUALLY TRY SOMETHING NEW. THAT'S WHY THIS IS A BREAKTHROUGH, WAS YOU HAVE A DEVELOPER FROM QUEENS WHO SAID WHY NOT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. AND EVERYBODY WHO IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT THAT MIGHT WANT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CRITICISM TODAY. ESPECIALLY TODAY OF ALL DAYS WHERE IT WAS ALL OF THE DIPLOMACY IN ONE, BUT, GERALDO, YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE FROM HAVING KWOVERD THE CONFLICT IN KOREA OVER THE YEARS AND YOU SAID WERE YOU THERE IN IN THE '80s, A COUPLE OF TIMES. TO JESSE'S POINT, YOU MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR ENEMIES, YOU DON'T MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR FRIENDS. YOU HOLD YOUR NOSE AND YOU GO IN THERE AND YOU KNOW, PLENTY OF, IN WAR TIME, PLENTY OF, YOU KNOW, CRIMINAL ALLEGATIONS TO GO AROUND. BUT WATCHING DANA'S EXCELLENT PROGRAM AT 2:00, THAT LINE REALLY STUCK IN MY HEAD, CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENDING THE KOREAN WAR. CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENDING THE KOREAN WAR. deNUCLEARIZATION, ALL OF THIS, THE NUANCE HOW MANY PEOPLE IN AMERICA, IT'S BEEN A PART OF THAT. SERVED IN KOREA, BEEN AT THE DMZ, I MEAN VIRTUALLY EVERYONE. SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS. WHAT IF THEY UNITE THEY WON'T. I WAS SAYING, ARE SAYING WHAT A GREAT THING IT IS TO TALK B BUT SAY IT WON'T HAPPEN. TALK ABOUT UNIFICATION, I'M TALKING ABOUT A PEACE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED NATIONS. DON'T GO NUCLEAR. I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. WHERE IS THE EXAMPLE OF THAT TODAY. THE SIN TRIF GAL FORCE KEEPS COMPANIES SEPARATE. THEY'RE UNITED, THEIR ECONOMIES MIGHT BE MUCH MORE IN SYNC. SECTARIAN DICTATORSHIP, PEOPLE GET CELL PHONES, AS THEY GET THE SATELLITE TV, I THINK IT WILL HAVE A MODIFYING EFFECT ON THE COUNTRY. BUT, I MEAN, TO ME RECORD LOW, UNEMPLOYMENT FOR BLACK PEOPLE FOR HISPANIC, WOMEN. THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. THE WAY HE APPLIES PRESSURE ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT FRONTS. TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM TO COME TO THE TABLE TO SUPPORT IT. THEY SUPPORT THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME. OTHERWISE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED. THEY ARE ON THEIR KNEES, STARVATION NATION, AND KIM LAST YEAR MADE A PROMISE TO HIS PEOPLE AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU OUT OF THE DESPICABLE HOLE YOU'RE IN. I PROMISE GROWTH, BETTER LIFESTYLE, STANDARD OF LIVING. HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER. SINCE HE MADE THAT PROM WIS THE SANCTIONS, THINGS OF GOTTEN WORSE. HE IS DIEING TO BRING HIS COUNTRY INTO THE 21st CENTURY. HE SEES THE PATHWAY FORWARD WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN WORK OUT A SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN HAVE THE SANCTIONS EASED OFF, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW THEY RAMP DOWN. nd HE TOLD THE PRESS TO PACK THEIR BAGS, THEY'RE GOING TO SINGAPORE. I WAS GOING TO SAY NOBEL PEACE PRIZE? I WAS GOING TO SAY YOU CAN START BY SURPLUS FOOD AS A GESTURE OF GOODWILL. ALSO INFORMATION. ONE WEEK SUPPLY OF GRAIN. INFORMATION AND INTERNET ACCESS. BUT ALSO YOU HAVE TO STOP SAYING THEY'RE ON THEIR KNEES. BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS, IS PRIDE AND RESPECT. AND WHEN YOU SERVICE A CLIENTD YOU DON'T SAY WE'VE GOT THEM WHERE WE WANT THEM. THAT'S WHY HE WALKED THEM TO THE CAR, DID THE GENEROUS VERY RESPECTFUL. A SUBTLE SHIFT THAT A SALESMAN KNOWS, GET THEM INSIDE.
