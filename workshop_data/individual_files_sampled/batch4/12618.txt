as news broke of the WikiLeaks release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails demonstrating DNC coordination with the media and the Hillary Clinton campaign to help sink the candidacy of Bernie Sanders the media began spinning this was all the work of the nefarious Russians working to get Donald Trump elected representative Adam Schiff Democrat in California he's the ranking member of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence he said quote given Donald Trump's well-known and admiration for Putin and his belittling of NATO the Russians have both the means and the motive to engage in a hack of the DNC and the dump of it emails prior to the Democratic convention unquote apparently Yvan Drago is sitting somewhere behind a computer muttering if she dies she dies except that two things can be true at once the DNC can be a deeply corrupt pro-hillary super PAC and the Russians can actually be something for Trump according to Eli Lake of Bloomberg quote many cybersecurity experts as well as the Hillary Clinton campaign are now saying the Russians are responsible for last month's hack of the DNC here's the New York Times quote researchers have concluded that the National Committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyber operations at the White House the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year so here was Trump's response to these reports via Twitter quote the new joke in town is that Russia leaks that is a stressed DNC emails which should never have been written stupid because Putin likes me well Putin does like him and from sort of likes Putin essentially the only major platform change at the Republican National Convention involved the Trump team tearing out a section endorsing giving the Ukrainians weapons they needed to defend themselves from Russian invasion the original amendment said quote today the post Cold War ideal of a Europe whole and free is being severely tested by Russia's ongoing military aggression in Ukraine the Ukrainian people deserve our admiration and support in their struggle unquote the Trump people had the amendment tabled and then they amended it from providing lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine to quote providing appropriate assistance then there's the cozy relationship between the Trump campaign manager a guy named Paul Manafort and the Russians manna fort worked as a lobbyist for former Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych for over a decade Yanukovych was of course working closely with Vladimir Putin and last week if you remember from said openly he might allow Russia to overrun eight-oh countries in the Baltics so all it took for Democrats to worry about the Russians was their hacks doing political harm to democratic god queen Hillary Clinton the Democrats didn't care when Hillary put her emails on unsecured servers exposing classified material to prying eyes they openly mocked Mitt Romney when he said the Russians provided the greatest geopolitical threat to America and they didn't care when Putin took over Syrian policy and invaded Ukraine but when it comes to Hillary by god this madness must end it won't though the chickens may come home to roost if the Russians did indeed hack Hillary server and she's got to be up nights thinking about the possibility that Putin dumbs her destroyed emails publicly one week before the election all of which would be politically delicious but remember this is an election in which there are no good outcomes the same Putin currently slapping Hillary through WikiLeaks apparently wants Donald Trump president for a reason oh boy I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you're feeling okay so here we are and again welcome to our friends on Facebook live we will be going about 15 minutes here and then we will be and then we'll be moving over to Daily wire.com tons to get to today we're going to start obviously with the dumpster fire that is now raging out of control at the DNC see last week you thought the RNC was crazy so the Democrats had anything you can do we can do worse so they decided to come along and do their own version of this and it is hi freaking hilarious it's really really funny guys it's it's hilarious okay so let's start with this if you recall just a few months ago debbie Wasserman Schultz right the head of the Democratic National Committee then she was accused by the Bernie Sanders campaign of basically rigging the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton and she said no this is nonsense no one would ever do anything like this clip 25 here's flashback Debbie wasserman-schultz to the skeptics who say that the super-delegates are really just there to make sure that you know the party gets through the party once and the party wants Hillary Clinton what do you say to them we've had on pledged delegates since 1984 and there is one time that we've had our nominee be elected by anything other than the budget challenges conspiracy theories are just bad conspiracy theories are just that except when they're really out to get you because it turns out now the russians hacked the Democratic National Committee and there are at least 20,000 emails basically showing that the DNC wanted Hillary all along which is not that crazy because bernie sanders is a wild man but it does show that this thing was rigged and that was Bernie's original accusation so now all of this stuff comes out and that's when it gets super fun because the Bernie Sanders supporters are not taking this lying down I mean they should have just passed out some weeds of the Bernie Sanders supporter and told him to go home but instead they decided that they would have them there and things got really crazy so it's really funny here is debbie Wasserman Schultz this morning charged our banks this morning speaking to a crowd and it did not go the way that the jar-jar wanted it Missa chyron on MSNBC Wasserman Schultz receives cheers at Florida delegation breakfast does this sound like sharing tea gang she's being booed off the stage I mean she legitimately has to leave like right after this she leaves I love when she says can we just calm down let's all just let's all just get it under control okay schoolmarm well how are you get it under control considering you're the one whose charge was not to rig this thing and you rigged this thing so things get even more awkward from there because this is great I mean honestly look if we're gonna hit the end of the world in this election we might as well have some fun doing it gang and this is the fun part people keep saying I say to myself I can't wait for this terrible election cycle be over and then I realized that one of these two people will be President and I go uh-huh so this is actually the fun part so you might as well have some fun so Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders yeah he sees all of this and he sees all the emails come out every Wasserman Schultz has now resigned right she's now she's now dropped her job this is my favorite thing about it she leaves the person who replaces her is Donna Brazile Donna Brazile is also a member of Hillary Clinton's kind of inner cabinet so that really didn't do anything and here's the best part debbie Wasserman Schultz just a moment ago she was she was saying she wanted the gavel in the convention and then she realized that she would basically be booed all the way through so she said I'm not gonna gavel it it anymore the person who replaces her is Stephanie rawlings-blake if you remember that name that's because she's the mayor of Baltimore who said that when there were riots in her city she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy she's the one gaveling in the convention pretty amazing stuff so Bernie Sanders you know first he said yesterday he said debbie Wasserman Schultz should resign I asked and demanded debbie Wasserman Schultz's resignation many many months ago and I state that again I don't think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails which reveal the prejudice of the DNC but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people in young people and I don't think hard leadership style is doing that okay and then Donna Brazile comes out and she says well debbie Wasserman Schultz has to leave she has to leave first of all as vice-chair I went over yesterday to see the Sanders campaign and I apologize I think the allegations the emails the insensitivity the stupidity needs to be addressed and we are going to address so what does that mean it means that this is this first of all this is this is not just a one-day leak there will be a substantial number of emails that I understand that will be leaked over the next couple of days weeks months because it was not a one-month breach or two-month breach come to find out the the Russian hackers and I have no conspiracy theories in my hands I don't know baby boobs that's how they've been involved they were in our system at the DNC for well over a year so we will learn more will some people have to step down be removed resign I'm sure at the end of the day yes okay this is pretty spectacular stuff she says that debbie Wasserman Schultz must step down then of course who replaces w Wasserman Schultz that lady right only one problem here's some stuff from the WikiLeaks emails about Donna Brazile so it says this is from Donna Brazile to the DNC quote I have no intention of touching this this is was this is a question from the Washington Post hi Donna do you have a minute to chat today wanted to ask you about this fight between the Sanders camp and DNC over adequate representation on the platform committee and others ahead of the convention and then Tana Brasil writes back I have no intention of touching this why because I will cut out the Sanders camp that lady is the new head of the DNC right being taking over for the lady who was just a stood there's another one - here's another WikiLeaks email here's Donna Brazile to the DNC okay so originally she was written Donna I wanted to make sure you saw the statement yesterday on the Sanders endorsement she said I saw at this am how stupid don't know how to respond to Bernie anymore that's the lady who's taking over the DNC so she can play honest broker with the Bernie Sanders supporters but don't worry going it gets even better it's awesome so here's the next thing right so Hillary Clinton comes out and she has to make a statement now on Debbie Herman Schultz resigning because she had rigged this whole system so this is it I love this so much it makes me so happy so here here's her statement quote I want to thank my longtime friend Debbie wasserman-schultz for her leadership of the Democratic National Committee and her service on the intergalactic Council no no no just over the past five years I'm grateful to Debbie for getting the democratic party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia I know this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership there's simply no one better at taking the fight to the Republicans than Debbie which is why I am glad she has agreed to serve as honorary chair of my campaigns 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country and will continue to serve as a surrogate for my campaign nationally in Florida and in other key states I look forward to campaigning with Debbie in Florida and helping in her re-election bid okay so here's how this works Debbie wasserman-schultz is at the DNC rigged the election for Hillary Clinton right put her thumb on the scale for Hillary she leaves Hillary hiders her hey that's how this works and she's right now Hillary right now is trying to consolidate the party around around herself right and she wants Bernie Sanders to jump on board chucked out over at NBC News he says oh my god this is insane this is really not particularly smart well very interesting decision though by the Clinton campaign to essentially employ her because then that is only going to make some Sanders people go AHA this is her she owes Debbie something and that's why they it's an interesting decision it may only feed some conspiracy theories anyway okay yeah you think yeah think maybe because that's true because it was Debbie's a loyal gal and she's running the DNC and she's ensuring that I take the crown first of all it's it is pretty amazing that Hillary felt the necessity to use the DNC to cram herself down over-over Bernie Sanders I mean Bernie Sanders is a 74 year old nutbag socialist and she still can't put him away she has to do Watergate style stuff where she's using the DNC to target her political opposition it's pretty incredible here's the bet we haven't gotten the best parking really like it's so good okay so Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton is on 60 minutes and she's asked about this email scandal about the DNC email scandal now understand 60 minutes notice this little icon in the corner says 60 minutes overtime so on 60 minutes that asked a bunch of questions she's sitting next to Tim Kaine her boring vanilla vice presidential pick you can't separate Tim acquainted sim cane from legitimately another white man above the age of 50 walking around in America and they're sitting together talking and they don't make any news there's only one piece of news what she has to say about the email scandal right 60-minute slices it out and puts it online right they don't broadcast it they put it 60 minutes overtime so they put it on their web site because Scott Pelley and CBS News are a disgrace so here's Scott Pelley asking Hillary Clinton about the email scandal from the DNC and they seem to have their thumb on the scale for you they seem to be working against Bernie Sanders their fellow Democrat again I don't know anything I don't know anything about about these emails I haven't followed it but I'm very proud of the campaign that I ran and I'm very proud of the campaign that senator Sanders ran in your view any effort in the DNC to favor one candidate or another would have been improper again I don't have I don't have any information about this and so I can't answer specifically we ran our campaign we ran hard we worked to have as many successes as possible I'm very proud that we got more votes than anybody else running including Donald Trump and I am very grateful for the campaign that senator Sanders ran because we ran a campaign based on issues not insults so I can't speak to what people who were not working for me who were saying whatever they were saying I can't spent to that I can't speak to my campaign they are working for you now right there in jolt is working for you all corrupt lady come on really really okay so I love that I love yes sir yes sir straight out would it be corrupt maybe if you were to if you were to do this routine if if there is a thumb on the scale would that be corrupt and she goes I don't know anything about corrupt I don't know anything about the DNC I don't know what are you speaking of Who am I why am I here where did I get this pantsuit did I get this patent suit from Violet Beauregarde where is it from so it's it's just amazing okay so here's the punchline so all of this happens now Bernie Sanders is in the world most awkward position Bernie Sanders is supposed to endorse her today he's giving a big keynote speech tonight so he's addressing supporters before the big keynote speech tonight and Bernie Sanders doesn't have it in him to do the Ted Cruz routine he's not gonna get up there and not endorse Hillary Clinton so he tries it out this morning D and he's already endorsed her the endorsement of Hillary Clinton and it goes extremely poorly this clip 26 this just happened like literally a few minutes ago and we have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine I love it's a and he's just standing there with his arm up in the air doesn't know what to do he doesn't know where he is he's just I do not know why I am here why I am endorsing this old terrible woman but since I must do that and I like the beach ball in the front like there just it's just a party for the Bernie Bros they're just beating around the beach ball and booing him when he says endorse Hillary Clinton Oh spectacular spectacular stuff so it's this is the beauty okay so the Democratic Party is falling apart so right now in the polls Donald Trump is now ahead he's jumped into a lead in most of the polls there been like four polls since the convention on average he's up about three points he actually had a significant bump and we'll talk about that the bump in a little while because it really does speak to both Hillary and Trump but it's it is amazing that one of one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton is falling apart is because she's so wildly incompetent everyone hates her she's so corrupt and it would just be wouldn't it just be poetic justice if she set up this private email server to protect herself in public scrutiny and then the Russians hacked it and then the Russians dumped all of her deleted emails on the public two weeks before the election would that just be deliver forget about Trump versus Hillary for a second just in terms of Hillary wouldn't it be amazing delicious wonderful poetic justice and wouldn't it be just the custard pie of poetic justice if that were to happen oh it would be so glorious and in every way it would be just fantastic well this brings us the end unfortunately of our livestream but we have so much more to cover here on the bench Shapiro shall go to Daily wired.com to see the rest or you can download it later from SoundCloud or iTunes we are the number one conservative podcast in America so thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time if you're on the live stream otherwise you're listening we're gonna keep going right now okay so now that we've caught the way if we can continue so here is the so okay so a couple of things we'll get into the Trump polling in one second but Hillary is so wildly incompetent and Tim Kaine they're now trying to now now we've got the whole Kevin Bacon in Animal House situation going right we've got that like everything's on fire people are running around behind Kevin Bacon he's going everything is fine stay calm here's Tim Kaine doing the Kevin Bacon routine from Animal House I was a DNC chair so you know I bet during the first Obama term you're not gonna find anybody at the DNC or the RNC or any political organization who is a complete agnostic who doesn't have an opinion about a candidate I mean those of us who are kind of in the realm we got opinions about people so but there's a difference between having an opinion about somebody having a candidate that you prefer over somebody else there's a difference between that and trying to alter the outcome okay that's pretty spectacular so he says there's a difference between just endorsing Hillary and trying to alter huh except if you actually read the emails which make clear they are trying to alter the outcome trotting out particular narratives in favor of Hillary Clinton and I mean how much of a sad sack does Tim Kaine look like in this particular freeze-frame I mean he's just sitting there and Hillary Clinton is sitting there going like oh you're my little stepping stool aren't you Tim Kaine you shall bring me power and he's sitting like oh my god my life that's at all these VP candidates do now that's all they do they sit there in the Mike Pence Tim Kaine they probably go somewhere after the after these conventions are over and just drink heavily they are God can you believe what I made of my alive that's that's where it isn't okay fine so Hillary is terrible at everything and this just demonstrates again she's an EXO nyan figure a deeply NIC Sounion figure hiring debbie Wasserman Schultz the whole thing is in disarray it's all falling apart so what do the Democrats do one of the Democrats do they blame the Russians so here is the Democratic national conventions Robby Mook he's the campaign manager for Hillary for America and now he's gonna blame the Russians experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC stole these emails and other experts are now saying that they are the Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of actually helping Donald Trump I don't think it's coincidental that these emails were released on the eve of our convention here and and that's disturbing and I think we need to be concerned about that I think we need to be concerned that we also saw last week at the Republican convention that Trump and his allies made changes to the Republican platform to make it more pro-russian and and we saw him talking about how NATO shouldn't intervene to defend necessarily should intervene to defend our Eastern European allies if they're attacked by Russia so I think when you put all this together it's a it's a disturbing picture and I think voters need to reflect on that so I'll get to the disturbing picture in just a second because the truth is what he's saying is not wholly untrue I mean the fact is that Trump as I said at the top is very connected with the Russians and the Russians are clearly doing things to his benefit right I mean and and that's what presumably scares Hillary is that at night she's waking up in a cold sweat thinking that all her emails her intimate emails with whom are gonna be released two weeks before the election five Vladimir Putin by the way we're now learning apparently they're saying that the Russians actually dumped fake emails into this whole WikiLeaks thing so we know it's real what's fake anymore so it's totally this is wild stuff it's really wild stuff now all of this wouldn't make much of a difference if Hillary were even mildly competent Hillary is deeply incompetent so as I mentioned the polls have Trump jumping about 6 points they also show that 68% of Americans think Hillary is not honest and not trustworthy which leads to the question to the other 32 percent of Americans where they dropped on their heads as children because clearly she's not honest and she's not trustworthy but more than that she is utterly tone-deaf she is super tone deaf so I think there are a few reasons why Trump has got a big bump from the convention I think the primary reason that Trump got a big bump from the convention is because Hillary is so tone deaf so Trump gives this big speech last Thursday we know a chance to talk about it cuz we don't have a Friday show this will be rectified soon by the way but the the we didn't get a chance to talk about it my take on Trump's speech text was that it was very good I said this online I didn't like his delivery I thought he yelled his way through it but the text was effective and his approach was effective so the entire media went nuts it's dark it's deep it's dank it's dark he's saying America is a terrible place ow God okay see here's the thing most Americans think America is on the wrong track when Trump says we have a crime problem most Americans go yep particularly when they're seeing cops shot in major cities across the United States when Trump says we have an Isis problem most of Americans go yeah yeah that's true see that when people say when when he says our economy is not booming most Americans go yeah yeah I'm with you there Hillary comes out and Hillary does this routine where she acts like everything is hunky-dory because she can't run away from Obama's record because she's running on his record so it puts her in a really awkward position 7 out of 10 Americans believe this is this is why Barack Obama has really taken the heart out of the Democratic Party on the local and state level most of most Americans still like Obama they just think he's a crappy president so he has a 56% approval rating but it's like 70% of Americans think the country is moving in the wrong direction how do you reconcile those two people like Obama personally but they think he's really not a very good president they're not a very effective president in any case Hillary makes a bunch of mistakes over the weekends instead of her saying all of the concerns that Donald Trump expressed are real and true here are the better solutions instead of doing that she does the know he's slandering America everything is great most Americans don't think things were great most Americans don't think things are great she's tone-deaf so she doesn't say that and then she's she's supremely tone-deaf and just on a variety of issues Hillary Clinton is incredibly tone-deaf she's she's tone-deaf when it comes to crime I mean that the black lives matter movement is leading this convention like really leaving this convention we mentioned last week there I think six or seven mothers of women who are associated with black lives matter or men associate black lives matter to their mothers are speaking at this convention which is pretty amazing picking Tim Kaine didn't do her any favors no one knows who the guy is it's not spicy it doesn't change the narrative and then she did this she played the victim over the weekend so here was Hillary Clinton over the weekend and she says these sorts of things and you have to say to yourself does she own a mirror there's been a concerted effort to convince people like that young man of something nobody's quite sure what but of something I often feel like there's the Hillary standard and then there's the standard for everybody else look at Hillary stir well it is you know a lot of as you saw at the Republican convention unfounded inaccurate mean-spirited attacks with no basis in truth reality which take on a life of their own and for whatever reasons and I don't want to try to analyze the reasons I see it I understand it people are very willing to say things about me to make actors in me that are I don't get upset about them anymore but they they are very regrettable why do you put yourself through it because I really believe in this country and boy do I believe in it now more than ever after seeing what was presented last week I believe that we are better than what we are hearing in the political discourse I believe we can work together okay so she's terrible to Scott Pelley I why do you put yourself through it Hilary why do you sacrifice for the people so should we just make you a saint now I mean like you've done so many miracles in your lifetime like dad and also that thing one time you're the best why do you do it why are you so wonderful I love you Hillary it is ridiculous but but the point that she's making I love that she says there's a double standard there's Clinton corruption and everybody else is right your kind of corruption will put anybody else in jail again the idea that Hillary Clinton is sitting there telling us that she's somehow being held to a different standard she is it is a lower standard so that's that says she's tone-deaf I mean playing herself as the victim is ridiculous brushing off the DN scant and DNC scandals we mentioned is absolutely asinine blaming the Russians it looks weak I mean it's true the Russians did this but it looks like Peron it looks paranoid and it looks like blame-shifting it's it's not the central issue the central issue isn't where the emails came from the central issue is the content of the emails obviously plus everybody hates her everybody think she's awful even Barack Obama who's out there stumping for Hillary Clinton today he thinks Hillary is just deadly dull and he basically said that the other day is 11 and what I would say would be that this is somebody who knows as much about domestic and foreign policy as anybody is tough-as-nails is motivated by what's best for America and ordinary people understands that in this democracy that we have things don't always happen as fast as we'd like and it requires compromise and grinding it out she's not always flashing and there are better speech makers but she knows her stuff like that she's not very flashy and she's a pretty crappy speech maker but could he wait any longer before he gets to the punchline hey you know bomb against gender nobody can stand her because Hillary's terrible so that's why Hillary is dropping like a stone in these polls Trump looks like he gets the American people better than she does because he at least is willing to call out the problems as I've been saying for weeks Trump is great at Diagnostics and he's terrible at prognosis so when he's the kind of guy who rightly identifies that you cancer and then he suggests that the cure for cancers to stick your head below the back tire of a Ford Explorer right so it's not like his solutions are bad but at least the diagnosis is good Hillary doesn't even bother with it with the diagnosis you come in with a giant tumor coming off the side of your head and you know you're fine you're fine don't worry about it everything's cool I got this I mean it is so nobody trusts her nobody trusts her okay so all of that said the Democrats are just falling apart there are major divisions inside the Democratic Party on the right side of the aisle there's a major consolidation and you're seeing it in the reaction what Ted Cruz did last week's new CNN poll and it shows the Cruz's favorability among Republicans has dropped from 60% to 33% in one week and that was largely because of the setup that we discussed last Thursday the kind of set up situation that Trump created where Cruz made a deal with him and then Trump stabbed him directly in the kidney because he figured okay I can I can take care of this guy once and for all and Trump is a revenge politician it's all he cares about in life is revenge we'll get to that in just a second but it shows that right now Republicans are desperate desperate to come around from they're desperate to to come around Trump so before we even get to that it's time for a little bit unfortunately of bad Trump so the fact is that Trump right now should be leading by ten I mean with all this chaos in the Democratic Party he should be up big he's already up a little which is which is good for Trump obviously but here are some of the things that Donald Trump said over the weekend so Donald Trump was asked about David Duke David Duke is now running for Senate in Louisiana okay and this is gonna put the would to some of the people who I've been talking to who keep saying well I'll vote for anybody as long as they're not a Democrat okay well what if it's David Duke I mean I said this to someone I greatly I said this is Dennis Prager on the air I said to Dennis Prager you know where would you draw the line he said he said give me an example I said like David Duke would probably be better than the Democrat in the Senate he couldn't really do anything about his racism and he might vote the right way on justices and then I said that would be a bridge too far for me well now David dukes actually running for the Senate so we're gonna find out whether this is true or not Chuck Todd asks Donald Trump about David Duke and as you recall Donald Trump months ago he pretended he didn't know who David Duke was in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper here is Donald Trump being asked about David Duke running for Senate by Chuck Todd David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own or essentially saying glad that you spoke out are you ready before you ask the question Newt Gingrich said every Republican should repudiate this guy don't know what it takes they do are you ready I would support a Democrat over David Duke if it was what was necessary to defeat him I guess depending on who the Democrat but the answer would be yes look the answer is as quick as you can say it I fact I want to answer answer you before you throw me his last time with another person in your position I did it very quickly and they said he didn't do it fast enough rebuked is that okay rebuke review done done okay so notice that Trump isn't doing this on principle he's doing it because last time he got caught out on it but I do love that even there he says it depends on who the Democrat which is pretty amazing but in any case they said Trump does this and that's that's not bad Trump that's just that's just Trump here is it and now he gets it to some other to some other drum so Trump was asked about the the Muslim ban yeah the idea of banning Muslims from the country now there is nothing unconstitutional by the way about religious discrimination against foreigners really there isn't it the Constitution doesn't apply to foreigners so it's very difficult to make the case on a constitutional and then not right or wrong this is a constitution question a legal question even leftist scholars will acknowledge the Constitution basically has nothing to say about whether a certain group of people are barred from entering the country or not as long as they're not citizens but here is Trump talking about the Constitution and in Islam I'm looking now at artists people so upset when I use the word Muslim all you can't use the word Muslim remember this and I'm okay with that because I'm talking territory instead of Muslim but just remember this our Constitution is great but it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide okay now we have a religious you know what everybody wants to be protected and that's great and that's the wonderful part of our constitution I view it differently why are we committing suicide why are we doing it you know what I live with our Constitution I love our Constitution I cherish our Constitution we're making it territorial we have Nations and we'll come out I'm gonna be coming out over the next few weeks with a number of the places that it's very complex Wow I don't know what he's talking about but his take on the Constitution is so ridiculous there that just he doesn't know the first thing about the Constitution first of all the Constitution as I say applies to domestic citizens that's all he has to say right if he really believes in the Muslim ban that he's that he's been espousing for months but for him to imply that the Constitution of the United States is some sort of suicide pact the last person who said that was Lincoln and he was suspending the writ of habeas corpus at the time and we were in the middle of a civil war I don't think that that's the case right now Trump has also been reaching out heavily to Bernie Sanders he says that the Tim Kaine pick was a slap in the face to Sanders supporters this is actually this is this is good Trump okay so here's it's time for a little bit good Trump so here's a little bit of good Trump so it's it's politically clever I don't particularly like that Sanders supporters are gonna come to to Trump because I think that Sanders supporters are on the left I think Trump is also on the left but here is is Bern here's Trump making what is a pretty smart play for Bernie Sanders supporters who as you saw are now booing the idea of voting for Hillary Clinton I'm not a fan of Bernie Sanders but I am a fan of one thing that he talks about he's the only one on that side that understands straight now he can't do anything about it because that's not his thing but he has been gamed he has been it's a rigged system against him and what happened with the choice of Tim Kaine was a slap in the face to Bernie Sanders and everybody I was shocked okay so this is this is actually smart by Trump okay so also even the stuff I don't like here the stuff I was mentioning before it's not bad okay that isn't the bad stuff the bad stuff about Trump is that Trump is crazy okay the bad stuff about Trump we didn't talk about this on Friday because we weren't here on Friday the day after I mean it was maddening if you're a Trump fan it should be maddening to you the day after Trump gives a very highly successful speech he then spends the next morning he's trying to thank his supporters right he comes in to thank his supporters and instead of thanking his supporters he decides that what would really be important is to go after Ted Cruz again very important to go after Ted Cruz again so first he starts by attacking Ted Cruz's father right he says it is 19a he goes after Ted Cruz's dad all I did is point out the fact that on the cover of The National Enquirer there's a picture of hurt him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast now Ted never denied that it was his father instead he said Donald Trump I had nothing to do with it okay and so he attacks again he goes back to this whole Ted Cruz's dad assassinated JFK thing we didn't stop there he also decided it was important to rehash the Heidi Cruz thing you remember he called Heidi Cruz ugly basically when I saw somebody tweeted a picture of Melania and a picture of Heidi who I think by the way is a very nice woman and a very beautiful woman I have to tell you I think Heidi Cruz is a great person I think it's the best thing he's got going and his kids if you want to know the truth oh he's lying right meaning that's how what he did he tweeted a picture of her basically saying that she was ugly and then he didn't stop there he said he doesn't want Ted Cruz's endorsement under any circumstances I like Ted he's fine again I don't want his endorsement if he gives it I will not accept it just so you understood if it goes I will not accept it won't matter honestly he should have done it because nobody cares and he would have been in better shape for four years from now if he's gonna be I don't think I don't see him winning anyway frankly okay so he goes after Ted Cruz again because that's what he does right so this is the day after his big speech that was supposed to bring the Republican Party together and everybody was getting around him right the day after he does this and that's not all over the weekend he says he's going to fund a super PAC a super PAC against Ted Cruz and John Kasich for not supporting him he can try and primary a couple of Republicans for not supporting him so he's got all this money and instead of spending it against Democrats he's gonna spend it against the guy who tried to kill Obamacare and the sitting Republican Governor of Ohio who's help he needs to win the state his genius stuff here's him talking about starting his new super back are you really going to fund a super PAC to help defeat well it's not until never one thing on my mind look at what's on my mind is beating Hillary Clinton what's on my mind is winning for the Republican Party with that being said yeah I'll probably do a super PAC and you know when they run against Kasich okay for 10 to 20 million dollars all right against Ted Cruz and maybe one other person that I'm thinking about the other person he's thinking about is Ben Sasse is the senator from Nebraska who's had the temerity to say that Trump is a dumpster fire so all of that is a Trump instead of uniting the party on the Democratic side you can see they're tearing themselves apart on the Republican side even people like me I mean we're getting heavy pressure to jump in the Trump camp right one of the things the one of the reasons that I'm not jumping on the Trump train is because of stuff like this you've got the entire Republican Party saying you got to jump on the Trump train even as he moves to rip away any semblance of decency from the Republican Party he got Scott Walker out there saying yeah we're uniting around Trump were coming around from this the governor of wisconsin saying just that there's an increasing sense of unity around Donald Trump his I point I joke you know Donald Trump wasn't my first pick I was my first pick with that but but I said what is their first your second your seventeenth it should matter here in Cleveland the back last August I said that any Republican running would be better than Hillary Clinton I meant that then I meet it down I think for most of us as delegates whether Donald Trump was your absolute first pick or it was further down the line the delegates here realized that it's either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton there's no other choice and Hillary Clinton would be an abysmal abysmal failure okay so if you want to make the argument and I haven't seen this argument all over we can talk about it for weeks the Trump will be better than Hillary back Trump fine that's your argument I may disagree in the long term that one of the reasons I disagree in the long term is because I think that a victorious Trump would rip away any semblance of conservatism and decency from the Republican Party really I think that's what would happen that doesn't mean I want Hillary president I want them both to be put in a rowboat and pushed far offshore but if Trump is gonna do damage he's gonna do some serious damage and the reason I say that is because after Trump does his little routine after Trump does his little I'm gonna fund a super PAC to pose Republicans Ted Cruz's dad murdered JFK routine after he did that little routine the head of the RNC Reince Priebus who's just a little pansy Reince Priebus comes out and he says well you know there's nothing really wrong with that he's doing this profit in the world of cable news if you're dividing you're making one anytime you see a split screen it's you know one person saying X the other ones saying Y now you fight about it for the next six minutes there is no money in in in unity and so it is a profit Center to divide people to divide politics to divide parties and that's what you see on television okay and he then comes out Reince Priebus and he says quite openly and try and find the direct quote here he says quote he's got a right to talk about whatever he wants to talk about however I don't think he was ever saying this was some sort of factual information this is about the Ted Cruz's dad killing JFK routine it was something he referred to he's talked about it he's gotten off from it as far as I'm concerned we can move on from it okay I've seen people that I respect people I work with do the same thing about this oh well no big deal the same people who spent years years yelling about how it was a lie the Bush leiden people died are now justifying Donald Trump saying the same thing truth is no longer a right-wing value truth is a conservative value but it is not a right-wing value okay because what's happening now is that the Republican Party's actually doing a better job of unifying around Donald Trump and then backing his lies then the Democratic Party is around Hillary Clinton and backing her corruption I mean that's sad to say about your own party but that's it that's what I'm seeing I mean when remember this when Ted Cruz said he wouldn't endorse Donald Trump or at least didn't endorse him strongly enough for the convention he was booed off the stage when Bernie Sanders said he would endorse Hillary Clinton he was booed off the stage it shows you something and so I want to address this one point because I think it's very important I get a lot of flack a lot of flak people saying well why why do you go after Trump first of all as you see and I spent three-quarters of the show going after Hillary Clinton but when people say why do you go after Trump why why don't you just shut up about Trump after all do you want her to win here's my answer it is not my moral responsibility to live for Donald Trump that's not my moral responsibility it isn't and I know this argument ace of spades he's a blogger I really enjoy his work typically he wrote this piece about how basically it is your if you're never Trump er it's your responsibility your moral responsibility of Hillary Clinton wins and he says quote either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will be president in November if you think Hillary would be a better president fine I respect your opinion we all have different brains but what I must insist you cannot do is fantasize that while a trump supporter is responsible for the gaffes and disasters of a president Trump you are somehow innocent of the purges and witch hunts of a president Hillary Trump supporters will own the contents consequences of a trump presidency and Hillary supporters both those who declare it proudly and those who wish it secretly own the consequences of a Hillary presidency adults accept the consequences of their choices so here's where there's this logic falls apart this logic is not correct the reason this logic is not correct is because what people tend to do is they tend to conflate legal causation with moral causation let me give you an example okay let me give you an example you see a murder occur you see a murder occur and then you go on you tell the cops about it is that your fault the murderer goes to jail or is the murderers fault the murderer goes to jail so according to these fall you would be according these folks you would bear moral responsibility for the murderer going to jail according to me you don't bear any moral responsibility you told the truth about a bad thing that happened what's happening right now is that the Republicans are now trying to force people not just to back down all Trump with their vote because my vote doesn't mean anything that's not what they're concerned about the reason people are pissed at me is not because of how I'm voting aye vote in California my vote doesn't mean anything all right I'm gonna get outvoted by 30% doesn't make a difference the reason people care about what I'm doing is because they say the things that I say are hurting Donald Trump's the implication is if I say something true about Trump and it has the effect of hurting Donald Trump it's my fault if Trump loses this I refuse to accept and the reason I refuse to accept it is because it's not true it's Donald Trump's fault if Donald Trump says things that are stupid and I comment on them it's Donald Trump's fault if he says things that are morally unpalatable and I comment on them I'm not going to be chris Christie to watch Donald Trump get elected I'm not gonna be shinebox that's not my deal it's not your deal either as I've said at this point at least a thousand times if you want to vote for Donald Trump vote for Donald Trump but don't lie about Donald Trump because lies are bad the fact you have to go back to rudimentary moral reasoning now lies are bad it's the reason why both parties are now filled with Liars because there are too many people who believe that lies aren't bad so long as it's somebody on your side telling it lies are bad regardless and when Hillary lies that's bad when Trump lies that's bad you should not lie just because you like somebody the reason in fact you should support somebody is because they lie less the reason you should support someone is because they're better as a human being and they better principles and those principles matter and the fact that people are willing to turn themselves into mouthpieces for trumpism just because they hate Hillary so much that's what I find troubling and that's why I think conservatism is in trouble because I'm seeing it happen a lot I'm seeing it happen across the board people I respect people I don't respect people coming out and pretending that when Donald Trump does bad things it's totally okay because at least we're trying to defeat Hillary Clinton it's not okay you can still want him to defeat Hillary Clinton that's fine but please for the love of God do not do this routine where a Trump lie becomes not a lie because his last name isn't Clinton that's ridiculous okay all that said I mean that's the fight that's the fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party right there is not even whether you vote for Trump or don't vote for Trump back Trump or not back Trump it's whether you are willing to live for Trump or not willing to live for Trump that's the great moral conflict to me don't live for candidates your values your soul is worth a little bit more than that folks you can vote for whomever you want but don't lie to cover up other people's lies its silliness you don't owe anybody that least of all some candidate who doesn't give a damn about you all right time for some things I like in time for some things I don't like so this week we're gonna be doing since apparently the Russians hacked the the RNC several gonna do good Russian movies movies with Russian characters so did you start off I've mentioned it before but I don't think I've actually done the I don't think I've actually done this as a as a thing I like Eastern Promises great movie Viggo Mortensen and it's it's really it's really a very strong film it's it's definitely rated R it's a very r-rated film but it's a very effective movie so here's what the preview looks like we think he might be Russian mafia only as a member of borders the cornea in Russian prisons your life story is written on your body in tattoos who have tattoos you don't exist I'm afraid you've lost the mother unidentified woman died December the 20th 2313 baby girl born 20th of December 23 14 oh yeah where did you get this I found it in the handbag girl who died my ward barrier secrets was her body I'm a midwife I was hoping to speak to the manager I'm so sorry of you dear I ought to remember it is said sorry I'll probably find out more once I get her diary translated by diary you want to go for a drink it's Christmas everything's closed sometimes if things are closed you just open them up this girl ended up in the hands of the vory for so corny do you know what that means okay so things down there so he's really intense we haven't seen it it's really good movie David Cronenberg is not one of my favorite directors I thought a history of violence is a terrible film but this Eastern Promises a very very good film all right so okay time for some things that I hate so the DNC always wins the celebrity game at this at in terms of in terms of who comes to their convention so there's also all of these dumb celebrities are going to the DNC and everybody is losing their mind over it oh look at all these famous it's going to the DNC who's coming it's like Demi Lovato and so who else is coming it's like Demi Lovato Katy Perry who Lena Dunham very important that Lena Dunham show up because Lena Dunham has to go and talk about how she apparently molested her sister as she talked about in her book very important we've got we've got Kareem abdul-jabbar is showing up which is very exciting pute Lovato is showing up which is which is very exciting so it's a whole group of these celebrities and I understand the Republicans were trying to do the same thing somebody asked me over the weekend if you were to run a convention what would it look like and I said it wouldn't be a bunch of speeches number one I'd actually run it like a TV show so you know some of these well produced videos I think would be effective we're never gonna out celebrity the Democrats cuz the democrats entire pitch is moral superiority through voting for us until these celebrities love hillary clinton and they love this whole routine but yeah it just it goes to show you the celebrity culture is what drives democrats one of the reason by the way drives republicans to apparently it's why Donald Trump is the nominee if the guy had 0% name recognition the chances that he would be the nominee are approximately negative 30 okay so other things that I hate so there's this video going around of this drunk Texan guy losing his mind up will make America great again and here's what it what it looks like what is this about make America wide again I'm drew I'm gonna get over here I'm just tired of seeing all this races I don't want to live in a world without black women I love black women i'ii go to Supercuts to get a ninja hello my 9 times out of 10 I don't want to live in a world without in a veil NBA stand-up comedy that's funny to me Eddie Griffin Redd Foxx to me me personally there is not a more attractive woman than a black woman since wonderful his American ever been why what oh we came over here and killed the Indians and whenever we brought black folks over here to do the work that's what makes America great all the different people to work together live together shut that mic America why they get whatever these polls are saying shut this oh ok so first of all I don't know what this make America white again thing is that he's talking about maybe it's an alright thing obviously I agree I will say that I find it absolutely hysterical that you can say anything racist that you want like the most racist crap imaginable so long as you're saying it for diversity right I mean if you're a racist guy he's like I love black women if I go that's weird right if you're a racist guy and you're saying you know what I love I love stand-up comedy I love them black people throw popcorn at the screen like what really like you can't you get like what that's kind of weird it's kind of weird so it's what I love is when when the left tries to create this false dichotomy in the United States between you know the supposed right wing that wants to make America white again and all the other diverse wonderful people who are diverse and wonderful okay the fact is this let's look at American history briefly for just a second the reality is that white European males created the system under which we live that had nothing to do with their color it didn't it had to do with their ideas ideas are what matter the fact that they're white is irrelevant to me I don't care it makes no difference to me whether they were white or black or gray it doesn't make any difference to me whatever their ideas that were good the fact that anybody sees these things in terms of race is beyond me it does irritate me however that there's the whole point of this thing becoming popular is that the idea is that herds a drunk guy in a cowboy hat who isn't a racist the implication being that if it were that that normally a drunk guy in a cowboy hat would be a racist right that's that's why it's making those rounds because you're just a drunk guy in like Beverly Hills you'd be like okay well of course he's saying those things but it's a drunk guy in a cowboy hat therefore it's therefore it's it's fine I hate discussions of um in terms of race generally because I don't think that stand-up comedians are better because they're black or white or women are better because they're black or white if this guy is a thing for black women all right but it's good but it's just that that's not your that's not a really great excuse for diversity right that's that's this is so you know I think we need to get beyond uh half of what he's saying is true the problem is that it's conflated with with some other things that aren't particularly true namely the underlying message which is that there's a group of people in America a large swath of people who want to make a miracle white again I don't think that's true I think there are some people I get hit by them all the time so I believe me I know they're there but I think that's a vast vast vast minority the population and I think that the implication otherwise is a little bit disquieting okay so tomorrow I'm sure there's gonna be lots more from this Democratic dumpster fire to talk about tonight we get Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama it's gonna be so much fun maybe the Bernie Sanders supporters are gonna hold their fart in they were supposed to do that tonight so that's really exciting where they just they I'll just start farting simultaneously presumably they would do that in the middle of Michelle Obama's speech because they like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders I think they're gonna lukewarm about Michelle so she'd be the least the least offensive one two partnering or something out but we'll find out we'll find out in any case it is destined to be an event filled with hot air so we'll give you all the latest updates i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
