well it's been a supersize election spanning 11 time zones across 17 million square kilometers of territory Vladimir Putin has secured a fourth term as the Russian president by a landslide margin pavel edenian from the communist party is finishing second and in third it's Vladimir Zhirinovsky from the Liberal Democratic not well before heading over to his HQ to addressed the crowd of supporters there Vladimir Putin gave a speech at a concert marking four years since Crimea's reunification with Russia artis Jacqueline Ruger March 18th of course is an important day for a number of reasons here in Russia today of course is the presidential election but it's also the anniversary of the reunification with Crimea it was four years ago today that the treaty was signed freeing Crimea back under the umbrella of the Russian Federation and this concert was organized in commemoration of that just a stone's throw from Red Square star after star came on stage and sang a famous songs with everyone singing along and dancing but of course the main event was present putin himself he came out just after it was announced that he had officially won and this is the first time he spoke after that announcement the crowd was extremely excited to see him and he of course came on unsurprising with a huge smile on his face but he had a very good message for those who were here talking about unifying Russia and even coming together with those who may have voted for other candidates he also talked about that the work that needs to be done going forward from now and he also thanked everyone for coming out despite the cold tonight but nobody really seemed to mind among the dancing the singing and drinking hot tea that's being sold around the kit Square and this Square has been packed tonight I can't see to both ends but there are thousands of people packed in the square enjoying the concert while following those celebrations fruited had it headed to his headquarters where journalists were eager to ask him about the challenges he'll face in his next term Artie's egos done off reports Vladimir Putin has just made an appearance here at his headquarters and then held a short press conference and the first question he was asked was about the scruple case about the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in Great Britain and the blame for the poisoning is being widely pinned on Russia and even on Putin personally his how flattered Putin responded to those allegations the first thing that comes to my mind is that had this been a military poison the people affected would have died immediately this is obvious the second thing is that there are no such substances in Russia we destroyed all our chemical weapons as monitored by international inspectors and we did this first unlike some of our partners who promised to do the same but didn't fulfill their promise we are ready for cooperation in general I think anyone with common sense understands that it's nonsensical for Russia to do such a thing before the election and the World Cup it's just crazy another announcement that came rather unexpected from Vladimir Putin was when he was asking a question whether or not he will be planning to run six years from now in the next presidential election what Vladimir Putin did he hinted that this could be his final term as the leader of Russia at the moment I'm not planning any constitutional changes do you think you will be in the presidential seat until 2030 of course if you change the constitution I think what you're saying is laughable I'm not going to stay there until I turn 100 he also talked about his cabinet appointments about the potential shifts in the Russian government he said that all of those will be announced after the inauguration in terms of voter turnout the the elections have been spectacular not only the whole of Russia voted the all across all 11 time zones but also we've seen huge queues of people abroad cast their vote which they grabbed of course so a big turnout not the largest in Russia's history but certainly closer to the top mark and right now it doesn't look like there is a force that can stop Vladimir Putin from spending the next six years as russia's president
