did you direct him to make made the deal he made the deals and by the way he played to two counts that aren't a crime which nobody understands I watched a number of shows sometimes you get some pretty good information by watching shows those two counts aren't even a crime they weren't campaign finance did did you know about the payments later on I know later on but you have to understand anything what he did and they weren't taken out of campaign finance that's a big thing that's a much bigger thing did they come out of the campaign they didn't come out of the campaign they came from me well the man who once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump may have just put a bullet in Trump's legal defense Michael Cohen Trump's former attorney and fix her implicated Trump in an illegal scheme to silence two women who say they had affairs with him and whose stories could have flipped the results of the election that made Trump president Nicole and make it back up from one David pecker the head of the publishing company behind the National Enquirer who's been granted immunity in connection to the Cohen case The Associated Press reports that The Inquirer kept a safe containing documents about hush money payments and damaging stories it killed as part of its chummy relationship with Trump and here to discuss this stormy Daniels attorney Michael avenatti Michael it's good to see you good morning all right let's first talk about this Michael Cohen pleading out what is the significance of him pleading out to the case that you are also actively involved in well it's very significant joy for two fundamental reasons first of all Michael Cohen pleading out in the criminal case will allow the stay in our civil case to be lifted and we will be permitted to proceed with seeking a deposition of Michael Cohen which I'm a hundred percent confident will be granted as well as a deposition of Donald Trump during that deposition we're going to have an opportunity to ask Donald Trump some very difficult questions under oath about what he knew when he knew it what he did about it and all of his conduct criminal conduct potentially relating to the cover-up now is the reason that you believe that you'll be able to depose the president because now Michael Cohen is no longer at risk of criminal prosecution he's already pleaded it out that that's correct that investigation has now generally concluded as it relates to Michael Cohen which was the only reason that they provided to the court for the court to implement the stay now if you are able to depose Donald Trump and or Michael Cohen would you be willing to make those depositions public oh absolutely in fact we're going to fight vehemently to insist that those depositions are public immediately not just the transcript but we're gonna ask for videotaped depositions of both of those individuals joy this is a matter of significant national public importance and I've been saying this for six months now and I'm gonna continue to say it the American public knows exactly or should know exactly what happened here they deserve to know the truth they deserve to know what evidence there is they deserve to know what the President did in connection with this and they deserve to know it all now let me just unpack me just for a second what in your view the significance of it is because now we have David pecker who is the National Enquirer boss is essentially cutting a deal as well that he's willing to talk about the catch and kill agreements such as with Karen McDougal if you're the average person out there why should you care whether or not Donald Trump paid off stormy Daniels your client and Karen McDougal joy I've said this before I'm going to say it again it has nothing to do with the sex or whether Donald Trump had an affair or didn't have an affair this goes to the heart of our democracy for the following reason you cannot have individuals running for the highest office in the land that cover-up evidence and then lie about it to the American public and engage in criminal conduct associated with lying about it and covering up the payments to individuals this is about the cover-up it's about the the stakes at at issue in connection with running for the presidency and how important that is it's about the the bounds that this individual Donald Trump together with all of the other con men or around him went to in order to deceive the American public and I don't care if you're on the right or the left of the center or where you line up politically we cannot have a system in which people that are seeking the highest office in the land are lying in the American public we just can't stand for it and let me just put up a timeline really quickly of when these non-disclosure agreements were taking place you had the August 6 Karen McDougal NDA with ami which is the national enquirer company then in October you start to get this sort of cascade of negative stories that are of a sexual nature they Access Hollywood tape comes out October 7th the influent which comes at an exact same time the Obama administration was officially announcing Russia was hacking into our election you have Michael Cohen creating this company October 17th to try to pay off your client stormy Daniels Cohen wires the money October 27 the election is literally like a week a little bit more than a week later election days November 8th the Wall Street Journal reports on the National Inquirer sort of payment to mcdougal four days before that do you believe that the payoff to these women was an attempt to flip the election and do you believe that as a result of Donald Trump and Michael Cohen making those payments that they made his election illegitimate well there's no question that these payments were made in an attempt to influence the election I think Michael Cohen has already pled to that and if you look at the timing of these payments in comparison to when actually the conduct occurred years prior that there could be no legitimate argument that these payments were made for any reason other than attempting to install Donald Trump in the White House so that's number one and number two I absolutely believe that this conduct makes Donald Trump's election the white house illegitimate you know Donald Trump and others around him believe that he is above the law that he cannot be held accountable well I have a message for Donald Trump this morning we are going to work morning noon and night to make sure that he is held accountable we are going to acquire the evidence and the facts we're going to present that to the American public they're going to be the jury joy that will ultimately decide what happens to Donald Trump and here's another thing that this morning I am highly confident that in the coming weeks we are going to negotiate a resolution with Michael Cohen relating to the civil litigation the multiple cases that we have with him and I am highly confident that ultimately he's going to cooperate with me in connection with our attempts to get to the truth and to bring Donald Trump to justice let me ask you to just put on your sort of Park masticator hat which has been pretty good you've been pretty good at making these kind of prognostication if you had to guess what's in that am i ball plenty of damaging information joy I think it is a treasure trove of documents and evidence relating to the extent that Michael Cohen and Donald Trump went to cover up facts to hide facts from the American people in connection with the 2016 election and I think it's going to blow this thing wide open is do you think it is about other women you event you have hinted before there are other women that Donald Trump paid off during the course of that election is that do you think this is mostly about paying women off there's no question it's for a lot of people hard to believe that all of this activity that we're seeing around Michael Cohen is all about the women with all due respect do you think that this at the end of the day the investigations into Michael Cohen are just about payoffs to women or do you think this investigation into him goes into Trump Tower Moscow goes into this Ukraine peace deal that he proffered goes quite frankly into Russia Gabe I think it's broad reaching and I think that with each passing day it likely becomes even broader they did not grant the immunity prosecutors did not grant the immunity that they did solely to get to the issues about a few payoffs this is this is far-reaching joy and I think you know anytime you pull on a string you don't know where it's going to end and this is going to end in a disaster for Donald Trump as it should his criminal enterprise and his criminal conduct is finally going to catch up to him I could promise you that you think the weiselberger deal is the most significant development so far well certainly one of the top most significant developments I mean Michael Cohen's plea agreement and also what I just stated which is I think he is highly likely to cooperate with us coming weeks and to negotiate a resolution to work with us to bring the facts and the evidence the American people and if that happens Donald Trump better buckle up all right and I said us at Weissenberg immunity not plea deal thank you very much
