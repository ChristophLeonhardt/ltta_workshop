Laura: CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE IG REPORT OUT TODAY. DESPITE A NUMBER OF EXPLOSIVE REVELATIONS, SOME LAWMAKERS ARE STILL SUGGESTING THE PARTS MAY BEEN REDACTED. JOINING ME NOT TO GIVE US EXCLUSIVE REACTION'S HOUSE INTEL CHAIR DEVIN NUNES. CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. ON THIS MATTER, THE HILLARY EMAIL MATTER, YOUR INITIAL REACTION. THE FIRST THING I CAN THINK OF IS THERE WAS INFORMATION WE GOT TODAY AT 11:00, 12:00 THAT CHAIRMAN GOWDY HAD TO CALL AND TELL ME WHAT IT WAS, TEXT MESSAGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SINCE LATE LAST YEAR. THESE ARE TEXT MESSAGES THAT CLEARLY WERE PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION AND TO FISA ABUSE AND THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION, WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS COLLUSION. THESE ARE EMAILS OR TEXT MESSAGES THAT SOMEBODY HELD A FROM US. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY, THERE'S A NEW EXAMPLE OF OBSTRUCTION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. Laura: I WANT TO READ TO YOU BETWEEN AN EXCHANGE BETWEEN LISA PAGE AND PETER STRZOK, THE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS. SHE BASICALLY SAID SHE WAS DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GET ELECTED, RIGHT, RIGHT? HE ANSWERS BASICALLY DON'T WORRY. WE WILL STOP IT. NO, NO, NO, WE WILL STOP IT. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR, THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR. LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON THE CLINTON EMAIL CASE. STARTS OFF THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION USING OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES TO GO AFTER THE TARGET, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THIS IS A GUY WHO LEADS AT ALL. WORSE THAN ALL THAT, WORSE THAN ALL THAT AND I WANT TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID IN THE OPENING. WHY WASN'T THAT GIVEN TO CONGRESS? WHY DID I FIND OUT ABOUT THAT TODAY AT NOON? THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE OF OBSTRUCTION BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO'S GOING TO INVESTIGATE THESE GUYS? WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WERE GOING TO GET ALL THE DOCUMENTS WE WANT. ULTIMATELY THIS IS ALL GOING TO SPILL OUT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ASK, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? WHO IS GOING TO GET BUSTED? WHO'S GOING TO GO TO JAIL? Laura: LISA PAGE'S TEXT WAS RELEASED BEFORE BUT THE STRZOK "DON'T WORRY. NO, NO, NO WE'LL STOP IT." THAT CAME TODAY. HOP WITHOUT A POSSIBLY BEEN REDACTED? THAT'S THE PROBLEM. THEY KEEP BLACKING THINGS OUT ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT GIVING US DOCUMENTS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALWAYS END UP BEING VERY PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION. Laura: THE IG WROTE THE FOLLOWING IN ONE PART OF THE "UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT STRZOK'S DECISION TO PRIORITIZE THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION OF THE FOLLOWING UP ON THE MIDYEAR RELATED INVESTIGATION LEAD INVESTIGATED DISCOVERED ON THE WEINER LAPTOP WAS FREE FROM BIAS." SO THE IG CANNOT CONSTANTLY STATE THAT IT WAS FREE FROM BIAS STATE THAT IT WAS FREE FROM BIA BIAS. THEY ARE SAYING THERE WAS NO POLITICAL BIAS ON THE PART OF COMEY. THEY ARE TRYING TO DOWNPLAY IT. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE KNOW. I'VE NEVER SAID THIS BEFORE. WE HAD WHISTLE-BLOWERS BUT WE COULDN'T REALLY USE THE INFORMATION BUT NOW THAT IT'S IN THE IG REPORT, WE CAN. WE HAD WHISTLE-BLOWERS WHO CAME TO US IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF 2016 WILL TALK TO US ABOUT THIS LAPTOP SITTING IN NEW YORK THAT HAD ADDITIONAL EMAILS ON IT. THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTE COMMITTEE, WE HAD IT BUT WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Laura: WHEN WAS THAT AGAIN? INCORPORATED 2016. Laura: DO YOU KNOW WHEN EXACTLY? ETIQUETTE WAS LATE SEPTEMBER. Laura: ULTIMATELY THEY DIDN'T MOVE ON THIS UNTIL LATE OCTOBER. GOOD FBI AGENTS BROUGHT THIS TO OUR ATTENTION, BUT WHAT COULD WE DO WITH IT? Laura: THERE IS ANOTHER EXCHANGE I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF THE CLASSIFIED AND THIS IS A GAME THAT COMEY AND COMPANY HAVE BEEN PLAYING THAT THEY HIDE BEHIND THIS Laura: THEY ALL THOUGHT HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN. ROCKING THE BOAT WAS TOUGH. HE MADE A DECISION TO GO AFTER THAT LAPTOP BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IF SOMEONE FINDS OUT ABOUT IT, THEY ARE GOING TO BAKE THE WHOLE ELECTION WAS ILLEGITIMATE. WHAT'S ALSO TRUE AS I THINK THE SAME PEOPLE IN CHARGE TODAY STILL BELIEVE THEY CAN RUN THE CLOCK OUT AND THEY ARE TRYING TO RUN THE CLOCK OUT FOR THE REST OF THE CONGRESS THAT WE GET FINISH OUR INVESTIGATION. Laura: ARE THERE STILL PEOPLE IN THE FBI TODAY WHO BELIEVE THEY OPERATE BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES? AT THE TOP. AT THE TOP, I THINK THAT IS STILL TRUE. WE HEARD SOME GREAT WORD STATEMENT CHRISTOPHER WRAY, THE NEW DIRECTOR. BUT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE VERY CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM MANY MONTHS AGO WHERE WE SAID LOOK, YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF IT. YOU NEED TO CLEAN THIS UP, AND WE WILL SUPPORT YOU AND CLEANING IT UP BUT YET HERE IT IS TODAY WE GET THIS TEXT MESSAGE AT NOON TODAY, ONE THAT'S ABSENTLY PERTINENT TO OUR INVESTIGATION. MAYBE THEY HAVE A GOOD EXCUSE FOR IT BUT THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS IF THEY DIDN'T GIVE IT TO US IT'S A PROBLEM. IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT IT'S AN EVEN BIGGER PROBLEM. Laura: THERE'S OTHER THINGS, ANOTHER EXCHANGE. FBI ATTORNEY SENT THEY DON'T IDENTIFY WHO THIS IS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHO THIS IS. FOR SOME REASON, WE CAN'T GET THE PERSON'S NAME. FBI ATTORNEY NUMBER TO SEND AN INSTANT MESSAGE TO FBI ATTORNEY NUMBER ONE COMMENTING ON THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE SUBJECT OF AN FBI INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN PAID WHILE WORKING ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. FBI ATTORNEY ONE SAYS IS IT MAKING YOU RETHINK YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? FBI ATTORNEY NUMBER TWO SAYS HELL NO. THE IG REPORT, THERE'S FIVE PEOPLE BEEN KICKED OFF THE CAMPAIGN. IF THERE'S FIVE PEOPLE BEEN KICKED OFF THE CAMPAIGN OR OFF THE MUELLER TEAM, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK AT THE REST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE, THEY WERE ALL CLINTON DONORS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO END UP FAIRLY. I DON'T KNOW. Laura: SHOULD WE LEARN THE NAMES OF THESE ATTORNEYS WHO WERE SENDING THESE MESSAGES WHO WERE PART OF THE RESISTANCE? I DON'T KNOW WHY. UNLESS THEY ARE AND ARE UNDERCOVER AGENT. Laura: IT SAYS THEY ARE ATTORNEYS. THIS IS THE TYPE OF STUFF THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS. Laura: NOW I KNOW YOU HOW YOU FEEL BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT'S HAPPENING TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW. THERE WAS ANOTHER ISSUE INVOLVING FBI EMPLOYEES AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION. THIS IS FROM THE REPORT. WITH NO OFFICIAL REASON TO BE IN CONTACT WITH THE MEDIA. WHO WERE NEVERTHELESS IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH REPORTERS. THE LARGE NUMBER OF FBI EMPLOYEES WHO WERE IN CONTACT WITH JOURNALISTS DURING THIS TIME. IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY LEAKS. AND THEY WERE GETTING PERKS, GETTING TICKETS. THEY HAVE BEEN LEAKING LIKE CRAZY. THE PROBLEM IS THE IG REPORT DISCOVERED THAT. THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. BUT DON'T FORGET THE LEAK THAT JUST OCCURRED LAST WEEK WHERE AT MIDNIGHT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SENDS OUT THIS DEVIN NUNES AND PAUL RYAN HAD A CHANCE TO READ DOCUMENTS AND THEY DIDN'T READ THEM. REMEMBER THAT? THAT WAS A LEAK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, IT MIDNIGHT PRESS RELEASE SO THAT WE WOULD WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVE TO ANSWER ALL THIS NEW NARRATIVE THEY ARE CREATING THE REPUBLICANS ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS. THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH. IT'S NOT AS IF THE LEAKS HAVE STOPPED. NOW THEY ARE DOING IT, THE FBI PEOPLE WERE LEAKING. NOW IT'S AT THE TOP LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT'S LEAKING. Laura: THERE WAS A FEW PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA DOWNPLAYING ALL OF THIS GRANT WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU A SHORT MONTAGE. WATCH. I EXPECTED A SLEDGEHAMMER. WE GOT THE SAME KIND OF HAMMER USED TO NAIL PAINTING ON THE WALL. I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MILD IT WAS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASSAULT ON THE FBI THAT'S TAKEN PLACE, THAT'S BEEN THE CALL OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SAYING THESE ARE CROOKS. THEY ARE CORRUPT. THEY TRIED TO THROW AN ELECTION. THIS REPORT DOES NOT SAY THAT. Laura: CONGRESSMEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ONE GENTLEMAN ON THERE, THAT'S THE GUY THAT IT IS ONE OF COMEY'S BUDDIES WORKING AT THE FBI. A LOT OF THESE AGENTS, THE OTHER NETWORKS HAVE HIRED ALL OF THESE FORMER FBI AND DOJ CLINTON PEOPLE AND OBAMA PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. Laura: NOTHING THERE TO SEE. CONGRESSMAN, YOU STILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO GET TO WITH THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. WE ARE ALMOST THERE. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'VE BEEN HIDING THESE DOCUMENTS FOR TWO MONTHS.
