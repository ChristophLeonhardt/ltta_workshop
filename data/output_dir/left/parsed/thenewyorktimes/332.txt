It’s a tale of two memos.
One from Republican Representative Devin Nunes.
And one from Democratic Representative Adam Schiff.
First, the Nunes memo.
In 2016, the F.B.I. and Justice Department
applied for a warrant to
wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.
The now declassified
Nunes memo
asserts that officials
relied on information
from former British intelligence
officer Christopher Steele,
without adequately
explaining to the judge
that Democrats had
financed the research.
Trump’s allies say
the Nunes memo shows
that the F.B.I.'s 
Russia investigation
was politically biased 
in its early stages.
President Trump cleared
the way for its release.
Democrats, including Adam Schiff,
have proposed their own
currently classified memo
at the same time
so the public can
judge both together.
It apparently explains why
various points in the Nunes memo
are wrong or misleading.
For example, sources say
the information from Steele
was only one thread in
a tapestry of evidence
from various sources that the
Nunes memo ignored,
exaggerating its relative importance.
But Republicans made
the Nunes memo public
without simultaneously making
the rebuttal Schiff memo public, too.
It seems to be an
attempt to shift focus away
from the Russia
investigation itself
and toward what they’re trying
to argue is the real scandal:
the investigators.
