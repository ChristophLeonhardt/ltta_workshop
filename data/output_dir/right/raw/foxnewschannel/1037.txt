1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,086
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH A FOX NEWS

2
00:00:11,086 --> 00:00:11,386
ALERT.

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,522
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DICTATOR KIM

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,223
JONG-UN BOTH IN SINGAPORE

5
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:18,460
PREPPING FOR THE HIGH STAKES

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:18,794
MOMENT.

7
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:21,797
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT WILL IT

8
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:24,466
TAKE FOR NORTH KOREA TO GIVE UP

9
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,100
THEIR NUKES.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,371
>> HERE WITH US IS JOE

11
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:29,805
LIEBERMAN.

12
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,209
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

13
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,044
>> GREAT, IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE

14
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:37,045
WITH YOU.

15
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:39,481
>> WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT

16
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,617
WALK DOWN THE STEPS IN

17
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:42,217
SINGAPORE.

18
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,086
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS?

19
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,522
>> I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT.

20
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:49,591
YOU CAN'T JUMP TO A CONCLUSION

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:55,163
ABOUT REACHING A MEANINGFUL

22
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:55,530
AGREEMENT.

23
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,300
WE HAVE THE TWO HEADS OF STATE.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,603
WE ARE THE MUCH MORE POWERFUL

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:01,937
COUNTRY.

26
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,239
NEVER HAS THE PRESIDENT AND THE

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,909
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA MET.

28
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:09,411
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BRING PEACE

29
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,346
TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

30
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:15,517
THE REST IS UP TO THESE TWO MEN.

31
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:16,885
>> SENATOR, YOU MENTIONED IT MAY

32
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:17,786
BE DIFFERENT.

33
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,755
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

34
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,124
FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.

35
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:27,396
WE ARE ALSO AT A POINT WHEN

36
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:30,866
NORTH KOREA HAS 30 TO 60 NUKES.

37
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,368
THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR

38
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:34,069
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

39
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,304
DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A

40
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,440
PROCESS IN PLACE THAT'S ABOUT TO

41
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,613
BEGIN THAT COULD LEAD TO

42
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:46,014
DENUCLEARIZE EVERYONE IS TALKING

43
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:46,882
ABOUT.

44
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:48,650
>> IT COULD LEAD TO THAT.

45
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,253
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

46
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,388
NEGOTIATIONED AN AGREEMENT WITH

47
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:54,589
KIM'S FATHER.

48
00:01:54,589 --> 00:01:56,925
WE SET UP A BIG ECONOMIC

49
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,060
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

50
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,795
THE SUNSHINE

51
00:01:59,795 --> 00:01:59,828
THE SOUSHINE

52
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,862
THE SOUTHINE

53
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:00,896
THE SOUTH KE

54
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,398
THE SOUTH KOREAS WERE INVOLVED.

55
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,200
BASICALLY THEY TOOK THE MONEY

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,536
AND WALKED AWAY FROM THE

57
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:07,903
AGREEMENT.

58
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:10,405
THIS MAY BE DIFFERENT FOR A LOT

59
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:11,306
OF REASONS.

60
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,375
THIS IS A NEW GENERATION.

61
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,843
KIM JONG-UN IS IN CHARGE.

62
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:19,915
HE HAS RAPIDLY DEVELOPED THEIR

63
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:20,949
NUCLEAR PROGRAMS.

64
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:26,154
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS AN

65
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,689
UNCONVENTIONAL AMERICAN LEADER.

66
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,825
HE ALSO SET KIM JONG-UN OFF A

67
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,227
BIT AND MADE HIM WONDER IF A

68
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:33,962
DEAL IS POSSIBLE.

69
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:35,997
OUR DEMANDS, OUR PRESIDENT HAS

70
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:42,471
BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

71
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,773
PERMANENT, IRREVERSIBLE.

72
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:48,009
ANY TIME ANYWHERE INSPECTION

73
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:48,410
PROGRAM.

74
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,545
THAT'S ASKING A LOT OF A LEADER

75
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,782
OF A CLOSED SOCIETY.

76
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,418
WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE

77
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,286
HIM A LOT.

78
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,855
>> SENATOR, YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT

79
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:01,957
OF THINGS, YOU PLAYED A HUGE

80
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:04,526
ROLE IN THE IRAN DEAL.

81
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,428
IF YOU WERE WITH THE PRESIDENT

82
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:07,529
STANDING OUTSIDE THE DOOR WITH

83
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,563
KIM JONG-UN.

84
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,699
WHAT ADVISE WOULD YOU GIVE HIM.

85
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:15,837
WHAT PITFALLS WOULD YOU SAY

86
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:20,142
AVOID?

87
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:21,376
>> RIGHT.

88
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:23,411
IRONICALLY, GOING BACK TO THE

89
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,147
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REMEMBER ALL

90
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,449
OF THE CRITICISMS YOU MADE OF

91
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,584
THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT

92
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,020
BECAUSE THEY ARE RELEVANT HERE.

93
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,523
YOU DON'T WANT THE AGREEMENT

94
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,524
WITH NORTH KOREA MORE THAN THE

95
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,858
NORTH KOREANS DID.

96
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:39,895
IT LOOKED LIKE THE OBAMA

97
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:40,595
ADMINISTRATION DID.

98
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,465
DON'T SETTLE FOR A HALFWAY

99
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:45,967
MEASURE, OKAY, WE'LL STOP IT BUT

100
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,203
THEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL

101
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:50,605
START IT AGAIN.

102
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:58,513
DON'T COMPROMISE ON AN

103
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,015
INSPECTION LIKE IRAN.

104
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:04,186
ALSO FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

105
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,121
THIS IS BIG AND IMPORTANT TO

106
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,923
THAT PART OF THE WORLD AND TO

107
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,024
THE UNITED STATES.

108
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:10,759
WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS CAN

109
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,260
REACH ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED

110
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,796
STATES WITH ONE OF THEIR

111
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,163
MISSILES.

112
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:19,067
IN THE END, IT COMES DOWN TO THE

113
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,168
RELATIONSHIP THAT THESE TWO MEN

114
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:22,337
ESTABLISH WITH ONE ANOTHER.

115
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,706
I DON'T EXPECT A BIG BREAK

116
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:27,442
THROUGH TODAY, BUT IF THEY GET

117
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:29,644
SOME PERSONAL TRUST BETWEEN THEM

118
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,279
6789 TALK ABOUT THE PARAMETERS

119
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,283
OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND KIM TELLS

120
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:40,455
PRESIDENT TRUMP I'M OPEN TO THE

121
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:42,791
PERMANENT DENUCLEARIZE THAT MAY

122
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,127
MEAN WE MIGHT SAY WE WON'T PUT

123
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,496
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN SOUTH KOREA.

124
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,732
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO GO.

125
00:04:50,732 --> 00:00:00,000
>> WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
