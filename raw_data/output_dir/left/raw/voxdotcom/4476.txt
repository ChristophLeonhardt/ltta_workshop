1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:06,770
When you think of factory labor this might come to mind: Dangerous conditions with overcrowded

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,720
assembly lines of people completing repetitive tasks for long hours.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,370
But the workforce in manufacturing is facing a major overhaul.

4
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,910
Although automation and offshoring have shrunk
manufacturing jobs drastically over the past

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,369
few decades, the industry is actually adding
jobs now.

6
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,119
But they look really different.

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,029
Manufacturers are quick to adapt automation
and change the way we make our products – now

8
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:36,730
we need to change how we “make” our workers,
and there's one solution with bipartisan support.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,060
More apprenticeships; youth apprenticeships;
apprenticeships; apprenticeship; two-year

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,060
apprenticeship.

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,980
I'll be signing an executive order to expand
apprenticeships and vocational training to

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,970
help all Americans find a rewarding career,
earn a great living, and support themselves

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:03,550
and their families and love going to work
in the morning.

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,619
Apprenticeships differ from other training
programs in a few ways: They have to offer

15
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:11,159
combined classroom or conceptual learning
with on-the-job mentored training.

16
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,590
Apprentices must be employed and paid by the
firm and they have to last at least a year

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,469
ending with a degree, certification or both.

18
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,390
This means that apprentices earn on-the-job
experience while building an educational foundation

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,359
simultaneously – and make money while they’re
doing it.

20
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:27,200
But there’s a marketing problem in the United
States.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,500
When Americans think of apprenticeships they
often see think of this “old-timey” training

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,170
for blue-collar work – and that’s not
our fault.

23
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,439
The vast majority of apprenticeships in America
are concentrated in the construction field

24
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,679
and they rely heavily on contributions from
Union laborers.

25
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:44,090
Even then, we don't have that many apprenticeships
to begin with.

26
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,569
Here in the US a four year degree has been
seen as a golden ticket to economic mobility

27
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:53,259
and higher paying jobs and this blue-collar-bias
with apprenticeships has Americans viewing

28
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,670
it as a lesser alternative to higher education.

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,829
In countries like Germany and Australia, students
can get an apprenticeship in nearly any profession

30
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:05,700
from IT to banking to hospitality and advanced
manufacturing.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,459
Many of these students go on to complete a
four year degree on top of the certifications.

32
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,069
Americans are already struggling with the
rising costs of higher education and the job

33
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,400
market isn’t making it easy to see a return.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,020
So while thousands of people came out of colleges
with degrees in highly desired STEM fields,

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,920
74 percent of them are currently working in
unrelated professions.

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,659
And yet, manufacturers are citing a problem.

37
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,870
The manufacturing industry is projecting three
and a half million new jobs over the next

38
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,010
decade – two million of which, they claim,
won’t be filled due to a “skills gap.”

39
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,220
The skills needed?

40
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,959
Higher proficiency in Math, computers and
tech.

41
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,360
So despite there being plenty of people with
the degrees they’re not often looking to

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,840
manufacturing for work and there could be
a few reasons for that.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,450
We have employers that want workers that know
high school math and read at a college level

44
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,440
and want to pay them ten dollars an hour and
then they feel that there's a skill shortage.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,190
For me, what there is is a wage shortage.

46
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,570
And maybe it's a bit of both – the manufacturing
industry has been working to change years

47
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,810
of public perception.

48
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,209
They think of the old manufacturing – The
mills, dark, dirty environment – we have

49
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:13,730
to change that perception.

50
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:18,060
This stigma has followed the manufacturing
industry since the Industrial Revolution,

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,939
when people worked for hours on end for little
pay.

52
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,579
In England, so called “apprentices” were
often orphaned children recruited to work

53
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:28,200
in dangerous conditions in exchange for pennies
or room and board.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,099
With the development of labor unions and the
implementation of child labor laws conditions

55
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,740
in factories drastically changed.

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:41,610
Wages went up, hours went down, and then companies
began to automate and offshore jobs.

57
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,090
Foreign labor and industrial robots allowed
manufacturers to lower costs and increase

58
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,090
production.

59
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,459
It also cost the US nearly 6 million jobs
in a single decade.

60
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,410
But now, as automation progresses, some of
the factories are coming back.

61
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,920
The new jobs offered, though, are far from
low-skilled assembly line work.

62
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,799
Ten years ago, 15 years ago we could have
a mechanic and then we would have an electrician.

63
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,159
And then you had maybe a robotics person.

64
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,709
Well, now we need all those skills in one
individual.

65
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,280
t's like a Swiss army knife.

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,988
You want somebody with different skill sets
and the new industry and the new economy.

67
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,238
That's what it demands.

68
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,160
That “swiss army knife” of a worker needs
a combination of skills but not technically

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,300
the full proficiency of an electrical or mechanical
engineer.

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,139
What’s needed is something in-between.

71
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,389
Companies like BMW in the Carolinas use apprenticeships
to build the skilled workforce that they need

72
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:39,470
by raising the technical proficiency of an
existing workforce, which is what apprenticeships

73
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,830
do best.

74
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,949
It doesn't really feel like work.

75
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,210
It feels like I'm just training all the time.

76
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:52,710
I'm always trying to learn, and our supervisors
put us into positions where we need to learn.

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,950
In countries like Germany, apprenticeships
are built into their educational system.

78
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,389
Nearly 60% of German high school students
enter an apprenticeship.

79
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,830
And as a result their youth unemployment rate
is one of the lowest in the world.

80
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,930
It also helps in the long-run: Apprenticeship
programs have been considered a staple in

81
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,120
Germany’s economic strength.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,949
Apprenticeships offer a direct connection
between education and employment making it

83
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,960
a natural fit for the ebbs and flows of the
economy.

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,240
About half of apprentices land full time jobs
after their training is finished.

85
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,850
In Germany the view is that a worker is an
investment rather than of a cost.

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,669
You assume that the worker is going to be
there a long time.

87
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,980
So of course you want to invest in making
that worker as productive as possible.

88
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,230
Yet, in the United States, employers are wary
to spend time and money on training without

89
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,550
concrete numbers that show a return on investment.

90
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,419
When you talk about apprentice program and
training it's really hard to come up with

91
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,100
your hard core number.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,800
If you do it just numbers as a budgeting does
a little bit intangible but when you see the

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,030
benefits of the workforce – How's that working
towards quality here – it's very tangible,

94
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,330
in my opinion, the quality of that investment.

95
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,240
BMW has set up shop in South Carolina and
is utilizing a German-inspired, American-made

96
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,960
apprenticeship program.

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,750
The Carolina’s are unique in that they have
a state-funded workforce development program

98
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,600
that pairs companies with technical schools
in the area.

99
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,990
This allows companies to craft employees to
the needs of the industry with custom-built

100
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,930
training programs while directly communicating
with apprentices and their needs.

101
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,990
I really thought like OK they're going to
like work like crazy and then I'm not going

102
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,290
to be able to get caught up on my school and
things are going to suffer.

103
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,150
No they told us that education is first.

104
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,070
Doing that and having the flexibility in our
work schedules really helps out.

105
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,509
So when I'm learning something at school I
come here and I'm actually doing it more hands-on

106
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,660
I'm using it in a practical field.

107
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,971
The companies invest in their apprentices
for 2 years, covering their tuition at the

108
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:53,800
technical college and offering on-the-job
training in between.

109
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,040
Apprentices finish the program with an associate's
degree, one or more certifications and, often

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,620
times, a full-time job with the company.

111
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,479
Even if the apprentices don’t take the job
offer, it’s not a technically a huge loss

112
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,430
to the company since they actually work.

113
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,669
Employers can pay apprentices less than they
pay full-time employees, but they’re still

114
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,310
contributing to the company as they learn.

115
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,620
The more we can bring up the technical skill
within the workforce.

116
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,300
I think we're all going to ultimately benefit
in better products.

117
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,340
Higher wages and things of that nature.

118
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,030
So yeah, I look at it as a long term investment,
maybe, you know, in the U.S. workforce.

119
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,860
Automation is a present reality in manufacturing
and it's continuously raising the bar for

120
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,310
factory labor.

121
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,330
It's true that companies need to invest in
robotics to improve their production lines

122
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,910
but workers can't be left behind as a result.

123
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,419
While the days of interchangeable employees
are coming to a close, there's a long way

124
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,810
to go before humans become obsolete.

125
00:07:49,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Successfully investing in this automated future
starts with developing the human workforce.
