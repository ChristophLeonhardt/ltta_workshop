it happened a few weeks ago this month here at our cottage since the standard typical nighty-night we're doing just roasting chicken and chicken and it just just an amazing surprise it was so sweet and natural and very romantic he got on one knee cause it's an instant yes for me yes as a matter of fact I could barely let me finish propose again so can I say yes ma'am so didn't even let me finish them and then those hugs and I have the ring in my finger and I was like can I can I give you the ring she's all yes the ready so no resume it was a really nice moment the two of us and I think I managed to catch some catcher by surprise as well
