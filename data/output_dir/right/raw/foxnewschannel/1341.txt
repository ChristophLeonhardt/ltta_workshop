00:00:20,157 --> 00:00:20,758
LOSING TRACK OF ILLEGAL

NOT REPORTING.

33
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,734

00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,129
THE INFERENCE OF COURSE BEING

47
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,030
THAT TRUMP HIMSELF WAS CONFINING

48
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,865
HIM AS IMMIGRANT CHILDREN RIPPED

49
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:35,401

51
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:38,437
THE SAME PICTURE WAS SHARED BY

00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:40,573
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS LIKE JOHN

53

56
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:47,580

57
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,080
WITH THIS PHOTO.

58
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,417
IT’S FROM 2014.

59
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,118
WHEN THE SAINTLY BARACK OBAMA

60
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:52,885
AND THE COMPASSIONATE ONES WERE

61
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,154
ALL IN CHARGE.

62
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:59,225
AT THE TIME, THE LEFT-WING MEDIA

63
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:00,059
DID NOT CONSIDER DETAINING

64
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:00,660
ILLEGALS WORTH COVERING.

65
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,262
BUT NOW THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

66
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:04,797
ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS, HE

67
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:09,735
SUDDENLY JUST A HEARTLESS THUG.

68
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:12,372
GOLD HAD TO RETRACTOR TWEET BUT

69
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:13,640

73
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:21,581
THEY ARE FROM 2014.

74
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,882
IT GAVE THE IMPRESSION BECAUSE

75
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:25,685
YOU WROTE THAT THEY WERE FIRST

77
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:28,688
DETENTION.

78
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,289
IT USUALLY DOESN’T LABEL

79
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,090
SOMETHING FIRST PHOTOS WHEN THEY

80
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,791
ARE FOUR YEARS OLD.

81
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,060
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR

82
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,661
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TO

83
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,429
APOLOGIZE FOR ITS OUTRAGEOUS

84
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:36,896
HEADLINE.

85
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:38,064
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE TIMES

86
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,900
COULD HAVE ANSWERED THEIR OWN

87
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,970
QUESTION BY READING FURTHER DOWN

88
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,971
IN THEIR OWN PEACE.

89
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,039
DID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

90
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:46,873
SEPARATE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN FROM

91
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:50,577
PARENTS AND LOSE THEM?

92
00:02:50,577 --> 00:02:51,378
NO, THEY CLEARLY DIDN’T BECAUSE

93
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:54,381
THE TIMES WRITES THAT THOSE

94
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:55,082
CHILDREN HAD ARRIVED ALONE AT

95
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,485
THE SOUTHWEST BORDER WITHOUT

96
00:02:58,485 --> 00:02:59,987
THEIR PARENTS.

97
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,321
I HAVE A QUESTION.

98
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,022
HOW CAN YOU SEPARATE ILLEGAL

99
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,191
ALIEN CHILDREN FROM THEIR

100
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,926
PARENTS WHEN THE PARENTS SENT

101
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:08,829
THEM HERE ALONE?

102
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,198
THERE IS A GLARING LOOPHOLE IN

103
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:15,836
THE IMMIGRATION LAW THAT FORBIDS

104
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,137
DEPORTING UNACCOMPANIED MINORS

105
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:17,705
FROM CENTRAL AMERICA,

106
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,607
NONCONTIGUOUS COUNTRIES.

107
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:20,674
THE ILLEGALS KNOW THIS SO THEY

108
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:24,778
ABUSE THE SYSTEM AND I WOULD

109
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:25,546
ARGUE ENDANGER THEIR CHILDREN IN

110
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,581
THE PROCESS.

111
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,315
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

112
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:30,618
UNACCOMPANIED ILLEGAL MINOR --

113
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,587
BUT REMEMBER HE OR SHE COULD BE

114
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,423
16, 17 OR ONE DAY FROM HIS OR

115
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,257
HER 18TH BIRTHDAY, BY THE WAY,

116
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,492
CROSSES THE BORDER ILLEGALLY?

117
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:41,996
THE UNITED STATES THEN THROWS

118
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:42,763
THEM INTO WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A

119
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,265
FOSTER CARE PROGRAM.

120
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,368
ACCORDING TO STEVE WEGNER, AND

121
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,936
HHS OFFICIAL, THE 10,000

122
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:52,974
CHILDREN AND TEENS IN CUSTODY

123
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:54,542
COST THE TAXPAYERS OVER

124
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,011
$1 BILLION ANNUALLY.

125
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,581
OTHERS ARE SENT TO SPONSORS.

126
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,783
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THE

127
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,417
GOVERNMENT FINDS THE KIDS

128
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:04,986
SPONSORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS IN

129
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,221
THE UNITED STATES WHOM THEY CAN

130
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,590
GO LIVE WITH AS THEIR CASE

131
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,424
PROCEEDS, OR BETTER PUT, AS IT

132
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:13,028
DRAGS ON FOR YEARS WHILE OF

133
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:14,295
COURSE IF YOU SHOW UP FOR THEIR

134
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,264
DEPORTATION OR IMMIGRATION

135
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,867
HEARING.

136
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,935
SO AT THE START OF THE TRUMP

137
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:24,606
ADMINISTRATION LOST IMMIGRANT

138
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,374
KIDS, THEY DIDN’T LOSE ANYBODY.

139
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,210
WHEN HHS TRIED TO CHECK UP ON

140
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,779
THESE KIDS WITH THEIR SPONSORS,

141
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,881
AT TIMES, ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

142
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:35,217
FAMILIES THEMSELVES CARING FOR

143
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:38,587
THE CHILDREN, 1475 FAILED TO

144
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,455
TAKE THE CALLS OR EVEN RESPOND

145
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:43,392
TO THE GOVERNMENT AT ALL.

146
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,494
SO THE IMMIGRANT KIDS AREN’T

147
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:45,794
LOST.

148
00:04:45,794 --> 00:04:46,995
THEIR SPONSORS JUST HAVEN’T

149
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,465
CONNECTED WITH THE HHS, OR MADE

150
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:52,401
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE.

151
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:53,369
BUT THE MEDIA WANT TO

152
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:55,404
MISCONSTRUE THAT AS LOSING A

153
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:55,771
KID, OKAY.

154
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,773
LET’S DO THAT FOR A MOMENT.

155
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:58,474
HYPOTHETICALLY LET’S JUST SAY

156
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:02,311
THAT THAT’S CORRECT.

157
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,380
OBAMA LOST NEARLY THREE TIMES

158
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,549
THE NUMBER OF KIDS,

159
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:08,084
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING A

2016 INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT

161
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,720
SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

162
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,723
WAS ABLE TO REACH ONLY 84% OF

163
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:18,995
CHILDREN IT HAD PLACED LEAVING

164
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:23,866
4,159 UNDERCOUNTED

165
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,467
4,159 UNACCOUNTED FOR.

166
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:25,268
CORRECT ME IF I’M WRONG, I DON’T

167
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:27,770
REMEMBER ANY MEDIA LASHING OUT

168
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,838
AT OBAMA FOR LOSING KIDS OR

169
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:31,774
SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR

170
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:32,575
FAMILIES.

171
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:35,445
IN FACT, OBAMA AND HIS HOMELAND

172
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:38,448

173
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,316

ON THE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS WHEN

175
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,088
THERE WAS A HUGE RUSH AT THE

00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,613
>> Laura: ONE PROBLEM, THEY

190
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:10,213
COULDN’T BE SENT HOME.

191
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,016
THEY COULDN’T BE DEPORTED

192
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:13,583
BECAUSE OF THE INSANE

193
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,318
IMMIGRATION LAWS WE CURRENTLY

194
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,186
HAVE IN PLACE.

195
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,222
BY THE WAY, WHICH IS WHY TRUMP

196
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:21,225
IS RIGHT, THE LAW HAS TO CHANGE,

197
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:22,826
CONGRESS MUST ACT.

198
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:23,594
NOT ONLY TO END THIS

199
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:25,829
UNACCOMPANIED MINOR LOOPHOLE,

200
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:27,197
BUT THE CATCH AND RELEASE

201
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:31,335
PROGRAM AS WELL AS CHAIN

202
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:31,735
IT.

203
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,304
SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS

204
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:36,373
ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA NARRATIVE IS

205
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:37,041
BEING ADVANCED AT THIS TIME.

206
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:37,608
WHY?

207
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,375
IT’S BECAUSE TRUMP IS CLOSE TO

208
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,579
MAKING GOOD ON HIS PROMISE TO

209
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,279
TRANSFORM OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS

210
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,982
FOR THE BETTER.

211
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:46,250
EVEN THE LEFT REALIZES THIS

212
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,152
ISSUE IS A WINNER FOR

213
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:49,653
REPUBLICANS.

214
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:50,388
TOM FRIEDMAN, WHO IS A FAVORITE

215
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:54,291
OF THE GLOBAL ELITE, OBVIOUSLY

216
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,793
"NEW YORK TIMES" BEST-SELLING

217
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:56,227
AUTHOR.

218
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,195
EVEN HE THIS MORNING WAS

219
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,330
RECOGNIZING THIS ISSUE AS A

220
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,599
VULNERABILITY FOR DEMOCRATS.

221
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,266
>> I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL

222
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:05,636
THINGS THAT ARE TRUE THAT

223
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:06,904
DEMOCRATS HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH.

224
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,940
WE CANNOT TAKE EVERY IMMIGRANT

225
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,608
IN A WORLD THAT IS SPLITTING

226
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,478
BETWEEN A WORLD OF ORDER AND

227
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:15,313
DISORDER.

228
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:15,780
>> Laura: WOW.

229
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,515
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GO WOBBLY

230
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:19,551
ON IMMIGRATION OR EMBRACE SOME

231
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,619
TYPE OF BLANKET AMNESTY.

232
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,521
THERE IS ONE POINT THAT THE LEFT

233
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,990
AND THE RIGHT SHOULD BE ABLE TO

234
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,925
AGREE ON, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

235
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:30,395
RECENT MEDIA INDIGNATION.

236
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,830
WE ALL WANT CHILDREN TO BE

237
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,265
TOGETHER, UNIFIED WITH THEIR

238
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:34,599
PARENTS.

239
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,135
SO LET’S MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE

240
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:40,038
COUNTRY OF THEIR ORIGIN.

241
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:43,408
IT IS IMMORAL TO ALLOW LAWS ON

242
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:44,075
THE BOOKS THAT INCENTIVIZE

243
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,844
PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN

244
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,913
ALONE INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY OR

245
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:51,249
TO FRANKLY MAKE A DANGEROUS TRIP

246
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:51,783
WITH THEIR PARENTS.

247
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,486
AND UNTIL THOSE LAWS CHANGE,

248
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,754
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WILL CONTINUE

249
00:07:55,754 --> 00:00:00,000
TO BE SEPARATED FROM THEIR
