an English teacher like the country not like the subject though she is a subject because she's English an English teacher has been fired and reported to a counterterrorism agency because she had the audacity to answer her students questions about Christianity she's now a radicalization threat as she told a lesbian student that God loves her that's what makes her a terrorist Amanda how has God loves us become hate speech I don't know I mean they're in this and this report in this write-up apparently there's an atheist teacher who discusses his views openly who said some pretty crazy things apparently he showed the children I don't know what high school I think I don't know how old these high school kids are but he showed them a picture of like a naked woman or whatever he was suspended for three months and now he's back to teaching and like nothing you know that's just like a slap on the wrist but if you have a religious person so you see the extreme bias here happen to say that they you know hold certain views and then tell somebody that God loves them which apparently is harmful you know they're out of there that you know that it's just it's another clear bias that we've seen here in the states over and over and then of course it's really strong on college campuses as we've seen that with Ben all the time right and Josh on this point is this show the silliness and maybe the ultimate futility of a hard separation of church and state do jihadis and Christian teachers who say God loves you pose an equal threat to the public so you're talking about the story from the UK correct yes where she was you know she was at a government-funded school and she talked about her personal views she was asked about Christianity she and she well she she is Christian she is Christians so Christianity is her personal view right I I come from the camp maybe you know I hate to be a contrarian again but I come from the camp where I don't think about the teachers should talk about her religious views at a government fund at school so she can't talk about Christianity she can't talk about the religion of the West well wasn't teaching the segment on Christianity she was asked what are your personal views on homosexuality and she answered and I don't know if that's appropriate at a government-funded school so should she have said I'm sorry I'm sorry you've asked a question about the Christian sexual ethic and even though Christianity is the animating force of the West even though it's the it is the major world religion I can't answer that question because if I answer a question about Christianity the coppers are gonna come in and call me a terrorist that's how we shall run government schools look this straw man I agree I don't think that she should have been reported to a counter-terrorism organization you know that's that's obviously absurd but at the same time you know if you're teaching math or you're teaching you know geometry something else and someone asked question about your personal religious beliefs then I think there's a time and a place for that and from what I read it sounded like she went on a tangent you know this is one and she said a very hateful statement that God loves lesbians that hateful bigoted statement it's a good thing that we didn't have that our scientists weren't selected based on their religious views and our teachers weren't excluded for being Christian in the beginning of modernity because then we wouldn't have had Isaac Newton we wouldn't have had Kepler we wouldn't have had bacon we wouldn't have had Pascal we wouldn't we wouldn't have discovered the Big Bang because George elementra was a Catholic priest that's probably pretty bad we wouldn't have discovered the human genome on and on and on it seems to me a totally false separation between faith and reason between light and truth between church and state
