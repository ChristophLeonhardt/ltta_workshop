kübra post revealing how immoral and corrupt India hello I'm Richard is Bernier at the listening post here are some of the media stories were covering this week a journalist goes undercover in India to expose media companies willing to peddle propaganda dressed up as news for a price Kremlin funded news outlets are feeling the heat in the US but what about Washington's own state-sponsored broadcast operations overseas a real case of fake news the resurrection of a journalist who was reportedly killed in Judea and a music video born in America gets the Nigerian treat everybody Bikram enough we begin in India and one of those stories that should have been major news but was conspicuously absent from television screens and newspapers there perhaps the subject matter was the issue checkbook journalism news outlets for hire cobra post an investigative news site with a penchant for undercover exposé A's posted videos from a secret camera sting operation targeting 27 Indian media outlets including some of the country's biggest the videos show Cobra posts undercover reporter posing as a Hindu nationalist offering to pay media executives to publish some polarizing religious propaganda ahead of next year's general elections this story touches on multiple issues among them paid content disguised as news as well as the ethics of hidden camera operations for their parts some of the outlets implicated say that the videos have been doctored that Cobra Post is untrustworthy however many indian news outlets have credibility problems of their own and it will take more than taking a few potshots at the messenger to make this story go away the listening-posts Meenakshi Ravi now on a story that starts in New Delhi the only news will you are like nothing more than a good steak operation so it is ironic that in a country where entire news bulletins and TV shows are built around such undercover investigations that got caught on camera almost none of India's mainstream outlets reported it the cobra posting targeted some of the country's biggest media groups The Times of India India Today TV 18 The Hindustan Times and the footage produced was damning you have the biggest names in the Indian media from the biggest English group two most prominent news houses but they're very glittering offices and everybody is falling over backwards to accommodate an advertiser who would have editorials come on you know who would sort of shape the narrative please understand hear it the story is not just about big news it is something beyond they agree to defame the political rivals of the client they agreed to take compensation in cash and they even agreed to not only peddle an ideology but also in in many ways to polarize Indian society so in in those thumb this is beyond paid news this is criminal behavior unfortunately it's not surprising I've run a newspaper in India and it was clear to me then that that was happening there are rumors about how you can get a package of editorials written on the topic the way you want it written for money so it's not surprising what is surprising is the amount of money involved the nature of what was being asked to be done which is to kind of really kind of interfere if you will in an election in what is the largest democracy in the world cobra post called is expose operation 136 that number refers to India's ranking in the media watchdog Reporters Without Borders 2017 World Press Freedom Index it's well down the list and has since slipped in the 2018 rankings to 138 cobra pose editor-in-chief Annie Ruth bajalia has a reputation as the master of the sting he's been at it for more than 20 years in 1997 he uncovered rampant match-fixing in Indian cricket in 2000 he ran an investigation of Indian MPs showing how they solicited bribes for defense contracts in 2003 Bajal founded cobra post and has since overseen numerous undercover investigations they have made him rather unpopular in certain circles first thing I do not believe in sting operations as an editor and somebody who is a co-founder of a media company I don't believe in sting operations except as a very last resort and by that I mean when you have exhausted all the options which includes giving the opposite party as many options to response instead of just exposing them suddenly for all the world to see that would be to me tantamount to like a policing operation or raiding somebody without giving them adequate space cobra pose is a small nonprofit organization it is easy game nobody commands when say big chan is like even ask that asked us over the last few years has done basically 70 if not more hidden-camera stories nobody talks about that so I mean it becomes a sort of news angle to chew every time something significant is done and it is really a spurious debate Cobra posts undercover reporter Pushpa Sharma approached his media targets with a detailed proposal and a fake persona he presented himself as Acharya tell an activist straddling the line between politics and religion at the heart of his proposal was a campaign to push Hindutva the brand of Hindu nationalism for which India's ruling party Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP has become known on the tape he made it clear that he was pushing Hindutva to divide Indian voters and that his campaign was timed to have an effect on the general elections coming up in 2019 so in the face is basically India for the Hindus by the Hindus off the handle can be compared to white nationalism and white supremacy so this is Hindu supremacy this entire exercise this whole thing is basically a way of showing you that the media is so eager the media is a willing participant as it were at least that's what you know what comes across in visa videos the same kind of sting for example could have been done with people who did not support the Hindutva or the Hindu argument you see when money goes beyond a certain volume I don't see many of these big media houses saying no had the same exercise being repeated say with people who oppose the Hindu tois the results would have been pretty much the same operation 136 was met with silence from most of India's mainstream outlets they hardly covered it of the outlets targeted for took legal steps obtaining injunctions or issuing legal notices to Cobra Post forcing the site to take down some of its videos the India Tory group whose vice chairperson Calipari was caught on camera said the investigation was quote riddled with irresponsible and brazenly false statements designed to malign the company's reputation India's largest media conglomerate The Times Group took a different tack after his managing director beneath Gen appeared on tape the company announced the video had been doctored and that in fact the Times Group had been conducting its own reverse sting on Cobra Post when the undercover filming took place simply because it's like being caught speeding by a police officer and telling him I was testing your cameras so that makes no sense it's a very poor defense of what was on tape and other media companies have said the tapes are dr. it doesn't show the full picture but what it shows is quite damning I'm not surprised that it has not received the kind of play that the conductors of the sting would have wished a given the antecedents of the journalists and be the way the whole thing was set up ie only targeting a political view I'm not surprised that it got the kind of player did the suspicion that Indian media outlets can be bought is not new so for many the Cobra posting simply confirmed what they had long suspected and it did so at an already problematic time for Indian journalism in the four years of the Narendra Modi government polarization across the media has grown more extreme the voices were shrill the hounding of journalists by online mas self-censorship in newsrooms the kings of journalists especially in smaller cities away from the spotlight of Delhi and Mumbai most of the news about India's media has not been good India's role in the pantheon of free press is continuing to fall to give you an example Afghanistan where there's a lot of terrorism this war and journalists actually being killed in acts of violence is ranked 118 well well ahead of India in press freedom there are media platform promising to influence elections for you and they're licensed companies television companies and license newspapers after the story do you see them giving a public service you don't so that is the essential story about your our public service you are not doing public service in fact you're in creation through criminal acts is everything for this we're discussing other media stories that are on our radar this week with one of our producers Johanna who's Joe at the risk of repeating ourselves there have been more journalists murdered in Mexico that's right Richard two more in the past two weeks actor Gonzalez was a correspondent for Excelsior a national daily based in the state of Tamaulipas in northern Mexico which suffers from some of the worst cartel related violence in the country now last Tuesday Gonzales beaten body was found dumped on the street in the outskirts of Ciudad Victoria in just a few days before on May 24th financial journalist Alesia Diaz Gonzalez was found dead in her home in Monterrey also in northern Mexico and these are not isolated cases are they far from it Richard TSM Gonzales are the fifth and sixth journalists to be killed in Mexico this year alone and the fourth was killed just last month Juan Carlos Huerta was pulled out of his car and shot 12 times in the southeastern state of Tabasco now over the past six years 44 journalists have been murdered in Mexico and according to every press freedom organization there the overriding issue is impunity the fact that killers of journalists are hardly ever brought to justice and then that was that bizarre story out of Ukraine journalist arkady bob chenko first he was reported to be dead then he was very much alive what point was he trying to make but chenko wanted to point out how dangerous it is to be a Russian reporter critical of the Kremlin and President Putin he left Russia just over a year ago saying that he feared for his life and he ended up working in Kiev working for the Crimean TV channel ATR now on Tuesday we started getting reports that he had been shot and killed in what sounded like a professional hits Ukraine's Prime Minister quickly accused Russia of ordering that killing but on Wednesday less than 24 hours later Bob Shengo appeared on Ukrainian TV very much alive at a press conference about his own killing but ahead of Ukraine security services still supported that but Jenkins murder has been staged to expose Russian agents and that those who had allegedly been plotting to kill him and thirty other people had been apprehended but the reaction from other media outlets and journalists seems to have been mostly negative what have they been saying that it was ultimately counterproductive because it could conceivably allow Russia and other governments to dismiss future real events as fake news and it may also undermine the trust in the media the stunt seems to have lent credibility to the argument pushed in domestic Russian media and on channels such as RT that Western news outlets just love to jump on stories that smear Russia okay thanks Joe late last year to news organizations funded by the Russian government Artie and Sputnik were forced to register as foreign agents in the United States at the insistence of the Department of Justice in Washington the DOJ z' orders were issued following claims by US intelligence agencies that the two outlets were part of the Kremlin's alleged interference in the 2016 US presidential election and American lawmakers have since threatened other foreign funded broadcasters including this one al-jazeera with similar measures but what about the flip side of that namely the US government's own state-funded media operations that broadcast to 100 countries in more than 60 languages those stations include Voice of America and Radio Free europe/radio Liberty which have been lauded in some quarters for providing reliable reporting in countries with limited press freedom however like RT & Sputnik they've also been accused of producing propaganda dressed up as news at the service of their sponsors in the State Department the listening-posts Flo Philips now on us state-funded media overseas and the at times muddy waters through which journalism and propaganda flow an American intelligence report finds that one of the weapons in the Kremlin's Arsenal was its state-run news network RT a congressional committee in the US has just revoked Rt America's accreditation on Capitol Hill since our tea in Sputnik news were forced to register as foreign agents back in November 2017 US officials have threatened other government-funded broadcasters like CG TN and Al Jazeera with the same treatment but the US government itself is no stranger to broadcasting into other countries it's foreign media budget stands at 685 million dollars dwarfing the 450 million dollars parceled out to domestic public broadcaster's the foreign media operation is run through the broadcasting Board of Governors the BBG which houses five broadcasting centers under its umbrella the office of Cuba broadcasting based in Miami is home to radio and TV Mukti there's also Radio Free Asia which covers the socialist and communist countries of Southeast Asia and the Middle East broadcasting networks including 24/7 Arabic language TV network al hora but the BB G's flagship stations are without doubt Voice of America and Radio Free europe/radio Liberty as is the case with our tea weather their output is journalism or propaganda depends on who you ask if you look at what our ferl is broadcasting it is news it's information it's moderate in tone it's not propagandistic it may have a stance but the kinds of coverage really aren't that much different than you would find in the Washington Post or the New York Times or rather major independent media the kind of cozy relationship that eventually emerged between Voice of America Radio Free Europe and the propaganda machine Merriweather is a US State Department or CIA is not cozy is just like employees these are state-run the budget comes from the government there is no independence yes news is being communicated but in a way with a selected constellation of news that pushes forward a very particular line of understanding the world one of the questions that has arisen involving VOA and other broadcasters in recent years has been are you simply providing journalism to those people or are you trying to agitate and fan the flames of resistance in any target country you're broadcasting to we shall speak to you about America and the war the news may be good or bad we shall tell you the truth Voice of America was started during World War two by the office of War Information as a vehicle to counter Nazi propaganda today Europe also hears a new and forthright attack on Moscow from the transmitters of Radio Free Europe a privately sponsored American organization which are sales Communism with no holds barred Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty began life during the early years of the Cold War as an opposition broadcasting station to the Communist world their claim that they were privately sponsored was in fact a cover story in truth they were the product of CIA psychological warfare operations and the agency continued to provide their funding and even senior staff until the early 1970s during the Cold War we saw in different parts of Europe there was the same kind of lack of information as people were you know stuck behind the what we call then the Iron Curtain and we didn't know at that point who was listening and we just kept sending this news and information about what was really going on in the world what the outside world was like messages of peace and goodwill are to be relayed to those who had enough of red propaganda and it was only after the wall came down that we began to hear from people and how important that lifeline of news information was for them when these countries got their independence their leaders and their freedom fighters if you will gave great credit to VOA and Radio Free Europe when you look back at the broad history of the Cold War RC and RL played an important role part of it was news but so but part of it was clearly propaganda sometimes that propaganda took these cold warriors well beyond the traditional remit of journalists in the 1960s veteran CBS journalist Edward R Morrow was appointed director of the United States Information Agency or USIA the body within the State Department that oversaw Voice of America Murrow was drafted in to boost the agency's prestige in practice he did more than that this memo from Murrow to the CIA director of the time offered the support of the u.s. IAS Cuba broadcasters to aid the CIA in its efforts to overthrow the Castro government broadcast could urge Cubans Murrow said to engage in relatively safe forms of sabotage if real results were achieved he continued The Voice of America could report these as evidence of opposition to the Castro regime through interviews with refugees and extracts from letters the 1970s saw efforts to create more distance between the government and its broadcasters in 1971 the CIA's funding of Radio Free europe/radio Liberty was revealed and swiftly terminated five years later a law creating voice of America's current charter was passed including a barrier a kind of firewall intended to prevent government interference the firewall is often trotted out as an example of the shield that enables VOA to do independent unfettered journalistic work but the more intelligent and more informed journalists at VOA were always aware that there was pressure being imposed down the line and that pressure could always end up on the desk of a specific writer or correspondent this close relationship between u.s. foreign policy and US foreign funded media continues to attract criticism today US policy towards Iran has vacillated between suspicions and threats of regime change the US government's budget for broadcasting in Iran shared between voice of America's Persian service and Radio Farda an offshoot of Radio Free Europe is estimated at more than 30 million dollars per year the fundamental mission of venues like Voice of America or Radio Free Europe is to pick and choose certain events that have actually happened and package it in a way that dovetails with the regime-change narrative for example late last year we had a series of labor related demonstrations in Iran people demanding living wages and so forth they pick particularly on certain kinds of slogans that say if not tomorrow the day after tomorrow this regime will fall who cannot vouch for the margins and edition of Bitcoin and beyond to fuel this game whose might be on fire dunya we covered both sides of the issue we covered what the protesters were saying we covered what the government of Iran was saying about the protesters we covered what the US government was saying and what we discovered is even though in Iran it's against the law to access our content we found the views of our content go like this before the protests all of a sudden they went like that it is undeniable that US foreign funded media do provide some Public Interest journalism in countries with limited press freedom often a considerable risk to their journalists nonetheless few would deny their status as instruments of soft power from the 1940s until the end of the Cold War the u.s. along with Britain's BBC enjoyed hegemony in state-funded foreign broadcasting but as hard power has begun to shift and new players rise in an emerging multipolar world they too have started to broadcast their perspectives to other parts of the globe this is something that Washington has found difficult to accept by attacking alleged Russian propaganda the u.s. fired a shot in a new cold information war well US authorities wanted a media war and Russia's giving it right back to them so what that means is that the US government funded outlets like Voice of America will probably have to register in Russia as foreign agents a shot that may well have ended up inadvertently jeopardizing their own state-funded media operation finally on the rare occasions that pop music and politics mix and it works the results can be in century us actor writer and musician Donald Glover better known as childish gambino in his latest video this is America have provoked a chain reaction his sometimes shocking take on the ills of black America a video shot in a single take got people talking and has produced tributes from other artists to tell stories about their own countries one of them is Nigerian pop star follower in day Falana better known as faults whose this is Nigeria tackles issues such as drug addiction violence corruption and kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls it's a two point eight million views and Counting we'll see you next time
