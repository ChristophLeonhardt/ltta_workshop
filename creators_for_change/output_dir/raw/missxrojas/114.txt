1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
I come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you in the blue gloom of a</font>

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,210
January evening in Indiana it's um it's

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that late in the day but the light</font>

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,710
goes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you miss it January has always</font>

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,809
been my least favorite month it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark it's very cold it's even colder</font>

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,279
here now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a time of new</font>

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,130
beginnings of refreshes of making

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,740
promises to yourself and it just it gets

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,460
too much it puts too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much pressure from</font>

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,449
the word go and so I decide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put my</font>

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,759
new years in my resolutions in different

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,250
places and I don't judge myself all that

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm not able to achieve in January if I

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,120
or Disney Pixar character I would

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,670
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wooly I am solar powered I</font>

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,520
need the Sun I need the light without<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,020
I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it incredibly difficult to do</font>

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,120
even the most basic tasks and things

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,510
just become harder I just I struggle

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,910
more in january<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do i find it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,899
and sometimes i feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have an</font>

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,570
excuse to every time of year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,489
to an extent that's true you know like I

25
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,650
think that is something quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> pernicious</font>

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,610
about mental health is that you on the

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself it's all not true</font>

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,490
but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand you have all these</font>

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,710
excuses for why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel this way and</font>

30
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,540
that can sometimes stop you from going

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,520
to where you need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get help and</font>

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,250
look after yourself and then in the

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,900
midst of all that you have things like

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,140
Blue Monday which is a day created by

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,090
advertising companies to sell you trips

36
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,250
to Florida or tell you that you need to

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,650
buy this thing and it's just all quite

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,689
depressing really it is and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

39
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,210
that word lightly it's it can be quite

40
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,670
difficult but this year this year I say

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the thing is terrible this year</font>

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was able to spend the first 25 days of</font>

43
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,390
January with some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my closest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

44
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,659
and old friends new friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,340
such an inspiring time I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,860
Indiana feeling so full to the brim with

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,320
ideas that it's so exciting to have this

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,060
feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week before i go into my 10th</font>

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,290
no 11th year on youtube next week I'll

50
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,348
have fun on YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 10 years I just</font>

51
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,060
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even I keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think up</font>

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,910
ways to come

53
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that some weight to make something</font>

54
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">to to share with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means and</font>

55
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,390
to ya too I don't know you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

56
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,370
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a statue to it somehow not a</font>

57
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,320
real Statue but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font>

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that space and you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

59
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">all things it's too big it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much too</font>

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,990
big and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two me and in my life and</font>

61
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,700
what it has meant to me it is it is too

62
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,860
big for that so who<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows who knows what</font>

63
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,900
will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll leave it to chance I</font>

64
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,600
am having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a party</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it because i love i</font>

65

66
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,700
before I love the UK I keep saying yes

67
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">before I left the UK it was such a</font>

68
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,390
wonderful mix of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everyone</font>

69
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,860
could make it and of course you know

70
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,910
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be the case that</font>

71
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,200
always gonna be people who can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

72
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,990
but it was such a strange and bizarre

73
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,260
and brilliant mix of people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube</font>

74
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,110
in 2006 or I've stayed friends with to

75
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,420
publishing people who are work with and

76
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,610
do fun projects with and who introduced

77
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,490
me to books that i adore and meet people

78
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,670
I lived with strong walks of life and

79
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,170
university people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secondary school</font>

80
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,560
people and primary school people it's

81
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,900
it's amazing it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel very</font>

82
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,480
lucky very very lucky so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,490
light escapes me entirely I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

84
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,920
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about what's coming up</font>

85
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,410
at the end of 2015 or maybe with the

86
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,240
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2016 I can't exactly</font>

87
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,220
remember i read a wonderful piece by

88
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,740
rachels<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm there was about creation and</font>

89
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,840
it was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> grimes for one as well but</font>

90
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">a link in the description bar below it</font>

91
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,930
was about owning things and funding

92
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,720
things and making things and having a

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of agency over every aspect of what</font>

94
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,820
you create or many aspects what you

95
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,660
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hasn't been afforded to</font>

96
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,360
people all recognized for such a long

97
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,400
time and and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i dono a</font>

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">strident kind of indignant independence</font>

99
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,410
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> power and where power comes</font>

100
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,500
from and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how its distributed and it's</font>

101
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,630
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice and who's given a voice in</font>

102
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,040
who isn't and that's something that's

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,290
very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be in my mind as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i go</font>

104
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,229
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new year and this new year</font>

105
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,930
that keeps going that doesn't begin or

106
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,680
end

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,960
I read the first it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so cheesy</font>

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,820
to say but I believe that every moment

109
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,070
can be in a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> every moment can be a</font>

110
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,660
new start you don't have to exist within

111
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,449
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework that you're given for your</font>

112
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,699
expectations for yourself and for your

113
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,130
life something that I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year</font>

114
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,110
a lot its I'm I've started so many more

115
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects but I want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and put</font>

116
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:51,039
them out there one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who was</font>

117
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,780
at my party<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my friend Clarissa who</font>

118
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,910
I've mentioned many times she works for

119
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,340
ebru press penguin Random House but

120
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,470
she's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wonderful person type of</font>

121
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,000
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> with because she reads in</font>

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,620
much she listens to so much she engages

123
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,259
in conversations siren leveled it is

124
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,300
astonishing to me really it's so

125
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,310
impressive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she would just have these</font>

126
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,930
wonderful ideas and she'll connect these

127
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,940
things together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she gave me a book</font>

128
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,770
called originals by Adam grant which

129
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,360
they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video about further down</font>

130
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,090
the line but part of what that made that

131
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,590
book so good is when it talks about

132
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,210
making things and putting them out there

133
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,710
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font>

134
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,660
i love doing during blog mess and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

135
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a rediscovery every now and</font>

136
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,530
then all I rediscover that I love

137
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,240
sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and that I love putting</font>

138
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,039
them out there because I'm so sometimes

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,659
trapped by fear and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of</font>

140
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,130
you've said the same like you don't want

141
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,659
to share things it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

142
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you think they'll get stolen or</font>

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,380
someone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your idea but</font>

144
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,460
because you think it says something

145
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,550
about yourself and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

146
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,169
vulnerable when you share something for

147
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,180
me the remedy to that has just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

148
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,729
share more shower a lot put it out there

149
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,710
put out on the world and that's that's

150
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,270
what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing so I'm going</font>

151
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,710
to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a video every single day</font>
