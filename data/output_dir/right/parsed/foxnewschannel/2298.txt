THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH
THE CARAVAN COMING UP.
ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?
STEVE: WE ARE CERTAINLY
WATCHING.
BREAKING TONIGHT, CUSTOMS TURNED
AWAY A CARAVAN OF MIGRANTS
TONIGHT.
HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE
GATHERING THERE LOOKING ASYLUM.
THEY WILL LIKELY TRY AGAIN
TOMORROW.
THEY CALLED THE GROUP A THREAT
AND URGING FAMILIES TO GO
THROUGH PROPER LEGAL CHANNELS.
JOINING ME NOW IS ANN COULTER.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU, STEVE.
STEVE: LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON DOWN AT THE BORDER
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE CARAVAN?
>> WELL, I WISH TRUMP WILL STAY
ON THE ROAD LIKE HE WAS IN
CAMPAIGN MODE AGAIN.
HE GETS INSTANT FEEDBACK FROM
THE CROWD AND THAT'S WHEN HE
SAYS REALLY POPULAR THINGS THAT
GETS REPUBLICANS ELECTED AND
COULD DEFEND AGAINST A BLUE
WAVE.
THEN HE GETS BACK TO WASHINGTON
AND HE ISN'T DOING ANYTHING
ABOUT THE CARAVAN.
HE SENT OUT A TWEET SAYING DON'T
WORRY, THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT
HAS STOPPED THE CARAVAN.
THE DAILY MAIL GOES AND SAY WE
ARE GIVING THEM 30 TO 20 DAY
PASSES.
THEY ARE SPREADING OUT SO THEY
CAN GO TO DIFFERENT ACCESS
POINTS.
THEY ARE 100% STILL COMING.
THEY JUST HAVE TO STEP ACROSS
THE BORDER.
THEY HAVE A LOT OF LAWYERS FROM
COUNTRIES WITHOUT BORDERS.
THEY ARE ADVISED AND TOLD WHAT
TO SAY.
THEY STEP ACROSS AND SAY ASYLUM
AND THAT'S IT.
THEY WILL GET SHIPPED IN AND GET
ANOTHER ROUND OF MS-13.
TRUMP HAS A LOT OF POWER.
HE WAS THE ONE ELECTED.
IT'S REPUBLICANS AND CONGRESS
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HATE.
IF HE WANTS CONGRESS TO PASS
THIS LAW IT WOULDN'T BE VERY
HARD.
JUST SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND
NOT MAKING SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH
KOREA GREAT AGAIN THEN HE COULD
DO SOMETHING FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
YOU DON'T GET TO STEP-IN AND
CLAIM I'M CLAIMING ASYLUM AND
GET A BUS AND BOX LUNCH TO
AMERICA.
STEVE: THERE IS ALSO THE POINT
ABOUT THE WALL.
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING MORE
DIRECT.
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
HAPPENING.
>> NO, I MEAN THERE IS A REASON
THAT'S THE CHANCE.
IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT HIS
FAMOUS MEXICAN RAPIST SPEECH
ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY HE
THROUGHOUT TAX CUTS, OBAMACARE,
THE MILITARY, BLAH-BLAH-BLAH.
IT WAS FROM GOING OUT AND GIVING
THESE SPEECHES AND HAVING A TEN
THOUSAND PERSON FOCUS GROUP
EVERYDAY OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT HE
SAW WHICH LINES WERE THE POPULAR
ONES.
THERE IS A REASON THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE UNLIKE THE DONE
PEOPLE UNLIKE THE DONORS WANTED
A WALL.
YOU DON'T CHECK WITH THE PEOPLES
WHO JOBS WILL BE OBSOLETE.
WE DON'T JUST NEED MORE DRONES
AND BORDER POLICE.
WE WANT IT TO STOP THE HEROIN
AND CARAVAN.
HIS NUMBER ONE DUTY IS TO
PROTECT THE BORDER.
IT'S NOT TO RESOLVE NORTH AND
SOUTH KOREA'S DISPUTES.
THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.
NORTH KOREA IS CHINA'S PROBLEM.
SYRIA IS THE TRANSITS PROBLEM.
ARE EUROPEAN NEWS PAPERS
CONSUMED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH THE CARAVAN.
ARE CHINESE NEWS PAPER WORRIED
ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING
INTO AMERICA?
NO, WHY ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT OUR
PROBLEMS.
>> YOU ARE THE TRUE PURIST.
I LOVE IT.
YOU MENTIONED JOBS EARLIER.
YOU NOTICED SOMETHING IN THE
RALLY LAST NIGHT THAT HASN'T GOT
PICKED UP THAT MUCH.
LET'S PLAYER AND I'LL GET YOU
REACTION ON THE OTHER SIZE.
>> FOR THE FARMER, OKAY, IT'S
GOING TO GET GOOD.
WE'LL LET YOUR GUESSWORKERS COME
IN BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE STRONG
BORDERS.
WE HAVE TO HAVE YOUR WORKERS
COME IN.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE IS SO
STRONG WE HAVE TO LET PEOPLE
COME IN.
THEY WILL BE GUESSWORKERS.
THEY WILL COME IN AND HAVE THE H
2 B'S COME IN.
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.
STEVE: WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
>> WELL, PLEASE NOTICE IT'S DEAD
SILENCE THROUGH THE ENTIRE
BLATHER UNTIL HE GETS TO THEN
THEY HAVE TO GO OUT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
YOU TELL ME.
THE WAY I REMEMBER WE DIDN'T
ELECT JEB BUSH.
I WAS COMPLETELY SURE WE ELECTED
DONALD TRUMP.
WHERE HE GETS THIS NONSIS.
THE H 2B HE'S TALKING ABOUT ARE
THE WORSE YOU CAN COME UP WITH.
THEY AREN'T FARM WORKERS.
THEY CAN BUILD ROBOTS.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU USED AN ATM.
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO MOVE
INTO THE 20th CENTURY.
IT'S FOR WORKING AT PLACES LIKE
THE RESORTS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND
CONSTRUCTION.
THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS I'LL ADD
NOW THAT HE AND KANYE ARE
BONDING.
HE GAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL SPEECH IN
MILWAUKEE SAYING TO
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHAT HAVE THE
DEMOCRATS GIVEN YOU?
GIVE US A CHANCE.
THIS IS HOW YOU WOULD GETS
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND ALL
WORKING-CLASS AMERICANS A
CHANCE.
THEY DIDN'T ASK FOR A TAX CUT.
THEY ASKED FOR JOBS.
THESE ARE JOBS AND HE'S TELLING
THEM IN A RALLY TO BRING IN H2B
WORKERS.
THAT WAS THE WHOLE DISNEY THING.
I HEAR THESE SPEECHES AND ALL I
CAN SEE IS A HUGE BLUE WAVE.
A BLUE TSUNAMI.
THERE IS STILL TIME.
TRUMP CAN BRING BACK ONE PEACE P
TRUMP CAN BRING BACK ONE PEACE E
OF GOOD NEWS.
YESTERDAY WE SPOKE ABOUT AN
ARTICLE THAT TRUMP IS
DISREGARDING THE ADVISE FROM THE
LOSER REPUBLICANS I.E. PAUL
RYAN.
HE FINDS THESE ISSUES BOARDING
AND WOULD PREFER TO TALK ABOUT
IMMIGRATION AND TRADE.
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO STOP A
BLUE WAVE.
>> A LOVELY MOMENT OF UNITY TO
