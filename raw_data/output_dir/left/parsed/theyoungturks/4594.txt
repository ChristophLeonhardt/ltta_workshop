UNLESS YOU HAVE
BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK YOU ARE
FAMILIAR WITH THE FOLLOWING
VIDEO THAT PRES.
TRUMP TWEETED
OUT ABOUT HIS NEMESIS, CNN.
>> DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT OUT
WITH THE #FRAUDNEWSCNN.
THAT WAS A CLIP WE CAN ATTRIBUTE
TO A REDDIT USER WHO WAS VERY
EXCITED WHEN HE FOUND OUT THE
PRESIDENT WAS USING HIS WORK.
THAT WAS ON A THREAD THE DONALD
WHICH WAS A SUB REDDIT.
PEOPLE
WENT ON TO SEE SOME OF HIS OTHER
WORK.
INCLUDING A NEW YORK TIMES
CONTRIBUTOR, HE DUG UP SOME
OTHER MEMES BY THIS CREATOR.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
HERE IS ONE
FROM THE GUY TRUMP TWEETED.
THIS
ONE SHOWING CNN PERSONALITIES
WITH JEWISH STARS.
THAT IS JUST
THE BEGINNING, THERE WERE OTHER
ONES THAT HE TWEETED OUT.
BUT
FOLLOWING THIS ON TUESDAY HE HAS
SINCE TAKEN DOWN AN APOLOGY AND
DELETED HIS REDDIT ACCOUNT BUT
WE DO HAVE SOME SCREENSHOTS OF
HIS APOLOGY.
PEOPLE ON REDDIT
ACUTE CNN OF BULLYING HIM OR OF
BLACKMAILING HIM MORE
THREATENING TO RELEASE HIS
PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ORDER TO
GET THIS APOLOGY.
THAT WAS SHOT
DOWN BY ANDREW KACZYNSKI WHO IS
THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING TEAM
FOR CNN.
ONCE THE INTERNET HAS A
HOLD OF THE IDEA IT WENT ALL THE
WAY.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT AN
EXAMPLE OF THIS.
THIS REACHED A
TIPPING POINTD RECENTLY WHEN A
CONTROVERSIAL PRO-TRUMP ACTIVIST
SHARED THE PERSONAL DETAILS OF
MULTIPLE CNN EMPLOYEES – HE WAS
RELEASING THEIR INFORMATION.
WE
WILL NOT SHARE ANY OF THAT.
THIS
IS GETTING OUT OF HAND.
I WANT
TO GET A REACTION FROM YOU GUYS
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THERE IS NO END
TO THIS.
NO ONE BELIEVES HIS
APOLOGY, PEOPLE BELIEVE IT WAS
MADE UP TO GET THIS TO GO AWAY.
>> THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE PARTS
AND I AM ON DIFFERENT SIDES.
WE
ARE HAVING SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY ABOUT
A GUY NAMED HANS ASSHOLE SOLO.
>>IF YOU READ THE STAR WARS
BOOKS THAT IS HIS ACTUAL MIDDLE
NAME.
>>ONE OF THE BELOVED
CHARACTERISTICS OF HAN SOLO IS
THAT HE IS KIND OF AN ASSHOLE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ASSHOLE.
HE'S JUST HAN SOLO.
>>WHEN IT WAS BLANKED OUT ON
CNN.COM IT WAS HAN EFFING SOLO.
>>LET'S NOTE THAT THE ORIGINAL
TRUMP TWEET WHERE HE CALLS CNN
FAKE AND FRAUDULENT IS A VIDEO
THAT IS FAKE AND FRAUDULENT.
IT
IS NOT ACTUALLY DONALD TRUMP.
IT
IS A GUY IN A TRUMP WIG, THEN
THEY CUT AND TRUMP GETS UP.
>> IT IS ALSO WITHIN WRESTLING
WHICH EVEN IF IT WAS THE REAL
DONALD TRUMP WOULD STILL BE A
FAKE FIGHT.
>> AND IT IS NOT ACTUALLY CNN,
IT IS VINCE MCMAHON.
AND FINALLY
WE FIND OUT THAT CNN HAS AN
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING TEAM.
THAT IS THE MOST INTERESTING
PART OF THE STORY.
OVER THE
WEEKEND EVERYONE IS GOING NUTS.
THIS IS DONALD TRUMP INCITING
VIOLENCE AGAINST REPORTERS.
I
DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
REGULAR
AMERICANS WATCH WRESTLING,
INCLUDING ME.
WHEN YOU EQUATE
WRESTLING WITH REAL VIOLENCE
THEY GO – THESE GUYS CAN'T TAKE
A JOKE.
IT FEELS LIKE THE BOY
WHO CRIED WOLF WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CRY WOLF, THE DUDE IS A
WOLF.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO NUTS
OVER THIS TWEET.
ON THE OTHER
HAND, DOXING AND BLACKMAIL
ALLEGATIONS FOR CNN – I SAID
THAT IN A VIDEO OVER THE
WEEKEND.
I HAVE BEEN CLEAR.
BUT
THIS NEW TWIST, CNN DIDN'T
THREATEN TO BLACKMAIL THE GUY.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF THE FACTS,
YOU ARE SUCH AN ANNOYING PHONY
POLITICIAN.
WHAT CNN DID DO IS
THEY SAID THEY KNOW HIS IDENTITY
BUT WE WILL KEEP IT SECRET
UNLESS HE DOES THIS KIND OF
STUFF AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK THAT
IS UNREASONABLE.
IF YOU PUT OUT
STUFF LIKE THAT AGAIN, OF COURSE
I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TELL
PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE.
THEY DID NOT
SAY I WILL PUT OUT HIS HOME
ADDRESS SO YOU CAN GO THREATEN
THE GUY PERSONALLY.
CNN NEVER
SAID THAT, THAT IS DOXING.
YOU
HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO
BE AS RACIST AS YOU WANT TO BE.
WE SHOWED YOU THAT ONE
ANTI-SEMITIC THING WHICH IS
ABOUT AS ANTI-SEMITIC AS IT
GETS.
HE ALSO HAS TONS OF STUFF
AGAINST MUSLIMS.
HE HAS TO GET
HIS STUFF ABOUT MEXICANS, THAT
DOESN'T COUNT ANYMORE BECAUSE
HALF THE COUNTRY IS RACIST
AGAINST MEXICANS.
BUT THE
ANTI-SEMITIC STUFF COUNTS SO HE
WITHDREW IT.
WHEN THE
RIGHT-WINGER THAT GRACE QUOTED
TURNS AROUND AND ACTUALLY DOXES
CNN, THAT IS A THREAT TO THEIR
LIVES.
WE HAVE A TOTALLY
UNBALANCED CONVERSATION IN THIS
COUNTRY WHERE ONE SIDE PLAYS BY
REGULAR RULES AND LAWS, AND THE
OTHER SIDE DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN.
DON LEMONS LIFE IS IN DANGER, I
DON'T CARE IS WHAT THAT GUY IS
SAYING.
I HAVE DONE 1000 VIDEOS
CRITICAL OF DON LEMON AND WOLF
BLITZER BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I
WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HOME ADDRESS
WHO DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.
>>THAT IS WHY I THINK WHEN YOU
GET DOWN TO IT IT IS IMPORTANT
TO FIND.
THAT SEEMS LIKE A
VIOLATION OF THE LAW, TO
DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION WITH
MALICIOUS INTENT.
IT DOES PUT
SOMEONE'S LIFE IN DANGER.
I HAD
NO DESIRE TO FIND OUT ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PERSON WHO POSTED THE
ORIGINAL MEME.
I AM SEMETIC – IT
IS STRANGE TO SEE THAT AND SEE
THE INSTINCTIVE CNN.
>> LET ME AGREE WITH BRETT
COMPLETELY ON THAT.
A SIDE PART
IS WHY IS CNN WHICH APPARENTLY
HAS AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM,
INVESTIGATING THE MOST RELEVANT
THING OUT THERE?
INVESTIGATE HIS
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
THERE ARE
SO MANY THINGS TO INVESTIGATE.
AND SAID THEY WENT AND SOMEHOW I
AM UNDER THE IDENTITY OF THIS
GUY.
WHO CARES WHO MADE THE
MEME.
DOES IT MATTER?
I GET THE
GUY AS ANTI-SEMITIC IN A
TERRIBLE GUY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
REVEALING HIS IDENTITY.
I CARE
THAT YOU DON'T REVEAL HIS
PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION.
I
THINK IDENTITY IS DIFFERENT.
WHY
DID YOU BOTHER?
>> I HOPE IT WAS EASY.
BECAUSE IF IT WAS DIFFICULT AND
THEY PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO
IT, THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.
>>IT IS DISHEARTENING THAT WHEN
HE ISSUED AN APOLOGY SO MANY
PEOPLE SAID THERE IS NO WAY HE
COULD THINK THAT WHAT HE WAS
POSTING WAS A BAD IDEA.
A LOT OF
THE STUFF WHEN YOU GO THROUGH,
MAYBE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT HIS
IDENTITY, BUT THE OPINIONS THAT
HE WAS PUTTING FORTH HAD AN
AUDIENCE.
THERE IS A WHOLE
COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE IN THIS SUB
REDDIT THAT REALLY AGREED WITH
HIM AND LIKED HIS POSTS.
PEOPLE SAID THAT HE WAS
BLACKMAILED AND THAT HE
WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.
THAT IS WHAT IS SAD ABOUT THE
STORY.
>> I LIKE HIS APOLOGY BY AND
LARGE.
I WAS NOT EXPECTING A
LENGTHY APOLOGY.
I DON'T LIKE
HOW HE SAID I AM IN NO WAY THIS
KIND OF PERSON.
YES YOU ARE.
YOU
ARE BEING CALLED OUT, YOU ARE
THE PERSON WHO WAS LIKE I AM
GOING TO POST THIS MEME OF ALL
THE JEWS AT CNN.
I THINK THE
MOST INCRIMINATING PART OF THAT
MEME- IS THAT ALL HE HAD TO DO
WAS ADD THE JEWISH STARS.
THIS
IS ACTUALLY A SCREEN From A
PANEL ON CNN.
THIS WHOLE THING,
THEY HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE.
THEY
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE.
GLAD I
WENT OUT ON THAT LIMB FOR THAT
JOKE.
>>LAST THING ON THIS, BRETT IS
RIGHT AGAIN IN THAT – AND GRACE
AS WELL, IN THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE
ARE RALLYING TO HIS DEFENSE.
LIKE HOW DARE YOU EXPOSE THE
IDENTITY OF THIS ONLINE TROLL.
APPARENTLY THEY DON'T THINK IT
IS THAT TERRIBLE.
WE HAVE UNITED
STATES SENATORS JUMPING INTO THE
DEFENSE OF THIS HORRIBLE GUY.
THERE IS NO BLACKMAIL HERE.
THEY
SHOULD NEVER BOTHER TO 
LOOK INTO
THE GUY IN 
THE FIRST PLACE.
BUT
YOU ARE TELLING ME 
THAT WHEN HE
SAYS I 
AM NO WAY THIS GUY, MAYBE
YOU GUYS THINK RACIST JOKES
ABOUT MEXICANS, THAT IS FUNNY.
AND A LOT OF 
PEOPLE MAKE THOSE
JOKES.
YOU 
DON'T ACCIDENTALLY
SLIP UP AND PUT THE STAR 
OF
DAVID NEXT TO ALL 
OF 
THE
REPORTERS ON CNN AND SAY THAT
WAS JUST A FUNNY –
THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT.
IT IS SOMETHING YOU DID ON
PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU THINK
THE JEWS CONTROL THE MEDIA.
THIS 
IS THE GUY WE ARE STEPPING
UP TO 
DEFEND AS AN AMERICAN HERO
WHOSE IDENTITY SHOULD NOT BE
REVEALED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE?
I THINK YOU SHOULD PICK NEW
HEROES.
