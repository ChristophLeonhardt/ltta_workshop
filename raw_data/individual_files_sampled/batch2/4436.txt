gonna be joined by phone by NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams who has now read the full set of Comey memos Pete your highlights from what you've been able to study in the memos sure so remember we've heard all this three times at least once in commis written statement before he testified after he was fired again when he testified and then again in the book and I guess you could say four five six seven eight times and all his interviews but a few things that were not in the book or his testimony the fact that in the dinner with the president on January 28 mr. Trump said he had serious reservations about Mike Flynn's judgment he talks about an episode when the president was toasting Theresa May and saying she was the first call after his inauguration to congratulate him and that's in a Flynn interrupted to say no she wasn't the first and then the president later criticized him for not telling him earlier when Theresa May had called and according to the memo the president pointed his fingers at his head and said the guy has serious judgment issues then in the meeting on February 8th at the White House he says the chief of staff Reince Priebus asked do you have a FISA order on Mike Flynn and that Comey paused and then answered he doesn't say what the answer is but said in the future you should get the answer from me directly here's how you get it on the thing that you just talked about a moment ago pardon the expression Putin saying we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world meaning the US the memo says the President did not say when Putin told him that and he says I don't recall and then finally the other thing that stood out to me as new is the February 14th White House meeting where the president asked can't you let this Flynn thing go they talked a lot about leaks and the president said that the way to stop leaks is to put reporters in jail according to the Comey memo that mr. Trump said we need to go after them we need to refer to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they knew and it worked and he said the FBI director they spend a couple of days in jail making him friend and they're ready to talk and the company memo says I laughed as I walked to the door that Reince Priebus had opened and Pete the response so far from as only a few Republicans we have three Republicans devin newness trey gowdy and chairman Goodlatte Bob Goodlatte of the joushi airy committee and they are saying what they are finding in these memos is what they say wasn't said that they're insisting that these memos never show that James Comey believed that he was being obstructed and that had that his work was being obstructed or that he felt quote obstructed or threatened that is their reading of the memos well nor has mr. Comey ever said that directly about the conversations what he has said and what he suggested in the book is that his firing which of course comes after these memos and the fact that the president tried to get him to call off the FBI's dogs on Mike Flynn could constitute obstruction but he said that's a legal judgment somebody else will have to make they also say that the idea that the president wanted the cloud lifted was not a reference to interference in the election but it was a reference only to the salacious allegations in the steel dusty a I'm not sure that that's entirely clear and I know that mr. Comey himself has been asked about that it does seem that it's possible to read the memos also to say that it's the it's the and it's the suggestion that there was a connection between him or his senior campaign people and the Russians the Russian meddling issue the centerpiece of the Moller investigation I think it's possible to read the memos and think the president is referring to that is the cloud Pete Williams thank you very much for joining us and having the time to have done a complete reading of these memos really appreciate your input Pete thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over this list to see lots of other great videos
