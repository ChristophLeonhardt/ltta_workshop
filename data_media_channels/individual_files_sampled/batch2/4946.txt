for more I'm joined by you Michel sitter sitting here why tell scars pondered for the PBS news hour and an MSNBC contributor Michael Eric Dyson the author what truth sounds like RFK James Baldwin and our unfinished conversation about race in America a beautifully written book and actor and comedian Sinbad thank you for joining I want to start with Michael Michael I love your book it's about the conversation what is this whole thing with this triad of Roseanne Barr who did the bad thing here ABC that fighter for doing the bad thing and President Obama who like he did with Charlottesville the President Trump and like he did with Sean Ville seems to be taking sides against ABC and for Roseanne that's the way it sounds to everybody well we got a bigot in chief well we got a racist in residence that's what it is he is unleashed some of the most horrendous viewpoints bigotries and racism in this country he's legitimated them he's validated them he said look it's it's okay come out the closet stand up and speak straightforwardly and tell the world what you believe and you will be defended by political bluster and notice in his tweet he said nothing about the horrendous statement that Roseanne Barr herself admitted initially was unforgivable explained nothing about that he said why did he do it he because he wants to have it both ways he wants to certify and validate the quiet bigots who are afraid to stand up and speak out and at the same time he wants to get at the other side for its bigotry and for its jumping on him so he's able both to exact to exonerate those people who believe what Roseanne believes and then to validate their anger at a Bob Iger in the left so it's a brilliant ploy but it's cynical because it doesn't play to the better angels of our nature this is not bobby kennedy this is not jack kennedy this is not even Barack Obama this is the base cesspool bigotry of American society this is the underbelly of our worst instincts amplified by a man who continues to tweet bigotry day in and day out he has turned this nation into a psychic commode in which into which he dumps all of his nasty beliefs let me ask uh Sinbad your community this was an actor I'm asking you her defenses it was a bad joke calling or saying that jared is the daughter of an aunt of an animal and a terrorist that was just a joke what do you make of it now you know we can't hide his artist behind bad jokes I mean we tell bad jokes bad jokes mean you don't get a laugh I mean first he said once you put ape and a black woman together the first time they called Michelle Obama ape it was on a regular basis we all know they've called us Apes throughout our lives and our careers and it still happens so that's you can't hide behind that matter of fact I have more respect if you just stand with it if you used to drive around the rosanna rosanna was my friend we drove mad fact when Roseanne first came to Hollywood she asked me to find her a black female manager and then as as time goes on these kind of tweets come out and I'm like this I don't know what you're coming from I don't know what you're trying to say with it but it's not what you used to do so when I say bad joke don't say bad joke we can't hide behind a bad joke if you say it you said it and go with it it's not a bad joke it's racist well why is the president you mean she can you start with a cover this you suffer this Prez there's a slave you suffer this president I think he's doing what he did in Charlottesville on both sides he refused uh Turley to come out against the white supremacist and here he's refusing to offend his 20% of the country which I think has these attitudes I'm just guessing about 20 percent I think like the birtherism stuff liked all that trap crap and he doesn't want to offend them well there's a long narrative a president Trump playing the victim and here's President Trump playing the victim yet again and using Rose M bars tweet a racist tweet to then say you know what I'm really the problem here it's all about what the problem is really with me and how I've been treated but I think when we go back to see our sisters turn a racist president trumpets obviously had a problem with race right like I don't have to take off all the things that he's done but charlottesville is just the start of it when you talk to Jesse Jackson al Sharpton people have known him for decades there's the Central Park five and the fact that he's never apologized for saying that they should get the death penalty so he does not do this he does not even know the Padres the DNA cleared they even they've obviously been exonerated with with DNA but the point is that President Trump doesn't apologize for anything we've talked about this on your show before she and her cohort why is Roseanne Barr now part of his I refuse to apologize gig well Roseanne is trying to act like Donald Trump except everyone that tries to act like Donald Trump realizes that they're not Donald Trump acts the governor of Missouri who had to resign yesterday you tried to double down and try to kind of live through these scandals and then you realized that no one but Donald Trump can happy Teflon the way he is okay according to Washington Post named one of the tweets bars sent a rose mint Roseanne Barr but later deleted she wrote I'm sorry for my tweet and I will also defend myself as well as talk to my followers what does she got a religious thing about it my followers so go away if you don't like it I will handle my sadness the way I went through I'm tired of being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse she also quit Fox News commentator Herman Cain that was seen that 999 guys saying even though the show was a ratings success forces with an ABC didn't like the fact that her conservative the fence up certain things was so popular why did the president states I know you're an academic Michael tell me about this I've been looking up the phrase I remembered from man for all seasons about Thomas Moore his silence consent throughout much of today the president same thing about this and they jumped into with both feet taking basically her side against ABC why do they take this crap if you will into the White House with him it's now in the White House as of tonight this this issue it is silence has not only consent silences complicity there's an active agency of wrongdoing here the president is siding with Roseanne fully in her initial responses before her admission about ambien and whatever drug the drug she was taken as I said earlier she's taking big at all and the symptom of that is a you know uncontrollable racist talk but the reality is that yes she is saying he is taken into the White House but the heat this is what got him to the White House what we don't want to confront what we don't want to admit is that as you say at 20 percent at least of American voters who voted for this man believe what he believes think that black people are taken over brown people are are in in our myths the racist lawyers saying you people speaking Spanish so we got border problems we got boundary problems we get problems with people who are trans and and so all the others are ganging up on us is like a horror show to whiteness and so they feel now that these people are attacking them and they're big chief defender is in the White House speaking boldly and broiled bravely for them not recognizing a he doesn't care about you it's just like with Roseanne you think she cares about the 200 people who lost their jobs if you're concerned about others and those who are on your side those people lost their jobs this is what Donald Trump is not telling the truth to his followers and his the people who vote for him that you are undermining the economic stability understand the intellectual argument either way on this that somehow black people are taking over America they were here before 90% of us were here of white guys just a mad tribal about it everybody knows that let's go to freakin history that most African Americans came here the descendants of slaves going back to what the 1700s at least and they were all here before before but European Americans always got here you know what Gore Vidal said we live in the United States of amnesia people deliberately forget that look the south what lost the war but they won the battle of memory and so now they are really telling America that hey things are bad things are worse black people are taking over and we know that we've been doing all how did we get called lazy and we did all the labor that's the kind of chance because the shot is a I guess this roses it was I honestly psychologically and politically and commercially do not understand why did she commit suicide to make a racist point racist point said but this was a highly expensive tweet she's finished now her comeback is gone all the people working on that show are gone ABC is gonna lose a lot of money they could have made and it would have walked into their pockets it was a money machine that show there's no logic to this there was he wanted to rule the world what do you get out of this but Donald Trump is talk Donald Trump is not logical man a work for him because a lot of illogical people a lot of races came out America he said well people have to hide remember it used to be had to put the hood on your head now he told the Klan take the hood off universe run around with your sheet on so what's happening right now is Roseanne didn't lose much she still be rich Rose amber several money keeping the show will lose some money so I think like with Eric my guys are saying is people allowed to speak now they think no harm will come to them they think they're like Donald Trump and they're like Teflon not look at it ABC took a big shot when they put Roseanne on the air we know that she's very vocal we know she said some things before there's really out there so when they put her on the air that was a chance you were always taking that's why they put the clause the contract could you get fired to chauffeur get canceled if you said something that offended the community well you you that's what they were open no that is hoping they were hopefully gonna have this hitch so you can have this controversy and and nothing would happen well it's the time bomb you time bomb in the room with a timer eventually it goes off and and that's what happened well she's a receipt she's done this number before this this animal motherhood thing where she said Susan Rice another prominent african-american woman was the daughter of apes if you will and my question is it and that would be careful about this I watch like you and I did we watched together the rise of Trump the first thing he sent up his mouth was the president itíd States was an illegal immigrant basically so I used to have friggin some weird theory had then a white woman from Kansas went over to Africa to have the kid had named them Barack Hussein Obama with the idea that 35 years later he'd become president it was crazy talk and then he started to go after Mexicans and saying they were all rapists and do that and went after that judge then they went after every Muslim it's saying that their altars he gradually developed this tribalist development of support using all those code words everything else right but that but Roseanne has got nothing out of this but paying the hell the Jews well that's that's kind of what Sid Ben was talking about this this idea that everyone thinks they're Donald Trump all these a Republican seat they could be Donald Trump they think that they can kind of be crass and get away with things they think that Ron and Roseanne saw Donald Trump so he's the leader of pan of this whole thing I think that he's absolutely a unicorn that people are saying now why did you say really quickly she picked on Valerie Jarrett that is someone who is an educated black woman who stands for super-hard who's eight years in the White House so she picked also on someone who maybe she didn't realize with someone who had the power to take her down she's highly educated Susan Rice yeah but I think I think had she said this about someone who is maybe a black farmer a black middle-class person someone who worked at Ford maybe ABC would have thought differently who knows but I think that the fact that it I thought that the Valerie was very good about that she said I can defend myself I have peeps yeah she said I'm in a position I could defend myself a lot of african-americans I'm glad we had this great discussion tonight even that was an awful reason to have it seem bad it's great to have you on the show sir thank you and thank you Michael the book is beautifully tonight I read a lot as you know and you know I was here in academic you know how to write brother that is really beautifully done I love you to scripture the James Baldwin meeting where they gave held of Bobby Kennedy he thought he was going in there to get the Nobel Peace Prize from these people these intellectuals they shoved it at him and it was the best thing ever happened to him
