the media asked whether it's time to repeal the Second Amendment Democrats say the NRA is responsible for the Florida school shooting and Republicans shoot down a bunch of immigration proposals we'll talk about all of it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show obviously the tragedy of the Parkland school shooting is still on everyone's mind and every time there's a massive shooting like this whether it's Las Vegas or whether it is Sandy Hook we now go into a predictable cycle of outrage where folks say things that are ridiculous they impute motives to other people that are ridiculous and then those people fire back and it becomes highly irritating well we're gonna talk a little bit about some of those arguments today Jimmy Kimmel of course jumped into the fray so we'll have to deconstruct what he says I'll stop deconstructing Jim Jimmy Kimmel on politics when he stops talking about politics on a late-night show we are also going to be jumping into a column that was written by Bret Stevens a year ago but it's now being passed around the internet again about repealing the Second Amendment we'll get to all of that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at

first refill pack free at get quip comm slash up hero again that's GE t qu IP comm slash apparel get quip comm slash up hero go ahead and check that out well worth the time and money okay so the fallout from the from the shoot a couple of days ago continues as well it should and again it's the circular argument that has become highly irritating to everybody involved in which people on the left scream do something people on the right say well what would you have us do and then people on the Left say well if you're even asking that question it means you don't want to do something that seems like the cycle of logic that is applied here so Jimmy Kimmel of course is the leader in in being the sort of emotional the emotional avatar for the left so he goes on his show last night and he of course talks about the shooting and pushes hard for gun control with his usual caveats and freak-outs about the NRA another senseless shooting this time in a high school in parkland Florida were a gunman a former student opened fire yesterday again 17 lives have been lost more than a dozen people are hospitalized tell your buddies in Congress tell Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and Marco Rubio all the family men who care so much about their communities that what we need are laws real laws that do everything possible to keep assault rifles out of the hands of people who are gonna shoot our kids go on TV and tell them to do that okay go tell people what to do and what we need laws and what are these laws gonna be and you don't leave the Congress works for us they don't work for the NRA this is one of the the things that he was pushing the idea the NRA was responsible get to that in a minute again all of this is just designed to make you believe that Jimmy Kimmel has a plan Jimmy Kimmel doesn't have a plan people on the Left don't have a plan and if they do have a plan it really is to confiscate guns now the minute that you say that about people on the Left they get very upset no no we just want reasonable gun legislation but then they can never name what the reasonable dozen legislation is because if they were to ban assault rifles the reality is the vast majority of killings that are done with guns in the United States are not with assault rifles assault rifles are responsible for West murders in the United States then hands or knives when when people on the Left say well what if we would just do better background checks we have full background checks in the state of California and that has not stopped the Isla Vista shooting it did not stop the San Bernardino shooting again the problem with these targeted gun laws is that what people in left really want if they were honest about they would say this Piers Morgan when I was on with him in 2013 he refused to say it but then he finally came out and he was honest about what they really want as a UK style government seizure of vast amounts of guns that is not going to happen in the United States they tried it in Australia they tried a gun buyback program only 1/3 of all the guns that were turned in in Australia they still have a murder rate in Australia with guns people are still they'd still gun buybacks it is illegal to own a gun in Australia and yet people still owned guns 2/3 of the people who owned it before still owned it in the United States if you were to grandfather in all of the guns that still are there there are 300 million guns in the United States so that would not actually solve the problem you're talking about because a lot of the guns that are that are in hands of people who are going to commit school shootings in the future are already in those hands I'd say it actually have to go around conference getting guns good luck trying to take guns away from 42% of the American public who say 42% of households say that there's a gun in the house or there's a gun in my house and the the the government would have to come to my house and take it from me I'm not gonna offer it back in the government buyback and either as anybody else who owns a gun those are those programs are wildly unsuccessful so what the left really is talking about is full-scale gun confiscation so along those and you see that right way at the school vigil there's that there's a vigil at the school and this chant broke out no more guns now I don't know what that's supposed to mean no more guns are you gonna take away the ones that people already have you can take away from from law-abiding citizens and then CNN the rest of the media they spend an awful lot of time bringing on victims of shootings to talk about what gun policy should be so CNN featured a grieving mother I'm never in favor of this by the way I think that it's always a mistake to have grieving people talk about policy because I don't think that your grief is relevant to the policy considerations at issue you do not have the added legitimacy it's a form of emotional identity politics you do not have added legitimacy on the topic because as a blank write as this is what Steven Pinker it suggests his identity politics he has a white man as a black woman as a grieving mother as soon as you say that a grieving mother has more moral legitimacy to speak on gun control than somebody who studied the issue all their life then you are throwing away reason in favor of emotion in any case here's this mother and I obviously have nothing but sympathy for the mom and that's why CNN is putting her on the air you say what can you do schools what can you do you can do a lot this is not fair our families our children go to school I just spent the last two hours putting the burial arrangements for my daughter's funeral miss 14 president Trump please do something yeah obviously it is horrifying to watch minutes it's just terrible to watch this this grieving mother but when she's screaming at Trump to do something what the question is what Trump is supposed to do the President of the United States doesn't have unilateral authority to seize guns in the United States the President of the United States does not have unilateral authority but even metal detectors which which is by the way a proposal I agree with on school grounds I think that security should be up at all schools as I said yesterday having armed guards at every school is not a I failed to understand why this is even remotely controversial but the reason that's the bigger question is not about the mom I understand where the mom is coming from everyone with a heart understands where the mom is coming from the question is why is CNN spending airtime on this and the reason that CNN is spending airtime on this is because CNN wants to manipulate viewers into responding emotionally to an issue that actually requires thought and and reason as opposed to an issue that requires emotional response you notice that CNN never does this by the way with victims of terror attacks and then will never go to victims of terror attacks after there is an ilanic terror attack for example and they won't have the victim of the terror attacks family go on TV and say we need a travel ban at CNN we'll never do that because that doesn't agree with CNN's agenda the point here is that it's exploitative for the media to put grieving people on television simply in order to make a certain political point it's something I object to generally it's something I object to on the specific level and I think that it's it's something that really needs to stop and again they were doing this with students as well see and then put a student on TV to talk about why this is somehow on Rick Scott's Rather's MSNBC doing this well you know again it's a slew of emotion it's anger it's fear and confusion it's grief and I've just been trying to channel those all together and into some sort of mad inspiration I'm trying to get the message out that it is important to grieve but it's also to make sure the bad guys feel this natural and make sure everybody knows that their votes count on this it's my stupid lief that the blood of those 17 people is on rich hands okay so some some how it is it's not rich Scott its Rick Scott and somehow the blood of the people who died in parklands on Rick Scott's hands why is it on Rick Scott's hands when it when a nutcase who apparently police were called to the house 39 times this is the new report the police had gone to this guy's house 39 times and there was no involuntary commitment of this person who apparently when he was a child was even put in a facility for violent juveniles right obviously the system failed here but what that has to do with gun control is is a little bit beyond me now folks on the left if they're really honest they will say what they really mean what they really mean is they want to confiscate all the guns and so let's talk about that in just a second whether or not all the guns it should be confiscated but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at bull and branch so we're never going to agree on everything when it comes to politics but we can all agree on the need for a good night's sleep so that we can all wake up refreshed and ready to do battle in the morning that's what bull and branch is for you don't need a new expensive mattress or sleeping pills to get a great night's sleep but you do need is bull and branch

them know that we sent you as well okay so there are some folks today who are being a little bit more honest about what it would take to really get to the gun for utopia they want and that of course is repeal of the Second Amendment so Barry Weiss reporter over a staff writer over the New York Times who has ripped earlier this week we talked about her she was ripped earlier this week for being supposedly too conservative for saying that immigrants get the job done after she did she tweeted that about the daughter of immigrants rather than immigrants themselves and she's ripped up and down by members of the New York Times staff well she tweeted out repeal the Second Amendment and then she tweeted out a column that's written by Bret Stevens a year ago in October of 2017 a few months ago in October 2017 after the Las Vegas shooting I believe and that column was titled repealed the Second Amendment so let's go through that column because it's about as good an argument as you will hear for repealing the Second Amendment and it is not a very good argument at that so Bret Stephen starts off that column by joyriding what he calls the conservative fetish for the Second Amendment so why exactly would conservatives support a private right to own weapons for the protection of life and liberty after all Stephen says quote from a law-and-order standpoint more guns mean more murder now this actually is not true him more guns in certain places mean more murder more guns in Vermont do not mean more murder more guns in rural Texas do not necessarily mean more murder Stevens cites a study in the American Journal of Public Health from 2013 to show the quote states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearms related homicides but there's only one problem with the study this examines the statistics on a state level which doesn't make any sense given that virtually all murder in the United States takes place not on the rural not in rural areas of states but in the big cities and in those big cities there are very harsh gun laws in the big cities that's more nearly all murder in the United States place in in big cities so there's very little link actually between state law and state homicide rate as eugene pollock of the Washington Post pointed out beyond that that same study that he's citing that says that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearms related homicide there's one problem with the study the single largest variable when it comes to murder rate is not actually gun ownership in these various states the single largest rate which the study tries to bury the single largest problem is that the the highest correlation is between the number of black people in a particular state and the number of homicides this is not a racist point okay people are not murdering other people because they are black that's obviously a stupid notion but if you're gonna look at what is statistically relevant and you're gonna look at factors that are statistically relevant the number of black per the number of black people in a state are more irrelevant than the number of guns in a state right this is according to the study quote for each one standard deviation increase in proportion of household gun ownership firearm homicide rate increased by twelve point nine percent for each one standard deviation increase in population of black population in proportion of black population firearm homicide rate increased by eighty two point eight percent the study tried to bury that data by not showing it in the actual text of the study so if you love that study so much then you should recognize that there are variables that have significantly more impact than gun ownership rate and that has to do and we can talk about why there's a higher homicide rate in the black community that there is in the white community a lot of it has to do with under policing the black community that has been a matter of systemic discrimination since the since the 1800s where white communities basically said the black communities fend for yourselves and that's been inculcated in particular areas of the culture but that's not the point the point that I'm making is that if you are going to suggest a gun ownership is highly correlative with gun death then you have to look at other factors that are highly correlated with gun death and see that these statistics are not nearly as significant as you think they are Stevens continues by stating quote from a personal safety standpoint more guns means less safety he then cites the fact that more people are killed every year in accidental firearm death and in self-defense shooting situations but that's not a proper statistic either because the times that people use a gun in self-defense far exceed the number of time actually shoot somebody to death in self-defense the goal of having a gun in your home is that you can pull it out I mean I know there's a woman around the corner and she was at home and there's a guy who tried to break into her house she went and got the shotgun from the back room well rather she screamed the guy ran away the police came they told her what you should do next time that happens is do you have a gun in the house she said yes they said go get your pump-action shotgun and then the shotgun right give me the church do that near the door and the guy will run you want a problem now that would not show up in any of the statistics that are being measured by the CDC it would not show up as a use of a gun in self-defense because you didn't actually point them to somebody didn't actually shoot somebody didn't actually wound somebody but this sort of stuff happens all the time and there's a widely varying set of statistics on how often people use guns in self-defense this way according to the national self-defense survey extrapolations people use firearms and self-defense millions of times a year that may be too high Bryan's already a reason has an exhaustive analysis of whether it's hundreds of thousands of times a year or millions of times your but it's certainly not 268 justify all huh it's justifiable homicide by firearms that is not the full measure of the number of times people actually use guns and self-defense in the United States so Stephen then moves on to D riding the philosophy of gun ownership he says that the idea that we can protect liberty by having guns in the United States that we can protect from foreign threat by having guns in the United States is a quaint idea well I wonder if it's such a quaint idea after Afghanistan after Vietnam the fact is that small arms gun ownership and guerrilla warfare have been successful at the warding some of the greatest powers in the history of humanity the United States in Afghanistan and Vietnam and the Russians in Afghanistan for example those have been thwarted by IEDs and small guns these are not being thwarted by necessarily top-level military weaponry finally he goes on he says that the idea that an armed citizenry is the ultimate check on the ambitions and encroachment of government power is silly and then he says well look at the Whiskey Rebellion that wasn't a government check on it a check on government power except that it sort of was the Whiskey Rebellion which happened in the late 1790s it was directed at an internal whiskey tax placed by the federal government there are a bunch of people who grew corn for whiskey and they were very upset that the whiskey tax was affecting them and there was an armed revolt and was put down with violence a couple of people were hung in it and so he says well that that showed that it that there was a failure of armed insurrection except for the fact of course that President John Adams may have lost the presidency in 1800 based on that and that President Thomas Jefferson then immediately went about revoking the whiskey tax so it obviously had a pretty significant political impact in fact you can even look at today right there is a there's a big hubbub over clive in bundy you remember this there's nearly an armed standoff with the federal government over clive in bundy's territory where clive in bundy wanted to feed his cattle on land that he historically grazed cattle on and the Environmental Protection Association the EPA agency rather they came in and they said that this was terrible that he couldn't be grazing his cattle on this area and they tried to find him then they tried to seize his farm then clive in bundy refused to go along with the arrest and a bunch of people showed up and refused to along with the arrest as well well there was just a jury nullification that happened and cliven Bundy went free the Bundy family went free and now there's been a major political push in the United States to get the EPA out of the business of regulating so much land so yes armed insurrection is not all worth while sometimes it's terrible the Civil War was a terrible terrible thing but the idea that having lots of people with guns does not somehow check the ambitions of the federal government is obviously nonsensical the reason that we're not really talking in serious terms about full-scale gun confiscation is because you try that crap in Texas it ain't gonna go well Stevens then turns to the active shooter phenomenon he says that such situations are extremely rare in the rest of the world which is true it is also true that they are extremely rare here in the United States as well so John lots website the Crime Prevention Research Center he goes through the annual death rate from mass public shootings comparing the European countries to us in Canada and he did it on a per capita basis so one of the things that happens is that the United States is compared to Britain for example they say oh there are lots more shootings here than there are in Britain right we're a much larger country than Britain when you actually look at the death rate per million people from mass public shootings from 2009 through 2015 according the Crime Prevention Research Center the number one country was Norway because they had that horrible Andris Brevik shooting and then it's Serbia France Macedonia Albania Slovakia Switzerland Finland Belgium Czech Republic and then the United States how about frequency I forget about the number of dead how about frequency of mass public shootings so if you look at the frequency of mass public shootings from January 2009 to December 2015 per million people in order it's Macedonia Albania Serbia Switzerland Norway Slovakia Finland Belgium Austria Czech Republic France and then the United States the average incident rate for 28 EU countries is 0.06 0 - with a 95% confidence interval of zero point zero two five seven two point zero nine four seven seven in the u.s. rate is point zero seven eight higher than the EU rate but the US and average for EU countries are not statistically different in other words we're having about the same number of mass shootings as they're happening in other countries and we have significantly more guns so this idea that everything lines up is just not statistically correct again the case for full-scale gun confiscation is particularly weak especially in a country where you have as I say some 300 million guns and a hundred million gun owners finally he says that leftists are losing the gun control debate when they lie about the facts which is true and that they and that they should stop talking about quote-unquote common-sense gun control and they should just repeal the Second Amendment he says gun ownership shouldn't be outlawed it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection either right it never occurs to Stevens that the fundamental argument in favor of owning a gun is protection of life which is the fundamental right that you have in a state of nature according to both the founding fathers and John Locke and that the reason you have a gun is to protect your own life and protect your own Liberty and a state powerful enough to confiscate weaponry on a grand scale is a state powerful enough to end your rights as well other rights not just your First Amendment rights as stevens finishes by saying the true foundation of American exceptionalism should be our capacity for moral and constitutional renewal not our instinct for self-destruction but that's not true at all the true foundation of American exceptionalism is the idea that we built a system on unchanging human nature human nature has not changed and the idea of having a complete monopoly on gun ownership over to the federal government is a scary one or should be a scary one to anyone who loves Liberty okay when we continue here in just a second I want to talk about the the NRA because the left is going nuts over over the NRA so let's talk about that okay let's begin with Nancy Pelosi so Nancy Pelosi of course has decided that the NRA is fully corrupt and that they are the ones deciding America's character here is the house Minority Leader whose political survival and this body is more important than the survival of our children for example most recently yesterday Sandy Hook for example or on the streets of our cities who of us and here is more important whose political survival is more important than that nobody's nobody so we have to be bold we have to go forward and we cannot let the National Rifle Association and its many however they get their money and that's another subject to decide what the character of America is yeah this sort of Kabuki theater in which Democrats participate is quite gross they did control the Congress with 60 votes in the Senate as well as a majority in the House and the presidency from 2009 to 2011 and here is the grand total number of major gun legislation pieces they passed zero okay the answer is zero this is what Democrats always do they don't want to touch these issues because they think their political winners instead they wish them to fester if Democrats really thought the gun confiscation were a thing they could have moved in favor of it in 2010 in 2009 into the they didn't do any of those things instead they sat around and waited for Republicans to take office again and then they rail against the Republicans supposedly being in the pay of the NRA they did the same thing with illegal immigration we'll get to that in a little while Democrats have been saying that illegal immigration daca deeply important things didn't do anything on illegal immigration while they had control and now the Republicans have controlled they're railing against Republicans this is the game they play but I want to go to a core view that she's talking about here and it was repeated across the media that the NRA is in control of our politics that the reason that we haven't had a vast gun confiscation or new gun laws passed is because of the evils of the NRA which is paying people off MSNBC's Stephanie ruhle said the same thing she suggested that it's just because Republicans are being paid off by the NRA President Trump tweeted his prayers adding no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school well the NRA spent more than 21 million dollars supporting President Trump in his 2016 election almost 10 million dollars in ads and other pro Trump material and 12 million bucks attacking Hillary Clinton the thoughts and prayers are with the victims the dollars and cents are another story yeah so the the idea again is that the NRA is responsible for everything bad happening in Congress because didn't paying people off Jimmy Kimmel said the same thing last night he had said that the that the NRA had Congress's balls in a money clip which is just absurd last night he said somewhere along these line along the line these guys forgot they work for us not the NRA us and this time we're not gonna allow you to bow your head and prayer for two weeks until you get it all clear and you move on to the next thing we're gonna make sure you do something this time well no you're not because the vast majority of the public is not in favor of the do something mentality the vast majority of the public is in favor of perhaps some measures that would do something here but you have to name the measures but let's discuss the underlying claim Rob Reiner did the same thing he said there are 21 million reasons why Donald Trump refuses to protect our children from being slaughtered by guns the NRA has deep pockets but we will show them that our hearts and our pockets are deeper than theirs our hearts Reich the NRA is heartless because it says that ball abiding citizens should own guns you think the NRA is in favor of these school shootings you think the NRA wants these things to happen you think the NRA is indifferent to all of this and when we last had a major shooting which was after that after that church shooting in Texas when the guy who put down the shooter was an NRA mm the media conveniently ignored all that who's an NRA instructor because in in their crusade to make it seem that the NRA wants to get hands and guns in the hands of bad people they ignore the fact that the NRA ensures that good people can have their hands on guns but this money point is so stupid that Donald Trump is only pro NRA because the NRA I spent some 21 million dollars on the on the Trump election cycle you know much money was spent in that election cycle like a billion dollars was spent in that election cycle they did the same thing Stephanie ruhle did the same thing by the way with with Rob Portman in Ohio she said that in the last 30 years Rob Portman received some three million dollars from the NRA Rob Portman in his last senatorial race spent 30 million dollars so the amount of money he's received from the NRA is not 10 percent to what he spent on one election cycle and this is true across the board okay so how much money does the NRA actually spend first of all the NRA spent approximately 13 million dollars on all candidates between 1998 and 2016 13 million okay that is according to PolitiFact that is not according to me that's PolitiFact the left's favorite fact checker the NRA I spend money on outside expenditures this would be their own PACs and spending money on ads in the amount of one hundred and forty four point three million plus another forty five point nine million on lobbying which is a grand total of two hundred and 3.2 million on political activities over 18 years or approximately twenty two point six million dollars per two year election cycle the NRA does spend a lot more during presidential election cycles according to open secrets the NRA spent some fifty four million dollars on twenty two in 2016 on politics that would be on issue ads across the country that be unloving that would be an organizing all the rest so that sounds like a lot of money right fifty four point four million dollars in 2016 on politics and they really are the entirety of the gun lobby hey so-called gun lobby is basically the NRA there are a few other organizations like the Gun Owners of America but those are much smaller organizations so let's look at some other segments of politics and where money gets spent so according to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research how much did labor unions spend in 2016 alone they spent one point seven one three billion billion dollars on pallulah political activities in lobbying for 2016 alone so the NRA I spent 50 million and the labor unions spent one point seven three to seven one three billion billion okay that means that they spent like three percent of what the what the labor unions spent that's an insane number but it doesn't matter they're gonna continue to proclaim that the NRA is those powerful force in politics it's also interesting the unions spend this much money you never hear about the idea that these that these Democrats are being paid off by the unions that the unions are paying off Democrats in corrupt fashion there's a lot more evidence of that and there is that the the Republicans are being paid off by the NRA the Republicans are being elected by the NRA to to presumably be pro-gun but they were pro-gun before the NRA was there if the NRA I disappeared overnight there'd be five million donors who join another a gun organization and that gunner organization would be lobbying when it comes to the unions it's a different story unions are very often in the business of giving money directly to candidates and then sitting there and actually making deals with the candidates for their union members which seems a lot more corrupt to me how about play about the abortion industry in 2016 2008 between sorry 2012 and 2016 Planned Parenthood spent 34 million dollars on outside spending according to open secrets emily's list another abortion group spent thirty three point two million dollars in 2016 alone so the abortion Lobby is spending about as much as the gun lobby but you never hear that Planned Parenthood is paying off the Democrats in rear the Emily list is paying off the Democrats group spend a lot of money but the notion that the NRA is disproportionately buying politicians it's just not factually true which brings us to a deeper question do these outside groups actually buy politicians or are they simply backing politicians who already support their agenda you have to show the politician who switched his position from anti-gun to pro-gun after the NRA jumped in Donald Trump knew that the American public and particularly Republican primary voters we're not gonna stand for an anti-gun position in shift for the NRA money but it's always easy to have this this ridiculous theory there's someone out there some evil nefarious force who's spreading money in the back room and that's why and that's why gun control hasn't prospered the reason gun control has not prosper in the United States is because it's deeply unpopular when you come down to the specifics that is why it is not because of NRA money the NRA is popular because people don't want large-scale gun control it's not that people don't want large-scale gun control because the NRA has lots of money it's a Miss read of the situation on a grand scale folks for all the talk about gun control in a piece of breaking news from The Wall Street Journal the FBI has now said it mistakenly investigate a credible and specific tip about the teenager charged with storming into the florida high school and killing 17 people in a statement the FBI said it received a call on a tip line from a person close to the shooter the caller provided information on quote his gun ownership desire to kill people erratic behavior disturbing social media posts as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting the information should have been assessed as a potential threat to life it was not forwarded for investigations leave me at the FBI's Miami field office and no further investigation was conducted so well done FBI for all the talk about how the government is necessary in order to remove guns from 300 million via for 300 million guns in American society removed guns from a hundred million people across the country the FBI can't even track down one damn lead that says everything you need to know about the guy who went in and shot up a school you know talk about government malfeasance and government incompetence start there you know talk about helping to solve this problem start with the government actually following its own rules start the governor actually doing what it's supposed to do the government sucks at everything they prove it once again and the idea that I'm gonna hand over my gun to this government they're gonna protect me you have got to be kidding me okay in just a second we're gonna talk about immigration proposals that happen yesterday plus the president doing some

through it with the government through the daca system that's not actually gonna happen in all reality not much is gonna change on March 5th except that people will not be given new work permits essentially in the United States if they are illegal immigrants there are four bills that were brought up yesterday in the Senate all of them died they were all dead on arrival because Democrats are not willing to compromise on these issues so here are the bills there was the John McCain Chris Coons bill that was touted as a moderate reform measure it never made it out of debate that was that that basically was a was a proposal to give permanent residents to permanent residents to recipients of daca immigration program in return for 110 million dollar annual grant for increased border security it specifically excluded any funding for a construction of a wall on the southern border that one did not make it out of committee second proposals Pat Toomey's proposal from Pennsylvania Republican that he proposed the u.s. cut off funding for sanctuary cities in sanctuary states like California until those cities and states agreed to share current information with federal immigration authorities according to Emily zanotti over at Daily wire 54 senators voted to put that bill to a full Senate vote but to me couldn't get any bipartisan support and it died in debate and then there were two more proposals that actually came up for a formal vote the final two proposals were dueling agreements on daca and the border wall one was from the White House and when we were from Senators Mike rounds Republican from South Dakota and senator angus King independent from Maine but he's really a democratic caucuses with the Democrats the bill traded a path to citizenship for Jackel recipients for border enforcement and even twenty five billion dollars for southern border security construction projects but included a conditional amnesty for daca parents and it was popular among members of both parties but 54 senators only voted for the bill because Trump came out and said that he was not in favor of the bill the White House had called it a blanket amnesty and refused to take part in the groups negotiations well so sure as Ted Cruz yesterday ripping into the rounds bill suggesting that it was simply too weak so you don't even like the president's four pillars listen that is dramatically to the left of where Barack Obama was Barack Obama and which was executive amnesty it was illegal it was unconstitutional daca covered six hundred and ninety thousand people why on earth are Republicans trying to more than double nearly triple that for physics a more accurate answer it's a more it's a more accurate number you know tell that to the steel workers tell that to the truck drivers tell that to the American people we promised we wouldn't do amnesty so basically Trump turned against a lot of his own proposal after his base didn't like it which is fully predictable the White House bill was presented by chuck Grassley that bill included a path to citizenship for daca recipients conditioned on twenty five billion dollars in financial support for a border wall Grassley's bill didn't make it to the floor but even Republicans from reticent to vote for the deal and it failed 39 to sixty so that means that nothing has gone forward here Democrats did not vote with Republicans in order to pass the 60-vote threshold they were given a vote and they voted against both of those proposals so yes a lot of Republicans voted against Trump's proposal but Democrats should have universally voted for those proposals if they thought that it was gonna stand the rounds bill got a vote they got 54 votes in fact but the Democrats were not willing to allow it to go to a full vote right there was a filibuster that was in place so they needed 60 so well done Democrats not compromising once again Trump did blame the Democrats for this of course but yeah his leadership on this was was less than stellar shall we say but he did prove by the way that the Democrats were not fully consider doesn't really matter cuz Democrats had nothing to lose here anyway Democrats were always willing to let Trump go all the way down the line then reinstate daca informally they're fine with that they want to make Republicans look both heartless and incompetent and they will succeed probably in that task okay time for a quick Trump investigation update or or Trump scandal update so a couple of stories out today one stormy Daniels the porn star who says that she had sex with Trump she says that she kept the dress that she had on when she was being nailed by Trump and so she still has all of his DNA on it I didn't know this was a thing by the way like apparently Monica Lewinsky do this and now stormy Daniels - this is the thing that if you have sex with a famous dude that you get to that you keep the clothing very weird thing I've never never heard of anything like this except apparently it seems to be happening a lot that is one story other story is that apparently the National Enquirer spent $150,000 on a story about Trump having an affair with a Playboy Playmates this is well he was marrieds Milania who is being cooked so often it makes your head swim and she was cheating on her repeatedly of course not a shock and apparently the National Enquirer because the editor over there is friends with Trump bought the story and then buried the story which of course is not shocking either the woman's name is a mcdougal Katherine mcdougal I believe and a Karen McDougal Karen McDougal so Karen McDougal was played by playmates she had an affair with Trump and she has a long series of contemporaneous diary notes that suggests that this was happening of course the White House says this didn't happen that's not true of course it probably did happen a lot of King David and going on a lot of people out there and in in religious land saying well he's just like King David no he's not just like King David the whole point of King David is that he repented there is no repentance here yuck okay time for some things I like things I hate in the mailbag so things I like so this was Valentine's Day week so as Valentine's week so here is what many people consider to be the Rome the most romantic theme in the history of modern music this of course is Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini okay so there it is that's used most for most frequently here of this because of the movie somewhere in time which was which started Christopher Reeve back in 1980 was a big hit at the time so it's worth listening to the whole piece it's actually a really great piece the Rhapsody on the theme of Paganini the romantic theme is only about two and a half minutes of that okay time for a couple of quick things that I hate so number one University of Minnesota I'm supposed to speak there week after next and they have apparently exiled me to a building off campus for safety reasons it's like a 400 500 seater as opposed to the 1500 seater that was requested they are having a simultaneous event on the main campus at University of Minnesota sponsored by the Women's Center about anti racism in the era of Trump because I was apparently a Trump supporter and a racist I am neither of course so that was weird but they're having that in the middle of the campus so apparently no safety concerns when lefties are holding a counter event to my event but serious safety concerns when I hope my event which means I have to be exiled once again demonstrating the hecklers veto in full effect speaking of the hecklers veto my friend steven crowder apparently has now been banned from DePaul University so just like I've been banned he and I both been banned from DePaul University and he was supposed to do an event there and they preemptively ban him they've said that his comedy videos are obviously intended to demean and insult which if you've ever seen Stephens show is true because he's a comedian I can name a comedian who did not demean an insult and I will name you a not very funny comedian so Stephens been banned from DePaul University so congratulations to Steven on joining the list of those of us who can no longer travel to that great University okay final thing that I hate so LeBron James went after President Trump yesterday and said the president Trump doesn't give a bleep about the people this prompted Laura Ingraham to go on a on a diatribe against LeBron James here here's what LeBron James had to say straight oh how did you describe the climate for an athlete with the platform out don't want to talk about what's happening in all the world what a climate is hot the number one job in America the point of person is someone who doesn't understand the people and really don't give up other people when I was growing up there were like three jobs that you look for inspiration or you felt like these were the people that can give me life there's the president United States it was whoever was the best in sports and then it was like the greatest musician at the time you never thought you can be them but you can grab inspiration from I felt like I can be you know it was a neighborhood african-american cop and he was cool as he'll come around you get awful I could be hell yeah I could be him but I never felt I could be the president United States but I grabbed inspiration from that and this time right now with the President of the United States it's at a bad time and while we cannot change what comes out of that man's mouth we can continue to alert the people that watch us that listen to us as this is not the way no listen LeBron has ever ability to speak out about these things and he's obviously got a big platform and people listen to what he say what he says I don't think it makes him a political expert by any stretch of the imagination when he points out that the president has not done a good job of connecting with a lot of people in the United States this is obviously true during the election cycle it was true after the election cycle so there's some truth to this I'm not as a as a general rule in favor of people who have not spent a fair bit of time studying politics speaking with authority about politics I will say that what LeBron is saying here there's an element of truth to what LeBron is saying here with regard to the president's capacity to reach out to people he needs to do a better job of reaching out to people but it would help if people would also reach out to the president meaning if LeBron reached out to trump and said you know I want to start a dialogue with you I think that would be more useful than him sitting there and griping about Trump per se although listen he has every right to do it okay time for some mailbag stuff oh yeah you know one more final thing that I hate I would urge everybody to go back a couple of days ago I did I did a long monologue about Black Panther which I have not seen yet I'm looking forward to seeing it this weekend I hope if I have time and and then I want to give you my my honest opinion about it the entire monologue was critiquing the media's response to Black Panther suggesting because the was basically suggesting this his end of world right this was the most important thing that has ever happened in the black community according to members of the New York Times there were two separate major op-eds in the New York Times about the importance of Black Panther as a cultural moment and all of this that's what I was ripping it's being taken out of context in Kathy Newman hey Kathy Newman was of course the person who interviewed Jordan Peterson and just kept retwisting what Jordan Peterson was saying is being Kathy Newman go back and watch the original monologue you'll see exactly what I meant what I was talking about specifically was that I don't believe that people should get deeply excited about racial solidarity issues I think racial solidarity is a mistake whatever the race I think that religious solitary is one thing philosophical solidarity is one thing but racial solidarity is is generally a tribal affiliation that I'm not fond of and I'm the media portraying this is the essays a major massive cultural moment I thought was wildly overblown as I said a couple of days ago that was the main point of that to go back and watch it if you don't believe me okay time for some mailbag entries so David says hi Ben I listened to your analysis of the school shooting yesterday I agree with your insights are you aware of any objective studies on causation of mass shootings that study societal factors in addition to gun laws for example single-parent homes violence in movies and videogames social media secular culture etc mental health is often cited as well if there has been a significant deterioration in mental health and what is driving that I'd be interested in your perspectives - well I don't think there's been a significant deterioration of mental health by statistics although more Americans are now on antidepressants than at any time in American history by a fairly significant margin the the problem is that whenever you look at these shootings and then there's studies about the shootings the sample size is simply too small there are not enough mass shootings for you to gather any sort of trend line other than a rough trend line so what we can see is that a huge number of these mass shootings involve people who are deeply mentally ill and about whom there were red flags so if there is an increase in school shootings I'm not sure that you can attribute that to greater rise in the number of people who are mentally ill in the United States but you may be able to say that where we should be looking if we want to stop school shootings is among people who are severely mentally ill or schizophrenic for example violence gets a furnace kazama scripts for mr. violent and people who have evidenced threats against neighbors people who have acted oddly in other words look for red flags the question is what's the goal of the study is the goal of the study is to suggest measures by which we stop mass shootings then we ought to be looking at what best fits the trendline as opposed to broad societal trends because let's say that it were single motherhood for example that Cora single motherhood does correlate highly with with general crime but it doesn't correlate as highly with mass shootings for example I'm Trey Martin says hey Ben I read an article this week in a major newspaper that showed how historically all countries have utilized some form of trade protectionism including the u.s. in its early stages my question is if all countries do this and in particular since China is doing it how can we realistically keep our competitive lead if we and only we insist on a purist approach to free trade well the way that you keep your competitive lead is through a purist approach to free trade it means that all the inputs in your industry are cheaper so let's say for example that we put no tariffs on anything but China tariffs the crap out of our products they are taxing their own citizens and let's say they tax their own citizens to dump all of that money into steel undercutting our domestic steel industry which is kind of what's happening and what's it they do that so now steel is cheaper on the American market so that means that American auto manufacturers are using that steel to make products cheaper than they will be able to make those products in China in other words protectionism is almost universally linked with subsidies to a particular industry subsidies to a particular industry mean taking from one potential industry and giving to another potential industry it means you are taking China is taking money from an industry that would thrive on free trade and is instead giving that money to an industry that does not thrive on free trade namely the steel industry for example well that's not good for China may be good for trying to steel industry it's not good for China's overall economy what is better for an overall economy is to take cheap inputs and use that to make the most competitive products and then out-compete people despite terrifying by the way if you tariffs your own country if you raise tariffs to a high level that does not make your country stronger it makes your country weaker you take this to its logical extreme if you tariffs to everything at a hundred percent in the United States meaning that everything you buy had to come from the United States we would all be significantly poorer because we'd all have to spend a lot more money on products we are used to getting for cheap that would not Ford competition it would not Ford style of life it would not make your life better josh has Durbin do you feel conservatives are gaining ground in US culture what are your barometers for measuring cultural chefs I do think conservatives are gaining ground in u.s. culture you can see it particularly on issues like abortion and I think a lot of that is because of the fragmentation of media the fact that the media is no longer controlled top-down the fact that there are literally hundreds of thousands and millions of people who engage with the show every single day way like a million engage with this show everyday and there's no gatekeeper and if you want to watch the show you watch the show it's not that there's somebody go to green like me over to network that demonstrates I think the cultural shift and it's happening in entertainment terms as well fewer people going out to see the the media approved movies more people staying home and watching what they want to watch taking movies the warrant hits and making them hits on the back end it's really it's really fascinating to watch Eric says do you think the government needs to diversify from a two-party system well I'm not sure it's a matter of the government diversifying I think the American people might be better served by more parties unfortunately the system tends to favor a two-party binary system now the thing in favor of a two-party binary system is it creates a certain level of stability usually in multi-party systems those are usually linked with parliamentary systems where you need a majority to govern the minute there's not a majority to govern no coalition to govern then everything falls apart you have to have a new election this creates tremendous instability in these systems and it means that it's very hard to get anything done yeah there's there's a fair bit of gridlock particularly around dismantling social programs for example because there's so many particular interests represented so they're there their costs and benefits is what I would say there Panagiotis is that husband outs ah Haven I'm a high school student in Canada and most of my political education is colored by a certain point of view could you explain to me what a right-wing dictator would look like is there credence the idea that Hitler was a right-winger okay so in order to explain what a right-wing dictator would look like you have to distinguish between the right wing in Europe and the right wing in the United States so conservatism in the United States it makes it it is impossible for there to be a conservative dictator in the United States because conservatism is essentially classical liberalism meaning small government is baked into the cake you could theoretically have a dictator who said I'm not gonna control everything and right-wing dictator would look like a minimalist King maybe and somebody who says go about your daily business and I'm just here to make sure that you don't kill each other that's what a conservative dictator would look like but it's it's very difficult to think of that actually happening because typically in monarchies the idea of a small government monarchy is extraordinarily rare it's in fact I can't name a single instance in which that has happened usually when people say right when dictator they really mean people who are anti-communist so Hitler was considered anti-communist and whose right wing when you compared him to the left in Germany the left in Germany was communist but Hitler's policies were fully in favor of national healthcare his policies were fully in favor of gun vez que shion's and I think that the the basic gap between how politics works in Europe and how politics works in the United States there's a serious lack of classical liberalism in Europe their American conservatism is based on classical liberalism so what's to find is right-wing in Europe is basically anything that's anti-communist even if those people are in some parts of their program socialists so by American standards Hitler was not a conservative by run by German standards Hitler was a right-winger and he allied with right-wingers in his government Patrick's has LeBron talked about people who inspired him who were people that inspired you in politics culture athletics etc so in politics I can a lot of people in politics I was always into history it was usually historical figures as usually John Adams or Winston Churchill or Abraham Lincoln growing up I didn't have sports posters on my wall I had a giant poster of Abraham Lincoln on my wall at home I had a poster with all the presidents on my wall at home those were the things that I always found inspiration or were ideas and people who represented those ideas Moses obviously if you're Jew so I never found tremendous inspiration from cultural figures there are people who I found inspiring just an artistic level so I still find roger federer for example inspiring at an artistic level just somebody who is the best at what he's done he's the best ever at what he's done that's an inspiring thing I find om Beethoven is inspiring in the sense that he is the pinnacle of human achievement these things are inspiring but not in terms of I get my moral code or my moral ideas from those folks let's see Walter says what are the best defenses for fiscally conservative policies suppose I was talking to someone who said and said that snap or WIC which are these are programs to support women and infant children there's a small cost for the taxpayer that it isn't worth touching if we want to lower the amount of money we spend on it we're evil people who don't care about the poor etc well the question is not the amount of money that you are handing to people who are on food stamps the question is do those food stamps enervate a population one of the reasons to have work requirements for all of this is to create an incentive scheme whereby you are getting people off of food stamps the goal of food stamps should be not just a feed people should be to get people off of food stamps the goal of welfare should be to get people off of welfare in other words make a plan and the system should be responsive to the plan that you make so that it's not a permanent handout it is in fact a hands up if you're gonna have these programs at all this is why I think private charity is much better because if you are face to face with someone you said want some of your money that person it's a lot easier for that person to say why do you deserve my money and then you actually have to come up with a plan for success if you have a nameless faceless system that hands you a check every month very often that is going to actually create an incentive for you not to have a plan because that check is just gonna be there no matter what when Charlie's has been a small fan I'm only five six simply wanting to know your top five comedy films from the 90s and 2000's ooh from the 90s and 2000's is a little too narrow for me excited I don't think there have been a lot of great comedies in the 90s and 2000's best comedy films ever I mean Tootsie definitely has to be on the list and that was like 1984 maybe 1983 liar liar' I think is really funny Tommy Boy is my guilty pleasure I think that movie is insanely funny I'm not a fan of a lot of the modern comedies actually airplane is great comedy obviously they're there some that are that are less funny than they are my Groundhog Day is not like the super funniest movie but it's a very good movie one of my favorite comedies growing up was the court jester which comes from the 1950s because it's all just cleverness and wordplay Zoolander if you're gonna reveal a modern comedy Zoolander is really funny but again it's stupid funny Meet the Parents stupid funny those are those are probably the ones that that come immediately to my butt I actually tend to favor older comedies over newer comedies and some that are kind of obscure this one called Ruggles of read gap with Charles what's-his-name now man I'm losing my mind Ruggles of I'm gonna look it up because otherwise I'm gonna go absolutely insane Ruggles of read gap is with Charles Laughton and that is from 1935 and that's that's a really good movie that's he Benton says dear Ben my name is James Tyler and I've had the pleasure of becoming at first-time dad my wife and I love our daughter very much I'm wondering at what age it's okay to start introducing your shoulder into political ideals I would like to start sooner and my wife would like to start later even though you don't become president making this a moot point as everybody would become Republican now what age is it appropriate to start teaching your daughter moral views of politics and what age should you talk to your children about it I don't think it's even a matter of teaching your kid about tax rates I think it's a matter of teaching your kids about values people ask how did I get so conservative at such a young age and what I usually say is that I grew up with a certain set of values that are innately conservative personal responsibility you have to clean up your room you're responsible for your you have to work hard if you do work hard I think that things will come to you if you don't work hard then bad things will probably happen to you the decisions have consequences that what you do is up to you that you are an individual they're not beholden to any group that wants to make about that you have to be moral regardless of what other people in your class are doing right these are values and I'm sure your wife would probably agree these are values that actually have to be inculcated essentially from the time the kids are born those actually have political ramifications the separation between politics and values is the death of civilization Matz has been I recently heard a friend of mine who is majoring in English education talking about how one of her classes was teaching about how there is no proper English and that it is racist and oppressive to correct grammar and pronunciation specifically of black students speaking in Ebonics what do you say to someone who claims that any language is proper as long as it gets the point across that's stupid that's what I say to that if there is proper use of language just like there's proper use of mathematics mathematics is a language those rules can change over time there are ways of communicating that do not involve proper English that is still a form of communication but this is like the folks who say there's no such thing as good art and bad art yes there are things such as good are better and there are elements of sentences like verbs nouns and adjectives and if you use them interchangeably your sentence makes no sense so even folks who believe that Ebonics is sort of traditional English they're equivalent even those people would acknowledge that there are certain ways that words are used in sentences that if you use them in different ways that sentence would make no sense well there are other rules as well and those those rules include how to spell words they include how to pronounce words they include they include how sentences are constructed and paragraphs are constructed and there is a better English and there is a worse English and there are different forms of English but if you want to proclaim that all forms of English are equivalent that's really really dumb I mean it is not the same as English Ebonics it's not the same as English if it is used you know either either it is a either it is a different form of English that is not as proper in the sense of you know actually abiding by the normal rules of English or it is a separate language entirely which is so what some Ebonics advocates suggest andrew says what are your thoughts on the Benjamin Netenyahu corruption allegations I like him but this seems rather serious on face value it's a little bit hard to tell honestly because some of the people who are making the allegations are his political opponents one of the people testifying against him is Yair Lapita guy who could become Prime Minister if Netanyahu is Alstead also it seems that so I think I read on this the other day on the air about the corruption allegations it seems that all the things that he was supposedly promising and return never materialized so it's hard to say there was bribery when nothing materialized on the other end even says do you subscribe to the milton friedman monetarism theory or the austrian school of thought would you abolish the Federal Reserve I am of the Viennese the the Austrian school of thought when it comes to monetary policy I don't believe that the Federal Reserve is a necessary component to a functioning banking system but George says - would you be able to clarify whether Ronald Reagan was as successful economically as those on the net claiming was I have a friend who claims Reagan's economic policies tanked the economy is this true no Reagan's economic policies led to the largest peacetime growth in American history the the growth of the 1990s was largely an aftereffect of the growth of the 1980s and you can see that because you can see how the economy was contracting up till about 1983 when it turned around okay final one this is a tough one okay Ben says I have a question regarding homosexuality I struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction but I'm still attracted to the opposite sex what I really want for my life is to have a wife and children but I figured this would get in my way one day what advice can you give me for this and I'm curious to ask how do people with the Jewish faith and community handle homosexuality and people who have unwanted same-sex attraction well I mean the way that we handle unwanted same-sex attraction would be this way the same way that you handle unwanted sexual attraction to people who are not your wife meaning that attraction is something that we all have to struggle with attraction to things that we can't have or that we may be morally opposed that's something that we all struggle with on on a real basis that doesn't mean all those struggles are equivalent obviously if you have same-sex attraction that's not equivalent in in kind to me having struggles with being attracted to women who are not my wife for example as every man does write every single per every single man is built for polygamy and every single man whose moral aims toward monogamy but the the idea here is the behavior and attraction are two separate things and I'm not going to make light of the struggles that somebody has with attraction do I think that homosexuality is necessarily entirely genetic note so I think some of its environmental probably do I think that it's a reality of course it's in reality how you choose to deal with it obviously is your individual choice in a free country but if you want to have a wife and you want to have kids then I would recommend that you keep away from situations in which you would be tempted to act on attraction again the same that I give to men who don't want to have an affair stay away from situations where you'd be tempted to act on an attraction stay away from things that attract you if it's something that bothers you and if that's the way that you want to live your life okay so we will be back here on Monday with much much more I am sure I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the
