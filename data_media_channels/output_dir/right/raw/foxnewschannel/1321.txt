WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS IN

101
00:02:56,595 --> 00:02:59,030
DID NOTHING WRONG.

102
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,965

THEY GOT, AND THAT IT HAS

111
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,045
NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.

HAVING PEOPLE IN HIS CAMPAIGN,

119
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,758

00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:28,326
CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL

121
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,729
