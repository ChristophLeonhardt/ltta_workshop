Alys wedding shop has plenty of dresses but not enough brides serious war has led to less romance and fewer potential grooms Safi men are leaving the country there's immigration and the military aspect which is taken away a lot of them as a result the women ratio has increased single women are still looking to get married but the war is changing the dating scene a growing number of women are in their 30s before they get married if they do at all it's become perfectly normal to see women over 30 who are not yet married and at the same time the age of marriage has considerably decreased in some remote rural areas especially where there are refugee camps and displaced people since 2011 more than 450,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict injuries have reached 1 million more than 6 million are displaced Omar stayed in Syria but says finding a steady job and income is almost impossible which makes people think twice about marriage and starting a family under those conditions it's a crime to have a child if you have a child you have to give them medicine education and security but right now you don't know when you might have to take off and take the child with you some of my friends have had to give birth in hotels a yearning for love has led to many couples meeting online so couples communicate and get engaged over Skype or on the internet now I see the brides coming into my shop alone to buy a wedding dress or organize a party before they travel to where the groom lives romance and weddings may be taking a backseat in Syria but Ali says he's not too worried the search for love even in war is timeless Katya lupus of a young al Jazeera
