WE WENT TO TEXAS
AND TO THE INTERVIEW BOTH
CANDIDATE IN ONE OF THE
COUNTRY'S MOST CLOSELY WATCH
POLITICAL RACES.
>> SENATOR CRUZ IS A
CONSERVATIVE ICON.
>> WHY IS THIS RACE THIS CLOSE?
>> BETO O'ROURKE IS TRYING TO
SELL A PROGRESSIVE AGENDA.
>> WHY NOW?
>>> CBS NEWS, HONORED WITH SIX
EMMY AWARDS.
MORE THAN ANY OTHER TELEVISION
NEWS NETWORK.
CBS NEWS, ORIGINAL REPORTING.
>>> WE WILL TAKE YOU LIVE
TO WISCONSIN.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING THE
STAGE AT A MAKE AMERICA GREAT
RALLY.
LETS LISTEN IN
>> I WANT TO ADDRESS THE
SUSPICIOUS DEVICES AND PACKAGES
THAT WERE MAILED TO CURRENT AND
FORMER HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.
MY HIGHEST DUTY AS YOU KNOW AS
PRESIDENT IS TO KEEP AMERICA
SAFE.
THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
CONDUCTING AN AGGRESSIVE
INVESTIGATION AND WE WILL FIND
THOSE RESPONSIBLE AND WE WILL
BRING THEM TO JUSTICE.
HOPEFULLY VERY QUICKLY.
ANY ACTS OR THREATS OF POLITICAL
VIOLENCE ARE ON ATTACK ON OUR
DEMOCRACY ITSELF.
NO NATION CAN SUCCEED THAT
TOLERATES VIOLENCE OR THE THREAT
OF VIOLENCE AS A METHOD OF
POLITICAL INTIMIDATION, COERCION
OR CONTROL.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.
SUCH CONDUCT MUST BE FIERCELY
OPPOSED AND FIRMLY PROSECUTED.
WE WANT ALL SIDES TO COME
TOGETHER IN PEACE AND HARMONY.
WE CAN DO IT.
WE CAN DO IT.
WE CAN DO IT.
IT WILL HAPPEN.
MORE BROADLY, THERE IS MUCH WE
CAN DO TO BRING OUR NATION
TOGETHER.
FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE ENGAGED IN
THE POLITICAL ARENA MUST STOP
TREATING POLITICAL OPPONENTS AS
BEING MORALLY DEFECTIVE.
HAVE TO DO THAT.
THE LANGUAGE OF MORAL
CONDEMNATION AND DESTRUCTIVE
ROUTINE, THESE ARE ARGUMENTS AND
DISAGREEMENTS THAT HAVE TO STOP.
NO ONE SHOULD CARELESSLY COMPARE
POLITICAL OPPONENTS TO
HISTORICAL VILLAINS WHICH IS
DONE OFTEN, ITS DONE ALL THE
TIME.
GOT TO STOP.
WE SHOULD NOT MOB PEOPLE IN
PUBLIC SPACES OR DESTROY PUBLIC
PROPERTY.
THERE IS ONE WAY TO SETTLE OUR
DISAGREEMENTS, IT IS CALLED
PEACEFULLY AT THE BALLOT BOX.
THAT IS WHAT WE WANT.
THAT IS WHAT WE WANT.
AS PART OF A LARGER NATIONAL
EFFORT TO BRIDGE OUR DIVIDES AND
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, THE MEDIA
ALSO HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SET
A CIVIL TONE AND TO STOP THE
ENDLESS HOSTILITY AND CONSTANT
NEGATIVE AND OFTEN TIMES FALSE
ATTACKS AND STORIES.
HAVE TO DO IT.
HAVE TO DO IT.
THEY HAVE TO STOP.
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
WE ARE JUST 13 DAYS AWAY FROM A
VERY, VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION.
ITS AN ELECTION OF MONUMENTAL
JUST -- IF YOU LOOK AT IT,
MONUMENTAL IMPORTANCE.
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, MONUMENTAL
IMPORTANCE?
THERE ARE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN OUR TWO POLITICAL
PARTIES THAT WE KNOW.
IT IS A ESSENTIAL FOR DEMOCRACY
TO DRAW A SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN
THE TWO DIFFERENT PLATFORM PUT
BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT
RIGHT NOW IN MANY STATES AND ON
NOVEMBER 6TH.
WE NEED MORE NOT LESS DEBATE
ABOUT POLICY ISSUES IN OUR
COUNTRY.
WHAT WE CANNOT DO IS LET OUR
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT MATTERS OF
POLICY TEAR US APART AS A
COUNTRY.
CAN'T DO THAT.
WE MUST ACCEPT THE VERDICTS OF
ELECTIONS AND REMEMBER THAT
AMERICA'S GREATEST ACHIEVEMENTS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THOSE ENDEAVORS
WE EMBARKED ON TOGETHER.
WE HAVE HAD GREAT, GREAT
ACHIEVEMENTS.
SO TRUE.
SO LETS PUT IT ALL
TOGETHER, RIGHT?
LET'S PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.
LET'S GET ALONG.
GREAT COUNTRY.
WE WILL GET ALONG.
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY AS
TO ASK THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN
TO RE-ELECT A TRULY GREAT
GOVERNOR, SCOTT WALKER.
AND TO SEND AN INCREDIBLE
WOMAN AND TALENT LEAH -- TO THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.
LEAH -- THOSE ARE TWO GREAT
PEOPLE.
SCOTT AND LEAH ARE TRUE
CHAMPIONS FOR THE STATE.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.
EARLY VOTING IS NOW UNDERWAY SO
GET OUT AND VOTE.
THE DECISION IN THIS ECOLLECTION
IS SO CLEAR ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.
REPUBLICANS ARE FOR LOWER TAXES,
LESS REGULATIONS AND MORE
ECONOMIC FREEDOM.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THAT'S A GOOD THING.
THE DEMOCRATS ARE FOR
HIGHER TAXES, MORE REGULATION,
AND MORE TOP DOWN GOVERNMENT
CONTROL.
AND BY THE WAY, DO YOU SEE HOW
NICE SOME ARE BEHAVING TONIGHT?
THIS IS LIKE -- HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN THERE?
WE ARE ALL BEHAVING VERY WELL
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP IT
THAT WAY, RIGHT?
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT THAT
WAY.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO CREATE
BETTER HEALTH CARE THROUGH MORE
CHOICE, LOWER DRUG PRICES AND
YOU WILL SEE VERY SOON DRUG
PRICES WILL GO PLUNGING
DOWNWARD.
YOU WAIT, YOU WATCH.
ITS ALL IN MOTION.
AND WE HAVE CREATED MUCH MORE
COMPETITION.
DEMOCRATS WANT SOCIALIST HEALTH
CARE WHERE PRIVATE PLANS ARE
ABOLISHED.
REPUBLICANS WANT A STRONG SECURE
BORDER --
YOU KNEW IT A LONG TIME AGO
DUH WHEN OUR COUNTRY IS
ASSAULTED BY THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHING AND
THEY OPENLY SAY WE ARE GOING TO
GO INTO THE COUNTRY, WE CAN'T DO
THAT.
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
ITS UNFAIR TO YOU BUT IT'S ALSO
UNFAIR TO THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE
GONE THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS.
SOME ARE WAITING IN LINE TEN
YEARS.
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND THEY
DON'T GET IN BUT OTHER PEOPLE
JUST MARCH RIGHT IN.
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.
YOU WATCH.
IT WON'T HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T LET IT.
THOSE WHO VOI LATE OUR LAWS
AND CROSS OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY
WILL BE SENT BACK HOME QUICKLY.
AND WE TELL THEM THAT CAUSE
THEY HAVE A LONG HIKE BUT THEY
CAN'T COME -- THEY CANNOT COME
IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO COME IN.
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.
WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T
HAVE A COUNTRY AND WE HAVE THE
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH, OKAY?
REPUBLICANS KNOW THAT THE
RULE OF LAW IS ESSENTIAL TO
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND WE KNOW
THAT IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IS
ESSENTIAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY,
NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE
PROTECTION OF AMERICAN JOBS,
WAGES AND PUBLIC BENEFITS.
YOU KNOW THAT.
AND I SAID I WAS GOING BRING THE
JOBS BACK.
WE HAVE FACTORIES COMING BACK.
WE HAVE PLANTS COMING BACK.
WE HAVE COMPANIES COMING BACK.
THEY ARE ALL COMING BACK.
AND THE JOBS ARE COMING BACK
LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
I SAID IT.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT -- I COULD
DO IT
THIS QUICKLY.
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.
DEMOCRATS OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO
SECURE OUR BORDER.
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT WE
ARE DOING WITH OUR BORDER OVER
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
AS YOU KNOW WE STARTED THE
WALL $1.6 BILLION.
ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION AND WE HAVE
ANOTHER BUT WE WANT TO BUILD IT
VERY QUICKLY AT ONE TIME AND WE
WILL GET IT DONE.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.
YOU WILL SEE A VERY SECURE
BORDER, YOU JUST WATCH.
VERY SECURE.
AND THE MILITARY IS READY.
THEY ARE ALL SET.
THEY ARE ALL SET.
THEY ARE ALREADY AND THERE IS
NOBODY LIKE THEM.
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE IN CATCH AND
RELEASE.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS, RIGHT?
THAT'S -- YOU CATCH A PERSON
COMING ACROSS A BORDER
ILLEGALLY.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
MY NAME IS SO AND SO.
WELL DO A FAVOR, WRITE IT DOWN.
WILL YOU SHOW UP IN THREE OR
FOUR YEARS FOR A COURT CASE?
YES I WILL SHOW UP AND WE NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN.
THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT SANCTUARY
CITIES THAT REFUSE TO COOPERATE
WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
RELEASE KNOWN GONG MEMBERS,
PREDATORS, CRIMINAL ALIENS INTO
OUR COMMUNITIES.
THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN
WISCONSIN.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
AND WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT
FAST.
MS 13, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF MS 13.
THEY ARE OUT.
WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT FAST
BECAUSE OF ICE AND OTHER LAW
ENFORCEMENT -- ICE.
THEY COME IN AND OTHER LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
AND THE DEMOCRATS, EVEN OPPOSE
LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE
PENALTY FOR CRIMINALS AND DRUG
DEALERS WHO REPEATEDLY BREAK
INTO OUR COUNTRY AND HURT AND
SERIOUSLY INJURY AND EVEN WORSE,
OUR PEOPLE.
WE ARE NOT ALLOWING IT ANYMORE
AND THEY UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY
UNDERSTAND IT.
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR
JUDGES SHOULD INTERPRET THE
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN.
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE JUDGES SHOULD
BE ABLE TO REUNITED STATES THE
CONSTITUTION WHICH THEY ARE
DOING ALL THE TIME.
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE
BORDER.
THEY END UP WRITING RULES AND
REGULATIONS THAT ARE -- WORSE
THAN YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BUT
ULTIMATELY, WE ARE GOING TO GET
UP TO THE SUPREME COURT AND
HOPEFULLY THAT GREAT COURT WILL
STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT.
AND THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE
ISSUES IN THIS ELECTION.
AND THESE ARE ALSO THE REASONS
WHY ITS SO IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF
A YOU -- EACH ONE, TO GET OUT
AND VOTE.
GET OUT AND VOTE.
NOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE
DEMOCRAT, DON'T BOTHER.
BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO VOTE --
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF
REPUBLICANS HERE, DON'T WE?
SO BETWEEN SCOTT AND LEAH,
WHOSE IN FAVOR OF THOSE TWO
GREAT PEOPLE?
YES?
I THOUGHT SO.
AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
OUTSIDE.
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE, BY
THE WAY.
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP
AMERICA IS BOOMING.
AMERICA IS THRIVING.
AND AMERICA IS WINNING BECAUSE
WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA
FIRST.
ITS BEEN A LONG TIME.
ITS BEEN A LONG TIME.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50
YEARS.
5-0 YEARS.
50.
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE HAS
REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
I THINK ITS NOW 38 YEARS OLD
THIS FALL.
ITS A LONG TIME.
COULD BE LONGER BUT I THINK IT
WOULD PROBABLY ALSO BE IN THE
HISTORY CONFIDENCE ALL TIME
HIGH.
MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING NOW THAN
AT ANY POINT IN THE HISTORY OF
THE UNITED STATES.
THINK OF THAT.
AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT
IS THAT WE HAVE ELIMINATED A
RECORD NUMBER OF JOB KILLING
REGULATIONS.
PASSED A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR
WORKING FAMILIES.
AND WE WILL SOON FOLLOW IT UP
WITH ANOTHER 10% TAX CUT FOR THE
MIDDLE CLASS.
THAT'S ALL FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS.
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE TAX CUT WE
GOT FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND FOR
BUSINESS.
IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR GREAT
VETERANS AND OUR MILITARY WILL
SOON BE MORE POWERFUL BY FAR
THAN EVER BEFORE.
RIGHT?
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I KNOW A
LOT OF GOVERNORS, SOME ARE GOOD,
SOME AREN'T SO HOT, SOME ARE
REALLY NOT SO GOOD.
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU I HAVE TO
SAY THIS TO WISCONSIN, HE RAN
AGAINST ME AND THE PRIMARY.
HE WAS TOUGH.
HE COULD BE NASTY.
WOW.
BUT HE WAS TOUGH.
HE WAS SMART.
I'VE GOT -- GOTTEN TO KNOW HIM
WELL.
HE DID SOMETHING I DIDN'T THINK
WOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS
COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME.
I GOT HIM SET UP WITH AN
INCREDIBLE COMPANY CALLED FOX
CON.
AND THE HEAD AND THE OWNER
AND -- ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN
THE WORLD, THEY MAKE MUCH OF THE
APPLE PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW I'VE
BEEN SAYING FOR A LONG TIME, IT
WON'T BE COMPLETE UNTIL WE GET
APPLE AND APPLE BY THE WAY IS
SPENDING $350 BILLION IN THIS
COUNTRY BRINGING BACK $230
BILLION FROM OFFSHORE ONLY
BECAUSE OF OUR TAX CUT.
AND THEY ARE GOING TO GO WILD.
THEY ARE BUILDING A GREAT
CAMPUS.
THEY ARE BUILDING PLACES ALL
OVER -- 350 BILLION.
I THOUGHT IT WAS 350 MILLION,
THAT SOUNDED GOOD.
YOU CAN DO A LOT OF GOOD PLANTS
FOR 30 -- THEY ARE DOING $350
BILLION.
BUT FOX CON DOES MUCH OF THE
WORK IN CHINA AND OTHER PLACES
FOR APPLE.
AND THEY CAME TO WISCONSIN WITH
THE MOST INCREDIBLE PLAN -- I
DON'T KNOW HAS ANYBODY SEEN THIS
PLACE?
IT IS THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING
I'VE HAVE SEEN.
WE TOURED AND IT HAD A RIBBON
CUTTING A FEW MONTHS AGO.
I HANDED IT OVER THE SCOTT AND I
SAID LOTS OF LUCK.
THAT WAS JUST THE VERY
BEGINNING.
99% OF THE PEOPLE COULD NEVER
HAVE -- DONE THAT JOB.
NOT ONLY DO THE JOB, DO IT SO
WELL.
IT WAS ALMOST 15,000 JOBS AND
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, THERE IS NO
PLANT LIKE IT ANYWHERE IN THE
UNITED STATES.
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE
THINGS I'VE HAVE SEEN.
ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE
THINGS.
I WILL NEVER FORGET I'M GOING
AROUND WITH SCOTT AND PAUL, RYE
SCOMBRAN EVERYBODY AND -- JUST
INCREDIBLE.
YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE HERE.
WE ARE GOING AROUND AT THE
OPENING AND THEY NEEDED ROBOTS
SO THEY SAID -- RATHER THAN
GOING AND BUYING THEM, FROM A
GERMAN MANUFACTURE, WE WILL MAKE
THEM HERE.
AND THIS IS COMPLEX STUFF JUST
SO YOU UNDERSTAND.
THESE ARE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED
IN THE WORLD.
AND YOU COME BACK THREE MONTHS
LATER, THEY HAVE A WHOLE ROBOT
FACTORY MADE.
IT IS MOST INCREDIBLE THING.
THIS IS TRULY ONE OF THE GREAT
PLANTS CERTAINLY IN THIS COUNTRY
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING
CLOSE.
IN THE WORLD ITS RIGHT AT THE
TOP.
IT WAS DONE BECAUSE OF SCOTT
WALKER.
WELL I JUST WANTED TO YOU TO
KNOW -- FEW PEOPLE COULD HAVE
DONE IT.
A LOT OF JOBS BUT WHEN YOU LOOK
AT IT, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT.
EARLIER THIS MONTH I ANNOUNCED
THAT WE ARE REPLACING THE --
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE NAFTA DEAL
WITH AN INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW
U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA AGREEMENT.
I SEE THINGS FROM NAFTA -- WE
STILL
ARE SCARRED ALL OVER OUR
COUNTRY.
MILLIONS OF JOBS WERE LOST.
BIG PORTIONS OF OUR AUTO
INDUSTRY WAS LOST TO MEXICO AND
OTHER PLACES.
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER.
IT WAS A BAD DEAL FROM DAY ONE.
IT SHOULD BEEN TERMINATED ON DAY
TWO.
AND 25 YEARS LATER I GOT IT
TERMINATED, OKAY.
USMCA, IT WORKS.
NOW I SAY IT LIKE ROUTINELY.
NOW ITS VERY ROUTINE.
ITS A GIANT VICTORY FOR
WISCONSIN FARMERS, MANUFACTURERS
AND AIR REPRODUCERS.
I HAVE TO SAY THIS CAUSE WE HAVE
A LOT OF GREAT FARMERS IN THIS
COUNTRY BUT I GIVE WISCONSIN A
LOT OF CREDIT FOR IT CAUSE I
CAME UP HERE ONCE -- AND IT WAS
ROUGH.
I WAS WITH RON JOHNSON, A GREAT
PERSON A GREAT SENATOR WHO LOVES
YOU.
AND PAUL -- AND I WAS WITH SCOTT
AND -- I'M JUST GOING AROUND AND
FARMERS CAME UP TO ME.
SIR, SIR, COULD YOU HELP ME?
I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT
FARMING.
I KNOW ABOUT BUSINESS AND THESE
GREAT PEOPLE CAME UP, SIR, SIR,
CANADA JUST -- PUT A SURCHARGE
ON OUR DAIRY AND THEY DID THIS
AND THEY DID THAT AND I SAID
CAN'T BE THAT BAD.
THEN I GO SEE ANOTHER GROUP,
SIR -- THEY ARE JUST PUT A VERY
OWNERS TAX ON A VERY SPECIFIC
TYPE OF SPECIALTY MILK.
WHAT THE DO I KNOW ABOUT
SPECIALTY MILK?
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S FUNNY.
IT WAS A VERY SMALL PART OF THE
MARKET BUT IT WAS THE WRONG
THING TO DO.
AND IT REALLY ANGERED.
ON THE BIG PART OF THE MARKET IN
DAIRY YOU WERE PAYING 275%
TARIFFS AND NOBODY KNEW THAT.
THIS LITTLE TINY PART OF
SPECIALTY MARKET, IT GOT YOU.
THIS LITTLE -- WHICH WAS A
FRACTION OF -- THE BIG MARKET
THAT YOU ACCEPTED AND YOU LIVED
WITH IT.
BASICALLY IT WAS A BARRIER TO
CANADA.
IT WAS A BARRIER AND A GREAT
PEOPLE CANADA BUT THIS WAS A
BARRIER.
THIS LITTLE THING GOT YOUR GOAT
AND I GET UP HERE -- I GOT HIT
BY EVERY FARMER IN WISCONSIN
OVER THIS.
IT WAS JUST A STEP TOO FAR.
THEY JUST WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.
SINCE THAT TIME I NEVER FORGOT
IT.
YOU ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE TO A
LARGE EXTENT FOR THE
USMCA.
NOW AS YOU KNOW THE CANADIAN
MARKET WHICH WAS NOT OPEN IS NOW
OPEN.
GO DO WELL.
AND IT'S A GREAT AGREEMENT AND
WE ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE OUR
BUSINESSES ANYMORE.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THEM
MOVE DOWN AND BUILD PLANTS AND
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE USMCA
AND TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT, IT
STARTED HERE BECAUSE OF A
SPECIALTY DAIRY LITTLE TINY
DAIRY PRODUCT.
OKAY.
BECAUSE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY.
AND YOUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND
THAT IS ALL OF THEM -- THEY
PUSHED ME HARD.
THEY SAY DON'T FORGET THOSE
FARMERS.
DIDN'T.
I CAME BACK NUMEROUS TIMES AND
SAW THE FARMERS BUT WE HAVE A
TIME AGREEMENT.
IT WILL BE APPROVED BY CONGRESS
I'M SURE VERY QUICKLY.
I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT A PERIOD
OF TIME AND THEN YOU HAVE TO
WAIT AGAIN BUT ITS RIGHT ON
TRACK DOING WELL.
EVEN I MUST SAY -- THIS IS VERY
POSITIVE.
EVEN DEMOCRATS LIKE THIS DEAL.
THE DEMOCRATS LIKE THE DEAL.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
IT MAY BE BIPARTISAN.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT TODAY.
WE CAN DO A LOT OF THAT.
I THINK WE WILL BE DO BIPARTISAN
ON INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE
PEOPLE AND TO THE FARMERS OF
WISCONSIN.
YOU HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.
TWO WEEKS AGO WE ACHIEVED YET
ANOTHER HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR
NATION.
WE PROUDLY CONFIRMED THE NEWEST
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
WOW WAS HE TREATED UNFAIRLY.
THAT WAS BRUTAL.
THAT WAS BRUTAL.
I WENT UP TO HIM AND I SAID --
WHEN I -- DECIDED -- I CHOSE HIM
OUT OF THE FINEST BRILLIANT
LEGAL MINDS, SCHOLARS IN THE
WHOLE COUNTRY AND -- FOR TEN
YEARS I HEARD ABOUT BRETT
KAVANAUGH.
HE WILL BE A SUPREME COURT YOUNG
GUY.
I HEARD HE WAS GOING A SUPREME
COURT JUDGE.
FOR YEARS THEY -- TALKED ABOUT
HIM BECAUSE OF HIS GREAT
INTELLECT AND -- I WILL NEVER
FORGET JUST SHOW USE HOW LIFE
IS.
WE ARE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, I SAY
JUDGE BECAUSE HE WAS A JUDGE,
NOW HE'S A JUSTICE -- BUT I SAID
JUDGE, I'M GOING CHOOSE YOU FOR
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.
NOW, JUDGE, THIS IS GOING TO GO
FAST, SO EASY, YOU SO PERFECT.
YOU DON'T HAVE A THING WRONG.
YOU ARE THE BEST STUDENT NUMBER
ONE IN THIS CLASS ALL OVER THE
PLACE.
YOU THE BEST -- A GREAT
INTELLECT A GREAT SCHOLAR.
YOUR FAMILY, YOUR BEAUTIFUL
WIFE, YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS,
EVERYONE SO SO PERFECT.
THIS IS GOING TO GO SO EASY.
SO FAST.
AND THEN I SAW THE WAY THEY MADE
HIM SUFFER.
BUT HE GOT THROUGH IT WITH STYLE
AND GOT THROUGH WIT GRACE AND
NOW HE'S GOING BE ON THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT FOR A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.
HE'S A GREAT PERSON.
THAT WAS A TOUGH TREATMENT.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO GET RID
OF THAT KIND OF TREATMENT.
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF OUT.
AND HE SITS ALONGSIDE OF JUSTICE
GORSUCH WHO WE ALSO PUT ON THE
SUPREME COURT A LITTLE TIME
BEFORE AND THEY ARE GOING TO
DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS.
THEY WILL BE DEFENDING YOUR
RIGHTS, YOUR CONSTITUTION AND
YOUR FREEDOM.
RIGHT?
NOT BAD.
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT'S THE
MOST IMPORTANT DECISION A
PRESIDENT CAN MAKE.
I WOULD SAY WAR AND PEACE AND
THEN THAT.
OKAY.
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
WE WILL CHANGE BECAUSE -- THAT'S
THE WAY IT IS.
IT IS A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT
DECISION AND THEY ARE TWO GREAT
PEOPLE AND -- I'M VERY HONORED.
MANY PRESIDENTS DON'T GET A
CHANCE TO PUT A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE ON.
HERE WE ARE LESS THAN TWO YEARS
WE PUT TWO OF THEM ON.
SO IF WE GO WITH THIS CLIP WE
WILL PUT EIGHT OF THEM ON.
HOW CAN YOU LIKE THAT IDEA?
EIGHT.
ONE A YEAR.
WE WILL DO ONE A YEAR.
WE WILL PUT ONE A YEAR ON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE GREAT,
GREAT TALENTS AND GREAT PEOPLE
ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
THIS WILL BE THE ELECTION OF THE
CARA VANS, KAVANAUGH LAW AND
ORDER, TAX CUTS AND COMMON
SENSE.
A LOT OF IT IS COMMON SENSE.
A LOT ON POLITIC SOCIAL SECURITY
COMMON SENSE.
WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED
TONIGHT BY MANY GREAT REPUBLICAN
LEADERS INCLUDING THE WISCONSIN
LEADER WHO FOUGHT SO HARD FOR
OUR TAX CUTS, REGULATION CUTS,
VOTE RANS -- WE FOUGHT FOR THOSE
VETERANS, AND CHOICE.
WE FOUGHT FOR CHOICE.
AND FOR OUR GREAT MILITARY IN
TERMS OF $700 BILLION.
SPEAKER PAUL RYAN.
PAUL.
WHERE IS PAUL?

SECRET SERVICE LOOKS LIKE THEY
WILL LET YOU COME.

I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS ABOUT
SHAWN.
I'M WATCHING SOMETHING AND SEE A
GUY GOING UP A TREE.
A FEW YEARS AGO BUT THAT IS
OKAY.
HE'S GOING UP A TREE.
I SAID -- ITS SHAWN DUFFEY.
I SAID CAN'T BE THE ONE I KNOW.
AND IT WAS.
HE WAS THE WORLD CHAMPION FOR
FIVE YEARS.
AND I SAID THAT LOOKS TOUGH.
HE SAID GOING UP ISN'T TOUGH,
ITS COME DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF
TIMES YOU BREAK YOUR LEGS -- I
CAN SEE THAT.
THEY JUST DO LIKE A FREE FALL.
YOU HAVE TO USE -- EVERY 10 FEET
YOU HAVE STOP, STOP, STOP.
IF YOU DON'T STOP YOU ARE IN
DEEP TROUBLE.úSO SHAWN HAS BEEN.
HE IS A GREAT POLITICAL TALENT
ALSO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SHAWN.

MANY THINGS.

TO HIM, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE REALLY
DON'T KNOW HOW SMART YOU ARE.
I WORKED WITH HIM ON TAX
LEGISLATION IN PARTICULAR.
HE KNEW THAT STUFF BETTER THAN
ANYBODY.
HE WAS BRUTAL.
HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER
THAN ANYONE.
I SAID YOU ARE LIKE A HIDDEN
WEAPON.
SENATOR RON JOHNSON.
AND HE TOOK THAT COMPLIMENT
LIKE IT DIDN'T MATTER.
HE JUST WANTED TO GET BACK TO
WORK.
THANK YOU, RON.
GREAT JOB.

WE ARE GOING TO BREAK AWAY FOR A
MOMENT.
WE WILL COME BACK TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN WISCONSIN.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF LOS ANGELES.
WORKERS AT A MAIL FACILITY THERE
HAVE FOUND A SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE.
IT WAS APPARENTLY ADDRESSED TO
CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS.

ARE ON THE SCENE RIGHT NOW ALONG
WITH THE LAPD AND THEIR BOMB
SQUAD.
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS
SITUATION, UPDATE YOU AS WE GET
MORE.
FOR NOW BACK TO PRESIDENT TRUMP

>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE LIKED ME
AT THE BEGINNING BUT SHE LIKES
ME NOW.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
SHE LIKES ME NOW.
WE HAVE GOT TON KNOW EACH OTHER.
HER -- GOTTEN TO KNOW EACH
OTHER.
HER FAR LEFT OPPONENT IS TAMMY
BALDWIN.
WHO WANTS A SOCIALIST TAKE OVER
OR HEALTH CARE.
I'M TRYING TO SAY THAT VERY
NICELY.
I'M TRYING TO -- SEE NORMALLY I
WOULD SCREAM IT THEY WANT A
SOCIALIST TAKE OVER -- NOW I SAY
WANTS A SOCIALIST TAKE OVER.
I'M TRYING TO BE NICE.
RIGHT?
BUT ITS TRUE.
BALDWIN VOTED AGAINST OUR TAX
CUTS AND SHE WANTS TO RESTORE
JOB KILLING REGULATIONS THAT
HAVE HELPED LITERALLY REBUILDúO.
BALDWIN OPENED AND VOTED AGAINST
KATE'S LAW IF YOU CAN BELIEVE
THAT.
SHE VOTED ASGINS THE THING THAT
WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE STARTED AND
WE ARE MOVING ALONG RAPIDLY, THE
BORDER WALL.
AND TAMMY BALDWIN VOTED IN FAVOR
OF DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES.
NOT TOO GOOD IN WISCONSIN.
TAMMY BALDWIN AND THIS IS A BAD
TIME FOR BEING IN FAVOR OF OPEN
BORDERS BUT THAT IS WHAT SHES IN
FAVOR -- SHE WANTS OPEN BORDER.
SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO POUR INTO
OUR COUNTRY.
CAN'T DO THAT.
CAN'T DO THAT WISCONSIN.
AND YOU WANT STRONG BORDERERS
AND SAFE COMMUNITIES YOU NEED TO
VOTE FOR LEE YA.
-- BORDERS AND SAFE
COMMUNITIES, YOU NEED TO VOTE --
LEAH.
THEY WILL.
THEY WILL, LEAH.
I THINK YOU LIKE HER.
THEY LIKE YOU, LEAH.
ITS GOING TO BE A BIG, BIG WIN.
ITS GOING BE A BIG WIN FOR YOU
CAUSE YOU NEED THAT KIND OF
REPRESENTATION.
THANK YOU, LEAH.
FINALLY LET ME INTRODUCE A TRUE
WISCONSIN PATRIOT.
HE'S A FIGHTER AND HE'S BECOME A
GREAT FRIEND OF MINE.
ONE OF THE MOST CAPABLE PEOPLE
IN ALL OF GOVERNMENT.
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER.
YOU ARE, SCOTT.
YOU ARE.
SCOTT WALKER A TIRELESS
WARRIOR.
HE'S A WARRIOR.
DIDN'T HE WIN LIKE THREE
ELECTIONS LAST TIME?
RIGHT?
HE'S THE ONLY GUY THAT GETS
ELECTED THREE TIMES AND HE
DOESN'T STOP.
HE'S A WARRIOR.
THAT WAS SOME PERIOD OF TIME,
RIGHT?
THREE TIMES.
HE'S A WARRIOR FOR WISCONSIN
WORKERS AND FAMILIES.
GO AHEAD.
HE'S A GOOD MAN, FOLKS, I CAN
TELL YOU.
HE'S A GOOD MAN AND HE LOVES
THIS STATE.
HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS
STATE.
HE WILL CUT YOUR TAXES.
HE'S BEEN DOING IT.
IMPROVE YOUR SCHOOLS.
HE'S BEEN DOING IT.
BRING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH
CARE.
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT AS GOOD AS
ANYBODY AND CONTINUE CREATING
GREAT PAYING JOBS FOR THE STATE
OF WISCONSIN.
SCOTT FIGHTS EVERYDAY FOR YOU
AND NOW WE NEED YOU TO FIGHT FOR
HIM AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO
OUT AND VOTE.
SCOTT, WILL YOU COME ON UP HERE,
PLEASE?
COME ON.
COME ON.

GOOD SPOT.
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THE
PRESIDENT CALLED ME WHEN I WAS
WITH OUR GOOD FRIEND, OUR GREAT
VICE PRESIDENT, HE SAID WHERE
SHOULD WE GO?
PRETTY GREAT CROWD HERE TONIGHT.
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY PUMPED UP.
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING IN
THIS STATE THAN EVER BEFORE IN
THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF
WISCONSIN.
EIGHT STRAIGHT MONTHS OF RECORD
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.
THINGS ARE HAPPENING JUST LIKE
THEY ARE HAPPENING IN AMERICA.
AND THE PRESIDENT -- THE
PRESIDENT MENTIONED MY WIFE WHO
DOES A SUPER JOB AS OUR FIRST
LADY.
MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE SAID
BEFORE SHE HAS TYPE 1 DIABETES.
WE WILL ALWAYS COVER PEOPLE LIKE
MY WIFE WITH PREEXISTING MEDICAL
CONDITIONS.
DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES.
DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES.
YOU TALKED ABOUT MANUFACTURING
JOBS.
AND MR. PRESIDENT YOU
TALKED ABOUT FOX CON, IT IS
GREAT TO SEE JUST WE WERE AT
BACK IN JUNE WITH THE GROUND
BREAKING.
THAT HELPS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS
THE STATE.
IT HELPS PEOPLE LIKE ALEX CAUSE
HE'S ONE OF THE WELDERS WORKING
ON THAT PROJECT.
IT HELPS THE GUYS THAT WORK OVER
AT COUNTY MATERIALS IN MARATHON
CITY JUST A FEW MILES TO THE
WEST WHO ARE DOING FIVE AND A
HALF MILES OF CONCRETE FOR THE
DRAINAGE SYSTEM DOWN THERE.
IT HELPS PEOPLE IN BLACK RIVER
FALLS AT HOFFMAN CONSTRUCTION
WHO ARE MOVING TONS AND TONS AND
TONS OF DIRT.
IT HEMS IN OH CLAIRE AND IN
GREEN BAY AND IN APPLETON AND
ALL OVER THE STATE OF WISCONSIN
WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF GOOD
PAYING JOBS AT FOX CON.
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
WITHOUT THIS PRESIDENT OPENING
THE DOOR.
WE TOOK THE BALL AND RAN WITH
IT.
YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT TALKED
ABOUT DAIRY.
APRIL OF 2017 THE PRESIDENT WAS
TALKING ABOUT BUY AMERICA
WHEVENLT -- WE
BROUGHT TO MANY SOME OF THE
FARMERS.
WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE GRASSLAND HAD JUST CUT
OFF A BUNCH OF DAIRY FARMERS IN
THE STATE BECAUSE OF CANADA.
THE PRESIDENT HEARD AND THAT AND
SAID I'M GOING TO BRING THAT UP
RIGHT NOW.
HE SAID WE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE
TEARY FARMERS AND UNLIKE SO MANY
POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON IN THE
PAST, THIS PRESIDENT NEVER
FORGOT HIS PROMISE TO THE DAIRY
FARMERS IN THE STATE OF
WISCONSIN HE.
HE'S MAKING DAIRY GREAT AGAIN IN
AMERICA AND IT STARTS IN
WISCONSIN.
AND I FINALLY WANT TO TELL
YOU -- ONE LAST THING, WE DON'T
HEAR ENOUGH OF THIS FROM THE
PRESS.
YOU HEAR ALL SORTS OF MYTHS
ABOUT THE TAX CUT.
LET ME SET IT STRAIGHT.
THESE AREN'T MY NUMBERS, THESE
ARE OFFICIAL NUMBERS FROM THE
WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE.
A TYPICAL FAMILY IN THE STATE IS
TWO PEOPLE WORKING, TWO PERSON
WORKING HOUSEHOLD.
TWO KIDS AT HOME SAVES $2,508.
THAT'S REAL MONEY.
THAT'S NOT CRUMBS.
AND MR. PRESIDENT WE KNOW A
THING OR TWO ABOUT TAXES IN THIS
STATE CAUSE OVER THE LAST EIGHT
YEARS WE HAVE CUT TAXES AND THE
HARD WORKING PEOPLE OF THIS
STATE MORE THAN $8 BILLION.
WE WILL KEEP DOING IT CAUSE AS
FOLKS HEARD BEFORE, MY OPPONENT
WANTS THE TO RAISE THEIR
PROPERTY TAXES AND INCOME TAXES
AND TAXES ON GAS.
WHAT WILL THAT DO.
>> THEY WILL COST US JOBS.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT.
WE HAVE TO PLAN TO KEEP MOVING
WISCONSIN FORWARD.
WITH THIS PRESIDENT HE WILL KEEP
MOVING WISCONSIN FORWARD FOR
GENERATIONS TO COME.
THANKS FOR THE HELP,
MR. PRESIDENT
>> TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU.
GOOD JOB.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
SCOTT'S OPPONENT IS AN EXTREME
LIBERAL NAMED TONY EVERS.
TONY WANTS TO RAISE YOUR INCOME
TAXES SUBSTANTIALLY.
WANTS TO RAISE YOUR GAS TAXES,
RAISE YOUR PROPERTY TAXES, RAISE
ALL OF YOUR TAXES AND TONY EVERS
WANTS TO GET ILLEGAL ALIENS TO
FLOOD INTO WISCONSIN, TO GET
FREE PUBLIC BENEFITS FUNDED BY
YOU, THE AMERICAN TAX PAYER.
NO GOOD.
NO GOOD.
SO DON'T WAIT, VOTE EARLY FOR
SCOTT WALKER.
TREMENDOUS GUY.
LEAH, LEAH WOULD YOU COME UP
HERE PLEASE?
JUST QUICK.
COME UP.
SHE'S SO INCREDIBLE.
COME HERE.
COME HERE.
THIS IS UNSCHEDULED BUT I WANT
TO SAY IT.
SAY SOMETHING FOR A SECOND.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
IT IS AN HONOR TO STAND WITH YOU
AND I AM SO THRILLED THAT YOU
CAME BACK TO WISCONSIN.
YOU PROMISED ME THE DAY YOU
CALLED ME AFTER I WON THAT
PRIMARY AND YOU FOLLOWED THROUGH
ON YOUR PROMISE JUST LIKE YOU
HAVE FOLLOWED THROUGH ON EVERY
PROMISE YOU MADE FOR US.
EVERY WHERE I GO IN THIS GREAT
STATE, AND I LOOKED OUT WHEN I
SPOKE TO ALL OF YOU BEFORE AND
IT IS OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I
HAVE PUT ON 92,000 MILES ON MY
CAR AND I SEE FACES FROM EVERY
COUNTY I VISITED.
ALL 72 COUNTIES AND YOU ALL
WELCOMED ME OVER AND OVER AND
OVER AGAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO
SEND TAMMY BALDWIN BACK TO THE
PRIVATE SECTOR THAT SHE DOESN'T
KNOW EXISTS.
EVERYTHING THIS PRESIDENT
SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO, HE'S
DONE.
WE NEED TO SEND HIM SOMEONE IN
WASHINGTON SO THAT SENATOR RON
JOHNSON'S BOAT ISN'T CANCELLED
AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THAT.
TAXING TAMMY DOESN'T HAVE
YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND.
TAXING TAMMY HAS VOTED TO
INCREASE YOUR TAXES 413 TIMES.
YOU HEARD THE GOVERNOR TALK
ABOUT $2,500.
I THINK IT WAS $2,508.
TAXING TAMMY DIDN'T THINK YOU
DESERVED THAT $2,500.
I THINK YOU DO.
AND OF COURSE THE ISSUE
THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE
REFORM, THE BIG LIE THAT SCOTT
WALKER TALKED ABOUT, TAMMY
BALDWIN IS SAYING THAT SAME LIE
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
WE SUPPORT TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE
WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
I'VE SAID IT BEFORE, I WILL SAY
IT AGAIN.
I WILL FALL IN FRONT OF A TRUCK
BEFORE I LET PEOPLE GO WITHOUT
COVERAGE FOR PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS.
TAMMY BALDWIN'S PLAN
MEDICARE FOR ALL, YOU KNOW WHAT
MY NAME IS FOR IT,
MR. PRESIDENT?
CHAOS FOR ALL.
CHAOS FOR ALL BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO DESTROY, DISMANTLE MEDICARE,
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE,
MEDICAID,TRITON CARE, I'M NOT
GOING TO LET HER DO IT.
I NEED TO GO TO WASHINGTON TO
STAND WITH THIS MAN SO WE FIX
HEALTH CARE REFORM ONCE AND FOR
ALL.
AND ONE LAST THING, IF I
MAY INDULGE, I'M TALKING ABOUT
CHAOS.
I MEAN IT IS THE LEFT'S --
THAT'S EVERYTHING THEY ARE
ABOUT, CHAOS AT THE BORDER,
CHAOS IN HEALTH CARE, CHAOS,
RESIST, OBSTRUCT.
TAMMY BALDWIN STANDS FOR THAT
CHAOS.
HE STANDS FOR OPEN BORDERS.
SHE STANDS FOR SANCTUARY CITIES.
THIS -- THIS DAUGHTER -- THIS
DAUGHTER OF GREEK IMMIGRANTS
KNOWS THAT WE ARE A NATION OF
LAWS AND WE MUST UPHOLD THOSE
LAWS AND I WANT TO STAND WITH
THIS PRESIDENT WHEN HE BUILDS
THE WALL AND FINISHES BUILDING
THE WALL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I WILL FINISH.
>> THANK YOU, DARLING.
GREAT JOB.
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
LETS WIN.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, LEAH.
GREAT JOB.
SHE'S TERRIFIC.
WE DO, WE HAVE TO HAVE HER DOWN
THIS.
WE NEED THE VOTES AND WE NEED
LEAH.
THE DEMOCRAT HEALTH CARE PLAN
WOULD OH O SPLIT RATE HEALTH
CARE -- OBLITERATE HEALTH CARE.
THESE PEOPLE THAT REALLY DEPEND
ON IT.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS
WHO HAVE EARNED IT.
THEY PAID FOR IT FOR A LONG
TIME.
THEY PAID FOR IT.
AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS
PROTECT AS LEAH SAID --
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING
CONDITIONS.
100%.
100%.
AND WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.
WE HAVE GOTTEN RID OF A LOT OF
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF OBAMA
CARE.
WE HAD IT BEATEN BUT WE GOT NO
DEMOCRAT VOTES.
NOT ONE.
AND -- WE HAD IT REPEALED AND
REPLACED BUT E-SEPTEMBERALLY WE
HAVE DISMANTLED IT.
WE GOT RID OF -- SO MUCH AND SO
MANY BAD ELEMENTS OF IT.
ITS BEEN BROUGHT DOWN TO SIZE --
IF YOU NOTICE YOUR PREMIUMS ARE
GOING UP BECAUSE OF WHAT WE HAVE
DONE.
GOING UP VERY LITTLE BY
COMPARISON.
REMEMBER LAST YEAR I CAME HERE
OR THE YEAR BEFORE I CAME HERE
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT INCREASES
OF 115%, 190%, 216% IN SOME
STATES AND -- WE GOT RID OF A
THING CALLED THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE WHERE -- YOU HAD THE
PRIVILEGE OF PAYING A FORTUNE IN
ORDER TO NOT PAY A FORTUNE IN
BAD HEALTH CARE.
THAT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
FROM THEIR STANDPOINT GONE.
ITS GONE.
SAVED TREMENDOUS NUMBERS OF
PEOPLE.
A LOT OF MONEY.
SAYFULLO ADD LOT OF SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS A LOT OF MONEY.
AND NOW WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE
HAVE COME UP WITH GREAT PLANS.
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF CO-OP PLANS
AND OTHER PLANS AND PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO THEM BY THE MILLIONS.
ITS BEEN AN HONOR WE FELT HAVE
DONE A REAL JOB AND HEALTH CARE
IS GOING TO BE OUR MAJOR FOCUS.
ONE OF OUR MAJOR FOCUSES.
WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING VERY
úSPE.
GETTING RID OF THAT INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE WAS SO IMPORTANT.
SCOTT WOULD CALL ME ALL THE
TIME, HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE?
GUESS WHAT?
WE PUT IT INTO OUR TAX CUT PLAN.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY TALK ABOUT
MAJORITIES.
WE DON'T HAVE LIKE -- ITS THIS.
I ALWAYS SAY -- IF A SENATOR
CATCHES A COLD, WE DON'T HAVE A
MAJORITY.
WE HAVE TO WAIT.
WE NEED MORE SENATORS.
WE NEED MORE CONGRESS MEN AND
WOMEN AND IT WILL HAPPEN.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BLUE WAVE,
PAUL?
I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THE BLUE
WAVE.
ITS NOT DOING SO WELL.
I BETTER BE A LITTLE CAREFUL
BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IN TWO WEEKS
IF WE DON'T DO QUITE AS WELL AS
WE ARE MAYBE THINKING WE ARE
GOING TO DO, I WILL BE ALL OVER
TELEVISION WITH THESE EXACT
REMARKS.
THEY WILL BE DOING A NUMBER BUT
THAT'S OKAY.
LOOK, EARLY VOTING LOOKS
EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD FOR THE
REPUBLICANS.
EXTRAORDINARILY.
WHO KNOWS.
IT DOESN'T MATTER -- IT ONLY
MATTERS ON NOVEMBER 6TH WHEN
THOSE VOTES ARE TALLIED UP AND
COUNTED.
THE START THAT YOU HAVE GOTTEN
OUT TO BECAUSE YOU WANT SAFETY,
YOU WANT SECURITY, YOU WANT
GREAT JOBS, YOU WANT GREAT
MEDICARE AND -- YOU WANT HEALTH
CARE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
I LIKE THAT PERSON.
WHO IS THAT PERSON?
THANK YOU GOOD LOOKING GUY.
NICE LOOKING MAN.
BUT WE WANT STRENGTH.
WE WANT A STRONG MILITARY.
WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR
VETERANS.
WE WANT TO GET OUR VETERANS --
WE DID SOMETHING FOR OUR
VETERANS NOBODY THOUGHT WAS
POSSIBLE.
WE GOT VETERANS CHOICE WHERE
THEY ARE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE
OF -- IF THEY ARE NOT BEING
TAKEN CARE OF THEY GO OUT TO A
PRIVATE DOCTOR.
VETERANS CHOICE TOOK 44 YEARS
AND RYAN AND ALL OF THESE
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE THAT WE JUST
INTRODUCED HELPED.
EVERYONE OF THEM.
AND PAUL, THANK YOU.
YOU WORKED HARD ON THAT ONE.
THAT WAS NOT AN EASY ONE.
AND THEN YOU HAD VETERANS
ACCOUNTABILITY, PAUL, RIGHT?
THAT WAS 43 YEARS.
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW IF THEY
DON'T TREAT OUR VETERANS RIGHT,
THEY WERE -- REALLY PROTECTED.
THEY COULD DO ANYTHING.
THEY COULD STEAL.
THEY COULD ROB.
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WITH OUR
VETERANS IN THEIR PRIME.
BUT THEY WERE NASTY.
THEY WERE NASTY.
YOU COULDN'T TO ANYTHING.
NOW WE CAN FIRE THEM SO FAST
YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN.
THE DEMOCRATS ALSO WANT TO RAISE
MEDICARE TO FUND BENEFITS FROM
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT
THEY WANT TO FUND THEM FOR
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SO THE
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COME IN.
AND HOW ABOUT THE GOVERNOR
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN SCOTT?
THE GOVERNOR WHO IS TRYING TO
BECOME THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS.
THINK OF THIS, JUST THINK OF
THIS, HE WANTS OPEN BORDERS.
EVERYBODY CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA
AND HE WANTS TO GIVE YOU FREE
HEALTH CARE, FREE EDUCATION,
DRIVERS LICENSES.
I SAID THE OTHER NIGHT JOKINGLY,
PROBABLY A ROLLS ROYCE AND ONE
OF THESE PEOPLE SAID HE SAID HE
IS GOING TO GIVE THEM A ROLLS
ROYCE AND HE DID NOT SAY THAT.
YOU CAN'T JOKE WITH THESE
PEOPLE.
YOU CAN'T BE EVEN A LITTLE
SARCASM.
I SAID THEY WANT TO SUPPLY A
ROLLS ROYCE -- THEY ACTUALLY
SAID ONE OF THEM -- JUST ONE,
THEY WANT TO SUPPLY A ROLLS
ROYCE.
THEY SAID THE GOVERNOR OF
CALIFORNIA NEVER SAID THAT.
THEY CAN'T TAKE A JOKE BUT MAYBE
THEY ARE START TAKING A JOKE AND
MAYBE WE WILL BE A LOT BETTER
OFF WHEN THEY DO.
AS WE SPEAK THE DEMOCRAT PARTY
IS OPENLY ENCOURAGING CARA VAN
AFTER CARA VAN OF ILLEGAL ALIENS
TO VIOLATE OUR LAWS AND BREAK
INTO OUR COUNTRY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, FOLKS, YOU
HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THE CRISIS ON THE BORDER -- AND
IT IS A CRISIS.
ITS CRAZY.
ITS CRAZY.
RIGHT NOW IS THE SOLE RESULT OF
DEMOCRAT LAWS AND ACTIVISTS
DEMOCRAT JUDGES THAT DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT AND THAT PREVENT US
FROM RETURNING ILLEGAL ALIENS
BACK HOME TO CENTRAL AMERICA AND
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.
DEMOCRATS EVEN SUPPORT SANCTUARY
CITIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT GANG
MEMBERS AND MS 13 -- YOU SEE THE
MS 13 PREDATORS.
SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN I
USE THAT NAME.
THESE ARE PREDATORS.
ONLY IN WISCONSIN, RIGHT ALL THE
SCREAMING.
SCREAMING.
I WON'T SAY WHAT YOU SCREAMED.
RELEASE THEM INTO U.S.
COMMUNITIES, RIGHT?
WE DON'T WANT THAT.
UNLESS YOU LIKE TO HAVE THEM UP
IN WISCONSIN.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE MS 13?
YOU SURE?
IF YOU SAID YES WE COULD SEND
THEM YOUR WAY.
PAUL, I DON'T THINK WE WANT MS
13.
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?
I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN.
ACTUALLY I THINK MS 13 WOULD BE
IN BIG TROUBLE.
TRUE.
I DO.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT
CRIMINAL ALIENS.
AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL
ALWAYS STAND PROUDLY WITH THE
HEROS OF ICE AND BORDER PATROL
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.
AND YOU THINK THEY HAVE AN EASY
JOB?
THEY DON'T HAVE AN EASY JOB.
THESE ARE GREAT PATRIOTS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE -- YOU ARE
RIGHT, THEY ARE HEROS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE -- YOU DON'T
WANT THEIR JOB.
THEY GO INTO NESTS.
THEY CALL THEM NESTS OF GANGS
LIKE MS 13, EQUAL.
THEY GO INTO THESE NESTS LIKE
ITS A DAY AT THE OFFICE.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
YOU -- I THINK THAT ONE DOES
WANT TO DO IT.
I THINK HE DOES WANT TO DO IT
ACTUALLY.
ITS TOUGH STUFF.
AND YOU KNOW, WHERE I GREW UP,
NEAR LONG ISLAND WE HAVE -- LIKE
THESE GREAT COMMUNITIES AND THEY
WERE INFILTRATED WITH MS 13 AND
WE GOT -- HE SAID GET THEM THE
OUT.
WE ARE, ACTUALLY.
WE ACTUALLY ARE.
WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT OF THIS
COUNTRY BY THE THOUSANDS .
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.
IT IS LIKE LIBERATING -- LIKE A
WAR, LIKE -- THERE'S A FOREIGN
INVASION AND THEY OCCUPY YOUR
COUNTRY AND THEN YOU GET THEM
OUT THROUGH WHATEVER AND THEY
CALL IT LIBERATION.
YOU ARE LIBERATED.
ICE GOES IN AND THEY ARE MUCH
TOUGHER, MUCH STRONGER AND MUCH
SMARTER.
THEY GO IN AND THEY IN A
RELATIVELY NICE WAY, I WANT TO
SAY THAT, RELATIVELY NICE, THEY
GET THEM OUT.
THEY PUT THEM IN WAGONS AND GET
THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
THEY BRING THEM BACK HOME OR
WORSE.
AND THESE TOWNS ARE BEING
LIBERATED
AND THE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING.
IT IS LIKE WATCHING WORLD WAR II
MOVIES.
IT IS LIKE WATCHING
DOCUMENTARIES ON WORLD WAR I AND
WORLD WAR II.
THE OCCUPATIONS -- THEY GET
THEM, THEY TAKE THEM OUT AND THE
PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR WINDOWS
CLAPPING AND SCREAMING AND THEY
ARE HAPPY.
THIS IS ICE AND THE DEMOCRATS
WANT TO TERMINATE ICE.
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF THEM.
SO IF YOU WANT TO UPHOLD OUR
LAWS, OUR BORDER AND OUR WAY OF
LIFE, YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR SCOTT
WALKER AND LEAH.
LEAH.
YOU GOT TO DO IT.
SO LEAH AND SCOTT, GOOD LUCK.
I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE
IT.
YOU DON'T MAKE IT HE WILL CALL
UP IF HE DOESN'T MAKE IT.
IS THE PRESIDENT THERE, WHO IS
KILLING?
SCOTT WALKER.
DIDN'T HE LOSE?
YEAH.
I WILL TALK TO HIM IN A FEW
MONTHS.
BUT THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN.
PLEASE DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
PLEASE DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
HE'S GOT A GOOD LEAD.
JUST -- YOU GOT TO VOTE.
DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT LEADS.
THE LEAD NOVEMBER 6TH IS YOUR
LEAD.
AND LEAH LOOKING GOOD.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE.
WE NEED THEM BOTH BADLY.
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT BORDERS
AND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT JOBS.
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS WE
CREATED 4.2 MILLION NEW JOBS AND
LIFTED -- LISTEN TO THIS, 4.2
MILLION AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD
STAMPS.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SAID YOU CAPTAIN
HAVE MANUFACTURING JOBS ANYMORE?
I USED TO SAY WHAT DOES HE MEAN
BY THAT?
BY THE WAY HATE TO SAY IT, THESE
OUR BEST JOBS.
THESE ARE OUR BEST JOBS.
THESE ARE GREAT JOBS.
THEY HAVE VERY IMPORTANT JOBS
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
BUT REMEMBER THEY SAID YOU NEED
A MAGIC WAND.
A MAGIC WAND?
I GUESS WE HAVE A MAGIC WAND,
RIGHT?
IN FACT NOW THE NUMBER IS ALMOST
600,000.
HERE IN WISCONSIN MANUFACTURING
JOBS ARE GROWING AT THE FASTEST
PACE IN MORE THAN 23 YEARS.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC
AMERICAN POVERTY HAS REACHED AN
ALL TIME LOW.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN,
HISPANIC-AMERICAN,
ASIAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYMENT HAVE
ALL REACHED THEIR LOWEST RATES
EVER RECORDED.
THAT'S A TOUGH SOUND BITE.
ISN'T THAT A TOUGH SOUND BITE
FOR THE OPPONENT?
RIGHT?
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT, KANYE
WEST LIKES ME.
WHICH IS GOOD.
INTERESTING GUY.
BIG JIM BROWN, RIGHT?
THESE ARE THE OPPOSITES.
JIM BROWN SITTING THERE -- HE
LOOKS LIKE HE COULD PLAY
TOMORROW.
BIG JIM
AND WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT JUST 
FELL TO 3.6%, WHICH IS AS YOU 
KNOW, I HATE TO SAY IT, THAT'S 
HIGH WORST STATISTIC. 
BECAUSE THAT'S ONLY THE LOWEST 
RATE IN 65 YEARS. 
THAT'S NOT HISTORIC. 
I'VE BEEN WAITING SIX YEARS TO 
GET RID OF THAT STATISTIC, AND 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT, 
BUT IT'S HAPPENING SOON. 
WE'RE ALSO TAKING THE TOUGHEST 
EVER ACTION TO CRACKDOWN ON 
CHINA'S ABUSIVE TRADE 
PRACTICES. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL, AND I 
SAID, YOU'RE NOT READY YET. 
TRUE. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A TEAL, AND 
PRESIDENT XI IS A GREAT PERSON, 
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO 
SOMETHING SOON OR SOME DAY. 
BUT YOU KNOW, $500 BILLION HAS 
BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY 
FOR YEARS, EVERY YEAR. 
$500BILLION. 
ON TRADE, WE LOST $807 BILLION. 
THINK OF IT. 
WHO MADE THESE DEALS? 
WHO MADE THESE DEALS? 
AND WE'RE THE ONE WITH ALL THE 
POWER, BECAUSE WE'RE THE PIGGY 
BANK THAT ALL OF THESE 
COUNTRIES WANT TO COME IN AND 
ROB. 
SO WE HAVE ALL THE POWER. 
BUT WE DID CANADA, AND MEXICO. 
WE DID SOUTH KOREA. 
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF THEM NOW. 
THEY ALL WANT TO MAKE A DEAL 
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF THOSE 
TARIFFS. 
THEY DON'T WANT THOSE TARIFFS. 
THEY'LL SIGN ANYTHING, PLEASE. 
DON'T DO THAT TO ME, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, WE DON'T WANT TARIFFS. 
WE DON'T WANT TARIFFS, PLEASE! 
TAKING CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. 
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
PEOPLE. 
YOU KNOW, WE HAD THESE 
GLOBALISTS, THEY DIDN'T CARE SO 
MUCH ABOUT US. 
THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE 
GLOBE. 
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
AND WE'LL HELP OTHER COUNTRIES. 
WE'RE GOING TO HELP OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE WEALTHY, 
WEALTHY COUNTRIES WITH WE TAKE 
CARE OF THEIR MILITARY, AND 
WE'RE NOT REIMBURSED, OR WE'RE  
REIMBURSED FOR A TINY FRACTION. 
CAN'T HAVE THAT. 
THESE ARE WEALTHY COUNTRIES. 
I'VE ALREADY GONE TO SOME OF 
THEM. 
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD GIVE 
YOU NAMES. 
WHO CARES? 
THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM. 
I SAY MR. PRIME MINISTER. 
I SAY MR. PRESIDENT. 
I SAY MR. KING, MR. DICTATOR. 
MR.WHOEVER THE WE'RE 
PROTECTING, YOU'VE GOT TO START 
PAYING FOR THIS PROTECTION. 
GOT TO START PAYING. 
AND PRIME MINISTER ABE, PRIME 
MINISTER OF JAPAN, GREAT GUY. 
FANTASTIC GUY, ACTUALLY. 
JUST WON A BIG ELECTION. 
BUT I SAID TO TO HIM. 
JAPAN'S AN IMMENSELY WEALTHY 
NATION. 
THEY SEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS 
OF CARS TO THE UNITED STATES, 
AND THEY ALSO BUILD THEM IN THE 
UNITED STATES, I LIKE THEM 
BETTER, BY THE WAY. 
I THINK THEY'RE MUCH NICER. 
BUT I SAID TO PRIME MINISTER 
ABE, I SAID LOOK, WE'RE TAKING 
CARE OF YOUR MILITARY. 
WE HELPED YOU A LOT WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
THEY'RE NOT SENDING MISSILES 
OVER JAPAN. 
I DID THAT. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, WOULDN'T 
YOU SAY? 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
THAT'S A GOOD THING. 
BUT YOU'RE ONLY PAYING FOR A 
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR MILITARY. 
WE'RE DOING THE REST. 
YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY HELP US 
OUT. 
IT'S NOT FAIR. 
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND HE 
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 
I SAID HAS ANYONE EVER ASKED 
YOU TO DO THIS BEFORE? 
HE GOES NO. 
IT'S TRUE! 
TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS. 
SOUTH KOREA, THE SAME THING. 
WONDERFUL PEOPLE. 
PRESIDENT MOON. 
WE BUY MISSILE SYSTEMS. 
HOW MUCH IS THAT SYSTEM? 
SIR, THAT SYSTEM IS $1 BILLION. 
GOOD. 
GENERAL TOLD ME THAT. 
I SAID GENERAL, WHOSE PAYING 
FOR IT? 
SIR, I DON'T KNOW. 
I SAID FIND OUT WHO'S PAYING. 
I THINK I KNEW THE ANSWER. 
úCOM 
THE SYSTEM IS -- THING OF IT, 
NOT 1 MILLION, 1 BILLION. 
THE SYSTEM IS $1 BILLION, AND 
SIR, THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA IS PAYING FOR IT. 
I SAID WHY ARE WE PAYING? 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, YOU HAVE 
MISSILES BEING SHOT FROM NORTH 
KOREA. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN NOW, 
FOLKS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG UN. 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
MISSILES GO FROM NORTH KOREA TO 
SOUTH KOREA. 
WE HAVE A MISSILE SYSTEM, IT 
COSTS $1 BILLION. 
WE SHOOT THE MISSILES DOWN. 
THAT'S GREAT. 
THEY MAKE YOUR SAMSUNG, YOUR 
LG, THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE 
BECAUSE OF US. 
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS OVER 
THERE THAT THEY DON'T PAY FOR. 
FIGURE THAT ONE. 
SO THEY'RE MAKING THE MISSILES, 
I SAY, SO GENERAL LET ME ASK 
YOU A QUESTION, WHY IS IT THAT 
THEY DON'T PAY? 
BECAUSE SIR, THEY ARE AN ALLY 
OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
AND I SAY GENERAL, I LIKE THEM 
TOO, BUT THEY GOT TO PAY. 
THEY GOT TO PAY. 
THEY GOT TO PAY. 
THEY GOT TO PAY! 
OH, I COULD TELL YOU A HUNDRED 
STORIES LIKE THAT. 
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES ALL 
NIGHT LONG, BUT THE POLITICIANS 
MAY GET TIRED AND GO HOME. 
BUT WE ARE REALLY DOING 
SOMETHING. 
WE SECURED $716 BILLION TO 
FULLY REBUILD THE UNITED STATES 
MILITARY. 
AND AT MY DIRECTION, VERY 
EXCITING, BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE 
IT'S AT, THE PENTAGON IS NOW 
WORKING TO CREATE THE SIXTH 
BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN ARMED 
FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE. 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 
HAVE TO DO IT. 
HAVE TO DO IT. 
THINK OF THAT, ISN'T THAT 
EXCITING? 
AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT. 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 
SATELLITES ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
-- THEY'RE HAPPENING. 
THAT'S WHERE IT IS FROM THE 
STANDPOINT. 
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 
ROCKETS GOING TO THE MOON. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT MILITARY 
PROTECTION. 
FOR MILITARY OFFENSE AND 
DEFENSE, THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT. 
U.S. SPACE FORCE. 
AND I WITHDREW THE UNITED 
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-
SIDED IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, OR 
CATASTROPHE, AND WE HAVE 
RECOGNIZED THE CAPITOL OF 
ISRAEL, AND OPENED THE AMERICAN 
EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
 
AND TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE 
EXTRAORDINARY PROGRESS AND 
WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. 
YOU KNOW THE EMBASSY WAS 
SUPPOSED TO COST $1.1 BILLION, 
YOU KNOW THAT? 
AND EVERY PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE 
GOING TO APPROVE IT. 
THEY NEVER DID. 
BECAUSE ONCE THEY GOT TO 
OFFICE, THEY FOUND NOT SO EASY. 
EVERY COUNTRY SAID PLEASE DON'T 
DO IT. 
SO I JUST TURNED OFF THE PHONE. 
I DON'T WANT TO TALK. 
I WAS GOING TO APPROVE IT ON 
MONDAY. 
I SAID I'LL CALL THEM BACK ON 
TUESDAY. 
I CALLED MORE PEOPLE ON 
TUESDAY. 
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
THE EMBASSY. 
OH, GEE. 
SORRY, IT'S DONE. 
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY OBAMA AND 
BUSH AND CLINTON, AND MANY, 
MANY, ALL THE WAY BACK DIDN'T 
DO IT. 
TREMENDOUS PRESSURE, AND WE DID 
IT. 
BUT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COST 
$1.1 BILLION. 
$1.1BILLION. 
AND ONE OF THE GENERALS WALKED 
IN, WOULD YOU SIGN THIS? 
HE SIGNED DONALD. 
AND BY THE WAY, WHAT IS IT I'M 
SIGNING, I SIGN A LOT OF 
PAPERS. 
SCARY. 
YOU'RE SIGNING SO MANY PAPERS. 
I SAID WHAT IS THIS? 
SIR, WE'RE BUILDING THE UNITED 
STATES EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
HOW MUCH IS IT? 
$1.1BILLION SIR. 
WE'RE BUILDING A ONE STORY 
BUILDING. 
ANY BUILDERS IN HERE FROM úWISC 
YOU'D DO IT FOR ABOUT $200,000, 
RIGHT? 
IT'S TRUE. 
I SAID HOW DO YOU SPEND $1. 
$1.1 BILLION ON A ONE STORY 
STRUCTURE? 
IT'S HALF SIGNED. 
IT JUST SAYS DONALD. 
I DIDN'T SEEN GET THE J FOR 
JOHN. 
JUST SAYS DONALD, THEN YOU SEE 
IT'S A DEAD STOP. 
I SAID I'M NOT SIGNING IT. 
I CALLED UP A GREAT MAN, DAVID 
FRIEDMAN, HE'S THE AMBASSADOR 
TO ISRAEL. 
I SAID DAVID, THEY WANT US TO 
BUY THIS UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE 
SITE, AND THEY WANT US TO BUILD 
A BUILDING THAT'S GOING TO COST 
$1.1 BILLION. 
NUMBER 1, IT PROBABLY WILL TAKE 
25 YEARS, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 
LET'S GET THIS THING DONE 
IMMEDIATELY. 
HE SAID SIR, CAN I CALL YOU 
BACK? 
HE CALLS ME BACK FOUR DAYS 
LATER. 
SAYS SIR, WE OWN THE BEST SITE 
IN JERUSALEM. 
ON THE SITE, SET BACK, WHICH 
THEY WANT FOR SAFETY. 
SET BACK IS A BUILDING. 
AND THE BUILDING IS NICE. 
BUT THE BEST LOCATION. 
I THINK I CAN RENOVATE THE 
BUILDING, SIR. 
AND I CAN DO IT FOR LESS THAN 
$200,000. 
TRUE, TRUE STORY. 
úTHAT'S A TRU 
I DO IT FOR LESS THAN $200,000. 
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. 
EVER. 
I THINK IT'S THE FIRST TIME, I  
I SAID IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. 
I SAID SPEND 4 OR 500,000, 
OKAY? 
IT'S TOO LITTLE. 
AND WE WENT OUT, AND WE BUILT 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDING FOR 
$500,000.

OPERATING, AND WE'RE HAPPY. 
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. 
IF YOU VOTE REPUBLICAN THIS 
NOVEMBER, WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
CUT YOUR TAXES, CUT YOUR 
REGULATIONS AND RAISE YOUR 
INCOMES. 
WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE AND 
SOCIAL SECURITY. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONFIRM 
JUDGES WHO INTERPRET OUR 
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. 
WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDER. 
WE HAD PASS CASE LAW. 
WE'LL STOP THOSE SANCTUARY 
CITIES. 
STOP CATCH AND RELEASE. 
END VISA LOTTERY, THE WORST. 
PICK IT OUT OF A HAT. 
PICK IT OUT OF A HAT. 
HOW ABOUT THAT? 
VISA LOTTERY. 
WE HAVE A LOTTERY, FOR LOTTERY 
PEOPLE COMING TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I DON'T THINK THOSE COUNTRIES 
ARE PUTTING THEIR FINEST IN THE 
LOTTERY. 
WE SAY HOW DID THESE PEOPLE 
COME HERE? 
WE GOT THEM IN THE LOTTERY. 
OH, GREAT. 
WE'RE GOING TO END THE LOTTERY. 
END CHAIN MIGRATION, WHICH IS 
TERRIBLE, AND WE WILL KEEP THE 
CRIMINALS, DRUG DEALERS, AND 
TERRORISTS THE OUT OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
WE WILL LIFT MILLIONS OF OUR 
CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, 
FROM DEPENDENCE, TO 
INDEPENDENCE, AND FROM POVERTY 
TO PROSPERITY. 
FOR YEARS YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
YOU NOW HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
PROUDLY STANDING UP FOR YOU, 
AND FOR AMERICA. 
 
THANK YOU. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
WISCONSIN. 
AND WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP 
FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOMENTUM, THEN YOU 
MUST VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
GO OUT AND VOTE. 
VOTE FOR LEAH, VOTE FOR SCOTT. 
GREAT PEOPLE. 
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO 
YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. 
THIS STATE WAS SETTLED BY TOUGH 
FRONTIER MEN, AND STRONG 
PIONEER WOMEN WHO BRAVED THE 
WILDERNESS TO BUILD A LIFE AND 
A HOME. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES, THEY 
LOVED THEIR COUNTRY, AND THEY 
LOVED THEIR GOD. 
THESE COURAGEIOUS WISCONSIN 
PATRIOTS DID NOT SHED THEIR 
BLOOD, SHED THEIR SWEAT AND 
TEARS SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT 
HOME WHILE OTHERS TRIED TO 
ERASE THEIR LEGACY, AND DESTROY 
OUR PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM, 
AND FOR THE SAKE OF OUR 
CHILDREN, WE ARE GOING TO WORK. 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT, AND WE 
ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN, AND 
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING 
LIKE NEVER BEFORE. 
 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY, VICTORY, VICTORY. 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS, AND 
OUR HEARTS BLEED, RED, WHITE, 
AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
ONE FAMILY. 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, WISCONSIN. 
THANK YOU.

>> WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL IN WISCONSIN. 
I'M JOINED NOW BY CBS NEWS 
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, 
WEIJIA JIANG WHO IS TRAVELING 
WITH THE PRESIDENT, SHE JOINS 
ME NOW, AND JESSE OBOYEN, IS A 
WRITER FOR THE CAPITAL TIMES. 
AS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE, WE 
HEARD ABOUT ANOTHER SUSPICIOUS 
PACKAGE ADDRESSED TO 
CONGRESSWOMAN MAXINE WATERS. 
IT APPEARS TO BE SIMILAR TO THE 
BOMBS ADDRESSED TO OTHER 
PROMINENT DEMOCRATS AND TRUMP 
CRITICS THIS WEEK. 
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THE 
THREATS. 
I WANT TO PLAY A BITE FROM HIM. 
>> MY HIGHEST DUTY AS PRESIDENT 
IS TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE. 
THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT. 
THAT'S WHAT WE DO. 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS 
CONDUCTING AN AGGRESSIVE 
INVESTIGATION AND WE WILL FIND 
THOSE RESPONSIBLE, AND WE WILL 
BRING THEM TO JUSTICE, 
HOPEFULLY VERY QUICKLY. 
ANY ACTS OR THREATS OF 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE ARE AN 
ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY ITSELF. 
>> WE'RE IN THE FINAL STRETCH 
HERE. 
DO WE KNOW IF THE WHITE HOUSE 
WILL BE USING THIS AS AN ISSUE 
TO GET VOTERS TO THE POLLS? 
>> RIGHT NOW -- ON THEIR 
STRATEGY. 
>> IT IS SO LOUD THERE, WITH 
WEIJIA JIANG IS, WE'RE HAVING 
AUDIO PROBLEMS. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN JESSE NOW. 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE RHETORIC HE'S 
USED. 
DO YOU GET THE SENSE THIS IS A 
CAMPAIGN ISSUE THAT COULD 
MOBILIZE REPUBLICAN VOTERS? 
 
I'M NOT SURE WE
