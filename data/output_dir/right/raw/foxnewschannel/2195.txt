1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:02,270
MUELLER'S TEAM RAISED THE

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,638
PROSPECT OF ISSUING A GRAND JURY

3
00:00:03,638 --> 00:00:04,973
SUBPOENA TO COMPEL THE PRESIDENT

4
00:00:04,973 --> 00:00:09,377
TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH      OATHI

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,246
TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH      OATHF

6
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:11,279
TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH      OATHH

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,080
TO TESTIFY UNDER OATH      OATHE

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,781
DOESN'T SIT DOWN TO TALK.

9
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:19,220
CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROBE.

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,124
>> I KNOW WHEN YOU ARE IN THE

11
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,425
MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION, YOU

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,628
CAN LOSE SOME OBJECTIVITY.

13
00:00:26,628 --> 00:00:28,930
ARE THEY OBJECTIVE ABOUT THE

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,797
PRESIDENTS INTERVIEW?

15
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:30,732
DO THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO THE

16
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:32,967
FACT THAT HE COULD BE TELLING

17
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:35,436
THE TRUTH AND COMEY MAY BE

18
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:35,737
LYING?

19
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:37,271
IF THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND TO

20
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,306
THAT, THEN THIS IS SOMETHING WE

21
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:38,773
WOULD CONSIDER.

22
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:42,944
IF THEY DON'T, THEN GIVEN ALL OF

23
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:44,212
THE IRREGULARITIES IN THE

24
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,080
INVESTIGATION, WE WOULD BE

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,849
FOOLISH TO HAVE HIM BE

26
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:48,249
INTERVIEWED.

27
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:48,883
>> Jesse: HERE ARE SOME

28
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,219
STIPULATIONS FOR AN INTERVIEW.

29
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,654
>> WHAT TO YOU WOULD BE

30
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,623
ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS FOR AN

31
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:55,990
INTERVIEW?

32
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,627
>> TWO HOURS.

33
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,194
>> TOPICS?

34
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,229
>> QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE.

35
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,867
RELEVANT TOPICS.

36
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,102
MEANING RUSSIA, WHICH MAY NOT BE

37
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:08,803
RELEVANT ANY LONGER.

38
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,071
WE WANT A COMMITMENT THAT THEY

39
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,539
ARE GOING TO DECIDE BEFORE THE

40
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,407
END OF THE SUMMER SO WE DON'T

41
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,643
HAVE THIS DRAG ON AND FURTHER

42
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:16,844
IMPERILED THE PRESIDENCY.

43
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,279
>> Jesse: MR. TRUMP FIRING OFF

44
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,216
ON TWITTER ONCE AGAIN.

45
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:22,950
"THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.

46
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:23,518
IT IS A HOAX.

47
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:24,185
AND THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTION

48
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,920
OF JUSTICE.

49
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,257
THAT IS A SETUP AND TRAP."

50
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,658
KIMBERLY, TWO THINGS GOING ON.

51
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,194
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE SHAKE-UP

52
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,629
OF THE LAWYERS IN A SECOND.

53
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,596
IN TERMS OF THE COLLISION COURSE

54
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,365
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ON, WE ARE

55
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,633
EITHER GOING TO HAVE THIS GO ALL

56
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,134
THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT OR

57
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,269
THEY ARE GOING TO ORCHESTRATE

58
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,137
SOME SORT OF CONTROLLED SIT DOWN

59
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,839
WITH MUELLER, ONLY TWO HOURS.

60
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,041
YOU THINK THOSE ARE THE STAKES?

61
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,276
>> Kimberly: I THINK THIS IS

62
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,043
REALLY SMART AND QUITE

63
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:49,710
REASONABLE.

64
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,312
NOBODY WANTS TO EVOLVE AWAY AND

65
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:54,448
DRAG IT OUT.

66
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,150
I THINK RUDY GIULIANI IS PUTTING

67
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,618
SOME REALLY GOOD PARAMETERS AND

68
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,120
LIMITS ON IT TO SAY WE WANT TO

69
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,654
COOPERATE.

70
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,021
WE WANT TO TALK.

71
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,856
LET SIT DOWN.

72
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,858
LET'S LIMIT THE TIME SCOPE AND

73
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,059
HAVE A DISCUSSION AHEAD OF TIME

74
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,461
IN TERMS OF HOW IT SHOULD BE

75
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:07,828
CONDUCTED.

76
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,662
THEN THE PRESIDENT WILL

77
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,097
COOPERATE AND ANSWER THE

78
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,031
QUESTIONS.

79
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,467
THAT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE,

80
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,869
RIGHT?

81
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,036
NOT SOMETHING, TWEETS BEING

82
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,404
FIRED FOR THIS AND THAT OR ANY

83
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:17,872
BACK AND FORTH.

84
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,273
THEY WANT TO ANSWER THOSE

85
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:19,874
QUESTIONS.

86
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:20,774
I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT WHAT HE

87
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,078
SAID.

88
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:25,012
RUDY GIULIANI SAID AS LONG AS I

89
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,448
HAVE AN OPEN MIND, LISTEN TO THE

90
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:28,716
PRESIDENT, HAVE A JUMPED TO A

91
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:32,119
FOREGONE CONCLUSION, THEN THEY

92
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,623
ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN.

93
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,491
>> Jesse: HOW DO YOU DETERMINE

94
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,459
WHETHER MUELLER HAS AN OPEN

95
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,226
MIND?

96
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,228
>> Kimberly: HE SHOULD REPLY

97
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,831
BACK "I HAVE AN OPEN MIND."

98
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,198
[LAUGHTER]

99
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,733
>> Jesse: TY COBB IS OUT.

100
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,835
HE WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR FOR

101
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,470
THE PRESIDENT.

102
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,137
HE GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO

103
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,605
MUELLER AND HE SET UP ALL THE

104
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,540
INTERVIEWS, AND NOW THEY ARE

105
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,675
BRINGING IN THIS IMPEACHMENT

106
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,243
LAWYER THAT WAS WORKING FOR

107
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:56,844
BILL CLINTON.

108
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,445
WHAT SIGNAL DOES IT SENT TO YOU?

109
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,515
>> Dana: HE DIDN'T JUST WORK

110
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:02,416
FOR BILL CLINTON.

111
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,218
I KNOW EMMETT FLOOD VERY WELL.

112
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:04,785
HE WORKED IN THE BUSH

113
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,420
WHITE HOUSE AS WELL.

114
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,022
I KNOW ABOUT HOW HE THINKS.

115
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,591
HE HAS A WONDERFUL, DRY SENSE OF

116
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,827
HUMOR, HE IS A VERY LAWYER.

117
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,196
WE WERE HAVING THE U.S. ATTORNEY

118
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,231
SITUATION WHERE THE DEMOCRATS

119
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,565
WERE DEMANDING ALL THE

120
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,233
DOCUMENTS.

121
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,634
WE WERE TRYING TO PRODUCE THEM

122
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,671
AS FAST AS WE COULD.

123
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:26,440
THE SAME EXACT ARGUMENT THAT THE

124
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,474
REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING TODAY

125
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,676
AGAINST THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

126
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,077
FOR NOT RELEASING DOCUMENTS,

127
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,245
IT'S A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHAT

128
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:35,049
HAPPENED IN 2007 AND 2008.

129
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,284
I THINK EMMETT IS A MUCH MORE

130
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,852
ASSERTIVE AND AGGRESSIVE TYPE OF

131
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:39,486
PERSON.

132
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,821
HE KNOWS SPECIAL COUNSEL LAW

133
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,288
EXTREMELY WELL.

134
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:45,859
I THINK THERE'S THE FEELING THAT

135
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:48,028
THE ORIGINAL TEAM WAS TOO

136
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:48,962
ACCOMMODATING TO THE MUELLER

137
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:49,396
INVESTIGATION.

138
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,364
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

139
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:50,764
CHANGE.

140
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,266
I THINK WHEN RUDY GIULIANI SAYS

141
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,268
THAT THIS WOULD BE A TWO HOUR

142
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,870
INTERVIEW AND WE WILL HAVE TO

143
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,272
SEE, THE NARROW SCOPE, I THINK

144
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,774
THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT EMMET FLOOD

145
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,876
TALKED TO THEM ABOUT.

146
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,610
JAY SEKULOW DID A LOT OF

147
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,478
INTERVIEW WITH EMMET TO GET TO

148
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:04,878
THIS POINT.

149
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,980
I THINK WE FORGET, IT WAS ABOUT

150
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,483
FIVE WEEKS AGO THAT DONALD

151
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,083
McGAHN, THE PRESIDENTS

152
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:10,751
WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL SAID HE

153
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,818
WOULD LIKE TO BE GONE BY THE

154
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,286
SUMMER, THAT HE WOULD STAY UNTIL

155
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,521
HE FOUND HIS REPLACEMENT AND

156
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,057
THAT COULD EXTEND THE MIDTERM.

157
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,257
BUT EMMET FLOOD I THINK WE'LL

158
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,493
END UP BEING THE WHITE HOUSE

159
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,461
COUNSEL BEFORE THE END OF THE

160
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:21,795
SUMMER.

161
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:22,362
>> Jesse: ALL RIGHT.

162
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,130
GREG, WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM

163
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,232
THE WHITE HOUSE IS, YOU KNOW, I

164
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,602
AM PREPARING TO BROKER PEACE ON

165
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,070
THE NORTH KOREAN PENINSULA.

166
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,471
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING IN

167
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:31,772
SYRIA.

168
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,974
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE IRANIAN

169
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,842
NUCLEAR SITUATION AND NOW YOU'RE

170
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,576
MAKING ME SPEND HOURS PREPPING

171
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,846
FOR A SITDOWN AND WASTING MY

172
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,380
TIME ON THIS.

173
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,449
>> Greg: YEAH, IT IS LIKE

174
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,617
STUDYING FOR THE S.A.T. WHILE

175
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,454
YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDE A BIKE.

176
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,089
ANYWAY, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

177
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,791
HE SHOULD ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

178
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,191
ON TWITTER.

179
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,260
THAT'S WHAT HE SHOULD DO.

180
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,262
I THINK TWO HOURS IS WAY TOO

181
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:55,562
LONG.

182
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,063
I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD HAVE

183
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,064
GIVEN THEM ANY TIME.

184
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,066
DO IT IN WRITING SOMEHOW.

185
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,268
WHAT BOTHERS ME MOST ABOUT THIS

186
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,470
IS THAT THE INVESTIGATION, THE

187
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,237
MEDIA, THE DEMOCRATS ALL APPEAR

188
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,873
TO BE WORKING IN TANDEM.

189
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,642
IT'S LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY.

190
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,113
THE IRAN DEAL, THE DEMOCRATS

191
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:17,017
PUSH THE MESSAGE, THE MEDIA.

192
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:20,620
WHAT IS THE ECHO IN THE CHAMBER?

193
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,621
UNSEAT AND IMPEACH.

194
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,889
INSTEAD OF A COUNTER VISION

195
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,824
WHICH REQUIRES IDEAS FROM

196
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,060
DEMOCRATS.

197
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,995
THEY ARE RELYING ON THE OUSTER

198
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,329
SWITCH.

199
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,263
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THIS GUY

200
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,633
AND THIS IS LATE TO DO IT.

201
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,335
YOU ARE POINT, WE ARE PROBABLY

202
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,304
IN ONE OF THE MOST OPTIMISTIC

203
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,271
PERIODS OF RECENT HISTORY

204
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,073
BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING THE

205
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,274
ABSENCE OF ISIS VIDEOS.

206
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,443
WE ARE WATCHING THE ABSENCE OF A

207
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,644
NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR THREAT.

208
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,246
LOOKING AT A STRONG ECONOMY AND

209
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,013
DECLINING CRIME OVERALL WHICH IS

210
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:59,092
KIND OF INTERESTING.

211
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:00,026
KIND OF INTERESTING.

212
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,760
HAVE THEY ACTUALLY PLANNED THIS

213
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,027
OUT?

214
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,694
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PLANTED.

215
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,395
THEY COULD TRY TO IMPEACH THE

216
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,129
GUIDE THAT THEY SHOULD THINK IN

217
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:03,830
THE LONG TERM, WHAT IS IT MEAN

218
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,297
OF THE COUNTRY?

219
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:04,998
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HALF THE

220
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:05,331
COUNTRY?

221
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,032
WHAT IS IT MEAN TO THE WORLD.

222
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,733
IT'S NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON THE

223
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,167
UNITED STATES.

224
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:07,867
IF THE WORLD IS GETTING LESS

225
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,201
VIOLENT.

226
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:08,868
THE WORLD IS GETTING SAFER

227
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,603
BECAUSE OF A REDUCED

228
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,072
NORTH KOREAN THREAT.

229
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,007
IT'S ABOUT THE WORLD.

230
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,042
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO BE

231
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:16,843
THINKING GLOBALLY?

232
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,945
>> Jesse: YES, JUAN, LET'S

233
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,680
THINK GLOBALLY.

234
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,581
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

235
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,682
>> Juan: TO ME, IT'S A MORE

236
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,450
AGGRESSIVE STANCE.

237
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,318
YOU ARE BRINGING IN SOMEBODY WHO

238
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:29,022
IS A PUNCHER AND WHO KNOWS HOW

239
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:29,455
TO FIGHT.

240
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,158
THE THING IS, I THINK IT'S JAY

241
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,259
SEKULOW WHO HAS TAKEN THE LEAD

242
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,928
IN SAYING TO TY COBB I THINK

243
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,829
IT'S TIME TO GO.

244
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,098
I THINK YOU HAVE SEEN THE SAME

245
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,366
THING WITH JOHN DOWD.

246
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,301
BOTH OF THEM KIND OF WERE OF A

247
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:45,305
MIND TO SAY THE PRESIDENT, IF

248
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,073
YOU CAN TALK, LET'S TALK, WILL

249
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,042
WE DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA

250
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,644
AND WE COUNSEL AGAINST IT.

251
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,645
THE PRESIDENT WASN'T LISTENING

252
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,113
BUT AFTER MICHAEL COHEN'S OFFICE

253
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,284
WAS RATED, I THINK THE PRESIDENT

254
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,254
HAS MORE -- YOU ARE STARTING TO

255
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,256
SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE FROM

256
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,291
THE LITIGATION PHASE I THINK,

257
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,493
FROM THE DISCOVERY PHASE, I

258
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,661
SHOULD SAY, TO LITIGATION AND

259
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,095
