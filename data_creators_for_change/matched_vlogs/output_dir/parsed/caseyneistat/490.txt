still it's still ringing Wow
two
Saturday morning in the night stat
household little one after breakfast now
this place has toys for the baby Kenneth
and I take turns it's like a tag-team
operation she watches the baby and I eat
and I watch the baby feeds nice
balancing job Francine
how was your breakfast
you
baby is down per afternoon nap I'm
sneaking into the office quickly to get
a little bit of work done I'd also love
to get a babysitter so Ken and I could
go out tonight but I also don't think
that's going to happen
also the cameras in the telephone booth
right now
see it's always more fun to feature the
new construction like the new red wall
and mining desk and my second new desk
what's a lot less sexy to talk about is
the deconstruction that's happening for
example back in my my former office here
this whole wall which used to be
beautiful had the speakers up here
decimated in fact this entire office has
just been like destroyed this office is
going to be the apex of the new studio
design so it's going to be the most
destroyed the most broken down before it
gets built back up right now we're
attacking the easy things the desk the
wall should be done very soon this area
here all should be done soon the very
last thing we're gonna tackle the last
thing we're going to take on the room in
the back
this is an opaque projector you're
taking em image inside here it's
supposed to project that image on
whatever is in front of it but it's not
strong it doesn't work okay
this is a multimedia projector this
should work you should want to have to
move it
sweet feel pretty good about this gonna
do a nice molding by the play button
here but I need the wood to be black
underneath it so I'm cheating it with
just a little bit of paint nice nice
alright gotta get home that was some
good progress though studio renovations
is like it's like chopping down a
gigantic oak tree you go with like chip
chip chip away in it and eventually the
entire tree will fall I think if I can
get in there tomorrow by Monday I will
have like cross the precipice from
construction site to something that
feels look at its light look at that you
can't see it up up the roof
Wow look at this light it's incredible
here here's an amazing time-lapse
isn't that crazy that's like realists
not even CGI I got really cold while
shooting that time-lapse all right going
home now
I told Candace I needed to run to work
for a minute that was four and a half
hours ago so I'm not entirely sure what
I'm walking into here can't wait you
have to be in the show can't how did I
see look at the lighting candles Casey
date night but we only have the
babysitter for like one hour so this is
gonna be a super fast
date night

cosmetic store okay come on let's go
okay now we got to get home from the
babysitter Wow two three fucking Candace

people to leave
