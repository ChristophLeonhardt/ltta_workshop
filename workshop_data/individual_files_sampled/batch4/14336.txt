it goes either way but Trump ah that guy I'll know that something about him no yeah remember when Sports was all about fun and games well last week President Donald Trump was to host a Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles but canceled that get together on fears that many of the members of the team wouldn't show up and that some of them might even take a knee during the playing of the national anthem so how do members of generation Trudeau feel about President Trump giving the Eagles the bird let's find out well we're asking people if it was right for Donald Trump to disinvite the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles to the White House last week man well I have no idea about sports I really don't know I can't tell you but I don't like Donald Trump in general why don't you like him and I think that he is he's the only guy who actually understands what the is happening okay so whatever this guy did did it for the best of the country what about yourself sir Donald Trump the whole story but whatever Donald Trump is trying to do whatever drama whatever kind of thing just needs to stop the world means just love peace that's it everything needs to just completely stop with everything I'm English and I think Trump's an absolutely my pet a muppet yeah you're saying that the US has to be more like Canada yeah because we're a piece country so why is it that we're not hit with any bombs we're not threatened we're not yeah we are in a different aspect but we're not actually harming anybody do you think Donald Trump has to be more like Justin Trudeau yeah no Justin Trudeau you have to be careful honestly I don't think it really matters that they he disinvited them because they weren't coming anyway but I mean realistically who wants to go there that shows what to disinvite them because no one wants to go there that was a big part of the problem a lot of the Eagle players were said they were not going to show up but do you think there's criticism warranted to those players for disrespecting the Office of the President I mean through any situation there's gonna be people for you and against you that's how I see it do you think maybe we should end these White House meetings perhaps for the sports or like it's getting too complicated too political I think politics and sports are two different things and they shouldn't intertwine you know if someone in this sport if someone's a professional athlete and they don't want to meet Donald Trump that's their own choice but I think it's kind of cool to see the White House and if they don't respect their president then so be it you know it definitely makes a statement about like how these players feel about the the state of the United States right now and like the just the general politics around how President Trump has handled black lives like black issues in there in that country all those disrespectful that you disinvited them I'm not surprised because he wants complete power I'm not taking power away from him you have Obama haters you got Trump haters it goes either way but Trump ah that guy I don't that something about him no no I just honestly think there needs to be more love and more peace and people need to like learn how to like work together to make the world a better place that's all it is the Washington Capitals will go to the White House ah you know I think I think Alexander Ovechkin will you know he's the first Russian captain to ever win the NHL Stanley Cup and they're gonna go you're suggesting Russian collusion right I know collusion there he's a good guy and he won the Stanley Cup you gotta give him credit where it's due do you agree with that kind of protest sir it's silent that's all it is did I make any noise they're simply taking a knee they're not making any noise they're not killing anybody in the streets but Donald Trump and his people are hey are you supporting Tommy Robinson by the way no to the Green Party hey folks the rumble has a brand new app please download that app and take the rubble with you wherever you go you
