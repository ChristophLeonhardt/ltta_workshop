but speaking of unclear reporting it broke news this morning that rod Rosenstein the Deputy Attorney General was out at the FBI or at the I'm sorry at the Department of Justice that he was being fired or he had resigned or his being called in to Kelly and that he's out and so then in that case the Solicitor General of the United States is going to come into his his place and oversee the Muller investigation a new Trudeau to do so then he goes and meets with general Kelly at the White House and now it seems that he's not fired it seems that he's still on the job why was he possibly gonna be fired because it came out that he had talked in a room with Lisa Paige I believe was there Andy McCabe had said that he was that he would wear a wire and thought that the 25th amendment should be invoked to kick Donald Trump out of office now another source in this room in that room said that he was just joking you don't get to make those jokes at this time you don't get to make those jokes when you're a senior official who's overseeing a highly politicized investigation that has employed people who have said that they're going to subvert the election of the the American people's election of Donald Trump and try to kick him out of office and prevent him from being president you don't get to see that when there were a tax calls for impeachment you don't get to joke about those things if that's the case so anyway he was brought in and now and he's apparently still on the job he was at a meeting later and in his official capacity and but by the time that it was reported that maybe he was going to get fired David Frum former conservative David Frum who's now pearl clutching at the Atlantic he wrote a piece and published it titled Rosen Stein's departure is a national emergency and said quote special counsel Robert Mulder's investigation is now in mortal peril and therefore you know this is a national emergency for the United States so first of all this is kind of awkward for him he pulled the trigger a little fast here because it seems that Rosen Stein is not fired at least as of yet but also it's not a national emergency it's fine it's fine I think what you meant to say is that it's fine it's it we have this means look if he gets fired the Solicitor General comes up he oversees the Moller investigation who cares who cares by the way the Muller investigation into collusion between Trump and interference and the Russia they've found no evidence that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to borrow a mostly empty phrase they've got nothing they've gonna I should write another book called the findings of the Moller investigation that'll be my second bestseller I'll sell as many copies as the first
