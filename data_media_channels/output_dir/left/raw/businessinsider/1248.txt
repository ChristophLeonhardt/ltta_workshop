00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
suddenly I saw what looked like chunks

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,879
of flame falling all around the top of

12
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,190
going bankrupt if you're an adventurer

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,210
you've got to protect against the

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,860
downside and that is the downside of

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,620
really strong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'd have a</font>
