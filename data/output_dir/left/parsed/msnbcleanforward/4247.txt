the darkest situation is not an
immigration issue it's a moral issue
this is one that goes to the core of who
we are as Americans who among us would
think that it's the right thing to do to
kick somebody out of this country that
came here when they were 1 to 3 years
old that have only known this country as
their home that know no other countries
their home this just doesn't make any
sense
