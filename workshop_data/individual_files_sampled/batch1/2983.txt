we're a lot of ones my dad always says we're a lot more alike than I say but I think that we have so much in common our interests creatively I think are immensely the same we do not have the same taste in women I like brunettes he likes blondes but I don't think the Apple follows very far from the tree when I think about sort of big picture ideas of how we both want to live our lives what matters to him those sort of things the best piece of advice my dad ever gave me was find something to do in life that you enjoy waking up for you should be happy when you get up in the morning you're not happy you're not doing something right I've been given this incredible opportunity to be associated with one of the most famous brands in the world that is a blessing beyond explanation I'm very lucky to be doing and spending my days working on something I'm really passionate about my dad if I were to sit and say what he's taught me or what he's recommended in the workplace or in relationships likeability that's definitely what he's taught me when you talk to him about what his beliefs are and why he's chosen all of the life he lives I think that my dad has lived the life that maybe is not traditional but he has never apologized for it he's never apologized for the decisions that he's made I think that that's why he's respected and light I think so much of what matters in life in business and really whatever profession you go into is whether or not you're likeable you
