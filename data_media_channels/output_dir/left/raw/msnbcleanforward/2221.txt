THEY SHOULDN’T SEE HEALTH CARE EAT UP AS MUCH AS IT IS.

79
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:38,649
EAT UP AS MUCH AS IT IS. THEY SHOULD SEE THE GOVERNMENT

80
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,488
THEY SHOULD SEE THE GOVERNMENT INVEST IN SCHOOLS.

81
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,256
INVEST IN SCHOOLS. THAT’S THE AMERICAN BARGAIN AND

82
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,357
THAT’S THE AMERICAN BARGAIN AND THAT’S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,158
THAT’S WHAT THE PRESIDENT PROMISED IMPROVED.

84
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,760
PROMISED IMPROVED. WHEN HE GOES OVER AND WRECKS

85
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,528
WHEN HE GOES OVER AND WRECKS THESE ALLIANCES, THERE’S GOING

86
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,562
THESE ALLIANCES, THERE’S GOING TO BE A BIGGER COST TO PAY IN

WE’RE NOT HELPLESS TO THE SLOW MOVING TRAIN WRECK.

90
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:58,136
MOVING TRAIN WRECK. WE CAN ACTUALLY STOP IT FROM

00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,840
HAPPENING IF CONGRESS WAS WILLING TO PUT THE BRAKES ON AND

93
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,274

00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,391
THAT’S GOING TO HURT ALL OF US. >> THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT

107
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:22,194
>> THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER NATO HE GOES TO THE UK,

108
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:24,095
AFTER NATO HE GOES TO THE UK, THEN MEETS WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.

00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,592
FIRST CONFRONT PUTIN DIRECTLY AND TELL HIM THERE’S A PRICE TO

00:03:53,635 --> 00:03:56,795
AND TELL HIM THERE’S A PRICE TO PAY IF THERE’S FUTURE MEDDLING.

125
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:59,331
PAY IF THERE’S FUTURE MEDDLING. ALSO, THE CHAOS GOING ON IN

VERY CRITICAL OF BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU DON’T HAVE

142
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,067
BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU DON’T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO BLOCK HIS

143
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:35,467
ENOUGH VOTES TO BLOCK HIS CONFIRMATION.

144
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,403
CONFIRMATION. IF I’M A RED STATE DEMOCRAT, HOW

00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,672
IF I’M A RED STATE DEMOCRAT, HOW DIFFICULT IS THIS POSITION?

IT’S NOT ABOUT ONE PERSON. IT’S A QUALIFIED JUDGE.

159
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:03,296
IT’S A QUALIFIED JUDGE. WE SHOULD RESPECT THAT.

RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS AT YOUR DOCTOR’S OFFICE.

166
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:13,606
DOCTOR’S OFFICE. I THINK BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

167
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:17,910
I THINK BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THERE’S GOING TO BE A

168
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:18,978
HAS SAID THERE’S GOING TO BE A MITT MUSS

169

170
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:22,915
LITMUS TEST AND HE’S ONLY GOING TO APPOINT PRO-LIFE JUDGES, THIS

171
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,617
TO APPOINT PRO-LIFE JUDGES, THIS JUDGE NEEDS TO BE ASKED DIRECTLY

172
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:27,587
JUDGE NEEDS TO BE ASKED DIRECTLY WHETHER HE WILL RESPECT THE

173
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,721
WHETHER HE WILL RESPECT THE PRECEDENT OF ROE V. WADE.

174
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,823
PRECEDENT OF ROE V. WADE. ALSO, THE CONTEXT HERE IS THE

175
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,891
ALSO, THE CONTEXT HERE IS THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER CRIMINAL

00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,092
PRESIDENT IS UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND THE LAWSUITS

177

00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:37,530
SEEM TO BE FLOWING IN EVERY DAY ON THE CIVIL SIDE.

179
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,532
ON THE CIVIL SIDE. JUDGE’S VIEW THAT A PRESIDENT IS

180
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,933
JUDGE’S VIEW THAT A PRESIDENT IS IMMUNE FROM CIVIL AND CRIMINAL

181
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:43,370
IMMUNE FROM CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIGHT, MAYBE WITH ANOTHER

182
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,103
LIGHT, MAYBE WITH ANOTHER PRESIDENT, THAT MIGHT BE OKAY.

183
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,005
PRESIDENT, THAT MIGHT BE OKAY. IF THIS PRESIDENT ASKED HIM TO

184
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:48,007
IF THIS PRESIDENT ASKED HIM TO BE INOCULATED, I THINK WE NEED

185
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,242

00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,144

IT IS ABOUT POLITICS AND THE MASTER MIND WHO PLAYED THE GAME

192
