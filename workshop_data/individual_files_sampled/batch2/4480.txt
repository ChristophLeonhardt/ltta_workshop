special counsels indictment of 12 Russian military intelligence officers last week was remarkable for lots of reasons told us a lot more detail about what is going on with the Russia scandal and the Russian attack on our election in 2016 but I was also really detailed I mean it included information about specific named Russian military intelligence officers using specific computers at specific addresses on specific dates at specific times they revealed this incredible level of penetration into Russian operations by US counterintelligence and US law enforcement it was surprising to read and including so I think some people in the law-enforcement community were surprised to read it like wow hey we can do that and B we're letting everybody know we can do that but while the amount of forensic detail in that indictment was extraordinary and made for fascinating reading and makes for a very airtight indictment it wasn't necessarily unprecedented indictments like this are rare but they exist they're a relatively new phenomenon prior to 2014 we'd never seen an indictment like this that all changed when for the very first time the US government brought a criminal indictment law enforcement indictment against military workers excuse me military hackers who were working for a foreign government 2014 the Justice Department today filed the first ever criminal charges against officials of a foreign government for stealing US economic secrets by computer inside this building in Shanghai prosecutors say five members of the Chinese army each named that an indictment hacked directly into the computers of US companies they can see here at the Justice Department it's unlikely these five men charged today will ever see the inside of a US courtroom but they say it's a way of letting the Chinese know that the u.s. is watching more closely than ever it's a way of letting them know that the u.s. is watching that closely question I think both then with that groundbreaking indictment and now with this new blockbuster one is what's the overall strategic benefit here why disclose all of this technical information about what the US government knows how it knows it when those same foreign military hackers really won't ever see the inside of a US courtroom right you spell out exactly what America knew about the Russian hack how we've penetrated their operations that means we all now know and the Russians all now know that America was on to them this whole time and what America's capabilities are for looking at that kind of foreign operation from what they call us sources of methods standpoint it kind of just seems like a lot of information to give up particularly if the people you're charging are never gonna go to jail because they're never coming to this country I mean like molars indictment last week that 24 indictment of Chinese military hackers was meticulous in its detail down to specific actions and locational information about individual named Chinese hackers the architect of that 2014 indictment and the strategy behind it was a former US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania cybersecurity expert named David hickton he's the guy who started the US government down this path now we're seeing how it works in the Russia scandal joining us now for the interview is that former US attorney from the Western District of Pennsylvania he sailed the founding director of the University of Pittsburgh Institute for cyber law policy and security mr. Hecht and thank you so much for coming in it's really nice to have you here thank you for the invitation was that a fair description that indictment that Chinese hackers indictment was sort of the first time this had been done well done that was the first time that that tool had been used and we indicted nation-state adversaries and we're very proud of that it was very important not only because it was a legal event but it was also representative of describing what hacking meant to our citizens because we put a face on not only the adversaries who were attached to the back of the indictment but we were able to describe the victims and tell the story about what hacking meant in the context of the Chinese signature and am i right that in that in indictment the u.s. the American public anybody who bothered to read that indictment any of us who saw news reports about it essentially learn something not just about what China was doing but about what our government could do both to witness that to document it to trace it back to the bad actors who did it and to monitor those kinds of activities in the future we learned a lot about America's counter telogen scape abilities we did and and and I'm among those who believed that we needed to reverse a default decision in the government to allow hacking to occur without any consequence because it was difficult our four principal nation state adversaries are China Russia North Korea and Iran that was about China and it reflected our unmasking of their signature I personally believe long-term Russia is our most significant adversary and they have a different signature which was reflected in the Muller indictment of last week but because being invisible is the principal currency of our hacking adversaries unmasking them is very important and how does it hurt them to show what they are doing obviously it means for the individuals who are charged they can't come to this country in some cases depending on the jurisdiction they may find it hard to travel internationally writ large not just travel to the United States how else does it hurt them if their government is never going to send them here to be tried cyber hacking is not an incident it's a campaign and therefore our response to it has to be a campaign okay and so by bringing these indictments we are opening up the toolbox to expand the number of tools we can use against this now I brought that indictment against China and another one against Russia two weeks after that with the full expectation that we might be able to bring them to an American courtroom but I was not limited in that and in an actual fact the Chinese indictment led one year later to an agreement between President Obama and President Xi in September 2015 where there was an agreement between the two countries about the difference between spying and intellectual property theft there are other forms we can take these cases to we can take them to Treasury we can take into commerce we could debar companies they can be used as President Obama did for the basis for sanctions against North Korea where we can identify who the adversary is but we can't necessarily get our hands on him now we've done this before in this country with regard to the drug wars we had in the 90s with a country named Colin which we now have good extradition with and we have largely with we haven't solved the drug problem we've largely improved the situation in places like South Florida and that was a campaign and some of the same naysayers made arguments at that time well you're gonna let them know what what evidence you have on them you can't get them in the courtroom and therefore this is futile and that is a reasonable point of view which I strongly disagree with because we cannot we have to treat the effort to stop hacking like the effort to go to the moon President Kennedy said we do this not because it's easy but because it's hard and I said that many times his US attorney sure it's gonna be more difficult to bring someone from China to Pittsburgh for a trial but what would we do otherwise surrender I wouldn't accept that and I think the significance of the recent disclosures in the case brought by special prosecutor Muller is not only the specificity that you outlined with respect to the timing sequence and synchronicity with regard to the campaign and the tease with regard to who might be the Americans who might be connected to these Russians but it reflects another very important general proposition the Russian architecture in this country sitting there which creates the avenue for them to do hacking the mall malware that they installed the work that they did do implant things in our systems here and leave them be that has to be taken account of that is that that circle is now complete David hickton is our guest for the interview we'll be right back with him with more right after this hey there I'm Chris Hayes from
