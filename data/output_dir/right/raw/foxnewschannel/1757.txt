1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,234
THAT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS

2
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:02,469
NOT WHAT THEY SAID IT WAS.

3
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,804
IT IS THAT HAS BEEN FROM THE

4
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:08,041
BEGINNING BEEN A WITCH HUNT.

5
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,810
TOM HAS BEEN HAS BEEN TRACKING

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,144
THE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE VERY

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,646
FIRST DAY AND HE'S ALSO THE

8
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:13,380
PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH AND

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,048
HE JOINS US NOW.

10
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,184
TOM, IS THAT AN UNFAIR SUMMARY

11
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:17,985
OF WHAT WE LEARNED?

12
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,654
HAVE I MISSED SOMETHING?

13
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,689
HAVE WE GOTTEN ANY INDICATION OF

14
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,790
ACTUAL COLLUSION A YEAR INTO

15
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,091
THIS?

16
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,258
>> NO WE HAVEN'T.

17
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,830
YOU'VE BEEN MUCH TOO CHARITABLE.

18
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,932
IF HONESTLY EVALUATED, THE

19
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:32,799
MUELLER INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN

20
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER.

21
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,971
IF THE MEDIA WERE COVERING THE

22
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,306
MUELLER INVESTIGATION THE WAY IT

23
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:40,374
WAS COVERING THE TRUMP

24
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,208
PRESIDENCY I THINK WE WOULD ALL

25
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,310
AGREE IT HASN'T WORKED.

26
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,479
IT'S FAILING.

27
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,081
IT WAS CREATED BASED ON AN

28
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,050
ILLEGAL LEAK BY JAMES COMEY.

29
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,051
MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO INSPIRE

30
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,053
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION WERE

31
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,688
FIRED FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

32
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,456
SALLY EIGHTS, THE ACTING

33
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:56,957
ATTORNEY GENERAL.

34
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,393
ANDREW McCABE, THE DEPUTY AG.

35
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,030
JAMES COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR.

36
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,931
ANDREW McCABE, EXCUSE ME THE

37
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,466
DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR.

38
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,834
ALL THREE FIRED FOR MISCONDUCT.

39
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,836
THEY HELP GET THE MUELLER

40
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,904
INVESTIGATION WILL IMPAIRED THE

41
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,207
CLINTON EMAIL DOSSIER.

42
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,209
WE HAVE THE FLYNN INVESTIGATION

43
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,613
UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE OF THE

44
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,148
CORRUPT WAY WHICH IT WAS

45
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,049
INITIATED AND INVESTIGATED BY

46
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,517
THE FBI WERE HIT THEY THAT HE

47
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,419
LIED WHEN EVIDENTLY HE DIDN'T.

48
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,654
AND ON TOP OF THAT WE GOT A

49
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:29,089
FEDERAL JUDGE QUESTIONING THE

50
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:29,690
ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OF

51
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,857
MR. MUELLER AND WE STILL DON'T

52
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:32,059
KNOW WHAT HIS AUTHORITY IS A

53
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,894
YEAR OUT BECAUSE HE HAS

54
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:34,528
EVIDENTLY HAD SECRET

55
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,264
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE JUSTICE

56
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:37,664
DEPARTMENT.

57
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,802
AND ON TOP OF IT, THE RUSSIA,

58
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,470
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION, THE

59
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,337
KEY ASPECT OF IT, THE RUSSIA

60
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,473
TROLL INDICTMENT, IT'S NOW BEING

61
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,410
TURNED INTO WHEN OPPORTUNITY FOR

62
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,380
THE RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE TO GO

63
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,250
IN AND DEMAND EVIDENCE FOR WHAT

64
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,085
THEY HAVE ON INTELLIGENCE

65
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:58,819
OPERATIONS, MAINLY INTERVENTION

66
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:02,656
IN ORDER ELECTION.

67
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:03,457
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

68
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,059
VICTIMIZED THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

69
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,228
EVIDENTLY THERE'S NOTHING TO

70
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,663
JUSTIFY AN INVESTIGATION OF HIM

71
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,799
REQUIRING JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

72
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,868
RESOURCES.

73
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,635
>> Tucker: I THOUGHT --

74
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,071
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE

75
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:18,772
WHOLE POINT OF THE INDEPENDENT

76
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,641
COUNSEL IS TO ENSURE THE REST OF

77
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,676
US THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS ON

78
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,112
THE LEVEL, NOT TAINTED BY

79
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:25,679
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS.

80
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,215
GIVEN THAT, WHY DIDN'T MUELLER

81
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,750
TRY HARDER TO AT LEAST SEEN BY

82
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,953
PART OF BIPARTISAN, MAYBE HIRING

83
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:33,687
ONE REGISTER OF REPUBLICAN AS

84
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,956
INVESTIGATOR, HE DIDN'T BOTHER

85
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:36,656
TO DO THAT.

86
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,024
>> THE ARROGANCE OF THE DEEP

87
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:38,325
STATE.

88
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,228
THEY THINK THEY CAN DO NO WRONG.

89
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,262
MUELLER AND COMEY ARE PART OF

90
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,864
THE SAME TEAM ON THAT REGARD.

91
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:44,931
ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE THEM

92
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,201
HIRING DEMOCRATS WITH ABANDON

93
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:53,206
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE TEXT

94
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,207
MESSAGES.

95
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,377
HE KEPT THOSE TWO FBI AGENTS OFF

96
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,645
OF HIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OF

97
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,847
BIAS AND HID THAT FROM THE

98
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,049
AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR FOUR MONTHS.

99
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,284
MR. COMEY, IF YOU ARE A TYPICAL

100
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,086
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WOULD HAVE

101
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,654
BEEN ASKED TO RESIGN A LONG TIME

102
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:07,921
AGO.

103
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,688
>> Tucker: THAT'S A REALLY

104
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,290
GOOD POINT.

105
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,224
TOM FITTON, FOLLOWING THIS FROM

106
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,660
DAY ONE, THANK YOU.

107
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,628
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

108
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,129
>> Tucker: IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

109
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,197
THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S FOR

110
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,498
LUNCH IS STILL MUCH WHAT WAS

111
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,600
FOCUS ON RUSSIA COLLUSION MAY

112
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,470
HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE POLITICALLY.

113
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,938
AN ARTICLE THIS MORNING IN

114
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,572
"THE DAILY BEAST" MAKES A

115
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,073
LUDICROUS CLAIM.

116
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,175
IT SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY

117
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,409
WANTED TO SPEND THE LAST YEAR

118
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,845
AND A HALF TALKING ABOUT REAL

119
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,512
ISSUES, HEALTH CARE AND THE

120
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,248
ECONOMY, BUT THEY COULDN'T

121
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,850
SOMEHOW BECAUSE CABLE NEWS STOPS

122
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,150
THEM.

123
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,052
RACHEL MADDOW TOLD THEM NOT TO

124
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,053
APPARENTLY.

125
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,321
CABLE INSTEAD FORCED THEM TO

126
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,422
TALK ABOUT RUSSIA.

127
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,824
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO.

128
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,759
LUCKILY WE KEPT COPIES OF THE

129
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,660
TAPE AND HERE'S WHAT THEY

130
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,664
ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT RUSSIA.

131
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,731
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT

132
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,469
RUSSIA ATTACKED US.

133
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,338
>> ATTACK ON THE INTEGRITY OF

134
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:58,772
OUR ELECTIONS.

135
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,674
>> AN ATTACK ON OUR DEMOCRACY.

136
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,908
>> WE ARE ONLY AT THE BEGINNING

137
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,910
OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE

138
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,445
RUSSIANS DID TO AFFECT OUR

139
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,446
ELECTIONS.

140
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,113
>> I THINK THERE IS A BROAD

141
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,049
RECOGNITION AMONG OUR MEMBERS

142
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,251
THAT RUSSIA IS NOT OUR FRIEND.

143
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
>> WHY DOES AN OUTWARD

144
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,019
DONALD TRUMP THAT THE RUSSIANS

145
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,655
ACCORDING TO THE INTELLIGENCE

146
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,257
COMMUNITY TRIED TO, AND INDEED

147
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,925
DID KIND OF INFILTRATE AND

148
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,692
UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY BY WHAT

149
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,894
THEY DID?

150
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,096
>> Tucker: RICHARD GOODSTEIN

151
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,832
IS A LAWYER, HE ADVISED BOTH OF

152
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,566
HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL

153
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,134
CAMPAIGNS AND HE JOINS US

154
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:28,902
TONIGHT FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE A

155
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,038
TOUGH CONVERSATION I   FOR HIM I

156
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,474
WOULD SAY.

157
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,175
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

158
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:35,876
>> Tucker: IT'S NOT REALLY

159
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,776
POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CASE -- YOU

160
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,846
CAN ARGUE THAT RUSSIA HACKED OUR

161
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,647
ELECTION AS DEMOCRATS HAVE

162
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,581
ARGUED FOR THE LAST YEAR.

163
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,917
THEY ARE OUR MAIN ENEMY IN THE

164
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,886
WORLD AS THEY ALSO ARGUE.

165
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,053
MAYBE TIME WILL PROVE YOU'RE

166
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:47,454
RIGHT.

167
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,855
I DOUBT IT BUT MAY BE.

168
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,056
YOU CAN'T ARGUE IF YOU ARE A

169
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,658
DEMOCRAT THAT WHAT YOU REALLY

170
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,859
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE

171
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,193
ISSUES.

172
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:53,960
IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO

173
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,395
TALK ABOUT RUSSIA, YOU JUST

174
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,663
HAPPEN TO TALK ABOUT IT NONSTOP

175
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,297
FOR A YEAR.

176
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,431
NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THAT

177
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,668
BECAUSE IT'S A LIE.

178
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,669
>> IF THE INTELLIGENCE

179
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,038
COMMUNITY, NOT DEMOCRATS, NOT

180
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:05,672
REPUBLICANS.

181
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,506
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS

182
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,941
THE GROUP THAT SAID THAT THE

183
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,076
RUSSIANS TRY TO UNDERMINE OUR

184
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:10,844
DEMOCRACY.

185
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,846
DON'T LAY THAT OFF ON ME.

186
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,381
>> Tucker: THERE IS NO

187
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:14,814
INTELLIGENCE.

188
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:20,287
THERE ARE A NUMBER A FEDERAL

189
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,488
AGENCIES, THERE IS NO

190
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,088
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

191
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,757
THERE IS NO CONSENSUS ON

192
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,257
ANYTHING.

193
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:24,891
>> THERE'S A DIRECTOR OF

194
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,094
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

195
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:28,862
HEAD OF CIA.

196
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,997
EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO IS

197
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,865
CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING

198
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,266
INTELLIGENCE FOR THIS COUNTRY

199
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,467
WHEN ASKED AND WHEN THEIR AGENCY

200
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,536
WAS ASKS THAT THE RUSSIANS TRY

201
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:36,970
TO INTERFERE.

202
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,339
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE

203
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,607
RUSSIANS APPROACHED THE TRUMP

204
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,642
CAMPAIGN AND SAID WE HAVE STOLEN

205
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,677
MATERIALS, WOULD YOU LIKE THEM

206
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,745
FROM THE HILLARY CLINTON

207
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,112
CAMPAIGN.

208
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,248
DONALD TRUMP JR. SAID LOVE IT.

209
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,250
PUTTING ASIDE WHAT ULTIMATELY

210
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:50,750
HAPPENED LATER --

211
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,052
>> Tucker: I WOULD SAY WE

212
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,186
FILED THIS GROUND BEFORE.

213
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,288
WHAT I'M ASKING WAS A POLITICAL

214
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:55,655
QUESTION.

215
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,690
CLEARLY THIS IS NOT BEARING

216
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,694
FRUIT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

217
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,028
THEIR LEAD IS WITHIN A MARGIN OF

218
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,329
ERROR.

219
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:02,929
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

220
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,265
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RETAKE

221
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,466
CONGRESS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE

222
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:06,900
RUSSIA STORY.

223
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,034
AND NOW THEY'RE TELLING US WE

224
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,070
NEVER WANTED TO ABOUT RUSSIA IN

225
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,971
THE FIRST PLACE AND ALL I'M

226
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,105
SAYING IS THAT'S A LIE.

227
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,640
DON'T LIE TO ME WHEN I'VE BEEN

228
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,407
WATCHING TV FOR THE PAST YEAR

229
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,876
AND ALL YOU TALKED ABOUT HIS

230
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,210
RUSSIA.

231
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,111
DID RACHEL MADDOW MAKE YOU DO

232
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,478
THAT?

233
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,512
DON'T LIE TO ME.

234
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,414
>> THE FACT IS I THINK THERE'S

235
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:21,815
TWO TRACKS.

236
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,984
I THINK THE FACT IS THE

237
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,884
DEMOCRATIC PARTY KNOWS IT'S NOT

238
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,685
GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION.

239
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,054
THEY WILL NOT WIN THE 2018

240
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,755
ELECTIONS JUST TALK ABOUT

241
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,889
MUELLER OR TRUMP EVEN.

242
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,058
THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN AFFIRMATIVE

243
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,759
AGENDA ABOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE

244
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,227
AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.

245
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,097
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

246
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,699
DONALD TRUMP -- WE USED TO SAY

247
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,734
YOU HAD HISTORICALLY LOW

248
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,268
APPROVAL RATINGS.

249
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:43,503
I CHECKED TODAY, JIMMY CARTER

250
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,838
ACTUALLY EDGED THEM OUT SO HE'S

251
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,406
NOW SECOND MOST UNPOPULAR

252
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,610
PRESIDENT THIS FAR INTO IT.

253
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,612
>> Tucker: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

254
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,648
RIGHT.

255
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,617
>> EVERY ELECTION -- WE JUST HAD

256
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,452
THAT SPECIAL ELECTION IN

257
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,053
ARIZONA.

258
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,621
TRUMP WON BY 21, THE REPUBLICAN

259
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,890
WON BY FIVE.

260
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,091
EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN WON THE

261
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,159
HOUSE LAST YEAR BY 16 POINTS OR

262
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,494
UNDER HAS TO BE LOOKING OVER

263
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,228
THEIR SHOULDER SCARED TO DEATH

264
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:12,665
BECAUSE THIS MOMENTUM.

265
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,867
>> Tucker: DEMOCRATS HAVE A

266
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,667
LOT OF ENERGY.

267
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,269
IT'S A MIDTERM IN THE

268
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,070
PRESIDENT'S FIRST TERM.

269
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,905
OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO GAIN

270
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,205
SEATS.

271
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,774
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN I THINK TO

272
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,508
ELECTIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY

273
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,876
WHEN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

274
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,477
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT

275
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,211
DEMOCRATS DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY

276
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,615
ARE A LOCK TO WIN THAT THE

277
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,517
AMERICAN HOUSE.

278
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,686
HALF THE COUNTRY IS LIKE HIM.

279
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,654
DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE WAY FAR

280
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,655
AHEAD OF WHERE THEY ARE TODAY.

281
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,990
THE REASON THEY ARE NOT FARTHER

282
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,824
AHEAD IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

283
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,093
RUNNING ON EVERYTHING.

284
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,261
THEY ARE RUNNING ON THINGS LIKE

285
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,463
MORE ABORTION AND MORE ILLEGAL

286
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,664
ALIENS.

287
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,266
THAT'S INSANE AND IT SCARES

288
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,500
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW THAT.

289
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,701
>> WE WILL SEE WHEN THE 2018

290
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,070
MIDTERMS ROLLED AROUND.

291
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,938
ALL WE KNOW IS FROM EVERY OTHER

292
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,442
SINGLE SPECIAL ELECTION THE

293
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,443
DEMOCRATIC WAVE SEEMS TO BE ON

294
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,677
THE ORDER OF TEN, 15%.

295
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,679
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT AT

296
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,181
THIS POINT, THAT WILL TAKE OUT A

297
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,450
LOT OF INCUMBENT REPUBLICANS.

298
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:03,950
WILL IT CONTINUE?

299
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,453
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

300
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,555
>> Tucker: JUST FOR THE SAKE

301
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,657
OF HONESTY, WILL YOU CONCEDE THE

302
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,292
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SPEND THE LAST

303
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,461
YEAR TELLING US THAT RUSSIA

304
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,295
HACKED OUR ELECTIONS, WHATEVER

305
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,763
THAT MEANS, IT WAS A LIE.

306
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,798
BUT THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE

307
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,200
RACHEL MADDOW MADE THEM FOR

308
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,601
MORNING JOE SENT THEM A MEMO AND

309
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,869
THEY HAD TO OBEY.

310
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:23,670
IT'S BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT

311
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,038
WOULD WORK AND IT DIDN'T.

312
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,974
>> THEY WERE HORRIFIED -- THAT

313
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,410
THE REPUBLICANS DID THIS AND

314
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,847
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

315
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,280
INDIFFERENT OR WORSE WAS

316
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,648
COMPLICIT.

317
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,883
THAT'S THE THING THAT DEMOCRATS

318
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,784
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

319
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,585
>> Tucker: THEY DON'T CARE

320
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,219
ABOUT THE COUNTRY.

321
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,285
IF THEY CARED ABOUT THE COUNTRY

322
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,288
THEY WOULD SECURE THE BORDERS

323
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,690
AND FIGHT BACK AGAINST CHINA.

324
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,724
THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

325
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,626
CONTROLLING OUR POLICY.

326
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,827
NO PUSHBACK FROM THE DEMOCRATS

327
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,863
AT ALL BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE.

328
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,164
>> WE HAD A NET OUTFLOW FROM

329
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,398
U.S. TO MEXICO.

330
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,167
THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF

331
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,102
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WE HAD

332
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:56,569
A NET OUTFLOW.

333
00:08:56,569 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT'S HOW MUCH THEY CARE ABOUT
