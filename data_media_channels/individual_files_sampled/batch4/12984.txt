you may have noticed your lefty friends have suddenly gone mum on Donald Trump's alleged nefarious collusion with Russia that's because after 11 months of incessant accusations that Trump is a Putin puppet it turns out that the Democrats colluded with Russia you cannot make this up we will analyze the most egregious political hypocrisy since all of the other parts of Hillary Clinton's campaign then Alicia crass and Jacob berry joined the panel of deplorable z' to discuss Kid Rock's abdicating his civic duty Frederika Wilson's 16th minute of Fame and why men would rather play video games than work I can't imagine I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knoll Joe this is my favorite news cycle in a very long time but first we can't get to it because we've hit the big time we have finally hit the big time Marshall we have a new sponsor we have someone that is going to keep you employed keep me in Co FFA and the lights running and this is a good one this is movement watches MV MT but we pronounce it movement cuz look we don't have time for all those vowels we got to move we have places to be people to see movement watches it was founded on the belief that style shouldn't break the bank now I've ordered my movement watch one of the great things about doing this show obviously Ben hasn't paid me in in years but I do get some freebies when we get to try out the products I have been waiting I've been salivating for movement to advertise with us I just ordered the watch from them and I'm actually kind of kicking myself because they have this new line that just came out today I think or yesterday called revolver and these watches are some of the nicest ones they put out yet but I love watches I have a nice watch collection but I hate I despise overpaying for watches you go into a department store you pay $300 $400 more than that $500 for you know the watches are nice but I don't want to spend $500 on movement watches begin at $95 just $95 for a beautiful watch it's sleek its modern but it's got a pretty cool vintage feel on a lot of their models especially the one that I got I got the titanium white chrono and it's true becoming in a few days I'll start wearing it then it's really cool the guys who started it they they figured it out in college they wanted nice watches they didn't want to pay a lot for it so what would you do well you'd start your own watch company right that's what they did you know they start at $95 they figured out that by selling them online you don't need to mark it up like crazy and pay all of these advertising fees and everything like that so they've sold over 1 million watches so far this is by far the fastest growing watch company in the world they've sold a million watches to 160 countries it's you know it's really nice it's the the name of the game here is kind of minimalism it's not one of those really gaudy watches that like brushes your teeth for you it's really sleek you can you can wear it up you can dress it up you can wear it as your everyday watch I'm I'm gonna try to twist the arm of our of the people who do our ads and try to get a few so I can play around with them that the other nice thing is that today you get 15% off if you use the promo code and Marshall what do you think that promo code is I'd say it would be cuff fa so what you have to do right now you get free shipping you get free returns you have to go to MVM t.com slash cough fa that is co v fe fe any company that is willing to give you a discount for the word cuff fa go over there right now give them some love man that is a great thing MVM t.com slash cuff fa now is the time to step up your watch game if you're a serious person you got it you know you got places to be people to see so you got to wear watch MVM t.com slash cough fa join the movement okay they're obviously they're a great company and you got to support them so do you remember listen I'm a little older than you dear dear listener and viewer so do you remember how Democrats have spent the last 11 months breathlessly accusing Donald Trump and Republicans of quote colluding with Russia you don't remember I know people those political memories are very short let me jog your memory this week we saw cold hard evidence of the Trump campaign indeed the Trump family eagerly intending to collude possibly with Russia well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president and okok today nope it's pretty clear it's pretty clear you won't admit the Russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the United States of America that you encouraged espionage against our people that you are willing to spout the Putin line sign up for his wish list rake up NATO do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race Clinton told USA Today Susan page she is quote convinced Trump associates colluded with Russia to help her opponent win she's convinced Hillary says it folks she got it when his Hillary Clinton never lied let me ask you that they have been harping on this for 11 months now and then it just went away and then just overnight it just went away and you don't see it reported anymore for some reason it dropped out of the news my fiancee I was writing the show a few mornings ago my fiancee sweet little Alisa came at all bleary-eyed you said Mike what happened to Russia what what I don't know what happened to Russia I assumed they stopped talking about it because it ran out of steam you know that they kept trying to imply the Trump who is a guy that we've known for four decades he's been in the public eye forever that he was some kind of Manchurian Candidate even top Democrats like Van Jones admitted that this was nonsense cyber war is real war so you have an active attack on our country and you have the president-elect cannot find it in himself to say this is wrong and it needs to stop amen things a big nothing boat really you don't think that the Russia things a big nothing burger there's nothing you can do so I thought I assume that was wide that this ran out of steam they just realized it wasn't gonna go anywhere they used it as a cudgel as long as they could but that's it eventually you can't you can't beat a dead horse no no that's not what it seems like now apparently now the reason they've shut their mouths about it is because the Democrats may have colluded with Russia we've learned that just this you couldn't write this you couldn't script a better end to this nonsense that they've been spouting for 11 months now they do this a lot the Democrats do this a lot they project on to Republicans the things that are true of themselves so they harp on forever and ever to say the fox news is fake news you know it's fake news and you you don't get reliable news like us meanwhile CNN is running fraudulent stories a story within the last three months so bad they had to fire an entire news team for it New York Times their major story on Trump Russia collusion they had to retract it they had to retract the whole story Jim Comey said that it was fake news under oath when he was testifying before Congress the other one that they use a lot is that Republicans are hateful and extreme so I'll say you know you guys you just hate every your haters your bigoted your racist sexist this that and the other thing meanwhile it's almost exclusively Democrats or torching cities torching campuses censoring speech they have to spend six hundred thousand dollars to protect ben shapiro when he comes to berkeley because he's going to talk about how you shouldn't sense her speech but no it's the republicans who are the hateful ones they say republicans deny science meanwhile it's the Democrats who are the ones that who insist that a man can physically become a woman as long as he wishes it very much or he imagines it or he identifies as that in some metaphysical way right denying science fake news hateful and bigoted they throw it on us but obviously it seems to apply more accurately to them now by collusion I am NOT just talking about the time that Barack Obama publicly on video and on microphone promised the President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev that he would lie to the American people to benefit Russian interests but to jog your memory here it is that's unbelievable this is my last election I'll have more flexibility after my election I will transmit this information to Vladimir so we caught him on a video doing that but that's not just what I'm talking about we NBC News is now reporting special councilor Muller who is investigating the Trump Russia connections he is investigating also Democrat lobbyist Tony Podesta Podesta why does that name sound familiar ah yes because he's the brother of the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign so apparently Podesta and the Podesta group may have violated the foreign agents Registration Act which is a felony by the way he failed to disclose lucrative lobbying for Russian interests in the Ukraine that isn't all we know we also know that the FBI had evidence for two years that Russian agents including a major sleeper cell was trying to infiltrate the Clinton circle we know that a Putin lacked Putin linked bank paid Bill Clinton $500,000 half a million dollars just a few weeks after hillary helped American executives travel to Moscow to support putin's interests to build his own version of Silicon Valley to build up his own Russian tech industry we also know that the Obama administration knew about Russian bribery before cutting a deal to give Russia a major chunk of the u.s. uranium supply the FBI knew as early as 2009 that the Kremlin had compromised an American uranium trucking company Russia received two million dollars in kickbacks in violation of the foreign corruptions Practices Act they Russian nuclear officials transported millions of dollars into the United States with the express purpose of benefiting the Clinton Foundation the Clinton Global Initiative to try to buy their way into the Clinton circle in the State Department we know that that Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder who is the most corrupt Attorney General until his next Attorney General Loretta Lynch we know that he did not bring charges about this until the nuclear deals were cut and we know that the first deal uranium 1b of Russia control over 20% of America's uranium supply that is a little bit more than Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton were throwing at Donald Trump they said well there was too many pep Amiens on Twitter obviously they colluded with Russia looks like there's a little bit more undemocratic Ella's proceed with caution those in glass houses should not throw uranium at Republicans let's bring on our panel to discuss this we have the Daily wires own Alicia Kraus and the man you might know from wandering around the sidewalk muttering to himself Jacob Airy panel thank you for being here Thank You Alicia the question on everyone's mind who most colluded with Russia who is the most nefarious Putin stooge Manchurian politician is it the Democrats or the Republicans I don't know that I can answer that off the top of my head but can I just shout feminists because Emily zanotti had a really great piece over at the Daily wire earlier today in which she said that feminists actually accidentally touted Russia's propaganda when they planned their whole women's March thing and I liked spent so much time pointing and laughing at that this morning it just brought me so much Glee and and as the mother on the show today I would just like to say that no one should ever be throwing uranium do not throw uranium keep it down kids and you gave you gave the only answer that I that is better than Democrats and that's feminists blame the feminists I do for everything Jacob why did it take so long for the media to cover the Russia corruption on the Left I noticed there's been breathless coverage on the right how come it's taken this long we've known about this for years now we've known about this for eight years I think it's partially due to social media and people are going what about ISM like they're saying you know when there's oil Trump's son met with a Russian lawyer or whatever and they're like what about Hillary's Dyl to bring in a oil a Russian oil company to the United States and now they can't ignore it because before you just had to take the journalists words for it right you had to go to the CNN and go to the New York Times and even Fox News but now with social media people are actually calling out the mainstream media for all these mistakes so now they can't hide it anymore now when they're actually perpetuating these these fake news stories people are noticing and they're and they're and they're holding them accountable do you think it's sinking in with Demi gratz I mean obviously Van Jones is admitting it's a nothing burger but with the rank-and-file democrats do you think it's sinking in that this Trump Russia collusion thing is ridiculous that it's not going to get them anywhere politically I think they thought it was ridiculous to begin with again it's one of those look don't look at yourself in the mirror type type of situations you know don't you know the pot calling the kettle black in this case I think that they knew it from the beginning and but now the American people are going listen we want to talk about jobs Trump one let's talk about the economy let's talk about our foreign policy which was disastrous for the last eight years so I think they've just decided we just need to move on because the American people aren't taking our bull crap anymore you watch your language mister this is my mom would call that imitation cussing Jake we do even even our even our expletives are wholesome once that's what we tried to do on a family show okay well we need to get to one of the craziest Democrats in the entire planet Frederika Wilson and her 16th minute of fame we have to talk about why men would rather play video games than do their jobs shocking we have a lot of other things to cover but unfortunately you can't see it if you are not subscribed to the daily wire you can't see the rest of the show we have a lot more coming up if you subscribe right now you'll pay $10 a month or $100 for an annual membership you'll get me you get the Andrew Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show I know we've heard in a million times what about this fellas what about this in light of the new the new information that's come to the surface that Democrats have colluded with Russia this leftist here's tumblr you're gonna need about a hundred of these you're gonna have to put them all over your house it's going to be a no alike torrent of salty salty floods and you can serve those tears hot or cold they'll always be salty and delicious we can get the Frederika wilson vintage we can get the hilary vintage it's gonna become you're not gonna know what to do with them you'll get creative and make your own blends so go over there right now daily wire.com get all the shows get the ad free website and get your leftist here's tumblr we'll be speaking of crazy democrat conspiracy theories let's get into Frederico Wilson a woman who actually does wear a tinfoil cowboy hat she is and of course it's a Florida woman right Florida woman is seeking her 16th minute of fame politicizing a heroic fallen soldier she is now calling the incident in which the soldier in question was killed Trump's Benghazi here she is this is going to be this administration's Benghazi this is going to be Trump's Benghazi Trump's lajiye I really like this attack that they're trying now I think the attack is gonna fall flat but what she probably doesn't realize is that by calling this Niger attack Trump's Benghazi she's acknowledging that Benghazi has Benghazi right she's acknowledging that Benghazi is a Hillary's Benghazi which they denied for years and now it's convenient so they'll have to admit reality Washington Post is already jumping on this bandwagon they're saying there was a fight for an hour or two hours and Donald Trump didn't do anything I mean the Washington Post has lost any credibility if it ever possessed any but it is really pathetic it's so transparent and thankfully their friends at Google News through this story to the top of the heap today global stories worldwide they threw this one right up there Jacob has this sunk in with Democrats yet or are they ready to admit obviously there's a premise there's an implication that if this is Trump's Benghazi than Benghazi was Hillary's Benghazi would they be willing to admit that now now that Hillary is no longer a candidate she's not gonna run again until 2020 and 2024 and 20:28 and 2032 so will they admit that that was a huge failure both in the event and the cover-up honestly think no I think Congress congresswoman I think she slipped I think it was a Freudian slip she messed up I'm sure she probably meant probably meant to say Iraq or Afghanistan and but just Benghazi popped into her head I really honestly think that it was either that or she's a Bernie sister and she wants someone like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders to challenge Trump in 2020 but I honestly I I doubt that I honestly think she's just so kooky she forgot oh my gosh Benghazi happened during the the Obama administration she just she just didn't put two and two together it was disgraceful they asked her about the controversy and how she's politicized gold star families and her response was I'm a rock star now yeah that was a rich quote that was ridiculous and to be honest she's not a supporter of veterans she's blocked or attempted to block reforms of the veteran Veteran Affairs Department she's voted against funding to go to other veteran veteran legislation I'm telling you she is just playing this up and like she said she's a rock star she's a rock storm Alicia is Niger Trump's Benghazi is there any small ounce of truth to that accusation I'm a big fan of general Dempsey and general Dempsey had a pretty in-depth press conference yesterday in which for some Fox News reporters and of course all members of the press were there and asked him very direct questions about why were we there why did sergeant Johnson go missing how did the the DoD handle it what was the White House's response when the White House find out and he had answers for all of these questions questions that if you'd asked the Obama administration the same thing after Benghazi they did not have the answers to and they sent secretary rice out there on her Sunday show right around up you know lying and spreading lies about it another thing that they lied about that we've talked about in the news today is sergeant Bowe Bergdahl you know we had rice tell us that he served with honor and distinction and now he could go to prison for life because he admitted to desertion desertion that put his fellow troops at risk so I got six of them killed six six soldiers were killed looking for the guy yeah and so there there's definitely I agree with Jacob I think congresswoman Wilson maybe had a Freudian slip and didn't mean to say that because not only would this reopen the Benghazi discussion in the mainstream media if they were actually doing their jobs regarding Hillary Clinton's involvement but President Barack Obama involvement as well yes and just for those of you who are unaware a Freudian slip is where you say one thing but you mean your mother general Dempsey did not blame the attack on a YouTube video I noticed as you pointed out is there forget Trump for a minute and Hillary is there any way to compare what happened in Benghazi to our consulate first American ambassador killed in decades and this operation that happened in Niger is there any moral equivalence at all okay are you asking me or I'm always asking you lunatic ravings I'll talk to Jane no I think no there is ZERO comparison especially because you saw that ambassador Stevens had sent hundreds of requests for security as you mentioned he was a diplomat there it was a compound there that should have been protected that the depart the State Department totally failed on this was a DoD mission this was a military mission they were there and it seems as if there is an awful mishap in which sergeant Johnson came upon the enemy in an area that they didn't expect to happen and that's why he went missing and they didn't find his body until two days later and I am a big fan of veterans I come from a military family one of my dearest friends it's a Goldstar Widow Jane Horton and I think that Trump's response to this has not been appropriate but congresswoman Wilson should be ashamed of herself I understand that she has a personal relationship with this family but you do not use this as a political you know go ahead and that's exactly what she's done and it's really unfortunate absolutely right and you know I do see the one mistake you made there in your analysis at Benghazi you clearly missed all of the humor that ambassador Stevens was putting into his emails some people forget that when asked why Hillary Clinton didn't give him the security that he asked for she said all that old Chris Stevens he's such a jokester I was one of the best things about Chris you guys don't understand it but when he was begging for additional security because they were worried about Ronnie it was just a joke joke it was yes so I mean we try to try to read the humor a little bit next time Alicia it's like you can't you don't even understand these Clinton emails okay we've got to move on I can't if we talk about Hillary Clinton anymore rip my hair out we need to talk about someone else who has abdicated public service Kid Rock I'm sorry to say Kid Rock he's not running for Senate we're all looking forward to it this was the maggot revolution this is the next phase of it I would actually argue I gotta say I don't think it was a matter revolution I know you love you some Donald Trump Michaels I like Kid Rock has done more for the Republican Party and presidential nominee Opie presidential nominees than donald trump ever did until he ran in 20-something ferment freakin romney i mean it's hilarious and then I let my favorite kid rock quote of all time is when he was asked what he thought thought about Mitt Romney he said that's a like he said that's like a decent F word dude I am really disappointed because I wanted the battles of the late 90s early 2000s like music artists to happen in 2020 or whether it was in the Senate race like Eminem versus Kid Rock I was really waiting for it to happen and recently while listening to Kid Rock when he shouted my name is kid my four-year-old said why is his name kid and I was like no cuz he isn't a kid but he might be senator of Michigan one day senator kid I know it is really sad and by the way when I think of rock and roll I do think of Mitt Romney you could you could have had Snoop dignity doo-wop having some new songs and the election cycle all of that is gone I did call this right when it came out everyone is there was a little website that went up Kid Rock for Senate everyone was freaking out the way you knew it wasn't real is that it was paid for by a company it was just paid for by a regular old I forget what it was a record label or his personal company hey it wouldn't have worked with the FEC so I unfortunately had a gut feeling all the way going in that Kid Rock was not going to serve our country as we all hoped you would Jacob is this a positive sign for the culture or is it devastatingly sad both I think that it is both sad and that it is a positive sign for a vulture how bright a brave position you're staking out here yeah I got it you got to have it both ways but I I don't think it was I don't think it was realistic to begin with I think that he just did it he sold a lot of t-shirts a lot of merch so he's happy I think he probably could have gotten away with it if he had ran in Florida or Minnesota but Michigan they tend to take their politics just a little bit more seriously some people think that's what Donald Trump was doing but he was just out there selling hats and then by the end of the joke he became the president really done it I mean Brock has a statement out that like base just breaks down in layman's terms the importance of smaller government and why big government sucks and I'm like oh my god I love this I mean I would have relocated to Michigan where my in-laws are vote for him seriously well at least we don't need to move the Daily wire studios now that's one good thing okay in nothing sums up 2017 more than this next story there's a new study out that shows that men are grown men are playing more video games now they're underemployed as a result of it and that they would they're actually happier so they'd rather play video games than go to work and it's made them happier which is somewhat surprising according to research from economists from Princeton the University of Rochester and UChicago a non college educated men are spending as much as 40 hours a week playing video games and evidence shows that the reason they're doing this is because young men like instant gratification you don't say one of the professor's happiness has gone up for this group despite employment percentages having fallen this is like a fox Butterfield by the way they would say crime drops despite prisons filling where they think it's a paradox but really it makes perfect sense yes happiness has gone up as these men aren't working anymore living with their parents is going up and that's different than for any other group Alicia is there a cultural analog here to anything or is this something new is this something we should be worried about all these young rapscallions playing their video games and listening to rock and roll well it's been a problem that we've had with Millennials in general not just millennial men this study showed that 88% of those men are still going out and getting jobs but now the number is up to 22% that just really don't about getting jobs something that I could tell them would potentially give them instant gratification is if you get a job you get a woman and then that's something else that gratifies you so maybe you guys should go out and do that because it doesn't just help you as an individual studies also show preview videos have shown that that men who are married and have a family tend to end up making more money men like to make money they like to feel like they are protecting and providing sorry guys this is a basic instincts that God gave you so when you do those things it's going to make you happier in the long run especially if you that can invest in your future in the offspring and in the it's also going to positively affect the economy I think millenials all around have really screwed the American economy because they're delaying getting married having a family which leads to creating jobs when you buy a house build a business etc etc that is true making money is a lot more fun than not making money I've spent long swaths of time not making any money degree and well that's because marshals never gotten the privilege of experiencing the other one but I did because I published blank pages and it's the best man it is it's really a shame that you know that says more about the culture well one cultural analog here I do think is Alicia you mentioned that sometimes it's nice for young men to have young women to accompany them doing different variants your marriage Michael is right it's a whole absolutely only after marriage and you got to be praying the whole time but but there is this trend that we've been observing especially in Japan that's where a lot of studies have come out but all over which is that men are choosing porn over real-life women there you know once the sex robots come the whole species is going to die out Jacob is this is this the direction the cultures headed they were moving toward digital instant gratification rather than engaging with real people and actually producing something you know we're shooting people on Halo but we're not building businesses we're linking over at sex robots but we're not making our wife happy I honestly think that this is going this direction but I honestly think it'll be in the short term it'll burn out because it'll just it'll just everyone will just notice oh this is fake it may be instant most people want a a permanent sort of fulfillment for their soul so I honestly believe that yes we'll see this in the short-term and it's devastating and it's quite frankly annoying even me as an as a nerd I like making that money you know but I would love to see I would love to see this burn out and I honestly think it will it's just this'll this is a trend that'll pass once once these guys wake up and they realize oh my gosh my parents have died and I have no money that's a really sad way to end the show but you actually do bring up a good point which is we've seen this in other industries too right you know for 60 years after World War two the mainstream news media had this domination of American culture until 2017 when Donald Trump just drowned them all in Kofa face because people realize they don't want to fake things they want the real thing they don't want to just be bombarded with a bunch of fake news even something as powerful as the mainstream news media after a while people get sick of what is fake and they prefer the real thing excellent point Alicia and Jacob thank you for being here thank Alicia crabs from The Daily wire and Jacob berry from muttering around the sidewalks all right that's our show today I should point out is my
