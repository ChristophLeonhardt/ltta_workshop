we are by nature Explorer
motivated by curiosity this is a deeply
human quality it is this terrific
curiosity that sent Explorer to prove
the earth is not flat
it is time to explore other solar
systems letting out may be the only
thing that saves us from ourselves I am
convinced that humans need to leave her
I had always dreamed of spaceflight
but I thought that with my limitations
that would remain a dream and I will
never get to experience the wonders of
bass except through my travel
imagination and my work in theoretical
physics
it's my commitment to science that has
kept me going
you
