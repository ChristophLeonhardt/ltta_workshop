new york's bill de blasio claimed that he was gonna fight tooth and nail to stop the unfair arrests of people who have simple marijuana possession well even though Ann Coulter believes that people don't get arrested for marijuana possession it turns out that even in places like New York if you do get caught with possession and happen to be a minority you are likely to get arrested let me give you the details this is based on data by the Legal Aid Society and it shows that just a 3.9 decrease in marijuana arrests have happened since the beginning of 2016 so there has been a slight decrease but keep in mind that they've handled five thousand nine hundred thirty-four marijuana cases involving misdemeanor charges and violations since the start of 2017 alone that's compared to six thousand one hundred eighty during the same period last year in 2016 now in New York there have been a total of nine thousand nine hundred sixty eight arrests for marijuana possession this year what no I don't get this here but I don't understand Hannah because this year in the debate you had with Ann Coulter she said there were none none in the country no one gets arrested ever on it okay anyway I think that it's least surprising that the overwhelming majority of these arrests happen in minority communities even though data and statistics indicate that white individuals use marijuana at similar rates as minorities do arrest climbed 30 percent during the six-month period between 2015 and 2016 with white people making up less than 10% of those arrests just to give you an idea of how minorities are disproportionately impacted by these ridiculous try Kony in laws okay look there's plenty of minorities in New York City so yes take that into account there's also a tremendous number of white people in Manhattan because no one else can afford the apartments there so de Blasio they all he's way too liberal and stuff no I know and to be fair to him it takes a long time to fix the culture and things like the NYPD okay having said that look here's one thing you could do as mayor and again the it caused a ruckus and people would lose their minds but it gives you a sense of how unfair the system is today if I'm mayor New York City I go oh you know what I'm gonna do random spot checks stop and frisk at Wall Street you think I'm not gonna catch a ton of cocaine marijuana let alone all the other drugs yeah all right lock them up let's go let's go let's go handcuffs then I'm gonna go to Park Avenue see what they're off to over there then I'm gonna go to midtown and see what they're up to and I'm gonna go all around the city now if you did that you wouldn't have 10% whites you'd have probably whatever the proportion of New York City's because we know for a fact that black people and white people smoked marijuana at about the same rate all across the country but they choose not to do that right and also look that de Blasio's spokespeople responded with look de Blasio said that marijuana arrest arrests would decrease and they have decreased a little over 3% and summonses have gone up 2% so people are getting summoned rather than getting arrested but here's the thing I don't care if you're black don't care if you're white don't care if you're Asian don't care if you're a freaking lizard person I don't want anyone to be arrested or have to deal with the summons because of simple marijuana possession I don't care I don't want any taxpayer money going towards something that's stupid it's just such a waste of resources by the way a summons is just as bad not just as bad I mean when you're talking about the legal ramifications it's not as bad but it's still a waste of resources and and look guys we're not unrealistic about this I I worked at the as a prosecutor when I during the summers when I was an intern at the Southern District in New York and we got briefings on where the drug transactions happened most and so this is 20 years ago it's no longer relevant I don't know if it's the same sponsor or not but it I know the spots that it happened and I know that they were minority areas so I know that there's not a huge drug trade going on in the middle of the Upper East Side for example but that doesn't mean people aren't smoking pot or using drugs on the Upper East Side and that doesn't mean that drugs aren't being sold on Wall Street but in more informal ways instead of a guy sitting in the corner so we're not being naive or we don't have rose-colored glasses on here and I know that some of the times when they arrest people for possession or convict them certainly on arresting is different but on conviction is because they took a plea and instead of drug dealing they got drug possession for their conviction I know all that nonetheless it is still overwhelmingly disproportionate because not not because not because hey you know what I want white people to be arrested more - I'm with Anna I don't want anybody arrested for marijuana possession I think it should be legal but if you're going around arresting all the minorities right and going and doing all this effort to make sure you do thousands of arrests in their neighborhoods and then you don't touch the other neighborhoods at all at all you don't do any stop and frisk you don't find out if they're selling drugs on Wall Street I got news for you they're selling drugs on Wall Street are you insane have like any book that has ever been written any article about Wall Street and about what happens internally cocaine cocaine cocaine cocaine cocaine but there's never any bus there's never any big sting operations because if you did that a lot of people that are powerful are gonna get pissed and even de Blasio is not doing it they think he's too progressive wait till they should have a real progressive mayor go actually do some whatever you're gonna do if you're gonna do anything do it proportionately and then watch them howl because you know what if you're arrested powerful people again put aside race for a second rich powerful people at the same rate that your arrest poor powerless people we'd get rid of the war on drugs immediately because the minute you start locking up judges and bankers and lawyers so what this is outrageous I was just getting high exactly watch The Young Turks commercial-free downloaded a stream it watch it anyway you like a TYT Network calm /join
