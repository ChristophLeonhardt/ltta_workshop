it was right here that Henry Cobo says soldiers abducted him and tied him up he was in 1983 Zimbabwe's government said it was fighting a rebellion here in the Matabele elin region Henry says even though he was nothing to do with it he was taken to a concentration camp and tortured for three weeks he saw prisoners died daily from their injuries their bodies burned in a pit don't you know been Diddley 35 years on it's still hard to tell the story he says he narrowly survived when soldiers tried to execute him in a forest and left him for dead the bullet went here when Robert Mugabe sent the army to Matabeleland in the 1980s investigators say at least 20,000 people were killed many in the region say the massacres were to suppress the support base of his political rival at the time survivors say there's been no justice and Mugabe was finally forced from power by the army nine months ago it led to elections that took place in July some people wondered if Zimbabwe is presidential election might bring change your position say it was rigged the Electoral Commission denies it the ruling Zanu PF party's presidential candidates incumbent presidents Emerson Managua was announced the winner he was once the right-hand man of former leader Robert Mugabe and at the time of the massacres he was State Security Minister the first major investigation into the killings was written by human rights lawyer David Colt Hart he says the involvement of Managua and some of his ministers means things won't change I think it's unlikely that they would ever want a complete truth-telling because the entire story of their involvement will unravel from their perspective and that would be very damaging politically to them so we don't expect justice under them mangog we did send a commission to Matabeleland to investigate shortly after taking office in November this is the reaction in God protestors blocked proceedings but the government says it will deliver justice the Commission is independent it doesn't doesn't work under the direction for anybody it will do what it fuses rights we expect nothing but for accountability and full and taking of what happened at the inception of forum state would Henry and the other survivors are still waiting he says he just wants an apology from the people who ordered the atrocities and compensation he doesn't know if he'll ever get it Malcolm Webb al-jazeera Harare Zimbabwe
