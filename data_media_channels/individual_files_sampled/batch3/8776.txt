THIS IS THE FIVE. AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH A MOB OF REPORTERS FOR AN IMPROMPTU INTERVIEW ON "FOX & FRIENDS." THE PRESIDENT THEN ON LOADING ON TOP FBI BRASS ON THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. AT THE TOP PEOPLE WERE HORRIBLE. WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO COME UP THEY WERE PLOTTING AGAINST MY ELECTION. THE IG REPORT WITH A HORROR SHOW. IF YOU LET THE FBI TAKE A REPORT OF THE REAL FBI, NOT THE SCUM ON TOP. I THINK THE REPORT YESTERDAY MAY BE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN ANYTHING, IT EXONERATES ME. Kimberly: THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK AIM AT AIM AT SPACE SPECIAL AGENT PETER STRZOK. President Trump: I AM AMAZED THAT PETER STRZOK IS STILL AT THE FBI AND SO IS EVERYONE ELSE THAT DUMB LIE EVERYONE ELSE THAT DUMB LIT EVERYONE ELSE THAT DUMB LIA EVERYONE ELSE THAT DUMB LIT BEFORE. AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT THE REPORT, I'M TALKING ABOUT LONG BEFORE THE REPORT. Kimberly: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAMMERING FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY. President Trump: IF THEY SEEM LIKE VERY CRIMINAL ACTS TO ME. WHAT HE DID WAS CRIMINAL, WHAT HE DID WAS A TERRIBLE THING TO THE PEOPLE. WHAT HE DID WAS SO BAD IN TERMS OF OUR CONSTITUTION AND THE WELL-BEING OF OUR COUNTRY WHAT HE DID WAS HORRIBLE. SHOULD HE BE LOCKED UP? WE WILL LET THEM MAKE THE DETERMINATION. Kimberly: STRONG WORDS COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING IN AN IMPROMPTU CONFERENCE THERE, SPEAKING WITH STEVE DOOCY. AND THE OTHER DEUCE HE WAS THERE AS WELL. IT WAS A DOOZY SANDWICH. DOUG DUCEY DEUCE. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING AND REVIEW FROM THE PRESIDENT, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT HE SAID ABOUT STRZOK, THAT GUY SHOULD NOT BE THERE. AND A STRZOK OF IT AND HIS COMPATRIOTS, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE RESISTANCE THE WAY THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORTERS. THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE ALL MIDDLE-CLASS, UNEDUCATED, LAZY POS'S, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT STANDS FOR. AND HE SAYS WE WILL STOP THEM TO LISA PAGE. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PRO TRUMP TEXT. THERE'S NOT ANY ANTI-HILLARY TEXTS, IT'S ALL AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SO WHEN THE IG REPORT COMES OUT AND SAID THERE'S NO POLITICAL BIAS, THERE IS EXTREME POLITICAL BIAS. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY COULD SAY THAT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE. IT WAS ANTI-TRUMP FROM THE JUMP, AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU LOOK AT JAMES COMEY, HE KNEW LORETTA LYNCH AND HER BOSS, BARACK OBAMA, DIDN'T WANT HILLARY CLINTON CHARGED. HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT FROM TAKING OFFICE. THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE FBI AGENTS WERE INTIMIDATED AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO TOUGH, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WHEN SHE GETS INTO THE OVAL, SHE WAS GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON THEM. THEY KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE PRESIDENT AND THAT'S WHY THE FIX WAS IN. THEN ONCE TRUMP OUT THE NOMINATION THEY TURNED THE SCREWS TO HIM AND TREATED HIM AND HIS PEOPLE VERY UNFAIRLY. THE WAY COMEY BEHAVED DURING THIS WHOLE TIME, HE USED PRIVATE EMAIL. HE EXONERATED HILLARY. HE CHANGED THE LANGUAGE OF THE LAW TO MAKE IT ABOUT INTENT, AND INTENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS REPORT JUSTIFIES TRUMP'S FIRING OF JAMES COMEY, AND PRETTY MUCH EXONERATES A PRESIDENT WITH REGARD TO WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING ABOUT THE HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION. IT WAS CROOKED AND REMAINS EVEN MORE CROOKED. Kimberly: BUT JESSE, WHAT JAMES COMEY IS CRITICIZED FOR IN THE AG REPORT, THE THINGS HE DID, GOING OUT IN JULY AND HAVING THAT PRESS CONFERENCE, GOING IN OCTOBER AND TALKING ABOUT REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION, THOSE THINGS ALL HELPED DONALD TRUMP. IT DIDN'T HURT HILLARY. HE COULD HAVE CHARGED HER AND TAKEN HER TOTALLY OUT OF PLAY. LET ME COUNTER BACK THOUGH. THERE ARE A LOT OF FBI OFFICERS, MOST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TENDS TO LEAN CONSERVATIVE. HAVE YOU HEARD THEM TALK? THEY DON'T SOUND LIKE CONSERVATIVES. LET ME FINISH. IF THIS DEEP STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT FBI GROUP WANTED TO TAKE DOWN DONALD TRUMP, WHY DIDN'T THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT HIS CAMPAIGN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION? THEY DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO WIN. IF THEIR GOAL WAS TO TAKE HIM DOWN, WHICH I DON'T THINK IT WAS THEN WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT? WHY DIDN'T THEY LEAK THEY DID LEAK TO THE TIMES IN OCTOBER. THEY WERE QUITE CERTAIN OF THAT AS A DETERMINATIVE OUTCOME WHICH WAS THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEN THEY SHIFTED TACTICS AND MOVED TOWARDS UNDERMINING THE CANDIDACY OF DONALD TRUMP AND ULTIMATELY THE PRESIDENT. SO THIS IS JUST PART OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE IG REPORT. YOU HAVE THOSE REVELATIONS BUT KEEP IN MIND, THOSE DOCUMENTS, THE VOLUMINOUS AMOUNT AND PAGES THAT WE SAW, THOSE ARE STILL REDACTED BY ROD ROSENSTEIN, WHO IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS NEFARIOUS CIRCLE OF MALFEASANCE. THERE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED HERE. YOU'RE GOING BACK AND FORTH ON WHO HAD HELPED AND WHO WOULD HURT, BUT ISN'T THE PROBLEM THAT THERE WAS POLITICS TO BEGIN WITH? THE SAD THING TO ME IS, YOU HAVE OVER 100,000 PEOPLE THAT WORK WITHIN DOJ AND MANY OF THEM ARE GREAT PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT POINTED THAT OUT AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE BECAUSE YOU FEEL FOR THEM IN THIS MOMENT. THEY ARE THE ONES DOING THEIR JOB THAT ARE POLITICAL. THERE WILL BE A HEARING ON MONDAY, AND TUESDAY I BELIEVE IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. THE BIG QUESTION, KIMBERLY, DOES ACTION NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT LUNGED NOT JUST PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE ABOUT OTHER AGENTS? THEY SAID TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OF THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WHERE DOES THIS END? DO THEY SAY, THAT'S PRETTY BAD, LET'S MOVE ON? OR DO THEY LEARN FROM IT? THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING, CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION AND FIND OUT IT WHAT IF ANY ACTION NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO JAMES COMEY. CAN WE FIRST ADDRESS WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING WHICH WAS IN GENERAL? THIS IS THE TRANSCRIPT I HAD TO COME UP IT'S 50 PAGES. THE MEDIA SHOULD STOP AND THANK DONALD TRUMP FOR BEING THE MOST TRANSPARENT PRESIDENT. HE TALKS FOR 51 MINUTES ABOUT EVERYTHING. FORGET THE IG, HE'S THE OG. HE WENT LIKE 300 DAYS ALMOST. THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN DONALD TRUMP'S WORLD AS, NO COMMENT. IF YOU LET HIM GO, AT SOME POINT HE WILL SAY YOUR NAME. WE SAW THAT WITH STUART VARNEY. IF HE KEEPS TALKING, HE WILL SAY, KITTENS ARE JUST LIKE UNICORNS, BUT SMALLER. SO THAT'S MY TAKE ON THE ACTUAL PRESSER, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS FANTASTICALLY ENTERTAINING AND WILL GIVE US THREE SEGMENTS TODAY ON FRIDAY. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG DEAL. HERE, THE TEXT BETWEEN PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE. 90% OF MY TEXTS ARE CARELESS AND HYPERBOLE. AT THE TIME I'M KIND OF BUZZ WHEN I TEXT PEOPLE. THEY ARE FRIGHTENING. WHEN YOU READ A FELLOW INVESTIGATOR SAYING COME UP THEY WILL STOP TRUMP, IF THAT'S NOT POLITICAL BIAS, WHAT CONSTITUTES POLITICAL BIAS? THERE'S ALMOST NO STEP BEYOND WHAT HE SAYING, SHORT OF ADVOCATING VIOLENCE FOR AN OVERTHROW, OR SOMETHING. I MEAN IT'S LIKE, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT IS BEYOND THAT? THAT'S THE LIMIT. SO I THINK I THINK YOU COULD INTERPRET IT AND SAY IT'S LIKE, TWO LEVERS TRYING TO IMPRESS EACH OTHER, TO HEROES IN THEIR OWN LOVE STORY, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT, MAN, IT ISN'T PRETTY. AND LET'S REMEMBER WHO HE WAS, HE WAS THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR FOR THE CLINTON EMAIL PROBE. HE INTERVIEWED ALL OF HILLARY'S PEOPLE AND HE TRAVELED TO ENGLAND TO TALK TO THE QUOTE UNQUOTE SPY. HE WAS THE ONE THAT OFFICIALLY OPENED UP THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION INTO DONALD TRUMP AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT INTERVIEWED MIKE FLYNN. HE WAS HANDPICKED TO GO ON TO MUELLER'S TEAM. THE KEY PLAYER IN BOTH INVESTIGATIONS AND HE'S OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT, WE NEED TO STOP HIM FROM BECOMING PRESIDENT AND IT NOW THAT HE IS PRESIDENT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND THAT'S WHY TREY GOWDY SAID THIS MOLAR PROBE IS TAINTED. NO MATTER WHAT COMES OUT OF IT, SHOULD WE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY? BECAUSE AS HE SAID, PETER STRZOK WAS ONE OF THE TOP PEOPLE ORIGINALLY ON THAT INVESTIGATION AND YOU HEARD RUDY GIULIANI THIS MORNING, HE SAID WE ARE NOT GOING TO COOPERATE ANYMORE. WHO KNOWS HOW THIS ENDS, IT MAY END UP GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT BUT YOU CAN'T ARGUE THAT THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS INVESTIGATION CERTAINLY WERE TAINTED. I THINK THE TEXT MESSAGES ARE AWFUL AND THEY GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF BIAS. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ALSO SAID THEY DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT IMPACTED THE INVESTIGATION. THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION. THEY ALSO SAID THAT PETER STRZOK AT TIMES ADVOCATED FOR TOUGHER ACTION AGAINST THE CLINTON PEOPLE INCLUDING THE USE OF SUBPOENAS THAN OTHER PEOPLE ON THE TEAM AND THAT HE WAS NOT THE SOLE DECISION-MAKER ON ANYTHING RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATION. SO I AGREE, THESE TEXTS GIVE A VERY BAD APPEARANCE OF POLITICAL BIAS AND IT WAS STUPID AND THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO FOLLOW WHAT THE IG SAID. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE IG WHERE THEY SAY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IMPACTED INVESTIGATIVE DECISIONS AND IN FACT, STRZOK ARGUED FOR TOUGHER TREATMENT. WHEN HE WROTE THE EXONERATION LETTER, RECKLESS OR NOT, HE WAS THE ONE THAT DOWNGRADED AND CARELESS. THE OTHER THING HE DID WHEN THEY GOT THEIR HANDS ON THE ANTHONY WEINER EMAILS, HE WAS THE ONE THAT SAT ON THEM FOR A MONTH AND THEY DIDN'T FUNNEL THEIR WAY UP TO MUELLER UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. BUT THAT HURT HELLO RAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT HELPS OR HURTS, THOUGH. IF YOU ARE CHOOSING POLITICAL BIAS IN FAVOR OF HILLARY IT'S IN WRITING, WE DON'T NEED TO SPECULATE. IT'S THERE FROM BEGINNING TO END THAT THEY HAD A SPECIFIC INTENDED PURPOSE OF WHAT THEY WANTED THE OUTCOME TO BE WHICH DOES TAINT THE INVESTIGATION MUELLER IS DOING BECAUSE THE KEY
