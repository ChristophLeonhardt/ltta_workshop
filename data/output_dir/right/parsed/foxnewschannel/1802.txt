WHAT KILLED THE MAN.
YIKES.

TWO FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS
SUGGESTING THAT EUROPE RETALIATE
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT FOLLOWING
HIS WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN
DEAL.
IN A "THE NEW YORK TIMES" OP ED
THEY WRITE THE EUROPEAN UNION
COULD ANNOUNCE THE WITHDRAWAL OF
AMBASSADORS FROM THE U.S.
ISN'T THAT THIS WHAT THEY DO
WHEN THEY BREECH AGREEMENTS,
EXPOSE THEM TO SECURITY RISKS
AND BREAK HAVOC.
MIGHT FOLLOW UP WITH EXPULSION
OF AMERICAN AMBASSADORS.
THIS FOLLOWING HILLARY CLINTON'S
ATTACKS AND JOAN KERRY'S MEETING
WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS BEHIND
THE SCENE TO TRY TO SAVE OBAMA'S
DEAL.
COULD THEIR MOVES BE CONSIDERED
TREESEN?
HERE TO DEBATE, FORMER OBAMA
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE JOE
RUBEN AND ADVISER TO GEORGE W.
BUSH AND BILL CLINTON.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
JOEL, LET ME START WITH YOU.
IS THIS AN APPROPRIATE FORM OF
DIPLOMATIC PROTEST OR ARE THESE
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS COACHING
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS TO RETALIATE
AGAINST THE U.S.?
>> WELL, GOOD MORNING, PETE.
AND CLEARLY THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR DEBATE AND WE
SHOULD HAVE A DEBATE.
AMERICANS, WE STILL LIVE IN A
FREE SOCIETY.
WE'RE ABLE TO EBBING PRESS OUR
OPINIONS AND WE SHOULD.
THIS OPINION HAS VALIDITY.
WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
DID WITH THE IRAN DEAL IS
ESSENTIALLY TO DECLARE ECONOMY
WARFARE ON EUROPE AND SAY THAT
IT WAS GOING TO VIOLATE THE
DEAL.
THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT
EUROPE NOW IS IN A BOX.
>> WE DECLARED ECONOMIC WARFARE
ON EUROPE.
>> YES.
>> OR WE DECIDED THAT -- THIS
WAS NOT RATIFIED BY THE U.S.
SENATE.
THIS IS AN EXECUTIVE AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATIO.
>> I'M HAPPY TO GO TO THE U.S.
SENATE.
>> IT WON'T SO IT WOULD NEVER
RATIFIED.
YOU WOULD SAY THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION ISN'T TRYING TO
COMMIT ECONOMIC WARE
COMMIT ECONOMIC WARFARE, IT HAS
A DIFFERENT VIEW OF IRAN.
>> THAT WAS THE LANGUAGE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DEAL, THAT
WE WERE GOING TO IMPOSE
SANCTIONS ON EUROPE TO HELP IRAN
DO BETTER JOB ON THE DEAL.
WHY SHOULD WE PENALIZE OUR ALLY
TO GO AFTER IRAN.
WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER IRAN IF
ANYTHING AND THAT WASN'T CLEAR
IN THE WAY THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION DECLARED
OPPOSITION TO THE DEAL.
>> IT FEELS THAT THESE FORMER
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
ARE ROOTING AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ONE THING, NO ONE SAYING
THEY SHOULD HAVEN'T THEIR
OPINION BUT SAYING THEY SHOULD
HAVE OUR AMBASSADORS EXPELLED,
THAT'S CUSTOMARILY SOMETHING YOU
DO BEFORE YOU GO TO WAR.
WE'RE NOT APPLYING SANCTIONS ON
EUROPE.
WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS ON
IRAN.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN AFOUL
OF THESE, DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH
IRAN.
THAT IS THE POINT.
TO RETURN TO THE TOUGH SANCTIONS
THAT EXISTED BEFORE THIS LAW
DISI DEAL WAS ENACTED, JUST
GOING BACK TO THAT.
AND AS FAR AS THE OP-ED WITHIN,
THANKFULLY I THINK EUROPE WILL
IGNORE IT.
YOU MENTIONED HILLARY AND JOHN
KERRY, I WOULD MENTION CHUCK
SCHUMER REFUSING TO CONFIRM
OFFICIALS.
IT'S PART OF THE RESISTANCE TO
THE 2016 ELECTION OUTCOME AND
ROOTING FOR THE UNITED STATES TO
FAIL FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES GOING
INTO THE MIDTERMS.
>> JOEL, DOESN'T THIS INFLECT AN
INFLATED SENSE OF EUROPE'S
INFLUENCE?
WITHOUT OBAMA AND THE U.S., IRAN
DEAL DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE TAKE THE
LEAD ON THIS, WE WANT TO STOP
THEM FROM GETTING A BOMB.
THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS A
DIFFERENT VIEW.
ARE THEY NOT ALLOWED A DIFFERENT
VIEW OR DO YOU HAVE TO IMPUGN
THEIR MOTIVES ?
-L.
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN
HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW.
AND IT HAS, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
FOR YEARS.
BUT THIS IS A DEAL WE HAVE WITH
EUROPE AND THE IRANIANS AND
RUSSIA AND CHINA.
RIGHT NOW BREAKING THE DEAL,
WE'RE PLAYING INTO THE HANDS OF
IRANIAN HARD LINERS.
RUSSIA IS HAPPY.
THE U.S. IS FIGHTING WITH
EUROPE.
AND THE U.S. SAID WE WOULD APPLY
SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON COMPANIES
DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN.
WE AS AMERICANS DON'T DO
BUSINESS WITH IRAN RIGHT NOW.
THEY'RE GOING TO CANCEL THE
BOEING DEAL.
ROLLING IT BACK AS IF WE CAN
SOMEHOW GET THE SANCTIONS BACK
FROM FOUR YEARS AGO, THAT
HILLARY CLINTON APPLIED AND PUT
INTO EFFECT.
THAT'S REALLY FANTASY.
WE NEED A DEAL THAT'S GOING TO
WORK TOWARDS WHAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID, BREAKING THIS
CURRENCY, IT WON'T GET US THERE.
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT
BREAKING THIS CURRENT DEAL WON'T
GET US THERE?
>> IT WILL.
FRANKLY THE SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN
EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST.
WE DON'T WANT IRAN TO BENEFIT
FROM A WINDFALL OF HIGHER OIL
PRICES.
AND THE ALLIES THAT COUNT THE
MOST, FRANKLY NOT FRANCE AND
GERMANY HERE.
IT'S PATHETIC THAT THEY'VE
DECIDED TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY
DOING BUSINESS WITH THE BIGGEST
DETABLIZING FORCE AND THE
BIGGEST OPPONENT OF FREEDOM IN
THE MIDDLE EAST -- THAT'S HOW
YOU PUT PRESSURE.
>> SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB
EMIRATES.
ALL OF THE MIDDLE EAST IS
UNIFIED.
THAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT CAME
OUT OF THE IRAN DEAL THAT WAS
GOOD.
EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS BAD.
IT GOT THE ARABS AND THE
ISRAELIS ON THE SAME SIDE AT ONE
POINT.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR MOINT.
