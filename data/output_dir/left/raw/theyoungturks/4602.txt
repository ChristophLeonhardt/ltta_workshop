1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,559
DURING THE SENATE RECESS
REPUBLICANS ARE DOING EVERYTHING

2
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:07,290
THEY CAN TO AVOID ACTUALLY
TALKING WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,549
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE
CONVERSATION WILL GO TO

4
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,549
HEALTHCARE.

5
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:17,020
THEY HAVE COME UP WITH A WAY TO
CHANGE THE CONVERSATION

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,020
WITH THIS AD.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,020
>> WHERE'S THE PLAN?

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
HASH BROWN
WHERE IS THE PLAN?

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,640
>>DEMOCRATS DID HAVE A PLAN, IT
IS CALLED OBAMA CARE.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,140
IS A WEIRD

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,310
THING TO SAY WHERE IS YOUR PLAN
TO REPLACE YOUR PLAN?

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,310
NEVER

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,320
AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS ON
ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WILL USE

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,110
IT IN A TV AD.

15
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,600
>>IF OBAMA CARE DOESN'T COVER
EVERYBODY THAN THE ONLY

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,950
SOLUTION IS TO KICK 22 MILLION
PEOPLE OFF OF OBAMA CARE.

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,950
DUH.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,990
>>HELLO MCFLY.

19
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,329
THAT IS WHY
PEOPLE LIKE A MANCHIN ARE SO

20
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,950
HURTFUL TO THE CAUSE.

21
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,880
HE HELPS
REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR TALKING

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
POINTS.

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,920
IT IS PART OF HIS ROLE.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,680
MOST IMPORTANTLY THE GUY THEY

25
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,409
QUOTED THE MOST OF THEIR
WAS BERNIE SANDERS.

26
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:12,229
HE SAYS THAT IS A VERY GOOD
POINT AND THEY CUT HIM OFF.

27
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:14,330
>>DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS
EMBARRASSING THAT BERNIE

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,460
DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER?

29
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,729
THEN I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT IS
IT.

30
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,869
THAT IS EMBARRASSING CENK.

31
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:19,869
>>

32
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:23,470
YOU WILL BE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT
BERNIE SANDERS DOES HAVE A PLAN.

33
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,470
>>WHAT?

34
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:44,920
I JUST WATCH THE VIDEO HE SAID
HE HAD YOU HAD A GOOD POINT –

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,780
>>BERNIE SANDERS IS IN FAVOR OF
MEDICARE FOR ALL.

36
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,780
ELIZABETH

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,140
WARREN HAS ALSO SAID SHE IS IN
FAVOR OF SINGLE-PAYER.

38
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,140
IS NOT

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
TRUE THAT DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A
PLAN, THEY DO DEFINITIVELY.

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
ONE

41
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,520
SIDE OF THE POLITICAL EQUATION
JUST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LYING OR

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,740
MISLEADING PEOPLE AT ALL.

43
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,860
THAT
IS WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY THAT

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,630
THOSE MAINSTREAM MEDIA PEOPLE,
THEY TAKE REPUBLICAN TALKING

45
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,060
POINTS AND READ THEM ON THE AIR.

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,090
>>I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING
THAT THEY WERE USING SO MANY OF

47
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,349
THOSE FAKE NEWS PURVEYORS IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

48
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:12,390
WEIRD, ALL OF A

49
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,590
SUDDEN YOU LIKE THE QUESTIONS
THEY ARE ASKING.

50
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,590
THERE IS

51
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,920
OBVIOUSLY VARIOUS FORMS OF
SINGLE-PAYER, THERE IS MEDICARE

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
FOR ALL.

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,730
IF YOU WANTED TO BE
ABLE TO POINT TO A PLAN, THAT IS

54
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,280
AN EASY WAY TO DO THAT.

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,080
BUT THEY
ALSO TWEETED THINGS LIKE THIS.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,920
THEY THEN GO FORWARD IN THIS
NEXT TWEET– SO HILLARY CLINTON

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,360
EVEN RESPONDED AND PUT THE LINK
TO HER HEALTH CARE PLAN.

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
I DON'T

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,770
THINK IT IS NEARLY AS GOOD AS
MEDICARE FOR ALL, BUT IT IS A

60
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,770
PLAN.

61
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,210
YOU COULD – THINGS ARE
BEING DEBATED THAN OTHER

62
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,410
DEMOCRATS HAVE PUT FORWARD.

63
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,630
BEFORE THE ELECTION REMEMBER WHO

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,890
WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE?

65
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,210
IF
THE DEMOCRATS HAD TRIED TO DO

66
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,800
SOMETHING WHAT IT HAVE GOTTEN
THROUGH THE SENATE?

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
THIS IS BS

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,069
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

69
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:54,880
OF COURSE IT WILL JUST BE
PLAYED UNCRITICALLY AND THEIR

70
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,950
FOLLOWERS WILL LOVE IT.

71
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,610
>>MEDIA, STOP WITH THE FALSE
EQUIVALENCIES.

72
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,610
THE INSANE POINT

73
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,540
THEY ARE MAKING SPECIFICALLY
WITH HILLARY CLINTON WHO I HAVE

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,209
NO LOVE FOR IS DONALD TRUMP WON
THE ELECTION AND REPUBLICANS

75
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:14,069
CONTROL THE WHITE HOUSE, THE
HOUSE, AND THE SENATE, SO IT IS

76
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,610
OBVIOUSLY HILLARY CLINTON'S
FAULT THAT REPUBLICANS CAN'T

77
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,980
PASS A HEALTH PLAN.

78
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,989
WE ARE
ENTERTAINING THAT INSANE POINT?

79
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:39,420
>>OR IT IS UP TO HER TO PUT
FORWARD A PLAN WHEN SHE IS IN

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,790
THE WOODS?

81
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:50,800
SHE IS PROBABLY DOING
A LOT OF FUNDRAISING AND COMES

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,360
UP AT RANDOM TIMES AND SAYS
SOMETHING ANNOYING.

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
WHEN THE

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:04,629
STAKES ARE AS HIGH AS THEY ARE
IT IS FRUSTRATING.

85
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:14,370
WHEN THEY PUT

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:21,629
FOR THIS AD SAYING WE WANT TO
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM – IT IS THE

87
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,749
DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T HAVE A
SOLUTION.

88
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,710
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING

89
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:35,889
FINE IF WE CAN'T PASS THIS PLAN
WE JUST REPEAL IT AND WE DON'T

90
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,029
EVEN REPLACE IT RIGHT NOW.

91
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:43,699
YOU
THINK 22 MILLION IS A LOT OF

92
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:44,889
PEOPLE?

93
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:51,469
WAIT UNTIL THEY SHOW YOU
REPEAL WITH NO REPLACEMENT.

94
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:52,469
A

95
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:57,550
LOT MORE PEOPLE WILL SEE THIS
AD THEN PUSHING FOR REPEAL

96
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,729
WITH NO REPLACEMENT.

97
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,660
>>IT'S LIKE IF I PASS THE
GETTING OUT OF POLITICS

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
AMENDMENT

99
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,399
– IT IS THE MEDIA'S FAULT
BECAUSE THEY ENTERTAIN THIS

100
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,399
BULLSHIT.

101
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:20,819
IF THEY ARE FAKE IN
ANY WAY IT IS IN THEIR BULLSHIT

102
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,819
EQUIVALENCIES THAT DRIVE ME
NUTS.

103
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,930
>> WHEN THEY ASK THEM WHAT
EFFECTS OBAMA CARE.

104
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,169
THEIR FIRST

105
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:37,270
ANSWER SHOULD BE THEY ALLOWED
PEOPLE 

106
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,560
WHO ARE LOOKING TO

107
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:56,370
DISRUPT IT TO ADD THINGS AND
GIVE CONTROL TO GOVERNORS IN

108
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:14,580
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AND TAKE IT DOWN SO IT COULD

109
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,819
HAVE PROBLEMS.

110
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:27,910
THEY CAN SAY LOOK
WHAT HE DID TO DESTROY THEIR

111
00:06:27,910 --> 00:07:06,080
HEALTH CARE WHEN THEIR WHOLE
PURPOSE WAS TO DESTROY THIS

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:08:15,889
HEALTHCARE INSTEAD OF 
GETTING 

113
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:30,189
IT
TO A 

114
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,540
GOOD POINT WHERE IT

115
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,149
CAN WORK.

116
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:37,860
>>WHEN THEY SAY EVERYONE AGREES
THAT OBAMA CARE IS A DISASTER.

117
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,309
NO, EVERYONE DOES NOT AGREE.

118
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,249
I
DON'T AGREE.

119
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,310
IT HAS ITS ISSUES,

120
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,640
BUT IT IS NOT A DISASTER, IT IS
WAY BETTER THAN WHAT IT WAS

121
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,259
BEFORE.

122
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,540
AND IT IS TRIPLING THE
REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL IN

123
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
POPULARITY.

124
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,300
IF YOU THINK OBAMA
CARE IS A PROBLEM, WAIT UNTIL

125
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,410
YOU GET THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL.

126
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,699
HEY REPUBLICANS, AMERICAN
PEOPLE DESPISE YOUR PLAN.

127
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,560
WHY DO YOU CONTINUE ON THIS
RECKLESS PATH THAT IS

128
00:09:09,560 --> 00:00:00,000
CLEARLY UNDEMOCRATIC?
