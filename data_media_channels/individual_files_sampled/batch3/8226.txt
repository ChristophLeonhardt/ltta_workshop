ANYTHING. THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT. HEALTH CARE WOULD BE A DISASTER. STEVE: I KNOW YOU TRAVELED ON AIR FORCE ONE AND ROD ROSENSTEIN WAS ONBOARD. YOU HAD APPARENTLY A 45-MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH HIM. YOU WERE GOING DOWN TO ORLANDO FOR THE POLICE CHIEFS CONFERENCE. APPARENTLY A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WANTED TO HAVE HIM ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY. THEY WANTED HIM TO BE UNDER OATH AND HE WAS RELUCTANT TO DO THAT REPORTEDLY. WOE HAVE PREFERRED AN INFORMAL MEETING WITH PERHAPS JUST ONE OR TWO MEMBERS, NOT A WHOLE HEARING. BUT APPARENTLY YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAD GREGG JARRETT ON AND HE SAID THAT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO SHOW UP BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE UNDER OATH. YOU KNOW THE RUMOR IS THE DAY AFTER THE MIDTERMS YOU'RE GOING TO FIRE HIM AND FIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WELL I ACTUALLY GET ALONG WELL WITH ROD. WE HAVE A WITCH-HUNT GOING ON WHICH IS DISGRACEFUL. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I WILL TAKE THESE REPUBLICAN GUYS WITH MARK MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN AND GATES AND GIBBS, ALL OF THEM, I HATE TO MENTION A FEW NAME BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME OF THEM, I WANT TO GIVE EVERYONE OF THEM CREDIT. THESE ARE TOUGH, SMART GUYS. THEY KNOW THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. IT TURNED OUT WITH RUSSIA. THERE WAS COLLUSION BUT IT WAS WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THE DNC. I MEAN WHY DIDN'T, AS AN EXAMPLE THE FBI TAKE THE DNC SERVER? THEY DIDN'T TAKE IT. THEY KNOW WHERE IT IS. THERE IS SO MANY QUESTIONS. ONE THING I'LL SAY THESE REPUBLICAN FOLKS, I THINK THEY'RE BECOMING FOLK HEROES, THESE ARE GREAT, GREAT, PEOPLE. AND THEY WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE STEVE: BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, THE PEOPLE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION, ROD ROSENSTEIN, WILL NOT SHOW UP ON CAPITOL HILL TO SPEAK TO CONGRESS. ACTUALLY I WAS SURPRISED AT THAT I WOULD THINK HE WOULD. HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS TO ME, THAT YOU KNOW ARE VERY POSITIVE ABOUT THAT EVENT. I WOULD IMAGINE YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT THAT DOWN. FRANKLY WHETHER YOU WERE UNDER OATH OR NOT SHOULDN'T MATTER. BUT HE MENTIONED THINGS TO ME I WOULD THINK WOULD BE FINE FOR HIM TO TESTIFY. SO YOU KNOW WHEN CONGRESS CALLS. SO I WOULD I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED ROD WOULDN'T DO IT. WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH ROD BECAUSE WE LOOKWORK ON OTHER THINGS. BRIAN: I HEAR YOU'RE BONDED BY ONE THING, DISTRUST OF ANDY MCCABE, IS THAT TRUE. AND McCABE IS A BAD BUY. COMEY IS A VERY BAD GUY. THIS COUNTRY GOT LUCKY WHEN I VOTED FOR HIM. ROD WROTE A MEMO, YOU READ THAT MEMO HOW HORRIBLE COMEY IS. HE IS HORRIBLE GUY AND HE LIED AND HE LEAKED. HE LIED BEFORE CONGRESS. HE WAS LEAKING ALL OVER THE PLACE, NOT ONLY THROUGH HIS PROFESSOR, HIS PROFESSOR FRIEND, TOOK HIS STUFF AND LEAKED WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO. COMEY IS A BAD GUY, McCABE, VERY BAD BUT HE WORKED FOR COMEY. REMEMBER ONE THING ABOUT McCABE, HIS WIFE WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND HE GOT $750,000 FROM HILLARY CLINTON'S ESSENTIALLY PAC. IT WAS RUN BY TERRY McAULIFFE WHO IS ABSOLUTELY HILLARY CLINTON'S, ABSOLUTELY HILLARY CLINTON'S BEST FRIEND AND BILL CLINTON. THEY GAVE HIM $750,000 FOR HIS WIFE. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS IF SHE SPENT THE MONEY. SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE SPENT THE MONEY. THIS WAS AT THE TIME SHE WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY McCABE. SO McCABE IS INVESTIGATING HILLARY CLINTON AND HER PAC, ESSENTIALLY RUN BY HER BEST FRIEND IS PAYING McCABE $750,000. TO ME THAT'S A BIG DEAL. NOBODY EVER MENTIONS IT. IT IS REALLY LOOK, WE HAVE A HORNET'S NEST. I THINK I HAVE DONE A GREAT SERVICE FOR THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE I EXPOSED SO MUCH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT EMAILS BETWEEN THE TWO LOVERS, STRZOK AND LISA PAGE, YOU SAY THE INSURANCE POLICY, THEY'RE SO WANTING TO WIN AGAINST TRUMP, BUT THEN IN A MOMENT OF SILENCE THEY SAID, WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT, WE HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY. WELL THE INSURANCE POLICY IS WHAT HAS GONE ON FOR THE LAST FAIRLY LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE PEOPLE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE LIKE DEVIN NUNEZ, HE SHOULD GET, IF THIS ALL TURNS OUT LIKE EVERYONE THINKS IT WILL, DEVIN NUNEZ SHOULD GET THE MEDAL OF HONOR. HE IS REALLY, WHAT HE HAS GONE THROUGH AND HIS BRAVERY. HE SHOULD GET A VERY IMPORTANT MEDAL. MAYBE WE'LL CALL IT MEDAL OF FREEDOM BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY GIVE THEM, HIGH AWARD FOR CIVILIANS. HE HAS DONE AN AMAZING, GUYS LIKE MEADOWS AND JIM JORDAN, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE, WHAT THEY, WHAT THEY GO THROUGH AND THEY'RE RIGHT. AND THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE BEING STYMIED AT SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS. BUT NOW IT IS COMING OUT AND IT'S A REALLY SAD. I DID A GREAT SERVICE FOR THIS COUNTRY WHEN I FIRED COMEY. WEIGH AS BAD GUY WITH BAD INTENTIONS. YOU LOOK AT THE WAY HE HANDLED ONE THING JUST TO FINISH UP ON THAT. YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS HATED COMEY MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING. HE ACTUALLY DID HILLARY CLINTON A BIG FAVOR BECAUSE SHE SHOULD BE IN JAIL, THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER RIGHT OFF THE CAMPAIGN BUT, SO HE DID HER A BIG FAVOR. BUT DEMOCRATS HATED COMEY, HATED HIM. I SAID ONE THING IS, I SAID I WOULD GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. YOU LOOK AT SCHUMER, ALL THOSE PEOPLE, THEY PUT OUT HORRIBLE STATEMENTS ABOUT COMEY, HE SHOULD BE FIRED, HE IS IS DISGRACE. THE MINUTE HE WAS FIRED THEY CAME OUT SAID HE WAS WONDERFUL MAN. I SAID I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THE SAID THE DAY AFTER HE WAS FIRED LIKE FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET. SO YOU KNOW, THEY'RE POLITICIANS. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU. AINSLEY: I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP FIRING, YOUR WIFE RECENTLY HAD AN INTERVIEW, THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE SHE DOESN'T TRUST, PEOPLE YOU DON'T TRUST, YOU HAVE TO WATCH YOUR BACK. IS THAT TRUE, A, AND B, IF THAT IS THE CASE WHY ARE THEY STILL IN THE ADMINISTRATION? WELL I THINK IT WAS MORE TRUE BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, I WAS IN WASHINGTON PROBABLY SEVEN TEEN TIMES IN MY LIFE. I CAME TO WASHINGTON ON THE 18th TIME, I SAID DARLING, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, I'M PRESIDENT. I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. NOW I KNOW EVERYBODY. I KNOW SOME THAT I WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I THINK NOW WE'RE REALLY, YOU LOOK, NIKKI HALEY AS AN EXAMPLE DID A FREIGHT JOB, REALLY GREAT JOB. SHE IS GOING TO BE REPLACED BY SOMEBODY THAT IS FANTASTIC. I KNOW, WE HAVE FIVE PEOPLE. WE HAD SEVEN BUT FIVE BRIAN: CAN YOU TELL US THE FIVE, CAN YOU TELL US THE FIVE NAMES? I CAN TELL YOU THEY'RE OUTSTANDING, THEY'RE TOP, TOP OF THE LINE. WE HAVE GREAT PEOPLE WORKING R THERE SOME I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH? YES. WE'LL WEED THEM OUT SLOWLY BY SURELY. WHEN YOU LOOK WHAT WE DID WITH MEXICO, CANADA, SOUTH KOREA, LOOK WHAT WE DID WITH NORTH KOREA, THAT WAS GOING INTO A WAR AND NOW AS YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD. SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO THERE IS ONE, THAT IS A CHANGE. HE IS FANTASTIC. HE IS A STAR. HE JUST GOT BACK FROM NORTH KOREA. THAT WAS GOING TO BE WAR AND WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIP. NO MISSILES, NO TESTING, NO NUCLEAR TESTING, NO NOTHING. WE'VE COVERED A LOT. I SAY, I SAY IT OFTEN, THAT WE, ME, WE'VE DONE MORE IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. TAX CUTS, REGULATION CUTS, ALL OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE, JUDGES. BY THE WAY I HAVE TWO SUPREME COURT JUDGES ALREADY AND JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WILL BE FANTASTIC. BUT YOU TOP THAT WITH BRIAN: GOTCHA. TAKE A LOOK WHO WE HAVE. JUSTICE GORSUCH, JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, MANY, MANY OTHER JUDGES SO WE'VE DONE MORE THAN ANYBODY. I DON'T EVEN THINK IT IS CLOSE. BRIAN: MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW ONE THING HAS YOU CONCERNED, JAMMAL KHASKHOGGI, WORKING FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST" DISAPPEARED FROM THE TURKISH EMBASSY. THEY HAVE VIDEO GOING IN AND NOT GOING OUT. THEY HAVE RUMORS THAT HE IS DEAD. "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTED THAT YOU'RE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH LACK OF ANSWERS. JARED KUSHNER, YOUR SON-IN-LAW IS TIGHT WITH THE CROWN PRINCE AND CROWN PRINCE CALLS THE SHOTS IN SAUDI ARABIA. YOU'RE TIGHT WITH HIM TOO. WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET SOME ANSWERS? WE'LL LOOK AT IT VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL. YOU DON'T HAVE AMERICAN CITIZENS BUT THAT IN THIS CASE DOESN'T MATTER. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT WITH RESPECT TO REPORTERS. IT IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PRECEDENT. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN. AND WE'RE BEING VERY TOUGH AND WE HAVE INVESTIGATORS OVER THERE AND WE'RE WORKING WITH TURKEY AND FRANKLY WE'RE WORKING WITH SAUDI ARABIA. WE WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. HE WENT IN AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE CAME OUT. CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE IS AROUND. BUT HE IS WENT IN AND BRIAN: WHAT IS AT STAKE WITH U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS SIR? I'VE SAID THEY ARE EXCELLENT. I TOLD THEM THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR MILITARY. SAUDI ARABIA IS A VERY RICH COUNTRY. AND FOR YEARS AND YEARS, THERE WOULD BE NO SAUDI ARABIA IF THERE WASN'T A UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE PROTECTED THEM. WE DON'T GET PAID FOR THIS PROTECTION. WE SHOULD BE PAID. WE SPEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR PROTECTING SAUDI ARABIA. AND I'VE TOLD THE KING, KING SALOMAN, I SAID, KING, SORRY, YOU GOT TO PAY. I SAID THAT LOUD AND CLEAR. BUT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. BRIAN: YOU CAN'T BE KILLING, YOU CAN'T BE KILLING "WASHINGTON POST" JOURNALISTS. IS EVERYTHING IN JEOPARDY NOW, SIR? IS THAT IN JEOPARDY NOW, GOOD RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA? I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. I DO HAVE TO FIND OUT. WE'RE PROBABLY GETTING CLOSER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK BUT I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. STEVE: "THE WASHINGTON POST" IS REPORTING THIS MORNING THAT THE CROWN PRINCE, MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN ORDERED OPERATION TO LURE HIM BACK TO SAUDI ARABIA FROM VIRGINIA AND DETAIN HIM ACCORDING TO THE U.S. INTEL INTERCEPTS OF SAUDI OFFICIALS DISCUSSING THE PLAN. AINSLEY: OKAY. STEVE: THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT GOES TO THE TOP, MR. PRESIDENT. BRIAN: THAT WOULD BE A VERY SAD THING AND WE'LL PROBABLY KNOW IN THE VERY SHORT FUTURE. WE HAVE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND INCREDIBLE TALENT WORKING ON IT. WE DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE IT. NO GOOD. AINSLEY: MR. PRESIDENT, LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE MIDTERMS, HISTORICALLY ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE STAYING HOME FOR THE MIDTERMS AND WHICH STATES DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WIN? SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING I WISH YOU WERE RUNNING I WOULD BE VOTING. I SAID DO ME A FAVOR, GO OUT AND VOTE, I SAY AT MY RALLIES, GO OUT AND VOTE. HISTORICALLY WHOEVER WINS THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY, THEY DON'T DO WELL IN MIDTERMS. I THINK IS DIFFERENT, THE ECONOMY IS BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN EVER. THIS IS THE STRONGEST ECONOMY WE EVER HAD. WE TALKED ABOUT JOBS BEFORE, IT IS THE BEST. I REALLY THINK PEOPLE WILL GO IT. I REALLY THINK JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, THE WAY HE WAS TREATED SO BADLY, THIS IS FINE MAN WHAT THEY DID TO HIM THE DEMOCRATS I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WILL FORGET THAT SO QUICKLY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THE MIDTERMS. I THINK WE'LL DO VERY WELL. I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE SENATE RACES THAT WE WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO CONTEST, THAT WERE WE'RE ACTUALLY LEADING IN. I COULD MENTION NAMES. I WON'T, MAYBE I MENTION ONE OR TWO. HEIDI. HEIDI WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW, WIN WE HAVE A, WE HAVE A MAN, NORTH DAKOTA, WE HAVE A MAN WHO IS FANTASTIC AND WE ASKED HIM TO RUN, THE MOST POPULAR, HE IS JUST A GREAT, GREAT PERSON. BRIAN: KEVIN CRAMER. KEVIN IS JUST A GREAT PERSON. HE IS RUNNING UP LIKE 13 POINTS. STEVE: RIGHT. PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE. ON MANY SENATE RACES, RACES WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE, WE'LL DO AT LEAST VERY WELL, IN MANY CASE IS I THINK WE'LL WIN. WITH THE HOUSE MANY CASES PEOPLE WILL CALL RUN. I REALLY THINK REPUBLICANS ARE ENERGIZED, MUCH MORE SO NOW THAN TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO. STEVE: MR. PRESIDENT, A NEW "QUNNIPIAC POLL" CAME OUT THIS MORNING WHAT HAD BEEN A TIGHT RACE DOWN IN TEXAS BETWEEN CRUZ AND O'ROURKE, CRUZ OPENED IT UP, HE IS NOW AT 54%. MR. O'ROURKE IS AT 45. HE IS AHEAD BY NINE. YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK YOUR BASE RIGHT NOW, IF LAST NIGHT'S RALLY WERE ANY INDICATION, THEY'RE ENERGIZED BUT THE BIG QUESTION, SIR, HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT ENERGY UP? HOW DO YOU KEEP THE REPUBLICANS AND THE RIGHT-LEANING INDEPENDENTS, THE ENERGY UP SO THEY WILL VOTE FOR YOUR SIDE? WELL I REALLY THINK THEY HAVE IT NATURALLY, I REALLY DO AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT EVEN BEFORE JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, IF YOU LOOK AT OVER THE LAST MONTH OR TWO MONTH. I DIDN'T BELIEVE THE POLLS BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS ENERGY. I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HAVE TREMENDOUS ENERGY. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR 401(k)S REALLY GOOD. THEY'RE UP40 OR 50% IN 401(k)S. THEY NEVER HAD IT. STEVE: YESTERDAY WAS A BAD DAY FOR INVESTORS. THAT'S FINE. FEDERAL RESERVE IS GETTING A LITTLE TOO CUTE, THAT'S ALL. THAT IS RED INCLUDES WHAT THEY'RE DOING. DEMOCRATS LOOK WHAT THEY WOULD DO TO IT. THEY WOULD KNOCK IT DOWN, INSTEAD OF UP 50% YOU WOULD BE DOWN 50%. WHEN I TOOK OVER THIS ECONOMY, THIS ECONOMY WAS READY TO CRASH. WE WERE AT 1% GDP. NOW WE'RE AT 4.2%. IT WAS READY TO CRASH. IT WAS THE WORST, IF YOU LOOK FROM DEPRESSION, FROM THE GREAT DEPRESSION, IT WAS THE WORST RECOVERY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND OBAMA THREW TREMENDOUS MONEY AT IT. DON'T FORGET OBAMA WAS PLAYING WITH ZERO MONEY. SO HE WAS PLAYING WITH FUNNY MONEY. HE WAS, IT WAS VERY EASY. I'M PAYING INTEREST AT A HIGH RATE BECAUSE OF OUR FED. AND I WOULD LIKE OUR FED NOT TO BE SOING A AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE BUT I'M, I'M PLAYING WITH, YOU KNOW, WITH MONEY THAT WE PAY INTEREST. NOW THAT IS GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH MONEY IN THE BANK AND NOW THEY CAN GET INTEREST ON THEIR MONEY FOR FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME BUT IT IS GOOD IN CERTAIN WAYS BUT THEY'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. THEY'RE BEING TOO AGGRESSIVE. BRIAN: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT CHINA, IF WE CAN, WE WERE STRUCK WHEN ONE OF OUR BATTLESHIPS CAME WITHIN 45 YARDS OF A CHINESE SHIP AND WE HAD TO BACK OUT. THEY ARE EXTREMELY DISTURBED ABOUT YOURING A AGGRESSIVE STANCE WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE AND THEY'RE STEALING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM OUR PEOPLE. WE'RE COMING TO LOGGERHEADS WITH THAT FELLOW SUPERPOWER. WHERE IS THAT HEADING AND IS THIS ALL HANDS ON DECK WITH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ALONG WITH THE TREASURY ON THE SAME PAGE TO STOP THEM AS THEY LOOK TO EXPAND AROUND THE GLOBE? WELL SURE, BUT YOU STOP THEM ECONOMICALLY. LOOK, CHINA WAS TAKING OUT $500 BILLION A YEAR, 500 BILLION, BRIAN, A YEAR. I SAID IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANY LONGER. I DIDN'T GO INITIALLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE HELPED US AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE CONTINUING TO HELP US WITH NORTH KOREA BECAUSE 93% OF THE STUFF GOES THROUGH CHINA TO GET INTO NORTH KOREA. THROUGH THEIR BORDER. CHINA HAS BEEN QUITE GOOD. THEY COULD BE BETTER BUT THEY'RE QUITE GOOD WHAT WE'RE DOING IN NORTH KOREA IS AMAZING BY THE WAY ACCORDING TO EVERYBODY. SO WITH CHINA I SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS MONEY OUT. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT BUSH. SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY MANY OTHER PRESIDENTS. THEY LET CHINA GET OUT OF CONTROL AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO PAY $500 BILLION A YEAR TO CHINA AND REBUILD CHINA. WE HAVE HELPED REBUILD CHINA MORE THAN ANY OTHER FACTOR. WE HAVE HELPED REBUILD IT. I SAID IT'S OVER. THEY'RE NOT HAPPY. THEY CAN'T BE HAPPY ABOUT IT. THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, I TOLD THEM THE SAME THING THE THEY DON'T TAKE OUR PRODUCT AND YET THEIR MERCEDES-BENZS AND BMWs IN TO SEE US. THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN WITH CHINA. THAT'S THE BIG ONE. THAT'S THE REAL BIG ONE. THEY'RE TAKING OUT $500 BILLION AND NOW I PUT $250 BILLION WORTH OF TAXES OR TARIFFS ON CHINA AND IT HAS HAD A BIG IMPACT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR. STEVE: WHAT'S NEXT? IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR ECONOMY, A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. THEIR ECONOMY HAS GONE DOWN VERY SUBSTANTIALLY. I HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO IF I WANT TO DO IT. I DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT THEY HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE. I WILL TELL YOU THIS, AND I'VE SAID IT, ACTUALLY I SAID IT LAST NIGHT TO SHANNON, I WILL TELL YOU THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE. THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE BADLY BUT I TOLD THEM YOU'RE NOT READY YET. YOU'RE NOT READY YET. THEY LIVED TOO WELL FOR TOO LONG AND FRANKLY I GUESS THEY THINK THAT THE AMERICANS ARE STUPID PEOPLE. AMERICANS ARE NOT STUPID PEOPLE. WE WERE LED BADLY WHEN IT CAME TO TRADE. THAT INCLUDES WITH MEXICO, WHICH WE'VE SOLVED, IT INCLUDES WITH CANADA, IT INCLUDES WITH EVERYBODY. ONE BY ONE WE'RE KNOCKING THEM OFF. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAVE SUCH POTENTIAL IN OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE WERE, WE WERE DOING THIS WITH THESE HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS. FRANKLY WITH HORRIBLE MILITARY DEALS WHERE WE PROTECT WEALTHY COUNTRIES LIKE JAPAN AND SAUDI ARABIA AND SOUTH KOREA. THEY DON'T PAY US. IT IS RIDICULOUS. WE'RE PROTECTING THE WORLD AND THEY DON'T PAY US.
