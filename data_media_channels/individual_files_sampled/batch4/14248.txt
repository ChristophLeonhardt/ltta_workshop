well for the first time in like forever I took the subway in Toronto the other day the slogan of the Toronto Transit Commission is the better way I kind of questioned that for me TTC has always stood for either take the car or telephone the cab because let's face it folks is there anything more soul-destroying than hitching a ride on public transit thanks to the ongoing decline of civility my aversion to public transit is not only due to the inherent profound problem of public trends at the world over namely buses and trains and streetcars and trolleys they just don't pick you up exactly where you are and they don't drop you off exactly where you want to be no my prime phobia to public transit is simply the behavior of so many other writers the ones who use a seat on a crowded bus for their backpack for example or the young able-bodied person who refuses to surrender his seat to someone who is elderly or nursing an injury and don't get me started on the number of people eating food and leaving behind their leftovers of that Popeyes chicken combo they picked up what was that Bruce Coburn song again if I had a rocket launcher now during my most recent attempt at riding the rails I looked around the crowded subway car striving to determine if this is indeed the proverbial new normal namely a heaping helping of disrespect and disdain for all others in that sense I can't really blame the TTC for launching a poster campaign going back to last April that sought to teach civilized members of homosapiens - well active civilized members of Homo sapiens and yeah I'm talking adult riders here folks not the kids the you said it ads made use of actual tweets from TTC writers complaining about inconsiderate and even unsafe behavior that has only ramped up over the years one poster stated why do people think a seat is an acceptable place for their dirty shoes or feet another poster stated why is it that people who have the worst taste of music are also the ones who don't own headphones yeah why indeed now the ad campaign came about as a result of a horrendous breach of etiquette on a subway car in which a middle-aged woman sat on the feet of a young man because he was resting those after mentioned claw hoppers on a seat check it out doesn't know I know I know they both design your back - I love my back though thank you okay well then more equal as I'm trying to find you that your feet should we not okay but I imagine you I think I want you my got is not the deal is a way convention that's day you'll decide later do you know for all nations and how can use it what everyone is there a rule under treatment I can put up see right now another social role thank you that video went viral and the debate broke down as follows was the woman being a busybody by sitting on his feet just to initiate an altercation or was the young man being a disrespectful Punk putting his stinky shoes in a place where people are meant to sick I gotta be honest folks I'm on the women's side call her subway bad girl if you must although I'm sure more than one race hustler at the time labelled her white privilege Wonder Woman thanks to the different skin tones because hey that's how we roll in 2018 in any event let's hope that the TT sees my fair lady and ladee campaign pays dividends but at least the TTC did not go down the same Ludacris social engineering path it took circa 1977 that's when the TTC recognizing that Toronto is becoming more diverse and being populated with more people who did not speak English as a first language introduced a truly mind-boggling campaign regarding etiquette which is to say instead of a writer saying excuse me if for example another patron was blocking the door the TTC advocated that writers should say this leap meat yeah meat meat the TTC was hopeful that diverse tronto nians would embrace the telltale slogan of the Looney Toons Road Runner instead of one of Canada's official languages I'm not making this up folks this was a very early example of what would later come to be known as reasonable accommodation meet me pin deed and any event such a pity that TTC brainiacs had to drop that campaign after enduring a preponderance of so many mocking reviews at least the TTC didn't consider issuing transit riders with a wily coyote costume to help keep the lines moving bottom line perhaps a big part of the civility problem is that Toronto has failed miserably to update its public transit system over the decades as the city rapidly grew the system is more overcrowded than ever and it's far less reliable little wonder so many people are just so pissed off but come on folks even with this added burden aren't we all supposed to be at the top of the food chain and from what I've seen of certain public transit riders lately caged Lab Rats tend to behave better for the rebel dog media I'm David the menzo and Benzies like and subscribe to the rebel YouTube page and click the notifications button to never miss our new live show battleground you
