1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,120
THE NUMBER TWO MOST LIKED TWEET
OF ALL TIME IS WHAT'S?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
THIS TWEET FROM BARACK
OBAMA FOLLOWING THE

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
CHARLOTTESVILLE, NO.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
NO.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,119
WE'RE GOING TO GRAPHIC 11.

7
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,120
LET'S START THAT OVER.

8
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,120
THAT IS DIFFERENT AND IT IS
ACTUALLY A GOOD, POSITIVE TWEET.

9
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
ALTHOUGH IT IS A DR.

10
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,120
SEUSS
POLITICAL CARTOON ABOUT THE

11
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,120
ALT-RIGHT AND NAZIS.

12
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

13
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
LET'S START THAT OVER.

14
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
THE NUMBER TWO MOST LIKED TWEET
OF ALL TIME IS THIS ONE

15
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
FROM BARACK OBAMA FOLLOWING THE
INCIDENT IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.

16
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
IT IS HIM OUTSIDE OF A WINDOW
WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS OF ALL

17
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
RACES QUOTING NELSON MANDELA
SAYING, NO ONE IS BORN

18
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
HATING ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE OF
THE COVER OF HIS SKIN OR AS

19
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
BACKGROUND OR HIS RELIGION.

20
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
CONTINUING ON INTO THE NEXT
PEOPLE MUST LEARN TO HATE

21
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,839
AND IF THEY CAN LEARN TO HEY,
THEY CAN BE TAUGHT TO LOVE

22
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,070
AND CONTINUING FINALLY INTO THIS
ONE: FOR LOVE COMES MORE

23
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,659
NATURALLY TO THE HUMAN HEART
THAN ITS OPPOSITE.

24
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,980
QUOTE FROM NELSON MANDELA.

25
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,559
THE FIRST OF THE TWEET GOT 2.6
MILLION LIKES SO OBAMA WINS

26
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,109
IN TERMS OF TWEET LIKES OVER
ANYTHING TRUMP HAS EVER DONE.

27
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,480
FIRST OF ALL, IT IS
IRRELEVANT, OF COURSE, WHO

28
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,940
WINS ON TWITTER, EXCEPT THAT
TRUMP WILL THINK IT'S RELEVANT.

29
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,160
THAT WILL GET UNDER TRUMPÃ­S SKIN.

30
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,219
EVEN THOUGH WHO CARES, BUT TO
ME, THE REASON WHY THE

31
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,860
STORIES INTERESTING IS BECAUSE
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT

32
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,290
REACTIONS OF THE TWO PRESIDENTS.

33
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,719
PRESIDENT FROM COMES OUT AND
GOES BOTH SIDES DO IT AND

34
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,170
WON'T CONDEMN NEO-NAZIS, THE
CLAN, AND WHITE NATIONALISTS.

35
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,380
OBAMA PUTS A PICTURE OF CUTE
BABIES FROM ALL DIFFERENT

36
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,030
BACKGROUNDS AND SAYS IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT YOUR SKIN COLOR IS.

37
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,719
IT'S A SIMPLE QUOTE FROM NELSON
MANDELA.

38
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:25,759
IT IS BOTH MUCH MORE
HEARTWARMING AND MORE POSITIVE

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,780
AND BETTER RECEIVED BY THE
NATION.

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,170
WAY BETTER RECEIVED BY THE
NATION AND ALSO, MORE SAVVY.

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,140
PUT CUTE BABIES IN YOUR TWEET,
YOU WILL GET MORE LIKES BUT

42
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,070
TRUMP CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT
BECAUSE HE IS BUILT ON HATE.

43
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,119
HE THINKS NO, I GIVE THEM HATE,
THAT IS WAY GOT ELECTED.

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,031
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM MORE OF
THAT AND OBAMA GOES IN THE

45
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:50,900
OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND PEOPLE GO
REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS?

46
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,509
I THINK ABOUT THE PRESIDENCY
OF THE UNITED STATES THE SAME

47
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,320
WAY I THINK ABOUT WEIGHT NOW.

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,050
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I MEAN.

49
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,079
WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG, AS A WOMAN
AND YOU HAVE A PERFECTLY

50
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,079
FINE BODY.

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,470
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY NITPICKING
THING I WISH I LOST WEIGHT,

52
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,920
LOOK MORE TONED, I WISH THIS OR
THAT.

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,050
THEN YOU GET OLDER NATURALLY
CURE AGE KICKS IN, YOUR

54
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,860
METABOLISM SLOWS DOWN AND YOU
LOOK BACK AT YOURSELF WHEN

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,360
YOU WERE YOUNGER AND YOU ARE
LIKE I WISH I REALLY

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,510
APPRECIATED THE WAY I LOOKED AND
MY HEALTH BACK THEN.

57
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,760
I TOOK IT FOR GRANTED.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,280
THAT IS HOW I FEEL ABOUT OBAMA
VERSUS TRUMP.

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,800
I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THIS.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,110
BY THE WAY, IT IS NOT JUST FOR
WOMEN.

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,280
I LIKE MY HASKELL PICTURES WHEN
I THOUGHT I WAS OVERWEIGHT

62
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,480
AND IT'S LIKE YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

63
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,410
YOU SHOULD'VE ENJOYED THAT
MOMENT THAT WE HAD VERY

64
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,810
LEGITIMATE CRITICISM OF BARACK
OBAMA THROUGHOUT THE BOY,

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,780
WAIT UNTIL YOU GET A LOAD OF THE
NEXT PRESIDENT.

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T CRITICIZE OBAMA FOR

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,280
THE THINGS HE DID WRONG, COURSE
YOU SHOULD, BUT IF YOU HAVE A

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,120
SENSE OF PROPORTIONALITY, WE
COULD FILL UP NOT JUST OURS FULL

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,360
OF SHOWS, BUT YEARS FOR SHOWS
AND CRITICISM OF TRUMP IN THESE

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,500
JUST LAST SEVEN MONTHS AS
COMPARED TO OBAMA'S EIGHT YEARS.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,970
IT IS NIGHT AND DAY.

72
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,260
I DON'T REGRET THE ISSUES
THAT I CRITICIZED OBAMA ON,

73
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,980
HOWEVER, I DO REGRET NOT
APPRECIATING THE FACT THAT I

74
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,970
DIDN'T WAKE UP WITH THIS SENSE
OF PANIC EVERY MORNING.

75
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,320
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

76
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,090
AT SUCH A LOW BARBER OBAMA
DECLARED.

77
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,920
FOR ANYONE.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,930
WE WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND
OUR PRESIDENT DIDN'T CHEER

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,930
NAZIS.

80
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,930
YEA.

81
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,780
IT'S A WEIRD THING TO CHEER.

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,150
OR THREATEN NUCLEAR WAR.

83
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:46,430
WE ARE STILL ALIVE BECAUSE OUR
IDIOT MEGALOMANIAC MORON EVER

84
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,890
PRESIDENT DIDN'T ACCIDENTALLY
START A NUCLEAR WAR.

85
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,810
THAT IS A REALLY LOW BAR TO
CLEAR.

86
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,980
OBAMA CLEARED EASILY BY BEING
SANE.

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,120
IN ADDITION, JUST THE NUMBERS
ALONE ON TWITTER WERE PEOPLE SAY

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,150
THAT TRUMP HAS CHANGED THE GAME
AND IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

89
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,900
PRESENT PERSONAL TWITTER,
BARACK OBAMA, DONALD TRUMP HAS

90
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,500
35.9 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
TWITTER, BARACK OBAMA HAS

91
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,040
93.2 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON
TWITTER.

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,039
AND TRUMP HAS TWEETED 35.5
THOUSAND TIMES TO GET THOSE

93
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,800
FOLLOWERS THAT OBAMA HAS ONLY
TWEETED 15.5 THOUSAND TIMES.

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,580
TRUMPS BIG TWEETS THAT YOU SEE
ONLINE GET ANYWHERE, THE BIGGEST

95
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,330
ONES GET HUNDRED AND 80,000
LIKES TO MAYBE 200,000 LIKES.

96
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,039
THE FATHER'S DAY TWEET THAT
OBAMA MADE, JUST SAYING HAPPY

97
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,300
FATHER'S DAY, REFLECTING ON WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE A FATHER GOT 1.3

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
MILLION LIKES.

99
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,379
IT IS JUST THIS WEIRD SENSE OF
DISPROPORTIONALITY WERE PEOPLE

100
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,340
HAVE JUST MODEL LIFT TRUMP AS
THE PERSON WHO DOES BEST ON

101
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,830
TWITTER AND YES, HE HAS THE
ABILITY TO, THROUGH THAT,

102
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,050
COMMUNICATE IN A CERTAIN WAY TO
A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE BUT IT IS

103
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,849
MISREPRESENTATIVE OF HOW PEOPLE
REACT EITHER PERSONS TWITTER

104
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,039
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE SENSIBLE
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAN NON-

105
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,110
SENSIBLE PEOPLE OUT THERE.

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,110
EVEN ON TWITTER.

107
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,240
FINALLY, LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH
THIS GREAT POINT THAT ONE

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,419
OF OUR HOST MADE.

109
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,849
MICHAEL SURE, BACK IN 2012

110
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:21,849
WAS COVERING THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION AND DONALD TRUMP

111
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:24,439
WAS THREATENING TO GET INTO THAT
RESPECT THEN.

112
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,870
HE WAS COVERING IT FOR THE YOUNG
TURKS ON CURRENT TV AND TRUMPET

113
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,659
GONE TO VEGAS SO WE SENT MICHAEL
TO GO LAST FROM QUESTIONS AND HE

114
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:38,631
WAS THE FIRST TO ASK DONALD
TRUMP AT THE TIME HEY, WHY

115
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,229
DO YOU THINK THAT THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE ARE CLAMORING FREE

116
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,919
TO GET IN THE RACE BECAUSE HE IS
ALWAYS LIKE PUFFING UP HIS CHEST

117
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,639
AND TRUMP SAID, LOOK AT HOW MANY
TWITTER FOLLOWERS I HAVE.

118
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,129
OF COURSE THEY WANT ME.

119
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,490
MICHAEL SAID, SNOOP DOGG HAS
MORE.

120
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,710
DOES THAT MEAN HE SHOULD RUN FOR
PRESIDENT?

121
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,889
OF COURSE TRUMP DID NOT KNOW HOW
TO ANSWER THAT.

122
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,729
HE WAS LIKE UH.

123
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:04,479
BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY FUNNY
BUT NOW IT IS BECOME SUCH A

124
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,169
CIRCUS THAT YOU THINK MAYBE DOUG
WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

125
00:06:07,169 --> 00:00:00,000
KID ROCK IS RUNNING FOR
SENATE.
