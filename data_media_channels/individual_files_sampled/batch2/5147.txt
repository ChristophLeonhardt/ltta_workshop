new superseding indictment has been filed by the special counsel in the Robert I'm sorry by special counsel Robert Muller in connection with Paul Manafort skates NBC News investigative reporter Tom winter is here with me in the newsroom Tom explained this to us so Katie Paul manna Ford's been hit with another indictment in his DC case and we have a new name in this although it's a name we've reported about before that's Constantine Coulomb Nick he's an individual that worked with Paul manna Ford in Ukraine he's known as a kind of a political fixer political ideologue in that part of the world he's also somebody that the u.s. government has linked with Russian intelligence somebody that Paul Manafort has done business with for a significant period of time here's what's new today there's been two counts of obstruction of justice one count each obstruction of justice and another count of conspiracy to obstruct justice this goes to the witness tampering allegations that we first heard about earlier this week in that Paul Manafort in Constantine Clinic according to this indictment did conspire to influence delay and prevent the testimony of several people that they had done business with as part of this protein Ian's lobbying effort that had been going on several years ago and so the charges the new charges today relate to that it's the first time that we're seeing Constantine clinic being named in Robert Muller's papers in addition to that Paul Manafort is also going to be facing some new charges of of false and misleading Ferriss statements so that's the the foreign register right before foreign registration that you have to do so if you're working for another government within the United States lobbying doing media outreach certain efforts on their behalf you have to register with the Justice Department and so manna Ford has gotten in trouble for this before tied with this case and today we see some additional counts and some additional information about those efforts and what he didn't do to register last we heard about Manta Ford we heard about these messages he was sending over encrypted apps to try and it seems get people on the same page for their testimony Paul I mean excuse me Robert Muller wanted to put him in jail revoke his bail modified that's correct it was a violation of that where does that stand when is the judge going to decide on that so Katie we had anticipated hearing from Paul manna for its attorneys today for them they had to file by the end of the day today filing with the judge stating what their response was to all of this and what he was doing reaching out to these people and providing some sort of a court filing response in the next Friday Paul Manafort is due to be in court where a judge may make a decision there on the spot and either revoke his bail or find some way to further restrict it that's that's what he's looking at but today he's now been hit with actual charges we knew there was a flurry of activity in the grand jury area of the DC District Courthouse today we we have one of our producers there and so we know that the people that we're handling or have been involved at the mana Ford case were there today so we assume that the grand jury perhaps voted on this and the superseding indictment filed just a few moments ago it seems like Robert Miller is really turning the screws on men for theirs every single way that mana Ford has turned here where he has done something that may be afoul of the law again he hasn't gone to trial he's said he's not guilty of all this conduct but every single time he has taken a turn robert muller has been there to meet him with new charges they've been there to meet him when he's reached out to people in the past they've been there to reach out when he tried to ghostwrite an article in violation of a gag order everything he is doing and we know because he's they've executed search warrants according to court filings on his phone since he's been arrested at every turn he is doing something that they think runs to follow the legal process they are there to meet him with new charges new filings and they've been very open about it again the only hints were getting in the Special Counsel investigation come from their court filings and a lot of those court filings have pertained directly to Paul Manafort like they did again today Tom winter thank you so much for reading that so quickly hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
