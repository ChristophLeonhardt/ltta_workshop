at the restaurant here we kind of look at color you know and feel of the steak rather than you know spoken it with a thermometer or poking it with a fork or because really you never want to do that once you poke it you use juice you lose blood and you start to lose the quality of the good steak first thing when cooking steaks to to a certain temperature you have to realize every grill is different my medium-rare steak is gonna cook a lot faster than if you're trying to cook it on a barbecue grill a trick that I learned in school I'm using your hand to just check the the softness and of the state when you touch your finger here and you see it's very soft right here and you just kind of run down this would be rare this would be medium-rare this would be medium and this would be well-done medium rare for us is about seven seven minutes and thirty seconds a nice caramelized deep brown color we don't play with the steak we don't turn it and turn it again and keep turning it we turn it once we season it we put it on the grill when we see that nice caramelized onion II look in color we flip it once and you can kind of see how soft like when we do with the hand when you press in how soft it is and as you see here these are going to be our well-done in our medium well
