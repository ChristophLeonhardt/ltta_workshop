right different topic now yesterday we reported on anchors from Sinclair own television stations across the country being required to read a script warning viewers about fake news and false reports being quote extremely dangerous to our democracy that got widespread attention after deads been published a video montage showing anchors echoing the same lines in the mandated script now the Sinclair Broadcast Group is responding to the criticism in a memo sent to Sinclair employees yesterday the senior vice president of news Scott Livingston wrote the critics are now upset about our well researched journalistic initiative focused on fair and objective reporting livingston also defended the promos in a press release writing we find it curious that we would be attacked for asking our news people to remind their audiences that unsubstantiated stories exist on social media President Trump tweeted his defense of Sinclair writing so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticized Sinclair broadcasting for being biased Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more fake NBC which is a total joke and tweet the Sinclair Broadcast Group which skews conservative owns or operates more than 190 stations across the United States including 22 NBC affiliates two-thirds of those stations are in states that voted for Trump the Trump is also seeking to excuse native companies also seeking to acquire dozens more by purchasing Tribune media let's bring in senior media reporter for Politico Michael Calderon Michael good morning it's good to see you I think a lot of people just woke up and heard about Sinclair a couple of days ago when this video was making the rounds but talk about the the basis of who they are what they do and just how much television they control and potentially could control going forward that's right in some ways Sinclair Broadcast Group has flown under the radar and that might be because a lot of times the national media focuses on other national media we cover news organizations that are big in Washington and New York City the thing about Sinclair is you just showed is they have reached throughout the broad swath of the country including a large part of the country that voted for Donald Trump and Sinclair right now owns around hundred and ninety stations and if their acquisition of Tribune media goes through they're gonna own about two hundred and thirty stations and have penetration about seventy-two percent of households in the United States so it's got a lot of people concerned about this is not just that Tribune's owning a lot of stations but also that Tribune is known to force local stations around the country to people would assume are being run by people in their communities they forced these stations to run what are called must run segments this can include segments that push a conservative line it includes commentary by people like former trumpet official Boris Epstein and in addition as we saw with these clips they're forcing news anchors to read these promos which talk about fake news and seemed to echo two talking points of Trump that he uses to undermine legitimate news organization and if you listen Michael that people defended the clip that was making it runs from Deadspin the other day they say look Sinclair he's an antidote to generations they believe of biased news from the other side and as Sinclair said yesterday in its in its statement they said look what we're saying is there's a lot of unsubstantiated fake news out there and we're here to keep our eye on it does that hold any water for you know there's another thing that Sinclair mentioned in that memo that you just read from was saying mentioning stories like pizza gate which was a bogus conspiracy theory now I don't think anyone in the news media would be upset if anchors around the country said we're not going to run unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on TV I think the problem was when Sinclair started saying that news organizations not just stuff on social media could be biased and news organizations could run fake stories and news organizations don't do their diligence to fact-check I think that's what it got lodged journalists up in arms and one of the things we're seeing right now which is striking to me as somebody who's covered Sinclair a long time is some local stations and some local anchors are pushing back a bit we saw a station just last night in Madison Sinclair Affiliate a Fox affiliate in Madison say that they were going to run this promo some other anchors at Sinclair has also jumped in on social media on Twitter and Facebook and raised concerns about the promos and also media consolidation more broad like Richard Haass this really does talk to talk about if you will Richard what this sounds like to you where you have somebody that's trying to get a favors with the the president with the White House sending out scripts to journalists all over the country and not only they have must read must must perform segments but more disturbingly to a lot of these anchors there are scripts that they are forced to read that set up the segments that framed the segments and so many of these anchors were starting to find out believe that it's just pure propaganda that they're pushing to promote Donald Trump what it looks like when you look at the map Joe is this a de facto national television network and it's one that's ideological II fueled in which the the local affiliates essentially have precious little independence or integrity and they're forced to toe the company line or they lose their jobs and this is this to me is is at the opposite end of what journalism is meant to be it's meant to be a check and a balance not a not a cheering squad so this seems to me fundamentally at odds with the DNA of this country and our politics I got it this has got among people uncomfortable well Susan Sinclair's vice president put out a statement saying he thought it was curious that they were being attacked for this it's not curious at all I was talking to Vicki yesterday we are trying to figure out any example of newspapers or television stations that actually gave people scripts and ordered them to read it it would be like the New York Times going to Nick Kristof saying this is the op-ed that you're going to put in the newspaper this week and you're going to sign your name to it and go because these local anchors I want to get to Michael in a second about this but what they're doing is they're employing the people who really are the most trusted faces in news and those are America's local anchors absolutely and with those local anchors that are already frustrated enough that they have to do so much reporting on Donald Trump the national news just because it overtakes so much of the national discussion so when they do get a chance to do local reporting it makes it even more curious for them it's harder for them to show that they don't have a bias and they just want to give the local news and I guess Michael to you how much of a concern is it now for these local reporters that they're going to now seem that they're kind of in some bias mode and they're not really being there for their communities right I mean I saw one anchor at a Rochester station a Sinclair owned station who was responding to people on social media and wrote a pretty passionate Facebook post saying you know how they were concerned that this damaged the reputation of not just this journalist but that the station something that had they've been worked on for years and I just looked at her Twitter feed and you had a lot of people in her community saying you know why were you reading this why would you do this if you would read this thing that they put in front of you that you didn't agree with what else are you going on air and saying that you don't agree with so I think not only did Sinclair invite a lot of criticism and a lot more scrutiny than they've had in the past especially if they're trying for this acquisition or Tribune but I think they may have damaged some of the trust that they have in local communities and what we see in polls from pew and others is that you know Americans most likely risa trust their local newscasts and I think people expect when they're looking at local news weather sports and traffic that they're not getting conservative pinon injected in there from somewhere in Maryland and that's the problem these executives at Sinclair and Maryland are telling local newscasts you know what to put in their broadcast and it's frustrated a lot of stations for a couple years in Seattle WJLA in washington DC news news channels local stations have said that they felt coverage got slanted once Sinclair took over when Sinclair exerted this type of heavy hand you know naturally on what they're supposed to be doing locally well you know Michael you and you talked about the Pew poll but I'm sure you've always known this and a lot of people that our media watches have always known the most trusted people in news really usually are those local news anchors Donald Trump is always obsessed with Fox or NBC or CNN but it says people that you know Americans have been following for you know 10 20 years and they really have more of a personal connection with local news anchors than anybody else so if you were if an erdowan were to come to the United States and decide he wanted to control the country and to control what Americans believed that would be a pretty good place to start wouldn't it look I think there's nothing wrong with this White House or political campaigns to look to local news and try to try to reach viewers in that way I think that's a very savvy media strategy well came out after the 2016 election is you had Jared Kushner suggesting that there was come kind of deal made with Sinclair in which they would give more access to Sinclair stations and get maybe less tough coverage or less scrutiny in more unfiltered interviews airing on Sinclair stations now Sinclair disputed that characterization but Kushner has talked about you know in swing states like Ohio it makes more sense to be going to Sinclair stations than to be going to maybe national outlets like an MSNBC or CNN and what we saw at the end of the 2016 election with Donald Trump basically stayed on Fox News and Fox Business but was at the same time doing a number of interviews with Sinclair stations around the country that maybe we're not getting on our radar but for people in these these swing states in Florida Ohio etc you know they were seeing him you know five or six minutes on the local news and I think that's a strategy the Trump campaign definitely tried to pursue and I would think that they're gonna keep doing going forward in this presidency and in the reelection all right Michael Calderon has been covering Sinclair for a long time now we really appreciate it thanks so much Michael thanks still ad this morning on Morning Joe once again we learned something about the president's potential plans not from the White House
