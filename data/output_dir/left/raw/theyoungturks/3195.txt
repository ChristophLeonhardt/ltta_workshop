1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,690
>>DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN FEUDING
WITH A WELL-KNOWN FATHER IN THE

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,200
BASKETBALL WORLD, LAVAR BALL.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,120
HE
HAS SONS WHO ARE PLAYING COLLEGE

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,540
BASKETBALL AT THE MOMENT, AND
ONE OF HIS SONS WAS ARRESTED IN

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,090
CHINA FOR TRAVELING.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,400
TRUMP
CLAIMS THAT HE MANAGED TO GET

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,750
LAVAR BALL'S SON, ALONG WITH TWO
OTHER PLAYERS, BACK TO THE

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,750
UNITED STATES AFTER THEY WERE
DETAINED IN CHINA, AND TRUMP

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,890
WANTED A THANK YOU.

10
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:34,210
LAVAR BALL
HAS REFUSED TO THANK HIM AND

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:41,190
IT'S THE MOST NONSENSICAL FEUD
EVER, BUT SOMETHING HAS COME OUT

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,420
OF THIS THAT I THOUGHT WAS
INTERESTING.

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,510
TRUMP SUPPORTERS

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,079
ARE UPSET THAT LAVAR BALL
REFUSES TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

15
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,510
TRUMP SO THEY ARE TAKING TO
TWITTER TO ATTACK LAVAR BALL,

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,870
EXCEPT THEY ARE MISTAKING LEVAR
BURTON FOR LAVAR BALL.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,870
LEVAR

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,339
BURTON IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
PERSON, YOU MIGHT WERE NUMBER

19
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,750
HIM AS THE HOST OF READING
RAINBOW, THAT'S HOWEVER A MEMO

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,170
HIM FOR MY CHILDHOOD.

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,520
>>THAT DOES SEEM PRETTY
OFFENSIVE.

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,719
>>HE'S A DELIGHTFUL PERSON.

23
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,139
>>I OF COURSE ARE MEMBER HIM
FROM STAR TREK: THE NEXT

24
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,139
GENERATION.

25
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:22,109
>>THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT,
BUT READING RAINBOW I REMEMBER.

26
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:23,950
TAKE A LOOK, IT'S IN A BOOK.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,179
THAT WAS SUCH A GREAT SHOW.

28
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:32,149
>>STAR TREK HAD OKAY GRAPHICS
BACK THEN, BUT THEY JUST TOOK

29
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:38,179
LIKE A HAIR THING THAT YOU PUT
TOGETHER, AND MADE IT HIS

30
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,179
EYEPIECE.

31
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,179
>>DID THEY REALLY?

32
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,259
>>YES, HE'S BLIND BUT HE CAN
SEE BECAUSE OF THE HAIRPIECE ON

33
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,240
HIS HEAD.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,860
GEORDI LAFORGE, ON
DECK.

35
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,700
SO HILARITY ENSUES.

36
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,459
>>ONE PERSON SAYS YOU ARE A
HAS-BEEN ACTOR WITH A HAS-BEEN

37
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,819
FOR A SON AND TRUMP IS THE
PRESIDENT, GET THE PICTURE?

38
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,720
>>I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE GOT THE
PICTURE, MARK.

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,110
>>ANOTHER PERSON WRITES WASHED
UP ACTOR, CHECK.

40
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,110
SON CAUGHT

41
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,360
STEALING IN CHINA, CHECK.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,500
TRUMP
STILL PRESIDENT, CHECK.

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
BUT NONE

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,910
OF THAT IS TRUE, HUH?

45
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,910
LOL.

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,640
>>ONE OF THEM IS NOT TRUE.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,870
ACTUALLY TWO OF THEM ARE NOT

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,870
TRUE.

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,810
>>THERE IS SOME PORTION OF
TRUMP'S BASE THAT, LIKE, THEY

50
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,090
DON'T CARE WHAT TRUMP DOES.

51
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,530
THEY
LOVE THAT TRUMP IS PRESIDENT SO

52
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,250
THEY CAN SAY TRUMP IS PRESIDENT.

53
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,680
THEY GET OFF ON THAT.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,840
>>OUR PROBLEM IS WE DON'T THINK
LIKE THE RIGHT WING.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,480
IF WE DID,

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,760
THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS WOULD BE
LIKE, OBAMA IS PRESIDENT, WHAT

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
NOW?

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
WHICH YOU ALMOST NEVER SAW
ANYONE DO.

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,740
WHAT HAPPENED TO MITT

60
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
ROMNEY?

61
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,100
IT'S IN THE PAST, WE ARE
DONE WITH IT.

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,140
BUT IT'S THE ONLY

63
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,260
THING THEY HAVE TO CLING ONTO.

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,900
THE LAST ONE I THINK IS THE

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,510
WORST, BUT BEFORE WE MOVE ONTO
THAT ONE, A SIMILAR THING

66
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,960
HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY WHERE A
GUY ON TWITTER SAID ANA AND CENK

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,080
DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT
FINANCE.

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
THESE DUMBASSES

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,790
WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SPELL
DERIVATIVES.

70
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,790
AND HE SPELLED

71
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,790
DERIVATIVES WRONG.

72
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,670
WHICH IS JUST
AWESOME, IT'S TWITTER 101.

73
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,670
THIS

74
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,710
GUY IS LIKE OH YEAH, I GOT MY
FACTS RIGHT, YOU HAVE A THIEF

75
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,720
FOR A SON.

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,520
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
YOUR FACTS RIGHT.

77
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
JUST BUY A

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,310
CLUE BEFORE YOU GO ON TWITTER,
THAT'S ALL.

79
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,510
>>I HATE TWITTER.

80
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,770
I FEEL LIKE
TWITTER IS JUST LIKE ONE BIG

81
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,680
EXAMPLE FOR WHY YOU SHOULD JUST
GIVE UP ON HUMANS.

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
IT'S LIKE A

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,110
COLLECTION OF THE WORST PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET ALL IN ONE PLACE.

84
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,930
AND YOU WILL GET SPRINKLES OF
INTERESTING SMART PEOPLE WHO

85
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,709
HAVE FUNNY THINGS TO SAY, BUT
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE LIKE, I

86
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,420
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY LIFE
SO I'M GOING TO PHOTOSHOP STUPID

87
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,300
SHIT ALL DAY.

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,510
>>I HEAR YOU.

89
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,048
IT'S LIKE THE
INTERNET IN A LOT OF WAYS, THE

90
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,408
BEST AND WORST OF US.

91
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:23,460
THERE ARE
FUNNY THINGS THAT HAPPEN ON

92
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,710
TWITTER, SMART COMMENTS, AND YOU
CAN STAY CONNECTED WITH PEOPLE

93
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,849
YOU CARE ABOUT.

94
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:29,660
BUT YES,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LIKE US

95
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,949
AND YOU LIVE ON THE INTERNET AND
YOU HAVE A LOT OF HATERS ON THE

96
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,870
INTERNET -- EVERYONE THINKS I'M
ON TWITTER ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

97
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,099
THEY ARE ON TWITTER ALL THE
TIME, BUT I JUST GO IN AND OPEN

98
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,259
THE DOOR ONCE IN A WHILE --

99
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,340
>>I CRACK IT OPEN LITTLE BIT.

100
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,280
>>THEY THINK I'M IN THE ROOM AND
I'M NOT IN THE ROOM, AND MOST OF

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,240
THE TIMES I NOW OPEN THE DOOR
AND YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF LUNATICS

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,370
SCREAMING IN THE ROOM --

103
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,110
>>IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S ACTUALLY
FLATTERING.

104
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,960
LIKE, IF YOU CAN GET

105
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,189
PAST THE JUVENILE INSULTS OR
WHATEVER, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

106
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,749
ARE HAVING NONSTOP CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT YOU WHILE YOU ARE OUT

107
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:10,749
THERE LIVING YOUR LIFE.

108
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:11,749
IT'S
KIND OF FLATTERING.

109
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,960
>>AND ALSO KIND OF FRIGHTENING.

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,509
BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU OPEN THE

111
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:24,470
DOOR AND YOU SEE PEOPLE GNAWING
AT EACH OTHER'S BONES AND THINGS

112
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,770
LIKE THAT, IT'S MADNESS.

113
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,900
>>STEVEN WRITES YOU SURE DON'T
DO MUCH FOR THE BLACK CAUSE

114
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,849
WITH YOUR UNLAWFUL, UNGRATEFUL
PARENTING SKILLS.

115
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:38,069
>>THEY HAD TO MAKE IT RACIAL.

116
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,400
IT'S NOT JUST THAT LAVAR BALL,

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,860
THE ACTUAL PERSON WHO WAS
"UNGRATEFUL" TO TRUMP, IT'S NOT

118
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,349
THAT TRUMP DID A GOOD THING,
IT'S THAT YOU ARE BLACK.

119
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,919
>>BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T FIND IT
A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC TO PRESSURE

120
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,569
PEOPLE TO THANK OTHERS?

121
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,259
LIKE,
WHY AREN'T YOU THANKING THE

122
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,259
PRESIDENT?

123
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,530
THANK THE PRESIDENT!

124
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,689
WHAT?

125
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:05,770
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THAT

126
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,039
HAPPENED IN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION?

127
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,039
FIRST OF ALL,

128
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA EVER
EVEN TOOK CREDIT FOR SOMETHING?

129
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,439
HE WOULDN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR
ANYTHING.

130
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,439
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF HE

131
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,289
WAS AS BOASTFUL, OR EVEN A
FRACTION AS BOASTFUL, AS TRUMP

132
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,289
IS?

133
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,289
THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR MINDS.

134
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,789
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF OBAMA WENT TO

135
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,850
A SMALL TOWN IN THE SOUTH WHERE
JOBS INCREASED A LITTLE BIT AND

136
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,169
HE WAS LIKE, YOU GUYS SHOULD ALL
THANK ME, HOW COME YOU AREN'T

137
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:37,159
THANKING ME?

138
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,159
COME ON.

139
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,529
PLEASE,
FOR A SECOND, THINK ABOUT THE

140
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:41,529
SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT.

141
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,020
THIS IS
ABSURD BEHAVIOR BY ANY

142
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,879
PRESIDENT, DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
IDEOLOGY OR YOUR POLITICAL

143
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,669
PARTY, YOU SHOULDN'T BE WASTING
YOUR TIME DEMANDING A THANK YOU

144
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,120
FROM LAVAR BALL.

145
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,210
>>LAST TWO THINGS ON THIS.

146
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,779
LAVAR
BALL AND TRUMP HAD A CLOWN-OFF,

147
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,550
THEY GOT INTO A CIRCUS, WHO IS
GOING TO BE THE BIGGER CLOWN.

148
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,550
IF

149
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,830
I'M LAVAR BALL I'M SUPER HEAVY
MY KID IS BACK, I'LL BE DONE

150
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,130
WITH IT.

151
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,550
HE WAS THE SPOTLIGHT,
HE IS TRUMPIAN IN THAT SENSE.

152
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,169
BUT TRUMP, YOU ARE THE
PRESIDENT.

153
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,240
FOR YOU TO BE LIKE, I

154
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,389
WISH I HADN'T GOTTEN THEM OUT,
NANNY NANNY BOO BOO, YOU ARE

155
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,719
SUCH A CHILD.

156
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:25,449
AND ABOUT HIS
SUPPORTERS, IF I WENT AROUND

157
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:33,099
SAYING WHY HAVEN'T YOU THANKED
OBAMA FOR THIS OR THAT?

158
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,099
WHAT A

159
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,569
SAD, SYCOPHANTIC EXISTENCE.

160
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:40,960
OBAMA IS THE BEST, WHY HAVEN'T

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,041
YOU THANKED HIM, HE'S THE
GREATEST?

162
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,059
YOU ARE SO PATHETIC.

163
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,240
THE ALPHA MALE IS SO GREAT, I
LOVE HIM.

164
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,400
>>HERE IS ANOTHER IRONIC PART,
IT'S LIKE, WE ARE THE PARTY OF

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,110
SMALL GOVERNMENT, WE DON'T WANT
THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE TO MUCH

166
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,110
POWER.

167
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,449
AND THEN SIMULTANEOUSLY,
YOU HAVE TO THANK THE PRESIDENT!

168
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:07,229
>>BOW YOUR HEAD TO THE
GOVERNMENT.

169
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,229
WE AREN'T GOING TO

170
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:10,919
BOW OUR HEAD TO THE LEADER OF
YOUR GOVERNMENT, WE ARE NOT

171
00:08:10,919 --> 00:00:00,000
BETAS LIKE YOU.
