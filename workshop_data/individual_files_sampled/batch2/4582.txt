what about the injunction on immigration will you fight that the California judge you three United families must be put together what am I to say but we believe the family should be together also so there's not a lot to fight how do you guarantee that we believe families have to be together but what we really do is we believe in very strong borders no crime and the Democrats believe in open borders and plenty of crime because that's what you get with the open borders well it's still unclear how the government will comply with the federal judge's order to reunite migrant children already separated from their parents the Trump administration has less than a month to reunite the families in less than two weeks for children under five but in a court filing overnight the Trump administration argues that the order actually means that it can detain immigrant families until their cases are complete meaning families even if they're reunited could spend months or even years years in detention meanwhile the Trump administration claims to know where all the children who have been separated are being held there is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could at the stroke of at keystrokes I sat on the ORR portal with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent admit minutes available mr. secretary suffice it to say portals are not part of the daily existence that's why we have ball joining me now is congressman privilege I Paul and Laura Pena former ice assistant chief counsel thank you both for being here in congresswoman I want to first start with you know what I think is very basic question Congress has oversight responsibilities that are in play here as a member of Congress are you able to get access to information on where these 24 hundreds of my children are no and that terrifies me because we have sent letters we've been on the phone and in fact they told us ice told us told my staffer that they have spreadsheets that they can try to go into and try to pull up the information but they don't actually have a place where it comes together and they're not sure exactly what information is there when I was at the federal prison Joe a couple of weeks ago three weeks ago met with the women they showed me these slips of paper that ice had given them right they had the name of the woman the a number which is the identification number within the immigration system and then supposedly her children that were listed in that on that slip of paper except she said these are not my children oh my god so I am really terrified and I believe I have reason to believe that the administration knows where these children are but they can't match up children with parents right and that there is no system no database no spreadsheet that is allowing them to do that on top of that we are now hearing stories of how parents are being forced to apply to get their children back as if these are children that they are adopting you know taking into foster care they're being required to show means testing they're being required to actually say that they are Christian in some cases okay wait stop right there they're required to show their income correct now assuming these are many destitute people who probably spent their entire life savings just to get to the United States they're being asked to prove that they're Christians they're being asked if they're Christian and on the website of one of the largest agencies that gets hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding it says you must be a Christian to take these children so these women you know some of them are Christians so they're they're answering perfectly fine right but as a member of the United States Congress I am outraged that we are putting these women through this and there should be no religious test for getting your child back there's a fundamental First Amendment violation to test someone's religion or to get their own custody their own child I believe so and we are now getting more information from the agency we're finding out exactly what is the requirement what would have happened if that mother who was asked this question about whether she was Christian or not what would have happened if she had said no right and are we doing this for agencies to require people to be Muslims Jews other religions right that all funding should not be tied to a religious test but even more basic than that come on a mother should be able to get her child back right that is the issue and I have deep concern that we're gonna see a lot of kids who are not reunited with their parents because the parents can't go through these hoops and hurdles and tests just to get their own child back this mother that I'm talking about has a birth certificate so this is not a question of you know she doesn't know they can't prove that she's the parent of this child and it terrifies me and it terrifies these women I'll tell you when I talk to the women in the federal prison right they said to me am I going to get my child back through tears weeping sobbing I haven't seen my child in over a month can I get my child back and you know we've been saying yes but I have deep fear that the administration has no plans and there are some documents released that show that the administration has no plans around how to reunify these kids with their parents a lot of people have been expressing a concern and we talked about this a little bit last week when we were in El Paso that there are these sort of Christian based agencies that are getting involved and they say and try to reunite the families but who also provided option services is there a concern of among members the United States Congress their parents who don't get their children back will find that the child is being put up for adoption well that's a huge concern you know what we need to look at is what are these agencies being told I have no problem with them being able to help us in this situation they're set up to do this on some level but they can't use the same tests that they would use if they're getting private funding this is government funding going to help these kids get back together with their parents they should not be thrown into the foster care system into the adoption system they should be separately processed quickly and that is you know this so-called sham executive order that the President signed did nothing to actually reunite these kids with their parents right but on top of that as you just said allows for indefinite family imprisonment there is no one who thinks that the solution to family separation right his family in prison is indefinite detention as if sort of a Gitmo for for immigrants all right let me go to Laura Payne yet very quickly because it does sound like the administration even if it has the intention to comply with this judge's order is not functionally capable of complying with it the US will not say according to Bloomberg administration officials have been unwilling to say whether they collected information necessary to reunite parents with children before separating them they will not say whether two more children have been taken from their families since Donald Trump signed in order more like a memo June 20th did he said they would stop the practice The Associated Press claims says the Department of HHS is conducting an audit of the migrant children of about 12,000 migrant children in federal care to determine who might be covered by this ruling and as a result the number children separated from their parents could actually be larger than the mm it is obviously not in the business of family reunification it's in the business of arresting people so the fact that ice is the primary organization that's involved in this does that disturb you as a former chief counsel to the orc to that agency you know I would disagree with one point that you made joy the government is functioning functionally capable to do this work and I saw as a nice trial attorney during the 2014 border surge we worked closely with the immigration courts and with HHS at that at that time to make sure that mothers and children who were crossing the border were kept together and what we're seeing now is that they're being forcibly separated in 2014 I appeared in courts in a six-month-old accidentally had to appear in court apart from the mother the judge then was furious about the accidental administrative separation what we are seeing now are children being required to appear in immigration courts alone as we know there's no right to a government appointed attorney for these children so who is representing their interests it's really it's really it's really difficult but the government does have the capability and I've witnessed them being able to turn on a dime when required by judges or by Congress so I'm grateful for the work that the congresswoman is doing and that thousands of advocacy organizations are doing on the ground and showing up today and Laura very quickly if they cable of doing it can you speculate do you have any idea why they would not just do it why aren't they doing it right so you know the I would say the parents and the children have been put on two separate rollercoasters and it takes the the will of the individuals at the top in the White House the secretaries of the agencies to to to make sure that they're expressing the message clearly that they must follow this judicial order and they're not doing it the president is bashing the order requiring reunification of of the families so you have mothers parents who are already being given orders of removal whose asylum claims are being denied and they're being asked do you want to be deported with your child back to the violence that you fled or do you want to leave your child in government custody potentially never being able to say goodbye to your child it's the ultimate Sophie's Choice and that's why I'm speaking out against the administration and its policies well we're gonna have to definitely have you both back conversant well Jack Paul if hearings happen we please let us know if they're gonna ever be nigh agreed on then I will but I just say that Bob Goodlatte chairman of the Judiciary Committee has refused to hold hearings on this he is now you know we are in this position where we have to just try to take over any hearing that we have to talk about these issues as we did with rod Rosen Stein the other I bet they do more hearings on her emails yes they are every day many hours congressman Perriello John Paul Laura pain yeah thank you very much for being here we'll have you both back it up
