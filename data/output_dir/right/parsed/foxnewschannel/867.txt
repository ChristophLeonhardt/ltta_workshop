>>  PAUL MANAFORT ARRIVING AT
THE NORTHERN NECK REGIONAL JAIL.
HE'S THE FIRST CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL
TO BE JAILED AS PART OF SPECIAL
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION.
HERE IS THE EDITOR, THANK YOU
FOR JOINING US, BOYD.
I WANT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR
OUR CONVERSATION.
WE HAVE THE IG REPORT OUT THIS
WEEK, WHOLLY SEPARATED FROM THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, CORRECT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, LIZ.
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFLATING
THE WHOLE THING.
AND THE IG REPORT WAS TO THE
PROCESS FOLLOWED.
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE A HOST
OF THINGS, IT'S IRONIC YOU COME
OUT WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS
THAT SHOW BIAS AND THEN THERE IS
NO BIAS IN THE END, SO SORT OF
AN INTERESTING LANDING.
ELIZABETH: THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
SORT OF GO TO MY NEXT QUESTION.
THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE
ATTACKING MUELLER FOR A FRESH
ROUND OF ATTACKS ON FRIDAY AS IF
HE HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.
BUT THAT BEING SAID, A, THESE
INVESTIGATIONS TAKE TIME, BUT
HE'S STARTING TO FEEL THE HEAT
OR HEAR MORE CRITICISMS,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HEAR FROM
THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY RUDY
GUILIANI.
>> RIGHT, AND SO, I THINK THE
INNING YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT
OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE IS GETTING
ANXIOUS, LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THIS, TO THE END OF THE
INVESTIGATION.
THESE INVESTIGATIONS SPEND TENS
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, THEY
CAST VERY WIDE NETS.
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING YET
THAT HAS REALLY PRODUCED
ANYTHING THAT SHOWS ANYTHING
ABOUT COLLUSION.
THERE'S A LOT IN TERMS OF
INTERFERENCE AND WE'VE KNOWN
THAT THE RUSSIANS TRIED TO
INTERFERE AND THIS IS WHERE I
THINK IT ALL LANDS, LIZ.
WHAT HAPPENS, WE END UP WITH
THIS DISTRUST, THIS DIVISION AND
DIVISIVE RHETORIC AROUND IT,
WHICH IS WHAT THE RUSSIANS WANT,
BY THE WAY.
BUT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT IT
ALSO CREATES DISTRUST IN THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE ONE
THING WE HAVEN'T TALKED ENOUGH
ABOUT IS THIS UNDERMINING PUBLIC
TRUST.
OUR TRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT
INSTITUTIONS HAS NEVER BEEN
LOWER, BUT THAT'S ALSO SPREADING
OVER AND STARTING TO FRAY THE
FABRIC OF SOCIETY.
IT USED TO BE WHEN PEOPLE ASKED
IF YOUR NEIGHBOR TRUSTWORTHY, 68
OR 70% WOULD SAY YES, NOW ONLY
22% SO WE'RE BECOMING MUCH MORE
TRIBAL, MUCH MORE DISTRUSTFUL
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO
UNDERMINE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE
HAVE TO ADDRESS AND WHILE THE IG
REPORT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
THAT'S THE PROCESS PIECE THAT
SHOULD GIVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
TRUST THAT WHATEVER THE MUELLER
INVESTIGATION COMES UP WITH,
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE STOCK
IN IT THAT IT IS TRUSTWORTHY.
ELIZABETH: YOU KNOW, AND I AGREE
WITH YOU.
I WANT TO PLAY A QUICK SOUND
BITE FROM CHRISTOPHER WRAY NOW
LEADING THE FBI.
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN WHAT HE
SAID BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES
ALONG NICELY.
>> WE TAKE THIS REPORT VERY
SERIOUSLY AND WE ACCEPT ITS
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THOUGH TO
NOTE WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
DID NOT FIND.
THIS REPORT DID NOT FIND ANY
EVIDENCE OF POLITICAL BIAS OR
IMPROPER CONSIDERATIONS ACTUALLY
IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION
UNDER REVIEW.
ELIZABETH: YOU CAN ALREADY SEE
SORT OF THE CAMPAIGN TO SAY,
LOOK IT, TRUST US, WE ARE --
THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE TRYING TO
DO WHAT THEY ARE HIRED TO DO.
THAT BEING SAID AS WE CONTINUE
ON THIS INVESTIGATION, IF WE DO
SEE, LET'S SAY A SUBPOENA FOR
THE PRESIDENT, WHERE IS THIS
GOING?
>> YEAH, I THINK THE TRUST
FACTOR IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
BE THE PROBLEM.
REMEMBER WHAT WE HEARD FROM
COMEY, GOING THROUGH HIS PART,
AND EVEN WITH HILLARY CLINTON,
HE SAID THERE'S ALL OF THESE BAD
THINGS, AWFUL THINGS, BUT TRUST
ME, THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
SO I THINK FOR THE IG TO GO
THROUGH THAT SAME PATH, THERE'S
BIAS, THERE'S BIAS, THERE'S
NOTHING TO SEE HERE THAT'S PART
OF THE CHALLENGE.
AND IT'S FASCINATING ON MONDAY,
WHAT VIEWERS SHOULD BE WATCHING
FOR AS HE APPEARS BEFORE THE
SENATE COMMITTEE FIRST, WHAT IT
REALLY MEANS.
IT'S A CHANCE FOR THE IG TO SAY,
YES, THERE IS TRUST AND WE NEED
TO WATCH THIS MOVING FORWARD.
I THINK A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE
SENATE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE
TOUGH QUESTIONS ROLLING INTO
MONDAY.
ELIZABETH: ALL RIGHT, BOYD
