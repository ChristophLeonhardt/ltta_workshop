1
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:14,535
>> Trace: BACK TO FOX'S TOP

2
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:14,836
STORY.

3
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:22,377
THE US AND NORTH KOREA HOPE TO

4
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:26,347
GET PEACE TALKS BACK ON TRACK.

5
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:28,549
LET'S BRING IN JAMES JEFFERIES,

6
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,318
FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY

7
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:33,154
ADVISER TO GEORGE W. BUSH.

8
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:37,625
HE HELPED SUPERVISE THE LAST

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:38,559
NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA.

10
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,428
THANKS FOR JOINING US, SIR.

11
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,829
I KNOW YOU'RE THE EXPERT HERE

12
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,399
BUT THIS FEELS MORE LIKE A

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,701
NEGOTIATION MORE THAN A

14
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:47,135
CANCELLATION.

15
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,636
YOUR TAKE?

16
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:49,837
>> EXACTLY.

17
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:52,940
FIRST OF ALL, THE STRONG

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,742
RHETORIC OUT OF NORTH KOREA WAS

19
00:00:54,742 --> 00:00:57,412
NOT FROM KIM JONG-UN, THE LEADER

20
00:00:57,412 --> 00:01:02,350
BUT ONE OF HIS SUBORDINATES.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,153
IT WAS AIMED AT JOHN BOLTON.

22
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:06,521
THAT'S ONE SIGN.

23
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,023
BUT THE MORE SERIOUS SIGN AS

24
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:10,758
SECRETARY POMPEO POINTED OUT,

25
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:12,693
THE LACK OF RESPONSE FROM THE

26
00:01:12,693 --> 00:01:13,694
NORTH KOREANS ABOUT SETTING UP

27
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:14,962
THE SUMMIT.

28
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:18,399
'S DONE 12 -- HELPED DO 12 FOR

29
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,168
FOUR PRESIDENTS.

30
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:21,869
YOU DON'T INTO THIS WITHOUT

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,937
KNOWING THE DETAILS.

32
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:25,506
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE SENDING A

33
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:27,442
SIGNAL THEY WEREN'T READY.

34
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,644
>> AND THERE SEEMED TO BE A

35
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,879
CHANGE IN TONE, AMBASSADOR, THE

36
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,482
SECOND TIME THAT KIM JONG-UN MET

37
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:36,350
WITH PRESIDENT XI IN CHINA.

38
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,919
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT?

39
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,687
MAYBE YOU CAN GET MORE OUT OF

40
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:41,556
THIS IF YOU PUT MORE PRESSURE ON

41
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:43,024
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

42
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:45,092
>> THAT'S POSSIBLY THE CASE.

43
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:46,561
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS VISIT

44
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,663
TO BEIJING.

45
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,064
BUT WE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT

46
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,732
CHINA WANTS THIS WHOLE CRISIS

47
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,100
WITH NORTH KOREA END.

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,436
IT TIES DOWN MOST OF OUR FORCES

49
00:01:55,436 --> 00:01:58,139
IN THE FAR EAST RATHER THAN

50
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:59,273
FOCUSING ON CHINA AND THE SOUTH

51
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:02,844
CHINA SEA AND MAKES CHINA AN

52
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:05,146
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MAYER.

53
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:07,615
WITHOUT CHINA, ECONOMIC

54
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:08,949
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA WON'T

55
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,851
BE EFFECTIVE.

56
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:11,719
CHINA MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT A

57
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,855
WARMING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE

58
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:16,257
U.S., SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH

59
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,226
KOREA AND MAY HAVE PUT THE

60
00:02:18,226 --> 00:02:20,194
BRAKES ON THEMSELVES VIA THE

61
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:20,628
NORTH KOREANS.

62
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:23,965
>> BEEN A LOT OF COVERAGE TODAY,

63
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,501
AMBASSADOR, ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

64
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,402
TAKING JOURNALISTS TO THE

65
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:30,404
NUCLEAR FACILITY AND BLOWING IT

66
00:02:30,404 --> 00:02:30,671
UP.

67
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,973
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIG

68
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:35,409
DIFFERENCE IN THE DEFINITION OF

69
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,778
DENUCLEARIZATION BETWEEN NORTH

70
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:38,980
KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES.

71
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,248
>> EXACTLY.

72
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:41,415
THE NORTH KOREANS WHO YOU'LL

73
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:43,818
REMEMBER IN THE MEETING WITH

74
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:44,852
PRESIDENT MOON A MONTH AGO

75
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,888
SIGNED UP TO A DOCUMENT THAT

76
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,723
SAYS COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION

77
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:49,957
OF THE PENINSULA.

78
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,926
BUT THEY TAKE THE NORTH KOREANS

79
00:02:51,926 --> 00:02:53,227
DEFINITION THAT WOULD INCLUDE

80
00:02:53,227 --> 00:02:55,530
U.S. FORCES THAT ARE BACKED BY

81
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,732
NUCLEAR FORCES AND VARIOUS OTHER

82
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:58,099
ARGUMENTS.

83
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,468
THE POINT IS, THE U.S. HAS TO

84
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:02,837
INSIST ON DENUCLEARIZATION.

85
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,405
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN TALKING

86
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:06,274
ABOUT THIS, THIS CAN BE A STEP

87
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,542
BY STEP PROCESS.

88
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:09,076
IN FACT, THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO

89
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:11,412
DO IT.

90
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:21,689
THE U.S. HAS TO KEEP UP THEIR

91
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,725
SIDE OR THIS WON'T GO FAR.

92
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,561
>> Trace: WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE

93
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:26,928
RIGHT NOW?

94
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,930
WHAT IS THE TIME FOR A COOLING

95
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,196
OFF?

96
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:30,565
WE KEEP TALKING TO THE NORTH

97
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,632
KOREANS AND THE SOUTH KOREANS

98
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,868
AND THE JAPANESE AND THE CHINESE

99
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:37,104
TO MAKE THIS WHOLE THING COME

100
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:39,640
TOGETHER AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

101
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,344
>> WE KEEP TALKING WITH OUR

102
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:43,678
ALLIES.

103
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:45,279
THERE'S SOME INDICATION THAT

104
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,081
THEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT

105
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:48,249
THE CHANGE.

106
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,650
THERE'S A CHANCE TO MAKE

107
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,017
PROGRESS.

108
00:03:50,017 --> 00:03:51,319
KIM JONG-UN WANTS THIS OR HE

109
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,721
WOULDN'T HAVE RELEASED THE

110
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,273
PRISONERS

111
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,057
PRISONER

112
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:56,424
PRISONERS.

113
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:57,224
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO HAVE

114
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:57,625
PULLED OUT.

115
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,492
BUT THE PRESIDENT KEPT THE DOOR

116
00:03:58,492 --> 00:03:58,859
OPEN.

117
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,695
THAT'S A VERY SMART WAY TO GO

118
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:01,862
FORWARD AT THIS POINT.

119
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:04,098
I THINK WE SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE

120
00:04:04,098 --> 00:00:00,000
SEEING WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
