FOR NOW HE REMAINS AHEAD OUTSIDE OF THE MARGIN THAT WOULD TRIGGER A RECOUNT. CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND WHAT THEY HAVE BESTOWED ON ME. I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TO THANK TODAY. BEHIND ME RIGHT HERE, MY SON JOSHUA, HIS FIANCE JOSHUA, HIS FIANCÃ‰ CHELSEA. THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED NEXT APRIL. MY GIRLFRIEND MELANIE. I WANT TO THANK GOD. MORE IMPORTANTLY, MY MOM AND DAD WERE AREN'T ABLE TO BE HERE WITH US THIS EVENING. THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS THAT WORKED THE CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU ALL VERY, VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE. THE PHONE BANKING, THE DOOR KNOCKING, ALL OF IT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP. MR. PRESIDENT COMING TO TOWN. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TAKE THE TIME TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT PENCE FOR COMING. AND THE BIG SHOES THAT I'LL BE FILLING. I WOULDN'T HAVE GOT THROUGH A LOT WITHOUT HIM THROUGH THIS PROCESS. CONGRESSMAN PAT TEABERRY. THANK CHAIRMAN STEVE WHO HAS BEEN A GREAT ASSET TO ME AND HAS CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU. THERE'S MANY OTHERS. I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON AND ON. BUT TONIGHT I'M GOING TO PROMISE TO YOU THAT I'M GOING TO WORK RELENTLESSLY THIS 12TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. AMERICA IS ON THE RIGHT PATH AND WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING THAT WAY. IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK. OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO KEEP AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, SO THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE COME BACK HERE IN NOVEMBER GET READY. WE'VE GOT TO COME BACK HERE IN NOVEMBER. I HAVE EARNED YOUR VOTE FOR A SECOND TIME. DANNY O'CONNOR RAN A HARD RACE. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CAMPAIGNING AGAINST HIM AGAIN THIS FALL. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. YOU CAN SEE THE ENTHUSIASM THERE. IT APPEARS IT HAS BEEN A SQUEAKER OF A WIN. STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL. WE'RE TOLD THERE'S SOME PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT NEED TO COME IN. HE'S CLAIMING VICTORY, THOUGH. HEY, ED. SHANNON, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THE RNC HAS JUST PUT OUT A STATEMENT BASICALLY DECLARING VICTORY. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE SAYING, THIS IS PROOF THAT THE SO-CALLED BLUE WAVE IS JUST A RIPPLE. THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS COUNTED AND THEY'VE GOT ALL THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS. JUST SAW, IS WINNING BY 1,754 VOTES. THAT IS A WIDER MARGIN THAN WE HAD SEEN JUST AN HOUR OR SO AGO. AT ONE POINT THESE TWO CANDIDATES, DANNY O'CONNOR, THE DEMOCRAT, AND TROY BALDERSON THE REPUBLICAN, WERE SEPARATED BY 155 VOTES. SO A 1754-VOTE LEAD IS SORT OF MASSIVE FOR BALDERSON RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW CLOSE THIS RACE IS. THE GREEN PARTY GOT 1,127 VOTES. SO NOT ENOUGH TO TIP THE BALLOTS, BUT WITHOUT THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATES AND THOSE VOTES ON THE LEFT, THE DEMOCRAT CANDIDATE O'CONNOR WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN CLOSER. SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME FRUSTRATION ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AS WELL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOCIALISTS AND OTHERS PULLING THE PARTY TO THE LEFT. THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE ENDED UP MAKING THIS KIND OF MORE INTERESTING. WITHOUT THE GREEN PARTY CANDIDATE, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE MANDATORY RECOUNT MARGIN, WHICH IS .5. IF IT'S INSIDE THE MARGIN, THE STATE PAYS FOR IT. BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, THE LOSER WOULD HAVE TO PAY. UNLESS IT TURNS OUT THEY WIN, THEN THEIR MONEY IS REFUNDED. BY OUR CALCULATION, THAT PUTS BALDERSON THE REPUBLICAN UP BY .9 PERCENTAGE POINTS. SO IT WOULD BE A BIGGER MARGIN THAN THE SMALLER .5 PERCENTAGE BEEN IN HERE, THIS LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHIN THE .5 PERCENTAGE NEEDING A RECOUNT. RIGHT NOW, BARRING WHATEVER
