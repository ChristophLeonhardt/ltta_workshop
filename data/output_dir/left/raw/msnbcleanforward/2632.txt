00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,861
QUESTION OF COMPETENCY. TO ME, ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL

00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,266
LIKE THIS ONE IS LEAVING A MARK ON HIM AS OPPOSED TO OTHER

00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,367
ON HIM AS OPPOSED TO OTHER STORIES IS THAT IT’S STARTING

00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:13,470
THE LOOK INCOMPETENT. LISTEN.

>> I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE. NO.

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,246
NO. >> THIS IS NOT A POLICY THAT

00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,785
COUNTRY. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT MY

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,185
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT MY COMPASSION.

18
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,287
COMPASSION. >> DOESN’T MEAN YOU HAVE TO

00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:53,911
AT WHAT POINT DOES THIS BECOME INCOMPETENTSY?

35
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,414
INCOMPETENTSY? THE REASON I ASK, INCOMPETENTSY

36
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,215
THE REASON I ASK, INCOMPETENTSY WAS THE FINAL STRAW FOR THE BUSH

37
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,683
WAS THE FINAL STRAW FOR THE BUSH YEARS IN ’06.

38
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,885
YEARS IN ’06. KATRINA WAS THE INCOMPETENTSY

39
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,587
KATRINA WAS THE INCOMPETENTSY STRAW THAT BROKE THE BACK.

40
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,422
STRAW THAT BROKE THE BACK. >> ARE THEY REALLY CLEANING IT

00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:05,689
>> ARE THEY REALLY CLEANING IT UP?

42
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,924
UP? HE DID AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

43
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,159
HE DID AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY

44
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:09,426
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY SERIOUSLY STEPPED BACK AND SAID

45
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:10,794
SERIOUSLY STEPPED BACK AND SAID WHAT LEGAL CHANGE DOES WE NEED,

46
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,830
WHAT LEGAL CHANGE DOES WE NEED, WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET IN COURT?

47
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,132
WHAT DO WE NEED TO GET IN COURT? WHAT BUREAUCRATSIC CHAINS DO WE

48
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,568
WHAT BUREAUCRATSIC CHAINS DO WE NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO HAVE A

49
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,404
NEED TO MAKE IN ORDER TO HAVE A LEGAL SOLUTION TO THIS

50
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,005
LEGAL SOLUTION TO THIS IMMIGRATION PROGRAM.

51
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,640
IMMIGRATION PROGRAM. >> YOU ARE HELPING TO WRITE THE

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,140
>> YOU ARE HELPING TO WRITE THE LEGISLATION NOW.

LEGISLATION NOW. >> KATRINA WAS HORRIBLE.

54
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,710
>> KATRINA WAS HORRIBLE. THEY FIRED PEOPLE.

55
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:27,711
THEY FIRED PEOPLE. THEY HAD SERIOUS PEOPLE SUDDENLY

56
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:28,946
THEY HAD SERIOUS PEOPLE SUDDENLY TAKE CHARGE.

57
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,114
TAKE CHARGE. THEY PUT MONEY INTO NORRIS.

58
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:31,849
THEY PUT MONEY INTO NORRIS. THEY HAD A POLICY.

59
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,250
THEY HAD A POLICY. THAT’S TRUE AFTER OTHER

60
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:33,717
THAT’S TRUE AFTER OTHER SCREWUPS.

61
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:34,752
SCREWUPS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY ARE AT

62
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:35,920
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THEY ARE AT ALL SERIOUS ABOUT THAT.

63
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,421
ALL SERIOUS ABOUT THAT. IT IS GOING TO LEAVE A MARK

64
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,056
IT IS GOING TO LEAVE A MARK BECAUSE IT HAS REAL EFFECTS.

65
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,991
BECAUSE IT HAS REAL EFFECTS. SOMEONE COMPARED THE OTHER NIGHT

66
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,260
SOMEONE COMPARED THE OTHER NIGHT IT WITH TRUMP IS ALWAYS GOOD AT

67
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,062
IT WITH TRUMP IS ALWAYS GOOD AT THESE THINGS, THE DEMAGOGUES AND

68
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,364
THESE THINGS, THE DEMAGOGUES AND THE NFL PLAYERS TAKING A KNEE.

69
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,366
THE NFL PLAYERS TAKING A KNEE. THAT’S SYMBOLISM.

70
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,335
THAT’S SYMBOLISM. THE NFL PLAYERS DIDN’T SUFFER

71
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,670
THE NFL PLAYERS DIDN’T SUFFER BECAUSE TRUMP ATTACKED THEM.

72
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,571
BECAUSE TRUMP ATTACKED THEM. THE SUFFERING CONTINUES.

73
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,172
THE SUFFERING CONTINUES. >> THAT’S THE CRITICAL POINT.

74
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:58,242
>> THAT’S THE CRITICAL POINT. BECAUSE IT’S NOT SIMPLY THE

75
00:01:58,286 --> 00:01:59,076
BECAUSE IT’S NOT SIMPLY THE INCOMPETENCE.

76
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:01,245
INCOMPETENCE. INCOMPETENCE IS A PROBLEM FOR

77
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:02,580
INCOMPETENCE IS A PROBLEM FOR PRESIDENTS WHEN THEY ARE 500

78
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,514
PRESIDENTS WHEN THEY ARE 500 PLUS DAYS INTO THEIR TERMS.

79
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,284
PLUS DAYS INTO THEIR TERMS. IT IS THE LACK OF COMPASSION.

80
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,885
IT IS THE LACK OF COMPASSION. THAT’S WHAT THE SEEMING

81
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:08,586
THAT’S WHAT THE SEEMING INDIFFERENCE, WHETHER IT WAS

82
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,356
INDIFFERENCE, WHETHER IT WAS FAIR OR NOT, OF PRESIDENT BUSH

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,191
FAIR OR NOT, OF PRESIDENT BUSH DURING KA A.

84
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,760
DURING KA A. >> RIGHT.

CARING ABOUT AN ACT OF GOD OF THIS IS NOT AN ACT OF GOD.

88
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,300
THIS IS NOT AN ACT OF GOD. THIS IS AN ACT OF TRUMP.

89
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,068
THIS IS AN ACT OF TRUMP. AND HE AND HIS POLICY NO MATTER

90
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:26,504
AND HE AND HIS POLICY NO MATTER WHEN THEY SAY IT’S NOT -- AND

WHEN THEY SAY IT’S NOT -- AND THE LACK OF APPARENT CARING.

92
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,074
THE LACK OF APPARENT CARING. IT’S NOT THAT I DON’T KNOW HOW

93
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,209
IT’S NOT THAT I DON’T KNOW HOW TO RUN THIS GOVERNMENT.

94
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,477
TO RUN THIS GOVERNMENT. IT’S THAT WE ARE HEARING THE

95
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,112
IT’S THAT WE ARE HEARING THE CRIES OF CRYING CHILDREN.

96
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,613
CRIES OF CRYING CHILDREN. >> I HAVE GOT PLAY THE MAGAZINE
