Sneakerhead: 
a sneaker aficionado
who can be found buying, 
swapping or reselling sneakers
online, in parking lots
or at conventions.
And now, at swanky stores
in SoHo like Stadium Goods.
“I have 103 pairs of sneakers.
It’s a fairly consistent
investment and occupation.
It’s an obsession.
It’s my hobby.
But, I can easily
turn value back
by selling away some of it.
I collect comics too 
and it's similar.”
Sneaker swapping and reselling
has been popular since the 1990s.
But in the past couple
of years, dedicated online
and brick-and-mortar stores
that authenticate and resell
sneakers have popped up
to cash in on the trend.
“I’m looking for
like really cool Jordan 1s.
And I got lucky because they
have several pairs.”
Raena Anaïs is a stylist for rapper J. Cole.
She was shopping
for something
he could wear for
upcoming shows.
“The people who would, like,
catch an exclusive drop,
they would be the ones
reselling them on eBay
and then you had to
kind of bite the bullet
and pay the insane
markup for the resale
without even really
knowing: Are they real?
Have they been worn?
Like, I think this is
a lot more comfortable.”
At this store,
previously purchased,
but unworn sneakers are
sold on consignment.
The house gets 20 percent.
The decades-old 
underground sneaker trade
has truly gone pro.
Some might even say “gentrified.”
“When things are sold out,
a lot of those shoes come here.
We then sell them again
at a higher price.
This shoe right now is 
available on Amazon.
It’s also for sale into
China on Tmall,
through our partnership with Alibaba.”
Coveted, hard-to-find models
can cost anywhere from hundreds
of dollars to tens of thousands.
“$9,999? I think a number 
fell off from that shoe. ”
Like these limited edition replicas
of Nike Air Max from 
"Back to the Future II"
“$29,950, that’s a pretty 
crazy price for a shoe.
But people,
there are people that will come
in and buy those shoes.”
Hand-to-hand trading
of these products,
that stuff still exists.
But we’re really
focused on creating
a premium retail
experience to elicit
that trust, which is something
that’s very new to that market.”
Major players in the
luxury world like LVMH
take a note of the potential
and started investing
in businesses like this one.
“It’s really hitting its stride.
We think that honestly,
it’s only just beginning.”
