thing one tonight scott pruett the Mary Lou Retton of the swamp Olympics has travel expenses which are just legendary thanks in part his decision to fly first-class to avoid those unpleasant interactions that can sometimes happen in coach issues that arise and travel and there have been instances unfortunately during my time as administrator as I've flown and spent time of interaction that's not been the best the official reason he gave for flying first-class everywhere is the same reason he has for a 24-hour security detail and total security costs approaching three million dollars according to an EPA official costs that include a twenty member full-time detail that is more than three times the size of his predecessors the official justification for that enormous security presence what the EPA spokesman calls an unprecedented number of threats against Scott Pruett now no one absolutely no one would begrudge protecting a federal cabinet member in the face of an alarming spike of credible threats but is that the case that's thing too in 60 seconds so thanks to a FOIA request by the New York Times we now know just how many threats have been made to the EPA under Donald Trump and Scott Pruett there's a slight uptick compared the last two years of the Obama administration though the Department of Homeland Security as recently as February wrote that quote EPA intelligence has not identified any specific credible direct threat to the EPA Administrator now some of the instances were pretty scary people writing aggressive and threatening postcards and emails and some of the threat investigations are decidedly less worrisome this one for instance a Newsweek magazine cover taped to inside of elevator of an EPA building quote a mustache which appears to be hand drawn appears in the face of administrator Pruitt now the Newsweek cover was apparently this one from early this year we don't know exactly what it looked like with a mustache drawn on it but our all in artist's rendering shows the threat might have looked something like this that case was recommended by foreclosure by the case agents special agent I'm quoting now a review of the printout yielded the printout did not contain any threatening information well said case agent special agent well said hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
