74
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,660
what they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what they really want</font>

75
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,580
the next president to do is to unify the

country they want to heal the country

77
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I wonder how you're going to be</font>

78
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,100
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that when you still have this</font>

79
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,980
issue of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> being afraid that</font>

80
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,450
something is about to happen there's

81
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,890
nothing that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't trust you the</font>

82
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,330
other side is going to say that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

83
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be the burden of the winning</font>

84
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,299
party and we think we're going to win to

85
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:00,769
heal the country and if we win that's

86
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:02,030
the obligation on our shoulders

87
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,890
governing and I think the obligation on

88
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the GOP shoulders is to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,799
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just a</font>

90
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,220
party of no but i but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font>

91
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,840
so many Republicans having offered

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,780
support to Hillary's candidacy we will

93
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,840
start with an ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know get on</font>

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on-ramp toward bringing people</font>

95
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,269
together this idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more voters</font>

96
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,769
distrusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trusting how does that</font>

97
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually affect what you do on the</font>

98
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,090
campaign trail and how you do your your

99
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,859
job as a politician when you if you

100
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:31,940
eventually get chance to govern I'm

101
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,350
gonna tell you worry I have I worried

102
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,940
that in post citizen Jedi that that will

103
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,650
always be the case I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

104
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,870
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Hillary and I deeply want to</font>

105
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,220
reform it about the way campaigns are

106
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,799
financed that because the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive</font>

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw away to money is groups that you</font>

108
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,890
know don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to disclose who they are</font>

109
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,350
they make it super negative and so I'm

110
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,510
worried in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future whether there will</font>

111
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,310
ever be a presidential election where

112
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,470
somebody will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a net positive and</font>

113
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,090
yet I think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be an</font>

114
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to make some good things</font>

115
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,270
happen

116
00:03:58,270 --> 00:00:00,000
you
