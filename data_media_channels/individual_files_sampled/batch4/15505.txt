we don't normally cover sports here at the rebel but when a broadcasting giant is put in the penalty box for being oh I don't know too colorful too entertaining too good at his job well it's time to drop the gloves so what's missing from this year's version of the Stanley Cup Playoffs well for the first time in like forever sports casting legend - Bob Cole will not be calling any playoff games it is a mystery equal parts baffling and bizarre it is akin to leaving Gretzky on the bench during a must-win shootout and we all know how well that worked out and nagging OH back in 98 but as Michael treecko's reveals in a Toronto Sun story the great one of the broadcasting booth Bob Cole has been sent to the showers and colas gobsmacked by the decision as are presumably millions of hockey fans said Cole quote it's difficult to live with the fact that I'm not working I surely will miss not working the playoffs that's the best way I can say it end quote the question as always is why is Cole being kicked to the curb well the Rodgers assassin responsible for this decision Scott Moore is really too gutless to give a real reason rather Moore uses the weasel words of a greaseball politician quote Bob Cole is without doubt one of the greatest broadcasters in hockey history and an icon in Canadian television he is revered across the country and loved by legions of hockey fans around the world his career which has spanned more than 50 years is one to be celebrated we made a difficult decision not to include him in our playoff plans end quote now by Moores own words Cole is one of the greatest and he's an icon and he's loved by legions of hockey fans so of course Rogers is Moth calling him sorry more but that just does not compute so here's the real deal folks the axing of coal represents the changing of the guard in the NHL and other professional sports leagues and their broadcasting partners once upon a time another sports casting legend dick Beto said that sports was the toy department of life sure broadcasters say things like do or die or it's life and death but it's not really it's all just fun and games compared to real life that is what Pro Sports has morphed into a multi-billion dollar industry the money has never been bigger and with big money come the big conglomerates run by those guys in the Armani suits they don't want color and charisma and personality oh no they don't want a broadcaster to be bigger than the product on the ice or the field they don't want sports casters using trademark phrases such as Bob Cole's Oh baby for sure and everything's happening and how about that nope in an industry that is now driven by analytics the suits would much rather have automotives do play-by-play of hockey games with the same kind of passion the guy at the community center embraces when he's calling out bingo numbers so what does Rogers give us now instead oh well how about jim Hughson he's currently calling the mark he Leafs Bruins series Hewson is so robotic he makes a toaster come across as mr. personality check it out he Innocents the pass Kunitz along the boards and that her he steals it semen alone okay full disclosure that was jim Hughson calling video game play-by-play but did you notice how he pronounced saman as semen yikes thank god Jimbo didn't mispronounce Kunitz think about it but I chose this clip because it's within the bias fear of video games where Houston is perhaps most at home it's fake unreal devoid of passion just like mr. Roboto himself as for the always passionate Bob Cole at 81 he is still state-of-the-art when it comes to calling a hockey game but he's been benched at least for now we still have Don Cherry pontificating but you know after coaches corner wraps for good what do we have then we have nothing all the passion will have been successfully purged from the broadcast booth just the way Rogers likes it for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks you may have heard the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
