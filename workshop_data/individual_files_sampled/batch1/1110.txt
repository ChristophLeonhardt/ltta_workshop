in the 2008 Hollywood fictional thriller gravity Sandra Bullock plays an American astronaut stranded in space in one of the final scenes she has seen catching a ride back to earth in the Chinese space station ting gong one that then breaks up into fiery pieces as it hurtles towards planet Earth TNN gong one space station is real and it really did crash into Earth it was launched in 2011 and it was China's first space station it served as a laboratory base until controllers lost contact with it two years ago ever since it's been a giant piece of space debris about the size of a school bus and as this animation shows it's been slowly pulled into Earth by gravitational force before a final uncontrolled reentry while dramatic it's not the first such man-made space object to crash back to earth unplanned the largest was a 135 tonne Russian space station Mir that broke apart and streaked earth in 2001 the most spectacular perhaps this unmanned cargo spacecraft that broke apart in the streaks of fire and debris is a crashed into the Pacific Ocean in 2008 showing that what goes up even in space often comes down space is increasingly becoming a very busy place this is a computer-generated model time-lapse from 1960 until today showing all of the man-made objects that are circling around Earth in space right now all of the blue dots represent the more than 1,600 satellites that are currently in space all of the yellow dots represent debris scientists estimate there is more than half a million pieces of debris in space about 20,000 of which that are big enough to be tracked space debris ranges from things as you know as big as a rocket to as too small fragmentation debris if it's human-made and we put it in space then it's debris every day is something's coming we typically see almost a daily reentry of one of the objects China hoping none of their future spacecraft end up in movies and have the same fate Gables Ando al Jazeera Arlington Virginia
