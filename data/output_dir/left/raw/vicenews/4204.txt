1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,940
— I’ve never seen water this high
on the embankment.

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,100
I’ve never seen water stand there before.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,240
At the edge of the timberline out there,

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,940
we probably have right now about five feet of water.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,660
And as you get deeper into the reservoir,

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,260
the total water depth right now
is somewhere around 30 feet deep.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,760
— And that’s usually empty?

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,740
— And that’s usually empty.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,140
— When Harvey was done flooding Houston,

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,500
Richard Long had to do something inconceivable:

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,040
he had to flood it again.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,320
— If that hurricane that’s out in the Atlantic

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,340
right now decided to come in here,

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,140
and we weren’t making these releases to
get rid of this water out of the reservoir,

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,989
the flooding upstream and the flooding downstream

16
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,020
would be on an extremely larger proportion
than what we have right now.

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,000
— And uncontrolled.

18
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,300
— And uncontrolled, that’s exactly right.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,240
— Long manages Houston’s two reservoirs,

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,000
which protect around 1.4 million people from flooding.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,420
Normally, they’re dry.

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,060
They look like urban parks.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,780
But when it rains, they’re designed to hold excess water

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,700
until it can be safely funneled into Houston’s bayous,

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,980
which then drain into the Gulf.

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,040
After Harvey,

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,260
the reservoirs were so close to capacity
that Long had to open them up,

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,140
releasing more than 10,000 cubic feet
of water per second onto city streets.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,780
— Unfortunately, some of our releases are large enough

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,460
where it’s going to be in some
subdivisions and in some homes.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,280
— Does it weigh on you at any point to know
that the decisions you have to make,

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,440
even if they’re the right ones,

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,800
are ones that affect a lot of people?

34
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,979
— Oh, definitely.

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,000
I have friends and neighbors who
are being impacted by these floods.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,920
— You’re the first one we rescued out of here.

37
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,180
— Right. For 40 years.

38
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,760
I lived here in this area for 40 years.

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,560
There’s a U.S. flag there—

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,040
that’s my mailbox.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
You can get in here.

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh my God.

43
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,700
Oh my… goodness.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,360
Oh my goodness.

45
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,180
— Dan Cho, a retired professor who lives
along Buffalo Bayou in southwest Houston,

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,340
thought he’d made it through Harvey unscathed.

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,020
— So we put all the chairs up here like this.

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,220
Then, the rain stops and the sun comes out, so…

49
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,400
— And the water went away?

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,780
— Yeah.

51
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,379
The sun comes up, so, “Ha ha, it’s good!”

52
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,390
“Let’s go have a good night’s sleep.”

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,220
And Wednesday morning, I discovered this.

54
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,430
That makes me so…

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,080
I dunno, I can’t explain it.

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,540
So… disappointed.

57
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,120
— Mr. Cho stopped paying for
flood insurance for almost a decade ago

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,520
because, as he puts it, his home doesn’t flood.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
It’s never taken in water before.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,920
It’s not in a flood zone.

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,560
It’s even perched more than a foot
off the ground just to be safe.

62
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,640
— I built it like that.

63
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,780
— Oh, you built it yourself?

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,600
— Yeah.

65
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,240
— So you built this house on your hands?

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,320
— Right.

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,040
These are my memories in here.

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,940
My memories are gone.

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,460
— Cho’s home is one of hundreds in Houston
that were flooded after the storm.

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,460
— Do you wish that someone had told you

71
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,870
that the place where you built your home

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,220
was in a spot that would be sacrificed
if there was a huge flood?

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,320
— Yeah.

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,280
That’s only good news I can think about it, you know?

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,459
If I can sacrifice myself and save
a lot of other thousands,

76
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,560
thousands of people, maybe it’s worth it.

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,340
After all, you know, God loaned it to me while I’m here.

78
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,720
And I’m returning it.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,260
— Many of the homes won’t be dry
for at least another week

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,160
because water is still spewing out of the reservoirs

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,880
faster than Houston’s flood infrastructure can handle.

82
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,420
— It was not designed for the amount of rain

83
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,180
that we received here in this region
during Hurricane Harvey.

84
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,180
— Colonel Paul Owen is in charge of the
Southwest Division of the Army Corps of Engineers,

85
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,860
which controls all of Houston’s flood infrastructure.

86
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,140
— This structure was built in 1940.

87
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,779
So imagine you buy a car in 1940.

88
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,578
You are running it 100 miles an hour—

89
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,400
it’s really only designed to go,
like, 50 or 60 miles an hour—

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
but that’s the 1940 power that you’re trying

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
to run at 100 miles per hour in 2017.

92
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,540
— When you look at a storm like Hurricane Harvey,

93
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,540
do you think, this is a once-in-a-thousand year storm,

94
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,880
or is this the new normal that we need to prepare for?

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,560
— Well, it’s very clear to me that storms
are increasing in intensity and frequency,

96
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,880
and I think the big lesson learned is,

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,600
you know, our infrastructure is old and
the conditions have changed dramatically.

98
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,700
And maybe it’s time to buy a new car.

99
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,900
— The system wasn’t built to withstand
a storm like Harvey,

100
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,180
which dumped over 50 inches
of rain on parts of the city—

101
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,340
roughly three times more water
than the record rainfall last year.

102
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,320
But it also wasn’t built to protect a city
that looks like Houston does today,

103
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,280
where much smaller storms cause serious problems.

104
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,080
— So you see that floodplain?

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,000
— Completely developed.

106
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,640
— It’s something Sam Brody,
an urban researcher at Texas A&M,

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,680
has been warning about for years.

108
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,660
— It doesn’t have to be a biblical deluge
to flood Houston.

109
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,880
— Over the past couple of decades,

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,920
developers in Houston have taken advantage,
of some of the lax regulations in the country,

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,580
putting buildings, parking lots, and homes
where Brody says they don’t belong—

112
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,720
over wetlands, along bayous,

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,420
and even in areas the Army Corps
technically considers parts of the reservoir.

114
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,160
It’s been good for business:

115
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,200
Houston’s population has grown by
almost 30 percent over that period.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,120
But it’s also drastically changed
the city’s drainage patterns—

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,040
a lot of people now live in
flood-prone areas without knowing it.

118
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,840
— As we alter these landscapes
and put more people in harm’s way,

119
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,340
it’s going to be more and more of a problem

120
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,760
— How many people ideally
would not live where they live?

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,580
— That I don’t know.

122
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Thousands.

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,540
Tens of thousands.

124
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,060
I don’t think you can point the blame
to one agency or individual.

125
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,060
It’s a collection of factors working together.

126
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,180
But there’s active information distortion
and suppression.

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,520
— What do you mean?

128
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
— That the real estate community—

129
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,000
for all the wrong reasons, but understandably—

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,540
they don’t want people to know the risk
because it could affect the sale price.

131
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,520
We need to go beyond recovery

132
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,580
and start fundamentally changing
the way we’re dealing with these problems,

133
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,260
and move away from recovery, 
more towards protection.

134
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,780
If we’re gonna make a fundamental change

135
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,710
in the way we’re conceiving and acting upon flood risk,

136
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,360
now is the time.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,540
— It’s unclear when Houston will be able to
spend any money on preventative measures.

138
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,460
Yesterday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott
suggested the recovery alone

139
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,840
could cost as much as $180 billion statewide.

140
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,460
Meanwhile, a group of residents who were
flooded when the city opened its reservoirs

141
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,080
has already filed a class action lawsuit
for damage caused to their homes.

142
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,780
Mr. Cho, who turns 75 this year,

143
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,410
hasn’t gotten that far.

144
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,600
— What do you think?

145
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,620
— It’s terrible.

146
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,520
I’ve gotta figure out some way
to minimize loss, maximize recovery,

147
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,420
so I can…

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,740
— How are you going to do that?

149
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,000
If you don’t have insurance?

150
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,640
— Good question.

151
00:07:45,640 --> 00:00:00,000
A very, very, very, very good question.
