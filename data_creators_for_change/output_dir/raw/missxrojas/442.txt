1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
and so it came to pass that I had to say

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,500
more goodbyes on the penultimate night

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,899
of vassar college senior week we burnt

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,929
things together at midnight old essays

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,929
went on the fire drafts of theses emails

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,650
to professors and strangely a sofa fire

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,170
is transfixing and we are obsessed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,150
it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> japanese myths of the kojiki</font>

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,429

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,690
medieval turn for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the burning of the</font>

bones of slaughtered animals the<font color="#CCCCCC"> galax</font>

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:38,309
associated burning with cleansing and I

16
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:40,079
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a very large extent that's what</font>

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,030
we were all trying to do that night to

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,750
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of physical</font>

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,629
representation of the ridding of self

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,640
from anxiety and the stress that can

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,590
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consume you at the end of the</font>

22
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">year in every conversation I had that</font>

23
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,780
night someone would mention the rapture

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that had supposedly happened earlier</font>

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,500
that week somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back of my</font>

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind I can help but think that this very</font>

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
peak in human and earthly act of the

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">bonfire wasn't in some way Helena the</font>

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,130
floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> was literally on fire we are so</font>

30
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,920
intent on destroying things we are so

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,290
obsessed with it no matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does</font>

32
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,270
to the air around<font color="#CCCCCC"> us no matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

33
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,950
does to the air we breathe we just get

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,390
into these states of mind sometimes

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,770
where it's like we just want to destroy

36
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,689
everything we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want it to end we</font>

37
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,119
just want to turn into ash time and time

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,729
again we just aim for this really and

39
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,790
truly impossible finality and without

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,380
you know wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound to preaching</font>

41
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,880
pretentious about it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really showed me how impossible</font>

43
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,939
that was even just looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the things</font>

44
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,979
that we were putting on the spire<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

45
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,840
trees and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paper and the plastic and</font>

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,700
rubber and sofas that all connected

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,140
their materials are connected they come

48
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,460
from the same place<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go into the</font>

49
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,799
same place they won't stop there not to

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,780
be the etymology nerd or and thing but

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,479
rapture itself also means ecstasy and I

52
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't help but think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was something</font>

53
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,689
really ecstatic about the way in which

54
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,850
we went about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as there for a couple</font>

55
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,409
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours we allowed ourselves to</font>

56
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,210
entertain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the illusion that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were in</font>

57
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,149
control of the end of things whereas in

58
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,159
reality we were kind of facing the

59
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,600
complete opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a lack of</font>

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,280
control in the end of things whether or

61
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,568
not we were looking forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next</font>

62
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,239
stage which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everyone was in</font>

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,650
attempting to make it so

64
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,819
we have the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make something</font>

65
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,560
cease to exist we weren't factually

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,810
enacting an age-old ritual that night in

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire the tree bound is a quiet</font>

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,769
reminder of our ability we play the role

69
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,079
of the destroyer only to mask a physical

70
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,870
instability our anxiety incidentally by

71
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,159
burning to rid ourselves from that

72
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,019
anxiety I think we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

73
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,239
making that anxiety about our physical

74
00:02:33,239 --> 00:00:00,000
instability more obvious to everyone
