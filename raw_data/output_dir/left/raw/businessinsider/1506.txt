1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
one thing that drives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy is a what</font>

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">I call deficit fetishism nobody would</font>

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,019
look at a corporation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say look at</font>

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,750
this firm look at the debt it as anybody

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,670
looking at a firm would say what are the

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,160
Asik's what are the liabilities what's

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,359
the net worth you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at at</font>

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,310
liabilities only<font color="#CCCCCC"> functions with assets</font>

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,680
but somehow when you come to government

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
you don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so you get worried</font>

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,809
if the government increases its dad even

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,899
if it's to invest in infrastructure and

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,420
people and technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes the</font>

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,489
economy stronger people get worried

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debt my answer is no if if</font>

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,460
you've increased the liability but

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,710
you've increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in assets that have</font>

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,260
a high return we can borrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> at minus at</font>

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,270
at close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero now and with inflation</font>

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two percentage so like minus two real</font>

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,070
percent minus one real percent you can

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,830
borrow a minus percent you get a twenty

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,840
thirty percent real return it's foolish

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,760
not to make those investments so that

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,170
kind of is this a deficit fetishism

26
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,030
especially coming out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wall street</font>

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,490
that is supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about finance</font>

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,280
and so when I see people who claim to be

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,950
financial experts who clearly don't

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:00:00,000
understand economics that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes me crazy</font>
