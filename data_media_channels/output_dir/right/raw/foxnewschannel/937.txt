14
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,454
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, I DON'T

THIS IS ABOUT THE LAST 25 YEARS,

33

YEAR.

38
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:12,757

THOSE ARE NOT PROBLEMS CREATED

44
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,165
BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

45
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,368
BUT GUESS WAS TRYING TO SOLVE

I ALSO THINK HE HAS EFFECTIVELY

55
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,149
MANAGED THE SUMMIT.

56
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,151
IT SPARKED A FLURRY OF

57
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:40,718
DIPLOMATIC ENGAGEMENT.

58
00:01:40,718 --> 00:01:42,287

63
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,961
SAID THEY ARE COMING TO THE

64
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:50,528
STATES.

65
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:51,763

MEETINGS IN PREPARATION FOR

67
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:53,164
THAT.

68
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:55,566
IT REINFORCES THE BAN OF TESTING

69
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:58,336
OF NUCLEAR MISSILES AND ICBMs.

70
00:01:58,336 --> 00:01:59,070
I THINK THAT'S EXTRAORDINARILY

71
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,537
IMPORTANT.

00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:02,106
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOLLOW-ON

74
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:06,144
IN WASHINGTON, D.C., SO WE CAN

75
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:06,945
SUPPORT THE ENGAGEMENT.

76
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,146
>> Sean: THE PRESIDENT SAID NO

77
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,782
DEAL UNLESS IT'S COMPLETE,

78
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:11,583
VERIFIABLE AND IRREVERSIBLE.

79
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,750
>> IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE

80
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,755
OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE ALSO BEING

81
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:19,758
RESOLVED OF OUR 7,000 MIAS.

82
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,458
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ISSUE

83
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,360
YOU CHOOSE --

84
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,962
>> Sean: THAT'S AN ISSUE.

85
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:25,130
>> 7,000.

86
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,498
>> Sean: TRYING FOR YEARS.

87
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:27,966
THERE MIGHT'VE BEEN PEOPLE LEFT

88
00:02:27,966 --> 00:00:00,000
BEHIND IN VIETNAM.
