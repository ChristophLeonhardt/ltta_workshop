CHICAGO. 
WE ARE AWAITING A POLICE NEWS 
CONFERENCE ON THE DEADLY 
VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED THIS 
WEEKEND. 
WANT TO GET STARTED, WE'LL 
BRING IT TO YOU LIVE. 
DOZENS OF PEOPLE WERE SHOT THIS 
WEEKEND. 
SEVERAL HAVE BEEN KILLED. 
RUDY GIULIANI WAS CHIMING IN 
ABOUT THIS SAYING THE MURDERS 
ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF ONE 
PARTY FOR DECADES. 
HE WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF 
-- OVER 70%, TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT 
IN CHICAGO RIGHT NOW WE'VE HAD 
A RASH OF SHOOTINGS OVER THE 
WEEKEND. 
THE MURDER RATE IS ACTUALLY 
DOWN. 
WE ARE HOPING TO HEAR MORE FROM 
THE CHICAGO POLICE FORCE TO 
FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO 
SLOW THINGS DOWN. 
THE SUMMER TIME IS REALLY 
COMNG TO A CLOSE WITH AUGUST. 
USUALLY DURING THE SUMMERS WHEN 
THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT OF 
SHOOTINGS. 
IT WAS PARTICULARLY 
DISAPPOINTING OVER THE WEEKEND.
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE. 
I AM ANNE-MARIE GREEN.  
AND UTILITY WORKERS THE NINTH 
PERSON KILLED BY THE WILDFIRES 
BURNING THERE. 
ABOUT 14,000 FOUR FIGHTERS -- 
FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING FIRES 
IN THE STATE. 
THIS IS NOW THE SECOND LARGEST 
FIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. 
MORE THAN 2000 STRUCTURES HAVE 
BEEN DESTROYED. 
42,000 PEOPLE ARE UNDER 
EVACUATION ORDERS. 
WILDFIRES ARE ALSO BURNING IN 
10 OTHER STATES. 
THERE ARE 134 FIGHTERS IN TOTAL.
THEY ARE AFFECTING ABOUT 1.6 
MILLION ACRES OF LAND. 
THE FIRE CENTER IN IDAHO IS 
MOBILIZING ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY 
PERSONNEL TO HELP WITH EFFORTS 
ACROSS THE U.S. THE AGENCY SAYS 
WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL WEEKS ARE EXPECTED TO 
Ãº 
WILDFIRES IN THE WESTERN UNITED 
STATES. 
>>> BACK TO CHICAGO NOW. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE LISTENING TO 
CHICAGO LAW ENFORCEMENT TALK 
ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS OVER THE 
WEEKEND. 
>> I REALLY DO TAKE IT 
PERSONALLY. 
I SHARE THE ANGER AND 
FRUSTRATION THAT MANY ARE 
HAVING TODAY. 
BECAUSE OF ANYTHING, THIS 
SHOULD UNDERSCORE THE 
CONTINUING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE 
WITH ILLEGAL GUNS AND OFFENDERS 
ON THE STREET THAT ARE WILLING 
TO USE THEM. 
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 
INCIDENT THIS WEEKEND, I IT IS 
-- ISSUED ADDITIONAL 
DEPLOYMENTS OF OFFICERS IN 
THOSE AREAS. 
IN FACT, 46 PEOPLE WERE 
ARRESTED FOR GUN CHARGES THIS 
WEEKEND. 
WE SEIZED 60 GUNS OVER THE 
WEEKEND, ADDING TO THE 5600 
GUNS THAT WE HAVE SEIZED SO FAR 
THIS YEAR. 
IS BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK OF 
THE OFFICERS IN THE CPD THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN A 20% REDUCTION IN 
MURDERS THIS YEAR AND ROUGHLY 
17% IN SHOOTINGS IN THE YEAR OF 
2018. 
ON TOP THAT, OFFICERS WILL 
CONTINUE TO PATROL THESE OFFERS 
-- AREAS. 
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT
POTENTIAL HOTSPOTS. 
ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE PLANNING 
FUTURE MOTIONS MISSIONS TO 
FOCUS ON THE VIOLENCE. 
THE TRUTH IS, AND MAYBE YOU'RE 
TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THAT, 
AS LONG AS WE FAIL TO KEEP THEM 
ACCOUNTABLE, WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS 
ON MONDAY MORNINGS. 
THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH OF IT. 
IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE 
PULLING THE TRIGGERS IN SOME OF 
THESE COMMUNITIES. 
THIS ISN'T A WIDESPREAD ISSUE 
AMONG THE CITIZENS. 
THIS IS A SMALL SUBSET OF 
INDIVIDUALS WHO THINK THEY CAN 
PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES BECAUSE 
THEY CONTINUE TO GET A SLAP ON 
THE WRIST WHEN WE ARREST THEM. 
DISLIKED -- DESPITE THE 
LEGISLATION WE PASSED, THESE 
INDIVIDUALS STILL INSIST ON 
DOING JUST THAT. 
I'M TIRED OF IT. 
EVERYBODY IN THE CITY SHOULD BE 
TIRED OF IT. 
THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT 
CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. 
MARY MANUAL HAS MADE 
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN 
MENTORING YOU THINK READING 
OPPORTUNITIES IN SOME OF THE 
MOST CHALLENGED NEIGHBORHOODS. 
WE NEED EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THE 
JUDICIAL PARTNERS TO START 
MAKING REPEAT OFFENDERS FEEL 
THE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR 
ACTIONS. WE NEED THE GOVERNOR TO
SIGN A BILL TO MAKE IT MORE 
DIFFICULT FOR OFFENDERS TO 
OBTAIN WEAPONS. 
WE NEED COMMUNITY LEVELS -- 
LEADERS TO WORK WITH US. 
WE NEED PARENTS TO BE PARENTS. 
WE NEED NEIGHBORHOODS TO BE 
NEIGHBORHOODS. 
YOU KNOW WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS 
ARE. 
THEY COME TO YOUR HOME'S 
EVERYDAY, THEY SLEEP WITH YOU 
EVERY DAY. 
GRANDPARENTS, PARENTS, SIBLINGS
, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. 
YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 
WE ALSO NEED THOSE INVOLVED 
WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MENTOR 
THE USE. 
WE HAVE WORKED HARD AND 
INVESTED COUNTLESS MAN HOURS 
AND RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY 
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CAUSING 
THE VIOLENCE IN CERTAIN PARTS 
OF THE CITY. 
THESE SHOOTINGS ARE NOT RANDOM. 
THEY ARE FUELED BY GANG 
CONFLICTS. 
WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 
AND WE CONTINUE TO SEND A 
MESSAGE THAT IT IS OKAY TO 
COMMIT THESE CRIMES BY NOT 
DOING ANYTHING AS A COMMUNITY. 
WE ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE ON 
THE SAME SIDE. 
CPD CAN BE BETTER. 
BUT THE CITY CAN BE BETTER. 
ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT I 
MENTIONED BEFORE, THEY NEED TO 
WORK TOGETHER AGAINST THE 
VIOLENCE SO THAT THE COMMUNITY 
CAN REBUILD. 
AND DESPITE WHAT WE SAW THIS 
WEEKEND, I'M STILL PLEASED 
BETWEEN CPD'S WORK, THE MAYOR'S 
INVESTMENTS IN THE WORK OF THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE ARE 
STILL REDUCING OVERALL GUN 
VIOLENCE THIS YEAR. 
BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE 
WORK TO DO. 
I THINK THAT WAS EVIDENT BY 
THIS WEEKEND. 
WE NEED EVERYONE TO COME TO THE 
TABLE WITH LESS TALK AND MORE 
ACTION. 
AND NOW I LIKE TO ASK MAYOR 
EMANUEL  TO COME UP AND SHARE 
SOME THOUGHTS. 
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK 
THE COMMANDER, THE 
SUPERINTENDENT -- THIS MORNING, 
I SPOKE AT A GRADUATION OF 
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. THEIR 
PARENTS WERE THERE. 
AND I TOLD THEM THEN AS I TOLD 
THEM ABOUT TAKING A TRAIN IN 
WITH MY DAUGHTER AS SHE WENT TO 
HER SUMMER JOB. 
THESE ARE YOUNG KIDS FROM HIGH 
SCHOOLS. 
AND I SAID TO THE PARENTS, IN 
THE JEWISH FAITH, WHEN YOU GET 
MARRIED YOU BREAK THE GLASS. 
AND THE REASON IS TO REMIND US 
THAT IN A MOMENT OF JOY AND 
HAPPINESS AND CELEBRATION OF 
LIFE THAT LIFE IS FRAGILE. 
AND I ASKED THE PARENTS IN THE 
SAME WAY THAT I SAID GOODBYE TO 
MY DAUGHTER ON THE TRAIN, AND 
THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR 
CHILDREN CELEBRATING THIS 
MILESTONE, TO HUG THEM. 
TO TELL THEM THAT THEY LOVE 
THEM. 
BECAUSE I WAS LEAVING THE 
GRADUATION I WAS GOING TO MOUNT 
SINAI AND STERGER HOSPITAL TO 
HUG THE DOCTORS AND NURSES, AND 
MEDICAL TEAMS WHILE THEY ACTED 
PROFESSIONALLY THEY TOO HAVE A 
SOUL. 
AND LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH I 
APPRECIATED WHAT THEY DID THIS 
WEEKEND. 
LOOK, WE HAVE A HEAVY HEART. 
OUR CELLS ARE BURDENED. 
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND DID 
NOT HAPPEN IN EVERY 
NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHICAGO BUT IT 
IS UNACCEPTABLE TO HAPPEN IN ANY
A HOOD IN CHICAGO. 
WE ARE A BETTER CITY. 
I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY. 
OF EVERY WALK OF LIFE. I HAVE 
BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH THE 
MOTHER TODAY. 
TWO OF THEM. 
THEY HAVE THE SAME ASPIRATIONS, 
SAME DESIRES THAT I DO FOR MY 
CHILDREN THAT YOU DO. AND 
SOMEBODY ON A BIKE TAKES THE 
CHILD FROM THAT PARENT. THIS IS 
NOT ABOUT THE CHICAGO POLICE 
DEPARTMENT, ALONE. 
IT'S NOT ABOUT A SUMMER JOB 
PROGRAM ALONE. 
THIS IS ABOUT THE FABRIC OF A 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY, AS 
THE SUPERINTENDENT SHE SAID, 
WHO KNOWS WHO DID THIS. 
IF YOU SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, WE 
MUST COME FORWARD AS A 
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE AMORAL 
CENTER OF GRAVITY HOLDS. 
I SOUGHT -- SAW IT ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. 
POLICE, LEADERS, PEOPLE FROM 
ALL PARTS OF THE CITY WALKING 
TOGETHER. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT 
THE WEATHER. 
BUT THE WEATHER DID NOT PULL 
THE TRIGGER. 
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT JOBS AND 
THEY COUNT BUT IN PARTS OF THE 
CITY WERE THERE ARE NOT JOBS, 
PEOPLE DID NOT PULL THE 
TRIGGER. 
THERE ARE VALLEYS, THERE ARE 
TOO MANY GUNS ON THE STREET, 
TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL 
RECORDS ON THE STREET AND THERE 
IS A SHORTAGE OF VALUES ABOUT 
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS 
WRONG. 
ABOUT WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND 
CONDONED WHAT IS CONDEMNED. 
AND WE AS A CITY IN EVERY CORNER
HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
IF YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS, BE A 
NEIGHBOR. 
SPEAK UP. 
NEIGHBORS COME TOGETHER. 
THE CITY WILL BE WITH YOU 
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. 
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY 
PEOPLE AND WHERE WERE THEY. 
THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL TAKE 
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY 
SEVERED JOBS -- SUMMER JOBS. 
WE'LL DO THAT. 
WE WILL DO THAT. 
WE HAVE MORE TO DO. 
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE AT 
STAKE. 
AND ALL OF US KNOW THIS IS NOT 
CHICAGO. 
THEREFORE, ALL OF US WHO LOVE 
THE CITY AND CALL IT HOME HAVE 
A RESPONSIBILITY TO HEAL THE 
NEIGHBORHOODS. 
TO HOLD THE MOTHER OR A FATHER 
OR A GRANDMOTHER IN OUR ARMS. 
AND AS THEY HEAL, WE AS A CITY 
MUST HEAL. 
NOT BY POINTING FINGERS BUT BY 
FINDING COMPASSION AND CONCERN 
AND ACTUALLY BEING A 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY. 
I HAVE MET THESE PEOPLE. 
THEY WERE CELEBRATING TOGETHER 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW SCHOOL.
THAT IS WHO I KNOW WE ARE. 
WE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAW. 
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN YOUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD OR YOUR COMMUNITY, 
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR BLOCK,
BUT THAT BLOCK, THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THAT 
COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF 
CHICAGO AND IS PART OF OUR 
HOME. 
THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THAT UP, 
THAT COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THEY 
HAVE A CITY THAT STANDS WITH 
THEM. 
AS I SAID TO THE DOCTORS AND 
NURSES THIS WEEKEND DO NOT 
FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF 
YOURSELVES AS WELL. 
MY PARENTS MET AT MOUNT SINAI. 
THEY DID A HEROIC JOB AS THE 
POLICE OFFICERS DID. BUT THEY 
TOO HAVE A SOUL. 
THEY TOO HAVE A HEART. 
AND THIS REPS AT BOTH OF THOSE. 
WE OWE IT TO EACH OTHER TO DO 
BETTER AND BE BETTER. 
>> I WILL TAKE A QUESTION TAKE 
QUESTIONS. 
-- WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 
>> WE HAVE REALLY GOOD LEADS ON 
QUITE A FEW OF THEM. 
WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY PHYSICAL 
ARRESTS YET. 
AND THIS RIPS AT BOTH OF THOSE. 
>>  
>> WE HAD A FEW THAT WERE LARGE 
GATHERINGS ON PARTICULAR 
BLOCKS. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHAT WE SAW 
THIS WEEKEND, IT JUST RIPS IT 
EVERYTHING THAT I BELIEVE IN. 
BECAUSE I KNOW AS A CITY AND AS 
A NEIGHBORHOOD THESE 
NEIGHBORHOODS CAN DO BETTER. 
CERTAINLY, CPD CAN DO BETTER 
BUT THAT THE END OF THE DAY, 
THE MEMBERS OF THE CBT DON'T GO 
TO BED WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS 
THAT NIGHT. 
THEY DON'T WAKE UP WITH THEM IN 
THE MORNING. 
IT IS RARE WE ACTUALLY WITNESS 
THIS STUFF. 
SOMEBODY KNOWS WHO DID IT. 
THEY DO. 
THEY KNOW THAT. 
THEY HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. 
THEY HOLD THE MAYOR ACCOUNTABLE.
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY? 
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEVER HEAR, I 
HEAR PEOPLE HOLDING US 
ACCOUNTABLE BUT I NEVER HEAR 
PEOPLE SAYING THESE INDIVIDUALS 
OUT HERE NEED TO STOP PULLING 
THE TRIGGER. 
I NEVER HEAR THAT. 
I NEVER HEAR THAT. 
THEY GET A PASS FROM EVERYBODY. 
AND THEY SHOULD NOT. 
THEY SHOULD NOT. YOU SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO GATHER ON YOUR BLOCK 
AND HAVE A PARTY WITHOUT THE 
FEAR OF BEING GUNNED DOWN. 
IT IS THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT 
CONTINUOUSLY COMMIT THESE 
CRIMES. 
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY? 
>> IT IS HARD FOR ME TO -- 
FORGIVE ME. 
I'VE BEEN SHOT. I WAS A DRUG 
DEALER FOR HEALTH MY LIFE AND I 
SHOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WE GOT 
TOGETHER WITH MOST OF THE HEADS 
OF THE GANGS, THE FOUNDERS AND 
PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE ROOM 
THAT NODDED THAT THEY WERE 
SHOOTERS, AND IN THAT MEETING, 
THEY EXPRESSED THAT THEY WERE 
TIRED OF SOME OF THEIR LOOSE 
CANNONS THAT ARE GOING OUT AND 
SHOOTING. 
ONE OF THE THINGS -- I'M FROM 
NEW YORK CITY, MY COMMITMENT IS 
TO BE HERE FOR THE SUMMER. 
I'VE BEEN 24 DAYS WITHOUT FOOD 
AND HOPING FOR A WEEK OF PEACE 
IN CHICAGO. 
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN HERE, I 
DON'T SEE -- IN THOSE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, THERE CRIME 
STOPPER SIGNS ALL OVER 
BILLBOARDS THAT SAID IF YOU SEE 
SOMETHING, CALL THIS NUMBER. 
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF. 
I'M JUST WONDERING, ARE YOU AT 
A POINT NOW WHERE YOU WOULD 
SAY, HEY, I'M CLERGY. 
CAN X GANG NUMBERS THEIR X GAME 
-- EX GANG MEMBERS COME IN? 
WE ARE NOT CHICAGO. 
WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING CAN WE 
MAKE THIS A NATIONAL ISSUE. 
MAYBE IT IS HAPPENING BUT I 
PRAY FOR YOU REGULARLY. 
I PRAY THAT YOU KNOCK THIS OUT 
OF THE PARK. 
WE WANT TO BE SAFE. 
MY WIFE AND I HAD TO DIVE ON 
THE FLOOR WHILE WE WERE DRIVING 
HERE. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, LISTEN, I 
APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. 
THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR 
QUESTION IS YES, WE ARE DOING 
THAT. 
SINCE IT BECAME THE 
SUPERINTENDENT I'VE BEEN ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS MY 
STAFF COLLABORATING WITH OTHER 
AGENCIES TO DO JUST WHAT YOU 
ARE TALKING ABOUT. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU ARE 
EXACTLY RIGHT. 
A LOT OF THE SHOOTERS THAT I 
TALKED TO ARE TIRED OF IT. 
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF IT, PROVE 
YOU'RE TIRED OF IT. 
GET YOUR FRIENDS TO PUT DOWN 
THE GUNS. 
>> PEOPLE TALKING TO YOU AND 
GIVING TIPS ABOUT -- 
>> RIGHT. 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL 
INDIVIDUALS. 
LISTEN, THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE 
IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE 
GOOD PEOPLE FAR OUTWEIGH THE 
BAD PEOPLE. 
THEY DO. 
THEY ARE SICK OF IT. 
I GOT SEVERAL CALLS THIS 
MORNING MYSELF. 
I THINK HALF THE CITY HAS MY 
CELL PHONE NUMBER. 
PEOPLE CALLED TO GIVE ME TIPS. 
WE WORK HARD WITH THE DETECTIVE 
DIVISION AND THE STATE'S 
ATTORNEY OFFICE TO MAKE SURE IF 
YOU DO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY 
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO 
KEEP YOU SAFE. 
>> LET ME DO ONE THING AND THEN 
WRITE TO YOU. 
-- RIGHT TO YOU. 
>> I REGULARLY ATTEND CHURCH. 
MUCH TO MY RABBI'S CHAGRIN BUT 
I DO. 
I HAVE SEEN LOVE, COMPASSION, 
AND A SENSE OF UNITY IN THE 
LACE OF FAITH ON SUNDAY. 
IT NEEDS TO BE OUT ON THE 
STREETS. 
SUNDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. 
NOT JUST CONFINED TO THE WALLS 
OF A PLACE OF WORSHIP. I'VE 
SEEN A LOT OF LEADERS AND 
MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION DO 
EXACTLY THAT. 
TAKE THAT FAITH, TAKE THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OUT TO THE STREET. 
THAT'S OF THE PASTOR DID ON THE 
WESTSIDE. 
THAT'S WHAT I NUMBER ON THE 
SULCI DO. 
-- SOUTH SIDE DO. 
DON'T THINK PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE., 
WHO ACTUALLY DID THIS. IF YOU 
SAY TO YOURSELF, ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH, WILL THAT IMPLORE YOU 
TO THEN DO SOMETHING SO THIS 
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN? 
THE OFFENDER IN ALMOST EVERY 
SITUATION IS KNOWN. 
KNOWN BY SOMEBODY. 
THEY HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO SPEAK UP SO THERE CAN BE 
LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE 
ACTIONS. 
>> MAYOR, -- 
>> I PROMISE. 
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT THE 
NUMBERS ARE DOWN, 
SUPERINTENDENT. 
WHY THEN SUCH A VIOLENT WEEKEND 
THIS WEEKEND? 
WHAT IS YOUR INVESTIGATION TOLD 
YOU ABOUT THE DYNAMICS THAT LED 
TO THESE THINGS AS LAST 
WEEKEND? 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IS IT THE 
WEATHER? 
IS IT THIS? 
IS IT THAT? 
NO. 
IT'S THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 
PEOPLE PULLING THE TRIGGERS. 
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 
WEATHER, ALL THAT DOES IS 
AFFORD MORE PEOPLE TO BE OUT. 
THE WEATHER DOESN'T CAUSE A 
PROBLEM TO SAY IT IS 90 DEGREES 
AND I'M GOING TO SHOOT 
SOMEBODY. 
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. 
IT IS SIMPLY HOLDING THESE 
INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE. 
THE FACT THAT WE HAD SO MUCH 
THIS WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, WE'LL 
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF WE CAN 
DETERMINE THAT. 
LISTEN, THIS WAS CONTAINED IN 
ROUGHLY 4 DISTRICTS IN THE CITY.
SO IT IS NOT LIKE THOSE PEOPLE 
GOT TOGETHER AND SAID WE ARE 
GOING TO CREATE CHAOS. 
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. 
IT'S A MATTER OF US BEING 
BETTER AS A SOCIETY, HOLDING 
PEOPLE THAT PULL TRIGGERS 
ACCOUNTABLE. 
SUPERINTENDENT -- 
>> THERE WAS NO DRAIN OF 
RESOURCES REGARDING LOLLAPALOOZA
. THAT WAS ALL OVERTIME. 
IT CAN I ADD ONE THING TO THIS? 
>> AS THE SUPERINTENDENT JUST 
NOTED, THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR OR 
FIVE DISTRICTS THAT THE BULK OF 
THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND GANG 
VIOLENCE HAPPENED. 
THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
COMMUNITIES SIMILAR TO THE ONES 
WHERE THIS HAPPENED, WERE 
NOTHING HAPPENED. 
SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS. 
SIMILAR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 
SIMILAR FAMILY CULTURAL -- THE 
QUESTION IS, WHAT MADE THAT 
DIFFERENT? 
AND I'M CONSTANTLY -- YOU ASKED 
AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION. 
THE QUESTION WAS ASKED WHERE 
ARE THE POLICE AND WHAT WERE 
THEY DOING? 
WHAT HAPPENED HERE? 
WHAT WAS THE DISTRIBUTION? 
THERE IS ANOTHER SET OF 
QUESTIONS, LEGITIMATE 
QUESTIONS. 
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THE 
QUESTIONS. 
THERE IS A COMPONENT OF THIS 
THAT GETS AMORAL, ETHICAL, 
VALUE PEACE THAT IS A QUESTION 
THAT MUST ALSO HAVE EQUAL 
VALUE. 
AND BE MEASURED IN THE SAME 
WAY. 
AND I DO WANT TO IMPLORE -- 
HAVING TALKED TO ONE MOTHER 
TODAY, WHO LOST A CHILD, SHE 
DID EVERYTHNG RIGHT AS A 
PARENT. 
HER CHILD HAS BEEN STOLEN FOR 
HER. 
FOR HER FRIENDS, THAT CHILD 
WILL NEVER HAVE A CHILDHOOD 
AGAIN. 
AND THEREFORE, WE MUST USE THAT 
TO HEAL OURSELVES AND BE BETTER 
WHICH REQUIRES A COMPONENT THAT 
DOESN'T LOOK AT ALL THE 
CONDITIONS BUT ACTUALLY ASKS 
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER. AND YOU 
MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
WHAT YOU DID. 
>> MAYOR -- 
>> IT IS TIME TO WORK -- IN 
CHICAGO. 
IS IT TIME TO -- BROADER 
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE? 
>> LISTEN, I WILL TELL YOU FROM 
A LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT, 
WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES. 
I DON'T THINK THE RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN CPT AND THE FBI, ATF, 
AND FBI HAVE EVER BEEN AS 
STRONG AS IT IS NOW. 
WE ARE ALREADY DOING THOSE 
THINGS. 
WE DO BETTER? 
YES. 
WE ALWAYS CAN DO BETTER. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THINGS LIKE 
WE SAW THIS WEEKEND IS 
EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY. 
>> YOU KNOW THIS. 
THERE WERE ATF AGENTS WHO WERE 
OUT WITH POLICE OFFICERS DOING 
WORK -- I THINK IT WAS IN THE 
NINTH DISTRICT. 
>> YES. 
>> THE AGENT WAS SHOT. 
THAT'S A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING WORKING. 
AGAIN, I WANT TO UNDERSCORE WHAT
THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID. 
EVERYBODY IS POINTING IT 
SOMETHING SAYING THEM. 
THE CRIMINAL AND THE CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY AND THE GANG HAVE TO 
BE RAISED RATHER THAN TO SAY 
WHAT DID THE POLICE DO, WHAT 
ARE THE FEDS DOING? 
THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS 
BUT NOT IN THE OF ANOTHER SET 
OF QUESTIONS. 
NOT IN LIEU OF ASKING WHERE IS 
THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE GANG OR 
THE CULTURE THAT CONDONES 
RATHER THAN CONDEMNS. 
COLLECTIVELY. 
I WANT TO REPEAT, THERE ARE 
GOOD PEOPLE IN THESE 
NEIGHBORHOODS WHO HOLD UP ALL 
THE VALUES OF WHAT IT TAKES TO 
CREATE A MORAL CENTER FOR 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY. 
AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO RIP AT 
IT. 
AND IF YOU KNOW THAT, THEY 
COULD NOT BE PART OF IT. 
THEY TEAR AT THE VERY FABRIC. 
>> HOTTIE CHANGED THAT, MAYOR? 
>> -- HOW DO I CHANGE THAT, 
MAYOR? 
>> I HAVE MY RESPONSIBILITY AS 
A MAN. 
WHEN IT COMES TO VALUES -- AND 
I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, THERE 
IS POLICING, THERE IS PUBLIC 
SERVANTS, THERE ARE PRINCIPLES, 
THERE ARE PASTORS, AND THEIR 
APPEARANCE. 
AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE PLAY A 
ROLE. 
WE HAVE -- ONE OF THE THINGS 
I'M TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE 
TAKING ONE OF THOSE MENTORS AND 
GIVE THEM 3 YEARS, I NEED THE 
PARENTS TO TEACH KIDS NOT JUST I
, WE NEED TO TEACH THE KIDS. 
I MET A MOM. SINGLE MOM OF 
THREE BOYS. 
ONE IS APPLYING AT THE 
UNIVERSITY CHICAGO. 
WHAT DID SHE DO? 
SHE CLEANS AT A SCHOOL. 
BY HERSELF, RAISING THREE BOYS 
ALL GOING TO UNBELIEVABLE 
SCHOOLS. 
SHE IS INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES. 
I WILL SAY AS A FATHER OF THREE 
CHILDREN, PARENTING IS 
ESSENTIAL. 
A PLACE OF WORSHIP AND FAITH 
THAT BUILDS A SENSE OF MORAL 
CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT TO NOT 
JUST THE INDIVIDUAL BUT ALL OF 
US, THAT'S A COMPONENT OF IT AS 
MUCH AS REPLACING DESPAIR WITH 
HOPE. 
THAT PLAYS A COMPONENT OF IT. 
AS MUCH AS WHAT THE POLICE DO. 
EVERY TIME WE DO THIS, IT IS 
FINGER-POINTING AT SOMEBODY 
ELSE WITHOUT ALSO ASKING A 
LARGER QUESTION. 
I WILL TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITY 
ON THE MORAL COMPONENT. 
AND I WILL TAKE WHERE I HAVE 
FALLEN SHORT. BUT THE QUESTION 
IS IF BY POINTING ONE FINGER AT 
ONE PERSON, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU 
-- ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY AND 
EVENTUALLY -- INDIVIDUALLY. 
SINCE I STARTED TALKING ABOUT 
THE JEWISH FAITH, I WILL CLOSE 
WITH THIS. 
THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO MY KIDS 
AND EACH ONE ON THEIR PERMITS 
FOR WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS. 
THE RABBI SAID WHO ARE YOU IF 
YOU'RE NOT FOR YOURSELF. 
WHAT ARE YOU IF YOU'RE ONLY FOR 
YOURSELF? 
IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN? 
THAT IS A MORAL QUESTION ALL OF 
US INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY
MUST ASK OURSELVES. 
>> IF THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WENT
THEY TURNING IN THE BAD GUYS? 
>> THAT'S A QUESTION WE'VE BEEN 
ASKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. 
SO LISTEN, THAT SOMETHING THEY 
HAVE TO DO BETTER AT. 
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT -- I 
WOULD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM THE 
FACT THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HAS ISSUES IN CERTAIN 
COMMITTEES. 
I WOULD NEVER HIDE THAT FACT. 
WE'VE HAD ISSUES. I'VE BEEN A 
COP FOR 30 YEARS. 
DON'T THINK I'M NACVE OR TONE 
DEAF TO THAT. 
I'M NOT. 
WE ARE WORKING HARD TO REPAIR 
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY. 
ESPECIALLY THE LACK COMMITTEES 
WITH CPD. 
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO. 
I DON'T ENJOY THIS. 
I KNOW IT IS THE REALITY OF 
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING UP. 
I HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO 
MAKE CPD BETTER. 
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 
BUT WHAT I'M ASKING FOR THE 
COMMUNITY TO STEP UP AND DO 
THEIR PART ALSO. 
WE CAN'T SOLVE THESE THINGS 
WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY. 
CPD IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE 
FAITH THE COMMUNITY HAS IN IT. 
SO TO ME AND MY STAFF TO TRY TO 
REPAIR THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. 
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 
AT THE SAME TIME, IT SIMPLY 
CAN'T BE PLACED AT THE DOORSTEP 
OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 
EXPECT THEM TO HANDLE IT. 
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ISN'T 
HERE TO RAISE CHILDREN. 
WE ARE NOT. 
I TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE COME 
UP TO US TALK ABOUT THEIR KIDS 
AND WHAT WE CAN DO. 
NO. 
IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT CAN DO. 
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. 
AND SOMETIMES IT DOES TAKE A 
VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD. 
I'M OKAY WITH THAT. 
WHEN WE SEE PARENTS STRUGGLING, 
IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO REACH 
BACK AND HELP THEM. 
HELP THEM BE BETTER PARENTS. 
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE CPD 
PART OF IT. 
BUT WE STILL NEED THE COMMUNITY
'S HELP IN RESOLVING SOME OF 
THESE ISSUES. 
IT SHOULD BE HEARTBREAKING FOR 
EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED 
THIS WEEKEND. 
AND AGAIN, IT WAS CONTAINED -- 
OUT OF 22 DISTRICTS IT WAS 
ABOUT CONTAIN TO FOUR OF THEM. 
THE CITY ISN'T ON FIRE. 
WE JUST NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED 
TO DO. 
>>  
AND YOU TALK TO SOME THESE 
PEOPLE AND -- 
>> THAT'S A FRUSTRATION THAT I 
SEE. 
LISTEN, MY RELATIVES, PEOPLE I 
GREW UP WITH IN THE CITY CALL 
ME ALL THE TIME. 
AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT IN 
CERTAIN AREAS OF THE CITY WE 
BEGIN TO NORMALIZE THESE 
THINGS. 
AND IT ISN'T NORMAL FOR A CHILD 
TO GROW UP -- LET ME DIGRESS 
FOR A MOMENT. 
I WAS OUT ON THE WEST SIDE ONE 
DAY. 
AND I WAS JUST WATCHING KIDS 
PLAY ON A PLAYGROUND. 
AND RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER 
FROM WHERE WE WERE SITTING, 
THERE WAS ABOUT FOUR GUNSHOTS. 
BAM, BAM, BAM. I SEE THESE KIDS 
IMMEDIATELY GO DOWN ON THE 
GROUND. 
WE GO AROUND THE CORNER AND WE 
COULD STILL SEE THE SMOKE. 
BUT THOSE OFFENDERS WERE GONE. 
AS WE ARE GOING AROUND THE 
BLOCK, WE GO BACK PAST THE 
PLAYGROUND. 
THOSE KIDS THAT HAD DUCKED DOWN 
ARE NOW BACK PLAYING LIKE 
NOTHING HAPPENED. 
THAT'S NOT NORMAL. 
IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR THOSE KIDS 
TO THINK THAT'S OKAY. 
AND I THINK IN CERTAIN ASPECTS, 
WE BECOME DESENSITIZED TO THIS 
TYPE OF THING. 
AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS 
WITH PEOPLE NOW ABOUT STANDING 
UP TRAUMA TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE 
WHEN THIS TYPE OF THINGS -- 
THING HAPPENS. 
THE WORST THING WE CAN DO IS 
NOT DO ANYTHING AND LET FOLKS 
BECOME DESENSITIZED. 
THIS ISN'T RIGHT. 
IT IS NOT NORMAL. 
THEY SHOULDN'T BE GROWING UP 
LIKE THAT. 
>>  
>> YOU KNOW WHAT -- 
>> WE HAVE JUST BEEN LISTENING 
TO EDDIE JOHNSON AND MAYOR 
EMANUEL REACTING  TO THE RASH 
OF GUN VIOLENCE OVER THE 
WEEKEND STARTING SATURDAY AT 
MIDNIGHT. 
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE 
WERE SHOT. 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 
POSSIBLY 10 SO FAR. 
THESE NUMBERS ARE FLUCTUATING 
BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH GUN 
VIOLENCE. 
POLICE ARE SAYING THE VIOLENCE 
WAS TARGETED. 
IT WAS GANG RELATED. 
THEY WERE SHORT UPS AT A 
FUNERAL, AND A BLOCK PARTY, IT 
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAD 
GATHERED ON FRONT PORCHES. 
THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE CHIEF 
SUNDAY PARTICULARLY EXASPERATED.
-- SOUNDING PARTICULARLY 
EXASPERATED. 
MURDERS ARE DOWN IN CHICAGO BUT 
A WEEKEND LIKE THIS HIGHLIGHTS 
JUST HOW DISTURBING THE TREND 
IS. 
EVEN WITH THE REDUCTION IN 
VIOLENCE, IT STILL IS OUT OF 
CONTROL. 
AND THE CHIEF WANTED PEOPLE TO 
KNOW THAT REALLY, THE FOCUS WAS 
ON FOUR DISTRICTS ON THE WEST 
SIDE OF CHICAGO. 
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A 
CITYWIDE PROBLEM. 
IT IS CONCENTRATED TO SPECIFIC 
AREAS BUT IT IS BAD IN CERTAIN 
AREAS. 
WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE POLICE 
CHIEF AND THE BEAR WAS A DESIRE 
THAT -- AND THE MAYOR WAS A 
DESIRE THAT PEOPLE COME FORWARD 
AND HELP. 
I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 
MAYOR EMANUEL USED A PHRASE  
HIGHLIGHTING MORALITY. 
HE CALLED IT MORAL 
RESPONSIBILITY TO COME FORWARD 
AND ASSIST THE POLICE. 
BUT THINGS ARE COMPLICATED IN 
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. 
SCHOOLS ARE STRETCHED TO THE 
LIMIT. 
GOOD JOBS ARE HARD TO COME BY. 
THIS SORT OF GUN VIOLENCE 
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. 
THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF 
TRENDS THAT INJURY TO THIS. 
SHOCKOE -- CHICAGO HAS BECOME 
THE POSTER CITY FOR THIS GUN 
VIOLENCE. 
THEY HAVE REMOVED MORE THAN 
5000 GUNS FROM THE STREETS LAST 
YEAR. 
THE CHIEF SAYING THEY RECEIVED 
60 MORE OF THE WEEKEND. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN OUR 
NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, DEAN 
REYNOLDS. 
YOU ARE IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
THE MAYOR, MAYOR EMANUEL, HE 
LOOKED  EMOTIONAL. 
HE USED THE PHRASE MORAL 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
HE WAS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO 
COME FORWARD AND HELP POLICE. 
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY? 
WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU? 
>> Reporter: TO BE HONEST, 
WE'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES 
BEFORE. 
I'M SEEING THE MAYOR EXERCISE 
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN THE CITY 
MANY TIMES BEFORE. 
AND MAKE THE SAME POINT MANY 
TIMES. 
ONE VERY FAMOUS MOMENT WHEN YOU 
SAID WHO RAISED YOU IN 
REFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DOING THE SHOOTINGS. 
SO, THERE IS REALLY NOTHING NEW 
HERE. 
THERE IS JUST MOUNTING 
FRUSTRATION. 
THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, 
EDDIE JOHNSON, SAID THAT THE 
POLICE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO 
IN RESTORING TRUST IN THESE 
COMMUNITIES GETTING PEOPLE TO 
COME FORWARD AND IDENTIFY THOSE 
WHO ARE GUILTY OF DOING THE 
SHOOTINGS. 
YOU KNOW, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT 
IF WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
SOMEWHERE AND WE WERE DISCUSSING
WANT TENT SHOOTING OF PEOPLE, 
WE'LL BE TALKING UNDER THE 
RUBRIC OF TERRORISM. 
BUT THEY ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO 
APPLY THAT LABEL TO WHAT IS 
GOING ON HERE. 
INSTEAD, THEY TALK ABOUT THE 
LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH. 
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSING. 
ETC., ETC. 
AGAIN, WE HAVE SEEN ALL OF THIS 
BEFORE. 
THE QUESTION IS IF ANYTHING 
WILL CHANGE BECAUSE OF IT. 
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT IN THE PAST. 
>> BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME 
PROGRESSION MADE. 
RIGHT? 
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE THOUSANDS 
OF GUNS THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL 
OFF THE STREETS. 
THE MAYOR TALKED ABOUT PROGRAMS.
THIS WEEKENDS -- IT LOOKS 
REALLY BAD. 
HAVE THINGS BEEN IMPROVING? 
>> Reporter: WELL, YES. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE 
CITY, THE ENTIRE CITY IS FINE. 
IT'S FOUR DISTRICTS IN THE CITY 
WERE ALL OF THIS STUFF IS GOING 
DOWN. 
THE REST OF CHICAGO IS PEACEFUL.
THERE WAS A BIG LOLLAPALOOZA 
CONCERT HERE OVER THE WEEKEND. 
NO PROBLEMS THERE. 
SO YES, THE VIOLENCE IS GOING 
DOWN MARGINALLY. 
THE PROBLEM AREAS ARE STILL THE 
PROBLEM AREAS. 
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, 
NO MATTER HOW YOU CUT IT, THEY 
KNOW WHERE THESE PROBLEM AREAS 
ARE. 
THE WONDER IS IF THEY KNEW 
THERE WAS A BLOCK PARTY GOING 
ON AFTER MIDNIGHT IN ONE OF THE 
PROBLEM AREAS, WHY THEY DIDN'T 
ASSIGN POLICE CRUISERS DOWN THE 
BLOCK AS A DETERRENT. 
WE HAVEN'T HAD AN ANSWER TO 
THAT. 
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO 
SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT. 
PLEASE FORGIVE ME. 
MAYOR EMANUEL  PUT THE PRESSURE 
ON RESIDENTS TO DO MORE. 
YOU SORT OF FRAMED IT AS A 
MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. 
I KNOW DURING THE WEEK THERE 
WERE HUGE DEMONSTRATIONS. THEY 
BLOCKED THE STREET PROTESTING 
VIOLENCE. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MESSAGE 
FROM THE MAYOR WHO HAS BEEN 
EMBATTLED, HOW IS THAT GOING TO 
GO OVER WITH SOME OF THOSE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROTESTING 
OVER THE WEEKEND? 
>> Reporter: WELL, I MEAN, HE 
IS NOT REALLY SHIFTING BLAME OR 
ANYTHING. 
WHO CAN ARGUE THAT WHAT IS 
GOING ON ON THE SOUTH AND WEST 
SIDES IS MORAL? 
YES. 
MORALITY COMES INTO PLAY. 
AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT 
THESE WERE NOT HUGE 
DEMONSTRATIONS. THEY WERE A 
COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE 
DEMONSTRATING ALONG LAKESHORE 
DRIVE. 
AND THEY WERE RECEIVED WELL IN 
THE NORTH SIDE COMMUNITIES 
WHERE THEY MARCHED UP TO 
WRIGLEY FIELD. 
SO THERE IS SYMPATHY HERE. 
THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOBODY 
KNOWS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. 
AND THEY TALK ABOUT 
CONFISCATING THE GUNS, THEY 
TALK ABOUT PASSING NEW LAWS TO 
INCREASE PENALTIES FOR THOSE 
HOLDING ILLEGAL WEAPONS. 
IT IS ANYBODY'S GUESS WHICH 
THING WILL ACTUALLY STRIKE A 
BLOW AGAINST THE VIOLENCE. 
>> INDEED. 
IT IS DISTURBING WHEN YOU HEAR 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 
IT IS GOOD TO POINT OUT THAT IT 
ISN'T JUST A FEW DISTRICTS. 
IN FACT, MOST OF CHICAGO IS 
DOING WELL. 
AND IT SORT OF BOGGLES THE MIND 
WITH SO FEW AREAS TO FOCUS ON, 
WHY WE CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT. 
CERTAINLY THERE IS A LOT OF 
ATTENTION. 
>> Reporter: YOU CAN OVERLAY 
STATISTICS ON THOSE AREAS. 
UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS, 
POVERTY, POOR EDUCATION, 
ILLEGITIMACY, ON THOSE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THAT'S HOW 
YOU IDENTIFY THE NEIGHBORHOODS. 
THE REST OF THE CITYIS PRETTY 
GOOD. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN A 
BUBBLE. 
A NUMBER OF TRENDS HAVE BEEN IN 
PLACE FOR DECADES AND IS PART 
OF WHAT GETS US HERE. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> TURNING NOW TO THE STORM 
OVER THE CENTRAL PACIFIC TODAY. 
HURRICANE HECTOR IS CARING 
WINDS OF ROUND 140 MILES PER 
HOUR. 
IMAGES CAPTURED BY NASA SHOW 
THE STORM OVER THE WEEKEND. 
HECTOR IS INSPECTED TO PASS 
JUST SOUTH OF HAWAII ON 
WEDNESDAY. 
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IS
