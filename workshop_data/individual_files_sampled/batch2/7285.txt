so a woman goes into a CVS not the beginning of a joke - beginning of a unfortunate story about the state of America her name is kamila Hudson and she runs into a store manager and his name is Maury Matson so let's show you more Matson he's gonna get animated because he thinks that Camila might be up to no good so what was the the essence the problem well they say Matson claimed that he did not recognize a coupon that Hudson was trying to use which led to his calling the authorities huh interesting I didn't know that was a thing you call the cops over I thought you would say coupons invalid you got another one etc now turns out the coupon was not invalid it was a manufacturer's coupon I was a perfectly good coupon calling the cops that seems a bit extreme but let's find out more context Hudson said when she asked for Masse's name quote he became agitated and rude now well you asked for her name when you were calling the cops I think it's fair for her to ask your name hey you're calling the cops on me I got a normal coupon here what's going on and she went on to say quote I had zero concerns about the police being called now look if you're the store manager and you're about to call the cops on someone and they say here's how you spell my name and I have no concerns about it and it's over a coupon at that point does it register that perhaps you're making a mistake no he picks up the phone anyway now you're gonna see his hand shaking here because he got nervous when he started calling the cops she Camilla Hudson says in our Facebook page that's not a condition he has he wasn't like that before he in fact he called the cops the first time she didn't get that on tape and the cops said yeah that's not a thing and hung up on him he called back the on the cops and the cops by the way like give the credit to the cops in Chicago because they're like you want us to come arrest this woman for what you think is a bad coupon no so here he is on the phone with the cops the second time and that's when she starts taping it's a female she's wearing a green tell them I'll be here when she they arrived but I will be waiting for them to arrive oh oh wait you can tell them her name is Camilla Hudson I have ID and we'll share it's probably see AMI hey you got it exactly like the river mor e mo rry maximum 80s or african-american black no I'm not african-american I'm black black isn't a bad word all right thank you I'm black and I'll be right here who doesn't love that a - well unfortunately a lot of people in this country all right as CBS corporate spokesman said that the company has quote begun an investigation and we will take any corrective action that is warranted to prevent it from happening again they also went on the same we have quote affirm non-discrimination policies in place to help ensure that all customers are treated with respect and dignity my guests a lot of their right wing will say hi yeah there they go again with a not discriminating yeah I don't know if you know this but a huge part of the client base for CBS and all other corporations in America are African Americans Latinos Asians Jews Muslims etcetera they gotta sell to all of us that's why corporations have a lot of problems but but one of the things that they do at least get right is hey we try not discriminate because it's counterproductive free market that's what it calls for but the right wing like ah non-discrimination what are you angry about you you want them to have a discrimination policy I I'm not even sure what you're asking for anyway I also wanted to tell you that because look it's not necessarily CBS s fault if c CBS sees this and goes yeah whatever you know no probably that that was not an issue then it's their fault right you got one random store manager in the middle of the country what do you do you go profusely apologized which Camilla Hudson says they did and and you try to make it right and make sure that other people are not discriminating okay so let's go to Maury Madsen who is he Morey Madison was a state delegate for president Trump's presidential campaign of course of course he was and is running for Alderman great we're gonna be a politician that's according to the Chicago sun-times can't wait for that all right more details on a Madison is politically active as a gay conservative interesting who's restarting the Illinois Log Cabin Republicans which had lost members as shuttered after splintering over Republican politicians efforts to take away their right to marry he supported Donald Trump in 2016 obviously so he's like look guys I know they used to hate us but I think they don't quite hate us anymore so can we go to like maybe supporting them as they hate others well that seems like a interesting way to go about it so he apparently was politically active in leading an effort to build a waterfront bike path to a beach near his home as part of that effort he got the government to make the beaches old seawall historic landmark that sounds like regulation and work to give us his racist neighbors that improving the beachfront would not mean they saw an influx of people from the south side well that's nice and we're giving into the full context so that was him doing a good thing and I'm in favor of bike paths okay an opponent of his expensive bike path went to look at the signatures for a ballot measure and discovered that five of the 13 pages the signatures were written by him oops Matson reportedly admitted that he had signed some of the signatures himself and used address of the CVS where he worked for names Matson also told the local news site that he illegally collected signatures over the span of a year instead of in that allowed 90 days in other words voter fraud that's signature fraud it's a little different election fraud definitely and he could be facing charges on those and look at that uh-oh we're against regulation unless I want a bike path oh go to front unless I'm doing the election fraud and I don't know man you got a manufacturer's coupon I better call the cops on you alright and is it a trump supporter most definitely try to help him win the election that's the state of the right wing in America today two easy ways follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you are notified of our videos
