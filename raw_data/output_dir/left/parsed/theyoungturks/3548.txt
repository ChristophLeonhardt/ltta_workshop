THE
OPIOID EPIDEMIC CONTINUES TO
RAVAGE HUGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
AND THE QUESTION STILL REMAINS:
HOW IS IT THAT THE DRUG INDUSTRY
WAS ABLE TO SELL SO MANY OF
THESE PILLS IN AN UNMITIGATED
FASHION?
WELL INTO INVESTIGATIVE
REPORT, AN INCREDIBLE ONE DONE
BY 60 MINUTES IN THE WASHINGTON
POST SHOWS A THEME THAT IS ALL
TOO COMMON IN AMERICAN POLITICS.
CORRUPTION, THE REVOLVING DOOR
POLITICS, LOBBYING, AND A PROFIT
MOTIVE THAT LED INDIVIDUALS TO
SUPPORT THE SALE OF THESE DRUGS,
THE UNMITIGATED SALE OF THIS
DRUGS FOR PROFIT OVER THE LIVES
OF ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO
HAVE DIED.
NOW, THE STORY IS
CRAZY BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT HOW
LAWMAKERS IN CONGRESS
UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD STRIP THE
DEA OF ITS ABILITY TO SUSPEND A
QUESTIONABLE AND SUSPICIOUS
NARCOTICS SALES IN THE WAY THAT
THEY DID THAT IS THEY RECEIVED A
TON OF MONEY FROM THESE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES AND
FROM DISTRIBUTORS SO THEY COULD
STRIP THE DEA OF ANY POWER THAT
IT HAD TO REGULATE AND ENFORCE
LAWS TO PREVENT THE OVERUSE AND
THE OVER DISTRIBUTION OF
OPIOIDS.
ACCORDING TO THE PIECE:
SO 
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT WAS
THE NEW LEGISLATION AND WHAT DID
IT DO TO STRIP THE DEA OF ITS
POWER?
SO ESSENTIALLY, IN THE
BEGINNING, IF THE DEA SAW THAT
THERE WERE DRUG DISTRIBUTORS
DISTRIBUTING A SON OF OPIOID
PILLS TO A SPECIFIC PHARMACY,
THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY FREEZE
THAT TYPE OF TRANSACTION IN
ORDER TO INVESTIGATE TO MAKE
SURE THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
ILLEGAL OR DANGEROUS GOING ON
THOUGHTS WILL CONGRESS PASSED
LEGISLATION THAT CHANGE THE
BURDEN OF PROOF NECESSARY FOR
THE DEA TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO
THINK ABOUT IT AS THE DIFFERENCE
OF A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE
TO BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WHEN IT
COMES TO BURDEN OF PROOF THERE
AND THEY MADE IT SO DIFFICULT
THAT IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE DEA TO STEP IN AND
FREEZE OR SUSPEND THESE DRUG
SALES.
JUST TWO THINGS THERE
ALREADY.
ONE IS THE ONLY REASON
YOU DO THAT IS YOU WANT TO
MAKE SURE THE DRUGS KEEP
FLOWING.
THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE
A PROFIT MOTIVE HERE.
THEY WANT
TO SELL MORE DRUGS.
SO WHAT DO
THEY DO?
THEY DO WHAT IS
LOGICAL.
THEY GO AND BUY OFF
AMERICAN POLITICIANS SO THEY CAN
CHANGE THE RULES TO ALLOW THEM
TO DO THAT AT A GREATER RATE.
THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE
NUMBER ONE CONTRIBUTORS TO
POLITICIANS IN AMERICA.
MORE
THAN THE OIL COMPANIES, THE
BANKS, AND THEY ARE THE BIGGEST
PRACTITIONERS OF CRONY
CAPITALISM DOS OF THE STORY IS
AMAZING, BUT THEY ALSO DO IN
OTHER WAYS THAT THEY HAVE
EXTENDED THAT MONOPOLY FROM FIVE
YEARS TO 12 ON SOME OF THESE
DRUGS.
THEY DON'T ALLOW US, THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO
NEGOTIATE FOR LOWER DRUG PRICES
FOR MEDICARE.
THAT IS INSANE.
THAT $1 MILLION THAT THEY INVEST
WINDS UP GETTING GREAT RETURN ON
INVESTMENT, BUT THE DEGREE TO
WHICH OUR POLITICIANS ARE
CROOKED IS UNFORTUNATELY
INDESCRIBABLE, BECAUSE
YOU KNOW THE RESULTS.
IT IS NOT LIKE ANYBODY VOTING ON
THAT BILL DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIGGER
FLOW OF DRUGS AND IT WAS
GOING TO AFFECT MORE PEOPLE AND
LEAD TO MORE ADDICTION BUT
THEY ARE LIKE YES, BUT
THEY DID NOT PAY ME.
THESE GUYS PAID ME.
PRIVATE FINANCING OF ELECTIONS
LEADS TO POLITICIANS
WORKING FOR PRIVATE INTERESTS.
AND THIS CASE, THE DRUG
COMPANIES.
WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED WHEN
THEY SELL IS OUT ON THEIR
BEHALF TO.
EXACTLY AND I WANT TO BE
CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING.
THIS WAS
NOT LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED SEVERAL YEARS
AGO.
THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT
CONGRESS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED IN
APRIL 2016.
2016, SO THIS WAS
RECENT IN NEWS OF THE OPIOID
EPIDEMIC WAS ALREADY MAKING
HEADLINES.
PEOPLE ALREADY KNEW
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.
LIVES
ARE ALREADY BEING DESTROYED
BECAUSE OF THE OVER DISTRIBUTION
AND OVER PRESCRIPTION OF THESE
TYPES OF DRUGS.
NOW A JUDGE WHO
IS ESSENTIALLY TALKING ABOUT
THIS AND IS WRITING ABOUT THIS
FOR A LAW REVIEW JOURNAL SAID
THE FOLLOWING:
HE ALSO SAYS:
SO TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THIS NEW
LEGISLATION DOES, WHAT THIS NEW
LAW DOES SINCE IT IS NOT
LEGISLATION ANYMORE.
AGAIN, THEY
UNANIMOUSLY PASSED IT.
NOW THE REASON WHY WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE THERE HAS
BEEN A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO USED TO
WORK FOR THE DEA.
HIS NAME IS
JOE AND HE USED TO
RUN THE DEA'S OFFICE OF
DIVERSION
CONTROL AND SO HE FOCUSED
PRIMARILY ON PHARMACEUTICAL
DRUGS AND PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG
ABUSE AND HE SAW WHAT WAS GOING
ON.
HE PROPERTY AGGRESSIVELY TO
STOP THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION
AND UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS
UNSUCCESSFUL SO NOW HE IS
SPEAKING UP ABOUT IT.
THERE IS NO SITUATION WHERE IF
OUR REPRESENTATIVES ACTUALLY
RESENTED US THEY WOULD SAY YOU
KNOW WHAT, WE JUST RANDOMLY
THINK DRUG COMPANIES SHOULD BE
ABLE TO SET ANY PRICE THEY LIKE
AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF
AMERICANS.
THAT IS NOT A
SITUATION THAT EXISTS IN THE
WORLD.
THE ONLY REASON YOU DO
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WERE OWNED
BY THEM AND BY THE WAY, THE
HAPPENED UNDER BUSH BUT ALSO
HAPPEN UNDER OBAMA AND THIS IS
DURING THE OBAMA YEARS IN BOTH
PARTIES OFTEN PLAY ALONG WITH
THAT SO HERE THEY ARE.
HERE'S A
SITUATION WHERE THE ONLY REASON
YOU WOULD SET A HIGHER BAR IS TO
MAKE SURE THE DRUGS KEEP FLOWING
IN THE DRUG, IF MAKE MONEY EVEN
THOUGH YOU KNOW THE ADDICTION IS
OUT OF CONTROL THE COUNTRY, YET
BOTH PARTIES GO WELL, WHERE'S MY
BREAD BUTTERED.
NOT BY THE
PUBLIC.
WE DON'T A PUBLIC
FINANCING, WE'RE PRIVATE
FINANCING.
THESE GUYS GIVE ME A
LOT OF MONEY.
I'M GOING TO DO
WITH THEY ASK THAT IT IF IT
LEADS YOU TO HAVE A FILM
EVER WHO IS ADDICTED TO DRUGS, I
DO NOT CARE TO BECOME A MONEY.
I WANT TO CALLED A FEW THE
POLITICIANS THAT WERE BEHIND
THIS LEGISLATION.
THOSE WHO
SPONSORED AND THOSE WHO ENDED UP
SUPPORTING IT PRETTY
AGGRESSIVELY.
IN THE VERY
BEGINNING IT WAS REPRESENTATIVE
TOM MARINO.
ACCORDING TO THIS
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT:
SO BREAKING NEWS STORY TODAY WAS
THAT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT STARTING
NEXT WEEK, HE WILL CLAIM THAT
THERE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY
DUE TO THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.
WELL, YOU ARE NOW NAMING THE
SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO PRESSURED
CONGRESS TO PASS THIS TYPE OF
LEGISLATION TO BE THE DRUGS ARE.
YOU THINK HE IS GOING TO LOOK
OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF
AMERICANS THAT ARE BATTLING WITH
THIS TYPE OF ADDICTION?
NO, HE
CARES ABOUT MAKING MONEY AND
LOOKING OUT FOR THE DRUG
INDUSTRY THAT IS PATTING HIS
POCKETS.
IT IS CORRUPTION 101.
IN THE PAST, DRUGS ARE MET
YOU ARE GOING TO FIGHT DRUG
START AND THIS CASE IT MIGHT
MEAN THAT HE IS THE ONE THAT
HELPS THE AMERICAN DRUG CARTELS
PUSH MORE DRUGS TO GET US MORE
ADDICTED WHICH LEADS TO HEROIN
OVERDOSE, OXYCONTIN OVERDOSING
LIST GOES ON.
HE IS PATIENT ZERO FOR THE
LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS THAT
LED TO THE ADDICTION IN
THE FIRST PLACE.
TRUMP DID NOT PICK AND
BY ACCIDENT.
TRUMP WILL TAKE ANYONE WHO HAS
SOLD OUT THE CORPORATE
INTERESTS AND PUT THEM INTO THE
TOP POSITION.
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS TURNING
THE SWAMP.
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT IS GROSS HOW BRAZEN THEY
ARE ABOUT IT BECAUSE IF YOU
WANTED TO COVER IT UP AND HE
WANTED TO BE SOPHISTICATED, YOU
WOULDN'T PICK MARINO, YOU WOULD
PICK ONE OF HIS LACKEYS.
LOWER-LEVEL GUY.
NO, HE
PICKED THE GUY WHO DID THE CRIME
IN THE FIRST PLACE DESPITE THE
FACT THAT HE HELPED PUSH THE
DRUG ADDICTION BUT BECAUSE OF
THAT FACT THAT ONE MORE THING
ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS PROMISES.
HE SAID IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT
OVER OBAMA WE DON'T
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES.
HE CAME IN AND IMMEDIATELY
SAID THAT TRUMP WILL NOT
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES.
OF COURSE.
BY THE WAY, WHEN IT COMES TO
THIS LAW THAT PASSED STRIPPING
THE DEA OF ITS POWER TO PROTECT
AMERICANS, OBAMA SIGNED THAT
LEGISLATION INTO LAW, SO THAT IS
ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND
AND WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING WAS
THAT THE WASHINGTON POST MADE IT
SEEM AS THOUGH, YOU KNOW, OBAMA
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND OR
REALIZE THE RAMIFICATIONS.
HE
WAS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO
SIGN SOMETHING, YOU ARE SIGNING
YOUR NAME AND ALLOWING
LEGISLATION TO PASS INTO LAW,
YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT THAT DUCK
LIKE SOME OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
PRESS IS IN THE JOB OF
CRITICIZING TRUMP EVEN THOUGH HE
IS PART OF THE ELITE, ETC., THEY
CONSIDER HIM NOT PART OF THE
ESTABLISHMENT BUT MAN, THEY LOVE
TO COVER FOR OBAMA.
AND HERE,
IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE
A WONDERFUL REPORT, GREAT JOB OF
INVESTIGATING THIS BUT YOU CAN'T
HELP BUT SOFT-PEDAL OBAMA.
WHAT
KIND OF EXCUSES HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS IN IT THEN HE SHOULD'VE
FOUND OUT HE SHOULD'VE DONE HIS
HOMEWORK SO NO, NO EXCUSE FOR
THE DEMOCRATS AM A NO EXCUSE FOR
OBAMA.
THEY WOULD MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE OBAMA DIDN'T, OBAMA ALSO
GOT PRIVATE FINANCING.
HE GOT
HIS ENTIRE CABINET HANDED TO
THEM BY CITIGROUP EXECUTIVE BACK
IN 2008.
HE TOOK EVERY PERSON
ON THE LIST BUT ONE.
HIS ENTIRE
CABINET WAS HANDED TO HIM BY
CITIGROUP BECAUSE HIS NUMBER ONE
SET OF DONORS BACK IN 2008 WERE
THE BANKS.
YOU KNOW, ALL THE
ESTABLISHMENT WANTS TO DO IS GO
BACK TO THE PRE-TRUMP DAYS.
THEY WERE TERRIBLE.
WE HAD
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
SELLING US OUT DAY
IN AND DAY OUT.
IT WAS SO BAD, PEOPLE ARE SO
FRUSTRATED THAT THEY VOTED
FOR TRUMP.
THAT IS HOW BAD THE PRE-TRUMP
DAYS WERE.
FOR THEM IT WAS THE STATUS
QUOTE THEY WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK
TO THAT.
NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOME GIRL MARSHA BLACKBURN
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO CALL
HER OUT.
WHEN IT COMES TO
LOBBYING, THERE WERE SEVERAL
SPECIFIC PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED A
LOT
OF MONEY FROM THE DRUG INDUSTRY.
WHEN IT COMES TO MARSHA
BLACKBURN WHO IS A
REPRESENTATIVE IN TENNESSEE SHE
RESUMED HUNDRED AND $50,000.
YOU MAY KNOW SHE IS NOW RUNNING
TO FILL BOB CORKER'S SENATE SEAT
IN TENNESSEE, HOWEVER SHE MADE
NEWS LAST WEEK WHEN SHE RAN A
CONTROVERSIAL AD THAT TWITTERED
THE MONETIZE.
TAKE A LOOK THAT.
I'M 100% PRO-LIFE.
I THOUGHT
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WE
STOPPED THE SALE OF BABY BODY
PARTS, THANK GOD.
PERSONAL, GO BACK AND WATCH
A VIDEO COVERAGE OF THAT
BECAUSE SHE IS LYING.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD NEVER SOLD
BABY BODY PARTS WITH THAT
IS INSIDE THE POINT THAT YOU ARE
PRO-LIFE?
YOU REPEATEDLY COSPONSORED
LEGISLATION THAT HELPED FUEL THE
DEATHS OF 200,000 AMERICANS
SINCE 2011.
YOU ARE PRO-LIFE?
KNOW YOU ARE A DISGUSTING
CORRUPT FRAUD AND YOU ARE ALSO A
LIER, BY THE WAY.
IT'S PATHETIC.
THIS PRO-LIFE BS.
PANDERING TO THE RELIGIOUS-BASE.
SHE IS NOT PRO-LIFE THE ONLY
THING SHE CARES ABOUT THE
COLD HARD CASH ñ LOVE THE
CORRUPTION.
THINK ABOUT YOUR SYSTEM IS
NOT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO GIVE
$150,000 TO A LOWLY
REPRESENTATIVE FROM TENNESSEE.
WHAT YOU THINK SHE IS GOING TO
DO?
DO THINK SHE IS GOING TO TAKE
THE HUNDRED $50,000
ABOUT AGAINST THEM?
KNOW, SHE IS GOING TO FOR THEM.,
THE FIRST TIME SOMEBODY GETS A
DONATION YOU MIGHT SAY, THE
CORPORATION, THE DRUG COMPANIES
ARE TAKING A GAMBLE ON SOMEONE
LIKE HER.
THE SECOND TIME THEY
GET THE DONATION THAT MEANS I
GAMBLE PAID OFF.
SHE DID
EXACTLY AS SHE WAS TOLD.
THEY
GOT A RETURN ON INVESTMENT.
THAT IS WHY THEY BOUGHT HER
AGAIN AND THAT IS WHAT SHE IS.
IT INCLUDES ALL THE PEOPLE IN
THE STORY, INCLUDING THE CENTER
THAT ANNA MENTIONED THERE, THE
HUNDRED AND $77 TO LAUREN HATCH.
HE IS DEEPLY CROWD FOR DECADES
AND ALL THE TV AND THE REST OF
THE MEDIA DOES OFTENTIMES AS
COVER FOR HIM AND THEY SAY OH,
THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM
UTAH.
THAT HONORABLE GENTLEMEN
HAS TAKEN MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN LEGALIZED
BRIBES AND AS EVERYTHING THAT
HIS PRIVATE DONORS HAVE
ASKED HIM TO DO.
THAT IS WHO HE IS.
AND THEN FINALLY, THE THIRD
PART OF THIS ISSUE IS THE
REVOLVING DOOR POLITICS BECAUSE
THE SAME LAWYERS WHO WORKED WITH
THE DEA IN ORDER TO GO AFTER THE
INDUSTRY AND MAKE SURE THAT
JUSTICE WAS SERVED IF THERE WERE
ILLEGAL NARCOTICS DISTRIBUTIONS,
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD LEAVE THE DEA
AND GUESS WHAT?
THEY WOULD GO
REPRESENT THE DRUG INDUSTRY.
IN
FACT, THE PRIME EXAMPLE IN THIS
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER WAS
LYNDON BARBER.
HE WAS THE DEA'S
FORMER ASSOCIATE CHIEF COUNSEL
AND IN 2011, HE LEFT THE DEA TO
GO REPRESENT THE DRUG COMPANIES
AND HE IS JUST ONE OF MANY
INDIVIDUALS WHO USED TO WORK AT
THE DEA WHO THEN WENT TO GO WORK
FOR THE DRUG INDUSTRY AND THE
REASON WHY THAT IS TERRIBLE IS
BECAUSE WILL OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS
AN ISSUE WITH THEM NOT ACTUALLY
BEING GENUINE AND BEING PART OF
THE DEA.
IT'S ALL A SHOW FOR
MONEY, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THEY KNEW THE TACTICS THAT THE
DEA USED IN ORDER TO HELP
MITIGATE THE SALE AND
DISTRIBUTION OF THESE DRUGS
AND SO THEY WOULD GO AND
ESSENTIALLY SHARE THE SECRETS OF
THE DEA WITH THE INDUSTRY
SO THEY COULD EFFECTIVELY LOBBY
FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD
HELP THEM OUT.
AND UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN, THE
CORRUPTION IS BIPARTISAN.
HOWARD DEAN, NOT RELATED TO THE
STORY BUT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
IT, USED TO CRITICIZE THE
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.
THEN HE
BECAME A LOBBYIST FOR THEM AFTER
YOU STOP BEING IN THE GOVERNMENT
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE
PROGRESS OF HOWARD DEAN YOU
KNEW, GONE.
NOW HE IS DOING
SYMPOSIUMS ON HOW THE PRIVATE
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS HELPING
TO SAVE AMERICA.
IT'S FUNNY WAS
SOMEBODY WILL DO IF THEY ARE
PAID TO DO IT.
YOU NEED PUBLIC
FINANCING SO THEY WORK FOR THE
PUBLIC INTEREST.
IF YOU ALLOW
FOR PRIVATE FINANCING, THEY WILL
WORK FOR THE PRIVATE INTERESTS
AND SINCE THE DRUG COMPANIES OF
THE NUMBER ONE DONORS IN
AMERICA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO SET
THAT OPIOID ADDICTION.
EVERYTHING YOU SEE WILL BE A LOT
OF HUFFING AND PUFFING THE
BEHIND THE SCENES, THEY WILL
ALMOST ALL AGREE YEAH,
LET'S GIVE THE DONORS EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WANTED EVEN IF IT
COSTS AMERICAN LIVES.
EXACTLY.
I JUST WANT TO LIVE
WITH ONE STAT THAT SHOULD BLOW
YOUR MIND.
WEST VIRGINIA IS ONE
PART OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS
REALLY STRUGGLING WITH OPIOID
EPIDEMIC AND THE ARTICLE
MENTIONS THE FACT THAT BETWEEN
2007 IN 2012 THERE WAS ONE
DISTRIBUTOR KNOWN AS MIAMI LUCAN
WHO SHIPPED 20 MILLION DOSES OF
HYDROCODONE AND OXYCODONE TO
PHARMACIES IN WEST VIRGINIA.
MILLION BETWEEN 2007 IN 2012 BUT
ACCORDING TO THE PIECE DESPITE
THE RISING DEATH RATE IN WEST
VIRGINIA, THE HIGHEST IN THE
NATION, PLEASE IN 2013
TO HALT THEIR OPERATIONS WERE
IGNORED BY THE LEGAL OFFICE AT
HEADQUARTERS AND IT WAS
BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESSURED BY
CONGRESS TO LEAVE THESE
DISTRIBUTORS ALONE BECAUSE THESE
DISTRIBUTORS ARE FUNDING THEM.
THESE ARE LITERALLY DRUG
PUSHERS AND YOU WANT TO
TALK ABOUT A GATEWAY DRUG?
IT IS NOT MARIJUANA.
IT IS
THESE LEGALIZED DRUGS AND YOU DO
NOT SEND ABOUT THAT AMOUNT OF
DRUGS TO WEST VIRGINIA AND NOT
KNOW THAT WEST VIRGINIA IS ONE
OF THE EPICENTERS OF THIS DRUG
DEALING THAT IS GOING ON THAT IS
LEADING TO THE DRUG ADDICTIONS,
THAT IS LEADING TO ALL OF THESE
DEATHS.
THEY KNEW, THE PEOPLE AT
THE COMPANY KNEW, THE
POLITICIANS KNEW, BUT THEY ALL
WANTED TO MAKE A BUCK OFF OF YOU
TO GET YOU ADDICTED AND IF YOU
WIND UP SUFFERING HORRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES OR EVEN DYING, THEY
STILL MADE THEIR MONEY.
ANYBODY
WHO KNEW THE SHIPMENTS WERE
GOING AT THAT RATE TO WEST
VIRGINIA TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY
WERE DOING AND DIDN'T GIVE A
DAMN.
