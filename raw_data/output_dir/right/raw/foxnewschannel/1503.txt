1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,278
BUT THERE IS A GROWING NEED

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,947
FOR FAMILIES TO TAKE IN AND

3
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:05,948
ADOPT FOSTER CHILDREN.

4
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:10,887
SO WHY WOULD THE CITY OF

5
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:14,357
PHILADELPHIA BE SEVERING

6
00:00:14,357 --> 00:00:16,493

00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,477
CATHOLIC CHARITY SERVES 120

20
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:37,814

36
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:02,506
WHY IN BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC

37
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:03,607
CHARITY HOLDS CATHOLIC

38
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:04,641
BELIEFS ABOUT SAME SEX

39
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,343

51
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,493
IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

52
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:25,362
SO, WHILE THE CITY FIGHTS

53
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:26,730
IDENTITY POLITICS, TONIGHT

54
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,699

FIRSTHAND HOW FOSTER CARE

96
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,565
CAN TURN AROUND A CHILD'S

97
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:34,999

SAINT VINCENT RESCUES

110
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,149

GOOD OSEE BOTH OF YOU AT

120
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,770
NIGHT.

121
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,439
SHAMBER, YOU SAY EVERY NIGHT

122
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,109
GUN FIGHTS WERE MY LULLABY.

123
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,411
I WAS EXPOSED TO DRUGS ABUSE

124
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,314
BEFORE MOST KIDS LEARN THEIR

125
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:22,614
ABCS.

126
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:23,148
THAT'S YOUR STORY.

127
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:24,549
>> YES, IT IS THAT IS ALL

128
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:25,116
VERY TRUE.

129
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:28,420
I WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THAT

130
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,788
VERY UNFIT CIRCUMSTANCES.

131
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:32,324
I'M SO GRATEFUL TO SAINT

132
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:33,525
VINCENT BECAUSE THEY SAVED

133
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:34,759
MY LIFE.

134
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,229
AND I THINK EVERY FOSTER KID

135
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,030
SHOULD HAVE THAT EXACT SAME

136
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,431
OPPORTUNITY.

137
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,765
AND I'M JUST HURT AND

138
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,400
CONFUSED AS TO WHY ANYONE

139
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,269
WOULD WANT TO REMOVE THAT

140
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,238
PRIVILEGE FROM ANY CHILD AND

141
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,540
TO REMOVE THOSE

142
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,908
OPPORTUNITIES AND

143
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:51,409
FAITH-BASED ADOPTION

144
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:51,843
AGENCIES.

145
00:03:51,843 --> 00:03:52,511
>> Martha: YOU WERE BOUNCED

146
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,545
AROUND FROM A FEW FOSTER

147
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:54,513
HOMES AND YOU SAID EVERY

148
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:55,380
TIME YOU GOT TO ONE.

149
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,315
YOU WERE SEPARATED FROM YOUR

150
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:57,682
SIBLINGS.

151
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,550
EVERY TIME YOU GOT TO ONE

152
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,185
YOU HOPES THIS WOULD BE YOUR

00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:00,652
FOREVER FAMILY.

154
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:02,587
>> CORRECT.

155
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,522
>> Martha: WHEN SAINT

156
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:04,623
VINCENT ENTERED THE PICTURE

157
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:06,491
THEY PUT YOU AND YOUR

158
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,425
SIBLINGS BACK TOGETHER AND

159
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:08,360
THAT'S WHERE YOU SAVED,

160
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,660
RIGHT?

161
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,929
>> YES.

162
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:11,496
>> Martha: NOW YOU ARE

163
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:12,731
WORKING ON A SINGING CAREER.

164
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,299
A LIGHT OF IT CAME FROM

165
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,269
SAINT VINCENT AND A LOT

166
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,769
COMES FROM YOU.

167
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,471
GOOD FOR YOU.

168
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:22,040
HOW DOES THE LAW WORK HERE?

169
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,408
BECAUSE, CATHOLIC CHARITIES

170
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,876
AND ALL THESE FAITH BASED

171
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:25,877
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SUCH A

172
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,345
HISTORY OF BEING FOSTER

173
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:27,679
PARENTS.

174
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,680
THEY TAKE THE BURDENNIBLE

175
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,148
OFF A LOT OF THESE CITIES,

176
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:30,448
RIGHT?

177
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,416
>> RIGHT.

178
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,684
FOR A CITY WITH SO MUCH

179
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:33,919
HISTORY THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE

180
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,854
HAVE SHORT MEMORIES.

181
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:36,555
CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES

182
00:04:36,555 --> 00:04:37,622
HAVE BEEN SERVING THESE

183
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,957
CHILDREN FOR OVER A CENTURY.

184
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,192
AND ACTUALLY THE CITY ITSELF

185
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,593
HAS RANKED THEM AS ONE THE

186
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:44,663
BEST PROVIDERS WHEN IT COMES

187
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,364
TO FINDING MORE HOMES FOR

188
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:47,866
THESE CHILDREN WHEN WE ARE

189
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:48,833
DEALING SUCH A CRITICAL NEED

190
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,901
AND CRISIS WITH A SHORTAGE

191
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,469
OF HOMES.

192
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:52,771
SO, WHAT THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT

193
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:56,241
IS PROTECTING THAT.

194
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:56,908
>> Martha: IN PHILADELPHIA

195
00:04:56,908 --> 00:04:57,876

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,758
THAT'S A QUESTION.

CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION AND

213
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,267
SAYS YOU WOULD LIKE TO

214
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:21,834
FOSTER A CHILD.

215

217
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,507
THEY WILL MAKE SURE THEY ARE

218
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,109
ABLE TO ADOPT BY REFERRING

219
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,044
THEM TO ONE OF 26 AGENCIES

220
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,448
THAT CAN MEET THEIR NEEDS.

221
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:36,916
>> Martha: SOUNDS LIKE A

222
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:37,617
GOOD ARRANGEMENT.

223
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,118
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE,

224
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,119
SHAMBER, BEFORE DID YOU GO?

225
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,487
>> AS YOU ALREADY STATED, AT

226
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,623
THE AGE OF 5, GUNS AND

227
00:05:43,623 --> 00:05:45,758
SIRENS WERE MY LULLABY, AND

228
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:47,426
THAT'S SO TRUE TO ME, AND I

229
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,662
WAS EXPOSED TO GANGS AND

230
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,898
PROSTITUTION AND DRUGS AND

231
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,600
SAINT VINCENT GAVE ME AN

232
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,534
OPPORTUNITY AND A LOVING

233
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:56,802
FAMILY AND I WOULDN'T WANT

234
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:58,104
ANY OTHER CHILD TO MISS OUT

235
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:58,704
ON THAT.

236
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:00,806
THAT IS UNDERGOING THE SAME

237
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:02,475
SITUATIONS AND I JUST DON'T

238
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,509
SEE WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT

239
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,711
TO TAKE THAT AWAY WHEN IT'S

240
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:08,881
SUCH A NATIONAL CRISIS.

241
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,716
>> Martha: DO YOU WRITE IN

242
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:11,784

243
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:12,618
EXPERIENCES GROWING UP.

244
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:13,319
>> I DO.

245
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,520
I ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE OTHER

246
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,688
PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN

247
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:16,889
OVERCOME THEIR

248
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:17,390
CIRCUMSTANCES.

249
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,024
>> Martha: GOOD FOR YOU.

250
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,825
>> THANK YOU.

251
