00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:03,298
COLLINS.

2
00:00:03,298 --> 00:00:06,668
>> OUR COMPANY OWNS HARPER

3
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:07,168
COLLINS.

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,336
GET MOVING.

5
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,938
TONIGHT IN NASHVILLE, THE

6
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,440
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT SPY GATE

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,809
AS WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING.

8
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:15,777
TAKE A LOOK.

9
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:18,546
>> HOW DO YOU LIKE THE FACT THAT

10
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:21,349
THEY HAD PEOPLE INFILTRATING OUR

11
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,883
CAMPAIGN.

12
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:24,920
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,123
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

14
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:32,226
PEOPLE INFILTRATING OUR

15
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:32,594
CAMPAIGN.

16
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:34,730
IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS BIG

17
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,100
BEAUTIFUL ARENA RIGHT NOW THAT’S

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,868
INFILTRATING OUR CAMPAIGN.

19
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:42,404
WOULD YOU PLEASE RAISE YOUR

20
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:42,905
HAND.

21
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:47,242
THAT WOULD TAKE COURAGE.

22
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:49,445
NOW LOOK AT WHAT’S GOING ON.

23
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:53,148
NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

24
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:56,518
COUNTRY HAS SOMETHING TAKEN

25
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,654
PLACE LIKE TOOK PLACE DURING

26
00:00:58,654 --> 00:00:59,288
THIS ELECTION.

27
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,658
>> JOINING US NOW, EXCLUSIVELY,

28
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:04,927
THREE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE

29
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:08,697
BEEN SEVERELY AND HARSHLY

30
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,933
IMPACTED BY ROBERT MUELLER AND

31
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,437
HIS PIT BULL ANDREW WEISMAN’S

32
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:17,073
WITCH HUNT.

33
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:20,743
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL.

34
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:23,112
LET ME ASK YOU ALL A SIMPLE

35
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:23,679
QUESTION.

36
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,582
I TURN TO YOU, CARTER, FIRST.

37
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:30,420
WERE YOU SPIED UPON?

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,387
DID A SPY APPROACH YOU?

39
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:34,691
>> I’M NOT SURE, SEAN.

40
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:39,862
THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THE FAKE

41
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:41,497
DNR REPORT JANUARY 2017.

42
00:01:41,497 --> 00:01:42,866
FIRST IS HACKING.

43
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,469
WE KNOW I HAVE BEEN HACKED,

44
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:46,870
EVENTUALLY.

45
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,471
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

46
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:48,938
KNOW.

47
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:52,142
THIS IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

48
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:52,575
ASSOCIATE.

49
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,812
THIS IS THE GUY THEY USED THE

50
00:01:55,812 --> 00:02:00,317
CLINTON BOUGHT AND PAID FOR

51
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:07,624
PHONY DOSSIER TO SPY.

52
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:15,132
ROB ROSENSTEIN SIGNED OFF AND BY

53
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:17,167
THEN THEY KNEW IT WAS LIES.

54
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,035
>> ABSOLUTELY.

55
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:21,138
THE OTHER THING IS FAKE NEWS

56
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:28,412
PROPAGANDA WHICH LED TO THE PHIA

57
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,413
WARRANT.

58
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,516
>> WHY DIDN’T THEY SAY TO THE

59
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:34,518
FBI SPRING OF 2015.

60
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:37,087
WHY DIDN’T THEY SAY -- YOU NEVER

61
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:37,888
MET TRUMP, RIGHT?

62
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:38,989
>> NEVER.

63
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,625
>> WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY THIS GUY

64
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,662
WENT TO RUSSIA, WE ARE WORRIED

65
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:45,463
ABOUT HIM?

66
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:48,632
>> THERE’S NOTHING TO IT.

67
00:02:48,632 --> 00:02:50,568
>> WHY WERE YOU IN RUSSIA?

68
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:55,206
>> GAVE A SPEECH.

69
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:55,806
>> NO.

70
00:02:55,806 --> 00:03:00,278
>> IT’S BEEN REPORTED YOU ARE A

71
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:03,381
DOUBLE CIA OPERATIVE.

72
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,818
>>> YOU COOPERATED WITH YOUR

73
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:07,251
COUNTRY?

74
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:07,785
>> ABSOLUTELY.

75
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:11,189
>> FOR THE BETTERMENT OF YOUR

76
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:11,889
COUNTRY?

77
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,424
>> ABSOLUTELY.

78
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,660
>> YOU WERE DEBRIEFED?

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,061
YOU DON’T LIKE THE QUESTIONS, DO

80
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:17,495
YOU?

81
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:19,297
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

82
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:20,565
>> YOU LOVE AMERICA?

83
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:20,999
>> YES.

84
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,535
>> YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP YOUR

85
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,504
COUNTRY MEETING WITH INTEL CIA

86
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:27,305
PEOPLE.

87
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:30,241
THEY ASKED FOR MY HELP AND I

88
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,176
DIDN’T SAY NO.

89
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:31,609
ABSOLUTELY.

90
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,279
>> SAM CLOVE IS, LET’S START

91
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,180
WITH YOU.

92
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,782
YOU WERE APPROACHED -- I KNEW

93
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,819
WHO THE GUY WAS TWO WEEKS BEFORE

94
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,021
MENTIONING HIS NAME.

95
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,790
YOU WERE APPROACHED BY THIS GUY.

96
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,059
WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

97
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,896
>> WHAT HE WANTED, HE USED

98
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:55,601
CARTER PAGE AS THE PERSON TO

99
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,369
GAIN ACCESS TO A MEETING WITH

100
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,871
ME.

101
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,606
WE MET 2016 IN THE WASHINGTON

102
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,273
D.C. AREA.

103
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,976
HE USED ME TO CREATE AN

104
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:06,445
INTRODUCTION TO GEORGE POP DO

105
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,680
THAT LIS.

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,348
PAPADOPULOS.

107
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:12,451
I DIDN’T KNOW THIS INDIVIDUAL

108
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,787
SUBSEQUENTLY MET WITH GEORGE.

109
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,755
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THAT.

110
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:19,892
IT WAS SO INNOCUOUS I DIDN’T

111
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,594
REPORT IT UP THE CHAIN OF

112
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,862
COMMAND.

113
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,563
I DIDN’T THINK ANYTHING OF IT.

114
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:27,299
>> HE SAID I’M A POLICY GUY,

115
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:29,235
THREE CAMPAIGNS, I WANT TRUMP TO

116
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,169
WIN.

117
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,437
MEANWHILE, HE WANTS INFORMATION

118
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,438
FROM YOU.

119
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,506
FAIR STATEMENT?

120
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,642
>> HE DIDN’T TRY TO GET

121
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,710
INFORMATION FROM ME.

122
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,779
I THINK WHAT THE MEETING WAS

123
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,548
ABOUT, THEY USED ME AS A WAY TO

124
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,217
GET AN INTRODUCTION TO GEORGE.

125
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:48,020
HE WANTED TO GO TO GEORGE

126
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,122
PAPADOPULOS.

127
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,325
HE USED ME TO GET TO GEORGE.

128
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,793
THAT WAS THE CHAIN OF EVENTS

129
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,327
THERE.

130
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,463
I THINK WHAT THE GOAL WAS WAS TO

131
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,999
CREATE A LINKAGE BETWEEN AN

132
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,268
AFFILIATE OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

133
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,404
BACK TO THE E-MAILS, AND IN

134
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,240
ORDER TO CREATE MORE PROBABLE

135
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,410
CAUSE, TO CREATE MORE PROBABLE

136
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,125
CAUSE FOR FIZA WARRANTS AND TO

137
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,760
WE HAVE ALL THREE APPROACHED BY

138
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,596
THE SPY IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

139
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:19,631
MIKE, TELL US YOUR SIDE.

140
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,234
YOU WERE APPROACHED BY THE SPY.

141
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:25,304
IMAGINE IF THIS WAS HILLARY’S

142
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:26,638
CAMPAIGN.

143
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:28,540
IMAGINE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS,

144
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,642
IMAGINE THE LEFT AND THE MEDIA

145
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:32,745
IN THIS COUNTRY, HOW DIFFERENT

146
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,046
THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE.

147
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:37,283
>> I BELIEVE I HAD AT LEAST TWO

148
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:41,120
AND PERHAPS MORE BY INDIVIDUALS

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,588
THAT WERE TRYING TO OFFER

150
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,890
INFORMATION TO THE CAMPAIGN THAT

151
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,794
WOULD HAVE JAMMED US UP IN SOME

152
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:49,295
WAY.

153
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,497
SAM AND CARTER WERE APPROACHED

154
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:52,531
TO A SPY.

155
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,468
I DON’T CARE WHAT THEY CALL THE

156
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:56,769
SPY, HUMAN INTELLIGENCE,

157
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:57,269
WHATEVER.

158
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,108
HERE IN BUFFALO, YOU CAN CALL IT

159
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:08,181
ELONGATED CYLINDRICAL SPAGHETTI.

160
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:14,487
WE CALL IT A SPY HERE.

161
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,790
THEY HAD TO DO A LOT MORE.

162
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,159
>> WHO LIES  TO A JUDGE?

163
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,229
>> WE WOULD BE LIKE THAT GUY IN

164
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,132
GOOD FELLAS, WATCHING OUT FOR

165
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,334
HELICOPTERS AND TOMATO SAUCE.

166
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:31,638
I’M CONVINCED --

167
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:35,542
>> WHAT CONGRESSMAN OR SENATOR,

168
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,645
I DON’T THINK THERE IS ONE, IF

169
00:06:38,645 --> 00:06:40,780
THEY GOT INFORMATION ON YOUR

170
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,849
OPPONENT, WOULDN’T TAKE THE

171
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:43,283
MEETING?

172
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,285
NAME ONE.

173
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,587
ANYONE THAT SAYS OTHERWISE IS A

174
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:47,921
LIAR.

175
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:48,955
I DON’T BELIEVE THEM FOR A

176
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:49,756
SECOND.

177
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,059
HERE’S WHAT I WANT OUR AUDIENCE

178
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:57,731
TO UNDERSTAND.

179
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:00,667
COLUMN ABOUT HOW ROBERT MUELLER

180
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,836
RUINED MY LIFE.

181
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,205
LISTEN, SEAN, IT’S LIKE WHAT

182
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:06,807
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID ON THE

183
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:07,541
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

184
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,243
IT’S NOT ABOUT ME.

185
00:07:09,243 --> 00:07:10,144
IT’S ABOUT US.

186
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:13,147
I THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE DAMAGE

187
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,616
THIS DID TO OUR VOLUNTEERS ON

188
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:16,784
THE COMMITTEE.

189
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,919
LOOK WHAT IT DID TO SAM.

190
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,588
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE

191
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:22,790
HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH HIM IN

192
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,691
A YEAR AND A HALF.

193
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:26,293
ALL OF THE SUPPORT HE GAVE

194
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:28,195
TALKING THROUGH THE LIES PUT OUT

195
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,865
BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND FAKE

196
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:34,435
MEDIA OUTLET.

197
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:40,174
>> IT’S LIKE A SIEVE FROM THE

198
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,876
CITY COUNCIL’S OFFICE.

199
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:45,179
SAM, HOW WAS YOUR LIFE IMPACTED

200
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,581
BY ALL OF THIS?

201
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,850
YOU ARE LAUGHING, BUT I DON’T

202
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,650
THINK IT’S FUNNY.

203
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,487
>> I’M CALM.

204
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,589
I HAVE GREAT FAITH.

205
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,557
IT’S GOOD TO COMMUNICATE WITH

206
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:57,325
CARTER AGAIN.

207
00:07:57,325 --> 00:07:59,627
ONE OF THE REASONS, I LEFT

208
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:00,628
GOVERNMENT THREE WEEKS AGO.

209
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:02,597
I WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION.

210
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:04,899
I LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION.

211
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,836
ONE OF THE REASONS, THERE WERE

212
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:10,538
MANY, BUT ONE OF THE REASONS I

213
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,807
LEFT, I WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFEND

214
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:13,141
MYSELF.

215
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:14,509
I SAID THAT’S ENOUGH.

216
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,212
I’M TAKING THE MUZZLE OFF.

217
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,381
I’M GOING TO TELL EVERYONE WHAT

218
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,782
THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT.

219
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,118
WHAT MICHAEL AND CARTER TALKED

220
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,686
ABOUT, I AGREE WITH MICHAEL.

221
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:27,722
THEY HAVE COME AT US IN MULTIPLE

222
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,025
DIRECTIONS AND AVENUES AND FROM

223
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,259
MULTIPLE AGENCIES.

224
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,794
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED

225
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,097
TO KNOW, THIS IS THE WORST

226
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,332
POSSIBLE ABUSE OF POWER AT

227
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,268
TAXPAYER EXPENSE.

228
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,104
I HAVE TAKEN THE OATH OF OFFICE

229
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,304
THREE TIMES.

230
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:46,074
I HAVE SWORN MY OATH TO THE

231
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:47,176
CONSTITUTION THREE TIMES.

232
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,578
WE HAVE ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

233
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:52,748
MANY HIGH RANKING PEOPLE IN THE

234
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,616
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT TOOK

235
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,152
THE SAME OATH, AND THEY WOULDN’T

236
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:59,188
KNOW IT IF IT BIT THEM ON THE

237
00:08:59,188 --> 00:08:59,488
BUTT.

238
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:02,091
>> THAT’S A POWERFUL STATEMENT.

239
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,260
MICHAEL, YOU NEARLY LOST YOUR

240
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,960
HOUSE.

241
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,295
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STEPPED UP

242
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,797
TO HELP YOU.

243
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,197
REAL QUICK.

244
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,433
>> THEY REALLY DID.

245
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,802
IF IT WEREN’T FOR THE AMERICAN

246
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,770
PEOPLE GIVING MONEY TO PAY FOR

247
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,306
MY LEGAL FEES AND MORE, I’M

248
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,208
STARTING TO PAY OTHER PEOPLE’S

249
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,744
LEGAL FEES, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

250
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:25,047
TODAY, I SPENT PHOTOCOPYING

251
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,250
PAPERS ABOUT A JEALOUS HUSBAND,

252
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,886
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE

253
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,187
ELECTION, JUST FOR ROBERT

254
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,255
MUELLER.

255
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:34,223
THAT’S HOW RIDICULOUS THIS IS.

256
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:37,827
>> ACCIDENT MORE ON LAWYERS.

257
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,728
>> LAST WORD.

258
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,598
>> THE SENATE SHOULD DEMAND SAM

259
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:45,935
IS BROUGHT ON AS THE

260
00:09:45,935 --> 00:00:00,000
UNDERSECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.
