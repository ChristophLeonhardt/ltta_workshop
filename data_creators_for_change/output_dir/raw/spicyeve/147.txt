Hey Youtube World! It's me, Evelyn. Time to
deck the gotdang halls - am I right??!!!

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,740
If you're looking for a fun DIY craft that
you can do this holiday, this Christmas season,

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,500
I've got just the thing for you.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,000
*smirk*

5
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,230
Heaux Heaux Heaux.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,630
*children booing*

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,710
DIY sharpie mugs are all over the Pinterest
internets. If you know Cajuns, you know that

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,300
"eaux" is the French version of the "o" sound.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,950
Thibodeaux. Boudreaux. Comeaux. So I thought
"heaux heaux heaux" was a really cute thing

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,010
to put on a mug.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,940
So to make your heaux heaux heaux holiday
sharpie mug, you will need a mug!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,940
I would not go out to like, Target and buy
a $3 mug. I would actually recommend you go

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,060
to some place like the dollar store and get
one of those cheap, 99 cent mugs.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,010
The reason for this is because the glaze on
these cheapie mugs ensure that when you write

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,510
on it with a sharpie and then you bake it
in the oven, that it will stay.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,300
If you get these high quality mugs with high
quality glazes, you run the risk of the sharpie

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,440
just coming off even if you use the correct
sharpie.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Speaking of which! You have to find oil-based
paint sharpies. These paint markers are able

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,180
to draw on metal, wood, pottery, rubber, glass,
plastic, stone.

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,180
They are expensive. Right here?!!? $20 bucks!
But hey - you can make like 75 sharpie mugs.

21
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:38,370
This is not yo 99 cent sharpie that's in your
backpack. And you just shake 'em up like this

22
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,370
to activate them.

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,490
They come with the instructions on the pen,
but yeah - make sure you get these oil based

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,500
paint sharpies.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,500
You can always free-hand the words onto the
mug, but I bought some stencils. And this

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,030
really helped me to keep the letters as uniform
as possible. It is not perfect because at

27
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,680
the end of the day it is still hand drawn,
but I did have these stencils as a guide.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,940
Alright, so the directions are pretty straightforward.
You just place a stencil onto the mug, and

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,850
using a color of your choice in the oil-based
pain sharpie, go ahead and stencil in the

30
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,260
letters.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,470
If you mess up, like I do all the time, don't
worry - just get a q-tip or like, a little

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:27,100
paper towel and dip it in some rubbing alcohol
or some nail polish remover and just scrub

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,060
the mistake off the mug.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,650
It should come off pretty easily. Do not preheat
your oven. Just place the mug into a cold

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,650
oven, then set it to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
Let it bake for about 30 minutes, take it

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,349
out, and let it cool.

37
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:52,349
And den voila! You have a sharpie mug that's
perfect for your egg nogs, your spiked ciders,

38
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:59,349
your hot chocolates, younawwmsayin you're
chais. It's perfect, it's cozy, it's cute.

39
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,280
And it's all yours alright?!!!

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,010
