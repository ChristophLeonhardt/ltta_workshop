00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the media very close to where Donald</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rules straight and security precaution</font>

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,750
very soon we'll find out whether the

arrows can be pointing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same</font>

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head-to-head meeting lasted two</font>

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,689
times longer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally expected</font>

11
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we were only allowed to film the</font>

first<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 seconds she was only Donald</font>

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,229
any specific arrangements for the u.s.

23
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,290
to work together with Russia in Syria<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

24
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,020
any of these kind of arrangements were

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">made today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or discussed one little thing</font>

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,610
I might add to that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the helping of</font>

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,430
people helping of people because you

28
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,600
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> such horrible if you see and I've</font>

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,790
seen reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've seen pictures I've</font>

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,240
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about everything and if we can</font>

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,650
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people of Syria</font>

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">get back into some form of shelter and</font>

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,070
on a humanitarian<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis and that's what</font>

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,409
the word was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a humanitarian basis</font>

35
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,090
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that both of us would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,070
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are we</font>

37
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,100
will do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon it will be two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,729
since Donald Trump<font color="#E5E5E5"> was elected but guess</font>

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">what still worries the entire u.s.</font>

all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions from this part of the</font>

44
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,080
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> were about that and it was rather</font>

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,510
fascinating to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leaders</font>

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,630
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> teamed up to dodge these kind of</font>

47
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,090
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> however none of this seemed to</font>

48
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,640
convince American journalists and while

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,440
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at them when they were</font>

though when they were heading towards

the doors<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could only see smiles on</font>
