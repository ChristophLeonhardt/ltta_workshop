00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,299
I CAN SAY FROM COVERING HIM FOR AS LONG AS I DID FROM

164
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,601
AS LONG AS I DID FROM INTERACTING WITH HIM THE WAY

165
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:29,305
INTERACTING WITH HIM THE WAY THAT I DID, HE HAS A PERSONAL

166
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:30,873
THAT I DID, HE HAS A PERSONAL AVERSION, A REVULSION, IF YOU

167
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:32,908
AVERSION, A REVULSION, IF YOU WILL, TO LOOKING WEAK.

168
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,210
WILL, TO LOOKING WEAK. AND TO BEING SOMEBODY WHO IS

169
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:37,213
AND TO BEING SOMEBODY WHO IS UNWILLING TO SAY THE MEAN THING,

170
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,281
UNWILLING TO SAY THE MEAN THING, THE HONEST THING AND JUST TO

171
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,481
THE HONEST THING AND JUST TO MAKE MY POINT ON WHAT HE WAS

172
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,216
MAKE MY POINT ON WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE WITH THE DICTATORS

173
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:43,018
DOING THERE WITH THE DICTATORS IS THAT HE’S WILLING TO SAY WHAT

174
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,286
IS THAT HE’S WILLING TO SAY WHAT OTHER LEADERS WOULD NOT SAY,

175
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,921
OTHER LEADERS WOULD NOT SAY, WHICH IS, YES, I KNOW WHAT THEY

176
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,322
WHICH IS, YES, I KNOW WHAT THEY DO BUT IT’S MORE IMPORTANT I GET

177
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:49,225
DO BUT IT’S MORE IMPORTANT I GET AN ARMS DEAL EVEN THOUGH THAT

178
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:50,393
AN ARMS DEAL EVEN THOUGH THAT ARMS DEAL IS THE WAY HE

179
00:04:50,427 --> 00:04:51,527
ARMS DEAL IS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES IT IS NOT ACCURATE

180
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:52,995
DESCRIBES IT IS NOT ACCURATE EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT IT’S

181
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,397
EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST BUT IT’S MORE FOR HIM IT’S SAYING BEING

182
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,699
MORE FOR HIM IT’S SAYING BEING WILLING TO SAY I’M READY TO DEAL

183
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,100
WILLING TO SAY I’M READY TO DEAL WITH THIS PERSON REGARDLESS OF

184
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:00,102
WITH THIS PERSON REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO IN THEIR HOME

185
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:02,037
WHAT THEY DO IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES BECAUSE I CAN --

186
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,406
COUNTRIES BECAUSE I CAN -- THERE’S A TRANSACTIONAL

187
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:04,540
THERE’S A TRANSACTIONAL RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN BE HAD.

188
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,142
RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN BE HAD. IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU DO,

189
00:05:06,143 --> 00:05:07,743
IT DOESN’T MATTER WHAT YOU DO, THE MEANS JUSTIFY THE ENDS AND

190
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:08,844
THE MEANS JUSTIFY THE ENDS AND THE ENDS ARE THAT I’M GOING TO

191
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:09,845
THE ENDS ARE THAT I’M GOING TO GET A BETTER DEAL.

192
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,780
GET A BETTER DEAL. >> IN FAIRNESS A LOT OF HIS
