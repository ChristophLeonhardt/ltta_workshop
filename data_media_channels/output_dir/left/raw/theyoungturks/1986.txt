00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,220
we had two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ban on the show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,540
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we banned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them is not because</font>

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we disagreed with them but because we</font>

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,960
thought they were actors who were just

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get attention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their names were</font>

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ann Coulter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald Trump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,469
literal<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a band for years and</font>

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,580
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would never talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about their</font>

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,960
stories<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it was obvious that they</font>

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,400
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to troll the whole</font>

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately it worked so now</font>

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,650
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a choice and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trump is</font>

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">president and Culture is to some degree</font>

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,599
dictating policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Trump</font>

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,279
talked about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> daca</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal Coulter</font>

16
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,000
yelled at him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I guess he was</font>

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
chastised by that and and decided well I

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,340
have to appease<font color="#E5E5E5"> Coulter and and the kind</font>

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,320
of monsters that<font color="#E5E5E5"> she plays into and yeah</font>

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,030
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think she's an actress I debated her</font>

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,320
once that I asked her about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it she</font>

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,059
almost admitted it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then realized</font>

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,920
what she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then back pedaled</font>

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">and was like oh I hate the Browning of</font>

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,969
America<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so she plays a racist on TV</font>

26
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,579
it's really sad that that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,829
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's I mean she's of course has</font>

28
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:00,090
no moral Center that that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> she</font>

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,309
makes a living<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's sad that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

30
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,960
there's enough people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it appeals to</font>

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that she makes a good living</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and Donald</font>

32
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,880
Trump using those same strategies<font color="#E5E5E5"> became</font>

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,619
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> President of the United States so</font>

34
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,689
when she says something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as abhorrent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

35
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,909
maybe we should shoot one to teach him a

lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all recoil and a lot of people</font>

37
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,520
will be outraged<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I bet you there's a</font>

giant<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunk of the country who thinks</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers 20 percent 30 or 40 but it's</font>

41
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,610
a big number

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,210
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at the end of</font>

43
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,799
a though Ann Coulter he gets headlines

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,880
for that we're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and believe what she's saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

48
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,090
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna say like she can talk</font>

49
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Voltaire to pretend that she's</font>

50
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,710
high-minded in some fashion<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we know</font>

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,110
where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose one and kill them to</font>

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,000
send a message it's in the worst prison

<font color="#CCCCCC">apparently thinks that America has not</font>

use this border security thing as an
