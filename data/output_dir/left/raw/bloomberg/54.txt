1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,710
More than three decades after taking down
the New York mafia,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,330
Rudy Giuliani, America’s Mayor, is back
in the spotlight working as President Trump’s

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,320
personal attorney.

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,100
Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani have one major
trait in common

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,000
I think their styles are very similar

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,520
That’s Shannon Pettypiece.

7
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,190
Within 48 hours, Giuliani went on an all-out
media blitz.

8
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,900
PETTYPIECE: He started contradicting
himself quite quickly

9
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,550
GIULIANI: Having something to do with paying
some Stormy Daniels woman $130,000, which

10
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,780
is gonna turn out to be perfectly legal.

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,400
That money was not campaign money.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,860
Sorry, I’m giving you a fact now that you
don’t know.

13
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,400
That’s Andrew Kirtzman, who literally wrote
the book on Giuliani.

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,270
GIULIANI: Funneled through a law firm, and
the president repaid it.

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,140
HANNITY: Oh, I didn’t know -- he did?

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,009
There’s no campaign finance law.

17
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,009
GIULIANI: Zero.

18
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,049
Pettypiece: And I think it was less than 48
hours later had to put out a statement trying

19
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,780
to clarify what he was saying, because his
comments had created even more confusion.

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,619
So while Giuliani’s tenure got off to a
rocky start, why did Trump even pick him to

21
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,020
be his lawyer in the first place?

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,970
Pettypiece: While Giuliani has a lot of experience
with the Justice Department there were a number

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,549
of lawyers who were more suited to deal with
the type of investigation like this, who basically

24
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,520
turned the President down because of conflicts
or concerns about what would happen to their

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,079
reputation for working for this controversial
president.

26
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,329
So then what does Giuliani actually bring
to the table?

27
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,539
Kirtzman: Giuliani was brought on as much
to be Trump’s lawyer as to be Trump’s

28
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:02,539
confidant.

29
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:07,130
Pettypiece: He is someone that the President
trusts and that can communicate with the President

30
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,169
in a clear, straight way that he'll understand..

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,140
And this trust comes from decades of Trump
and Giuliani running in New York circles.

32
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,100
Pettypiece: When Giuliani was with the Justice
Department in New York, he was there as a

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,830
very high-profile prosecutor and Donald Trump
was in New York as a very high-profile businessman

34
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,050
and real estate developer.

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,040
They both inhabited the same world.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
That world was New York City in the 70s and
80s.

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,630
In 1983 Giuliani became the Manhattan U.S.
Attorney who took on the mob.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,100
And he did so in an extremely public way,
holding press conference after press conference,

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,890
in what was up until that point, a very press-shy
job.

40
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,600
Pettypiece: He was the type of prosecutor
who was on the cover of newspapers and the

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,820
cover of magazines

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,980
On November 20th, 1986, Giuliani won the conviction
of all eight defendants in the massive mafia

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,380
commission trial.

44
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,230
And then…in 1993, he became the first Republican
mayor of New York since 1965.

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,400
He ran on the platform of reducing crime,
and he delivered.

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,520
In the early 90’s New York was crime-ridden
with a dwindling middle class.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,190
By the millenium, violent crime in the city
dropped 56 percent.

48
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,850
However, by the end of his second term, his
polls were lagging, and his legacy was about

49
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,160
to be “the mayor who cleaned up New York
City”, but then…

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,120
“So this looks like it is some sort of concerted
effort to attack the World Trade Center.”

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,610
Pettypiece: And that's when he moved from
being Daily News, New York Post cover famous,

52
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,940
to being a famous figure across America.

53
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,740
OPRAH: He’s the mayor of New York City -- Rudy
Giuliani!

54
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,319
Kirtzman: He was time magazine’s person
of the year, he was a natural presidential

55
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,290
contender.

56
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,220
So he decided to run for president.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,740
GIULIANI: I believe we can hand our nation
to the next generation, better than it was

58
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
handed to us.

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,060
And the GOP nomination was there for the taking.

60
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:09,330
Kirtzman: He was far and away more popular,
and also better known than his republican

61
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,970
competitors as a result of 9/11.

62
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,220
But he made some catastrophic campaign decisions.

63
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,440
And there was also his 9/11 problem...

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,820
TOM BROKAW: Joe Biden had one of the best
lines of the campaign when he said...

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,840
JOE BIDEN: Rudy Giuliani, there’s only three
things he mentions in a sentence: A noun,

66
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
a verb, and 9/11.

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
I mean, there’s nothing else.

68
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
Giuliani’s poll numbers plummeted, and he
didn’t secure a single state for the GOP

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
nomination.

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Kirtzman: His political career was wrecked.

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
. And so he went back into kind of private
practice, but basically, he was out of action.

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
But in 2016, an opportunity.

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Giuliani: But what I did for New York, Donald
Trump will do for America!

74
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Giuliani hitched his wagon to the Trump train,
and while he was passed over for multiple

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
cabinet positions when Trump became president,
being appointed as Trump’s council has thrust

76
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
him back into the spotlight.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
But no matter what may happen from here, it
probably won’t really affect his true legacy...

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Pettypiece: I think the most memorable image
of him will always be in America's minds on

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
those days after 911.

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Kirtzman: He’s a person who took on the
mob and had extraordinary results, and then

81
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
turned around New York City, and then led
America through its worst crisis.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Those are accomplishments of a lifetime.
