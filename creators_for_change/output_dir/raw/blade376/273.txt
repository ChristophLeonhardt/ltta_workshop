other day I had a concept come to mind

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,450

00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,669
metaphor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to why we are on this website</font>

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,250
and what we get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it exactly a</font>

clear-cut responses than similar videos

<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering what was inside my box I chose</font>

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,920
a webcam as to me it represents a

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
segment in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the archetype of video</font>

20

creativity passion and inspiration

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,050
youtube becomes your outlet to capture

your world and post it on the internet
