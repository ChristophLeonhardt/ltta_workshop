tyt or use the code tyt a federal judge in San Diego has issued a ruling in regard to donald trump's zero tolerance policy and how he separated children from their parents as they were seeking asylum at the border now this judge US District Judge Dana Sabra argues that not only does Trump have to stop separating these families which is executive order essentially indicates he will do but there needs to be more specificity in regard to how these children will be reunited with their parents so the federal judges Hank Diego blocked any future family separations and ordered the government to reunite all separated families within 30 days adding the children under five years old who have been torn from their parents must be returned within 14 days and all parents must be put in phone contact with their children within 10 days so this case was brought to the federal judge by the ACLU they're representing three different families that have suffered the consequences of Trump's horrible draconian policies and I want to give you some of their stories because it gives you a sense of how disastrous this has been for some people a mother from Guatemala has only spoken once to her child since they were separated in mid-may and also an asylum seeker from Honduras does not know where her daughter is and has not been able to speak to her at all and so in this ruling the judge also said yeah executive order is not going far enough because there has been no plan put in place in regards to how these people are going to be reunited with their children yes so I want to build on that first of all is the lawyers themselves explain that where are you to make sure that they could bring the families together as quickly as possible they said look some families do talk to each other a couple of times a week some rarely and but others they have no idea where their kids are and and and the judge agreed and the judge said where was the plan on how to reunite the families so you guys split them up now we're in a court of law show me the plan where you're gonna put them back together they're like what did I tell you about Trump totally incompetent couldn't manage his way out of a wet paper bag he has no management skills none so if you're gonna split the kids from their families at a bare minimum shouldn't you think through oh wait how do we get him back together nope didn't come up with a plan so this judge I was appointed by a well-known liberal named George W Bush yes so it is not a liberal judge it is a conservative judge and it still the judge is like oh so wait you're gonna separate families which by the way the United States Supreme Court has ruled over and over again is actually the most sacrosanct thing there is separating kids from their parents they're like the Supreme Court is obsessed with property rights in this capitalist country and a value that tremendously this is valued so much higher than property rights that gives could serve as a national even more than property rights yeah I mean imagine if they took your kids away you'd go belissa Majan of a liberal government big government came in separating you from your kids right so conservative judges rightly go no this is you have to have an extraordinary standard for why you have a compelling state interest to separate these families and then you come into my court and tell me you don't even have any plan to put them back together and you can't find some of them and some of the parents have not spoken their kids and have no idea where they are no no this policy is not going to stand that it's not constitutional and so one more thing that you got to understand about the law and I wish Donald Trump understood it the fifth amendment guarantees all of us due process but not just citizens and I see right-wingers making this mistake all the time online unsurprising they don't know much about the law but there you go well do not do every rights yes that's actually not true because you've never read the Constitution the Fifth Amendment guarantees due process process to persons not citizens and there's good reason for that so if there's a tourist here who is not a citizen or named any other category that's not a citizen we can't just shoot them in the head and go whatever you know rights to due process or more relevant here the government can't just lock them up and not give you a due process so you have to show that before a court and they might have different rights than a citizen but they got to go to court they have to have due process and and here Trump keeps saying well what do we need judges for we're gonna get from bbq's what do we need I have actually do want to go to that video but before we go to that video I have to make two points before I forget so first point is yes you're absolutely right this federal judge who issued this ruling was a George W Bush appointee which makes you realize how far to the right the country has gone under the Trump administration and during the Bush administration I remember thinking oh my god we are such a right-wing country so if things have gotten even more extreme to the right second point I wanted to make was in response to what you said about Trump not having a plan Trump never has a plan Brooke Trump does things for political gains everything he does is for show you think that he sits down and thinks about the nuance of any issue or thinks about a real strategy or has any interest any intellectual curiosity about the proper way to go about policy no of course not he's doing things because it looks tough to his base and his base will eat it up then will eat it up he's being tough on immigration they love it they don't care if there's no plan to reunite the kids with the family they don't care that it's actually costing them a lot more in taxpayer money to deal with this ridiculous zero-tolerance policy they don't care they just want the toughness and the same goes for North Korea he did it all just to make it seem as though he's a tough guy and he's a good negotiator with North North Korea when North Korea hasn't given us anything in fact there's a story out today where satellite images show that North Korea has continued on with their nuclear okay so the schmuck he's a schmuck yes now you want further proof of his schmuck Ness take a look at him talking about hiring judges to deal with this immigration issue somebody touches our land we now take them to a court to a judge they want us to choose 5,000 judges how do you choose 5,000 judges can you imagine the corruption just from a normal standpoint just common sense can you imagine the corruption go to the barbershop grab somebody make them a judge everybody's being managed it went 5,000 judges okay let's break it down first of all reporters in the country trying to figure out what on God's green earth he's talking about when he references 5,000 judges they could not find any reference to any proposal that involves 5,000 judges to give you a context the number of judges we have on immigration issues is a little over 300 for the whole country okay federal judges is 1,300 that's it 1,300 who's saying let's bring in 5,000 new federal judges to do this no one he just made it up because he's a pathological liar and he's like is it a good show about getting good ratings I said 5,000 judges let's seem like a big number did I do that right right no you didn't do it right cuz you you're an imbecile and you don't care about anything at all and then look at the mindset what are we just gonna grab them from barbershops why just from barbershop you think judges come from like there does that guy know how to do it good fade yep judge okay and he goes any and this is the second time he's emphasized this where he's like imagine the corruption why would there be corruption in a pointing of judges why cuz Trump thinks I know when I'm dealing with a judge I want to do a little bit of corruption so if they're getting new judges everybody's gonna want to do corruption cuz that's what's in his head it wouldn't across my mind would it have cost your mind hey we need more judges at the border ho people are obviously gonna buy him off I am all for what right the people coming in have no money at all they have nobody that's nothing like they're going to corrupt the federal judge the immigration judges by the way so there's been one person who has proposed hiring more immigration judges that has been Ted Cruz that was his proposal nowhere near five thousand judges by the way Trump completely made that number up and by the way you know who wanted more more immigration judges the schmuck who wanted to prosecute anyone who tried to come to the United States even though seeking asylum zero tolerance policy what do you think prosecution means I mean trucks should know Trump should know better than anyone in the country what prosecution means but that's but that's exactly at Ana he doesn't believe in due process so that's why when they asked them well how do you think you're gonna implement this policy because you want zero tolerance means we have to prosecute the people coming across the border instead of sending them back and he's like what he literally said what do we need judges for I just what we're gonna do trials without judges I'm just I'm gonna I'm just gonna put myself in the shoes of a rose' all day girl and say I just can't with this guy and by the way Sarah Huckabee Sanders when asked about it she's like due process doesn't necessarily mean judges that's exactly what it means that's exactly what it means two easy ways for the Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you
