well it's election day and voters in four states including Wisconsin Vermont Minnesota and Connecticut will head to the polls to make their picks ahead of November's elections in Wisconsin eight Democrats will face off to challenge the incumbent Governor Scott Walker who was seeking his third term meanwhile Democrats will see a three-way battle for Minnesota's open governor spot between congressman Tim waltz state representative Erin Murphy and state attorney general Lori Swanson on the Republican side former two-term Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty will try to win back his old job squaring off against county commissioner Jeff Johnson joining us now co-founder and CEO of Axios Jim VandeHei Jim good morning good to see you so you're looking at the five most competitive House races in the midterm elections which turns out are all ones held by Republicans what are you looking at yeah almost every competitive race right now is a Republican race but we talked to strategists on both sides to figure out one of the five true toss-up some ones that people should watch and all of those are held by Republicans districts like most of Maine Maine second District which is everything other than Portland and Augusta basically a lot of big chunk of Trump country they're a state or a district that hasn't flipped from an incumbent in a hundred years and Republicans are very worried about that you've got Texas is 23rd district which is a Southwest slice of Texas again a pure toss-up again a place where you have a big growing Hispanic population Republicans worried there and the reason like for viewers that to understand why Republicans are so worried is they look at those special election results which you guys have talked a lot about and they look at other off-year elections and in every single one of those races more Democrats are voting than ever before and so that's a trend that continues throughout each and every race and seems to be building and when you get that kind of momentum that's when you get a wave that's when you get a massive loss on Election Day and that's why Republican House leaders when you talk to them in private they they see very few scenarios where they escaped with the majority it's it's plausible but with each passing day it seems more unlikely hey Jim the compass are here so obviously there's a a huge amount of passion for President Trump with his base we hear all the time about Trump's base how much they love him so why is that not enough in this election what's the countervailing pressure that will shape a midterm with the usual kind of low turnout we see Trump is the mailing pressure at a trunk right because he basically yes there's a lot of Republicans who love him and they'll turn out there's a lot of Democrats who hate him and will turn out and you often need a negative emotion you often need anger to actually get people off their butts and to vote on Election Day and Democrats historically are not great voters in off-year elections but they dislike Trump so much that they're turning out the other problem is that while Trump turns on most of the Republican Party there is a small slice of sort of traditional Republicans the one Jo's talking about a lot on the show that don't like Trump and will not vote for him and if they go with the Democrat especially in these suburban districts that's where you could have a wipeout not just a loss of 23 or 24 seats but if if they start to move you can see 3040 seats being in play in going into the Democrats hands so when you step back and you look at that map of 435 races there's about 60 to 70 that are authentically in play almost all of those are Republican seats and they don't have enough money they don't have good enough candidates they don't probably have enough time to turn a lot of those and that's why Democrats feel increasingly good about their chances you know Jim not so long ago Tim Russert famously talked about Florida Florida Florida and we always looked at Florida as the swing state the decider it's really something over the past couple of years the political geographic center has shifted up to your home state in Wisconsin you look at Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan those are the states that elected Donald Trump but Wisconsin in particular seems to be searching for its political identity will it continue to be a left-of-centre state or is it moving hard right what are we going to see today in those primaries in your home state yeah I mean Scott Walker is on the ballot he's been radioactive since he won in 2010 you've got a bunch of Democrats vying to take him on a lot of polls show that that Walker is beatable in that gubernatorial race in all likelihood you're probably going to end up with this guy who is the superintendent for a long time so on the education side and if you remember Walker won after teachers he went after their pensions went after the amount of money that Wisconsin is putting into schools and again like this is sort of it's a little microcosm of Trump's dynamic because the state like Wisconsin run by Republicans Republicans should be killing it the unemployment rate is below four percent in Wisconsin they're bringing in lots of new jobs like life is good it's a good time to live in Wisconsin yet the politics have become so radioactive and the Democrats are more motivated after basically sitting it out because they weren't that motivated by Hillary Clinton so if they have a big day I do think you're right it is microcosm and you're gonna see the same thing potentially in Pennsylvania potentially in Minnesota and the only question now is it does this momentum continue if it continues it's impossible to see Republicans keeping control because not that much is going to change between now and Election Day and look at actually Jim I look at other two other periods in time 2006 which was a shock to the political system in many respects I remember well I was on the ballot it was not fun and pretty 2010 where there was this sort of course correction another shock to the political system what does your analysis show potentially as a shock to the system this November if the trend lines continue the way they are how big a shock are you expecting and what do you think the aftermath of that will be for both political parties going into a presidential year I mean the aftermath would be that you're gonna have obviously Democrats feeling like they finally have figured out a formula for winning and that they're gonna use that power because from a lot of liberals who turned out who hadn't voted in the past they're probably gonna turn that into a big push for Medicare for all a big push even if they're silent on it now for impeachment you're gonna have two years of gridlock which you're probably gonna have anyways but if Democrats are in control they're gonna take that subpoena power and it's not just about impeachment it's about all these other things that have been happening in agencies that they don't have the authority to investigate now or the tools to go after Republicans on that they will go after them on and so you're gonna have either way you're gonna have a mess after the election probably a bigger mess in even more radioactive politics if Democrats take control and then you're gonna have Republicans continuing to have this identity crisis where 80% of the party likes Trump and likes the direction he's pulled a party in but there is at John Kasich part of the party there is a Scarborough part of the party that is deeply deeply deeply uncomfortable with that direction and if they can point to places like these suburban districts and say look at these are things that we should be winning we've got a great economy the tax cuts just kicked in and yet we're losing them because of trumpism I think it will it will light that debate on fire yeah no doubt about it Jim VandeHei thank you so much thank you thank you and and boy you know what Willie it was it was really interesting you had yeah Donald Trump attacking John Kasich as a very unpopular governor of Ohio we're of course gonna show those numbers but I'm just gonna let you guess who's far more popular in the state of Ohio John Kasich or Donald Trump well that's an easy one I think the president might also be holding on to the fact that John Kasich beat President Trump in the Republican primary in 2016 by double digits in the state of Ohio double digits and he's still ahead by double digits in the state of Ohio and yet Donald Trump saying he's deeply unpopular well we thank Jim VandeHei and coming up next on Morning Joe new reports of blurred lines that we're seeing between private business and the presidency how White House staffers are getting special perks at Trump's golf club that's still ahead on Morning Joe and we'll be asking Heidi all about it thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you
