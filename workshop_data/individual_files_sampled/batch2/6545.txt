federal judge has dismissed Exxon's efforts to block a climate change investigation into that company because it's trying to determine the extent of Exxon's climate cover-up so Exxon has been covering things up we know for an awful long time we've know that scientists have come out and said that they were talking about climate change is 20 years ago were they saying we're concerned about climate change we think this is a problem this is there this is their in-house scientist saying this as a matter of fact I don't know I don't remember exactly the number of articles but it was it was well into the hundreds of articles or investigation pieces that were done internally by the company they did studies internally by the company and they found that uh that less than 11 percent of those studies the information from those studies actually made it out to the public and what they did is whitewashed those the other ninety percent of the studies or 89 percent of studies stayed within the company files and we know that now because whistleblowers are coming forward and saying that so here you have a company Exxon saying she weren't really we're we're victim aren't there they're trying to call themselves a victim here aren't that yeah they they claim that these investigations were violating their constitutional rights because you know it was all this trumped up climate change charges and you know oh well we didn't cover anything up you can't look at our stuff you can't go in here but but listen to a couple years ago massive treasure trove of documents internal documents from Exxon came out and they actually I I went through these documents it was a very unfund project but 1940s is when that company first discovered that the burning of their oils was bad for the environment 1940s now and this was decades before the terms climate change or global warming or greenhouse effect even came into existence they sat on it and at that time that's when they realized you know right after World War two we've got to do something to prevent this from happening in the 1970s with the Lewis Powell memo on the cover up attack judges let's slow down here this is an important bar the story Lewis Powell the same Lewis Powell who was Supreme Court justice people you know they think of Lewis Powell is the brilliant guy what a what a legacy he left mine well no his legacy is pretty ugly yeah Lewis Powell's legacy is downright nasty and it has to do with exactly what you were talking about he was the guy that was trying to figure out how do we go after the naysayers how do we go after people who are criticizing tell us that story well he he specifically he wanted to go after lawyers he wanted to paint lawyers in this country in a negative light that's where the ambulance chaser talking point do it originated from his donkey right you know that's what people took in a room with him the other part of it was to attack science attack scientists create phony organizations funded by industry to go after these people and that's what exon exon pioneered it and not just attacking a scientist they went out of their way to pay scientists offering these huge sums of money ten fifteen thousand dollars to ride fantasy yeah if you were willing to come out and write a story saying that climate change isn't real well so what but I think what's interesting about this lewis powell if you ask lewis powell you're gonna hear p always brilliant jurist know he was a thug lewis powell was they thug and he's the one that started this whole idea about attack science ok attack science when science comes out and says something tell the lie enough times it was almost a joseph gurbles kind of thing that that lewis powell adopted and Lewis Powell then said there's always somebody in the United States we can find who will write something that's good for us if we pay enough money go after the advocacy groups the people who are out front who are saying you know you're killing our children you're killing our environment go after them not in a nice way prosecute them if you can discredit them if you can this is Lewis Powell we're talking about okay then what was the other part of it the other part was yeah come with front groups fantasy front groups and call the thing that you're talking about something that sounds innocuous like legislation for a better world well legislation for a better world may mean we want to pollute more streams and get away with it that was all Lewis Powell exon took that model and put it on steroids didn't they they absolutely did and that's what this investigation is trying to find out and the worst part here though I I have to say this about this this lawsuit against exon is it's not because they destroyed the planet it's because the climate cover-up could eventually hurt the financial status of their shareholders so in spite of the fact that they've destroyed the planet for future generations that doesn't matter what matters is that you hurt the pocketbooks of already wealthy people and that's why this started now it's going to be great to get this information hopefully something good comes out of it but I said these are attorney generals in these states you understand these are attorney generals who are asking for this information and so Exxon has been blocking them and there's finally this New York Manhattan judge says what what are you talking about they can't give the information because it violates your constitutional right to commit a crime if you read it that's what they're saying we have a constitutional right to cover up what we don't want to cover up so we can make money that's I mean if you really drill down to their argument in this judge like I said are you freakin crazy and so what ends up happening is now they now now we have a right to take a look at it maybe these attorney generals if they're aggressive enough they're obviously aggressive they're sticking with it and so now I just wonder what ends up happening sometimes with attorney generals and I'm not saying it's gonna happen here but attorney generals are moving through attorney generals their attorney generals are moving up to run for governor they're running for Senate and so sometimes meaningful sustained change doesn't take place there what has to happen is some of these these children's lawsuits that are taking place those have to stick you got kids out in California that are suing Exxon for basically creating an environment that's going to kill them and they're too right and the judge has said you know what I'm gonna let this go we're gonna see where it goes we'll revisit it on a motion to dismiss we'll revisit it summary judgment we'll revisit it another time but I'm not going to dismiss the claim because they have standing to do that that's what has to happen and and once we get this information from this investigation of these attorneys general that can be used that's something that these these kids that our children's trust is the group that they can use for their lawsuits but again it is disappointing exons not in trouble for lying to the public for decades they are they're in trouble for covering up from their shareholders
