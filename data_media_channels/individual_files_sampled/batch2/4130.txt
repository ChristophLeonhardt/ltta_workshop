in Arizona at this hour the McCain family gathering at the funeral home while at the State Capitol thousands are already lining up on a very hot day to bid a final farewell to the senator he will lie in state and what would have been his 82nd birthday today joining me now is Republican Arizona Senator Jeff Flake who will be giving the benediction at today's memorial service senator my condolences to you I know this has been such a difficult time no matter how long you prepare the family prepares and you're part of the extended family you're never really ready for this right it's a loss for all of us all seven million-plus Arizonans but 330 million plus Americans as well it's a big loss and to have this on his birthday as a special time here at the Capitol senator tell us about the last time you talked to him how did you say your farewell know I've been well thank you I've been up to the ranch on a number of occasions the last time being just the day before he he passed away and it was a sweet time to be there with with his family and surrounding surrounding him there I can tell you he has a wonderful family that has supported him so well and has sacrificed so much for him to be shared by all of us but by the last long conversation I had was earlier in the year we were up at the ranch just sitting out on the deck and watching Oak Creek wander by and for over an hour we sat there and talked about Arizona's past and its future and country's past and future reflected on personalities of the past that he admired and and his hope and optimism that such leaders would rise up in the future you can share with us why you think he chose two former presidents who denied him the presidency by defeating him George W Bush and Barack Obama to eulogize him at the National Cathedral this coming Saturday here in Washington well for one they were good friends of his and that is the thing that we learned from John McCain and he saw Humanity in everybody and his his captors those who tortured him in Vietnam and his political opponents and I think it's perfectly fitting and I I think he wanted the statement made as well that that we ought to see the good in our opponents that these political battles are just political battles and in the end we're all Americans we're all friends I hope that's what we take from all of these ceremonies is you know we ought to be kinder and see the humanity in our opponents is it also implicitly a rebuke to the current president I'd prefer to see it just as a way to to say that we can we can get past get past these political contests you know this week and I hope we can emphasize the positive when the positive is that we have people of a different party and of his own party who defeated him and in politics one time or another and they are gonna say wonderful things about him at his funeral that should tell us a lot about John McCain and how we could be better I'm very struck by the day after a primary election in the Republican Party and the Democratic Party out there in Arizona the voters spoke and you tweeted today and I'm wondering whether it's also in that spirit where you tweeted to both congratulations to Kyrsten Sinema and representative mcsalley for winning their respective primary races last night the seat is now reserved for the first female senator in Arizona's history how cool is that so you're congratulating a Democrat as well as a Republican you bet whether it's a democrat or republican representing Arizona it's going to be the first female senator in Arizona's history in our northern hundred year history that's a wonderful thing we ought to all celebrate that and I hope that it's a good contest in the next three months it's a short general election campaign but such a late primary and I hope that we can get away from the vitriol that usually accompanies these kind of contests and celebrate the fact that you know we're gonna have a change we'll have a female senator for the first time that's a wonderful thing and I wish them both well there was a little bit of action on that front last night also on the Republican side because the president tweeted after martha mcsalley won her primary against two Republican opponents who were certainly a much more hardline than that then she martha mcsalley running in the arizona primary for US senate was endorsed by rejected Senator Jeff Flake and turned it down at first now martha a great US military fighter jet pilot and a highly respected member of congress wins big all caps congratulations it onto November and you responded on Twitter sorry you know Donald Trump I made no endorsement in this race I think the last endorsement I made was in the Alabama race question mark showing the the check who canceled check I thought I needed to remind I made no endorsement in this race I I knew that you know just in a contest like this you know this is the president's party right now much too I think all of our consternation but I'm not I don't feel too good about our future as a Republican party if we just continue to drill down on the base and demonize our enemies and try to win elections without appealing to a broader electorate I am concerned about the party that as for me I'm fine this is I've lived a very charmed political life and 18 years in Washington I've enjoyed every minute of it and I wish both of those who won the respective primaries well do you see a political future for yourself on the national stage I'll never be too far from it I do care about politics and hope we can find a way to move forward that recognizes that we've got to find the center that you know we can't go on simply you know go into the extremes and both from both parties I'm concerned about that so I'll certainly be around five ways to contribute but I also am anxious for this fever to cool just a bit but I'm I'm anxious to play some kind of real well senator we want to thank you and again our condolences I know you're going to be giving the benediction and helping to heal at the service later today and we thank you very very much well thank you and it's a it's a day of both mourning in Arizona and celebration for a wonderful life lived so thank you hey there are chris hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe
