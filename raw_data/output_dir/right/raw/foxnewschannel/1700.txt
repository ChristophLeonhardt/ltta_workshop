26
00:00:46,663 --> 00:00:48,065
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THIS

27
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:50,034

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,246
THEIR GOVERNMENT WILL KEEP THEM

35
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:02,946

COMMITTEE, CAME UP WITH AND IT

44
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,029
DOES ADDRESS THE DACA SITUATION

45
00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:20,497
IN A FAIR WAY, BUT ONLY IN

46
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,633
EXCHANGE FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,869

I'M SURE, BUT IT'S REALLY

53
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,677
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WEIRD STUFF

MIGRATION.

59
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,888
ALL THESE THINGS THAT ARE

60
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,423
MULTIPLIER EFFECTS ON ILLEGAL

61
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,257
IMMIGRATION AND IMMIGRATION

62
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:49,259
AMNESTY IN THIS COUNTRY.

63
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,927
MASSIVE INCREASES IN LEGAL

64
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:52,362
IMMIGRATION, NONE OF IT WOULD BE

65
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:52,830
AFFECTED.

66
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,465
>> THE RISK IS YOU WILL GET AN

67
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:56,867
UNBALANCED BILL WHERE YOU WORK

68
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,935
ADDRESS DACA AND NONE OF THESE

69
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,704
OTHER THINGS AND 180, 190

70
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,505
DEMOCRATS WERE JOINED WITH 30 OR

71
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:04,041
40 REPUBLICANS AND PASS

72
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,244
SOMETHING THAT THE OVERWHELMING

73
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:07,945
MAJORITY OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS

74
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:09,246
AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

75
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,614
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND

76
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,348
CERTAINLY THE REPUBLICAN BASE

77
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:13,250
WOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH

78
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,084
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ADDRESS THE

79
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,220
PROBLEM.

80
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,222
>> Laura: BUT CONGRESSMAN

81
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,289
CABELLO SAID A DISCHARGE

82
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:20,457
PETITION IS PRECISELY THE WAY TO

83
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:20,891
GET THIS DONE.

84
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,429
LET'S WATCH.

85
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:27,264
>> NO ONE HERE IS INTERESTED IN

86
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:28,031
A SPECTACLE.

87
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,633
WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A

88
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,267
DEBATE.

89
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,236
WE ARE ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN

90
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,137
ANSWERING THE PRESIDENT'S CALL

91
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:36,273
TO ACTION IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST

92
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:37,641
YEAR WHEN HE CHALLENGED CONGRESS

93
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,143
TO COME UP WITH A BIPARTISAN

94
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:42,813
SOLUTION TO THIS IMMIGRATION

95
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:43,247
QUESTION.

96
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,648
THIS DISCHARGE PETITION PROCESS

97
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:45,883
IS PROBABLY THE MOST

98
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:47,484
CONSTRUCTIVE EVER BECAUSE WE ARE

99
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:49,052
NOT BRINGING FORWARD ONE BILL.

100
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:50,454
WE ARE OFFERING THE OPPORTUNITY

101
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:53,657
FOR FOUR BILLS TO COME TO THE

102
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:54,324
FLOOR, INCLUDING ONE THAT'S

103
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,193
BACKED BY IMMIGRATION HARDLINERS

104
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,362
AND ANOTHER THAT WOULD BE

105
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,229
DRAFTED AND FILED BY THE SPEAKER

106
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,365
OF THE HOUSE.

107
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:05,135
>> THE ANSWER IS HE SHOULD WORK

108
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,436
WITH THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

109
00:03:06,436 --> 00:00:00,000
