I'M GREG GUTFELD, KENNEDY, JESSE WATTERS AND JUAN WILLIAMS. THIS IS THE FIVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING AMERICA FIRST FRONT AND CENTER DURING A ROUSING COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AT THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY GRADUATION. THIS COMES AS MORE NEW DEVELOPMENTS UNFOLD OVER THE NORTH KOREA SUMMIT. BUT, BEFORE WE GET TO THAT LET'S HEAR THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO THE CLASS OF 2018 STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR MILITARY'S MIGHT. WE ARE WITNESSING THE GREAT REAWAKENING OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT AND OF AMERICAN MIGHT. WE HAVE REDISCOVERED OUR IDENTITY. REGAINED OUR STRIDE. AND WE ARE PROUD AGAIN. YES, THEY ARE RESPECTING US AGAIN. YES, AMERICA IS BACK. THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT WAR IS TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR WAR. IF A FIGHT MUST COME, THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. VICTORY, WINNING, BEAUTIFUL WORDS. TO THE CLASS OF 2018, I DO SAY STRIFE FOR SAY STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE. LIVE FOR ADVENTURE, DREAM BIG, PUSH FURTHER, SAIL FASTER. NEVER STOP REACHING FOR GREATNESS. Kimberly: MEANWHILE, THE PRESIDENT IS LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN TO RESCHEDULING THE CANCELLED SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA'S KIM JONG UN. THIS AFTER THE ROGUE REGIME SAYS THEY ARE STILL WILLING TO MEET WITH TRUMP AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AT ANY TIME. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW. IT WAS A VERY NICE STATEMENT THEY PUT OUT. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IT COULD EVEN BE THE 12TH. WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW. THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO DO IT. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IT. WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Kimberly: OKAY, GREG. SO GIVING A ROUSING SPEECH. WERE YOU PREPARED FOR THAT? YOU SEEM STUNNED. Greg: TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I SHOULD TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA OR THE AMAZING COMMENCEMENT SPEECH. A COMMENCEMENT SPEECH FOR THE REST OF AMERICA. HE IS SPEAKING A LANGUAGE THAT EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS, INCLUDING OUR ADVERSARIES. SO WHEN HE SAYS STUFF THAT IS CONVEYING AMERICA FIRST AND WE'RE BACK AND WE'RE GREAT, IT'S KIND OF MEANT FOR RUSSIA. IT'S MEANT FOR CHINA. IT'S MEANT FOR NORTH KOREA. IT'S MEANT FOR EVERYBODY WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS IT. I KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IT UPSETS THE ELITES WHO PREFER, YOU KNOW, THE VLACID LEXICON OF THE POLITICAL PLATITUDES THAT HE DOESN'T TRAFFIC IN. SO I THINK THE REST OF THE WORLD GETS IT. EVEN IF MORNING JOE DOESN'T HE HAS HIJACKED THE BULL HORN. BEFORE, HOLLYWOOD WAS WHAT TRANSMITTED OUR VALUES AROUND THE WORLD. AND IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAS TAKEN THE BULL HORN AND SAYS NO, MY TURN. Kimberly: OKAY. THERE YOU GO. GUTFELD SHOW GETS IT SUNDAY SHOW GETS IT JUST NOT MORNING JOE. Kimberly: AMERICA FIRST. VERY WELL RECEIVED VETS. Jesse: VERY WELL RECEIVED. HE SPENT HOURS AFTERWARDS SHAKING HANDS WITH ALL THE CADETS. HE LOVES THESE PEOPLE IN UNIFORM. HE HAS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. MILITARY. HE IS FUNDING THEM TO HEIGHTS THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE TO BUILD FASTER PLANES AND FASTER SHIPS AND MORE MASSIVE NUCLEAR WARHEADS, JUAN. SO, THE AMERICAN MILITARY IS BACK. HE RECOGNIZES IT. IT'S NICE FOR THE COUNTRY TO SEE A PRESIDENT WHO 100 PERCENT SUPPORTS THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE MILITARY. AND HE SAID SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY SMART. YOU WANT TO BUILD THE MILITARY UP TO STRONGLY THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO USE IT AND I THINK THAT'S THE MESSAGE THERE. WHEN IT COMES TO NORTH KOREA, IT'S CLASSIC LIKE YOU SAID YESTERDAY, ART OF THE DEAL. HE IS MOVING. HE IS SHAKING. IS HE ZIGGING AND ZAGGING. THE WHOLE TIME THE PEANUT GALLERY IS TRYING TO THROW SPIT BALLS AT HIM. WAIT 24 HOURS AND NORTH KOREA COMES BEGGING BACK TO THE TABLE. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE MORE DESPERATE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT THAN IS HE TO SIT DOWN WITH THEM. HE CLEARLY HAS THE YOU WERE HAND AND, LIKE WE SAID, WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN SINGAPORE. Kimberly: THERE YOU GO. KENNEDY, HELLO. HI THERE. IT'S A REALLY FUNNY CONTRAST WITH HILLARY CLINTON. THESE ARE TOO VASTLY DIFFERENT SPEECHES. THIS MAY BE THE ONLY HIGH PROFILE SPEECH A CONSERVATIVE GIVES AT A COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT THIS YEAR. AND, OF COURSE, AT THE MILITARY ACADEMY ANNAPOLIS THE PRESIDENT IS NOT GOING TO BE HECKLED. AND THAT ALSO HAS TO BE REFRESHING. IT IS A HAND-PICKED VENUE AND RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE. BUT THESE SPEECHES ARE SO DIFFERENT BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON JUST A WEEK AGO AT YALE WAS SCREECHING TO A VERY BORED AUDIENCE I'M STILL NOT OVER IT AND THE PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO GIVE A MORE FORWARD-LOOKING SPEECH, WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE WITH SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT HE ADDRESSES AND TALKS ABOUT. AND, YES, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND A PAINFUL LOSS AND RELIVING GROUNDHOG DAY EVERY SINGLE DAY, HE IS TELEGRAPHING TO NORTH KOREA AND RUSSIA AND CHINA AND ALSO GETS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS AGENDA. SO, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GOING TO BE TALKING AT ALL THIS YEAR ABOUT COMMENCEMENT SPEECH THAT WASN'T COMPLETELY BUBBLE WRAPPED AND GROUP THINK. FOR THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT REFRESHING. Kimberly: A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOYED THIS ONE. I HOPE YOU DID, TOO. Juan: INTERESTING TO ME COME AND LISTEN TO YOU GUYS A COUPLE PROTESTERS. I DON'T THINK A WHOLE LOT. Jesse: THOSE ARE FOR YOU, JUAN. Juan: INSIDE THE KIDS WERE PRETTY RESPECTFUL. INSIDE YOU CALL IT ROUSING. I'M INTERESTED. LET ME JUST SAY THIS SPEECH WAS ABOUT AMERICA FIRST. IT WAS WRAPPED IN PATRIOTISM. HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE FLAG. HE WRAPPED HIMSELF IN THE MILITARY. I THINK THAT'S, JESSE, WHY HE SPENT TIME. HE WANTS THEM AND THEIR STAMP OF APPROVAL AND THEIR HIGH APPROVAL RATINGS AMONG THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO TRANSFER TO HIM. BUT, WHEN YOU THINK. Jesse: DO YOU THINK IS HE GIVING A ROUSING PATRIOTIC SPEECH BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BOOST HIS APPROVAL RATING? Juan: YES. Kimberly: THROUGH THE CADETS? Juan: LET'S LOOK AT THE SUBSTANCE OF IT. WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT OH, WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MILITARY STRONGER AND ALL THAT WAIT A MINUTE, OUR MILITARY IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD. Jesse: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN STRONGER, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? Kimberly: REBUILDING IT. Juan: SUGGESTING SOMEBODY DIDN'T BELIEVE IN THEM. MILITARY. OBAMA, BUSH, CLINTON? Kimberly: IT WAS UNDER FUND YOU FUNDEDOU FUNDED.U UNDER FUNDED UNDER OBAMA. Juan: THAT IS ECHO IN THE CONSERVATIVE CHAMBER. THE FACT IS WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT SUNDAY IFED AT I THINK THE TOP 20 OTHER MILITARIES IN THE WORLD DON'T HAVE AS MUCH FUNDING AS OUR MILITARY. Kennedy: CAN I JUST SAY THIS? JUAN, LET ME ME AGREE WITH YOU ON SOMETHING. I DO THINK WE SPEND AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY ON THE MILITARY. I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD LOOK AT CUTTING COSTS IN THE MILITARY WITHOUT MAKING OUR COUNTRY LESS SAFE AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR PATRIOTISM AND THE DEBT OF GRATITUDE THAT WE OWE TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM. BUT, ALSO, BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THE MILITARY DOESN'T JUST MEAN WRITING THEM A BLANK CHECK. Juan: I AGREE. Greg: CAN I JUST RESPOND? JUAN, WHEN YOU QUESTION SOMEBODY'S PATRIOTISM. THAT MEANS YOU CAN READ THEIR MIND. IF SOMEBODY IS ACTUALLY EXPRESSING A LOVE FOR A COUNTRY, CAN YOU SAY OH, THAT'S JUST HE IS TRYING TO PLAY TO THIS AUDIENCE. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT TO SAY YOU CLAIM YOU CAN READ HIS MIND. Juan: DID I NOT. YEAH, YOU DID. YOU BASICALLY SAID IT WAS ALL AN APP. HE WAS WRAPPING HIMSELF IN THE FLAG. MAYBE HE LOVES AMERICA. BUT YOU ARE RIDING HIS MIND WHEN YOU ARE SAYING OH, HE IS WRAPPING YOUR BASICALLY SAYING I KNOW WHAT HE IS REALLY DOING. JUAN JAWNEL I LISTENED TO THE SPEECH. THE MAN IS TALKING AMERICA FIRST. Kimberly: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT. Juan: NO MORE APOLOGIES, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT AMERICA FIRST. HOW IS THIS LOOKED AT AROUND THE WORLD IT'S NOT MIND READING IT'S LISTENING. WHAT HE SAID WALLS. Greg: YOU ARE INTERPRETING. Juan: LET ME SPEAK FOR A SECOND. GUT DIVUT FOR A T DIVUT FOR A GDIVUT FOR A GreVUT FOR A Greg:T FOR A Greg: FFOR A Greg: FORR A Greg: FOR AA Greg: FOR A SECOND. Juan: WHAT DOES THE REST OF THE WORLD HEAR AMERICA NO LONGER AS THE GLOBAL LEADER IS HE RETRENCHING AND PULLING BACK AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR AMERICA FIRST. AMERICA IS SUPPOSED TO BE A WORLD LEADER. Kimberly: HE IS THE PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Juan: YES. Kimberly: HE IS NOT PRESIDENT OF NORTH KOREA. Juan: NO, WE ARE INVOLVED THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE INTEREST IN ASIA. Kimberly: WHY CAN'T HE LOOK AT AMERICA FIRST WHAT CAN I DO TO IMPROVE THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE MILITARY THAT SERVE VALIANTLY BY MAKING SURE THEY ARE TAKEN CARE OF, BY MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE V.A.? LOOKING INWARD TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THINGS AND MAKE IT BETTER FOR EVERYBODY ACROSS THE COUNTRY, MAKE US STRONGER AND BETTER AS A NATION. CONTEND KENNEDY ISN'T THAT ONE THE ARGUMENTS OF THE ANTIWAR LEFT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS EMBRACED THAT WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY OVERSEAS. WE HAVE NEEDLESSLY SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHY SHOULDN'T WOULD HE BE INVESTING IT HERE? THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HEAR ELIZABETH WARREN OR BERNIE SANDERS SAY. Juan: I AGREE. Kennedy: THE PRESIDENT IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. Juan: WHAT HE IS SAYING TO THE WORLD IS, I'M GOING TO PULL OUT OF AGREEMENTS LIKE THE IRAN DEAL OR THE CLIMATE DEAL. ASIA DEAL IN TERMS OF MARKETS. BECAUSE I'M GOING TO RENEGOTIATE. I'M A DEALMAKER. AND I'M GOING TO CREATE SOME CHAOS HERE. WHAT DOES THE REST OF THE WORLD HEAR? GEE, YOU ARE NO LONGER PART OF OUR EFFORT AND THE UNITED STATES IS OF OUR EFFORT AND THE UNITED STATES IS CEDING IT'S ROLE. IF YOU WANT TO BE LAST. Juan: I'M NOT SAYING THAT. Jesse: WE HAVE NOT LEFT OUR ALLIES BEHIND WE JUST RALLIED A COALITION IN ASIA AND COALITION IN SYRIA. JUST GOT UNANIMOUS COUNCIL SUPPORT FOR THE U.N. OVER IN NORTH KOREA THERE IS A LOFT THINGS WE ARE DOING LEADING THE WORLD INSTEAD OF GOING ALONG TO GET ALONG LIKE OTHER PRESIDENTS. Juan: LIKE PRINTING COINS LIKE TRUMP AND KIM ON THEM? Jesse: IS HE A BIG INVESTOR. Juan: ARE YOU BUYING THEM Greg: BROUGHT UP TWO DEALS CORRECT DECISION CLIMATE DEAL WOULD HAVE COST 100 TRILLION OVER A CENTURY. GOOD TO PULL OUT OF THAT IRAN, WE KNOW BEN RHODES WAS SO BAD HE HAD TO LIE ABOUT THIS DEAL TO AMERICA. WE NOW KNOW IT'S BAD. THIRD THING GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS NORTH KOREA. PEOPLE ARE ACTING LIKE OH MY GOD, THIS IS SHOCKING. THIS IS SHOCKING THAT HE CANCELLED. FIRST, YOU MUST BE SHOCKED BY THE SUNRISE. THIS IS HOW NEGOTIATIONS GO. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS SEEING THE MEDIA KIND OF HAPPY IF WORLD PEACE MIGHT HIT A SNAG BECAUSE THEY DISLIKE TRUMP SO MUCH. TO THEM TRUMP IS NOT A PRESIDENT. HE IS NO, HE IS YOUR EXTHAT YOU ARE BETTER ABOUT. IF YOUR EX DISCOVERS A CURE TO A DISEASE YOU CAN'T BE HAPPY BECAUSE IS HE YOUR EX. Kimberly: THAT'S CHILD OISH. CAN'T DO THAT YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY WHEN THE DISEASE IS CURED. Greg: THANK YOU. Kimberly: JESSE, ONE MORE THING NOW? Jesse: PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT THE IRAQIS BEHIND. HE LEFT THE UKRAINIANS BEHIND AND THE ISRAELIS BEHIND. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ALLIANCES. Juan: DID YOU NOTICE WHO JUST WON THE ELECTION IN IRAQ? WHAT ABOUT LIBYA? Juan: ANTI-AMERICAN CLERIC. HOW ABOUT THAT?
