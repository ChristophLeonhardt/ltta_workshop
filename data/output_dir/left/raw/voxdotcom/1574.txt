1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:09,309
What is the earliest age that a baby can learn
how to swim?  My family has been testing this

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:14,680
with my nephew. He was only 6 months old when
we enrolled him in classes with a group called

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,500
Infant Swimming Resource. Now, of course he's not "swimming."

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
babies this young aren’t developmentally ready to move themselves forward through the water.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
Instead the goal was to teach him to survive.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,349
I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I first saw these clips. How could

7
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,969
a baby who can’t even walk or talk learn
how to float. I mean, it kind of looks like torture.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,689
But before a month had passed, my nephew proved
me wrong.

9
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:51,880
Every day 2 American families lose a child
to drowning. Drowning deaths are declining

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,170
overall but it is still the #1 killer of kids
ages 1-4, aside from birth defects.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,739
And Arizona, where my nephew lives, has a higher
drowning rate than average, which isn't surprising

12
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:07,670
given that in the Phoenix area, 43% of homes
have a swimming pool.

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,890
These classes they put my nephew in should really be
the 3rd line of defense. The first is a fence

14
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,570
wraps around the pool latches shut, second
is constant supervision.

15
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,500
But if those safeguards fail and a baby slips
into the water, it sounds kind of farfetched but the

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,800
question is what skills, if any, can the baby
use to keep itself alive? That’s where

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,700
ISR comes in
“It’s completely different than other

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,240
programs that are out there.”
This is Jennifer, one of my nephew’s instructors.

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,880
“There’s not a lot of singing and games
even though there’s a ton of positive reinforcement.”

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,290
She told me that unlike other programs where kids
might play in the pool or use floaties, ISR

21
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,430
classes are geared entirely toward preparing
a baby for an emergency situation.

22
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,720
The instructor is shaping his behavior through
basic operant conditioning. When he positions

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,510
his body correctly in a float that behavior
is reinforced with a good breath of air and

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,400
with her picking him up.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,360
They did this every day for a few weeks and
by the end my nephew could put himself into

26
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,290
a float after being tipped in face-down.
They also tested him with clothes on because

27
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,070
in most drowning situations, the child is
clothed.

28
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,040
Now that he’s 1 year old and he's walking, he’s
enrolled in the second set of lessons, which

29
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,340
teaches him to look for the stairs and swim toward them under water, taking breaks to float when he needs

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,490
air on the way.
So is all of this good for him?

31
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,160
Some people worry that this type of lesson
is traumatizing. My nephew certainly doesn't like

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,400
the lessons, and doesn't really like Jennifer.
“If they're not happy with me, I’m the teacher, I’m the bad guy.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,440
But just as long as they’re successful in all the
skills that are being taught.”

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,600
He never developed a fear of the pool.
And his tears don’t seem that different from the

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,030
ones that come when he doesn’t want to take a nap.

36
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,000
They also keep the lessons to just 10 minutes
a day to reduce any health risks of being

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,480
in the pool.
The American Academy of Pediatrics says swimming

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,970
lessons for kids 1 year and up can be
effective in preventing drownings, but they

39
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,030
don’t support programs for babies younger
than that.

40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,270
“The water-survival skills programs for
infants may make compelling videos for the

41
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:33,690
Internet, but no scientific study has yet
demonstrated these classes are effective.”

42
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,480
What they’re really worried about is that
these classes could give parents a false sense

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,770
of security - if they made parents even a little
less vigilant, they would do more

44
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,090
harm than good.
So the doctors are waiting for more data.

45
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,690
But for my family, there’s kind of only one data point that
we really care about right now.

46
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,110
The #1 goal is to make sure he'll
really be tested. But if my nephew does find himself

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:00:00,000
suddenly under water, it won’t be the first
time that he’s had to find his way back up.
