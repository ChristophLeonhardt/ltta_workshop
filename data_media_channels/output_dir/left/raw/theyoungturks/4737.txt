1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,310
POLICE HAVE RELEASED THE DASH
CAM FOOTAGE FROM THE SHOOTING OF

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,499
PHILANDO CASTILE.

3
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:13,770
PHILANDO CASTILE WAS SHOT BY
THE POLICE OFFICER, YANEZ.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,150
HE WAS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO TOLD
YANEZ THAT HE HAD A GUN IN THE

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,220
CAR, AND OF COURSE THAT LED TO A
SHOOTING, AND THE POLICE OFFICER

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,820
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING
WAS PHYSICALLY FOUND NOT

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,050
GUILTY BY A JURY, AND SO IT HAS
BEEN A BIG STORY, BUT ONE THING

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,980
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IS THAT ñ CAM
FOOTAGE; WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,930
IT SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF
HE SAID, SHE SAID SITUATION ñ OR

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,330
HE SAID, HE SAID SITUATION IN
THIS SITUATION, BUT NOW WITH THE

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,540
VIDEO WE HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF
HOW THE SHOOTING WENT DOWN.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,149
I WANT TO WARN YOU GUYS THAT IT
IS DIFFICULT TO WATCH, IT IS

13
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,149
GRAPHIC, BUT WITH THAT SAID, I
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO

14
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,460
SEE EVERYTHING THAT IS OUT THERE
REGARDING THIS CASE, AND THEN

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,640
MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION AS TO
WHAT YOU THINK.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,360
TAKE A LOOK.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:30,869
SIR, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DO
HAVE A FIREARM ON ME.

18
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,590
DON'T REACH FOR IT.

19
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,310
DON'T PULL IT OUT.

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,030
DON'T PULL IT OUT!

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,479
OH MY GOD, YOU JUST KILLED MY
BOYFRIEND.

22
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,200
DON'T PULL IT OUT!

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
DON'T MOVE!

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
FUCK!

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
FUCK!

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
FUCK!

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
FUCK!

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
OH MY GOD!

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
OH MY GOD!

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
DON'T MOVE!

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
DON'T MOVE!

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
OH MY GOD!

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
OH MY GOD I'M SHAKING.

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
DON'T MOVE!

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
DON'T MOVE BABY.

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,409
DON'T MOVE BABE, PLEASE.

37
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,170
OKAY, SO, HERE'S WHAT THE VIDEO
CLARIFIED FOR ME; I WAS UNDER

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,659
THE ASSUMPTION, AND BASED ON HOW
THIS STORY WAS REPORTED,

39
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,860
MULTIPLE TIMES, THAT HE WAS
ASKED FOR HIS ID, AND THAT'S

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,020
WHEN HE WAS REACHING FOR HIS ID,
AND GOT SHOT THEN, BUT HE

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,629
HAD ACTUALLY GIVEN THE
DOCUMENTATION TO THE COP

42
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:16,690
BEFORE THE SHOOTING HAPPENED.

43
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,370
SO, HE GIVES THE DOCUMENTATION
TO THE COP, AND THEN CALMLY SAYS

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,870
ñ WHICH SEE IN THE VIDEO ñ I
HAVE TO KNOW ñ I HAVE LET YOU

45
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,900
KNOW, I HAVE A FIREARM, AND HE
SAYS DON'T REACH FOR IT, AND I

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,720
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD IT,
BUT AT THAT POINT HE SAYS

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,439
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF,
I'M NOT REACHING FOR IT,

48
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,400
AND THEN IMMEDIATELY THE
SHOOTING HAPPENS.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,689
YOU DON'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING
IN THE CAR, OBVIOUSLY, I

50
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:41,209
JUST WANT PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENED.

51
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,170
MY UNDERSTANDING, FROM READING
THE TRIAL, IS THAT HE HANDED

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,659
OVER THE PROOF OF INSURANCE, AND
HAD NOT YET HANDED OVER ID.

53
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,689
OH, I SEE.

54
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,799
HE HAD ALREADY HANDED OVER PROOF
OF INSURANCE ñ I'M NOT, I MEAN,

55
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,799
COPS, IT'S A DANGEROUS ROB, BUT
THEY HAD ALREADY BEGUN THE

56
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,689
PEACEFUL EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
WHEN YOU GET PULLED OVER BY

57
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,689
A COP.

58
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:10,249
HE HANDED OVER HIS PROOF OF
INSURANCE, AND THEN I'M

59
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:13,999
GUESSING NOW, HAD TO REACH FOR
HIS ID, WHAT HE THOUGHT,

60
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,319
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT THERE
IS A GUN IN THE CAR.

61
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,430
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME
THING WHEN THE VERDICT CAME OUT

62
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,269
ON THURSDAY, HE JUST, HE DID
EVERYTHING HE WAS SUPPOSED

63
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,269
TO DO.

64
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,120
I MEAN, WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT
BLACK MOTHERS, AND BLACK

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,799
FATHERS, TELLING THEIR KIDS HOW
TO BEHAVE, YOU KNOW, IDA

66
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,139
RODRIGUEZ SAYS IT, SHE SCARED
EVERY TIME HE GOES OUT, I'M

67
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,860
POINTING AT YOU KIM BECAUSE SHE
WAS SITTING IN THAT SEAT ON

68
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,299
FRIDAY, SHE IS SCARED EVERY
TIME, AND GIVES VERY

69
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,530
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS OF WHAT
HER KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

70
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,530
SO, HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, AND
THEN THOUGHT, I SHOULD MENTION ñ

71
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,530
IF ONLY ñ THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
ABOUT IT, IF PHILANDO CASTILLE

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,999
HAD NEVER SAID HE HAD A GUN IN
THE CAR, AND JUST GOT HIS ID

73
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,450
OUT, HE WOULD STILL BE ALIVE
TODAY, BUT HE THOUGHT THAT

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,700
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
BECAUSE MAYBE THE ID WAS

75
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,949
WHERE THE GUN WAS.

76
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,590
HOWEVER, IT COMES OUT.

77
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,089
HE DID EVERYTHING HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO, EVERYTHING

78
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,059
HE IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND HE
STILL ENDED UP GETTING KILLED.

79
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,639
WHY IS THAT THE FIRST MOVE?

80
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,950
TO JUST START SHOOTING.

81
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,700
ISN'T THERE ANOTHER METHOD YOU
COULD HAVE USED?

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,209
IS THERE ONE OF SEVERAL OTHER
METHODS YOU COULD'VE USED?

83
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,895
YEAH, SO, THAT IS A COMMON THEME
THAT WOULD SEE WITH A LOT OF

84
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:26,889
THESE ñ THAT WE SEE WITH A LOT
OF THESE STORIES, WHERE COPS

85
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,610
SEEM TO HAVE NONLETHAL WEAPONS
AT THEIR DISPOSAL, AND FOR SOME

86
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,870
REASON THEY DON'T IMMEDIATELY GO
TO THOSE WEAPONS; THEY

87
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,919
IMMEDIATELY GO TO GUNS, WHICH IS
INTERESTING, BECAUSE, AGAIN, AND

88
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,350
IF SO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES
BEFORE, IN THE PAST THE BIG

89
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,810
STORY WAS THAT COPS WERE
OVERUSING TASERS, AND USING IT

90
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,800
ON INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD HEART
CONDITIONS.

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,870
AT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
NONLETHAL, SOME PEOPLE

92
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,810
WOULD DIE FROM TASERS, THAT WAS
THE BIG STORY WE HAD MAYBE

93
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,310
FIVE YEARS AGO.

94
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,130
AND NOW, BECAUSE ñ MAYBE BECAUSE
OF ALL THE TRANSPARENCY WE

95
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,879
HAVE WITH CELL PHONE VIDEOS, AND
LIVE SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS,

96
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:10,540
WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW
LETHAL WEAPONS ARE NOW USED.

97
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,759
AND IT ALL HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY.

98
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,219
HE CALMLY TELLS THE COP, I
HAVE TO TELL YOU, I HAVE A

99
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,800
LICENSED GUN IN THE CAR.

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,100
AND AGAIN, WE DID NOT SHOW YOU
THE FULL VIDEO BECAUSE WE DID

101
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,280
NOT HAVE TIME, BUT YOU SHOULD
WATCH THE FULL VIDEO,

102
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,099
BECAUSE THEIR INTERACTION BEFORE
THE SHOOTING WAS TOTALLY FINE.

103
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,099
WAS,.

104
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,380
IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY, ALMOST
OUT OF NOWHERE.

105
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,939
IT'S BECAUSE THE COP THOUGHT ñ
ONE OF THE REASONS THE

106
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,590
ESCALATION HAPPENED, WHY THE
COUPLEDOM OVER WAS BECAUSE HE

107
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,810
THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A SUSPECT
IN A ROBBERY THAT HAD HAPPENED

108
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,810
NEARBY.

109
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,460
I STILL WANT TO SEE A
SIDE-BY-SIDE, IF THEY EVER

110
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,819
CAUGHT THAT GUY, BECAUSE I THAT
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE PHILANDO

111
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,539
CASTILLE, BUT HE WAS BLACK AND
YOUNG AND SITTING IN A CAR.

112
00:05:53,539 --> 00:06:00,430
HOW YOU RECONCILE THAT THE
SUSPECT YOU THOUGHT WAS IN A CAR

113
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,210
WITH A WIFE AND CHILD.

114
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:11,440
AGAIN, IT'S A 
SLIGHT EVIDENCE OF

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,729
WHAT HUMANS DO WHEN THEY

116
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,240
ARE SHOOTING, THEY RUN AWAY.

117
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,440
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT BLACK, SO,
I DON'T HAVE STANDING HERE, BUT

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,002
I AM HUMAN, AND I DID SEE ñ YOU
SEE THE REACTION OF THE COP, THE

119
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:33,691
COP STARTED TO CRY IN THE
MIDDLE OF THAT, AND, THAT COP

120
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:35,759
DIDN'T WANT TO SHOOT HIM, RIGHT?

121
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,410
HE DID NOT WANT TO SHOOT HIM,
AND IKE I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T

122
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,280
WANT TO GET SHOT; NOBODY WANTED
THAT TO HAPPEN.

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,160
SO, THE CONVICTION ñ WHICH I
UNDERSTAND MEANS A LOT TO A LOT

124
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,030
OF PEOPLE, AND UNDERSTANDABLY ñ
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WASN'T

125
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,151
CONVICTED, I LOVE HOW THE
PROSECUTOR TOOK THE CASE, AND

126
00:06:51,151 --> 00:06:54,719
MADE THE CASE THAT NO REASONABLE
PERSON UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

127
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,650
WOULD HAVE DISCHARGED THEIR
WEAPON.

128
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,469
THE DEFENSE, IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO DEFEND A COP WHO USES THE

129
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,580
WEAPON AND SAYS THAT THEY FEARED
FOR THEIR LIFE, BECAUSE THE LAW

130
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,120
IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT
IS A PRETTY EASY DEFENSE.

131
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,580
THAT COP FEARED FOR HIS LIFE.

132
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,499
THE PROBLEM IS, HOW DO WE CHANGE
THAT THAT COP FEARED FOR

133
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,499
HIS LIFE?

134
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,800
HOW DO WE MAKE IT SO THAT
INTERACTION ñ THE REASON HE

135
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,740
CAN'T GO IN WITH A TASER IS
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS

136
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,060
PULLING OVER A ROBBERY SUSPECT,
SO YOU GO IN WITH A TASER.

137
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,210
BUT HOW DO WE CHANGE THOSE
INTERACTIONS THAT HE'S NOT

138
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,870
TERRIFIED GOING IN?

139
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,880
ANSWER HE'S NOT SO QUICK, AND IF
YOU CHANGE THE LAW, AND IT

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,569
BECOMES EASIER TO CONVICT
POLICE OFFICERS, SOME COPS ARE

141
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:37,569
GOING TO QUIT.

142
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,770
THEY ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE
FORCE.

143
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,029
THEY ARE ONE TO THINK, THIS JOB
IS TOO DANGEROUS FOR ME TO

144
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,939
HAVE MY HANDS TIED, AND I
UNDERSTAND THAT.

145
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,449
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO GIVE
PEOPLE GUNS, IN THE NAME OF THE

146
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,930
STATE, AND ALLOW THEM TO USE
IT, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE

147
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,219
INCREDIBLY TIGHT CONTROLS OVER
THE USE OF THOSE WEAPONS.

148
00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:00,439
TO ME, LEAVING OUTLAW, LEAVING
OUT JUST INSTINCTIVE HUMAN

149
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,030
REACTION, I THINK THAT GUY LOST
HIS HEAD TOO QUICKLY.

150
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,199
NO QUESTION, A LOT OF OTHER WAYS
TO GO THERE, BUT HE LOST IT, AND

151
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,580
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
CONVICT A COP OF THAT.

152
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,520
SO, THE LAW NEEDS TO BE CHANGED,
THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE

153
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,259
CHANGED, THAT WHOLE INTERACTION
IS TO START FROM A DIFFERENT

154
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,849
PLACE, AND THEN, ONLY THEN DO I
THINK WE SEE A REDUCTION IN

155
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,090
THESE OFFICER INVOLVED CASES.

156
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,409
I THINK YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD
POINT THERE, AND ONE THING I

157
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,250
WANT TO ADD IS, YES, THE ONUS IS
ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT

158
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,750
THE COUNTRY, BUT I ALSO, I WANT
TO ADDRESS SOMETHING ELSE THAT

159
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,909
KEEPS COMING UP WITH THESE
STORIES THAT I THINK IS

160
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,919
PROBLEMATIC, AND IT IS SOCIETY'S
REACTION TO IT, AND THIS COMFORT

161
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,030
THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH DEMONIZING
INNOCENT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

162
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,550
BEEN SHOT AND KILLED BY COPS.

163
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,420
AND SO, SOMETHING ANDERSON CAME
ACROSS ON SOCIAL MEDIA YESTERDAY

164
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,450
THAT I WANTED TO JUST QUICKLY
DRAW ATTENTION TO; THERE WAS A

165
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,649
BLACK ACTIVIST WHO POSTED
SOMETHING ABOUT OTTO

166
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,810
WARMBIER, THE 22-YEAR-OLD WHO
WAS DETAINED IN NORTH KOREA.

167
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,840
HE WAS SENT BACK, AND HE WAS
SUFFERING FROM A COMA WHEN

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,800
HE WAS SENT BACK, AND
UNFORTUNATELY, TRAGICALLY

169
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,170
HE WAS PRODUCTIVE DEAD
YESTERDAY.

170
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,699
THE BLACK ACTIVIST WROTE
SOMETHING YESTERDAY ABOUT HOW,

171
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:23,660
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING
CRIMINAL IN NORTH KOREA, TAKING

172
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,750
DOWN THAT BANNER WAS CRIMINAL
ACTIVITY.

173
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,019
SO, ESSENTIALLY ANTAGONIZING
WARMBIER FOR HIS ACTIONS IN

174
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,120
NORTH KOREA, BUT IT WASN'T MEANT
TO BE --

175
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,670
IT WAS MEANT TO DRAW
SIMILARITIES TO REACTIONS WHEN

176
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:43,170
WHITE PEOPLE ARE MURDERED VERSUS
WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE MURDERED.

177
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,940
WHEN BLACK PEOPLE ARE MURDERED,
IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT PEOPLE

178
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,449
HAVE NO PROBLEM TEARING THEM
APART, DEMONIZING THEM,

179
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:56,261
ASSUMING THEY ARE THUGS, TALKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH MARIJUANA THEY

180
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,209
HAVE IN THEIR SYSTEM ñ BY THE
WAY, GUESS WHO SMOKES MARIJUANA?

181
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,510
PRE-MUCH EVERYONE.

182
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,230
THAT DOESN'T GIVE COPS THE
AUTHORITY TO RUN AROUND SHOOTING

183
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,199
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE
MARIJUANA IN THEIR SYSTEM.

184
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:10,540
BUT WE HAVE NO PROBLEM
DEMONIZING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

185
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,550
SHOT AND KILLED, BUT IF SUMMARY
POST SOMETHING ABOUT OTTO

186
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,769
WARMBIER, WHO WAS A 22-YEAR-OLD
WHITE GUY ñ WHO, BY THE WAY,

187
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:22,180
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MURDERED,
AND THAT WAS TRAGIC ñ BUT IF

188
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,100
PEOPLE SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT
OTTO, PEOPLE ARE UP IN ARMS

189
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:38,260
ABOUT IT.

190
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,410
I DIDN'T GET THAT GUYS POINT AT
ALL, I READ IT AND ASSUMED,

191
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,839
YOU GOT YOURSELF IN TROUBLE
FOR THAT, BUT I DIDN'T GET

192
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,300
THAT, SO I'M GLAD YOU POINTED IT
OUT.

193
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,769
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME, WE DID IT
WITH MIKE BROWN, BUT HERE'S THE

194
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,590
DEAL; GOOD LUCK DOING IT WITH
PHILANDO CASTILLE.

195
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,440
HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, EVERY
GOD DAMN THING RIGHT.

196
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,120
HE LET THE POLICE KNOW THAT
THERE WAS A GOT IN THE CAR,

197
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,410
THAT HE WAS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO
CARRY.

198
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,510
THIS WAS A GUY ñ AND, BY THE
WAY, PHILANDO CASTILLE, I THINK

199
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,420
THIS WAS RIGHT, I READ IT ON
SOCIAL MEDIA, I READ IT AT THE

200
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:17,050
TIME OF THE SHOOTING, HE WAS A
PROFESSIONAL GET STOPPED BY

201
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,050
POLICE GUY.

202
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,010
THE NUMBER I HAVE IN MY HEAD IS
46

203
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,389
TIMES THAT HE HAD BEEN PULLED
OVER BY POLICE.

204
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,769
46 TIMES.

205
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,529
EITHER HE'S THE WORST DRIVER IN
HISTORY OF MINNESOTA, OR HE

206
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:33,389
GETS PULLED OVER A LOT BECAUSE
HE'S BLACK.

207
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:36,530
SO HE KNEW HOW TO GET PULLED
OVER, HE'S CAREFUL; HIS

208
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,090
GIRLFRIEND'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD KID
WAS IN THE CAR.

209
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,100
HE HANDED OVER THE INSURANCE, HE
DIDN'T HAVE A LICENSE RIGHT

210
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,860
AWAY, HE WON THE COP AND DAMMIT
THE GUY STILL GOT IT.

211
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,170
IT'S HORRIBLE, IT'S HIDEOUS.

212
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,170
SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE
CONVICTION FOR ME, BUT I DON'T

213
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,329
HAVE THE STANDING, AND
I GET IT, YOU ARE ñ

214
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:56,700
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE
OUTRAGED.

215
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,550
BUT THE POINT IS, TO ME, WE HAVE
GOT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND THE

216
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,830
LAW, IMMEDIATELY, RIGHT NOW, SO
THAT THERE ARE 10 OF THESE YEARS

217
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,550
AND NOT 900 OF THEM A YEAR.

218
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,690
IT IS MORE THAN THAT, THOUGH.

219
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,300
LIKE ANA SAID, THAT IS SO
WELL-INTENTIONED AND RIGHT TO

220
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,540
DO, BUT IF WE AS A SOCIETY ARE
SO QUICK TO LOOK AT PEOPLE AND

221
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:26,269
GO, THEY ARE BAD, THEY ARE
CRIMINALS, THAT'S MORE THAN US.

222
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,769
WHEN WE LOOK AT BLACK LIVES
MATTER AND PEOPLE GO, THAT'S A

223
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:30,430
HATE GROUP, THEY ARE TERRIBLE.

224
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,440
ALL THEY ARE SAYING IS, WE ARE
HUMAN, STOP KILLING US, WE

225
00:12:34,440 --> 00:00:00,000
BLEED, WE ARE JUST LIKE YOU,
STOP ATTENDING WE DON'T MATTER.
