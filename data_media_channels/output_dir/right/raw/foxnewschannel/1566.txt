SEASON CONTINUES WITH SOME VERY

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,034
HIGH-PROFILE RACES AGAINST FOUR

4
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:22,734
STATES, DONALD TRUMP CARRIED

5
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:24,903
GEORGIA, ARKANSAS, TO KENTUCKY

6
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:28,073
IN TEXAS DURING THE 2016

7
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:28,440
ELECTION.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,677
WILL REPUBLICANS SEE THE SAME

9
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:33,412
EFFECT AS THEY FIGHT TO MAINTAIN

10
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:35,547
CONTROL OF CONGRESS?

11
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:39,317
JOINING ME IS JIM MACLACHLAN,

12
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:39,951
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

13
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:43,622
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY

14
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:44,322
TALKING ABOUT ELECTION AGAIN.

15
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,491
WE HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR A

16
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:46,858
WHILE NOW.

17
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:55,167
>> IT IS LIKE THE ELECTIONS

18
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:55,600
NEVER STOPPED.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,301
HEATHER: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

20
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:56,968
GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL RACE.

21
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:59,671
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE

22
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:01,506
CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE?

23
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:11,016
>> IN A LOT OF WAYS, ON THE

24
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:11,750
REPUBLICAN SIDE, THEY INCREASED

25
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,484
EDUCATION SPENDING, CUT TAXES,

26
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:15,020
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL BUT

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,158
THINK ABOUT IT, THAT IS A STATE

28
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:20,892
WHERE THE DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING

29
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:21,626
THEY COULD BE DONALD TRUMP, THAT

30
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,963
DIDN'T HAPPEN.

31
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:25,664
HE HAD A DECISIVE VICTORY IN

32
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,700
THAT STATEMENT DEMOCRATS ARE

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,401
EXCITED ABOUT THEIR CANDIDATE

34
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,070
STACY ABRAMS, A FORMER MINORITY

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,544
LEADER IN THE HOUSE, SHE IS

36
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,278
GETTING A LOT OF THAT NATIONAL

37
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:40,812
DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT.

38
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:41,480
WHICH IS HELPING HER IN THE

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,848
PRIMARY BUT QUICKER IN THE

40
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:43,348
GENERAL ELECTION.

41
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:46,651
>> WE HAVE SEEN THIS NATIONAL

42
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:50,288
SUPPORT COMING INTO A STATE OR

43
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:51,022
LOCAL RACE DOES MORE HARM THAN

44
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:51,323
GOOD.

45
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:56,895
>> ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE YOU

46
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,733
HAVE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT

47
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:02,467
WITH DEMOCRATS EVEN TOO LIBERAL

48
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,035
FOR NANCY PELOSI, THE

49
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,071
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATIC

50
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,006
SUPPORT, THEN THE EXTREME LEFT

51
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:16,715
WITH BERNIE SANDERS, ELIZABETH

52
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:17,449
LAUREN, ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS,

53
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:18,183
NOT NECESSARILY LIBERAL ENOUGH

54
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:18,817
SO AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC.

55
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:20,652
>> THEY DON'T HAVE A

56
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:24,990
CONSOLIDATED MESSAGE.

57
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,724
>> TED CRUZ AND BETA OVER ORCA.

58
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:30,695
>> THEY GOT EXCITED ABOUT THIS

59
00:02:30,695 --> 00:02:31,329
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED THE

60
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:32,030
QUINNIPIAC POLL THAT HAD A 3

61
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,765
POINT RACE BUT I DON'T THINK IT

62
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:34,266
IS A 3 POINT RACE.

63
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:40,939
I THINK TED CRUZ IS OVER 50.

64
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,640
THEY SAID THEY CAN BE DONALD

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,876
TRUMP IN TEXAS.

66
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:48,380
OBVIOUSLY THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

67
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,683
SHANNON: HE WON BY 52%.

68
00:02:51,683 --> 00:02:52,384
>> BETA O'ROURKE, THAT HELPED

69
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:56,454
HIM IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.

70
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,155
A LOT OF THIS LEFT OF CENTER

71
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:57,823
LIBERAL NATIONAL SUPPORT IS

72
00:02:57,823 --> 00:03:01,193
GOING TO HURT WITH MAINSTREAM

73
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:01,626
TEXAS VOTERS.

74
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:06,097
HEATHER: IN TERMS OF TED CRUZ,

75
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:10,268
DOES HE RUN AS PRO DONALD TRUMP?

76
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:13,839
>> THE INTERESTING THING, 40% OF

77
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:17,509
THE ADS BEING RUN IN THE

78
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:18,176
PRIMARIES MENTIONED DONALD

79
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:19,811
TRUMP, MOSTLY BY REPUBLICANS IN

80
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,380
A POSITIVE SENSE TO GET THOSE

81
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,655
TRUMP VOTERS BECAUSE THAT IS THE

82
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:31,389
CHALLENGE, TO GET THOSE VOTERS

83
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,123
THAT TURNED OUT IN HUGE NUMBERS

84
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:32,858
FOR DONALD TRUMP AND HIS VICTORY

85
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:35,093
IN 2016, TO MAKE SURE THEY TURN

86
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:38,063
OUT IN OFF YEAR ELECTIONS, TED

87
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:42,033
CRUZ HAS HIS OWN BRAND BUT IS

88
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,767
ALSO GOING TO RELY ON THE PRES.

89
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,970
TO HELP ESPECIALLY WITH TURNOUT.

90
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,874
>> ARKANSAS WE HAVE HUTCHINSON

91
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:52,878
AGAINST JARED HENDERSON AND AT

92
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:53,578
THE SAME TIME LET'S BRING UP

93
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:56,882
DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET ABOUT THE

94
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,917
ARKANSAS GOVERNOR RACE, THE

95
00:03:58,917 --> 00:03:59,651
GREAT GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS IS IN

96
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,719
THE PRIMARY TOMORROW, HAS DONE

97
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,419
AN INTERNAL JOB FOCUSING ON

98
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,623
LOWER TAXES AND GOES ON TALKING

99
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:11,196
ABOUT MILITARY VETERANS.

100
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:11,830
>> NOTHING BETTER IN THE

101
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,564
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY THAN GETTING

102
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:16,401
A TWEET FROM DONALD TRUMP BEFORE

103
00:04:16,401 --> 00:04:16,801
IT HAPPENS.

104
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:17,435
YOU HAVE SEEN IN GENERAL

105
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:18,069
ELECTIONS IN THE GENERAL

106
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,241
ELECTION SURVEY, IT IS UP BY 40

107
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:23,909
POINTS OVER HIS DEMOCRATIC

108
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:24,609
OPPONENT SO THAT IS ONE WHERE

109
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,444
HUTCHINSON HAS DONE A GREAT JOB

110
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:34,986
TYING TO THE PRESIDENT IT HAS A

111
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:35,720
GOOD RECORD AS GOVERNOR, HE WILL

112
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,154
BE SUCCESSFUL.

113
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:36,821
>> DONALD TRUMP WON BY 60%.

114
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,555
MOVING TO KENTUCKY WERE DONALD

115
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,490
TRUMP WON BY 62%.

116
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,561
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING IN

117
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,299
KENTUCKY, CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND

118
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:53,838
YOU HAVE THAT RACE, IF YOU LOOK

119
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:54,572
AT ANDY BARR, SHE SHOULD BE GOOD

120
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:55,240
IN THE GENERAL ELECTION THE

121
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,907
DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT

122
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,277
THEIR TWO CANDIDATES, JIM GRAY,

123
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:01,746
MAYOR OF LEXINGTON AND AMY

124
00:05:01,746 --> 00:00:00,000
MCGRATH, THEY HAVE BEEN GETTING
