PLANS TO BE IN KANSAS ON
SATURDAY.
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
ONE OF THE STRANGER QUESTS IN
THIS SAGA, ONE OF THE KEY G.O.P.
SENATORS COULD MISS PART OF THIS
HISTORIC CONCLUSION ON SATURDAY
BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER IS GETTING
MARRIED.
JOINING US NOW LIVE, MONTANA
REPUBLICAN, WOW.
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
EVERYONE HAD A LITTLE FREAK OUT
TODAY WHEN THEY REALIZE HER
DAUGHTERS GETTING MARRIED ON
SATURDAY, DID THEY THINK THEY
WANT TO VOTE.
WHAT IS THE PLAN?
>> A MONTH AGO I WOULDN'T EXPECT
THIS TO BE HERE.
I JUST SPOKE WITH JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, GAVE HIM A CALL
TONIGHT.
THE NEWS WAS OUT THERE ABOUT THE
WEDDING.
I SAID JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WANT TO
BE CLEAR, MY SUPPORT FOR YOU HAS
BEEN UNWAVERING IN FACT AFTER
SPENDING THREE HOURS WITHOUT FBI
REPORT TODAY, NOT THAT IT WAS
EVER WANING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS PRESENTED
TODAY.
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO, ZERO
COOPERATING EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT
THESE ALLEGATIONS.
I SAID JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I'M
GOING TO BE THERE TO VOTE FOR
YOU AS NEEDED.
>> Shannon: D OF MACHINE?
>> HERE'S HOW
IT
IS GOING TO WORK.
THE NEXT IMPORTANT VOTE IS
TOMORROW AT 10:30 A.M.
WE HAVE TO GET PAST THAT VOTE.
THAT WILL SET THE CLOCK HERE FOR
SATURDAY.
I HAVE A WEDDING ON SATURDAY.
MY GOAL THIS WEEKEND IS TO WALK
MY DAUGHTER DOWN THE AISLE AND
TO SEE A NEW UNITED
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
>> Shannon: SO YOU HAVE SOME
KIND OF PLAN?
>> Laura: I DO.
THERE'S NOTHING SECRET ABOUT IT.
BOTH ARE HELD OPEN ALL THE TIME
BEFORE THE U.S. SENATE.
ONCE A VOTE IS CALLED, THERE
BEEN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.
GOING BACK IN HISTORY AND SEEING
WHERE THEY HAVE HAPPENED FOR A
MEMBER TO COME BACK.
I WILL BE THERE.
THE MAGIC NUMBER IS 50.
WE NEED TO GET TO THAT TOMORROW
AND THAT WE NEED TO GET TO 50 ON
SATURDAY.
>> Shannon: OTHERWISE, IT WILL
BE WATCHING FOR YOU RUNNING IN
THE MIDDLE OF YOUR NIGHT, MAY BE
YOUR TUXEDO?
>> AS NEEDED.
WE WILL FIND OUT A LOT TOMORROW
AT 10:30 ON THAT VOTE.
WE HAVE A PLAN READY TO GO.
I SURE THE JUDGE, I'VE BEEN
BEHIND JUDGE KAVANAUGH FROM THE
FIRST TIME BUT I SAW.
WE MET IN EARLY JULY AND HAD A
CHANCE TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH HIM
IN MY OFFICE.
GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS,
SPENDING THREE HOURS TODAY AND
CONTINUING TO DO MIGHT DO
DILIGENCE OF THE SENATOR.
I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT I AM SOLIDLY VOTING FOR
HIM.
I CAN'T WAIT TO VOTE YES.
>> Shannon: REALLY QUICKLY,
SOME OF YOUR SENATORS ACROSS THE
AISLE ARE NOT AS CONVINCED.
SENATOR KAINE CALLING IT A
COMPLETE SHAM.
OTHER SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT
LEGIT.
>> THEY ARE OUT OF ARGUMENTS.
THEY ARE.
IT IS JUST DESPERATION.
IF YOU ARE FAIR-MINDED, TAKE A
LOOK AT WHAT THE EVIDENCE SAYS.
YOU WILL SAY THAT THESE
ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE.
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE.
IT IS A VERY CLEAR-CUT VOTE FOR
ME.
>> Shannon: YOU ARE YES AND WE
WILL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.
