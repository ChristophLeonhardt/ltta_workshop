our top story is a move away from not only the criminal probe by Bob Muller that's put so much heat on Donald Trump tonight at least that criminal case has been overshadowed by three cases in civil court brought by women who say they deserve their day in court now I'll tell you straight up tonight we didn't choose to bring you these three cases this isn't some kind of editorial decision to compare three different women suing Trump or looking at their legal arguments this is just literally the news breaking on all three of these separate cases right now a new woman filing suit today another who won a procedural step as a judge green lights her case today and the third stormy Daniels releasing new evidence in her case that dates back far before the presidential campaign so let me begin with a brief explanation though of the newest case filed today by Karen McDougal she's a former Playboy model she's suing a national Enquirer's parent company saying she deserves the right to speak about her alleged relationship with Trump dating back to 2006 now she says she signed a deal before the 2016 election for $150,000 that would enable the Inquirer to basically silence her story but now she says she views that contract as void she says she was tricked into signing it while being misled as to its contents including by her very own lawyer than case number two a judge clearing the path for a defamation suit against Donald Trump by former apprentice contestant summer servos he put me in embrace in an embrace and I tried to push him away I pushed his chest to put space between us and I said come on man get real he repeated my words back to me get real as he began thrusting his genitals he tried to kiss me again with my hands still on his chest and I said dude you're tripping right now attempting to make it clear I was not interested now many Republicans argued Bill Clinton should face exactly these kind of civil lawsuits while he was president and that's the exact case that was cited against Donald Trump today the judge noting no one's above the law it's settled the president has no immunity and is subject to the laws for purely private acts then case three news breaking today about stormy Daniels lie-detector test her lawyer who joins me in a moment releasing this picture of a test she took in 2011 to support her claims for a detailed interview with In Touch magazine about this alleged sexual relationship with Donald Trump now this information is definitely newsworthy because it undercuts an attack you may have heard on Daniels the idea that this whole dispute was all about just the 2016 election the new material shows some of the lengths she went to support her own story all the way back in 2011 when the idea of Donald Trump being President of the United States was widely considered a joke ha ha ha here we are now does the test itself mean that everything she said is automatically true as a matter of law no courts don't generally admit these tests experts say they have about a 70% accuracy rate now this particular test asked if Daniels had intercourse with Trump whether it was unprotected and whether he offered to get her an appearance on The Apprentice the examiner asserting she passed the test clearly now stormy Daniels lawyer Michael avenatti says he paid $25,000 for the tape hear of this test for one reason we caught wind of the fact that there were a number of third parties some in the mainstream media that were attempting to purchase the video and the file for use in what I will describe as nefarious activities that very lawyer in the eye of the storm joins me now Michael avenatti the lawyer for stormy Daniels back on the last word thanks for being here thanks for having me all right how are you I'm all right this case stays in the news and partly because there seems to be new evidence that comes out for viewers who see what I just walked through that you've released what is the import of it well I think you put your finger on it Ari the import is is that back in May of 2011 my client sat in a room in Las Vegas with a licensed polygraph examiner was given a polygraph exam and she passed with flying colors a you know I do want to correct one thing the three questions you put up she passed the first two it was determined she was telling the truth as to the third as to whether she was promised a spot on The Apprentice the polygraph examiner concluded that it was inconclusive so it was she he did not conclude she was telling the truth he did not conclude that she was lying it was inconclusive so yeah you know that I strive to be very accurate as it relates to the information that that comes out and so when I see something that is not quite right I want to make it known so that was the detail you that knew on that was it is a nuance but it's important yeah because we don't want to get over the tips of our skis but I think it's important because we've heard various attacks on my client relating to her motivations for doing this people have said that she was trying to blackmail a presidential candidate in the waning days of the election which is patently false and it's one of the things that I think is most important about this now now look this is another piece of evidence and it's another document that's being presented to the American people they could go online they can download it they can read it for themselves they don't have to take your word for it or my word for it or anyone elses word for it there's gonna be other pieces of evidence that are gonna come out in this case there's gonna be this interview that's going to be broadcast on Sunday where the American people are going to be able to observe my clients demeanor and hear her answers and they're gonna be able to judge for themselves as to whether she's telling the truth or not and this has always been what we've said for weeks now don't take my word for it or someone else's word for it you should hear from my client hear her story hear her version of events and judge for yourself and to the extent that mr. Cohen or the president have a counter narrative or a different version of the facts they should go on a show have a press conference they could have a White House briefing they could do any number of things and explain their version giving Donald Trump a little media advice here on this evening let me read to you from Michael Cohen because he's speaking out to Vanity Fair says that Daniels former attorney your predecessor said her number was 130,000 Cohen relates it was strange or not entirely round number but he accepted recalled he asked this lawyer why she would tell her story when she previously denied it quote he said she needed the money I didn't come up with this number that falls absolutely and we're gonna prove it's false and you know here's the best thing that I can say about mr. Cohen's veracity here's the best thing I can say highly suspect so michael cohen in your view is not telling the truth about your client needing money why well i don't think he's telling the truth about a whole host of things starting with the fact that he wants the american people to believe that he drafted this agreement on his own negotiated him on his own mr. trump never knew anything about it didn't have anything to do with the payment and by the way here's an interesting question Ari if that's to be to believed then why is mr. Trump's signature line in the agreement why is he listed as a party and why did he jump into it on Friday I want to bring in our panel and stay with me but I mean this is very this is a very important question it's a very simple one if the whole plan was that mr. Trump was never gonna be a party to this agreement it was never gonna sign it wasn't even gonna know about it because mr. Cohen his very close friend didn't want to bother him in the waning days the campaign and he was just gonna pay the money and he was never even going to tell mr. Trump about it then why did mr. Cohen draft an agreement with mr. Trump's name littered throughout the document with a signature line for him to sign I will tell you my legal analysis I think it's a good question stay with me as promised I want to bring in a few more voices Matt Miller former spokesman for Attorney General Holder an MSNBC analyst as well as Joyce Vance former US Attorney from Alabama and a professor at the University of Alabama law school also an MSNBC analyst Joyce when you hear this and you hear the the lawyers fighting and you see the lie detector test to come out what is your view of the wider significance lie detector tests are really interesting ari you've noted that they're not admissible in court and that's because their scientific validity hasn't been established yet not to say it couldn't be done in the future and perhaps this would be the case but lie detector tests are widely used in law enforcement particularly early on in cases when people are trying to decide whether a witness is telling the truth also widely used in the Justice Department as an employment device so this the introduction of this lie detector test not as evidence but as an indication that that miss Daniels is being truthful at least in so far as her story about having intercourse with the president is very compelling here and Matt Miller when you were serving the Obama administration I don't recall him making a joinder motion for any lawsuits like this no we never dealt with anything like this look I think mr. avenatti is is pursuing this case the way you would expect for someone in his position he's been very aggressive both in court and and with media strategy and what's surprising is that you don't see the is is how you see the president responding you know if stormy Daniels were to come out and just start talking and explain you know that she had a consensual affair with with Donald Trump I don't think that would surprise anyone I'm not even sure it would hurt the president very much but when you see the president pursuing you this kind of strategy to silence her in court something we've not seen from previous presidents something that is you know completely inappropriate for yeah driving let me ask you about that Matt and I would go back to Michael you're putting your finger on the fact that for a long time it was said that Donald Trump would fight everyone in public but Vladimir Putin and and there were inferences that some drew from that it seems that now here in the second year of the presidency he will have a public fight with everyone but Vladimir Putin and stormy Daniels yeah and the question you have to ask is is he worried about something damaging in this case in particular maybe maybe not or is he worried about the precedent it might set if there are other non-disclosure agreements that he signed or that Michael Cohen designed on his behalf or as a party you know it kind of strange stranger arrangement where Michael Cohen was a party and maybe the president was or wasn't are they worried about setting a precedent here that if they let this one go by without a fight that it opens the doors to other people coming forward and talking I don't think we know the answer to that yet but that would be one way to explain the president's very aggressive very unusual posture all right I'm used to put a I'm used to playing chess okay in my cases and I've had the good fortune to go up against some really good chess players from around this country is Michael Cohen playing chess with you well let me just say this really good chess players I mean lawyers at the top of their game really good lawyers that are really good chess player okay and I like to count myself as a pretty good chess player right now we're playing three-dimensional chess and these guys are playing tic-tac-toe quite honestly and they're not even playing tic-tac-toe that well alright that when we filed this case there was one response that made sense and one response only and that response should have been you know what you're right I wasn't a party to the agreement this is the president speaking she's free to talk she can tell her story and I'm going to tell mine and guess what had that happened I want to be sitting here right now and we wouldn't be talking about it the fact of the matter is that's not what happened they have stepped into every trap we have laid in this case the last two weeks it's remarkable I've never seen anything like it I've never had good fortune like this okay we're gonna keep shooting till we miss and the problem Ari is is that now they're doubling and tripling down now we have the President of the United States and I think it's important to take up the step back and think about this for a minute we have a sitting US president who is carrying out a vendetta against a woman who alleges that that she had an affair with him and suing her for twenty million dollars yeah and is attempting to continue to silence her and put her under his thumb right now I think this is about I think that's a significant part and look we have covered the story and we've covered it especially assertively since Friday because for everyone who says well here's this storming Daniels story over here why should be about the president know starting Friday the president inserted himself and he's literally seeking to bankrupt a private citizen for their speech for their words I mean that is clearly important I want to read for the benefit of response Michael Cohen addressing when you were questioned about whether your client faced threats of physical harm and you said yes Michael Cohen's new response I've never spoken to her I've never emailed her I've never texted her every interaction with her he says was through a previous attorney I reiterate I've never threatened her in any way and I'm unaware of anyone else doing so your response and the agreement was drafted without the knowledge of Donald Trump and mr. Cohen made the payment and no one else ever knew about it do you have reason to believe that specific denial is misleading yes and I think that when people with evidence that Michael Cohen would know about the physical threats allegation you've made I'm not going to answer the question as to what we have and what we don't have but here's what I will say people should be very careful about representations they make unequivocal representations that's what I'm going to say I enjoy your thought on any of the above well it sounds to me like there's a little bit more evidence that mr. avenatti has that we'll all learn about in the future there's been at least some indication that there is additional evidence that there are documents I think he said that and of course the non-disclosure agreement represents a whole host of potential pieces of evidence text messages other information about former sexual partners so I think a lot of folks will be looking forward to listening in to the 60 minutes episode if it airs but at the end of the day we got to remember that what we have going on here is is really a credibility matchup between the president's lawyer and a porn star and that is a phenomenal place for this country to be at this particular point in time and the president is in a real box because he's denied knowing her he's denied that they ever had any type of an affair for him to walk that back to the point where he could let her tell her story and he couldn't tell his I think is a very difficult path for him to walk and he may have really put himself in a box he can't get out and I know at that point Matt Miller your final word on us I'll hand the mic here to stormy Daniels who wrote today technically I didn't sleep with POTUS 12 years ago there was no sleeping he was a goofy reality TV star but I digress people do care that he lied about it had me bullied broke laws to cover it up PS I'm not going anywhere xoxoxo yeah it's tawdry it's trashy I mean but but what do we expect what do people expect this is what happens when you elect a reality star president as someone who has you know for years operated kind of in the tabloid world in the trashiest ends of the legal world and of the media world this is the kind of thing you get with Donald Trump as president and I don't think that you know stormy Daniels or the other two women who have filed or attempting to file suit against him I don't think these are the last of these cases we're going to see Matt Miller a Joyce Vance and the lawyer Michael avenatti thanks to each of you for joining me tonight hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
