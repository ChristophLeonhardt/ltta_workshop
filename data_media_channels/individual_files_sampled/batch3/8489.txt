THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. Julie: ALL RIGHT, MEANWHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY WARNED AGAINST RUSHING TO JUDGMENT IN THE CASE OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI NOW SAYING IT DOES APPEAR THE "WASHINGTON POST" COLUMNIST IS DEAD AND HE IS JUST WAITING FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO WRAP UP TO TAKE ACTION. President Trump: IT CERTAINLY LOOKS THAT WAY TO ME. IT'S VERY SAD. Julie: HOW SOON DOES THE WHITE HOUSE EXPECT TO GET TO THE SAUDI'S REPORT ON KHASHOGGI'S DEATH? BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS AS TODAY ALTHOUGH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS OFFICIALLY ARE SAYING LISTEN, WE'LL LET THIS THING PLAY OUT AND RESPECT THEM AND GIVE THEM THE CHANCE TO WORK THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION. BUT MY SOURCES TELL ME THEY EXPECT A REPORT FAIRLY SOON AND IN FAIRLY SHORT ORDER. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND ABOUT RICH'S REPORT. IS THERE AN AUDIO TAPE OUT THERE? THAT REMAINS UNCLEAR. BUT WE DO KNOW THIS IS CLEAR, HEATHER NAUERT TOLD US SECRETARY POMPEO HASN'T HEARD A TAPE OR SEEN A TRANSCRIPT RELATED TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI'S DISAPPEARANCE. I MENTION THE TRANSCRIPT PEOPLE SAID DID HE READ SOMETHING LIKE THAT? HEATHER NAUERT TELLS US ABSOLUTELY NOT. ASKED WHETHER THIS WILL UPSET THE LONGSTANDING TIES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SAUDI KINGDOM SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO SAID NO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US ALL TO REMEMBER, TOO, SINCE 1932 WE HAVE A LONG STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA THAT CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT COUNTER TERRORISM PARTNER. THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO HOLY SITES. THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC ALLIANCE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT AS WELL. NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIP. I ASKED A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING IF THEY FELT LIKE THIS WOULD LEAD TO VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES AND SHE PUT IT BLUNTLY. YES. Julie: WHERE ARE WE ON THE WHITE HOUSE'S RESPONSE TO THE MIGRANT CARAVAN WHICH IS HEADING TOWARD OUR SOUTHERN BORDER? A VERY BIG STORY, JULIE. THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO APPLY PRESSURE ON THEIR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH, MEXICO'S GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING TO KEEP THAT CARAVAN FROM MAKING IT FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF MEXICO ALL THE WAY TO OUR BORDER. IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT SAID AS MUCH LAST NIGHT AT THAT MAKE AMERICA GREAT RALLY IN MONTANA. President Trump: I JUST WANT TO THANK THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY ARE STOPPING IT HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT EVER GETS TO MEXICO. AS YOU KNOW, I'M WILLING TO SEND THE MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IF NECESSARY. THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION. SO DID THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ABOUT MONTANA CONGRESSMAN GREG HE GOT INVOLVED WITH A DUST-UP WITH A REPORTER. THE PRESIDENT HAD THIS TO SAY. President Trump: ANY GUY THAT CAN DO A BODY SLAM IS MY KIND HE WAS WAY UP. I SAID THIS WAS LIKE THE DAY OF THE ELECTION OR JUST BEFORE. AND I SAID OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE. HE WILL LOSE THE ELECTION. I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW MONTANA PRETTY WELL. I THINK IT MIGHT HELP HIM AND IT DID. THERE WILL BE SOME POINTING TO THE AUDIENCE AND SAY THEY WERE LAUGHING AND MAKING LIGHT OF THIS BUT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE FOR JOURNALISTS. THE COMMITTEE TO PROTECT
