1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
perception is such a brilliant thing it

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,140
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to take vast quantities of</font>

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,390
information from this complex world and

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,730
to make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it we have an</font>

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,099
incredible<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to perceive space and</font>

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,590
time on so many levels when it comes to

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,690
space we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,900
look beyond our skies you know to

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,939
observe stars that are millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,130
light-years away and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,800
microscopes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify objects too</font>

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,689
small for the naked eye however these

13
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,490
sort of things rarely cross people's

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,710
minds instead they keep their heads down

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,020
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they can to ensure that</font>

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">their immediate environment is secure</font>

17
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,390
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we live</font>

18
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,649
in the present there are two other

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,739
aspects of time we also perceive we can

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,020
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> back at our past and towards our</font>

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,120
potential future however<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,950
too caught up living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the moment and</font>

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,050
consequently societies are a reflection

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,899
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I mean with history surely we</font>

25
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,579
should be learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,430
with foresight we should be investing

27
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,170
into the future but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is rarely the</font>

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,210
case for the human<font color="#CCCCCC"> race because when we</font>

29
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,250
live in a system where one person's gain

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,409
is another person's loss we are

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">encouraged</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on protecting</font>

32
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,780
ourselves our personal space second by

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,630
second meter by meter and so the average

34
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,850
lifestyle of a human being is to clock

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,880
in do your time clock out and then try

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,770
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> relax before your next shift but</font>

37
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,150
surely<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more to life than this</font>

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">with all the space yet to be explored</font>

39
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the generations yet to be born</font>

40
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,710
there needs to be unity amongst the

41
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,840
human race so what would it take for the

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,630
world to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become one what is it that we</font>

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,759
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in common well first we have to</font>

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,400
reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things internally so tell me</font>

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,040
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want from life I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about this a lot lately about</font>

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,229
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> our existences individually are just</font>

48
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,420
a drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ocean in terms of both</font>

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,090
space and time I mean we live<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 80</font>

50
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,250
years if we're lucky living on a

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,439
gigantic<font color="#E5E5E5"> rock that is floating through</font>

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,590
this massive black void for me the

53
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,750
meaning of life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is legacy creating</font>

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,270
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will outlive yourself to</font>

55
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,008
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind something that will improve</font>

56
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,598
the space you once stood on and

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,060
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will enrich the lives on</font>

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,780
those that exist in

59
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the follows so with all that in mind</font>

60
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,470
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think it will take for the</font>

61
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">masses to truly wake up to be conscious</font>

62
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,870
of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going on in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

63
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,819
to understand that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> living on a</font>

64
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,250
finite planet and our actions<font color="#E5E5E5"> now will</font>

65
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,170
have significant consequences for the

66
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,940
future think about it let's say you

67
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,180
drive a car and every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide to</font>

68
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,250
go a bit faster because you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

69
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,200
to where you want to go quicker all it

70
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,989
takes is for that one moment where you

71
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:42,850
have a negative impact on someone else

72
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,770
you have a car crash you have an

73
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,530
accident<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you are shaken up</font>

74
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,380
you're like oh I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that my</font>

75
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,530
behavior could have such an occurrence

76
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,660
on other people and it's only when that

77
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,000
negative thing happens that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">change your way so where am I going with</font>

79
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,000
this well on a global scale does it

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
really require a global catastrophe for

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,670
the human<font color="#CCCCCC"> race to change its ways for</font>

82
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,470
the better in the long run I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

83
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">so and you know why because we have</font>

84
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,300
perception remember it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to take</font>

85
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">in vast quantities of information from</font>

86
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,190
this complex world and to make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

87
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,350
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why i believe</font>

88
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,060
information should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> made readily</font>

89
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,000
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us all no secrets full</font>

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,519
transparency because by increasing the

91
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,250
education and thus awareness of a global

92
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,130
population human beings individually

93
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,829
will make better<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions and therefore</font>

94
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,780
so will the societies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they live in</font>

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,030
so let me leave you with two questions

96
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,390
to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one what matters to you</font>

97
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,540
right now and to what are you going to

98
00:03:49,540 --> 00:00:00,000
do about it
