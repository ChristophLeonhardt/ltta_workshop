Syrian army has advanced against Islamic state towards the Iraqi border as the military pushes out remaining terrorists in the country we can show you now some of the latest pictures from the ground Syrian army previously took control of the last isil stronghold in the country the town of abble come out they are now pushing the extremists out of surrounding villages the radius advances now allow the army to provide better logistics between the newest gains and already established positions despite the fact that ISIL is almost eliminated in Syria American forces don't seem to be planning to withdraw from the country which they invaded on the grounds of fighting terror an explanation now here's our tease Jacqueline booga ISIL has been losing territory in Syria at breakneck speed and it's all-out defeat looks to be on the horizon even the u.s. seems to agree on that front secretary Tillerson has engaged a great deal of sort of personal diplomacy on Syria well the defeat of Isis and now that Isis in terms of as a physical caliphate will be gone by the end of the year stereo has in fact already declared victory over ISIL and issued a warning to the US that it's high time they left as well the Syrian Arab Republic again calls for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of US forces from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic this presence is an aggression against Syria's sovereignty and independence and will be dealt with on this basis and that shouldn't be a problem given that Trump himself has said that America's interest in Syria is reserved to fighting Islamic state we have very little to do with Syria other than killing Isis so theoretically if ISIL only has a couple of months left then so does the US presence in Syria right don't hold your breath the US Secretary of Defense James Madison T hinted at what the US will need to see before they leave we're going to make sure we set the conditions for a diplomatic solution not just you know fight the military part of it and then say good luck on the rest of it we did it for that to support the diplomatic solution but that's a tune we've heard before which would mean waiting around for the opposition groups some of whom the u.s. supports and the legitimate government who never invited the u.s. into the country in the first place to come to the table and figure out who stays and who goes madis says US soldiers have a right to be in Syria despite Damascus objections the UN said that Isis basically we can go after Isis and we're there to take them out but that doesn't mean we just walk away and let Isis 2.0 pop back around but that remark about the UN isn't 100% true the u.s. does not have a UN mandate to deploy let alone stationed troops in Syria a UN Security Council resolution only authorized sanctions to be used against ISIL such as freezing assets or an arms embargo but nowhere is troop deployment to a sovereign country mentioned and the Syrian democratic forces one of the groups who the u.s. backs and who happens to be at odds with Damascus have welcomed America's long-term plan for Syria they have a strategy for decades to come there will be military economic and political agreements in the long term between the leadership of the northern areas and the US administration so while ISIL is on its way out all signs point to the Pentagon digging in former US diplomat Jim jar asked questions the reasons behind Washington not wanting to withdraw from Syria even after the elimination of ISIL any attempt to stay in Syria has nothing to do with Isis or Isis to or anything of this sort US troops are not there legally in the first place unlike Iraq where they have been invited in by the the government of that country the only resolution that comes even close to suggesting some kind of authority to go fight against Isis made it very clear that they could only be done in in compliance with international law and with national sovereignty and that means with the authorization and invitation of the Syrian government which the US forces do not have so there's simply no way you can stretch the language of any of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions to say that it gives legal authority to the American military presence in Syria meanwhile the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra which has repeatedly suffered from terrorist atrocities now has hoped for a new beginning Russian researchers have created a 3d model of the city based on thousands of aerial images the detailed copy would allow the unesco world heritage site ravished by ISIL to be restored and preserved during their occupation the jihadists regularly posted videos of the destruction of ancient artifacts one of the other remaining tasks now is to track down the relics stolen by the terrorists
