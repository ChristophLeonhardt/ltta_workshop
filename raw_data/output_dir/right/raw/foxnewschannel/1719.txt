EXITING THE MEETING, SENATORS

38

40
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:07,902

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

71
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,898
>> ONE TOPIC THAT DIDN'T COME UP

72
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:10,698
EVEN THOUGH IOWA SENATOR JONI

73
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,334
ERNST WANTED TO RAISE IT WAS THE

74
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,936
CUTTING REMARK THAT WHITE HOUSE

75
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,705
STAFFER KELLY SADLER MADE ABOUT

76
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:18,306
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN IN A

77
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,707
MEETING LAST WEEK.

78
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:21,309
A GROWING NUMBER OF SENATORS NOW

79
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,778
SAYING SADLER, THE WHITE HOUSE,

80
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,913
OR BOTH SHOULD APOLOGIZE.

81
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:28,716
>> OF THE PRISON HE SAID THAT

82
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,251
SHOULD APOLOGIZE AND SHOULD

83
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,287
APOLOGIZE PUBLICLY.

84
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,354
>> WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS TELL

85
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,756
FOX NEWS THAT SADLER COULD HAVE

86
00:02:34,756 --> 00:02:36,658
EASILY PUT THE ISSUE TO REST BY

87
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,894
MAKING A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO

88
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:40,728
McCAIN LAST WEEK.

89
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,529
ACCORDING TO SOURCES THAT WAS

90
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:45,366
INITIALLY THE PLAN, BUT THE PLAN

91
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:45,833
CHANGED.

92
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,936
SADLER DUG IN HER HEELS AND SIX

93
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,070
DAYS LATER THE ISSUE WAS

94
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,471
GATHERING STEAM.

95
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,707
AND AN EFFORT TO CHANGE THE

96
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,142
SUBJECT PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE

97
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,944
INSULT OF ALL ABOUT THE FACT

98
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:58,112
THAT IT WAS LEAKED.

99
00:02:58,112 --> 00:02:59,113
MEANING THE SO-CALLED LEAKS

100
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,114
COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

101
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,082
ARE AN EXAGGERATION COMING OUT

102
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,483
OF THE NEWS MEDIA IN ORDER TO

103
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,453
MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE.

104
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,689
WITH THAT SAID, LEAKERS ARE

105
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,357
TRAITORS AND COWARDS AND WE WILL

106
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,692
FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE.

107
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,160
SOURCES SAY THERE WERE ABOUT 30

108
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,294
PEOPLE IN THE MEETING WHERE THE

109
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:14,896
REMARK WAS MADE AND OFFICIALS

110
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,698
BELIEVE IT WAS LEAKED SIMPLY TO

111
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:19,500
DAMAGE THE PRESIDENT, , AND THAT

112
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,702
THERE WILL LIKELY BE

113
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:21,135
REPERCUSSIONS.

114
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,004
>> I HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ON

115
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:26,074
THIS VERY TOPIC TODAY.

116
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:27,609
>> DO YOU EXPECT PERSONNEL

117
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,877
CHANGES AS A RESULT?

118
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,679
>> I DO.

119
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,982
>> KELLING AND CONWAY SAID A LOT

120
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:40,521
OF STAFFERS USE LINK TO "SHIV"

121
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:40,922
