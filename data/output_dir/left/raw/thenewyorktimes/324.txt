1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,060
45 minutes or so
before the start,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,630
you’re not thinking
about how to ski fast,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,500
or what it takes to execute
the perfect biathlon shot,

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,050
or how much a
biathlon race hurts.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,730
I tell, myself it’s just
skiing, and it’s just shooting.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,020
I know how to do both
of those things well.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,920
And I ski through
it in my mind, and I

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,762
try to visualize
what type of emotions

9
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:29,220
I’m going to feel, what type
of pressure I’m going to feel,

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,100
before it actually happens.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,810
I’m thinking about
the race, and thinking

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,500
about where I’m going to
change my technique, if it’s

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,040
slow snow, if it’s fast snow, if
it’s windy, if it’s not windy.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,070
In my mind, I can
see the changing

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,710
of the digital numbers.

16
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,400
And for a moment, I
think, can I do this?

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,810
Am I capable of putting
myself through this again?

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,300
Usually the crowd is screaming.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,740
It’s pandemonium.

20
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,640
But for me, that’s the point
where the audio and visual

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,630
come in and become
sort of a tunnel, where

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,300
the only thing that I’m
focusing on is my own race.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,330
And in that moment, I
have to repeat to myself,

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,480
do what you can, with what
you have, where you are.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,660
That’s a Teddy
Roosevelt quote: do

26
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,200
what you can, with what
you have, where you are.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,510
A song comes on that
distracts you for a second.

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,100
And it’s all about getting
back into your own zone.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,840
And for me, that reset button
is just repeating that quote.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,050
I look at the snow.

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,980
I look at where I am.

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,200
I’ve got skis on my feet.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,330
I’ve got a rifle on my back.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,560
I know how to start the race.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,390
I just need to
let my body do it.

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,310
I know that, at 10 seconds,
I’ll hear the audible beeps,

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,870
and that’s the trigger.

38
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,200
I’m the bow with the
arrow drawn, waiting.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,410
And when that beep changes,
that’s the release,

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,720
and that’s the acceleration,
and I’m the arrow,

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,210
and I’m accelerating
down the track.

42
00:02:09,210 --> 00:00:00,000
Do what you can, with what
you have, where you are.
