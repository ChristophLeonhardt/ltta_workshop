1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,141
AFTERNOON ON THE LAWN AT THE

2
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:03,310
WHITE HOUSE AFTER THE PRESIDENT

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,012
WALKED THE NORTH KOREAN

4
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:06,280
VICE-CHAIRMAN BACK TO HIS CAR.

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,614
WE DON'T SEE THAT EVERY DAY.

6
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:10,150
>> 8112th WE'LL BE IN

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,517
SINGAPORE.

8
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:13,153
I NEVER SAYS IT GOES IN ONE

9
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:13,487
MEETING.

10
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:17,758
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

11
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:19,860
PROCESS, BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS

12
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,227
BUILDING.

13
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:22,462
I LOOK FORWARD TAKING THE

14
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:23,897
SANCTIONS OFF SOME DAY.

15
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:26,933
I DON'T WANT TO USE MAXIMUM

16
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,568
PRESSURE.

17
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:30,537
WE DID DISCUSS THE ENDING OF THE

18
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:31,772
KOREAN WAR.

19
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:33,473
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

20
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:37,311
A LETTER WAS GIVEN TO ME BY KIM

21
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,913
JONG-UN, A VERY NICE LETTER.

22
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,481
OH, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE WHAT

23
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,983
WAS IN THE LETTER?

24
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,718
I HAVEN'T OPENED IT.

25
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:45,719
I DIDN'T OPEN IT IN THE FRONT OF

26
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,386
THE DIRECTOR.

27
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,055
I SAID, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO

28
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:48,555
OPEN IT?

29
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,657
HE SAID, YOU CAN READ IT LATER.

30
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,894
I MAY BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

31
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:54,261
FOLKS.

32
00:00:54,261 --> 00:01:03,870
>> LET'S GET REACTION.

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,239
THERE WAS A LOT IN THAT SOUND

34
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,874
BITE THAT WE JUST PUT TOGETHER

35
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:09,543
FROM TODAY, THE POTENTIAL END OF

36
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:11,578
THE KOREAN WAR, THE POTENTIAL

37
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,714
FOR DENUCLEARIZATION, A THAW

38
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:15,382
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

39
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,550
A LOT HAPPENED IN THAT MEETING

40
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,150
THIS AFTERNOON.

41
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,819
>> IT DID.

42
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,354
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT CANCELLATION

43
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,389
THAT YOU REFERENCED, WHERE IT

44
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:25,292
WAS OFF FOR A COUPLE DAYS, WAS

45
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,494
MAYBE A GOOD, HEALTHY REALITY

46
00:01:27,494 --> 00:01:28,495
CHECK FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED,

47
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:29,763
INCLUDING AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

48
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:32,599
BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME

49
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,334
TRIUMPHANTISM AND A BIT TOO MUCH

50
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,036
EXCITEMENT AND OPTIMISM FLYING

51
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:38,905
AROUND, AND THEN THERE WAS A

52
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:39,806
REMINDER THIS IS A DIFFICULT

53
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:40,907
PROCESS WITH A TERRIBLE REGIME

54
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,509
WITH A HORRIBLE HISTORY, AND THE

55
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,677
TONE THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE

56
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,312
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE

57
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,114
EVER SINCE HAS BEEN MORE

58
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:49,015
MEASURED IN MY VIEW, MORE

59
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,917
REALISTIC, AND IT SEEMS LIKE

60
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:51,852
SOME OF THE ACTUAL DIPLOMATIC

61
00:01:51,852 --> 00:01:54,688
GROUNDWORK IS STARTING TO HAPPEN

62
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,256
FOR THIS JUNE THE 12th

63
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:56,990
MEETING.

64
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,792
SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A PIVOT

65
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,628
POINT IN THIS PROCESS, AND ONE

66
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:04,297
THAT TURNS OUT TO BE GOOD.

67
00:02:04,297 --> 00:02:05,999
>> WE WILL SEE, AS THE PRESIDENT

68
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,968
LIKES TO SAY.

69
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:10,437
ZACH, A LOT OF SNICKERING, THAT

70
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:12,139
NANCY PELOSI SOUND BITE WAS JUST

71
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,507
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES.

72
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:14,508
WHAT ARE FOLKS ON THE DEMOCRATIC

73
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:15,976
SIDE SAYING ABOUT IT NOW?

74
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:17,310
>> LOOK, I THINK THIS IS GREAT.

75
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,881
I THINK THAT DIPLOMACY IS FAR

76
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,150
SUPERIOR TO WAR.

77
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,551
IC I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD SOUND

78
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,086
A NOTE OF CAUTION EXPRESSED BY

79
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:27,788
THE REPUBLICAN LEADER TODAY, YOU

80
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:28,088
KNOW.

81
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,956
DONALD TRUMP SEEMS VERY EAGER TO

82
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:31,358
GET A DEAL.

83
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:34,327
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN HIS

84
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,429
EAGERNESS HE'S NOT ACCEPTING

85
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,330
SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT MEET THE

86
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,566
STANDARD THAT HE HIMSELF AND HIS

87
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:41,468
ADMINISTRATION HAVE LAID OUT,

88
00:02:41,468 --> 00:02:45,872
WHICH IS VERIFIABLE, COMPLETE,

89
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:48,208
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION,

90
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,510
ALONG WITH A REGIME THAT'S

91
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,479
STRONGER THAN THE IRAN DEAL AND

92
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,413
GOES LONG INTO THE FUTURE.

93
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,215
IF HE COMES BACK FROM JUNE

94
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,050
12th SUMMIT AND DOES NOT HAVE

95
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,152
AN AGREEMENT LIKE THAT, HE JUST

96
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,353
COMES BACK WITH MORE EXCUSES, A

97
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,155
SYMBOLIC END TO THE KOREAN WAR

98
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:02,456
OR --

99
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,891
>> HE SAID TODAY, TO BE FAIR, HE

100
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,128
EXPECTS SEVERAL MEETINGS.

101
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,729
WE REMEMBER REAGAN AND

102
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,731
GORBACHEV, IT TOOK SEVERAL

103
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:12,098
MEETINGS.

104
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:12,866
>> NO.

105
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,935
HE'S ALREADY MAKING EXCUSES.

106
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:17,103
>> DO YOU THINK THAT'S FAIR,

107
00:03:17,103 --> 00:03:17,404
ZACH?

108
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:18,472
>> ABSOLUTELY.

109
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:19,940
LOOK, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

110
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,108
SOMEBODY WHO SAID HE'S THE GREAT

111
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:22,509
DEAL-MAKER.

112
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,977
>> HOLD ON.

113
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:25,212
ZACH, DO YOU HOPE THAT HE COMES

114
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:28,114
HOME WITH A DEAL THAT PROMISES

115
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:28,715
THE THINGS THAT YOU --

116
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:30,851
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY.

117
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,752
>> WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR

118
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:34,488
BOTH SIDES TO BE POSITIVE AND

119
00:03:34,488 --> 00:03:36,156
SORT OF CHEERING THIS PROCESS ON

120
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,791
IN THE HOPE THAT IT'S A VERY

121
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:39,192
GOOD THING FOR THE PEOPLE OF

122
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,527
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA AND

123
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:44,064
JAPAN RATHER THAN KNOCKING IT

124
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:44,731
DOWN EVERY CHANCE YOU GET?

125
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:45,365
>> NO.

126
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:46,433
WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT IT, BUT

127
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,868
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE

128
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,303
MEETING ITSELF IS SOME SORT OF

129
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,204
ACCOMPLISHMENT WHEN THE REGIME

130
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:56,610
HAS BEEN ASKING FOR A MEETING AT

131
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,512
THIS LEVEL FOR YEARS.

132
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,715
EXCEPTING THIS MEETING, IT'S NOT

133
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:02,649
AN ACHIEVEMENT, IT'S A

134
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:03,783
CONCESSION TO THE KIM REGIME.

135
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:05,485
>> YEAH, BUT, LOOK, THERE'S A

136
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,120
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU JUST

137
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,922
SAID, WHICH IS EXCUSE-MAKING,

138
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:09,689
AND EXPECTATIONS MANAGEMENT.

139
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,024
I THINK THIS IS MORE THE LATTER.

140
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:11,725
THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

141
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,660
>> YEAH.

142
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:13,960
HOWIE?

143
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,327
>> YEAH.

144
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:15,428
WE CAN'T CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT

145
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:17,130
FOR MAKING EXCUSES FOR A MEETING

146
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,164
THAT HASN'T EVEN BEGUN.

147
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:20,367
BY THE WAY, DONALD TRUMP IS A

148
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,567
MASTER SHOWMAN.

149
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,602
SO YOU HAD CAMERAS TRAINED ON

150
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:24,304
THE WHITE HOUSE FOR HOURS TODAY.

151
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:25,205
THE LETTER BEING DELIVERED, WHAT

152
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:26,306
WAS IN THE LETTER.

153
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,674
WHEN HE DID CANCEL THE MEETING,

154
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:28,808
THERE WAS ALL THIS CRITICISM

155
00:04:28,808 --> 00:04:31,111
ABOUT, OH, HE'S JUST THROWING A

156
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,280
TEMPER TANTRUM, THIS WAS

157
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,647
IMPULSIVE.

158
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:34,848
HE GOT KIM BACK TO THE

159
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:35,849
NEGOTIATING TABLE.

160
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,450
EVEN IN THAT BREAKUP LETTER, HE

161
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,054
DID SAY, CALL ME, WRITE ME, TEXT

162
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:41,321
ME.

163
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:41,922
>> YEAH.

164
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,657
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS, WE SHOULD

165
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:45,191
POINT OUT, THEY WERE SAYING,

166
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,960
ACTUALLY, WE WOULD LIKE TO COME

167
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,195
TALK TO YOU, WE DO WANT A

168
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:49,529
MEETING.

169
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:49,863
>> YEAH.

170
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:50,931
ALL THE CRITICISM ABOUT THE

171
00:04:50,931 --> 00:04:51,965
PRESIDENT WANTED THIS SUMMIT SO

172
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,234
BADLY HE WAS GOING TO MAKE

173
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:55,402
SWEEPING CONCESSIONS, ACTUALLY

174
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:57,537
WHAT WE LEARNED THROUGH THE

175
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:58,271
NEGOTIATING TACTICS IS THAT KIM

176
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,940
NEEDS THE MEETING MORE.

177
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,474
HE'S THE ONE THAT SEEMED TO COME

178
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:01,775
BACK.

179
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,043
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEAL.

180
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:03,476
>> YEAH.

181
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:04,945
IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING TO

182
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:06,413
WATCH THIS PLAY OUT.

183
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:07,714
THE PRESIDENT WAS ENJOYING THE

184
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:08,682
BACK AND FORTH TODAY WITH THE

185
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,216
PRESS AS HE OFTEN DOES, AND AS

186
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:12,752
HE WAS WALKING AWAY HE GOT ASKED

187
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,054
ABOUT NAFTA, AND HERE'S WHAT HE

188
00:05:14,054 --> 00:05:17,257
SAID ABOUT THAT.

189
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:19,459
>> ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES,

190
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,561
INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN UNION,

191
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:26,633
THEY CHARGE FIVE TIMES WHAT WE

192
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,468
CHARGE FOR TARIFFS.

193
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,737
I BELIEVE IN THE WORD

194
00:05:30,737 --> 00:05:31,137
RECIPROCAL.

195
00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:32,038
YOU'RE GOING TO CHARGE FIVE

196
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:33,173
TIMES, WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE

197
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:33,907
FIVE TIMES.

198
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:35,108
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE.

199
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,076
NO OTHER PRESIDENT EVER BROUGHT

200
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:36,576
IT UP.

201
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,178
IT'S GOING TO BE DONE NOW.

202
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,113
>> THIS IS FASCINATING.

203
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:42,349
IT GOT A LOT OF RESPONSE FROM

204
00:05:42,349 --> 00:05:43,216
OUR PARTNERS.

205
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:47,621
THIS FROM EMANUEL McCRAWN,

206
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,055
THAT MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

207
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,256
WITH, HIS RESPONSE WAS FROSTY.

208
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:52,092
IN FACT, HE SAID ECONOMIC

209
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:54,194
NATIONALISM LEADS TO WAR.

210
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,095
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN

211
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:58,531
THE 1930s, AND THEN THIS FROM

212
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:00,066
OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR JUSTIN

213
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:00,400
TRUDEAU.

214
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,104
WATCH.

215
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:10,310
>> THE IDEA THAT SOLDIERS WHO

216
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,578
FOUGHT TOGETHER IN WORLD WAR II,

217
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:14,881
ON THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN,

218
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:15,582
STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN

219
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:16,316
DIFFICULT PLACES IN THE WORLD,

220
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,419
ALWAYS THERE FOR EACH OTHER,

221
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,154
SOMEHOW THIS IS INSULTING TO

222
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,856
THEM, THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE

223
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:23,990
ARE A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT

224
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,392
TO THE UNITED STATES IS QUITE

225
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,093
FRANKLY INSULTING AND

226
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:27,527
UNACCEPTABLE.

227
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:28,995
>> GUY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

228
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:30,697
>> THE EXCUSE THAT THE TRUMP

229
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:32,932
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING IS

230
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,134
USING THIS NATIONAL SECURITY

231
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:35,669
EXCEPTION TO JUSTIFY THE TARIFFS

232
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,137
THEY'RE SLAPPING ON THE

233
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:37,570
CANADIANS.

234
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,139
LOOK, THIS IS A TERRIBLE,

235
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:39,739
TERRIBLE IDEA.

236
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,042
TRADE WARS ARE BAD FOR EVERYONE

237
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:42,409
INVOLVED.

238
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,943
THEY ARE LOSE-LOSE PROPOSITIONS,

239
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:45,712
AS I'VE SAID ON THIS SHOW

240
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,181
BEFORE, BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE

241
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:48,481
TRUE.

242
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:54,454
I HOPE PEOPLE GO HOME AND WATCH

243
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:56,189
MILTON FREE WATER, BECAUSE HE'S

244
00:06:56,189 --> 00:06:57,190
SO SMART.

245
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,158
WE HAD SUCH AN AMAZING JOBS

246
00:06:58,158 --> 00:06:58,892
REPORT TODAY.

247
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,593
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING UNDER

248
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:01,261
TRUMP POLICY --

249
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:04,631
>> BUT, GUY, THE MARKET DIDN'T

250
00:07:04,631 --> 00:07:05,031
EVEN BLINK.

251
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,733
>> THE MARKET IS DIFFERENT THAN

252
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,535
THE BROADER ECONOMY.

253
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:11,538
AND WHEN YOU COST AMERICAN JOBS

254
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:12,338
THROUGH RETALIATION, BECAUSE

255
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:14,274
WE'RE GOING TO SEE RETALIATION,

256
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:15,809
OUR ALLIES HAVE PROMISED IT,

257
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,610
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO GRANT THAT,

258
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,346
LET'S SAY, CHINA IS A CURRENCY

259
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:21,648
MANIPULATOR AND A BAD TRADE

260
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,083
PARTNER, WE'RE IN PROCESS OF

261
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,250
NEGOTIATING WITH THE CHINESE,

262
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,019
WHY WOULD YOU TARGET OUR ALLIES

263
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,689
IN THE EU AND CANADA AND MEXICO?

264
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:31,591
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SAY

265
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:32,559
BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES CHARGE

266
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,794
FIVE TIMES TO US WHAT WE CHARGE

267
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:36,196
TO BRING THEIR GOODS INTO OUR

268
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:37,630
COUNTRY.

269
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,265
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS,

270
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:40,233
ZACH, AND LET ME GET YOUR

271
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:41,434
THOUGHTS ON THIS, WHAT HE'S

272
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,503
TRYING TO DO IS PUSH THE BALL A

273
00:07:43,503 --> 00:07:44,537
LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW, JUST A

274
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:51,745
LITTLE BIT DOWN THE LANE, IF HE

275
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:53,313
GETS A LITTLE BIT BACK, THAT'S A

276
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:53,780
STARTING POINT.

277
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,648
>> WE STARTED THE SEGMENT

278
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,784
TALKING ABOUT THIS MAY START A

279
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:58,184
WAR.

280
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,853
THE WAR DONALD TRUMP MAY NEED TO

281
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,488
WORRY ABOUT IS WITHIN HIS OWN

282
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:01,788
PARTY.

283
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:03,490
REPUBLICANS ARE SCREAMING ABOUT

284
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,258
THIS, LIKE PAUL RYAN, KEVIN

285
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:08,094
BRADY, SENATOR ALEXANDER,

286
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:09,229
SENATOR TOOMEY, COMING OUT AND

287
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,530
SAYING THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

288
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,165
THE REASON IS THAT THESE

289
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,067
POLICIES ARE GOING TO HURT TRUMP

290
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:14,400
VOTERS.

291
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,403
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AUTO JOBS,

292
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:19,172
FARM JOBS, TEXTILE JOBS.

293
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,406
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

294
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:22,342
GOING TO GET HURT BY THE

295
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,843
POLICIES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS

296
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:25,078
PUSHING THROUGH.

297
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:28,181
>> SO HOWIE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

298
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:30,283
WISE MOVE OR BIG MISTAKE?

299
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:33,086
>> WHAT THE WASHINGTON

300
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:33,686
ESTABLISHMENT FAILS TO

301
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:35,789
UNDERSTAND, WHEN HE MAKES

302
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,090
AGGRESSIVE MOVES, EVEN AGAINST

303
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,292
HIS ALLIES, IT'S HIS NEGOTIATING

304
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:39,626
STYLE.

305
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,626
IT'S PART OF AN OPENING BID.

306
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,428
HE DID IT IN REAL ESTATE.

307
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,929
GRANTED, IT'S HARDER TO DO IT ON

308
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,231
THE WORLD STAGE.

309
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,267
IN THE END, I PREDICT HE'LL BACK

310
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,736
OFF TO SOME DEGREE, HE'LL

311
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,570
PREDICT VICTORY, THERE WON'T BE

312
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,238
A TRADE WAR, BUT MEANWHILE HE'S

313
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:53,840
MOVING THE BALL BECAUSE IF YOU

314
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,708
TAKE A ROUGH POSITION, EVEN WITH

315
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,010
YOUR FRIENDS, THAT GIVES YOU

316
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,648
ROOM TO ULTIMATELY MAKE A DEAL.

317
00:09:01,648 --> 00:00:00,000
>> IT'S AN ARGUMENT AMONG FAMILY
