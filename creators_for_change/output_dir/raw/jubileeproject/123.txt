1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,380
So, consider this:

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,560
It sounds a little naive, but let me explain.

3
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:19,825
Micheal Jordan was infamous for his trash-talking on court.

4
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:22,665
But whenever his opponents talked trash back at him,

5
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,800
instead of getting rattled, Jordan used it as fuel

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,600
for his desire to play better than ever before.

7
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:30,635
The more crowds booed and the more others trash-talked back at him,

8
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,545
the more and more it only fanned the flames of his passion,

9
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:36,555
pushing him to soar to unprecedented levels of playing.

10
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:40,525
Eventually, Jordan's opponents learned never to talk back,

11
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:43,585
because they realized they were only shooting themselves in the foot.

12
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:48,755
A lot of times we think we know what inspires us or what brings us down.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,000
But, what if everything that ever happened — no matter how good or bad — was in your favor?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,080
Everything in this world can be inspiring and empowering if we choose to see it that way.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,020
We, humans, have incredible capacity to see things in different ways.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,840
Two shoe salesmen traveled to a third world country to do new business.

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
When they arrived, the first one called his wife and said "Honey, I'm coming back home."

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
"Nobody here wears shoes."

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,260
The second called his wife and said "Honey! You won't believe what I found!"

20
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,320
"No one here is wearing shoes, I can sell to the whole country."

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,320
The situation is the same for the two businessmen.

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,160
One becomes hopeless, while the other is convinced that the situation is in his favor.

23
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,860
Who's right?

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,740
Or, more importantly, which perspective is more empowering and full of possibility?

25
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,205
In life, there are the obviously good things—

26
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,535
the surprise birthday party by your friends,

27
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,925
the fantastic concert by your favorite artist,

28
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,585
or an epic comeback by your favorite soccer team.

29
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,935
Those are all super inspiring, but what about the

30
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,065
more everyday, mundane things?

31
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,920
A great song on the radio,

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
the cute smile of a baby,

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,780
a penny found on the ground,

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,800
the pretty reflections of light on the road,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,740
the calming clarity of a quiet morning,

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,580
a whole day that goes by without any terrible news.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,720
A lot of times we take these things as granted, but there's a choice to see all these things as gifts

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,000
from the universe— just for you.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
And then it feels like life is always cheering you on

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,420
with little nuggets of goodness all over the place, just for you.

41
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,860
Like it's Christmas everyday.

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,780
And that feels nice.

43
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,640
Who doesn't want to receive little nuggets of goodness from life everyday?

44
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,585
And what about the seemingly bad times?

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,960
Remember when you were younger and did that really dumb thing you learned never to do again.

46
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,205
Well, without doing that dumb thing you would have never learned, right?

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,660
Maybe all those times we failed in the past taught us how to fall down and keep getting up,

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,400
and getting up, and getting up again and again.

49
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,180
To become more resilient, more determined, more wise, and more loving.

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,780
Maybe running into these walls, though painful, are really really good things at the end of the day.

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,920
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should be happy all the time.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,940
There are times and places for grief and sadness.

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,280
If you're going through something tough right now, you're not alone.

54
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:11,265
A lot of us often feel hopeless and depressed.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,640
But somehow, when you look backwards at things years later, it's always clear where things were always headed.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,840
From the perspective of the present, our sight is limited.

57
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:24,295
And sometimes it might seem like things are going backwards.

58
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,145
But, from a birds-eye view of life, way up high,

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
there's a direction to the universe.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,280
And it's forward. Forward towards learning, growth, maturity, and unfolding of who we are.

61
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,500
And it's something worth considering—

62
00:03:38,065 --> 00:00:00,000
maybe the universe is rigged in your favor.
