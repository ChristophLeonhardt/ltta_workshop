director coats today ran through what we mean when we talk about a cyber 911 a phrase not to be tossed around casually but here for just about a minute we'll give our viewers some idea of what we mean we'll talk about it on the other side I'm concerned about a cyber 911 well let's say you shut down Wall Street for a week what does that do the world markets and people's investments let's say you crash a Bank of America or Wells Fargo or whatever and all of a sudden people are saying wait a minute what happened to my account whatever in my retirement we'll get it back okay well we've seen this and we've seen coverage of that we haven't seen the big one what about an attack on the electric grid in New England in January that maybe is sophisticated enough to take it out for three days how many people will die from from - degree weather on that I mean those are the things that I think you have to look you have to try to anticipate what are the capabilities that our adversaries now have if they wanted to use them John that gets our attention and what's the gap between that potential reality and our reality what we're doing to prevent it right now well I think we're doing a lot to prevent that kind of cyber 9/11 in the sense of preparing our defenses but on the other hand this White House has eliminated the cyber coordinator who would have been the person to organize all of the efforts in the US government the problem with cyber Brian is that everyone has a piece of it on the technical side you have the National Security Agency on the policy side you have the Department of Homeland Security and so forth and so on the Defense Department has a role you need someone to pull all of that together and no one's doing that from the White House angle and I would add this Brian in a way I think we've already had our cyber 9/11 for me it's a cyber 9/11 when 150 Americans have been exposed to Russian propaganda through Facebook as Facebook has acknowledged and countless others through Twitter the problem is that's not the of cyberattack that is dramatic in the way that the director pointed out there are all sorts of dramatic cyber events that could occur the ones he mentioned shut down all the ATMs on the East Coast for example imagine the chaos that would create frankly I don't think those kinds of things are going to happen except in the context of a war a conflict where you have escalated to that level the worry is that the adversary has the capability to do that they have that capability and so you've got to monitor their intentions very carefully a Republican has stepped up tonight in the pages of the New York Times at potential risk to his political career he's actually one of your former employees congressman will hurd republican from southwest texas a former CIA officer who has written this piece for the new york times and here is his lead paragraph over the course of my career as an undercover officer in the CIA I saw Russian intelligence manipulate many people I never thought I would see the day when an American president would be one of them director mcLaughlin do you share that assessment I do Brian I think it's a valid fear we don't know precisely what's happening in this relationship but it certainly looks that way and good on will heard for stepping up to say it you know I think his piece there is emblematic of something I was thinking just before coming on air which is I sense in the last two weeks a kind of shifting of the tide here you know you on your program and others have talked about at what point will this tip at what point will there be critical mass of objection to some of the lunacy that's going on here under this president and I think something has happened in the last two weeks when you consider director ray director Coates the Deputy Attorney General today some prominent Republicans have spoken out though not in an organized way yet about the the Russian events I just think that the way to state it boldly the United States was attacked and the president sided with the enemy in his Helsinki remarks I think that really got people's attention in a way that nothing else has up till now hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
