now we're at the residence which is essentially a home in the sky that Eddie hodda's built into its a380s so without any further ado let's check it out well the space that you have here in the residence is 125 square foot so it's as big as many New York apartments maybe bigger and basically what it comprises of is three rooms you have the living room area that we're sat in here now as chatter a 32 inch TV as well and then you move through into the ensuite bathroom which also has a shower and then the third room is the bedroom the double bedroom some of the amenities that come with the residences we have aqua de palma toiletries the bed linen is is Patrice you even get Christian Lacroix loungewear and on top of all of that you have a Sephora entrain table at your beck and call so the question everyone is thinking right now how much does all of this cost okay say to to travel from New York to have a happy return to people is approximately around about $41,000 and for someone traveling on their own it's around about $31,000 now when you make the comparison to a first-class fare it's not a huge difference but more importantly if you think about you're getting an executive jet facilities on the aircraft if he wants to take an executive jet between New York and Abu Dhabi it would cost you substantially more so this is actually a cost-effective way so this is a nice luxury so this is a money saver it's for a lot of your you
