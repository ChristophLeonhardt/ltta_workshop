Donald Trump has lashed out at Iran he tweeted on Sunday that Tehran should not threaten the u.s. otherwise it will face serious consequences and as relations between the countries continue to deteriorate the u.s. now has Iran's media in its sights they're covertly plotting terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe destroying Israel it's at the core of the regime's ideology and as committed as imported many acts of violence and terrorism against both countries now the United States is undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure campaign to cut off the funds that the regime uses to enrich itself and support death and destruction the BBG is launching a new 24/7 Farsi language TV channel it will expand not only television but radio digital and social media format so that the ordinary Iranians inside of Iran and around the globe can know that America stands with them the situation between the United States and Iran remains extremely tense and as we see now happening the US has set its sights on US media in terms of how to deal with this we've heard the announcement from the US Secretary of State that they launching a 24/7 Farsi channel now it will be under the banner of the BBG which stands for the broadcasting Board of Governors this comprises different radio and TV outlets and back in 2016 it received a budget of some 750 million dollars now what we're hearing is that this new Farsi channel will also be available on digital and on social media now we heard the US Secretary of State say there for 40 years the Iranian people had been subjected to hearing from their leaders about what a great Satan the United States was and that now finally they wouldn't have to subject themselves to fake news but prior to saying this camp I also said that the United States was undertaking tough measures against Iran of course these comments has prompted an immediate angry reaction from Tehran do not play with the lion's tail or else you will regret it now prepare also said that the United States was not afraid to challenge Iran with sanctions at the highest level and he called on other countries to also jointly combined in these economic sanctions he also went on to say that the United States was undertaking a diplomatic and financial pressure campaign against her ran that they were planning on cutting off funds so that to quote the regime would no longer be able to involve itself in death and destruction he also said that they were putting maximum pressure on the regime's ability to regenerate and move money now of course we're waiting to hear what other measures the United States is planning on putting in place we know for example that the next round of sanctions goes into effect on the 4th of August so certainly relations between the two countries increasingly getting tense a hard-won nuclear deal was struck between global powers and Iran back in 2015 in it Iran agreed to some limitations to its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions being lifted but the u.s. unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in May other signatories are determined that the agreement stays in place former US diplomat Jim Jarrah says that the u.s. intentions in Iran are clear it wants regime change I think the symbolism of giving this speech of the Reagan Library was that he was drawing an analogy to the the fall of communism that somehow that he says regime change is not the goal but frankly from what he describes it seems to me that it amounts to regime change would have to be an entirely different mode of governance in Iran from what he describes to satisfy what he laid out so I think he's basically saying that we want to support a popular movement to bring down the ayatollahs regime in the same way that communism fell in Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc and that radio broadcasting would be a catalyst for that you
