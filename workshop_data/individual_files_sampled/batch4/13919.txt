so let's talk about cultural appropriation okay over the weekend a high school girl just a just a random high school girl not not a public figure not a celebrity she tweeted a picture of herself in her prom dress and innocent enough she thought right and she was tweeting it out to her whatever a few hundred followers and she was wearing I guess a Chinese style dress and so a Chinese man Chinese American man it seems saw this tweet and he thought well let me attack this high school girl and yeah let me just do that let me try to ruin her day in her week for no reason so he screenshot of the tweet and he sent his own tweet saying my culture is not your damned prom dress my culture is not your prom dress which I mean he's right about that she never claimed it was I don't think she ever I didn't I didn't scroll through all her tweets but I don't think she ever said I'm wearing Chinese culture today I'm wearing the entirety of Chinese culture today no I think she's just wearing a dress just a dress is a dress you know but his tweet attacking this girl cyber bullying her basically got somehow 170,000 likes 170,000 and it sparked this avalanche of criticism on this girl and it started a conversation about cultural appropriation and this goes back to something I talked about last week where you see now how everybody who's on the internet now gets treated like a public figure the everybody gets this intense scrutiny over everything they say and do and anyone at all no matter who they are even if just some sub 17 year old girl going to anyone can can come under national backlash for something and so this did I guess this girl her number was up for that so now ironically this this guy Jeremy Lamb is his name and he's pictured in his Twitter avatar wearing a baseball cap board shorts and a t-shirt none of which are traditional Chinese garb I'm pretty sure in fact even his name Jeremy is not Chinese that's most certainly Western and I according to an internet search that I just did a minute ago the mo just for an example okay the most popular name the most popular male name in China right now is Jong way now the reason I bring it up is is can you imagine if some lily-white American parents who wanted to be trendy you know if they had a baby boy and they named him Zhang Wei and they sent out a tweet or something with a picture of their of their extremely white baby saying oh my little Jong Way was born eight pounds nine ounces you know what happened they would come under again intense national backlash how dare you appropriate Chinese culture by giving him a Chinese name but Jeremy has appropriated a Western name he's appropriated an entire Western wardrobe I mean everything from his hat right down those shoes okay all of it is Western and really if if we're gonna talk about appropriation if we're gonna get into the appropriation discussion and if we're gonna get into this game where we say okay you're not allowed to use anything or wear anything that doesn't originate with your culture if we're doing that it's not gonna work out too well for non-westerners because first of all by the rules of this game if the rules were applied evenly by the rules of the game if you're a non Western if you are if you are of non-western heritage first of all you need to stop doing what you're doing at this exact moment stop doing it go right now go away because you can't computers phones any kind of phone these are all Western inventions and you can't use them it's appropriation cars airplanes much of modern medicine antibiotics most of the appliances that you have in your kitchen dishwasher refrigerator all that you can't use that electricity lightbulbs movies TV photography democracy ok air conditioning I could go on and on and on and I haven't even gotten to clothing yet jeans ball caps t-shirts sneakers can't wear those under these rules can't wear them this is why cultural appropriation is utter nonsense one of the reasons anyway because it puts cultures into these boxes and it doesn't permit crossover and it denies the very diversity that the Left pretends to value above everything else they say we let you know diversity is the best thing in the world and yet they're the ones saying no you can't have that that belongs to the other culture you got to stick with your own cultures separate-but-equal called equal cultures ok stay separate stay segregated that's what they're saying or I should say let me let me clarify back up for a minute it denies you the the right to cross over into another box if you're white so it's a one-way ticket here basically if it tells whites to stay in their box and never go outside of it but people of other races and ethnicities they can come into our box all they want they can take what they want browse around you know look around take this they take a sneaker put on a ball cap use some air conditioning take a you know take a flight back and forth from I mean they can do whatever they want but for us we have to stay right here in this box and we can never go and do anything outside of it so the double stand the double standard is so blatant just so extremely blatant and in-your-face and and and they just just so unashamed is this shameless I should say is this double standard that it's almost shocking as a custom as we all are to the double standard it almost succeeds in shocking but the real double standard the real double standard with this appropriation stuff has nothing to do with culture or race or anything like that the thing is that because there is one place there is one place there's one area where where real live honest-to-god appropriation actually does occur harmful degrading demeaning appropriation that is happening but the one place where it actually happens the one place where appropriation actually happens and is actually harmful and is actually offensive in degrading that's the one place where the left celebrates it and of course I'm talking about men who appropriate womanhood by pretending to be women that is the one actual real example of appropriation and it's the one place where the left not it's not that they look the other way they actually applaud it and say yeah it's brave it's inspiring it's beautiful but here is real appropriation here's a man who has reduced femininity to a caricature to a cartoon basically and he says he has an urge to wear dresses and to wear high heels and to wear lipstick and that this urge somehow indicates that he's really a woman inside by intruding on womanhood he turns womanhood into nothing more than a fashion choice essentially he empties it of all of its substance he says that a woman's body what goes on inside her what goes inside her mind all of it what goes on inside her soul her ability to create human beings and to and to you know Harbor them in inside her body and to nourish them with her body all of that ok those things that are really authentically uniquely fantastically beautifully woman those things none of that all those things don't matter none of that matters according to the new way of looking at it because in order for the man to take part in womanhood well then we've got a strip womanhood of all the things that are unique to it because he can't he can't he can't have any part of that he can be a woman he says without any of that so none of that matters as long as he puts on a dress and maybe he changes his name and he grows his hair out and maybe he gets implants or something and he mutilates his genitals if he does all that well now he's a woman all the rest of the stuff that used to be the territory the the of women it doesn't matter so so see here we have the actual consequences of appropriation that the left worries will happen with cultural appropriation here we have it actually happening because their arguments what is their argument against a white girl wearing a Chinese prom dress what's their argument against what why are they worried about it what's the big deal well according to them by wearing the dress she reduces Chinese culture to a fad and to a novelty she takes part in it she benefits from it she borrows its beauty she kind of like steals it without understanding it and thus she makes it into something superficial and hollow and just like something to parade around like a costume basically she turns she Chinese culture into a into a costume that's the argument now that doesn't really happen when a white person wears a Chinese dress or when a white person I don't know whatever else gets them accused of a probe listens to Beyonce or something like that that's not that that doesn't that doesn't do any harm to anybody it doesn't cheapen Chinese culture and black culture it doesn't because cultures intermingle they blend and fashions and styles change and so that's there's this exchange between cultures that goes on and that used to be what the left you know celebrated and said we should be doing is is this intermingling and exchange of cultures but womanhood and manhood on the other hand are absolutes they are poles okay they're like North and South Poles and when men come in and they blur those lines they really do blur the lines that give women their identity because this is what the fun in order to have an identity there must be lines of distinction and it used to be and it still is scientifically but our culture doesn't recognize it anymore it used to be that we all recognized that the there were certain lines that defined a woman and those lines were really obvious among them as I said she can create a person okay she could conceive a person within her and bring that human being into the world me this is incredible ability it's such an incredible power that she has the fate of all human civilization rests on the woman because we need the woman to propagate civilization of course the woman needs the man to take part in that but but the woman has has this very essential role of actually harboring the child bringing the and then the child even when he's born you know after he's born the child has a real physical need for the mother technically the child doesn't even need the man I mean kids do need their fathers don't get me wrong but a newborn child has a physical need for the mother the newborn won't even notice his dad for like several months believe me I've had three he needs his mother so there's this that that that motherly maternal connection you know and it's just that those were the things that used to define womanhood but we've torn down those lines we've we've we've destroyed them we've obliterated them for the sake of these cross-dressing men and so the LGBT Lobby has actually done to womanhood what the left says this girl did to Chinese culture but the girl in the Chinese prom dress is villainized a man in a prom dress is canonized the girl in the dress is accused of turning Chinese culture into nothing but a dress the man in the dress actually has turned womanhood into nothing but a dress he's actually done it at least in the eyes of society yet he gives what gets away with it it's incredible all of this talk about appropriation here it is it's actually happening let's talk about that and it's doing real harm to women it's part of the reason why now you got to worry about your about your you know your your daughter ending up in a locker room or in a in a bathroom with a man because of this men have come in and appropriated woman I think they've they've even taken their bathrooms from them in their their locker rooms their private intimate spaces men have come in and taken I should specify the LGBTQ camp has come in and taken so how is this happening how is it how is this being allowed to happen well the answer is it's as I've explained in the past the left has what I call a victim pyramid or a victim hierarchy now we know that victimization is currency on the Left victim the victimization is power on the left and whoever is the the most victimized victim of all well they're going to have the most power they can do whatever they want and they can't be questioned so there's this jockeying for a position among the various demographics on the Left who can be the most victimized and there's always this competition but who's the most oppressed who's the most person who's the most bullied and so on and so forth right now the LGBT folks are at the very top of the victim of the victim hierarchy there all the way at the top they've ascended to the peak and this is a big moment for them whether they're here at the top and they're reaping all the benefits and what it means is that they can do whatever they want and nobody can criticize them and really the transgenders have even ascended to the top of the top which is what well you know now you find even I I saw some headline on Twitter recently that gay men are being told that they they can't dress as drag queens anymore because I think oh my gosh just try to wrap your head around this the new thing that I that I've seen is that gay men cannot dress like drag queens because they're appropriating from transgenders okay there that's what now it's men now men in dresses are appropriating from other men and dresses so anyway so the transgenders have ascended all the way to the top of the top of the top and they can do whatever they want and no one could criticize them because they're the most victimized of all for some you know for my observations of studying the left it seems to me and they're like I said there's a jockeying for position and kind of it's sort of this game of thrones that goes on but right now transgenders at the top and then the rest of the lgbtq XYZ squad they're there right underneath them and then racial minorities are right below them and then women women are actually kind of at the bottom right now on the left in terms of the victim hierarchy which is why even after all the the work that feminists have done after all the you know feminists have especially modern feminists they spent a lot of time finding persecution where it doesn't actually exist they find rape culture where it doesn't exist but meanwhile that you've got actual dudes walking into their bathrooms and their locker rooms and they're not allowed to complain about that they can complain about man spreading on the subway they can complain about anything else but they can't complain about that they basically been told shut your mouth and go with the program and for the most part on the left and the feminist most of them do they're put in their place by the LGBT and so they just go along with it so that's why you know that's how we've ended up in this really absurd situation and I'm sort of waiting and it's happened a little bit there's been a few examples of it there have been a few liberal feminists who have sort of very gingerly ventured into the territory of kind of criticizing the transgender thing but I'm waiting for the moment when the feminists really just gets fed up with it and they say you know what no we're not gonna tolerate this anymore I mean they've spent all this time telling men that you're not even allowed to have opinions about women's issues if you don't have a uterus that's been their refrain for decades they've said no uterus no opinion and now they've got to sit there and just deal with it while men not only have opinions about women but actually become women without uterus and they're not elected so eventually I think the feminists are going to get fed up of it with it and there's gonna be a full-on civil war on the left over this issue but as it stands right now men can appropriate all they want and it's the one kind of appropriation that the left never says anything about and that is the real reason why appropriation is nonsense all right have a great day everyone Godspeed
