1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,460
so beau let's start with Facebook you

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,530
made waves recently where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you came out</font>

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,969
and basically said look Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,650
Facebook everyone's excited about them

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,959
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and millions of users but</font>

6
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:14,980
they're always going to be crappy

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,170
businesses talk about why well I think

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">people should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be excited about them</font>

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,199
because there are fantastic products and

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,119
I made the point that the world is a

11
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:23,740
better place with those two products but

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,749
I think as businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're</font>

13
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:28,089
difficult and i saw this back when we

14
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,249
had tripod you know whenever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

15
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:31,960
communications platform where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,850
people communicating with one another

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,070
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to monetize you know</font>

18
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,710
people aren't in a commercial mindset

19
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,170
when they're talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one another and</font>

20
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,809
and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the Facebook</font>

21
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,670
story of a hundred million dollars a

22
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,590
month of revenue I mean maybe they have

23
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,710
that but they have 500 million users if

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,960
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 500 million users and all you</font>

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">have is 100 million a month in revenue I</font>

26
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean where do you go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there you know</font>

27
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,320
and so the bull story would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,510
like Google spent the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> however many</font>

29
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">years just building up the user base and</font>

30
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,199
the product then they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,760
time to monetize let's start to fill it

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,540
in so Google went from a huge search

33
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,729
engine with no revenue to suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

34
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:14,259
absolute monster and people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

35
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:15,520
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with Facebook is that</font>

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,229
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just starting to monetize it</font>

37
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:19,930
yeah I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's similar and and</font>

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,540
they're on similar paths and but the

39
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact is that the Google inventory is</font>

40
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,759
worth a lot more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a static</font>

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,490
page basically that when you do a search

42
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,930
you know you get a page that doesn't

43
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,759
change its somebody looking for

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,860
information there in a mode of trying to

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,460
find something not find people typically

46
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,710
and the inventory is proven to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be worth</font>

47
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,740
you know eight nine ten dollars per

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,619
thousand pages where as on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook you</font>

49
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,820
know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the same thing lots</font>

50
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,200
of users and now they're starting to

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,030
monetize but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of their</font>

52
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,430
monetization is starting at such a lower

53
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,350
rate than Google's did when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

54
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,990
you know their average you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> II CPMs</font>

55
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,350
are in the in the sense so I I just you

56
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,570
know similar stories which I agree with

57
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I just don't think fundamentally the</font>

58
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,220
inventory is that valuable on facebook

59
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,960
and so you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this even though they</font>

60
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,879
have this incredible super targeting

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,500
ability where I can search through

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,390
Harvard Business School graduates and

63
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,740
find the 15

64
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,780
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cambridge and just advertised</font>

65
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,480
them yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said you know if if if</font>

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,090
those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking for</font>

67
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,160
information about your product then that

68
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,870
would be a good venue to advertise to

69
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">them but they're not they're having</font>

70
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,650
conversations with other Harvard

71
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,850
Business School graduates or their

72
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,060
family or and just lobbing in ads at

73
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,820
them you can do it and it's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

74
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,860
just produces very low response rates

75
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,390
which that's what we know advertising on

76
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internets about that's always been</font>

77
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,420
the promise and the low response rate

78
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,430
mean low margins and then how about

79
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,410
other models like payment<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone is</font>

80
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,180
incredibly excited about yeah virtual

81
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,820
goods you know payments and I think all

82
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,220
of its possible you know but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it</font>

83
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">feels to me like it's all very nascent</font>

84
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,080
and I'm not saying facebook isn't an

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
interesting and valuable business but

86
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,250
the 25 billion dollar valuation that's

87
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,990
been placed on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the private</font>

88
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,640
markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean have we seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this movie</font>

89
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,200
before all of these businesses are

90
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting these huge valuations before</font>

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,670
anybody really understands<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

92
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,950
economics and margin characteristics of

93
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,960
the businesses are and I would say if

94
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current revenue</font>

95
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,030
picture it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look that good from a</font>

96
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,740
margin perspective facebook has some

97
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,290
value the question is how much value and

98
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,390
I think the markets once again are way

99
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,370
ahead of themselves in any sense of what

100
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,230
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that value should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

101
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,580
if look if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a hundred</font>

102
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,280
million dollars a month you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 20</font>

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,840
billion yeah you don't know what the

104
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">margins are but you know maybe it's</font>

105
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,080
worth four<font color="#E5E5E5"> or five billion dollars you</font>

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or five times revenue is a</font>

107
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,690
reasonable multiple that you know some

108
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,340
of the better digital media companies

109
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,380
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting I think you know four or</font>

110
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,970
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe six billion dollars as a</font>

111
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,830
reasonable value if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing 100</font>

112
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,940
million a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> in revenue that they</font>

113
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,590
claim to be doing and so last question

114
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,630
quickly thoughts on twitter which is

115
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,580
finally just rolled out I I think

116
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,670
Twitter I love Twitter I mean it's a

117
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,650
fantastic news aggregation service it's

118
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,060
a great way to keep in touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people</font>

119
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,820
again I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's it's short you</font>

120
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,010
know communications between people you

121
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,329
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

122
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,720
place for advertising I think that's

123
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,339
will be proven out you know when they

124
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,990
start adding ads as they've announced

125
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,430
that they will I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what they'll find</font>

126
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,200
is that sure some people will click on

127
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the adds</font>

128
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,880
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know II</font>

129
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">CPMs will be low and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means they're</font>

130
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,710
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to get to the place</font>

131
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,350
where you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll 500 million people</font>

132
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,750
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter maybe but even if it follows</font>

133
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,610
the same trajectory as Facebook and I

134
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,930
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will because it's not as</font>

135
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,610
rich a service in terms of its

136
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,340
communications platform you know I still

137
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that the market is ahead of itself</font>

138
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,640
in terms of what it's worth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,260
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> worries me about this is</font>

140
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,330
these are such valuable things you know

141
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,520
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I watched the first</font>

142
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,110
generation of these social networking

143
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,880
services like tripod and Geocities go

144
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,100
away because the market got way ahead of

145
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,200
itself the companies that acquired those

146
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
companies couldn't turn the reality of

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,090
the business into<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they had paid for</font>

148
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,620
them and they shut them down and that's

149
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,840
too bad i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate to see something</font>

150
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,400
like Facebook or Twitter go that

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,860
direction because the world does need

152
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,780
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so than</font>

153
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,520
they need the content companies that I

154
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,260
invest in you know but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font>

155
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,060
sort of political and social value is

156
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,380
actually greater than their economic

157
00:05:25,380 --> 00:00:00,000
value
