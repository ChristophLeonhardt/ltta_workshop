1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,237
DEMOCRAT.

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:04,138
>> Bret: INTERESTING RACE.

3
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:05,273
THE GENERAL IS A DIFFERENT

4
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:06,073
PICTURE.

5
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:06,874
THANK YOU.

6
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,376
EARLIER TODAY, I SPOKE WITH JOHN

7
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,011
COX WHO HOPES TO FIRST MAKE IT

8
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,614
ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER AND

9
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,516
THEN UPSET THE FAVORED DEMOCRAT

10
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,484
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN

11
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,051
NEWSOM.

12
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,253
I BEGAN BY ASKING ABOUT THE KEY

13
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:19,720
ISSUES.

14
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,057
>> THERE'S TWO KEY ISSUES.

15
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,059
SANCTUARY STATE LAW WHICH THE

16
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,927
POLITICIANS IN SACRAMENTO PAST

17
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:27,862
AND THE PUBLIC IS UP IN ARMS

18
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:32,232
ABOUT BECAUSE IT PROTECTS

19
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,669
CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS INSTEAD

20
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:35,837
OF TRYING TO PROTECT LAW-ABIDING

21
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:37,038
CITIZENS IN THE POPULATION.

22
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,308
THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS THE GAS

23
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,577
TAX AND THE CRUSHING TAX BURDEN

24
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:43,845
IN CALIFORNIA.

25
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:45,580
INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY DOING

26
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,549
SOMETHING ABOUT THE WASTE AND

27
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,821
CORRUPTION IN CAL TRANS, THE

28
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:54,556
POLITICIANS PASSED A HUGE NEW

29
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:57,492
GAS TAX, GASOLINE IN THE STATE

30
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,426
IS ALREADY OVER $4 A GALLON AND

31
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,496
IT'S GOING TO $5 A GALLON BY THE

32
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:02,263
END OF THE YEAR.

33
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,999
IT'S A REGRESSIVE TAX AND IT'S

34
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:06,634
CRUSHING WORKING PEOPLE.

35
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,036
>> Bret: THE TOP TWO DEMOCRATS

36
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,338
AND REALLY, YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR

37
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,173
ONE OF THE TOP TWO SPOTS, ON THE

38
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,575
ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AT A DEBATE

39
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:16,544
EARLIER THIS MONTH, SAID THIS.

40
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,179
>> I THINK WE NEED TO

41
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:18,880
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DREAMERS

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,219
DIDN'T COME HERE ON THEIR OWN.

43
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,221
WE'VE GOT TO SAY THAT THEY HAVE

44
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,022
A RIGHT TO HAVE LEGALIZED

45
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:27,756
STATUS.

46
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:30,425
>> I'M GOING TO PUSH BACK

47
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,861
AGAINST JOHN COX, TRAVIS ALLEN,

48
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,029
AND DONALD TRUMP.

49
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,997
THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC

50
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,465
THAT HAS NO PLACE IN CALIFORNIA.

51
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,867
>> Bret: YOU CAN HEAR THE

52
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,068
CHEERS THEY ARE.

53
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,636
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO

54
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:42,937
QUESTION WHETHER, IF YOU GET TO

55
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,873
ONE OF THE TOP TWO SPOTS, THAT

56
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,242
YOU CAN ACTUALLY PULL OFF A

57
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:50,445
REPUBLICAN WIN IN CALIFORNIA?

58
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,882
>> IAM A JACK KEMP REPUBLICAN.

59
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,383
I SERVED ON HIS PRESIDENTIAL

60
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:59,220
STEERING COMMITTEE IN 1997.

61
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,155
JACK ALWAYS CELEBRATED ILLEGAL

62
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:00,555
IMMIGRATION.

63
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,157
I THINK WHAT WE ARE TALKING

64
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,158
ABOUT HERE IS ILLEGAL

65
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,026
IMMIGRATION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

66
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:07,028
THE SANCTUARY STATE LAW IS ABOUT

67
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,763
CRIMINALS HELD BY

68
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,833
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MS-13 GANG

69
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,635
MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE.

70
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,537
AND THEY ARE BEING RELEASED INTO

71
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,971
THE POPULATION WITHOUT INFORMING

72
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,272
I.C.E.

73
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:20,241
I THINK THE PUBLIC IS OUTRAGED

74
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:20,642
ABOUT THAT.

75
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,644
IF SOMEBODY WHO HAS COMMITTED A

76
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:24,846
CRIME IS IN THE HANDS OF

77
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:25,680
LAW ENFORCEMENT, I WANT I.C.E.

78
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,815
INFORMED.

79
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,450
I WANT THAT PERSON DEPORTED.

80
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,918
THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE

81
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:30,585
THIS IS ABOUT RACISM.

82
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:34,622
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT ABOUT

83
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,623
IMMIGRATION IN GENERAL.

84
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,325
AND I WANT IMMIGRATION IN THIS

85
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,460
COUNTRY.

86
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,929
I CELEBRATE THE IDEA THAT THIS

87
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:42,330
COUNTRY IS THE BEACON OF HOPE

88
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,431
FOR THE WORLD.

89
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,299
BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE CUTTING

90
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:44,632
IN LINE.

91
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,234
I WANT PEOPLE COMING TO THIS

92
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,535
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

93
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,737
I THINK WE NEED TO STREAM LIVE

94
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:54,843
DOWN -- STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS.

95
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,177
WE I WANT A GROWING ECONOMY AND

96
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,679
YOU GET THAT WITH MORE PEOPLE

97
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,680
CONTRIBUTE IN.

98
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,849
I FAVOR WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

99
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,450
TALKING ABOUT.

100
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,652
THE END TO CHAIN MIGRATION.

101
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,653
THE OPPORTUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO

102
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,722
CAN COME TO THE COUNTRY AND GROW

103
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,257
THE NATION AND MAKE IT CONTINUE

104
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:11,059
TO BE THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN

105
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:11,493
THE WORLD.

106
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,628
>> Bret: FOR PEOPLE AROUND THE

107
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,063
NATION, THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

108
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,865
THERE, AT THE END YOU HEARD HIM

109
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,634
SAY I'M GOING TO FIGHT JOHN COX

110
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,435
AND DONALD TRUMP.

111
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:21,035
THE CHEERS.

112
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:24,038
IN REALITY, BECAUSE OF THE

113
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,041
POLITICS OF THIS PRIMARY, GAVIN

114
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,643
NEWSOM IS REALLY KIND OF

115
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,645
SUPPORTING YOU IN A WAY NOW,

116
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:31,012
ISN'T HE?

117
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,081
>> HE WOULD LIKE TO RUN AGAINST

118
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:33,882
ME.

119
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,483
HILLARY WANTED TO RUN AGAINST

120
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,886
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO, AND WE KNOW

121
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,420
HOW THAT TURNED OUT.

122
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,088
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A

123
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:40,655
BUSINESSMAN.

124
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,857
HE HAS ENDORSED ME BECAUSE I'M A

125
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:43,858
BUSINESSMAN.

126
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,693
YOU KNOW, BRET, BUSINESS PEOPLE

127
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,262
LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS.

128
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:47,996
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

129
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:48,296
DOING.

130
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,864
HE IS TRYING TO SOLVE THE

131
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,266
IMMIGRATION PROBLEM AND HE IS

132
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:53,501
DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE

133
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,302
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

134
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,137
I INTEND AS A BUSINESSMAN TO

135
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,205
DELIVER RESULTS FOR THE PEOPLE

136
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:58,973
OF CALIFORNIA AND MAKE THIS

137
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,909
STATE AFFORDABLE, MAKE IT OPEN

138
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:01,809
FOR BUSINESS.

139
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,445
FIX OUR ROADS, FIX OUR SCHOOLS,

140
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,514
FIX OUR WATER SYSTEM.

141
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,916
MAKE THIS STATE AFFORDABLE AND

142
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,817
SUSTAINABLE AND LIVABLE FOR THE

143
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,153
WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS STATE.

144
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,721
MR. NEWSOM IS A POLITICIAN FROM

145
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,323
THE WORD GO.

146
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,089
HE IS A BAY AREA ELITIST.

147
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,293
HE'S GOING TO BE MORE OF THE

148
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,596
SAME, MORE JERRY BROWN BIG

149
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,599
GOVERNMENT, MORE TAXES AND A

150
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:25,767
CRUSHING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM.

151
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,634
WE CAN'T CONTINUE DOWN THAT

152
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:26,935
ROAD.

153
00:04:26,935 --> 00:04:28,336
WE ARE GOING TO GET A LOT OF

154
00:04:28,336 --> 00:00:00,000
CHANGE IN 2018.
