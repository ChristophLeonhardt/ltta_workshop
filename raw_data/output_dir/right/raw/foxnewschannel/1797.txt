HE'S GETTING SOME HEAT FOR

58
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,320
TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT CENTRAL

59
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,689
AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS THAT COME

60
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:02,826
ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

61
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:15,005
THIS IS PEOPLE WHO MOVE IN

62
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:15,772
ILLEGALLY TO THE UNITED STATES

63
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:16,306
ARE NOT CRIMINALS.

64
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,073
BUT THEY'RE ALSO NOT PEOPLE WHO

65
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:17,874
WOULD EASILY ASSIMILATE INTO THE

66
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:18,308
UNITED STATES.

67
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:21,945
THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY ROLE

68
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:32,188
PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRIES THEY

69
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:32,956
COME FROM WITH THE FOUR THROUGH

70
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:33,656
SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION, THEY

71
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:34,391
DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH, THAT'S A

72
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:34,758
BIG THING.

73
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:35,492
THEY DON'T INTEGRATE REAL WELL,

74
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:36,092
THE DON'T HAVE SKILLS.

75
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:40,497
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE

76
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:45,435
DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE PEOPLE

77
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:46,136
CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER,

78
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:46,736
THIS IS WHO THEY ARE.

79
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:47,504
AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WANTS

80
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,238
A MERIT-BASED SYSTEM NOT JUST

81
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:59,149
RANDOM PEOPLE COMING IN.

82
00:02:59,149 --> 00:02:59,816
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

83
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:00,550
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING IN THE

84
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,317
BEST PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE INTO

85
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:01,751
THIS COUNTRY?

86
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,585
THE FACT THAT WE CARE MORE ABOUT

87
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:03,219
FEELINGS AND KINSHIP OVER

88
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:03,920
IMPROVING UNITED STATES OF

89
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,621
AMERICA IS THE PROBLEM.

90
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:13,696
>> IT IS AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL

91
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:14,397
BECAUSE THEY FEEL SORRY FOR

92
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:14,697
THEM.

93
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:15,465
YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL SORRY FOR?

94
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:16,132
I FEEL SORRY FOR AMERICAN

95
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:16,866
WORKERS BORN HERE TRYING TO

96
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:22,305
RAISE A FAMILY AND THE INFLUX OF

97
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:23,006
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN SOME

98
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:23,640
CASES BRINGING CRIME AND

99
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:31,448
LOWERING PROPERTY VALUES AND

100
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:32,182
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE I FEEL

101
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:32,582
SORRY FOR.

102
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:33,316
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE

103
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:34,084
DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LINE,

104
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:42,725
YOU WAIT IN THE LINE LIKE OTHER

105
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:43,059
PEOPLE.

106
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,827
WHEN YOU'RE AT A RESTAURANT CUT

107
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:44,594
IN LINE YOU DON'T TAKE IT VERY

108
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:44,994
LIGHTLY.

109
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:45,662
>> THESE PEOPLE NEED TO

110
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:46,429
UNDERSTAND IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO

111
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:47,163
BE AN AMERICAN AND A PRIVILEGE

112
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:47,630
TO WORK TOWARD.

113
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,767
NOT A RIGHT.

114
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:51,534
YOU DON'T COME INTO THE COUNTRY

115
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:52,235

AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE
LANGUAGE.

119
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:09,919
AND COME INTO THE COUNTRY

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,687

WE DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPORTING

125
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,057
PROPERTY.

126
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:14,824
