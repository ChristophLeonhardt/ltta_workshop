working out what Twitter things as right or wrong is no easy task take the controversial American preacher Louis Farrakhan he wrote this I'm not an anti-semite an anti termite he wasn't clear enough he even added a video you know what they do call me an anti-semite stop it I'm anteater my I'm not mad at you because you're so stupid and it's not the first time his fat his feet with such comments but there is no policy violation for Twitter which says a crackdown on dehumanizing language has not yet come into effect the company has been quick to pounce on others though reportedly doing everything it can to stop the popular new meme showing liberals as NPCs all that gaming term refers to non playable characters as in background characters pre-programmed with limited reactions there's no need to get violent they're represented by a gray faced generic character with a bland expression the character is meant to represent people who do not think for themselves or I enable of having an internal monologue bearing many similarities to the terms basic and noemy you can see why the anti-liberal brigade loves them Twitter though is not soaked in slapping bench all over the place him them the scope of the banning is unclear but such is the memes popularity twitter is struggling to keep up you
