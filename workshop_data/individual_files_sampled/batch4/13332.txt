Republicans are saying the Democrats only want the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh because they wanted to lay his confirmation until after the midterms Democrats say that claim should be investigated by the FBI until after the midterms president trump ordered the FBI to investigate the sexual malfeasance claims against Cavanaugh after Senator Jeff Flake caved to the Democrats demands because two leftist activists women shrieked at him in an elevator Flake says this was his quote I'm not Spartacus moment referring to the famous scene in the movie Spartacus when shrill women shrieked at the rebel gladiators until they all turned Spartacus over to the authorities shouting he's the one over there who looks like Kirk Douglas when it was explained to flake that that's not actually what happened in the movie flake responded quote oh then I guess I'm just a cowardly eunuch unquote the FBI has been assigned the task of finding out what happened 35 or 36 years ago in a place no one can identify at a party no one remembers in a room no one was in in an op-ed in the New York Times a former newspaper dishonest ex FBI chief James Comey said the FBI is well able to perform that task Comey wrote quote if I can make up all that Russian collusion crap surely the agents now in place can come up with some nonsense unquote Democrats are insisting that the feds can only get to the truth if they interview every screeching nudnik connected to left-wing advocacy groups willing to make up stories about a man they never met only after all these stories have been discounted the Democrats say Canmore stories that need to be investigated be made up Democrats who once said Republicans were destroying the people's trust in our institutions by criticizing the FBI are now criticizing the FBI for not being thorough enough and they say it should be investigated by the FBI when told that made no sense Democrats responded whatever as long as it takes until after

an instinct I have but it really does feel to me like the case against threat Cavanaugh is cratering and as it craters the reason I say that it I feel it's cratering is I noticed the left and the media but I repeat myself because they're both the same they're shifting the field of play alright they're shifting it away from sexual malfeasance he did this to a woman he did that to a woman and we know we know this because the New York Times a former newspaper it used to be a newspaper but now what it is it is the talking point of the left it is the place where the left goes to find out what the plan is it's like a little signal you know they send up smoke signals from the New York Times and the left reads the New York Times and then they know what the new strategy is so today they announce that there's a shift in strategy for the left story by Sheryl gasps Stolberg just talking to the left what we're doing now a new front in the Cavanaugh Wars temperament and honesty Democratic efforts to highlight sexual assault charges that are more than thirty years old have been dismissed by supporters of Judge Brett M Cavanaugh as the dredging of ancient history but the judges response to those accusations has raised new issues that go to the court of who president Trump's Supreme Court nominee is right now his truthfulness his partisanship and his temperament so pay attention to what they said all lies right some people have said this is ancient history but a lot of people are just saying it's not true and that of course is what they're worried about they've now got what they wanted they demanded an FBI investigation they got it and now I have this feeling they're getting they had a lot of sources the times on the FBI the FBI's been leaking them forever I'm sure they're getting that they cannot do this so we're shifting - his temperament now what does that mean means a it means they got nothing so they're going to talk about his anger and this is directed mostly to women because women get very frightened by male anger I don't blame them men are bigger and they can be violent and when men get angry women have this natural cringe reaction and when a lot of women saw Brett Kavanaugh protesting his innocence in this angry voice they had that reaction they got they own oh no I did that I don't like at all but let me talk about this for just a minute a judge who isn't angry at the lynch mob that is coming after this man does not deserve to be a judge a judge who isn't angry at the sight of a lynch mob like what the left has become in this story does not deserve to be a judge a lawyer who isn't furious at the sight of moral panic overriding due process of law should lose his license to practice law a good man who loves justice and is not appalled beyond words are with the Democrats the press and the left-wing activists are doing right now today would not be a good man and would not be a man who loves justice you want to know about judge Cavanaugh's qualities his qualification to be a judge you want to know about his temperament they've got 300 plus decisions that he wrote that they can sit there and read instead of doing what they're doing instead of screaming at people and in elevators instead of tearing somebody's reputation sort of tearing people apart with unsupported uncorroborated accusations they could read his decisions and decide whether he has the temperament to do this if Cavanaugh is a judge if he is a lawyer if he's a man of justice he should be enraged beyond all measure a lot of times you will hear me say that anger is the devil's cocaine and the reason I say that is because while some anger is righteous anger is not the same thing as righteousness but this is righteous anger he should be angry for himself you should be angry for his family but more than anything else he should be angry for the left to the at the left for stirring up the mob against due process and the rule of law so let's look at the mob today let's look at what they're up to the screaming the moral panic the New York Times they're big big breaking story Cavanaugh was involved in a bar altercation at Yale okay here's the story as an undergraduate student at Yale red Cavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar during which he was accused of throwing ice on another patron according to a police report I you call Batman right because isn't that that doctor right what the hell it was a guy named Arnold Schwarzenegger played him I mean mr. freeze thank you very much mr. freeze so obviously Brett cab I think they've revealed the New York Times has got him Brett Kavanaugh is mr. freeze it was just that it was just Arnold Schwarzenegger pretending to be Brett Kavanaugh the incident which occurred in September 1985 during mr. Cavanaugh junior year resulted in mr. Cavanaugh and four other men being questioned by the New Haven Police Department by the way I my son went to Yale I'm sure these kind of crushes a lot essentially what they're saying is they're accusing Brett Kavanaugh of drinking in college which is like accusing him of having temper tantrums when he was two years old it really is if the New York Times ran a front-page story police reports show that Brett Kavanaugh as a two year old was throwing blocks and crying loudly and mothers rushed to the scene of his angry rants when is this the match is this the kind of temperament you want in a it's like he was never supposed to be young he was never supposed to do things he shouldn't do would you want to stand before that judge I mean is that amazing would you want to stand before a judge who had never done anything wrong who couldn't understand what people were and what you know how they acted when they were young and had no compassion unbelievable unbelievable story it is just the mob it's just about the fact that the real charges the charges that matter are falling apart MSNBC this is just an amazing piece of video I've got a play for you they had Julie sweat Nick on right she's the woman who said that there were these gang rape parties like ten of them and I went to ten of them like you know pop you know it's like Julie stop going to the gang rape parties you know when you get the invitation it says please come to my gang rape party no don't go don't go to the gang rape party stay home watch TV you know Netflix and chill you know it's like do not go to the guy but Cates an NBC reporter and IIIi really feel for her because as a journalist she's interviewing this woman and she can tell this woman story is unraveling so she starts to ask her about discrepancies did she really mean in her statement that she made to the committee did she mean these things so she starts off by asking her sweat Nick said that she saw Kavanaugh spiked the punch so he could get women drunk to prepare them for the satanic date rate I think there's a date written human sacrifices that would oh yes you know you know the usual thing that happens at these part I mean are we gonna hold him accountable listen to the you can watch on screen as her story falls apart did you see Brett Kavanaugh you know spiking the punch putting guys I saw I saw him given Red Solo cups a few girls during that timeframe and there was grain punch at those parties and I would not take one of those glasses from Marc Kavanagh Brett Kavanaugh excuse me I saw him around the punch I won't say bowls or the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him buy them yes in her declaration Sweatt Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by Marc judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be gang-raped in a side room or bedroom by a train of numerous boys I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included Marc judge and Brett Kavanaugh what did you say he's very innocent well until what happened to me happen to me I didn't put two and two together but I would see boys standing outside of rooms congregated together sore like a gauntlet and I didn't know what was occurring out but I would see them laughing a lot of laughing so they were drinking punch and laughing this is how it's like so it's sort of like gang rape but sort of like a you know gang rape or drinking punch and laughing it's really a you know those two things once you see one you can just deduce the other I mean it was it was embarrassing it was embarrassing and and you know Kate snow started off the report by saying she contradicted herself she has no karate we call she says kate snow says we called all these people nobody will corroborate your stories why'd you have her on why is she news I mean anybody can say anything about anyone and now there's a report I think in the AP that's that said that starts to talk about the fact that she hasn't been involved in at least six legal cases over the past twenty five years some of which involved what evidence strongly suggests are multiple false claims okay she had a legal dispute highlighted by the AP in nineteen ninety four personal injury lawsuit sweat Nick filed against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority which contains strong evidence that she attempted to swindle the department AP reports that sweat Nix sued the Transit Authority for four hundred twenty thousand dollars in earnings she said she allegedly lost after hurting her nose and a fall I mean you know if her boyfriend to says she's kind of a kook David French over at NRO a lawyer he says all of these charges are falling apart that is why we're hearing about temperament that is why we're hearing about drinking which by the way is not against the law that is why we're hearing all this stuff it's meant to scare women it is essentially meant to scare women there is a big gender gap in the voting right now right now the polls are kind of shifting around very hard to read and so this is having an effect on the midterm but we don't know what it is yet so so David French at NRO starts to debunk a lot of the other charges he says Deborah Ramirez's allegations she's the one who said Cavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale that's where it was it's uncorroborated difficult to believe she was drinking heavily at the time she confesses that her memory contains gaps she even told other classmates that she wasn't service certain it was Kavanagh no one else could even confirm she was at the party where the incident allegedly occurred let me pause right there for just a minute on get back to this but first I have to talk about blue apron blue apron delivers fresh ingredients to your house and with step-by-step recipes so that within twenty minutes you can prepare yourself a meal that looks like it came from a restaurant I have eaten these meals they are they are actually restaurant meals that you cook in your home and when I say you what I mean is my wife while I sit and watch her and say wow you're doing such a great job honey because I that's you know the way I roll these are quick and easy recipe options with insanely delicious flavors let me just read you some of this month's cuz they change all the time and they react to what you want you know they like what they want to hear what you want tomato and basil pesto pizza now that's just not something you make at

men our menu and get your first three meals for free that is very inexpensive free at blue apron calm slash Andrew that's blue apron dot-com slash Andrew to get your first three meals for free blue apron it is a better way to cook alright so that is Cavanaugh that is I'm sorry the sweat Nick charges and the Ramirez charges and then David French goes on to say Ford has about Christine blazing for the main charge this is the charge that started at all Ford has no corroborating witnesses and even the friend she says was that the party in question has denied being there and knowing Cavanaugh at all she doesn't know who invited her to the party where it took place how she got there how she got home after by her account kept but the problems go beyond gaps in memory she's offered substantially different accounts of when it occurred goes on and on so listen to what they do listen to how low in the absence of evidence listen to how low the left is sinking I mean it is you know I always say this the bad ideas degrade you bad ideas turn one of the ways you can tell that your ideas are bad is when you start behaving badly the ACLU which used to be the defender of due process used to defend due process whether you were a Nazi or communist or whatever they put out this ad to convince people to turn away from Cavanaugh listen to the logic of this it is absolutely amazing we've seen this before the denials from powerful men I did not have sexual relations with that one I've never seen anything like this I categorically and unequivocally to deny the allegation against me by dr. Ford America is watching and as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court integrity matters and we cannot have any doubt that is shocking I mean it is SH I'm not easily shocked but that's shocking let me let me put this for you somebody says you raped me when you didn't and you say I didn't do it I didn't do it and they said well we've seen that before here's Bill Cosby denying that he did it here's Bill Clinton denying that he did it and here's you denying that you did it what's the difference you didn't do it you didn't do it this is the kind of thing they're sinking to they put out a cartoon of you know Kavanagh said his little girl was praying for Blasi Ford they put out a cartoon in the Illinois Times dear god there's a little girl praying dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting doctor for their attacking the guys kids right this is what they have become this is what the left has become no wonder he's angry he should be angry he would not be a man of justice he would not be a man of the law if he were not angry at what is being done and remember remember what they're fighting for they're not fighting for a fair reading of the Constitution by liberal judges they are reading to rewrite fighting to rewrite the Constitution and fighting against a man who will interpret the Constitution as it was written according to the wall so I'm gonna get back to this story again and talk a little bit more about Kavanagh and Donald Trump because there's something about this that people are not noticing at all but I want to take a bit of a break this is a shorter portion of the show and I just want to talk about the left and language because every other Tuesday I have a video coming out called the lefties dictionary and I've been going through the letters A's for antifa B's for budget cuts D was for diversity and E I was for intersectional ISM so we're coming up on J I think it is it is it not J is next week oh I'm sorry is all I is for intersectionality and my mistake so the reason I do this is because the left is expert at using language they are expert at using language to make ordinary things seem evil right so they will say something like racial profiling and you think all racial that's bad racial profiling is bad you know must be a mess it's got racial it's got profiling police are doing it and they you know this all this trouble with the police but think about this for a minute you put a cop out on the street or even more you put a tsa agent and on a line she has got 15 to 30 seconds to judge whether you were gonna blow up a plane he's got to use every piece of information he's got one of them maybe that you're carrying the Koran because a lot of terrorists are bad guys a lot of terrorists are Islamic he's not being bigoted he's not being bigoted the problem is that the decent innocent Islamic guy is being tarred by the bad guy but the bad guy but the TSA agent has to make his decision in a moment so racial profiling is a term they used to make that sound like it's evil when it isn't so I putting out the Lefty's dictionary to translate these terms into ordinary English things that sound like they make sense from the left but maybe don't quite make so much sense and we're hoping we're gonna try and put this together as a book in time for Christmas so you have something to give your left-wing friends so that they'll hate you because there's nothing better at Christmastime than having your friends absolutely furious that you've foaming at the mouth so here is I for intersectionality in the Lefty's dictionary I I is for intersectionality intersectionality is the theory that people can be understood from intersecting social identities such as race gender class and sexual orientation it's only when the effect of all these inter woven identities is fully understood that a person knows how much he's allowed to blame his crappy life on white men blaming one's crappy life on white men is called being oppressed and being oppressed gives you the right to shout stupid stuff while wearing a pink hat it makes you look like a complete idiot this is a good thing because it keeps you from having to take responsibility for yourself which can use up a lot of your social media time if you don't have enough intersecting social identities and you are designated as just some schmuck or a white man as a white man everything's your fault and you now have to work for to pay taxes to support intersectional people so they have more free time in which to blame you for their crappy lives now you may say well wait in America people aren't really oppressed very much and they can improve their Lots by rising above the dysfunction in their communities in order to live productively these are called facts under the rules of intersectionality people using facts are fascist and can be shouted down and bigoted sticks you may say what if you shot people down and hit them with sticks then you are the fascist that is called logic and under the rules of intersectionality people using logic or fascist and can be shouted down and hit with sticks some people object to the underlying ideas of intersectionality these people say that intersectionality is just a way of organizing Americans into random interest groups in order to turn them against one another so that left this feces power by pretending they're alleviating various forms of oppression that don't actually exist these people go on to say that each person's identity is unique and god-given and that what you make of your life depends on your choices and the natural luck of the draw these people are but in fact if you were lucky enough to be born an American you've already been given a head start and have no business complaining about anything so take off your ridiculous pink hat and stop shouting stupid things and go get a job this is called truth and under the rules of intersectionality people who speak truth are fascist and can be shouted down and hit with sticks so now you understand that intersectionality is a new and original way of weaving together facts logic and truth and beating them to death I is for intersectionality I'm Andrew Clavin with the Lefty's dictionary all right that's the lefties dictionary there's one thing about this Cavanaugh story that I don't think is getting any coverage at all I mean I I think I'm the only person who has actually noticed this at least that I've heard and the reason it's not getting any coverage is because the left hates our president Donald Trump and people on the right a lot of commentators on the right are also uncomfortable with the president and don't really have I think is clear a picture of who he is and what he does as they should I've always I've always criticized him when I thought he deserved of criticism and I've always praised them when I thought he deserved praise but the one thing that I have noticed is how incredibly cool he is being in this Cavanaugh fight I mean he is sweat less he is just and look let's face it cool is not the word I would usually use to describe Donald Trump right cool is he's usually very hot-tempered he usually is a flying off the the handle he's got tweets going that maybe you shouldn't be doing he is playing this Cavanagh thing like he has got it sewed up and the reason that's important is you cannot deny you cannot deny whatever you think of Donald Trump you cannot deny his fantastic political instincts he knows what is going on with his base he knows what's going on with the country and he's got the press in his pocket he has got them he's bouncing him down the street like a basketball no matter every time they come at him it's like you think it's go this time they've got him and then he's just like you know swish they're gone you know just make something so he gave a press conference and we we have to talk about this too he goes out and gives a press conference when he wants to talk about is his new NAFTA deal it's now he has renewed NAFTA as he promised to do and it's now called this something like the US Mexico Canada Agreement the u.s. MCA or something like this now remember remember the panic and the hysteria from both right and left on this that New York Times said this is bogus because he made the deal with Mexico and said if you don't leave Canada doesn't want to renegotiate fine I'll just redo it with Mexico and everyone oh this is awful this is all the trade war the death the love the economy the crashing the The Wall Street Journal I mean people were actually popping out out of the newspaper and weeping just look at my tears the trade that would free trade is gone and suddenly at the deadline Canada says we'd like to be Pat and after to please this is an incredible incredible redemption of Donald Trump and the way and you know Walter Russell Mead who was one of the best colonists at The Wall Street Journal he says even the administration's fiercest critics are calling the revisions to NAFTA signal again the US Mexico Canada agreement requires that cars be made with 75% North American components to escape tariffs 40% of each car must be also be manufactured in facilities where workers earn 16 bucks an hour or more on average and crucially Canada has also cracked open the door to its dairy markets for American farmers so this is a big deal and and it has China worried okay and this is the thing the big target here is China because that's the big market that is treating us unfairly and suddenly suddenly the list of topics that China's censors want new sources to treat sensitively because it's a censorship society right is a revealing one recent instructions tell editors in China to be careful with economic data that suggests China is being hurt by the trade war that its economy is slowing that local government debt is growing or the consumer confidence is falling that means all those things are happening in China which is what somebody said would happen guess who Donald Trump now you remember that when this whole trade thing started what I said was I'm not gonna call this because I think Trump is a good negotiator the negotiation is emotion ago she ation is movement from one place to another and what the press does is take snapshots of each place that he is and gets hysterical about that place where Trump is thinking no I'm just trying to get to the end of this negotiation now look this thing can be voted down especially if the GOP loses in the midterms they can just throw this new agreement away but it's obviously a good agreement it obviously justifies Trump's strategies and his tactics in fact in fact I think this calls for the Trump happiness montage let's head it we're gonna win economically we're gonna win with the economy we're gonna win with military we're gonna win with house carrots for our veterans we're gonna win with every single facet zip to be a my oh my what a wonderful day we're gonna win so much you may even get tired of winning yeah you'll say please please it's too much winning we can't take it anymore I do pretty oh so pretty I feel pretty and witty again we have to keep winning so trunk walks out in front of the press and he just he just slaps them silly he comes out it's just plain cut number five I think the press has treated me unbelievably unfairly in fact when I won I said the good thing is now the press finally gets it now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse they're worse now than ever they're Loco but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico I can say that because we make the deal with Mexico we weren't gonna make he's just bouncing him down the street so all they want they don't want to talk about trade and the funny thing is Trump is all about trade this is one of his big big promises that he was gonna rework this stuff but they don't to talk about trade all Cavanagh all the time just listen to how cool he is talking about this they asked him about the FBI investigations to cut things I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand this is our 7th investigation of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma for a man that's never had any accusation any he's never had a bad statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one in his class at Yale he was number one in his law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so I want the FBI this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like they you know just starting I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation they can't lay a glove on him on this and it's interesting because you know he's not always like this we have to admit this about him he can get hot-headed he can especially when he's attacked but he has just been he just looks like he has got this in his pocket and he says you know yeah the FBI let him do what they want and their and so they've tried to shift it this is the other thing they try to shift it to drinking and that was absolutely hilarious and he then goes off on the people who are asking for these investigations let's play cut number seven now they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at the bringing up subject we would know about this over the last twenty years thirty years of his career you know what happened to going back to high school and they're saying he drank a lot one evening in high school well you know I tell you what I happen to know some United States senators one who is on the other side who's pretty aggressive I've seen that person in very bad situations okay I've seen that person in very very bad situations somewhat compromising and you know I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however whatever the Senators want is okay with me I gotta say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to Daily wire calm and subscribe for a lousy ten bucks tomorrow is the mail bag you will want to be in the mail bag it's a little stuffy but you can ask any question you want and I will answer it my answers are 100% correct guaranteed correct so I mean what what better deal for a lousy ten bucks a month or just a hundred bucks for the whole year so listen to the way Trump just played that about the alcohol thing they're trying to shift it to alcohol and he says you want to talk about drinking you want to talk about drinking let's talk about the Senate drinking in the Senate I mean the stories about the drinking in the Senate are incredible and you know he's pulling the rug out from under them because the whole thing the whole thing was not about drinking it wasn't about temperament it was about did he try to rape a girl when he was 17 years old that was what it's about it's all that they're just trying to move the goalposts so what it's about and he's just call you Mallory and he just and I my favorite remark and this whole press conference when he starts talking about about drinking and the fact that he doesn't drink and this is cut number 11 I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right it's one of my only good traits I don't drink whenever they're looking for something that I said never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess I'd be would I be the one be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watched that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drink the one question I didn't ask is how about the last 20 years have you had difficulty last 20 years cuz nobody said anything bad about him how confident do you have I mean and actually Trump this is the thing Trump is talking sense they're talking about whether he drank in college they're talking about whether he drank in high school how about the last 20 years oh what's his life been like I mean how confident do you have to be as president to say the fact that I don't drink is my only good trait and can you imagine what a monster I would be if you you know just how he's just is feeling like he is filling his shoes I'm sorry but people don't notice this because a lot of people don't like Trump and they don't notice the way he changes and the way he adapts I've always said he's a very adaptable guy he's a guy who learns on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has but that but that is incredibly this is like the the press is an absolute hysteria mode the left absolute hysteria mode Jeff Flake gets yelled at in an elevator he collapses Trump is like a rock I mean I'm serious this is not normal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always in there fighting I'm not saying that but he's not always just as confident and cool about the whole thing he does not seem like he has anything at risk and when they ask him for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want the FBI think is nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when he said it's a blessing in disguise because it's called them out that's why they have to change their tune but when they asked for more time he has this great response and cut ten tell me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a really thorough investigation we had all the time in the world she didn't have to wait till after the hearing was closed essentially she should have said listen I have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the earrings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited till we would closed and then she probably leaked it but you know Who am I to say but she probably leaked it based on a very bad body language the other day but more importantly in a sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm including you to the media right I consider you a part of the Democrat Party but for you for the Democrats to be talking about we want more time for the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up that that is amazing it's just an amazing stuff because you could see the reporter is asking the question I didn't know who it was was a lady reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats she looked like she kind of went kind of rippled like he had struck her almost the gunite is in complete control in this press conference partly I'm sure it's because of the victory of NAFTA which really does redeem a lot of what a lot of the attacks it really answers a lot of the attacks on him but partly it has got to be because he feels he has got this thing wrapped up and I just this is part of why I think this Cavanaugh thing is collapsing they are not going to sell even the people on the Left who are undecided they're not going to sell you that yeah we said he raped somebody it's not rape but he was drinking I mean this is what they reduced to yeah but he did stand near the punch bowl he was stat you know he was standing with and he didn't get in it he threw some ice of the guy in college not going to wash I just don't think so and I think that you know I take this from the fact that the left is moving the goalposts the left is now changing the subject basically because this once this FBI I think started it was kind of like yeah I think we got nothing so they're changing it to temperament and did he drink in college and did he throw a piece of ice and all this stuff and the fact that Trump has just remained at chill I mean chill Trump is not what I'm used to I think the case against Kavanagh is falling absolutely to pieces all right time for sexual follies so I had a prettier video come out two days ago day ago 24 hours ago so they've got a million hits on YouTube already it's an attack on feminism it's telling why I dislike them and I'm not gonna play the video cuz that's not what I want to talk about but it please go on and watch it it's telling why I think feminism is a low stupid small-minded mean theory a philosophy that degrades people and we don't need it it turns men and women against each other and and look for me I think for most of us for most of us the relationship between men and women are part of the joys of life right the most for most people the relationship between the romantic relationship the erotic relationship just an interplay between male and female is part of the chief consolations of life alright and this is just feminism has just turned us against each other make people angry to each other it's promotes anger and it doesn't help women and as I point out in the video it's the Constitution and classical liberalism take care of the rights of women I women have guaranteed their rights they should be guaranteed their rights they should I want women to do whatever they want to do I think feminism degrades their femininity it tells them that they're feminine desires are bad and that they should have masculine desires and masculine desires are the only good thing and men have stolen them from themselves that's basically what feminism says so I've been obviously getting all this hate mail and what is fascinating to me about this hate mantle is all of it accuses me of saying that women shouldn't have whatever job they want or shouldn't have whatever job they can do or it's nowhere in the video so why did that why do people say this why why are they saying this it has to be because they have conflated feminism with the rights of women and this is something the press and the left has organized it's a brainwashing thing where they would say if you would say I'm anti-feminist I said why you against women I didn't say I was against women I said I'm anti-feminist yep oh that's against women so they're just conflate they've conflated these two things they've conflated a philosophy feminism as a philosophy and and by the way I you know you cannot say oh well it's not all feminist it doesn't matter the philosophy leads to a certain place a professor of Georgetown University okay professor Georgetown universe see Christine fair an associate professor this is Georgetown is a big school right an important school she said on Saturday she said white Republican men should die and an added bonus would be if women castrate their corpses and feed them to swine now if I heard words like that coming out of my mouth if I would say gee you know something's wrong with my philosophy because I shouldn't be turning into this person I got a letter from a young woman this morning an email that starts out you're an effing idiot you know you're an effing idiot and we're not gonna let old white men tell us who our so it's full of racial hatred that's racial old white man is racial hatred ageism like something wrong with being old if you think there's something wrong with being old just wait because guess what you know I'm Anthony and then she ends and she says everything we do in the world we either do out of love or out of fear and if you're doing something out of fear you're just not getting it right so in other words she is operating out of love when she calls me an effing idiot when she says you're an old white man and white is bad the color of your skin is bad right and and that is the delusion the delusion that the left cells that we are acting out of love and by the way you stink and I hate the color of your skin and you're too old and somebody who was at one of the rappers just called Kanye West and Uncle Tom and Uncle Tom who was it Snoop Dogg so that okay and they so you know they a terrible it's a terrible racial slur and Uncle Tom doesn't matter with her a black man says it or not all of this stuff is all of this stuff that we're seeing this stuff about Brett Kavanaugh where people are reducing themselves to the mob writers for the New York Times are reducing themselves to mob think all of it is the result of philosophy Suzanna Danuta Waters Walters a professor of sociology and director of the women's gender and sexuality Studies Program in Northeastern University she writes a piece of moss in the Washington Post why can't we hate men it seems logical to hate men I can't lie I've always had a soft spot for the radical feminist smackdown they have conflated mixed-up confused a philosophy with a gender with a group of people nobody is attacking women when you attack feminism but I'm attacking is the philosophy of feminism the philosophy that divides us the philosophy that tries to organize us into grievance organized mobs grievance motivated mob and that's what we're seeing we're seeing the degradation of the left by that organization that's exactly it alright I gotta say goodbye remember remember the
