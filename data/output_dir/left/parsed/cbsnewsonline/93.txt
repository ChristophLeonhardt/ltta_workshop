>>> GETTING BIG NEWS OUT OF THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
THE FORMER CIA DIRECTOR HAS HAD 
HIS CLEARANCES REVOKED. 
WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE LIVE. 
>>  COURTESY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN 
DUE TO HIM. 
HE HAS A HISTORY THAT CALLS IN 
TO QUESTION HIS CREDITABILITY. 
IN 2014 HE DENIED TO CONGRESS 
THAT CIA OFFICIALS HAD 
IMPROPERLY ACCESSED THE 
COMPUTER FILES OF CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFFERS. 
HE TOLD THE COUNSEL OF FOREIGN 
RELATION THAT THE CIA WOULDN'T 
DO SUCH A THING. 
THE CIA'S INSPECTOR GENERAL 
WENT AGAINST HIM DIRECTLY, 
SAYING THAT AGENCY OFFICIALS 
HAD INDEED ACCESSED 
CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER FILES. 
MORE RECENTLY HE TOLD CONGRESS 
THAT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
DIDN'T MAKE USE OF THE SO-
CALLED STEEL DOSSI, ER ABOUT 
THE 2016 ELECTION. 
THE ASSERTION THAT GOES AGAINST 
TWO OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE 
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY AND ALL 
OF THE FACTS. 
ADDITIONLY HE HAS RECENTLY 
LEVER AGED HIS STATUS AS A 
FORMER HIGH RANKING OFFICIAL 
WITH ACCESS TO HIGH RANKING 
INFORMATION TO MAKE A SERIES OF 
UNFOUNDED ALLEGATIONS, WILD 
OUTBURSTS ON THE TELEVISION 
ABOUT THIS ADMINISTRATION. 
HIS LYING AND CONDUCT SHOWED BY 
INCREASINGLY FRENZIED COMMENTS 
ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH ACCESS 
TO THE NATION'S MOST CLOSELY 
HELD SECRETS. 
MORE BROADLY THE ISSUE OF HIS 
SECURITY CLEARANCE RAISES 
LARGER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
PRACTICE OF FORMER OFFICIALS 
PLAIN TAKENNING ACCESS TO 
SENSITIVE SECRETS LONG AFTER 
THEIR TIME IN GOVERNMENT HAS 
ENDED. 
SUCH ACCESS IS PARTICULARLY 
INAPPROPRIATE WHEN FORMER 
OFFICIALS HAVE TRANSITIONED 
INTO HIGHLY PARTISAN POSITIONS 
AND SEEK TO USE REAL OR 
PERCEIVED ACCESS TO VALIDATE 
THEIR POLITICAL ATTACKS. 
ANY ACCESS GRANTED TO THE 
SECRETS SHOULD BE IN 
FURTHERANCE OF NATIONAL, NOT 
PERSONAL INTERESTS. 
FOR THIS REASON I HAVE ALSO 
STARTED TO REVIEW THE MORE 
GENERAL QUESTION OF THE ACCESS 
TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BY 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. 
AS PART OF THIS REVIEW I'M 
LOOKING AT ACTION WITH RESPECT 
TO THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS. 
JAMES CLAPPER, JAMES COMEY, 
MICHAEL HAYDEN, SALLY YATES, 
SUSAN RICE, ANDREW MCABB PETER 
STRZOK, LISA PAGE AND BRUCE 
ORR. 
CLEARANCES FOR THOSE WHO STILL 
HAVE THEM MAY BE REVOKED AND 
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR 
CLEARANCES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 
HAVE IT REINSTATED. 
IT'S FOR THOSE REASON THAT I 
HAVE EXERCISED MY AUTHORITY AND 
I WILL DIRECT STAFF TO MAKE THE 
NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
APPROPRIATE AGENCIES TO PUT IN 
THIS DETERMINATION. 
WITH THAT I WILL TAKE YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
JONATHAN. 
>>  I HAVE A QUESTION I WANTED 
TO ASK YOU BUT JUST A FOLLOW UP 
ON THAT. 
IS -- IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY 
THAT YOU MENTIONED HAS BEEN A 
POLITICAL CRITIC OF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
IS HE GOING AFTER HIS OPPONENTS 
WITH THIS? 
>>  NO. 
IF THERE WERE OTHERS THAT 
WEREN'T -- THAT WE DEEMED 
NECESSARY WE WOULD TAKE A LOOK 
AND REVIEW THOSE AS WELL. 
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT'S 
ATTORNEY SAID. 
HE SAID OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL 
-- THEY NEEDS TO WRITE THE DAM 
REPORT SO WE CAN SEE IT AND 
REBUT IT AND HE SAID IF IT'S 
NOT WRITTEN WITH IN THE NEXT GO 
OR THREE WEEKS WE WILL JUST 
UNLOAD ON HIM LIKE A TON OF 
BRICKS. 
IS THE PRESIDENT OKAY WITH HIS 
ATTORNEY THREATENING THE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL IN THIS WAY? 
>>  WE HAVE MADE CLEAR WE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THIS WRAP UP FOR 
QUESTIONS SPECIFIC ABOUT 
COMMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT'S 
LAWYER I WOULD REFER YOU BACK 
TO HIM. 
FOR QUESTIONS SPECIFIC ABOUT 
THE INVESTIGATION, PARTICULARLY 
COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT'S 
LAWYER I WOULD REFER YOU BACK 
TO HIM TO ADDRESS THOSE. 
JEFF. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
IN FOLLOWING UP ON JOHN'S 
QUESTION. 
HOW IS THIS ANNOUNCEMENT -- HOW 
CAN AMERICANS NOT SEE THAT AS 
-- GETTING BACK AGAINST HIS 
CRITICS AND ISN'T IT ALSO AN 
ATTEMPT TO CURTAIL THE FREEDOM 
OF SPEECH BY PENA LIZING THEM? 
THE PRESIDENT HAS A 
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND WHO 
HAS ACCESS TO IT. 
THAT IS WHAT HE IS DOING IS 
FULFILLING THAT RESPONSIBILITY 
IN THIS ACTION. 
THIS IS -- SPECIFIC TO MR. 
BRENNON AND THE OTHERS ARE 
UNDER REVIEW. 
>>  IS THIS THE KIND OF 
PRESIDENT WHO -- PRECEDENT WHO 
WANTS TO SET FOR FUTURE 
PRESIDENTS AND WHY ARE THERE NO 
REPUBLICANS ON THAT LIST? 
>>  ONCE AGAIN IF WE DEEMED IT 
NECESSARY WE WOULD LOOK INTO 
THAT AND HAPPY TO REVIEW THEM. 
>>  I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT 
TURKEY BUT JUST -- I GUESS -- 
THE REASON PEOPLE WOULD SAY 
THIS ARGUMENT IS STRAINING 
CREDITABILITY IS THERE ARE 
EXAMPLES EVEN FROM THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, YOUR FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
ADMITTED TO LYING TO THE FBI. 
WHY IS THIS ONLY A LIST OF 
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN 
CRITICAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION 
AND WHY SHOULD AMERICANS HAVE 
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU ARE TAKING 
THIS SERIOUSLY IF THERE IS NOT 
A SINGLE REPUBLICAN ON THAT 
LIST? 
>>  AGAIN CERTAINLY WE WOULD 
LOOK AT THOSE IF WE DEEMED IT 
NECESSARILY AND WE WILL KEEP 
YOU POSTED IF THAT LIST GETS 
UPDATED. 
>>  ON TURKEY, TURKEY ANNOUNCED 
THEY ARE GOING TO SLAP TARIFFT 
ON A BILLION DOLLARS OF 
AMERICAN GOODS, IS THERE A 
RESPONSE TO THAT AND IS THERE 
ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT 
RETALIATION ABOUT THAT AND 
CONTINUING TO ESCALATE THIS? 
>>  THE TARIFFS ARE REGRETTABLE 
AND A STEP IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION. 
THE TARIFFS THE UNITED STATES 
PUT ON TURKEY WERE OUT OF 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS. 
THEIRS ARE OUT OF RETALIATION. 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF 
ANYTHING ON WHAT WE MAY OR MAY 
NOT DO IN EFFORT TO RESPOND. 
WE -- WE DON'T SUPPORT TURKEY'S 
DECISION TO RETALIATE AGAINST 
US PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL 
SECURITY INTERESTS. 
>>  AN APPEALS COURT IN TURKEY 
DENIED THE PASTOR'S APPEAL TO 
TRY TO BE RELEASES. 
DOES THE ADMINISTRATION SEE 
THAT AS A NEW SET BACK? 
>>  WE FEEL THAT TURKEY AND 
SPECIFIC THE PRESIDENT OF 
TURKEY HAVE TREATED PASTOR 
BRUNSON WHO WE KNOW TO BE A 
VERY GOOD PERSON AND A STRONG 
CHRISTIAN WHO HAS DONE NOTHING 
WRONG, VERY UNFAIRLY, VERY 
BADLY. 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WON'T 
FORGET IN THE ADMINISTRATION.  
JAKE. 
GO HEAD. 
>>  SO, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS 
PUT UP A DEFENSE OF PASTOR 
BRUNSON BUT THERE ARE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIANS IN 
NORTH KOREA WHO HAVE BEEN IN 
PRISON BECAUSE OF THEIR 
RELIGION. 
THEY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE 
NUMBER ONE COUNTRY WHEN IT 
COMES TO PERSECUTING 
CHRISTIANSS. 
THIS SOMETHING THE 
ADMINISTRATION IS SHOOING INTO? 
>>  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY 
ANYONE PERSECUTED FOR THEIR 
BELIEFS RELEASED. 
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NORTH 
KOREA ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS. 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE THEM CHANGE THEIR 
BEHAVIOR. 
I KNOW ITS BEEN DISCUSSED AND 
AGAIN CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEIR 
BEHAVIOR CHANGE. 
I HAVE TO KEEP. 
GO HEAD. 
>>  THOUGH TERRITORY HELD HAS 
BEEN REDUCED BY OVER 90% A 
REPORT SUGGESTS THAT AS MANY AS 
30,000ISIS MEMBERS STILL EXIST. 
WHAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S 
TAKE ON THIS REPORT AND WHAT 
WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION 
INTEREST A VICTORY AGAINST 
ISIS? 
>>  WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EVERY 
SINGLE MEMBER OF ISIS DEFEATED 
ACROSS THE GLOBE. 
I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE 
ULTIMATE VICTORY. 
GO HEAD. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
CLOSING ARMS ARE TAKING PLACE 
ACROSS THE RIVER FOR THE TAX 
FRAUD TRIAL OF PAUL MANAFORT. 
IN MID-JUNE THE PRESIDENT SAID 
THAT HE FELT BADLY FOR MR. 
MANAFORT AND THAT HE BELIEVES 
HE IS BEING TREATED UNFAIRLY. 
IS THE PRESIDENT STILL FRIENDS 
WITH MANAFORT? 
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME HE SPOKE 
TO HIM? 
>>  I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY 
CONVERSATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 
HAD. 
>>  I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS MADE THAT CLEAR IN HIS 
PREVIOUS COMMENTS. 
I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
YOU JUST SAID THAT -- A COUPLE 
EVER MINUTES AGO THAT THE 
INCREASED TARIFF LEVELS WITH 
TURKEY WAS IN NATIONAL SECURITY 
INTERESTS BUT WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED IT HE SAID 
AT THE TIME OUR RELATION WAS 
TURKEY ARE NOT GOOD AT THIS 
TIME. 
THE SUGGESTION BEING THAT THIS 
HAS TO DO WITH THE PASTOR THAT 
IS BEING HELD IN TURKEY. 
IF PASTOR BRUNSON IS ALLOWED TO 
LEAVE TURKEY DO THE TARIFF 
LEVELS GO AWAY? 
>>  NO. 
THE TARIFFS THAT ARE IN PLACE 
ON STEEL WOULD NOT BE REMOVED 
WITH THE RELEASE OF PASTOR 
BRUNSON. 
THEY ARE SPECIFIC TO NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
THE SANCTIONS ARE SPECIFIC TO 
PASTOR BRUNSON AND OTHERS THAT 
WE FEEL ARE BEING HELD 
UNFAIRLY. 
WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT AT THAT 
POINT. 
>>  IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY WHAT'S CHANGED OVER 
THE LAST MONTH OR SO WITH 
TURKEY THAT YOU ARE JUSTIFYING 
NATIONAL SECURITY? 
>>  AGAIN THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THE STEEL. 
WE MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
REACH CERTAIN LEVELS OF 
MANUFACTURING OF THOSE PRODUCTS 
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 
THE PURPOSES OF NATIONAL 
SECURITY. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT TURKEY 
BUT BASED ON YOUR OPENING 
STATEMENT, I HAVE TO POINT OUT 
THAT THE ATTORNEYS FOR FORMER 
DIRECTOR COMEY AND FORMER 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR MCABB SAY THEIR 
PASSES WERE AUTOMATICALLY 
DEMAGNETIZED THE DAY THEY WERE 
SEPARATED FROM THEIR OFFICES, 
TWO OTHERS, MR. CLAPPER AND 
GENERAL HAYDEN SAID THEY DON'T 
USE THE PASS AT ALL AND ALSO 
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM A 
HISTORIC STANDPOINT THIS WOULD 
BE THE FIRST TIME THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF REMOVED THE PASSES FROM 
ANYONE THAT IS NORMALLY BEEN 
DONE BY AGENCY HEADS OR 
IMMEDIATE SUPERIORS TO PEOPLE. 
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ALL OF 
THESE THINGS IN THE PROCESS OF 
YOU SAY YOU ARE GOING THROUGH? 
>>  THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS, 
THOSE ARE BEING REVIEWED. 
THAT WILL BE MADE AT A LATER 
DATE. 
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN REVOKED IT 
WOULD BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
REVIEWING IF THEY SHOULD BE 
REINSTATED OR NOT. 
>>  YOU OUTLINED TO TWO AREAS 
OF TESTIMONY FROM BRENNON. 
IS THIS THE ONLY STANDARD BY 
WHICH THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 
SAYING HE SHOULD HAVE HIS 
SECURITY CLEARANCE REVOKED IN. 
>>  I LAID OUT THE REASONS IN 
THE OPENING STATEMENT. 
SPECIFIC TO THE DIRECTOR. 
THE OTHERS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER 
REVIEW. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS ON 
THIS. 
>>  IS THAT THE STANDARD? 
YOU -- YOU SAY SOMETHING AND 
HAVE TO CORRECT IT IN THE 
FUTURE. 
IF YOU WORK FOR THIS 
ADMINISTRATION FOR EXAMPLE, 
DOES THAT MEAN YOU COULD LOOSE 
YOUR SECURITY CLEARANCE? 
>>  THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT ON 
A CASE BY CASE BASIS WHICH IS 
WHY THEY ARE BEING REVIEWED. 
>>  IS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE 
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE OR 
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT HE HAS 
MISUSED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION 
OR MONETIZED HIS ACCESS TO IT? 
>>  I HAVE LAID OUT THE REASONS 
FOR THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE 
ON THIS. 
I WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE 
OTHER ACTIONS. 
ANDREW. 
>>  THE ABSENCE OF YOU NOT 
SAYING THOSE THINGS YOU DIDN'T 
FIND EVIDENCE OF THAT? 
>>  I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THE 
DECISION WAS BASED OFF ON. 
>>  I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT A 
QUESTION ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. 
THERE WAS ROAD SUICIDE ATTACK 
IN KABUL THAT KILLED 37 IN A 
SCHOOL. 
A MILITARY BASE IN THE NORTH 
HAS BEEN OVER RUN BUT THE 
TALIBAN. 
THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN PARTS OF 
EASTERN CAPITOL. 
WHY DO YOU THINK THE 
PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY IN 
AFGHANISTAN IS WORK SOMETHING. 
>>  AS ALWAYS WE ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND LOOK AT 
THE BEST WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD. 
I WILL LEAVE IT TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO GET 
INTO SPECIFICS ABOUT TACTICAL 
SITUATIONS. 
WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING A 
POLITICAL SITUATIN TO END THE 
CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL AVENUES 
OF DIALOGUE AND CLOSE 
COORDINATION WITH THE 
AFGHANISTAN GOVERNMENT. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. 
IF WE HAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS OR 
CHANGES WE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
>>  FOLLOW UP ON THE TURKEY 
QUESTION IF I MAY. 
ARE YOU GUYS SHALL DID HAVE YOU 
ASSESSED IF THE SITUATION IN 
TURKEY AND THEIR FINANCIAL 
SECTOR IS -- IS A RISK IN LIGHT 
OF THE FALL OF THE LIRA. 
IT'S FALLEN LIKE A QUARTER IN 
THE LAST FEW DAYS. 
>>  WE ARE MONITORING THE 
SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO THE 
TURKISH ECONOMY. 
THEIR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS -- 
THOSE ARE A PART OF A LONG TERM 
TREND. 
SOMETHING OF ITS OWN MAKING NOT 
THE RESULT OF ANY ACTIONS THE 
UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
ONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU 
LISTED ON THAT LIST, THAT OF 
CLEARANCE THAT IS UNDER REVIEW 
IS BRUCE ORR. 
HE IS A CURRENT EMPLOYEE OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
INSTEAD OF PUTTING HIM UNDER 
THE REVIEW IS THE PRESIDENT 
BELIEVE HE SHOULD BE FIRED? 
>>  I DON'T HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT FRONT. 
>>  WHY PUT A SECURITY 
CLEARANCE UNDER REVIEW AND NOT 
JUST FIRE HIM? 
>>  I DON'T HAVE ANY 
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THAT FRONT. 
WE ARE LOOKING IN THAT. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
IF PEOPLE WHO CRITICIZE THE 
PRESIDENT ON TV OR PUBLIC 
CRITICISMS ARE THEY AT GREATER 
RISK OF LOSING THEIR CLEARANCE? 
>>  THIS IS A CASE BY CASE 
BASIS AND WE WILL DO A REVIEW 
AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. 
>>  A QUESTION ABOUT THE RETURN 
OF LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL 
AND THEN -- NOW THAT THEY ARE 
BACK CAN YOU SORT OF LAY OUT 
THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY FOR 
MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS 
AGENDA. 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT WALL 
FUNDING, WE HAVE -- A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THE 
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION. 
DACA AND OTHER ISSUES. 
IS THERE A STRATEGY IN PLACE TO 
BEGIN TO WORK WITH LAWMAKERS 
NOW THAT THEY ARE BACK? 
>>  WE HAVE CONTINUED ONGOING 
CONVERSATIONS ON A NUMBER OF 
FRONTS WITH LAWMAKERS EVEN 
WHILE THEY WEREN'T HERE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
WE ARE HAPPY THAT THE HEARING 
DATES HAVE BEEN SET FOR JUSTICE 
KAVANAUGH AND WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO SEEING HIM GET CONFIRMED. 
>>  MY FOLLOW UP WAS -- FIRST 
OF ALL YOU DIDN'T MENTION 
ANYTHING ABOUT A POSSIBLE SHUT 
DOWN. 
IS THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IS CONTINUING AND 
MY FOLLOW UP IS ON THE FARM 
BILL. 
THERE IS -- A GREAT NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE AND A GREAT NUMBER OF 
STATE THAT ARE CURIOUS ABOUT 
THIS WORK REQUIREMENT. 
THE U.S.D.A.
IS TRYING TO PUT IN. 
SOMEPLACES THEY HAVE IT. 
THEY SAY HAVE YOU TO WORK AND 
OTHER AREAS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT 
REQUIREMENT. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE STILL -- SUPPORTS? 
>>  SOMETHING WE STILL SUPPORT 
IN TERMS OF A SHUT DOWN. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS 
ON THAT FRONT. 
WE STILL WANT TO SEE A LOT OF 
THINGS HAPPEN. 
WE WOULD LOVE FOR CONGRESS TO 
ACTUALLY DO ITS JOB, 
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO 
IMMIGRATION. 
WE HAVE A COMPLETELY BROKEN 
SYSTEM AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THEM WORK WITH US TO FIX IT. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  I DON'T HAVE ANY UPDATES. 
>>  OMAROSA WAS THE HIGHEST 
RANKING AFRICAN AMERICAN 
STIFFENER THE WEST WING. 
NO. 
>>  SHE DIDN'T WORK IN THE WEST 
WING BUT GO HEAD. 
>>  NO STAFFER HAS BEEN 
APPOINTED THAT LEVEL SINCE HER 
ABSENCE. 
CAN YOU TELL US HOW MANY 
AFRICAN AMERICAN STAFFERS THERE 
ARE IN THIS BUILDING AND IS IT 
A PRIORITY FOR THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO REFLECT THE 
DIVERSITY OF THE COUNTRY? 
>>  CERTAINLY. 
AS I ADDRESSED YESTERDAY WE 
VALUE DIVERSITY, NOT JUST AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE BUT THROUGHOUT 
THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TRYING 
TO DIVERSIFY THE STAFF. 
WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF 
STAFFERS, RACE, RELIGION. 
>>  HOW MANY ARE THERE? 
>>  I WON'T GO THROUGH AND DO A 
COUNT. 
I WON'T DO A SIT DOWN AND COUNT 
ON THE STAFFERS THAT ARE IN 
YOUR NEWS ORGANIZATION. 
>>  30% OF THE COUNTRY IS 
AFRICAN AMERICAN. 
>>  AND WE WOULD LOVE TO 
DIVERSIFY OUR STAFF. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN. 
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
ABOUT THE ELECTION LAST NIGHT. 
WE ARE SEEING THE DEMOCRATS 
EMBRACING A MORE DIVERSE, 
PICKING MUSLIMS, ALSO 
CANDIDATES, TRANSGENDER 
CANDIDATES, REJECTING THE 
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. 
MY QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU 
THINK WILL BE THE IMPACT OF HIS 
AGENDA AND ALSO THIS RECENT 
CONTROVERSIES ABOUT RACE AND 
MINORITIES ON THE ELECTION IN 
NOVEMBER? 
>>  AGAIN I THINK PEOPLE ARE 
LOOKING AT THE POLICIES THAT 
THE INDIVIDUALS ARE DOING AND 
HOW THEY WILL AFFECT THE 
COMMUNITIES AND WHETHER OR NOT 
IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP 
INDIVIDUALS. 
PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. 
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE FOCUSES ON 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO. 
I WILL TAKE ONE LAST QUESTION. 
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU A COUPLE 
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS. 
ONE IS ON HARLEY DAVIDSON. 
THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED EARLIER 
IN THE WEEK THAT MANY HARLEY 
DAVIDSON OWNERS PLAN TO BOYCOTT 
THE COMPANY AT MANUFACTURER 
MOVES OVERSEAS. 
GREAT. 
IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES ENDORSING A BOYCOTT OF 
AN ICONIC COMPANY HERE? 
>>  THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS 
FEELINGS ON THAT CLEAR. 
HIS FOCUS IS ON MAKING SURE 
THAT WE GET GOOD TRADE DEALS 
AND THAT WE KEEP BUSINESS AND 
INDUSTRY HERE IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
>>  DOES HE WANT TO SEE A 
BOYCOTT? 
>>  HE WOULD RATHER SEE THEM 
PUT THEIR COMPANIES BACK IN THE 
UNITED STATES AND BUILD THEIR 
GREAT MACHINES HERE IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THANK YOU. 
HAVE A GREAT DAY. 
>>  IF YOU ARE TIRED OF HEARING 
ABOUT OMAROSS AND THOSE TAPES 
THE WHITE HOUSE DISHED OUT A 
NEW HEADLINE TALKING ABOUT 
REVOKING THE SECURITY 
CLEARANCES OF FORMER CIA 
DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNON AND A 
HOST OF OTHERS WHOSE CLEARANCE 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOW UNDER 
-- UNDER INVESTIGATION LOOKING 
INTO IF THEY SHOULD REVOKE. 
MANY OF THEM -- IT'S HARD TO 
IGNORE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
WHEN ASKED WHY THERE ARE NO 
REPUBLICANS ON THE LIST THE 
WHITE HOUSE SAID THIS IS A CASE 
BY CASE BASIS. 
THY ARE LOOKING INTO AND THEY 
WILL UPDATE THE LIST AS IT 
WARRANTS. 
WHEN -- WHAT WAS THE STANDARD 
EXACTLY THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
USED TO REVOKE THE FORMER CIA 
CORRECT ARE DIRECTOR'S 
CLEARANCE? 
IT WAS ERRATIC CONDUCT AND 
BEHAVIOR. 
I WANT TO BRING IN MAJOR 
GARRET. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? 
>>  WELL. 
THIS WAS SET UP A COUPLE OF  
WEEKS AGO. 
IT STRIKES ME AS SIGNIFICANT 
THAT THE ONE PERSON NAMED FOR A 
REVOKING OF SECURITY CLEARANCE 
IS THE ONE MEMBER OF THE FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY AND -- TO 
ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF TREASON 
WHICH JOHN BRENNON DID RIGHT 
AFTER THE HELSINKI SUMMIT AND 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
IT'S WORTH NOTING A COUPLE OF 
OTHERS NAMED, ANDREW MCABB, 
JAMES COMEY HAVE ALREADY HAD 
THEIR CLEARANCES REVOKED SO 
IT'S A NONISSUE. 
JAMES CLAPPER AND MICHAEL 
HAYDEN HAVE SAID THEY DON'T 
NEED IT, DON'T WANT IT. 
THIS SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON TWO 
PEOPLE. 
ONE A FORMER MEMBER OF THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND ONE A 
CURRENT MEMBER OF THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT BRUCE ORR WHO THE 
PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN OUT AGAINST 
ON TWITTER FOR HIS ALLEGED 
INCORRECT HANDLING OF HIS 
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH IN THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RELATED TO 
THE HILLARY CLINTON E-MAIL 
INVESTIGATION AND OTHER RELATED 
MATTERS. 
SO, IF YOU SORT OF TAKE A LOOK 
AT THESE NAMES, SEPARATE THE 
WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF YOU SEE 
AROUND IT A VERY DEFINITE 
POLITICAL ANGLE AGAINST JOHN 
BRENNON AND BRUCE ORR AND THEN 
NO EXPLANATION IF SOMEBODY WHO 
IS SERVING IN THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT IS UNDER REVIEW FOR 
HAVING THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE 
REVOKED WHY AREN'T THEY UNDER A 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION AND OR 
FIRED IN NO EXPLANATION FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE ON THAT. 
IT SEEMS LESS FOCUSED TOWARD A 
SECURITY MATTER AND MORE 
REINFORCING A POLITICAL 
ARGUMENT. 
>>  WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL FLYNF 
WHO ADMITTED LYING TO THE FBI. 
WHAT ABOUT HIS CLEARANCE? 
>>  THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
-- WAS NOT DISCUSSED HERE 
TODAY. 
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS AS 
SOMEONE WHO HAS ADMITTED LYING 
TO THE FBI. 
I'M RATHER CERTAINLY THAT IT'S 
-- EITHER UNDER REVIEW OR A 
NONISSUE OR REVOKED. 
THAT IS -- SOMETHING WORTH 
POINTING OUT THAT -- THE 
HANDLING OF INFORMATION, ACCESS 
TO IT AND TRUTHFULNESS HAS BEEN 
A PROBLEM FOR THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
MICHAEL FLYNN IS WORTH NOTING 
IN ANY CONTEXT TALKING ABOUT 
SOMEONE MISS HANDING THEIR 
ACCESS. 
IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING WHEN I 
ASKED SARAH SAND AFTERS 
SPECIFICALLY DO YOU HAVE ANY 
EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST OR PROVE 
THAT JOHN BRENNON HAS MISUSED 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OR 
MONETIZED HIS USE OF CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION SHE DID NOT SAY 
THAT THERE WAS. 
SHE DIDN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY THEY 
COULDN'T FIND IT BUT SHE DIDN'T 
LAY THAT AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR 
HAVING A SECURITY CLEARANCE 
REVOKED. 
>>  ONE OF MY FAVORITE 
QUESTIONS TO YOU WHEN 
TRANSLATING TRUMP IS WHY NOW? 
>>  WHY NOW? 
IS THAT THE QUESTION? 
>>  YEAH. 
WHY NOW? 
>>  I ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME 
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. 
>>  FAIR ENOUGH. 
>>  IN THE SENSE -- OF -- YOU 
HAVE ONE ASPECT OF THIS WHICH 
IS VERY TOUGH CRITICISM OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND LOOK. 
JOHN DOES HAVE ANABLE GAZE, I 
THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE TO 
PICK HIS WORDS CAREFULLY. 
TO ACCUSE THE PRESIDENT OF 
TREASON AFTER A PRESIDENT 
CONFERENCE IS A HEAVY, HEAVY 
WEIGHT CHARGE. 
IT IS OF A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF 
INTENSITY AND VELOCITY IF YOU 
WILL. 
NOBODY ELSE HAS USED THAT SORT 
OF TERM WHO HAD A POSITION LIKE 
HIM. 
SO, THERE IS THIS ONGOING GRIPE 
THE PRESIDENT HAS WITH 
CRITICISM OF THAT KIND. 
AS FAR AS BRUCE ORR AS I SAID A 
MOMENT AGO HE WORKS IN THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN HIM 
APPLY INDICATING HIM ALONG WITH 
OTHERS HE BELIEVES HAVE MISUSED 
THEIR ROLE OR INFLUENCE WITH IN 
THE FBI AND SHOULD HAVE 
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THAT. 
TO PLACE HIS NAME ON THIS LIST 
OF REVIEWED SECURITY CLEARANCES 
SEEMS TO BE LARGELY IN THE 
ARENA OF REINFORCING THAT 
POLITICAL ARGUMENT CARRIED OUT 
BY THE PRESIDENT ON AT WHICH 
TIMER NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU 
COULD OR SHOULD HANDLE 
ADMINISTRATION WISE IF YOU 
BELIEVED SOMEONE IN A SENIOR 
POSITION AT THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE OR 
SHOULD BE INVESTIGATE FOR 
HAVING THEIR SECURITY CLEARANCE 
REVOKED. 
>>  VERY GOOD POINT. 
MAJOR GARRET. 
GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US. 
I WANT TO TURN NOW AND BRING IN 
CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL 
SECURITY ANALYST FRAN TOWNSEND. 
WHAT ARE YOU ENTITLED TO WHEN 
YOU LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
WHAT ARE YOU ABLE TO GET WHEN 
IT COMES TO TOP SECRET AND 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION? 
>>  SURE. 
THANK YOU FOR ASKING. 
WE SHOULD BE HONEST ABOUT, YOU 
KNOW A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS A 
PRIVILEGE, IT'S NOT A RIGHT 
WHEN YOU ARE IN GOVERNMENT OR 
WHEN YOU LEAVE GOVERNMENT. 
NORMALLY FOLKS AT SENIOR 
LEVELS, WHETHER IT'S THE WHITE 
HOUSE OR AGENCY HEADS MAINTAIN 
THE CLEARANCES AFTER THEY LEAVE 
IN ORDER TO ADVISE THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
SOMETIMES THE CLEARANCES 
MAINTAINED BECAUSE YOU HAVE A 
CONSULTING CONTRACT OR YOU ARE 
WORKING WITH A CLASSIFIED 
CONTRACTOR IN WASHINGTON. 
SO, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE 
DIFFERENT REASONS FOR 
MAINTAINING THEIR CLEARANCE. 
REGARDLESS OF YOUR REASONS FOR 
MAINTAINING YOUR CLEARANCE YOU 
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SAFE FEUD 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. 
IF THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT 
YOUR ABILITY TO DO THAT THERE'S 
USUALLY A PROCESS BY WHICH IT'S 
CONSIDERED WHETHER OR NOT TO 
REVOKE YOUR CLEARANCE. 
THIS -- IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT 
ANY OF THAT HAPPENED HERE. 
FRANKLY IT APPEARS FROM THE 
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY WITH WHAT 
JOHN BRENNON SAID IN PUBLIC AND 
ON TWITTER. 
JOHN HAS MADE CAUSTIC REMARKS 
AND CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE 
PRESIDENT BUT HE HAS A RIGHT TO 
HAVE AN OPINIONABLE ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT AND IS I'MS THE 
PRESIDENT IS ANGRY ABOUT THAT. 
YOU WOULD HOPE THAT HE WASN'T 
USING THE SECURITY CLEARANCE 
PROCESS TO PENALIZE ANYONE 
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THEIR 
OPINIONS. 
>>  I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
THAT APPEARANCE THAT IT SEEMS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
PENALIZED HIS CRITICS. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE WHITE 
HOUSE? 
>>  LOOK. 
I THINK THAT THE PRESS 
SECRETARY SAID SOMETHING TO THE 
EFFECT THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE 
CAUSING CHAOS WITH IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT'S 
NOT AIR VIOLATION OF HIS OATH 
IN TERMS OF KEEPING SECRETS. 
IT'S JUST -- IT'S DISTURBING. 
I THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO 
EXPLAIN HOW DID THEY DECIDE 
WHAT HE IS DOING VERSES GENERAL 
MIKE HAYDEN WHO IS ALSO A PRIOR 
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA? 
IT'S -- WHY HIM VERSES NOT 
OTHERS. 
WHAT WAS THE REASON AND IF 
THERE WAS ANY FORMAL REVIEW 
PROCESS BEFORE REVOKING HIS 
CLEARANCE. 
>>  THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IT WAS 
ERRATIC CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR 
THAT LED HIM TO THIS 
ASSESSMENT. 
THE FACT THIS REALLY -- I JUST 
DON'T REMEMBER FROM BUSH, 
CLINTON TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, 
OBAMA, EVER -- THIS IS SUCH A 
MOMENT IN NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. 
IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THE 
INTELLIGENCE AND FORMER 
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS LIKE 
YOURSELF WHO SERVED IN PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS TO PUSH BACK? 
IS THERE ANY PUSH BACK? 
>>  I DON'T THINK IT'S -- I 
DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S EVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE. 
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD 
ABOUT IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE A 
PUBLIC CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS? 
YOU KNOW ONE I THINK IT'S TO 
THE COUNTRY'S BENEFIT TO HAVE 
JOHN AND OTHERS HAVE THEIR 
CLEARANCES AND BE AVAILABLE TO 
THE ADMINISTRATION EVEN IF THEY 
DECIDE NOT TO CONSULT WITH 
FOLKS. 
THERE IS A LOT OF DATE TO DAY 
ISSUES ON WHICH SOMEONE WITH 
JOHN'S EXPERIENCE. 
LET'S REMEMBER BEFORE HE WAS A 
POLITICAL APPOINTEE IN THE 
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION JOHN WAS A 
CAREER INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. 
HE HAS DECADES OF EXPERIENCE 
THAT MAY BE USEFUL NOT JUST TO 
THE HEADS OF AGENCIES BUT TO 
HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES. 
>>  IT'S TRUE AND AS YOU SAID 
SO MANY FORMER PEOPLE CONTINUE 
TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
OTHER TOP LEVEL INTELLIGENCE 
SECRET PEOPLE IN OTHER 
COUNTRIES AND WHAT DOES THIS 
SAY TO THE CREDITABILITY AND 
THEIR PROFESSION AFTER LEAVING 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND SERVING OUR 
COUNTRIES FOR SO LONG? 
WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS HEADED AT 
THIS POINT? 
>>  THIS IS JUDGE I SAY. 
I THINK BOTH TO OUR FOREIGN 
ALLIES WHO WATCH THIS FROM AFAR 
AND WONDER WHAT THIS MEANS AS 
WELL AS THE NATIONAL -- FORMER 
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
ITS BOUND TO HAVE A CHILLING 
EFFECT. 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT OF THE 
REASONS THE WHITE HOUSE STATES 
FOR REVOKING HIS CLEARANCE. 
EVERYBODY OUT THERE WHO IS A 
FORMER OFFICIAL WITH THE 
SECURITY CLEARANCE, MYSELF 
INCLUDED HAS TO WONDER WHETHER 
OR NOT IF YOU SAY SOMETHING 
CRITICAL YOU WILL BE THE TARGET 
OF SUSPICIOUS BY THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND HAVE YOUR -- PUT YOUR 
CLEARANCE AT RISKER. 
SO, I DO -- IT'S -- IT'S SORT 
OF DISTURBING. 
WHEN YOU GET A SECURITY 
CLEARANCE YOU VOLUNTEER TO GIVE 
UP THINGS. 
I CAN'T DISCLOSE CLASSIFIED 
INFORMATION. 
I VOLUNTEER -- I VOLUNTARILY 
DID THAT FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF 
HAVING MY CLEARANCE. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT 
ENTITLED TO HAVE AN OPINION 
ABOUT POLICY ISSUES AND AS YOU 
KNOW I'M OFTEN ON GIVING 
OPINIONS ABOUT THINGS. 
IT'S SORT OF WHERE -- IN A 
COUNTRY WHERE WE PRIZE OUR 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT AND WE 
STRIKE A BALANCE IN TERMS OF 
OUR SECURITY CLEARANCE I DO 
THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL FIND 
THIS SORT OF PUNITIVE ACTION TO 
BE DISTURBING. 
>>  AND HIGHLY UNUSUAL. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
>>> THE JURY IN THE PAUL 
MANAFORT TRIAL WILL SOON START 
TO DELIBERATE. 
THE PROSECUTION HAS FINISHED 
IT'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS AND THE 
DEFENSE IS SET TO FINISH THEIRS 
TODAY. 
THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER CAMPAIGN 
CHAIRMAN COULD FACE HUNDREDS OF 
YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED. 
I WANT TO TURN NOW TO PAULA 
REID. 
SHE IS OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE. 
HOW DID THE DEFENSE HANDLE THE 
CLOSING ARGUMENTS TODAY? 
>>  IT'S INTERESTING. 
THE DEFENSE HAS TWO THEMES. 
THE FIRST IS THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO MEET 
THEIR BURDEN OF PROOF. 
THEY REMINDED THE JURY THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS TO PROVE ITS 
CASE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT 
AND THEY SAID THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HASN'T DONE THAT. 
THAT'S THE SAME THING THEY SAID 
YESTERDAY WHEN THEY DECIDED NOT 
TO PUT ON A DEFENSE OR CALL 
THEIR OWN WITNESSES. 
ONE OF MANAFORT'S ATTORNEYS 
CAME OUT AND MADE A STATEMENT 
TO THE MEDIA DESPITE A GAG 
ORDER AND SAID E
