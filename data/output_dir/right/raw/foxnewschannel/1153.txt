1
00:00:00,776 --> 00:00:01,643
COACH.

2
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:03,645
SHE HAS A 13-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

3
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:05,080
FRANCES, AND OUR THOUGHTS ARE

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,448
WITH THEM TONIGHT.

5
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:08,917
WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE STORY

6
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,652
THAT SURFACED THIS MORNING.

7
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:11,987
ALSO DEVELOPING THIS EVENING,

8
00:00:11,987 --> 00:00:13,722
TONIGHT THEY ARE CALLING IT NOW

9
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,391
I COMPETITION AND NOT A PAGEANT.

10
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,661
THAT IS THE NEW MOTTO OF THE

11
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:20,362
MISS AMERICA ORGANIZATION WHO

12
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:21,863
ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT THEY ARE

13
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,665
BANISHING THE SIGNATURE BIKINI

14
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:24,666
PORTION OF THE PAGEANT.

15
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:25,667
INSTEAD CONTESTANTS WILL NOT

16
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,236
TAKE PART IN A LIVE INTERACTIVE

17
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,271
SESSION WITH THE JUDGES AND THE

18
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:31,706
ORGANIZATION IS ALSO GETTING RID

19
00:00:31,706 --> 00:00:35,043
OF THE EVENING GOWN PORTION OF

20
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:37,579
THE COMPETITION.

21
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,084
I THINK SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SHOW

22
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:43,618
EVIDENCE

23
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,253
UP IN SWEATPANTS.

24
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,655
SHANNON BREAM, OUR GOOD FRIEND,

25
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:47,456
JOINS US TONIGHT.

26
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,524
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE WITH

27
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:52,461
TUCKER AND SHANNON AND SO MANY

28
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:53,829
OF THESE GREAT PEOPLE.

29
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,630
I KNOW YOU DID NOT WANT TO SHOW

30
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,631
ANY PICTURES OF YOU FROM THE

31
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,634
PAGEANT TONIGHT.

32
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:02,437
BUT -- >> I MIGHT HAVE FOUND

33
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,941
SOME, I DON'T KNOW.

34
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,843
>> Martha: SHANNON IS

35
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,044
GORGEOUS, IT'S VERY INTERESTING

36
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:10,645
TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THOSE.

37
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,848
I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS, WHY DO

38
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:16,251
YOU NOT WANT TO SHOW THEM?

39
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,787
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHERE

40
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:19,855
YOU ARE WITH THAT?

41
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:22,057
>> IT WAS SUCH A DIFFERENT TIME

42
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:24,459
IN MY LIFE, I'M MISS AMERICA

43
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,661
PAGEANT FOR ME WAS A GODSEND

44
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:27,395
BECAUSE I WANT SCHOLARSHIP MONEY

45
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,898
THROUGH THAT THAT PUT ME THROUGH

46
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:31,433
SCHOOL, UNDERGRAD, AND A LOT OF

47
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,534
MY LAW SCHOOL AS WELL.

48
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,203
I DIDN'T COME FROM A FAMILY THAT

49
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:38,173
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY OR MEANS.

50
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:40,375
FOR ME THIS WAS A VERY FUN WAY

51
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,043
TO STRETCH MYSELF.

52
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:42,777
IT WAS TERRIFYING AT TIMES BUT

53
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,646
IT PAY FOR SCHOOL FOR ME AND IT

54
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,048
WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE FOR ME.

55
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,784
I'M NOT SURE ANYONE WANTS TO SEE

56
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:50,519
MY SWIMSUIT PICTURES NOW.

57
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,320
>> Martha: I WAS FROM

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,021
NEW JERSEY WHERE PAGEANTS

59
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,456
WEREN'T THAT VAGUE BUT TO WIN

60
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:55,891
THIS FLORIDA AND MISS VIRGINIA,

61
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:58,460
WHERE ARE ALL THESE GORGEOUS

62
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,429
GIRLS IN FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA,

63
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,064
YOU DID REALLY, REALLY WELL.

64
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:05,667
BUT I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF, ARE WE

65
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,502
PASSED THIS WHOLE THING AS A

66
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:07,836
SOCIETY?

67
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,871
AS WOMEN, IS THERE ANOTHER WAY

68
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,640
TO HAVE A GOOD SCHOLARSHIP

69
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:25,654
CONTEST IN THIS COUNTRY

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,561
SHOULD BE, THEY ARE GORGEOUS,

71
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,262
JUST LIKE THE BACHELOR AND ALL

72
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:07,729
THE OTHER STUFF.

73
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,463
IF THERE IS MERIT IN BEAUTY AND

74
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,164
THAT IS A SPECIAL ATTRIBUTE AS

75
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:09,464
WELL.

76
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:10,165
>> IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU

77
00:03:10,165 --> 00:03:10,865
KNOW MISS AMERICA STARTED OUT

78
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:11,533
YEARS AGO IN THE 20s ON THE

79
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,133
BOARDWALK IN NEW JERSEY.

80
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:12,767
IN ATLANTIC CITY, IT WAS A

81
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:13,501
SWIMSUIT CONTEST AT THE CHAMBER

82
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:14,202
OF COMMERCE AND LOCAL BUSINESS

83
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:14,869
PEOPLE CAME UP WITH TO KEEP

84
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:15,604
PEOPLE IN TOWN AROUND LABOR DAY.

85
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:16,304
IT EVOLVED OVER TIME, SO IT'S

86
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:16,938
NOT JUST ABOUT SWIMSUITS.

87
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:17,672
THEY ADDED TALENT AND INTERVIEW

88
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:18,340
AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS.

89
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,940
SWIMSUIT IS STILL A TINY

90
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,608
PORTION, AND IT'S GOING AWAY

91
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:20,275
COMPLETELY BUT, I DON'T KNOW

92
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:21,009
THAT IT EVER REALLY DECIDED THE

93
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:21,343
WINNER.

94
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:22,077
IF THEY THINK IT'S A BETTER IDEA

95
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:22,777
TO SAY, WE WANT PEOPLE OF ALL

96
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:23,511
DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES, AND

97
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:24,112
PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

98
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:24,846
INTERESTED BEFORE, I THINK IT'S

99
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:25,247
INTERESTING.

100
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:25,981
AND I'M ALL ABOUT TAKING CARE OF

101
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:26,681
MYSELF, CLEANING UP MY COLLEGE

102
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:27,249
DIET AND WORKING OUT.

103
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:27,983
IT WAS GRUELING BECAUSE I WAS ON

104
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:28,550
THE ROAD ALL THE TIME.

105
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,617
>> I

106
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:31,653
BLUE DRESS.

107
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:32,621
>> Martha: EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE

108
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,623
THEY WERE DECADES OLDER THAN

109
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,826
THEY ACTUALLY WERE.

110
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:41,796
I THINK YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

111
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:44,065
NOW, FOR FORMER HOUSTON TEXAN

112
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:46,434
CHEERLEADERS ARE DELIVERING

113
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,871
DEMANDS DIRECTLY TO NFL

114
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:50,538
COMMISSIONER ROGER CADDELL.

115
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:51,039
WATCH THIS.

116
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,874
>> WE HOPE THAT BY DELIVERING

117
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,843
THIS LETTER TO ROGER CADDELL

118
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,278
TODAY THAT HE TAKES US

119
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,445
SERIOUSLY, AND UNDERSTANDS THAT

120
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:01,283
WE JUST WANT TO BE RESPECTED AND

121
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:01,850
TREATED FAIRLY.

122
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,617
AND COMPENSATED PROPERLY FOR THE

123
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:06,054
WORK THAT WE DO.

124
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,656
>> THEY WERE ALL SOMEONE'S

125
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:08,023
DAUGHTER.

126
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,624
THEY WORK HARD AND THEY CARE.

127
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,427
THEY LOVE THE NFL.

128
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,429
LET'S SEE SOME LOVE COMING BACK

129
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:20,035
TO THEM IN TERMS OF WORKING

130
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:20,435
CONDITIONS.

131
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,638
>> Martha: YOU'VE GOT TO LOVE

132
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,041
GLORIA ALLRED.

133
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,442
BUT AGAIN, SHOULD THIS BE

134
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,045
SOMETHING THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE

135
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:30,445
ASPIRING TO?

136
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:34,382
>> ALSO IN MY PAST I WAS A LABOR

137
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:36,451
AND EMPLOYMENT LAWYER.

138
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:37,552
YES THE PLAYERS ARE MAKING

139
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:38,320
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR BUT

140
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,323
THEY ARE ALSO BRINGING IN

141
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,223
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR.

142
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:43,958
SO IF THESE WOMEN ARE ALLEGING

143
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,527
THAT THEY WERE PAID MINIMUM WAGE

144
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:46,461
AT TIMES AND THEN THEY WERE

145
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:47,195
ASKED TO    TO GO TO APPEARANCES

146
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:47,228
ASKED TO    TO GO TO APPEARANCET

147
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:47,262
ASKED TO    TO GO TO APPEARANCEA

148
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:47,495
ASKED TO    TO GO TO APPEARANCET

149
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,030
THEY NEVER GOT PAID FOR ABOUT

150
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,966
THE TEAMS GOT PAID FOR TO HAVE

151
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:52,834
THEM THERE, THOSE ARE SOME

152
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,668
INTERESTING QUESTIONS.

153
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,870
YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE WHAT

154
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,439
AN NFL PLAYER CAN MAKE, AND YOU

155
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,740
SHOULDN'T MAKE WORK NEAR WHAT

156
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,107
THEY MAKE.

157
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:01,076
BUT IF THEY ARE NOT BEING PAID

158
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,178
FOR THE HOURS THEY WORKED, THAT

159
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,847
DOES CONCERN ME.

160
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,048
>> Martha: THEY ARE BEING

161
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:10,819
TOLD, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO

162
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,455
IT, SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.

163
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:17,025
SO I GET WHERE THEY ARE COMING

164
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,593
FROM.

165
00:05:18,593 --> 00:05:19,861
SHANNON, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

166
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,763
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL GOING ON, EVEN

167
00:05:21,763 --> 00:00:00,000
IF YOU DIDN'T WIN THOSE
