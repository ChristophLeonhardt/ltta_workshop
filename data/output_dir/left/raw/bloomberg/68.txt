00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,240
The design of this logo began in Seattle in
1971.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,620
With three university friends who really liked coffee.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,100
They also really liked the Herman Melville
novel Moby Dick.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,080
So much so, they decided to name their company after Captain Ahab’s ship.

5
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:27,419
But branding exec Terry Heckler decided Pequod coffee didn’t sound quite right.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,180
So they went with the name of the first-mate:
Starbuck.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,620
Heckler then trawled through maritime books and found a 15th century woodcut of a two-tailed siren.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Instead of luring sailors onto the rocks, this mythical mermaid would call people to come

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,899
and grab a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,270
Initially her chest was bare, but after some complaints Heckler redrew the design with

11
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,720
long hair that covered her body.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,980
The logo also went from brown to green, a symbol of freshness and growth.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,480
In 2011, the Starbucks siren was redesigned with rounder details, a longer shadow was

14
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,840
also introduced on the right side of her nose.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,860
A small element of asymmetry which made her feel more human.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,240
She can be spotted in 76 countries and
markets,

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,220
helping Starbucks to reach a brand value of more than 8.7 billion dollars.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Bold and alluring this is the design that
started with a myth and became a coffee legend.
