Deal or No Deal is crunch time for brexit the UK's departure from the European Union warnings of dire economic consequences if no deal is reached Prime Minister to resume arguing her exit plan is the best so is a deal possible this is inside story hello and welcome to the program a Mossad abdel hamid brexit has been at the forefront of british politics since the country voted in a referendum for a divorce from the EU in June 2016 it's crunch time for Prime Minister Theresa May she's travelling to Salzburg this week to try to reach a breakthrough with EU leaders but many have already pushed back her checkers plan Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier is saying it would spell the end of the EU project and just six months ahead of the deadline for a brexit the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde has given a stark warning leaving the EU with no deal could be costly for the British economy let me be clear compared with today's smooth single market all the likely brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy and to a lesser extent as well for the EU the larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship the costlier it will be the range of issues that remains to be addressed is daunting as is daunting the small time left to address them in July Theresa May presented her planned named after the Prime Minister's country retreat checkers and she said more than once it's the only deal she's willing to put forward but divorce can be messy and there are many sticking points including how much the UK is willing to pay to the EU there are estimates the bill for divorce could be more than 50 billion dollars what happens to UK citizens living in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK the plan allows for freedom of trade but not for people and what happens to the Northern Ireland border this remains a major stumbling block the EU has called for a border in the Irish Sea the UK for a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland it's important that we deliver for the people of Northern Ireland they don't want a hard border between Northern Ireland our the only proposal that's been put forward that delivers on them not having that hard border and ensures that we don't carve up the United Kingdom is the checkers plan so let's bring in our guests joining us in Warsaw Luther Norton least deputy director of the think-tank British influence in Oxford Helen Thomas CEO and founder of micro economic consultancy blonde money and in Lancaster Geron John's and economists at Lancaster University a warm welcome to all of you Helen let me start with you basically Theresa May is saying it's my way or the highway that's right she has been abbreviated as yes my Deal or No Deal and I think that she's right to pitch it like that not least because we're running out of time and you know there is a deal getting to be on the table we have to see what Parliament makes of that and then when there's not much time left until the actual deadline next year of course and Jonathan I mean in a certain way the EU is saying more or less the same thing even though not in those words that it's either they get what they want or there's no deal either that's right it's really a contest of read a lot of things and the EU are saying that the single market can't be divided between the Four Freedoms and that there has to be a possibility of the customs union in Northern Ireland and saying that they can't be in customs union and it can't have removed a people and there can't be a border in the Irish Sea so if you have two sides that both have their red lines one of them's going to have to give and the point is the EU is more powerful than the UK and for the last two years the UK's been moving out to the EU side in the negotiations and so that looks to be the trend now well Garrett you know we're six months away from the deadline and nothing has had extensive has happened so far do you think that Theresa May we'll be able to push her shuckers plan even within her own constituency I mean she's facing a lot of opposition it took the UK government a long time to settle on an approach to the brexit negotiations and when checkers came out a couple of months ago that was very late in the process what it has proposed in checkers is a very clunky system where countries collect border taxes on behalf of each other and where there is also a common rulebook across the UK and the European Union for the case of goods specifically now whether that breach is red lines on the EU's part in terms of splitting up the the pillars of the single market remains to be seen there's certainly something there in checkers that there is room for negotiation but we'll need to see how far each of the parties is willing to go well Jonathan talking about the fundamentals of the EU I think the problem one of the main problems here is being that if you can have a free movement of goods but you can't have free movement of people absolutely the single market is as far as the EU is concerned it comes as a package and the EU Estates is cohesion on this very point so where Michele Barney H says that 80% of the withdrawal agreement is wrapped up but it's a bit like saying that we share sort of 90% of our DNA of the fruit fly it's the remaining 10 or 20% there's the clincher and so if you if you came cysts on its checkers plan that doesn't include free movement people the EU cannot accept it and Theresa May has boxed herself into a corner because she's insisted that there can be no free move to people but if she continues to that line that can be no checkers either ok well Alan the IMF has been quite consistent relief from before the brexit vote warning I about the negative impact it could have on the UK now Christine Lagarde is painting even bleaker picture if there is no deal so what does the resume do at this point well it's all very well to talk about the economics of the argument but really it's all about the politics that is what the deal is going to succeed or fail upon is whether and you mentioned it earlier you know Teresa making convinced her own Parliament of the merits of the checkers plan let alone in its negotiations with the EU and as far as Christine Lagarde is concerned I noticed in that comment you ran at the beginning of your report she did say that although it would be bad for the UK it would also be bad for the EU and again there is a politics versus economics that goes on as a calculation on the EU side as well so I think we can't purely look at this in just GDP or unemployment terms although clearly that will be significant if we don't get a deal but but really if we're looking at what's going to happen and how it's going to pan out we really have to look at the politics of this ok and garen in your opinion will it have a negative impact or is there difference between Deal or No Deal when it comes to the British economy there's a huge difference between deal and no deal and if it's a deal it depends on what the nature of that deal will be checkers is certainly an improvement on No Deal but it leaves services outside the single market of the European Union and that will make it difficult for services to trade within the European Union in the case of No Deal the big problem there is that the EU will be obliged under WTO rules to impose tariffs on what it imports from the UK and that will make British producers very uncompetitive as they try and export their products to the European Union and that threatens employment it threatens jobs it threatens pay it threatens GDP growth in the UK and so no deal would be a very bad solution indeed for the UK also it would be a bad solution for the European Union ok and Jonathan you think actually that no deal is not an option right No Deal is absolutely impossible for very clear reasons as panelists of salus it's the disastrous outcome for both the UK and the EU but the UK has a lot more to lose than the EU because this economy is much more exposed it's smaller it's less powerful and course the the UK depends on EU infrastructure to ensure the basic running of our country like aviation for example so planes will be grounded according to the European Aviation Safety Agency if we fall out with No Deal so if negotiations collapse in December for example then the economy would start to collapse very soon afterwards and public support if there was any would vanish very quickly and so Theresa May would have to then go to Brussels and ask for a deal on what she considers to be very very poor turns so really breaks it is a process of elimination we know that can we know we know that there will be not there won't be a No Deal scenario rather so that means there will have to be a deal and from then it's just a question of deciding which dealing will be okay so Alan when if there is a deal one does get the impression that really especially we're looking through the details of this checkers plan that Teresa may basically wants an a la carte menu where she can pick and choose what what kind of relations are in which fields she will continue having deals with the EU and in which which other fields there will be the British Britain will go on its own it's quite difficult isn't it to achieve that well she's obviously in a very difficult situation I mean this is the problem of having a minority government it's also the problem because although 52% of the UK population voted to leave more than half of the parliamentarians in the UK's Parliament voted to remain in fact a significant number more than half voted to remain so there is there is a friction there that has always dogged these negotiations and unfortunately was made a lot worse by that election last year where she was of course gunning for a big man day and unfortunately got the exact opposite of that so in terms of picking and choosing I mean yes there's often a lot of criticism around what the UK is putting forward in terms of you know having cake and eating it but of course in any negotiation as any of us would have gone through you do have to put certain things forward knowing you might get pulled back from what it is that you really want so I I think it's tough to criticize her checkers plan necessarily on cherry picking because a line had to be drawn somewhere and she had to draw it based on the fact that her party is fundamentally split and of course the nation is fundamentally split and that in necessitated trying to draw these red lines and and sort of compromise into a least worst outcome and that means that you know we are left in quite a tricky situation with the clock ticking that there's basically a raft of poor options left and it is a question of just how bad is is the final outcome going to be well you know one wonders when the British people went to vote in 2016 where they given where all the facts put forward and it's the brexit they voted for back then this same as the one that has discussed today in Brussels no in 2016 people were given the option to remain in the European Union and it's pretty clear what that meant or to leave and it was very unclear what that meant and there's been a whole menu of choices from the day after the referendum it's been clear that we've had several choices to choose between when determining how we're going to leave the European Union and what's become increasingly clear is that people didn't know what they were voting for and that some people now are regretting having voted the way they voted whichever way that was they wish they knew more at the time and that is really what's driving the movement towards the people's vote on the terms of brexit that is gaining momentum Helen you have grexit supporter do you agree with what Garin just said I don't regret my personal vote and I should add that of course that's just my personal opinion and the work we do at my consultancy strives to be as independent and neutral about this as possible and I would point to the fact that some recent surveys have shown that there has been regrets on both sides and there's been regrets from people who voted to remain and from those who voted to leave it is a thorny issue the details are more complex than of course a simple remain leave question forced upon us that is the nature of referendums that's what they do and I would just say this about this concept about people knowing what they were voting for when we come to a general election there are there is a platform perhaps on health service on should we have a National Health Service what should it do and the public will vote in that election based on their views about that or on their values perhaps not even the specifics and they vote a mandate to the politicians who then go on to implement it as they see best that is what members of parliament as opposed to do so I do take a little bit of concern about this concept that we didn't know what we were voting for because that's not really how votes actually usually tend to work if you even look at the Scotland independence referendum yes there was an awful lot more detail ahead of that referendum perhaps than this one but it was a question of identity and beliefs and values and the detail and the policy well that's what the politicians are there to implement well Jonathan you seem not to agree with that has just been said but but just I have a question for you I mean this being part of the EU or not has been an issue within the Conservative Party one could argue for decades and it came just all to the forefront now but it's quite ironic that as it comes to the forefront the Conservative Party is having an internal debate about it and it's very difficult to understand at this stage if the pro Europe or the anti Europe voices within that party are the stronger these days absolutely I mean it's ironic that we are talking about what people were voting for because the concerted part aren't even agreed to use after at random and the government is still divided over it as well so in the Conservative Party I would say there is a broad consensus to leave but without any clear idea of how to do that and that's where we again come to people's fate because there's no majority it seems in in Parliament for the checkers deal there's no majority for No Deal I don't know if there's a majority the soft rectus a black or soft brexit is despised by levers and domain us because it gives you integration and also makes us a lobbyist and vassal state unable to vote on the rules which will determine our economic future and so it could be that people's vote becomes Teresa mais own way out because she might reason that if she can't get anything through Parliament then putting it back the people is the right course of action and I would also just say to Helen Helen makes a comparison with the general election in a general election you get a chance to review your decision officer four or five years that wasn't the case of this referendum so if people find that they were deceived or that they're not guessing what they voted for it's only right they should be able to think again and Helen just briefly do you agree with the idea of a second referendum no I don't I think even with the people's vote although I have sympathy with the analysis that Jonathan used there if the people say no then where are we left we've got even less time and an even more divided Parliament and recriminations possibly a change of prime minister certainly leadership would be even more in question than it is now and it just seems to lead to more confusion and I would say there's been a number of polls which suggest that in quite a British way that people just want them to get on with it and something and I think after two and a half years if we haven't got anywhere to go back to the people is going to be a difficult pill for the public to swallow okay no guarantee we're in a situation where Christine Lagarde is warning about dire economic consequences for the UK the EU is not very happy and Theresa May is in a very difficult position but do you think that all of this has also to do with the fact that at the beginning Theresa May was never a brexit here she voted against it so maybe it's very difficult for her to bring that file forward to push it ahead because I mean the UK has basically been peddling peddling in the same position for the past two years I don't think we can say that this difficulty that we're in her results from Teresa may being a remainer she was always a lukewarm remain at best I think what has happened is that the whole process has hit against the buffers of reality and there are certain aspects of brexit that are very difficult to deliver whoever tries to deliver them remember that the european research group last year pulled a document that they were considering publishing making their own proposals about how to achieve brexit they don't know how to do it either so I don't think it matters who was in charge this was always going to be an extremely difficult process what's very also difficult to understand or surprising I would say rather is that we are in a world where you have these huge blocks no China's economy is growing Russia is making economic deals everywhere the US is being more isolationist and then you have the EU and then you have the UK who wants to go on its own maybe thinking that it will keep that special relation it's always had with Washington that's not very clear at the moment considering the sort of trumps isolationist or protectionist policy so is it really was it the right time for this referendum to happen and for brexit to go ahead what is the worst timing ever now when we look at what's happening in the world as he as he point out if you see what's happening with Trump we are being divided with being isolated and far west and far east as well so Trump is saying that he is going to always put America first this about what America needs and the UK will have no option but to pursue a trade deal with the u.s. surprise to them some of the damage and from brexit but a trump can that will mate almost any demands each uses and Britain will have to comply so that doesn't give us any kind of power doesn't give us any kind of sovereignty either and so really yes as you say this is a total time to see but there will always be a terrible time see bracelet anyway there's a particularly terrible time stirring now because we are very short of allies at the moment and we're very short of options so you know it's not clear whether they'll be Deal or No Deal and even in this conversation we can't reach a consensus but if there is no deal at the end of the day overnight the UK would have lost many trade agreements around the world it would have lost also many access to many European institutions and from what I read and here it's not really ready for that well the UK government trying to be ready you know they have published a huge slew of technical papers over what would happen in no deal and you know Teresa Mays tried to respond to that of course Mark Carney Bank of England governor was in talking to the cabinet about the stress test scenario of a decline in house prices of 1/3 and this kind of thing so you know the preparations are trying to be made I believe it's the same case over you know in the eu-27 as well I think you know it's tricky of course it's certainly not going to be easy to just crash out and be on WTO terms there is the non-tariff barriers as well you know above and beyond purely the the numbers of tariffs but again I do come back to the politics of this and grounding planes unilaterally doesn't help either side of the UK or the EU I mean it would really depend on how the eu-27 want to push things and you know the eu-27 have their own debates that are because we're reaching the end of the program right now syriza may is heading to Salzburg in a few days she's gonna have she's gonna meet with EU leaders and informal kind of summit how will she be able to convince them that it's her way or her Deal or No Deal it'll be quite difficult for her to make sure that she doesn't drift too far in the direction of going for a customs union plus single market solution which would be unacceptable to a large part of her party so that's what she's gonna need to ensure at the same time she will need to persuade the European partners that it is possible to implement certain aspects of the checkers plan that are currently appeared to be very clunky so ensuring that countries can collect taxes at the border for each other and ensuring that the proposals that she's come up with don't breach the principles of the single market that Jonathan was talking about earlier but there's very little time for her to convince them of that the march deadline is fast approaching and time is running out but and also time has run out on this show so thank you to all my guest Jonathan Liz Helen Thomas and Garen Jones and thank you too for watching
