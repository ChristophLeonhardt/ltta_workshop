USA! 
USA! USA! 
USA! 
>> HELLO, FLORIDA, HELLO. 
 
>> INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
I AM THRILLED TO BE IN THIS 
GREAT STATE WHERE WE, BY THE 
WAY, HAD A GREAT VICTORY. 
 
>> WITH THOUSANDS OF HARD 
WORKING AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO 
LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND RESPECT 
OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. 
 
>> WE'RE HONORED TO BE JOINED 
TONIGHT BY SOME TREMENDOUS 
PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN GUS 
BILIRAKIS, AND TED GATES. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU, FELLOWS. 
I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE STATE 
REPRESENTATIVE JOSE OLIVA AND 
REPRESENTATIVE JOE GRUDERS FROM 
MY CAMPAIGN. 
THANK YOU, JOE. 
AND FINALLY -- I LOVE YOU, TOO. 
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE A TRUE 
LEADER, A PROUD VETERAN, MY 
GREAT FRIEND, A TOUGH, 
BRILLIANT COOKIE, TRUE. 
HE'S TOUGH. 
HE'S SMART AND HE LOVES FLORIDA 
AND HE LOVES OUR COUNTRY AND 
HE'S GOING TO BE YOUR NEXT 
GOVERNOR, RON DESANTOS. 
. -- DESANTIS. 
>> WELCOME TO FLORIDA, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
FOR SOMEONE WHO GREW UP JUST 
ACROSS THE BAY IN PINELLAS 
COUNTY STARTING OUT WORKING FOR 
SIX BUCKS AN HOUR, IT'S A TRUE 
HONOR TO BE STANDING HEREN 
DORISED BY THE -- HERE ENDORSED 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT, MR. 
PRESIDENT, BUT I APPRECIATE 
MORE THE LEADERSHIP YOU'RE 
SHOWING FOR OUR GREAT COUNTRY. 
 
>> WE HAVE THE STRONGEST 
ECONOMY WE'VE HAD IN YEARS. 
WE ARE STANDING FOUR SQUARE 
BEHIND OUR ALLY, THE STATE OF 
ISRAEL. 
WE HAVE STRONG 
CONSTITUTIONALISTS BEING PUT ON 
OUR COURTS INCLUDING THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
 
>> WE HAVE ENDED THE DISASTROUS 
IRAN ZEAL. 
 
>> AND UNDER THE PRESIDENT'S 
LEADERSHIP WE ARE STANDING 
AGAINST SOCIALIST DICTATORSHIPS 
IN LATIN AMERICA LIKE CUBA AND 
VENEZUELA AND NICARAGUA. 
FLORIDA IS GOING IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION AND WE NEED TO 
CONTINUE OUR SUCCESS AND BUILD 
UPON IT. 
WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE DAYS OF 
CHARLIE CHRIS WHERE THE GOOD 
OLD BOYS RUN THE SHOW. 
 
>> -- CHARLIE CRIST WHERE THE 
GOOD OLD BOYS RUN THE SHOW. 
WE CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITIES IF WE 
CONTINUE WITH STRONG POLICIES. 
WE CAN FIGHT ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRATION. 
>> ALL WE GOT TO DO IS ENACT E 
VERIFY AND STOP SANCTUARY 
CITIES. 
 
>> WE CAN END JUDICIAL ACTIVISM 
IN FLORIDA BY APPOINTING SOLID 
CONSTITUTIONALISTS TO OUR STATE 
COURTS JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT 
HAS DONE TO THE FEDERAL COURTS. 
 
>> AND WE CAN IMPROVE OUR 
EDUCATION SYSTEM BY STOPPING 
COMMON CORE. 
>>  
>> BY GIVING EVERY CHILD 
REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCE THE 
ABILITY TO ATTEND A GOOD SCHOOL 
AND BY GETTING THE CONSTITUTION 
BACK IN OUR CLASSROOMS IN A 
VERY BIG WAY. 
 
>> SO, MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU 
FOR YOUR SUPPORT. 
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING 
FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 
I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE IN THE 
AUGUST PRIMARY, AUGUST 28th. 
I'D BE HONORED TO HAVE IT. 
THANK YOU, GUYS, AND GOD BLESS 
AMERICA! 
THANK YOU. 
 
 
>> THANK YOU, RON, AND 
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SUPPORT RON 
DESANTIS IN OUR AUGUST 28th 
PRIMARY AND IN THE NOVEMBER 
GENERAL ELECTION DON'T FORGET 
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY. 
ONE OF THE GROUP IS GOING TO BE 
RUNNING ON OPEN BORDERS, ANTI-
I.C.E., ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
 
. 
>> OH, THAT'S TOO BAD. 
THAT'S TOO BAD. 
THAT'S TOO BAD. 
ONE PERSON, ONE PERSON AND 
TOMORROW THE HEADLINES WILL BE 
MASSIVE PROTESTS. 
TOO BAD. 
SORRY ABOUT THAT, RON. 
EARLIER TODAY I ALSO SPENT TIME 
WITH YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR, ONE 
OF OUR NATION'S TRULY GREAT 
LEADERS, RICK SCOTT. 
 
>> AS YOU KNOW, RICK IS RUNNING 
TO REPLACE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT 
SCHUMER CONTROLLED NANCY PELOSI 
CONTROLLED AND THE NEW STAR OF 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, MAXINE 
WATERS. 
 
>> THE NAME IS BILL NELSON AND 
YOU KNOW I LIVE A LOT OF TIME 
IN FLORIDA. 
THE ONLY TIME I SEE BILL NELSON 
IS FIVE MONTHS BEFORE EVERY 
ELECTION. 
AFTER A WHILE YOU FORGET WHO IS 
THE SENATOR, BUT AROUND FIVE 
MONTHS YOU SEE HIM AT PARTIES 
AND YOU SEE HIM AROUND AND WE 
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WE 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT RICK 
SCOTT WINS AND WINS BIG. 
 
>> BILL NELSON VOTED FOR 
OBAMACARE, WHICH HAS BEEN A 
TOTALLY DISASTROUS SITUATIO, 
AND WE GOT RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR ASPECT AND MOST OF 
OBAMACARE WILL BE GONE VERY 
SOON. 
IN FACT, IT WAS GONE UNTIL ONE 
GENTLEMAN DECIDED AT 2:00 IN 
THE MORNING. 
REMEMBER? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
AND HE VOTED AGAINST TAX CUTS 
AND HE WANTS TO GO IN THERE AND 
RAISE YOUR TAXES. 
TELL ME, IS THAT GOOD POLITICS? 
>> NO! 
>> I DON'T THINK SO. 
BILL NELSON VOTED IN FAVOR OF 
SANCTUARY CITIES. 
HE OPPOSED KATE'S LAW. 
BILL NELSON PUTS CRIMINAL 
ALIENS BEFORE AMERICAN 
CITIZENS, WHICH IS WHY IT'S 
TIME TO VOTE BILL NELSON OUT OF 
OFFICE. 
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 
 
>> AND WE HAVE TWO UNBELIEVABLE 
PEOPLE, RON DESANTI, RICK 
SCOTT, FIGHTING FOR FLORIDA. 
THEY ALWAYS WILL AND FIGHTING 
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
 
>> SO I'M SURE WE ALL SAY THIS 
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN, BUT I HAVE 
GREAT CHILDREN AND A COUPLE OF 
THEM PLUS ARE HERE TONIGHT. 
I HAVE ERIC TRUMP WHO HAS BEEN 
FANTASTIC. 
HE LOVES HIS POLITICAL STUFF. 
 
>> ERIC'S WIFE, I THINK SHE 
SINGLEHANDEDLY WON THE STATE OF 
NORTH CAROLINA FOR TRUMP. 
THANK YOU, LARA. 
DIDN'T HURT IN PENNSYLVANIA 
EITHER. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE HAVE SOMEBODY THAT NOBODY 
EVER HEARD OF, IVANKA. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A BIG 
THING HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU 
KNOW -- LOOK AT ALL THOSE HATS, 
WHITE ONES, RED ONES. 
THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME THING, 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT. 
WELL, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT IN ABOUT -- I 
DON'T KNOW -- I GUESS WE COULD 
DO IT NOW, BUT LET'S WAIT 
ANOTHER YEAR. 
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW, 
FRANKLY. 
WE'RE DOING FANTASTICALLY WELL. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK DAVID 
BOSSIE FOR BEING HERE, COREY 
LEWANDOWSKI FOR BEING HERE, TWO 
OF OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS. 
THEY ARE TWO FIGHTERS. 
WE LIKE FIGHTERS, DON'T WE? 
WE STARTED OFF. 
IT WAS A SMALL GROUP. 
THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. 
IT WAS ACTUALLY DONE QUITE 
EASILY. 
WE WON QUITE HANDILY. 
WE WERE NEVER OFF CENTER STAGE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, 
RIGHT, THE DEBATES. 
WE NEVER LEFT CENTER STAGE AND 
I SAID I ALWAYS WANT ODD 
NUMBERS BECAUSE I WANT TO BE IN 
THE CENTER. 
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TIED FOR 
THE CENTER. 
DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND? 
BUT WE NEVER LEFT CENTER STAGE 
AND I'LL TELL YOU, COREY, 
DAVID, IVANKA, DON, JR., ALL OF 
THEM, THEY WERE FANTASTIC. 
THEY WERE FANTASTIC. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY OUR FIRST 
LADY IS HOME WATCHING. 
LOOK AT ALL THOSE CAMERAS RIGHT 
THERE. 
SHE'S HOME WATCHING. 
AND EVERYBODY LOVES MELANIA. 
THEY LOVE MELANIA. 
 
>> SHE'S DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 
JUST LAST WEEK IT WAS ANNOUNCED 
THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT 
4.1% LAST QUARTER. 
 
>> IT WAS A NUMBER THAT 
EVERYBODY SAID WAS NOT 
REACHABLE AND I WOULD NEVER 
WANT TO SAY IT DURING THE 
CAMPAIGN EVEN THOUGH I BELIEVED 
IT. 
I BELIEVED IT BECAUSE THEY 
WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN US THE 
BREAK. 
FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS. 
 
>> THEY ARE FAKE. 
DO YOU BELIEVE -- LOOK AT THIS. 
EVERY NIGHT IT'S THE SAME 
THING.  
WOULDN'T YOU THINK THEY'D GET 
TIRED OF THESE SPEECHES? 
WOULDN'T YOU THINK? 
HERE'S ONE THING I'LL TELL YOU. 
IF THEY DON'T GET RATINGS, 
THOSE SPEECHES DON'T GO ON, 
DOESN'T MATTER. 
LOOK HOW MANY THEY HAVE BACK 
THERE. 
THEY JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH. 
THEY CAN'T GET ENOUGH. 
THEY CANNOT GET ENOUGH AND BY 
THE WAY, OUTSIDE IF YOU WANT TO 
GO, WE SET UP FOR THE FIRST 
TIME A TREMENDOUS MOVIE SCREEN 
BECAUSE WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE 
THAT COULDN'T GET IN. 
SO WE HAVE A BIG SCREEN AND BIG 
LOUD SPEAKERS AND I HOPE YOU'RE 
ALL HAPPY OUT THERE. 
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO BE IF 
YOU'VE GOT TO BE OUTSIDE. 
BE OUTSIDE IN THE GREAT STATE 
OF FLORIDA, RIGHT? 
SO WE'RE SETTING RECORDS LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE. 
SINCE THE ELECTION WE HAVE  
ADDED3.7 MILLION NEW JOBS. 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED 
IT. 
WE'RE IN THE LONGEST POSITIVE 
JOB GROWTH STREAK IN HISTORY. 
THINK OF THAT. 
REMEMBER I SAID WHAT DO YOU 
HAVE TO LOSE? 
RIGHT? 
OKAY? 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
AND PEOPLE SAID I DON'T KNOW. 
IS THAT A NICE THING? 
NO, IT'S NOT NICE OR NOT 
UNNICE. 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN 
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS REACHED 
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN HISTORY. 
 THANK 
YOU. 
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. 
THANK YOU. 
BLACKS FOR TRUMP. 
THEY SAY BLACKS FOR TRUMP. 
 YOU 
KNEW A LONG TIME AGO, DIDN'T 
YOU? 
YOU KNEW A LONG TIME AGO. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU. 
THE HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
HISTORY, HISPANIC. 
 
>> THE ASIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
HISTORY. 
 
>> SORRY ABOUT THIS, WOMEN, BUT 
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS 
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 
ONLY 65 YEARS. 
IT WILL BE HISTORY SOON. 
 
>> IT WILL BE. 
IT WILL BE HISTORY SOON. 
GIVE US ABOUT TWO MORE WEEKS. 
 
>> THE VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT 
RATE, OH, DO WE LOVE OUR 
VETERANS, RIGHT? 
 
>> HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL 
IN 18 YEARS. 
MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION AMERICANS 
HAVE BEEN LIFTED OFF FOOD 
STAMPS SINCE THE ELECTION. 
 
>> AMERICAN OIL PRODUCTION IS 
AT AN ALL TIME HIGH. 
WE HAVE NEVER PRODUCED AS MUCH 
AND THE UNITED STATES IS NOW A 
NET NATURAL GAS EXPORTER FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN 60 
YEARS, 6-0. 
 
WE WILL VERY SHORTLY BE THE 
LARGEST IN THE WORLD IN ENERGY, 
THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. 
THINK OF THAT. 
 
>> AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, 
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN. 
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN. 
>> AND I TOLD THE STORY THE 
OTHER DAY, I GET TO MEET ALL 
THESE WORLD LEADERS. 
VIRTUALLY EVERYONE COMES INTO 
THE OVAL OFFICE OR WHEREVER 
WE'RE MEETING AND THEY DON'T 
KNOW ME. 
I'M MEETING THEM MANY CASES FOR 
THE FIRST TIME. 
I'M NOT SURE THEY LIKE ME LIKE 
IN THE CASE OF NATO WHERE I 
SAID YOU GOT TO PAY YOUR BILLS, 
FOLKS. 
YOU GOT TO PAY UP. 
GOT TO PAY UP, BUT THEY LIKE 
ME, BUT EVERYONE THAT GREETS ME 
SAYS HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT. 
CONGRATULATIONS ON WHAT YOU'VE 
DONE FOR THE ECONOMY. 
IT'S THE TALK OF THE WORLD, 
TALK OF THE WORLD. 
 
>> NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BEST 
ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY, THIS IS THE TIME TO 
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE WORST TRADE 
DEALS EVER MADE BY ANY COUNTRY 
ON EARTH. 
THEY ARE THE WORST. 
FOR DECADES THE UNITED STATES 
WAS THE PIGGY BANK THAT 
EVERYBODY WAS ROBBING, ALL OF 
THESE OTHER COUNTRIES, OUR 
FRIENDS, OUR ENEMIES, OUR 
ALLIES, THE FOE. 
WE REBUILT CHINA PAYING 
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
A YEAR WITH NO THERE TO PROTECT 
YOUR MONEY, BUT YOU'RE THERE 
NOW. 
WE ARE PROTECTING YOUR MONEY. 
AND I WANT TO THANK OUR 
FARMERS. 
OUR FARMERS ARE TRUE PATRIOTS. 
 
>> BECAUSE CHINA AND OTHERS 
HAVE TARGETED -- CHINA HAD 
OTHERS, REMEMBER THIS, HAVE  
TARGETED OUR FARMERS, NOT GOOD, 
NOT NICE AND YOU KNOW WHAT OUR 
FARMERS ARE SAYING? 
IT'S OKAY. 
WE CAN TAKE IT. 
THESE ARE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. 
WE CAN TAKE IT. 
YOU KNOW WHY? 
THEY TARGET OUR FARMERS BECAUSE 
THEY KNOW IT'S ONE OF OUR GREAT 
STRENGTHS. 
IT'S US. 
IT'S NOT ME. 
IT'S US ALTOGETHER. 
THEY KNOW IT'S ONE OF OUR GREAT 
STRENGTHS. 
WE WON EVERY FARM STATE. 
YOU GOT TO SEE THE MIDDLE OF 
THAT MAP. 
WHERE'S EVEN THE MIDDLE? 
IT WAS ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT THE 
LITTLE CORNERS OF EACH SIDE, 
BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THAT IS ALL 
RED, REPUBLICAN RED, BEAUTIFUL 
REPUBLICAN RED. 
 
>> AND REMEMBER THIS. 
REMEMBER THIS. 
FARMS HAVE BEEN ON A DECLINE. 
I MEAN IT'S BEEN FOR 15 YEARS. 
IDENTIFY ONLY BEEN HERE FOR -- 
-- I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR -- 
YOU KNOW, PRETTY SOON IT'S 
GOING TO BE CLOSE TO TWO YEARS, 
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SOYBEANS, 
BIG CROP, IF YOU GO BACK TO 
ELECTION DAY AND MOVE BACK FIVE 
YEARS, SO FIVE YEARS BEFORE 
ELECTION DAY, SOYBEANS DROPPED 
50% IN PRICE. 
I WASN'T EVEN HERE. 
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP 
MARKETS. 
WE'RE GOING TO DO IT THE WAY IT 
SHOULD BE AND ALL OF THIS 
STUFF, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT 
BACK AND IT'S GOING TO BE MADE 
BACK FASTER THAN ANYBODY WOULD 
KNOW, BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN 
TREATED RIGHT. 
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT BACK 
NICE AND QUICKLY, NICE AND 
QUICKLY. 
 
>> NOW AFTER YEARS OF 
REBUILDING FOREIGN COUNTRIES 
IT'S TIME TO FINALLY REBUILD 
OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT? 
WOULDN'T YOU SAY? 
 
>> IN THE PAST POLITICIANS RAN 
FOR OFFICE PLEDGING TO CRACK 
DOWN ON UNFAIR TRADE. 
THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT 
IT, ONLY TO GET ELECTED AND 
THEY JUST DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. 
THE UNITED STATES WAS ALLOWED 
TO TRULY GET RIPPED OFF. 
 
>> BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET 
THAT HAPPEN. 
I'M NOT LIKE OTHER POLITICIANS. 
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS. 
I'VE KEPT MY PROMISES. 
 
 
>> ONE OF THE BRILLIANT PUNDITS 
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE, I 
MEAN THESE PEOPLE, HOW THEY 
HAVE GOTTEN US WRONG AND YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
THEY WERE ASKING ON ELECTION 
DAY WHERE DID ALL THESE PEOPLE 
COME FROM? 
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM? 
IN TENNESSEE THAT WAS AN EARLY 
STATE. 
THEY CAME IN AND THEY WERE 
POURING IN WITH THE EARLY VOTE 
AND THE FAKE NEWS WAS SAYING 
WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE COMING 
FROM? 
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM? 
THEY CAME FROM THE HEART. 
THEY CAME FROM PEOPLE THAT WERE 
NEVER HAPPY WITH ANYBODY UNTIL  
THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM. 
 
>> THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME FROM. 
BUT ONE OF THE PUNDITS SAID 
THAT HE'S MADE A LOT OF 
PROMISES AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE 
IT, BUT HE'S ACTUALLY KEPT FAR 
MORE PROMISES THAN HE MADE. 
DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT ONE? 
OF COURSE, THEY'LL PROBABLY BE 
THROWING HIM OUT OF 
BROADCASTING TOMORROW. 
WE'VE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST EVER 
ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO CHINA'S 
ABUSIVE TRADE PRACTICES AND 
WE'RE DOING VERY WELL WITH 
CHINA, VERY WELL, AND I HAVE A 
LOT OF RESPECT FOR CHINA AND I 
HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR 
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA, BUT THIS 
HAS BEEN TOO MANY YEARS OF 
ABUSE, $500 BILLION A YEAR. 
500BILLION. 
WE'VE HELPED REBUILD CHINA. 
WE CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE AND 
OUR FARMERS UNDERSTAND IT AND 
OUR WORKERS UNDERSTAND IT AND, 
FRANKLY, OUR COMPANIES 
UNDERSTAND IT. 
I WAS WITH ONE OF THE GREATEST 
COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, THE 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, A VERY 
SHORT WHILE AGO AND IT REALLY 
AFFECTS HIM. 
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THIS DOES AFFECT OUR COMPANY, 
BUT, MR. PRESIDENT, KEEP GOING. 
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING." 
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. 
 
>> A GREAT COMPANY, ONE OF THE 
GREATEST. 
HE SAID, "YOU'RE DOING THE 
RIGHT THING," AND I SAID, "I 
APPRECIATE IT." 
THANKS TO OUR POWERFUL TRADE 
POLICIES, THE TRADE DEFICIT IS 
FALLING AND FALLING AND FALLING 
AND BOY, DID IT FALL THIS 
QUARTER. 
 
>> THE DAYS OF PLUNDERING 
AMERICAN JOBS AND AMERICAN 
WEALTH, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. 
THEY'RE OVER. 
AMERICA FIRST, AMERICA FIRST. 
WE'RE ALSO LIVING BY TWO VERY 
IMPORTANT RULES, BUY AMERICAN 
AND HIRE AMERICAN. 
 
>> LAST WEEK I VISITED WITH 
HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN 
STEELWORKERS. 
THEY WERE LAID OFF YEARS AGO 
BECAUSE OTHER COUNTRIES WERE 
DUMPING STEEL ALL OVER OUR 
COUNTRY. 
THEY'RE NOT DUMPING SO MUCH 
ANYMORE, YOU NOTICE? 
AND IF THEY DO, THEY'RE PAYING 
A 25% TARIFF OR TAX. 
 
>> SO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY TO 
THAT? 
DUMP ALL YOU WANT. 
I HOPE YOU DUMP A LOT. 
NOW THANKS TO OUR TARIFFS OUR 
STEELWORKERS ARE BACK ON THE 
JOB. 
AMERICAN STEEL MILLS ARE BACK 
OPEN FOR BUSINESS. 
WE ARE STARTING TO SET NEW 
RECORDS AND NOBODY BELIEVED IT 
COULD HAPPEN THIS QUICKLY. 
U.S. STEEL JUST ANNOUNCED THAT 
THEY'RE BUILDING SIX NEW STEEL 
MILLS. 
 
>> AND THAT NUMBER IS SOON 
GOING TO BE LIFTED, BUT I'M NOT 
ALLOWED TO SAY THAT, SO I WON'T 
AND I'M VERY PROUD TO REPORT 
THAT NEW CORE IS GOING TO BUILD 
A BRAND-NEW $240 MILLION STEEL 
MILL, IT'S A BIG ONE, RIGHT 
HERE IN FLORIDA.
THE HEAD OF NUCOR, THAT'S A BIG 
ONE. 
THANK YOU. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 
TAXES. 
THEY WANT TO DESTROY YOUR JOBS 
AND CRUSH OUR INDUSTRY WITH 
CRIPPLING REGULATIONS AND YOU 
KNOW THE STOCK MARKET IS UP 
ALMOST 40% SINCE THAT GREAT 
NOVEMBER DAY. 
YOUR 401Ks ARE DOING VERY WELL, 
401K. 
I TELL THE STORY, I WAS IN NEW 
YORK AND I SHAKE HANDS. 
I LOVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
DO WE LOVE LAW ENFORCEMENT? 
 
>> AND I WAS SHAKING HANDS WITH 
POLICEMEN IN NEW YORK CITY AND 
THE FIRST ONE CAME UP TO ME AND 
SAID MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
I SAID WHAT DID I DO? 
HE SAID, "MY 401K IS UP 44% AND 
MY WIFE THINKS I'M FOR THE 
FIRST TIME A FINANCIAL GENIUS." 
SHE'S GIVING HIM ALL THE 
CREDIT. 
SHE SAID," DARLING, I LOVE YOU 
SO MUCH," AND HE SAID," YES, 
I'M A GREAT FINANCIAL WIZARD," 
BUT HE SAID, "YOU'RE JUST 
MAKING ME LOOK SO GOOD," AND 
WHO HAS 401Ks HERE? 
I GUARANTEE YOU ONE THING. 
I HAVE YOUR VOTE. 
I GUARANTEE IT. 
OF COURSE, IF THE FAKE NEWS DID 
A POLL, THEY'RE CALLED 
SUPPRESSION POLLS. 
YOU KNOW, POLLS ARE FAKE JUST 
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE. 
 
>> IF THE FAKE NEWS DID A POLL, 
IT 0 SHOW THAT I'M ONLY GETTING 
25% WITH THE 401K, PEOPLE, EVEN 
THOUGH THEY'RE UP 44%. 
NOW WE ARE DOING WELL AND I'M 
HAPPY YOU'RE DOING WELL. 
THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH A POLL. 
DID YOU HEAR? 
THE MOST POPULAR PERSON IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
IS TRUMP. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS? 
 
>> SO I SAID DOES THAT INCLUDE 
HONEST ABE LINCOLN? 
HE WAS PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT? 
REMEMBER I SAID WHEN I'D BE A 
LITTLE BIT WILD AND WE'D HAVE A 
LOT OF FUN, THEY'D SAY HE'S NOT 
ACTING PRESIDENTIAL AND I'D SAY 
WELL, IT'S A LOT EASIER TO ACT 
PRESIDENTIAL THAN TO DO WHAT I 
DO. 
ANYBODY CAN ACT PRESIDENTIAL. 
 
 
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. 
YOU ARE TREMENDOUS PEOPLE AND I 
WILL LEAVE NOW BECAUSE I AM 
BORING YOU TO DEATH. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>> NO, BUT I SAID I CAN BE -- I 
USED TO TELL THEM ALL THE TIME, 
THE FAKE NEWS, I'D SAY I CAN BE 
MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANY 
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY EXCEPT FOR 
POSSIBLY ABE LINCOLN WITH THE 
BIG HAT. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
ABE LOOKED PRETTY PRESIDENTIAL, 
RIGHT? 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
HE'S TOUGH. 
HE'S TOUGH. 
I ADMIT IT. 
ABE LINCOLN IS TOUGH, BUT WE 
LOVE ABE LINCOLN. 
ONE OF THESE GUYS WHEN THAT 
POLL CAME OUT MOST POPULAR AND 
IT WAS IN THE 90s AND ONE OF 
THESE GUYS ON TELEVISION, YOU 
KNOW, CAN'T MISS A WORD, CAN'T 
MISS A WORD. 
THEY SEE THE POLL. 
OH, MY GOD. 
LOOK AT THIS. 
OH, MY GOD. 
YEAH, SEVEN MORE YEARS, SEVEN 
MORE. 
SEVEN MORE. 
 
>> OH, MY GOD. 
WE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING. 
WE GOT TO DO ANYTHING, ANYTHING 
TO GET HIM OUT. 
HE'S DOING TOO WELL. 
THIS IS NOT GOOD. 
WORST OF ALL, DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
-- YOU KNOW THAT -- THEY WANT 
TO OPEN OUR BORDERS. 
THEY WANT TO LET CRIME, 
TREMENDOUS CRIME, INTO OUR 
COUNTRY, CAN'T DO IT. 
 
>> REPUBLICANS WANT STRONG 
BORDERS AND NO CRIME. 
DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN BORDERS 
WHICH EQUALS MASSIVE CRIME. 
AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE 
DEMOCRATS, NANCY PELOSI, THE 
WHOLE GROUP, MAXINE, MAXINE, 
SHE LIKES ME A LOT, THEY'VE 
LAUNCHED OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS ON 
OUR INCREDIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS AND ON I.C.E. 
AND OUR BORDER PATROL. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
PEOPLE THAT KEEP US SAFE. 
THEIR NEW PLATFORM, WHAT THEY 
WANT TO DO, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, 
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH I.C.E. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO 
LET MS-13 RULE OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. 
EVERY DAY THE BRAVE MEN AND 
WOMEN OF I.C.E. 
ARE LIBERATING COMMUNITIES AND 
TOWNS FROM SAVAGE GANGS LIKE MS-
13 THAT ARE OCCUPYING OUR 
COUNTRY LIKE ANOTHER NATION 
WOULD. 
WE WANT MAXIMUM BORDER SECURITY 
AND RESPECT FOR OUR HEROES, 
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TREMENDOUS BORDER SECURITY THAT 
WILL INCLUDE THE WALL. 
THAT WILL INCLUDE THE WALL. 
 
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
IT, BUT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED 
THE WALL. 
WE'VE GOT $1.6 BILLION AND 
WE'VE STARTED LARGE PORTIONS OF 
THE WALL, BUT WE'RE GOING TO 
NEED -- EVEN THE WAY WE 
NEGOTIATE, WE'RE GOING TO NEED 
MORE. 
WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE AND WE 
MAY HAVE TO DO SOME PRETTY 
DRASTIC THINGS, BUT WE'RE GOING 
TO GET IT. 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT 
VOTING FOR WHAT WE WANT TO DO 
AND THEY'RE NOT VOTING AND 
ALLOWING OUR VALUES TO TAKE 
PLACE IN OUR COUNTRY. 
WE'RE TRACKING DOWN THE GANG 
MEMBERS AND WE'RE TRACKING DOWN 
THE DRUG DEALERS AND THE CHILD 
PREDATORS AND THE CRIMINAL 
ALIENS AND WE'RE THROWING THEM 
IN JAIL OR THROWING THEM THE 
HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
 
>> IN SOME STATES DEMOCRATS ARE 
EVEN TRYING TO GIVE ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS THE RIGHT TO VOTE. 
THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM THE 
RIGHT TO VOTE. 
 
>> AND WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE 
PEOPLE THAT ARE WAITING IN LINE 
FOR SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, 10 
YEARS TRYING TO GET INTO OUR 
COUNTRY. 
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
VOTE. 
WE BELIEVE THAT ONLY AMERICAN 
CITIZENS SHOULD VOTE IN 
AMERICAN ELECTIONS. 
 
>> WHICH IS WHY THE TIME HAS 
COME FOR VOTER ID LIKE 
EVERYTHING ELSE, VOTER ID. 
 
>> IF YOU GO OUT AND YOU WANT 
TO BUY GROCERIES, YOU NEED A 
PICTURE ON A CARD. 
YOU NEED ID. 
YOU GO OUT AND YOU WANT TO BUY 
ANYTHING, YOU NEED ID AND YOU 
NEED YOUR PICTURE. 
IN THIS COUNTRY THE ONLY TIME 
YOU DON'T NEED IT IN MANY CASES 
IS WHEN YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR A 
PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU WANT TO 
VOTE FOR A SENATOR, WHEN YOU 
WANT TO VOTE FOR A GOVERNOR OR 
A CONGRESSMAN. 
IT'S CRAZY. 
IT'S CRAZY. 
BUT WE'RE TURNING IT AROUND. 
REMEMBER, I SAID IT'S AWFULLY 
EARLY TO BE THINKING THIS, BUT 
I ALWAYS THINK IT. 
REMEMBER THE ATTACK ON MERRY 
CHRISTMAS? 
THEY'RE NOT ATTACKING IT 
ANYMORE. 
EVERYONE IS HAPPY TO SAY MERRY 
CHRISTMAS, RIGHT? 
MERRY CHRISTMAS. 
MERRY CHRISTMAS. 
THAT WAS UNDER SIEGE. 
YOU'D HAVE THESE BIG DEPARTMENT 
STORES THAT SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS. 
THEY SAY WHERE'S THE MERRY 
CHRISTMAS? 
NOW THEY'RE ALL PUTTING UP 
MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN. 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE, ONLY 
BECAUSE, OF OUR CAMPAIGN. 
BY THE WAY, THE EVANGELICALS 
AND PAULA WHITE, PASTOR PAULA 
WHITE, THE EVANGELICALS HAVE 
BEEN SO AMAZING TO US. 
THEY CAME OUT AND THEY VOTED, 
84% AND DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THE 
NUMBERS THAT EVER VOTED IN AN 
ELECTION BEFORE. 
WE LOVE THE EVANGELICAL 
CHRISTIANS. 
IF YOU WANT SAFETY, IF YOU WANT 
BORDERS, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A 
COUNTRY, THEN YOU NEED TO GO 
OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
 
>> AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, YOU 
NEED TO GO OUT AND VOTE FOR RON 
DESANTIS FOR GOVERNOR OF 
FLORIDA. 
 
>> THE LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL 
INTERESTS FIGHTING AGAINST MY 
ADMINISTRATION, MANY OF THEM 
ARE GLOBALISTS. 
THEY CARE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR 
COUNTRIES. 
I CARE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE 
USA. 
 
 
>> THEY'RE THE GENIUSES WHO 
CAME UP WITH OUR TERRIBLE TRADE 
DEALS ONE AFTER ANOTHER. 
HOW ABOUT NAFTA. 
REMEMBER WHEN THEY SIGNED 
NAFTA? 
REMEMBER THEY SIGNED NAFTA AND 
EVERYBODY JUST MOVED THEIR 
COMPANIES DOWN TO MEXICO AND 
THESE PEOPLE WERE SAYING ISN'T 
THAT A WONDERFUL THING? 
NO, IT'S NOT A WONDERFUL THING 
AND THOSE COMPANIES ARE NOW 
MOVING BACK. 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LOST 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVERSEAS 
AND WHO GAVE US OUR HORRIBLE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
THESE LAWS ARE THE WORST. 
I AM FOR AMERICA FIRST AND THE 
AMERICAN WORKER. 
WE WANT TO BE A PUPPET FOR NO 
ONE ANY LONGER. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A PUPPET 
ANY LONGER. 
MY ONLY SPECIAL INTEREST IS 
YOU, THE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
I'VE HAD A GREAT CAREER. 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN. 
EVEN IN FLORIDA I'VE HAD A 
GREAT CAREER. 
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN. 
I'VE DONE GREAT. 
I'VE DONE REALLY WELL, BEYOND 
ANYTHING I COULD HAVE EVER 
EXPECTED AND THEN I RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT WITH NO EXPERIENCE 
AND I WON. 
ISN'T THAT INTERESTING? 
 
>> BUT YOU ACTUALLY WON. 
I TOLD THE STORY THE OTHER DAY 
I WAS PROBABLY IN WASHINGTON MY 
ENTIRE LIFE 17 TIMES, TRUE, 17 
TIMES. 
I DON'T THINK I EVER STAYED 
OVERNIGHT. 
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT, 
RIGHT? 
AND WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET 
NOW, A COUPLE LITTLE CHANGES, 
BU WE HAVE A GREAT CABINET. 
WE HAVE MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY 
OF STATE, SO MANY GREAT PEOPLE. 
AND WE'RE REALLY GETTING -- WE 
HAVE JUST INCREDIBLE PEOPLE, 
BUT I MADE SOME CHOICES THAT I 
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE, BUT I'M 
WRITING DOWN PENNSYLVANIA 
AVENUE AGAIN. 
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE ABOUT 17 
TIMES AND PROBABLY SEVEN OF 
THOSE TIMES WAS TO CHECK OUT 
THE HOTEL I'M BUILDING ON 
PENNSYLVANIAAVENUE AND THEN I 
HOP ON THE PLANE. 
I GO BACK. 
SO I'VE BEEN THERE 17 TIMES, 
NEVER STAYED THERE AT NIGHT, I 
DON'T BELIEVE, AND THEN I'M 
RIDING DOWN IN THIS BEAUTIFUL 
CAR, PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT 
BY SECRET SERVICE, HOLDING THE 
HAND OF OUR GREAT FIRST LADY -- 
 
>> -- AND I LOOK AT HER AND I 
SAY, "HONEY, GUESS WHAT? 
I'M PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES." 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
AND I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY IN 
WASHINGTON, BUT NOW I KNOW 
EVERYBODY IN WASHINGTON. 
I KNOW THE GOOD ONES. 
I KNOW THE BAD ONES. 
I KNOW THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND 
I KNOW THE SCUM. 
AND AMERICA NOW IS WINNING 
AGAIN LIKE THEY HAVEN'T WON 
BEFORE. 
WE PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS 
AND REFORM IN AMERICAN HISTORY, 
BIGGEST CUTS IN HISTORY, MORE 
THAN 100 UTILITIES HAVE SLASHED 
RATES FOR CONSUMERS INCLUDING 
RIGHT HERE FROM DUKE ENERGY AND 
TAMPA ELECTRIC. 
YOUR RATES HAVE GONE DOWN. 
OVER $300 BILLION POURED BACK 
INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THE 
FIRST QUARTER AND WE EXPECT TO 
BE TAKING BACK BECAUSE OF OUR 
NEW TAX CUT AND REFORM PLAN 
THAT PASSED BIGGER THAN 
ANYTHING EVER IN OUR COUNTRY, 
WE EXPECT TO BE TAKING BACK 
FROM OVERSEAS OVER $4 TRILLION. 
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. 
COULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK 
BEFORE. 
AND IF OUR OPPONENT HAD WON AND 
THE DEMOCRATS HAD WON, THEY 
WOULD HAVE PUT MORE REGULATIONS 
ON. 
THEY WOULD HAVE RAISED YOUR 
TAXES. 
THEY WOULD HAVE OPENED YOUR 
BORDERS, GOTTEN RID OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED YOUR 
MILITARY AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE GOING TO 
HELL. 
INSTEAD OF GOING UP, THE MARKET 
WOULD BE HALF OF WHAT IT WAS, 
IF WE'RE LUCKY, BECAUSE, 
FRANKLY, THE TAX CUTS WERE 
INCREDIBLE TO WHAT WE'VE DONE, 
BUT MAYBE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT 
ARE THE CUTS IN THESE HORRIBLE 
REGULATIONS THAT DIDN'T ALLOW 
ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING. 
JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 
WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF MORE 
REGULATIONS THAN ANY PRESIDENT 
IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED 
STATES AND THAT'S DONE IN LESS 
THAN TWO YEARS. 
>> I WITHDREW THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE UNFAIR, ONE SIDED 
VERY, VERY EXPENSIVE JOB 
KILLING PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. 
WE REPEALED THE CORE OF 
OBAMACARE. 
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS GONE. 
YOU KNOW, THE INDIVIDUAL 
MANDATE, THAT'S A BEAUTY. 
ONLY THE PAST ADMINISTRATION 
COULD HAVE COME UP WITH THIS. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU PAY A LOT OF 
MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT 
PAYING IN ORDER TO HAVE POOR 
HEALTHCARE. 
OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A 
WONDERFUL THING. 
SO YOU PAY ALL THIS MONEY FOR 
THE PRIVILEGE OF NOT HAVING TO 
PAY AND THE HEALTHCARE'S NO 
GOOD TO START OFF WITH AND 
WE'RE DOING GREAT ON 
HEALTHCARE. 
WE'RE ALLOWING AMERICANS TO BUY 
BETTER HEALTHCARE FOR LESS 
MONEY THROUGH ASSOCIATION 
HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING ACROSS 
STATE LINES MEANING YOU'RE 
GETTING TREMENDOUS COMPETITION. 
WE PASSED THE BIGGEST VA REFORM 
IN HALF A CENTURY, VETERANS 
CHOICE. 
IF OUR VETERANS CAN'T GET THE 
CARE THEY NEED FROM THE VA, 
THEY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO 
SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR.  
WE'LL PAY FOR THE DOCTOR AND, 
FRANKLY, WE'LL SAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
WE'LL HELP A LOT OF VETS. 
 
>> EVERYBODY SAID THEY'VE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET IT FOR 45 YEARS. 
EVERYBODY SAID YOU CAN'T GET 
IT. 
THINK OF IT. 
THINK OF IT. 
VETERANS CHOICE. 
THESE ARE OUR GREAT PEOPLE. 
WHO IS A VETERAN IN THIS 
AUDIENCE? 
YOU LIKE TRUMP? 
YOU LIKE THE JOB WE'RE DOING? 
WELL, THINK OF IT. 
45 YEARS EVERYBODY SAID YOU'LL 
NEVER GET IT PASSED AND I USED 
TO SAY BEFORE I REALLY WAS WELL 
VERSED ON THE VETERAN SITUATION 
AND HEALTHCARE, I USED TO SAY 
ALL THE TIME WHY DON'T THEY 
JUST LET THE FOLKS GO TO A 
DOCTOR? 
THEY'D WAIT IN LINE FOR SEVEN 
DAYS, NINE DAYS, 14 DAYS, 21 
DAYS. 
SOME OF THEM STARTED OFF WITH A 
VERY MODEST PROBLEM. 
THEY END UP BEING TERMINAL 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE A 
DOCTOR. 
I SAID WHY DON'T THEY JUST LET 
THEM GO SEE A LOCAL PRIVATE 
DOCTOR, PAY THE BILL AND TAKE 
CARE OF IT? 
IT WILL BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE 
AND IT'S TURNED OUT TO BE 
SOMETHING THAT THE VETERANS 
LOVE. 
THEY LOVE AND IT'S PASSED. 
IT'S PASSED. 
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IT 
PASSED FOR 38 YEARS. 
THE OTHER ONE IS 45 AND THAT'S 
VA ACCOUNTABILITY. 
IF SOMEBODY TREATED OUR 
VETERANS BADLY, IF THEY STALL, 
IF THEY WERE -- YOU KNOW THIS 
-- IF THEY WERE SADISTIC, IF 
THEY WERE REALLY BAD TO OUR 
VETS, ALL RIGHT, REALLY, REALLY 
BAD, WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT. 
THEY COULD STEAL. 
THEY COULD ROB. 
THEY COULD BE ABUSIVE. 
YOU COULDN'T SAY YOU'RE FIRED. 
NOW YOU CAN SAY YOU'RE FIRED. 
 
>> MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE THEY SAID 
YOU'LL NEVER GET IT DONE. 
BETWEEN CIVIL SERVICE AND 
UNIONS, WE LOVE THEM BOTH, BUT 
BETWEEN CIVIL SERVICE AND 
UNIONS THEY SAID YOU'LL NEVER 
GET IT DONE. 
YOU'LL NEVER GET IT APPROVED 
AND BY THE WAY, WE HAD 
VIRTUALLY NO HELP, VERY LITTLE 
FROM DEMOCRATS, VERY LITTLE, 
NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT, BUT 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE 
TRUMP ANY VICTORY. 
THEY'LL DO EVERYTHING THAT'S 
WRONG. 
LOOK AT JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THIS IS A GREAT, GREAT, HIGHLY 
RESPECTED MAN. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE 
REPUBLICANS, I BELIEVE, ARE 
CLOSE TO 100%, WHICH IS WHAT WE 
NEED. 
 
>> BUT SO FAR THE DEMOCRATS 
HAVEN'T GIVEN US ANY VOTES AND 
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WILL DO 
ANYTHING THEY CAN TO NOT HELP 
THE TRUMP AGENDA EVEN THOUGH 
THEY KNOW IT'S WRONG. 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH, HIGHEST 
EDUCATION, BEST GRADES, BEST 
TESTS, BEST EVERYTHING, THEY 
THOUGHT 15 YEARS AGO HE WAS 
GOING TO BE A SUPREME COURT 
JUDGE. 
LOOK AT JUSTICE GORSUCH, HOW 
GOOD IS HE? 
HOW GOOD IS HE? 
SO WE'RE GETTING THEM THROUGH, 
BUT IT'S NOT EASY. 
THE TERM THEY USE IS RESIST. 
IT'S ACTUALLY RESIST AND 
OBSTRUCT. 
WHATEVER THEY CAN DO TO RESIST 
AND OBSTRUCT AND, FRANKLY, 
THEY'RE LOUSY POLITICIANS. 
THEY HAVE HORRIBLE POLICY. 
THE ONE THING THEY'RE GOOD AT, 
THEY STICK TOGETHER AND THEY 
OBSTRUCT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. 
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALMOST 400 
PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO 
GOVERNMENT, MANY OF WHOM HAVE 
LEFT THEIR JOBS AND THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THEM UP 
WITH MAXIMUM DELAY. 
THEY'RE HOLDING THEM UP NOT 
ALLOWING THESE GREAT PEOPLE TO 
SERVE THEIR COUNTRY. 
IT'S A DISGRACE. 
THAT'S CHUCK SCHUMER AND IT'S A 
DISGRACE. 
IT'S A DISGRACE. 
BUT WE'LL GET THAT SUPREME 
COURT JUDGE AND THAT'S THE BIG 
ONE. 
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO 
LOVE OUR MILITARY, WE HAVE 
SECURED A RECORD $700 BILLION 
FOR OUR MILITARY WITH ANOTHER 
$716 BILLION NEXT YEAR ALL 
APPROVED. 
AND THIS IS GREAT NEWS FOR THE 
INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS AT MacDILL 
AIR FORCE BASE. 
 
>> THE PROUD HOME OF THE SIXTH 
AIR MOBILITY WING, U.S. CENTRAL 
COMMAND AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS 
COMMAND. 
COME ON. 
LET'S HEAR IT. 
 WE'RE 
ADDING NEARLY 30,000 NEW 
SOLDIERS, AIRMEN, MARINES AND 
WE SECURED THE LARGEST PAY 
RAISE FOR OUR GREAT WARRIORS IN 
A DECADE. 
I'VE ALSO DIRECTED THE PENTAGON 
TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF 
CREATING THE SIXTH BRANCH OF 
OUR MILITARY, THE SPACE FORCE. 
BUILDING THE SPACE FORCE. 
AND WE'RE DOING WELL IN NORTH 
KOREA, ALTHOUGH I HAPPEN TO 
THINK THAT WE'RE DOING SO WELL 
WITH CHINA THAT CHINA MAY BE IS 
GETTING IN OUR WAY, BUT WE'RE 
GOING TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT 
BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT 
IT. 
BUT WE'RE DOING WELL IN NORTH 
KOREA. 
WE HAVE OUR, AS YOU KNOW, WE 
HAVE OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
 
>> THERE'S BEEN NO NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
THERE'S BEEN NO MISSILES OR 
ROCKETS FLYING BEAUTIFULLY OVER 
JAPAN. 
I THINK OUR RELATIONSHIP IS 
VERY GOOD WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
WE'LL ALL SEE HOW IT ALL WORKS 
OUT, BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE 
TALKING AND YOU'LL SEE HOW IT 
IS. 
YOU REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST TOOK 
OFFICE? 
IT REALLY LOOKED LIKE BIG 
TROUBLE AND THE PAST 
ADMINISTRATION, THEY THOUGHT 
THAT WAS BY FAR THEIR BIGGEST 
PROBLEM. 
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO WORK 
OUT VERY WELL, BUT A LOT OF 
GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING, NO 
TESTS, NO ROCKETS FLYING, BUT 
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
 
>> AND OUR VICE PRESIDENT MIKE 
PENCE IS GOING TO HAWAII TO 
BRING BACK THE REMAINS AND TO 
GREET THE FAMILIES OF OUR GREAT 
HEROS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN 
KOREA, OUR FALLEN WARRIORS. 
THEY'RE FINALLY COMING HOME TO 
LAY AT REST IN AMERICAN SOIL. 
 [ 
CHANTING USA ] 
>> I ALSO WITHDREW THE UNITED 
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE-
SIDED $150 BILLION WAS PAID, 
1.8 BILLION IN CASH, THE IRAN 
NUCLEAR DEAL. 
IT'S A HORROR SHOW. 
 
>> I HOPE IT WORKS OUT WELL 
WITH IRAN. 
THEY'RE HAVING A LOT OF 
DIFFICULTY RIGHT NOW. 
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT WELL AND I 
HAVE A FEELING THEY'LL BE 
TALKING TO US PRETTY SOON. 
MAYBE NOT AND THAT'S OKAY, TOO. 
IN DECEMBER I RECOGNIZED 
ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL, 
JERUSALEM. 
IN ABOUT FIVE MONTHS WE OPENED 
ALREADY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN 
JERUSALEM. 
AND PEOPLE HAD THAT SCHEDULED 
FOR ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO 10 
YEARS AND YOU ALL KNOW THE 
STORY. 
WE TOOK AN EXISTING BUILDING. 
WE PLAYED AROUND WITH IT. 
WE RENOVATED IT. 
WE FIXED IT UP. 
WE USED JERUSALEM STONE, ONE OF 
THE FINEST STONES ACTUALLY IN 
THE WORLD, JERUSALEM STONE. 
SO INSTEAD OF SPENDING 1 
BILLION AND THE PAPERS WERE 
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, SIR, 
WOULD YOU PLEASE APPROVE THIS? 
WHAT IS IT? 
THIS IS FOR THE EMBASSY IN 
ISRAEL, AMERICAN, SIR. 
I SAID HOW MUCH? 
$1BILLION, SIR. 
1BILLION. 
I IMMEDIATELY CALLED OUR GREAT 
AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, DAVID 
FRIEDMAN, VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN, 
GREAT LAWYER, BUT ONE OF THE 
MOST SUCCESSFUL LAWYERS IN THE 
COUNTRY BEFORE HE DECIDED TO DO 
WHAT HE'S DOING. 
I SAID, "DAVID, THEY WANT US TO 
PAY $1 BILLION FOR THE EMBASSY. 
I DON'T WANT TO PAY $1 BILLION. 
STUDY IT. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY BUILDINGS THAT 
WE OWN? 
WE OWN SO MUCH WE DON'T EVEN 
KNOW WHAT THE HELL WE OWN. 
FIND SOME BUILDING IN A GREAT 
LOCATION. 
CALL ME BACK." 
HE CALLED ME BACK TWO DAYS 
LATER AND SAID MR. PRESIDENT, 
SIR, WE OWN THE BEST SITE IN 
JERUSALEM. 
IT'S BIG, BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S 
GOT A BUILDING ON IT. 
I CAN TAKE THAT BUILDING AND 
RENOVATE IT. 
I CAN DO IT FOR $140,000. 
 
>> I SAID DAVID, HOW GOOD IS 
THE SITE? 
WE COULD NEVER BUY A BETTER 
SITE. 
THEY WERE WILLING TO SPEND TENS 
OF MILLIONS FOR A SITE. 
THEY WANTED TO BUY A SITE WHICH 
WAS SO BAD IT WAS TOTALLY 
INFERIOR TO WHAT WE ALREADY 
HAD. 
DON'T FORGET, WE GET THERE 
FIRST, RIGHT? 
WE HAVE GOOD SITES AND I SAID 
DAVID, DO ME A FAVOR. 
DON'T MAKE IT 140,000, SOUNDS 
TOO CHEAP. 
MAKE IT LIKE 400,000. 
THAT'S OKAY, TOO, DAVID. 
SO WE SAVED ALMOST $1 BILLION. 
I COULD TELL YOU THESE STORIES 
ALL DAY LONG, AIRPLANE 
PURCHASES. 
I COULD TELL YOU ALL DAY. 
 
>> AND WE STARTED WORKING AND 
FOR $400,000 WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 
VERY BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN EMBASSY 
IN JERUSALEM, REALLY BEAUTIFUL. 
 
>> NOW THAT'S ONE I GUARANTEE 
NO OTHER PRESIDENT'S DOING. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE CROOKED HILLARY 
DOING THAT? 
CAN YOU? 
HONESTLY? 
 
 
>> IN ALL FAIRNESS, IN ALL 
FAIRNESS TO HER, COULD YOU 
IMAGINE ANYBODY ELSE DOING 
THAT? 
NOBODY ELSE. 
NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO DO 
THAT. 
I COULD TELL YOU STORIES ABOUT 
WHAT WE'VE SAVED WITH PURCHASES 
OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. 
GENERAL MATTIS WOULD BE GLAD TO 
TELL YOU, BUT HE CAN'T BELIEVE 
IT AND SOME OF THE GENERALS 
HAVE SAID THEY'VE NEVER SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD. 
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BECAUSE I 
WANT THAT $700 BILLION PROPERLY 
SPENT. 
IF WE CAN BUY TWICE THE NUMBER 
OF AIRCRAFT OR HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY LEFT OVER, THAT'S WHAT WE 
WANT. 
 
>> INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR 
AMERICA, WE'RE STANDING UP FOR 
AMERICA. 
WE'RE STANDING UP FOR THE 
HEROES WHO PROTECT AMERICA AND 
YES, WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP 
FOR OUR GREAT NATIONAL ANTHEM. 
 
>> WITH EVERY PROMISE WE KEEP, 
EVERY RECORD WE BREAK, EVERY 
FACTORY WE OPEN, WE ARE 
RESTORING AMERICAN STRENGTH AND 
AMERICAN PRIDE. 
 
>> BUT TO CONTINUE THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOMENTUM, THIS 
INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A 
MOVEMENT -- THIS MAY BE -- IN 
FACT, IT PROBABLY IS -- THE 
GREATEST MOVEMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
EVEN THEY WILL SAY THAT. 
 
>> EVEN THEY WILL SAY THAT. 
BUT TO KEEP IT GOING WE NEED TO 
ELECT MORE REPUBLICANS. 
WE NEED MORE VOTES AND WE NEED 
TO ELECT RON DESANTIS AS YOUR 
GOVERNOR. 
GOT TO DO IT. 
I'M TELLING YOU I KNOW HIM 
WELL. 
HE'S A GREAT, GREAT GUY. 
HE'S GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE 
GOVERNOR. 
I HAVE NO DOUBT. 
I HAVE NO DOUBT. 
I DON'T DO THESE ENDORSEMENTS 
EASILY. 
I DON'T NEED TO BE HERE, BUT I 
HAPPEN TO LOVE THIS STATE. 
SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS, 
BUT I DON'T DO THEM EASILY, 
ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO HAVE AN 
IMPACT. 
THE OTHER DAY WE ENDORSED A 
GREAT GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA. 
HE WAS PROBABLY FIVE POINTS 
DOWN. 
HE WON THE ELECTION BY 40 
POINTS. 
 
>> HE GOT 70% OF THE VOTE. 
THE 30, THINK OF THAT. 
GREAT GUY. 
AND MANY OTHERS. 
I MEAN WE COULD GO OVER ONE 
AFTER ANOTHER. 
THEY'RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO 
GIVE US CREDIT FOR THIS. 
I DON'T THINK THERE'S EVER BEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE IT. 
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO BE HERE TO 
FORMALLY -- I'VE BEEN ENDORSING 
RON. 
I'VE BEEN SAYING GREAT THINGS, 
BUT I WANTED TO BE HERE TO 
FORMALLY ENDORSE RON. 
YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE. 
>> THANK YOU, MRS. DESANTIS, 
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, BEAUTIFUL 
FAMILY. 
GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR 
COLLEAGUES, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS 
AND GET OUT AND VOTE IN 
NOVEMBER. 
YOU GOT TO DO IT BECAUSE 
REMEMBER WE'RE GOING TO WIN 
THIS PRIMARY, BUT DON'T TAKE 
ANY CHANCES. 
NICE LEAD, NICE LEAD. 
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES AND THEN 
ABOUT -- GIVE YOURSELF 10, 15 
MINUTES OF HAPPINESS AND THEN 
GO BACK TO WORK FOR NOVEMBER 
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THEY'RE PUTTING UP -- I KNOW 
SOME OF THE CANDIDATES. 
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T 
CARE ABOUT STOPPING CRIME. 
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT DON'T 
CARE ABOUT PEOPLE POURING INTO 
OUR COUNTRY WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T 
BE HERE. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT STOPPING 
DRUGS FROM POISONING OUR YOUTH 
AND POURING OVER THE BORDER. 
THEY DON'T CARE. 
YOUR FUTURE GOVERNOR CARES AND 
YOUR CURRENT GOVERNOR CARES, 
RICK SCOTT. 
 
>> LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU, 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE FROM THE 
GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA, HELPED 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER 
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO WHERE 
IT BELONGS, THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
>> THIS STATE WAS SETTLED BY 
PIONEERS AND VISIONARIES WHO 
EXPLORED THE MARSHES AND RAISED 
UP CITIES RIGHT ON THE SEA. 
THIS STATE WAS BUILT BY RED 
BLOODED AMERICAN PATRIOTS WHO 
OPENED THE FIRST NAVAL AIR 
STATION AT PENSACOLA AND 
LAUNCHED THE FIRST BRAVE 
AMERICAN SOARING INTO THE 
HEAVENS. 
WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
GENERATIONS OF PROUD AMERICANS 
WHO KNEW HOW TO WORK, KNEW HOW 
TO FIGHT AND KNEW HOW TO WIN, 
WIN. 
 
>> AND YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ELECT 
RON DESANTIS AS YOUR GOVERNOR 
BECAUSE YOU SEE IT ALREADY, 
WE'RE WINNING SO MUCH. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING A 
LITTLE TIRED OF WINNING, RIGHT? 
WELL, BY THEN IT WILL BE 
ANOTHER YEAR, TWO YEARS AND 
THREE YEARS AND YOU'LL BE 
INSISTING GOVERNOR DESANTIS, 
PLEASE SEE OUR PRESIDENT. 
IT'S TOO MUCH WINNING. 
WE CAN'T. 
WE CAN'T STAND IT. 
THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA, WE CAN'T 
STAND IT BECAUSE UNDER PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS WE NEVER WON. 
WE GOT USED TO NEVER WINNING 
AND HE'S GOING TO COME TO ME IN 
WASHINGTON IN THE OVAL OFFICE, 
THE BEAUTIFUL OVAL OFFICE, AND 
HE'S GOING TO SAY MR. 
PRESIDENT, THE PEOPLE OF 
FLORIDA ARE JUST DOWNRIGHT 
TIRED OF WINNING. 
THEY CAN'T STAND IT. 
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
THE ECONOMY IS TOO GOOD. 
THE JOBS ARE TOO STRONG. 
WE'RE DOING TOO WELL. 
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? 
I CAN SAY RON, I DON'T CARE 
WHEN YOU SAY. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ON WINNING. 
WE'RE GOING TO WIN SO MUCH AND 
THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA ACTUALLY 
LOVE IT, DON'T THEY? 
THEY LOVE IT. 
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID RIGHT AT 
THE BEGINNING. 
WE'RE RESPECTED AGAIN AND THAT 
MAN IS RESPECTED AND ALWAYS HAS 
BEEN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER, EVER BACK DOWN 
AND WE WILL NEVER, EVER 
SURRENDER BECAUSE WE ARE 
AMERICANS AND OUR HEARTS BLEED 
RED, WHITE AND BLUE. 
 
>> WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
WE ARE ONE FAMILY AND WE ARE 
ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. 
 
>> AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU, FLORIDA. 
THANK YOU.

>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A CAMPAIGN 
STYLE RALLY IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, 
WITH A LOT OF RED MEAT FOR THE 
PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS COVERING 
A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS THERE 
INCLUDING, OF COURSE, 
IMMIGRATION, TAX CUTS, THE 
ECONOMY. 
OUR OWN CBS NEWS CHIEF WHITE 
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MAJOR 
GARRETT IS ON THE ROAD, HAD 
ANOTHER RINGSIDE SEAT FOR YET 
ANOTHER RALLY. 
MAJOR, SO IT WAS INTERESTING 
THE PRESIDENT WAS THERE TO 
RALLY THE BASE ON BEHALF OF 
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS. 
"HE'S GOING TO BE YOUR NEXT 
GOVERNOR AND HIS NAME IS RON 
DESANTIS," NO MENTION OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT GOP CANDIDATE. 
YOU'VE GOT THIS PRIMARY CONTEST 
AUGUST 28th. 
FIRST OF ALL, EXPLAIN WHY THE 
PRESIDENT HAS PICKED A SIDE 
HERE AND IS BACKING RON 
DESANTIS. 
>> Reporter:  BECAUSE OVER TIME 
HE BECAME A FAN OF CONGRESSMAN 
RON DESANTIS PRINCIPALLY BY 
WATCHING HIM ON TELEVISION, ON 
FOX NEWS, BE A FIERCE DEFENDER 
OF THE PRESIDENT AND A VERY 
HARSH CRITIC OF THE ROBERT 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND WHAT 
YOU'RE SEEING PLAYING OUT IS 
THE TRUMP EFFECT BEGINS TO 
RESHAPE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
YOU ALSO SEE HOW THE FOX NEWS 
EFFECT INFLUENCES THAT 
RESHAPING OF THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY AND IT'S PLAYING OUT 
RIGHT HERE IN FLORIDA. 
THE OTHER CANDIDATE IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR 
IS ADAM PUTNAM, VERY WELL 
KNOWN, VERY WELL RESPECTED, 
HEAVILY ENDORSED, WELL FUNDED, 
WAS LEADING THIS RACE FOR A 
GOOD LONG WHILE, CONSIDERED THE 
HEIR A TO RICK -- HARE TO RICK 
SCOTT. 
WE SAW DESANTIS SHOWING UP 
ALWAYS DEFENDING THE PRESIDENT. 
THAT AFFINITY DEVELOPED BECAUSE 
THE PRESIDENT LIKED WHAT HE 
HEARD FROM RON DESANTIS AND 
THEREFORE DECIDED TO WADE INTO 
THIS PRIMARY. 
EVEN THOUGH NOT ONLY HAVE MANY 
FLORIDA REPUBLICANS BACKED OUT, 
ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST 
POLITICAL ALLIES OF THIS STATE, 
PAM BONDI, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
HAS ALSO BACKED ADAM PUTNAM. 
SO THE PRESIDENT IS PUTTING 
HIMSELF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF 
A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. 
THE LAST DAY TO REGISTER TO 
VOTE IN THAT PRIMARY IS THIS 
COMING MONDAY. 
SO THE PRESIDENT CAME DOWN HERE 
NOT ONLY TO OFFER A SPEECH 
ABOUT WHAT HE'S ACCOMPLISHED AS 
PRESIDENT, BUT TO BORE IN ON 
TIS REP PRIMARY AND PUT ALL OF 
HIS WEIGHT BEHIND RON DESANTIS 
MENTIONING HIM MANY, MANY TIMES 
THROUGH THE COURSE OF HIS 
REMARKS TRYING TO SEND AN ECHO 
AFFECT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. 
BY ENDORSING DESANTIS A COUPLE 
WEEKS AGO THE RACE HAS NOW 
SHIFTED. 
PUTNAM IS TRAILING NOW BY 
DOUBLE DIGITS AND IS WONDERING 
IF HE CAN BOUNCE BACK. 
WELL, THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING 
TO MAKE SURE ADAM PUTNAM 
DOESN'T BOUNCE BACK AND THEN HE 
RESHAPED THE FLORIDA REPUBLICAN 
PARTY BY ELEVATING DESANTIS AND 
MAKING HIM THE REPUBLICAN 
NOMINEE. 
>> LET'S TURN TO GOVERNOR RICK 
SCOTT AND HIS SENATE CONTEST. 
INTERESTINGLY GOVERNOR SCOTT IS 
NOT THERE AT THE RALLY. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT MIGHT 
BE? 
>> Reporter:  WELL, RICK SCOTT 
WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS 
MORNING FOCUSING ON THE 
ALLIANCE HE HAS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT ON POLICY, BUT I 
DON'T THINK RICK SCOTT 
CONSIDERS IT A GOOD IDEA TO 
ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH THIS 
INTRAPARTY SQUABBLE GOING ON, 
THE ONE REALLY CREATED -- NOT 
CREATED BY THE PRESIDENT 
BECAUSE DESANTIS WAS RUNNING, 
BUT MADE ALL THE MORE VISIBLE 
BY THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT 
OF DESANTIS AND HOW THAT 
ENDORSEMENT REMADE THE RACE 
ALMOST OVERNIGHT. 
I THINK RICK SCOTT WOULD PREFER 
TO KEEP SOMEWHAT A DISTANCE 
FROM THE RACE TO SUCCEED HIM, 
FOCUS ON HIS CAMPAIGN, FOCUS ON 
WHAT HE DOES AND HAS DONE AS 
GOVERNOR TO WORK ALONGSIDE AND 
WITH THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, BUT 
NOT PUT HIMSELF IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THIS INTRAPARTY FEUD. 
>> MAJOR, DURING THE RALLY DID 
I HEAR CORRECTLY, DID THE 
PRESIDENT SAY ATONE POINT THAT 
YOU NEEDED AN ID TO BUY 
GROCERIES? 
I THINK THAT COMMENT HAD A LOT 
OF FOLKS SCRATCHING THEIR 
HEADS, BUT THE BROADER POINT 
THE PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO 
MAKE THERE WAS HE WAS CALLING 
FOR VOTER ID. 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, VOTER ID 
EXISTS THERE IN THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA. 
>> Reporter:  YES. 
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
WHERE THE PRESIDENT KNOWS IT'S 
A POPULAR IDEA AND CONCEPT 100 
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND HE'S 
LESS -- CONCEPT WITH 
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS AND HE'S 
LESS CONCERNED WITH DO YOU NEED 
AN ID TO BUY GROCERIES OR IS 
THAT ALREADY THE LAW IN 
FLORIDA? 
NO. 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LARGER 
CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE ISSUED AND 
THE PRESIDENT SPRINKLED THOSE 
THROUGH HIS REMARKS AND IF I 
COULD, I'D WANT TO SAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS RALLY. 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE 
BEEN ON THE ROAD WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND I THINK THERE MAY 
BE A TENDENCY TO SAY ALL THE 
RALLIES ARE THE SAME AND IN 
CERTAIN RESPECTS THEY ARE THE 
SAME, BIG VENUE, BIG iPOD 
SONGS, THE SAME SIGNS WITH 
GENERALLY THE SAME ENTHUSIASM. 
YOU COULD BE LULLED INTO A 
SENSE OF INTELLECTUAL OR 
POLITICAL ANALYSIS COMPLACENCY 
SAYING THESE RALLIES ARE ALL 
THE SAME, KIND OF REPETITIVE, 
NOT TRUE IN ONE IMPORTANT 
RESPECT. 
VOTERS WHO ARE WITH TRUMP NOW 
FEEL VINDICATED. 
THEY FEEL AS IF THEY WERE 
RIGHT. 
THEY FEEL AS IF THEY ARE 
REAPING THE BENEFITS OF THE 
POLITICAL CHOICE THEY MADE IN 
2016 AND I DETECT AT LEAST AT 
THIS RALLY NOT ONLY A SENSE OF 
THAT VINDICATION, BUT IF 
POSSIBLE, A DEEPER SENSE OF 
ATTACHMENT TO THIS MOVEMENT, 
THIS CAUSE, THIS POLITICAL 
CONSTRUCT THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS 
PLACED BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY AND NOT INCIDENTALLY 
BEFORE THE COUNTRY. 
úSO I THINK 
THERE IS A SECOND STAGE TO THE 
TRUMP PHENOMENON AND IT'S 
PLAYING OUT AMONG TRUMP 
SUPPORTERS. 
ITS EFFECT ON THE 
DESANTIS/PUTNAM RACE IN FLORIDA 
IS ALREADY VISIBLE. 
THE VERY IMPORTANT TEST -- AND 
WE HAVE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND 
ABOUT HOW THIS TEST WILL PLAY 
OUT IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS -- 
IS CAN THAT EFFECT HAVE ANY 
RESONANCE OUTSIDE A REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY CONTEST? 
CAN IT TRANSLATE IN 
CONGRESSIONAL AND SENATE RACES 
IN A MIDTERM ELECTION? 
AND IF IT DOES, THEN YOU HAVE A 
GENUINELY CYCLE TO CYCLE 
POLITICAL PHENOMENON GOING ON. 
I'M NOT PREDICTING THAT, BUT 
FOR LOTS OF UNDERSTANDABLE AND 
QUITE OBVIOUS REASONS BASED ON 
WHAT WE SAW IN 2016 I'M 
CAUTIOUS ABOUT SUGGESTING IT 
CAN'T HAPPEN. 
>> MAJOR GARRETT, ALWAYS 
TERRIFIC TO HAVE YOUR ASTUTE 
OBSERVATIONS, INSIGHT AND 
ANALYSIS. 
THANKS SO MUCH, MAJOR. 
>> Reporter:  THANK YOU, 
ELAINE. 
>>> WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE OF 
THE DAY'S NEWS. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
