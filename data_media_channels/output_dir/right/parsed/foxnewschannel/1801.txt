>>> PULLING OUT OF THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL WILL MAKE IT HARDER
TO NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH
NORTH KOREA OR ANYONE ELSE.
IT WOULD BE MUCH HARDER A SECOND
TIME.
NOW THAT OUR CREDIBILITY IS
SHOT.
>> HILLARY CLINTON NOW TAKING
HER CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
OVERSEAS.
BUT AS THE NEXT GUEST LAYS OUT,
THAT'S NOT ALL SHE'S BEEN UP TO.
JAMES FREEMAN, THE ASSISTANT
EDITOR OF "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL."
YOU BHAIS CLI SAID
YOU BASIS CLI SAID
YOU BASIC CLI SAID
YOU BASICALLI SAID
YOU BASICALLY SAID IN THE PEACE
SHE
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S A
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S G
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S O
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S A
THE PIECEDOMESTICALLY BUT IT'S L
GRIEVANCE.
>> THIS WEEK WAS IN AUSTRALIA,
EARLIER IN INDIA.
AND I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS
HAVE TO BE SCRATCHING THEIR
HEADS BECAUSE THERE WAS A
GENERAL RECOGNITION ABOUT THE
MISTAKES OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN
IN 2016.
GEE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE SPENT
MORE TIME IN THE MIDWEST, MAYBE
SHOULDN'T HAVE INSULTED A LOT OF
PEOPLE IN MIDDLE AMERICA, SHOULD
HAVE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR
CONCERNS.
>> BUT SHE STILL SEEMS TO BE
INSULTING PEOPLE, TRUMP
SUPPORTERS.
IT WAS DEPLORABLES DURING THE
CAMPAIGN.
SHE'S NOT USING THAT WORD BUT
BASICALLY SAYING THE SAME THING.
>> THE INDIA SPEECH, IT WAS VERY
MUCH A DEPLORABLE SPEECH,
BLAMING RACISM, KNOCKING PEOPLE
WHO WERE IN THE ECONOMICALLY
DEPRESSED AREAS AS NOT BEING HER
VOTERS.
HER VOTERS WERE IN THE PLACE
WHERE IT WAS RICH AND
SUCCESSFUL.
NOW IT'S COME AROUND AND IT'S
MORE OF AN ATTACK ON THE
PRESIDENT FROM OVERSEAS, SAYING
THAT THE U.S. CREDIBILITY IS
SHOT BY HIS DECIDING TO LEAVE
THE IRAN DEAL.
I DON'T KNOW HOW GOING OVERSEAS
TO MAKE THESE COMMENTS TO A VERY
WELL-HEALDZ AUDIENCE AS USUAL
WITH HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO
APPEAL BACK HERE.
>> MAYBE THEY'LL SELL THE BOOK
OVERSEAS.
BUT THERE USED TO BE A TRADITION
IN THIS COUNTRY AND I KNOW THIS
PRESIDENT HAS UPENDED A LOT OF
TRADITIONS TO BE FAIR AND CLEAR.
BUT THERE WAS A LONG STANDING
TRADITION OF PARTISAN STOPS AT
THE WATER'S EDGE.
>> THAT
>> THIT
>> THIS IS A DELICATE MOMENT IN
DIPLOMACY WITH NORTH KOREA.
PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK A LOT
IS GOING TO COME OF IT.
BUT THIS IS A BIG MOMENT WHERE
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO MAKE
A MAJOR AGREEMENT TO MAKE THE
WORLD A SAFER PLACE.
YEAH, I THINK I A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD SAY WHAT IS THE STRATEGY
HERE TO KNOCK IT FROM OVERSEAS
AND TO SUGGEST IF SHE DOES,
AMERICA CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
>> HE NEGOTIATED THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL WHICH HASN'T
EXACTLY WORKED OUT AND SHE'S
CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT'S
APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA.
WHEN THE CLINTON AND OBAMA
ADMINISTRATIONS HAD THEIR SHOT
AND THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE AND
WORSE.
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE AT
LEAST MOVING TOWARDS PEACE NOW?
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT -- I DON'T PUT
A LOT OF FAITH IN THIS
DICTATORSHIP TO COME AROUND.
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
THIS BEFORE.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT HISTORY,
IT SHOULD -- YOU WOULD THINK
PERHAPS GIVE HER A SENSE OF
HUMILITY, GIVEN THE FACT THAT
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN SHE
WAS THERE, THINGS DIDN'T WORK
OUT.
>> AND HER HUSBAND'S
ADMINISTRATION.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
AND ON THE IRAN DEAL, SHE DIDN'T
CLOSE IT BUT SHE CERTAINLY SET
THE TABLE FOR THAT AGREEMENT
WHILE SHE WAS IN OFFICE.
AND YEAH, PERHAPS NOT A
DISINTERESTED OBSERVER.
