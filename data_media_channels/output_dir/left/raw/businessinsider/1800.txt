<font color="#E5E5E5">to be great for you forever or at least</font>

35

the romance this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call limerence</font>

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
those six months to two years when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">person is perfect you need to have that</font>

39
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,040
that is an important part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,750
development of relationship because over

41
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,650
the years you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be looking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">back and trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get glimpses of that</font>

43
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,090
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so enjoy it and and don't</font>

44
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,710
judge things too quickly just sort of

45
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,540
take your time and trust that the

46
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,090
reality of the situation will become

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">clear and be honest with yourself about</font>

48
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,829
who this person is so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,140
trick to kind of not judge things enjoy

them have fun don't take them too

51
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,100
seriously and then over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you'll see</font>

52
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,299
whether this is somebody that you really

53
