a theist takes so many things on faith they believe that everything came from nothing well that's you can't prove that scientifically everybody's got to serve somebody and so the environmentalists have the original sin of pollution and they have the sacrament of the sell indulgences in the form of those carbon tax credits don't they they're in certain versions of intersectionality there's the original sin of privilege there is there's actually the Gnostic metaphysics of transgenderism I am I appear to be a man but the flesh is evil and really metaphysically I'm a woman you see all of these sorts of things crop up all of the time atheists they pull away when you say that their religion is a faith how can we convince them of this point well if 8th is just believing something that you can't mathematically prove that's what faith is and fate and atheist take so many things on faith they believe that everything came from nothing well that's you can't prove that scientifically they believe that this thing this amazing universe of ours of incomparable beauty harmony and order came about by itself that's that's faith they're trapped into this whole materialist worldview or everything has to do with atoms and molecules you know all our hopes and dreams and desires or our art and culture and history or all our deepest desire for everything that's good and beautiful and true all that to them is just the due to the random movement of molecules that's not that's not science that's faith what's more that's an irrational faith that's the basis for all superstition so they have a faith they must be called out on this point because this faith that they have it has been risk but is it been responsible for more bloodshed and carnage then any system of beliefs the world has ever known and and really in service of the faith there I've always liked the definition that faith is the the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things unseen and how better to describe the utopian political goals of the left the the idea that yeah you've got to crack some eggs to make an omelet we're just going to kill a few more million people but then we'll have world peace then we'll have prosperity then we'll have equality or tolerance or whatever you say about this
