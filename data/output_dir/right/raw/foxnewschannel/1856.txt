ON FOOD STAMPS.

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,428
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO TAKE IT

3
00:00:07,428 --> 00:00:07,728
DOWN.

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:10,531
MIKE TELLS US WHERE THINGS

5
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:10,831
STAND.

6
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,802
>> THE HOUSE WILL DEBATE A 5

STAMPS.

10
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,011
>> WE LOVE OUR FARMERS.

11
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,314

00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,670
3.9% IN 2000 THERE WERE 17

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,272
MILLION PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS.

19
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,374
TODAY THERE ARE 41 MILLION

20
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:54,975
PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM.

21
00:00:54,975 --> 00:00:57,678
DEMOCRATS CALL THIS THE MOST

22
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:00,114
PARTISAN FARM BILL IN 20 YEARS

23
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:01,415

PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER

31
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:06,620
PROGRAM WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER.

32
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,324
>> LET'S COME TO THE TABLE AND

00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:18,599
PROGRAM TO FIGHT HUNGER.

36
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,668
>> WITH TOUGHER WORK

00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,670
REQUIREMENT, GOP LEADERS SAY THE

38
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,572
VAST MAJORITY OF THE DEMOCRATS

39
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:26,574
IN THE HOUSE WILL VOTE NO.

40
00:01:26,574 --> 00:01:28,776
>> THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY WE

41
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,978
CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL.

42
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:32,880
>> ANOTHER SENSITIVE SUBJECT IS

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,219
THE SUGAR PROGRAM WITH IMPORT

44
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,153
RESTRICTIONS AND FLOOR PRICE

45
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:41,422
THAT RESULTS IN MORE EXPENSIVE

46
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:41,722
SUGAR.

47
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,858
>> THE SUGAR PROGRAM NEEDS

48
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:44,291
REFORMING.

49
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,393
WHAT I AM MOST INTERESTED IS IN

50
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:48,295
IS GETTING A FARM BILL PASSED

51
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:48,762
INTO LAW.

52
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:50,731
>> THAT'S A REFERENCE TO THE

53
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,834
CONCERN THAT A SUGAR AMENDMENT

54
00:01:53,834 --> 00:00:00,000
COULD BE A POISON PILL.
