Shelter Island,
an 8,000 acre island
wedged between Long Island's
north, and south forks,
that can only be reached
by boat or private plane.
Draws a money crowd in search
of the more laid back vibe.
Kevin Roberts, and
his husband Timothy Haynes own
two antique homes on Gardener's
Creek in Shelter Island.
He bought his first home,
Creek Cottage, in 2014 for
1.25 million.
The cottage is set within
the gates of Sylvester Manor,
a 243 acre non-profit
educational farm,
with a 1737 Georgian
manor house.
Shortly after he bought
the cottage, Mr.
Roberts learned that
the 19th century farmhouse
opposite the creek, called
The Homestead, was for sale.
He paid 1.6 million for
the homestead and
has stabilized the original
1754 portion of the house.
Bill Persky built a water front
home on Shelter Island's
West Net Bay 20 years ago.
Mr. Persky and

They discovered a trove of
artifacts on the property.

In the tiny village of Dearing
Harbor, Patrick Parcells,
who ran an unsuccessful
2014 campaign for mayor,
is selling his 5,000 square
foot home for $5.675 million.
The home and its 7.6 acres
are part of a 19 acre property
that Mr. Parcells purchased for
2 million in 2001.
Mr. Parcells, who was reserving
a three acre parcel there for
a smaller home,
said his political opponents
are still good neighbors.
As he says, we play golf.
We don't agree about everything
but we're able to get along.
