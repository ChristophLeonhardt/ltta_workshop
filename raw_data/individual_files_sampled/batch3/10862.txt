brand new report by online new site the intercept sheds light on the alleged collaboration between American telecom giant AT&T and the US spy agency the NSA which enabled mass snooping on private emails and telephone calls apparently eight of the phone company's buildings across major US cities are being used by the NSA for its surveillance activities according to the report the agency collects a large amount of AT&T customer traffic with the data being trolled every day as evidence for the alleged collaboration it presents classified NSA documents public records and even interviews with a DNC staff well another intercept report about the alleged collaboration was released in 2016 this concern the Titan Point building the skyscraper with heavily restricted access that's able to withstand an atomic blast it's in a TNC facility but was reportedly used as one of the main centers of the NSA's surveillance program and former NSA technical director and now whistleblower William Benny things that are such spying does in fact violate the law the agency can neither confirm nor deny its role in alleged classified intelligence activities what AT&T calls peering sites the eight-eight peering sites inside the United States at AT&T has those are peering sites there were the sites where they have the multi networks come together and they they put together you know border gate protocols between one another so they can transfer data between each network and the real issue is the other 80 some tapping points that they didn't talk about and those are the ones that are actually targeting the United States citizens and you know that's the violation of the constitutional rights of every citizen in the United States and they've been doing that since 2001 and they aren't even addressing that European law for example the the EU clearly says that the data that any third party holds belongs to the person involved if they want to share that with anybody they have to get the permission of that person so they've been violating European laws so they need a class-action lawsuit in Europe against the AT&T and any of the companies it's it's easier to shoot sue them and more pertinent to do it that way rather than you know try to sue the US government because they'll drag it out in international court for years you
