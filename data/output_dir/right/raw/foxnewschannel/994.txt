1
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:03,763
2,000 HOMES HAVE BEEN EVACUATED

2
00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:05,631
BECAUSE OF A FOREST FIRE THAT

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,134
HAS BURNED 30 SQUARE MILES SO

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:08,401
FAR.

5
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:10,202
SO A HANDSHAKE SEEN AROUND THE

6
00:00:10,202 --> 00:00:11,470
WORLD AS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,472
JONG-UN MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME.

8
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,807
SURPRISINGLY, EVEN THE PEOPLE OF

9
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,075
NORTH KOREA KNEW KIM WAS IN

10
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:17,810
SINGAPORE FOR THE SUMMIT WITH

11
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:22,148
THE COUNTRY'S MAIN NEWSPAPER

12
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,718
OFFERING STATE-DIRECTED

13
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:26,452
COVERAGE.

14
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:30,923
JOINING ME RIGHT NOW, BRIAN

15
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:33,292
McKEON.

16
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:36,128
LET ME START WITH YOU.

17
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,064
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A

18
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:40,499
GENERAL FEELING THAT THE SUMMIT

19
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:41,567
DECLARATION IS LESS THAN

20
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,536
EXPECTED BUT IS IT A STEP IN THE

21
00:00:43,536 --> 00:00:45,304
RIGHT DIRECTION?

22
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:47,607
>> CERTAINLY THE MEETING IS AN

23
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:48,674
IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT

24
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,743
DIRECTION AND NOW WE BEGIN A

25
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:51,911
PROCESS OF NEGOTIATION.

26
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:53,613
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THAT.

27
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:54,780
I THINK THE STATEMENT WAS A

28
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,716
LITTLE LIGHT ON SUBSTANCE.

29
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,251
REMINDS ME OF THE PEGGY LEE SONG

30
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,987
"IS THAT ALL THERE IS?"

31
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,122
A LOT LESS DETAIL THAT HAVE BEEN

32
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:04,857
IN PRIOR STATEMENTS OF THIS

33
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,157
KIND.

34
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:05,891
>> Dana: IS THAT BECAUSE THE

35
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,127
PRESIDENT ENVISIONS -- HE SAID

36
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,028
EXPECTATIONS TO SAY, THIS IS

37
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,696
PROBABLY THE FIRST OF WHAT WILL

38
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,698
BE MANY MEETINGS THE COME?

39
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,867
>> YEAH, A LOT OF THE HARD WORK

40
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,068
REMAINS, DANA.

41
00:01:16,068 --> 00:01:18,337
WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THIS

42
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:18,938
IMPORTANT FACT.

43
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:21,307
THE FIRST TIME IN THE 65 SOME

44
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:22,375
ODD YEARS SINCE THE END OF

45
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:32,852
THE -- THE CESSATION OF

46
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:33,219
CONFLICT.

47
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,122
THERE'S AN IMAGERY AND POMP AND

48
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:36,856
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT GOES JUST

49
00:01:36,856 --> 00:01:38,090
BEYOND THIS MEETING AND GOES TO

50
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,393
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LENGTHY

51
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,962
PROCESS AHEAD AND IT'S IMPORTANT

52
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:46,832
TO BEAR THAT IN MIND.

53
00:01:46,832 --> 00:01:47,566
>> Dana: AND I DO THINK OF THE

54
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:50,469
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

55
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:51,904
FEATURES COLOR PHOTOS OF KIM

56
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,372
JONG-UN WALKING AROUND

57
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:55,875
SINGAPORE, A BREATHTAKING CITY

58
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,345
WITH AN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY THAT

59
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,746
NORTH KOREANS CAN ONLY DREAM

60
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,113
ABOUT.

61
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:02,314
I CAN'T BELIEVE NORTH KOREA

62
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,283
REPORTED THIS SO QUICKLY.

63
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:05,918
USUALLY THEY TAKE DAYS TO REPORT

64
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,218
NEWS.

65
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:07,319
HERE THEY TOOK HOURS.

66
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,689
BASED ON YOUR EXPERTISE OF THE

67
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,190
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL, WHAT

68
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,692
DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT

69
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:13,059
INDICATE?

70
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,360
>> IT INDICATES THAT KIM JONG-UN

71
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,329
IS FEELING CONFIDENT IN HIS

72
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,798
POSITION AND STEPPING FORWARD

73
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:20,633
AND HAVING TO INITIAL

74
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:21,400
NEGOTIATIONS WITH PRESIDENT

75
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,767
TRUMP.

76
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,470
HE CERTAINLY WILL TAKE A VICTORY

77
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,072
LAP AT HOME TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE

78
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:27,206
THAT HE'S ADVANCING THEIR

79
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,841
SECURITY INTERESTING AND HE'S ON

80
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:30,710
THE WORLD STAGE AT A LEVEL WITH

81
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,945
THE LEADING COUNTRY IN THE

82
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,245
WORLD.

83
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,781
>> Dana: THERE'S OTHER NEWS WITH

84
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,916
THE TRADE SUMMIT THAT THE

85
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,317
PRESIDENT JUST CAME OUT OF WITH

86
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,852
THE G-7 SUMMIT.

87
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,421
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN HIS

88
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,223
PRESS CONFERENCE THIS MORNING.

89
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:45,024
TAKE A LISTEN.

90
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:47,259
>> THE PICTURE WITH ANGELA

91
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,929
MERKEL, THAT I GET ALONG WITH

92
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:51,764
VERY WELL, THAT PICTURE IS WE'RE

93
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:52,965
WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENT BECAUSE

94
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,266
I WANTED TO SEE THE FINAL

95
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,068
DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY THE

96
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:57,870
CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED.

97
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,637
VERY FRIENDLY.

98
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,939
DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY.

99
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,341
IT WAS REPORTED LIKE NASTY BOTH

100
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:02,641
WAYS.

101
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,343
I WAS ANGRY AT HER.

102
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,479
ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST TALKING

103
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,247
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING

104
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:09,515
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING.

105
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:11,684
VERY FRIENDLY WAITING FOR THE

106
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:13,419
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I COULD

107
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,920
READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE.

108
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,557
>> Dana: I HAD SOME SYMPATHY FOR

109
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:19,992
THE PRESIDENT, SOMEONE LIKE

110
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,160
LOOKED AT A PHOTOGRAPH AND SAY

111
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,495
THAT'S NOT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT

112
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,129
HAS HAPPENED THERE.

113
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,798
DO YOU THINK THAT TENSIONS

114
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:28,200
AMONGST THE G-7 ARE NOT AS

115
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,769
DIFFICULT AS THE MEDIA HAS BEEN

116
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,369
REPORT SOMETHING.

117
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,705
>> YEAH, LOOK, IT'S VERY EASY

118
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,206
FOR FOLKS ON THE OUTSIDE TO

119
00:03:34,206 --> 00:03:37,042
CRAFT A NARRATIVE AROUND THIS.

120
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,211
OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE SOME HURT

121
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,579
FEELINGS, SOME BACK AND FORTH

122
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:41,947
MAYBE BEFORE AND DURING THE

123
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:42,281
SUMMIT.

124
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,517
THE REALITY IS, ONLY THE FOLKS

125
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:45,751
IN THAT ROOM REALLY UNDERSTAND

126
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,086
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

127
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,989
THE DYNAMIC IS VERY COMPLICATED

128
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:50,523
RIGHT NOW.

129
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:52,158
THE UNITED STATES IS IN

130
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:53,325
UNCHARTERED TERRITORY WHEN WE

131
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:55,094
THINK ABOUT OUR TRADING

132
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,662
RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPANIES AS

133
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:58,330
WELL AS THE FACT AS THE

134
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,632
PRESIDENT REACHING OUT TO KIM

135
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,734
JONG-UN IN A HISTORIC MOMENT.

136
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:03,502
THE STATUS QUO HAS BEEN TURNED

137
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,303
UPSIDE-DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

138
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:08,073
IT'S PREMATURE FOR US TO DRAW

139
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:18,951
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT FREYING

140
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,386
ALLIANCES WITH EUROPE.

141
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,220
>> Dana: AND THE PRESIDENT

142
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,855
WANTED TO DEAL WITH NATO AND

143
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,323
THERE'S STARTING TO BE MOVEMENT

144
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:25,257
IN EUROPE.

145
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:28,027
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT SO MORE

146
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:31,096
AFTER THIS G-7 SUMMIT TO TRY TO

147
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,464
COUPLE TO THE TABLE WITH

148
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:33,365
SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY CAN SAY

149
00:04:33,365 --> 00:04:36,735
THEY GAVE AND THEY WON A LITTLE

150
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,905
BIT?

151
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:41,407
THE ALLIANCE AND WITHIN OUR

152
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,609
CLOSE PARTNERS BECAUSE OF THE

153
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,077
PRESIDENT'S MOVE ON THE IRAN

154
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,812
DEAL AND THE PARIS CLIMATE

155
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:49,882
AGREEMENT AND WHAT HE'S DONE ON

156
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,182
TRADE.

157
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,084
YOU CAN'T REALLY -- SURE, WE

158
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,853
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT

159
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:55,721
ROOM AND THAT PICTURE, WHAT IT'S

160
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,021
ABOUT.

161
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:58,991
WE KNOW THERE'S REAL TENSIONS

162
00:04:58,991 --> 00:04:59,792
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND

163
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,360
ITS ALLIES.

164
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,828
COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ARE STEPPING

165
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:04,763
UP WITH INCREASED DEFENSE

166
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,130
SPENDING.

167
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,333
THEY DID THAT AFTER THE RUSSIANS

168
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,568
WENT TO CRIMEA AND THE EASTERN

169
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:09,902
UKRAINE.

170
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:12,137
THAT HAS CONTINUED AND IT'S A

171
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,606
GOOD THING.

172
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,374
>> Dana: LAST WORD TO YOU, LANNY

173
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,476
ON THIS TRADE ISSUE, ESPECIALLY

174
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,912
WITH THE NAFTA DEAL NOT SETTLED

175
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:20,246
EITHER.

176
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:20,613
>> RIGHT.

177
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,214
THAT IS A BIG CONCERN.

178
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:24,583
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN

179
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:25,985
ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT.

180
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,887
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO

181
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:28,988
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH CANADA

182
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,256
AND MEXICO.

183
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,690
THAT IS DIFFICULT, PARTICULARLY

184
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,592
WHEN WE'VE BEEN OPERATING ON THE

185
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,195
NAFTA REGIME FOR TWO DECADES.

186
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:37,162
HOPEFULLY THEY CAN REACH AN

187
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,597
AGREEMENT AND HOPEFULLY MOVE THE

188
00:05:38,597 --> 00:00:00,000
BALL FORWARD.
