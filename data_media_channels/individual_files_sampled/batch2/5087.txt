let's bring in another lawmaker who was in the room for yesterday's White House meeting on gun policy member of the Armed Services Committee democratic congresswoman Stephanie Murphy of Florida congressman it's good to have you on this morning were you surprised I'll put the same question to you as I just put - senator Toomey by some of the ideas that a Republican president Donald Trump who's taken a good deal 30 million dollars or so of money from the NRA over the course of his campaign some of the proposals he put out that sounded to an awful lot of people like a gun control agenda you know I was really heartened by what the president said and some of the commitments that he made to see this through to the end I represent a district in Central Florida that was deeply affected by polls and I will tell you that my constituents in Florida want to see us take action and you know this might be Nixon goes to China moment for Trump he might be the only president who can help us advance some common-sense gun safety measures because as senator Toomey said nobody believes he's trying to take away everybody's guns congresswoman heidi priscilla has a question for you hi congresswoman you say you're heartened by what you saw yesterday but 2013 was not that long ago and what we saw was this congress resistant to make even minor changes and you just saw senator Toomey as well say we'll do it if we can so clearly even though strong words yesterday not enough to get embattled warriors like to me just commit to bringing these things to the floor so what more do you need from this president beyond the statements that we saw yesterday you know I think we're living in a different moment than 2013 when you see corporations putting people over their profits it's well past time that elected officials put people over their politics and so out of the president I think he needs to live in to some of the commitments that he talked about yesterday which was and he needs to do that by encouraging and pressuring the republican-led Congress to allow some of these votes to come to the floor and you know it would be helpful for him to help whip some of those votes congressman I don't think most people know your backstory which is you mentioned it briefly the pulse shooting nightclub which is the you are a businesswoman business consultant who witnessed what happened in Orlando there in your district had no previous experience in politics and got into the race and won pushing the issue of guns you have a specific concern that you brought to the attention of the president United States and that is the Dickey amendment a term most people probably aren't familiar with what is it and why do you believe it ought to be changed right Willie you're right what I did was after the pulse nightclub shooting I was frustrated by the inaction of our elected leaders so I got into a race and I ran a 4-month campaign and unseated a 24-year Republican incumbent who had taken a check from the NRA two days after the pulse nightclub shooting and so I care deeply about this issue and I've put forward a bill called the gun violence research act it repeals the Dickey amendment allows the CDC and other federal agencies to research gun violence this is a public health crisis and we need the facts and the research and the data to cut through the polarized and ideological conversations that we're having about gun violence so that we can actually get to real common-sense solutions for the American people all right congresswoman Stephanie Murphy of Florida obviously knowledgeable and passionate on this issue we appreciate your time this morning we'll talk to you again thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
