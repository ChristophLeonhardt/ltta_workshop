now Congress is looking into renewing FISA this is basically the warrantless wiretapping they're doing pretty much all Americans unfortunately a bipartisan agreement on it the only person who can't come to agreement is Donald Trump well he can't come to an agreement with himself on it he was wildly contradictory in a span of a couple of hours so let me explain the hill says the White House is called for the program to be reauthorized but the president lashed out at the program early Thursday so 12 hours before the president tweets the White House puts out a statement saying this FISA renewal is wonderful the warrantless wiretapping of Americans is such a great thing but Trump then turns around and contradicts his own white house and says House votes are controversial FISA Act today this is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredit and phony dossier to so badly surveil an abusive Trump campaign by the previous administration and others now you'll see where he got that from in just a little bit but he's clearly against it I'm so bad he used to surveil Trump campaign is terrible it's early in the morning the staff goes in and goes dear president moron your position is that this is a good thing can you please fix your idiotic tweet that says it's a bad thing he's like that so then he tweets a couple hours later with that being said well I personally directed the fix to the unmasking process says take the office and today's vote is about four surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land we need to get smart I love that last part where he yells pretty much at himself get smart so you could have used that a couple hours ago when you tweeted the opposite it's like when I play basketball and sometimes they get frustrated that I'm not doing enough and I'll have missed the rebound and going down the court I'll be like let's get some rebounds that's Trump everyday looks at himself going get smart get smart in fact we found a video of him after the staff explained that he had tweeted the wrong yet again here it is buckets idiot fake news anyway with such a great performance anyway so they asked John Kelly the White House chief of staff CNN reported catches up to him and says well did Donald Trump put you in a difficult position again where he had to correct them and explain to him what his actual position is I loved this quote he said it's not more difficult it's a juggling act it's what I got to deal with every single day it's a juggling act we're at a circus and he's the ringleader when Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it she had this hilarious quote we were confused but some of you guys were in other words I know that she doesn't intend this I assume she subconsciously things we weren't confused the president's an idiot we knew that all along we work with him every day you guys are confused expecting him to make any sense at all so where did he get this confusion from in the first place well actually before we get to that let me show you even Fox News Bret Baier I mean Fox News is the home of Donald Trump they defend them at every turn but their lead anchor Bret Baier about the news scratching his head like oh Jesus Lord and mercy how am I going to defend this guy now all right let's watch what's going on here Bret well it's kind of a mess from the administration point of view Adam Schiff is is jumping on what were conflicting tweets from the president this morning about whether they should move forward with this authorization but today the president tweeted out a question whether it should go forward and maybe it's not a good deal then he tweeted a second time and said no we need to pass this get smart so it was conflicting called it a clean-up on aisle 702 and there was some pulling of hair out in the Intel community and on the House floor as House members are really trying to get this across the finish line even Fox is like a mess it was a conflicting the reference to 702 is the section 702 that they were debating but it was trumpets clean-up on aisle one and two and three and just never mind clean up the whole goddamn thing all right so where do you get the idea in the first place ironically Fox News from Judge Napolitano he saw this segment in the morning before he tweeted the angry tweet that got him in trouble watch that I'm scratching my head I don't understand why Donald Trump is in favor of this his woes began with unlawful foreign surveillance and unconstitutional domestic surveillance of him before he was the president the United States and now he wants to institutionalize this mr. president this is not the way to go so Trump sees that he said Oh Fox told me that's not the way to go this is the surveillance of me I'm against it by the way to give credit to Judge Napolitano he's right this is a terrible bill Trump shouldn't have been in favor of it and I certainly did Democrats shouldn't have been in favor of it and 65 of them voted for it in the house let alone nearly two hundred Republicans it eviscerates the Fourth Amendment it's a terrible idea and and Trump accidentally had it right the first time but realizing his mistake that he was right for the first time in his life was like wait I gotta fix that I'm now going to read tweet saying that never mind I'd like to go back to being wrong and he has and by the way they passed it easily so there goes your rights if you become a member of the Young Turks you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person so do it right now TYT Network comm /join get the whole younger so every day
