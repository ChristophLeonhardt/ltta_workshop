MEET THE REAL CULTIST. THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. YOU HAVE TO HAND IT TO THE ANTI-TRUMP RESISTANCE. THEY'VE TRIED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO STOP DONALD TRUMP. WELL, DURING THE CAMPAIGN, THE CHATTER AND CLASSES AT VARIOUS TIMES CALLED HIM A RACIST, HE WAS A MISOGYNIST, HE WAS STUPID, A FRAUD IN BUSINESS, HE WASN'T AS WELL READ AS THE OTHER CANDIDATES. HE ALSO DIDN'T PLAY NICE IN THE SANDBOX. HE WAS BRASH, BOORISH, AND AN EGO EG EGOMANIAC. AND NOW AFTER THIS IG REPORT, WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE AGENTS BY DAY AND ACTIVISTS BY NIGHT, WHO WERE WORKING ON AN INSURANCE POLICY TO STOP TRUMP FROM WINNING THE PRESIDENCY. AND THEN WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK, FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JIM COMEY LEAKED HIS NOTES TO A PAL WHO IN TURN LEAKED THEM TO THE PRESS, ALL TO TRIGGER THE APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER ON THAT BOGUS RUSSIA COLLUSION THEORY. AND NOW MORE THAN A YEAR AND $17 MILLION LATER, WHILE THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S APPROVAL NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HAVE GONE UP, THE ECONOMY IS SOARING. AND OF COURSE TRUMP IS ENFORCING OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT. WAGES HAVE GONE UP, UNEMPLOYMENT HAS GONE DOWN. SO NOW THE TRUMP RESISTANCE HAVE GOT TO TRY SOMETHING NEW. IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR ANY PARTY TO END UP WITH A CULT-LIKE SITUATION AS IT RELATES TO A PRESIDENT. HE'S DEVOLVED INTO A CULT. YOU CAN HAVE THE LAST WORD. DONALD TRUMP IS ACCUSED OF LEADING A CULT. SO CULT IS FAIR TO YOU? I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS HEADED THAT WAY. I THINK CULT IS A VERY STRONG BUT A VERY GOOD WORD IN THIS CASE. OBAMA CALLED US BITTER CRINGE CLINGERS. AN AGENT OF THE FBI USE LESS AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE. THIS IS HOW AN AGENT DESCRIBED TRUMP VOTERS THE DAY AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION. TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE ALL POOR TO MIDDLE CLASS UNEDUCATED POS THAT THINK HE WILL MAGICALLY GRANT THEM JOBS FOR DOING NOTHING. THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T WATCH THE DEBATES, AREN'T EDUCATED ON HIS POLICIES AND ARE STUPIDLY WRAPPED UP IN HIS UNMERITED ENTHUSIASM. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP ISN'T PERFECT. NONE OF US ARE. BUT MORE AMERICANS ARE SEEING THAT HIS NEW APPROACHES TO GOVERNANCE ARE PAYING OFF. AND THEY'RE SEEING PAST THE CONSTANT SNIPING AND CRITICISM AND THEY'RE RECOGNIZING THAT THROUGH IT ALL, TRUMP HAS FOCUSED ON MAKING LIFE BETTER, SAFER, MORE PROSPEROUS FOR THE TRUE PEOPLE. THAT'S NOT CULTISH. IT'S COMMON SENSE. THE CLOSEST THING WE'VE SEEN TO A CULT IS THE CULT OF OBAMA. WHO CAN FORGET THESE GEMS? YOU HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A ROCKSTAR IN POLITICS. THE FEELING MOST PEOPLE GET WHEN THEY HERE OBAMA. ALL THE HONORS THAT HAVE COME YOUR WAY, ALL THE PUBLICITY, WHO DOES IT MAKE YOU THINK OF? IS THERE A LOVED ONE? HE'S PERSONABLE. HE'S HANDSOME. I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A PRESIDENT, SAVE LINCOLN, WHO IS AS GREAT A SPEECH WRITER AT THIS MAN. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FIRST FAMILY IS HISTORIC. YOU'RE A BETTER MAN THAN ME, SIR. YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT US AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I COULD WATCH THAT ALL NIGHT LONG. WE HAD SO MANY CLIPS, BY THE WAY, WE COULDN'T EVEN FIT THEM IN THE ANGLE. SO MAYBE WE'LL DO A SPECIAL SHOW JUST TO REVIEW ALL THE FAWNING OVER OBAMA. THE CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO NAME MY GREATEST STRENGTHS? I GUESS IT WOULD BE MY HUMILITY. GREATEST WEAKNESS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I'M A LITTLE TOO AWESOME. I... SO IN LOVE WITH YOU. AND ALTHOUGH OBAMA LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, HIS CULT MEMBERS HAVEN'T LEFT THE COMMUNE. YEP, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IS WAITING. OBAMA'S SAYS DEMOCRATS SHOULD TALKING ABOUT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES. AND HE WAS GRACIOUS AND HE'S HELPING US RAISE SOME MONEY. DO THEY HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO TURN TO? NO ONE? DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT TRUMP'S ECONOMIC NATIONALISM, HIS CONSERVATIVE MORE POPULOUS PHILOSOPHY WON'T OUTLAST HIS PRESIDENCY. IT CERTAINLY WILL. UNACCOUNTABLE TRADE DEALS, LACKS BORDERS. THOSE DAYS, MY FRIENDS, ARE OVER. SO LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL, UNTIL THE DEMOCRATS AND THE BITTER BUSHEES COME UP WITH SOME
