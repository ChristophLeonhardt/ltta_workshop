you know there's one thing I want to say just just at the top here that's I in the past have been critical of Trump's some of trumps rhetoric about the media I've found that some of it has been a bit overblown even dangerous at times and although I agree in general with his criticisms of the media I agree with anyone's criticisms in general of the left-wing media but I you know I thought that some of it was overblown however these last few weeks with the Cavanaugh story have I think vindicated everything that Trump has ever said about the media he's exactly right in fact actually he could probably go even further in his criticisms than he has gone when you see what the media's done here they have with this Cavanaugh story and of course it's not the first time they've done this but it's just been so striking they have completely discarded any semblance of integrity objectivity decency honesty ethics they've just gotten rid of all of that and now this is a straight-up in-your-face blatant explicit smear campaign to destroy Brett Kavanaugh because he's not pro-abortion that's what's going on with the media so just another example of that if you happen to be watching NBC or MSNBC on Monday nights I don't know why you would do that but if you did you would have seen an interview with Julie sweat Nick now Julie sweat Nick is the mentally unbalanced woman who's accused Brett Kavanaugh of engaging in systemic gang rapes and and in fact paints a portrait of their high school years where as a time when there was just gang rapes going on all the time every weekend there will be gang raped parties and all the girls would come for some reason to these gang rape parties and then they would be gang raped and but they would keep coming back and Julie sweat Nick even though she's three years older but she would come to these high school gang rape parties that she kept coming and then she was gang raped and then she kept coming back more even after that so that's our accusation and ever since she releases Acura accusations through Michael avenatti who's a just a scumbag lying attention-starved pretend lawyer ever since those accusations last week we found out that well she's there was a restraining order her her ex-boyfriend tried to get her straining order against her because he says that she threatened him and threatened his his child we find out these you know he's a she was accused by her employer of making up false sexual harassment claims and what the employer says is that she made up false this this I think is important actually according to her employer back I think it was maybe about 18 20 years ago she made up false sexual harassment claims because she had been sexually harassing a couple of men at work and when they went and told on her she made up this claim as in retaliation
