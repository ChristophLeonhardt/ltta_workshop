REAL ESTATE THAN THEY ARE BUT

I'M REALLY PROUD TO REPORT THAT
EARLIER TODAY WE SECURED THE
RELEASE OF PASTOR ANDREW BRANSON
FROM TURKEY.
HE'S NOW FREE FROM JAIL AND HE'S
IS IN THE AIR HEADING TO GERMANY
WHERE HE WILL GET OFF FOR A
BRIEF CHECK AND HEN HE'S COME
THEN HE'S COMING
TO WASHINGTON D.C. TOMORROW AND
WE WILL SAY HELLO TO HIM.
WENT THROUGH A LOT, YOU KNOW,
ALL ABOUT PASTOR BRANSON.
HE WENT THROUGH A LOT BUT HE'S
ON HIS WAY BACK.
WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH A LOT.
WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS.
NORTH CAROLINA, EGYPT.
WE BROUGHT A LOT ONLY PEOPLE
BACK AND THAT IS GOOD.
THEY WANT TO COME BACK TO OUR
COUNTRY AND THEY ARE COMING BACK
TO OUR COUNTRY.
TONIGHT EVERY AMERICAN
HEART IS WITH OUR FELLOW
CITIZENS AFFECTED BY HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
SOUNDS LIKE A VERY NICE NAME.
THAT WAS A VICIOUS HURRICANE.
WHETHER ITS IN FLORIDA OR
GEORGIA, ALABAMA, NORTH
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA, A LOT
OF AREAS AFFECTED BUT WE JUST
WANT TO GIVE EVERYBODY OUR LOVE.
THAT WAS A DEVASTATING POWER
THAT HIT.
AMONG THE MOST POWERFUL
HURRICANES TO EVER HIT OUR
COUNTRY.
IT WAS DEVASTATING BUT THEY WILL
REBUILD.
THEY ARE STRONG.
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.
JUST GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
THANK YOU.
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN IN
CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE
STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ALL
OVER THE VARIOUS STATES.
WHEN WE ARE IN TROUBLE, WE PULL
TOGETHER.
WE PULL TOGETHER LIKE NOBODY.
WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO DISCUSS
THE EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENTS
WE HAVE MADE TOGETHER IN, CAN
YOU BELIEVE IT, LESS THAN TWO
YEARS.
ITS BEEN REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP
AND WE ARE HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT OUR AMAZING PROGRESS
CONTINUES FULL SPEED AHEAD.
AMERICA IS BOOMING.
AMERICA IS THRIVING.
AND AMERICA IS WINNING REALLY
WINNING AGAIN.
AND WE ARE VIEWING NOW FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN MANY DECADES,
AMERICA FIRST AND ITS ABOUT
TIME.
ITS ABOUT TIME.
RIGHT?
ABOUT TIME.
ITS ABOUT TIME.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS JUST
FALLEN TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN
MORE THAN 50 YEARS.
MANUFACTURING CONFIDENCE JUST
ANNOUNCED HAS REACHED AN ALL
TIME HIGH.
THINK WHAT THAT MATTERS.
THINK WHAT THAT IS.
CONFIDENCE.
CONFIDENCE.
THE PEOPLE OF OHIO HAVE
CONFIDENCE.
THINK OF IT.
IF YOU REMEMBER THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SAID
MANUFACTURING JOBS -- OTHER THAN
THAT YOU LIKE THEM VERY MUCH,
RIGHT?
BUT REMEMBER THEY SAID AN --
MANUFACTURING JOBS ARE GONE,
THEY ARE DEAD.
WE ARE BRINGING THEM BACK.
I GUESS WE HAVE THE MAGIC WAND.
THEY ARE COMING BACK.
AND THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM
MEXICO.
THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM
CANADA.
THEY ARE COMING BACK FROM
EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THEY ALL WANT
TO BE WHERE THE ACTION IS.
THEY ALL WANT TO BE IN THE USA.
THAT IS WHERE WE WANT TO INTO.
THAT IS WHERE THE JOBS ARE.
WE ARE NOW HOTTEST COUNTRY
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
WAY I WISH THE CAMERAS WOULD GET
THIS CROWD.
THIS CROWD IS INCREDIBLE.
LOOK AT THE CAMERAS BACK.
THERE IT IS LIKE THE ACADEMY
AWARDS.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THIS
EVERY NIGHT?
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE TO DO
THIS EVERY NIGHT AND ONE LITTLE
MISTAKE -- ONE LITTLE MISTAKE
AND THEY TRY TO DESTROY YOUR
ENTIRE CAREER.
BOY.
LOOK AT THIS.
SERIOUSLY, LOOK AT THE MAGNITUDE
OF IT.
LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF THE MEDIA
BACK.
THERE LOOK AT THAT.
FAKE NEWS, FAKE NEWS.
FAKE.
YOU GO BACK AND THEY WILL
SAY DID HE SAY -- DID HE SAY
THIS OR THAT OR THIS?
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO LIVE WITH
THEM.
WE HAVE LEARNED HOW TO LIVE WITH
THEM.
WE DON'T LIKE IT BUT WE HAVE
LEARNED.
ALL ACROSS OHIO STEEL MILLS ARE
REOPENING AND WE ARE PUTTING OUR
COAL MINERS BACK TO WORK.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE
MOST PROUD OF -- STEEL WAS DEAD.
STEEL WAS DEAD.
I CAME INTO THE OFFICE, STEEL
WAS A DEAD BUSINESS.
NOW THEY ARE OPENING UP PLANTS,
U.S. STEEL, NEW CORE.
THEY ARE OPENING UP PLANTS ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY.
BIG ONES, NEW ONES.
WE ARE TAXING THE OUT
OF THE DUMPERS.
THE DUMPERS THAT WERE HURTING
YOUR STEEL INDUSTRY.
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS.
AFTER THE INDUSTRY DIES, WOULD
HAVE DIED WITHIN TWO YEARS,
AFTER IT DIES THEY WOULD COME IN
AND CHARGE YOU THREE TIMES MORE
MONEY.
NOBODY SAYS IT BUT THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENS.
SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
BEAUTIFUL NEW -- AMERICAN MADE
STEEL.
ITS NOT GOING TO BE MUD OR
SAND, STEEL.
THEY PUT GARBAGE IN THIS STUFF
THEY WERE DUMPING.
ITS GOING TO BE U.S. STEEL.
ITS GOING TO BE AMERICAN STEEL.
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE -- FROM
OUR MINES RIGHT BEAUTIFUL.
THEY ARE OPENING UP AGAIN.
OUR MINDS ARE OPENING UP AGAIN.
OUR MINERS ARE BACK TO WORK.
WE DON'T NEED OUT SIERDS TELLING
US ABOUT OUR STEEL INDUSTRY.
ITS INCREDIBLE.
SERIOUSLY, ITS INCREDIBLE WHAT
HAS HAPPENED.
ITS AS HOT AS A PISTOL.
AFTER YEARS OF REBUILDING
FOREIGN NATIONS, WE ARE FINALLY
REBUILDING OUR NATION WHICH IS
WHAT WE WANT.
AND THIS HAS BEEN -- GOOD
CROWD.
SO THIS HAS BAN REALLY HISTORIC
WEEK FOR AMERICA.
REALLY HISTORIC.
AND BY THE WAY, OUR MAGNIFICENT
FIRST LADY MELANIA -- JUST
RUSHED FROM AN INCREDIBLY
SUCCESSFUL TRIP TO AFRICA.
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TRIP AND
SHE CAME BACK AND SHE TOLD ME SO
BEAUTIFUL, SO BEAUTIFUL AND SUCH
INCREDIBLE IN SOME CASES
POVERTY.
THEY NEED HELP.
THEY DEFINITELY NEED HELP.
ITS BOTH BEAUTIFUL AND SAD.
IT HAS EVERY KIND OF EMOTION BUT
YOU PROBABLY SAW HER TRAVELS.
THEY WERE REALLY INCREDIBLE.
IT OPENS YOUR EYES TO WHAT IS
GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD.
YOU ARE ALL VERY LUCKY IN OHIO.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
THANK YOU.
ON MONDAY NIGHT IN THE EAST ROOM
OF THE WHITE HOUSE, WE ACHIEFED
A TREMENDOUS -- ACHIEVE ADD
TREMENDOUS VICTORY FOR OUR
NATION.
AMERICA WATCHED AS WE PROUDLY
SWORE IN THE NEWEST MEMBER OF
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH.
DID HE GET TREATED BADLY
AND UNFAIRLY OR WHAT?
HORRIBLE.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT, HE'S DONE
US A TREMENDOUS SERVICE.
THE WAY HE TREATED HIM SIDE
NEVER SEEN ANYBODY TREATED LIKE
THAT.
BUTS HE DONE US A GREAT SERVICE
BECAUSE WE ARE MORE ENERGIZED AS
REPUBLICANS THAN EVER -- I THINK
EVER BEFORE.
I THINK EVER BEFORE.
WE JUST GOT POLL NUMBERS
FOR.
SOME SENATE RACES AND YOU LOOK
AT SOME OF THE SENATE RACES
WHERE WE WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO
CONTEST.
IT'S A DEMOCRAT THAT'S IN.
WE WERE FIGURING -- WE ARE
WINNING WITH CANDIDATES THAT --
WE ARE WINNING.
WE ARE BEATING PEOPLE THAT WE
WEREN'T GOING TO CONTEST.
ITS BEEN AMAZING.
PEOPLE REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THE
SUPREME COURT IS.
WE COULD HAVE TWO, THREE, MAYBE
EVEN FOUR MORE CHOICES AND WE
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE VOTES
TO PUT THEM THROUGH.
GO OUT AND VOTE.
NOVEMBER 6TH.
FROM THE MOMENT BRETT KAVANAUGH
WAS ANNOUNCED, AN ANGRY DEMOCRAT
MOB WAS ON A MISSION TO RESIST
OBSTRUCT, DELAY, DEMOLISH AND
DESTROY HIM.
AND BEFORE THEY EVEN KNOW -- YOU
SAW IT.
BEFORE THEY KNEW HIS NAME, THEY
WERE SAYING HORRIBLE THINGS.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO WAS
GOING TO BE THE PICK.
HE WASN'T PICKED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO
BE THE PICK AND THEY WERE SAYING
HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE THINGS.
THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE.
WE CAN'T -- LET THIS HAPPEN TO
OUR COUNTRY.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE RULE
OF LAW.
NOT THE RULE OF THE MOB.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
ITS A MOB.
THE PEOPLE OF OHIO CAN SAVE
AMERICA FROM HAD CAL DEMOCRATS.
I MEAN -- RADICAL DEMOCRATS.
I MEAN ELIZABETH WARREN --S SHE
BECOMING MAINSTREAM.
YOU BELIEVE THAT ONE?
WE HAVE TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN
HOUSE AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE.
WE NEED THE VOTES.
WE NEED THE VOTES.
AND BY THE WAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF
OHIO, EARLY VOTING STARTS RIGHT
NOW.
YOU GOT TO GET OUT.
VOTE EARLY.
ANYBODY THAT VOTES EARLY, YOU
CAN LEAVE.
THE WITH YOU.
I WORK IN CINCINNATI OHIO TWO
SUMMERS RIGHT?
I LOVED OHIO.
I LOVED OHIO.
I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU THIS, BUT I
USED TO TRAVEL A LOT TO
KENTUCKY.
DOES ANYBODY TRAVEL TO KENTUCKY?
NO, I DID.
I LIKE KENTUCKY.
I TRAVELED TO KENTUCKY.
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE
QUEEN CITY.
I LOVE THE QUEEN CITY.
IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.
IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE.
I DID IT WITH MY FATHER.
ONE OF MY EARLIEST THINGS I HAVE
DONE.
I GUESS IT SORT OF LIKE IS
LIKE -- IF YOU GET YOUR FIRST UP
AS A HIT YOU ARE A HITTER.
YOU HIT -- YOU SINK THE 10 FOOT
PUTT ON THE FIRST HOLE.
THEN THEY SAID -- REMEMBER FOR
MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, YOU
CANNOT WIN WITHOUT GETTING THE
GREAT STATE OF OHIO.
RIGHT?
AND I GOT THE GREAT STATE OF
OHIO!
AND I LOVE THE GREAT STATE OF
OHIO!
WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.
REMEMBER THEY USED TO SAY THAT
EVERY TIME I USED TO HEAR IT, I
HAVE FANTASTIC PEOPLE IN OHIO
THAT DID A JOB FOR ME.
BOB, WHERE IS BOB?
I HAD JUST A GREAT GROUP OF
PEOPLE.
THEY DID INCREDIBLE WORK BUT
THEY CONSTANTLY WOULD SAY ON
THESE PHONY NETWORKS, YOU CANNOT
WIN UNLESS YOU WIN THE GREAT
STATE OF OHIO.
THEN THEY STARTED DOING POLLS
AND I WAS WAY UP.
I THINK WE WON IT BY NINE OR TEN
POINTS.
WE WON IT BY A LOT.
IN FACT YOU KNOW ITS CLOSE THEY
HAVE TO TAKE HOURS AND HOURS AND
HOURS.
WITH OHIO I WILL NEVER FORGET,
THEY SAID THE POLLS HAVE CLOSED
IN OHIO.
DONALD TRUMP HAS WON THE STATE
OF OHIO.
CRAZY.
WE WON OHIO BY SO MUCH THAT
IT TOOK ONE SECOND BEFORE THEY
CALLED IT.
WE WON BY A LOT.
IT'S A GREAT PLACE.
BY THE WAY, HAVE I PRODUCED --
LOOK AT WHAT IS COMING INTO OHIO
NOW.
HAVE WE PRODUCED?
I PRODUCED AND YOU PRODUCED.
IF NANCY AND THE DEMOCRATS --
TAKE CONTROL THEY WILL TRY TO
RAISE YOUR TAXES, IMPOSE
SOCIALISM ON THIS COUNTRY, TAKE
AWAY YOUR HEALTH CARE AND TAKE
AWAY YOUR JOBS.
WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE WORKING NOW
THAN EVER BEFORE.
THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO ERASE
AMERICA'S BORDERS AND LET DRUGS,
GANGS AND CRIME POUR INTO OUR
COUNTRY.
IN FACT I HAVE BEEN GOING
AROUND LATELY SAYING THE
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF CRIME
AND NOBODY EVEN CHANNELS ME.
NOT EVEN THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA.
THEY DON'T EVEN CHALLENGE ME.
REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY OF
SAFETY AND REPUBLICANS ARE THE
PARTY OF JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.
THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING.
WE ARE HONORED TO BE JOINED
TONIGHT BY MANY TERRIFIC OHIO
REPUBLICANS INCLUDING REPUBLICAN
PARTY CHAIR -- I HAVE TO SAY
THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE
YOU KNOW -- I GOT DROPPED JUST
BEFORE THEY ELECTION BY THE HEAD
OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
I HAD NEVER BEEN DROPPED IN MY
LIFE.
A WOMAN CAME IN WHO WAS A VERY
SUCCESSFUL PERSON WITH A GREAT
FAMILY AND SHE TOOK THAT THING
OVER.
WHAT A JOB SHE'S DONE.
HER NAME IS JANE AND SHE IS VERY
SPECIAL.
WHERE IS JANE?
SHE'S INCREDIBLE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND A MAN WHO SAID -- YOU ARE
GOING TO WIN.
YOU ARE GOING TO WIN.
I SAID -- WELL -- HOW DO YOU
KNOW.
HI FIVE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FROM TO
HEAD UP MY CAMPAIGN IN OHIO.
ONE NAME I DON'T KNOW I LIKED
THE NAME.
I LIKED THE SOUND OF IT.
HIS NAME WAS BOB.
WHY DO I LIKE THAT NAME?
WHY?
ITS NOT OUTSTANDING BUT -- HE --
CAME IN AND HE DID A JOB AND --
I HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE
BUT NOT -- THE SUPPORT OF A LOT
OF OTHERS AND HE JUST SAID YOU
ARE GOING WIN AND EVERY TIME I
CALLED THEM UP I WOULD SAY THIS
HAPPENED, THAT HAPPENED.
HE WOULD SAY THAT SO DAY, -- IS
OKAY.
YOU GOING TO WIN BY MORE.
THIS GUY IS THE MOST POSITIVE
GUY.
I WANT TO THANK BOB.
SO GOOD WE MOVED HIM OVER TO THE
RNC BUT BOB IN ABOUT A YEAR FROM
NOW GET READY.
YOU ARE COMING BACK HERE.
THANK YOU, BOB.
WE HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS
AN INCREDIBLY RESPECTED MAN IN
THE U.S. SENATE.
WHEN HE SPEAKS, WE ALL LISTEN
INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT.
HE REALLY IS.
HE'S LOVED IN OHIO.
SENATOR ROB PORTMAN.
HE'S A RESPECTED GUY.
THANK YOU, ROB.
CONGRESSMAN WARREN DAVIDSON AND
CONGRESSMAN -- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FELLAS.
GREAT JOB.
SO MANY THINGS WE PASSED IN
CONGRESS.
THOSE TWO GUYS WERE THERE WITH
US.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WHAT A JOB THEY HAVE DONE.
WE ARE ALSO JOINED BY YOUR NEXT
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, JOHN.
JOHN, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, JOHN.
AND I HEAR YOU ARE UP A LITTLE
BIT JOHN.
WE GOT TO GET THAT OVER BECAUSE
YOU ARE GOING TO AGAINST A VERY
BAD GUY.
I TELL YOU HE'S A BAD GUY.
AND EVERYBODY -- JOHN IS WITH A
FRIEND OF MINE AND THEY DECIDED
TO GET TOGETHER WHICH IS VERY
SMART.
INSTEAD OF GOING LIKE THIS TO
EACH OTHER THEY GOT TOGETHER AND
JOHN IS RUNNING WITH YOUR NEXT
GOVERNOR, MIKE DEWINE.
AND MIKE AND JOHN ARE
RUNNING AGAINST ELIZABETH
WARREN'S FAR LEFT --
RICHARD.
JOHN, AM I ALLOWED TO SAY SOME
BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM?
LET ME TELL YOU HE DID SUCH A
BAD JOB AT THE AGENCY THAT HE
RAN.
IT WAS TERRIBLE.
HE WAS HURTING PEOPLE AND I
THINK HE ENJOYED IT.
NO, REALLY, I REALLY BELIEVE HE
ENJOYED IT.
HE WAS PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF
BUSINESS.
THEY WEREN'T LOANING MONEY TO
THE PEOPLE THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO.
IT WAS TERRIBLE.
HE SPENT $250 MILLION FEDERAL
DOLLARS TRYING TO RENOVATE A
HEADQUARTERS, HIS AGENCY, THAT
THEY DIDN'T EVEN OWN MORE THAN
TWICE WHAT THE ENTIRE BUILDING
WAS WORTH.
THEY DIDN'T OWN IT.
THEN IT BECAME A BIG SCANDAL.
BECAUSE HE WAS A DEMOCRAT THE
FAKE NEWS DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE
ABOUT IT.
THEN AFTER SPENDING LIKE $50
MILLION ON SOME ELEVATORS, IT
TURNED OUT THAT THEY DIDN'T
WORK.
IF HE WERE EVER -- I TELL YOU
WHAT, THIS IS A -- I CAN'T
BELIEVE -- I KNOW OHIO PRETTY
WELL, RIGHT?
I'VE DONE A LOT FOR THE STEEL
INDUSTRY.
MORE THAN ANYBODY HAS DONE IN
MANY YEARS.
YOU SPEAK TO U.S. STEEL, THEY
WILL
TELL YOU.
THIS GUY DOES NOT BELONG IN THIS
STATE, FOLKS.
FIRST OF ALL HE'S A SUPER
LIBERAL.
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
OKAY, GO WITH DEWINE PLEASE AND
JOHN.
HE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE
DISASTER FOR OHIO.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE
HE'S DOING.
I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HIM OUT.
HE TRIED SO HARD.
HE HAD ONE OF THESE DEALS YOU
COULDN'T GET HIM OUT BUT WE
TRIED SO HARD.
THEY HAVE DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB
SINCE THEY HAVE GOT HIM OUT.
HE WAS BAD.
YOU DON'T NEED HIM IN OHIO.
NOW I'M THRILLED TO INTRODUCE
THE NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR
FROM OHIO.
HE'S A GREAT GUY AND A GREAT
FRIEND OF MINE.
JIM, COME UP.
COME UP.
COME.
THIS IS A GOOD MAN.
NOTHING IS EASY ABOUT POLITICS
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, HES IN
THERE FIGHTING.
GET OUT AND VOTE FOR HIM.
HE'S A GOOD, GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
AND A GOOD MAN.
.
>> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
IT'S AN HONOR TO STAND HERE WITH
YOU TONIGHT LIKE I STOOD WITH
YOU 31 MONTHS GUY WHEN YOU WERE
CANDIDATE TRUMP AND I TOLD YOU
I'M WITH YOU.
I TOLD YOU I'VE VOTED FOR YOU.
I TOLD YOU MY WIFE VOTED FOR
YOU.
MY FAMILY VOTED FOR YOU.
MY FRIENDS VOTED FOR YOU CAUSE
WE NEEDED YOU TO CHANGE
WASHINGTON AND YOU HAVEN'T LET
ME DOWN.
LOOK, THIS CROWD LOVES YOU.
OHIO LOVES YOU.
WE LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
YOU HAVE GOT THE OHIO COP
ME GROWING.
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN.
WAGES ARE UP.
YOU HAVE TWO SUPREME COURT
JUDGES CONFIRMED AND MORE
CIRCUIT JUDGES CONFIRMED THAN
ANY OTHER PRESIDENT.
YOU HAVE REPEALED THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE THAT WAS HURTING SO MANY
INDIVIDUALS HERE IN OHIO.
RENEGE ATED AND A HALF TAX
HELPING OHIO BUSINESS.
PASSED RIGHT TO TRY.
ISIS IS ON THE RUN.
AND YOU HAVE GIVEN OUR COAL
MINERS HERE IN OHIO HOPE BY
REVERSING THOSE DEVASTATING
POLICIES THAT THE PRIOR
ADMINISTRATION VOWED TO BANKRUPT
THAT INDUSTRY.
PROMISES KEPT.
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.
LOOK, MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE NOT
TIRED OF WINNING HERE IN OHIO.
AND YET YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO DO ALL THAT WITH NO HELP FROM
OHIO SENATOR BROWN.
HE'S FOUGHT YOU EVERY TURN
VOTING AGAINST THE TAX BILL.
VOTING AGAINST COAL MINERS.
VOTING AGAINST YOUR JUDGES
CONFIRMATIONS.
YOU ASK FOR HELP, AND THAT IS
WHY I JUMPED IN THIS RACE SEVEN
MONTHS AGO AND I'M HERE TO
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE LIKE --
HELP JUST LIKE OHIO.
EVERYONE HERE IS HERE TO HELP.
BROWN VOTES 96% OF THE TIME WITH
SCHUMER AND 94% OF THE TIME WITH
ELIZABETH WARREN.
YET HE VOTED 100% OF THE TIME
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA'S JUDGE
APPOINTEES.
HE SUPPORTED HILLARY CLINTON FOR
PRESIDENT.
AND -- AND EVEN THOUGH --
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE RIPPING
UP THOSE TRADE AGREEMENTS, THAT
AREN'T WORKING FOR OHIO, SENATOR
BROWN HAD THE GAL JUST A MONTH
AGO TO SAY THE ONLY THING
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR
TRADE POLICY IS RUN HIS MONTH
AND LINE HIS POCKETS.
THAT'S THE TYPE OF GUY WHO IS
NOT HELPING THIS PRESIDENT.
SHERRY BROWN IS THE FOURTH
MOST LIBERAL SENATOR IN THE
COUNTRY.
THAT IS NOT OHIO.
THAT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE
AVERAGE AMERICAN.
HE VOTES LIKE A HOLLYWOOD
LIBERAL AND HE'S RECEIVED THE
MOST LOBBYIST MONEY IN THE
SENATE.
MORE THAN ANY OTHER SENATOR HE
HAS RECEIVED THE MOST LOBBYIST
DOLLARS.
LOOK, ITS TIME WE SEND
SHERRY BROWN PACKING.
AND ITS TIME WE SEND ME TO
WASHINGTON.
SOMEONE THAT'S WILLING TO
HELP THIS PRESIDENT.
IN 25 DAYS -- IN -- IN 25 DAYS,
IN JUST 25 DAYS, WE NEED TO
RETIRE BROWN.
WE NEED A RED WAVE.
WE NEED A RED WAVE NOT ONLY A
RED WAVE AND I SAID THIS EARLIER
MR. PRESIDENT, OHIO IS GOING TO
DELIVER A RED TSUNAMI.
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE
DOING, MR. PRESIDENT AND THANK
YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR
OHIO.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
THANKS, JIM.
IT IS TRUE.
BROWN IS NEVER VOTING FOR US.
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT
WE WANT.
YET I HEAR HE GOES AROUND -- HE
DOES THE BEST COMMERCIALS.
IN FACT I SORT OF THINK IS HE A
REPUBLICAN?
HE IS DOING THOSE COMMERCIALS
THAT HE LIKES DONALD TRUMP.
HE WILL NEVER VOTE FOR US.
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR JUSTICE
KAVANAUGH.
HE DIDN'T VOTE FOR TAX CUTS.
HE DOESN'T VOTE FOR US.
IT MIGHT BE NICE FOR HIM TO SAY
HE AGREES WITH MY ECONOMIC
POLICY BUT HE'S NEVER GOING TO
VOTE FOR IT.
YOU ARE JUST KIDDING YOURSELF.
HE VOTED YES ON AMNESTY FOR
ILLEGAL ALIENS.
WE STARTED BUILDING THE WALL AND
WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS BUT HE
VOTED AGAINST IT.
SO ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
TAKES AMERICAN LIVES, AMERICAN
JOBS AND AMERICAN TAX PAYER
DOLLARS.
A BORDER WALL WHICH IS MOVING
FASTER THAN ANYBODY WOULD
BELIEVE, IS TRULY A LIFE SAVING
BARRIER AGAINST DEADLY FLOODS OF
DRUGS, CRIMES, #134UGALLERS,
TRAFFICKERS, CARTELS, OUR BRAVE
BORDER AGENTS WANT A WALL.
THEY NEED A WALL.
ITS HAPPENING.
ITS MOVING.
WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS.
WE WILL FINISH THE WALL.
IF YOU WANT MORE JOBS, AND
LESS CRIME, IF YOU WANT TO STOP
SCHUMER FROM RUNNING THE
SENATE -- WE NEED THE VOTE OF
JIM.
WE DO.
JIM IS A GOOD PERSON.
HE IS A GREAT GUY.
WE NEED HIS VOTE.
THEY SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY BUT
IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, THEY
CAN'T COME IN, WE DON'T HAVE A
MAJORITY ANYMORE.
WE GOT TO GET PEOPLE.
WE GOT TO GET SOME REPUBLICANS
THAT CAN VOTE.
FINALLY ITS MY PRIVILEGE TO
INTRODUCE A TREMENDOUS
REPUBLICAN.
A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE.
HE HAS FOUGHT SO HARD FOR
EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE.
HE'S A TRUE FIGHTER FOR THE
STATE.
CONGRESSMAN STEVE.
GREAT GUY.
COME UP, STEVE.
COME UP, STEVE.
>> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT AND
GOD BLESS WARREN COUNTY.
ALL RIGHT, YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
AND GOD BLESS HAMILTON COUNTY.
GOD BLESS Y'ALL AND GOD BLESS
PRESIDENT TRUMP!
THANK YOU.
AND I -- NEVER KNEW I'D SAY THIS
BUT -- GOD BLESS KANYE WEST!
HEY, YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW
HOW MANY LIBERALS IT TAKES TO
SCREW IN A LIGHT BULB?
NONE BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO STAY
IN THE DARK SO -- LET ME JUST --
LET ME JUST SAY I GOT ABOUT A
SIX PAGE SPEECH HERE.
I DECIDED THE MORE STEVE YOU
GET, THE LESS PRESIDENT TRUMP
YOU ARE BEING TO GET.
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE THIS
SPEECH.
GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS
PRESIDENT TRUMP!
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, STEVE.
SO JUST REMEMBER A VOTE FOR
STEVE IS A VOTE TO PROTECT YOUR
FAMILY, YOUR JOBS AND AND YOUR
COUNTRY.
STEVE IS WINNING.
NICE POLL NUMBERS BUT DON'T TAKE
ANY CHANCES.
GET OUT AND VOTE PLEASE.
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY
UPSETS.
HE'S A GREAT, GREAT GUY.
IF YOU WANT TO STOP THE RADICAL
DEMOCRATS, IF YOU WANT TO STOP
NANCY FROM BECOMING SPEAKER THEN
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT AND VOTE
FOR STEVE.
ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION
IS MEDICARE.
DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR A
SOCIALIST TAKE OVER OF AMERICAN
HEALTH CARE THAT WOULD UTTERLY
DESTROY MEDICARE AND ROB OUR
SENIORS OF THE BENEFITS THEY
PAID INTO THEIR ENTIRE LIVES.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND THEY HAVE
PAID FOR IT.
AND THE DEMOCRATS WANT RADICAL
SOCIALISM AND THEY WANT OPEN
BORDERS WHERE EVERYBODY POURS
INTO OUR COUNTRY.
ITS WHAT THEY WANT.
I DON'T GET IT BUT THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT.
DOES ANYBODY WANT THAT?
OPEN BORDERS.
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE DEMOCRAT
PARTY IS TO ABOLISH ICE.
THINK OF THAT.
I TELL YOU WHAT, THE INCREDIBLE
MEN AND WOMEN OF ICE ARE NOT
TREATED PROPERLY.
THEY ARE NOT TREATED PROPERLY.
THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN
AMERICA INTO A GIANT SANCTUARY
CITY FOR CRIMINAL ALIENS, MS 13
KILLERS AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT
WANTS TO COME IN.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE IT.
WE ARE NOT GOING HAVE IT.
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS.
NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS.
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SAFETY
AND IS ABOUT PROSPERITY.
SINCE THE ELECTION, WHICH IS
INCREDIBLE, IF I WOULD HAVE SAID
THIS I HAVE FWON OHIO SO MANY
TIMES -- BEEN TO EVERY PART OF
OHIO.
THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT.
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID THIS, THE
FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID HOW
DARE HE SAID THAT.
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE
CREATED OVER 4.2 MILLION NEW
JOBS AND LIFTED OVER 4 MILLION
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.
BIG DEAL.
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
WE HAVE ADDED NEARLY 600,000
BRAND NEW BEAUTIFUL
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
RIGHT?
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN POVERTY HAS
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER.
ITS LOWEST RATE EVER.
MY -- IT'S A BIG NUMBER, RIGHT?
HOW DO THEY BEAT THAT NUMBER?
HOW DOES ANYBODY BEAT THAT
NUMBER?
WE WILL HAVE THESE PEOPLE COME
IN FOR OVER 100 YEARS, THEY HAVE
HAVE
CLAIMED AND THEY HAVE LIED TO
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
REMEMBER MY STATEMENT, WHAT DO
YOU HAVE TO LOSE?
GUESS WHAT, THEY ALL BELIEVE IT
NOW.
WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO LOSE?
WE ARE DOING GREAT AS A COUNTRY.
I'M SO PROUD -- I AM SO PROUD OF
THE KIND OF NUMBERS YOU ARE
HEARING MY ADMINISTRATION IS
FIGHTING EVERYDAY TO DELIVER
SAFETY, OPPORTUNITY AND JUSTICE
FOR EVERYBODY.
FOR EVERYBODY.
WE ARE ASKING AS AN EXAMPLE ALL
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS TO HONOR
US WITH THEIR SUPPORT THIS
NOVEMBER.
GET AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS.
GET AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS.
THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING.
THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING.
THINK OF IT, WE HAVE THE BEST
NUMBERS IN HISTORY ON EMPLOYMENT
AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND MEDIAN
INCOME AND MANY OTHER THINGS.
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO GET THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE.
AND ITS TRUE, KANYE WEST, WHAT
HE DID WAS PRETTY AMAZING
YESTERDAY.
PRETTY AMAZING.
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS WITH
HIM?
A GUY YOU KNOW WELL, BIG JIM
BROWN.
BIG JIM.
WHAT DO YOU THINK BIG JIM WOULD
BE MAKING TODAY IN THE NFL?
HE WAS UNSTOPPABLE, RIGHT?
UNSTOPPABLE JIM BROWN.
HE WAS A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER
AND AN EVEN GREATER MAN.
HE'S GREAT.
HISPANIC AMERICANS AND
ASIAN-AMERICANS LIKE WISE HAVE
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
AND WOMEN UNEMPLOYMENT JUST FELL
TO 3.6% WHICH IS SOON TO BE
CHANGED TO HISTORIC LEVELS BUT
RIGHT NOW I'M SORRY, ITS THE
LOWEST IN 65 YEARS, OKAY.
SORRY.
SORRY, WOMEN.
I LET THE WOMEN DOWN.
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING,
RIGHT?
TIRED OF WINNING.
LAST WEEK I ANNOUNCED THAT WE
ARE REPLACING THE HORRENDOUS
NAFTA
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER, FOLKS.
NAFTA WAS A DISASTER WITH THE
INCREDIBLE BRAND NEW U.S.,
MEXICO, CANADA TRADE AGREEMENT.
THE USMCA.
ITS OPENING UP CAN -- CANADA,
OPENING UP MEXICO FOR OUR
FARMERS.
WE HAVE TAKEN THE TOUGHEST
ACTION TO CRACK DOWN ON CHINA'S
UNFAIR TRADE ACTIONS AND TRADE
ABUSES.
THANKS TO OUR TARIFFS, AND
ESPECIALLY ON STEEL THAT'S BEEN
DUMPED ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY,
THE OHIO STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE
U.S. STEEL INDUSTRY IS ROARING
BACK TO LIFE AND SOON WILL BE
HITTING ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL
YEARS EVER.
VERY SOON.
AND YOU SEE IT.
YOU SEE IT ALL OVER THIS STATE.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP WE
HAVE PASS THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF
TAX CUTS AND REFORMS IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
AND BY THE WAY, BROWN VOTED
AGAINST THEM.
WE REDUCED HIGH DOSE OPIOID
PRESCRIPTIONS BY 16% DURING MY
FIRST YEAR AND NOW THEY ARE
DROPPING MUCH LOWER THAN THAT.
AND I WILL SOON SIGN INTO LAW
THE LARGEST LEGISLATIVE EFFORT
IN HES RI TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID
CRISIS WHERE JUST THIS YEAR WE
GOT $6 BILLION FROM CONGRESS.
THANKS TO ROB PORTMAN AND A LOT
OF OTHERS.
THANK YOU, ROB.
BUT ROB AND SO MANY OTHERS
HELPED VERY LITTLE DEMOCRAT
SUPPORT.
WE ALSO PASSED VETERANS CHOICE.
THE VA -- GIVING OUR VETERANS
THE RIGHT TO SEE A PRIVATE
DOCTOR AND THE LANDMARK VA
ACCOUNT ABILITY LAW TO ENSURE
ANYONE WHO MISTREATS OUR
VETERANS WHO WE COULDN'T FIRE,
WE NOW LOOK AT THEM AND SAY JIM,
YOU FIRED.
OUT.
GET OUT.
WE SECURED $700 #3WI8ON AND
BILLION AND
$716 BILLION FOR THE SECOND YEAR
TO FULLY REBUILD THE AMERICAN
MILITARY WHICH HAD TO HAPPEN.
WE NEEDED IT.
AND MUCH LESS IMPORTANTLY WHEN
IT COMES TO THE MILITARY, EVERY
BIT OF EQUIPMENT IS BEING BUILT
IN THE USA.
THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE JOBS
ARE SECONDARY.
NUMBER ONE, WE NEEDED THE
EQUIPMENT BUT ITS ALL BEING
BUILT HERE.
WE MAKE THE GREATEST MILITARY
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD.
AT MY DIRECTION THE PENTAGON IS
NOW WORKING TO CREATE THE SIXTH
BRANCH OF THE AMERICAN ARMED
FORCES CALLED THE SPACE FORCE.
VERY IMPORTANT.
VERY IMPORTANT.
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
HATE TO SAY IT BUT VERY SOON
THAT'S WHERE ITS GOING BE AT.
IT GOING TO BE SPACE EVERYTHING.
DEFENSE, OFFENSE EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM
ROB AND THE SENATE.
I WITH DREW THE UNITED STATES
FROM THE HORRIBLE ONE SIDED IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL AND LOOK WHAT
HAPPENED TO IRAN.
YOU KNOW WHEN I TOOK OFFICE IRAN
WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
THEY WERE TAKING OVER SYRIA.
THEY WERE TAKING OVER YEMEN.
THEY WERE TAKING OVER
EVERYTHING.
I ACTUALLY SAID THIS IS GOING TO
BE A PROBLEM.
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING AND --
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO WE WITH
DREW FROM THAT HORRIBLE
RIDICULOUS DEAL.
YOU TAKE A LOOK WHAT IS
HAPPENING TO IRAN.
THERE IS RIOTS ALL OVER THE
STREETS, ALL OVER THE CITIES.
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL
GAME.
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT COUNTRY
AND -- ITS LOOKING REAL GOOD.
LOOKING REAL GOOTD GOOD.
AND WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE
CAPITOL OF ISRAEL AND REOPENED
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN
JERUSALEM.
TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE
UNBELIEVABLE PROGRESS AND WE ARE
JUST GETTING STARTED.
WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER THINGS.
IF YOU VOTE TO ELECT REPUBLICAN
HOUSE, REPUBLICAN SENATE, WE
WILL CONTINUE TO CUT YOUR TAXES,
CUT YOUR REGULATIONS AND RAISE
YOUR INCOMES VERY, VERY
SUBSTANTIALLY.
WE WILL PROTECT MEDICARE AND WE
WILL PROTECT YOUR SOCIAL
SECURITY.
THE DEMOCRATS CANNOT DO IT.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONFIRM
JUDGES WHO INTERPRET THE
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN.
WE WILL FULLY SECURE THE BORDER.
WE WILL PASS KATE'S LAW, CRACK
DOWN ON SANCTUARY CITIES AND THE
VISA LOTTERY AND CHAIN
MIGRATION.
DEFEND THE -- FOR AMERICAN
CITIZENS AND THROW VICIOUS MS 13
GANGS THE OUT OF OUR
COUNTRY LIKE WE ARE DOING RIGHT
NOW.
OUT OF HERE.
I SAY IT TO PEOPLE, MS 13,
GAINING, VICIOUS, HORRIBLE
PEOPLE.
WE ARE THROWING THEM OUT OF HERE
BY THE THOUSANDS.
YOU KNOW WHO IS DOING IT?
DO WE LOVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR
WHAT?
YOU KNOW -- BUT ICE IN LONG
ISLAND WHERE I SORT OF GREW UP,
I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THESE AREAS,
I KNOW THEM SO WELL.
YOU HAD UP -- TOWNS THAT WERE
PEAK
LIBERTY TAKEN OVER BY MS 13.
THEY STARTED THROWING THEM IN
THE PATTY WAGON.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE TOWNS ARE LIBERATED.
THE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING FROM
WINDOWS.
THE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING ALL OVER
THE STREETS.
THESE TOWNS LIKE A COUNTRY THAT
WAS INVADED AND TAKEN OVER AN
THEN WAS LIBERATED.
THESE TOWNS ARE BEING LIBERATED
OF THE MS 13 GARBAGE THAT CAME
INTO OUR COUNTRY.
UNDER THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION BY THE WAY, AND
THEY CAME IN BY THE TENS OF
THOUSANDS.
WELL, WE HAVE -- SET EVERY
RECORD ON GETTING THEM OUT.
I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE IS
NOTHING THAT GIVES ME MORE
PLEASURE.
AND FOR ALL OF THE
COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING BACK
INTO THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL
FINALLY HAVE A MERRITT BASED
SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION.
NOT JUST LUCK, NOT A LOTTERY,
PICK THEM OUT OF A HAT, WHO THE
ARE THEY?
WHO IS HE?
PICK HIM OUT OF A HAT.
WE ARE LETTING PEOPLE COME IN ON
MERRITT WHERE THEY CAN HELP YOU.
WHERE THEY CAN HELP THESE
COMPANIES GROW.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A SYSTEM
LOTTERY.
THINK OF IT, LOTTERY, PICK THEM
I WONDER -- WHAT PEOPLE TO YOU
THINK THESE COUNTRIES ARE
PUTTING?
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE PUTTING IN
THEIR FINEST?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
SO WE ARE GOING TO END IT.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MERRITT
BASED SYSTEM.
BRING THEM IN THROUGH MERRITT.
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK.
DEPENDANTS TO INDEPENDENTS AND
POVERTY TO PROSPERITY.
YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING.
BUT TO ACHIEVE THIS YOU HAVE TO
GET OUT NOVEMBER 6TH OR VOTE
EARLY AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
WE NEED THE VOTES.
WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE VOTES.
FOR YEARS AND YEARS YOU HAVE
WATCHED AS YOUR LEADERS
APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA.
THEY APOLOGIZED FOR US.
NOW YOU FINALLY HAVE A PRESIDENT
WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I WISH
THESE FAKERS BACK THERE, THE
FAKE NEWS, I WISH THEY WOULD
TURN THE CAMERAS AND SHOW BEHIND
THEM, SHOW OUTSIDE THESE WALLS.
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
ITS AMAZING.
LOOK.
THEY NEVER TURNED THE CAMERAS.
I GO HOME, I SAY TO MY WIFE, HOW
DID THE CROWD LOOK?
THEY ONLY SHOW YOUR FACE, THEY
NEVER MOVE THE CAMERA.
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE CAN TELL BY
THE SOUND BECAUSE -- TRUE.
SHE CAN TELL BY THE SOUND
BECAUSE YOU KNOW -- IF YOU HAVE
LIKE -- LETS SAY -- ONE OF THE
NORMAL PRECEDENTS WALK IN -- YOU
HAVE WHAT, 300 PEOPLE SHOW UP.
BUT YOU CAN TELL BY THE SOUND
BECAUSE 300 PEOPLE CANNOT MAKE
THE SOUND OF THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS
LIKE WE HAVE.
YOU CAN'T DO IT.
SO EVEN THOUGH THEY REFUSED --
NORMALLY I WOULD LIKE IT BUT I
DON'T.
THEY DON'T WANT TO MOVE THE
CAMERA.
THE ONLY ONES THAT BECOME FAMOUS
ARE ABOUT SIX PEOPLE RIGHT
BEHIND ME.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BEST SEAT IN
THE HOUSE BUT THEY WILL BECOME
THE FAMOUS ONES.
HONESTLY, YOU KNOW -- I KNOW
WHAT STADIUMS SOUND LIKE.
THIS SOUNDS LIKE ON TELEVISION
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OHIO
STATE FOOTBALL GAME.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
AND SPEAKING OF OHIO STATE, THEY
ARE NOT DOING TOO BADLY, ARE
THEY, HUH?
GREAT COACH.
THIS HAVE -- THEY HAVE A GREAT
COACH, GREAT GUY.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR
VALUES.
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR OHIO AND
WE ARE PROUDLY STANDING UP FOR
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
BUT TO CONTINUE OUR MOMENTUM, I
NEED YOU TO GET YOUR FRIENDS,
GET YOUR FAMILY, GET YOUR
NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR COWORKERS
AND VOTE REPUBLICAN.
VOTE EARLY OR ON NOVEMBER 6TH
VOTE -- REPUBLICAN.
VOTE FOR STEVE, JIM, VOTE FOR
DEWINE.
WE NEED DEWINE.
WE GOT TO HAVE DEWINE.
WHERE THE IS JOHN?
ARE YOU OVER THERE JOHN?
HE'S STILL HERE.
HE WILL NEVER LEAVE.
YOU GOT TO VOTE.
WE NEED A GOVERNOR HERE.
YOU CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO
OHIO.
THIS DEMOCRAT IS A DISASTER.
A PROVEN DISASTER.
VOTE DEWINE.
HE'S A GOOD MAP -- MAN AND A
GOOD
MAN TOO.
VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
IS A VOTE FOR MORE JOBS, MORE
WEALTH, MORE PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT
HERE IN THE USA WHICH IS WHAT WE
ARE ALL ABOUT.
ITS A VOTE TO RESPECT OUR
BORDERS, RESPECT OUR
CONSTITUTION AND RESPECT THE
HEROS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.
THANK YOU, LAW ENFORCEMENT.
AND A VOTE FOR REPUBLICAN --
REPUBLICAN
SOCIAL SECURITY A VOTE --
REPUBLICANS IS A VOTE TO REJECT
THE HATE OF DEMOCRATS.
BRETT KAVANAUGH -- YOU SAW WHAT
THEY DID TO HIM.
AND HIS FAMILY.
AND HIS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL --
DAUGHTERS.
RIGHT?
DON AND DICK.
CORY BOOKER RAN NEWARK INTO THE
GROUND.
SENATOR DIANE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
HOW ABOUT THAT?
SERIOUSLY.
WHO THINKS THAT DIANE LEAKED THE
PAPERS?
WHO THINKS?
YEAH.
I'D SAY.
SHE WAS VERY UNPREPARED FOR THAT
QUESTION.
SHE WAS VERY UNPREPARED, RIGHT?
VERY UNPREPARED.
WHAT THEY DID TO THIS MAN -- HE
WILL GO DOWN ALONG WITH JUSTICE
GORSUCH.
AND BY THE WAY, HOW GOOD IS
CLARENCE THOMAS?
HOW GOOD?
HOW GOOD?
HE'S GOING GO -- TO GO DOWN AS
ONE OF YOUR GREATS.
ITS UP TO THE PEOPLE IN THIS
INCREDIBLE -- I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU CALL IT A ROOM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE IT IS.
ALL I KNOW -- IS THIS A ROOM OAR
ROOF?
I THINK ITS A ROOF.
WHATEVER IT IS THERE IS A LOT OF
PEOPLE.
BUT ITS UP TO YOU FOLKS, YOU
HAVE THE POWER WITH YOUR VOTE TO
DEFEND YOUR FAMILY, YOUR
COUNTRY, YOUR VALUES, YOUR FAITH
AND TO DEFEND YOUR DIGNITY.
SO WE HAD THE GREATEST MOVEMENT
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.
WE REALLY DID.
THEY CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT
NOBODY EVEN CHANGES.
-- CHALLENGES.
THE FAKE NEWS WILL HIT ME THE
NEXT DAY TRUMP EXAGGERATED.
ACTUALLY WE HAVE UNDER
EXAGGERATED BECAUSE WE PRODUCED
MORE THAN I EVER PROMISED DURING
THE CAMPAIGN.
MORE.
BUT WE HAD THE GREATEST -- BUT
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS GROUP.
WE HAD THE GREATEST AND WE
NEVER -- BY THE WAY I HATE TO
DISDISAPPOINT YOU BECAUSE WE
WENT TO MISSISSIPPI, WE WENT TO
NEVADA, EVERY PLACE, AND WE HAVE
CROWDS WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF EVERY ARENA.
THEY HAVE TO START BUILDING
LARGER ARENAS IN THIS COUNTRY.
RIGHT?
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
I SAW THIS IN THE ELECTION.
WE WOULD GO -- WE WENT TO
MICHIGAN FINAL STUFF.
I GO -- GOT THERE AT 11:00 IN
THE MORNING.
THERE WERE 32,000 PEOPLE.
I SEE SOME PEOPLE THERE -- THEY
WERE THERE.
32,000 PEOPLE.
I STARTED SPEAKING AT 1:00 IN
THE MORNING.
I GOT HOME AT 4:00 IN THE
MORNING AND I SAID -- WE HAD
32,000.
CROOKED HILLARY HAD LIKE -- 500.
I SAID -- WHY AREN'T WE GOING TO
TWIN GREAT STATE OF MICHIGAN AND
GUESS -- WIN THE GREAT STATE OF
MICHIGAN AND GUESS WHAT?
WE DID.
WE DID.
AND IT HADN'T BEEN WON IN
DECADES BY A REPUBLICAN.
NOW THEY LIKE ME EVEN MORE.
YOU KNOW WHY?
CAUSE CAR COMPANIES ARE MOVING
PLANTS BACK IN.
AND JUST SO YOU DON'T FEEL TOO
LONELY THEY ARE MOVING THE PLANT
AS BACK INTO OHIO ALSO.
A LOT OF THEM.
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED
BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND TOGETHER
WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY.
WE ARE RETURNING THE POWER BACK
TO THE INCREDIBLE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
OHIO IS THE STATE THAT GAVE
US -- A GREAT PRESIDENT WHO
HASN'T BEEN PROPERLY RECOGNIZED.
OKAY.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY.
HE HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY
RECOGNIZED.
WHAT HE DID IN TERMS OF TRADE,
IN TERMS OF WAR BUT THIS TERMS
OF TRADE AND I HATE TO SAY IT IN
TERMS OF BEING SMART IN TARIFFS.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY HAS NOT BEEN
PROPERLY RECOGNIZED BUT MAYBE
SOME DAY HE WILL.
IT ALSO GAVE YOU -- A GENERAL
WHO WAS INCREDIBLE.
HE DRANK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH.
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT
RIGHT.
SO ROBERT E. LEE WAS A GREAT
GENERAL.
HE COULDN'T
BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.
HE WAS GOING CRAZY.
ROBERT E. LEE WAS WINNING BATTLE
AFTER BATTLE AFTER BATTLE.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN CAME HOME AND
SAID I CAN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.
HE HAD ALL OF THESE GENERALS.
THEY LOOKED GREAT, THEY WERE THE
TOP OF THEIR CLASS AT WEST
POINT.
THEY WERE THE GREATEST PEOPLE.
THERE IS ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THEY
DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE TO WIN.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW AND ONE DAY
IT WAS LOOKING REALLY BAD AND
LINCOLN JUST SAID -- YOU --
HARDLY KNEW HIS NAME.
AND THEY SAID DON'T TAKE HIM.
HE'S GOT A DRINKING PROBLEM.
AND LINCOLN SAID I DON'T CARE
WHAT PROBLEM HE HAS, YOU GUYS
AREN'T WINNING.
AND HIS NAME WAS GRANT.
GENERAL GRANT.
AND HE WENT IN AND HE
KNOCKED THE OUT OF EVERY
WIN.
AND YOU KNOW THIS STORY, THEY
SAID TO LINCOLN, YOU CAN'T USE
HIM ANYMORE.
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.
AND LINCOLN SAID, I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC, FRANKLY
GIVE ME SIX OR SEVEN MORE JUST
LIKE HIM.
HE STARTED TO WIN.
GRANT REALLY DID.
HE HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
A SERIOUS DRINKING PROBLEM BUT
MANY WAS HE A GOOD GENERAL.
AND HE'S FINALLY BEING
RECOGNIZED AS A GREAT GENERAL.
BUT -- LINCOLN HAD -- ALMOST
DEVELOP ADD PHOBIA CAUSE --
DEVELOPED A PHOBIA CAUSE HE WAS
HAVING A HARD TIME WITH A GREAT
FIGHTER AND A GREAT GENERAL WITH
ROBERT E. LEE BUT GRANT FIGURED
IT OUT AND GRANT IS A GREAT
GENERAL AND GRANT CAME FROM
RIGHT HERE.
OHIO IS THE STATE THAT GAVE US
THE WRIGHT BROTHERS.
IT GAVE US NEAL ARMSTRONG.
HE'S THE MAN THAT PLANTED THE
FLAG.
THINK OF THAT, ON THE FACE OF
THE MOON.
A RELATIVE -- THAT'S NICE.
THEY WEREN'T WORRIED ABOUT NOT
PLANTING A FLAG, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW -- HE PLANTED THAT FLAG
THAT AMERICAN FLAG RIGHT ON THE
FACE OF THE MOON.
IT WAS NO KNEELING, THERE WAS NO
NOTHING.
THERE WAS NO GAMES.
THERE WAS NO GAMES.
BOOM.
BOOM, RIGHT?
RIGHT, FELLAS.
MY MILITARY GUYS UP HERE.
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
MY MILITARY FOLKS ALL OVER THIS
ARENA AND HOW DO YOU LIKE THE
FACT THAT THE VA THOUSAND HAS
CHOICES RIGHT?
I SAID IT -- BUT YOU KNOW, I
SKIP OVER IT FOR 44 YEARS I'VE
BEEN TRYING TO GET CHOICE AND WE
GOT IT DONE.
THAT MEANS -- INSTEAD OF WAITING
FOR TEN DAYS OR FIVE DAYS OR 202
DAYS OR 33 DAYS, OR TWO MONTHS,
OUR GREAT VETERANS, SOME OF THEM
WOULD BE FINE.
JUST NOT FEELING SO GOOD BY THE
TIME THEY SAW THE DOCTOR.
IT TOOK SO LONG.
THEY WOULD HAVE A TERMINAL
ILLNESS.
THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS.
AND I GOT DONE WHAT THEY HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR 44 YEARS I
THINK.
44 YEARS.
NOW WHEN THEY HAVE TO WAIT --
THEY GO OUT, THEY GET THE
SERVICES OF A GOOD PRIVATE
DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY
ARE ALL BETTER AND THAT'S NICE.
44 YEARS.
TOOK 44 YEARS TO GET THAT DONE.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT CAUSE I SEE
THESE GREAT MILITARY GUYS.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH APPRECIATED
FELLAS, RIGHT?
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.
ITS MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY
HAPPY.
PROBABLY COST US LESS MONEY.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT IN THIS
CASE.
I CARE ABOUT TAKING CARE OF OUR
VETERANS.
ITS ABOUT TIME.
GENERATIONS OF OHIO WORKERS FARM
THE FIELDS, POURED THE
INCREDIBLE STEEL, FOUGHT THE
BATTLES THAT MADE AMERICA INTO
THE MOST POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS
NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD.
WE LOST OUR WAY BUT NOW WE HAVE
GAINED OUR WAY BACK AGAIN.
BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER
THAN EVER BEFORE.
THAT ---ED THEY DID NOT SHED
THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS SO
WE COULD SIT AT HOME WHILE
OTHERS TRIED TO ERASE THEIR
LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR PROUD
AMERICAN HERITAGE.
WE DIDN'T DO THAT.
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR FREEDOM AND
OUR CHILDREN WE ARE GOING WORK,
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT AND WE ARE
GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN.
THAT IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO DO
IS WIN.
WE WILL NOT BEND.
WE WILL NOT BREAK.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN.
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP.
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN.
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER.
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO
VICTORY.
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICANS AND OUR
HEARTS BLEED RED, WHITE AND
BLUE.
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY,
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER
GOD.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
THANK YOU, OHIO.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
WE JUST
HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP AT RALLY
IN LEBANON, OHIO.
HE IS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THERE.
HE ALSO HAD LOTS OF NEGATIVE
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE
DEMOCRATS.
CALLING THEM BAD PEOPLE.
HE SAID I'VE BEEN GOING AROUND
SAYING THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE
THE PARTY OF CRIME AND NO ONE
CHALLENGES ME.
NOT EVEN THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA.
I'M GOING TO GO TO MAJOR
GARRETT.
MAJOR, THANKS FOR BEING WITH ME.
IT SEEMS THE PRESIDENT IS
DOUBLING DOWN ON -- AS AN ANGRY
MOB, RADICAL MOB.
IS THIS A STRATEGY THAT SEEMS TO
BE WORKING?
>> WELL, LETS TALK ABOUT WHERE
WE ARE.
WE ARE IN LEBANON, OHIO.
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?
WARREN COUNTY IS ONE OF THE MOST
RELIABLY REPUBLICAN COUNTIES IN
THE STATE OF OHIO.
I HAD TO LOOK IT UP.
IN EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,
SINCE 1872, BUT ONE WARREN
COUNTY HAS VOTED FOR THE
REPUBLICAN.
ONE EXCEPTION, 1964 WHEN LYNDON
JOHNSON WON LANDSLIDE VICTORY
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
WHY AM I POINTING THAT OUT?
BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHY TELLS US
NOW THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS
MESSAGE HE REFERRED IS HAVING TO
BE TAKE ON THE REPUBLICAN
STRONGHOLDS TO BUILD REPUBLICAN
TURN OUT.
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?
WHEN I TRAVELLED WITH CANDIDATE
TRUMP IN 2016 IN OHIO, WHICH HE
WON HANDEDLY, WE DID NOT SPEND
ANYTIME IN PLACES LIKE WARREN
COUNTY.
REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD WHERE.
WHERE WERE WE?
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE.
DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS NEAR
CLEVELAND, AKRON, AND THE LIKE.
WHY IS ALL THIS IMPORTANT?
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP KNOWS BY
BEING HERE IN WARREN COUNTY THAT
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM IS STILL
LAGGING.
HE'S DEVOTING TIME AND ENERGY IN
A PLACE THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE
FIRED UP AS A LONG STANDING
REPUBLICAN COUNTY IN OHIO.
BUT BECAUSE HE'S HERE THAT TELLS
US EVERYBODY ITS NOT FIRED UP
ENOUGH.
AND HE'S NOT GOING TO DEMOCRATIC
STRONGHOLDS AS HE DID IN 2016 TO
TAKE DEMOCRATIC VOTES AWAY FROM
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.
SITUATION HERE IN OHIO NOT
REALLY FAVORABLE TO THE
PRESIDENT -- A GUY NAMED JIM --
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, RUNNING FOR
THE UNITED STATES SENATE AGAINST
DEMOCRAT BROWN.
TRAILING BY 10 OR 15 POINTS.
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE TRAILING
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE BY 6
POINTS IN THE MOST RECENT
POINTS.
AMID ALL THIS THUNDERING RACKET
AT A VERY LARGE CROWD AND
ENTHUSIASTIC, THIS TRIP TELLS
YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT'S NOT
HAPPENING IN OHIO FOR
REPUBLICANS THAN IT TELLS YOU
ABOUT HOW SUCCESSFUL THE
PRESIDENT ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PARTY
MESSAGE IS.
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IF YOU
ARE TRYING TO TALK TO ME, THE
NEXT 30 SECONDS IT WILL BE VERY
HARD FOR ME TO HEAR BUT I WILL
DO MY BEST.
>> I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU FEEL IN
THAT CROWD.
DEFINITE AF -- DEFINITELY HE
STARTED
OUT DRAWING NEGATIVE ATTENTION
TO THE MEDIA.
WHAT IS THE RESPONSE YOU HAVE
BEEN GETTING FROM THE CROWD?
>> WELL THAT'S A -- I'VE BEEN TO
NEARLY 100 -- ATTACKING THE
IMMEDIATE SAYING THE MEDIA
DOESN'T GIVE A FAIR SHAKE, THAT
IS -- THE ROUTINE OF THE SORT OF
CONSTANT REPETITIVE MESSAGING AT
TRUMP RALLIES.
IT HAS ITS OWN SORT OF VITALITY
FOR TRUMP SUPPORTERS.
THEY GET IT, THEY LAUGH AT IT.
I WOULD SAY THE THINGS THAT ARE
MOST IMPORTANT AT THIS RALLY,
THIS PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE DID
DURING THE CAMPAIGN STILL
RUNNING AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON,
NOTHING FIRED THIS AUDIENCE UP
MORE THAN ANTI-HILLARY CLINTON
RHETORIC.
AND HUGE ROARING CHANTS WERE
THUNDEROUS.
NOT ONLY BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
ARRIVED BUT DURING HIS
