WE HAD A WRESTLER ON WHO ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING A MAYOR IN TENNESSEE. WE'LL SEE. BY THE WAY, A NEW REPORT OUT THIS PAST YEAR ON AVERAGE, A LOT OF COUNTRIES VOTED WERE THE UNITED STATES ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TIME. THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI HALEY SAID THAT'S NOT A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IS IT TIME TO RETHINK OUR FRIENDS OR PULL SOME AID? ONE OF THE BRAVEST PEOPLE I KNOW. SHE'S GOES BACK ON THE VERY PEOPLE THAT HATE HER. WE ADMIRE HER. GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SHE'S NOT SAYING PAY TO PLAY BUT DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. WE WON'T PLAY IT WITH YOU ANYMORE. IT'S IMPORTANT. IN A REAL DEMOCRACY, YOU DON'T WANT PAY TO PLAY. THE U.N. IS NOT A REAL DEMOCRACY. THEY HAVE VOTES. THE MORE USEFUL ILLUSTRATION OR EXAMPLE IS THE U.N. IS AN ANIMAL FARM. IT'S A COLLECTIVE. THIS IS CALLING OUT MAINLY DICTATORSHIPS, BADLY RULED STATES THAT VOTE NOT ONLY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES BUT AGAINST THE THINGS WE STAND FOR, AGAINST THE FREE WORLD. Neil: THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, RIGHT? IT IS. IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE THE U.S. AMBASSADOR CALLING THEM OUT. IT'S A GOOD THING FOR AMERICA TO TELL THE WORLD WE'RE NOT INTERESTING IN SUBSIDIZING COUNTRIES THAT VOTE AGAINST US, Neil: LOOK, WE HELP A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES. THEY COME BACK AND ZOOM US. YES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY NO, THE U.S. IS NOT INTERESTING IN BEING YOUR CHIEF CHUMP. Neil: SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ACT ON THAT? POSSIBLY NOT A LOT. CHINA IS CHANGING THINGS. IT'S DIFFICULT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR VOTES. THE MESSAGE, WHAT YOU MAY SUCCEED IN DOING IS SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT THE U.S. IS NOT INTERESTED IN BEING PLAYED ANYMORE. WE'VE WISED UP. THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND. FOR INSTANCE, NORTH KOREA TO TAKE NOTE. WE'RE NOT SO EASILY FOOLED. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS DOING I THINK ITS BEST NOT TO BE LIKE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHICH SIGNED ON TO THE TERRIBLE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN THAT PINNED THAT SIGN, "KICK ME." Neil: WHAT HAPPENS IF HE NIXS THAT AND STARTS FROM SCRATCH? WE'LL BE FACING REALITY. IT HAS ITS USES. LET'S LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM. THIS DEAL IS NEVER GOING TO STOP IRAN FROM GETTING THE BOMB. I HOPE A SIMILAR CLEAR-EYED VISION GOES TO NORTH KOREA. Neil: WE'RE GETTING REPORTS THAT NORTH KOREA HAS RELEASED THREE AMERICAN CITIZENS. THIS WAS PART OF WHAT OUR LIST OF INTERESTS WERE IN GOING TO NORTH KOREA. THEY'RE ALREADY LOOKING TO RELEASE THEM NOW. I WOULD READ NOTHING INTO IT. THE PROBLEM IS, NORTH KOREA CAN COLLECT MORE HOSTAGES ANY TIME. THEY HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR YEARS. Neil: BUT THIS ON TOP OF SAYING YEAH, WE'RE OPEN UP TO DENUCLEARIZATION. YEAH, WE WANT TO CEASE HOSTILITIES WITH THE SOUTH. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? THEY WERE DUE TO COME BACK AND TRY TO COLLECT WHATEVER THEY COULD. Neil: BUT THIS IS A 180. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SAME GUY HERE. THEY'RE PREPARING TO GAME US. THAT'S WHY I WAS SAYING, IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE SENDING THE MESSAGE WE WON'T BE. AS QUICKLY AS THEY FLIPPED AROUND FROM TESTING A HYDROGEN BOMB EIGHT MONTHS AGO TO NOW WALKING HAND AND HAND WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, THEY CAN FLIP THE OTHER WAY. UNFORTUNATELY THE RECORD IS THAT NORTH KOREA CUTS THESE MARVELOUS DEALS, WE CELEBRATE. THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. THEN THEY BEGIN RENEGOTIATING, CHEATING. THAT'S THE DANGER HERE. Neil: A WIDE-EYED REAL LIST. THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS NOT CONFIRMING THIS TALK THAT IS BREAKING NOW THAT THREE AMERICAN PRISONERS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD IN NORTH KOREA, SOME FOR A NUMBER
