1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,623
- Even after being nailed by the car,

2
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm not gonna stop.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,080
If I get hurt enough,
maybe that'll deter me

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,380
from being so enthusiastic about it,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,231
but until that day comes,

6
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:19,890
it's still the coolest thing
I could possibly think of

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,288
going and doing on a Sunday.

8
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:38,480
It's fun, and it's fun
to be a part of the race

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,120
'cause if we screw it up,

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,820
we screw up where the
car finishes essentially.

11
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,900
So it makes it that much more fun

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,040
'cause you're actually part of it.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,050
It's not just the driver at that point.

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,310
The crew has a say-so in what's going on.

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,460
What does it take to be that guy?

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,420
Bottom line, it takes

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,420
dedication, concentration,
obviously the will to

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,180
put yourself in that kind
of harm's environment

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,680
and being able to handle, let's call it,

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,010
high-pressure environments.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,210
That's a good way to describe that.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,380
I wear a heart monitor,

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,150
and you're totally calm
and cool as a cucumber

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,550
and then when you know
you're 10 seconds out,

25
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,230
your heart rate increases.

26
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,610
It's crazy.

27
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,380
And you get done and you're pretty high

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,850
for, you know, 40 seconds,

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,100
then you come back down to reality,

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,470
like okay, that was it.

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,470
Now we wait around for the next one, ha.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,820
Everybody's kind of at risk, for sure.

33
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,060
The fueler especially is at risk

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,340
'cause he's got a big
giant fuel hose in his hand

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,020
that's pumping a lot of gallons per second

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,280
and if that malfunctions and breaks,

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,780
he's gonna be doused in
a very flammable liquid

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,810
and has the potential to go up in flames.

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,070
It's happened before.

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,800
Inside front, me, I'm in a prime position

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,760
to be hit by the car, for sure

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,460
because I've got a wall behind me

43
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,150
and nowhere to go, essentially.

44
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,510
So if the driver screws
up coming into the box,

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,080
normally, I can get pummeled pretty well.

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,143
No one's safe.

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,790
It was our first stop of the race.

48
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,600
Kyle was a rookie this year.

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,550
He just made a small mistake and locked up

50
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,910
and basically, once the car
was 10, 12 feet away from me,

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,890
like, I knew it was coming.

52
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,320
And in the video, you can see me

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,380
kind of hesitate a little
bit, but car made contact.

54
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,150
I instantly stood up, I didn't
feel anything was wrong,

55
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,420
and we finished the pit
stop and that was it.

56
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:38,251
Once I got over the wall,
then reality kind of set in,

57
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,815
like, wow, you know, I
just got hit by the car.

58
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,830
Medical came over and
made sure I was okay.

59
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,500
Then team management made
sure I was all right.

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,000
Indy Car made sure I was okay.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,100
I felt fine, I stayed in it.

62
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,990
I didn't wanna stop, it's the Indy 500.

63
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,630
I think you just have to,

64
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,790
you have to keep it in
the back of your head.

65
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,020
You know, I know there's people out there

66
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,860
that have done this for years
that have never been hurt

67
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,106
and that's a good thing.

68
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:02,560
And then I've worked with people

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,880
who have been severely
hurt to the point where

70
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,810
three years later,
they're still doing rehab

71
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,540
and reconstructive surgeries
and pins and screws

72
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,960
and they're not going
over the wall anymore,

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,793
they don't want to.

74
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,060
If we do three pit stops in a race,

75
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,210
and the race is two and
a half hours long, that

76
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,590
that 30 seconds of work that
we did throughout the race

77
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
is worth every ounce of
stress and frustration

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,151
and being tired and long
hours and this and that.

79
00:03:33,151 --> 00:00:00,000
That 30 seconds is
totally worth everything.
