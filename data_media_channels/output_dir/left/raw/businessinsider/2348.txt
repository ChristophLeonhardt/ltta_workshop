welcome back we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,039
about some of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who made a big</font>

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,080
difference in 2009 we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a lot of</font>

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,939
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of the big falls from</font>

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,308
grace fees right well I think Ken Lewis

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,350
has to be at the top of the list of the

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,070
fall from grace he was smiling so<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide a</font>

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,329
year ago he had finally accomplished one

13
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,460
of his primary goals which was to

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,570
capture acquire a major Wall Street firm

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,579
he won banker<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year he</font>

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,640
was banker<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year he was widely</font>

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,129
considered it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the victory of the</font>

18
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys from Charlotte over Wall Street</font>

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,969
right bank of america had acquired

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:02,039
merrill lynch this was you know a major

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,150
thing and but both what we learned about

22
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquisition afterwards and the</font>

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,360
constant pressure he had put on him from

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,659
journalists but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also from politicians</font>

25
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,830
basically how did him out of office and

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,420
you know he went up to the mountains

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,280
grew a beard came back at a couple days

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,430
later he surprised his own board by

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,799
saying you know that's it I'm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,990

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,450
investment banking business of merrill

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,820
lynch and bank of america I mean he had

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone in a way from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chief</font>

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,270
executive to be under that but he was

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,159
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run a bigger operation he</font>

39
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,430
seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to do it and he you know</font>

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,350
less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how did out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

41

42
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:58,020
bosses were so much greater than anybody

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew bank of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> america thought it was</font>

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,960
acquiring a relatively healthy you know

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,969
bank in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a run on banks</font>

46
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:07,740
what it learned was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,068
acquired an insolvent institution

48
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,739
that had you know epic<font color="#CCCCCC"> size losses and</font>

49
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,519
was paying its employees billions in

50
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,379
bonuses so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big winner of the year i</font>

51
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,540
guess the consensus that this was jamie

52
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,329
diamonds here jamie dimon uh is it

53
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,040
deserved I mean he really do anything

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,230
that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say special you know he</font>

55
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,819
did he didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

56
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,099
right what made him the banker that

57
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,530
there was actually something<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did a</font>

58
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,169
few years ago which was he started to

59
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,280
get worried about some of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,900
CDOs and mortgage backed securities that

61
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,419
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his colleagues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were had been</font>

62
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:47,250
buying in<font color="#E5E5E5"> big time this is ironic</font>

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,439
because JP Morgan had played a leading

64
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,389
role in putting together and marketing a

65
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,579
lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> products for a long time he</font>

66
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,049
pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> them back and that's one of the</font>

67
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,909
reasons they did not suffer the kinds of

68
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">losses we saw at Citigroup at bank of</font>

69
00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:02,879
america and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their large rivals wells</font>

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,370
fargo and they they were much less

71
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,049
exposed to the US mortgage market than

72
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,189
anybody else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think he does deserve</font>

73
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,109
beggar of these so real quickly give me

74
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,489
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of names to watch out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

75
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,090
2010 i would say Bob McCann take you

76
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,159
over UBS that's going to be a big deal

77
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's setting up for the brokerage war of</font>

78
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,009
2010 between the UBS painewebber guys

79
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,720
the Merrill Lynch guys and then of

80
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we have the wealth management</font>

81
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">team of Morgan Stanley which had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>
