and a serious one and there will be less serious ones later but several surprises I've just surprised in one of the stories as well involving an Admiral I suspect that one of your surprises regarding a colonel all right the civil war in Yemen continues to claimed the lives of civilians in fact most of the casualties are civilians and one of the latest bombings by the saudi-backed coalition went after a bus that had children in it and according to reports at least 40 children have been killed and 30 wounded in the saudi-led coalition airstrike in Yemen I want to be clear that the bombs that are being used in these civilian attacks are made by the United States they're supplied by the United States the intelligence that the saudi-led coalition is receiving is from the United States so this is important because the u.s. is very much aware of what's going on very much part of what's going on in Yemen and again the majority of the casualties so far have been civilians many of which are children so the charities Save the Children said it had been told by its staff that the children were on their way back to school from a picnic when the driver of the bus stopped to get a drink now one of more it was one of more than 50 airstrikes against civilian vehicles by the saudi-led Coalition in Yemen so far this year so this civil war has been going on since 2015 it it began with the Houthi rebels who are rebelling against the Yemeni government and Saudi Arabia is essentially leading the charge in trying to maintain the government there the government control so things are getting bad there's famine a severe hunger cholera outbreak it just keeps getting worse and the United States is not only complicit but involved in what's happening okay so a little bit of background and then some extra details here that are particularly disturbing and also a little too familiar so the background is that the Houthis are Shia and people suspect probably very rightfully so that they're backed by Iran whereas the rest of Yemen roughly speaking that they are fighting against the former government we're Sunni backed by the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates is the second biggest part of that so-called coalition and and a bunch of other smaller Gulf states so it is a little bit of a Sunni Shia war and a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran we are on the side of Saudi Arabia why I guess they have more oil and they're more friendly to us they're more friendly to Israel and so we unfortunately aid and abet this war and in fact to his credit congressman Ted Lou said we should look to see if we're refueling the planes that are bombing children and whether we're aiding and abetting in war crimes and I think that's a fair point and fair question so uh I want to actually warn you guys before we go to video that these videos are graphic but it gives you a sense of what the scene was like after this recent bombing of this bus and again if you get queasy you don't want to see it fair warning before we go to the videos but it's b-roll so Jing feel free to talk over it let's take a look so there it is that's after the bombing that's what the bus looked like again forty children died as a result of this bombing and it's just it's it's incredible not only considering how the u.s. is involved in this there's very little coverage of it no one talks about it but also the type of commentary you get from Trump officials like the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo days after this happened he is on the record saying all these complimentary things about Saudi Arabia which we'll get to in just a minute but I want to also note that this bus was hit at a market in the northern province of sada and also the coalition which is backing Yemen's government in the war said that these actions are legitimate so they're standing by these actions they think that this is fine yeah I want to give you more background on that - so colonel turkey al-malki who is apparently the coalition spokesperson said that it was quote illegitimate military action conducted in conformity with international humanitarian law really international humanitarian losses you are allowed to incinerate a bus with schoolchildren on it I'm pretty sure that's not what international humanitarian law says then they say well don't worry we are referring this to our internal review that the Saudis conduct preposterous so you're gonna be shocked to find out that the Saudis when conducting reviews of their own military have decided that they are almost always innocent Wow out of 75 cases in only two instances that they find any slight wrongdoing the other times it where they were killing civilly is time after time after time they saw that it was fine by the way at least fifty five civilians were killed last week and 170 others were wounded in a series of attacks so this is from this particular attack but it keeps on going in fact ten thousand people including one-third of them civilians have been killed fifty-five thousand others injured in the fighting according to the United Nations now there's also a partial blockade that has left 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid it is the largest food security emergency in the world and now we have a record-breaking cholera outbreak affecting more than a million people something the world has never seen before so all of this and reporters on the scene in Yemen local reporters took pictures of missile parts that seem to indicate that they were made by Raytheon now that shouldn't be surprising we sell the Saudis most of their weapons so way we made a buck off those kids being murdered and I suppose Donald Trump is proud of that and to be fair to Trump almost all the US government's back saturday Rabia in my lifetime they're democratic or republican as long as they keep that oil flowing apparently you get to hit little kids I remember Trump pretending to be upset when kids were killed in a Syria bombing and then he bombed Syria and returned that was a one time he has super positive press coverage they were like wait a bomb yes military now these kids are dead and I don't see Trump holding a press conference about what about the children as he did in Syria because it's our side during the bombing and Kellee of the children so no tweets on it we use that amazing.we aid and abet and and that's what you're seeing here right now these are kids again the majority of the casualties in this civil war are civilians these are not people who are causing any trouble they're living their lives in this horrible situation and they're getting targeted by individuals who think that it's legitimate to target them by the way I want to go back to what I had mentioned before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his comments in regard to Saudi Arabia days after this bombing took place let's go to graphic eight he said according to CNN speaking by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman a few days after the attack Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked the Crown Prince for Saudi Arabia's support for northeast Syria's urgent stabilization needs its engagement with the Iraqi government and it's offered to help Iraq address its water and electricity shortages Pompeyo reportedly never mentioned the bombing yes of course not because they're thrilled that there were thereby more weapons and they're hitting what they perceived to be an ally of Iran and trumps in the middle was trying to start a war with Iran to begin with so this is not the bug it's a feature and and in terms of the military coalition the Saudi coalition here no they said that they meant to hit the kids they said oh the the terrorists were gonna use the kids and bring them to a training ground no it turns out you know what they were doing they had come from a picnic they were a lot of them were dressed in in school uniforms because they're kids and they were going to a cemetery now that's a weird place why were they going to a cemetery it's one of the few places that had green grass left because the war has obliterated the country so they were on their way I don't know if they would have been bombed even if the guy had not stopped for a drink but apparently so because they the Saudis admit they targeted it and now they go to the old bag of tricks unfortunately reminds me of what the Israelis say and other ally of ours that continue to target civilians and kill them the spokesperson accused the rebels of using children as tools and covers for their terrorist acts in other words we had to murder the children the other guys made us do it well is one way you could have avoided it by not actually bombing a bus full of kids so whatever it's Israel or Saturday Arabia or any one of our so-called allies that kill civilians they're number one go to movies oh they were being used as certain shields or they had it coming but it's not me it's other side that made me drop a bomb on them no nobody made you drop a bomb the Saudis did it on purpose because they have been vicious in this war so there's one other part of this story that I want to address and you know oftentimes when we talk about terrorism when we talk about hostility Muslim hostility toward the United States or the Western world there is an emphasis on the religion as opposed to actions foreign policy actions that we've taken that the Western world has taken that leads to those hostilities and people don't like to talk about this they get uncomfortable but it's the truth now if you are a parent and your child was targeted and killed in a bombing like that would you feel angry at the country that sanctioned that bombing that then turned around and said that that bombing was legitimate you would right and so when I see videos like this and to be fair this is a video from 2012 in regard to Islamic terrorism okay I get frustrated because it is a very short-sighted black-and-white you know non it's a lecture way of looking at things so again this is a video from Morning Joe in 2012 in regard to radical Islamic you know terrorism take a look and you know why they hate us yeah I talked intelligence people all weekend they hate us because of their religion they hate us because of their cult room they hate us because of peer pressure then you talk to any intelligence person they will tell you that's the same thing and all these people that think we're gonna go over there and change them and make them hate us less or they're just just naive and if you gave every street vendor from street vendor to prime minister and that region a chance to throw a rock at the US Embassy they would so Joe Scarborough famously said that Muslims hate us because they hate us I would argue that some of them hate us because we keep bombing them or assisting other countries in bombing them and killing their children and killing their civilians we have to think about how actions do have consequences you can't just kill innocent people abroad and think that they're not gonna want to retaliate and I'm not saying that to justify any type of terrorism but I'm saying that we need to really think about what our foreign policy is how am I not supposed to call that stupid so which Muslims the Houthis who are the Shia Muslims who are being massacred at times by our allies the Saudis who are also Muslim wait are we did are we in favor of our allies we sell down weapons there Muslim okay do the Houthis hate us because we randomly or maybe because we sold missiles to Saudi Arabia that use it to kill their kids and which ones are we talking about this year the Sunni perhaps it might depend on context that the ones that we're killing might hate us partly because we're killing them or helping to kill them and maybe sometimes through other Muslims sometimes us directly sometimes other allies like Israel Britain France etc but to say oh no no I'm not gonna take any geopolitical considerations into effect into consideration and I'm not going to say hey it says I have to figure out is as soon mushiya in the Iraq war by the way the Saudis paid for the Sunni insurgency that got our troops killed why cuz they didn't want our troops near them is it because of that geopolitical considerations because they hate us now this guy's against Trump Joe Scarborough yes but he's just as shallow and vapid maybe he's not as mentally unstable and he's not quite as dumb right but he makes these stupid shallow arguments about the haters because they hate us look Jake to be fair he does have an intelligent rebuttal to that so let's hear from him yeah just like you said oh you know they hate us because of waterboarding no they don't they hate us because they hate us they hate us because of Obama's drone attacks no they don't they hate us because they hate us they hate us because somebody burned a Quran no they don't they hate us because they hate us they hate us because of this crude film no they don't they hate us because they hate us and any US politician that thinks they're going to go in and transform the region and stop people from hating us because they hate us or absolute fools this incredibly simplistic argument I got this figured out guys I got this figured out they hate us because wait for it they hate us and he caused other people fools Hey look Anna look the Germans hate us man I mean how many war wars do we have to do with them world war one world war two they hate us cuz they hate us it's to go in there and try to get them to be our allies the Germans then Germans we had to fight two world wars against them they're never gonna be our allies oops it turns out if you do the Marshall Plan where you actually have a smart strategy where you reach out to people it works but Joe should we learn from the most successful foreign policy endeavor in American history no no I got this no let's not do Marshall Plan let's not reach out to anyone let's not have a smart strategy one that has worked before instead the ghost goes they hate us because they hate us there's nothing we could do just bomb and discriminately and then blame it on them yeah I got a job wow you're so much smarter than Trump and by the way if you you want to you know build allies and and relationships with other countries that's one thing but to think that it's okay to do these drone strikes that disproportionately kill civilians I mean to think that's okay and that it has no consequences what world are you living in just take a second to put yourself in the shoes of someone who lost their child lost their family members because of this nonsense you're not gonna be angry about that okay last thing you know what the largest Muslim country in the world is if you're Young Turks audience you're smart knowledgeable I think 80 percent of you went to college according to the numbers I saw that's amazing so some of you might know but I suspect that a lot of people don't know it's the one that I mean they they man we got non-stop troubles with them you know who they are Indonesia so why is Indonesia not doing any bombings of us why is there no attacks pretty much at all against America from Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world oh right because we didn't bomb Indonesia blowback from the countries that we continually invade and bomb and terrorize they hate us because they hate us then why don't they no need just hate us that much Oh total utter fool all right we gotta take a break when we come back we're gonna take it back to the US and some domestic policies will stick around you're right in the middle of this podcast we got another great segment coming up for you if you'd like to full show which is actually five segments go to tea white tea network.com slash join you become a member you support the show you support independent media and you get the whole two-hour show ad free every day let's go do it now I'm back on The Young Turks Genk and Anna with you guys a couple tweets for you that boys hell on turrets writes in how do the trumpets feel about Yemen I think Corey Lewandowski summed it up with womp womp probably right as Stephen McMahon McCallum writes in Israel bombed hospitals and schools under the same exact pretext in 2014 the West didn't bat an eyelid then neither did Dave Rubin no I'm sorry he didn't okay and they certainly won't now in fact is an allied to the US has immunity to commit crimes without facing consequences open others to do the same ie Syria and Russia that's right and last one Alex Pierce says perhaps we should prosecute weapons manufacturers who knowingly sell government to governments that kill civilians our government doesn't want that though are you kidding me that and they couldn't sell to anyone that's not true actually there's great countries that that don't use their weapons to murder civilians and sometimes use it as deterrent but the whole point of weapons is to kill people so keep it real both missiles that Raytheon sells and guns at home okay all right yesterday it was reported that Donald Trump revoked the security clearance for for John benta yesterday was reported that Trump had revoked the security clearance for John Brennan he was a security adviser under the Obama administration but he's been very outspoken against Trump and the way that it's been essentially portrayed because it's accurate is that Trump is now retaliating against those who are openly criticizing him on Twitter and so that happened and it's interesting to see the responses from various people now Trump has gotten criticism from the right and the left in in revoking the security clearance here but I want to give you an example of one individual who thought that it was a good idea to take the security clearance away from Brennan and that person is Army Brigadier General former Army Brigadier General Anthony Teta take a look you hear Brendan's comments you just think they're inappropriate even though he's hired to give his opinion yeah Brian I don't think it has anything to do with his comments I think that John Brennan is a clear and present danger and a threat to this nation he supports the overthrow of this particular president he needed to have his access information revoked and in question 29 on the security clearance form says you know have you ever supported overthrowing the US government you all you got to do is look at Brennan's tweets and he supports the removal of this president and right there that's enough evidence to get rid of his clearance by the way I think I said that Brendan was a security adviser he was a former CIA director under the Obama administration just to clarify that so there you have you know Anthony Teta saying no no this makes all the sense in the world you can't be criticizing Trump you can't be calling to overthrow him now he never said that he wants to overthrow trunk but he has questioned Trump's fitness for office like his mental fitness whether or not he has what it takes to be President because he's made a lot of bad decisions so far no criticizing the president is not anywhere near trying to overthrow him right that's mental so for example I credit criticized not only President Bush President Trump but President Obama all the time did I want to overthrow him no I didn't want to overthrow Obama I just didn't want him doing signature strikes against civilians I didn't want him drilling in the Gulf that doesn't mean I wanted you coup against them that's insanity no this is crazy especially considering the fact that we are in the midst of a free speech debates throughout the country this is an actual issue regarding free speech you have a government official the President of the United States retaliating against the free speech of a former CIA director the CIA director is criticizing him on Twitter and Trump can't take it so he retaliates by taking away his security clearance and by the way Trump's an idiot so he can't help himself he does an interview with The Wall Street Journal and he's very clear about the reason why he revoked security clearance from he says that it was because of Russia the Russia investigation says I call it the rigged witch hunt it's it is a sham so I think it is something that had to be done meaning revoking security clearance I just don't trust any many of those people on that list remember they're considering revoking security clearance for more people I think that they're very duplicitous I find it hard to believe he knows that word I think they're not good people that's more like okay yeah not good people okay but before we get to your commentary jank TYT has a history with anthony Teta and that's the main reason why i wanted to do this story I'm gonna keep it real this video is the best video of all time Jake interviewed him in 2009 and it was fantastic when I began it with Brigadier General retired Anthony tanta he's also the author of rogue threat general Tata welcome to The Young Turks hi how are you guys doing that's Keita actually it's a was good Italian name so and it's you go by general tater I go by Tony okay by the way when I read this to her this morning I literally read it as brigadier general Anthony Tata still I forgot I mean I remember the tape and I forgot that it was pronounced data and that was the whole point of why that was funny anyway so I always it is the most ironic thing in the world I live in a glass house on how to pronounce names right his name is spelled ta ta its Tata Boehner come on it's Boehner but it's okay it's okay you want to pronounce a certain it was my bad I was the guest book I should have asked him for confirmation on the spelling of his letter the pronunciation of his last name right okay so back back to Brennan for a second I love the Trump administration's excuses they said that they had to do this because of Brennan's quote erratic conduct and behavior really I mean it wasn't about glass house really but I'm not done yet he also said that it was because of his lying and recent conduct characterized by increasingly frenzied commentary are you kidding me how do you say that with a straight face working for Donald Trump increasingly frenzied commentary lying then erratic conduct and behavior so let me be clear about something this story about revoking security clearance broke yesterday and that was the official response from the Trump administration yesterday and then Trump who just can't keep his story straight has this interview at the Wall Street Journal he's like yeah it was over Russia like he keeps criticizing me over this Russia thing and I don't like it okay not good people like you can't help himself he can't help himself John Brennan said quote I clearly think mr. Trump is getting more and more concerned more and more desperate more and more frightened in regard to the Russia investigation and that is definitely clear based on his actions so he was a director of the Central Intelligence Agency his job was to collect intelligence if you can't figure out that Trump was getting more and more desperate well then you weren't very good at collecting intelligence he's stating things that are super obvious but it's under Trump's skin and look understand the context I'm no friend a fan of Brennan I'm not in the camp of the mainstream media who now whitewashes Brennan and Hayden and all those guys who worked in the intelligence community before and would say outrageous things like oh no we are not wiretapping all Americans and later yeah okay fine we wiretap you all right and so they didn't under Bush stated under Obama and I and and I think Brennan authorized a a lot of things including the signature strikes that I was talking about earlier under Obama that I think were rendus now that doesn't mean that he's wrong about everything and it doesn't mean that we look at it in the prism oh okay are you Pro Trump or any Trump Pro Obama right right oh you have taken case by case in this case he's just saying incredibly obvious things about Trump and that's that's what's bothering Trump and it sets it sets in my opinion a dangerous precedent because you can't regardless of whether or not you like the individual who's having their security clearance taken away from them allowing the president to flex that kind of muscle is dangerous because again this is all about retaliation he's not acting in an erratic way the only person who's erratic and unstable is Trump and he doesn't like any criticism he has thin-skinned and we can't allow him to set that kind of precedent yeah and he's using national security for political purposes yeah and that's unacceptable finally I'd like to end on a fun note it's part of what I read to you earlier he said I call it the rigged winch hunt now yeah we know you called the rigged witch hunt you do it every day three times a day on Twitter but he phrases the sentence that way because he thinks it's so clever I actually did a story about this before where he was bragging to his friends I got it I got it I'm gonna call it the witch hunt Oh oh my god I got him that's not remotely clever that's like he's saying no no but I proved it because I called it the ring which ton then doesn't prove anything just you calling something a name yes he is so unbelievably stupid okay okay but there's more like I get to decide when we had mr. oh yeah that was that wasn't your last comment because this next video is one of my favorites so look to be fair you have senator Susan Collins and she's calling Trump out she's like look wait this is not okay unless there was some disclosure of classified information of which I'm aware unaware I don't see the grounds for revoking his security clearance okay but then you have the people who like to kiss Donald Trump's butt and one of those people is Senator John Kennedy and so what did he have to say about revoking Brennan's security clearance I think most Americans look at our our national intelligence experts have been above politics mr. Brennan has demonstrated that that's not the case he's been totally political I think I called him a Butthead in a minute I think he's given the national intelligence community a bad night I think I called him a buck head and I meant it and he added afterwards you know why John Kennedy saying that he actually to be fair to him because we're always way too fair that's our problem is that John Kennedy did challenge trumpet from time to time like he had sent an unqualified judge for a position that he didn't deserve and Kennedy eviscerated him in the Senate and so everybody was like whoa look at that Republican doing the right thing he's not attacking Trump he's just saying you're barely a lawyer dude I'm not gonna allow you to have this important federal judge position but my guess is he got a lot of blowback from that like how dare you oppose Trump under any circumstance so now he's like Oh Brendan he's a button he's about that hey Trump people do you like me now do you like me now I called him a dirty word soul okay uh but let's all admit that the best part of this whole story which had a lot of great parts was Anna's saying you don't decide when this story over I decide okay ten hundred Courtois another voting present your job had a job to have it be the decider oh okay I want to do one more story before we go to break so let's go wow you're the decider so obviously that's what's gonna happen yes okay all right Donald Trump wants Omarosa arrested that's one of the latest updates to this whole Omarosa secret tape secret recording debacle and scandal now I'm gonna get to where and when Donald Trump's made those statements but before I get to that I just want to note that Omarosa is slowly but surely leaking more and more and more of these tapes to the press the recent example was on MSNBC on Craig Melvin and this tape is actually in my in my opinion one of the more important tapes because it corroborates what she had alleged regarding the Trump administration trying to give her some vague nonsense job pay her a lot of money to do that job after she got fired of course in order to hush her up just to ensure that she wouldn't say anything negative about Donald Trump following her firing so what you're about to hear is Omarosa on the phone with Laura Trump who's married to Eric Trump and Laura Trump is essentially offering this position to her salary is directly donors I know you the white house and I think we can work something out where we keep you right along those specifically I really feel like your position would require you know you to be able to be flexible in terms of where you are sometimes you know come to New Yorker occasional meetings I would love if you could you know occasionally do speaking engagements sort of thing for us I think you'd be awesome doing that and so it doesn't really matter where you aren't your comfortable thing and BC so she would essentially get this weird vague job working for the campaign Trump's reelection campaign they pay her fifteen thousand dollars a month but it's very clear what this job is really about it's you know Laura Trump starts off that conversation with hey you know this New York Times Maggie Haberman article makes it seem like you got some dirt in your back pocket and you know if you work with our campaign we can't have that in this job super flexible you know it's it's it's clear what was going on there yeah I mean look if you're a Trump person you don't believe in reality so but for everyone else that's the clearest thing you've ever heard in your life it's a hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year to shut up it's you've got something in your back pocket and we and obviously we can't have that and that's why we're paying you I'm by the way there's three parts to this story one that I think some people are focusing on I don't think is that big a deal the other two I think are big so they're like oh it's it's a deal to get her to stay quiet in Washington unfortunately thing they make those deals all the time okay and I don't think that's just particularly Trump I think a lot of both parties do it I know that the mainstream press will be outraged by that charge but but I think that that is fairly regular course of business now on the other hand that does confirm that Omarosa does have something on them because they're not gonna offer that money on speculation like on Omarosa bluffing exactly Trump has to authorize that Trump has to tell Lara hey your trusted family go talk to amorosa offer the $180,000 because he's got something in her back pocket and it's true so all that talk about like oh no no no no I didn't say anything bad around all Mercer I'm gonna get to Trump's comment in a second so that's part two in response to this and then part three is if you're donating to Donald Trump and you're one of those small donors though they were talking about they're using your money for hush money and they told her you don't barely have to do anything a couple of speaking engagements coming to New York everyone salon that's it hundred eighty thousand dollars a year to do almost nothing that's crazy I didn't think about it that way yeah and it isn't Trump's money it isn't the Republican Party's money at the end of the day it's your money for your a Republican donor and if you're Sheldon Adelson and they robbed you I don't care at all okay you probably don't care right but if you have a small dollar donation to the Republican Party or the Donald Trump this is what they're using it for geez okay and now finally to the Trump quote apparently according to Sam Nunn burger former Trump aid he Trump sees Omarosa it's a formidable enemy he does he does and he sees her as an enemies because she is using his tactics against him yes right she knows him well she's known him for over fifteen years obviously she has numerous tapes to you know prove what she claims in her book there is something I have issues with Omarosa however there is something very refreshing about a black woman doing this to him hmm right and then also look this is the part that I consider the most troubling out of all of this right so we know that Trump wants to retaliate against those who criticize him who speak out against him revoking John Brennan's security clearance was an example of that but according to reporting in Vanity Fair Trump wants Omarosa arrested because of what's going on which is this is unacceptable so Trump told advisers that he wants Anthony I'm sorry Attorney General Jeff Sessions to have Manigault Newman arrested another Republican recounted how over the weekend Trump derailed a midterm election strategy session to rant about her betrayal in an effort to change the narrative the White House announced yesterday the Trump had revoked former CIA director John Brennan security clearance so that was done not just to retaliate but - this reporting possibly to distract people but then that story became a scandal I mean this guy is is not smart but also dangerous when it comes to you know what he wants to do - those who speak out against him two things about that one I mean considering her formidable enemy it makes sense if you're a reality show star which is what Donald Trump is if you were a serious person you'd be concerned about kim jeong-hoon or Vladimir Putin or Bashar al-assad if you're a non serious person you think like who Omarosa might beat me in the ratings she's a formidable enemy okay point - I said unbelievable as Anna was saying that they're considering arresting her but to be fair to me I'm the one who said they would right and so I guess it is believable I said they would start arresting their political opponents and people were like oh you're crazy no way they're natural-born fascists and just in the last week alone his allies like Jerry Falwell Jr I've said that Comey should be arrested Obama and Hillary Clinton should be arrested and even Attorney General Jeff Sessions should be arrested okay his own attorney general who he now Trump now wants arrest Omarosa so apparently anyone who disagrees with Trump there's somebody judge Perot talking about similar things on I can't believe I called her a judge and he had Fox News so no no these people they couldn't wait to be fascist and Trump has given them permission right oh now we start rounding people up now look if you don't talk about hey um Roe says these tapes and someone who might have been in the Situation Room and is that a national security issue I think that's a fair question and you could have a debate over that if the government says hey those tapes in particular I have an issue with okay great arrest her arrest her for what what's the crime name a crime what are we arresting her for we're arresting her coz Trump doesn't like her I mean they haven't done it yet but thisis solid reporting from inside the White House saying Trump wants to do it natural-born fascist yeah just one final quote that was reported this is by an anonymous former official she's doing everything perfect if her ultimate goal is to troll Trump yes and that's why he
