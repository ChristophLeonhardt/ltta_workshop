1
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:08,460
when you give advice to entrepreneurs

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,110
what are the three most<font color="#CCCCCC"> important things</font>

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,690
for success the first one would be you

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,040
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have passion about what you're</font>

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,550
working on by far by far by far because

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,170
almost any idea I matter how good is

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit bumps in the road they're</font>

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,230
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so painful they make you</font>

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,760
doubt whether you should go on and if

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,779
you're not absolutely passionate about

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,789
the thing you're working on you can't

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,410
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through those periods and you</font>

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,390
know Disney had those moments and I'm

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,920
sure Bill Gates had those moments and

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,899
every great company has those Apple had

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,460
those moments of course Apple had many

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">near-death experiences and because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

18
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,700
the passion of the founder he turned

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,469
that thing or so you have to have that i

20
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,059
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say off the charts you have to</font>

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,290
have integrity<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the people you work</font>

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,210
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that with your</font>

23
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,039
investors with your employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,170
transparency in that in that sense is

25
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,820
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the ultimate way to succeed</font>

26
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and finally I think you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

27
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,750
people upside so I really believe in

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,070
giving every people<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody in the</font>

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,629
company a big stake in the company so

30
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that unlocks an unusual amount of</font>

31
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,250
motivation people to actually have them

32
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,019
have an ownership stake even if it's

33
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,549
symbolic even if the Secretary has

34
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,470
options it's still huge and everybody

35
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,420
shares in the victory together and I

36
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's crucial I think most</font>

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,210
entrepreneurs do do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think any</font>

38
00:01:12,210 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">who resist that resisted at their peril</font>
