GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH THOSE.

LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE OF

14
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:22,303
THINGS.

15
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,972
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS AS 1995.

16
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,473
I UNDERSTAND HE'S MET ABOUT AN

17
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:26,808
HOUR AND A HALF TO TWO HOURS

18
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:29,477
WITH DR. FORD IN THIS PROCESS.

19
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:30,278
YOU ONLY ASK GENERAL QUESTIONS.

20
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:31,145
WE'LL GET TO THAT.

YOU ALSO DID AN INTERVIEW WITH

25
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,886
HER ABOUT ALL OF THESE

26
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,254
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE YOU

00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:39,788
ADMINISTER THE TEST.

28
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:41,489
FIRST OF ALL, HOW WERE YOU

29
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,390
APPROACHED ABOUT THE ATTACHED?

30
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,691
HOW DOES THAT WORK, WHO PAID FOR

31
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:45,026
IT?

32
00:00:45,026 --> 00:00:46,795
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MONDAY

33
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:51,800
NIGHT, AUGUST 6, I GOT A CALL

34
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,567
FROM DEBRA KATZ, I HAD DONE SOME

35
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,769
WORK FOR THEM IN THE PAST, I

36
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,204
ASKED HIM I THINK EXECUTIVE

00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:57,005
POLYGRAPH TRACKS THE NEXT DAY, I

38
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,441
SAID I COULD DO IT LATER IN THE

39
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,475
AFTERNOON, THEY HAD A CLIENT HE

40
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:04,646
WAS IN FOR OUT OF TOWN, THAT WAS

41
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,248
LEAVING EARLY IN THE

42
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:07,249
AFTERNOON.

43
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,650
ANYWAY I COULD REARRANGE MY

44
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,251
SCHEDULE.

45
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,152
I WAS ABLE TO REARRANGE MY

46
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:12,621
SCHEDULE FOR THE NEXT DAY, CALL

47
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:13,922

48
00:01:13,922 --> 00:01:15,857
IT THE NEXT MORNING COME OF THAT

49
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:17,292
IS WHEN THEY TOLD ME ABOUT THE

50
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:19,895
FACT THEY HAD A CLIENT WHO WAS

51
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:21,062
MAKING ALLEGATIONS THAT BACK IN

52
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:22,064
HIGH SCHOOL THAT SHE WAS

53
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:24,866
ASSAULTED BY BRETT KAVANAUGH.

54
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,268
WE DISCUSSED THE DETAILS THAT

55
00:01:26,268 --> 00:01:26,568
NIGHT.

56
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:29,671
WE DISCUSSED THE QUESTIONS THAT

57
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,573
WE BOTH THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE

58
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:32,140
TO ASK ANY SITUATIONS.

59
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,076
I'VE RUN IS KIND OF TESTS BEFORE

60
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,311
WITH VICTIMS AND NORMALLY WHAT

61
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:37,913
WE'LL HAVE THEM DO IS WRITE

62
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,514
OUT A STATEMENT ABOUT THE FACTS.

63
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:41,116
MY INTRODUCTION TO THIS CASE WAS

64
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:44,119
12 HOURS BEFORE I CONDUCTED THE

65
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:44,486
POLYGRAPH.

66
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:45,420
>> Shannon: DOES THE WORK THAT

67
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,788
HER LAW FORM PAYS FOR THE

68
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:47,156
SERVICES?

69
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,691
>> THAT IS JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT

70
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,460
TO MAINTAIN THAT ATTORNEY-CLIENT

71
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,228
PRIVILEGE.

72
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,364
>> Shannon: SHE, IN ADDITION

73
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,599
TO PROVIDING YOU WHAT WRITTEN

74
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,934
STATEMENT, IT TRACKS WITH THE

75
00:01:58,934 --> 00:02:00,269
FACTS WE HEARD PUBLICLY, YOU

76
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:02,104
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WITH

77
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,239
HER GIVING AN ADDITIONAL

78
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,073
INTERVIEW BEFORE YOU GOT TO THE

79
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,574
PART WHERE YOU ASK FURTHER

80
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:05,941
QUESTIONS.

81
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,742
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A FEW OF

82
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:08,744
THE THINGS THAT WERE IN YOUR

83
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:09,078
SUMMARY.

84
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,645
IN THE SUMMATION AT ONE POINT,

85
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:13,616
YOU SAY SHE STATES MARK WAS

86
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,683
LAUGHING, AND COAXING KAVANAUGH

87
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:15,050
ON.

88
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,018
A PERIOD WHERE SHE SAYS

89
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,920
KAVANAUGH WAS ON TOP OF HER.

90
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,954
SHE RECALLS MAKING EYE CONTACT

91
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:21,057
WITH MARK AND THINKING HE MAY

92
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,024
HELP HER.

93
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,060
DID SHE EXPLAIN THAT THE MORE

94
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,661
SHE FELT -- THROUGH MOST OF HER

95
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,862
ACCOUNT, SHE WAS A BAD ACTOR.

96
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:28,330
IS THERE A REASON SHE FELT LIKE

97
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,465
MAKING CONTACT WITH HIM IN SOME

98
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,467
WAY WOULD HELP HER?

99
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:32,968
>> MY UNDERSTANDING -- AGAIN,

100
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,203
IT'S JUST TALKING WITH HER, I

101
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,872
THINK WHEN SHE SAID SHE MADE EYE

102
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:37,406
CONTACT, SHE THOUGHT

103
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,140
LEGITIMATELY MAYBE HE -- I THINK

104
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,176
SHE SAID AT SOME POINT, I THINK

105
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,043
HE WAS CONFLICTED.

106
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:42,611
I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO

107
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:43,646
TRY TO HELP ME.

108
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,214
WHEN YOU DO YOUR INTERVIEW

109
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,049
BEFORE THE POLYGRAPH, ON THE

110
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:48,350
VICTIM, YOU DON'T ASK A LOT OF

111
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,454
FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

112
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:53,489
IT'S KIND OF A HEINOUS THING

113
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:53,956
THAT'S HAPPENED.

114
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,458
THAT THEY ARE ALLEGING.

115
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,860
SHE WAS INTERVIEWED IN DEPTH THE

116
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,796
DAY BEFORE BY LISA AND DEBBIE

117
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:02,698
I'M ASSUMING, AND SO YOU WANT TO

118
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:04,200
GET THE GENERAL FACTS.

119
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,269
TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS AND

120
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,237
PROD, YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO

121
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,639
GET TOO EMOTIONAL, ESPECIALLY A

122
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,273
VICTIM.

123
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,041
WHEN YOU ASK THAT QUESTION, A

124
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,343
GOOD QUESTION, NO, I JUST LET

125
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:16,913
HER MATTER.

126
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:23,719
>> Shannon: ON A COUPLE OF

127
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,420
OCCASIONS, MARK WOULD JUMP ON

128
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,754
THE BED.

129
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:25,454
THE LAST TIME HE DID THIS, ALL

130
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,155
THREE BECAME SEPARATED AND SHE

131
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:26,923
WAS ABLE TO GET FREE AND WENT TO

132
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:27,356
THE BATHROOM.

133
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,090
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED BY

134
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,457
THIS.

135
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:29,659
DID SHE SAY THAT HE WAS PILING

136
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:31,093
ONTO THE TWO OF THEM, JUMPING ON

137
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:33,996
THE BED SEPARATELY, DID YOU GET

138
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:34,463
ANY INDICATION?

139
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:37,033
>> I THINK AT ONE POINT SHE TOLD

140
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,034
ME DURING THE INTERVIEW THAT HE

141
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,702
WOULD JUMP ON THE BED AND

142
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:40,436
SOMETIMES -- I THINK THE PHRASE

143
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,939
SHE USED WAS HIT EACH OTHER A

144
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:43,339
LITTLE BIT.

145
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,842
THEN HE WOULD JUMP OFF.

146
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,744
>> Shannon: HE AND BRETT?

147
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,045
>> EXACTLY.

148
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,113
THEN A THIRD TIME APPARENTLY HE

149
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,849
JUMPED ON THE BED, IT CAUSED A

150
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,917
SEPARATION, AS SHE DESCRIBED, IN

151
00:03:54,917 --> 00:03:56,152
THE PILE, WHICH SHE SAID, I

152
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,487
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS MY STRENGTH

153
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,055
THAT ENABLED ME TO GET OFF OR I

154
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:00,857
WAS FREE AND THEY WERE SO

155
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:01,624
INEBRIATED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GO

156
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,559
INTO THE BATHROOM AND LOCKED THE

157
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:03,860
DOOR.

158
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,961
>> Shannon: THERE WAS

159
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,229
SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN BRETT

160
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,231
AND MARK THAT MADE -- HORSEPLAY?

161
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,800
>> I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS

162
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,868
HORSEPLAY.

163
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,236
>> Shannon: SHE DESCRIBES THEY

164
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,404
WERE LAUGHING.

165
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:18,241
SHE FELT IN FEAR FOR HER LIFE.

166
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,142
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT

167
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,176
AFTER SHE PUT TOGETHER THE

168
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,810
STATEMENT THAT YOU INTERVIEWED

169
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,445
HERE, THESE ARE VERTICAL

170
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:22,812
QUESTIONS.

171
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,481
IS ANY PART OF YOUR STATEMENT

172
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:25,048
FALLS?

173
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:25,482
SHE SAID NO.

174
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,284
DID YOU MAKE UP ANY PART OF YOUR

175
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:28,651
STATEMENT?

176
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:29,853
HER ANSWER WAS NO.

177
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,487
I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT

178
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,888
POLYGRAPH TESTS BUT TO ME

179
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:32,856
READING THIS FROM THE OUTSIDE IT

180
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,657
SEEMS THAT I WOULD EXPECT MANY

181
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:35,492
MORE QUESTIONS.

182
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,060
IS THIS STANDARD YOU JUST HAVE

183
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,393
THE TWO?

184
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:40,430
>> IT IS.

185
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,432
WHEN YOU DO -- VERY RARE AND

186
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:44,067
LAW ENFORCEMENT, I SPEND MOST OF

187
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,368
MY CAREER IN WORKING WITH THE

188
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:45,635
FBI.

189
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,438
YOU DON'T NORMALLY GIVE

190
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,105
