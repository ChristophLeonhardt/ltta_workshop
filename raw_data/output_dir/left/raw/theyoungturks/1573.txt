1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,470
A SINGLE UNEMPLOYED FATHER
FROM THE BRONX ONE $5

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,839
MILLION TO THE LOTTERY FROM JUST
A SCRATCH OFF TICKET BUT HE

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,839
DOESN'T REALLY WANT ANYONE TO
KNOW ABOUT IT.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,839
HOWEVER, THAT IS

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:20,619
IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE NEW
YORK'S LOTTERY.

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:27,650
HERE IS

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:39,489
WHAT 

8
00:00:39,489 --> 00:01:09,130
IS GOING ON.

9
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,130
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE?

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,140
SHOULD
HE REMAIN ANONYMOUS?

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,530
YES. 100%.

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,980
I THINK IT SHOULD BE OPTIONAL.

13
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,130
WHAT IS THIS ARCHAIC OBLIGATION
TO REVEAL YOURSELF?

14
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,990
BECAUSE OF THE GIANT CHECK,
MAX.

15
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,570
THAT IS THE REASON, BECAUSE A
PR.

16
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,620
THEY WANT YOU TO GET OUT

17
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,370
THERE AND SELL THE DREAM,
BECAUSE OF COURSE, THE

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,970
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE
DON'T WHEN.

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,970
EVERYONE ELSE DOES

20
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,200
NOT WIN.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,980
YOUR ODDS ARE NOT VERY
GOOD, BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE GUY

22
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,140
WITH THE GIANT CHECK ON TV IT
SEEMS LIKE, THAT GUY LOOKS

23
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,420
LIKE A REGULAR GUY JUST
LIKE ME, I COULD WIN.

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,370
AND THEN OF COURSE THAT IS HOW
THEY MAKE MONEYÃ– THEY MAKE

25
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,660
A TON OF MONEY, THAT IS WHAT
THEY DO THE LOTTERIES.

26
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,960
THIS STORY IMMEDIATELY
REMINDED ME OF THE PEOPLE WHO

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,950
THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO POST
THEIR LUXURY ITEMS ON SOCIAL

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,540
MEDIA.

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,460
THE PEOPLE WHO POST
PICTURES OF THEIR CASH OR THEIR

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,940
FANCY WATCHES, WHATEVER IT IS
AND THEN A WEEK OR TWO LATER YOU

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,210
READ A STORY ABOUT HOW THEY GOT
ROBBED BECAUSE THEY WERE

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,610
FLAUNTING THEIR CASH.

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,550
THE
REASON I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS

34
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,510
ANYONE WHO THINKS AHEAD WOULDN'T
WANT EVERYONE KNOWING WHAT THEY

35
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,510
HAVE.

36
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,930
I WOULD WANT TO KEEP IT TO
MYSELF, I AM NOT GOING TO FLAUNT

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,860
MY LUXURY ITEMS ARE TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH MONEY I HAVE, THAT IS

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
CRAZY.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,770
YOU COULD BECOME A TARGET
AND BY THE WAY, WE DON'T KNOW

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,250
WHAT KIND OF ISSUES HE HAS HAD
WITH PEOPLE IN THE PAST.

41
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,250
HE

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,850
JUST DOES NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH
THAT KIND OF CONFLICT AND I

43
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,330
THINK THAT SHOULD BE HIS RIGHT.

44
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,010
HE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED IN
DOING THIS RIDICULOUS PRESS

45
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,010
CONFERENCE.

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,010
I TOTALLY AGREE.

47
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,620
IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE IN OTHER
STATES HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,260
AS WELL WITH A LOT OF MONEY,
MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS

49
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,890
SO I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT
THING TO DISTINGUISH.

50
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,400
I WAS GOING TO NAME MYSELF TO
CHANGE BUT THEN I REALIZED

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,319
PEOPLE WITH THE KNOW I HAVE TWO
CHAINS AND THAT WOULD BE A

52
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,319
PROBLEM.

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,660
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU
REALLY QUICK.

54
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
LET'S SAY YOU ARE

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,441
THE WINNER, $5 MILLION, ALL OF A
SUDDEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THIS

56
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:08,441
CASH.

57
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,441
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO COME OUT OF THE

58
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:13,160
WOODWORK AND GIVE YOU SUB-
STORIES, CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,870
OUT, I DON'T KNOW, MY CAT BROKE
ITS LEG, WHATEVER IT IS BUT

60
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,990
LET'S SAY IT'S A SERIOUS
PROBLEM, SOMEONE HAS

61
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,210
MEDICAL BILLS TO BE PAID.

62
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,340
WHAT DO YOU DO?

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,870
YOU ARE KIND OF LIKE CHEAP.

64
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,330
I WAS WONDERING WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT.

65
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,730
I AM JUST CURIOUS.

66
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,959
WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE
YOUNG TURKS I WAS VERY BAD AS

67
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,959
SAYING NO.

68
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,600
I HAVE GOTTEN MUCH
BETTER.

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,410
YOU WERE BAD AT SAYING NO AT
SOME POINT?

70
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,410
YEAH.

71
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,240
I FELT BAD EVERY TIME,
OH YOU WANT TO DO THAT, SURE,

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
LET'S DO IT.

73
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,740
I THINK THAT IS A
BAD IDEA, BUT LET'S DO IT.

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,490
IN

75
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,130
MY PERSONAL LIFE TOO.

76
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,099
IN ALL
HONESTY, I HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN

77
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,480
TO PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE THEY WON
THE LOTTERY BUT BECAUSE THEY ONE

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,680
WOUND UP IN A JOB OR THEY GOT A
LOT OF MONEY AND PEOPLE

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,290
DEFINITELY COME OUT OF THE
WOODWORK.

80
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,290
IF YOU HAVE NEVER

81
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,190
SEEN YOUR SECOND COUSINS, WIN
THE LOTTERY, THEY ARE COMING

82
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,030
YOUR WAY.

83
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,920
ANNA HIT ON THE MOST
DIFFICULT ONE BECAUSE PEOPLE,

84
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,649
AND THEY GO I GOT THIS GREAT
IDEA FOR A BUSINESS AND IT IS

85
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:22,460
GOING TO BE A FLOATING COUCH IN
CASE IT FLOODS, AND THAT IS

86
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,620
RELATIVELY EASY.

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,180
NO. AND
THEN YOU WILL GET, MY KID NEEDS

88
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

89
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,630
YEAH, EVERYBODY'S KID NEEDS TO
GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY ARE ALL

90
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,390
$200,000.

91
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,150
THAT IS A MEDIUM KNOW.

92
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,410
THEN SOMEBODY COMES AND SAYS, MY
AUNT HAS CANCER.

93
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,199
HOW DO YOU SAY NO TO THAT?

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,830
THERE IS NO GOOD ANSWER TO
THAT SO THIS GUY IS LIKE I DO

95
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,840
NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR
AUNT.

96
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,460
MEANWHILE THE NEWS ARTICLE
HAS A PHOTO OF HIM.

97
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,130
THEY BLURRED IT, SO I CAN SEE
WHEN HE LOOKS LIKE EXCEPT HE

98
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,250
LOOKS LIKE THE JOKER.

99
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,800
TAKE HIS FACE AND'S MOTION
WITH THE JOKER FROM BATMAN.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM DEFINITELY
ARE GOING TO DO THAT IS.
