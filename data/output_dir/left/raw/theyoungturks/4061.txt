1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,590
OUR ESTEEMED
PRESIDENT, HE WAS IN ARIZONA

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,410
LAST NIGHT, I HAD A CHANCE TO
COVER HIM IN ARIZONA WHEN HE WAS

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,400
THERE AND I WILL SAY THAT FOR
HAVING COVERED TRUMP AND SANDERS

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,240
AND ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES,
THE PLACES WHERE BOTH TRUMP AND

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,990
SANDERS SEEM TO ATTRACT TO ME
THE MOST MEMORABLE CROWDS IN

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,130
BOTH THEIR FERVOR AND EXCITEMENT
WAS, CURIOUSLY, ARIZONA.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,130
SO IT

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,609
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME THAT THE
NIGHT AFTER GIVING WHAT WAS TO

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,970
BE A SOMBER AND IMPORTANT SPEECH
WITH SOME DETAILS BUT MOSTLY

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,520
LACKING ANY DETAILS ON
AFGHANISTAN, WHETHER THERE WILL

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,880
BE A SURGE OR NOT, THE PRESIDENT
THEN DID A PIVOT BACK TO WHAT WE

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,300
CAME TO KNOW AS CAMPAIGNING
DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS HIS

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,050
FAVORITE VENUE, HE CAN SAY
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO A CROWD

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,840
THAT WILL ACCEPT HIM FOR
WHATEVER HE SAYS, IT WAS NO

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,310
DIFFERENT IN PHOENIX LAST NIGHT.

16
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,550
HERE IS YOUR PRESIDENT.

17
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,980
I WOULD LOVE IF THE CAMERAS
COULD SHOW THIS CROWD, BECAUSE

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,050
IT IS RATHER INCREDIBLE.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,290
IT IS
INCREDIBLE.

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,530
IT IS INCREDIBLE.

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,209
AS
EVERYBODY HERE REMEMBERS, THIS

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:14,580
WAS THE SCENE OF MY FIRST RALLY
SPEECH, RIGHT?

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,580
THE CROWDS WERE

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,620
SO BIG, ALMOST AS BIG AS
TONIGHT, THAT THE PEOPLE SAID

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,190
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, YOU
KNOW, THERE IS SOMETHING SPECIAL

26
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,780
HAPPENING HERE.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,490
HOW ABOUT ALL WEEK THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT THE MASSIVE CROWDS

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,740
THAT ARE GOING TO BE OUTSIDE.

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,000
WHERE ARE THEY?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,410
WELL, IT'S HOT

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,410
OUT.

32
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,290
IT IS HOT.

33
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,190
I THINK IT'S TOO
WARM.

34
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,840
THEY SHOW UP IN THE

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,320
HELMETS AND THE BLACK MASKS,
THEY'VE GOT CLUBS AND THEN GOT

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,270
EVERYTHING -- ANTIFA.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,050
THIS IS THE OFF-THE-CUFF,
FREEWHEELING DONALD TRUMP.

38
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,050
NOMI,

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,380
CENK, I WANT TO SHOW YOU BEFORE
WE GET INTO THIS DISCUSSION

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,520
ABOUT WE JUST LISTENED TO, HE
WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE CROWDS,

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,940
HOW THEY WERE ALMOST BIGGER THAN
WHEN HE WAS FIRST HERE, LET'S

42
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,190
SEE IT, MR.

43
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,150
PRESIDENT.

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,100
YEAH.

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,230
ALMOST BIGGER.

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,010
THAT WAS
THE EMPTY BACK OF THE ARENA

47
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,290
WHERE HE WAS SPEAKING.

48
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,740
I THINK
THIS IS CLEARLY A PLACE WHERE HE

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,880
IS MOST COMFORTABLE.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,350
THE NIGHT
BEFORE, LESS THAN 24 HOURS

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,970
EARLIER, HE OPENED HIS SPEECH ON
FOREIGN POLICY BY SAYING WE HAVE

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,510
TO COME TOGETHER AS ONE, WE ARE
ONE PEOPLE, WE ARE ONE COUNTRY.

53
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,590
IT WAS A SEGUE OUT OF THE
CHARLOTTESVILLE TALKING INTO

54
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,470
TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED
TO DO IN AFGHANISTAN.

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,650
A DIFFERENT GUY SHOWED UP THE
NEXT NIGHT.

56
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,700
OF COURSE.

57
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,680
WHEN HE DID THE
AFGHANISTAN SPEECH I KEPT

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,459
MOCKING HIM FOR BEING ON THE
PROMPTER, AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE

59
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,910
LIKE REPUBLICANS WITH OBAMA THEY
DISCOVERED A THING CALLED A

60
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,830
TELEPROMPTER, THEY ARE LIKE OH
MY GOD IT TURNS OUT THE

61
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,890
PRESIDENT'S READING -- I KNOW,
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT A LONG

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,640
TIME -- IT'S JUST PARTICULARLY
STARK WITH TRUMP BECAUSE WHEN

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,410
HE'S NOT READING IT'S OBVIOUS.

64
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,880
HE WASN'T READING TODAY.

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
PART OF

66
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,120
WHY THE CROWD LOVED IT SO MUCH,
THERE IS A HUGE DOWNSIDE BECAUSE

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,970
THE DOWNSIDE IS YOU GET TO HEAR
WHAT HE ACTUALLY THINKS -- THE

68
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,209
UPSIDE IS THAT IS CROWD LOVES
IT.

69
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:22,950
THE GUY IS A CLASSIC

70
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,620
CARNIVAL BARKER.

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,880
WHEN HE IS
LIKE, ANTIFA -- I FEEL LIKE I'M

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,970
IN WWE WRESTLEMANIA 27.

73
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,070
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE, YOU HAVE
BOTH BEEN AROUND THESE TRUMP

74
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,320
PEOPLE, I DON'T BELIEVE THEY
KNOW WHAT ANTIFA IS.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I THINK

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,730
THEY JUST WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS
GUY VAMP.

77
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,120
THIS IS INTERESTING, BECAUSE
IF THIS WERE HILLARY PEOPLE, IF

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,250
YOU WERE SCREAMING HILLARY
PEOPLE, IT WOULD HELP HIM.

79
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
HIS

80
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,440
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT ANTIFA
IS, I THINK HE'S SO UNFAMILIAR

81
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:14,470
WITH THE ALT-LEFT, THAT POPULIST
LEFT THAT DIDN'T GO TO HIS SIDE,

82
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,019
THAT HE MIGHT BE FUELING THE
FIRE THAT COULD TAKE HIM DOWN

83
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,019
EVENTUALLY.

84
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,770
AND FURTHERMORE IF
THIS IS HIS BASE, IF ARIZONA IS

85
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,430
LIKE HIS LOYAL BASE AND THAT WAS
HIS CROWD IN ARIZONA, I WOULD BE

86
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,779
WORRIED IF I WERE DONALD TRUMP.

87
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,259
BECAUSE THAT WAS A CONVENTION

88
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,280
CENTER, NOT A STADIUM, I'VE
LIVED IN ARIZONA, THAT WAS A NOT

89
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,990
A LARGE PLACE TO GIVE A RALLY.

90
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,310
U.S. PRESIDENTS COME IN MY
LIFE, WHEREVER THEY HAVE GONE

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,410
THEY HAVE DRAWN A CROWD.

92
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,710
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE A U.S.

93
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,009
PRESIDENT DRAW CROWD ON THE
ROAD, HE JUST TURNS THEM

94
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,990
INTO RALLIES AND CAMPAIGN
SPEECHES.

95
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,180
IT'S KIND OF ENTERTAINING TO
WATCH TRUMP, I WILL GIVE HIM

96
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,180
THAT, THAT'S WHY THE APPRENTICE
RATED WELL FOR A LONG TIME.

97
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,869
IT'S

98
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,529
NORMAL FOR A BIG CROWD TO SHOW
UP AND GET SUPER EXCITED.

99
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:07,529
AND

100
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:10,719
LOOK, ANTIFA ISN'T GOING TO
BRING HIM DOWN, ANTIFA IS NOT A

101
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:14,800
REAL ENOUGH FORCE TO HAVE
POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE, IF YOU

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,289
ARE MAD AT ME FOR SAYING THAT,
GOD BLESS, GO FORWARD ON THAT,

103
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:22,180
BUT NOMI IS RIGHT, THE MORE YOU
MENTION THEM THE MORE THEY WILL

104
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,180
GROW.

105
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,599
SO TRUMP CALLING
THEM OUT, ANTIFA!

106
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:31,580
IT'S JUST GOING TO HELP THEM.

107
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,069
SOMEONE MEME THAT.

108
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,069
ANTIFA!

109
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:46,430
HE'S SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE,
THIS IS KRIS PICKEL SAYING --

110
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,729
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WAS
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO EVERYBODY,

111
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,039
HEY, POINTING TO THE NEWS,
NOBODY WATCHES TV ANYMORE,

112
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,699
NOBODY WATCHES THESE PEOPLE,
THEY ARE ALL A BUNCH OF LIARS --

113
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,530
MEANWHILE EVERYONE WHO IS
HEARING ABOUT IT IS WATCHING IT

114
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,449
ON TELEVISION, OR WATCHING
IT SOMEHOW.

115
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,569
THE NEWS CONTINUES TO SHOW THIS
PRESIDENT.

116
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,509
HE HAS REWRITTEN A LOT OF THE
RULES, SOMETIMES FOR THE GOOD,

117
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:13,949
BUT ALMOST NEVER.

118
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:17,300
HERE IS
ANOTHER REWRITTEN RULE, THAT

119
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,039
USED TO BE A THING LIKE YOU
DON'T WANT YOUR LIE TO BE TOO

120
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,990
BRAZEN OR OBVIOUS, POLITICIANS
LIE ALL THE TIME BUT THEY HAVE

121
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,669
SUBTLE, NUANCED WAYS OF LYING.

122
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,199
TRUMP IS LIKE CNN JUST TURNED

123
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,199
OFF THEIR CAMERAS.

124
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,689
FIRST OF ALL
HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT?

125
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,689
HE'S IN

126
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:32,689
THE MIDDLE OF HIS SPEECH.

127
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,830
WHAT A
BIZARRE THING TO MAKE UP.

128
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,830
SECOND

129
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,949
OF ALL, THEY DIDN'T. IT IS
PROVABLE WHETHER THEY TURNED OFF

130
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,310
THE CAMERAS ARE NOT.

131
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:48,240
HE DOESN'T CARE AS LONG AS HE
GETS GOOD APPLAUSE IN THE CROWD.

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,659
SOMETIMES HE IS SPEAKING TO
THE AUDIENCE ON CAMERA, WHICH

133
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:53,360
STILL -- DO THEY NOT REALIZE
THEY ARE WATCHING CNN?

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,569
ARE THEY WATCHING FOX NEWS?

135
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,880
I THINK SO MANY ARE WATCHING
ON FOX, A HANDFUL ARE IN

136
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,740
THE HALL, THEY'LL THINK HE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH.

137
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,639
I WILL GO ONE STEP FURTHER, I
GUARANTEE IF YOU POLLED TRUMP

138
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,189
VIEWERS WHO WERE WATCHING IT ON
CNN, DID CNN TURN OFF THE

139
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:14,189
CAMERAS?

140
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:15,999
HALF OF THEM WOULD SAY
YES.

141
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,539
I WAS WATCHING, IT WENT RIGHT
OFF.

142
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,770
THAT WAS THE BLATANT.

143
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,770
THEN

144
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,909
THERE WAS THE SUBTLE LIE, THE
SUBTLE FALSITIES.

145
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,429
LET'S LISTEN

146
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:31,050
TO THE PRESIDENT TALKING, HE WAS
TRYING TO PROVE TO THIS CROWD

147
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,589
THAT HE HAD EMPATHY FOR WHAT WAS
GOING ON IN CHARLOTTESVILLE WHEN

148
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,139
IT HAPPENED, THAT THE REMARKS HE
GAVE AFTERWARD WERE, BY THIS

149
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,259
FAKE NEWS MEDIA, BY THESE
HORRIBLE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF

150
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,279
THE HALL, THAT THEY WERE
MISCONSTRUED SOMEHOW.

151
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,279
HE WENT TO

152
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,259
CLARIFY THE RECORD.

153
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:54,669
SO WHAT I DID --

154
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,020
SO WHAT I DID --

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,090
I'M REALLY DOING THIS TO SHOW
YOU HOW DAMN DISHONEST THESE

156
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,899
PEOPLE ARE.

157
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,139
SO HERE IS WHAT I SAID,
REALLY FAST, HERE IS WHAT I SAID

158
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:10,139
ON SATURDAY.

159
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,160
WE ARE CLOSELY
FOLLOWING THE TERRIBLE EVENTS

160
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,069
UNFOLDING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,
VIRGINIA.

161
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,580
THIS IS ME SPEAKING.

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,550
WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS THIS EGREGIOUS

163
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,409
DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY, AND
VIOLENCE.

164
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:24,729
THAT'S ME SPEAKING ON

165
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,429
SATURDAY RIGHT AFTER THE EVENT.

166
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:31,709
THAT'S NOT A LIE.

167
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,049
NOMI, CENK, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

168
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,279
LET'S HEAR WHAT ELSE HE HAD TO
SAY.

169
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,490
WE CONDEMN IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS THIS EGREGIOUS

170
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,130
DISPLAY OF HATRED, BIGOTRY, AND
VIOLENCE ON MANY SIDES.

171
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,130
ON MANY

172
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,990
SIDES.

173
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,010
IT SEEMS LIKE HE LEFT OUT
A PHRASE WHEN HE WAS

174
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,470
REPEATING IT TO THE CROWD.

175
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,830
JAYAR, YOU THINK THAT WAS AN
ACCIDENT?

176
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,320
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
DIFFERENT, WHAT WERE YOU TALKING

177
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
ABOUT?

178
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,640
I WAS IN THE CROWD IN
PHOENIX AND SOMETHING SWEPT OVER

179
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
US --

180
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,110
YOU ARE WATCHING CNN, THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

181
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,200
THAT IS

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,580
WHAT HE DOES, FOR THIS AUDIENCE,
THE ONES SITTING AT HOME

183
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,370
WATCHING FOX, THE ONES IN THAT
HALL, HE CAN GO ON THE AIR AND

184
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,650
SAY THIS IS WHAT I READ, DOESN'T
IT SOUND PERFECT?

185
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,650
THAT WASN'T

186
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,650
WHAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL.

187
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,950
IF HE HAD STOPPED THERE, IT
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TALKED

188
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,610
ABOUT AS MUCH.

189
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,940
WE HAVE SHOWN POLL AFTER POLL,
EVEN AFTER CHARLOTTESVILLE 67%

190
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,720
OF REPUBLICANS THOUGHT HIS
REACTION WAS FINE.

191
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,140
THAT'S

192
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,560
AMAZING.

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,460
OF COURSE A FEATURE HE
PICKS ONE SENTENCE WHERE HE

194
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,370
DENOUNCES NAZIS, PEOPLE GO, THE
FAKE NEWS MEDIA CRITICIZES HIM

195
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,500
EVEN THOUGH HE CRITICIZED NAZIS.

196
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,010
IF YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THOSE

197
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,180
FOLKS THAT HE ALSO SAID BOTH
SIDES WERE AT FAULT WHEN ONE

198
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,100
SIDE WAS NAZIS AND THE OTHER
SIDE WAS PEOPLE PROTESTING

199
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,160
NAZIS, WHEN ONE SIDE GOT KILLED
IN THE OTHER SIDE DIDN'T, THEY

200
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,010
ARE LIKE, I DON'T DO NUANCE.

201
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,010
ANTIFA!

202
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,010
POLITICALLY CORRECT.

203
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,660
YOU GUYS
ARE SO POLITICALLY CORRECT WITH

204
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,790
YOUR NUMBERS.

205
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,260
DOES THIS WORK,
THOUGH, IN TERMS OF CALLING OUT

206
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
HIS STRATEGY?

207
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
I THINK IT WORKS
FOR THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE

208
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,290
WATCHING US, OR WATCHING
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, WHATEVER YOU

209
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,680
WANT TO CALL IT, BUT DOES IT
WORK FOR THE TRUMP BASE?

210
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,960
HIS NUMBERS AREN'T GOING DOWN.

211
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,560
THEY ARE GOING DOWN, IT'S NOT
INSIGNIFICANT.

212
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
AND THEY AREN'T

213
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,150
NECESSARILY GOING DOWN FOR THE
REASONS WE THINK, NOT BECAUSE WE

214
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,580
KEEP REMINDING THEM WHAT A FULL
THIS GUY CAN BE, THEY HAD AN

215
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,720
ENTIRE ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO
LEARN THAT.

216
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
THEY ARE GOING DOWN

217
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,230
BECAUSE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE
STARTING TO TURN ON THE

218
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,580
PRESIDENT, AND I THINK ALSO
BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE HEAR

219
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,950
THAT IMPORTANT PEOPLE ARE
LEAVING THE RESERVATION, THAT

220
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,950
HAS AN IMPACT.

221
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,690
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

222
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,690
AND I
JUST SAW --

223
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,070
WHAT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT?

224
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:06,380
I SAW A POLL WHERE HIS
NUMBERS WENT BACK UP, THEY HAVE

225
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,650
THEM ALL AWAY AT 44%.

226
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,540
WAS THAT TAKEN AFTER THE
AFGHANISTAN SPEECH?

227
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,160
NO, IT WAS TAKEN THROUGHOUT
THE WEEK.

228
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,650
SOME OF IT DIDN'T EVEN

229
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,200
GET ALL THE CHARLOTTESVILLE
RESPONSE, TO BE FAIR.

230
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I DON'T

231
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,970
THINK THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
IMPORTANT REPUBLICANS

232
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,960
LEAVING, I THINK THEY KIND OF
HATE IMPORTANT REPUBLICANS.

233
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,700
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS THAT
VOTED FOR HIM RELUCTANTLY, I

234
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,130
THINK THAT MATTERS TO THEM.

235
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,520
AND THERE WERE ENOUGH OF THEM
THAT IT PUT HIM OVER.

236
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,180
IT MIGHT HAVE AN EFFECT ON IF
THERE IS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL

237
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,890
EFFECT OF SO MANY REPUBLICANS,
LOCKSTEP REPUBLICANS, DISTANCING

238
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,250
THEMSELVES FROM TRUMP AND HE'S
FIRING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT,

239
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,110
IT'S THAT SECURITY WITHIN THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

240
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,110
THEY WOULD

241
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,060
RATHER HAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
SECURED TO DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS

242
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,160
AND ANTIFA AND BERTIE SANDERS
THAN KEEP TRUMP.

243
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:10,640
HERE IS MY SENSE OF IT, HIS
BASE LOVES THIS STUFF, THEY

244
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,270
CONSIDER THIS HONEST AND
ENTERTAINING.

245
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,270
IT'S THE GREAT

246
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,930
RAND PAUL LINE, HE TOLD ME, I
DON'T KNOW WHY HASN'T SAID IT ON

247
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:27,240
TV, TRUMP HAS THE TRUTH TELLING
WITHOUT THE TRUTH.

248
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
HE'S NOT

249
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,931
TALKING LIKE A STANDARD
POLITICIAN, BUT HE GIVES YOU ONE

250
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,530
LIE AFTER ANOTHER.

251
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,360
IT'S ALSO THE AUDIENCE, THE
PEOPLE, CENK.

252
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,751
TO BE FAIR, MOST

253
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:42,400
POLITICIANS, PRESIDENTS, PEOPLE
WE'VE LOOKED AT THROUGH THE SAME

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,670
GLASSES, THEY ALSO TELL THE
TRUTH WITHOUT TELLING THE TRUTH.

255
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,160
THERE ARE LOTS OF OBFUSCATIONS
AND LIES.

256
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,390
THEY LOOK FIXED DOING IT,
MICHAEL, IT'S A GIANT

257
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,100
DIFFERENCE.

258
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,720
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE WE
HAVE FALLEN FOR IT FOR YEARS.

259
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,470
WE ARE DONE WITH IT.

260
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,680
THIS IS A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE
FALLING FOR IT.

261
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,510
WE ARE NOT DONE

262
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,570
WITH IT BECAUSE LOOK WHO WON.

263
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,680
THEIR IS POLLING OUT SAYING
YOU BELIEVE WHAT DONALD TRUMP

264
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,680
SAYS?

265
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,770
THEY ARE LIKE, NO, AND WE DON'T
CARE BECAUSE HE'S DRAINING

266
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,480
THE SWAMP OR WHATEVER.

267
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,940
I DON'T MEAN WE ARE DONE WITH
LYING, THIS GUY PERFECTED IT IN

268
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,430
A SENSE -- WE ARE DONE WITH THE
FAKE, POLISHED, I DO DECLARE,

269
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,420
THE HONORABLE GENTLEMAN FROM
CONNECTICUT AND NEBRASKA --

270
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,970
PEOPLE HATE THAT.

271
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,540
THE ONLY
REASON TRUMP IS POPULAR IS

272
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,340
BECAUSE HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF
THAT.

273
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

274
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,150
CRITICIZING THE SPEECH
VOCIFEROUSLY, WE HAVE OUR OWN

275
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:43,930
CRITICISM OBVIOUSLY, INCLUDING
THAT HE MAKES STUFF UP, BUT

276
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,810
OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS AN
EFFECTIVE SPEECH TO KEEP

277
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,810
HIS BASE.

278
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,990
SPEECHES LIKE THIS ARE HOW HE
WON THE PRESIDENCY.

279
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,060
EVERYONE WHO

280
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,550
SAYS THEY AREN'T EFFECTIVE IS
WRONG BECAUSE HE'S THE

281
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,890
PRESIDENT, AND THIS IS WHAT HE
DID CONSTANTLY DURING THE

282
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,590
ELECTION.

283
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,500
AND I DON'T THINK YOU
ARE RIGHT, I THINK THE TRUMP

284
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,450
PRESIDENCY WILL BE AN ANOMALY,
NOT A NORM.

285
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,070
I THINK HIS SUCCESS

286
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,320
WAS BASED LARGELY ON HIS
CELEBRITY AND THE CULT OF

287
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,130
PERSONALITY AND ONCE HE GOES
AWAY SO TOO WILL ALL OF THAT AND

288
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,150
WE WILL RETURN TO SOMETHING MORE
SIMILAR TO THE I DO DECLARE.

289
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,160
I DISAGREE ON THAT, BUT THAT'S
OKAY.

290
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:29,860
THAT'S FINE, I DON'T THINK WE
WILL GET AN 

291
00:14:29,860 --> 00:00:00,000
I DO DECLARE.
