00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,187
THINK OF THAT.

20
00:00:49,188 --> 00:00:50,889
35-YEAR JAIL SENTENCE.

21
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,224

00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,612
IT WASN'T EASY.

30
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:17,415
THAT ONE WASN'T EASY.

00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:25,824

OFFICE.

41
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:45,910
ALL THEY WILL DO IS OBSTRUCT.

42
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:47,912
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

43
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:49,814
