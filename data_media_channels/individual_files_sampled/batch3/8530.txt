Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME. HARRIS IS NOT SUGGESTING THE MASSES GO OPIATES. CALIFORNIA IS FAILING FAST. WHERE ONLY IMMIGRANT AND WEALTHY TECH BARONS FEEL VEHICLE. HYGIENE IS AN ISSUE. AND OFFICIAL OUTBREAK OF HYPOTHETICAL A IT IS A NECESSITY. SHOT BY A RECENT FELLOP WHO WAS SHIELDED BY THE SANCTUARY POLICY. STENCH OF URINE AND FESES IS TRONNING. WELCOME TO THE CALIFORNIA TENT CITY. THEY WOULD HAVE ARRESTED MORE IMMIGRANT BUT OAKLAND'S MAYOR ISSUED A AT THE SAME TIME AND WARNED OF THE RAIDS. Tucker: CALIFORNIA MATTERS. VICTOR IS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE STATE AND JOINS US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. YOU DESCRIBED THE ECONOMIC DISTRIBUTION OF CALIFORNIA RECENTLY HAS MED I CAN'T HAVAL WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IT MEANS 75 PERCENT OF THE DPSHGS GEOGRAPHICAL PEOPLE. AND COASTAL CORRIDOR WHERE WE CAL- TECH AND STANFORD AND 3 TRILLION IN CAPITALIZED SILICON COMPANY AND THIS IS WHERE ALL OF THE POLICY IS MADE. AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT. LAWYERS AND ACADEMICS AND POLITICIANS ARE NEVER SUBJECT OF THE RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH WELT. CALIFORNIA IS A MEDEVIAL SOCIETY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST BASKET OF GASOLINE SALES AND RANK 49 OR 45 IN SCHOOL. AND HIGHEST KILOWATT. AND WILL GASOLINE IS THE HIGH OF THE. AND IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE PEOPLE MAKING THE REGULATION. WHERE I WORK AT STANFORD. IT IS 75 OR 65 DEGREES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO TURN ON THE HEATER OR AIR CONDITIONING. BUT IN THE VALLEY. POOR PEOPLE GO TO WALMART BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN WATER FOR THE AGRICULTURE. BUT THEY DO IN ARCHITECTURE. AND THAT REVERBATES IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS DYSFUNCTIONAM SAY THE. MIDDLE-CLASS, 4- 5 PEOPLE LEFT. AND 4- 5 PEOPLE COME ILLEGALLY FROM SOUTHERN MEXICO AND GLOBAL WEALTH IN A SMALL AREA. AND YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER. AND YOU GET WHAT YOU HAVE NOW. Tucker: IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
