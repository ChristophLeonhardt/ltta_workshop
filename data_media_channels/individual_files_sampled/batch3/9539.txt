EXAMINE THIS NIGHTMARE SCENARIO. THE SACRIFICE OF A SMALL CHILD ON THE ALTER OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. FIRST, THE NEW COUNTER CULTURE, THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S ANGLE. ENTERTAINMENT ELITES ARE IN FREAK-OUT MODE. WHY? ONE OF THEIR MEGASTARS, KANYE WEST, ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S THINKING FOR HIMSELF. FELT LIKE A CULTURAL EARTHQUAKE OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN WEST TWEETED THAT HE LIKED THE WAY A CONSERVATIVE BLACK ACTIVIST THOUGHT. HE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH PRO TRUMP TWEETS THAT HAS THE INTERNET EXPLODING. HE DECLARED HIS LOVE FOR TRUMP AND EX-STOLED THE DRAGON ENERGY THEY SHARE. WHAT IS THAT? HE REFUSED TO LET THE MOB SHAKE HIS LOVE FOR THE PRESIDENT. NOW LOOK, THIS ISN'T ABOUT CELEBRATING ONE SUPERSTAR'S ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP. WHAT I'M GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS SHINING A LIGHT ON THE MORE INTOLLERANT CROWD OUT THERE. YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE THAT CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY ON TOLERANCE AND INCLUSION? THINK ABOUT THIS. OTHER THAN ACADEMIA, THERE'S FEW INDUSTRIES THAT AMERICA, THE AMERICAN LEFT DOMINATES LIKE IT DOES ENTERTAINMENT. FOR KANYE'S SIN OF SPEAKING HIS MIND, MUSICAL ICONS LIKE NICKI MINAJ AND DRAKE AND RIHANNA UNFOLLOWED HIM ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAT A PUNISHMENT. THE REACTION FROM THE LEFT WAS JUST AS PRONOUNCED. DIFFERENT CELEBRITY DIFFERENT CELEBRIIE DIFFERENT CELEBRIIES DESPERATE FOR ATTENTION. NOW HIS WIFE IS TWEETING BACK AT PEOPLE SAYING DON'T BE TOO HARD ON MY HUSBAND. DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE HE'S GOING THROUGH A MENTAL BREAK DOWN, WHICH WE KNOW HE'S HAD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I THINK KANYE WEST JUST REALIZED HE'S TOO RICH TO NOT BE REPUBLICAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INDEPENDENT THOUGHTS AND I INDEPENDENTLY THINK THAT KANYE HAS LOST HIS MIND. IS STEPHEN STILL? CHARACTER? I FORGET. ORIGINAL THOUGHT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. ANYONE THAT BREAKS FROM THE BORG MINDSET MUST BE SHUNNED OR BULLIED BACK INTO THE FOLD. KANYE SHARED A TEXT EXCHANGE WITH JOHN LEGEND. LOVE HIS MUSIC. BUT THIS ILLUSTRATES THE POINTS. JOHN LEGEND SAID YOU'RE WAY TOO POWERFUL TO ENDORSE WHAT HE IS AND WHAT HE STANDS FOR. SO MANY PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU FEEL BETRAYED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE HARM THAT TRUMP'S POLICIES CAUSE. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. DON'T LET THIS BE PART OF YOUR LEGACY. KANYE WEST WASN'T IMPRESSED. HE SAID I LOVE YOU, JOHN, BUT BRINGING UP MY FANS AND MY LEGACY IS A TACTIC BASED ON FEAR USED TO MANIPULATE MY FREE THOUGHT. HE'S RIGHT. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT ON MY SHOW, KANYE WEST IS RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THIS. ANYONE THAT DARES TO QUESTION THE IDEALOGICAL ORTHODOXSY OF THE LEFT, PARTICULARLY A BLACK ARTIST, MUST BE BROUGHT BACK INTO LINE. NOW, LET'S TALK TURKEY HERE. WHERE KANYE WEST IS PUNKING THE ELITES OR WHETHER HE'S SINCERELY EXPRESSING A BELIEF AND THE PRESIDENT IS IMMATERIAL. HE'S OPENED THE DOOR OF THE GLARING HYPOCRISY OF THE LEFT. THEY CLAIM TO DEFEND MINORITY RIGHTS UNTIL A MINORITY DISAGREES WITH THEM. THEY CLAIM TO BE FOR DIVERSITY UNTIL A TRULY DIVERSE VIEWPOINT IS HEARD. WHAT WEST MIGHT HAVE UNWITTINGLY DONE IS MADE IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR OTHERS TO STAND UP AGAINST THIS HERD MENTALITY. HE DID RECEIVE SOME SUPPORT FOR HIS INDEPENDENCE. CHANCE, THE RAPPER, HARDLY A CONSERVATIVE VOICE, TWEETED THIS. BLACK PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BE DEMOCRATS. CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SO SCANDALOUS. I DON'T THINK THAT KANYE WEST IS THE NEW MLK. ALL RIGHT? I HAVE VIVID MEMORIES OF HIM AT SOME TELEVISED FUND RAISER IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE. GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. THAT WASN'T NICE. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN HE RUDELY RUSHED THE STAGE TO TRY TO TAKE A MUSIC AWARD FROM TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT ALSO WASN'T NIGHT. 15 YEARS AGO, YES, I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT, I WROTE A BOOK CALLED "SHUT UP AND SING" WAS A CRITIQUE OF THE POLITICAL ACTIVISM OF THESE PEOPLE LIKE THE DIXIE CHICKS AND JACKSON BROWN AND ON AND ON. THE UPSHOT IS, WE PAY THEM TO ENTERTAIN. WE DON'T WANT TO BE CAPTIVE TO THEIR POLITICAL PONDERING. SOMEONE WHO FOR SOME UN-GODLY REASON DOES GET PAID TO PONTIFICATE ON POLITICS, HER NAME IS MISS ANNA NAVARRO TWEETED AT ME. HAS SHE TOLD KANYE TO SHUT UP AND SING YET OR DOES THAT ONLY APPLY TO ANTI-TRUMP BLACK CELEBRITIES? I'LL MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU, ANNA, IT APPLIES TO ANYONE PEDALLING POLITICAL NONSENSE WHILE LACKING THE CREDENTIALS OR EXPERIENCE TO DO SO, ANA. I'M NOT ABOUT TO CHEER ON KANYE WEST BECAUSE HE SAID SOMETHING NICE ABOUT TRUMP. THE POLITICAL MUSINGS OF UNINFIRMED CELEBRITIES IS NOT INTERESTING TO ME AT ALL. WHAT IS INTERESTING, THE OVERTHE TOP REACTION TO A BIG STAR SAYING SOMETHING TRULY COUNTER CULTURAL TODAY. THAT'S OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME. WASHING THE LEFT ATTACK HIM FOR DARING TO BREAK RANKS WITH THEM. EVEN IN THE VAGUEST OF TERMS TALKING ABOUT LOVE AND LOVING PEOPLE THAT IS TRULY REVEALING. WHAT KANYE WEST SAYS OR DOES IN THE DAYS AHEAD IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE CONVERSATION HE STARTED. AND WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A BAD BOY LIKE KIM KARDSHIAN'S HUSBAND COULD BE THE CATALYST FOR AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE COOERS CONFORMITY OF THOUGHT
