1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
This is Amber Galloway Gallego, she's

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,019
interpreting a song for you in

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,230
traditional American Sign Language. Now

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,150
here's the same song but it's in a

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,340
specialized version of American Sign

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,020
Language just for music. You might

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,820
actually recognize this riff it's from

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,180
"Don't Wanna Fight" by Alabama Shakes. So

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,130
which one connects you more with the

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:33,210
music? Hi I'm Amber Galloway Gallego. She's

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,100
interpreted concerts in ASL for

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,380
literally every artist view you could think of.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,739
Adele, Kendrick Lamar, Drake. I think it's

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,620
up to 400 a little bit over 400 now.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,480
Amber is a part of a growing number of

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,340
ASL interpreters that work to translate a hearing centric music world into a

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,039
visual one. I want to introduce you to

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,170
three very talented women please welcome

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,060
Holly Maniatty.  That's Holly.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,060
and Jo Rose Benfield and Amber Galloway Gallego each of these

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,960
women is a nationally certified sign

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,770
language interpreter and even more

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,900
importantly they have fun with it. ASL,

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,030
American Sign Language is fairly new it

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,280
was only technically like really

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,700
approved in the early 1960s saying yes

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,799
it's an official language. It has its own

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,619
rules for grammar and syntax and there

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,290
are five parameters that everyone has to

30
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,619
follow. The first is hand shape. Now this

31
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,930
is a sign for mom and this is a sign

32
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,930
for dad. The hand shape in both cases has

33
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,079
to look like this. You have palm

34
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,450
orientation, so your palm can't be facing

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,899
down or up. And then there's location. The

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:44,700
hand has to be placed on the chin for

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,490
mom and the forehead for dad. And then

38
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,049
you have movement. The fingers have to

39
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,689
wiggle or they can bounce. And finally

40
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,479
there are the nonmanual markers. These

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,880
nonmanual markers are vital in

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,250
conveying instrumental sounds. That's

43
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,990
going to be the expression here, but also

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,939
the expression that happens on your body

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,450
right like usually it's like mom but

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,500
it's like mah, dah.

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,709
The deaf community is made up of a

48
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,840
diverse group of people who have a wide

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,810
range of residual hearing. Some might be

50
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,220
able to hear lower frequencies like

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,450
drums or bass but not higher frequencies

52
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,600
like vocals or guitars. And of course,

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,730
everyone can feel the vibrations of

54
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,790
music especially at live events. So what

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,700
the interpreters have done for many

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,220
years is they've ignored the sounds and

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,550
solely focused on the English. So this is a

58
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,220
sign for music right like this can you see it?

59
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,620
So you'll hear music and this is what the

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,038
interpret does

61
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:50,180
"music"

62
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,700
and that's all they

63
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,069
do and that's what they have been doing

64
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:56,790
for years and years and years. So here's how

65
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,190
Amber solved this problem. I thought about

66
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,690
basses and how thick they sound right?

67
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,190
 

68
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,840
And when there's a fat person they'll be

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,790
like this like they'll show a person

70
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,579
like this but they do this. You have to do

71
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:14,820
this to show thickness and density

72
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,400
right so you'll see my lower sounds are

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,310
lower put here and then my higher sounds

74
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,829
go up and you'll see my facials move to that

75
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,890
so I'm like wow like the wow wow

76
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,680
wow so you'll see that bow wow and then

77
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,230
I show this to show the waviness. There's

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,090
actually footage of her doing this exact

79
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,190
thing on stage with the Red Hot Chili

80
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,660
Peppers

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,240
if we merely show the sign for music

82
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,100
then we are doing an injustice as an

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,860
interpreter.

84
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,400
So after listening to the

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,160
beat and how their their tonality is and

86
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,320
all the instruments then what I do is I

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,200
break it down from English to ASL. So

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
rhyming, metaphor, and wordplay are an

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,310
intrinsic part of lyrical music

90
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,280
especially hip-hop so how do you

91
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,100
translate that to a visual form of

92
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,620
communication? Let's look at Eminem's "The

93
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,200
Monster" featuring Rihanna. Ok where he

94
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,960
says "in the draft turn nothing into

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,420
something still can make that straw into

96
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,510
gold chump I will spin Rumpelstiltskin

97
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,030
in a haystack" Rumpelstiltskin is the

98
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,490
fairy tale about straw turning into gold.

99
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,520
So that part is where I take it and I

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,950
take it the rhymes out of my pocket and

101
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,850
I write and then I show it like that

102
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,680
like it's like I'm expressing it that's

103
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,720
how you like express and then I show it

104
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
become a gold record and then I say "poom"

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,780
where he says "chump" where it's like "I beat

106
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,180
you." Of course this all has to happen at

107
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,920
the rate in which Eminem raps.

108
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,500
"It's payback Russell Wilson

109
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,440
Falling way back in the draft

110
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,540
Turn nothing into something

111
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,520
still can make that,

112
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,040
straw into gold chump,

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,300
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack.

114
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,620
You can also combine two

115
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,870
signs in ASL to convey wordplay. Amber

116
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,730
did this with Future's "F*ck Ups Some

117
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,240
Commas"

118
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,600
Fuck up some commas let's fuck up some commas.

119
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,680
Let's fuck up some commas

120
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,230
This is a sign for like commas like

121
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,510
showing the number but I did it with the

122
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,440
"fuck up" with "fuck" so i did that.

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,540
So you might not be able to rhyme in ASL but

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,220
you can certainly get the cleverness

125
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,130
across. You have to truncate your signs

126
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,830
to be able to keep up with the beat to

127
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,169
make sure it's looking like rap. Since

128
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:35,060
the enactment of the Americans with

129
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,360
Disabilities Act in 1990 concert venues

130
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,919
have been required to provide

131
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,038
interpreters for deaf attendees.

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,740
When asking to get

133
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,540
services that is the biggest

134
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,030
barrier that we have in the world today.

135
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,430
It's vitally important that concert

136
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,710
venues hire interpreters who understand

137
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,350
the emotional power of music. Like for

138
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,420
example like the national anthem like if

139
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,400
you were to interpret Whitney Houston's

140
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,480
is going to be drastically different

141
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,790
than like Barbra Streisand's right? And

142
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,580
we can't just say I'm standardizing the

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,810
sign and this is what I'm going to

144
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,760
always sign. Like for the sign "brave"

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,070
right you do "brave" and I'll see some

146
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,630
people just go through the motions of

147
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,070
the actual signs and then they'll do

148
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,750
"brave" and Whitney Houston still singing

149
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,720
you know going through her long-ass

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:32,300
"brave."

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,700
That's the whole reason to go to music

152
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,920
events is to be a part of this experience

153
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,020
and forget about the rest of the world

154
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,930
and be there in that moment and so many

155
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,850
times deaf people are not allowed that

156
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,800
experience because we as hearing people

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:00:00,000
choose to say no
