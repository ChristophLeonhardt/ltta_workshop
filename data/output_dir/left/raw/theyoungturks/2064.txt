1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,680
WISCONSIN GOV.'S GOT WALKER HAS
BEEN ORDERED BY JUDGES TO FILL

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,480
TWO VACANT LEGISLATIVE SEATS BY
CALLING FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,560
THIS IS SOMETHING WALKER DID NOT
WANT TO DO AND I WILL GIVE

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:24,930
YOU THE REASONS IN JUST 

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:34,680
A
MINUTE.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,030
HE WANTED LAWMAKERS TO CHANGE
THEIR ELECTION LAW SO THEY

7
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:44,260
WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE
SPECIAL ELECTION.

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,010
JUDGES GOT INVOLVED AND SAID
YOU NEED TO CALL A SPECIAL

9
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,280
ELECTION AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
IMMEDIATELY.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,749
SPECIAL ELECTIONS WILL HAPPEN ON
JUNE 12 AND TO GIVE YOU SOME

11
00:00:55,749 --> 00:01:15,360
IDEA INTO THE STORY, IT ALL
BEGAN Ã± SO THEY MOVE ON TO SERVE

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,860
WALKER, AND SERVE FOR HIS
ADMINISTRATION BUT THOSE

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:24,810
CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY LEFT
BEHIND NEED TO BE REPRESENTED.

14
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,341
WALKER DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT
ELECTION AND PART OF THE REASON

15
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:32,990
WHY IS BECAUSE DISTRICTS THAT
HAVE ACTUALLY DONE VERY WELL FOR

16
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:48,160
TRUMP ARE NOW STARTING TO FLIP
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
LET'S

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:57,760
MOVE ON TO GRAPHIC 34.

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,420
WALKER
HAD TREATED ABOUT IT AT THE TIME

20
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,340
AND SAID REPUBLICAN SHOULD BE
CONCERNED.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,180
HE MADE IT CLEAR HE WAS ALARMED
AND CONCERNED WHICH IS WHY HE

22
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,519
WANTED TO PREVENT THIS SPECIAL
ELECTION FROM HAPPENING.

23
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:19,950
WALKER COMPLAINED BY SAYING THAT
ERIC HOLDER AND OTHER LIBERALS

24
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:37,060
ARE USING THE SITUATION TO RAISE
MONEY FOR THEIR BATTLES.

25
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,659
IT IS JUST FUNNY, THE
PROJECTION.

26
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:47,569
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I DO IS
THE REST OF THAT TWEET.

27
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,849
THOSE PEOPLE DESERVE TO BE
REPRESENTED AND HE WENT TO SUCH

28
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:54,629
EXTREMES TO THE WAY THIS CITY
COULD ACTUALLY REWRITE A LAW TO

29
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,499
PREVENT THERE FROM BEING THE
SELECTION SPEAKS TO HOW THEY

30
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:02,870
WILL DEAL WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE
DECK.

31
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:10,230
ANNA MADE A GOOD POINT THAT WE
GET ANGRY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY

32
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,480
ARE SO BRAZEN AND NAKED IN THE
WAY TO GO AFTER THE

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,090
REDISTRICTING AND THEY TAKE
CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT AND THEY

34
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:26,739
DON'T EVEN TAKE STOCK OF THE
OTHER SIDE SO THAT THERE CAN BE

35
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,219
SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE TO
ADDRESS ALL PARTIES FOR AT LEAST

36
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:38,769
LISTEN TO ALL PARTIES.

37
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,390
THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY CHANGE
LEGISLATION TO AVOID AN

38
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,810
ELECTION.

39
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,079
AND WAS SAYING I AM SICK OF
THIS, WE PLAY NICE AND TRY TO

40
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:52,439
FIND COMPROMISE, AND THEY GO
OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDS.

41
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:59,170
THIS IS DEALING OFF THE BOTTOM
OF THE DECK, THAT IS WHAT SCOTT

42
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,480
WALKER IS DOING

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,840
TO GIVE YOU MORE CONTACTS,
THOSE TWO SEATS HAVE BEEN VACANT

44
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,450
SINCE DECEMBER 2017.

45
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,049
WE ARE NOW QUICKLY APPROACHING
APRIL 2018.

46
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,579
PART OF WALKER'S ARGUMENT WAS
THAT SPECIAL ELECTION IS A WASTE

47
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:18,660
OF TAXPAYER MONEY BECAUSE WE
WILL CALL THE ELECTION AND SOON

48
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,430
ENOUGH THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS
WILL HAVE TO RUN FOR

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,800
REELECTION SO WHY WOULD WE HOLD
THE ELECTION NOW.

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,570
I GUESS IF THESE SEATS BECAME
VACANT TODAY, I STILL

51
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,840
WOULDN'T BUY IT.

52
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,180
THESE SEATS HAVE BEEN VACANT
SINCE LAST YEAR.

53
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,830
HE PURPOSELY HAS BEEN PUSHING
THIS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IN AN

54
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,789
EFFORT TO PREVENT THE
POSSIBILITY OF A DEMOCRAT

55
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,920
GETTING ELECTED.

56
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,000
BY THE WAY EVEN AS BEST CASE
SCENARIO FOR THE LEFT TO

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,080
DEMOCRATS DO GET ELECTED,
REPUBLICAN STILL CONTROL

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,590
THE LEGISLATURE.

59
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,690
IT IS JUST THAT HE IS TOO AFRAID
TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN

60
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,690
THESE ELECTIONS.

61
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,139
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP ANY
GROUND.

62
00:05:12,139 --> 00:00:00,000
THE GOOD THING HE CAN SAY IS
THAT THE STATE IS SHIFTING.
