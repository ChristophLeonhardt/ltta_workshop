we see news is reporting tonight that the president's anger is volcanic the Washington Post is using the same word to describe the president's anger and the Washington Post says that the president is quote absolutely livid over what he considers a treasonous act of disloyalty meaning of course the publication of an op-ed piece in The New York Times today by an anonymous author with the title I am part of the resistance inside the Trump administration Washington Post reports that the president suspects that the administration official who wrote the piece quote works on national security issues or in the Justice Department according to two people familiar with his private discussions in on that point of suspicion I actually agree with the president I agree with that suspicion and I will as I said offer my guess about who wrote that op-ed piece later in this hour we will open it up for that later in the hour the striking thing about the Trump White House reaction to the op-ed piece is the full acceptance of the idea that someone inside the Trump administration really is the author of the piece there is no reason to doubt that of course because the New York Times would never fall asleep the author of this piece who they simply identify as a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by his disclosure those are the words describing the New York Times source and one strategy for Donald Trump could have been to insist that the article is completely fake that it doesn't come from anyone inside the White House and the closest he has actually come to saying that in his volcanic reaction on Twitter and elsewhere is to just weakly put it as a question saying does the so-called senior administration official really exist or is it just the failing New York Times with another phony source and in that same tweet the president then believing that the source does exist insists that the New York Times should turn that person over to the government for national security purposes the op-ed piece comes a day after excerpts from Bob Woodward's new book fear pain a very similar picture of the workings of the Trump presidency the op-ed says quote many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations I would know I am one of them the root of the problem is the president's immorality the president's leadership style which is impetuous adversarial petty and ineffective senior officials will privately admit their daily belief their daily disbelief at the commander-in-chief's comments and actions most are working to insulate their operations from his whims it may be cold comfort in this chaotic era but Americans should know that there are adults in the room we fully recognize what is happening and we are trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't and in what is the single most dramatic revelation in the op-ed piece the author says given the instability many witness there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th amendment which would start a complex process for removing the president but no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis so we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until one way or another it's over given the instability that I witnessed there were early comments on this program at this hour about the 25th amendment I believe this was the first place where the 25th amendment was discussed after Donald Trump was inaugurated exactly one month into the Trump presidency perhaps with some members of the Trump cabinet watching I described how the 25th amendment can be used to remove the president and make the vice president what the 25th amendment calls the Acting President under the 25th amendment the vice president and the majority of the cabinet can decide to invoke the 25th amendment here's what I said one month into the Trump administration that is entirely up to the vice president and a majority the cabinet they don't need Donald Trump to become medically unable to do the job they don't need a written opinion from a psychiatrist that Donald Trump is insane if the president objects to such an action taken by the vice president and the majority of the cabinet then the amendment provides that quote Congress shall decide the issue and that will be determined by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress and when those votes are counted Mike Pence could become acting president using the 25th amendment is not in fact a complex process as the op-ed described it today but that's that section could of the op-ed could simply mean that the members of the cabinet who were whispering about invoking the 25th amendment early on realized that they probably could not win that two-thirds vote in the House and the Senate after Donald Trump would object to their use of the 25th amendment and that's why they decided not to try it today's op-ed piece will take its place in history for many reasons but it is the first recorded instance in the history of the 25th amendment of that amendment being discussed in a White House where the president is physically healthy and fully conscious the cabinet was whispering about the 25th amendment early on because of Donald Trump's immorality and so according to today's New York Times op-ed piece as the resistance was marching in the streets against the President of the United States some sleeper cells of the resistance were beginning to take up positions inside the Trump administration and tonight the President of the United States will try to go to sleep without knowing who those members of the resistance are in his own white house and in his own administration and so Donald Trump's circle of trust has reportedly been reduced to a point that seemed easily predictable at the outset the Washington Post is reporting tonight Trump already felt that he had a dwindling circle of people he could trust a senior administration official said according to one Trump friend he fretted after Wednesday's op-ed that he could only trust his children leading off our discussion now Jeremy bash MSNBC national security analyst and former chief of staff at the CIA and Defense Department Ron Klain the former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and Al Gore and a former senior aide to President Obama and also with US Ambassador Wendy Sherman former Undersecretary of State for political affairs and an MSNBC Global Affairs contributor Wendy Sherman is the author of the new book not for the faint of heart lessons in Courage power and persistence and Wendy Sherman Donald Trump needs a lesson in what your book teaches but he seems completely oblivious to everything that that all of you on this first panel know about government and how it works and it's the reason you're all here is because this is a story about the internal workings of a White House and of a presidential administration you have all been there and we all know and the world knows that we have never seen anything like what we saw in the New York Times today an ambassador Sherman I just wanna get your reaction to any part of that op-ed piece as you've read it you know there's been a lot of discussion about the process who it is which you'll get to later this evening why he did it why he didn't come forward why he didn't have the courage that John McCain's funeral spoke to all of us about all weekend long but the real point here is what you've said at the beginning it's the president's behavior and I said actually on Morning Joe yesterday that sadly I think he is unfit and he should step aside and it may take a 25th amendment to get him to step aside but what I really think will get him to step aside is November's election I don't think that we will have as you said a two-thirds majority in the house or the Senate Republican controlled they're all too worried about their own high knees quite frankly it will take the election to say the times have changed there's a new generation of leadership we saw that Massachusetts this week and it's time for the kind of courage in the use of power that will protect the United States of America Ron Klain I know you have an educated guess about this too and we're gonna get through the sources we're gonna get to that later in the hour but I want to get your reaction to what was your immediate reaction other than who the author was when you read this today we Lawrence I think it speaks to a constitutional crisis a corruption crisis and a chaos the constitutional crisis is we have a president who members of his own team believe is unfit to be President that's a constitutional crisis there's a corruption crisis here too because the author of this piece essentially says hey we left you in place because we like tax cuts military spending and deregulation and if the Republican Party is complicit in an amoral an unfit president because they're getting goodies for their donors that's just corruption at a rank and serious level and finally there's a chaos crisis that we see both in the Woodward book in this op-ed you have people in the president's administration running around undoing his decisions not following his orders ignoring what he says that's chaotic that's no way to run the government Donald Trump tweeted tonight simply the word treason question mark in capital letters I have an answer for him the answer is no we have not had a treason case in America since World War two because as I've said before in this program and no one seems to listen the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the the Constitution's of reference to treason as being as requiring a declaration of war and requiring cooperation with the country who is who we have declared war with in order to get to the standard of treason and that's why we have not had a treason case since our last declaration of war which is world war ii Jeremy bash pardon that longer parenthesis than I intended but sometimes the president is watching and he might learn something but where do you see this going what happens tomorrow Jeremy in the Trump administration well look I think in some ways this anonymous piece may give rise to other voices to come out to speak out and to say yes indeed we have a two-track presidency and I think this is mostly relevant in the area of national security which is where I suspect this person works but also it's the focus of the piece the two-track presidency where in essence we have foreign policy decision-making that's being carried out by the the career staff the professionals as well as the senior appointees who know how to manage foreign policy issues they are trying to keep things on an even keel trying to work with allies trying to be tough on our Avice and there's the president going off in a completely different direction having policies visa V Russia and North Korea that are completely at odds and I think it's one thing if it happens in domestic policy but when it happens in national security policy its matters of war and peace matters of life and death and Wendy Sherman this op-ed piece creates either more confusion in the world or perhaps more clarity in the world because our partners in the world are adversaries in the world other countries in the world have been wondering all along how you deal with this Trump White House and how you deal with Donald Trump and this op-ed piece is saying you have to find the real person if you really want to deal with the Trump administration on X whatever that is find the real person who's in control of that because it's not the president it's the person who controls the paper involving X and that person might or might not put that piece of paper or remove that piece of paper from the President's desk so dealing with this presidency it seems as a fin piece becomes probably even more complex for foreign countries I think a lot of national security leaders around the world a lot of leaders around the world have gone and found those people that they can relate to that they can talk to but quite frankly in the end it doesn't matter because the president keeps pulling the rug out from under the people who are doing the work we've seen time and time again he'll say I'll meet with President rouhani of Iran any time any place without conditions and then we have secretary Pompeo coming forward and saying well no not really we want these conditions and these conditions in these conditions so in the end of the day no one can be sure who is trying to keep our state our country safe and protected on the right course they're never sure whether the rug is going to be pulled out from under them in the past laurens great Patriots have left our government over issues of morality dick Holbrooke Tony Lake famously during the Vietnam War they were Foreign Service officers they could not stay and I have said too many Foreign Service officers I'm sure Jeremy and Ron I'm saying to other people in the administration that we know stay up until the point where it is ethically and morally not possible for you to do so and then have the courage to speak out and speak your convictions I this person has not spoken anonymously perhaps there's reason why the person did what they did but what really matters here is changing the president United States changing our politics finding the courage the persistence to get the job done for us and right Klain when we think of the principled resignations I consider threshold has been so much lower in the past a mic there was actually one that I can think of in the in the Clinton administration which was an assistant secretary in Health and Human Services about welfare policy because Bill Clinton compromised too much in his view with the Republicans and he on principle resigned over that and run I want to read you something that senator bob Corker said today which it's one of those things that is both shocking and as soon as you read it completely obvious and was somewhere in the back of your head and in your set of assumptions already bob Corker having read the New York Times op-ed piece then said I didn't think that anything was relayed in that op-ed that was new I mean I think this is what all of us have understood to be the situation from day one and so again it's not very I didn't reveal much to me I understand this is the case yeah and it points to another group that is responsible for the situation this op-ed lays out and that's the Republican leadership in Congress which has failed to do their job of holding the president accountable even the ones who tweet and sometimes speak against him bob Corker Jeff Flake you know and and the tisk tisk errs on Capitol Hill you know issue these mild rebukes rhetorically and then go and vote with the president up and down the line and as you mentioned at the outset someone who wanted to invoke the 25th a bill would have to believe they had 2/3 of the Congress behind them for it to stick and what these Republicans on Capitol Hill bowing to Trump's will issuing tweets but not taking stands against him that's what empowers the situation we face as a country right now and Jeremy bash we don't know what two-thirds of either body is going to look like after this upcoming election but here you have as much chaos as we've ever seen in the Trump White House as Donald Trump has been attempting to lead the republicans in their re-election campaigns that's right Lawrence and I think the unavailability the 25th amendment is because first you'd have to have the vice president on board yes second is you'd have to have the majority of the cabinet and third is just referenced you'd have to have 2/3 of both chambers and so what is a professional working on say national security or security matters to do they're gonna put their head down do their job and not do what the president says and carry out this quiet resistance and I just want to say I don't think it's mysterious it's not deep status it's not in any way improper I think it's frankly patriotic I think it's the right thing to do and it's what many of our neighbors colleagues friends here in Washington are sadly doing each and every day thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last word and the rest of MSNBC
