Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year seemed unprecedented they were I don't know almost 50 Arab nations gathered together their Trump very clearly called on them to repudiate I think his words were radical Islamic terrorism I think that's how he phrased it and and they applauded him and and it looked like some sort of reorientation perhaps the Sunni Arabs joining together to preserve themselves against Iran there seemed to be a warming of Arabs towards Israel did this derail that or was this part of that this is part of that if you take the point of view of the status of perhaps the most important of the Sunni Arab states the the goal that the worry is the Islamic Republic of Iran in large part because of Obama's Araki and so you're looking for allies you're looking for strength and who in the region is reliable and strong Israel so you would like to work with this room but for a variety of reasons the continuing Palestinian issue remains something that's a problem and so therefore you'd like to dispatch this you'd like to put it to the side you'd like ideally resolve it but in any case you don't want it to be in front of and so having the US government take a strong stand and push to the Palestinians to the side and say yeah this is not our you you are not our priority is in the end rather helpful for the Saudis and the others yes there was this firestorm over the embassy and the UN on some streets but overall it's sending a strong signal to the Palestinians you are not our priority you are not what's gonna stop this cold and I think that is that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
