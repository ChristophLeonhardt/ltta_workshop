>>DIRECTOR QUENTIN TARANTINO IS
SAYING THAT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO DO
MORE THAN HE DID WITH REGARD TO
THE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT COMING UP AGAINST
HARVEY WEINSTEIN.
IN A RECENT
INTERVIEW HE SAYS THE FOLLOWING
--
>> 
YOU GUYS MAY REMEMBER THAT HE
DATED ACTRESS MIRA SORVINO, HE
SAYS OF THAT --
>> HE DOES A LOT OF EXPLAINING,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THE FULL
CONTEXT OF HIS STATEMENTS, AND
PART WHAT HE SAYS IS --
>> 
HE ALSO CALLS OUT HIS MALE
COUNTERPARTS IN THE
INDUSTRY, HE SAYS --
>> 
THIS IS SUCH A CONFLICTING
STATEMENT TO READ BECAUSE HE'S
ADMITTING TO HIS OWN
CULPABILITY, HE'S SAYING I WAS
WRONG, YET IT IS SO -- WHEN
SOMEONE APOLOGIZES I'M INCLINED
TO BELIEVE THEM BUT AT THE SAME
TIME IT'S SO FRUSTRATING TO HEAR
FROM PEOPLE WHO KNEW IN THE
INDUSTRY, AND THAT'S SOMETHING
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT ON THIS
SHOW, PEOPLE KNEW, HE'S SAYING
PEOPLE KNEW AND THEY LET THIS
SICKNESS, THIS TOXICITY, LAY
DORMANT IN THE INDUSTRY IN ABUSE
WOMEN FOR SO LONG.
HIS OWN
GIRLFRIEND WAS A VICTIM OF THIS.
IT'S INCREDIBLY TROUBLING, YET
AT THE SAME TIME I'M ENCOURAGED
THAT AT LEAST WE ARE HEARING
FROM MEN TRYING TO HOLD EACH
OTHER ACCOUNTABLE.
WHERE YOU
FALL ON THIS?
>>I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION
ONE THING, WHICH IS WEIRD, I'M
SURE IT EXTENDS BEYOND
HOLLYWOOD, AND THAT'S THE
PROFESSIONAL BIND THAT TARANTINO
IS IMPLICITLY REFERENCING HERE.
HE IS SAYING I WANTED TO WORK
WITH HARVEY WEINSTEIN, AND
THAT'S WHY I WAS IN A TOUGH
POSITION, AND THAT'S WHY I
DIDN'T DO MORE.
AS GRACE WAS
SAYING, HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND WAS A
VICTIM OF THIS, HE COULD HAVE
SAID OH MY GOD, WE HAVE TO GO TO
THE POLICE, THIS IS A SERIOUS
SITUATION AND I'VE HEARD OF
OTHER SITUATIONS TOO. IS THAT
TOO MUCH TO HAVE ASKED HIM TO
DO?
BUT HE FELT A PROFESSIONAL
PRESSURE, MAYBE HE RATIONALIZED
IT AS I DON'T THINK THE COPS
WILL DO MUCH AND WEINSTEIN WILL
CRUSH ME, I'LL NEVER GET ANOTHER
MOVIE MADE -- AND THAT'S THE
PROFESSIONAL BIND HE FOUND
HIMSELF IN, AND IT'S WEIRD TO
HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT IT NOW AS HE
LOOKS BACK ON WHAT HE COULD
HAVE DONE.
>>I THINK IT'S SICKENING TO HERE
THE LEVEL OF HONESTY BECAUSE I'M
SURE THAT WAS THE BIND HE FELT,
THEN YOU REALIZE PEOPLE WERE
VALUING THEIR PROFESSIONAL
CAREERS AND WEIGHING THAT WITH
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY KNEW TO BE
TRUE OF ASSAULT AT THE HANDS OF
THIS MOVIE MOGUL.
>>THIS IS THE TIPPING POINT,
THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR
HOLLYWOOD, BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE
BOTH SAID IS RIGHT.
PEOPLE HAVE
CARED MORE ABOUT THE BOTTOM
LINE, MORE ABOUT THEIR PROFIT,
THEIR RETURN, THEN THE SAFETY OF
THEIR COLLEAGUES AND WOMEN IN
THIS INDUSTRY.
AND MEN.
THERE
ARE YOUNG MEN WHO HAVE ALSO BEEN
PREYED ON BY OLDER PEOPLE IN THE
INDUSTRY, SO IT IS CONFLICTING,
I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS, BUT I
WANT TO APPLAUD THE WOMEN WHO
HAVE FOUND THE COURAGE AND
STRENGTH TO COME FORWARD AND
TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES.
AS
DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS TO HEAR
THAT TARANTINO KNEW ABOUT THIS
AND COULD HAVE DONE MORE, I'M SO
GLAD SOMEONE IS FINALLY COMING
OUT AND SAYING YES I HAVE EGG ON
MY FACE, I KNEW THIS WAS
HAPPENING, BECAUSE WE SAW THOSE
COWARDLY STATEMENTS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE STUFF CAME OUT,
AND I WAS JUST DISGUSTED.
>>BECAUSE I THINK THE TRUTH, AS
MUCH AS IT STINGS, FEELS BETTER
THAN THE LIP SERVICE WE GOT IN A
LOT OF THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE
RELEASED OF MAN THAT YOU KNEW
KNEW.
WE ALL KNEW THE KNEW, I'M
SAYING KNEW TOO MUCH, BUT IT'S
REFRESHING AND SICKENING AT THE
SAME TIME FOR TARANTINO TO SAY I
WAS WRONG, I MESSED UP, AND I'M
CALLING ON MY MALE COUNTERPARTS
IN THE INDUSTRY TO SAY WE NEED
TO DO BETTER, AND THE FIRST STEP
IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU MESSED
UP FOR YEARS AND ALLOW THIS TO
GO ON, NOW I FEEL LIKE WE CAN
GROW, BUT WE CAN'T GROW FROM LIP
SERVICE, FROM SOMEONE GOING MY
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH
THE VICTIMS, I HAD NO IDEA, SO
SAD, I HAVE DAUGHTERS --
THAT DOESN'T HELP US.
WE ARE GROWING FROM THIS
STATEMENT, THE INDUSTRY
WILL GROW.
>>I CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE
STATEMENT THAT YOUR PUBLICIST
TOLD YOU TO SAY, SO I WOULD LOVE
TO SEE MORE PEOPLE COME OUT AND
HAVE THE SAME KIND OF HONESTY
AND SELF REFLECTION TARANTINO
HAD.
>>IT'S FUNNY, NOT FUNNY HA HA,
JUST INTERESTING, FUNNY
INTERESTING TO THINK BACK ON THE
BILL COSBY CASE AND HOW YOU
NEEDED THAT FIRST, THAT HANNIBAL
BURRESS MENTIONED, YOU GUYS ALL
KNOW HE'S A RAPIST -- AND ALL OF
A SUDDEN THE NATION TURNED ITS
HEAD AT ONCE AND FOCUSED ON
THAT, AND IN THIS CASE YOU
NEEDED THOSE FIRST ACCOUNTS TO
COME FORWARD AND BE IN THE
PUBLIC RECORD, AND THEN THIS
TORRENT BEGAN.
AND I SUSPECT IT
WILL CONTINUE, AND THEN BROADEN
TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE MEN,
WHICH IS WHY I MENTION IT.
AT
SOME POINT IT GETS SAFER TO COME
OUT.
>>ABSOLUTELY.
QUITE EARLY ON
THEY ARE JUST SAYING I WANT A
NONCOMMITTAL STATEMENT, I DON'T
WANT TO GET INVOLVED, I DON'T
WANT ANY OF THIS ON ME.
>>THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO -- THIS
IS ONE THING, QUENTIN TARANTINO
COMING OUT, BUT REALLY THE
COURAGEOUS IS IN THE SURVIVORS
COMING OUT.
WE NEED TO CELEBRATE
THE PEOPLE COMING FORWARD WHO
ARE THE TIPPING POINT, NOT THE
PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT ON THE
CREST OF THE WAVE.
THAT SAID I THINK THIS IS A GOOD
GROWING MOMENT.
>>I WOULD RATHER SOMEONE WEIGHT
LIKE HE DID AND COME OUT WITH
SOMETHING REAL THAT WE CAN DO
SOMETHING WITH.
>>DON'T WAIT AND SPEED DELL YOUR
PUBLICIST.
>>BUT THINK ABOUT HOW LOCKDOWN
HE WAS, WHEN I THINK ABOUT MIRA
SORVINO, SHE IS COMING BACK AND
TELLING HIM THIS HAPPENED, AND
ON SOME LEVEL FOR HIM TO
CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE
WEINSTEIN COMPANY, SHE IS HAVING
TO SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT
HONEY, IT'S OKAY, I'M USED TO
THIS, BELIEVE ME DIRECTORS DO IT
ALL THE TIME -- IT SPEAKS TO THE
CULTURE OF HOLLYWOOD THAT
SOMEHOW HE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE
TO DO BUSINESS, AND SHE WASN'T
BOTHERED BY IT.
SHE WASN'T
SAYING HOW DARE YOU DO THIS?
THERE IS COMPLICITY ALL AROUND
TO BE SHARED.
