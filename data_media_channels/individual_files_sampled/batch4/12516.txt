Morgan's has been how did you know you wanted to marry your wife and how long does it take for you to propose I knew I wanted to marry her for a couple of reasons so I think that here is the typical pathway for men deciding they want to get married first there has to be physical attraction okay this is just the reality when men are our first attracted to a woman it's because there's a physical attraction to the woman so my wife happens to be smoking hot so this definitely was the was the initial draw but the in the first date I mean I I dated a lot of women one time and decided in one day anymore because they were not either intellectually stimulating or have the same values she not only there was more than just a spark there's what I'm saying it's easy to find I think a certain level of chemistry particularly sexual chemistry with people I don't think that's the hardest thing in the world to find what is hard to find is somebody who shares her values and my wife and I on our first date for three hours discussed free will and determinism and how many kids we each wanted to have I mean we're dating for marriage and so you have to do you I'm not saying it saying sit there with a checklist but you do have to have a group of things in your head that you want out of a spouse and I don't mean like they're going to you know shine your shoes or make dinner for you I mean things like what kind of life do they want to build and what kind of values do they hold dear because that's the stuff you're gonna be able to build a future on Jonathan height has a chapter in the happiness hypothesis about love and one of the things he points out is that when you first meet your potential mate then the level of passion and passionate love is an equals of passionate love and companionate love compassionate love is like here on the scale and companionate love meaning how well you know the person how much you love them for who they are as a companion is down here and this falls off from in about six months passionate love falls off within six months or a year a couple of years the most it doesn't mean that doesn't exist anymore but it just is different okay I can tell you as somebody's in married for 10 years the feeling that you have for your spouse particularly the kind of the kind of fiery need that you have for your spouse at the very beginning is not the same fire is not the same burning need that you have for your spouse throughout your life and the companion to love tends to rise so passionate love declines companionate love rises that's the way it should happen because companion at love is more important when you're building a life and building a family who you want to have sex with is a pretty arbitrary decision to a certain extent
