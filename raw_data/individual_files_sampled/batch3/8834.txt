Martha: IT IS PRIMARY NIGHT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES TONIGHT IS THE MIDTERM OUTLOOK LOOKS TO BE CHANGING DAILY AS DEMOCRATS BLUE WAVE PROSPECTS IT'S AROUND PLUS THREE, PLUS FOUR, PLUS AND SOME IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THEM AND A TOP G.O.P. PACK IS SAYING IF THE MIDTERMS WERE HELD TODAY THEY THINK THEY WOULD KEEP THE HOUSE, SO ARE THEY RIGHT? HERE'S WHAT WE FIND OUT TONIGHT. FOUR STATES ON THE BOARD, PENNSYLVANIA, NEBRASKA, IDAHO AND OREGON. THE POLLS CLOSE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE HER DULL MY CURRENT HOUSE G.O.P. AND FROM SUPPORT OF LOU BARLETTA HOPES TO BEAT FELLOW REPUBLICAN JIM CHRISTIANA IN THE PRIMARY THERE AND THE WINNER WILL GO UP AGAINST INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BOB CASEY, THE KC NAME OBVIOUSLY IS STORIED AND HAS A LONG HISTORY IN PENNSYLVANIA, SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH ONE FOR REPUBLICANS AND IT IS CLEARLY ONE TO WATCH. HERE NOW, POLITICAL EXPERT CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS POLITICS EDITOR AND MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S INSTITUTE FOR POLITICS. WAIT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU TONIGHT. HOWDY, MA'AM. Martha: CHRIS, LET ME START WITH YOU. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY TONIGHT? WE GOT SIX RACES ON OUR FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S SIX HOUSE RACES. DEMOCRATS COULD COME OUT OF THERE WITH AS MANY AS A NET FOUR. REPUBLICANS ARE CEDING A LOT OF TERRITORY BUT IT'S GOING TO DEPEND A LOT ON HOW THESE PRIMARY GO. IT'S A LITTLE HARDER FOR DEMOCRATS TO FLIP AS IN A INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN WHO DOESN'T HAVE A TON OF BAGGAGE. THEY ARE HAVING A TOUGH PRIMARY. IT'S GETTING BETTER, THE KIND OF CANDIDATES THAT NATIONAL CANDIDATES WANT. SHE'S A FORMER REPUBLICAN, SHE'S A MODERATE. A VETERAN, AN ATTORNEY, SHE IS A YOUNG WOMAN BUT SHE IS UP AGAINST AND ENTRANCED LOCAL FORCE, A TRIAL LAWYER. THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S RACES LIKE THAT THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEMOCRATS HAVE THE HORSES THEY NEED TO KNOCK OFF REPUBLICANS AND TURN IT FROM A GOOD YEAR TO A GREAT YEAR FOR THEM. Martha: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT IS THAT THERE IS A FLOOD OF DEMOCRATS IN THESE PRIMARIES AND THE CONCERN FOR YOUR PARTY THAT THERE MAY BE TOO MANY, THAT THEY MIGHT DILUTE EACH OTHERS CHANCES AND CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES JUMPING INTO THESE BRACES, THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES RUNNING IN DISTRICTS THAT THE PARTY HASN'T FIELDED A CANDIDATE IN DECADES IN SOME CASES. I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE ENERGY THAT DEMOCRATS ARE FEELING RIGHT NOW. WE'VE BEEN SEEING THIS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF ALL THESE SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND NOW THROUGH THE PRIMARY SEASON OR DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT IS UP. OFTENTIMES SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMING WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST. Martha: LET ME STAY WITH YOU FOR JUST A SECOND. COREY BLISS, INTERESTING FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP FUND. THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE HOUSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. KEVIN McCARTHY AND PAUL RYAN. THEY ARE FEELING PRETTY OPTIMISTIC FROM WHAT THEY ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW AND HE'S SAYING THAT HIS ADVICE TO DEMOCRATS IF THEY WANT TO WIN IS DON'T NOMINATE PROGRESSIVES. DON'T TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND DON'T TALK ABOUT RUSSIA. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON THOSE THREE THINGS? NO, BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY NOT HEARING THAT FOR MOST DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN THE RACES THAT THEY ARE RUNNING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADS THAT MOST DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN THESE COMPETITIVE SEATS ARE RUNNING, THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AND THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. THEY ARE TALKING PRIMARILY ABOUT ECONOMIC ISSUES AND BREAD-AND-BUTTER ISSUES AND DRAWING CONTRAST WITH THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. THEY ARE GOING AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY BUT THAT'S ONLY PART OF THE EQUATION FOR THEM. WE SAW THAT WITH CONOR LAM IN A SPECIAL ELECTION UPSET EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE ARE SEEING IT IN A LOT OF THESE RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S WHERE I EXPECT MOST OF THE CANDIDATES IN THESE REAL SWING DISTRICTS LIKE THE ONE WE ARE SEEING IN PENNSYLVANIA WILL LAND. Martha: REPUBLICANS ARE RAISING A LOT OF MONEY. THAT CLF, $71 MILLION VERSUS $2 MILLION IN THE SAME CYCLE LAST TIME AROUND. THE AMERICAN ACTION FUND HAS SIMILAR GROWTH. CANNOT MONEY PUT THEM OVER THE TOP AND SOME OF THESE RACES? IT'S GOOD TO HAVE NATIONAL MONEY. NATIONAL MONEY IS GREAT, BUT IT COMES WITH NATIONAL DIRECTION. BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COMPARABLY THIS YEAR IS THEY HAVE ON THE RACE BY RACE LEVEL, DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE BETTER AT RAISING MONEY ON THE CANDIDATE BY CANDIDATE BASIS. YOU SAW WITH CONNOR LAM VERSUS RICK, A GOOD EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAD ALL THIS NATIONAL, CORPORATE MONEY FLOWING THROUGH A BIG SPIGOT TO TRY TO HELP THEM OUT. CONNOR LAM WAS GETTING DIRECT MONEY AND GENERALLY, GENERALLY THERE ARE IDIOTS ON EVERY LEVEL, BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE CANDIDATES CLOSEST THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE RACE ARE BETTER AT KNOWING WHAT THE RACE NEEDS, SO THE DEMOCRATS TO HAVE THAT GOING FOR THEM. Martha: CHRIS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS AND THE ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS HAS NARROWED IN POLLS OVER THE RECENT WEEKS. IS THAT MEANINGFUL TO YOU? DEMOCRATS TO A CERTAIN DEGREE LIVING WITH THE FALSE EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE SET AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THINGS WERE JUST A TOTAL GARBAGE BUYER FOR THE REPUBLICANS. IT'S BEEN A CONSISTENT FIVE, SIX, SEVEN POINTS. IT'S BEEN RIGHT IN THAT SPACE ON AVERAGE. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IF THE ELECTORAL HELD TODAY THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT LOSE THE HOUSE, THEY MIGHT KEEP IT BY A COUPLE SEATS IT WOULD BE ON PAR WITH WHAT WE HAVE EXPECTED HISTORICALLY TO SEE IN PRESIDENTIAL FIRST-TERM MIDTERMS. THE AVERAGE LOSS OF SEATS IS 24, HISTORICALLY SPEAKING.
