I think I've got some credibility here to talk about the Russian investigation and here's what I mean by that I said from day one for nearly a year now I think Trump did it and by it I mean things way worse than just exchanging emails and trying to figure out Hillary's emails during the campaign or encouraging the Russians to run a couple of fake ads on Facebook I've said from day one that I think that they have a financial relationship I think that there is a ton of circumstantial evidence that is already out in the public but let's find out what Muller concludes and then and then we'll take it from there okay so that is my view of the Russian investigation visa vie Trump so now the Russian investigation is - apparently targeting Jill Stein okay now they have jumped the shark now and again I have credibility here because I had Jill Stein on the show plenty time certain election but then I said much to the chagrin of many progressives that I think that it was a smart thing to do to vote for Hillary Clinton especially in blue states I said that because I didn't want the monster Donald Trump winning by the way the other person who didn't want the monster Donald Trump winning was Jill Stein she in fact had raised 7.3 million dollars to do a recount in three critical battleground states to double-check that Trump had actually won so I think that that earns her tremendous amount of credibility but apparently not enough because now I think we've gotten to witch-hunt stage it's one thing if you're going after the person who you think might have had a ties with the Russians what is this so let me give you the details so we're gonna go to NBC News here to Senate committees probing Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election have now asked for materials related to green party candidate Jill Stein's campaign okay so what are they looking for and let's find out what the so-called charges are the environmentalists an advocate of better relations with Russia has been a Kremlin favorite since her first run as a Green Party's presidential candidate in 2012 writes Robert wind room NDC news as he finds a pitchfork for himself but it's a pitchfork for the establishment what do you mean has been a Kremlin favorite what does that mean like this is what I'm talking about this smears people it look is Jill Stein have a position on Russia that's different than mine almost certainly right that doesn't mean that I get to call her a Kremlin favorite based on what evidence how do you wait do you have emails from the Kremlin saying Jill Stein we really like her manborg she is one of our favorites no you made it up this is not real reporting so the Russian embrace of Jill Stein was anything but subtle Andrew Weiss says he's a Carnegie Endowment for international peace for so-called Russia expert Russia's state propaganda continues outlets like RT had a field day with her striding attacks on US political establishment and they seem to work hand in glove wait wait a minute wait a minute so oh you're not allowed to criticize American policies anymore had a field day with her strident attacks on US political establishment we're not allowed to attack the political establishment otherwise were working with the Russians or the Chinese or the the Martians what what kind of insanity is this a Russia expert but you have any evidence of Russia working with Jill Stein I don't say anything publicly I don't see anything privately I don't say anything circumstantial I don't say anything direct oh she went on RT a couple of times RT was a a media organization and now we know that they have more ties and and with the Russian government and I think that that's a whole separate conversation I know that they were owned by the Russians Al Jazeera's owned by Qatar and I would argue that CNN largely serves the American government and we can have those discussions in the basement and BBC is owned by the British government in a sense oh yeah I went on BBC to do propaganda for the British what no it was a media outlet that people went on that proves absolutely nothing conservatives went on there liberals went on their model it's went on there you're gonna round up everybody that went on our team that's your evidence and it's pathetic second of all is it now somehow wrong or illegal to criticize the quote US political establishment then lock me up because yes I don't give a damn what your so-called Russia expert says I'm going to criticize the US political establishment you don't want to know why because I love this country and I want to make it better I don't want to sit around and go oh you know I think Donald Trump is my interests in mind I'm gonna listen to the Dear Leader whatever he says must be true and I'm certainly not gonna say that about Hillary Clinton either so if you want to bow your head to the political establishment go ahead but it is not yet a crime in America now what evidence do they have anything on Jill Stein the one thing they always come back to you she was once at a dinner so they have the picture and if you label people in the pictures it seems more nefarious so there's Putin and there's Flynn and they're Steinem there's some other people from across the world who you labelled them oh wow she did all that sounds so dangerous then they're done done done done man but what did they talk about what did they say so in fact Jill Stein I think I should have gotten a better deal she apparently paid her own way to go over there they probably would have chipped in for your flight in hotel okay that was back in 2015 if she had asked me hey I'm gonna go get to meet Putin and have this dinner and I'm like oh that sounds interesting uh I don't know that I wouldn't have not met with Putin in 2015 it doesn't mean you work with the guy I've held I met a thousand people including Steve Bannon who I do not like at all it doesn't mean anything so now if you said to me go meet with Putin given what I've said about him mm I don't think I'd do that okay but back then to criticize her for that okay so it doesn't matter we went in and asked her about at TYT investigates Michael Tracy talked to her and she said there's been a smear campaign going on for about a year and a lot of people have been poisoned by that Stein said speculating the possible motives for the Senate committees request for information and she continued and so they think that there was something really nefarious going on around that table because a lot of people asserted that and betrayed it as if it was a close conversation hardly she explained further no names were exchanged no eye contact nada just a quick handshake that's it there was nothing meaningful at that dinner me that's what we're parsing now did Jill Stein make eye contact with Putin at that dinner you know why Michael Flynn is in trouble for that dinner because he got $45,000 and then did not we ported when he was supposed to that's a violation of the law if Michael Flynn had said yeah oh yeah I went to have dinner over there the RT flew me in about zero had BBC had I'd have gone the same and it folded out in this form that we wouldn't have anywhere near this kind of issue he lied about it because maybe he did something there he wants to cover up Jill Stein has been transparent about it from day one she didn't cover it up she didn't fill out any forms wrong and she didn't get any money this is what looks like a witch-hunt okay so now we're gonna go to more establishment people Michael McFaul former US ambassador to Russia and an NBC News analyst such as it is said that Stein quote most certainly influence the outcome of the 2016 election giving the outcome was decided in three states and by 70,000 votes wait what does that have to do with you being a Russian ambassador so yes we know what happened so Ralph Nader influenced outcome 2000 election was he working for the Portuguese or for Singapore or Botswana what are people not allowed to run against the establishment anymore so I said to vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election definitely not the primary in the general election because I was worried that the monster Donald Trump would win I would argue that I was right about that but that doesn't mean that I think that anyone who didn't is suspect and working with the Russians and our traders or something no no it's okay cuz Michael McFaul did the math we all know was 78 thousand votes what does that have to do with you being a rush ambassador to Russia what evidence do you have you don't have any evidence we all know what the vote count was that's not evidence against Jill Stein that's saying third parties should be outlawed and everyone should bow their heads to the establishment this is look at this there's not a single shred of evidence in here it's just I don't like her and she shot him she was against the political establishment everybody should be forced to vote for Hillary Clinton hell no okay Andrew we're back Andrew Weiss this another so-called expert the guy I quoted earlier he says her talking points on hot-button issues like the war in Ukraine look like she's reading off a Kremlin supplied script another so-called Russia expert here well do you have the script do you have emails saying hey dr. Stein please say this you have any evidence connecting there nope it just so happens that her position on Ukraine is similar to Putin's or to the Russian government's by the way I don't agree with her position on Russia but that doesn't mean that I think that she's a secret agent she's allowed to have regular positions on different policy issues we don't all have to agree and we most certainly don't have to agree with you or your favorite candidate this is unreal so now I'm gonna go back to Michael McFaul okay look I'm quoting their experts if their experts don't have anything why did you write this stupid article okay he says RT has promoted and often exaggerated the importance of third party political leaders and fringe social movements in the United States with the aim of exacerbating social tensions in the United States RT has featured third parties when we have gotten our Stooges in the mainstream media to not feature third parties to not give people options we've gotten our lackeys who work for the US government apparently and the establishment here to shut out other voices and make sure Americans have no choice but the Republican and the Democrat that usually the donors hand pick and anyone else is outside the acceptable opinion and and we're gonna label fringe but not only we're gonna label fringe the establishments doing that for a long time but now we're gonna investigate you we're gonna investigate you to see if you're a spy because you dared to have an opinion outside of what the establishment allows well I Got News for You McFaul not everyone had to vote for Hillary Clinton not everyone had to vote for the Democrat or the Republican so it just seems like almost every quote is why didn't they vote for Hillary got why we love Hillary why did they vote for Hillary well I would have rather had this is my third time saying ran I would rather have a had them vote for Hillary than Donald Trump sad day for me sad day for you it's called the democracy no no no no no sir party fridge how dare they why didn't they bow their head earlier I hope they come at you a thousand times harder next time I'm talking about third parties I'm talking about Americans who care and who want to change the government I know you guys don't want to change it you love the status quo you love your stupid think tanks funded by millionaires and billionaires you where you sit around thinking who shall we blame for Hillary's loss so will shall we blame blame Jill Stein then let's make up things then and with no evidence at all well on the last quote here in addition to being interviewed on policy issues science campaign including the Green Party's convention was covered extensively on RT oh don't cover anyone else I mean this is insanity yeah you know I got a note from someone I known in the mainstream press we had Jill Stein on to do a town hall near the end of the election right and the note I got back from a friend was just when we thought the Young Turks who are beginning to be credible they have Jill Stein on well no thank you if you think credibility means you will only support the democratic or republican candidates you will only support what the donor class has handed to you Anna as your false choices no thank you the next time there's an election I'll have a third party on a fourth party on and a fifth party on we're not doing it for the Russians you know who we're doing it for Americans so they actually have choice and so they actually have a democracy I know you guys don't believe in that and then you complain about Russia I've got credibility to complain about Russia you guys you've got nothing because you don't even believe in democracy oh my god art he had third party people on and even covered their convention and their ideas how dare you cover their ideas pathetic finally I'm gonna go back to Jill Stein's quotes when she talked to TYT investigates about this earlier today she said it is quote a resurgence of McCarthyism and she went on to say there are no consequences for the reporters who basically launch these extremely irresponsible and destructive stories that diminish the stature of the press and that legitimizes the charge of fake news so yeah it's full of crap Hey the McFaul x' and the wisest of the world and the Senate investigators and the rest of the establishment I just read a quote from Jill Stein on air I covered her on air you want to investigate us have at it Hoss you took well is I in my opinion an incredibly legitimate investigation of whether the president is tied to a foreign government you've become such a frenzy now that you're just investigating anyone who dared to challenge Hillary Clinton and that isn't that is gonna ruin the credibility of the investigation in the first place if they keep going down this road so monumentally stupid and it's because the establishment cannot see straight they get furious if anyone dares to challenge that
