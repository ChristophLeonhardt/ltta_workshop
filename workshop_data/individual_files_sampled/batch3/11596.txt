so I plan to command all these issues and of course if you have any questions I'll be happy to to answer all of them but before I'll start I want just to tell you that in a website of the of the embassy you can find the report on Salisbury frozen case we're updating this report in the regular basis so the lot the latest one was made yesterday so so it's not just something that is fixed for one publication this is just for your reference to understand what's going on in the sense of the investigation on Salisbury but let me start with the situation in Syria and the military action the u.s. undertook there along with the UK France and they are allies on the 14th of April the massive missile attack on the territory of the Soviet state is an act of aggression by every definition available in the international law international law only allows to use force in self-defense this is number one and under a UN Security Council mandate so there are two cases where the state can use the the force and I mentioned them we condemn the military action by the three Western permanent members of the UN Security Council in violation of the principles of the UN Charter it's impossible to defend international law by violating it and most diplomatic initiative the facts presented by the Syrian government and Russia to show that the incident had been deliberately staged have been ignored this is the we have a lot of this kind of footage from the Russian television and of course from the international one this is the story about the boy his name is Hassan geop and he is 11 years old so basically what happened that the day when the the whole so-called chemical attack was staged he was brought he was called by the white helmets to the to the hospital he was offered some sweets cookies something and he was part of the staging of all the so-called chemical attack you see this boy it's you know it's it's the image after the stage attack and he was with his father by the way the boys planning to come to the of course with his father planning to come to New York and to present this case at the Security Council aid for the members of the Security Council so basically this is how it was staged and that was staged you know this is the white helmets guy who is who is just putting the water all these things this is his father I just give you the just the scent we have dozens of this kind of proofs and everything today is being collected just just to show that everything what was done in Douma was staged thank you and what I want to say is that the missile strikes and we're talking about the British missile strikes well carried out just as inspectors from the organization for prohibition of the chemical weapons then I'll use it OPCW were about to head to do what to begin investigation Prime Minister may in her speech at the Parliament claimed that the Russia and Syria hamper the OPCW experts access to duma this statement is misleading it was Russia that supported the request by Damascus to the OPCW Director General to send experts to duma and did utmost to ensure they arrive and start gathering evidence as quickly as possible it was russia who tabled not one but two draft resolutions at the UN Security Council would aim to establish an investigation into what exactly happened in duma we're interested like all of us in fair incredible investigation following OPCW chain of custody rules Prime Minister May accuses us of failing to comply with the guarantees for destroying of Syrian chemical weapons I would like to remind you that the process for their elimination was launched as the joint initiative of Russia us and OPCW when in January 2016 the OPCW declared the process to be successfully accomplished that was just two years ago no country raised any objections and yet somehow the US UK in France claimed to find new chemical weapon facilities I'm quoting to bomb in Syria if they had information about Syrian chemical facilities continue to produce weapons why not to turn to the OPCW the multilateral procedures for verifying these suspicions are well-established yet judging by the absence of contamination in victims of chemical exposure after the strikes the size bond had nothing to do with the chemical weapons this is just the fact of life let me now come back to the legal issues which were outlined by prime minister may in her speech on monday UK openly claimed that the legal basis for the military action against Syria was I'm quoting humanitarian intervention the doctrine of humanitarian intervention was actively promoted by the West in the 90s it was plainly rejected by the international community there is no authorization in international law to conduct such intervention but even under the humanitarian intervention right Iria which was used by the Prime Minister the arguments put forward by the UK hold no water Prime Minister says three conditions must be met let's consider them one by one the first one the government says the risk must be and I'm quoting Prime Minister convincing evidence generally accepted by the international community as a whole it's very important of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale requiring immediate and urgent relief end of quote the international community was waiting for the OPCW experts to perform their analysis on the side on the incident in two days before that the international community could even be sure that the chemical incident has taken place at all of course this means that the international community as the whole does not consider the allegations of the chemical attack of the duma require urgent relief in the form of the military action and we're talking about the international community as a whole that's very serious second thesis and i'm quoting prime minister it must be objectively clear that there is no practicable alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved our comment again before we speak of life to be saved from the chemical weapon threat we have to make sure that the threat exists for that we have to wait for the OPCW conclusions more broadly lives are being lost in Syria mostly because terrorists and other extremist groups continue fighting being encouraged by the Western backers including the UK instead of joining the political process everybody including the UK is saying that there is no alternative for political solution to the it's astonishing now to hear from the UK that they had been no alternative to the use of force and the last thesis use of force must be necessary and proportionate to the Abe of relief of humanitarian suffering and must be strictly limited in time and scope to this aim end of quote US UK and France launched 103 missiles if the Syrians didn't intercept 71 of them we cannot imagine the numbers of possible casualties of the civilians so much for the proportionality to sum up who have a legal justification that is based on non-existent rule of international law and even within that known rule it is framed in the completely false and inconsistent arguments based on so-called intelligence information and social media actually we are not surprised by that the UK and other Western world countries have long forgotten about their obligations under the international law instead they speak of the I'm quoting rules-based international order what are those rules I assume they mean they mean the rules that they themselves formulate and enforce this is not the kind of international order we want I want and we want the world based on international law and among other things international law as I said only allow us to use force in self-defense or under Security Council mandate and the international law the military operation against Syria is playful but playfully unlawful let me now come back to the so called scrip our case says story nearly seven weeks we have passed since the poisoning of the sergey julius cripple on Salisbury and modern the months since the prime minister to resume accused Russia of this crime the situation hasn't changed since our last briefing the British government still hasn't presented any evidence in support of its position the British government continues to violate international law including Vienna Convention on the council relations and the bilateral Council convention it refuses to gives us the opportunity to verify their whereabouts and wishes of other compote Ria's a malicious blue sheets at was somewhat marala I am going to sure that most of you watch BBC and you know recently you know probably a few days ago I just watched the interview of Admiral West who was talking about the white helmets basically what happened in duma i think this is a very interesting interview because admiral was the head of the military intelligence of this country and he mentioned in this interview that when he wasn't duty he was pressed by the politicians in order to present the right let's say results of the statements instead of telling the truth and what we believed that UK secret services has a huge track record in misleading the government and the public with disastrous consequences like in duma however this time they are offering such an unbelievable picture that nobody could be misled what is a constant for example if the British government had information about Russia's alleged secret chemical program why didn't they raise the matter when the OPCW was certifying the destruction of the Russian chemical weapons in 2000 17 just last year so it looks like at that time they didn't have anything today now it appears they have something if the UK has four years hadn't formed on Russia and quoting investigating ways of delivering nerve agents including by application to the doll handlers and the quote why didn't the Salisbury Investigation Team check the door handle of the mr. scribbles house in the first instance so they went to the car to the bench to some other places only probably in if in the fourth week they decided to investigate the case would be with their dog handler if they knew that the Russia allegedly making this kind of research how could British intelligence possibly learned that the GRU this is the military intelligence in Russia cyber specialist targeted Yulia scrapers emails accounts in 2013 so it's five years ago does this mean that they have been monitoring her communications in Moscow ever since her father moved to the UK that's a good question the British government claims that Russia hasn't responded to its original request but the situation is totally different on march 13th we send a neutral body which said that the I'm quoting the Russian Federation wasn't involved in any way in the incident took place in Salisbury on the 4th of March on the other hand the UK is refusing to address our concerns regarding the incident and to reply the numerous very specific questions that we have asked and I want to say that in the report which I just mentioned you can find most of the questions and more and more questions are coming it's around now it's around 50 it's a very practical very pragmatic questions which we cannot get the answers the foreign communists oath office is continuously ignoring our legitimate requests and questions concerning the condition of mr. and mrs. scruple nobody saw them nobody talked to them if you let us that were written on behalf of the mrs. scruple was done an absolutely great Oxford English definitely you know she couldn't write this like that so what we have today these people for us they are it's very difficult to reach them and by the way the sister the cousin in Moscow she tries to get the British visa to come to London and the first time she was refused today I don't know what is the condition you know what is the status of issuing of that visa but still you know as I understand the British authorities are you know declined any possibility of her to come to the UK we get the impression that the British government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence clarifying all remember remaining materials and making an independent and transparent investigation impossible the so called decontamination which includes and just floating in Senate rating of potentially contaminating objects in the quote is an element of strategy aiming to destroy the important and valuable evidence similar approach has already been used in the case of putting down the mr. scruples pet animals now let me come back to the OPCW meeting that just took place two days ago I am NOT going to repeat everything what was said there what we discussed so you will find the few papers and you can read them you know quite thoroughly you know what are the arguments what are the questions you know what is the history there are a lot of interesting things but I want just to try to draw your attention to a few things that from my point of view are very important because they're dealing with the with a visit of the OPCW experts to the UK so what we discovered is the OPCW experts work in the UK not in accordance with the CWC standard procedures but in bilateral format with UK which is which lack transparency the work of the OPCW experts was conducted under the control of the British side pressure on them cannot be ruled out they checked only the sides designated by the UK beforehand they were looking only for the substance identified by the UK so the format chosen could not guarantee impartiality and the comprehensive nature of the verification the information is in the full version of the OPCW report is insufficient for making any final conclusions moreover according to our experts the report of is full of inconsistencies the report of course is confidential we are not here the professionals in the chemical chemical experts so I wouldn't go into the technical details but for your understanding of the situation I would like to point out some general questions and observations of the Russian experts the fact that the identified toxic substance discovered was a high purity might mean that it was synthesized was or synthesized in the laboratory and not an industrial plant it's very important this is in line with a well known fact that it can be made and research in any modern chemical laboratory and we know what kind of lab there is only 10 miles from the Salisbury it's impossible to identify the chemical so quickly only if it's sample was made available or had been synthesized beforehand this might mean that the UK could have handed over its own sample of the substance for comparison same samples contain the pure toxic chemical without any sign of decomposition this is strange given that more than 18 days have passed between the poisoning and the arrival of the OPCW team to the UK it might mean that the chemical was intentionally injected just before the blood samples were taken these are just a few examples read the papers the most important point is that the report contains very little detail Russia will not take at face value any conclusions until our experts will be provided with the access to the victims we don't have any access as well to the old materials of the OPCW expert analysis and the entire volume of the real information regarding this incident the UK has its own it's on its disposal yesterday we'll send a request to the British side to allow medical examination of the Yulia scruple to be conducted by Russian specialists so far we don't have any answer considering all the facts now we have more reasons to qualify the situation as an abduction of the two Russian nationals it's modern the months passed more questions arise as to the possible involve of the British Secret Service's we will continue to seek truth demand answers from the British side photography was co-pastor sir another case let's turn to another case namely the murder of mr. Gustave which happened more than a month ago on the 12th of March nothing has changed since our last meeting on the 6th of April foreign office invited us to content to contact me through peloton police directly on the 9th of April I sent a letter to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner mrs. dick with a request for a meeting in order to discuss the case in detail today 2004 April no reply have been received make your own conclusions the embassy is not satisfied with a current level of interaction and he is not the British citizen he is a Russian citizen we are not satisfied with the current level of interaction with authorities the current situation is a clear violation of international law in defiance of the legitimate right of the Russian authorities to receive information about the Russian citizens so we have no idea what kind of investigation is going on what's happening in this case - now let me come to the last point of my remarks this is the question of the cybersecurity the British government has been constantly blaming Russia for various kinds of cyber attacks in the West without presenting any evidence to support these claims the only reference that we have this is the references to the intelligence sources in February the United States the United Kingdom blamed the Russian government for non PT a cyber cyber attacks of June 2017 more recently that was on the 11th of April Home Secretary rod claimed that and I'm quoting over the past six months the National Cyber Security Center has reported 249 incidents associated with Russian cyber groups which allegedly targeted energy telecom in media in connection with the poisoning in Salisbury we have written witnessed an unprecedented campaign in the UK calling upon the government to use its own offensive cyber capabilities against Russia it's a very serious statement in recent days there have been numerous calls in the British media to prepare for an inevitable cyber attack from Russia we're disappointed by the fact that such serious claims have been made publicly without any proof being presented and without any attempt by the United Kingdom to clarify the situation with the Russian side in the first place it's reckless provocative and unfounded policy in December 2017 when the secretary Johnson was in Moscow he met Sergey Lavrov in one of the issues they discussed was the situation around the cybersecurity and the alleged problems that the Britain has with the Russian cyberattacks and Lavrov said that mr. secretary let's make the good consultations between the specialists let's well let's you present the the evidence you know give some kind of information and we'll discuss this because because we don't want the British people to be misled on this very specific issue unfortunately our proposals were ignored so we made a conclusion that the British authorities are not interested in any dialogue they're interested just publishing the leaks claiming that the Russia is doing something here in this country something wrong and from my point of view it's unacceptable Prime Minister to resume didn't reject the possibility of a deployment of UK's offensive cyber capabilities I'm quoting against Russia during her statement in the House of Commons on the 14th of March the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also failed to deny that in official correspondence despite our direct requests so impression grows that the British public is being prepared for a massive cyber attack by the UK against against Russia which will be presented as a response but will in fact constitute and provoke unprovoked use of force so this is our impression and we hope and we're still waiting the answers official waiting officially awaiting the answers from the British side I think this this question is very serious and I think this is the matter of the national security and we hope that the British government will be responsive to our questions so I finished and I'll be happy to answer your questions we'll start from the first row and then we'll go please no no just just just just the microphone well on the first issue what we need we need the clear answers to all our questions there are a technical one very practical one and we still don't have the answers to these questions and of course we are going to demand to continue to demand the answers to these questions and as far as the World Cup the preparations are going on as I understand that all the tickets are sold out and 11 cities are ready for the World Cup and of course we welcome all the people who are coming and the rod of people who are coming from Britain so everything is ready everything in the fine condition and I hope that it will go well as far as the North Korean issue I don't know about anything about the you know the the meetings about on the high level but what I want to say is that the Russian proposals which were which were put to the Security Council table is still there so so basically they I mean not just the Russian but Russian Chinese proposal it was very simple first the the North Korea should stop any testing and the West headed by the United States to stop any mutual maneuvers any you know aggressive statements and this will be the basis for the launching of the conversation between the United States and the North Korea so basically my reading of the situation is we're still at that and from my point of view this proposal of two countries very serious players in the world international arena are this proposal this proposal is very important penalty ad is suggested that someone the British deliberately injected knowledge into the scribbles in advance of obviously W taking blood samples in order to inform the results are you saying you believe that that happened what we just kind of we're seeing this in absence of any explanations and I'll tell you what is I'll tell you about the logic which is behind that because two samples were taken from Sergei scruple and from Yulia scruple but the samples which were taking you know from blood test from the UDS profile the Wendy got the results these toxic substance so-called a two three four under the British classification was in the condition that it was just injected because you know if this substance stayed for almost a month it always you know works with the other parts of the body and of course the composition of that let's say chemical substance will be different and judged by the report that we got from the OPCW the substance was exactly at the condition that it was probably as to resin we use it highly likely was injected before the taking the blood test but in order to prove it we have to get the answers and the Britain is not going to cooperate with us so that's the problem but we are going to check all the let's say facts and all the theories all the let's say all the questions that were putting you know in front of the UK because you know the major problem for us they are refusing to cooperate with us in the OPCW and we don't have any direct contacts here in in UK so what we can do we can just read in the the papers the the materials that were presented by the OPCW Secretariat and make our own conclusions based on that information and our specialist discovered that there is some kind of a discrepancy between the what what we have today in the OPCW papers and the results in the at least official statements which were made here in the UK sorry the attendance 24 you said that's problem something's the situation hasn't changed so for example the access of embassy to the scribbler hasn't changed what seems to have radically changed is that been gone from an interpretation where this one's pre-attack all these ripples we cannot be choked I know you don't believe there was no joke that you saw that it might have been perpetrated by someone else now picking up on my colleagues question if you think that they were injected by you came to their senses when I do say that sir no I said that once we checked the results of the blood and we checked the substance so called never choke a two three four it was in the condition that it was just injected before the blood test we don't know who did it how it was done this is just the assumption based on the papers that we got for us it's very essential to understand and to talk to the British but they are refusing to talk just to make it clear with them not through the newspapers but but to clear directly in the direct conversation to ask them illustrate is one of intent of the British government both the intelligence services to falsify the OPCW examination to itself try to poison and those rumors that's a very serious accusation so that's my first question the second is if you yes triple makes a statement on camera well that any way towards if she were to say I'm not being held I have not been abducted I am choosing to not avail myself of either medical examination by Russia or to see the Russian embassy officials will there any way to once you'll be assured that she hasn't been abducted thirdly Sergei ripple is as far as I understand if a Russian citizen yes also now a British British haven't you - yeah yeah so on the last question but we can talk about the British citizens of serious crippling spot if you take Julia's profile he's not she's not the British citizen she is Russian and what we wanted this is the answer to your question you know what's the problem to meet her personally she left hospital she's alright that was official statement of the of the doctors what's the problem to talk to her we simply don't understand that you know maybe you understand that logic I don't understand is everything is alright with the person why not to talk to her if she would say that I'm not going to let's say continue the relations with the embassy or something like that it's alright but we want to see the answer and so that's the major problem and the first question about the special services what I wanted to say that absence of dialogue you know not presenting the evidences that brings us to the conclusion that something is wrong one month and a half we don't have any official information on the health and everything would happen you know with the two Russian citizens isn't surprising for you I mean just we simply in a normal state it will be very difficult you know just just to keep this situation like that that's why you know of course this brings us to the conclusions that this is a huge provocation against Russia because Russia was blamed almost the next day after the poisoning that it was done by Russia and as you rightly say this is a very serious statement yeah the second row because my Aditi a German press agency other question regarding to my elder today Russian government spokesperson as there s be evidence found in do mouth like grenades that have been produced in Britain and containers that contain chlorine and from Germany and a lot of Salisbury she said from salt or something from Salisbury and something from Germany I contain containers or remains it wasn't very specific I wanted to know do you have any more detail or evidence is there any images of anything I don't have I don't have the image you know on the screen of the of the container but if you go to the out Twitter you will find the picture of that container where is the the container lies on the bed no windows are broken nothing heard of the room and there is a gentleman in the mask and the container is just peacefully lying on the bed you will see this is this is a very famous picture and that brought us to the conclusion that somebody brought it and presented that this container was just hit the room which is wrong as far as the other things we are going to present the full information about the findings in Douma a picard etude you know predominate skq no I don't think how the figures with me but there were so many official information not affect news you know this this is from the Chinese let's say sources CC TW and so what they are finding they are finding a lot of chemical that's in components which were left by the jihadists and some of them were found in Eastern Goethe and there will be physical evidence that the chlorine was produced in Germany that was supplied from Germany because all the labels are there and certain thing I think this smoke devices were from Salisbury but this would be the official information will be presented by Russia today it was just stated by the by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so but this is in general how the the places which was left by the by the jihadists would be where they produce the chemical weapons and there are dozens of them all across the country so basically what they did they produced the chemical weapons you know with the chlorine with some others then they staged the so-called chemical attacks and with the help of the white helmets it was presented in a way that it was done by the Syrian government so today we have all the evidence and we are ready to present these evidence to I mean to the world community but it is well documented and this will be part of the big story and by the way it's not only the Russian TV it's also Chinese TV even American TV for example one American news network you know they made a few films which is now available you can find them it's it's available officially it's not fake it's something that they found themselves and they found by the way the last company I mean the American one they found this in Duma so basically it's part of the story and I hope that the experts from the OPCW will visit this place as the proof what we have today in the in the territory which was liberated by the Syrian army so first of all we have a lot of footage this is first I hope that this evidence will be presented to the OPCW to the experts and then I think the Syrian let's say government will think how to make it available for the broader public but the evidence are there everyone is your population so my question is do you know all these chemical weapons that is finding in the part of the city and countries now I don't know in what condition you know because what I see from the from the films and other specialists it's it's not something great one you know under the OPCW convention this is chlorine this is something that could be easily you know available on the market aren't quite sure that if they need they will ask and like we did together with the United States will help them but as I said it's not something like very serious the on the classification of the OPCW it's very it's very light story and chlorine it's it's it's not it's not so toxic for example as as the a 2 3 4 which was presented so I'm quite sure but it's up to the after the Syrian government well I put I put my answer the different way but I buy the youversion what I want to say that II of the British government had any information about the chemical weapons in Syria they had to report to the OPCW they didn't and when they strike Syria they said that there was a chemical weapons and they targeted three places okay most of these places were abandoned by the by the people and some of them were seriously damaged but there was no contamination once you hit something you contaminate the place but there was no contamination so that brings us to the conclusion first of all of course we were against this kind of strikes and as I explained at the beginning that was the clear-cut violation of the international law because for Britain it wasn't self-defense and there was no decision of the UN Security Council we worried and what we did we protected our let's say forces but most of the targets I think all the targets were on the Syrian side that's why Syrians retaliated and they shut down seven to one smart missiles let me take some water about the appurtenances of eternity there seems to be a bit of a long list of Russian nationals who come to this country and ended up dead they had some kind of history with Russia and so I wonder if and why an Isuzu facility said that the UK government is entitled life may have had something to do with injecting the springhouse versus substance why would they do that I didn't say that it was done by the UK government we know no we have suspicions because you know in order to understand what's going on we have to check but it's so difficult to checks when nobody's talking to you so this question will stay like that based on the on the papers that we got from the OPCW as far as the strange deaths in this country for us it's a really good question but the problem that we have with this country is that older all the cases with the deaths of the Russian citizens are still classified we don't have any access to the to the investigation of the Litvinenko just despite the fact that was public so-called public case we don't know what happened with the Boris Berezovsky who died in the strange circumstances everything is classified and now blush cough he is a Russian citizen I'm asking more than a month to give me something you know some kind of way even in meeting and what I can do in this situation so basically all the cases are very suspicious for us and before making the judgment we want get the full information I hope that we'll get this information not in a hundred years but a little bit earlier and I call on the British government for more transparency because this is the Russian citizens and we want to know the truth why they are hiding this I simply don't it I don't have an answer to this question maybe there are some reasons maybe you will need to give okay we'll go to the petrol thank you you keep telling us that you're being prevented from genius but she put two statements out saying she doesn't want to see you first of all this is the rules of the international law because the consular convention stipulates that in order to understand the real wish the real will of the person you have to talk personally this is this is just the international law and declining our request is just the violation of the international law what do you want we want to see her that she's in the good shape in a good health and she will tell us personally that we don't need I don't need your services and that's it all the statements were made before it was made on behalf of Yulia screw pilot so basically we cannot accept this I'm quite sure that if something goes wrong with any thanks God not with the British somewhere in the world I'm quite sure that the Embassy of your country will ask for the meaning with that specific person it's just ABC of the world behavior I mean international scene I don't think so why why she doesn't talk to the why she's not allowed to talk to her sister to her cousin so you're talking about behalf of her I want to talk personally sorry about that very simple we're old-fashioned please you always say that you want me don't you see w involved and it wasn't our multi emphasizes so when you agree with this relation when you disagree with them right it's just narrative no and I'll tell you why we we want to cooperate in two areas with the OPCW the first one is to get access to all the papers all the findings they got here in the UK so it's our right no no no no no it's the rules of the OPCW but since but the British are not allowing us to get access because they acted under the chapter eight so they asked the assistant assistance of the Secretariat so but what we want we want to get the all the papers all the originals it's a long story but it's it's quite a fair to get access to all the papers all the results it's normal because we're charge would be very serious things and we want to know that this is first and this is our citizens this is first on a second issue what we did it's I think that was done seven days ago we launched the mechanisms or mechanism of the OPCW under the chapter nine paragraph two and we put a lot of questions to the British side to give the answer to us this is a little bit different that includes the assistance of the OPCW but the idea is to establish the dialogue with the UK which they are refusing to have so from that point of view my personal view is that the earth she is very helpful it's very helpful not of not just for us but also for the world community the members of the OPCW in a second we need transparency the only thing we need is just to read the the initial reports on the basis of which the the let's say the the final report was made it's very simple why the British side is not ready to give their consent to give us this initial in Tokyo to give us the initial information we simply don't understand I think they would be happy to you know just just to hear our points of view on that and what and we will be happy to get the comments from them but it's not the fact today that's why we are calling the British side on the OPCW to be a little bit more cooperative and of course in the best spirit transparent so this is the whole idea president from right now he's short facilities in states because of their positions of involving Russia and clearly health people have kept an iPad for having the nation's wind initiative just start once again because you know it's not my mother tongue you know I understand clearly your question yeah listen right now in receiving I'll be more than generation health and people have to win in the election obviously years ago so for the accident world and country that ever evolving is completely Syria it's very strange that they're piling on the profits even certain will stop 30 reach the targets still you play there were no casualties from Syria the way if you the way if you have just two very quick questions well do you freaking tear that the Americans didn't advise you in advance is the 15 times they were trying to reach and second would you are you aware that to the anklebone would be like that extreme Islam you feel from say we don't have any more in two directions it's just a really conspiracy theory as I said the last conference you know we were the conversations you know between Russian military and the American military I don't know all these details but what's the sense to give the targets you know before the strikes it's it's quite clear I'm not going to speculate on that because you have to ask the US on that issue and maybe you can ask the Syrians not us but as far as the meddling to the American elections it was very interesting that we were not presented is single effect a single evidence of our meddling to the US elections and still there are no effects and after all the investigations after all the hearings that took place even in the in American Parliament you know we don't have any evidence it it means what it means that that was the part of the political story and nothing else Russia has nothing to do with that because you know the for us the evidence this is the most important part as exactly you know exactly how the story about the brexit was presented here in this country this country was divided you know approximately half and half and somehow the embassy was blamed that we interfered on the side of those who were for the brexit and what was the motivation to make a mess in this country we don't buy it I'm sorry it's not you know we we can just watch what's going on here but we are not intervening in any procedures that are that the British you know having by themselves I know no just will go further and then go there and then I'll come back to you party party okay the UK government is backing off the so called in each task force of the cross party politicians to counter the so-called Russian threat and had a bit I think leaned into me this morning with the today program said that it will target those who support the thought to quote him Putin's bankster regime it is Moscow planning to respond to that and what do you make of it well first of all gangster is not our word we don't have this in Russian as far as the cross body group this is internal let's say internal we shall be of the British Parliament what I can promise you I am ready to come to this group and to answer all their questions and I hope maybe I'll convince them to develop economic political relations and they can use the influence on the British government to perform a little bit better let's put this way please ladies and Press Association that your Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Russia has enough evidence to prove the UK's involvement in the staging of the just attack any Duma that voting stop groups and interests Francis a will you be sharing that with the public well basically you have seen you know the staging of one attack which was no no they are supporting the white helmets so they are giving money to them and the white helmets are operating on the territory of the jihadists you see the link so every time when the so-called chemical attack was staged it was in the territory which was controlled by the by the jihadis and they feel in this territory like a fish in the water but our problem with the white helmets not just a local one we know that for sure and it was stated several times in this country in London they get money from the government and my question you know what is what kind of support they are getting from the government that's that's why this is how we put this question please the team requested and received please for some attention by British authorities for deliverance so this is away the laboratory semester and the unites Pharisees the team was briefed on the identity of the toxic chemicals identified by the United Kingdom and the game sample collected by the British authorities from the affected individuals how do you understand is Melinda it obviously ability to do actually countries direct access to these people so the samples from the British authorities well then as I told you the the British authorities how we understand based on the papers which were released and the OPCW instructed the OPCW experts what to take and where to go they did it in accordance with the article 8 because the British side requested the assistance in that according to this article it means that they invited them to support their findings nothing else so the expert didn't operate and we're not looking for something else the task for them was to support the findings and that's exactly what they did but they didn't check other places they didn't do anything with other procedures of the OPCW because they were invited only under the article 8 so that was some kind of a national assistance but what we are saying that in OPCW there are some other procedures which are very important and the OPCW should work on the basis of death procedures that's why we launched another article 9 paragraph 2 where you can get a little bit broader information than here in the UK so that's the idea this is my front I got the reply from the Foreign Office and based on this replied I made the conclusion that the foreign secretary is not ready to discuss bilateral relations as we put it and he is not ready to discuss the not to discuss but to give the answers to the question so we put in front of the British side so basically he is not ready for the meeting because he is not ready to discuss the questions that we asked and a product from Japanese internment and what with the tradition of Russia in terms of the instant insulted through physical in this conference is gendered Russia we neighborhood youth know each other and reproduction of each other could you could you repeat once again because you know there was some kind of general industry conference yes your report you we never killed no joke yes and Russian news media and I was happy you know each other and the Palestinian activists destroyed for clothes and situation that US is under over behind as you can see it on their situation and they were in court for which the Russian in fact the existence of program in the solution in the Soviet Union to do that no joke and he himself participated in the program so I I want to ask you to make clear the official position about the progression or the difference of our project the Soviet Union working Porsche I want to stay officially that we never developed we never produced never joke in Russia we stopped all the chemical programs in 1992 and in September 2017 we destroy destroyed all the stockpiles of the chemical weapons this is first second of course we read different statements made by the museum for example from the United States and what we discovered that Nova Chowk was developed in the US and we prepared specially for you the fact sheet information about all the publications which were made with the so called Nova jock family in the United States certain things were even patented in the United States so basically the whole idea of the unit Nova chok came first from the scientific literature and certain things were patented at the entrance you'll find the two-page story complete story about the Nova choke in the United States I think your curiosity will be satisfied please my name is c-double-a tournament a big radio in the British government asked 24 23 members of the Russian embassy to leave the country have you been announced to replace them no we are not we were not allowed the British government is not giving the Russian diplomats visas but but before that happened the average time waiting time to get the British visa for the Russian diplomat is one year in certain cases it was a year and a half in certain cases there was even one case two years for the time being they are not ready to discuss this question as I said the the personnel was cut down by 40% that's why we have delays you know in a issuing of the visas to the British citizens we are planning to replace the people but we don't see any well the maximum the maximum length is 10 days so we expect the answers received on the 23rd of April seven-day past three more days today's 20th whoo-hoo I'm coming sorry about that I'm trying to stand aside you showed us this video here's the chlorine rebels evidence the White House page each and the also shows video of a young boy no no we were just paid to pretend that was an attack as you can see the contradiction there are you saying there was why you're accusing white answered because they stitched because our feeling they staged the usage of the chemical weapon and they used this boy which I showed to you as the somebody that is playing the this role in later role later on you have seen him on the good health so basically what I want to say is that when the Russian military came to Duma they inspected the place and they didn't find any any evidence of the using of the chemical weapons or anything so we were sure that our conclusions are right we said this publicly then when we heard the statements here in the UK that there was a strike with the help of the chemical weapons we said no we don't have this kind of proofs despite of that the UK US and France strike against Syria and today what we want so we call the OPCW Secretariat to come and visit the place and to make independent report so there is no contradiction and what I just wanted to show you this is how it was staged it's not the purpose you know to you know for me to just show you the movies I just wanted you know just to touch the reality in this place this is how we feel how we convinced and we need the results students were having structured students to come back to Russia for those who were studying in the West and maybe particular well I'll tell you that I read this reports I try to verify them but from my point of view that was sort of somebody's personal point of view which was presented by the media I didn't see any policy any signs of that policy in the UK as well as in the other countries that's it the last one the last one the last one no no that that one decision that evidence exists in triplicate Pendleton Syria okay and they refined it all the way the country retaliated against Russia are doing so for political reason rather than a as a saturation and if it is so what do you think we came to this low point in west relationship and treaty without or well first of all i think that other countries took their decision to associate themselves with the position of britain is based on the lack of evidence my conversations would be most of the western ambassador's shows that not so many things were presented to them and there were only reference to the intelligence sources they showed just the Western solidarity and that's why mister said well wrote even a letter to Secretary General of NATO explaining the British position and in that letter there were just not well-known facts and it means what it means that even it means that in NATO they didn't even gave that fact before why since he is writing a letter with something which is well known so that's why I think nobody knew and still nobody has any idea was behind this tragedy in Salisbury and I think that first of all this is the job of the media to ask the question by the way why don't all of you asked to make an interview of screep odd you're smiling haha why not to come to this place and ask the British come to arrange the meeting you know put scrip are the father was a daughter you know talk to her ask what's going on this is first second I think that it's very important that the British public the society should put more questions to their government at least ask them to present something which is not the leaks and not the stories in the newspapers we need transparency and I'll say that the Britain has such a good traditions of the press and the good traditions of finding the facts I think this government should demonstrate that and will help them thank you very much thank you oh the last one oh my god different rotation for their bite the credit for watch is appointed just what am I to do especially send my crew the team was able to conduct on-site somebody in the fire control samples under the chain of custody outside identified so you know this sorry sir how can you be so sure that because we have a report from the OPCW there is a public part which is available for all of you and there is a less a confidential part which was given to the all the members of the Executive Council what I wanted to say is that the mission was invited by the British side for cooperation and they offered only the places they were allowed to visit there was no separate mission from the OPCW that was the mission to support the findings of the UK so it's there is no contradiction I'm not saying that something goes wrong but the way how the article 8 works this is the way how the mission should be taken you see didn't get it a good the last one the last I don't want to be to stand between you and lunch opcw no it's just the mission under the invitation of the oldest Syrian government this is this is I don't remember the which chapter but this is there are specific procedures and they will check everything not just the places where where they were set to visit but they will check all the place and make their own conclusions so this is the benefit of that mission definitely is not the chapter 8 thank you thank you very much thank you have a good weekend Wow
