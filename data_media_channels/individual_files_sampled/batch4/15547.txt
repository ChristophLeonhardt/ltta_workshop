oh ho ho and Merry Christmas we're gonna gloat a little bit about how wrong liberals and never Trump words were in 2016 as opposed to Donald Trump's actual 2017 job performance now this one's gonna be fun because liberals and never Trump errs are always wrong they can't get anything right they could look at their watch and get the time wrong there is one thing Donald Trump was wrong about there is one thing that I vehement levy mately disagree with President Donald Trump about it's something he said during the campaign and he said it repeatedly that we were gonna get tired of winning he'll never get tired of winning I love winning I can get comfortable with winning I can get used to winning but I'm never gonna get tired of winning but let's look back at 2016 the predictions made by liberals liberals and never Trump errs and what 2017 actually brought us 2016 Trump hates the Jews Trump is anti-semitic my god Trump is gonna bring in neo-nazis and it's gonna be the second coming of Hitler's Third Reich 2017 Runk just recognized Jerusalem is the capital of Israel oh my god Trump is a Zionist puppet he's owned by Netanyahu Trump does everything for the Jewish community he couldn't care less about the rest of it 2016 Donald Trump would bankrupt four times corporate bankruptcy 700 he knows nothing about the economy Donald Trump is gonna be an economic disaster I was 2016-2017 margin for percent economic growth GDP growth the Dow soared over 25,000 I'll probably hit 30,000 reaping tax reform massive tax cuts or trillion dollars four trillion dollars repatriated into the US economy you would think the never Trump furs would crawl under a rock somewhere as they would their liberal buddies like Kevin McMullan and John McCain and all of the fry knows make Republican 2016 Donald Trump is a New York City liberal he's gonna stack the bench with liberal judges oh my god the country is going off a big government cliff Donald Trump's judges are gonna mirror New York City values 2017 yo gorsek that's dust on Willy more hard right conservative judicial appointments to federal bench seats and any of his predecessors never tremors kept on going our stature in the world is 2016 oh my god Barack Obama was amazing our stature in the world under Obama was we were just so respected so well received every zealot in the world treated Obama like a child they had no respect that was the party line and they never Trump her globalist Donald Trump that's America first is make America great again he's going to destroy everything he doesn't know he's doing 2017 free UCLA players shoplift in China like knuckleheads Ritter served 10 years in prison Trump picks up the phone they're on a plane home Barack Obama was forced to come down the service entrance of Air Force One Trump landed in China there were marching bands and red carpets no no no our standing in the world is back from Obama's weak policies of appeasement Barack Obama was the kid Neville Chamberlain bullied Barack Obama had no guts and every bad guy in the world saw it Putin saw it kind of saw it they all saw most significantly North Korea and Iran saw it and they ran roughshod over Obama Obama was a disaster on the foreign policy front 2017 Donald Trump goes out there and he owns his global tour like I said red carpets and marching bands North Korea is in check we've got aircraft carriers off their coast and stealth bombers flying overhead and and let me tell you something him knows it he's not getting out of hand China and Russia are figuring how to help us Russia's helping in Syria we've got the world bad guys in check we've got Cuban check we've got North Korea and check we've got Iran in check and it's only gonna get better for the United States it's only gonna get stronger 2016 Donald Trump knows nothing about how to combat her Donald Trump saying radical Islam is gonna make the terrorists hate us more oh my God we're all gonna die a fiery death when the terrorists released a smart bomb in the middle of Times Square 2017 Isis is all but crushed it on the run al Qaeda is being decimated our southern border has never been more secure and IRA mention our southern border on this one because we know that about 350,000 illegals from 34 nation of turrican 34 nations of terror concern I've come across the southern border but in 2017 Donald Trump did in less than a year with Barack Obama couldn't do in half a decade and that was crush Isis and take Raqqa their capital away from them another failed prediction by the Liberals in the nevertrump er now we've got some work to do we've got to build that wall we've got to build that wall but we're making progress because in 2016 when they said Donald Trump is all about his feet he's not gonna seal the border in 2017 we had the head of ice immigrations and Customs Enforcement recently come out on the record and say that Donald Trump is the best president he's ever worked under on border security this a guy who goes back to the Reagan administration Tom Holman even went as far to say that in June of 2016 Barack Obama tied their hands he said that a hearing the Obama administration wouldn't allow them to enforce immigration policy Holman said that it wasn't that there was no one to deport it was just that the Obama administration wouldn't let them do it and Donald Trump has taken the gloves off and he lets agents be agents and cops be cops and they get the bad guys out of our country the Donald Trump has answered all of our questions he's eased all of our fears he's turned out to be a really conservative president and he's doing things he's actually getting the job done and keeping campaign promises the only questions that remain are or is what will Donald Trump do in 2018 well keep
