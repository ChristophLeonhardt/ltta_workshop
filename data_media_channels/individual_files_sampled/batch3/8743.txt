#MeToo MOVEMENT. AND HILLARY AND THE DEMOCRATIC HATERS. THAT'S THE FOCUS ON TONIGHT'S AND GOLD. TODAY'S JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARD HIS FIRST ORAL ARGUMENTS AT THE SUPREME COURT AND WAS WELCOMED WARMLY BY HIS COLLEAGUES. IN TONIGHT'S MOMENTS OF COLLEGIALITY WITH YESTERDAYS CHAOS AND PROMISE FOR MORE. REPUBLICANS ARE EXUDING MORE CONFIDENCE WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE BANKING ON MORE CHAOS. DESPITE THE BRIGHTEST CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF THE SWING VOTE ON THE HIGH COURT, THEY ARE HITTING THE ENTER KEY ACCELERATOR. THESE PEOPLE TRULY BELIEVE THEY CAN PROTEST THEIR WAY BACK INTO POWER. SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WARNED OF TONIGHT. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME TOO EXTREME. AND THEY'VE BECOME FRANKLY TOO DANGEROUS TO GOVERN. THEY HAVE GONE WHACKO. IF DEMOCRATS TAKE CONTROL, THEY WILL TRY TO REVERSE OUR AMAZING PROGRESS AND PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY INTO GRIDLOCK, FRANKLY INTO POVERTY, ULTIMATELY INTO CHAOS. Laura: THE CHAOS TRAIN HAS NOW EVEN INFECTED WHAT WAS ONCE THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT. WHY HASN'T DIANNE FEINSTEIN, WHO WAS CONSIDERED A SOBER MINDED LIBERAL, WHY HASN'T SHE CONDEMNED THE TACTICS AND INTIMIDATION USED BY HER FEMALE COLLEAGUES IN THE HALLS OF THE U.S. SENATE? DO YOU KNOW LIKE? BECAUSE PRO-WOMAN DIANNE FEINSTEIN WANTS TO KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE RED-HOT, SCARILY SO TO DRIVE DEMOCRATIC VOTER TURNOUT. BUT JUST WHEN YOU THINK THEY COULDN'T GO LOWER? THEY DO. TRUMP HAS DELIVERED FOR THESE PEOPLE ON THE THINGS THEY CARE ABOUT MOST. HE HAS DELIVERED RACISM FOR THESE PEOPLE. HE HAS DELIVERED MY SAW THE NEED FOR THESE PEOPLE. HE HAS DELIVERED THE SUPREME COURT FOR THESE PEOPLE WHICH IS SOMETHING THEY CONSIDERED FOR A GENERATION. THEY HAVE CONTROL OF ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. WE WILL SEE THIS EITHER FOR 30 DAYS, OR TWO DAYS, OR A THOUSAND YEAR REICH. Laura: REICH? NICE. IF YOU AREN'T ON FOR THE MORAL DICTATES OF LIBERALISM, THE LEFT WILL DEMONIZE YOU AS A NAZI, PLANT FALSE STORIES AGAINST YOU, TRY TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE. OF COURSE, THEY'LL TRY TO GET YOU FIRED. WHEN YOU ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP OR JUST A KAVANAUGH I LOVE SAYING THAT. IF THEY CAN'T BEAT YOU, THEY'LL THREATEN TO IMPEACH YOU. HERE'S THE ORIGINAL FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CLINTON WARM WAR ROOM JAMES CARVILLE. THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. THEY AREN'T GOING TO STOP DOING STORIES ON KAVANAUGH. THE DEMOCRATS WIN BACK THE HOUSE, THEY'LL PROBABLY HOLD SOME KIND OF HEARINGS ON THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK HE PERJURED HIMSELF DURING HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. Laura: DEAD OR ALIVE? I LIKE HIM BETTER, BY THE WAY, WHEN HE PUT THE GARBAGE PAIL OVER HIS HEAD BACK IN 2002. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT AFTER THE LOSS IN 2002? THAT WAS CARVILLE'S BEST MOVEMENT MOMENT. HOW IS ANY OF THIS GOING TO MAKE AMERICA'S LIVES BETTER? WHAT IS THE NEW PLATFORM? WE'LL SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND WILL TORTURE ANYONE WHO'S REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH TRUMP? PLEASE. THE THUGGISH WIN AT ALL APPROACH WAS ON FULL DISPLAY DURING THE KAVANAUGH BATTLE. DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT ME! I WAVE MY HAND AT YOU! HOW DARE YOU TALK TO WOMEN THAT WAY! WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS! WE BELIEVE SURVIVORS! Laura: IT'S FITTING, ISN'T IT, THE WOMEN ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF THE POLITICS OF DESTRUCTION, ALONG WITH CARVILLE, HAS NO PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THAT. YOU CANNOT BE CIVIL WITH A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WANTS TO DESTROY WHAT YOU STAND FOR, WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IF WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE AND/OR THE SENATE, THAT'S WHEN CIVILITY CAN START AGAIN. UNTIL THEN, THE ONLY THING THE REPUBLICANS SEEM TO RECOGNIZE, AND RESPECT, AND STRENGTH. Laura: THIS IS SO JUVENILE. IT'S LIKE YOUR KID, RIGHT "I'LL START BEHAVING, MOMMY, ONCE I GET THE EXTRA PIECE OF CANDY." OKAY! UNLESS THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN POWER, THERE CAN BE NO CIVILITY. YET THEY ARE THE AGENTS OF MAYHEM THAT WE'VE ENDURED FOR TWO YEARS NOW. THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING SINCE ELECTION NIGHT! HILLARY WOULD RATHER SEE THE COUNTRY SWALLOWED UP BY DISCORD AND ANGER THEN TO ADMIT THE TRUMP POLICIES ARE ACTUALLY BEARING FRUIT. MY FRIENDS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT FOISTING A LIBERAL CONSTRUCT ON AMERICA. NO TONALITY, THE SET OF PRECEPTS, BASICALLY, ABOUT OPEN BORDERS, OPEN MARKETS, MAY BE TOSSING IN GENDER VALIDITY FOR GOOD MEASURE. ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE ACCEPTED OR ELSE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SOFTER, KINDER HILLARY WE HEARD FROM JUST TWO YEARS AGO. WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT FINDING WAYS TO DISAGREE ON MATTERS OF POLICY WHILE AGREEING ON QUESTIONS OF DECENCY AND CIVILITY. HOW WE TALK TO EACH OTHER, TREAT EACH OTHER, RESPECT EACH OTHER. Laura: ISN'T THAT NICE AT THE AL SMITH DINNER? THAT'S SO NICE. UNLESS OUR CAMPAIGN GOES DOWN IN FLAMES, IN OTHER WORDS, AND UNLESS OUR OPPONENTS FULFILL HIS PROMISES, IN WHICH CASE WE WILL SCORCH THE EARTH, CIVILITY BE DAMNED. HILLARY COULD NOT LET THE MOMENT TO PASS FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH TO HAVE HIS CEREMONIAL SWEARING IN THAT THE WHITE HOUSE LAST NIGHT. WHAT WAS DONE LAST NIGHT IN THE WHITE HOUSE WAS A POLITICAL RALLY. IT FURTHER UNDERMINED THE IMAGE AND INTEGRITY OF THE COURT. AND THAT TROUBLES ME GREATLY. SADDENS ME BECAUSE OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN VIEWED AS ONE OF THE MAIN PILLARS OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT. Laura: AND IN WHAT WAY WAS THIS A POLITICAL RALLY? I WAS ACTUALLY THERE LAST NIGHT. OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE EXCITED. JUST LIKE WHEN DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT GETS TWO JUSTICES OR ONE JUSTICE? THEY ARE EXCITED. IT'S A VICTORY. YOU CAN'T CELEBRATE VICTORIES, ONLY FOUR DEMOCRATS? ALL THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WERE SITTING IN THE FRONT ROW, INCLUDING THE ONE APPOINTED BY YOUR HUSBAND, HILLARY. IT WAS A NONPARTISAN MOMENT OF UNITY AND MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF HEALING THAT HILLARY REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE BECAUSE, OF COURSE, SHE HAD NO ROLE IN IT. THIS IS AT THE HEART OF THE DEMOCRATS' RESISTANCE. THEY ARE ACTUALLY RESENTFUL THAT THE COUNTRY IS MOVING AHEAD, GROWING, THRIVING, RECLAIMING ITS POWER. ALSO ON THE WORLD STAGE. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PART IN ANY OF IT. BECAUSE TRUMP WAS RIGHT, THEY WERE WRONG, AND THEY ARE TICKED OFF ABOUT IT. LIBERAL DOGMA AND THE GIVEAWAY POLICIES OF THE PAST, THAT DID NOT GET US HERE TO REACH ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND OTHERWISE. LACKING A GOVERNING AGENDA OR IN THE RESPONSE TO TRUMP'S ECONOMIC AND GLOBAL SUCCESS? THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DECIDED TO RUN ON A PLATFORM OF DEMONIZATION. THEY ARE NOW EVEN USING THE KAVANAUGH VOTE TO PUNISH THEIR OWN. DEMOCRAT SENATOR JOE MANCHIN OF WEST VIRGINIA, IN A CLOSE REELECTION RACE, AND CANDIDATE PHIL DRESDEN BEING LASHED BY THE LEFT FOR THE RESPECTIVE VOTE ON KAVANAUGH. THE LIBERAL MoveOn.org CLOSE ARE WITHHOLDING MONIES FROM BOTH CAMPAIGNS OF THE CANDIDATES. IF THEY WON'T TOLERATE A LITTLE BIT OF DIVERSITY AMONG OPINION AMONG THEIR OWN DEMOCRATIC
