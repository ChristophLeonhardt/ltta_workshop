1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,061
>> Shannon: GARRETT, THINK OF

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:03,628
HER MUCH.

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:04,329
PRO-LIFE GROUP GETS THEIR WAY

4
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:07,832
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WILL HAVE A

5
00:00:07,832 --> 00:00:09,634
WHOLE NEW FUNDING PROBLEM ON

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:10,602
THEIR HANDS.

7
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,669
PRESSURE TO A DIRECT FEDERAL

8
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:12,670
FUNDS AWAY FROM CLINICS THAT DO

9
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,039
ABORTIONS IN FAVOR OF QUALIFIED

10
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,706
HEALTH CLINICS THAT PROVIDE

11
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:17,976
MEDICAL CARE BUT DO NOT PERFORM

12
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:18,343
ABORTIONS.

13
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:22,213
LET'S DISCUSS WITH THE PANEL.

14
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:26,017
PENNY NANCE, DR. RONNIE FLOYD,

15
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:26,785
PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL DAY OF

16
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:27,819
PRAYER.

17
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,853
IT'S COMING UP TOMORROW.

18
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:32,256
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

19
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,225
THIS ISSUE THAT GARRETT TOUCHED

20
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:36,628
ON, THERE ARE A LOT WHO ARE

21
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,229
UNHAPPY THAT NOT ONLY DID

22
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:40,031
REPUBLICANS VOTE TO PASS THIS

23
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:42,267
BILL THAT STILL CONTAINS FUNDING

24
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:44,436
FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THE

25
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:45,437
PRESIDENT SIGNED IT.

26
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:46,337
IT CAME UP LAST NIGHT IN THE

27
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:50,175
WEST VIRGINIA DEBATE.

28
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,111
HERE'S WHAT THE INTERCHANGE WAS.

29
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:56,915
>> PLANNED PARENTHOOD A COUPLE

30
00:00:56,915 --> 00:01:00,552
WEEKS AGO, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED

31
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:02,854
OF YOURSELF FOR THE OUTRAGEOUS

32
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,556
VOTES, KILLING THE UNBORN.

33
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:05,824
>> Shannon: PENNY, I KNOW YOU

34
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,226
ARE HEARING AND EARFUL FROM A

35
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:09,160
BASE THAT'S NOT HAPPY.

36
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,662
>> ACTUALLY WHEN THE VOTE

37
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:11,763
HAPPENED, MY PHONE WAS BURNING

38
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:15,033
UP EVEN ON VACATION.

39
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,067
THIS IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE

40
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,135
PRESIDENT AND RECENT HISTORY,

41
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:18,436
NOT JUST THAT.

42
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,839
THIS IS THE MOST PRO-LIFE

43
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:21,506
WHITE HOUSE STAFF IN RECENT

44
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:23,074
HISTORY.

45
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,643
HE HAS DONE A LOT TOWARDS THAT

46
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:26,277
ISSUE, BUT WE'VE STILL GOT

47
00:01:26,277 --> 00:01:28,146
FARTHER TO GO ON THIS.

48
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:33,718
AT THIS POINT, THERE ARE STILL

49
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,353
WITHIN THE REGULATION CLINTON

50
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:36,020
ERA REGULATIONS THAT SAY IN

51
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,259
ORDER TO PRESENT PARTICIPATE, --

52
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,427
>> Shannon: TAXPAYER MONEY.

53
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:44,662
>> $206 MILLION YEAR FROM

54
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:48,099
TAXPAYER MONEY THAT GOES TO

55
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,834
4,000 HEALTH CLINICS, TITLE X

56
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,236
CLINICS.

57
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:51,936
ONLY 500 OF THOSE ARE PLANNED

58
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:54,672
PARENTHOOD CLINICS.

59
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,241
WHAT WE HAVE CITED LET'S GO BACK

60
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,276
TO THE REAGAN ERA REGULATION

61
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:01,246
THAT WAS AFFIRMED BY THE SUPREME

62
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:01,546
COURT.

63
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:04,682
IT'S LEGAL.

64
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,217
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ENTANGLE

65
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,051
TAXPAYER MONEY WITH ABORTION.

66
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:10,420
IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT THIS

67
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,290
MONEY, YOU CAN'T BE LOCATED,

68
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,027
COLOCATED IN AN ABORTION CLINIC.

69
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,663
AND YOU CAN'T REFER AN COUNCIL

70
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:19,230
FOR ABORTIONS.

71
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,232
STEWART PLANNED PARENTHOOD SAY

72
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:22,867
IT WOULD HAVE DEVASTATING

73
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:23,835
CONSEQUENCES AND DISMANTLE

74
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:25,036
THE NATION'S PROGRAM FOR

75
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:26,104
AFFORDABLE BIRTH CONTROL AND

76
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,172
RE-PRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WHICH

77
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,840
4 MILLION PEOPLE RELY ON.

78
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,275
THE POLICY IS DANGEROUS.

79
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,043
IT WOULD KEEP WOMEN FOR HAVING

80
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:32,777
INFORMATION FROM GETTING THE

81
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,146
BEST HEALTH CARE POSSIBLE.

82
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:38,283
>> THIS IS THE GROUP THAT HELD

83
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,318
UP AS HE CUT FUNDING FOR CARE

84
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:41,653
FOR PEOPLE IMPORT RICOH BECAUSE

85
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,288
THEY WANTED A PIECE OF THE

86
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,422
ACTION.

87
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,223
THIS IS THE ABORTION MAFIA.

88
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,492
THEY WANT ALL THE MONEY FOR

89
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,860
THEMSELVES.

90
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,094
THEY ARE ABORTION BUSINESS MODEL

91
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:51,729
HAS GROWN WHILE ABORTION HAS

92
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:52,463
GONE DOWN AND THE REST OF THE

93
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:52,797
COUNTRY.

94
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,832
THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT MORE FOR

95
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:55,166
THEM.

96
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,801
THIS REGULATION AND THE CHANGE

97
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,436
IN THE REGULATION WERE

98
00:02:58,436 --> 00:03:00,605
PROPOSING, IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR

99
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,574
MORE PEOPLE TO COMPETE.

100
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:04,842
FAITH-BASED GROUPS TO COMPETE

101
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:05,476
AND CARE FOR POOR WOMEN.

102
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,680
PLUS WE SAID SWITCH FUNDING TO

103
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,981
THE 13,000 COMMUNITY HEALTH

104
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,182
CENTERS THAT ACTUALLY DO CARE

105
00:03:11,182 --> 00:03:16,221
FOR PER     POOR WOMEN BUT DON'T

106
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:16,254
FOR PER     POOR WOMEN BUT DON'D

107
00:03:16,254 --> 00:03:16,621
FOR PER     POOR WOMEN BUT DON'O

108
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,222
ABORTIONS.

109
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,556
>> Shannon: YOU SAY AMERICA

110
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:19,424
NEEDS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS.

111
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,360
>> WE DO.

112
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,094
IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN

113
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,129
THE HEARTS OF ALL EVANGELICALS

114
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:28,633
AND CONSERVATIVES.

115
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:29,767
WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THIS

116
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:30,068
ISSUE.

117
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:34,839
IN FACT, TOMORROW IS THOUSANDS

118
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,807
AND THOUSANDS OF GATHERINGS FOR

119
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,609
THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER.

120
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,309
MANY OF THOSE GATHERINGS WILL

121
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:42,213
FOCUS IN ON MATTERS OF CONCERN

122
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:44,082
ABOUT THE CULTURE AND ABOUT

123
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:45,850
THINGS THAT ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING

124
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,452
TO THE SANCTITY AND DIGNITY OF

125
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,587
HUMAN LIFE AND TO PRAY FOR OUR

126
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:49,921
COUNTRY.

127
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:51,289
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

128
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,924
THOSE WHO WOULD SAY THIS IS NOT

129
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,260
A CONVERSATION WE SHOULD BE

130
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,593
HAVING.

131
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:56,327
THIS OF ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

132
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:59,264
NOT BE IMPOSING WHAT THEY THE AS

133
00:03:59,264 --> 00:03:59,998
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WHEN IT COMES

134
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,333
TO FEDERAL MONEY AND ACCESS TO

135
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:04,235
THINKING OF THE NATIONAL DAY OF

136
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:05,236
PRAYER TOMORROW, AMERICANS

137
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:07,238
UNITED FOR SEPARATION OF STATE,

138
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,640
CHURCH AND STATE SAY IT'S A

139
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,277
VEHICLE FOR SPREADING RELIGIOUS

140
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:13,278
MISS INFORMATION AND

141
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:15,046
FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIAN

142
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,847
DOCTRINE.

143
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:19,149
>> THE NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER

144
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,017
MOBILIZES, UNIFIED PUBLIC PRAYER

145
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,087
FOR AMERICA.

146
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,256
WE CAN CALL OUT TO GOD AND TALK

147
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:26,291
TO GOD ABOUT AMERICA.

148
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,826
ONE THING THAT WE HAVE BEEN

149
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,663
REALLY JUST REALLY CONVICTED OF

150
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,831
IS THAT PRAYER CROSSES ALL THE

151
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:34,465
AISLES.

152
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:36,834
I MEAN, PRAYER IS NOT ABOUT

153
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:37,201
POLITICS.

154
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:38,636
PRAYER IS THAT SOMETHING WE CAN

155
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:41,439
DO TOGETHER BECAUSE WE CAN GO TO

156
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,608
GOD ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE

157
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:44,075
ABOUT ANYTHING.

158
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,110
TOMORROW IS A DAY WHEN MILLIONS

159
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,880
OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO GO TO

160
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,381
GOD ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND PRAY

161
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:51,983
FOR OUR COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE.

162
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,451
>> Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING

163
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:57,255
ABOUT THE DAY IS ITS SPORADIC

164
00:04:57,255 --> 00:00:00,000
COSTS -- SPREAD ACROSS ANY
