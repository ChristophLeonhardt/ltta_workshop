1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
Well, if Antioch
College has its way,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,260
campus smooching will involve
so many questions and answers.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,160
You might want to bring
your lawyer along.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,700
These are the rules.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,540
I don’t think the sexual
offense policy was anti-sex.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,630
I loved sex then,
and I love sex now.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,940
I had a problem — 
and I still have a problem —

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,820
with people feeling
like they can’t

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,430
slow down enough
to figure out what

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,190
the other person
is really feeling.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,481
#MeToo.

12
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,160
MeToo.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,980
The person of the year
is the #MeToo movement.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,390
The same conflicts that
we had in our discussions

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,490
in the early 1990s at Antioch
College are happening now.

16
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,560
What is misconduct,
and what isn’t?

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,810
Is it the job of men
to now decide when

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,310
women are capable of consent?

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,620
We did this 25 years ago.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,580
It’s just crazy to me
that it’s still an issue.

21
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,300
As it reaches the bedroom, as it
reaches this male-female coming

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,450
together, women are saying what?

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,960
Women are saying, “Us too.”

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,760
I see consent as a human issue.

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,360
If, from the point
you meet somebody,

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,580
you’re not seeing them as
a person, that’s a problem.

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,020
The difference is
not necessarily

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,580
that we are where we want to be.

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,710
The difference is that people
are talking about it now.

30
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,660
That’s the difference.

31
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,150
Consent.

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,290
That’s a tough one, isn’t it?

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,910
Nonverbal, it’s very tricky.

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,250
I think you have to be verbal.

35
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,700
All of these questions that we
were talking about at Antioch

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,510
in our so-called bubble
have now become dinner table

37
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,775
conversation.

38
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,265
We’re going to talk to you all
about sexual health and S.O.P.P.

39
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,909
[cheering]

40
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,200
This is a vagina.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,942
And this is the butt.

42
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:57,445
This is actually simple.

43
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,300
If someone doesn’t want
to have sex with you,

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,994
don’t have sex with them.

45
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,790
[applause]

46
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,130
So in 1991, a group
of women at Antioch

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,570
began a campaign to promote a
culture free of sexual violence

48
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,140
at Antioch.

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,790
This was Antioch in the '90s.

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,950
Antioch has a history of
being a fairly radical place.

51
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,520
It was really pretty
wild, very small.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,830
When I came that
fall, I look out,

53
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,708
and there are two people dancing
around in the rain naked.

54
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,560
I’m like, where in the world did
my mother leave me that people

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,870
dance around in the rain naked?

56
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,550
The campus foments this
energy to make changes

57
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,780
to better our society.

58
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,500
And it always has had a
safe feeling about it.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,256
Antioch has this openness.

60
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:53,190
And I like that.

61
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,720
And then there was
finding out that two women

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,380
had been raped on the campus.

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,190
So we decided that we should
talk to other women on campus.

64
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,900
And so we called a meeting.

65
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,820
And I said, I’m going
to that meeting.

66
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,490
I need to get a napkin.

67
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,210
O.K.

68
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,380
There were so many women
in the room that night.

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,380
There weren’t enough
chairs for them.

70
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,480
We had hit a nerve.

71
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,870
At Antioch, we were
playing with empowerment.

72
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,960
We were pretending
we were empowered.

73
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,810
I know I was.

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,650
So when we discovered that
there was a rape on campus,

75
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,020
we played with saying
exactly what we wanted,

76
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,960
which was [bleep] that.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,290
We decided to draft
a list of demands.

78
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,120
We wanted people to understand
that breaking someone’s consent

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,190
in even the smallest of ways
was connected to the most

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,050
violent of assaults.

81
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,110
But it didn’t take long
for us to figure out

82
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,730
that we had to define consent.

83
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,420
How do you have sex
at Antioch College?

84
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,170
Very carefully.

85
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,490
You have to ask permission
before each and every action,

86
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,010
from smooching to 
you-know-what.

87
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,190
At the time, that was
considered outrageous

88
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,620
because it de-sexes
the whole thing.

89
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,690
Political correctness and
campus feminism run amok.

90
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,850
Sex is supposed to be mysterious
and a little dangerous.

91
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,155
So we’ve got radio
and TV spots —

92
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,220
The Sanford Florida Herald,
The Daily Times Call

93
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,340
in Longmont, Colorado.

94
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,310
This went viral before going
viral was even a thing.

95
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,350
Is how students get from
first base to second base

96
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,300
really any of Antioch
College’s business?

97
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,580
This idea of women as asexual,
things like the Antioch rules.

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,020
You now have to regulate
romance in the interest

99
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,190
of protecting women.

100
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,200
A lot of erectile difficulties.

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,291
We were the laughing stock.

102
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,960
I was standing in our bookstore
when someone from "S.N.L." called.

103
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,840
And they said, “Can we get
one of your football jerseys?”

104
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,690
And we laughed.

105
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,370
[laughs]

106
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,050
“We don’t have a football team.”

107
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,490
The joke was on us.

108
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,190
Live from Antioch
College in Antioch, Ohio,

109
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,390
it’s time to play
“Is It Date Rape?"

110
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,150
The idea that we were involved
in some anti-sex crusade

111
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,850
was so laughable.

112
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,330
May I kiss you on the mouth?

113
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,070
Yes.

114
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,370
I would like you to
kiss me on the mouth.

115
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,680
Antioch was a very
sex-positive culture.

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,040
...sexual intimacy by
feeling your buttocks?

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,420
Yes, you have my permission.

118
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:55,180
We wanted to have as much of a
sexual cornucopia as we wanted,

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,990
but we wanted to be
asked if we wanted it.

120
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,780
That’s it.

121
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,980
I was devastated.

122
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,730
Frustration, anger,
disappointment.

123
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,150
I was so embarrassed,
and I felt humiliated.

124
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,800
I ended up leaving school.

125
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,620
I quit.

126
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,140
I think that "S.N.L." talked
about S.O.P.P. in 1995,

127
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,500
which is when I was born.

128
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,550
‘93? Then I wasn’t born.

129
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,330
I wasn’t even a twinkle
in my mother’s eye

130
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,040
yet when they did that.

131
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,400
Going in to Antioch, I
had only heard about S.O.P.P.

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,910
through that skit.

133
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,580
All I could think of was
I’m going to the school that

134
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,540
got made fun of.

135
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,890
Can anybody think
of a time where

136
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,110
there was a movie that actually
showed affirmative consent?

137
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,479
Anybody see “Frozen"?

138
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,090
At the end of “Frozen,"
when that dude is like,

139
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,900
“Can I kiss you?”

140
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,660
May I?

141
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,160
We me?

142
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,390
I mean, may we?

143
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,794
Wait, what?

144
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:05,054
We may.

145
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:08,124
This is the first
time in a Disney movie

146
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:10,020
that somebody asked for consent.

147
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,916
[laughter]

148
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:17,330
“The S.O.P.P. is Antioch’s
formal attempt

149
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,930
at ending sexual
violence while fostering

150
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,640
a campus culture of positive
consensual sexuality.”

151
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,884
...give you all a little
bit more information.

152
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:39,300
It seems like it’s
such a big part

153
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,465
of the way of thinking now.

154
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,890
“Sex is like cooking."

155
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,006
"I want to cook for you."

156
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,780
"But if I cook for
you now, will you

157
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,832
expect me to cook for you later?"

158
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,172
"And if I do cook for
you later, will you

159
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,943
expect me to cook
for you all the time?”

160
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,875
“I want to cook for you.

161
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,773
But what if you think
my cooking sucks?”

162
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,374
“I want to cook for you,
but can we talk about it

163
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,680
before I start cooking?”

164
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,180
[applause]

165
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,510
I feel like it’s good that
this was here to give people

166
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,390
permission to talk about this.

167
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,350
In high school, relationships,
it’s like a game.

168
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,810
You have to swoon a
girl and make her —

169
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,720
you have to — it feels like
there’s a lot of gray area

170
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,850
when it comes to
one’s first experience

171
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,090
with sexual intimacy.

172
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,669
But with this,
it’s so much easier

173
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,246
to become intimate
with someone if you

174
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:37,870
know exactly where
they’re at and where

175
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,510
you’re at yourself
using verbal consent.

176
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,693
It’s just more of
a worldwide thing

177
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:44,110
that we can talk
about things now.

178
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,519
And with social media,
that has just exploded.

179
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,310
Somebody can say, hey,
that happened to me,

180
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,680
and I didn’t realize
that’s what that was.

181
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,230
I didn’t realize that that
counts as sexual assault.

182
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,570
Does it mean that women
are empowered enough now

183
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,242
to say, not anymore?

184
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,450
Well, this is just the start.

185
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,470
And I’ve been saying
from the beginning

186
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,790
that it’s not just a moment.

187
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,610
It’s a movement.

188
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,220
Me, too.

189
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,720
Me, too.

190
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,540
I have been sexually harassed.

191
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,000
We have to support each
other, and stand together,

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,820
and say that’s it.

193
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,740
We’re done.

194
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,804
No more.

195
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,124
[chanting]

196
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,000
Do I feel vindicated, like you
all finally caught up to us?

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,570
No.

198
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,310
I’m glad.

199
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,990
At the core of this
whole conversation

200
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,750
is a question of, what
does it mean to be heard?

201
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,330
And how is a person supposed
to get themselves heard?

202
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,950
When you are bare with
somebody else alone,

203
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,860
and this is the most
intimate side of you,

204
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,480
and you ask somebody
if they’re O.K.,

205
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,180
I think that that is incredible.

206
00:09:43,180 --> 00:00:00,000
It shouldn’t feel like
a novel idea, but it is.
