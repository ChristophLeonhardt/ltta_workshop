listening too closely to this but the news tonight I kept hearing was Trump was hedging he on three or four cases thanks to Howie Jackson of NBC was forced to say you know I'm gonna watch the testimony tomorrow by dr. Ford and I may hear something that persuades me convinced it convinces me he number of times suggested he's open to jumping off this hill and not fighting for it anymore your thoughts about that and this new information says that he's still bleeding that the judge cabinet his denomination is bleeding again right and the president spoke of course before this latest allegation was made public thanks to the good reporting at NBC this you're right this is the first time even the slightest bit of hedging the slightest bit of doubt was conveyed by President Trump who both publicly and privately had been completely standing behind Kavanagh at this point though they don't have much of a personal connection he said that say in the press conference this is not someone who really knew before this process started he has begun to identify him with him particularly on these allegations he has been saying time and again they does not think these allegations are factual he thinks and he compares them to the same sort of claims of sexual misconduct of mistreatment of women that were levied against him during the campaign charges he of course has completely because he paid off women who he knew had a case against him I must say so like this tells him come on this doesn't inform him as the women aren't telling the truth his experience into informing that they are but he does he paid them to shut up well that is what he did but his public stance has never been that of course he does not acknowledge that he does that and that was where he was again today hitting those notes but it was interesting that he suggested that he would be willing to listen tomorrow to watch this testimony in fact he was also supposed to tomorrow have a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to discuss his future perhaps to decide his fate and prayer and therefore maybe the fate of the Russia probe and he said tonight in this press conference he's going to delay that because he doesn't want it to get in the way he wants you to watch this hearing and he suggested the nation will - thank you so much let me go to Yummie so I was watching one of the best dances I've seen on stage since Michael Jackson's Moonwalker this guy was all over the place I thought it was a hell of a performance actually given the fact he's in trouble and he's in more trouble in the last hour than he was last hour a yummy Sh you went he went head to head with by the way you don't work for the New York Times anymore their loss you're with a you're with Public Television but what do you make how is it I think the candidates see the nomination of Judge cabinet is bleeding right now profusely this latest charges more recent it's an it's a charge of behavior MIT perhaps criminal behavior I guess you could say if you shove something against the water sexual way and as everybody's watching a guest it's a it's a brutal move by a guy who's been consistently portrayed as a guy who is a bed drunk that's the story we keep getting a dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde thing Pleasant guy in the office put him out at a bar for a couple hours he's he's mr. Hyde he's gets very aggressive belligerent people know like people like that and this is fitting that image tonight with this latest story well one of the most important things that came out of this hour and 20 minute press conference was President Trump saying I reserve the right to withdraw my nomination of Brett Kavanaugh if what I see tomorrow moves me that means that President Trump gave himself an out and we all know that President Trump goes with his gut he can be impulsive he can completely ignore his advisor so even if the people in the White House are saying we just need to stick with this guy for as long as we can President Trump could go look at him tomorrow and say you know what I think he's a loser and I don't want to be with him anymore and I don't want my legacy to be tied to this man on top of that President Trump is saying he feels a kinship to Brett Kavanaugh because the president has been accused of sexual of inappropriate sexual behavior so he's watching this with with with rose-colored glasses in some way because he's saying well you know what everybody in this country is guilty until proven innocent and I don't want to be someone that's hard on Brett Kavanaugh but I think Brett Kavanaugh if he was listening closely he heard the president say when I see you tomorrow if you don't look like someone I want a nominee I will stop nominating you let me go to Mike Murphy a political hand he knows what he's talking about Mike I just heard the door open the trap door he's looking for an escape route tonight the president I know what you heard yeah that was my take - I think in many ways it was a amazingly incoherent press conference but on this I think the subtext was pretty clear he was full of grievance against the idea of these women coming forward but he was expressing that while strapping on an extremely big escape parachute and opening the plane door looked at me like he was winding up to have an option to take a walk from this thing and I think tomorrow is gonna be one of the great I don't know if it's gonna really be a fact-finding mission it was gonna be one of the great shows of American politics and I think the president set himself up to bail out on the nomination tonight we see what let's talk let's talk nasty tough numerical politics arithmetic he needs 50 out of 51 Republicans he gets some Democrats if he gets to 50 as they say you know a Joe Manchin you know you can get the senator from West Virginia if you don't need them that's what the Republican you guys doesn't know that so he still needs 50 Republicans is he anywhere near that right now can you tell after all this I I don't think he is and I think the real the real choice is going to be not delaying it which there will be a lot of pressure and Umrah with new allegations I'm suspicious of anonymous ones the real question will be is it time to change up because the clock is ticking to another nominee delaying it won't make it better so they don't have the votes Friday I think you're gonna see the nomination withdrawn and their move as quick as they can probably into the lame-duck session which the Democrats will go crazy over too but it change the channel try somebody new and get out of this thing and to help with a base you may go with somebody even further right and say see what you left these dignity you made me go further right I can figure some game still played to be played by him and he went her bombshell declaration Julie sweat Nick that's the third accuser who came out today in a sworn declaration alleged that she witnessed efforts by mark judge breadkappa the usual pair and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be gang-raped in a room cabinets lord the ninety allegations let's listen he doesn't know her he doesn't he's never met her and we've had people already calling our office and emailing us saying they don't know her they've never seen her at the parties that they attended with him but when you think about the allegations they are alleging that for years there were gang rapes going on with multiple men with multiple women being victims that is such a frightening allegation no one's gone to the police to this day to report those allegations it's truly outrageous you know I didn't understand that Fatima because she's saying it's outrageous they didn't report it or array just it happens well anyway our only this week the New York New Yorker magazine spoke to mark judges former girlfriend who said that he had told her unashamed ashamedly of an incident that involved him and other boys taking turns having sex with a drunk woman well today the Washington Post is reporting that she is going to share her story with the FBI as part of a reopened background investigation in the Kavanagh this is bleeding it is but you know unfortunately we know that one in three high school girls say they've experienced some form of sexual assault so it is outrageous but it actually happens it happens then and it happened now is that what the lawyer meant there did she meant it was outrageous that had happened or they got reported or it didn't happen well some of it is it's outrageous that something like that could have happened and some of that is feeding into what Trump has already been saying is why didn't they report if it actually happened that sort of victim blaming either settle or not-so-subtle has been happening over the last day there are Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
