one of the four chief organizers for the massive women's March that took place on Saturday is a quote Palestinian American Muslim racial justice and civil rights activist named Linda Sarsour Sarsour who also served as a democratic national convention delegate was honored by President Obama's administration as a champion of change fittingly she also posed in Chicago with an alleged Hamas financier fitting because Barack Obama used to give speeches in honor of Palestinian terror mouthpiece Rashid Khalidi so what exactly drove star suers ire during the women's March here's a clue from 2014 quote ten weeks of paid maternity leave in Saudi Arabia yes paid and you're worrying about women driving puts us to shame if you wonder why hundreds of thousands of women declared themselves brave for marching in favor of taxpayer-funded condoms while doing nothing for women abroad who live in abysmal circumstances this would be it a complete lack of perspective maybe one reason Saudi Arabia is happy to pay for maternity leave is because they bribed their citizens not to rebel against the autocratic regime through massive welfare payments maybe another reason is because the government wants to encourage women to stay home rather than working in Saudi Arabia as the weak reports women can't get a passport without the permission of a husband father or other male Guardian most women can't drive women are prevented from wearing attractive clothing go to public areas that those if you go to those areas that are non segregated they won't let you if you're a woman or even try on clothes at stores this is just another piece of evidence that the government big enough to give you goodies is big enough to take away your right and it turns out that people who think Saudi Arabia's maternity policies rather than restrictions on female driving probably shouldn't be a guide to female freedom in the United States but the left would prefer never to focus on such matters since that would obligate them to favor Western ISM rather than multiculturalism abroad as well as at home so much for the women's March I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so many so many things to get you today I am so excited about all at first the the left had a a very strong reaction to Donald Trump being sworn in on Friday and it was all available in this little nutshell video I think this embodied the the primal fear of so many folks on the left the outrage and also I couldn't stop laughing at this for several days this is just watch Darth Vader no from this lady yeah it's spectacular so she waits until Trump gets inaugurated and then the nose screaming to the sky yeah I'm sure this is gonna win people over it's not like I'm sure look I'm sure that she just defeated Trump Trump isn't gonna be president anymore because this crazy lady is that a dude or a lady I assume that's a lady is screaming to the sky about Donald Trump so all of that is spectacular okay so Before we jump into the substance of the day and there's so much to get to we have to say thank you to our sponsors over at blue apron so several years ago my wife said to me you know what the most annoying thing about

anti-trump protests and the women's March so the left can't deal with the fact that Trump was sworn in on Friday and we'll get to Trump's inaugural speech in a second because as always we we like to be intellectually honest here at the ben shapiro show at something that we actually care about so we're going to tell you the truth not a bunch of crap that you want to hear because if we did that then we might have double the ratings but we'd also have half the moral values so what we're interested in here at the ben shapiro show is actually telling you the truth about what's happening in politics and in culture but first we begin with this truth the left does not know how to deal with donald trump so at the inauguration they're a bunch of people who go nuts and they start burning trash cans and they sent a limo on fire you can see this this tape of this limo in front of this picture of this limo on fire there are rumors going around for a while who's Jesse Jackson's limo that turned out not to be true it would have been beautifully ironic if the protesters burned Jesse Jackson in protest of Trump but that turned out I guess not to have been true so they set this this limo on fire and look at how many members of the media there are right there they're just itching to create this perception like the world is burning like everybody's going nuts the truth is people are upset but the world is not burning nothing is going nuts it's all gonna be okay the Republic is pretty durable we've survived a lot worse than Donald Trump we've survived a lot better than Donald Trump the idea that everything is going to go nuts and cars will burn everyone will die it's not true it's a bunch of crap so no so the left is burning things and if they think this is gonna win allies I don't know why they think it's gonna win allies but they did this and the media covered it up the wazoo bulik one burning car 200 members of the media and you would see that there was again there are those burning trash cans I guess there were two hundred and nineteen total people who are arrested during the inauguration that's not a huge number of people arrested it's some people arrested but the way that the media were playing it right and left were that there were these massive riots taking place in Washington DC not true there is pretty minimal number of people who are very upset meanwhile the media really played up his women's March so the day after the inauguration all across the land women left their homes and went out to march in the streets for something that we don't know what it is honestly I don't know why they were marching they were just out there to signal that they don't like Donald Trump or something no one knows quite why what do you want we don't know when do you want it now so this so everybody apparently was incumbent on everybody to bring a sign and they all brought signs a huge number these signs were about abortion and also about Pussycats for some reason I assume that the signs about Pussycats were not in fact about Pussycats they were just about Donald Trump and his comments on the Access Hollywood bus so some of these signs you see like this one is just sick right it's a it's a bleeding coat hanger that says on it never again I don't know if these people understand irony at all but you're using coat hanger to kill babies like a million babies a year so I'm not sure whether that's an anti-abortion sign or a pro-abortion sign if that's a pro-abortion sign comparing not allowing people to murder babies in the womb to the Holocaust is a weird comparison that's one I haven't seen before also I love these ones that were produced by Nair all pro-choice America the National Abortion Rights Action League they don't like to call themselves that anymore because they don't like to use the word abortion but they produce these pre-made signs and say keep your laws off my and then it's a picture of a pussycat right okay mmm a couple of points about about this particular tack people were wearing what they were calling hats like cats but hats okay and these were supposed to protest Donald Trump cos Donald Trump is such a sexist if you want to drive Americans out of your camp a quick way to do it is just keep saying things like hats over and over and over and then talking about female anatomy a lot of these signs are super obscene there are a lot of kids who showed up to this thing and there are a lot of really obscene signs like that there was we can look at some more of these here's here's some more these signs says we stand up for our human rights plan at dignity bodies diversity health social justice equality America women environment it's a grenade it's a lot of things to stand up for and when you sit down and then and then and these are some of the more innocuous signs we can see another another picture of the signs this is the people holding up signs of Trump just saying nope and we're watching but these are these are the not obscene signs some of the really obscene signs like had full pictures of vaginas like there's one that said read my lips but the the Ellen lips for some reason was just a giant vagina and then there was another one that said the patriarchy can suck my bleep right and if this is supposed to make people feel bad about Donald Trump I'm confused half of the reason that the Trump tape was offensive is because of the casual way that he was addressing the female anatomy if you just keep shouting the word cat without the cat over and over and over all that's gonna happen is you desensitize people to the idea that it's kind of offensive to use that word publicly all you end up doing is just like your vulgarity is making from civil Garrity more acceptable amount less acceptable but people in this women's March don't understand that or don't care the women's March didn't accomplish anything other than to make people feel solidified I guess in their opposition to Trump apparently it Nate silver did something I thought that was interesting he looked at how many people actually marched in various areas of the country what he found was eighty percent of all people March and we're marching in areas Hillary won so it doesn't matter right doesn't matter though it wasn't like there's some big ups well in Ohio and Pennsylvania in Wisconsin all the people who showed up we're in Washington DC and in Los Angeles okay so the women's March happens and the media make a huge deal out of it it's the biggest deal that ever happened the March for Life is happening this week they will immediately ignore the March for Life will have twice as many people in DC alone as this March had across the country it won't matter they'll proclaim that it didn't even happen they'll cover on page 812 of the New York Times that is actually media bias so I'll get to the media bias in in a second first we have to we have to point out also that the celebrities got involved in this women's March Madonna said that she went to the women's March and then she said she wanted to blow up the White House which is acceptable language if you are a a crazy old kook that has more Botox in her than Nancy Pelosi's entire warehouse of Botox that exists in San Francisco Shh it's a secret but but Madonna goes up there and here's what she has to say about the White House yes I'm angry yes I am outraged yes I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House well hold on if Ted Nugent said that with Obama there how fast you think Secret Service would be there pretty pretty damn quickly right I mean come on but Madonna can say it and I guess people just assume the botox has infused her brain and so she can't actually think anymore that that's pretty amazing stuff Ashley Judd who you remember was supposed to run for Senate in Kentucky she hasn't made a movie since like 1932 I think now hasn't made a good movie since 1918 like the invention of the motion picture Ashley Judd was in it and she was she ever in a good movie I'm not sure she was ever a good movie but she used to be she used to be a decent actress and very pretty now she is just Ashley Judd so here's Ashley Judd talking about Donald Trump I am not as nasty as a swastika painted on a pride flag and I didn't know Devils could be resurrected but I feel Hitler in these streets a mustache traded for a toupee Nazis renamed the cabinet's electoral conversion therapy the new gas chambers shaming the gay out of America turning rainbows into suicide notes I am NOT as nasty as racism fraud conflict of interest homophobia sexual assault transphobia white supremacy can stop her there because she's crazy and we're running out of time so Ashley Judd says that the toupee is the new Hitler is the new Hitler mustache which is interesting she also says she compares the gas chambers to electro conversion therapy this is a myth that they've been purveying about Mike Pence it's not true the idea that he's in support of electrocuting gay kids and but she's saying all this stuff and again if they think that this is somehow going to win them converts I don't know who the hell they're talking to who are they talking to dudes a Shia LaBeouf think he's winning converts to the anti Trump cause with behavior like this her Shia LaBeouf fresh off being dragged out of a Broadway show because he's totally insane screaming at this burger this is best performance since since at least transformers 2 yes I can't imagine that Americans are not paying attention to - I can't imagine the Americans are ignoring all of this stuff they're paying attention and they're going if this is how the left responds I thought the Trump was supposed to be crazy right Trump was supposed to be the nutcase uh-huh uh-huh yeah you're making a real difficult for for Americans to turn away from Trump when you act like this gang okay we have to say thank you to another advertiser and then we'll get to Trump's

address to to folks who been waiting so it makes me sad we didn't have Friday shows yet that I couldn't respond immediately to the Trump inaugural but of course the missed takeaway was the fact that Donald Trump actually channeled Bane from Batman in the middle of this speech this is the actual mashup and giving it back to you the people it actually is a direct quote which is amazing but here's the thing here's the thing you know this is obviously facetious Trump is not Bane but the but the sort of populism that Trump was espousing this nationalist populism has nothing to do with conservatism and we're gonna have to break on Facebook and and on YouTube but you go over to Daily wire calm to see why we'll go through his entire inaugural then we'll get to Sean Spicer we're gonna
