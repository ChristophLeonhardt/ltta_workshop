1
00:00:00,408 --> 00:00:02,210
THOSE CONVERSATIONS BACK IN

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,478
JANUARY WHEN WE WERE THERE.

3
00:00:03,478 --> 00:00:04,613
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY BOTCHED

4
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:05,247
AT ALL.

5
00:00:05,247 --> 00:00:05,814
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,517
GREAT TO HAVE YOU.

7
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:10,051
BESIDES THE POLITICAL CONCERNS

8
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,853
OVER THE EMBASSY MOVE, A PAIR OF

9
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,021
CONTROVERSIAL CHRISTIAN PASTORS

10
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,157
ARE FACING CRITICISM TONIGHT

11
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:18,493
OVER THEIR INVOLVEMENT.

12
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:19,594
PASTOR ROBERT WILL DELIVER THE

13
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:21,096
OPENING PRAYER.

14
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:22,230
>> WE THANK YOU EVERY DAY THAT

15
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,099
YOU HAVE GIVEN US A PRESIDENT

16
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:27,335
WHO BOLDLY STANDS ON THE RIGHT

17
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,070
SIDE OF HISTORY, BUT MORE

18
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,872
IMPORTANTLY STANDS ON THE RIGHT

19
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:31,773
SIDE OF YOU, GOD WHEN IT COMES

20
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,476
TO ISRAEL.

21
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:36,945
>> Shannon: JOINS US NOW LIVE

22
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:37,412
FROM JERUSALEM.

23
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,513
A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND

24
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,815
SENIOR PASTOR AT THE FIRST

25
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:41,516
BAPTIST PART OF MY CHURCH OF

26
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:42,083
DALLAS.

27
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,085
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.

28
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:44,452
>> THANKS.

29
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:45,754
>> Shannon: I KNOW YOU HAD A

30
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,688
SHORT NIGHT THERE.

31
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:47,689
IT'S MORNING THERE IN JERUSALEM.

32
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,424
LET ME ASK YOU BECAUSE THERE'S

33
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,926
BEEN SO MUCH REPORTING ALL DAY

34
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,860
TALKING ABOUT THE VIOLENCE,

35
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,594
TALKING ABOUT THE DOZENS WHO

36
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,563
HAVE BEEN KILLED, THAT IS

37
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,231
TRAGIC, BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU

38
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,299
ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS

39
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,067
THERE IN THE STREETS OF

40
00:00:59,067 --> 00:00:59,434
JERUSALEM.

41
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,902
WHAT DID YOU SEE JUST TALKING TO

42
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:01,603
AVERAGE FOLKS TODAY ABOUT HOW

43
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,272
THEY WERE FEELING?

44
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,609
>> THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE AIR OF

45
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,610
EXCITEMENT HERE IN JERUSALEM

46
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,512
OVER WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER

47
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:11,112
TODAY.

48
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,047
SHANNON, I CAN'T WALK DOWN THE

49
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,615
STREETS OF JERUSALEM WITHOUT

50
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,452
PEOPLE STOPPING ME AND SAYING

51
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,520
PASTOR, THANK YOU FOR WHAT

52
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,187
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS ARE

53
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:19,721
DOING.

54
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:21,156
THANK YOU FOR WHAT AMERICA IS

55
00:01:21,156 --> 00:01:21,923
DOING.

56
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:22,457
THANK YOU FOR WHAT

57
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,093
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE IN

58
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:26,461
STANDING WITH ISRAEL.

59
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,363
THERE IS REAL EXCITEMENT IN THIS

60
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,899
CITY THAT IS NOT BEING DROWNED

61
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:31,499
OUT BY THE VIOLENCE.

62
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,701
>> Shannon: YOU WERE A BIG

63
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:33,435
PART OF THE CEREMONIES TODAY AND

64
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:34,970
THERE WERE FOLKS THAT WERE NOT

65
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,304
HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

66
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,038
MITT ROMNEY AMONG THEM TWEETING

67
00:01:37,038 --> 00:01:38,173
OUT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD

68
00:01:38,173 --> 00:01:40,308
THAT PLACE.

69
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,676
THE MET REPRESENTING THE

70
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,477
UNITED STATES THERE BASED ON

71
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,211
PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT YOU'VE

72
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:47,115
MADE ABOUT MORMONS, ABOUT OTHER

73
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:47,716
RELIGIONS.

74
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,683
TWEETING THIS TODAY.

75
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:49,985
TODAY IS A DAY OF CELEBRATION AS

76
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,319
THE U.S. EMBASSY OPENS IN

77
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,954
JERUSALEM.

78
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:55,156
THE CHOICE OF PASTOR ROBERT

79
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,291
JEFFRESS TO OFFER A PRAYER SENDS

80
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,325
EXACTLY THE WRONG MESSAGE.

81
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,527
HE HAS A HISTORY OF BIGOTED

82
00:01:59,527 --> 00:02:01,029
COMMENTS ABOUT LGBTQ PEOPLE,

83
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:04,366
MUSLIMS, CHRISTIANS, AND OTHER

84
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:04,733
RELIGIONS.

85
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,301
YOUR RESPONSE?

86
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,235
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'VE NEVER SAID

87
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:10,170
ANYTHING DEROGATORY ABOUT THE

88
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,574
JEWISH PEOPLE.

89
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:14,776
I TALKED ABOUT TODAY THE ONE

90
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,578
THING WE SHARE IS THE SAME

91
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:16,978
SCRIPTURES.

92
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,179
I WANT TO BE CLEAR.

93
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,182
I'M NOT A BIGOT, I'M NOT AN

94
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,518
EXTREMIST, BUT I DO WITHOUT

95
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,520
APOLOGY EMBRACE THE MOST

96
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,055
FOUNDATIONAL BELIEF OF

97
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:29,391
CHRISTIANITY, AND THAT IS THAT

98
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,592
FAITH ALONE IN JESUS CHRIST IS

99
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,160
THE EXCLUSIVE WAY TO HEAVEN.

100
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,796
JESUS SAID I AM THE WAY, THE

101
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,598
TRUTH AND ALLY, NO MAN COMES TO

102
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,767
THE FATHER BUT BY ME.

103
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,568
PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE WITH JESUS'

104
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:40,869
WORDS.

105
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,203
MILLIONS OF THEM DO, BUT THE

106
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,072
FACT THAT I AND HUNDREDS OF

107
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:45,774
MILLIONS OF EVANGELICAL

108
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,175
CHRISTIANS AROUND THE WORLD

109
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:47,909
BELIEVE WHAT JESUS SAID ABOUT

110
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,812
THE WAY TO HEAVEN DOES NOT MAKE

111
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:51,212
US A BIGOT.

112
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,449
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISING

113
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,183
STATEMENT.

114
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:56,584
THE FACT IS THIS HAS BEEN THE

115
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:58,586
TEACHING OF THE CHURCH FOR 2,000

116
00:02:58,586 --> 00:02:58,987
YEARS.

117
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:00,388
>> Shannon: DO UNDERSTAND WHY

118
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,390
SOME FOLKS ARE OFFENDED AND ARE

119
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,291
YOU SURPRISED AT ALL BY THE

120
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,192
REACTION AND THE CRITICS THAT

121
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,395
YOU HAD TODAY?

122
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,697
>> I THINK PEOPLE MANY TIMES

123
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:11,366
TAKE MY STATEMENTS OUT OF

124
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,634
CONTEXT AND I THINK THAT HAS

125
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:13,802
HAPPENED MANY TIMES.

126
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,071
I THINK IT'S SAD, REALLY, THAT

127
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,306
ON SUCH A HISTORIC DAY LIKE

128
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,240
TODAY MITT ROMNEY WOULD FEEL THE

129
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,943
NEED TO STEAL THE SPOTLIGHT BY

130
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:23,378
LAUNCHING A VICIOUS AND

131
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:24,379
UNFOUNDED ATTACK AGAINST ME.

132
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,182
I'M NOT A BIGOT OR AN EXTREMIST.

133
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,651
I DON'T HATE ANYBODY, BUT I DO

134
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,986
WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW CHRIST AS

135
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:32,320
SAVIOR.

136
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,790
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO I DID A

137
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,392
DEAL AT THE REAGAN LIBRARY WITH

138
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,760
DENNIS PRAGER, THE JEWISH TALK

139
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,962
SHOW HOST AND FOR 90 MINUTES WE

140
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:41,996
TALKED ABOUT THE COMMONALITY

141
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,598
BETWEEN JUDAISM AND

142
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,165
CHRISTIANITY.

143
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,167
WE WORSHIP THE SAME GOD, REVERE

144
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,904
THE SAME SCRIPTURES, BUT WE

145
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,005
DIFFERENCES.

146
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,774
DENNIS SAID HE BELIEVES YOU GO

147
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,808
TO HEAVEN BY GOOD WORKS.

148
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,643
I SAID CHRISTIANITY SAYS IT'S BY

149
00:03:55,643 --> 00:03:55,944
FAITH.

150
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,646
BUT DENNIS KREGER TELL MIKE

151
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,015
PRAGER SAID I'M NOT OFFENDED, I

152
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,584
SEE IT AS A SIGN OF AFFECTION,

153
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,586
THAT HE REALLY CARES ABOUT ME.

154
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,054
AND IF I BELIEVE WHAT ROBERT DID

155
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:09,591
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD TRY.

156
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,792
I THINK WE CAN HAVE A CIVIL

157
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,095
DIALOGUE WITHOUT LAUNCHING INTO

158
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,397
THESE VITRIOLIC ATTACKS LIKE WE

159
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:16,430
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST TWO

160
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:16,964
DAYS.

161
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:17,699
>> Shannon: OF COURSE

162
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,666
RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES ARE MUCH

163
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,201
OF THE UNREST, THE ROOT OF THE

164
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,469
UNREST THERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

165
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,506
VERY QUICKLY, WHICH SIDE DO YOU

166
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:25,640
WEIGH ON, DOES THIS MOVE US

167
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,509
CLOSER TO HER FURTHER AWAY FROM

168
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,578
LASTING PEACE PROCESS THERE?

169
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,614
>> I THINK THIS MOVES US MUCH

170
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,581
CLOSER TO LASTING PEACE AND I

171
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,783
KNOW FROM TALKING TO

172
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,785
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THAT'S WHAT HE

173
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:37,585
WANTS.

174
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:38,653
THE OTHER DAY BENJAMIN NETANYAHU

175
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,954
SAID TO A GROUP OF US, SOMETHING

176
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:42,390
I WILL NEVER FORGET, HE SAID YOU

177
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,025
CAN NEVER BUILD PEACE ON A LIE.

178
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,994
YOU HAVE TO BUILD PEACE ON

179
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,594
TRUTH.

180
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:48,296
AND THE TRUTH IS JERUSALEM IS

181
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,531
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND HAS

182
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:52,767
BEEN FOR 3,000 YEARS AND

183
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,235
RECOGNIZING THAT IS THE

184
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:54,769
BEGINNING PLACE.

185
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:56,438
NOT THE ENDING PLACE, BUT THE

186
00:04:56,438 --> 00:04:57,872
BEGINNING PLACE FOR TRUE PEACE

187
00:04:57,872 --> 00:04:58,773
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

188
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:00,074
>> Shannon: HAVING BEEN THERE

189
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:00,642
AND TALKED TO THE TOP

190
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:03,111
