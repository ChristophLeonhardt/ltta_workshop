WE USE THREE DAYS TO JUMP BACK

42
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,234
AND LOOK AT HOW REAGAN GETS TO

43
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:20,968
THIS POINT AND REALLY LEADS TO

44
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:23,171
THE SEMINAL MOMENT OF THE

45
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:23,905
COLD WAR COMING TO AN END, THE

46
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:27,375
WALL COMING DOWN AND COMMUNISM

47
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,409
REALLY TAKING A HIT.

48
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,778
THE WHOLE WORLD WAS CHANGED SOON

49
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:31,179
AFTER THAT.

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,450
KNOW ABOUT COMMUNISM OR THE

52
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,385
SOVIET UNION THAT OTHERS MISSED?

53
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,353
>> FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE

54
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:39,154
THOUGHT THAT COMMUNISM WAS JUST

55
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:41,789
NOT GOING TO MAKE IT AND THAT IT

56
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:45,793
WAS DESTINED, AS HE SAID IN HIS

57
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,362
SPEECH, HE SPOKE ABOUT THAT FOR

58
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:48,396
A LONG TIME EVEN BACK WHEN HE

59
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:50,165
WAS PRESIDENT OF THE

SEE THAT THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE.

63
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:00,208
GIVES SOME REALLY STINGING

64
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,176
SPEECHES INCLUDING CALLING THE

65
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:02,077
SOVIET UNION AND EVIL EMPIRE.

66
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:05,614
BUT WHEN GORBACHEV COMES UP, HE

67
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:06,648
SEES AND GORBACHEV SOMEONE HE

68
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:07,549
CAN NEGOTIATE WITH.

69
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,184
HE WAS TOUGH AND SOME OF THOSE

70
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:09,518
SUMMITS.

71
00:02:09,518 --> 00:02:10,985

72
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,155
SCENES, NEW NUGGETS, INTERVIEWS,

73
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,723
I INTERVIEWED SECRETARY OF STATE

74
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:16,158
GEORGE SCHULTZ, WHO IS A

75
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:16,992
NATIONAL TREASURE.

76
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:18,360
AT HIS AGE, REMEMBERS MEETINGS

77
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,761
LIKE THEY WERE YESTERDAY.

78
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,696
SOME ORAL HISTORIES THAT REALLY

79
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:24,666
HAD NEVER BEEN DUG INTO ABOUT

80
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,400
BEHIND THE SCENES AND IT REALLY

81
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,202
PAINTS A PICTURE OF HOW THE

82
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:29,805
COLD WAR COMES TO THE END.

83
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:31,773
>> Tucker: INTERESTING.

84
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:32,808
I HAVE AN OFFICE NEXT TO YOURS

85
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,142

THIS BOOK FOR A WHILE.

87
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:37,446
WHAT DID YOU COME AWAY THINKING

88
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:38,180
ABOUT REAGAN?

89
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,314
DID IT CHANGE YOUR VIEW OF HIM?

90
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:42,584
>> I THINK AT THE TIME HE WAS

91
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,185
UNDERAPPRECIATED.

92
00:02:43,185 --> 00:02:45,153
THERE WERE A LOT OF BOOKS

93
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:45,821
LOOKING BACK FAVORABLY TO

94
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,357
REAGAN, BUT THIS IS MORE

95
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:49,324
REPORTING ON HISTORY AND SOME OF

96
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:51,393
THE BEHIND THE SCENES MOMENTS

97
00:02:51,393 --> 00:02:51,960
AND SPEECHES.

98
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,328
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE GIVES THAT

99
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:56,165
SPEECH IN BERLIN AT THE GATE,

100
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,200
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL,

101
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,067
MR. GORBACHEV, THERE WERE ABOUT

102
00:02:59,067 --> 00:02:59,668
TEN PEOPLE INSIDE THE

103
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:01,270
WHITE HOUSE WHO DID NOT WANT HIM

104
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,171
TO SAY THAT.

105
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,305
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TOOK IT OUT

106
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:04,173
OF THE SPEECH MULTIPLE TIMES.

107
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:07,142
HE KEPT ON PUTTING IT BACK IN.

108
00:03:07,142 --> 00:03:09,044
AND HE WENT TO THAT SPEECH WITH

109
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:12,181
IT NOT IN AND WE HAD A

110
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:12,915
CONVERSATION IN THE LIMO ON THE

111
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:15,050
WAY TO THE WALL WHERE HE TURNS

112
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,753
TO AN AIDE AND SAYS THE GUYS AT

113
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:19,288
STATE ARE GOING TO KILL ME, BUT

114
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,589
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO

115
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:23,792
AND HE PUTS IT BACK IN.

116
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,729
THAT SPEECH HAPPENS ON JUNE 12TH

117
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:27,162
1987.

118
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,031
WE HAVE A BIG SUMMIT COMING UP

119
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:32,268
JUNE 12TH IN SINGAPORE AND I

120
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,003
DIDN'T PLAN IT THAT WAY, BUT

121
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:36,372
THERE IS SOME SYNERGY THEIR OWN

122
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:36,705
HISTORY.

123
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:37,339
>> Tucker: CAN YOU IMAGINE

124
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:40,609
BEING THE GUY WHO TOOK OUT THE

125
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,378
PHRASE TEAR DOWN THIS WALL?

126
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:43,379
[LAUGHS]

127
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,814
I HOPE HISTORY TREATS HIM BADLY.

128
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:47,283
THIS BOOK IS OUT TOMORROW.

129
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,784
THESE ARE NOT JUST THE NORMAL
