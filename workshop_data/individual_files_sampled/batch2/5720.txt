Brett Kavanaugh is defending himself against accusations of sexual misconduct from when he was in high school and college in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dianne Feinstein Cavanaugh writes quote there is now a frenzy to come up with something anything that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring adding I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process the coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out the vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out the last minute character assassination will not succeed and Cavanaugh spoke for the first time publicly about the allegations denying he ever engaged in any misconduct I was never at any such party the other people who are alleged to be present said they do not remember any such party a woman who was present another woman who was present who is dr. Ford's lifelong friend and then has said she doesn't know me and never remembers being at a party with me at any time in her life I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter and the girls from the schools I went to and I were saying that all through all these years that are in question you were a virgin that's correct never had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school correct through what years in college since we're probing into your personal years many years after I'll leave it at that many years after do you believe there should be an FBI investigation into these allegations and that a pause should happen and you know sort it all out if there's nothing to worry about nothing to hide why not have that process Ashley and then all she different I want to be heard I was first to interviewed last Monday the day after the allegation appeared by the committee staff under penalty of felony and I denied this categorically and unequivocally and I said twice during that I said I want to hear him tomorrow last Tuesday a week ago okay a couple takeaways from that first of all that last scene which a lot of people have described as her being cut off by him she clearly was uncomfortable answering that question and it's something that we do for each other in different settings there's some times that you I don't want to answer something you'll pop in yeah and so she gave that look and so that certainly seemed to be in bounds also very interesting a lot of people last night on Twitter and some on television were mocking the fact that he remained a virgin until he was married obviously a central tenet of conservative Catholicism of conservative sort of the conservative evangelical world and of other other religions fascinating interview and I think the only thing that we can do at this point if we're really doing our jobs I said this is what he said and it needs to be considered and these two women who have come up with their stories and everything they have said also needs to be considered especially given how difficult it would be for any woman to do that and I think everybody should want the best process possible to get the truth out and there should be no opinion put out about what he said because certainly no one's allowed to put any opinion out about what these women are saying without being burned at the stake and I understand that because women haven't had their voices for decades we are at a moment where women can speak but that means we also have to let when it matters when it counts men speak as well and he was sharing personal information caddy do you disagree no I do agree and I think it's unfortunate that Brett Cavanaugh has called this part of a smear campaign because that by default is passing a judgement on what these women are saying now he's venom are gonna say yeah that we are very white that we are defending ourselves but I think that is why we have to have some kind of an investigation that probably is not what we're going to get on Thursday which is the Senate hearing and every FBI official that I have spoken to has said to me that we do do this there are things that we could do we know this drill even if it dates back thirty years we may not come to something dispositive we may not be able to prove it but people do say things that are different to journalists than they say to FBI investigators when they're on the threat of perjury and there are ways that investigators can ask questions and dig into information that journalists don't necessarily have I think I think we would get closer perhaps to some kind of understanding if we went through that process and it would be more neutral is something that could be taken out of this hideous moment politically that we're in a made neutral order is not it's not like speaking to FBI based status and what do you think Willie what did you think then of you well I think it was extraordinary on many fronts number one that he did the interview usually a Supreme Court nominee is locked in a black box until the until his hearing and then until the until the vote we don't see or hear from the the nominee number two let's step back and think about we have a Supreme Court nominee discussing when he lost his virginity as a way of on national television as a way through this process he believes for him but I think there are so many people behaving so badly right now right there's there's so much willful dishonesty there are so many people who've made up their minds and there are people on the right who are saying she's a liar she's making this up you have no idea we don't know the facts there are people on the other side or they're saying he's a liar he's making up his side of the story you have no idea you don't have all the facts and that's why I've said what Martha asked to judge Cavanaugh there is a central question if your judge Cavanaugh wouldn't you want an independent body in the FBI to take a look at this to clear this because if they go through a Senate hearing and it becomes a circus they push it through he passes he's seated on the Supreme Court right there will be as we've said last week an asterisk next to his name as long as he's there well and and why wouldn't they want an FBI investigation especially after the second story came out yesterday now like so we have those those those clips those quotes from the New York Times and and also New Yorker one here yeah this is so this was in the New York a Republican seized on this language Senate Democrats a today in our initial conversations with in New Yorker she was reluctant to characterize Cavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty you have the rest of it the New York Times now is coming here okay so and then in the New York Times The Times interviewed several dozen people over the past week an attempt to corroborate Ramirez a story could find no one with first-hand knowledge and in fact Mike they said that she called people around the trying to get a corroborating witness and while speaking with them said that she wasn't even sure if it was Kavanagh who had committed this deeply offensive act upon her and so Republicans rightly saying wait a second you have to allegations nobody is a corroborating witness said either of these events so there was the belief many many saying in the Republican Party yesterday that actually the second story ended up in a way undermining the first story yeah and I heard that not only from Republicans I heard that from journalists and I heard that from a lot of people who were former Republicans who don't want Kavanagh to pass who just think that to me quick the more questions that are out there the more inconsistencies that are out there the more ambiguities are out there the more it helps that the the the Republican cause here's Charlie Sykes last night on hardball I do think that the the the second allegation in some ways has had the effect of undermining the credibility of the first one because look this is the moment where you want solid credible information that lines up this is also why I think it's a huge mistake for Republicans not to reopen the FBI investigation if they are concerned about these false allegations make people tell them to the FBI and and and Charlie makes the point there the the second allegations did in certainly on Capitol Hill a lot of Democrats and Republicans think it actually undermined the first story because all of the questions not that people are questioning the legitimacy of her story but just all the ambiguities number one and then number two if you're a Republican and if you're Brett Kavanaugh why wouldn't you want the FBI investigating these two stories that you say you're the work of a fabulous correct and it's all part of this huge story that I sense is rumbling through the country with people feeling awkward watching the confirmation process of a potential Supreme Court justice being asked if he had sex in high school is the country is the country exhausted by this because it just goes on and on and on it's part of the Trump presidency Donald Trump has achieved his wildest dreams he literally is the star of a daily global show yeah he is the most talked-about figure in the world and this co-star Brett Kavanaugh comes to us comes to the country he seems like a decent man he is accused of what he is accused of the allegations have been leveled and now we're into spiral into a second debate do you believe the woman do you disbelieve that exactly that Trump wanted it but it's proof it's proof what has happened here is proof why women do not come and nobody's hands are clean and and the other Democrats hands are not clean if you're talking about why women don't come forward well this is the second time in a quarter century that a woman has gone to the Senate Judiciary Committee and spoken with the Democrats and say I have information about the nominee please don't reveal my name and they leaked it when it became politically expedient for Democrats to leak it after Cavanaugh was about to cruise the confirmation and there's one other aspect of this story that I suspect lingers out there and it is common sense no matter whether you're on the left or whether you're on the right or whether you live in the middle politically despite the damage that's been done to the FBI but mr. Trump people have got to wonder what would be wrong with taking an extra two or three days to have the FBI answer if it can some of these questions that have been raised well I think Micah's got it right we have to take dr. Ford's accusation very serious very and taking it seriously means looking into it with an investigative body that's not partisan because Chuck Grassley and Republicans whether or not they are will always be viewed as partisans in this they want red Cavanaugh on the Supreme Court someone else has to look at this so whatever the FBI finds out that that outcome can be respected because right now all we have are accusations we have people who were alleged to have been in the room or at that party back thirty six years ago who have come forward and said they don't recall that so it's dr. Ford standing on her own let someone else look into it so we can move forward one way or the other and Susan Collins said that miss Ramirez should also come forward and she should there were if you read the story while there were no corroborating witnesses while there were it questions about her memory whether it was a faulty memory whether she could even identify Cavanagh at the end of the day she did and she should be heard as well that's what Susan Collins thinks so caddy helped me out here because while we want and we both fight everyday for women to have their voices and to understand that our stories and our experiences will be not only understood believed valued but also in a case like this isn't an important that a woman has her voice but then also has to expect questions if she wants things to bear out in the law or for something like a Supreme Court nomination to be reconsidered if you feel it's your moral duty to tell your story in light of the Supreme Court nomination process that's happening isn't it also important to expect questions not to be smeared not to be disbelieved by pundits all over not to have but also not to have the person you're accusing convicted in the public eye in the media I by people like you and me isn't it important that there is a process that you're stepping into and it might be slightly tough I mean you're telling a difficult story about what happened to you and people are going to question the validity of that story is that to be expected or are we to be believed whole-hog no we shouldn't be believed and I think women are tougher than that I do think we can take question and we should be able to take questioning these are variables if something happens notice these are serious accusations for somebody who is going for an incredibly important job in the country and it is totally legitimate that the accusations should be able to withstand questioning I think it is better that questioning is done by people who are professionals in the questioning process than amongst senators who don't really know how to handle those questions and could have come across as they didn't vote for it but of course it was insensitive but Ford doesn't want that but Ford has said that she doesn't well she would like the Senate okay and so that's a little bit she has evolved a little bit and she has got into the midst of the politics of this but I also think for the long term if women are going to be believed and we're moving in the right direction we've gone from 91 where women were not believed to now today where women are believed but if we really want women to believed over the wrong long run we need to get away from this narrative that women come up with stories that are fake actually what is it something like 2 to 10 percent of all rape reports are fake it's tiny in the scheme of things but if we can get women to withstand the process of questioning and prove that they are telling the truth right that storyline oh well they make it up we'll start to recede and that is important for us in the long run so we need to be able to take those questions and also Republicans can't only be for due process that's correct when it's politically expedient for Republicans I mean they should want Democrats can't can't cry about Donald Trump's breach of constitutional norms and and and can't cry about the lack of due process and then when it's politically expedient for them suddenly throw a new process out the window it's so amazing they're Republicans Democrats in these political events they only believe in due process it seems when it fits now the United States senators Democrats yesterday saying flat out explicitly Ryan's no due process he's guilty I am absolutely shocked by some of the things I heard from United States Senate on both sides on both side Angie Graham saying there is nothing she could say that would change my mind Lindsey great okay what Lindsey Graham saying there's nothing she can say to change my mind Mitch McConnell saying we're gonna steamroll over this know no matter what and Kirsten Gillibrand saying I believe he's guilty there's no reason for a hearing he's guilty there's no such thing as due process why are they even why are they even going to vote right put your vote in now if you really don't care about the facts if you've already predetermined how this is going to turn out maybe you were the ones in the dorm rooms maybe The New Yorker should have called you three because you were there oh wait no you weren't exactly due process why don't you listen to dr. Ford and perhaps miss Ramirez and Brett Kavanaugh before you go creaming to the cheap seats on your political side I went wait wait wait and I just want to say that same message applies to the media and I'm oh right this three-hour block of time oh my star free zone if there would be no convicting of either person on either side on this show and honestly if they're smearing of dr. Ford or miss Ramirez or Brett Kavanaugh on this show you will be kicked off this set we're not doing that it's just facts you know we we have been doing before we have been harshly critical of Fox News for being in the tank television it's everywhere for Donald Trump lemmings dream let me tell you something what we've seen the last week has made me one I'll address the but we call networks and put a D in front of the name of the so-called journalists you know that have already decided the Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist or what was the what was the serial sexual abuse oh really you know that do you really know that it's Lindsey Graham like John McCain would be ashamed I'm just gonna set John that's the Queenie ashamed John McCain is fairly cold in the ground and Lindsey Graham is saying you know if he could have only gotten to know Donald Trump better he would have liked them no he knew Donald Trump hmm he knew Donald Trump many hated him well good reason this is this has not been the the media's finest hour certainly in the coverage of this but it's also in terms of the United States senators if this were a jury and in the sense it is a jury because they're going to vote up or down on this candidate half the Senate at least half the Senate would be recused from jury duty I mean a prosecution would say no you Lindsey Graham he can't be on this jury he can't vote up or down on this guy because he's already already indicated you know kirsten gillibrand insane let's be fair all right mazie Hirono let's be fair alright thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4 Morning Joe and MSNBC thanks so much for watching
