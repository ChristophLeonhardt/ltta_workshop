I think that's very fair actually seems to be a month and that's exactly what my husband would say okay just a little bit of me seeming to be a Friday afternoon thank you very much for being here I really appreciate it and I appreciate the opportunity to be amongst like-minded people I said earlier where we were speaking you know being in America being here at CPAC is very much like taking a warm bath like it's very enjoyable to be in to be a mom so I can say when I think everyone's very lovely other ones break charming and everyone wants to work hard and play fair I think being in the UK in Western Europe is very much like stabbing a cold shower with someone to be nice on your head it's kind of like an endurance thing I just have to withstand it and hope the water like it might stop and send me the Islamic invasion of Western Europe is it's probably not lumping matter with her freedom for us a fear freedom has truly been lost my main message here at CPAC is that America does not want to become like Western Europe do not become for us do not let yourselves fall as the UK has fallen and I say that with every respect for my country I love my country enjoyed the army went through Sam's first wants to fight for my country and not do it by other means I love the place I came from the problem is that many of us no longer recognize it anymore my inbox is filled with emails from Anthony ladies and gentlemen not at all actually my mother would tell me after I said that 72 was old but from elderly ladies and gentlemen who said to me that they're glad their times nearly up because they don't want to be around when they see their country finally fall and that's truly the place we're at and I would say that if we want to be careful of things that so much we see is not true one of the examples I watched and witnessed has been the migrant invasion that has been very much coordinated paid for enabled by Western governments and they use a vehicle called NGOs non-governmental organizations charities read a lot about recent weeks those NGOs to me are very much government's of work and The Replacements of white conservative Christians in particular it's very clear to observe I spent a summer I'll go from Libya to Sicily to southern Italy with the migrant trail we're told that these migrants are on terribly small boats that they're putting their lives at risk young women and children fleeing for their lives from Libya what I actually found was a mafia controls Rick of people that small boats small little dinghy than what you see in the media with small children being picked on them but there's no children to be found it's all young men of fighting age you've mounted to elbow their way to the front to have the funds to be able to enjoy an idea a small tugboat tugs the small dinghy out out of Libya Libya waters into the Med and then the NGO votes are dispatched to go rescue those guys on that rig and those NGO birds like sacred talking and others but a special on a certain day coordinated by time and work as a ferry service across the met that is being supported by huge funds a 45 euro ahead per man that arrives on the shores of Italy and they're given accommodation and they are paid another the hotels at some needs me of course it's much more lucrative to fill your hotel with migrants of 45 euro a day than it is to try and seek the tourist dollar and so hotels in southern Italy and full of migrants pay 45 euros a day and when you ask anyone where's this coming from where to come to always Rome all roads lead to Rome when it comes to human trafficking across the Med that's a curious thing in itself I spent some time in the counter can in the jungle camp where these migrants end up because elves with destination is very often the UK's not Germany in the way anything you would want to go to Germany but we know that we are though they end up in Calais I went to Calais I spent a couple nights there but I wanted to really kind of be a monster too many journalists that they turn get a bit of b-roll and leave again after a couple hours and I always find that a curious kind of journalism or about that big scene somewhere than them finding out any truths but at my time there I was looking hard for women and children that found none I found at night by the roadside where they try and get on to the trucks I found one woman with a young son the next day when I came to count to try point issues aerotrain and I was in the wrong area I was in the Afghan area and the Afghans were like what do you do it no no she's very try it she would have been and I went to the smiley area no she's never tried she wouldn't hear and we imagine somehow in this grand notion we have people to arrive in starting a new life we like to believe in the we are a nation of migrants who hear it all the time yeah but the immigrants that arrived in New York wanted to start a better life the immigrants that arrived in the jungle comfort can come with every single old hatred they ever had the aerotrain thing the Afghans who hate the Somalis and they couldn't even believe that I was an Afghan area asking for a Somali woman they've ever trained in binocular time when I found her eventually it turned out she didn't have a young son at all she had a young girl but by night she dressed her son her daughter as a son as a boy so that no one would try and take and that's the reality of the camp in the jungle at Calais and when Trump talked about no-go zones and Sweden and all of the left-wing media mocked him they don't exist they said walking through the pedestrian zone instead of Stockholm which is very nice indeed unless a person is the Miss jihadi drives a truck damn it smashes up arguments has been the case but I want there know going some sweet no-go zones of Sweden they're only three subway stops outside of Stockholm you hit those suburbs rinkeby in others and there is no white people there there are no women there with their heads uncovered an ad a third generation of Micra tried to stop me getting off the bus I was on no no no wrong place wrong person wrong place she said that's in Sweden in Western Europe and in the wrong she was frightened for me eventually I found a young girl white girl who happened to live in me beaten afford to move and she was broken into a week before and the police when she round them they couldn't come because it's too dangerous now for the police to please those owners and when she goes home at night she's not allowed to carry pepper spray even though there's raid games there'll know the statistics on rate gangs in Sweden are off the chart she's not allowed to carry pepper spray because the liberal feminists in Sweden have made it such that a woman accidentally pepper sprayed the wrong member of the rape gang because she was prosecuted for doing such a thing so the liberal feminists she had to hide her face when I interviewed her and wrote this up from column she want her face published not because she was frightened of the immigrant gangs but she was frightened of the liberal feminists because they would come Islamophobic and of course so many of my client I don't know what kind that is what's they haven't screaming the boots bitch in Britain they you know the British a quarter or an angry and generous come ask any which way they can of course I've been arrested and interviewed under caution by the major crime and homicide to come and those are people that deal with serial killers two men in a police station interviewing me about column I wrote when I called Michael two cockroaches that stand by that of course I have been threatened with a repatriation from Australia for mentioning that I thought a boner was a particularly efficient way of cleansing certain types of people I've never I've included massage I appreciate that but sometimes you have to be hard to make point they do attack on it slightly but I think what you're being attacked you know you're slightly over the target earlier on this year two people were sent to prison because their plan was to behead me as a wedding gift the Muslim lady had asked the most intense when she's going to marry to behead me that was no way to get she's gonna abort a plastic dummy and a stabbing knife and he'd practice stabbing the plastic dummy before coming for me unfortunately they got them first and they've now been sent down and I live to fight another day but the threat against our personal individual freedoms for speaking out about the truths that I've gone to appoint it's clearly evident wherever I am but I would say I went to a Swedish highest station it's called the toughest fire station in Sweden it deals with the hardest part in the hardest places and I met the chief fireman he's a session he good-looking gentleman I made excuses to talk for very long time but they're just knowing new fence a huge huge fence built because the fire rigs were under attack by the migrants they've come installed in the cutting equipment because it's useful for breaking into homes they would still truck tires off the Rings they would steal anything they could get their hands on even to go and respond to a fire in Malmo they require a police escort because they have to have someone patrolling the fire engine in order that there is the stuff stolen from it whilst it's trying to accomplish a fire and also because the microts calling fake fires in order to attack the fire engines and the people serving often so actually it's become a kind of disaster zone now I effects this gentleman bear in mind we all talk about walls or not I said if this going to be the way are we going to build more walls to keep people out and he said no in future we'll build walls to keep the people we love inside and that's really stayed with me that line I really just got back from South Africa and in fact itself looked a little bit dodgy for a while and they confiscated my passport for hate crimes because I've been investigating the slaughter of white farmers and said that there's two weeks ago and I got above the back and left but what I found in South Africa of course is precisely that people live behind huge fences huge walls gated communities to keep the minority white population said there's only 8% whites left and south they say within 10 years they'll be gone because they have been hunted to extinction it strikes me that the world wants to talk about the hunting of the white rhino but it doesn't talk about the hunting of the white bar in South Africa and I think it's a deeply upsetting thing that we're moving to a model where we live behind gates in order to try to be safe I think that's a very difficult thing that's what the people of South Africa see so when I think about freedom it's a curious idea but from what I've seen in the passage I've seen throughout Western Europe from Libya to Sicily to Calais to Sweden in the UK and then to South Africa we will indeed end up living behind gated communities in order to keep the people we know safe inside thank you very much being here at CPAC is a fantastic experience it's like being in a warm bath surrounded by like-minded people whereas being in the UK is kind of like being in a cold shower it's like an endurance event for more updates on CPAC and for more of my material join me at Hopkins WorldCom you
