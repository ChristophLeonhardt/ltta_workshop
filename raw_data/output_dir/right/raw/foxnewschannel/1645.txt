1
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:11,722
>> Greg: AN AMAZING THING TOOK

2
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,222
PLACE WEDNESDAY.

3
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:13,490
THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER IN

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,691
ILLINOIS TAPPED A 19-YEAR-OLD

5
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:16,626
GUNMAN AND A HIGH SCHOOL SAVING

6
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:17,494
COUNTLESS LIVES.

7
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:18,428
WHEN THE SUSPECT STARTED

8
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:20,297
SHOOTING NEAR THE SCHOOL GYM,

9
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:22,165
THE OFFICER CONFRONTED HIM,

10
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,600
CHASED HIM, SHOT HIM.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,369
>> I CANNOT BE MORE PROUD OF THE

12
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:27,637
POLICE OFFICER AND WHEN HE

13
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:28,705
RESPONDED TO THE SITUATION.

14
00:00:28,705 --> 00:00:29,940
SHOTS RINGING OUT IN THE

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,408
HALLWAYS OF THE SCHOOL, HE

16
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:33,877
CHARGED TOWARD THE SUSPECT AND

17
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,545
CONFRONTED HIM HEAD-ON.

18
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:36,546
BECAUSE OF HIS HEROIC ACTIONS,

19
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:38,582
COUNTLESS LIVES WERE SAVED.

20
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:40,183
WE ARE FOREVER INDEBTED TO HIM

21
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,752
FOR HIS SERVICE AND BRAVERY.

22
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:42,953
>> Greg: THE OBVIOUS QUESTION

23
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,821
IS WHY ISN'T THIS ALL OVER THE

24
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,155
NEWS?

25
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,223
SOMEONE ONCE SAID NEWS ISN'T

26
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:47,991
JUST WHAT HAPPENS.

27
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:48,892
IT'S WHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

28
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:50,827
THE PROBLEM IS IN THIS CASE THE

29
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,996
MEDIA ISN'T INTERESTED IN WHAT

30
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:54,398
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

31
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:56,166
LIVES WERE SAVED THANKFULLY SO

32
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,200
THE STORY DIDN'T FIT THE

33
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,834
NARRATIVE.

34
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,904
THE PRESS MOVED ON TO OTHER

35
00:01:00,904 --> 00:01:03,473
NONHAPPENING THINGS LIKE

36
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:03,840
COLLUSION.

37
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,175
OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOOD NEWS THAT

38
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:05,809
THIS WASN'T A BIG STORY.

39
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,744
BUT IT'S ALSO BAD NEWS THAT IT

40
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,946
ISN'T A BIG STORY FOR ITS OWN

41
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,149
SAKE BECAUSE IN THIS NONNEWS

42
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,950
STORY, TRUTH IS REVEALED.

43
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,686
ONE CAN SAVE LIVES BY PROTECTING

44
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:17,020
PEOPLE.

45
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,922
FOR THE DURATION OF A GUN ATTACK

46
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,190
IS ALWAYS DICTATED FOR THE

47
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,125
ARRIVAL OF THE SECOND GUN.

48
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,494
THIS INCIDENT IS NO EXCEPTION.

49
00:01:24,494 --> 00:01:25,629
LOOK UP THE UNPUBLISHED CDC

50
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:28,632
REPORT THAT INDICATES NEARLY

51
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:29,332
2.5 MILLION DEFENSIVE USES OF

52
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:31,134
GUNS A YEAR.

53
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,103
DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THAT EITHER?

54
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,938
I DID SAY IT WAS UNPUBLISHED.

55
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:35,505
I WONDER WHY.

56
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,808
IT'S THE WAY THE PRESS USES

57
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:39,743
SILENCE SELECTIVELY TO CREATE

58
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,411
ONLY ONE STORY ANGLE THAT

59
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,046
CARRIES THE SEAL OF MEDIA

60
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:43,413
APPROVAL.

61
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:44,548
WHICH IS WHY I DID THIS

62
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:45,549
MONOLOGUE IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS

63
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:46,716
SOMEONE MIGHT HEAR IT AND YOU

64
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:50,887
KNOW THE NAME OF MARK DALLAS.

65
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,555
K.G., MARK DALLAS WAS THE

66
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:52,055
OFFICER.

67
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:54,524
I FIND IT INTERESTING THE MEDIA

68
00:01:54,524 --> 00:01:57,828
IS INTERESTED IN GUN STORIES

69
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:58,361
EXCEPT FOR THESE.

70
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,630
>> Kimberly: THEY ARE NOT

71
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,465
INTERESTED IN WHERE GUNS SAVE

72
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:03,633
LIVES AND ARE USED TO PUT DOWN

73
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,236
SOMEBODY THAT IN FACT WAS TRYING

74
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:06,903
TO DO HARM.

75
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:09,506
I LIKE THE WAY YOU ENDED IT.

76
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,006
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

77
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,909
TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE

78
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,311
INDIVIDUAL THAT COMMITTED A

79
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,912
HEROIC ACT AND SAVED LIVES AND

80
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:16,646
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

81
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,115
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS AND

82
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:20,917
GUN FREE ZONES AND THINGS LIKE

83
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,352
THAT BETTER VERY, VERY

84
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,287
VULNERABLE, SOFT TARGETS, THINK

85
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:25,722
ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER.

86
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:27,524
I HAVE RESPONDED TO SCENES OF

87
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,758
THEIR CRIME.

88
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:29,759
OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING TEAM.

89
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,694
ANY TIME THERE WAS A DISCHARGE

90
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:32,362
OF A WEAPON OR SHOOTING LIKE

91
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,129
THAT, THE POLICE HAVE TO GO OUT

92
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,530
ON IT.

93
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,932
YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

94
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,334
YOU GO TO THE SCHOOL AND YOU GO

95
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,736
TO THESE PLACES AND SAY IF ONLY

96
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:40,470
SOMEONE HAD BEEN ARMED THEY ARE

97
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,206
TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING AND

98
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:45,442
ACT DECISIVELY, LIVES COULD BE

99
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:48,111
SAVED.

100
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:49,513
WEAPONS ARE USED IN MANY

101
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:51,648
INSTANCES AND WARS TO CREATE

102
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:52,716
PEACE ULTIMATELY.

103
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,017
>> Greg: THE LEFT USES EVERY

104
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:55,218
STORY IS SOME KIND OF POLITICAL

105
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,087
TOOL.

106
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,788
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT IS AN

107
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,190
ARGUMENT FOR MORE GUNS IN

108
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,825
SCHOOLS WE DON'T REALLY HEAR

109
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:02,125
THAT.

110
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,627
>> Dana: PART OF THE REASON IS

111
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:04,127
BECAUSE IT WORKS.

112
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,162
THE PROCESS THAT WAS IN PLACE

113
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,163
FOR THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT WORKED.

114
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,132
IF THE POLICY WORKS, YOU OFTEN

115
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,133
DON'T WRITE ABOUT IT.

116
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,635
BUT I ALSO THINK IN SOME WAYS

117
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:15,338
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

118
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:16,239
REMEMBER WHEN RAHM EMANUEL SAID

119
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,807
NEVER LET AN OPPORTUNITY GO TO

120
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:18,108
WASTE.

121
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:18,942
IT'S TRUE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

122
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,277
IF YOU ARE A LOCAL SCHOOL

123
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:21,344
DISTRICT AND WORRIED ABOUT THE

124
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,914
POSSIBILITY OF A SHOOTER IN YOUR

125
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,348
SCHOOL, HAVING AN ARMED RESOURCE

126
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,450
OFFICER COULD ACTUALLY BE YOUR

127
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,752
ANSWER.

128
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,120
>> Greg: JESSE, SHOULD THE

129
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,555
OFFICER NOT HAVE BEEN THERE WITH

130
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:31,922
A GUN?

131
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:34,558
SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN A GUN FREE

132
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:34,858
ZONE?

133
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:36,426
>> Jesse: THIS OFFICER TO THE

134
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:37,827
EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE

135
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:38,995
OFFICER DID IN PARKLAND.

136
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,931
HE WAITED OUTSIDE.

137
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,265
THIS ONE FOLLOWED PROTOCOL AND

138
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,166
DIRECTLY ADDRESS TO NEUTRALIZE

139
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,568
THE SHOOTER.

140
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:46,369
YOUR POINT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

141
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,037
NEWS ISN'T NECESSARILY ABOUT

142
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:47,771
WHAT YOU COVER.

143
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,173
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T COVER

144
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:51,508
AND YOUR ASTEROID ANALOGY RINGS

145
00:03:51,508 --> 00:03:52,776
TRUE HERE.

146
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,277
THEY DON'T ALWAYS COVER GOOD

147
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,745
ECONOMIC NEWS FOR THE TRUMP

148
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:56,212
ADMINISTRATION.

149
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,782
THEY DON'T COVER NEWS THAT MIGHT

150
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,350
BENEFIT THE NRA NARRATIVE, AND

151
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,184
THAT'S FINE.

152
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,786
EVERY OUTLET HAS TO MAKE THEIR

153
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:03,753
OWN EDITORIAL DECISION ABOUT

154
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,789
WHAT THEY DO OR DON'T COVER BUT

155
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:08,825
WHEN 90% OF THE MEDIA IS LIBERAL

156
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,961
AND 10% ISN'T, THERE IS A LOT OF

157
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,729
IMPACT ABOUT WHAT THAT

158
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:13,964
90 PERCENT DOES NOT COVER.

159
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:15,432
IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO THE

160
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,466
READERS AND VIEWERS WHO AREN'T

161
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,668
FULLY INFORMED BEFORE THEY CAN

162
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,536
MAKE A DECISION OR HAVE AN

163
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:20,870
OPINION.

164
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,340
>> Greg: JUAN, I AM SURE MY

165
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,374
MONOLOGUE CHANGED YOUR MIND

166
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:24,774
COMPLETELY.

167
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:26,409
>> Juan: IT FELT TO ME LIKE

168
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:29,512
SOMEONE HAD A GUN POINTED AT ME.

169
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:32,248
>> Greg: YOU HAVE FELT THAT

170
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:32,582
BEFORE.

171
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,984
>> Juan: WHAT'S INTERESTING TO

172
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,185
ME IS NOT THAT IT DOESN'T GET

173
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:35,952
COVERED.

174
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:36,953
YOU ARE RIGHT.

175
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,588
IT'S LIKE THE FAMOUS SAYING, WE

176
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,190
DON'T COVER SAFE LANDINGS AND

177
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:40,957
NATIONAL AIRPORTS.

178
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:42,125
IT'S NOT TYPICALLY WHAT GETS

179
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,525
COVERED.

180
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:45,161
BUT YOU MAKE IT INTO A POLICY

181
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,162
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

182
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,331
GUNS SHOULD BE IN SCHOOLS AND

183
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,132
CLASSROOMS ALL OVER.

184
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:51,568
THAT'S WHERE I THINK I DISENGAGE

185
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,937
BECAUSE TO MY MIND, I LOOK AT

186
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,940
STONEMAN, THERE WAS AN ARMED

187
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,341
GUARD.

188
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,542
COLUMBINE, VIRGINIA TECH, PULSE

189
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,076
NIGHTCLUB.

190
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:03,847
THERE WERE ARMED GUARDS AT THESE

191
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:04,714
MASS SHOOTINGS.

192
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,616
DID IT STOP THEM?

193
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:06,883
NO.

194
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:09,452
LET'S GET AWAY FROM A BUNCH OF

195
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,553
TV PEOPLE.

196
00:05:10,553 --> 00:05:12,155
LET'S ASK THE TEACHERS IN THESE

197
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:12,489
SCHOOLS.

198
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:13,723
DO THEY THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE

199
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,358
GUNS, THERE SHOULD BE ARMED

200
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:15,692
GUARDS?

201
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:16,126
NO.

202
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:17,927
WHAT ABOUT THE PARENTS?

203
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,329
PARENTS LOVE KIDS, I THINK WE

204
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,730
CAN ALL AGREE WITH THAT.

205
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,398
PARENTS SAY THEY DON'T WANT

206
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:22,599
THESE GUNS IN THEIR SCHOOLS.

207
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:23,967
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN

208
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,302
GUNS ARE AROUND, MORE ACCIDENTS,

209
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,505
MORE FATALITIES.

210
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,707
>> Greg: I'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.

211
00:05:30,707 --> 00:00:00,000
MORE GUNS, LESS CRIME.
