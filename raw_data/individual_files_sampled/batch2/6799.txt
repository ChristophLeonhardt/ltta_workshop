okay welcome to Salt Lake City Utah my name is Mike Mineta I'm the National Director for Wolfpack we are a nonpartisan organization fighting for a 20th amendment to deal with the massive amount of money a lot of times dark money pouring into our elections in this country and we are at the second annual Wolfpack warrior workshop and we have people in this room from all over the country from Alaska to Florida who have flown themselves here and paid for this entire weekend taking their summer vacations to be here and learn how to to fight for this amendment that we need that is essentially going to give us a government back that is responsive to the will of the people now we wanted to do this discussion here today at this workshop because one of the biggest problems that we have in this country right now we have a lot of them but one of the biggest ones is clearly the partisan divide that we have it is I think palpable we all feel it and whether it's Thanksgiving dinner or on social media or certainly at state houses you know Wolfpack volunteers in this room I can tell you firsthand we know when we go we talked to Democrats who are afraid of Republicans afraid of the other side don't even want to have a conversation about anything just simply because they're on the other side of the political aisle same thing with Republicans terrified of Democrats and their and their stance on uncertain issues so we just feel you know part of if we're going to succeed we're going to restore this country to what it can be we've got to be able to have this conversation we got to figure out what is it that that is dividing us and where can we find common ground which is really the main point of this conversation which I think we'll get to towards the end but first I just wanted to introduce these two extraordinary gentlemen with me first John putner he is the executive director of take back our republic and also known for jump-starting the historic campaign of Dave brat who unseated Eric Cantor who is the US House Majority at leader at the time first time in American history that has ever happened so John putner and I just say a non-partisan reaction it doesn't necessarily mean tepid and of course doesn't need an introduction from for a lot of people in the room but we have the host and founder of the largest online news show in the world The Young Turks also founder of Wolfpack justice Democrats and the lists of accomplishments goes on and just a true a true fighter for this in this movement Jenna cougar so before we get into all the you know what divides us and everything we just want to start like we do where we have been doing throughout the whole weekend is just getting to to know people on a personal level first so John why don't you just tell us a little bit about your your background your upbringing and who you are I will and I'll tell you this ties into what a conservative is because there are few different types of conservatives I know when you're in one ideology you think the other side's all one thing but I grew up the oldest of nine children Richmond Virginia social conservatives are your first category generally four family has nine children they're pretty pro-life and a couple other things so that is one group went to an all guys Catholic military high school military's usually the second of three and John Boyd was mentioned here earlier our viewers won't know this but John Boyd was the perfect in our mind conservative military approach we want a strong military but that doesn't mean we're trying to over pay a defense industry that gives secret does bids making secret contributions through the Chamber of Commerce so you can see the difference there in a military conservative approach versus people making money on the system and finally there's your economic conservative your real economic conservative is not the Chamber of Commerce that we used to fight in primaries as much as you used to fight yeah in general elections for a lot of you in this room that was the 500 newspapers I delivered every morning and my family's below the poverty line I went out and started delivering papers and that was real capitalism I wish we still had paper outs I think I just lost everyone under 30 who don't know what a paper route is but it was important you did wonderful ok well maybe the cut offs a little higher I say these because these were intricate to my upbringing they were real conservatives so when you say conservatives are against us there are people who just make money through being their ideology and it's nothing to do with the ideology those are the three cornerstones I grew up with and for me that's real conservatism and there is common ground on a lot of money in politics issues with true conservatives from any of those buckets alright drink how about you yeah bringing okay first of all can I just you know I said it before we got started but let me give credit to a couple people in the room first of all the job partner for showing up here and and for actually being a true conservative because there's a lot of people that get paid to do certain things right and and they've lost sight of what conservatives were in this country and and as I'll tell you in a second about myself I was a Republican growing up secondly I want to thank all the people in this packed room you guys are amazing from 41 different states all volunteers that means you put your heart and soul into this thing the only reason you're here and all the hard work you've done across the country is because you care you care about the country and you care about our democracy so thank you guys so in terms of myself we we grew up in New Jersey and and my dad as a small business owner and so we grew up Republican thinking over regulation so my family's originally from Turkey so we like that the elevators of my buildings in my dad's building were inspected because we don't want it to fall down but we didn't like that they were inspected six times a year we're like okay we got it hey they're functioning let's move on right and so we were liberal Republicans which basically doesn't exist anymore in the country that means socially liberal fiscally conservative I would argue that I'm still fiscally conservative and and I talk about it on the show all the time I just don't think that the Republican Party's there so John and I have have real differences and we have real areas of agreement to me what a progressive is and why I started calling myself that is it's two central planks one is expanding the circle of Liberty so Martin Luther King jr. to me is the ultimate progressive so it's it's not a bad thing that white people in this country had all these wonderful rights that's a great thing okay wouldn't it be great if blacks could also have it right and and before that women and the list goes on and on and so progressives throughout American history and I would argue including the founding fathers have fought against the establishment to expand the circle of Liberty and lately one of the good examples of that is civil rights for the LGBT community so and that's why I'm proud I'm a to be a progressive I'm proud to be an American because to me those are very synonymous and then the second part of it is about equality of opportunity so you know sometimes there's caricatures from the write about how progressives or liberals want equality of results and there might be a couple people out there that are you for that but they are very very rare almost all the progresses I work for they just looking for one thing a fair shot a fair shot at the American dream so whether it's higher wages for the average American worker healthcare for their families or any almost most importantly in the context of all those policy issues college for all it doesn't get as much coverage but that's the American dream my dad got had an opportunity to get free college education when he was in Turkey of all places and he was a dirt-poor olive farmer in the middle of southeastern Turkey and if he had not gotten that free college education I would today be a dirt-poor olive farmer in the middle of southeastern Turkey and I know what some on the right are thinking at homes damn it but to me again the same theme it's what makes America great and it's what makes pres abysm great so wouldn't it be fantastic we can get back into arguments over conservatives versus progressives as opposed to who has more money and who doesn't all right so what do you think John somehow how do you think people are identified as conservatives right now in this country what do you think are some of the things that sure tribute to that conservatism well you know unfortunately gotten to where it's enough some zero right now where everyone just feels like we're Republican conservative or we're Democrat liberal and you know there's just that dividing line and unfortunately most arguments start with well who's who's on my side is okay to be on this issue because someone I like or don't like is on one side of it and we got to break that down because I want you to look at the end result of what money in politics does to people to the average person we had some great emotional testimony in practice yesterday and it was phenomenal let me give you an example the absurdity of the system now the president of China flies to the US at the same time the son of the vice president United States flies to China to meet with an investment firm they start conversations going the net result very shortly thereafter is 1.5 billion dollars for the son of the vice president's investment firm which is pretty new and unproven and unlike almost every other investment firm in the world that locates in New York cuz that's where the money is is located in DC the Chinese investment firm on their Chinese page brags about having the son of the vice president there working on a deal and they don't put it on their English page 1.5 billion that happened in 2009 is Joe Biden in his son now you can pick printing examples on the right to but any conservative that thinks it's okay to have the Chinese paper vice-president at the beginning of eight years of him being vice president and look you can have a fair argument over the current trade discussion I mean I do think Trump has an argument with we don't want our aluminum still to crumble many conservatives disagree with me and others but there's an argument there people did go back to work now you can argue ramifications on farms I mean it's a whole longer debate all I'm saying is if you've already kind of bought off the number-two guy in the country he's not going to consider the debate to doing anything to the Chinese that would not let them dump all our luminance steel on us again it might be that that's the right conclusion we might argue with that but for me for a real conservative you've got to realize the big money moves around on both sides and you're being sold a bill of goods to think well this is just sort of in our advantage you know they're more rich conservatives or Republicans so they get more money so that's where we've got to draw a line and be ideologically sound all right so just I'm gonna put this into this perspective of Wolfpack and what we're trying to do here and for anyone who might not know we are pursuing this amendment this that we'll deal with this issue of the massive amounts of money that are pouring into our elections and give us a free and fair election system we're doing it through the state-based convention route there are only two ways to amend the US Constitution we feel that Congress is just not capable and you know one of the things that we run into is like I was saying earlier Democrats who have a genuine fear John of someone like yourself because you're in the other party you identify as a conservative so do you have any idea like why like do you have is there anything that that stands out for any of the issues that that why someone would be afraid on the other side well I think the shoes are on you know I think on your specific issue of course people worried about things that can really make change in article 5 would make change I mean that's one way to get to this and and so there's certainly people on both sides and we have Wars and conservative circles over article 5 for other things for a balanced budget for term limits whatever I think you've got to say is there a problem so big right now that we really need changes and I think the answer is going to be yes at this point for 80% of people I mean if things were kind of going along fine yeah I'd say well do we really want to risk a bunch of people being elected and making potential changes but when you see the kind of pay-for-play system we have and again there's plenty of believing I go for Koch brothers and everyone else so I'm an equal opportunity offender but you know the one executive order we actually wanted President Obama to and we even had people from eight states from take back our public go up was the one saying that if you're bidding on government contracts you have to reveal that you're giving political money I mean it's an absurd business model to put ten million in and get a thirty billion dollar government contract I don't care if that's defense or if that's some more socially liberal friendly issued it doesn't matter you've got to reveal that and that was the one he wouldn't sign and I actually didn't like a couple hundred others that he did but so so we're looking so we're at a point where I just don't think the politicians are gonna do it and whether or not you have or have an article five convention it could be it's a means to an end it's sometimes the politicians get scared the people are going to do this without us we just have this in Alaska got some real good concessions from the legislature on campaign finance reform because they're about to face a referenda to make them do it a view article five and amendment twenty eight these are all means the end for us there are no article files clearly not our only issue it's one of several it or means right so I'm gonna ask you the same question but first I'm just curious what why did you organize as a Republican in college well what initially made you go to that level you weren't just a conservative you actually organized on college campuses yeah so many things to say I want to address some of what John said to so but to your question Mike there's a whole host of issues so there was a regulation of small business that I talked about they were I want to believe in balancing budgets I still do I don't believe that it should be enforced through an amendment so we would disagree there probably but I don't agree with Dick Cheney or Paul Krugman who say the deficits don't matter I think they do and I still believe that to this day and and when George HW Bush launched Persian Gulf War I even did a pro-war rally because I what I loved about that's this is a hilarious scent is coming out of a progressive mountain but what I loved about that war was the principle that is much maligned now on both sides which is a new world order because people put ghouls and goblins into that that they imagined but what George HW Bush said was new world order means you not attack a sovereign country that has not attacked you and so that is why we took Iraq out of Kuwait but that is also why we did not go into Iraq and so when his son came into office and said now we're going to violate that I'm I just kept screaming into the ether and eventually radio and then online isn't anybody going to notice that their two policies are diametrically opposed how can you call yourself a Republican and be for both foreign policies that are 180 degrees different from each other it makes no sense so now you don't want to get into a you know now how progressive I am today you know when you realize that there's a lot of and and so I both want to debate here and agree and etc and so I don't know how much of this will offend you or not John but I'm gonna let it rip here okay so because look and some people ask hey Jake you found a Wolfpack aren't you a progressive god damn right I am okay so I don't shy away from that and we never hit the ball there's a lot of organizations on the right and the left that hide the ball we've been honest from day one of course we forget I'm progressive Young Turks is progressive but Wolfpack is truly nonpartisan because and that's why John is here that's why we work with Republicans all across the country the reason is you can't get an amendment unless both sides agree it is super hard you need three quarters of the states to ratify and in this case is the one issue we all have agreement on that our voters I mean the politicians are totally different the leaders of a lot of the groups are different but but the people agree we hate to pay for play we can't stand that they robbed our democracy from us right and we want to get it back but look in terms of the Republican Party you know I was out at George W Bush first of all he was the opposite of his dad second of all I watched the debates he wasn't bright he just I'm I didn't want to vote for a president that dumb but little did I know what we would get so I mean it just kept getting worse and worse I felt like the Republican Party was like one of those photocopies and you photocopy the photocopy and it just deteriorates I thought the end of the deterioration was when they started doing torture under Cheney and Bush but it turns out nope that wasn't the end and it just kept getting worse so I don't know why people stay Republicans I really don't they never balanced the budget it was all a lie the Regan made him worse HW at least that's why I keep giving him so much credit because at least he was a man of principle and he tried and which cost him his political career george w bush made the deficits way worse trump has now made them monstrously worse it's just one of Democrats in office that they yell at him so that he won't spend money to stimulate the economy so I just feel like a lot of what they claimed they were for turned out to be a lie but just a clarification we did go from ten to twenty trillion during Obama's eight years so I agree with you Republicans haven't addressed the deficit but that's a hard figure to justify no no I can totally just fine let me do explain why not because I think Obama did the right things or the debts of those are good numbers but we have to look at a context and Bush was handed about a five hundred billion dollar surplus when he got an office by Bill Clinton and Clinton in a lot of things wrong but he did steward of the economy and the budget was in arguably a good one handing over a surplus is unheard of in my lifetime and what did bush do he's like thank you very much I'll turn that into wars and tax cuts for the rich and handed Obama 1.2 trillion dollar deficit so Obama brought that down the six hundred billion dollars I wish we could have done more but those kept piling up through those eight years and that is bush's deficit that was piling up yeah we're just point out though that the internet was invented by Al Gore during Clinton's years so that didn't help and you did it wasn't until the Republican Congress held Clinton's feet to the fire so I actually think a balance was very nice on the deficit as far as just deficit forget every other ideological issue but I also I have heard it's interesting now that every Obama had was due to Bush's years and now I'm starting to see the narrative that everything that's going well in the economy during Trump ears just cousin what Obama sets up and if we're gonna go with this theory every president should be judged on the previous president through all history and I'm not sure that really makes sense so you're making some valid points there but I think that's a tough argument to keep up and if Trump's gonna get no credit for the economy doing pretty well so frightened listen it may all collapse I'm not one who's saying I think everything's smooth and gonna be great these kind of deficits at some point the piper is gonna be called on all of us and it may be whoever sitting in office gets blamed for the next depression I don't know so I'm not predicting the future but you know as of now I think I think there's an argument both ways on these yeah see now we're having fun we're doing moving so you know it's getting good when the moderator doesn't get a chance together so look context matters so and and what we're trying to do here is have a real conversation that's fair so on the one hand yeah Obama handed a Trump a wonderful economy in terms of employment numbers stock market etc and Trump has continued that so was it Obama definitely the the we've added jobs for 93 straight months on the other hand Trump so far on those metrics has not screwed it up and that is a minor miracle well especially because the New York Times said the night he was winning that the stock market would collapse and never recover yeah we here have the history here of the prediction that the Trump election just would destroy the stock market and that's where I think something deserves go wait a second now you gave us bogus facts and I feel not you this is New York Times and you know it hasn't happened yeah and and so look that's why I'd like to say things ahead of time so if it turns out Trump makes it all the way to four years as president let alone you know state of the economy but he makes it to all four years and and the economy stays the same you know relatively okay I'll get to the major downside in a second stays okay for all those four years then I'll say okay he was a good steward in that respect he was a wildly deranged unstable guy in other respects but hey the facts are facts my guess is that by doing such a giant tax cut and not only does it hurt the the budget but it creates a bubble because they just started doing stock buybacks which artificially inflates the price of your stocks without the companies actually doing any better which sets you up for a bubble which sets you off for a collapse so if Trump does cause a collapse I maybe I don't need you to say this now John and then we you know you are agreements and disagreements are clear but those are you in the audience at home okay if he collapses it can we agree that Democrats do well with Clinton and Obama and then under Bush and Trump they collapsed the economy because he give too much to the rich and that is not good for the economy if that happens so if maybe it won't happen maybe conservatives will be right and at the end of four years I'll say give the devil his due but we'll see so my guess is it is it's artificially inflated but most importantly on this specific topic wages are terribly low and they are terribly low under Trump but they were terribly low under Obama and and that is because the system is rigged and that gets back to the agreement that John and I have which is the reason that the wages are low is not an accident it's the donors give money to the politicians they buy them pretty much wholesale or whole cloth but probably wholesale to and and and so they rigged the rules on their on their behalf so they lower corporate taxes a higher fees and fines on the average American so that's redistributed redistributing both the the money to the top but also the taxes and the fines and the burdens to the bottom and and we might not agree on minimum wage etcetera but all the rules are paid for by powerful wealthy donors and they're not going to pay give all that money the politicians on your behalf they're giving it on their behalf and that's why wages were terribly low under Obama and can continue to be terribly low under Trump's another point of agreement on the deficit so for example the tax reform I wrote one piece for Newsmax the the great the bad and the ugly of the tax formula there was a lot of ugly in there even me would say I agree with some of the tenants but the carried interest loophole now I don't know if Trump selling truther now but he says 23 times we tried to get that out of there no one thinks the current interest loophole is good for anyone except the very tiny percentage of people so the terrible stuff like that at my point there is even before we got to any disagreement we or any of you would have with conservatives and liberals if the real money's already been given away to the lobbyists who are in there marking that up what doesn't really matter who wins the ideological battle the money's already been given away and so before you're talking about should the average person's taxes be lower or should that money go to infrastructure or to education to health care or if the donors have already bought up the lion's share and they have it we're kind of we aren't just arguing over the pittance what's left and we're gonna have the huge deficit so that's an area of agreement I think where you know sometimes it's liberal versus conservative other times it's insiders gaming the system political industrial complex versus the average people and that's where I think everyone's rooms can be on the same page unless there's some secret paid lobbyists you know spying on us you know but that's about it so can we stay with that well I just want to say that this is good they we want to do the disagreement first we can tie it into you know what we agree with later but that's what we're trying to do is find out what is dividing us so much like so I'll let you know you obviously cover politics so you're in it day to day so what is your perspective what do you what is it that is causing this really palpable yeah partisan divide there's a couple of things there but I also want to respond okay all right so this time it's in full agreement the carried interest loophole is a crime and there's no reason why hedge funds and private equity should have that unnatural advantage and have that loophole I thought conservatives are against loopholes I part of the reason I thought that as Donald Trump said over and over during the campaign that he would end that particular loophole and I predicted ahead of time you guys if you watch The Young Turks know I love love doing that I said there is no way in the world that they will take away the carried interest loophole because there's too many lobbyists and way too much money and trumple back down because he doesn't really care he's he is the swamp I mean I think John has a good argument to be made that he's in the swamp training business right and but but in terms of Trump I knew he wouldn't do it here's another perfect bipartisan example both Obama and Trump said during the campaign's that they would negotiate prices with the drug companies for Medicare okay which is that of course of course you should negotiate drug prices what kind of a crazy monopolistic crony capitalist system doesn't negotiate on behalf of the American people and says to the drug companies just charge us anything you like I mean that is government capture 101 and Obama talked a big game he put it into his ads that he would do it differently and then Bush did and what'd he do he didn't negotiate drug prices and for eight years has stayed the same under Obama why the pharmaceutical companies are the number one lobbyists in the country Trump came in huffing and puffing I'm that's outrageous why don't their negotiations right and what happened mr. Artur the deal all of a sudden you got a nice little paycheck from the lobbyists and they and that provision remains to this day both the Democrats and the Republicans are bought and we know who's buying them it's so super obvious it's all these lobbyists that come in with a check if you have private financing of Elections you're gonna have the politicians working for private interests period and obvious and and and so you I don't think you can even argue that and so I would argue in terms of what the fix is you do public financing so they'll work for the public interest they say oh that's a lot of money are you kidding me we can wait trillions of dollars to these goddamn lobbyists right of American taxpayer money that we worked so hard for and so that is a pittance public financing is a pittance compared to the trillions given away in the loopholes etc and if our politicians actually work for us you think that they would be like wait no I have a constituency of about you know three dozen people in New York who are the wealthiest people in New York and in the whole country in the whole world and I really gotta look out for their interests no you only do that if you're corrupt and the whole system is based on corruption so I can go on and on I wanted to address a couple other things but I already forgot you sorry what was okay answer mine now I just want to get to the heart of what do you think it's coming from this this oh we need to devise a partisan divide so that's a multi-faceted answer because some of it is real we don't agree on abortion we just don't right and and if there's not if there is there is still Republicans out there who don't agree that that for on marriage equality for example we don't agree so let's fight great that's what a democracy is for and we're not supposed to agree we're not supposed to all agree and and time changes and and sometimes the country is more liberal sometimes it's more conservative that's natural that's good that's healthy debate and we might get real passionate about and I do I I'm for gun control and so I mean if you've ever seen my videos on that I am super passionate about that and people who are for gun rights are super passionate about that issue on the opposite side good it's called America that's fine okay but there's another reason why we're divided is because people pay for that divide so whether it's media and media takes a lot of forms obviously one of the companies I've got issues with is Fox News but also Regnery publishing to print a propaganda of any right winger who will do the bidding of the wealthy you write a book telling the America how great it is to to have own yachts and cetera that will artificially get bought by rich conservatives so that'll go up to the top of the New York Times bestseller list and so then they could bully the rest of the media into covering it like actual human beings agree on it there's just a whole giant scam meant to assure to push a not right wing propaganda because that's not fair because real conservatives don't necessarily agree with those positions but the propaganda for the rich and for the rich of the rich by the rich right and so that serves to divide us but now the most important thing is the politicians and it drives me crazy that the media is not aware of the most important and salient fact in Washington which is they do the bidding of their donors period stop having fake conversations about whether they could convince one another so during the Obama years they'd yell at them and say you should do a beer summit there ain't no amount of beer in this country that's gonna get Mitch McConnell to agree with Obama on something his donors don't want them to agree on okay we've tried no no so the idea of the beer summits are preposterous because McConnell's paid to say something and to be fair and honest Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are paid to believe something and so they're not going to do it I'm a look at the corruption of the DNC right now just what was it yesterday they said oh we're not gonna take money from fossil fuel companies and lobbyists because our constituents don't want that and then yesterday they come out and go just kidding we're still corrupt we're gonna take that money and and along with that you know what every American knows doesn't matter if you're liberal or conservative you know the string that comes with that you will shut up and you will do exactly what the oil companies tell you to do and yesterday Tom Perez the head of the DNC said yes sir may I have another sir so that's the state of this country now yeah unfortunately yeah and I would add what you're doing is so central to what fixes this people don't realize the connections so much of the bitterness is because of the secret funding of third party ads the LLC's this unlimited money because when we used to run campaigns we have to put our candidates name on it and you didn't get that shrill because your candidate had to look at that commercial and go do I know you said I need to hit them but is this fact base is this you know is this legitimate do I sound shrill well when you form a group LLC and only getting all the tech buyer s turns but all the ways you hide money and you go in and just try to destroy a candidate and then your little group is leaving the day after the people who love Salt Lake City it didn't really exist is gone there's no accountability and what happens this happens a million times so your average person gets these kind of demonic images of the candidates running and so you know the candidates are such a great problem but it's also just this third party and you can get into of course Russians meddling and everything else but some of this is just yeah the way we're set up so unless we have real campaign finance reform that says things like well no you really need to give much money back to candidates or even even to parties would be better because you can at least hold a party accountable as opposed to whoever the oil industry or anyone else is funding and so the reform will actually lower the temperature so much the hatred Americans have for each other where it's not just hey we happen to disagree no this person is evil I mean you can hit pizza gate on as far as a right-wing conspiracy or or you know stuff that comes out on the left but somehow I was just just not true and you're painting you know some of these people had to be nasty and the problem is once that's the process well who wants to run for office well your your good little echt official is no longer getting in the race and to James point so the person who survives that is someone who doesn't mind being trashed in front of his family for all his neighbors and and so you can see how the cycle just runs and you get lower and lower so that's gonna lower the temperature and that's why what you're doing every time someone says well your issues not my issue your issue won't be solved unless you get my issue which is campaign finance form other democracy issues until we have a functioning government I don't care what your issue is I don't mind losing a grass roots battle when a bunch of my friends knocked on doors for Obama and they said they kept running into people from the next street because they were all knocking I'm like man I don't agree with him but this was a great democratic uprising they ran over as this was real democracy in action shoot I'm in for a tough eight years cuz it's gonna be on some of my issues but I can take that but when I had Dave brat calling his closest friends I'm saying hey there's no way I can give I might lose this yokas Cantor's about to be speaker that's the corruption we're talking about I'm not even talking about anything illegal about Eric Cantor goes in as a congressman worth one or two million dollars and by the time we beat him he's worth 13 million I mean do the math on a congressional salary that doesn't work it works by your wife being at Goldman Sachs and you getting information and lobbyists paying you so this is the whole system so you're at the core I know a lot of these issues you might be upset about well what does that do if campaign finance no this is the means to the end yeah it's just again I couldn't agree more to go back to the beer summit I mean how does the mainstream media really think that if Obama has a nice round of golf with Mitch McConnell or John Boehner back in the day but they're gonna go you know I hadn't thought of it that way you're right uh you know we'll we'll negotiate on you know you name it health care or whatever no they're gonna fight tooth and nail against that health care reform because they get paid by the health care lobby it's a preposterous thing to think that they that they're having real debates and isn't that incredibly sad you know and so you got McConnell on that side that I point out is an example on our side they asked Nancy Pelosi why shouldn't you be Speaker of the House she says because I raise the most amount of money well I mean that's just basically raising your hand and saying I am the most institutionally corrupt and so that's why you should give me the money and and and they don't even see they're so blinded by this system that they brag about it like oh I I told this guy I do his bidding I do told the other one and company I do their bidding then when you when Nancy Pelosi and and and Paul Ryan or Eric Cantor get in a room of course they're not going to agree because they literally got paid to disagree unless of the worst case scenario is in this corrupt system if they get in the room and agree because that means we're gonna get robbed okay that means the same set of donors bribed them both and legally unfortunately in this insane system and that situation but look there are positive examples Dave brat back in the day you know his record now is a whole different story if you ask me that'll get back into our disagreements but when he ran that campaign he ran it as a populist he and you guys ran it against the bankers you ran it against the corruption and it was it was a thing to behold it was if I could argued beautiful it was great and so I don't as you can tell I don't agree with a lot of David Pratt's positions but the campaign itself was exactly right and it was a conservative uprising against that corruption and I believe that it conservatives had to be fair to them are might be even more upset about the corruption than liberals are in this country and so that's that's great that's them being patriots and on our side you know Mike pointed out that we started just Democrats and Nicasio Cortes took down Crowley the number four Democrat in the House Justice Democrats asked her to run out of you know because we thought she was an amazing community leader had never run in politics before not corrupted never took the lobbyist money not taking it today even though she's already won no corporate PAC money and and believe me that many she wins all of a sudden they're all at her doorstep and it's and you can run on corrupted campaigns on the right and the left and you can win but we all got to do it together we got to do it as soon as possible so that we can get this our free and fair elections back otherwise the lobbyists come pouring back in and we get washed out in that tidal wave of money okay so I guess we can transition a little bit to you know what we're talking about here as far as this amendment in our Avenue John take back a republic did a poll about a month ago you in veiled it at the American promise conference a few weeks ago we and and you asked you know what is a solution you know to this problem our Kent are broken campaign finance system the article five convention came back as the number one option right yes why do you think it came back sure we gave four options to schedule setup we said leave things exactly how they are you can basically do the South Dakota model where you can buy secret gifts for a legislator and then bid on road projects I mean that's what Koch brothers advocate they're what we fought against so that's one that got 2% so if there is a narrow narrow group for that second one was basically leave citizens united in place but work on transparency I mean there are things we can do immediately that you don't have to wait for and about 17% pick bat which leaves you at 19% that basically wants citizens united left in place just those two together then the other two options were amendment 28 article 5 an article 5 was over 40% as a top choice and it was interesting we did this both ways we did a scientific poll through I citizen out of Tennessee is very good and we got those results I also wrote a Newsmax piece a pretty conservative audience and we did an opt-in which isn't scientific but does show the passion behind an issue and interestingly the only difference in that one is well over 50% in response to my news max article picked article 5 as their top choice so I don't know why right now there was more intensity for that than 20th minute but let me say now there was probably broader support for 28th amendment I think like you know 60% won an article 5 on this maybe 68% so you know when you just got down to yes or no but it was the number one option for people and maybe the bigger figure though is 81% wanted a change would not accept citizens united and that cut across again rank-and-file conservatives liberal there you you don't see that much difference yeah I mean just a reminder Hillary spent a billion Trump spent half a billion a lot of conservative you see a little uptick and conservative support for campaign finance I think that's when some of the rank-and-file said oh maybe this isn't just rigged in our favor - maybe maybe we should be at least thinking you know opposing some of this just outright election buying that we're having now okay let me just stay on that for a minute you know what some of the pushback that we get when we're talking to Republicans a lot of time in state state houses is you know the idea that we if we limit spending in elections it's going to infringe upon the the First Amendment so do you believe that and annually don't know we've never really discussed that so where do you come down on that do you do you think it is or do think there's other ways to fix this without limiting spending or what is your solution I guess no I actually did a Daily Caller piece on this and I think it's an absurd argument I buy the first part of the argument you can say political money of speech I'm ok with that first step but the part that's impossible to go to is therefore giving can be unlimited you can't put a restriction speech isn't unlimited I mean we start in high school being told you can't yell fire in a crowded theater and this concept that a billionaire doesn't have free speech if they can't give another billion into campaigns is absurd of course you can put limits on and I'm all for a state-by-state approach I'd like to state louder if a state finds trick we need complete transparency Mitt Romney's proposed this but no limit I'm ok if it's a real democratic process but if you're the state like Montana or some places you know you've had corruption you know you've had money coming in buying politicians and you put limits on it is absurd to not only go citizens united but now go into those states and saying because the citizens united you also cannot even put your state limits on and that's where I think there's a real conservative argument because think about it the argument to do that is a judicial activism argument the Supreme Court is going to throw out say Louisiana's limits that they have now that's been proposed only two judges signed off so for concern say wait you want judicial activism to make every state go by no limits no transparency whatever and then there's also these states rights issue I mean most conservatives think the state should have some ability themselves and they're one of the 50 laboratories so this is an issue where I think you really connect with a lot of grassroots if you can frame it as issue activism versus states rights yeah I mean one of the things that we point out is the Montana example because I think it's easy to forget or apparently apparently it's easy to forget we have these conversations that we had common sense laws in some of our states for a long time Montana over a hundred years common sense laws that some of these Supreme Court cases have wiped out but those those didn't affect the First Amendment nobody was talking about that you know this is almost an arguments but made up but I just generally didn't know how you felt about that so yes yeah thank you for that thank you for that answer so Jake I'm gonna ask you because another pushback that we get sometimes from those same Republicans is you know hey Wolfpack is founded by Jane Cougar you know I've seen some of those videos he doesn't like Republicans very much oh we hear and he's clearly funded by George Soros oh I I need to ask you how much money have you taken from him he's just clear the air on that yes okay it's a fair question so let me let me level with you guys here's how much Young Turks is taken from George Soros $0.00 okay here's how much Wolf Pack is Higgins $0.00 now the whole point of Wolf Pack is to get all the money out of politics so why would George Soros cubed R Wolf Pack so why would Bloomberg get a wolf pack it doesn't make any sense they put money in maybe they get sick of it I don't know but in terms of how much they have to give to keep up but but no our whole point is to get all the money out of politics and every once in a while Republicans who think they're putting me on the spot by saying oh yeah would you take Soros money out of course I would of course I would would you take Union money out yes I would because I look I think unions serve an incredibly important role if you don't have organized labor and you can't do collective bargaining you're going to be screwed they're gonna pick you off one by one I believe in unions but that being said I don't believe that unions have any more rights than anyone else to unduly influence our elections by writing checks to politicians if I don't think corporations should be able to do it I don't think unions should be able to do it and unfortunately some of our Union brothers and sisters think that it's a smart idea to write those checks and to maintain this system I don't know if they've got the memo their corporations have more money than they do yeah so it is very very short-sighted of them so no it's a it's a myth and I'll tell you where it comes from just to be totally transparent and tell you the whole story and that's why as I sit here and John and I agree it still does feel a little weird because as you say you write for Newsmax I'd create I know you say Daily Caller I cringe even more I write some for Breitbart and by the way I guarantee you that there will be a good number of people in a contingent and they're trolls and BOTS as well that say CJ how dare you sit across from John putner who writes from Breitbart and say bad things about Nancy Pelosi I got a D on my helmet and that's you know you can't do that you're not allowed to do that but no our job is to be honest it's to be honest so all the things that Nancy Pelosi pushes for Bab no I agree with a lot of it okay but is the system that she excels in wrong yes it's wrong it's wrong I don't care if it's Pelosi taking the money or McConnell taking money so in terms of the full story because it's actually Daily Caller that partly puts out the propaganda and the false stories about this is that they say Oh George Soros gave money the media consortium and Young Turks is part of the media consortium so they must be funding the Young Turks only for we're so right so we get no funding at all Oh in terms of our subscribers on The Young Turks it's all regular folks just like Wolf Pack giving ten bucks five bucks a month and that's it so we have investors and what they're interested in is profit because it turns out we live in capitalism okay hey and so those guys are looking for a return on their investment and that's it but Soros is not among them the media consortium bless their hearts it was an effort by progressive media to get together and work together and unsurprisingly it didn't succeed okay progressive media is not very well organized and terribly funded so I have no idea of Soros ever put the media consortium in the first place if he did it was a pittance because they have they're down to one staffer I think and I'm pretty much on the ropes of their existence we have not done anything to work with them in a couple of years I wish we did more but did we get any money from the media consortium not a dime we actually paid dues into the media consortium so if it was true the Soros gave the money in the first place maybe we're funding Soros I don't know I'd make us the only people in the country no seriously it's just not remotely true I think it helps people obfuscate the issue on purpose hey they sound like they're honest actors they're progressives but they really do speak out against the Democratic Party's corruption so how am I going to ruin that I'm gonna plant a lie that they're secretly working for Soros and got money we never have and and if we could we take all the Soros and Koch brothers money out of the system for good right now that's the whole point all right John let me ask you do you support an amendment I guess I don't really know your stance on that I mean what's your ideal solution to this to this problem with money influencing you yeah these are all means to an end we feel like they're both a means to an end and their potential pressure to the end so again an article five convention we're on record supporting that for money in politics not we don't get actually get involved the other conservative article five things mister it's not part of our purview one right balanced budget and all twentieth amendment we do we also there are third things but we also want to do things we can do now I mean you can pass laws for transparency even others citizens united our point just being we don't want to wait I mean you're laying out a great you know several year plan that you're even best casements going to take a few years so we we also don't want to just wait and say let's not do things we can I mean remember Kennedy and citizens united said you know we find all this money basically flying around because now we have immediate transparency and everyone will know right away you know I mean judges are great but sometimes they haven't lived in the real world for thirty years I mean come on they the money's hidden I mean most of it's hidden and so no so we want all of these approaches you know we we talk more about balance than just getting money now we want to lower the dependency and the secrecy of big money encourage small donors oh we haven't we don't go at public finance I think that would be unpalatable at least in the near future just as far as a political argument not philosophically but we wanna this is all part of the plan we have a package and we do sometimes appreciate that you have one issue which can keep a group focused there's a little tougher because we're we're nuancing and looking for different positions but it's part of our solution it's one of the options okay and jink what would you say to you know the legislators that we all encounter when we walk into a State House and say that tell us you know look I get it I I care about this issue so much we literally had a legislature and one of our states say I remember the clothes I was wearing the data citizens united went down literally they care about it that much you know it's there's no one in the Statehouse that cares about citizens united more than them and that actually happened so you know but but they don't like the avenue because there's too many states controlled by people like John you know that have the are on their helmet and and if we get a convention it's going to you know be in his image rather than yours for whatever comes out of it so first of all among progressives and Democrats there's two different camps there's the people who say that they care a lot about citizens united and they remember their clothes and they and and that camp but it kidding aside I believe that that legislature and this is in the right camp and they actually do right there's a ton of progressives who who realize how damaging to the country to our government to our democracy citizens united was and did doubling down on what John said Justice Kennedy said that giving money to politicians is not only not corrupt but it does not even give the appearance of corruption it's preposterous I mean Bill Moyers is a great example he says can you imagine if a banner before stepping up the plate just said oh just hold on a second and gave $10,000 to the right I said no no this is not even the appearance of corruption right and that's in essence what we have for the whole government here so that that was I would argue one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in United States history and so and then there's the other half of so-called progressives and Democrats who use Citizens United as a as a slogan but don't mean it at all they want to keep the money in politics and there are groups that will put it high up on their website so get money out of politics citizens united and there's a reason why they do that because first of all the overwhelming majority progresses no wrong majority of the country hate Citizens United right including in your poll eighty-one percent of Republicans right so they go oh yeah Jeff short what we hate Citizens United - hahaha right and and second of all they want to regulate money from you so they send you emails about how they're fighting against Citizens United meanwhile they are in reality fighting for Citizens United and so why how do they do that they do it by saying well man I would love to get money out of politics but golly gee we have to do it through convention and the convention is monstrous and terrible and scary so no we're gonna make sure you don't get a convention and oops did I only close did I close the only Avenue for getting money out of politics golly gee what a shame that I took your money pretended to be in favor of getting money out of politics and they used it to keep money in politics it's really gross its disgusting so there is that strand of so-called progressives - so now in terms of you know what what can we do about it in talking to the honest legislators I think the legislators at the state level are almost universally in the first camp they're not getting paid by any Washington group etc and they are much more attuned as you guys know throughout the country and talking to them to their local constituents they're much more connected to them and I think that they are more earnest both Republican legislators and Democratic legislators so but they do get scared so they get scared about the convention so let's talk about the convention for a second here so first layer is they say well did you know that conservatives can also use a convention no no oh my god is that true I got to go do a breaking story about that right now I'm gonna go YouTube live right so yeah of course of course conservatives can also use a conversion convention because they live in this country they're citizens and it's a democracy yes we all get to use it right and I asked them back did you know the Conservatives can also vote but that's a real question like if you think that you know the service should be allowed to vote and I hope to god you think that right why shouldn't they be also allowed to use a convention which is also part of our Constitution and part of our democracy of course they are now yeah but how will we fight back against them I don't know how about you try how about you make your case instead of hiding in a cave right and so and and conservatives don't realize this because there's so much fear mongering on their side as well they think like the Democrats are getting funded by Soros and there's this big Mean Machine are you kidding me there I mean look yeah unfortunately the Democrats scare easy right and so the minute you go oh convention it's this little scared okay don't give a no convention right so what why is it that the moneyed interests are against the convention because it is real change and that leads us to point number two as to why people are scared because they're scared of democracy because some Democrats in Washington will say you know the the Conservatives have more state houses now etc you know what if they get their way well if they can get three-quarters of the states to push for their convention and they get three-quarters of the states to ratify then they should get that amendment and on the Left 2/3 2/3 to call as 3/4 to ratify so if if the and that's heresy on the left right but I don't think that's heresy at all so now if it's an amendment that I don't agree with the balanced budget amendments tooth and nail on that and I and the reason they don't like me is because I'm pretty good fighter right so and we'll go to battle on that but you battle issue by issue so now they say what wait wait a minute no I don't want you to do the money out of politics convention because somebody in Washington told me that you could combine that with the balanced budget amendment or the convention of the states which are conservative and then you can get 2/3 and 2/3 of the states to call for a convention and then and then the conventional run away so let's take it one step at a time so can you combine them they used to say that all the time for years and years they said you could combine them now we know for a fact it is settled you cannot combine them because we have over 34 states that are called for conservative conventions in Congress counted already so they're past 34 if so they've taken combined balanced budget amendment and convention of the states they'd have a convention today so all in and there's some look there's some bad actors but there's also good-hearted people like I love Robert Reich I think he's a great wonderful progressive he's been on the right side of so many issues but he keeps saying they can combine things Bob I'm sorry but you're just factually incorrect if they could combine on issues conservatives without needing liberals at all without needing the money out of politics dimension at all could call their convention today it's just not true stop saying things that aren't true because otherwise people are gonna at some point think you're lying okay and and I know a lot of them purposely are I doubt Bob is I really think he was misdirected but and then point to is they say all right well okay fine you get to a convention let's okay fine it's on one issue it turns out you had the facts on your side but what if they hijack the convention and instead of it being about money or politics they out vote you and they make it about abortion and then they ratify it within the convention and oh no okay what if lizard people land and Alex Jones was right and and you need 13 states to block I can't make a point you're gonna outlaw abortion or guns or anything else you can count to 13 states to stop anything is not popular yes it is also it is also absolutely factually incorrect to say that you could ratify an amendment within a convention not remotely true anyone who says that either has never read article 5 or read article 5 and is purposely trying to mislead you on it article 5 very very clearly says doesn't matter if you're judicially conservative or liberal it says a convention is to propose an amendment okay and it says no matter which way it is proposed either through a convention or through Congress it must be ratified by three-quarters of the states so John might want a really conservative amendment I got bad news from hey go get one okay I might want a really progressive amendment and I'm not gonna get one either right oh you know let's say I wanted to ban guns how in the world am I gonna get three-quarters of the states to agree to that it's absolute you guys have been there it's absolutely impossible right so on the other hand there is one issue that all almost all Americans outside of politicians and lobbyists agree on which is gamin we want our democracy back we want free and fair elections so that's doable that's what they're scared of and so unfortunately there is a lot of propaganda on the left against the convention that is totally misleading and I'm afraid sometimes purposely so and it is not fact base you cannot ratify inside a convention and it must be on a single issue so let's for the sake of this debate say that we actually got to a convention right we got the 34 states to call it on our issue right now we only have five so we've got a ways to go but we get to 34 Congress says you know what that's pretty clear these are all daisy-chained together it's all for the this issue of dealing with you know real I mean let the Commission is just a discussion so what we're doing is we're calling forward around this issue citizens united related cases so we get there and you know you can represent the the our team and you can represent the D team I'm just curious what what would your you know proposal be what would you say as a as a delegate to this convention because I think it's easy for people's minds to just wonder when it comes to this you know like least for me when I when I think it through I I don't get I don't just don't understand the fear at all like I I wouldn't mind you standing up on a convention and proposing any idea that you have with that backstop you know like you just explained the way that article 5 was written is very clear it is only a place to have a national conversation where we propose amendments that need to be approved by 75% of our state governments so yeah that is also something that we say is if you're afraid of something that 75% of the states agree on you're not afraid of a convention you're afraid of democracy itself right so you know if we get this so we get the convention it's on this issue you're sent there's a delegate what is what does John Partners decision to this what do you what's the amendment that you would goal number one is that states are allowed to put their own laws in you start there okay that that is not a violation of the First Amendment we have this fix in America I mean we worked on which as a couple has a gerrymandering aspect to but at very least you want to come out of there saying you can no longer throughout state laws or federal laws yeah if a if members of Congress want to actually put laws in that say you can hide all your money make them do it stand up to their voters you know get the judges out of it so that's the beginning I would look at other proposals on if maybe it is necessary to require most money to be disclosed or ways to make sure that giving straight to candidates it's just as easy as or easier than give it to some third party I think you can build other things on it but if you at least come out there saying there's no longer any plank where a judge can go out or someone can take something Supreme Court say you've got to throw out Montana's law you've got to thought this law or you got to throw out a congressional law that that is no longer a argument in the debates Oh we'd love to do this constituent but we can't it's unconstitutional you got to get rid of that backstop for the the politician who wants to keep the money secret that is crazy all right wait he was part of that and give your own so what do you think of his idea I don't mind his idea at all of course that was always in the details and we'll you know hopefully when we get to the convention we will both sighs we'll analyze each other to cement proposed amendments with a fine-tooth comb but if Montana wants to have different laws in Connecticut whether it's on guns or this issue that makes sense that's also part of our system and I think it should be and I think it's great look you know back to me being a progressive and and leaving the Republican Party I thought they were for states rights and some principle conservatives like John are still are but a lot of them just used it for you know on civil rights but not on other things not on Bush v gore not on marijuana and and now on this issue wait a minute now Montana is for is one of the best states in the country against corruption there the citizens of Montana do not want corruption now all some national Republican legislators are saying no we don't care what the people of Montana want or don't want you will have the corruption and you will like it and that's crazy if you're a real conservative of course you should want Montana and South Dakota to make their own laws so and you're right South Dakota one of the worst in the country and good progressives and conservatives fighting in South Dakota on the same side to clean it up and get there all the dirty lobbyist money out of the hands of the politicians there so in terms of what we would propose look there's our you know yeah you personally know is you I don't know the wolf pack would even propose anything I don't have anything yeah there's wolf pack is to get the convention to get money out of politics at the convention there'll be many different people and and organizations and delegates etc and they will do the proposing if it was me I would propose to publicly finance every election in the country a period not piecemeal not a little bit of the sheriff in Arizona well I don't know pre or post prison sentence hardened but in that particular case but anyway no seriously and not hey let's just try Congress no private financing lease politicians working for private interests public financing leads to politicians who work for the public interest they always work for their donors the question is is it going to be multinational corporations or is it going to be us that are financing them and and them working for us but look I'm sure that progressives will also propose ending corporate personhood so I know that that scares a lot of people especially on the right or in the right leading politicians I think that if you asked conservative voters they'd say I have the same answer as any other rational human being do you think I and I've asked this question in every room conceivable nobody's ever raised their hand do you think your corporation is a human being let the record note no one raised their hand as in every room filled with Americans on the Supreme Court five people would raise their hand right and go yeah well of course there are human beings oh s - so when they break the law can I send their executives to jail oh no no no no no you can't do that what happened I thought they were human right no no they have special rights and they bought those rights so I would end corporate personhood and there's some on the left that are even scared of that but I would propose that and then you see hey doesn't get passed in a convention you might not make it out of the convention you might not get fifty percent before 51 percent of vote for it in the convention even if it makes it out of a convention can you get three-quarters of the states to ratify and if you do great then that's what Americans believed in if you can't sorry that's this it is very hard to get an amendment in this country it means that not enough people agreed my guess is some conservatives will propose term limits right and so it's an interesting conversation Devils in the details but God doesn't the sound to all people who care about democracy doesn't this sound great already where we would have an exchange of ideas and proposals that we would vote and we would have conversations and we would fight and we would debate and at the end a certain number of amendments on this issue maybe one maybe a couple would come out but only on this issue and then we take it to the people god that would be amazing you would think he would be called America Soho lit for God's sake let's do that and everyone who is screaming at you did not do it it goes back to what John said at the very beginning they don't want change and there and I think the reason an article five convention did better in your polled and even against citizens united is because it represents that change and real Americans want that change they're dying for that change that's why Hillary Clinton lost to a guy who was falling a thirty seven percent on election day because she she was seen as the number one fighter for the status quo for the establishment and against change now some people can say that's unfair whatever but that is how she was perceived so she lost her guy pulling a thirty seven percent because we all want change but if you're already rich and powerful and you live in Washington and you've been doing those organizations that are well-funded for decades do you really want change because change might mean you lose a job change might mean that you actually can't get the funding that you've been getting that is super scary to them that is why a lot of the groups on the left and the right in Washington fight against the article five convention harder than they fight against any other issue because they know the same thing we know in this room which is that it is real change we're excited by it they're scared by it what do you think of this proposed amendment hey we have not come out for public financing and I do get there there is a good intellectual argument for it you would actually save money it cetera I don't think it's palatable now but I don't see any way to get in that many states now but let's see how this process plays out maybe five years from now you have an article five convention at that point the public says yeah that's a better option we've stuck more today we want to bring back hill tax credit taking that away where everyone keeps the first two hundred they were going to send the IRS and send that pic their candidate pick good stewards pick people aren't corrupt if you could really build up that kind of funding and then you can get conservatives on board on that because one we all hate the IRS yeah we do it their money not theirs I mean you know you've got all your buttons there to where I could see that being a 3/4 passage issue but again let's see I said this is all democracy maybe a few years ago you know public finance makes sense right now it's probably the one campaign finance issue that's not popular and I'm just talking popular vote public financing is not its view is giving money to politicians so that's a tough one but no I said the bigger thing is just the discussion that we'd be in the room democracy you'd be working yeah we'd have disagreements there but my gosh if we're arguing over which kind of tweaks we need to make and we know people can actually enact laws again through them legislature we've already won anything we get there is icing on the cake beyond that agreed so you're not afraid of him proposing that amendment edification I'm not afraid notice again I think right now that one could not get three-quarters of the states but you know but that's fine though she said that's what's built in same reason you couldn't ban guns or abortion at one of these if you came in three courses states yeah so let me address one more liberal fear which is yeah but hey Jake he would go to the convention they're gonna advil you or they're gonna do tricks right they're gonna put bring lobbyists in his delegates first of all states can read recall their delegates if they don't do as they are mandated to do they don't tell you that part second of all oh my god lobbyists influencing a process I've never seen that before yeah I don't know if you guys know there's the thing we're trying to change Congress that's the rule that's not the exception that's the rule and they're like yeah but you this is really dangerous because you could use it to propose amendments you could use Congress to propose amendments and it's totally bought by the lobbyists so we're not naive you know III think John is earnest is it going to be just John at the convention from the right wing no do I think the Koch brothers if there's a convention are going to be heavily motivated to try to figure out what you know how to influence that yes well they're already heavily motivated to figure out how to influence Congress and they've already won on that so that's what we're trying to change so they're saying don't try to change something that is so bad that that's the current system that makes no sense it's a circular argument it makes no sense at all so but at the end of the day if we wait for either liberals to have more states or conservatives to have more states before we go to a convention we'll never go to a convention and that's part of the whole point of why they use that argument oh no no no no not while the Conservatives are in church well I remember when the Democrats were in charge when Obama was had a supermajority in Congress and he had all those signs that I remember that said change on them you know did he propose an article v convention when the Democrats were in charge no and they're not going to they're never going to propose it it's a trick so the reality is go to the Commission yes be on your guard yes make sure those delegates are selected in a way that suits the the reason why the states voted for a convention in the first place and remember those those state legislators at that point are your allies because they're the ones who called for that convention and they don't want it to be hijacked by the left or the right they called it for a reason and they're the ones who get to enforce the delegates so yes we will fight like hell to make sure that that convention is fair and honest from both sides and yes it'll be a challenge from time to time but it'll be less of a challenge than we have in Congress today and at the end of the day even if the boogeyman makes it past the convention you need three quarters of the states to ratify so there's no they cannot get past that argument so even if the Koch brothers hijack the Convention and propose an amendment to give every dollar in the country to David and Charles Koch or or George Soros said the same you're not gonna get three quarters of the states to ratify it so that's just the reality that's pretty clear so I want to ask John you know you've been doing this for a little while now are you are you hopeful that we can actually do this and you know from from my perspective we go out we talk to voters you know we canvassed it's not that much different and we talked to Democratic voters Republican voters independent voters doesn't matter we say hey we're trying to fix the corruption in DC we want to do it with an amendment we want to go around Congress you know through the state to get it it's almost a no-brainer I mean it's it's it's nine out of ten people are like thank you you know we get we get a lot of a lot of people really just excited that we're out there talking to people about this issue but I'm curious like you're you're one of the only conservative groups right and you know we thank you for for doing that but how do we bring more conservative organizations you know people in the in the political arena I guess into other than just voters because we know that citizens are already there Republican voters are on our side on this there's just no question about it but how do we bring that into the the political sphere and just get yeah I guess just get more organizations to do what you're doing yeah I'd say one thing and this will be a shameless plug for a book that's not mine I make no money on it but one of our advisory committee members Peter Schweitzer wrote secret empires I would ask everyone to get that he is an equal opportunity offender he's the one who discovered this Biden deal I talked about but you'll also see Mitch McConnell on that cover you'll see one of the Trump relatives in that cover yes I mean he walks through this and I think you go through that book and even have a couple to hand them to a conservative they get I'm talking to conservative legislature they will get look this is something you tak your Article five argument on to that and say look this is the kind of stuff we're trying to stop and because that'll also broaden you a little past don't just think campaign dollars cuz again somebody gives you campaign dollars you're beholden to them someone gives your kid a ton of money you're really really beholden to them so we need to think beyond this you know we're gonna need rules like if you've got a family member making more than a hundred K before in government you've got to report that when you run for office this is absurd you know the influence and you know freedom you don't know I know a lot of the left is more focused on Russia now China has a lot more money than Russia so don't limit yourself to who's trying to influence our elections so I would say a couple of crit and and because Schweitzer wrote Clinton cash he's an equal opportunity offender but he's also he's a well-known regular Fox News got something outlets you're not gonna want to watch but it's a way to get this argument just find things like that to piggyback so that they see so that when they hear all I heard this was just a you know some left-wing attack some but you know you said no no absolutely he the kind of thing we're trying to address right here I think that's the way to get in the door some kind of leave behind it gives conservative credibility and I've been told a couple of you here if you want to leave any Republican legislator leaving my cellphone number that's fine they probably won't really call me but at least they can look us up and say okay you got some conservatives back in you too it might help get you over that initial hurdle okay so just to kind of wrap it up I guess you know this is exactly what we want in wolf pack I mean this is why we're all here this is why we truly are a nonpartisan organization it's in the resolution right people can make up all these things in their head you know about our solutions and jenk honestly your solution doesn't really matter to wolf pack right I mean it is just your solution we can't dictate it thanks a lot so but that's why we're all so I think just comfortable and with this plan that we have because if we're going to solve this problem if we're gonna get back to a government that maybe you remember maybe you remember IIE even do actually even in the 90s that they're in a little bit before then where I feel is more responsive to the people not perfect but it's really been going in the wrong direction for the last you know thirty thirty years or so so if we are going to correct the course of this country and and solve this this one problem right that we clearly do agree on right I mean these both sides agree on we've got a we've got to solve this issue of our elected officials in Washington DC being influenced and corrupted just one quick one they can be the victims too I just want to be clear sometimes the politician is getting threatened raising twenty seven hundred dollars at a time as a member and being told hey I can put two million in to destroy you so I just said you stay open-minded there's certainly a corrupt you know there is corruption there but in a lot of cases these guys in a terrible system they don't like walking down to the RNC say DNC C and making phone calls for money all day they didn't why they got elected so I just want to throw that olive branch to some of these legislators he talking to pink said the state even more so but even the members of Congress this isn't a very nice life right now for a lot of them yeah and actually that is something that we stress and we say a lot of times you know at Arkham and we're talking to legislators about this is yeah we do realize that there are a lot of good people that get get elected there with good intentions they get trapped essentially in the system another reason why we think a convention is the right way to go is because even with so many members of Congress not wanting to raise money for 70% of their time way up to 70 percent of the time is what we hear we have to give them another way you know this is this is a way to either pressure them to do it or yes to give us another way to approach that a minute because there they are trapped in that system right so this is to us this is just a really logical thing that we need to be doing we need to we need to force this conversation and there's historical precedents for it right some people don't realize this but the majority of all US constitutional amendments have included a convention campaign going all the way back to the Bill of Rights Congress didn't want to propose those so the states to New York and Virginia called for a commission to propose those 10 amendments it might not seem like many states but that was 25% of the states back then we only have 15% of the states right now so if we can get to 25 30 40 50 percent something's going to happen right if we can get the demand within the states up on this issue enough so yeah at the end of the day you know yes Jake you have a progressive talk show but you're you know you can't dictate it you know you started this organization because you genuinely want to fix this problem and I guess you know I would just like to end on on asking you both the question and you can have some closing remarks as well but are you I'll start with you John are you hopeful that we're actually going to do I mean do you think we can do you see or do you think it's too far gone because there are a lot of people who have just flat-out given up yeah I would say this I'm come from going to change campaign finance laws we do view article 5 is one of the arrows in their quiver so just you know to be honest this is not you know our one issue like it is for you it's one of the ways and I would just encourage you all obviously for you it means the end is actually the article five convention the ultimate end is that we have rational money and politics laws and if article five convention brings the pressure that makes Congress act or something else that's fine to be prepared to view that of wind but yeah there's a chance people are fired up to change things and I'll go back the Alaska example for early they were about to face a referenda they were about to look bad and a couple a week or two ago the governor also okay we're gonna go and give you your laws so your points right it can be a means to the end or it can be the end but we're gonna get there people are just too upset about the current system okay so let me close loop by going to another China example here on corruption so ZTE is a telecommuting shake telecommunications company in China it's one of the largest in the world but our national and security officials said we're afraid they're using it to spy in on our military on our companies and and they've also violated some of our agreements in terms of trade etc so we banned them from doing business with the US and Donald Trump and all of a sudden tweeted how much he cares about jobs being lost in China and that was strange I didn't think the Hat said make America China great again right and and so then you dig in a little bit more and it turns out what happened was the Chinese gave a billion dollars to Park in Indonesia and that park then decided that it was going to name something after Trump and give him a licensing fee so I don't know how many millions of dollars that licensing fee was but all of a sudden the thing that China wanted was to lift the sanctions on ZTE Trump in the midst of a trade war in the midst of all the things that he's talking about with tariffs goes out of his way to lift the punishment on the one company that was the worst violator but there's now going to be a Trump building in Indonesia somewhere and he's gonna get a lot richer so this corruption is sick it's sick when Trump does it I hadn't heard that Biden story before I'll look into it if that's true it's sick when that happens and and it's endemic and systemic unfortunately for the whole of Washington Orrin Hatch's son as a lobbyist he gets almost anything he wants because he's ordered his son norm Coleman's wife used to be a lobbyist and does it happen on the Democratic side absolutely this is the pigs of the trough right and and they're eating at our expense so now on to the to the hope do I am i hopeful about it well look so I'll tell you a story about a shotgun and how that leads the hope all right so this actually comes from you Mike and some of the volunteers in Pennsylvania so before the election I get a call saying just so you know Donald Trump's gonna win the election okay well that was Alison to be fair yeah and and I said oh that's interesting why she said we've been canvassing in Pennsylvania for hundreds of miles and have not seen a Hillary Clinton sighs okay this is Trump country and and he's good he's definitely gonna win Pennsylvania we haven't seen someone supporting Hillary Clinton for literally hundreds of miles right and so that's not their job their job is to go and try to get money out of politics but they talk to whoever is at the door right and so they were right you guys were right as you communicated with the real Americans about their real concerns etcetera but the story that I love most out of that Pennsylvania thing was a guy comes into the door with a shotgun okay so like hey how you doing and and you're gonna be shine to find out he was also conservative and by the end of a couple of minute conversation he literally put down a shotgun to sign the petition saying damn right I want money out of politics and I want to end the corruption and I want to end the crony capitalism and I want to go back to democracy right look ninety three percent of Americans believe that politicians represent their donors instead of their voters so I tell the story all the time because it's true and it's powerful when women try to get an amendment to vote the right to vote now that was impossible because they didn't have the right to vote how could you get the right to vote if you don't have the right to vote it's impossible and in 93% of the country not agree it was a good 50% who didn't agree in the beginning and then they warmed down and they and in seven years after the first march in the streets they had their amendment so anything is possible anything is doable and in America we always expand Liberty and we will expand Liberty to include all of us again we have the overwhelming majority of the American people on our side so let's go out there talk to them let them know what the reality and what the truth is and that we are not partisan so we don't care about the D on your helmet we don't care about the R on your helmet all we care about is let's get our government back so thank you all right
