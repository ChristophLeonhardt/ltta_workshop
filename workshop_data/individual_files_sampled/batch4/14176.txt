the Prime Minister has repeatedly told us that the lengthening of the transition period would only be for a matter of months but leaked documents show she's lying so it doesn't really come as any shock to me that Teresa may has lied about the transition period saying it would only be months when it could in fact be years but I think is worth covering anyway The Times has seen leaked documents that have been sent around Whitehall revealing more about the Prime Minister's brexit plan it turns out that these documents suggest the UK could be left in a long-running transition period that actually lasts a matter of years despite the fact that Theresa May has promised over and over again that if it happened if it happened she liked to strengthen that point of if then it would only be a matter of months but it looks like she was lying it means the Prime Minister isn't just being a little bit dishonest twisting the facts a little bit she flat-out said that she doesn't want it to happen doesn't expect it to happen but if it did happen it would only be a few months but she's lying and according to The Times the Prime Minister is now aware of the red lines surrounding brexit over the extended period of transition after her cabinet was in uproar over the issue I'm amazed that her cabinet is still around if I monastic the cabinet is constantly fighting the PM the PM is constantly trying to wrestle down the cabinet and keep them in line but apparently she's seen the error of her ways or so women to believe because that doesn't stop her being untrustworthy and sneaky and the point that really drives at home that Teresa may really is quite sneaky is one of the most shocking stories I've seen recently and it relates to the fact to the matter of the 48 letters which I've been talking about a lot recently these are the 48 letters that need to be sent to so gray in the chair of the 1922 Commission asking for a vote of confidence in the Prime Minister and it turns out after we heard that we have hit that threshold of the forty eight letters anonymous sources claim we've hit those 48 it turns out that actually decoy letters might have been sent by as many as six allies of the Prime Minister so let me explain this one to you the standard reported on this but let me break it down simply so when those 48 letters are sent to sir Graham so Graham then has to go back to everybody who's one of those letters asking for a vote of confidence and asked them are you sure have you not changed your mind do you want to go ahead with this so remember that so now the story is that six as many as six of allies of the prime minister actually submitted letters of their own this means that once that 48 threshold is hit the decoy our members of parliament will receive correspondence from so Grahame asking them are you sure when they receive that correspondence asking them are they sure they know to go back to the Prime Minister and say watch out 48 have been hit which means we're on our way to a vote of no-confidence how sneaky is that this is house of cards level stuff this is absolute insanity it's dodgy as hell and it makes me seem a as less determined which I kind of always saw her as determined she's lying to us but she's damn determined in doing it but I now I see amorous scheming we simply can't trust this woman so it looks like she may well be sticking around for a little while after all maybe we haven't actually hit those 48 and now she's just in panic mode trying to ensure that her members of parliament stay on her side she just told her colleagues by the way that Donald Tusk the president of the European Council remains ready to convene at a November emergency summit which looks to be going ahead now as long as sufficient progress can be made in the negotiations but the question remains whether this Northern Ireland this you can even be dealt with in time and whether other sticking issues can actually be solved in a matter of days or weeks so let me sum up where we are with Bragg's it and Teresa may right now Northern Ireland remains a sticking point the backstop issue doesn't seem to be able to be resolved and so Teresa may promised a months-long extension on the transition period but leaked documents show otherwise they say that it could be years Theresa May is also potentially used decoys in the submission 448 letters to the chair of the 1922 committee meaning she could be alerted to early warning signs of an oustanding danger and aware indeed that she's betraying the people and Theresa May is still struggling to hold together a cabinet that would frankly rather see her become significantly more decisive make no mistake what is happening right now with brexit we must remember this because this is a betrayal no ifs and buts about it this isn't hyperbole and I'm not exaggerating Teresa may is lying to us about her Briggs it proposals and the transition period that could indeed last a matter of years the government has no intention to deliver Briggs it and if we are indeed behind on the 48 letters that we need because of trees and maze decoys submissions then I can't encourage enough Tory MPs who are currently sitting back doing nothing twittering their thumbs and waiting for Teresa may to take action they should be aware that Teresa may isn't gonna take action and it's time for those guys to stand up hold may to account and asked her if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team be sure to download our new app from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store
