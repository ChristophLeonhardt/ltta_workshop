1
00:00:01,362 --> 00:00:02,762
THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:04,864
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT, MEANWHILE

3
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:06,599
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO HAD

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,267
PREVIOUSLY WARNED AGAINST

5
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,235
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT IN THE CASE

6
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:11,538
OF JAMAL KHASHOGGI NOW SAYING

7
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,840
IT DOES APPEAR THE "WASHINGTON

8
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,742
POST" COLUMNIST IS DEAD AND HE

9
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:16,443
IS JUST WAITING FOR

10
00:00:16,444 --> 00:00:17,677
INVESTIGATIONS TO WRAP UP TO

11
00:00:17,678 --> 00:00:24,117
TAKE ACTION.

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,285
>> President Trump: IT

13
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,654
CERTAINLY LOOKS THAT WAY TO ME.

14
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:33,593
IT'S VERY SAD.

15
00:00:33,594 --> 00:00:42,536
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION]

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,837
>> Julie: HOW SOON DOES THE

17
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:46,873
WHITE HOUSE EXPECT TO GET TO

18
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,308
THE SAUDI'S REPORT ON

19
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:49,008
KHASHOGGI'S DEATH?

20
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,410
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT COULD

21
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,512
HAPPEN AS SOON AS AS TODAY

22
00:00:52,513 --> 00:00:54,414
ALTHOUGH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS

23
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:55,348
OFFICIALLY ARE SAYING LISTEN,

24
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:56,616
WE'LL LET THIS THING PLAY OUT

25
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,151
AND RESPECT THEM AND GIVE THEM

26
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:00,019
THE CHANCE TO WORK THROUGH THE

27
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,453
INVESTIGATION.

28
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:02,589
BUT MY SOURCES TELL ME THEY

29
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,557
EXPECT A REPORT FAIRLY SOON AND

30
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:05,658
IN FAIRLY SHORT ORDER.

31
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,494
YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT

32
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,362
THIS AND ABOUT RICH'S REPORT.

33
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:11,097
IS THERE AN AUDIO TAPE OUT

34
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:11,698
THERE?

35
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,398
THAT REMAINS UNCLEAR.

36
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:17,070
BUT WE DO KNOW THIS IS CLEAR,

37
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,738
HEATHER NAUERT TOLD US

38
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,373
SECRETARY POMPEO HASN'T HEARD A

39
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:23,176
TAPE OR SEEN A TRANSCRIPT

40
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:25,979
RELATED TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI'S

41
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,412
DISAPPEARANCE.

42
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:27,380
I MENTION THE TRANSCRIPT PEOPLE

43
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,483
SAID DID HE READ SOMETHING LIKE

44
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:30,950
THAT?

45
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,418
HEATHER NAUERT TELLS US

46
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,052
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

47
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,687
ASKED WHETHER THIS WILL UPSET

48
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,823
THE LONGSTANDING TIES BETWEEN

49
00:01:36,824 --> 00:01:37,957
THE U.S. AND SAUDI KINGDOM

50
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:38,925
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO SAID

51
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,828
NO.

52
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:43,463
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

53
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,565
US ALL TO REMEMBER, TOO, SINCE

54
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,901
1932 WE HAVE A LONG STRATEGIC

55
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,068
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KINGDOM

56
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:51,437
OF SAUDI ARABIA THAT CONTINUE

57
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:52,605
TO BE IMPORTANT COUNTER

58
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,106
TERRORISM PARTNER.

59
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:55,675
THEY HAVE CUSTODY OF THE TWO

60
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,076
HOLY SITES.

61
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,278
THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC

62
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,679
ALLIANCE OF THE UNITED STATES.

63
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,080
WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT

64
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,882
AS WELL.

65
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:05,218
>> NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE

66
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:05,885
LONGSTANDING RELATIONSHIP.

67
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:06,853
I ASKED A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL

68
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,254
AS EARLY AS THIS MORNING IF

69
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:11,057
THEY FELT LIKE THIS WOULD LEAD

70
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,959
TO VERY SEVERE CONSEQUENCES AND

71
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,093
SHE PUT IT BLUNTLY.

72
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:15,995
YES.

73
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,630
>> Julie: WHERE ARE WE ON THE

74
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,732
WHITE HOUSE'S RESPONSE TO THE

75
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,167
MIGRANT CARAVAN WHICH IS

76
00:02:21,168 --> 00:02:22,068
HEADING TOWARD OUR SOUTHERN

77
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,036
BORDER?

78
00:02:23,037 --> 00:02:24,304
>> A VERY BIG STORY, JULIE.

79
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:25,838
THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO

80
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,707
APPLY PRESSURE ON THEIR

81
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,408
NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH,

82
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,576
MEXICO'S GOVERNMENT TO DO

83
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:30,743
SOMETHING TO KEEP THAT CARAVAN

84
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:32,078
FROM MAKING IT FROM THE

85
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,680
SOUTHERN END OF MEXICO ALL THE

86
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,882
WAY TO OUR BORDER.

87
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:37,984
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT SAID AS

88
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:40,086
MUCH LAST NIGHT AT THAT MAKE

89
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,555
AMERICA GREAT RALLY IN MONTANA.

90
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,691
>> President Trump: I JUST WANT

91
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:45,858
TO THANK THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT

92
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:47,560
BECAUSE THEY ARE STOPPING IT

93
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,762
HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT EVER GETS

94
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:50,129
TO MEXICO.

95
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,833
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

96
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:56,169
AS YOU KNOW, I'M WILLING TO

97
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,904
SEND THE MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR

98
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:58,938
SOUTHERN BORDER IF NECESSARY.

99
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:03,676
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

100
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,545
>> THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION.

101
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:09,215
SO DID THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS

102
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:14,020
ABOUT MONTANA CONGRESSMAN GREG

103
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,222
-- HE GOT INVOLVED WITH A

104
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,991
DUST-UP WITH A REPORTER.

105
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:20,126
THE PRESIDENT HAD THIS TO SAY.

106
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,294
>> President Trump: ANY GUY

107
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:23,763
THAT CAN DO A BODY SLAM IS MY

108
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:25,565
KIND --

109
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:26,733
HE WAS WAY UP.

110
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,835
I SAID THIS WAS LIKE THE DAY OF

111
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:30,236
THE ELECTION OR JUST BEFORE.

112
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,372
AND I SAID OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE.

113
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:33,773
HE WILL LOSE THE ELECTION.

114
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,875
I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW

115
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:36,809
MONTANA PRETTY WELL.

116
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,344
I THINK IT MIGHT HELP HIM AND

117
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:41,014
IT DID.

118
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:43,082
>> THERE WILL BE SOME POINTING

119
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,517
TO THE AUDIENCE AND SAY THEY

120
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:45,685
WERE LAUGHING AND MAKING LIGHT

121
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:48,121
OF THIS BUT THIS IS A VERY

122
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:50,857
SERIOUS ISSUE FOR JOURNALISTS.

123
00:03:50,858 --> 00:00:00,000
THE COMMITTEE TO PROTECT
