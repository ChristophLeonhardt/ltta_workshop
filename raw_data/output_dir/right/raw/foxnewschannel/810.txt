AND UP."

SENATOR.

18
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,171
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

19
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,372
LET'S TALK IMMIGRATION FIRST.

20
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,808
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

21
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:30,809
DONE ON THE HILL.

22
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:32,476
PAUL RYAN, HOUSE SPEAKER, SAID

GOT THE INDICATION FROM SENATE

26
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:37,282
MAJORITY LEADER

27
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:38,784
MITCH McCONNELL THAT THERE IS

28
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:39,618
HOPE ONE OF THESE HOUSE BILLS

29
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:40,819
COULD PASS IN THE SENATE.

30
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:41,720
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE?

31
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,621
>> I DON'T KNOW.

32
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:43,855
I HAVE TO SAY WITH A PASS.

33
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,625
AS TO THE CHILDREN AS YOU COME I

34
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,793
THINK THERE IS SOME GROWING

35
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:48,994
CONSENSUS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

36
00:00:48,994 --> 00:00:49,861
BRING FAMILIES UP BUT WE DO WANT

37
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,797
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ARE

38
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:52,631
CAUGHT COMING HERE ILLEGALLY,

39
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:53,432
THEY SHOW UP FOR THEIR COURT

40
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:53,732
DATE.

41
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,967
THAT IS THE DILEMMA.

42
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:58,437
IF A FAMILY IS CAUGHT AT THE

43
00:00:58,437 --> 00:00:59,805
BORDER, MOTHER AND FATHER AND

44
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,206
THE CHILDREN, I WHAT I WANT TO

45
00:01:01,206 --> 00:01:02,574
DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY

46
00:01:02,574 --> 00:01:03,809
TOGETHER, BUT THE PARENTS SHOW

47
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,411
UP FOR THE HEARING, AND THEY GET

48
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:07,446
DEPORTED TOGETHER, THEY BROKE

49
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:07,813
THE LAW.

50
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:08,480
>> Shannon: THAT'S A TOUGH

51
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,448
ONE.

52
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:11,616
HERE SOMETHING IN THE DHSS

53
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:12,884
SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID.

54
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:17,355
OVER THE LAST YEAR, 300%

55
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:18,123
INCREASE IN UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN

56
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:18,490
CHILDREN.

57
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,761
TEN OF THE 12,000 WERE SENT HERE

58
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,396
ALONG WITH OTHER PARENTS.

59
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:27,966
LAST YEAR, 435% INCREASE IN

60
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:28,633
ILLEGAL FAMILY UNITS COMING.

61
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,603
OVER THE LAST DECADE, SHE SAID,

62
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,239
SINCE 2013, MORE THAN 500,000

63
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,807
ILLEGAL MINORS AND FAMILIES THAT

64
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,209
WERE ADMITTED HERE FROM

65
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,577
CENTRAL AMERICA HAVE DISAPPEARED

66
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:39,211
SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

67
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:39,945
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

68
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:41,413
>> Shannon: HOW DO GET THEM TO

69
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:41,847
SHOW BUCK UP?

70
00:01:41,847 --> 00:01:43,582
>> WHAT WHAT I DO WITH THE

71
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:45,217
UNACCOMPANIED MINORS, THEY ARE

72
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,651
NOT FROM MEXICO.

73
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,688
I WOULD WORK TO MEXICO TO HELP

74
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:53,558
THEM KEEP -- STOP THEM AND

75
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:54,659
MEXICO, THAT IS WHERE THEY COME

76
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:55,026
THROUGH.

77
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,795
THAT IS ON MEXICO COULD HELP US

78
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,597
WITH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

79
00:01:58,597 --> 00:01:58,930
PROBLEM.

80
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,631
>> Shannon: THEIR OBLIGATION

81
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,233
WAS, WE HAD WITH THE CARAVAN

82
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:04,803
COMING, AND MEXICO, THEY THEY

83
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:05,770
WERE HELPING GIVE THEM SAFE

84
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,605
PASSAGE TO THE U.S. BORDER.

85
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:09,007
>> I WOULD TELL MEXICO, IF YOU

86
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:10,375
WANT TO BETTER TRADING

87
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,877
PARTNERSHIP, BE A BETTER PARTNER

88
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:12,844
STOPPING THESE PEOPLE, PUTTING

89
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:14,045
THESE FAMILIES AT RISK COMING TO

90
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:15,413
AMERICA, AND WE ARE THE BAD GUY.

91
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,415
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS HAVE PEOPLE

92
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:18,917
APPLY FOR ASYLUM IN THEIR HOME

93
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:20,819
COUNTRY, JUST DON'T SHOW UP AND

94
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,020
I ARE.

95
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,655
GO TO THE CONSULATE OR EMBASSY

96
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:25,657
IN YOUR COUNTRY AND APPLY FOR

97
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:26,391
ASYLUM THAT WAY.

98
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,025
>> Shannon: ONE OF THE

99
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:27,893
DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, ONE OF

100
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:29,594
YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER

101
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:30,595
SIDE OF THE AISLE,

102
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,763
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, HAD THIS TO

103
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:32,898
SAY ABOUT THIS WHOLE SITUATION

104
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:33,198
TODAY.

105
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:36,401
>> THIS POLICY OF FAMILY

106
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,136
SEPARATION REMINDS US OF THE

107
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:42,374
CATTLE CARDS OF NAZI GERMANY

108
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:45,911
WHEN CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED

109
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:47,979
FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND MARCH TO

110
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:48,580
THE SHOWERS.

111
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,782
>> ALL I CAN SAY, I DON'T THINK

112
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:52,617
YOU ARE A BUNCH OF NAZIS.

113
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:54,052
THE BORDER PATROL, YOU ARE DOING

114
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,187
THE JOB THE BEST YOU CAN.

115
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,023
WE'VE GOT A SCREWED UP

116
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:58,790
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

117
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,091
LET'S NOT DEMAGOGUE, LET'S

118
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:00,625
FINISH IT.

119
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,459
SENATOR CRUZ HAS A PRETTY GOOD

120
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:01,993
IDEA.

121
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,429
YOU HOLD THE FAMILY TOGETHER,

122
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,897
YOU EXPEDITE THE HEARING, SO THE

123
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,832
PARENT HAS TO SHOW UP.

124
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:09,501
WHATEVER THE JUDGE RULES, YOU

125
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:10,635
EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY.

126
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:12,470
THAT WILL PREVENT A LOT OF OUR

127
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,837
PROBLEMS.

128
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,673
I THINK SENATOR CRUZ HAS A GOOD

129
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:15,040
SOLUTION.

130
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,941
WE'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES.

131
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,475
>> Shannon: YOU SEEMED TO BE

132
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:18,243
HAVING FUN ON THE HILL

133
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:19,377
QUESTIONING THE JUSTICE

134
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,479
DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL AND

135
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,348
A FBI DIRECTOR.

136
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:24,015
DEMOCRATS TODAY REPEATEDLY

137
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:26,384
HAMMERED ON THE FACT THAT ALL OF

138
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,986
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FINDING OF

139
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:31,189
BIAS WITH A NUMBER OF THE FBI

140
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:31,990
AGENTS INVOLVED WITH THIS

141
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,525
INVESTIGATION OF THE FINDING WAS

142
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:34,659
THAT THAT NEVER IMPACTED THE

143
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:36,828
DECISIONS THEY MADE WITH REGARD

144
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:37,862
TO THE INVESTIGATION.

145
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:39,197
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

146
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:40,999
WHO MADE THE DECISION NOT TO

147
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,366
PROSECUTE?

148
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:45,403
THE FBI.

149
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:48,239
ASKED, IF YOU BELIEVE THE FBI'S

150
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,575
JUDGMENT WAS CLOUDED, WHICH THEY

151
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:51,776
FOUND, BUT THE DECISION NOT TO

152
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:53,244
PROSECUTE, YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT

153
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,981
WAS A RESULT OF BIAS, THE

154
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,415
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID NOT

155
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,383
MAKE THAT DECISION.

156
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,217
COMEY DID.

157
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,586
WHAT DID WE LEARN TODAY?

158
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:04,589
WE LEARNED TODAY THAT THE HEAD

159
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:05,657
INVESTIGATOR OF THE CLINTON

160
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:07,158
EMAIL INVESTIGATION HATED

161
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,426
TRUMP'S GOATS, TOLD HIS FRIEND,

162
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:11,262
MS. PAIGE, WHO WAS IT AN

163
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,197
ATTORNEY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

164
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,932
JUSTICE, ON AUGUST THE EIGHTH,

165
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,767
DON'T WORRY, HE'LL NEVER BE

166
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,769
PRESIDENT, WE'LL STOP THAT.

167
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,370
THEY CHANGED THE MEMO THAT A

168
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,605
COMEY ROAD TO THE COUNTRY ON

169
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,741
JULY 5TH, THEY TOOK THE WORD

170
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:25,844
"GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OUT AND

171
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,012
PUT "EXTREMELY CLEAR LIST."

172
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:29,948
I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY.

173
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:30,715
GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS A LEGAL

174
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,451
TERM THAT WOULD MAKE YOU

175
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,855
SUBJECTIVE TEN YEARS IN PRISON

176
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:37,989
FOR GROWTH, GROSSLY NEGLIGENTLY

177
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:38,723
HANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

178
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,625
ON AUGUST THE EIGHTH, THIS NEW

179
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,395
EMAIL TELLS US ALL WE NEED TO

180
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,529
KNOW, THAT STRZOK WAS INTENDING

181
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:45,664
TO STOP TRUMP.

182
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:49,634
HOW CAN YOU STOP TRUMP IF YOU

183
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:50,969
THE REASON MAY CHANGE THAT WORD

184
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:51,903
IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

185
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,238
INDICT CLINTON IF THEY DID NOT

186
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,205
CHANGE THE TERM.

187
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,373
SO WE LEARNED A LOT TODAY.

188
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,475
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE NUMBER

189
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:59,811
TWO AT THE FBI, ACCORDING TO

190
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,179
STRZOK AND PAGE COMMENCED AT AN

191
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,347
ON A MEETING IN AUGUST TO TRY

192
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,582
TO FIND A WAY TO CHANGE THE

193
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:07,786
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.

194
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:08,787
THAT'S J. EDGAR HOOVER STUFF.

195
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,388
IMAGINE THE NUMBER TWO GUY AT

196
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,590
THE FBI HAVING A MEETING WITH

197
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,825
THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR, AND THE

198
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:15,460
BOTTOM LINE IS, THE WHOLE IDEA

199
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,762
OF THE MEETING WAS TO FIND AN

200
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:19,998
INSURANCE POLICY TO BRACKET, AND

201
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:21,132
PROTECT THE COUNTRY AGAINST

202
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:23,068
TRUMP WINNING PARTY THAT IS WHAT

203
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:23,601
J. EDGAR HOOVER DID.

204
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:24,369
>> Shannon: DID YOU FEEL LIKE

205
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:25,570
YOU GOT ANSWERED TODAY?

206
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,806
>> HERE'S WHAT I FOUND.

207
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:29,808
I FOUND THAT SOMEBODY IS LYING.

208
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,376
McCABE SAYS HE DOESN'T RECALL

209
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:31,810
THAT MEETING.

210
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,178
TO STRZOK AND PAGES THAT HE WAS

211
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:33,945
IN THAT MEETING.

212
00:05:33,945 --> 00:05:35,880
I WON'T GIVE UP ON US.

213
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,416
IF THE NUMBER TWO GUY IN THE FBI

214
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,818
HAD A MEETING WITH PEDRO AND

215
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:41,119
STRZOK AND HIS OFFICE TO FIND

216
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,288
OUT HOW TO CREATE AN

217
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:44,322
INSURANCE POLICY AGAINST TRUMP

218
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:45,990
BEING ELECTED, THAT IS ABUSE OF

219
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,258
THE HIGHEST LEVEL, THE

220
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:48,660
GOVERNMENT THAT IS WATERGATE

221
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,029
STUFF, THAT IS WHAT THE FBI USED

222
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,996
TO DO.

223
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:52,731
I WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

224
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:52,997
IT.

225
00:05:52,997 --> 00:05:54,165
>> Shannon: TO YOU, THIS IS

226
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,200
THE BEGINNING, NOT THE END.

227
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,368
>> THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF

228
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:58,169
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER DREAMED

229
00:05:58,169 --> 00:05:59,404
COULD EXIST IN THIS COUNTRY.

230
00:05:59,404 --> 00:06:00,972
I'VE HAD AN OPEN MIND ABOUT

231
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:03,308
THIS, I TRUST THE FBI COME ABOVE

232
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:03,641
THE FBI.

233
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:07,112
BUT I LEARNED TODAY WHAT THE FBI

234
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,947
AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID IN

235
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,181
THE CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION

236
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,349
IS DANGEROUS TO DEMOCRACY.

237
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,617
SHE GOT AWAY WITH IT AND THEY

238
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:14,185
WERE OUT TO GET TRUMP COMMANDER

239
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,386
COULD BE SOMEBODY NEW NEXT TIME,

240
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:17,989
SO WE NEED TO FIX THIS.

241
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,691
>> Shannon: ACROSS ALL PARTIES

242
00:06:19,691 --> 00:00:00,000
AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES, PEOPLE
