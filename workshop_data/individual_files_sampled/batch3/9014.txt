Laura: PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE HISTORIC DECISION TODAY TO WITHDRAW THE U.S. FROM THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN. HE ALSO SIGNED A MEMO SLAPPING TOUGH SANCTIONS ON THE IRANIAN REGIME. U.S. ALLIES HAVE COMPLAINED THAT LEAVING THE DEAL COULD BE DANGEROUS, BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID IT'S MORE DANGEROUS TO KEEP THE DEAL IN PLACE. THE IRAN DEAL IS DEFECTIVE AT ITS CORE. IF WE DO NOTHING WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN. IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, THE WORLD'S LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERROR WILL BE ON THE CUSP OF ACQUIRING THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONS. AT THE HEART OF THE IRAN DEAL WAS A GIANT FICTION, THAT A MURDEROUS REGIME DESIRED ONLY A PEACEFUL NUCLEAR ENERGY PROGRAM. TODAY WE HAVE DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT THIS IRANIAN PROMISE WAS A LIE. Laura: ON TOP OF THAT, MORE HUGE NEWS. THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE TIME, DATE AND LOCATION HAVE BEEN SET FOR A SETTLEMENT WITH NORTH KOREAN NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN. AND SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO IS NOW IN NORTH KOREA FOR A SECOND TIME TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE TALKS. MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN BOLTON ABOUT TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS A BIG DAY TODAY. PEOPLE ARE FREAKING OUT, THE USUAL SUSPECTS ARE FREAKING OUT. A COUPLE OF OTHER NOT SO USUAL SUSPECTS. THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRATS SET ABOUT THIS DEAL BACK IN 2015 WHEN OBAMA HAD NEGOTIATED IT. LET'S WATCH. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF OUR NEGOTIATION WAS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PATHWAY FOR IRAN TO ACHIEVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITIES. THIS DEAL DOESN'T ACHIEVE THAT. THIS AGREEMENT IS TOO FLAWED AND TOO DANGEROUS FOR US. I READ THE JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION LAST NIGHT, OVER 100 PAGES. I WILL BE HONEST, I WAS SKEPTICAL GOING IN. THERE'S NOTHING I READ LAST NIGHT THAT ALLEVIATES MY SKEPTICISM. THE FACT IS THE DEAL HAS BEEN FLAWED FROM THE BEGINNING. I THINK THE PRESIDENT LAID THAT CASE OUT IN HIS STATEMENT TODAY. HE GAVE THE EUROPEANS AND OTHERS A CHANCE TO FIX IT. IT WAS NOT DOABLE BECAUSE THE FLAWS GO RIGHT TO THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE DEAL. HE DID WHAT HE CLEARLY ADVERTISED HE WAS GOING TO DO AS FAR BACK AS THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, PULLED THE UNITED STATES OUT OF THE DEAL. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR SECURITY INTEREST TO GET OUT OF THIS FLAWED DEAL. Laura: JOHN KERRY TODAY EXPLAINED WHY HE WAS DOING HIS OWN LITTLE VERSION OF TALKING TO IRAN. UNTIL TODAY, UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS TO
