1
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:14,857
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S X LAWYER,

2
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:15,625
MICHAEL COHEN CLAIMING HE KNEW

3
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:16,392
ABOUT THE MEETING AT THE TRUMP

4
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:18,628
TOWER WITH RUSSIANS IN 2016.

5
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:24,667
HE SAID AFTER BEING TOLD ABOUT

6
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:25,368
A POSSIBLE MEETING, CANADA

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,473
HERE IS GERALDO RIVERA.

8
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:34,510
IS THIS A BIG DEAL?

9
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,611
>> I THINK IT IS A BIG DEAL.

10
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:36,913
I THINK MICHAEL COHEN

11
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,915
REPRESENTS BRIAN, HE REPRESENT

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,116
SIGNIFICANT LEGAL THREAT TO

13
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:44,120
THE PRESIDENT.

14
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:45,221
WE ALL HAVE ONE KEY PERSON WE

15
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,890
TELL ALL OF OUR LIFE STORY TO

16
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,425
AN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CASE HE

17
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:50,259
TRUSTED MICHAEL COHEN, HE WAS

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,662
HIS FIXER FOR MANY YEARS AND

19
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,764
NOW I THINK HE HAS BEEN CUT

20
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:58,734
FROM THE TRUMP TEAM AND HE'S

21
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,403
FEELING RECKLESS AND HE'S EVEN

22
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:04,907
ABLE TO DO DOWN AND DIRTY

23
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,575
THINGS LIKE RELEASE THAT

24
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:10,179
TAPE THE CLIENT AND THEM FOR

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,822
THINK VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT.

26
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:20,556
IF THEY'RE WILLING TO DO THAT

27
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:21,190
THEY'RE WILLING TO DO JUST

28
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,525
ABOUT ANYTHING.

29
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,726
>> IN TERMS OF THE MEETING,

30
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:24,961
VERY SPECIFICALLY.

31
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:26,729
THE ONE WHO HAS HAD THE MOST

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,499
LEGAL PERIL IS DON JUNIOR,

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,368
REMEMBER HE TESTIFIED TO

34
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,836
CONGRESS, IF HE TESTIFIED

35
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:35,705
CONGRESS UNDER OATH THAT THE

36
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:39,108
PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW OF THE

37
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,276
MEETING AND HE HAS A TAPE THAT

38
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,210
SAYS HE DID KNOW THE MEETING

39
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:44,280
AND DONE JUNIOR HAS LIED.

40
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,150
>> WHO HAS MORE CREDIBILITY.

41
00:01:47,151 --> 00:02:00,830
>> I THINK

42
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,531
>> WHO HAS MORE CREDIBILITY.
>> I THINK MICHAEL COHEN ALSO

43
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,465
WENT IN FRONT OF CONGRESS AND

44
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:03,432
SWORN OATH AND I'M SURE HE

45
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,133
DIDN'T SAY THAT DON SENIOR

46
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:04,734
KNEW ABOUT DON JUNIOR'S

47
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:05,101
MEETING.

48
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,470
SON DON JUNIOR.

49
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,204
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS TRY TO

50
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:08,971
MAKE UP STORIES TO GET HIMSELF

51
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:09,772
OUT OF AN UNRELATED JAM,

52
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:14,744
TAXICABS MAY BE, EVEN PAIN

53
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:15,411
BILL AND HILLARY'S CRICKET

54
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:17,346
THERE'S A THEORY OUT THERE

55
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:17,980
HELP TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

56
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:18,614
THERE'S A THEORY OUT THERE

57
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:19,282
THAT RUDY GIULIANI IS TRYING

58
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:19,882
TO DIMINISH THE HAND OF

59
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:20,616
MICHAEL COHEN AND IT WAS THE

60
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,419
TRUMP TEAM THAT RELEASED THE

61
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:23,819
INFORMATION.

62
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,587
DAVIS IS ON INFORMATION THING

63
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,688
WE DIDN'T DO IT.

64
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,323
WHAT YOU THINK.

65
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:27,990
>> WHEN WE GO THROUGH IT

66
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:28,391
AGAIN.

67
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:37,767
TO TAKE, TO TAKE THAT TAPE WAS

68
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:40,336
UNETHICAL AND TO LEAK IT IS A

69
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:43,539
CRIMINAL OFFENSE AND IT'S

70
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,207
CERTAINLY A DESIRABLE EVENT

71
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:44,774
FOR MICHAEL COHEN THE

72
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:45,141
ATTORNEY.

73
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:47,476
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THE

74
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:57,386
RECKLESSLY BROAD SCOPE OF THE

75
00:02:58,789 --> 00:02:59,488
PROBE, YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT

76
00:02:59,489 --> 00:02:59,922
COULD HAPPEN.

77
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:00,623
FOR EXAMPLE, IF PRESIDENT

78
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:01,324
TRUMP KNEW OF THE MEETING IN

79
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:04,627
TRUMP TOWER, IF HE DID, LET'S

80
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:09,799
SAY HE KNEW OF THE MEETING AND

81
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,466
APPROVED OF THE MEETING AND

82
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,167
THEN GOT SOME INFORMATION OR

83
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:15,471
SOMETHING ELSE THE VALUE FROM

84
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:16,239
THE MEETING THAT HE USED

85
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,973
AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON, THAT

86
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:17,506
COULD BE COLLUSION.

87
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:18,274
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ILLEGAL,

88
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:24,213
IT COULD BE CAMPAIGN

89
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:24,914
FINANCE VIOLATION BUT IN THE

90
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:25,648
BROADNESS OF THE SCOPE OF

91
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,383
POSSIBILITIES, MICHAEL COHEN

92
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:28,651
DOES REPRESENT, FOR ALL HIS

93
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:32,154
SLEAZINESS, A THREAT TO THE

94
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:32,588
PRESIDENT.

95
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:33,923
>> YOU ALSO KNOW THEY ARE

96
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,424
INTERVIEWING THE CFO OF THE

97
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,761
TRUMP ORGANIZATION IN THIS

98
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:39,629
GRAND JURY ON MICHAEL COHEN

99
00:03:39,630 --> 00:00:00,000
WHICH GOT HUNTED BY ROBERT
