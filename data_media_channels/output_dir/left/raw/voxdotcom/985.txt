1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,320
Imagine you're on a road trip with your
family.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,740
The year's 1954 and you're black.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,260
Segregation is law in the South and
basically practiced everywhere else in America.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,870
You're traveling down the famed
Route 66 and you've just reached

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,059
Albuquerque, New Mexico for the first
time.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,960
There's not another town for miles and
you want to pull over and sleep for the night.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,920
There are over a hundred motels to
choose from, but less than eight will

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,640
take you in.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,630
Picking the wrong one could
lead to a humiliating encounter or worse,

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,040
a violent one, but there was actually a
way to know where you'd be welcome.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,120
It was in the Green Book.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,300
Americans fell in love with the idea of
the road trip in the mid-20th century.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,760
A growing middle class meant more people
had cars and jobs with paid vacation time.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,220
And a newly built interstate
highway system meant the country was

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,240
accessible to a big part of the
population for the first time.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,840
The open road indicated freedom and traveling by
car reflected Americans' image of

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,380
themselves: self-sufficient, curious, and
spontaneous.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,780
It was a way for families to

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,240
spend time together and see the
expansive country they called home, to

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,500
experience America's cultural and
natural diversity.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,830
Through the 1950s and

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,640
'60s, the highway became the most common
way for American families to travel.

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,690
Motels and roadside attractions sprang
up along the highway to accommodate

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,240
travelers needing a place to sleep or
eat at any point on their journey.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,660
But that freedom didn't extend to all
Americans.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,320
Black motorists were turned

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,170
away from the roadside hotels, gas
stations, and restaurants that had taken

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,540
over the American landscape.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,190
Some places were so hostile that it was unsafe to

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,540
even get out of a car.

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,820
Sundown towns forcibly expelled African Americans at night,

32
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,480
sometimes violently.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,000
Black families had to take prepared food, in case they

34
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,460
wouldn't find a restaurant that would
serve them, extra gallons of gasoline in

35
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,300
case filling stations wouldn't sell to
them, and even empty coffee tins in case

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,000
they couldn't access a bathroom.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,930
They carried blankets and pillows knowing

38
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,860
that finding a safe place to sleep could
mean camping by the roadside or driving

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,450
long hours into the night, even though
they had money to pay for a hotel.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
Sometimes, that distance was fatal.

41
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,399
It was the exact opposite of the spontaneous

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,220
American road trip.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,200
But thanks to a Harlem 
postal-worker-turned-travel agent,

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
knowing where to go wasn't a total shot
in the dark.

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,000
In 1936 Victor Hugo Greene collected information
on hotels, restaurants, beauty salons, and

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,460
mechanic shops that would reliably serve
African Americans in New York City.

47
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,170
He called his Travel Guide "The Negro
Motorist Green-Book" and began publishing

48
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,680
an updated version each year,

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,280
using his network at the United States Postal Service,

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,440
which was one of the largest
single employers of African Americans at

51
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:37,020
the time.

52
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,150
Green put together detailed
information on businesses and private

53
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,940
homes that would welcome black travelers.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,620
The Green Book eventually grew to cover

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,360
locations in all 50 States and sold ad
space to businesses all over the country.

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,480
With the help of Esso, now ExxonMobil, as
a progressive corporate partner and

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,680
distributor of the guides, around 15,000
copies of the Green Book started selling

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,380
each year.

59
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,920
Victor Greene's once-16-page booklet ballooned

60
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,610
to over a hundred pages and became a
stable item for black families who

61
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,400
wanted to participate in the joy of
cross-country travel.

62
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,860
And it turns out

63
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,549
that iconic image of the open road, of
freedom and family values, would become

64
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,240
an anchor in the Civil Rights movement.

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,150
Dr. Martin Luther King even mentions it

66
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,760
in his "I have a dream" speech.

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,879
The Civil Rights Act ended legal segregation

68
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,119
in 1964 and just two years later the
Green Book went out of print.

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,340
It had become obsolete.

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,360
And as the road cut
through the broad plains, you felt the

71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,960
tremendous space all around you. A
country rolling out to the horizon,

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,020
and you rolling with it.

73
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,740
It was beautiful and you
sort of sensed the real meaning behind

74
00:03:56,740 --> 00:00:00,000
the word "freedom".
