one of the biggest ironies of the social justice movement is that every buzzword doesn't quite mean what it seems to mean or even means the exact opposite just like how in 1984 Wars peace and freedom is slavery in social justice equity or equality of outcome means treating people unequally based on surface level criteria to get a certain result and being inclusive of some things means being exclusive of others one University is urging students to be inclusive of how they use emojis by excluding certain emojis let's take a look so Colorado State University recently published a guide called 10 ways to make your social media channels more inclusive this is like one of those clickbait BuzzFeed articles but without the bait it's not even shiny trash it's just trash number 2 says use the yellow emojis when addressing a diverse audience this is actually very curious most people probably use the yellow one because it's the default but if you were thinking about it from a racial perspective wouldn't yellow be Asian you would think Colorado State would want you to use yellow black white whatever else they have in equal proportions and what about red I don't think there's any Native American emoji this is a problem that absolutely needs to be solved the school neck says avoid gendered emojis when possible instead use one of the variations of the yellow smiley faces or object emojis so you're going to suggest a certain color I use advised me not to use certain genders you can already see how this is not very inclusive now I know at this point you might be thinking so shim shock the guy who wrote this he must be a real fruitcake but not so fast they must be a real fruitcake if you follow suggestion number 1 which says used inclusive pronouns they them there's students Rams their mascot everyone then there's this next one which for some reason really irritated me on a gut level use people first language person with a disability versus disabled unless the person indicates another preference um no I'm not going to contort my vocabulary using extra six syllables and use a noun instead of an adjective just to fit your perverted worldview sorry not gonna happen perhaps the only one of Colorado State's guidelines you should follow is number eight authentically represent diversity you can do this of course by saying diversity as it's currently valued is a sham hocus-pocus hogwash because it focuses on all the different flavors of shallow surface level variety but not a multitude of personalities thoughts you know the stuff that really matters and it prevents you from using cool emojis for campus unmasked I'm Rob Jim Shaw if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
