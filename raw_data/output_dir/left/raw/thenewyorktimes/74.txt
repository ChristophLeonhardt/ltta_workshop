00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
Michael Cohen,
President Trump’s

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,750
former personal lawyer,
went from this:

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,630
“I’ll do anything to
protect Mr. Trump.”

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,810
“They say I’m
Mr. Trump’s pit bull.”

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,560
“I’ve stood by him,
shoulder to shoulder.”

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,230
To this: “Shock waves
after President Trump’s

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,280
former attorney
Michael Cohen ...”

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,150
“Michael Cohen, pleading guilty
and implicating the president ...”

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,240
“... possibly the worst day in
Donald Trump’s presidency

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,440
thus far.”

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,400
So why did one of Trump’s
most trusted advisers flip?

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,910
Cohen was known for being Trump’s
fixer and biggest defender.

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,549
“If there’s an issue that
relates to Mr. Trump

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,900
that is of concern to him,

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,930
it’s of course of 
concern to me.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,840
And I will use my legal
skills within which

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,300
to protect Mr. Trump to
the best of my ability.”

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,940
In April, the F.B.I.
raided Cohen’s office

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,100
after he became a target

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,740
in special counsel Robert
Mueller’s investigation.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,500
Trump was quick to come
to Cohen’s defense.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,060
But once the investigation
zeroed in on Cohen,

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,090
the lawyer began
to change his tune.

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,930
“My wife, my daughter and my
son have my first loyalty

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,250
and always will.

26
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,100
I put family and
country first.”

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,700
In July, Cohen released
audio from a conversation

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,940
with Donald Trump
that he secretly recorded

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,720
two months before
the 2016 election.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,460
The two appear to be
discussing payments

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,500
to a former Playboy
model who said

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,720
she had an affair
with Trump.

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,580
Here’s when things
between Trump and Cohen

34
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,070
began to publicly fall apart.

35
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,820
“I expected something
like this from Cohen,

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,720
he’s been lying all week.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,650
I mean, for two —
he’s been lying for years.

38
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,850
There’s nobody that I know
that knows him

39
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,590
that hasn’t warned me that if
his back is up against the wall,

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,620
he will lie like crazy,
because he’s lied all his life.”

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,860
On Aug. 21, Cohen
pleaded guilty to violating

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,320
federal campaign
finance laws and said

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,229
President Trump directed him
to make payments to two women

44
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,150
during the 2016 campaign
to avoid a potential sex scandal.

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,350
Cohen’s lawyer
suggested he knew more.

46
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,800
“Mr. Cohen has knowledge
on certain subjects

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,400
that should be of interest
to the special counsel

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,220
and is more than happy
to tell the special counsel

49
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,070
all that he knows.”

50
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,330
Trump tried to play down
the momentous admission

51
00:02:30,330 --> 00:00:00,000
via Twitter.
