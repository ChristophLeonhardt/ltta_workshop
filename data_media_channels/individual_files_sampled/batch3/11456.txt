in the UK a prominent Conservative Party politicians under fire after he made a joking reference to Libyan Jacob Riis MOG called the African state the People's Republic of jam jar or something as he put it at the Conservative Party's annual conference this is quite a bizarre comment to be heard from a well-known politician referencing an another nation this was indeed hardline brexit ear and Tory MP Jacob Riis MOG speaking on the sidelines of the annual Conservative Party conference and what he was actually referencing was the great socialist people's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya which is roughly translated as a state of masses and that's what the North African nation of Libya used to be called under Muammar Qaddafi yet he chose those words instead and reaction was very Swift to follow Deary me Jacob Riis mug your first attempt at global diplomacy has failed an abyss of casual racism did you and Boris Johnson have the same geography teacher at Eton College maybe now is the time to learn some respect for other countries little Englander jacob riis MOG shows his disdain for the rest of the world this tawdry Tory government has had its time Britain deserves better than this inward-looking bunch of unworldly has-beens and never worse this sort of remark is becoming too common from the brexit ears coming as it does in the wake of Boris's recent burqa jibes insulting other people is not the way I want my country represented and the public see it for what it is petty politics the reason those Boris Johnson burka jives and Boris Johnson in general get mentioned in a few of those reactions is because former UK Foreign Secretary has himself come under fire on many occasions for quite controversial comments with the burkas he had just recently compared women wearing them to letter boxes causing quite a bit of controversy here in the UK but with these latest comments on Libya they do seem quite strange indeed especially given the rule that britain had played in the destiny of libya as a nation Arab writer and journalist Abdul Bari at one believes this kind of language can be heard all through British politics and society themselves ashamed of themselves because actually they interfered by by military means to destroy countries under false accusation and they use this which we discover it is a pure lie and then we repeat the same thing and attack Libya change a regime there and let the country is completely an arcane this is the problem of British people sorry british politician they should be ashamed of themselves we should actually realise that the separate country African countries are aware of what is happening in the world and they don't believe all the talks about democracy or about human rights you
