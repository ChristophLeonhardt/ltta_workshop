Zuzu's in denmark are asking people to donate their unwanted pets to feed their lions and tigers we're not doing a tough for people way to kill their pets we did because we need the animals people are emotional so we spend a lot of time telling them what is about to happen I think people would prefer something meaningful rather than just having them put down and incinerate it well Daniel Hawkins talked to the animal rights activist made me beg Hetchy who says that zoos care more about their revenues than they do their animals this does happen in nature animals are hunted animals are eaten and torn apart you know we do see it on Animal Planet on wildlife documentaries surely that just is something that happens in animals natural life cycle in a pyramid of you know of food of the food chain of course it is and you know there's I'm not suggesting otherwise I'm not suggesting that that doesn't happen in nature but what I'm saying is that when you are the Guardian for an animal in fact that there's a responsibility that comes along with that and that's a responsibility too to protect it to care for that animal and when the time comes to ensure that they don't suffer so that concept of responsible animal guardianship is completely contrary to the idea of taking your animal companion to the zoo to be served up as a lions dinner absolutely sickening but it can show people what zoos are really about they're not institutions that care about animals they're institutions that care about making money at the expense of their welfare and their well-being how would you propose that people deal with pets that either you know crippled are going to die soon perhaps die in pain anyway or be a man a lot of streets I mean surely this is just giving people another option as to - what to do with their pets ooh perhaps you know have been loved and looked after but I've come to the end of their natural life cycle well I have three cats myself who are very loved and very well looked after and when the time comes when their lives are clearly over then I will ensure that they're humanely euthanized so that they never have to suffer for a day in their lives and most people who have animals who are responsible guardians would do the same because to be honest the thought of taking my cats to a zoo so that they can be torn apart by lions that is the most grotesque idea and I'm sure that most people who have animals whether it's cats or rabbits or dogs or any other animal that they share their home with who they consider to be part of their family would feel the exact same way zoos in Denmark already have something of a reputation when it comes to educating about wildlife Copenhagen zoo caused controversy back in 2014 when it slaughtered a giraffe here in front of spectators before feeding it to the Lions and another zoo in their dense dissected a lion in front of school children after it wasn't able to find another facility to adopt it
