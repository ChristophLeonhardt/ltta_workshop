I mean Alma owed the PR chief for Palestine house led a rally last summer that was brimming with hateful anti-semitic slogans including chants of quote Israel and Hitler are the same end quote he someone that surely deserves condemnation so why was it that Liberal MP ich werde Khalid recently presented al maid with a certificate of appreciation ah good old Iraqi lead she's back in the news again for all the wrong reasons again this time the author of the anti Islamophobia motion m103 was caught red-handed giving a certificate of appreciation to an alleged anti-semite that would be a mean el mode that's kind of odd don't you think folks I mean Palestine houses el mode doesn't seem to buy into that Trudeau peein mantra of diversity is our strength what with comparing Israel to Hitler or wait a second now maybe there is indeed a place for Jew haters on the Justin Trudeau diversity spectrum these days gee if only Ernest sundel were still around to see this and it's also odd that a quick lead is someone who campaigns tires Lee against hatred especially hatred towards Muslims given that her m103 assault on free speech specifically points to Islamophobia as opposed to any other phobia or ism hey all hatred is equal it's just that some hatred is more equal than others got it regardless al modes award did not go unnoticed in a letter to Khalid B'nai B'rith CEO Michael moist and stated quote it's not only disappointing but frightening that you would see fit to reward his dalliance 'as with anti-semitic discourse and incitement while simultaneously ostensibly working to eliminate all forms of discrimination in Canada there is simply no reconciling these two worlds presenting L my ode with official recognition on behalf of the Canadian government both sanitizes and normalizes the anti-semitic rhetoric and attitudes that he has pervade and facilitated end quote indeed the fact that L mood heads-up Palestine house should have immediately raised red flags to I mean after all Palestine House which describes itself as an educational social and cultural center of the Palestinian Canadian community actually lost all of its federal funding in 2012 when the Harper Conservatives determined that this organization exhibited a quote pattern of a support for extremism end quote oops but I'm sure that little slap on the wrist escaped equids attention to besides it happened like so long ago right anyway the media got hold of this story about Elmo getting an award and a crush well she sure had some splainin to do at first she took refuge in the cone of silence but she finally did spin-doctor a statement about that little mistake of giving an anti-semite a government award first she apologized that's good secondly she rescinded the award excellent thirdly she condemned the hateful comments now that's a hat-trick when it comes to damage control 101 folks hey you got to give credit where credit is due even to the likes of ikura but then well she overplayed her hand for here is what she said in a prepared statement quote I was not aware of some of Amin L modes past views and only he can speak to them but we all must stand against anti-semitism and discrimination in all its forms end quote hmm not aware of his views eh wait a second it's not like Al mode is a stranger to Khalid after all just last April she presented him with another award on behalf of Prime Minister Trudeau it was at an event that featured a Palestinian archbishop who had allegedly defended terrorists and suicide bombings double oops oh and check this out Bonet breath Canada's petition points out that L mood posted a message to his Facebook page earlier this year thanking Khalid for inviting him to her home where he was presented with a birthday cake G they just can't stop giving this guy stuff and I don't know about you but it seems to me that Khalid has a a little relationship going on with Elmo and yet we're all expected to believe that L mood is just some stranger or acquaintance of colleagues and that we're all expected to believe that she had no idea whatsoever about his odious beliefs and statements anyone in the market for a bridge that might be up for sale in a certain New York borough sorry Khalid but to put it politely my olfactory organ is detecting the distinct scent of polyester slacks combusting into flames right now in other words better luck next time for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
