well the election is almost upon us and it's up to each and every citizen to make the choice whether the country is going to be utterly screwed or screwed utterly whether we're going to careen swiftly toward the cliff of destruction with a corrupt woman at the wheel or whether we'd prefer a man whether we're going to continue on the path to tyranny and mediocrity or whether we'll stop off at mediocrity first and then head on to tyranny after lunch to help you make this important decision the Andrew Clavin show has collected a series of test questions that should train you to recognize which choice is worse here we go which is worse a to elect a president who has mistreated women disparage minorities and proposed idiotic policies that will continue America's decline or be to vote for Donald Trump and get all that plus the comical hair which is worse a to have our news media rightly denounced Donald Trump for his disgusting treatment of women or B to have our news media rightly denounced Trump while being the same news media that gives Hillary Clinton the pass for persecuting her husband's rape victims or C to have our news media which is worse a to live in a country where women openly read Fifty Shades of Grey a pornographic sex fantasy in which a horrible rich guy violently abuses a woman and she gets off on it or be to have those woman women put the book aside just long enough to denounce Donald Trump for actually being the guy they're fantasizing about which is worse hey to live in a country that has ceased to love God and therefore men have no honor and women have no virtue or B to live in a country that continues to love God where men do have honor and women do have virtue and then discover you're in Saudi Arabia which is worse a to have to admit you are a flaming idiot when you call ben shapiro a conservative because he wouldn't support Trump or B to be such a flaming idiot that you don't even realize how big a flaming idiot you are which is worse a that the next Supreme Court Justice appointed by a president who opposes the first second and fifth amendments or be to have the next Supreme Court Justice appointed by a president who's never read the first second and fifth amendments but at least can grab a woman by the crotch and get away with it so I guess that's something which is worse a to be a patriotic freedom-loving American during election 2016 or be to be a patriotic freedom-loving American who has run over by a cement truck and left lying helpless by the side of the road and then the psychedelic bus pulls up beside you and a large party of evil zombie clowns gets out and they begin to feed on your body from the feet up so that you're alive through every agonizing and terrifying second right up until your very last breath when you softly whisper that was bad but not as bad as election 2016 trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Klavan show so we need also sing shake it see top see the world as if it easing it's a wonderful what the hell is going on these clay vilas weekends are getting so bad that even I can't stand them and they're not Clavin list for me this is like terrible but we're back so that something yeah when Lindsay is back Lindsay you know lindsay has made this entire show this this little sign you may didn't you that's that was your sign originally scored our theme song maybe you made that whole all the music and I theme song what else did you do you did something else you what boo hoo yes of course we while you're here you have to record your whoo and we'll have live Iran to way but we don't have a run to wave until the guys who haven't subscribed to the site or tossed off facebook and youtube well I know it's incredible as if i seemed distracted this is what all right we're going to talk plenty o culture we have fixed we have fixed our incredible technology to get Michael Knowles our cultural correspondent we will not have the problem we had last time where you couldn't hear him you will be able to hear them could be worse I'm not sure and I'm going to tell a ghost story i'm gonna tell one of my favorite ghost stories it takes about two minutes to tell and it'll be for halloween stuff i like so I cannot believe the level to which this campaign has now flushed itself like I have to you know I actually woke up at four o'clock this morning and started thinking about Donald Trump and the stuff said in this video tape and first of all I have to we're kind of living in feminist logic world now right feminist logic is like three points of feminist logic 1 women are exactly the same as men to men stink three you have to respect women I'm not sure that really holds together system of logic so now Donald Trump comes out and it you know they catch him on this tape on this bus talking to Billy Bush and I'm going to be absolutely bluntly honest they are talking like men talk when men are together it is a form of swaggering it is not the best thing about us it is the way guys talk and he's from New York I'm from New York people from New York talked a little bit rougher than the people in the rest of the country and that is the way he saw listen none of this none of this is new information Donald Trump is a lowlife Donald Trump commits adultery and brags about it bad enough to commit adultery anybody can have a problem but to brag about he brags about it he did it in both of his books he brought in two of his books I believe I know he did it in the art of the deal which is his best-selling book he brags about committing adultery he brags about the way he treats women he has violent tendencies he's ignorant he doesn't prepare for anything he's arrogant he's all these things but we knew all that already this tape comes out and gives us nothing and the hypocrisy is is just stylist we're going to play it we I'm sure everybody has heard it by now but let's play a little bit of it with all the bad words cut out I moved in her like a I couldn't get there and she was married and all of a sudden I see her she's now got the big phony and she's totally changed her looks she's your girls hottish in the purple whoa whoa yes oh my man maybe it's a different world no its service yeah that's her with a gold I'm gonna use some tape deck just in case they start kissing her you know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them it's like a magnet I don't even wait anyone your star they let you do it you can do anything whatever you want grabbed by the put have to do any of that and and poor Billy Bush has now been suspended what is he the police he's supposed to stop him from you know like you're sitting there with this big star and you're supposed to stop and I mean it's just I'm sorry it's the hypocrisy that's killing me like suddenly the left has discovered purity I mean these are people who are trying to let men use women's bathrooms who are trying to tell us that every form of perversion that you can possibly think of it's just the way your hey this is just told from sexuality he's he should start a movement for bores you know like boiled boar liberation I mean you know it's just this is the media the media is going to come out and tell us he's gonna tell us that Donald Trump is nasty to women so the media that has been protecting Hillary Clinton as he goes out of his way to say but I just want to pause for just a minute and think back on Teddy Kennedy Teddy Kennedy who left look there's no question about this he drove a woman probably a woman he was trying to seduce we don't know that for sure but he drove a young woman into the drink into the water off Chappaquiddick and he left her there and he went and he changed his clothes probably to establish an alibi he chatted amiably with friends while she was in the car you know they never got to do an autopsy on her because they buried her too quick but there's every indication that she was on the car pounding on the windows trying to get out while he was established I just like when he died here's the ABC news first 30 seconds of the ABC news report on Teddy Kennedy's death Ted Kennedy is gone for millions of Americans it's hard to imagine so long had the youngest of the nine children of the Kennedy clan blazedd forth on the center stage of American politics edward moore kennedy died of brain cancer a little before midnight tuesday at the age of 77 at his home at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport Massachusetts he was dubbed the Lion of the Senate serving in that body for an amazing 46 years the third longest tenure ever now John Donvan looks bad at the liberal who roared to liberal the line at the cell why I ni guess the Lion of the Senate I mean come on you protected this dirtbag who was having affairs on his wife constantly they protect you know he's in millions of Americans mourned I don't think there are millions of Americans in the press I think it may be all that all the media more so now they're gonna tell us that Donald Trump is a bad guy and also this goes for the people the Republicans too by the way the guys who endorsed him with enthusiasm the guys who said this is a good person and now suddenly oh my goodness oh you know now throwing their seat bruise over their faces and running from the room you know the paul ryan and listen I love Paul Ryan I respect Paul Ryan he says what did he say oh I'm sickened by what I heard women are to be championed and revered not objectify now we've got to revere what are we a fertility cult I mean I have to revere women I mean look you know all this stuff works as long as you have ladies and gentlemen that culture is so long gone from every place but my house that is a culture is so long on it you just can't hold this guy up so Trump does he's got the debate coming up everybody's expecting to get creamed Trump pulls a surprise attack I thought it was actually brilliant and he brings on three of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of not only mistreating them but of that but they've also accused Hillary Clinton of coming after them for doing it and this new one he's got Kathy Shelton who Hillary Clinton defended the guy who was accused of raping her when she was 12 so this is just Kathy Sheldon part of this this facebook press conference he holds at 12 years old Hillary put me through something that you would never been 12 year old through and she says she's for women and children when she was asked last year what happened and she says she's supposed to defend whether they did or not now she's laughing on say things you know they did it okay now if I haven't alienated the people who you know hate Donald Trump already now I'm going to a lien 8 people who love Donald Trump this story is also garbage this story is garbage Hillary Clinton was appointed to defend as a young attorney a judge appointed her to defend the guy who was accused of raping this young girl that's her job that's what a defense attorney has to do when the judge tells you and you're a young lawyer you have to do it you don't say no judge I can't do that she was appointed to do this she took it the case had a lot of bad evidence was bad the stories were messed up the woman herself was not you know was not unimpeachable she negotiated a plea deal for this clown where he got five years but the judge gave him four years off and two months off so he served like 10 months in the county jail something like this they say she laughs about this it's not true in an interview she did in the 80s the case was 75 and into You she did in the 80s here's the clip that everybody talks about her laughing she's talking about this her defense of this guy you really Christmas from with the daughter of a family sized track and God green force tends to hella fine he was one of the wasn't there make a living on the land in the regular course he client is a lot of it so she's laughing because the polygraph he passed the piracy knew he was guilty I mean so that yeah you know I don't know I that to me that's not so bad she laughs another time and it you know that she got off the sky she helped this guy got off you didn't help him get off and she didn't that's not what she was laughing about you know I'm sorry Hillary Clinton is every inch as bad as Donald Trump he's dishonest she's greedy she is you know so ambitious as to have lost all sense of right and wrong in her life she lied she has a glitch in her head in the same way Trump has this glitch where he has to defend them selfie is this glitch where she lies even when you don't need to lie she lies about anything she's a terrible person this tape also is nonsense that you know I mean the truth the truth is the Trump tape is nonsense and this is nonsense so now they go on to the debate and Trump won I did Trump didn't win he like I thought thought he kind of trumped her I thought he kind of trounced her basically and he won in two ways one is he did exactly what I said he should do my wife came in and said do you think listen to you they were actually listening to the show they may be you know because what i said is he/she attacks him he turns it around and attacks her and this worked in two ways the first way is the personal way because she comes out get sun that they all get on the tape they all pylon and he turns it around with the bill clinton thing and now who can tell him he doesn't have the right to bring this up who can tell him this is not fair game anymore so here's him turning on bill on the bill if you look at bill clinton far worse minor words and his was action his was what he's done to women there's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women so you can say any way you want to say it but bill clinton was abusive to women Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them here tonight one of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12 her client she represented got him off and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped Kathy Shelton that young woman is here with us tonight so don't tell me about words I am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say but what President Clinton did he was impeached he lost his license to practice law he had to pay an eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine to one of the women Paula Jones who's also here tonight and I will tell you that when Hilary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago I think it's disgraceful and I think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth I'm sorry but that's a good response at this perfectly fair response because the whole point about Trump is that is not that he's any good it's that she's just as bad and the media covers for her and that makes her look even worse we got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube but come over to the daily wire and hear the rest we got a lot more coming up
