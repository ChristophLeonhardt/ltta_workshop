starts with starting with joy read in for Rachel giving joy good evening Chris and by the way you didn't get to go to your own party but congratulations on the Emmy thank you very much thanks a lot I appreciate it thank you very very very much night all right thank you Chris and thanks to you at home for joining in this hour rachel has the night off but she will be back tomorrow she will be back tomorrow I promise I know you if you were keeping notes on the twists and turns in the ongoing story of the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh your best bet would have been to take those notes in pencil because the story has changed directions multiple times since the dramatic testimony of Christine Blasi Ford who accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school and the angry confrontational testimony of Cavanaugh himself and that was just this past Thursday there's been a ton of breaking news since then including today even just in the last couple of hours and we have a lot to get to regarding the state of play as it stands tonight but first let's briefly recap the whiplash that we've gone through over the past few days on Friday at the moment that the Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to vote quickly along party lines to advance Cavanaugh's nomination the process was suddenly thrown into disarray when Republican Senator Jeff Flake made an unexpected last-minute deal with the committee Democrats to secure a one-week delay in the full Senate vote during which the FBI would look into dr. Ford's allegations and possibly into other allegations too it was not really clear at the time later that day we learned that the White House had indeed ordered the FBI but on Saturday NBC News was first to report that the White House had sharply limited the scope of the FBI's investigation telling the FBI it could investigate Christine Blasi Ford's claims and those of Deborah Ramirez who has publicly accused Brett Kavanaugh of shoving his genitalia in her face at a party when they were both college students at Yale but not the claims from Julie sweat Nick who has accused Kavanaugh of engaging in sexual misconduct at parties when he was in high school a high school student in the 1980s the New York Times reported that day that the White House was only allowing the FBI to interview four people mark judge Cavanaugh's friend whom dr. Ford claims was an accomplice in the alleged assault two other people whom she claims were at the gathering where the assault allegedly occurred and Deborah Ramirez the Yale accuser on Saturday night Donald Trump tweeted that NBC was wrong quote actually I want the FBI to interview whom ever they deem appropriate at their discretion priests corrector reporting exclamation point but on Sunday NBC reported that despite those comments but limits to the FBI's investigation remained unchanged and that the FBI had received no new instructions from the White House meanwhile the New Yorkers Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer who broke the story of Deborah Ramirez this allegation were reporting yesterday that several potential witnesses were attempting to contact the FBI to pass on what they thought might be useful information but we're having no luck for instance one Yale classmate attempting to coordinate to corroborate Ramirez's claim quote had hoped to convey this to the FBI but when he reached out to a bureau official in Washington DC he was told to contact the FBI field office nearest his home when he tried that he was referred to a recording after several attempts to reach a live person at the field office he finally reached an official who said he had no idea what he was talking about at this point he went back to the official at the FBI's DC headquarters who then referred him to an 800 number tip line he eventually left a tip there online portal last night Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein asked the White House and the FBI to hand over whatever directive the White House had given the FBI out loaning outlining the scope of the investigation by this morning she and eight of her Democratic colleagues on the committee had signed on to a letter demanding a full investigation and specifically asking that the FBI look into the claims of Julie sweat Nick as well and at a press conference in the Rose Garden this morning the president seemed to agree I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer it's for clarity will you instruct the White House Counsel Don McGann to give the FBI free rein to interview whomever they feel is necessary well I have so instructed him and I did it again over the weekend so just to be clear should the FBI interview all three of Brett Cavanaugh's accusers it wouldn't bother me at all and at that point it still seemed to be this strange case of Donald Trump saying one thing in his white house continuing to instruct the FBI to do something else until finally a couple hours later The Times reported that a new directive had come down from the White House walking back the restrictions and telling the FBI to interview anyone necessary for their investigation got all that now this would all be confusing enough if everyone involved wasn't racing against an artificial clock that runs out this Friday the latest the Republicans have agreed to postpone the vote on Cavanaugh's nomination and by the way ask for that time line Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell took to the Senate floor today to make it clear that there will be no delay in that timeline that the Senate will vote on Brett Cavanaugh's nomination by the end of the week come hell or high water and also pre scolding Democrats for what he insists will be a cynical disingenuous arguments at the end of the week so soon I expect we'll hear that the conclusions of the expert prosecutor who questioned both witnesses at last week's hearing aren't reliable or that the FBI's investigation was not infinite or endless enough for their liking maybe we'll hear the real issue is not these uncorroborated allegations of misconduct after all but rather the fact that Judge Cavanaugh now listen to this drank beer in high school and in college well now that you mention it the drinking is in fact a major sticking point for a lot of people and not just Senate Democrats several of Cavanaugh's college classmates have come forward to allege that he was a heavy sloppy drinker in college and know the issue is not whether or not Kavanagh drank a lot in his youth something that pretty much everyone including the Senate Democrats appear willing to forgive its ave claim he has repeatedly blatantly lied about it most recently a Yale classmate of Cavanaugh's named Chad Ludington issued a statement saying that while he has - he has quote nothing to contribute about what kind of justice he would be in recent days I have become deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale quote Brett was a frequent drinker and a heavy drinker I know because especially in our first two years of college I often drank with him on many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption not all of which was beer when Brett Cavett when Brett got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive on one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett I witnessed him respond to a semi hostile remark not by diffusing the situation but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail I do not believe that the heavy drinking or even loudest behavior of an 18 or even 21 year old should condemn a person for the rest of his life but quote I can unequivocally say that denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking brett has not told the truth Chadd Ludington ended his statement by saying that he would quote take my information to the FBI and that brings us to the first bit of late-breaking news tonight something that may give us a bit of a window into the scope of the FBI investigation now that the restrictions have ostensibly been taken off by the White House that altercation that mr. Ludington described in which Brett Kavanaugh allegedly threw a beer at someone and started a fight well tonight the New York Times reports that there is indeed a police report documenting that incident and judge Cavanaugh's involvement quote the incident which occurred in September 1985 during mr. Cavanaugh is junior year resulted in mr. Cavanaugh and four other men being questioned by the New Haven Police Department mr. Cavanaugh was unarrested but the police report stated that a 21 year old man accused mr. Cavanaugh of throwing ice on him for some unknown reason a witness to the fight said that Chris Dudley a Yale basketball player who is friends with mr. Cavanaugh then threw a glass that hit the 21-year old man in the ear according to the police report the report said that the victim was bleeding from the right ear and was later treated at a local hospital mr. Dudley denied the allegation according to the report but for his part speaking to the officers mr. Cavanaugh did not want to say if he threw the ice or not the police report said the report referred to the altercation which occurred at a bar called des Murray's as an assault it did not say whether anyone was arrested and there is no indication that charges were filed The Times is also reporting tonight the Chad Ludington who first described this incident said that he has been in touch with the FBI the other thing that's worth noting about this story tonight Chris Dudley the Cavanaugh friend and classmate who was accused by a witness of throwing a glass and injuring another bar patron in his fight and accusation he denies Chris Dudley is one of two people who issued statements distributed by the White House today attesting to Brett Cavanaugh's character in a statement today Chris Dudley said that he and Cavanaugh quote drank in college I was with Brett frequently in college whether it be in the gym in class or socializing I never saw a Brett blackout not one time and in all the years I've known him I have never seen him to be disrespectful or inappropriate with women I would also like to point out that going out never came before working hard and maintaining our focus on our goals the person sometimes being described in the press is not the Brett Kavanaugh that I have known as a good friend for 35 years all of which may be true even if the two of them were involved in an ill-advised bar fight but as you could see new information is coming out fast and furious so that that's one piece of breaking news and here's another earlier this evening senator Susan Collins one of the key Republican votes Cavanaugh needs to be confirmed join Democrats in calling for the FBI to investigate not just the claims of Christine Blasi Ford and Deborah Ramirez but also Julie sweat Nick the woman who alleges that she was at parties in the early 1980s where she saw Brett Kavanaugh engage in sexual misconduct and who claimed that she herself was gang-raped at such a party though she does not accuse Kavanaugh of being one of her attackers and we still don't know at this point whether the FBI is looking into those claims but Julie sweat Nick has given her first sit-down interview to NBC News's Kate snow and let's show you a little clip of that can you describe to me what you saw him do he was very aggressive very sloppy drunk very mean drunk I saw him go up to girls and paw on them try to you know get a little too handsy touching them in private parts I saw him try to shift clothing are there people yes I live today yes my yeah I have those parties yes there are people that know about those party now I do need to tell you tonight that tonight as of tonight NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate sweating exclaims and when NBC News asks what Nick's attorney Michael avenatti for any witnesses who could back up sweatin account he provided four names of friends whose sweat Nick says went to parties with her one of them says that he does not recall anyone named Julie sweat Nick friends is deceased NBC News has reached out to the other two and has not yet heard back so what Knicks mother's name was also provided but she too is deceased so that's where that's where that part of the story stands tonight and we have one more bit of new breaking news for you another scoop from NBC News the headline quote text messages suggest Kavanaugh wanted to refute accusers claim before it became public this is from NBC's Heidi prism and lan caldwell quote in the days leading up to a public allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to a college classmate the judge and his team were communicating behind the scenes with friends to refute the claim according to text messages obtained by NBC News Kerry Burcham who was at Yale with both Kavanagh and his accuser Deborah Ramirez has tried to get those messages to the FBI for its newly reopened investigation into the matter but says she has yet to be contacted by the bureau the texts show Kavanaugh may need to be questioned about how far back he anticipated that Ramirez would air allegations against him Berchem says in her memo that Kavanaugh and/or his friends may have initiated an anticipatory narrative as early as July to conceal and disorders credit Ramirez Cavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that the first time he heard about Ramirez his allegation was in the September 23 article in The New Yorker and joining us now is NBC News political reporter Lynn Caldwell one of the reporters on this brand-new story Leanne thanks so much for joining us thank you Joey so Leanne just walk us through how early do these text messages go back to they in fact go back to July short joy so what we've seen we have not seen all of the text messages we've only seen the text messages that were outlined in this memo that Carrie Bertram wants to submit to the FBI and this is again one more instance of someone who wants to talk to the FBI but hasn't been able to she is part of a group of friends who went to Yale undergrad with Cavanaugh and Ramirez they're in the same group of people and she says that she has reached out to the FBI times and has not heard back now that the FBI says that they're going to expand this investigation she's more hopeful that they will reach out but as a couple hours ago they have not yet so what she wants to do is she wants to present up to 51 text messages that she is hatched that she has between her and her friend Karen near savage so Karen and and Carrie they both went to Yale with Kavanaugh and these text messages rained from July to September and what they do show around September when this New Yorker story was coming out that Karen saying that Brett and or Brett's guy has reached out anticipating that the Ramirez allegations would come out and we taught that we talked to an expert on this someone Brett Bauer who is a former White House Counsel in the Obama administration he says it's just very strange that they would allow Brett to reach out on his own he says usually when there's nominations like this they have a team of people to do it and they say it's bad PR and that they don't recommend that the nominee itself do their own bidding and so that's one thing that's strange we mirror bertram says that she wants to talk to the FBI and she's hoping she's able to do that before that investigation closes by the end of this week and do we have any way of knowing whether this was Brett Kavanaugh going back through his life and saying who this might be something that happened that I need to clean up let me have my friends reach out or whether this was a result of him being you know maybe reached out to for comment by The New Yorker and then responding to that is there a way of knowing sort of what how he knew that this story might be coming yeah the text what we have we don't know we don't know which it is it could be either or and but we do know is that Ramirez and Cavanaugh they knew each other more than what was previously reported we did publish a photo of Cavanaugh and Ramirez from this they were in the same wedding party in 1997 ten years after they graduated and Berchem said that in her text messages that she was when she was talking to her friend Aaron saying that it now makes a lot of sense why were Mehra's was acting so strange at that wedding she seemed like she was kind of the fish out of water and that she was trying to stay as far away from Kavanagh as possible and so again I want to bring this back to this is something that she that she wants to tell the FBI and she's hoping the FBI does its due diligence and it's talking to everyone that should be talked to in this scenario yeah indeed will even call well thank you very much great reporting NB c news reporter really appreciate you tonight thank you anyway hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the
