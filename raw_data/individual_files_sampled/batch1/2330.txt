in the 1970s fiat cars had such a bad reputation for unreliability Americans joked the name stood for fix it again Tony but company left the market in 1983 not to be heard from again until 2011 when they came back stateside with the this is the 2013 Fiat 500 apart the more powerful even more stylish version of the standard Fiat 500 the base price of the apart is 22,000 compared to just 16,000 for the standard 500 well if extras like satellite radio 17-inch white wheels and a Beats Audio system the total price of this one comes out to twenty-seven thousand six hundred dollars we quickly realize the Abart is a ton of fun to drive even in New York City it's small just over twelve feet long so it's easy to park and change lanes quick the turbo charged 1.4 liter engine pumps out a hundred sixty horsepower and you can really hear it but the Abart does have its downside with just four inches of clearance above the ground you feel every pothole the only transmission available for the apart is a 5-speed manual which will alienate a lot of American drivers unlike the smart car which is also a nice choice for the city the Abart actually comes with a back seat which is a great plus if you have more than one friend but unless all your friends are tiny it's gonna be a tight fit overall the 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth is a great looking car that's not only practical it's a ton of fun to try
