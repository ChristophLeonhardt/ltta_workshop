<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it is week two of my wash and go</font>

2
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,390
regimen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm still loving it I'm still</font>

3
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,660
loving it guys um this week was a little

4
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,070
bit different<font color="#E5E5E5"> only in the sense that I</font>

5
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,020
had to skip a day because I had a minor

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,559
surgery on my mouth and so I was a I

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,170
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the surgery with</font>

8
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,210
you know wet hair in the morning and all

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so my surgery is on Thursday</font>

10
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,670
so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did to prep for that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,789
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just um waste into my hair a little</font>

12
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,160
bit and pulled it back into a high puff

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,210
I wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> until friday to do it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,459
basically waited two days haven't gone

15
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,299
two days<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not doing my regular</font>

16
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,979
detangling routine I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did notice a</font>

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,200
difference I did notice that I had a lot

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">more knots that I had to kind of stand</font>

19
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,220
in the shower and work through which i

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,770
think is to be expected but um it was a

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,810
little disheartening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say that it</font>

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,040
was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> disheartening just in a</font>

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,869
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> because was really hard to work</font>

24
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,250
through some of those nuts because my

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,189
hair just been out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and coiling on itself</font>

26
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,670
for you know 48 hours so that really

27
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,970
sucked but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't too bad it wasn't</font>

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,240
horrible it's just not pleasant this

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,860
step this week actually did kind of a

30
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,229
two and one again so to cleanse and

31
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,720
clarify as well as condition for the

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,270
first two days<font color="#E5E5E5"> monday and tuesday i used</font>

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,130
thee as i am i use the as i am coconut

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-wash i've done a review on this co</font>

35
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,100
wash before on my youtube channel if you

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,799
want you can go and find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

37
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,020
think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> veda video things i like</font>

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,419
about this co wash is that it does what

39
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:09,899
it says

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,360
does clean your hair and it does make it

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,950
super duper curl defined awesome it does

42
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,200
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as soon as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put it into my hair</font>

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,890
like ringlets out the wazoo I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,209
use this for monday and tuesday though

45
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,370
because it is a clarifying conditioner

46
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,230
and so to me I just didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to risk</font>

47
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,420
dryness<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and ones I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just never I</font>

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,400
always take two and ones with a grain of

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,709
salt so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would not recommend using this</font>

50
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,180
every day but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

51
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,980
person where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like shampoos no</font>

52
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,470
matter how much you dilute them are

53
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,069
still too strong try the as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am coconut</font>

54
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,560
co wash it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very mild and</font>

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,060
that's why I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to use</font>

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,549
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two days straight and that'd be</font>

57
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,459
it and this was all I used for Monday

58
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,409
and Tuesday to condition my hair to

59
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:00,629
clean it to do my finger pulling all of

60
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,870
that

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,360
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for the rest of the week I</font>

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,870
conditioned with the Giovanni smooth as

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,450
silk<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep moisture conditioner and this</font>

64
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,730
is actually conditioner that Cynthia had

65
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,220
said work 12 on her hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so when I</font>

66
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,290
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I had it in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pantry in</font>

67
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,750
my closet I was like haha perfect I'll

68
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,060
Drive and so with this it also does

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,400
contain vegetable<font color="#CCCCCC"> oils so for vegetable</font>

70
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,710
protein so you shouldn't leave this in

71
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,150
your hair you should wash<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out because</font>

72
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,220
it is a protein conditioner I didn't

73
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,920
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it gave me as much slip as the</font>

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,500
shea moisture conditioner when it

75
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,390
finally did offer the slip<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted I</font>

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,280
felt like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a lot of it so if</font>

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,700

78
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than halfway gone it</font>

79
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,190

80
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,680
will say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does define them very</font>

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,210
nicely but you have to use a lot and you

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,320
need to use it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple days</font>

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,030
straight before you see the results that

84
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,400

127
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,250
the my honey child type for hair cream

128
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,650

129
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:18,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the week so I did a couple questions</font>

that were on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instagram um one</font>

131
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,460
question I got was how are you handling

132
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,380
the cold and I guess I should have like

133
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,840
mentioned this before but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am based in</font>

134
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,770
texas

135
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">i live in austin texas and last week we</font>

136
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,970
had maybe one more one or two more cold

137
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,240
days and by cold<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean it got down to</font>

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,440
about 45 ish so wasn't do that now

139
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,819
consistently it is around the 60s to 70s

140
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,909
every day so the cold isn't really an

141
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,409
issue for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> um sorry another question</font>

142
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got was how are you wrapping your</font>

143
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,520
hair up at night and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to that</font>

144
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
is I am NOT I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapping my hair up</font>

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,490
at night what I am doing is just falling

146
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,569
asleep on my bed I have a satin horse I

147
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,539
have no is it seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I have a satin</font>

148
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,539
pillowcase and that is what I sleep on

149
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,550
so that way it doesn't rub my hair and

150
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,740
mess it up or whatever so every morning

151
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,280
I do wake up with like a flattened fro

152
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
like every morning and that just happens

153
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,169
if you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see videos on silk</font>

154
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus satin there's another there's a</font>
