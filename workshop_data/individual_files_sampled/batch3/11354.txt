hello and welcome to the Peter Schmeichel show coming to you this week from high above Moscow's laconic Red Square giving you a glorious view of the very center of the World Cup party we've seen all 32 teams in action already and a mixture of entertaining football and unpredictable resolves means that fans have been treated to a real celebration of beautiful game the tournament has been a real melting point of fans coming together from all corners of the world and it's easy to tell you who comes from where by the color of their shirts the red and whites of Peru the sky blue and white stripes of the everything in Argentina fans and the green sombreros of Mexico they've all been the most obvious across in Moscow Russian fans young and old came streaming out of the Luzhniki stadium with a big smile on their faces after their team thrashed Saudi Arabia five nil in the opening match and the much-anticipated fans from Iceland they inspired their team to a draw with Argentina with their pre match Viking war dance two million fans has been known to travel to Russia and under squares behind me the party has been going on 24 hours non-stop since the tournament started last week I on the pitch we've seen everything that we love about football and they that's been delivered by the best players in the world dramatically goals scored in the 19th minute or and and beyond and the red card in the 3rd minute a hat-trick from Ronaldo and the penalty missed by no other than Leonel amazing and of course there's also been the introduction of yet more technology into the world's favorite game we've all gotten used to the goal-line technology which is already given two goals in the first round of the group games but for these championships FIFA have gone one step further into the world of technology and introduced via video assistant referees so var so what is var and how does it work well it's a tool to help referee make correct decisions so the VAR team they are based in a central video operating room they called it vor ball not to be confused with var and that ball is based at the international broadcast centre here in Moscow sitting in front of a bank of screens camera feeds are fed into them and they're able to communicate directly with the referee at each station via a fiber linked radio system the VAR team and here I have to be really careful because the VAR team consists of the video assistant referee and three assistants video assistant referees and the last one are called a var one a var two and you guessed right a var three each member of the team has been selected primarily based on their experience as a video match officials so they're all referees or assistant referees themselves the team at the broadcast centre they have independent access to all available match footage but under the current rules can only assist the referee in the event of a clear and obvious error or serious missed incident in a number of situations so the var system can intervene whether or not a goal was scored whether a penalty should or should not have been given whether a direct red card should have been awarded or in case of mistaken identity in other words whether a referee has sent off or quotient the wrong player so why exactly is this technology being brought into the game FIFA's had a football technology innovation your highness Hots mala explained the thinking behind it too you take me through step by step what happens and in water or and what is it supposed to do so in general we are talking about for game-changing situations that that these are the trigger points for we are that means only when one of these situations is happening on the page then really the VAR can support the referee on the page so that means if something happens let's say a potential red card ball goes out of play or even if the ball is still in the game in the background there are checks happening we call them silent checks so that means that the VR so that the entire var team because we will have for VAR s 1 we are and 3 AV yards in this room sitting together they will check immediately is this a potential red card and in the moment when he is clear that this is obvious and very clear for everyone then he will inform the referee on the pitch please delay the game and that's exactly the moment and when the referee on the pitches oh it seems that I missed something is that the word he goes please delay the game no it's it's the later game so that means that's the moment then when the referee knows on the pitch something happened but it could be also the other way around that the referee on the pitch says oh this something happened I couldn't see it because maybe a player was standing in front of the action or something that he could also have please check that for me again it seems that maybe I missed something really seriously so so he said please delay the game and then the ball goes out of play then what happens and then it's exactly a communication between the var and the referee on the page that means the v-rod and clearly explains what he has seen what what unions that was the clear and obvious error and we there's there's a difference between factual information so who was it was the ball out of play or was in the offside position because that's something is black and white however worker we say when it's not a factual information then always and that's the more for the referees and that's um probably something you have to ask my symbaloo circumpolar eg Galena but then they will send the referee on the on the side of the field with the monitor because the referee should see with his own eyes to decide yes for me it's also clear and obvious so factual information and the other part where we need interpretation now to the two different decisions we would like to doesn't have to go to the to the video manager you can say no I saw it right and then exactly so if it's a factual information so for best example it's offside position then he believes because it's black and white we have a line we will see the line okay it's black and white and he will then of course support the Vieira he then makes this he goes to the video monitor yeah he then comes up with what he thinks is a correct decision and then he does what and then it depends what what his decision is so either he stays with his initial decision and play goes on or he says showing the TV signal and is changing the decision then if a goal is scored and this after he watched the situation again and says no it's no goal then he makes it clear that it's no goal given and it starts then depending on the situation can they take it back two minutes yes and no and I tell you why because it's it start off the attacking phase so attacking phase it's defined in the protocol the moment when it starts the moment when it goes to the build-up to the goal at the end so to build up to the goal and that's interpretation for the referee as well so it's not that we can clearly say that's the moment or that's the moment and really to the referee to decide okay that's the moment when the build-up to the go started and that's exactly when the taking face started and from there on everything that is not according to the laws of the game can be analysed it's a system completely ready to be introduced to the World Cup I think first of all it's very important to understand that it's a little bit different than gold and technology a few years ago because Dahl and technology was somehow developed of course with the industry but was developed by FIFA at that time now we are using normal broadcast equipment so it's nothing that is specially developed only for var because in many other sports is you know they're already using it however football as you know we have special special needs and therefore of course we had to test all the different elements one element was of course the feeds that the feeds arrived especially here for a worker we have a centralized var that means that we had we have to test still when we arrived there but also what we already tested and I would that be the couple grab a centralized var that means at one place were all the feeds coming in so that was tested at the Club World Cup the next big step for us and where we also have seen many problems were Saudi communication between the var sitting in a room somewhere and the referee on the page also here we did many trials we did many experiments with different companies checking everything and we are feeling quite comfortable that it will work at the World Cup and the next element was offsides you mentioned it there was this situation and you can imagine how many emails are arrived on that day because everyone was worried that we have similar things that work happened but also here we tested different providers for offside technology and for offside technology there are two very important things that you have to consider one is of course the line how accurate is the line and their cutting and I can just repeat myself again and again that every line that you see from your normal broadcaster it's nice but this is not a hundred percent accurate because it's not validated by an scientific testing Institute that's exactly what we did now we tested all the different providers ok how accurate is the line and the second element you should never forget is the person is there still a person involved it's not an automatic technology or system but it's someone who has to put the line somewhere and that's still the VR or the AVR so these two things have to be taken into consideration so we will have a very accurate line but at the end it's still when is the moment the ball was played and also where the we are stand placing the line so that's the third element and the last one is then the the on field monitor so also here we tested where do we place the monitor or where can we save time and what's the best location and we did trials when we started 2016 in Japan we did trials in South Korea last year and then Russia and Abu Dhabi I think we now found the best best solution for the World Cup how we do it there it's a special outdoor monitor that Sun rain all this has to be considered of course and at the end also that when the referee arrives there that he can see immediately immediately the right thing because when we started we gave the referee on the pitch different angles and look at this and this and this and he said look guys I'm here and I don't have the time so give me just the one where you are convinced that there was a clear error so all these things we went through a thousand times just to really provide the best camera angle in there in the fastest possible time and what is also very important different to all the league's is we will have an own off-site station working station within the VAR setup and I tell you why because we also learn to have seen over the time that when a goal is scored the players are celebrating and suddenly after a minute or something your officiant no no no no go sorry it was offside so we said okay we want to be sure that this time is very very short we go to a to the maximum so we said everything that we can everywhere we can help the referee to make a very fast decision here would support football at the end so we have there one AVR it's a one of the it will be always one of the top additionals referees or lines men who will sit there together with an own operator just for offside decision that we can be very very quick that we can save time take me to this the d'Ivoire center I mean what that sounds like you're a very big and very complicated setup yeah we what's in there we will have four systems there because we will always want to have one backup system and for the last today of the group-stage we have two matches at the same time so we will have a setup of for VAR so one main VR and three AV errors so they're helping each other as I said one is only for the offside situations another one is there in case the VAR the offside is that part of before four this is part of the exactly so we have two VAR the VR is working very closely with an operator together so they're also training together they're working together since now many many weeks and months so they know each other very well they're speaking the same language they know each other they know exactly when they are saying something that the operators immediately knowing okay he knows this and that we have the AVR so what is the a via the system via our doing he is following life in the moment when the VAR is checking an incident because as you know football is so flowing game that means it could be that the ball is not out of play and he's checking something and someone else has to follow the live match so the AVR is following the live match and in case something occurs there another incident and he can take the moment and the Vieira to know what exactly then we have to third one as I said that's the offside one and the fourth one who tries to provide the best communication between all the different VAR s and ABR's we in this in the center so it's a very not a complex but it's a really I would say a setup that for all the different scenarios that can happen provides the best possible information in the shortest possible time what measures are you or what ideas are you bringing in to that can be first of all minimize it but also keep us viewers the fans entertained and informed the moment it goes to an official review there will be a screen in the stadium showing okay this is a real review there will be also the information about the final decision and the reason for it so no goal offside for example and in addition after the decision is made there will be also the decisive angles shown in the stadium so that means we really hope with this process we really covered everything or we could be as much as transparent as possible the current FIFA president Gianni Infantino was not personally involved in the decision to award the World Cups to either Russia or Qatar who will host in 2022 so my suspicion was that perhaps to put his own touch of this tournament he has made var his very own pet project I went to FIFA headquarters in Zurich to ask him whether that was the case the president of FIFA and seducing Val into the World Cup can you guarantee that it's gonna be a success it will be a success definitely it will be a success because there will never be a correct decision which will be changed into a wrong decision but there will be wrong decisions which will be corrected into a right decision so there are only upsides there are no downsides I don't understand why you have to be so perfect in the game do we really want that well we want to be as fair as possible in the game that's why otherwise we wouldn't need referees referee is there to take a decision hopefully the right decision when a foul or one-one-one something is committed which is not in accord with the laws of the game so if again a game in the World Cup an important game but any game in general it's decided because of a mistake of a referee in good phase can happen it's all right if we can correct it we thought that this has a detrimental impact on the game if you decide a World Cup on a offside goal on on a hands goal it doesn't feel right because maybe 20-30 years ago you wouldn't have the chance to be sure about it today you can and where you are not sure because sometimes even the video images then give you an the percent security then it's always the referee obviously who decides based on his own interpretation so we just help the referee will give him a tool to be able to correct a potential big destiny AR is one minute per game and it decides the game so we can lose one minute per game if this has an important it's not making an impression on you that that fans are very confused and people who are actually active inside football have really nothing good to say about it before to further says I was very positive when we got to December you know I couldn't see anything good and I can't see anything good coming out of it at all this is a guy who's played the game and obviously directs our football and bufang says it's it's gonna ruin the game somehow said the same thing these are people big big experienced people that's to say this is not right oh the system as it's designed it's not right there's a lot make like an impression where you might think am i jumping the gun here should we just give it a little bit more time and not implemented in what you say is such a big tournament as a welcome I think in a big tournament like the World Cup we have to implement the best tools that we have to our disposal for for the referees who take the right the correct decisions in in the games there are many football players and coaches and so on I have expressed also very positive opinions about the AR and this is mainly linked to the experience of course that is made obviously when you lose one match because of var it's before it was maybe the fault of the referee now it would be obvious when we take the examples in the FA Cup in in England where this was tested these were the first games in the first games in Italy for example this season where all the games have been paid or in Portugal the first match days in Germany as well there were heavy heavy criticisms then the referees get used the players get used the coaches get used the public gets used and the whole perception is changing as well when it comes to the World Cup referees they are now capable of taking a decision in 20 seconds whereas one year ago it took them one minute to the solely for for the work of referees who's ever work with Vai and they the cause was there on they went on as close to the World Cup so their experience going in so the World Cup would be very much like you say that that in the beginning in Italy in Germany where they you know everyone was confused and when to use it not so the you might risk having the same kind of problems that that was in the early part of the trial well I don't think so we don't think so because the referees who are going to the World Cup they are preparing the use of years for two years since two years we have started in training them the team and the Pierluigi Collina is in charge of doing that and they are ensuring that all the reference will be at the level that they have all tested it and that they are all capable of using in the best possible common and you're not afraid at all that you're just giving the referees an excuse not to make a decision oh I'm not doing that let me just go and see because that can happen well you know many many things can happen but I think that the referees who go to the World Cup they have enough personality to to take the decisions that they have to take helping consult an additional tool that they have at their disposal if they feel that they have to do that there is no doubt that vast impact has been felt in the first week of the tournament it wasn't used at all in the opening few days but made its debut in the first game of day three and making headlines in the process Franz Anton Griezmann was the one to benefit he was awarded a penalty against Australia after a penalty claim was taken to var after looking at the footage the referee decided that France did deserve the spot kick and after all that Griezmann himself converted it to one no score and it's fair to say that Australia's manager Bert van Marwijk didn't agree with that decision and he was let left fuming saying I hope that maybe one time there will be a referee who is very honest when you're in that moment on your own you have to go to that video screen I saw him standing there the body language wasn't he didn't know from my position and then you have to take a decision France or Australia it's very difficult but when it's also difficult to decide when a referee for 50,000 people on his back must decide when it's doubting I have to say I'm with the Australia boss and the evidence I don't think was conclusive and having seen it at least 15 times over I'm still not convinced and I have a little bit of sympathy with fan Malik's frustration the aim of this technology is to eradicate referee mistakes from the game and I'm not sure that that was what happened in that situation later that day Peru was awarded a penalty by Avaya decision and again that was reeled out mainly due to the poor video footage available in the end though the penalty was kicked high over the bar so there's no need to make a song and a dance out of that situation Sweden went next up to enjoy a bit of fortune courtesy of the referee from Salvador didn't see much wrong when South Korea's a jung-eun Lee put a tackle in on Victor claisen inside the penalty box but the VAR assistant did and after watching it on his pitch site manager referee joel aquela correctly awarded Sweden a penalty which was put in the back of the net by skipper and tires conquest the only goal in that match and it's safe to say that that was a game-changing intervention so var has been far from convincing up till now many observers me included think that Diego cost his first goal for Spain against Portugal should have been taken to our he clearly hit the Portuguese defender peppered in the neck in the run-up to the goal but neither the referee or the var system reacted and the goal stood the controversy continued and the evening of day 5 when Tunisia was awarded a penalty by the referee against the England in Volgograd that decision was a hundred percent correct but there were at least two incidents later in the game that should have been looked at England's Dangermond hurricane was clearly held down and grappled to the floor twice and should have been awarded penalties in my opinion in both situations the issue for me is that both incidents appeared to be worse than the penalty that was actually awarded and after the game thief had made it it would have to take a hard look at why there was no reaction from either the match referee or the VAR team back in Moscow staring at the 30 so the question is this VAR working what did it need some more time to develop before being introduced into a championship of the magnitude of the World Cup before the tournament kicked off I was a doubter I didn't think it was ready and I thought it couldn't work in football in 2018 but you know what I'm actually pleasantly surprised don't don't get me wrong Wow it's not a hundred percent there yet but at its current state of development it's good enough to be useful by having it here at this World Cup the experience will ensure that important lessons are learned understanding will improve and it could make the game fair after all so this is my position now on Wow two months ago I was directly opposed to it but knowing that it was inevitable to be introduced into the game and having seen it work in the first round of the World Cup I now think it's pretty cool and I also think that the referees and the VAR assistance they've done a pretty good job overall so far so good see you next time on the Peter Schmeichel show
