Bob you're down here at the leadership debate the last time you showed up for one you are Frog March to help by security are you gonna get in tonight I'm sure pretty sure I'm not going to get in tonight the concern that I really have here the protests that I have here is that the major gate media gatekeepers they're guarding what's being said to the people we have over 60% of the vote in some areas not coming out to vote what's that tell you they're not getting the message you know right now you can talk about the Conservatives and the Liberals it's almost like an abuse spouse syndrome how many girls go back to that boyfriend that hit them and then they go to the other boyfriend then when that one hits them they go back to the other boyfriend that's what the voter of Ontario was like if you look at the last 30 years we've managed to get ourselves into 330 million billion dollar debt if you believe that liberals or 390 billion dollars if you believe the auditor-general that doesn't happen with win that doesn't happen with the PCs that happens with one after the other after the other this vicious cycle has to end on the issue of the debate did you find it odd that the Green Party leader was allowed to be in the last debate and the Green Party has no seats they probably will have no seats after this election you at least have one elected MPP which to me is kind of like the benchmark for having skin in the game yet they would not allow you in oh we're talking about the Jamaican Kate Canadian debate aren't we yeah now that was I was shocked but you know what if you want to get your message out you have to keep on going back you have to keep pounding that the pavement have to keep there we went there and they as you said they threw us out but our voice got heard because then the media picked up on us and then I was on local media radio station talking about that and we managed to get supporters from that the more they try to stop something the more you have to get up and go at it how dare they how dare they only invite the people that have RUP Doug Ford they invite Kathleen Wynn and they invite Horvath and then they invite the Green Party who doesn't even have a single seat in the parliament we've been having our nose to the grindstone in Parliament asking those pointed questions that they hate answer wait I think we just answered the question why wasn't I invited because we're asking the pointy questions that aren't comfortable for those guys Bob on in terms of the political landscape in Ontario of course the most recent thing happened this weekend tended Granick Alan being drummed out of the party by Doug Ford kind of a worrying trend if you talk to PC supporters because Doug Ford is also flip-flopped about developing part of the green belt and and and when against his promise off repeated that he would have open grassroots nominations with 11:00 appointments and some of those appointments are hard core liberals what do you make of this and is this good for your party you know sadly I have to say it is good for our party but as soon as I say it's good for my party it means it's bad for Ontario and let's admit it they're all the same they're all to blame Doug Ford did exactly what Patrick Brown did he when he was seeking leadership what was his big mantra oh we gotta stop the sex ed curriculum we gotta social issues he was dealing with because he knew that resonated with the support that would get him elected and then and then as soon as he got in what did he do he voted for the same thing he was against but oh well he got what he wanted Doug Ford has done this on about three things right now the sex ed curriculum he publicly said it on focus Ontario that is at the bottom of the list in political terms that means it's never going to be ever coming to light it's done it's finished he got what he wanted he got the leadership now screw you kick you to the curb and that's what the popular doesn't think how about the oh do you think he'll flip-flop on the sex ed curriculum he might come back again a and then he might go back again Doug Ford has no interest in ever this is my opinion has no interest in ever having a controversial item like that you know what his interest is right bring that sign over here I wouldn't that's what his interest this developing the Greenbelt that's what the developers want he said it when he was a counselor he said it when he was a counselor to a bunch of developers that were gonna pave over the Greenville and then he said it again this is the agenda right there you know oh and then he cloaked it under the idea of it's going to be for social housing oh come on how stupid can people think that once you open the Greenbelt we're only going to build a social housing yeah you have to be the dumbest person on the planet if you're buying that that's the agenda you look for the character of a person in the smallest things they do and not was a slip-up and he recanted that if that man Doug Ford ever had gone to his constituents had ever gone to his caucus members they would have said are you crazy no we're not doing that he did it on the spur of the moment he thinks he is immune to any any democratic process how about the you raise a good point do you think this is Doug Ford's doing or do you think this is his inner circle of campaign advisers and managers that are giving him essentially bad advice doesn't it doesn't it all come down to the leader a leader says I'm taking the advice or I'm not taking the advice and if someone gives you bad advice maybe three times in the road you know what you say you're not on my advice team anymore or you put your head down because you're beaten and recognized they control all the levers who would benefit from the green belt developing Doug Ford who makes labels probably not you figure it out you sort it out we are not benefiting it from it and that's the agenda because once that man gets into office it's finished he he said the words that's who said the words he's responsible for it all how about the marijuana issue within six days after he got the leadership vote the marijuana people come out because they were pushing for they were pushing for private sector sales which the Trillium Party is pushing for as well simply because it's the most effective way of a safe way six days got what I wanted screw you guys it's going to the LCBO come on people wake up a little bit and recognize the character of this PC party's the same as the character as a liberal party they rule by fear they rule by profit and they rule by greed you
