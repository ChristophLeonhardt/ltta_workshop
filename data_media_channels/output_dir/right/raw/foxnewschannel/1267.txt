1
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,367
PROSECUTORS SHOULDN'T HAVE MUCH

2
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:26,036
DIFFICULTY MAKING THEIR CASE

3
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:27,771
AGAINST HIM IN THESE VIDEOS

4
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:28,972
DON'T PROVIDE ANY MORE

5
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:29,740
INFORMATION OR ANSWERS.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,742
BUT THEY DO RAISE QUESTIONS, SO

7
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:36,013
WHY RELEASE THEM?

8
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:37,648
LET'S GET SOME ANSWERS FROM

9
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:44,188
RETIRED L.A.P.D. DETECTIVE MARK

10
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:46,457
FURMAN AND THIS MAN WHOSE

11
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:47,591
18-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS KILLED.

12
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:49,059
ANDREW, YOU ARE ON THE RADIO

13
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:51,195
TODAY AND IT WAS SO MOVING.

14
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:52,996
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH ALREADY TO

15
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:54,932
BRING SANITY TO THIS

16
00:00:54,932 --> 00:00:55,666
CONVERSATION ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY

17
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,803
AND SO FORTH, AND OUR VIEWERS --

18
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:01,472
OUR HEART GOES OUT TO YOU,

19
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,373
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US

20
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:04,208
TONIGHT.

21
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,410
YOU HAD SOME VERY POIGNANT AND

22
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,878
POINTED WORDS, ANDREW, ABOUT

23
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:17,788
THESE VIDEOS BEING RELEASED.

24
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:18,522
READING THOSE TRANSCRIPTS MADE

25
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:22,192
ME SICK TO MY STOMACH.

26
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,762
SO I'M GLAD THAT I DIDN'T REALLY

27
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:30,334
LOOK AT THE VIDEOS.

28
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:35,038
HE KNEW HE WAS GOING TO BE

29
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:40,043
GLORIFIED IN THE NEWS.

30
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,411
AND USING THE NAME AND PICTURES

31
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,213
THROUGHOUT THE MEDIA IN THE

32
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:43,547
COUNTRY.

33
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,916
I THINK WE COULD USE A LOT AT

34
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,117
THIS AND NOT REALLY SHOW THEIR

35
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:49,620
NAMES OR THEIR FACES IN THE

36
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:49,920
MEDIA.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,755
I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A

38
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:52,623
DIFFERENCE.

39
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:53,824
>> Laura: THAT'S WHAT YOU

40
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:56,727
WANT, AND YOU ARE RIGHT, HE

41
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,762
REFERENCED THAT.

42
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:00,864
MARK FUHRMAN, PREMEDITATED

43
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:03,500
MURDER IN FLORIDA.

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,202
THIS KIND OF EXPLODES THAT.

45
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:07,838
THERE IS NO WAY, I THINK THEY

46
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,639
COULDN'T CHARGE HIM NOW WITH

47
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,374
PREMEDITATED MURDER AND THAT

48
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:11,408
COULD MEAN THE POSSIBILITY OF

49
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:14,478
THE DEATH PENALTY.

50
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:17,781
TELL US WHY.

51
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,684
>> THE RELEASE OF THE VIDEOS HAS

52
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:23,387
NO EVIDENTIARY OR INFORMATIONAL

53
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:24,988
VALUE WHATSOEVER.

54
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:27,024
HE HAS CONFESSED AND HE WANTS A

55
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:28,258
LIFE SENTENCE IN EXCHANGE FOR NO

56
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,394
DEATH PENALTY.

57
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:33,263
THE MEDIA AT LARGE A REQUEST UP

58
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:35,799
FAITH BECAUSE OF FLORIDA LAW OF

59
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,201
DISCOVERY, ONCE DISCOVERY IS

60
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,869
MADE THEY CAN ASK PRETTY MUCH

61
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,904
ANYTHING THAT THE DEFENSE

62
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:44,107
ATTORNEY AND THE PROSECUTOR HAS.

63
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,177
THEY OBVIOUSLY SHOWED NO

64
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:48,378
RESPONSIBILITY BY RELEASING

65
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:50,080
THIS, THIS INFORMATION NOW IN

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,982
FRONT OF EVERY JUROR IN THE

67
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,852
COUNTRY, NOT JUST FLORIDA, IS

68
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:56,753
SEEING SOMETHING THAT MAKES THE

69
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:57,354
DEATH PENALTY CASE VERY

70
00:02:57,354 --> 00:02:59,590
DIFFICULT FOR THE PROSECUTORS,

71
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,593
BECAUSE NOW, WHEN YOU GO INTO

72
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,294
THAT COURTROOM, THE JURORS HAVE

73
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:05,996
ALL SEEN THIS.

74
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:08,999
NOT ONLY DOES HE SHOW

75
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,601
PREMEDITATION BUT HE KIND OF

76
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,202
ARGUES AGAINST A MENTAL DEFECT.

77
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,504
HE SEEMS COMPLETELY IN CONTROL

78
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,039
OF HIS PLANNING, COMPLETELY IN

79
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,709
CONTROL OF THE MANNING, AND THIS

80
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,981
IS HIS MANIFESTO.

81
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,783
>> THIS GUY IS LIKE, HE IS

82
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:27,517
INSANE, HE DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL

83
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:30,954
OF HIS FACULTIES.

84
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:39,196
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

85
00:03:39,196 --> 00:03:41,465
>> WHAT'S WORSE IS THE VIDEOS.

86
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,600
MY DAUGHTER HAPPEN TO GET

87
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,334
MURDERED IN THE HALLWAY AND SO

88
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,003
THAT WILL BE THE NEXT VIDEOS

89
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:48,872
THAT THE MEDIA WILL BE LOOKING

90
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:49,406
AT.

91
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:51,642
SHE WAS ON THE THIRD FLOOR, SHE

92
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:53,677
WAS SHOT NINE TIMES AND THAT'S

93
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:55,178
ON THE CAMERA, ALSO.

94
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,781
THEY WILL BE LOOKING FOR THOSE

95
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,549
VIDEOS, NEXT.

96
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,751
THAT WILL BE HEART WRENCHING.

97
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:01,485
>> Laura: WHAT THEY ARE TRYING

98
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:04,187
TO DO IS KEEP THE SCHOOL

99
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,188
SHOOTING VIDEO GAME GOING FOR

100
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:07,224
THE LONGEST TIME.

101
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,859
THANK GOODNESS THAT'S BEEN SHUT

102
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:09,593
DOWN.

103
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:11,061
ANDREW HAS BEEN LOBBYING AGAINST

104
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:11,395
THAT.

105
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:13,430
MARK, I KNOW YOU HAVE STRONG

106
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,798
FEELINGS ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

107
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:18,068
PARENTS ARE WORRIED ABOUT

108
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,237
THEY ARE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT

109
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:22,239
ANDREW IS FOCUSED ON, HOW TO

110
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,874
MAKE THE SCHOOLS SAFE.

111
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:25,008
METAL DETECTORS OR WHATEVER THEY

112
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,811
HAVE TO DO TO MAKE THESE SCHOOLS

113
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:28,111
SAFE.

114
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,346
THEY ARE PRACTICAL THINGS THAT

115
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:31,848
TEXAS IS DOING AND OTHER PLACES,

116
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,650
THANK GOODNESS.

117
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,385
MARK, FINAL WORDS?

118
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:36,887
>> WE HAVE LEGISLATION ON THE

119
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,221
WEBSITE THAT PEOPLE COULD LOOK

120
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:40,691
AT, BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME FOR

121
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,492
THESE GOVERNORS TO ACT.

122
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,461
THEY NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT

123
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,996
FLORIDA DID, WHAT GOVERNOR SCOTT

124
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,764
HELP TO GET PAST, AND WHAT WE

125
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,801
ARE DOING IN FLORIDA WITH SENATE

126
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,234
BILL 7026.

127
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:52,369
THEY SHOULD BE PROACTIVE.

128
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,604
WHY SHOULD THEY BE WAITING FOR

129
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:55,872
ANOTHER SHOOTING, BECAUSE THERE

130
00:04:55,872 --> 00:04:58,642
IS SOME OTHER SOCIOPATH OUT

131
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,243
THERE PLANNING ANOTHER SHOOTING?

132
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,813
THEY SHOULD BE PROACTIVE.

133
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:03,280
>> Laura: MARK?

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,649
>> I THINK WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE

135
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:10,721
THIS WITH WHAT MR. POLLOCK SAID,

136
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,557
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND ANGER AND

137
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:14,257
SELF-RIGHTEOUS PURPOSE TO STOP

138
00:05:14,257 --> 00:00:00,000
THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND IT
