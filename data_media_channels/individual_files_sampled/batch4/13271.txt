Kavanagh judge Cavanaugh and I've been a judge prosecutor and the defense attorney and here's what I'll tell you when it comes to where it happened I still don't know I don't know when it happened she said she's a hundred percent certain it did happen I bet you judge Cavanaugh say I'm a hundred percent sure I didn't do it the people name say they don't know what miss Ford's talking about she can't tell us how she got home and how she got there and that's the facts I'm left with a nice lady who has come forward to tell a hard story that son corroborated and this is enough god help anybody else that gets nominated based on what I heard today you could not get a search warrant or an arrest warrant because you don't know the location you don't know the time and you don't have any corroboration yeah you give it to him Lindsey you Bulldog Bulldog Lindsey Graham here he is he's absolutely right from the beginning of her testimony onward she got there she said she sat down she said you know after my opening statement I anticipate I'm gonna need a little caffeine so we're probably gonna have to break well if you anticipated that why didn't you bring a cup of coffee with you or better yet have a cup of coffee before you sat down is it because you want the television coverage to only cover your statement and not cover up any of those pesky questions is that what happened she's asked these questions her story has been changing the Senate Judiciary Committee appointed a prosecutor to ask these questions because none of the men want to seem like they're angry and asking her questions so they got this nice-looking woman to ask the questions instead she's changed her story Christine Ford at various points she's you know I don't know what happened to her I didn't something might have happened maybe something didn't happen but from this testimony we cannot conclude that any of this is credible I'll explain to you exactly why and why everyone believing her is really acting out of a misguided passion before I do that though come on it's it we're talking about sex you're in my bedroom you're in my hotel room let's talk about purple mattress I love purple mattress purple mattress has fixed an important aspect of my life you know that I sleep 17 18 hours a day I really care about what I'm sleeping on purple mattress is unlike any other mattress that you have ever tried that has ever been invented it's not like the spring is it's not like the memory foam I've tried both this is better this is a zillion times better if you're struggling to get a good night's sleep try purple mattress purple mattress it was invented by an actual rocket scientist it's designed by actual rocket scientists and you know I am easily satisfied by the best I'm a man of simple tastes this is so good you get a hundred night risk-free trial if you're not fully satisfied to return the mattress for a full refund backed by 10-year warranty free shipping and returns feel what it's like to sleep in my bed feel with that I'm gonna get me tuned for the I'm gonna get called before the Senate Judiciary Committee for this go you're gonna love purple go you'll get a free purple pillow with the purchase of a mattress that's an addition to all the other great gifts they have it seriously this bed is unbelievable go do it it is worth the money it is 100% worth the money it's always worth the money to have a good bed but especially this one purple comp promo code cough FA CoV fe fa purple dot-com promo code cough fa ce o v fe fe the only way to get this free pillow is to use my promo code you know what it is co v fe fe @ purple com it is not credible these allegations that she's making are not credible why Lindsey Graham said it she didn't tell us the year she can't tell us how she got there she can't tell us how she left she can't really tell us where it was she can't tell us the circumstances the people that she's named as having been there say they weren't there they say that Brett can all wasn't there there is no corroborating evidence now what the Democrats are trying to do is make a circus out of this and say well there was another accusation they said yeah but that other accusation was from some total wackadoodle whose boyfriend got a restraining order right on her yeah but it was another one it's with all these accusations you know I mean you know accusations right I mean that no I don't know what or any of the accusations credible well no but no but there's so many of them yeah but they're all if I so if one crazy person tells me that you know the sky is about to rain down purple donuts and and then for other crazy people tell me the same thing that doesn't mean this guy is gonna rain down purple donuts it means you've got a lot of unsubstantiated claims that was an analogy I made on the fly I don't know how much it totally olds up but it doesn't mean that it just because you have a lot of people saying something you need evidence to back that up by the way there were a few really important moments here the prosecutor asked her said did you give your medical record the medical record of you talking about this assault the diary entry from the therapist did you give that to the Washington Post and she and the lawyer jumps in he said all you don't know don't answer that you don't have to answer that don't know it but no no she says well I don't I don't know I don't said what you mean you don't know so it turns out that Christine Ford's short-term memory is as bad as her long-term memory because it's not like asking her what you had for lunch a dozen days ago or two weeks ago it's asking her the only piece of even quasi evidence sort of resembling evidence that you have that when you were talking to the Washington Post did you hand that to them it's just I I don't know that was less than eight weeks ago that she would have done that you don't remember less than two months ago really really smells fishy I don't know what she thinks I don't know what she thinks happened or if she's mistaken or if she's lying or worried even if it really did happen but we have no evidence for it and what these people like mazie Hirono the senator or the democrat senator from Hawaii what they're saying is he's guilty until proven innocent and a lot of people now are saying it's he's too tarnished he's not too tired you're trying to tarnish him but he's not too tarnished and by the way I got to tell you something I was watching this on CNN this morning because I'm at a hotel room you know so I got CNN look if I watched CNN I probably would believe that this guy is like a super Nazi rapist killer I would I actually empathize now cuz I had to watch CNN I empathize with a lot of America if you were getting your news from CNN they had a whole panel and all they did after every little bit of testimony they would just go one by one Jake Tapper whoever the other people are say oh well very credible testimony oh yes it was very credible it was you know thing that struck me about it the credibility of a credible credible credible credible credible grandma didn't seem credible to me didn't present any evidence she contradicted herself several times she actually admitted to changing aspects of her story she appears to have contradicted the guy who gave her the polygraph test she wouldn't answer questions about who she's met with we know the lawyer comes from Dianne Feinstein we know it stinks to high heaven credible credible credible credible give me a break and I got to tell you these moments I you know I wish we're gonna run out of time but I do I think Donald Trump explained this very very well because you've got these guys like Jeff Flake who's saying well we need to hear them out I won't vote I these kind of fake squishy vichy Republicans but he had this great line in this press conference outside the UN where he talked about George Washington he compared the the treatment of brick havena to the countrymen George Washington would get a fewer and we were up for a job these days here he is look if we brought George Washington here and we said we have George Washington the Democrats would vote against him just so you understand and he may have had a bad past who knows you know he may have had some I think accusations made didn't he have a couple of things in his past George Washington would be voted against 100% by Schumer and the con artists I mean 100% 100% so it really doesn't matter from their standpoint that's why when John asked about the FBI if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI and they found him to be 100% perfect he would lose every single vote now if the Republicans win tomorrow I think you're gonna get some votes from the Democrats you know why because we all know why cuz it's called politics then you'll probably get so much there it is the honesty of the Donald he's gonna he says you know what it is it's politics that's what it is we've got one other excellent point that he made because this press conference was the answer to his UN speech he gave this stately incredible erudite sophisticated UN speech obviously was totally missed reported in the media so then he has to do what Trump does which is give this wacky zany I think was an one minute or 80 in 981 minute press conference where he goes all colorful and then he gets all of the coverage again but there were some really great moments to it before we get to that I one more baby one more we're gonna make a little bit more money okay

play it up really sanctimoniously cory booker right now is questioning questioning the girl Christine Ford and they all the Democrats are opening their testimony they say I just want you to know this isn't a trial and I just want you to know I believe you I believe you and they all do it because they all all this thing is about is getting clips for them for their 2020 campaign and clips for the midterm ads that they're gonna run on it Donald Trump because he's a more honest broker than these guys he just goes right for it here is President Trump on the hearings I could only say that what they've done to this man is incredible I think when you really look at it all it's not going to change any of the Democrats Minds they're obstructionists they're actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they've destroyed a man's reputation and they want to destroy it even more and I think people are gonna see that in the midterms what they've done to this family what they've done to these children these beautiful children of his and what they've done to his wife and they know it's a big fat con job and they go into a room and I guarantee you they laugh like hell at what they pulled off on you and on the public they laugh like hell people are gonna have to make a decision 36 years there's no charge all of a sudden the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out and then you have this other con artist avenatti come out with another beauty today he's got another beauty today I love it I mean this this is the Donald Trump that I think really resonates if you showed the American people you say okay a woman who for 36 years never mentioned anything can't recall any of the details of the event all the other people that were allegedly there deny it men and women you know the guy's been a federal judge forever six FBI investigations now all of a sudden this comes out what do you believe that or do you have Donald Trump's take it's a con job it's obvious it's transparent obviously it's gonna be the latter we got to get to clinic you know I've got Glenn Beck coming by for an interview is gonna come to my hotel room no I'm just kidding he's not cut that would be that would be so weird I could meat to him for that I we hung out with Glenn Beck back around the studio and man he told us he told me some stuff I actually did not know about him and had not heard going back 20 years so it's pretty cool definitely check it out and we'll be right back after that with the mailbag Glenn thank you for being here really all right thank you you know I have to tell you I only did that because I've been here all week and Michael I don't know if you know this but they treat you like garbage they do they do I you didn't want to feel left out well no I mean it's just a habit you know hanging around with Ben he just trashes you personally my family yeah I looks yeah I know yeah I was caught why I was wondering I figured now would be a good opportunity how's it looking at the blaze we wouldn't he said he was gonna call ice on you though yeah yeah I mean you know why he's got the Ben debt you know well you you can understand this because you and I are authors yeah we're a best-selling author right all right it's because I wrote this book this best-selling book he's been very writing is really very much you're very lucid really clear no it's good it's good yeah it's pithy that's what I like about it's just it gets right to the heart of it brevity is the soul of wit and they're from I'm the wittiest guy that was 200 some pages it's very brief now you you have also come out with a book you made a different choice though as you put words in I put words I put words in mine addicted to outrage I actually wrote this book twice not literally I wrote it the first time and I learned so much while I was writing it that by the time I got to the end I was like okay that that's all that right that's that's too elementary Wow and so I went back and I rewrote the entire book which was a little brutal was it was it just your thinking that changed your process or was it something about the news or the face no it's it's my thing you know it's been really strange because when I left Fox that was on a prompting I mean I went to I went to Billy Graham and talked to him about it and Billy Graham said I said I'm leaving Fox and I wanted to talk to you about it and he said that sounds like something I would do if I were the adversary convinced you to leave Fox and I said well I don't think it was I think it's prompting from Lordan he said tell me about it and so we sat and talked we were supposed to spend about 20 minutes we know spending about five hours together and he in the end agreed with me and my thinking but I knew that I had done my best mm-hm and I believed in what I said but the country was spiraling out of control and was that that's what convinced Billy Graham to convince Billy Graham of something that's that's it yeah I mean I don't want to I don't want to you know yeah but it was it was spiritual in nature and it was about reconciliation and he said you know reluctantly I like okay I think you're right and because I was very upset when that show I love that show I knew I had all the time it was so fun it was on when I was in college we we would insist on having your show on all the time Fox was on a lot but we would sit around the TV in common yeah it was Rachel fun yeah it was it scared the crap out of Fox cuz it was it was ad lib right and we would turn in a script every day and they would pour over it and then I'd get in and I'd say you turn off the teleprompters and you know so they they were just freaked out I had everybody mean I had the I know cuz I know people at the White House I had people at the White House senior watching every episode we had Media Matters watching episode we had everyone watching every episode going looking god what is he gonna do what's he gonna do it's cousin ray an early understanding of podcasts right because when you go on to even if I'll go on Fox & Friends for a three second hit and everything bulleted its laid out the Chiron's everything's really set podcast though I mean we don't have a script you'll night you notice there's no no papers yeah and it's and it was um you know it was just speaking from the heart and just and just laying it out and not caring you know carrying it that we did a good job in the got it right but not him I mean if you know what what I loved about that show and all of your work is it wasn't it wasn't talking points it you would bring in history you would bring in what everything and and you had fun with it I mean it was a dirty word for conservatives or it shouldn't when when September 11th happened I had no idea I mean I had just signed a deal with with premier and but I wasn't national yet and I was supposed to start January 2002 excuse me and I had just signed the deal in August and and what I was doing was a parody of talk radio it wasn't serious okay most people don't know this but I mean I used to you know I used to do 40 40 nights on the road with comedy and and so when September 11th happened they called me and said we need you on the air now nationally and honestly Michael I spent I spent about three days solid beforehand on my nice going I'm the wrong guy Lord what am i doing I know why are you making me do this I don't know any of this stuff okay I mean I paid attention somewhat you know when I was in New York and at WABC in 98 or 99 I remember we bombed a not aspirin factory I'm not sure what the date was but Clinton built on this as he needed to get Lewinsky out of the headlines that's what everybody said and I caught I was on the air that day and I had done my homework yeah he was going after a guy that nobody had ever heard of and I started doing my research on him and I said okay I know everybody thinks he's trying to get but I want you to listen to this guy and I read all of his words and he was coming to New York and he was gonna kill us and the phone's blew up everybody's saying you're just loved Clinton I'm like I don't like what are you talking about and I met me yeah I mean maybe I don't like Clinton no it's not his policies I'm telling you he's right on this one and I remember saying on the air within ten years in this city buildings bodies and blood in the street and it'll have this man's name on it I forgot about that until September 11th the name was Osama bin Laden Wow and all you have to do is take people seriously and read so I had done some but not really I mean somebody called me up and said where do you stand on you know the the Israelis and the Palestinians oh no it's me I don't know I mean far as I was concerned at that time the whole thing could go into a sinkhole they're never there never gonna solve it we've been battling forever I've got the answer I've got the answer yeah just don't talk to each other yeah so I had no idea and all of a sudden this big burden of responsibility you know Ezekiel 33 comes I think it's 33 37 33 where he says you know I will place Watchmen on the on the towers and gates and if that watchman sees trouble coming and doesn't blow his trumpet the blood on everyone that could have been rescued is on his hands well that's millions for me and if I really truly believed it I had to say it so when I got to Fox I wanted to say it as I knew that nobody wanted to eat that cuz I had just gone through 2008 right and man I lost stations and money and everything else because 2006 I was saying financial crisis could collapse the entire comic on ax me could collapse the european-cut economy cuz this is all bogus I don't even know how it works and you know at the time I was up reading about the freaking money supply on a prompting I got so mad at god I'm reading about the m1 m2 m3 money supply and it's like 2006 and I'm in bed it's 3 o'clock and I'm reading this trying to understand it and I it might kind of have kind of an is real you know relationship yeah yeah a little-little struggle with him and I remember I the book aside get off me never gonna need this I don't know what you're making me read this for and and then the economy collapses and Barack Obama gets in and Roger Ailes had been yeah courting me for a while and I kept saying no and I didn't want to do cable news but I knew then that it was it was kind of too divine to be that that platform to be available right and so I I signed a deal for two years and decided to entertain the folk a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down that's and that point is I think it's really lost on people and maybe it was lost in to some people in the Fox audience because if you go at if you use a little human if you go out and have a little I've been using a little cough FA you know if you have a little bit of that and then you get some eyeballs and you get a real message as long as you don't violate the principles my right my problem was in some ways the press and the fact that John Stewart now this is a really delicate line that I don't see there's a difference but I think others do John Stewart did with a whole bunch of writers what I was doing every day for an hour right with one and it's just the difference was I was on a news channel he was on the comedy channel now I contend if I did it on the comedy channel they still wouldn't have been okay with it well certainly there wouldn't hired you often yeah right so it doesn't matter but that's that was the excuse that it was mocking you know the news and in a way that's true I mean you know when you know that an industry it's it literally if you look back when someone comes to the inside and mocks it and ridicules it from the inside it's over right and I think I think I was the sign that news is over it was oh and it assured in this totally different world I mean we are in a totally different world now no millennial I know has cable they don't even pay for game no it is all Internet it's all new media it's all podcasts Netflix whatever streaming I'm not doing any mainstream media for this book you're not going on TV or he'll some work out because you know what Joe Rogan Joe Rogan to me was the I said this a couple of weeks ago when Elon Musk was on yeah and you know the stock Marko's down now I I'm I put in my calendar roken Elon Musk I don't want to miss it right hey and you brought that that great little bong the other day yes I don't know what you're talking about but so he's on with Rogen and the stock market goes down yeah and I'll bet you 60% of the people in the media industry had no idea and a good portion of that didn't even know who Joe Rogan was and a portion of that didn't know what a podcast was they're just so arrogant out of touch it's over it's over that's right that's so glam the you know you get knocked for catastrophizing you get but the trouble is that you're often write about the catastrophes that you're seeing so give me a happy note give me something here do you see happy do you think I'm an optimistic catastrophist be good there must be like a Gilbert and Sullivan song this seems like a good thing to me the new media at least this part the new media allow conservatives especially to get our message out there unvarnished undistorted unpervaded you're you're selling books on new media because that's where the eyeballs are people are tuning out of CNN there too so I absolutely agree with you but it requires us in it and I urge you to read the books yes yesterday look for it you will enjoy it in because it talks about what's happened to us why it's happened to us and what's happening right now is the the post modernists they are changing they're changing everything because they have since the Paris riots in the 60s and 70s they realized they could not take the Western world and destroy it just through culture mm-hmm and they learned it in the 60s so they came back and they looked at post-modernism and said okay how do we make this to destroy the West entirely all of it bring it down at the same time so then you're free to start Marxism eroding whatever you want some people see things that never were and ask why not why direct so if you if you understand that then you can start to change your argument because the more you throw it back in anger the you're throwing accelerant on the fire and I think they're gonna scare a lot of people that don't want to lose capitalism well you know on the left to right I know a lot of people that vote differently than me that don't want to lose capitalism pretty good it's been pretty darn sweet the problem is we are up against the clock now I think our economy is it's a matter of time before that comes apart I'm hoping that it keeps lasting as long as it can you have Russia nobody's paying attention to a guy named Alexander Dugan and everyone your age should be paying attention to him because he is targeting people like you and it's a very dangerous philosophy you have the middle east and worst of all you have tech you have high tech which is starting a timebomb in one and and also as they start that time bomb they are gathering more and more information which is more and more power information and knowledge is power and and then doing strange things like working with the Chinese who are literally turning that into all that's right yes 1984 it's you know it's horrible what's coming there we have to remain Americans remain calm find as many like-minded people that want to live in capitalism and freedom and understand the Bill of Rights I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care I don't care what you've done in the past well unless your story your oh yeah yeah well but but let's start looking to the future and if we if we hold together and we begin to talk about the ethical uses of technology we're going to enter a time that will be will have freedom beyond any of our expectations the world in the next ten years is going to change so dramatically that ten years from now you'll watch this and it will feel like watching I Love Lucy seriously well that that is a happy note to end on and it does remind me that you are truly the master broadcaster because that is the greatest possible segue I have ever heard for the ethical use of technology to go over and subscribe at daily wired.com and thank you very much for being here q and one Shapiro you she driving out of town on a rail oh he's going to do well then I'll heat up out of Texas not only telling you this is a friend of yours and his what he says privately about you is it is profane pornographic oath over I I say to him you're Orthodox or Emily and he just goes off and I didn't even know that was a word yeah that mental or telling me I bet you bet in the privacy of our own yeah I mean we're not on the air now where we know what no I'm here that's right you seen that you know what Glenn thanks for being thank you all right I'll see you every city all right Glen get out of my hotel room so I have that whole time that we've been airing that I have been watching the live testimony of judge Cavanaugh it was stunning I we came for the drama we got the drama I will be going over some immediate reactions to that right now it was really something else before we do the plus we're in have the mail back by the way we're gonna have to fit a lot of that in maybe we'll have to do a little mailbag tomorrow but before we do that I have got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube sorry guys go to daily wire if you were dealing wire calm thank you very much you helped us keep the lights on you keep qoph fa in my cup usually right now I've just got like a hotel room coffee but usually I have a leftist ears tumblr which is really what you need to sign up for you get all the shows bench bureau and replevin me you get to ask questions the mailbag blah blah blah blah you're gonna need the leftist ears tumblr for when judge Kavanagh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court go to daily wire calm we'll be right back okay okay so we've got some immediate reactions to this I had it on the TV is right over here I was watching that live testimony Judge Cavanaugh there was some debate among analysts earlier is Cavanaugh going to come and you know be very staid and quiet and judicial let it go or is he gonna bring it is he gonna defend his reputation and fight back he fought back oh my goodness he punched back he talked about how unfair it was he he hit them hard he brought it he had calendars from the damn summer where did he find these calendars that he talked about he said oh my father kept all the calendars for from like the 70s which is by the way all our old nature's but aren't unknown today a divine providential strike of luck it it was really incredible and it by the way it was convincing it was I mean at this point if judge Cavanaugh is lying this guy is one hell of a psychopath it was he looked like a man who was wrongly accused it looked like the crucible you know John Proctor and the crucible or something really it was a stunning testimony I want to really analyze this when we've got video because it's still going on right now so we're gonna get to that more tomorrow but a stunning performance my takeaway is all in all Christine Ford did fine she didn't she didn't do bad she did contradict herself a little bit she did seem a little kind of one minute she was kind of laughing and then the next she was really serious and shaky voice it was a little weird but it was fine wasn't it actually wasn't bad she sort of did well by her and her Democrat friends but Cavanaugh did really really well he did really well so obviously if there's any justice in the world you give it to Cavanaugh you can I mean there's no no evidence at all he called it he called the to sweat Nick allegations that he was running a gang rape syndicate he called it a force and a joke it was really excellent excellent stuff I'm gonna vote for this guy for president I don't know what it is in the last couple years the Republicans have grown a backbone but I'm really pleased to see it this is really good we can't let them do this if we let them get rid of know who's left who goes up who goes up to the Supreme Court the guy is virtually perfect he's got this unimpeachable record and if you can't get him through who do you get through it we can't let them do it really good stuff okay we got to get to the mailbag I probably only have about five minutes left but c'est la vie we'll do it first question from Madeline hi Michael I used to identify with liberals in my college days but my views have since swung to the right since my mid-20s while I strongly agree with almost everything the left does I don't think that everyone who identifies with the left is a bad person I think many on the Left are coming from a place of genuine compassion for others with that said who do you believe is strategically behind the evil ideologies and policies they're supported by the left yeah I don't think that many or certainly not most and probably even I don't think very many lefties are bad people I think that they're misguided or overly emotional or wrongheaded GK Chesterton put it very well when he was talking about his friend George Bernard Shaw he said that it's not that Shaw doesn't have a heart he's got a very big heart it's just a heart in the wrong place and I think lefties hearts are in the wrong place they're progressive so they're progressing toward utopia the idea is that mankind is perfectible we're caught there's an obvious progress that we're going toward and so therefore if you stand in the way of progress if you stand to thwart history yelling stop if you're a conservative then you are either very stupid or evil you have bad intentions and for smart conservatives for conservatives who can even string a few words together it's not the former so it has to be the latter that's why they impugn our our ideas but they but we don't really impugn or they impugn our motives but we don't really impugn their motives and so that's the ideology I mean who's behind the ideology name your pick karl marx nietzsche i don't know it's bad ideas bad ideas are behind it and you know the devil's behind it when you trace bad ideas back far enough you get to the devil but it's i think it's caused by pride and it's no coincidence that the left embraces pride all over not just gay pride but all you know fat pride didn't racial pride not wipe right obviously but other racial provides you know a lot of pride and that's where it comes from from Seth hi Michael I've been watching the Cavanaugh confirmation process as closely as most something's bothering me clearly the Democrats are doing whatever they can to delay his confirmation with the hope of retaking the Senate November stalling it indefinitely my question isn't it hypocritical percent of Republicans to contain a complaint about these blatant political tactics considering that in 2016 they they did virtually the same thing in delaying Merrick Garland's confirmation one thing that has driven me crazy about the modern American Left is its inconsistency in ideology and approach to issues so when so-called conservatives have engaged in similar behavior it's troubling thanks and keep up the good work thank you for the question Seth but you are totally wrong I'm sorry to say totally wrong yeah it's true Republicans politically stalled Merrick Garland's nomination we knew it we knew we could do it we knew that the election was going to decide it so we just stalled it forever what we didn't do is call him a rapist crime syndicate mobbed on who just goes around raping women from 36 years ago we didn't do that at all we just delayed it like civilized human beings like people who aren't wicked little hysterical child monsters but what they have done what the left is done here is based on nothing nothing they have tried to ruin a good man's reputation with no evidence if they had any evidence whatsoever if they had any corroboration then maybe you could consider it but there's no corroboration there's nothing actually the people who would be called under corroborated deny that any of it ever happened that have been called on by the accuser it's total nonsense and it's really really wicked and look if they had just said we're not gonna we're not gonna confirm Cavanaugh fine but they couldn't get away with that because they don't have the votes I mean that's what that's politics politics is a bloodsport but what they've done to this man is purely wicked for how much more time do I have I can probably one or two more right from Samuel dear Michael I have a moral question regarding hacking I've learned a way to observe other people's network activity via packet sniffing my question is this is it moral to spy on another person if they leave tear information on protected to spy on their computer searches I don't know is it moral to spy on someone if they leave their bathroom window open do you think that's moral said you see a cute little girl in the shower and you look through a window what are you Brett Kavanaugh I'm kidding I'm kidding it's a very heated subject today it well it depends on what the spying is if you're spying on some bad guy to achieve a certain good who's doing something illegitimate or something criminal then I suppose it's fine especially if you're a civil authority but if you're just spying because you're a little curious yeah that's not fine at all it's no better than being a peeping tom in someone's bathroom window can I do one more I want to do one more I'm gonna do one more from Sean hello Michael love the show I just had a question regarding all of these claims of sex allegations listening to people like you been Andrew Matt Crowder and Levin helped keep me sane I'm not the only person wanting evidence I just want to ask why colleges are canceling classes and leftist mobs surrounding Ted Cruz over allegations when these same people are doing nothing over the allegations of Keith Allison that has police reports and medical evidence of his abuse of his ex-girlfriend because they don't care because they don't care about rape and they don't care about sexual assault they did this to George Will when he was contradicting the reigning orthodoxy and ideology about sexual abuse on college campuses and they said you don't take it seriously a bunch of idiot senators like including what is Warren I think and his response was perfectly right which is that he said I think that I take sexual assault much more seriously than you do because he's unwilling to make a political circus out of it because he's unwilling to use it as a cudgel against people that he happens not to like because he's unwilling to use it as a wedge to affect a certain political agenda and that's exactly what these Democrats are doing today it's disgusting it it offers no advantage or consolation to victims of rape and sexual assault it trivializes it they do this on campus when they try to take sexual assault out of courtrooms and put it into campus tribunals obviously it tramples on the rights of the accused the rights to due process but it tramples on the it diminishes the crime itself because rape is a serious crime it should be taken very seriously it should not be tried by a bunch of bumbling professors or daughter endemic that's trying to angle themselves for 2020 campaigns in a kangaroo court circus before the Senate Judiciary Committee it's a real crime and it should be taken seriously if you're not gonna take it seriously that's my show mo angry about these Cavanagh things I will be tonight at the Kavanagh at the Kavanagh at the Franciscan University of Steubenville so we're gonna be talking about the simple joys of being right I'll be able to channel all of my frustration into an understanding of the joys of being conservative and we got other speeches coming up to October 24th October 25th will release more information about that soon in the meantime we're gonna have to get two more mailbag tomorrow that's just the way it is too bad in the meantime I'm Michael knows this is the michael whole show i'll see you either tonight or tomorrow
