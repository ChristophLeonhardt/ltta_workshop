 
I feel there's something changing
In realtime
It's a transformation that I
Can't hide no
You light me up like it's nothin'
You making' me into something
With a fire inside
Yeah
When I'm fallin' apart
Yeah you're always my safety net
Take a jump
Off the edge
And I know
That you'll never
Let me fall
It's a rush to the senses
Such a sweet luminescence
That I can't quite describe
Oh I'm seeing sound in colour
Every time that I get around ya
Oh Oh Oh
No I'll never
Let you go
You got me headed straight
For the skyline
Turning every echo into
A symphony
And my heart's screaming loud
Yeah
Since you came around
Yeah
No I can't turn it down
When I'm fallin' apart
Yeah you're always
My safety net
Take a jump
Off the edge
And I know
That you'll never
Let me fall
And I don't mean
To push no
I just thought that
You should know
You take the weight
Off my mind
Oh
I'm seeing sound in colour
Yeah
Every time that I get around ya
Oh Oh Oh
No I'll never
Let you go
Colour
Colour
Colour
Oh
I'm seeing sound in colour
Everytime the I get around ya
Oh Oh Oh
No I'll never
Let you go
Oh I'm seeing sound in colour
Everytime that I get around ya
Oh Oh Oh
No I'll never
Let you go
Colour
Colour
Colour
Colour
