Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt sometimes known as Brangelina are getting a divorce which is an important story because actually I don't know what the end of that sentence is but news that the star of World War Z was being divorced by the woman who's totally nude sex scene beginning one hour and 37 minutes and 14 seconds into the film original sin made me forget what I was saying Brad Pitt told reporters quote I was like totally totally surprised to discover Angelina was not charmed and delighted by the fact that I was banging my co-stars on other movies how could she not love the fact that I was smoking so much dope that I finally began to understand why Ocean's thirteen is such a classic classic motion picture or at least a mind-blowing series of hallucinations passing between my eyelids and an inner universe that extends from my retina to that weird dimension in interstellar where Matthew McConaughey floated around like an idiot in the part I could have absolutely killed unquote that went on to say he was saddened by the breakup and wanted only the best for his children if he had any which he couldn't remember but if he did he wished them well and hope to see them sometime if he happened to be around where they were he said he regretted how much he'd hurt Angelina and had always thought he was just so hot and rich that she would consider herself lucky to have him whatever he did in an interview with variety Pitt added quote look at this face look how handsome it is how can my wife not love it my mistress loves it or maybe my wife loves it my mistress doesn't I always get those two confused which is the one who's divorcing me unquote as for Angelina Jolie she said she had been absolutely shocked to find that her husband was sleeping with other women who hadn't adopted 47 handicapped children and weren't constantly a Marine on about poverty in some godforsaken hellhole and who knows where Africa or someplace instead of making him dinner she told The Hollywood Reporter quote I never imagined when I stole Brad away from Jennifer Aniston that he could be unfaithful and I don't understand why he would run off with some young chippy with a sense of humor when he could be with someone who takes herself as seriously as I do I just assumed he married me because he cared about world peace he said something about peace I remember you're a nice piece I think it was I feel so betrayed news of the Brangelina breakup broke the hearts of the couples fans and many other people with nothing better to think about arguments broke out on Twitter about which of the stars should now be called bran and which one Jelena has one fan put it quote I am absolutely devastated to find that my life is so empty I'm paying attention to the crappy love lives of essentially boring people who don't know I exist also because there won't be a sequel to mr. and mrs. Smith mostly it's about the sequel unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show the greatest video ever made born that is the greater and we Esther day I paid tribute

you know you had it with the phone and everything it was like it the world of wonders man it was like suddenly people are actually that was to pitch my book the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ and now listen even if you didn't pre-order it you have by it now because now I'm being attacked by Jews I'm already being attacked by anti-semites this is a really I feel like it's a pincer movement I've get attacked by the alt-right anti-semites who are calling you dirty Jew and now the Jews are writing articles on like websites that I contribute to these are like you know I mean you became a Christian you can't do that one guy said you can't become a Christian until you're seriously a Jew and I thought well you know if I knew you made the rules I would have checked in with you first but I thought you were just some guy so anyway you have to buy the book because you have to you know save me from all right you know the reason I wrote this book I'm gonna talk about this a little bit more next week but one of the reasons I wrote this book is because I feel that the narrative is such a powerful force you call it the intellectual current the intellectual atmosphere of the time just this world we live in I always think about George Washington this man of incredible virtue who gave away a kingdom nobody in history has ever given away a kingdom he held it in his hands and he said nope I want you to be free take the kingdom away and he had that much virtue and yet when his slaves escaped he was like might they escape we treated them so well he he didn't understand that's because he was immersed in the intellectual atmosphere of his time and we all are and I feel the intellectual atmosphere of our time is relentlessly secular relentlessly unbelieving and I wanted to show how one person came out of that atmosphere in Hollywood in New York words thick as it can possibly be but that narrative also applies to the stuff that's going on today they've now declared a state of emergency in Charlotte North Carolina where essentially black people black blacks are rioting because a thug with a gun was killed by police when he turned with the gun which I always thought was kind of you know what is supposed to happen basically there's one guy has been when citizen has been shot by another citizen and is in critical condition I don't think he's died but he was on life support last time I checked the dashboard video shows this guy Keith Scott they were trying to exercise a warrant Keith Scott was not the guy the warrant was for they told him to get out of the car so they could check him out he stepped out with the gun and one of the shot him and the police chief care Putney explained to reporters that he didn't they asked him that he have to did he point the gun directly at the police officer like the cop is supposed to wait you can find out and chief Putney explains what the law is about this the totality of the situation is what carries the day so if I'm making gestures if I'm focusing in if I'm turning my body in a certain way to look aggressive and to give you the the understanding that an imminent threat is very very likely and I'm armed all of those things in and conjunction with one another can still give you that perceived threat under North Carolina law okay obviously I mean that makes sense to anybody who's paying an attention guy you know you're out there you're trying to get home to your wife and kids you're trying to keep the neighborhood safe but also not get blown away by some nut bag or some thug with a gun you know guy steps out do they I mean think about it for a minute police say would you sir would you step out of the car please yeah and I'm gonna bring my gun with me you know what do you mean you're gonna shoot me I don't get it all right so now let's just go back and remember I want to go back in time just a little bit this is just a month ago maybe a month and a half ago let's not forget that Barack Obama has lent credence to this black lives matter hate movement from the start he is the guy who has emphasized every time a black officer this this guy with the officer was black here too but he has emphasized that black people are being mowed down by police which statistics show is absolutely untrue that black that cops are much more likely to use force against white people or use deadly force against white people but you know the President of the United States has given credence to this movement he was questioned in Madrid Spain because this president loves to go overseas inthis his country and he was questioned about black lives matter and I want you to listen to his answer that he gave you know about the riots growing out of black lives matter one of the great things about America is that individual citizens and groups of citizens can petition their government can protest can speak truth to power and that is sometimes messy and controversial but because of that ability to protest and engage in free speech America over time has gotten better we've all benefited from that the abolition movement was contentious the effort for women to get the right to vote was contentious and messy there were times when activists might have engaged in rhetoric that was over heated and occasionally counterproductive but the point was to raise issues so that we as a society could grapple with it so it's the abolition movement it's the women's rights movement and it gets just just a little bit contentious and messy let's take a look at how contentious and messy units get yeah that's a little contentious a little messy there you know if for those of you who couldn't see it that was a mob of black rioters kicking the living daylights out of a white man who was begging them for mercy begging for mercy so that was kind of like the suffragettes did that you know when they wanted to vote you know they would just go out and they would find some some guy and you know kicking to death and you know while he begged for mercy abolition you know let's begin and we should begin with the premise here I mean abolition was to stop slavery people were being held slaves the suffragettes were fighting to get the franchise women wanted the right to vote these people are complaining because a guy with a gun waving gun at the police was shot by the cops okay that's that's the deal here you know my friend Glenn Reynolds who is does the wonderful Institute on that site just a terrific one of the original major blogs basically he has been suspended from Twitter because he saw rioters blocking traffic on the highways at in in Charlotte and he tweeted run them over run them over because what happens when that you stopped the cars they surround you they drag you out of the car they rock your car they can turn over the car and they just run over so they suspended him from Twitter they don't suspend you know there are Twitter accounts with the title eff the police I checked this morning they are not suspended there are horrible things being said about white people they are not suspended this is the control of the narrative the narrative has to be that these people are somehow oppressed that this is that this issue has legitimacy every fact we have everything we know and we had Heather McDonald on who has studied this stuff and reported on it and gone into the streets and reported on it everything we know shows that this narrative is false this is a false narrative the police are not killing black people you know in some untoward way and again there's so many people in this country so many police offers and the officers in this country so many incidents in this country that the couple of times a year that something goes wrong and somebody does something is a lot of times it may be just they made a mistake in the moment of danger but the assumption that because one person is black and the other person is white race was an issue is just a false narrative assumption and of course now Hillary Clinton the polls are closing on her she's still ahead according to The Wall Street Journal I don't know how she's this just speaks about who these two people are that she's still ahead but she is clinging to her lead so now she goes on and she seizes on this and she thinks she can play this narrative to gain votes now this is her speaking yeah so that here's her seizing on the black lives matter narrative I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days first an unarmed man named Terrence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa then a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families I know a lot of you are as well there is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents but we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters it's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable we also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week and last night in Charlotte 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death every day police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage honor and skill now I wanted to play that whole thing I didn't want to isolate the point part where she says it's intolerable that guys with guns are being shot by officers with guns I can tolerate that by the way yes I have no problem I see better at night in fact I thought find it very very tolerable when police officers kill guy random guys getting out of their cars waving guns at them I can fully tolerate that but then she goes on to do this the Democrat two-step which is so you can go back and look at that and say yeah but I didn't say you should go out and kill cops and allyce's Obama does this too I said nice things about the police too but there is no moral equivalence I mean think back for a minute to care Putney the police chief we saw it at the opening of the show think back to David Brown the massively great police chief in Dallas he was the police chief in Dallas oh I'll get back to that in a minute and then just look at this is a guy who says that he is the dead guy's brother Lamont Scott's brother this is the other side I think we should know Devils it wasn't a white cop who shot this guy it was a black cop who shot the guy I mean what is this about and this is this is what is driving me crazy is these guys these black police officers and black police chiefs who are so obviously all-american heroes are being lumped in with guys like that I got to say goodbye to Facebook and you too but come on over to the Daily wire and hear the rest
