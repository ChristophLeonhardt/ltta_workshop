1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,527
>> Martha: IT WAS A SLIDE TO

2
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:15,962
THAT MY NEXT GUEST WILL NEVER

3
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:16,295
FORGET.

4
00:00:16,295 --> 00:00:17,897
ALLISON WAS 22 WEEKS PREGNANT

5
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,199
AND ON HER WAY TO HAWAII WITH

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,535
HER HUSBAND DAVE FOR A BABY

7
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:22,835
MOVE.

8
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:24,704
BUT THINGS TOOK A TURN WHEN DAVE

9
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:26,706
LOOKED AT HER ASKING IF THERE

10
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,141
WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIS

11
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,710
EYE, AT THAT MOMENT SHE WATCHED

12
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,744
HER HUSBAND LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS

13
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:34,547
AT 35,000 FEET IN THE AIR.

14
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:36,849
HE HAD SUFFERED A STROKE AT JUST

15
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:38,184
30 YEARS OLD.

16
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:39,952
IT HAS BEEN THREE LONG YEARS OF

17
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:41,954
RECOVERY SINCE, BUT TODAY HE IS

18
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:44,190
ALIVE AND WELL AND WRITING AN

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,958
OP-ED ON FoxNews.com.

20
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,794
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN

21
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:50,163
DO EVERY DAY IS TO CHOOSE HOW

22
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:51,097
BEST TO LIVE.

23
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:53,933
JOINING ME NOW IS ALLISON WHO

24
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,401
CHRONICLES THEIR JOURNEY IN THE

25
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,137
NEW BOOK "BEAUTY AND THE BROKEN

26
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:00,640
PLACES" A MEMOIR OF LOVE, FAITH,

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,174
AND RESILIENCE.

28
00:01:01,174 --> 00:01:02,008
WELCOME.

29
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,944
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.

30
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:06,913
YOU WERE A PRODUCER RIGHT HERE

31
00:01:06,913 --> 00:01:08,614
AT FOX NEWS ON ONE OF MY SHOWS

32
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:09,949
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR CAREER

33
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,117
AS AN AUTHOR EVER SINCE YOU

34
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:11,417
LEFT.

35
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:13,352
THIS IS NOT A BOOK THAT YOU EVER

36
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:14,353
INTENDED TO WRITE.

37
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:14,954
>> CERTAINLY NOT AND NOT

38
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:16,522
SOMETHING THAT WE EVER INTENDED

39
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:18,724
TO LIVE THROUGH EITHER.

40
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:21,394
AND I WAS A WRITER AND I WROTE

41
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,996
FOR FICTION BOOKS, AND THIS WAS

42
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:25,531
SOMETHING THAT AS I TURNED TO

43
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,966
WRITING AS A WAY TO DEAL AND

44
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,335
PROCESS ON MY OWN AND SORT OF

45
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:30,736
EXPLAIN TO MY FAMILY WHAT WE HAD

46
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:31,837
BEEN THROUGH AND TO WRITE

47
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:33,339
LETTERS TO DAVE WHO COULD NOT

48
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,907
MAKE NEW MEMORIES.

49
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:36,542
IT BECAME THIS MUCH LARGER

50
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:38,511
WRITING PROJECT AND BECAME

51
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:39,011
SOMETHING BIGGER.

52
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,014
>> HE HAD A HIGHLY UNUSUAL

53
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,282
CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT HAPPENED

54
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:44,750
IN HIS BRAIN, HE WAS STUDYING TO

55
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,186
BE A SURGEON, HE WAS A RESIDENT,

56
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,054
HE HAD A BIG UNDERSTANDING OF

57
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,990
MEDICAL HISTORY AND ALL OF THIS,

58
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,259
AND TELL ME ABOUT ONE OF THE

59
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,260
INTERESTING THINGS THAT I READ

60
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,928
IN THE REVIEWS OF YOUR BOOK IS

61
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:57,329
THAT YOU ARE BRUTALLY HONEST

62
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,732
ABOUT HOW DEPRESSED YOU BECAME.

63
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,534
YOU HAD AN INFANT DAUGHTER AND A

64
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:02,935
HUSBAND WHO NEEDED YOU TO TAKE

65
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:03,936
CARE OF HIM.

66
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,739
>> YES, AND WHEN DAVE WOKE UP,

67
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:07,973
HIS BRAIN WAS LESS FUNCTIONAL

68
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,108
THAN THAT OF A NEWBORN PAID ONE

69
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:10,643
OF THE THINGS THAT NEWBORNS DO

70
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,111
IS THEY CRY, THEY DRINK, HE

71
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,379
COULD DO NONE OF THAT.

72
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,882
WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

73
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:19,351
OF DAVE COMPLETELY REGROWING A

74
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,786
BRAIN AND BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL

75
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,021
INDIVIDUAL HUMAN AGAIN.

76
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,322
WHILE WE WERE ALSO GOING THROUGH

77
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:26,192
THAT SAME PROCESS WITH OUR BABY.

78
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,359
>> Martha: HOW DID YOU DO

79
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:27,726
THAT?

80
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,762
>> THE WRITING SAVED ME, IT

81
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:30,529
ACTUALLY DID.

82
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:32,865
AND HE CANNOT MAKE NEW MEMORIES,

83
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,166
SO EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE WOULD GO

84
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,036
TO BED AT 7:00 P.M., BECAUSE HE

85
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,305
WAS SO FATIGUED, I WOULD WRITE

86
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:42,341
TO HIM IN THE FORM OF THE DAVE

87
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,176
AND I HAD ONCE KNOWN, AND IF HE

88
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:44,977
EVER COMES BACK I CAN TELL HIM

89
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:46,545
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH AND WHAT WE

90
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:50,149
WENT THROUGH TOGETHER AND I JUST

91
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,952
SORT OF TRIED TO KEEP THIS IMAGE

92
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:54,353
ALIVE OF THE MAN THAT HE WAS SO

93
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:55,154
THAT WE COULD FIGHT TOGETHER FOR

94
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,956
HIM TO COME BACK INTO THAT

95
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:58,924
VERSION OF HIMSELF.

96
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,459
>> Martha: IT IS AMAZING, AND

97
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,961
TO YOUR WRITING IS CRYSTAL CLEAR

98
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,196
AS IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN, AND ALL

99
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:05,831
OF YOUR FICTION WORK AND I THINK

100
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,400
THAT'S WHAT MAKES A MEMOIR SO

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,102
RIVETING, BECAUSE YOU ARE SO

102
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:10,436
HONEST.

103
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:12,204
YOU WERE ANGRY.

104
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:15,341
>> ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT

105
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,575
A FELLOW BRAIN INJURY CAREGIVER

106
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,911
SAID TO ME WAS WELCOME TO THE

107
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,979
CLUBS OF THE BAD THINGS, I'M

108
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:21,547
SORRY IT'S A CLUB THAT YOU NEVER

109
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,016
WANTED ENTRY INTO, BUT AT SOME

110
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,150
POINT EVERY PERSON JOINS IT.

111
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,819
AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU AND DAVID

112
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,454
JOINED IT THIS WAY AT THIS AGE,

113
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:30,756
BUT THAT IS REALLY WHAT I HAVE

114
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:31,423
LEARNED THROUGH THE PROCESS

115
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,558
THROUGH WRITING AND SPEAKING

116
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:34,927
WITH READERS IS THAT OUR STORY

117
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,628
IS UNIQUE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

118
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,198
BUT THAT IT IS A VERY UNIVERSAL

119
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:39,498
THING.

120
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:42,334
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

121
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,402
HAPPENING NOW, YOU KNOW, HE IS

122
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:45,337
WRITING THIS OP-ED, AND YOU ARE

123
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:46,438
HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

124
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,173
>> WE ARE.

125
00:03:48,173 --> 00:03:48,841
QUITE FRANKLY IN THE VERY

126
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:49,942
BEGINNING I THOUGHT WHEN I DID

127
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,343
NOT KNOW IF HE WOULD SURVIVE, I

128
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:54,213
THOUGHT AT LEAST WE WILL HAVE

129
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:55,347
THIS ONE CHILD TOGETHER AND A

130
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:56,548
PIECE OF HIM WILL CONTINUE I

131
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:57,749
NEVER IN OUR WILDEST HOPES AND

132
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,218
DREAMS THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD BE

133
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:02,187
ABLE TO HAVE IN ADDITION TO OUR

134
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:02,521
FAMILY.

135
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:05,224
IT IS REALLY, DAVE SAID THAT WE

136
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:06,258
FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A SECOND

137
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:06,692
CHANCE.

138
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:08,927
AND TO THE LIFE THAT WE WERE

139
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,129
PLANNING ON GOT COMPLETELY

140
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,263
DERAILED, BUT WE ARE EMBRACING

141
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,599
THE BEAUTY AND PLANNING FOR THE

142
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,099
FUTURE.

143
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,601
>> Martha: GOOD FOR YOU,

144
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,101
BECAUSE LIFE THROWS CURVEBALLS

145
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,103
AND NOBODY EVER WANTS THEM TO

146
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,938
HAPPEN, BUT YOU HAVE DEALT WITH

147
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:22,140
IT WITH GRACE, AND YOU SAY THAT

148
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,443
DAVE PLAYED A LARGE PART, HOW?

149
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:26,545
>> I REALIZED IN THE DARKEST

150
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,513
LOWEST MOMENTS THAT I COULD SAY

151
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:30,349
GOD IS GOOD, WHEN EVERYTHING WAS

152
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,550
GOING WELL, AND THAT WAS REALLY

153
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,618
JUST A MATTER OF AGREEING WITH

154
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,153
THE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE, IT WAS

155
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:36,888
WHEN THINGS WERE NOT GOOD AND

156
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,089
WHEN I WAS NOT IN CONTROL AND IT

157
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,691
WAS SCARY AND I WAS ANGRY AND

158
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,059
I'M SAD THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY

159
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:41,760
WHAT FAITH WAS.

160
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,794
IT WAS A MOMENT WHEN THERE WAS

161
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:43,995
NO PROOF THAT THINGS WILL BE

162
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,498
GOOD AGAIN.

163
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:48,200
AND MY FAMILY AND OUR LOVED ONES

164
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,135
IN DAVE'S FAMILY, THEY WERE

165
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,336
THERE IN THE MOMENTS WHEN WE

166
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,070
WERE NO LONGER STANDING ON HER

167
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,337
OWN.

168
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,939
AND THEY WERE THERE TO REALLY

169
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,340
PICK US UP.

170
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,508
THAT WAS HUGELY IMPORTANT.

171
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:57,776
>> Martha: IT HAPPEN WHEN YOUR

172
00:04:57,776 --> 00:04:58,910
DAD WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

173
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,046
>> YES, SO I CALLED MY PARENTS

174
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:03,348
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FROM

175
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,883
THE FARGO ICU, MAKING THIS

176
00:05:04,883 --> 00:05:06,384
EMERGENCY MEDICAL LANDING AND WE

177
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:08,353
DID NOT KNOW IF HE WOULD

178
00:05:08,353 --> 00:05:11,323
SURVIVE, SO BOTH OF OUR PARENTS

179
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:12,324
GOT ON THE FIRST FLIGHT TO SAY

180
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:13,892
GOODBYE OR JUST BE THERE NO

181
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,560
MATTER WHAT HAPPENED, AND MY DAD

182
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,828
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN

183
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:19,130
NEW HAMPSHIRE, SO HE HAD TO

184
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,465
CANCEL AND GIVE SOME SORT OF

185
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:24,536
REASON AS TO WHY HE WAS

186
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:25,603
CANCELING, SO THEN IT WAS A

187
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:29,307
LARGER STORY, BUT THE RIVALS ON

188
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,842
