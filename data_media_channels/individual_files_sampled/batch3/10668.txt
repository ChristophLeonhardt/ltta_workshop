leaders of the Muslim world have held an emergency summit and called on the international community to recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine Charlotte Dubinski reports well I'm standing just outside of Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem which now has according to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation been named the capital of a Palestine in direct contradiction to what we heard from Donald Trump of the USA's position at just a week ago where they said Jerusalem and undivided Jerusalem was in their mind the capital of Israel that extraordinary meeting came as fifty-seven leaders from Muslim countries across the world four continents met together at that meeting that was convened by Turkey's president Erdogan now we also heard them condemn that pronunciation by Donald Trump and they called on all the nations of the world to recognize East Jerusalem as being the capital of Palestine we also heard from the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas who said he would now go to the United Nations Security Council meeting to ask for full membership for Palestine we will go to the General Assembly regarding the membership of Israel because it's not in line with the international resolutions we will also go to the Peace and Security Council to consider the question of Palestine full membership we also heard at that oh I see meeting that they believed that the USA has lost its ability to be a peace broker an honest broker between Israel and Palestine going forward saying that the USA was neither honest nor impartial or neutral when it comes to the situation between Israel and Palestine mr. odden also went on to describe Israel as being a terror state hey Trump are you back in this country this Israel where there is occupation torture and terrorism is that where you are defending well that decision by Donald Trump a week ago to name Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has caused tensions not just in Israel and Palestine but it's caused tensions across the wider area and that's why that extraordinary meeting was convened on Wednesday the question is is this exactly what he wanted did he really want to pit himself against 57 leaders of other nations and if so have they played directly into his hands Charlotte dibinsky RT East Jerusalem
