1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
they have two bad choices to survive one

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,339
work in the garment factory which is by

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,790
far the largest employer or to work in

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,110
the sex industry there aren't a lot of

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:21,029
other options for women there hi

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,820
talk about two stories that I produced

this past year about human trafficking

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,130
and labor exploitation in Asia I'm

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really looking forward to having a good</font>

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,980
conversation so let's get started with

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,780
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> good questions Andrew thanks for</font>

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,760
coming on the show today and we have a

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,230
bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are excited to talk</font>

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,360
to you and the first person is Regina

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calling us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from Washington</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DC on</font>

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,320
skype so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Regina hey okay so</font>

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,899
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple of questions my first</font>

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,629
one being that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambodia suroosh was</font>

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,219
asked by the management to help

22
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,440
negotiate the contract with the workers

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,550
and in that way he kind of inserted

24
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,979
himself in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this story he was reporting</font>

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:07,770
on and so my question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that is why</font>

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,320
did you allow for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> journalists insert</font>

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,830
himself in that situation well it

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,500
happened naturally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we never obviously</font>

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,240
set out to do that we didn't even know

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,409
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting into the</font>

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,750
into the garment factory until it

32
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,590
happened and then he was sort of pushed

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,189
in front of the workers by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the by the</font>

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,140
owners of the garment factory who

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,670
thought that he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present</font>

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,049
their story<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the workers and i'm not</font>

37
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure what was going through their minds</font>

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,130
but this was all playing out and advise

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,740
what we're comfortable with is is being

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,149
transparent this is really what happened

41
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">we didn't set it up it happened and he</font>

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,610
actually kind of jujitsu did into a

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,920
great group interview I mean they

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,770
expected him<font color="#E5E5E5"> again to deliver their</font>

45
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,259
message to the thousand or so workers

46
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,180
that were in attendance and steady

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,250
turned it around and uses an opportunity

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,829
to say this is what the owner of the

49
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,299
company is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what your</font>

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:07,409
conditions are like and what you're

51
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,080
getting paid is it true and you can see

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,599
in the clip that we're about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

53
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,520
that

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,770
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually felt pretty strongly that</font>

55
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,720
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true so if you want let's</font>

56
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,140
watch the clip I had no intention of

57
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,520
being a mouthpiece of the factory

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
management so i took this opportunity to

59
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask the workers directly what they are</font>

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,800
actually paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> their bosses are saying</font>

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,900
that the minimum ocean

62
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,129
dollars and you are actually been made +

63
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:46,099
75 to 200 is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font>

64
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,270
so I really think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great way to</font>

65
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,700
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the disconnect between what</font>

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,470
the owners of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the factories were trying</font>

67
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,330
to sell us and sell their workers and

68
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,980
what the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you can see on</font>

69
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,260
their faces<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it happened in a real</font>

70
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,390
natural way we didn't set it up and we

71
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,680
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was worth worth keeping in</font>

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,620
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then my second questions</font>

73
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,190
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to Japan now and in the last</font>

74
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,020
story in Japan the woman I me the

75
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,300
correspondent is speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one of</font>

76
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,630
the women and she is explaining how

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,840
she's been sexually harassed by

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,690
management there and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's asked her</font>

79
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,400
what her biggest fear is and she says

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,920
it's her union and the union

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,230
representative and so I'm wondering if

82
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the union's</font>

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,070
about that and why the choice was made

84
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,070
to I guess talked to the guy that's

85
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,260
sexually harassing her versus the person

86
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,680
that's threatening to kill her so yeah

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,690
that's my question sure let's play the

88
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">clip of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of her interview for a</font>

89
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,860
second so we can get some context and

90
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,830
then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to answer the question</font>

91
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,630
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your biggest worry now what are</font>

92
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,590

so it gets over that I believe ha ha ha

100
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,680
causado shallow<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so to answer</font>

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,260
your question we were unable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get in</font>

102
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,479
touch with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Union and that was just</font>

103
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,419
one that was kind of a local union that

104
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,470
represents some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the agricultural</font>

105
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,850
workers and anecdotally we heard similar

106
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,410
heavy-handed accusation accusations of

107
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,300
being heavy-handed from other workers as

108
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,590
well other foreign workers specifically

109
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,440
we couldn't reach them we did reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

110
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,240
to the guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was her employer because</font>

111
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,150
we could we could find him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she made</font>

112
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,479
accusations not only to us<font color="#E5E5E5"> verbally but</font>

113
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,840
formally in writing to the Japanese

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,820
government it was a formal grievance so

115
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,320
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was important that he</font>

116
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,450
answered those accusations and that's

117
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,250
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we showed up at his place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and asked</font>

118
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,630
them to which he did to<font color="#CCCCCC"> his he actually</font>

119
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,240
denied the accusation so so that was the

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,180
story there<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and so then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

121
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,460
in the two cases can you talk more

122
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,950
broadly about the role of unions and if

123
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,500
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that overall they contribute</font>

124
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,710
more to work or well-being or like in

125
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,660
these situations do they make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

126
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,650
worse uh it's there's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

127
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,510
answers to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i'll start with</font>

128
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,780
Cambodia in Cambodia we had spoken to

129
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the union leaders representing</font>

130
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,440
garment workers and they the allegations

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,240
that we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workers that they</font>

132
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,039
represent is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these union leaders</font>

133
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,280
had been co-opted that and if you look

134
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">at their public posture it's not that</font>

135
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,620
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a stretch to believe that and</font>

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,060
when I say co-opted that they were

137
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,250
receiving this is allegations that we

138
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,950
couldn't confirm but the allegations are

139
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,520
that they were

140
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,099
saving kickbacks from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that</font>

141
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">employ these garment workers and</font>

142
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,539
therefore their their interests are

143
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,080
conflicted so in that case I can't say

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way or the other can't confirm</font>

145
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,169
one where the other but I do know that

146
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,759
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the confidence of their</font>

147
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,289
employee of their members their union

148
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,000
members which are the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,210
the confidence of their union

150
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,770
representatives sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the workers</font>

151
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,020
do not are not confident that the union

152
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,729
representatives are representing their

153
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,710
interests they believe they believe that

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,180
they are representing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests of</font>

155
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,750
the garment factories the employers

156
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,120
conversely when we we also were working

157
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,250
with sex workers in Cambodia and they

158
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,770
have unions in fact that we talked to

159
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,830
two union representatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> that represent</font>

160
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,720
thousands of sex<font color="#E5E5E5"> workers in Cambodia and</font>

161
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm pretty confident not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only based on</font>

162
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,259
just talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to the</font>

163
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,060
sex workers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they represent that</font>

164
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,069
they are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking after these</font>

165
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:21,289
women but they also seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really</font>

166
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,030
understand the woman's plight and we

167
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,440
they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us really good</font>

168
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,590
data on numbers of women who were

169
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,949
trafficked they alleged that a

170
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,650
relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> small percentage of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sex</font>

171
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">workers in Cambodia were trafficked</font>

172
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,669
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the irony that we were</font>

173
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:40,219
exploring in this piece and that that

174
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,440
most had made this horrible choice they

175
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,509
didn't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of choices they have</font>

176
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,409
two bad choices to survive one work in

177
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:49,909
the garment factory which is by far the

178
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:53,419
largest employer or to work in the sex

179
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,740
industry there aren't a lot of other

180
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,630
options for women there and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

181
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,610
pretty tragic so I was pretty confident

182
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,789
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the unions in Cambodia unions</font>

183
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:03,319
representing the sex workers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Cambodia</font>

184
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,659
we're doing very good work and and

185
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">really cared about the women</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

186
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:10,520
were looking after in Japan<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked</font>

187
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,349
specifically about the one union

188
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,539
representing agricultural workers that

189
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:16,490
we couldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch with and there</font>

190
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,020
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> alleged that they were threatening</font>

191
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,120
some of the workers we did work with

192
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,770
unions representing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the migrant</font>

193
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,810
workers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in fact one of the</font>

194
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,969
the head of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unions</font>

195
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:28,310
features prominently in our piece it's a

196
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,169
man named tori ebay who has been

197
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">recognized internationally and by the US</font>

198
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,089
State Department as someone who is one

199
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the few</font>

200
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,789
outspoken voices looking after looking

201
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the best interest of these migrants</font>

202
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:43,349
of these international interns so he's

203
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,930
doing great work as far as as I can see

204
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right thanks very much nice talking</font>

211
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,000
I had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I hope you'll</font>

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,149
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer the first one were you</font>

213
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,640
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out which Western brands</font>

214
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,890
are associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the sweatshops and</font>

215
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,950
the second question in these areas where

216
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,350
the sweat shops are located were you

217
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,180
able to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if there any other</font>

218
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,490
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> of employment thank you very much</font>

219
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I look forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your answers hey</font>

220
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">Clifton thanks very much for the</font>

221
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,450
question quick answer is we in when we

222
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">were in the actual factory that we were</font>

223
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,769
in we could see boxes and shipping

224
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,910
labels and documents that showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

225
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,620
these clothes were being made for old

226
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,310
navy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Benetton hmm and Russell athletics</font>

227
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,190
and then we went and confirmed that by

228
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,020
looking at bills of lading which are

229
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,079
often public documents so we found those

230
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,000
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be sure that we confirm</font>

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,450
that so that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where these this</font>

232
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,890
particular manufacturer was making

233
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,740
clothes for we as far as other job

234
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,279
opportunities Cambodia is extremely poor

235
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,620
there is not a lot of there aren't a lot

236
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,490
of opportunities which is why tragically

237
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,260
most women have to choose between these

238
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,899
two horrible jobs working in a garment

239
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,600
factory for very low wages long hours

240
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,790
and back-breaking outlet labor or doing

241
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,279
sex work which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is obviously a</font>

242
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,910
horrible choice as well so so that was

243
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,420
that's a major problem oh so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

244
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,829
Andrew we got another video message I

245
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,690
want you to take a listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to right this</font>

246
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,600
one's from re and re is also curious

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some stuff in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambodia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's</font>

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a listen great</font>

249
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,890
hi Andrew my name is Ari I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font>

250
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,510
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think that sex work in</font>

251
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,640
particular brings out this type of

252
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,649
visceral reaction especially from Cuban

253
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,420
rights activists especially in the West

254
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,089
this idea that industry needs to be shut

255
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,279
down the workers need to be somehow

256
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,110
rescued we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that kind of</font>

257
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,089
reaction in the other industry

258
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,740
especially the garment industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

259
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,690
there's also atrocious labor rights

260
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,019
violations we instead we look to change

261
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,490
the industry to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it better to raise</font>

262
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,670
wages why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think the two things</font>

263
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,200
have very different reactions from human

264
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,779
rights activists well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

265
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">great question and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the</font>

266
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,260
premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our piece and I want to</font>

267
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,480
preface my answer by saying these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

268
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,480
both horrible choices the both jobs are

269
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,930
terrible and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ironies that we</font>

270
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,420
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out is in this piece is</font>

271
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,329
that there's been enormous amount of

272
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">pressure from the west and particularly</font>

273
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,320
from the US State Department in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,230
of Cambodia<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Cambodia to address this</font>

275
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,500
human trafficking problem which<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

276
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,870
reporting and the reporting of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

277
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,310
United<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nations study that came out in</font>

278
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,279
2011 and other independent studies found

279
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,449
is grossly overstated again women

280
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:59,670
selling their bodies for next to nothing

281
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,120
is a horrible choice but what we learned

282
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,070
in our reporting is that many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

283
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,670
women actually had chosen that job over

284
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,740
garment work I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to say that</font>

285
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,690
they chose that profession because life

286
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,329
hasn't given them choices but they chose

287
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,070
it over garment work and so the irony

288
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,660
that we were exploring is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

289
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,910
program that Cambodia<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing that</font>

290
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,480
ostensibly as rescuing these women from

291
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,699
prostitution from human trafficking and

292
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:29,010
Retraining them for a new profession in

293
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,769
many ways was<font color="#E5E5E5"> rescuing them from a job</font>

294
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,300
that they didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be rescued from</font>

295
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were working for themselves and</font>

296
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,740
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into a profession that they</font>

297
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,190
had had<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen to to bypass and I want</font>

298
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you guys a clip it's a worker</font>

299
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,170
that we talked to who is illustrates

300
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,560
this she was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a a sex worker who was</font>

301
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">rescued forcing the garment trade in and</font>

302
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,949
went back and here's her story after

303
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,110
Pauly's arrest police released her into

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,239

my<font color="#E5E5E5"> new item nanamia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now they all think</font>

318
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going on so one of the things that</font>

319
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,529
we really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to explore is that this</font>

320
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,540
program that's supposed to be giving

321
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,449
women<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be helping women is is</font>

322
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:50,399
in many ways in many cases at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,389
cases that we saw is is taking away

324
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,100
their agency they had they had chosen

325
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,139
sex work over garment work and now they

326
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,230
were being forced into garment work and

327
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,240
again it wasn't just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

328
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,579
we talked to we talked to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

329
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,709
before we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to union</font>

330
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,649
representatives for the sex workers<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

331
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,959
are in contact with thousands of sex

332
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,059
workers and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely critical</font>

333
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,360
of this rescue program so that was to us

334
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,699
pretty pretty interesting and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

335
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the basis of the story so any other</font>

336
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,579
questions best yeah we got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

337
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,740
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things um you know Barbara Smith</font>

338
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,559
actually at Texas are tweeted us rather

339
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't text us anything I she tweeted</font>

340
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,980
us this question don't leave us as a

341
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,809
suspense Andrew tell us how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font>

342
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,119
actually gain access to the Cambodian

343
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:43,079
sweatshops well it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't easy and it's</font>

344
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,269
a case of kind of making<font color="#E5E5E5"> luck and</font>

345
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:47,610
seizing it when we when it was presented

346
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,689
to us we had tried for weeks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

347
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,399
permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> to film in the sweatshop it</font>

348
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,259
and actually I should call them garment

349
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,419
factories because sweatshop is kind of a

350
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:59,660
loaded term we had tried for weeks

351
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,869
through various representatives of the

352
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,730
garment factories there's a guy who

353
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,699
is in charge of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the coalition of</font>

354
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,100
garment factory owners and I guess I

355
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,889
shouldn't be surprised no one allowed us

356
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,070
to get in to film there and there hasn't

357
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,470
been a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of video footage in these</font>

358
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,930
places and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that should indicate</font>

359
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever owns these places doesn't</font>

360
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,750
think it's a worth the world shouldn't

361
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it that they have stuff to hide</font>

362
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,350
that's generally my my assumption in

363
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,459
these cases so what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

364
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,130
basically there was a this this rally

365
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,230
outside of one of the garment factories

366
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,019
and the women had gathered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front this</font>

367
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,050
was after a pretty tense<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning where</font>

368
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,880
some thugs who we never quite identified

369
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,310
where they came from had beaten some of

370
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,130
the protesters the women were angry and

371
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,560
they were outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saw ruched the</font>

372
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,040
host asked how would it take<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

373
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
inside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said follow us and they</font>

374
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,010
invited<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in pushed their way in</font>

375
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,199
actually and once we were in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

376
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,060
owners of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the garment factory rather</font>

377
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,310
than kicking us out welcomed us with

378
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,620
water and and brought us into their

379
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,569
conference room and told their story for

380
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:17,459
a while so we can show a clip here

381
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing that actually happening in real</font>

382
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to see the factory</font>

383
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,720
conditions that led these women to

384
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,519
strike but these factories are

385
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,130
notoriously difficult to get into

386
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,810
especially with cameras can you take

387
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside</font>

388
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,030
solid early we are not allowed in this

389
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">factory but if the workers all protect</font>

390
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,310
us then we can go in so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking</font>

391
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,120
us in to pick up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Potter a little bit</font>

392
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,350
security guys making calls right

393
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,330
before long someone from management

394
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,589
showed up to greet us so yeah then we

395
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,050
were in there the one downside is that

396
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,589
because most of the workers were had

397
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,959
walked out when we got inside there

398
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,180
wasn't there weren't a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

399
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,780
were working also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if we were to</font>

400
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,609
come in on any average day it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

401
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,680
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a feel for how bad life is</font>

402
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">there it's really a extended condition</font>

403
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,970
of heat and poor pay and no lunch breaks

404
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,070
it doesn't necessarily when you get in

405
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">there look awful although it certainly</font>

406
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,470
doesn't look nice and and everyone's

407
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,960
standing on their feet all day but it's

408
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you kind of have to understand what</font>

409
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,270
the what the conditions are like for

410
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,890
these women<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're not necessarily</font>

411
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,470
visual so thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the great question</font>

412
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,750
cool so speaking of great<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I</font>

413
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,670
know low it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some great questions for</font>

414
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,270
you so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hit him hi Andrew</font>

415
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,010
thanks for having<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

416
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions I wanted to pivot back to</font>

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,210
Japan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few minutes my first</font>

418
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,220
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how politically tenable do</font>

419
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,870
you think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for continued opposition</font>

420
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,180
for immigration reform and work visa

421
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,340
reform in Japan and at what point will

422
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> labor gap become drastic enough to</font>

423
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,290
change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> equation as far as I can</font>

424
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,870
tell and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great question Japan</font>

425
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't show any inclination to open its</font>

426
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,340
society up to more immigrants

427
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,020
particularly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current right-wing</font>

428
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,300
government for by basis of comparison

429
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Japan has about two percent of its</font>

430
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,310
population is foreign born in the US and

431
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,540
the UK have about twelve or thirteen

432
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,030
percent so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan has been very resistant</font>

433
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,970
for its existence it's modern existence

434
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,480
at least to allowing immigrants to come

435
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,260
in in a formal kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of immigrant given</font>

436
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,000
them giving them formal immigration

437
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,770
status so Japan shows no signs of

438
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,170
changing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime soon the way they</font>

439
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,090
are seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handling their labor</font>

440
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,700
shortage because also<font color="#CCCCCC"> this problem is</font>

441
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,970
compounded with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ageing population</font>

442
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,250
that's among<font color="#CCCCCC"> the oldest in the world</font>

443
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,510
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing in these interns in</font>

444
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,340
and so for the Olympics right now

445
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,520
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 150,000 foreign workers</font>

446
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,440
who are in Japan working under this

447
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,230
internship program and the government

448
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,350
wants to expand it to include another

449
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,110
70,000 migrant workers to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in as</font>

450
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,080
interns for Olympic preparation the

451
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,060
Olympics<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in 2020 and they have a lot</font>

452
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,520
of work to do so they're opening up the

453
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,680
program<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 70,000 more workers so you</font>

454
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,210
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge labor</font>

455
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,060
shortage and its projected to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

456
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,180
worse in the next several decades rather

457
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,030
than dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the system they seem</font>

458
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have the stopgap measure of bringing</font>

459
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,390
interns in from abroad right and

460
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,410
speaking more specifically about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

461
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,900
Olympics in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> run-up to the Olympics</font>

462
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,270
how attentive as a Japanese<font color="#CCCCCC"> news media</font>

463
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,220
been to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue or is there a level</font>

464
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,770
of complicity or inattentiveness and you

465
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,080
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to shift as we get closer I</font>

466
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,860
only know what I saw and and I talked to

467
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">some reporters in advance of this who i</font>

468
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,520
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recruit to help me out</font>

469
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this reporting and no one</font>

470
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,930
seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about it every time I</font>

471
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,880
brought it up it was something that was

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,580
news to them it has gotten some coverage

473
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,010
in the States but amazingly the Japanese

474
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,470
public and<font color="#CCCCCC"> even and I guess as a result</font>

475
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,840
of the Japanese reporters not knowing

476
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,700
much about it it just seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

477
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,860
of a blank<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot and whether the reason</font>

478
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,740
for that I don't know if it's because

479
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,570
they're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese media has not been</font>

480
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,570
critical about this if it's just so

481
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,740
established or really what the reason

482
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,780
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is but I can share with you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

483
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">one insight there was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

484
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known investigative reporter that</font>

485
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were talking to in advance of this we</font>

486
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,030
were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

487
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she didn't know anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but</font>

488
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,280
has since based on me presenting this

489
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,770
story to her is now kicking<font color="#E5E5E5"> off her own</font>

490
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,960
investigation so hopefully that you know

491
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's an important story and</font>

492
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,580
hopefully the Japanese public will learn

493
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right and in the same vein</font>

494
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,800
if I can follow up in the run-up to

495
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">qatar's bid for the World Cup we've seen</font>

496
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,690
wide coverage from human rights groups

497
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,630
and international news media but of

498
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,160
course as you said this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very much</font>

499
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,930
under the radar<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story how do you</font>

500
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:22,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font>

501
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,840
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that differential tube it's a</font>

502
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,580
great question i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in part</font>

503
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,080
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of expect and I say this</font>

504
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,610
it's a sad thing but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Gulf</font>

505
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,270
states have a long legacy of exploiting

506
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,570
workers from abroad that that's a

507
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,070
reality that's gotten a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coverage</font>

508
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,809
and so when Qatar got the Olympics I

509
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,210
think everyone was ready to to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

510
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,620
for what they were doing and there were

511
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,750
some lots of deaths and some extreme

512
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,880
cases I don't think Japan has had that

513
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,000
critical mass yet there hasn't been as

514
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,860
far as i know i mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> olympics are</font>

515
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,390
just starting construction right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in</font>

516
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,820
demolition so it's really the beginning

517
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot of people have</font>

518
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,480
really paid attention and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think japan</font>

519
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,520
also is the world's third-largest

520
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,580
economy and I guess the assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

521
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,610
that they're doing better and that

522
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,809
assumption is wrong as far as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

523
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:15,960
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well thank you no thank you it</font>

534
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:38,670
way is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who are making</font>

00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,920
the product are getting paid peanuts and
