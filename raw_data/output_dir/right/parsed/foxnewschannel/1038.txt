FDA approved for over 18 years.
ABBY: WE ARE BACK WITH A FOX
NEWS ALERT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVING IN
SINGAPORE JUST MOMENTS AGO AHEAD
OF HIS HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH KIM
JONG-UN.
PETE: THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR
ARRIVED OVERNIGHT AFTER HIS
LONGEST TRIP OVERSEAS.
HE WAS GREETED BY SINGAPORE'S
FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER.
BUT WHAT DO WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT
THE DICTATOR?
AND WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP UP
AGAINST?
HERE WITH INSIGHT, POLICY
ANALYST FOR THE HERITAGE
FOUNDATION'S ASIAN STUDIES
CENTER RILEY WALTERS.
GOOD MORNING, RILEY.
WHO IS KIM JONG-UN?
>> WELL, KIM JONG-UN IS THE
THIRD KIM OF THE KIM REGIME,
REPLACING HIS FATHER IN 2011,
KIM JONG-UN HAS SHOWN TO BE A
PRETTY BRUTAL DICTATOR OF SORTS.
HE RECENTLY JUST IN THE PAST
COUPLE YEARS ASSASSINATED HIS
BROTHER, AND HE'S KNOWN TO
REMOVE HIGH LEVEL ASSISTANTS IN
A VERY NONSUBTLE WAY IN ORDER TO
ESTABLISH HIS POWER, AS YOU
COULD SAY, IN NORTH KOREA.
HE'S CONTINUED TO TAKE NORTH
KOREA DOWN A PATH OF BELLIGERENT
GOALS, DEVELOPING NUCLEAR
CAPABILITIES, AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE NOW HOW
THINGS ARE DEVELOPING, THOUGH
THINGS ARE DEVELOPING, THOUGH.
PETE: RILEY, I'M GOING TO
ATTEMPT TO ASK A NUANCED
QUESTION HERE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL WORK OR
NOT.
BUT IS THIS A GUY WHO RELISHES
THE RUTHLESSNESS, WHO WANTS TO
LOCK PEOPLE UP AND KILL THEM, OR
A GUY WHO HAS INHERITED HIS
THRONE AND DONE WHAT IS
NECESSARY TO KEEP HIS POWER BUT
IS LOOKING FOR AN OFF RAMP?
>> HE MIGHT NOT BE AS RUTHLESS
AS WE THINK.
IT IS A NUANCED QUESTION SO IT
REQUIRES A NUANCED ANSWER.
HE TESTS TRUMP, THEY CONTINUE TO
TEST CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
WARFARE WEAPONS, BUT AT THE SAME
TIME HE MIGHT ALSO BE SHOWING
BRUTAL PUNISHMENT OF HIGH LEVEL
EFFICIENT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
HIS POWER, WHICH, IN A SENSE, IF
HE CAN ASSERT THAT HE HAS
CONTROL, HE MIGHT BE LESS
RUTHLESS IN THE END
RUTHLESS IN THE END.
ABBY: WHY DO YOU THINK HE'S
WILLING TO COME TO THE
NEGOTIATING TABLE NOW?
HAVE THINGS GOTTEN SO BAD FOR
NORTH KOREA THAT HE'S FEELING
LIKE AT THIS POINT HE JUST
DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE, THEY
CAN'T GO ON ANYMORE?
>> THANKS TO OUR MAXIMUM
PRESSURE I THINK, CERTAINLY.
YOU KNOW, THE NORTH KOREAN
ECONOMY IS -- IT'S HURTING RIGHT
NOW.
KIM JONG-UN HIMSELF I THINK
REALIZES THIS, AND I THINK HE
THINKS THAT IT IS POTENTIAL THAT
YOU KNOW, HE CAN MAKE A DEAL
WITH THE AMERICANS.
HE HAS THE NUKES, SO HE HAS THE
LEVERAGE TO MAKE A DEAL.
HE MIGHT BE WILLING TO GIVE
THOSE UP BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO APPLY THIS MAXIMUM
PRESSURE UNTIL WE CAN ACTUALLY
VERIFY THAT HE IS WILLING TO
COMMIT THIS TIME.
GRIFF: RILEY, WE JUST HAD
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI ON WHO SAID
KIM JONG-UN MAY BE A MUCH MORE
RATIONAL PERSON THAN PEOPLE GIVE
CREDIT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT
TRUMP WILL SEE IN THESE FIRST
MOMENTS WHEN HE MEETS KIM
JONG-UN?
>> WELL, I THINK HE'LL SEE A
DICTATOR WHO HAS, YOU KNOW, IS
OFTEN REVERED AS A GOD WITHIN
HIS OWN COUNTRY, AND A MAN WHO
OFTEN PEOPLE SAY -- NO ONE
ACTUALLY EVER SAYS "NO" TO.
SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING TO BE
COMING AGAINST SOMEONE WHO IN
HIMSELF IS VERY, IN HIS MIND,
ELEVATED.
AND SO AT FIRST IT COULD BE VERY
-- THEY COULD GET TOGETHER, YOU
KNOW, IF DENNIS RODMAN IS RIGHT
AND, YOU KNOW, KIM HIMSELF IS A,
YOU KNOW, FAIRLY NICE GUY, THEN
THEY COULD GET ALONG.
I THINK WHETHER THEY GET ALONG
OR NOT REALLY ACTUALLY DEPENDS
DONALD TRUMP ON THIS.
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF HE LIKES
HIM, IT WILL BE GOOD.
