Oh Mad Max no I'm not talking about the apocalyptic throw ride movies I'm talking about California congresswoman Maxine Waters but it's easy to confuse because the state of affairs and the movies could mirror her congressional districts CNN released a list of politicians to watch in 2018 and your girl Maxine Waters was near the top of the list with the article saying quote Donald Trump is the most dishonorable and despicable person to ever serve the office of the President to eat standing ovations so let's take a look at Mad Max and see if she has any ground to stand on this is close to my heart because Maxine Waters is the representative literally right down the road for me who has also served in Congress for as long as I've been alive so let's take a quick look at why she's been in office for so long maybe it's because her district has been doing so well since she took over her district currently ranks 41st out of 52 in high school graduation 48th and homeownership 39 in income and 43rd and per house income how could she be reelected so many times okay well maybe it's because she's a historical figure well-known in LA and she was ah see that must be the reason why Maxine is running the show here in Cali most well-known stories that come up when you search Maxine Waters in association with LA are the LA riots and Damien's football Williams she must've done a great job there right you remember the LA riots taking the lives of over 50 people and costing an estimated 1 billion dollars to repair the damages and Maxine must have been there to quell the madness right no she gave us support by saying we should not use the word riot to describe these people we should call it a rebellion and went on to say quote it was a defining moment in the country and I think a defining moment in the way black people resisted and quipped and if you think that is hard to stomach waits to hear about how Maxine handled the Reginald Denny attack those of you who don't know Reginald Denny was the truck driver who Danny and football Williams and four other men were rebelling against in the middle of the street where they ripped Reginald from his truck choked him beat him spat on him danced around him wave to the camera and as he laid there motionless Damien football Williams with the camera watching went to go get a piece of cinder block throwing it crashing it against his head and lynnium unconscious bloody in the street they then robbed him and walked off singing and dancing this is all caught on videotape by the way you can you to it the other four men basically got off scot-free from this entire incident caught on camera after causing over 90 fractures to the skull of Reginald Denny who now speaks with a permanent lisp and struggles to walk normally since Damien Williams actually did serve some time in jail Maxine Waters used that time to go visit the home of Williams to give her condolences a report showing that she embraced Damien football Williams family which makes sensing that when Damien football Williams was released early from his prison sentence Maxine Waters immediately gave him a job working for her where is Damien football Williams now well on February 1st 2004 Damien football Williams shot a man in the street is now serving a sentence what sounds awful but maybe it's because she's a strong woman who knows how to fight to the disenfranchised because she's one of them I mean this woman must fight against the odds right well then it would seem odd that she just bought a 4.4 million dollar mansion chest outside her congressional district and you might think this woman who's fighting as the underdog would have trouble getting donors to fund her campaigns I mean these people in our district probably couldn't have money to donate to her campaign could they well according to LA Times she raised over 1.1 million dollars for her re-election and her opponent just got over 10,000 in donations anyone think it's crazy for Mad Max to be able to afford a 4.4 million dollar mansion win the Congressional Congress salary is just over 130,000 it seems a bit sketchy but it's not the first time Little Mac seen Mad Max has been investigating for getting federal kickbacks in corruption during the Obama administration in 2010 Maxine was under investigation she was accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secured federal bailout funds hmm but don't worry these allegations were dropped during the investigation however they are now back under investigation so why does Mad Max have the support of all her constituents and voting bloc she could I guess she pledged she might be most virulent far-left anti-trump race activist I never read about saying quote ben Carson doesn't know an immigrant from a slave she also called for the government to socialize oil companies in the United States she also said quote I have to March because my mother could not have an abortion hmm that seems a since weird she also said quote it's time for the bully pulpit of Whitehouse to bring in the gangsta's she used a friend's funeral to give a eulogy condemning Donald Trump and calling for his impeachment and it's also not surprising that her district is the second most densely populated area in California for african-american voters it'd be one thing if in a huge area like this they're one of the most beautiful pieces of land in the United States with all the social program money being poured into this community being able to see at least a glimmer of hope brought in by the congressional people serving them because then their campaign slogan would be look how far we've come sadly it seems the community has kept in a cycle of victimhood fed by the encourage lack of responsibility and economic growth with the cause being told to them it is someone else's fault and honestly where is the money going and why are the representatives getting richer and richer overseeing this desolate poor community and because of this and so unfortunate for these people their representatives will most likely run on another slogan of quote look how far we still need to come I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood I hope you liked this video and others like it you should consider being a Premium Member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup they're pretty good too you
