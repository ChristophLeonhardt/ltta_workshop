this is Vladimir Putin's stairway to
presidency so to speak
he will climb these 58 steps before he
gets to the halls of the palace also the
size of the inauguration ceremony
this is the Hall of Military Glory
it's named after Singh George and it is
the first wolf Latimer Putin is set to
cross on his path to inauguration it is
also the biggest hole in the palace with
its length being more than 60 meters the
next Hall the hall of the order of st.
Alexander being in it right now it is
difficult to imagine that for the larger
part of the 20th century none of this
even existed after it had been
demolished by Soviet leaders only 20
years ago this was brought back to its
former glory
it's not all that glitters is gold they
say well it couldn't be more wrong for
this place I mean look at this gilded
pillars chandeliers and even the ceiling
this is the hole where the inauguration
ceremony will be taking place Vladimir
Putin will be standing in the far end of
the hall once again in his life saying
and own 33 words that will officially
start his next tenure as the President
of Russia McDonough from the Kremlin
