1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
well see you mentioned Wells Fargo which

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,879
is actually timely on this executive

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">compensation problem because in the</font>

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,390
midst of this scandal you had this

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,099
scheme where basically people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,170
compensated based on how many accounts

7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,370
they opened among other things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,509
created this huge incentive for

9
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:14,429
employees to open accounts whether they

10
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,660
were real or fake and they would open

11
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,920
basically a bunch of phantom accounts

12
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,560
and usually the justification was that

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,820
it was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know no difference the</font>

14
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,109
customers at all but occasionally they

15
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,550
did get charged fees or certain things

16
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,630
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for accounts they didn't want</font>

17
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,349
but you had in fact very good account

18
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:29,970
growth and customer growth putting all

19
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,080
this sales pressure on people it was

20
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,430
like plan a and the branches was do

21
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,200
raise a real sales right and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

22
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,280
the fake sales and they couldn't make

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,719
the real sales rather so you still got a

24
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,010
lot of these real sales right the

25
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,660
company did very well in retail banking

26
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,700
and then it balloon into this enormous

27
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,690
scandal when they figured out they done

28
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,239
all of this yeah so with a few senior

29
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,860
executives a couple but that got forced

30
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,239
out there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently this big claw</font>

31
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,190
back of a lot of their pay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

32
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,960
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> my question for you is is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this an</font>

33
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,879
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of executive compensation gone</font>

34
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,230
wrong where you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who got paid</font>

35
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot for a long time for profits and</font>

36
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,280
and positive indicators that were based

37
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">on bad behavior or is it an example of</font>

38
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,699
it working because hey you got these

39
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:03,809
claw backs and it showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

40
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,010
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> look so it's definitely not an</font>

41
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,390
example I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of it working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right i</font>

42
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,700
mean clawbacks are nice but they're not

43
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">really solving the problem in a deep way</font>

44
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it's a manifestation of the</font>

45
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,250
problem which is incentives gone crazy

46
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,320
you know in part economics is wonderful

47
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,790
not because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavioral stuff but</font>

48
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,680
because we focus on incentives and those

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,710
are incentives that have just gone awry

50
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,450
then it layers into culture and it gets

51
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">even more complicated but the</font>

52
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-order lesson from Wells Fargo is a</font>

53
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,030
culture of driven by really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font>

54
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,650
we call high-powered incentives you get

55
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,299
an extra dollar you get a big chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

56
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,369
that and that leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all kinds of</font>

57
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior especially when it's at a very</font>

58
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,909
high frequency very short horizons if

59
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,220
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that over longer horizons like</font>

60
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,600
you know what say you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten year or</font>

61
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,970
20 year period then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because</font>

62
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,680
all these manipulations are harder to

63
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,450
sustain for that long but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I guess the</font>

64
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">question going back to Prince</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elasian</font>

65
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
problem is why did you have these

66
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,829
incentives in the first place you had

67
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,049
them because you know for a branch

68
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,820
manager or branch employee the incentive

69
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">is obviously to sit there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and not try</font>

70
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,090
too hard to sell unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're so this</font>

71
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,210
the the pay structure was intending to

72
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,740
align the incentives of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principal in</font>

73
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the agent and it went awry absolutely</font>

74
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,560
and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you know the</font>

75
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,149
principal-agent problem is just

76
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever-present right I mean we can solve</font>

77
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,900
it and we can kind of ameliorate it but

78
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,350
it is the

79
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,790
problem right it's not we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

80
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,930
to go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time when you work for</font>

81
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself and I work for myself unless</font>

82
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,620
the gig economy you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know goes crazy and</font>

83
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,180
everybody's working for themselves by

84
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> large we're always going to have</font>

85
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,430
that separation of ownership and

86
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,290
management and all we're trying to do is

87
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,790
on the margins solve it a little bit

88
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,560
right and it's but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a problem</font>

89
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,240
goes away it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes</font>

90
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,250
away in fact you know every relationship

91
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,540
you have with a doctor or with a

92
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,520
contractor it is fundamentally the

93
00:02:35,520 --> 00:00:00,000
principal-agent problem
