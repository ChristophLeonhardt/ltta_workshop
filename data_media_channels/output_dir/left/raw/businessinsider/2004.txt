that with the president's new commitment

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,090
we will preserve the financial reform

stopping people making bad mortgages of

derivatives being sold without any

13
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,210

will be for maintaining and supporting

it and the Republicans will be for

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,909
undoing it and inviting a repeat of the

00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,789
wins and gives us more homophobic bigots

25
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,549
like Anthony Scalia and reflexive

right-wingers like Clarence Thomas and

Samuel burrito the role of the courts as
