talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> christmas eve tradition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,200
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of families do their gifts on</font>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,300
Christmas Eve or they open their

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,920
stockings but we never did any of that

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,619
in my family our usual tradition was to

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,539
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> church late at night and now I'm</font>

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,730
not a particularly religious person I

10
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,560
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> always looked forward to</font>

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,660
Christmas Eve service after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sermon</font>

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,220
they would turn off all the lights in

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the house and everybody would have a</font>

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
candle and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd all light them passing</font>

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,570
flame from person to person and after

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,460
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the candles were lit good seeing</font>

three carols in a row the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,840

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,700
and then of course we'd come home and

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,379
leave out cookies and I'd be too excited

23
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,719
to sleep so I would read Christmas books

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,070

25
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,079
anymore now though<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've grown up</font>
