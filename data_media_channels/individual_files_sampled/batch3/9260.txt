I THINK I'M BEHIND IN THE POLLS BECAUSE SENATOR McCONNELL HAS GOT A SUPER PAC THAT IS RUNNING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ADS AGAINST ME. WE WERE EVEN BEFORE THAT. AND BEFORE ELECTION DAY WE WILL BE IN IT. Martha: A LOT OF MONEY POURING INTO THE RACE. HE'S 1 OF 3 CANDIDATES WHO MADE THE CUT FOR TOMORROW'S BIG FOX NEWS WEST VIRGINIA PRIMARY DEBATE HOSTED BY YOURS TRULY AND BRET BAIER FLY FROM MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA, AT 6:30 P.M. TOMORROW NIGHT. THEY CANDIDATES DECIDED BY FOX POLLING WILL BE PART OF THAT AND YOU'LL SEE THE THREE OF THEM. DON BLANKENSHIP WILL BE JOINED BY WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL PATRICK MORRISSEY AND WEST VIRGINIA CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS. WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH CONGRESSMAN EVAN JENKINS. SIR, WELCOME. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TIME FOR A LOT OF QUESTIONS IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE WITH YOU, MARTHA. Martha: I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK ONES YOU THIS EVENING THAT WILL GIVE EVERYBODY A SORT OF PREVIEW. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS YOU AND MORRISSEY ARE REALLY GOING AT EACH OTHER REALLY HARD IN THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU SEEM TO BE IGNORING DON BLANKENSHIP A BIT. I GUESS IF YOU LIKE THE REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING CARE A LOT OF ADVOCATES. HERE'S ONE THAT YOU JUST RAN. LET'S PLAY ABOUT TEN SECONDS OF THIS. PAT MORRISSEY BETRAYED DONALD TRUMP. SCHEMING AGAIN TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND WEST IN WEST VIRGINIA. DENYING ART CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT. MORRISSEY REFUSED TO SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HILLARY. Martha: YOU KNOW THE PATRICK MORRISSEY IS FIGHTING BACK. HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. HE SAID YOUR CAMPAIGN PHOTOSHOP IS A PHOTO WITH DONALD TRUMP AND SUBSTITUTED IT WITH HILLARY, HE'S SAID HE'S ALWAYS STRONGLY OPPOSED AND WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'LL BE CALLED OUT FOR LYING, DISHONESTY, WHERE IS THE COUNTABILITY. WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THAT ADA? PATRICK MORRISSEY NEEDS TO BE HONEST WITH THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA. PATRICK MORRISSEY DIDN'T EVEN VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IN THE PRIMARY. HE WAS THE DELEGATE TO THE NATIONAL CONVENTION, WOULD NOT COMMIT FOR ABOUT 2.5 MONTHS. HE WAS A NEVER-TRUMPER. HE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE NEVER-TRUMPERS. PATRICK MORRISSEY HAS NEVER BEEN A TRUSTED SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE BEEN. WHEN THEY WERE THROWING HIM UNDER THE BUS BEFORE THE NOVEMBER ELECTION, PATRICK MORRISEY WAS DENYING AFFILIATION WITH DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP, OUR PRESIDENT NEEDS A TRUSTED PARTNER AND I AM THAT. Martha: WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM MR. MORRISSEY IN A MOMENT. WE'LL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO RESPOND. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION FOR YOU THEN BECOMES, YOU USED TO BE A DEMOCRAT. WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND? WHY DID YOU BECOME A REPUBLICAN A DEMOCRAT A COUPLE OF TIMES? YOU KNOW WHAT? WEST VIRGINIA HAS WEST VIRGINIA VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP OVERWHELMINGLY. PATRICK MORRISEY ACTUALLY STOOD NEXT TO ME FOUR YEARS AGO AND ENDORSED MY CANDIDACY FOR THE U.S. CONGRESS. MY PAST DOESN'T BOTHER HIM BACK THEN WHEN HE ENDORSED ME AND SAID I WAS GREAT FOR WEST VIRGINIA TO REPRESENT THEM IN WASHINGTON. WHAT IS CHANGE SINCE PATRICK MORRISEY NOW HAS BEEN ABANDONING HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL ME WHEN I'M JUST ASKING ABOUT YOU. I AM ASKING WHY YOUR CHANGE OF HEART, WHY DID YOU SWITCH FROM BEING A DEMOCRAT TO THE REPUBLICAN? BECAUSE I AM THE TRUE WEST VIRGINIA. I'M THE WEST VIRGINIA STORY, STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE. BARACK OBAMA WAS DEVASTATING FOR WEST VIRGINIA. HE PUT LITERALLY TENS AND THOUSANDS OF COAL MINERS OUT OF WORK, TRIED TO INFRINGE ON OUR SECOND MOMENT, ABORTION ON DEMAND, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I CAN'T BE A PART OF THAT. I'M PROUD TO BE A REPUBLICAN, PROUD TO BE A CONSERVATIVE, PROUD TO BE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS RACE WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP AND IS WORKING WITH HIM EACH AND EVERY DAY.
