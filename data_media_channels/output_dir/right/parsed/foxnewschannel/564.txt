>> Shannon: TONIGHT, IRAN
BOWING REVENGE AFTER AN ATTACK
THIS WEEKEND AT A MILITARY
PARADE LEFT AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE
DEAD AND 60 MORE ROUNDED.
IRAN SAYS THE U.S. AND ISRAEL
ARE AMONG OTHERS, THEY ARE ALL
TO BLAME.
ALSO BREWING, CIA DIRECTOR GINA
HASPEL THROWS A SHEET ON
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM
DRAGO’S REAL INTENTIONS.
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR DANIEL
HOFFMAN IS HERE TO BREAK IT
DOWN.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO START.
WE HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON.
THE U.S. IS DISAVOWING
CONNECTION WITH THIS MASS
SHOOTING IN IRAN AT THE MILITARY
SHOOTING IN IRAN AT THE MILITARY
PARADE.
HERE IS WHAT FORMER AMBASSADOR
ANTONELLA SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN
BOLTON HAD TO SAY.
>> AS I HAVE SAID REPEATEDLY,
REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN IS NOT THE
REGIME CHANGE IN IRAN IS NOT THE
ADMINISTRATIONS POLICY.
AS MIKE POMPEO JUST SAID, WE
HAVE IMPOSED VERY STRINGENT
SANCTIONS ON IRAN.
MORE ARE COMING.
WHAT WE EXPECT FROM IRAN’S
MASSIVE CHANGES IN THEIR
BEHAVIOR.
UNTIL THAT HAPPENS, WE WILL
CONTINUE TO EXERT WITH THE
PRESIDENT HAS CALLED TO MAXIMUM
PRESSURE.
THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND TO DO.
>> Shannon: HOW DOES THIS
ADMINISTRATION SPEAK TO THE
IRANIAN PEOPLE AND GO PAST THE
REGIME?
IS IT POSSIBLE?
>> THE IRANIAN REGIME IS TRYING
TO REFLECT FLAME FOR EVERYTHING
THAT IS WRONG AND IRAN.
RIGHT NOW THEIR ECONOMY IS IN
FREE FALL, WE ARE SEEING
HYPERINFLATION, AND THEY WANT TO
HYPERINFLATION, AND THEY WANT TO
BLAME OTHERS AND THEY START WITH
BLAME OTHERS AND THEY START WITH
THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS
THEIR SUNNI ENEMIES IN THE
REGION, LIKE THE UNITED ARAB
EMIRATES AND SAUDI ARABIA.
THIS ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON THE
THIS ATTACK THAT OCCURRED ON THE
BORDER OF IRAQ IN AN AREA THAT
IS EXPERIENCED OTHER PROTESTS
FOR WATER SHORTAGES, HAS BEEN
VICTIMIZED BY SMUGGLING, IT WAS
PROBABLY AN INSIDE JOB AS WELL.
THESE GUYS WERE WEARING
SOLDIERS’ UNIFORMS.
THE IRANIANS WANT TO DEFLECT
THEIR BLAME FOR THE ON PROBLEM
AND BLAME OTHERS.
A COMMON TACTIC.
>> Shannon: AMBASSADOR BOLTON
SAID THAT U.S. FORCES WILL NOT
BE LEAVING SYRIA ANYTIME SOON AS
BE LEAVING SYRIA ANYTIME SOON AS
LONG AS THEY FEEL LIKE IRAN HAS
SAID -- NOT JUST IRAN BUT
PROXIES, MILITIAS, HE SAYS THEY
WILL STAY UNTIL THEY ARE
COMPLETELY OUT OF SYRIA.
>> THE PROBLEM IS, IRAN DOESN’T
DO POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION
VERY WELL.
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TARGETING
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS TARGETING
SUNNIS, INNOCENT SUNNI.
THAT IS NO WAY TO BRING ABOUT
THE RECONCILIATION THAT REALLY
IS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE
TERRORIST THREAT.
WITH IRAN AND BOB CLEMENT
CARRIES ON BEING A PETRI DISH
GROWING THESE THREATS OF
EXTREMISTS.
WE NEED TO BE THERE IN SOME
FORM, NOT A LOT OF TROOPS OR AN
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY BUT
ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.
ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR INTERESTS.
>> Shannon: RUSH ALSO A PLAYER
THERE, OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS NO
DISPUTE OVER WHETHER OR NOT
RUSSIA MAY BE SELLING FAKE
MISSILE-DEFENSE WEAPONRY TO
SYRIA.
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING SANCTIONS,
POTENTIALLY VIOLATING SANCTIONS,
U.S. SANCTIONS, AND GUIDELINES.
>> THE RUSSIANS ARE INTERESTED
IN THE MIDDLE EAST FOR A FEW
REASONS.
THEY WOULD LIKE TO ELIMINATE OR
REDUCE U.S. INTEREST IN THE
REGION BUT THEY ARE ALSO
INTERESTED IN OIL SALES AMOUNT
IS POTENTIALLY A CONFLICT AREA
WITH IRAN BECAUSE IRAN’S OIL
SALES HAVE DECREASED AND A ROW
ARE INCREASING.
WEAPON SALES, GOING BACK TO THE
DAYS OF THE SOVIET UNION, IT’S
ABOUT SELLING WEAPONS.
THEY ARE USING THIS MOST RECENT
ATTACK ON THEIR OWN AIRCRAFT AS
ANOTHER PRETEXT FOR WANTING TO
DO THAT.
>> Shannon: A QUICK COMMENT
AND NORTH KOREA AS WELL AS THE
PRESIDENT IS AT THE
UNITED NATIONS, MEETING WITH
LEADERS OF JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA,
OTHER KEY PLAYERS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
CRITICIZED FOR NOT BEING
MULTILATERAL.
LET’S LOOK AT I WAS AT THOSE
PARTNERS, RUSSIA AND CHINA.
CHINA HAS ABOUT 90% OF KOREA’S
TRADE, NEVER USED -- LEVERAGE TO
TRADE, NEVER USED -- LEVERAGE TO
FORCE KIM JONG UN TO
DENUCLEARIZE.
RUSSIA AND CHINA WANT TO REDUCE,
RUSSIA AND CHINA WANT TO REDUCE,
IF NOT ELIMINATE THE U.S.
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION.
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE REGION.
WE DON’T SHARE THE SAME WALLS.
