President Trump wants Special
Counsel Robert Mueller fired.
“The entire thing has
been a witch hunt.
These people have the
biggest conflicts of interest
I’ve ever seen.
I wanted to stay out.
But at some point, if it
doesn’t straighten out
properly, I will get involved.
And I’ll get in
there if I have to.”
But the man who’s
overseeing Mueller’s probe
says that’s not likely.
“If there were not good cause,
it wouldn’t matter to me
what anybody says.”
The Times has reported that
Rosenstein discussed ways
to remove Trump from office.
Now they’re in a
face-off — the president,
who demands loyalty, and
Rosenstein, the subordinate,
whose job requires
independence.
“Are you afraid of
President Trump firing you?”
“No, I am not, Congressman.”
So how does
Rosenstein defend one
of his boss's biggest targets?
“If President
Trump ordered you
to fire the special
counsel, what would you do?”
“Senator, I’m not going
to follow any orders
unless I believe those
are lawful and appropriate
orders.
Under the regulation,
Special Counsel Mueller
may be fired only
for good cause.
And I am required to put
that cause in writing.”
“And Director Mueller
is going to have
a full degree of
independence that he
needs to conduct that
investigation appropriately.”
“Yeah, there have
been people who
have been making threats,
privately and publicly,
against me.
And I think they
should understand
by now the
Department of Justice
is not going to be extorted.
We’re going to do what’s
required by the rule of law.
And any kind of threats
that anybody makes
are not going to affect
the way we do our job.
We have a responsibility.
And we take an oath.
That’s the whole point.”
“If it were appropriate
for me to recuse,
I’d be more than
happy to do so and let
somebody else handle this.
But it’s my
responsibility to do it.”
But when it comes down
to it, the president
could have the last
word, firing Rosenstein
and appointing someone else,
who will then fire Mueller.
“And many people have
said you should fire him.
Again, they’ve found nothing.”
