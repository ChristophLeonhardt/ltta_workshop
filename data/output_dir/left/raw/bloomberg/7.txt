1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,500
Scottish city Glasgow once held a grim
title: "the murder capital of Europe"

2
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:12,129
but levels of violence in the city have
fallen by 60% in just over a decade

3
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:18,640
all thanks to a radical approach:
treating violence as a disease.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,220
Here's how Scotland is curing violent crime.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,339
Growing levels of alcohol abuse,
unemployment and inequality between the

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:35,260
1980s and early 2000s had contributed to
a social crisis in Scotland.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,140
By 2005 the crime rate had reached its highest
levels in a decade and the

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,890
United Nations released a report which named
Scotland as the most violent place in

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,060
the developed world

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,560
But it was in Scotland's largest city Glasgow where the problem was most severe.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,200
Nightly I can anticipate around a dozen calls for gang

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,800
fighting on the street or group disorder
outside somebody's home.

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,240
This high concentration of gang violence had pushed Glasgow's murder rate almost three times

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,060
higher than the rest of the country

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,980
But in 2005, in response to the growing

16
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,260
crisis Glasgow's regional police force
set up the Violence Reduction Unit or VRU.

17
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,470
It became the only police force in
the world to take a public health

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,200
approach to violence

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,540
That meant treating
violence as a preventable disease rather

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,480
than just as a criminal matter.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,140
The VRU's new strategy was inspired by the

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,530
work of Gary Slutkin, an American
physician who'd spent a decade fighting

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,520
cholera and AIDS epidemics across Africa
during the '80s and '90s

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,380
When he came back to Chicago

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,840
Slutkin was confronted with
another epidemic: gun violence.

26
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,840
I can get a gun anytime I want.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,120
After mapping crime data he
noticed that violence followed the same

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,220
patterns as contagious diseases.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,160
One act led directly to another and these were

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,020
often found clustered together.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,480
He also found that violence could be transmitted between people.

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,170
If a person was exposed
to violence it increased the likelihood

33
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,800
that they would commit violence.

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
In 2000, Slutkin created a pilot project on the

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,650
west side of Chicago which controlled
outbreaks of violence in a similar way

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,260
to health epidemics and focuses on three
key areas.

37
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,760
First to find the cause of an outbreak
and interrupt its transmission to other people.

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,019
This work is carried out by
violence interrupters, people with an

39
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,620
established relationship with the
community who can help identify symptoms

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,240
and eliminate the root causes of
violence.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,909
Second is to identify people

42
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,520
who might be at risk of developing
violent behavior and try to prevent it from happening.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,500
This is done by offering
alternatives to gang membership through

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,880
employment, housing and health support.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
Finally an important step is to change

46
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,079
attitudes towards violence, making
communities understand that it's

47
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,400
something preventable not inevitable.

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
This approach has been adapted by the

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,320
Violence Reduction Unit in Scotland.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,950
But as well as helping people break free

51
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,909
from violence, the VRU has also advocated
for stronger penalties for those who

52
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,840
continue on a path of crime.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,139
Through lobbying the penalty for carrying a

54
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,800
knife in Scotland has tripled in ten
years.

55
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,079
By 2006 Scotland had extended the

56
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,609
work of the VRU nationwide and during
the following decade violent crime fell

57
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,080
by 49 percent, including murders which
were reduced by 47 percent.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,280
These dramatic reductions have helped to ease
the burden on the Scottish healthcare system

59
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,400
with hospital emergency assault
admissions down by 56 percent since 2007.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,640
And the benefits of a reduced crime rate
are economic too.

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,060
Each homicide case in

62
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,780
the UK is estimated to cost the taxpayer
2.3 million dollars which is more than

63
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,520
the cost of running the VRU for an
entire year.

64
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,480
While Scotland is aiming to

65
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,800
achieve the lowest levels of crime in
the world by 2025, at the other end of

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,260
the country London has seen a recent
surge in knife crime.

67
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,780
In the year to May 2018

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,799
there were 97 fatal stabbings and
so the UK capital has announced it will

69
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,609
be one of many cities around the world
looking to follow Scotland's example in

70
00:04:04,609 --> 00:00:00,000
the hope of breaking the cycle of
violence.
