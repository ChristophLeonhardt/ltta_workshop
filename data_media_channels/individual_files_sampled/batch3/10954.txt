the controversial congressional memo that's been stealing the headlines in recent weeks has now been released after receiving approval from the US president it accuses the FBI and Justice Department of securing a warrant to spy on Donald Trump's presidential campaign based on the unverified claims in the Trump Russia steel dossier which was paid for by the Democrats I think it's terrible you want another truth I think it's a disgrace what's going on in this country I think it's a disgrace the memo was sent to Congress it was Declassified Congress will do whatever they're going to do but I think it's a disgrace what's happening in our country and when you look at that and you see that and some of the other things what's going on a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves and much worse than that well if you take a look at the four page memo that there was so much anticipation of you'll be coming across some rather interesting facts now the Christopher Steele dossier this was the basis on which the FBI acquired their warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act their warrant to wiretap members of the Trump campaign it was based on the infamous dossier from Christopher Steele now we also know that the FBI chief said that was salacious and unverified furthermore the FBI was aware that the DMC and the Hillary Clinton Foundation paid roughly a hundred and sixty thousand dollars for the steel dossier they knew it was paid for by the DNC but they did not mention that in their applications for a warrant from FISA courts furthermore Christopher steel wasn't only working for the Democrats Christopher Steele was a long time paid FBI informant and the Department of Justice in the FBI were well aware of the fact that Christopher steel had an agenda against Trump was quite biased they still used the report furthermore we know that the Deputy Attorney General Bruce or his wife was actually hired by fusion GPS the firm that the Democrats hired in order to get this information on Trump so essentially this document points to the fact that there was a great deal of what appears to be collusion between the Clinton camp pain and and the FBI and Department of Justice two entities that are essentially supposed to be bipartisan enforcers of US law it appears according to this document or at least it's purported in this document that they were working to prevent the election of Donald Trump and we heard many calls from many prominent figures for this document to remain classified they wanted this four pages to be not in the perspective and not available to the American public remember Nancy Pelosi the leader of the Democrats in the US House of Representatives said that releasing this document which is now fully public would somehow be a threat to the national security of the United States intelligence community is best it's the CIA the DNA DNI the National Defense everybody has their element of it and sources and methods must be protected now as the debate about the releasing of the memo escalated Russia most certainly came into the picture there was a letter that was sent to the owners of Twitter and Facebook urging them to investigate the role of Russian BOTS or possible Russian BOTS in the hashtag released the memo furthermore we even saw an escalation of this rhetoric with allegations that Devin Nunez the chair of the House Intelligence Committee was himself a Russian agent let's take a listen to some of what was said is it possible that the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence is it possible if they actually have a Russian agent running the house Intel Committee on the Republican side i I hope that's not the case does this behavior speak of that though I mean I'm not the first person who's raised this he's behaving like someone who's been compromised now we're waiting for different reactions to come in but all eyes are on Washington DC as the four pages have been released and the memo is now public well let's get some of that reaction know from Daniel McAdams executive director at the Ron Paul Institute's Daniel good to have you on the program yet so there we go were a few hours into the memo being released what's your takeaway points from it well I think your your report covered it very well this provides very clear evidence that the Democratic Party colluded with with like-minded people in the FBI to undermine the Trump candidacy and presidency they misused the FISA process to do so it's essentially what we expected we've gotten some information about it the real issue though the only people who should be shocked about this are people who are living in la-la land thinking that the federal government is full of Boy Scouts this is what the FISA Court does this is what the FBI has done dozens and dozens of times this was always the query wasn't it after will this actually be released the question was did the FBI did the Justice Department where they biased against the Trump campaign has that question being answered now do you think well I think it has been I think the you know the the DNC got this got Steele to do a bogus dossier they used it they misled the FISA Court which the FBI has done according to the FISA Court more than 75 times since 1978 when the court was put in Kate in place it was supposed to make it harder to spy on people the FISA Court has made it easier now we're seeing it only when the when the elites only when Trump is a victim we're talking about the FISA courts but yes indeed that is that does look like what happened it also completely undermines people like Adams shift representative from California who is one of the chief movers behind the whole Russia gate idea he was desperate for this information not to get out he said the world would end if it gets out and now that it's out he says well it's just a nothing burger so it really undermines the narrative of the Russia Gate people I'm just looking at some of the reaction to what you could say I suppose is the other side some of the Democrats saying the FBI was investigating both the Trump and Clinton campaigns in 2016 but kept quiet only about the Trump investigation does that therefore undermine claims that there was a conspiracy against Trump that's what they are pointing out your thoughts on that no I think it has to do with the zeal with which the investigations were take what we're carried out we know that they sat on information from on on Hillary Clinton's issue for for those three critical weeks we know we know many much more about it but it has to do with the zero we know that these FBI agents were compromised by their own political biases and not just passively everyone has a political view they were actively motivated to do things to make things happen to undermine the will of the American voter the consequences of the memos released what do you think they're gonna be not well there will be a lot of politicization of course of the issue the sad thing that will not happen is revisiting the issue of FISA now here I think here's one of the real crimes and this has to do with Devin eNOS and the Republicans as well they all knew about FISA abuses they knew in detail about FISA abuses before they reauthorized section 702 just a few weeks ago they knew all this stuff but they chose to keep it secret from us the American people so they could continue spying on the rest of us unfortunately that's not we will not see this issue resolved it'll be devolved into a political fight yeah I'm just looking at some some of the other reaction to this and some notable Democrats saying that that if Donald Trump uses the memo to fire DOJ and FBI officials that lots is going to be an obstruction to justice how do you assess that claim well I think right now there are desperate and in damage control they're trying to spin this to their advantage certainly I think the president is justified with what we've seen in this four-page memo of saying this was a essentially a covert operation the intelligence community colluded with people who wanted to prevent me from becoming president and if this is the kind of Banana Republic that the u.s. is going to have not that this is unprecedented but it is out in the open just like when Snowden revelations came we knew they were spying on us but Snowden's revelations put it in front of us and so now that we know that the intelligence community is actively involved in elections yeah what kind of a country are we going to be that's the question we should be asking do you think like big heads are gonna roll here do you foresee the FBI director able to survive this is he going to be sacked resign or stay in his position do you think I think there will have to be some people sacrificed in this that the worst thing that will happen is that they'll form another commission and talk about reform because what that means is they'll be sweeping this under the rub under the rug there's a chance for some real reform of the FISA process of the the idea of who we are as a society being surveilled by our government whether you're the president or just some average guy I hope these issues are the ones that are that are looked at and visited now that this info is out and just on the one of the big aspects of this entire case what do you think will be the impact on the investigations now into allegations of collusion between between Trump and Russia what happens in that regard well anyone who's sane and I guess that maybe few of us these days will see that the whole thing has been blown out of the water this whole insane fantasy of Russian BOTS people like Senator McCain now are so desperate and he was involved in this dossier don't forget he's saying that anyone now who's criticizing the FBI is doing Putin's bidding this is what he tweeted earlier today I think these people are desperate but anyone again who is not insane who can look at this rationally whether you're not a Donald Trump supporter which I am certainly not a supporter well look at this and say this blows it out of the water this fiction now should be put back on the Shelf because it's we've seen the movie and we don't like it from the clear coherent unsane Daniel McAdams executive director at the Ron Paul Institute Daniel thanks as always
