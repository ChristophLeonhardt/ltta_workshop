welcome home finally time to relax after another stressful day at the office unfortunately it's not over stress can have an intense and sometimes dangerous effect on your body it all starts in a part of your brain called the amygdala when your boss yells at you or you start freaking out about a deadline it sends a warning message to your hypothalamus which starts mobilizing the nervous system your heart rate jumps your intestines go a little haywire and glands start pumping out that dreaded stress hormone cortisol a stressful day here and there isn't a huge deal but if you're one of those people who spends most of their life as a stress ball all this biology can spell trouble in the heart blood vessels constrict which makes pumping blood a difficult job that sends your blood pressure up much higher than it should be things aren't so great in your digestive system either those butterflies in your stomach that's actually your body limiting gastrointestinal activity that means less food broken down bloating and a lack of nutrient absorption all while hormonal changes are happening that can raise your cholesterol levels over time stress can also make you gain weight that cortisol flooding through you ramps up your appetite and makes you want to eat a lot and that nasty cortisol isn't done it can also cause changes in the brain that may hurt your sleep cycle and your memory and on top of all that chronic stress puts people at higher risk for depression anxiety and heart disease so next time you're stressed take a deep breath and consider a few other ways to deal with it exercise eat healthy food get the rest you need and above all else stay positive man
