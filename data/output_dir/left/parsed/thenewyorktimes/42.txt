My name is Sam Levinson, and
I am the writer and director
of “Assassination Nation."
So this is a scene later in
the film in which the four
girls are accused of being
behind the massive data
hack that resulted in all
of the residents of Salem’s
private information
being leaked.
They’re getting
death threats online.
They’re posting their address.
And Em, who’s
played by Abra here,
is worried that her mother
forgot to set the alarm.
Initially, it was
written as a house fire,
actually, in the script.
And because we’re
a low budget film,
we — we couldn’t
afford a house fire.
So Marcell Rev, the
cinematographer and myself
sat in a room with a kind
of a 3D model of this house
that we had found that was
in Louisiana that kind of was
on a corner, so we could
basically — it had,
you know, three sides that
we — we could all see.
The goal was to create a
scene that felt as cinematic
as — as a house
fire but with —
but something that
we can shoot in —
in 10 hours.
So we sat there
with, basically,
this 3D model that Michael
Grasley, our production
designer, had built,
and tried to figure out,
what’s the scariest
way possible
that we could
sort of, you know,
choreograph this home
invasion sequence?
And we came up with
this idea of shooting it
from the outside.
And actually, on — on this
take here when the stunt
guy grabs Abra and pulls
her towards the window,
he actually slams his
hand into the glass,
and the glass
actually shattered
for real, which was a moment
where your kind of heart
drops as a filmmaker, and
you hope everyone’s O.K.
But that ended up having
to be our last take
for that section right
there, because we
couldn’t replace the window.
So we had kind of
designed this dolly track
that a techno crane
with a 42-foot arm
could sit on so it
can actually go around
all three sides of the
house without a single cut.
And so from that
point on, it was just
a matter of — of getting the
choreography and the timing
right.
So, you know, I would sit
with Marcell behind the crane
and — and sort of walk
with him with a radio
that I could communicate with
all the actors inside to make
sure that they — 
they hit their marks
or to make sure that
they were — you know,
the camera was
keeping up with them,
or they were keeping
up with the camera,
so it felt like this was
something that was in motion
and was continuing to sort
of, you know, build suspense.
There was also something
that felt, you know,
very apropos about watching
this horror unfold and —
and being helpless to
it, which is, I think,
something that we often feel
and trolling through Twitter
or — or Instagram
and — and looking
at these sort of
tragedies unfold,
where we’ve become sort
of spectators to it.
