with political fissures Deeping deepening in the EU over how to deal with the influx of migrants some of the blocks leaders have gathered for an emergency meeting to discuss solutions let's get the latest now from our correspondent in Europe Donald quarter Don how Bernie does manage to find any kind of solution yet well Angela Merkel was originally looking for a european-wide solution but she's since gotten back on that now she's talking about bilateral and trilateral agreements between EU member states we know that at the European Council unfortunately we will not yet get a comprehensive solution to the migration problem and that is why by or trilateral agreements are mutually beneficial how can we help one another without having to wait for all 28 countries but before any such agreements are agreed upon there's still one problem and that's the fact that Europe the European Union is already very divided on the migration issue and any such agreements between EU member states would inevitably contradict one another take the visa grad countries for example you have the Czech Republic Hungary Slovakia and Poland they outright refused to come to today's summit they said it was just a power move on the on the part of Angela Merkel to control her her domestic politics and other countries have just begun rejecting migrants altogether last week Italy rejected a boatload of migrants and it was forced to dock in Spain and just two days ago the same thing happened in Malta actually but these kind of actions they're not going unnoticed from people like French president Emmanuel macron just people mapa for my part I'm in favor of having mechanisms that take this into account we cannot have countries that massively benefit from EU solidarity and who massively claimed their national selfishness when it comes to the topic of migration and it's not just the EU cohesion that said risk here just recently there was a political standoff between Merkel and her interior minister horsey Hoffer now see how her threatened to turn away migrants at the German border even even though they were registered in other EU countries and this put their decades-old government coalition in Germany at risk they only agreed to cease hostilities till the end of the month hoping something would come out of the summit's like the one that happened today now at the conclusion of today's summit Merkel said that the EU should be looking at the agreement they made with Turkey as a framework for agreements with other migrant origin countries but let's not forget how much that cost the European Union those three billion euros so with the division spread across Europe and it's it's really hard to see how more spending and and as well as agreements between EU member countries now that's not just going to drive a wedge deeper into the heart of the EU well of course if akin to is live from Berlin then Don thanks for the details you
