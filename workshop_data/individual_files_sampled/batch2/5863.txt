we are beginning tonight with these massive protests over Brett Kavanaugh you're looking at the scene that unspooled over much of the afternoon in Washington that's directly inside the Senate heart building and that is a type of civil disobedience fury unleashed their officers removing many of the protesters you're seeing on screen forcibly and the report of course in the FBI has come out today for senators eyes only it looks into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh allegations he has publicly denied that tonight we are hours from the scheduled vote for tomorrow morning and let me be clear right now anyone telling you they know what happens next what's gonna happen tonight or tomorrow morning is over confident because the only thing that we know from what's been publicly stated by senators is a whip count of 48 to 48 those are public commitments which technically could change but tell you the state of play a tie for key senators remain publicly undecided no the protests also put pressure on Republicans gathering they're strategically you're looking at shots inside senator Susan Collins office she hasn't announced her public position activists confronting Democratic Senator Joe Manchin also undecided you see the direct pressure there on mansion who is a Democrat in a red state meanwhile Senator Jeff Flake with the Republican of course who is one of the key swing votes is according to the Atlantic tonight still having issues and he's reached out to a friend you may have seen them together on TV this week Senator Chris Coons to discuss all this now we haven't confirmed that report at NBC meantime red state democratic senator heidi heitkamp announced and this is new as of today she is a no vote on Cavanaugh that's a change the five day FBI investigation itself has come under a lot of scrutiny now the reports not yet public and we don't have a copy of it it might never make its way out Democrats asking why only nine witnesses were questioned now coming up we're gonna speak directly to Cavanaugh's Yale classmate who says he wanted to speak to the FBI about all this but he didn't get an interview and I also have on the show tonight and this should be interesting a conservative retired judge who had supported Cavanaugh and has now like others retracted his support that's later in the show the politics also boiling over leading Republicans who you may remember spent a lot of time trying to delicately handle the optics even hiring a temporary partisan staffer to do the questioning of dr. Ford while you're looking at how that's all changed today this was the scene they chose they could have brought anyone out for this press conference but instead it was all male that's a change from a week ago when they as I mentioned they hired a female lawyer to do questioning and they unleashed their emotions and everything but whether he's qualified to serve has been brought up at the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here the shameful intimidation tactics that have been employed as part of an orchestrated smear campaign I personally resent the calumny that's been heaped upon in it's just isn't right it isn't fair they just about destroyed a good person I'm joined by Senator Jeff Merkley he's called the Cavanaugh investigation a type of cover-up and is trying to make a legal intervention to stop the confirmation vote itself I begin with your rebuttal to what we just heard your response to the chairman of this committee Grassley saying that we are on the precipice of destroying Brett Kavanaugh think about the contrast from 1991 when Anita Hill came forward there was a thorough background investigation reopened there were three days of testimony there were multiple multiple witnesses in this case not a single individual that Debbie Ramirez said talk to these people she gave a list of 20 people not one was talked to dr. Ford said here are eight people who have corroborating information not one was talked to the FBI is not at fault here they can only talk to people as instructed by the White House in this situation it's not a criminal investigation they are serving at the call of the president the president gave a scoping document as its referred to that basically rigged the situation so that not one of those 28 individuals with corroborating information had a chance to tell their story and provide that information to the US Senate I wonder what you think is the reason for the shift as I mentioned in our in our lead report tonight from last Thursday exactly a week ago where there was a concentrated effort to have a restrained or even respectful and rational approach to dr. Ford to what we're seeing now my job is report the news we search for all sorts of ways to to make sense of it to come up with words and story lines what I'm about to show you senator a colleague of yours my words not yours sir can only really be described as a type of long-running tantrum that Senator Lindsey Graham has been having more from him today as well as Mitch McConnell take a look you've humiliated this guy enough and they seems to be no bottom for somebody so why don't we duck in the water and safety floats goodness sake this is the United States of America nobody is supposed to be guilty until proven innocent what is your view of that rhetoric this effort to tap into a kind of anger over this if a Martian landed today and followed the body that you serve in the Senate they would think this man was about to lose life limb and home lose his career when in fact he has at least a standing chance a decent chance 48 to 48 of being promoted to one of the most powerful lifetime posts in the country no absolutely think about the fact that there are so many things that are disturbing here one is that in 2006 he did a number of presentations that according to senators like Senator Durbin who are there were at best misleading but pretty much outright lies and then again in the hearing last week numerous instances of misleading the Senate or lying to the Senate and then we of course we have this fact that that several women came forward at great personal risk to share their story and how are they being treated they are being treated as if they are criminals by this Republican majority they brought in a prosecutor in that poll setting last week that you gave a better description of it a nicer description of it but they basically brought in a prosecutor to put her on trial across the doctor for yes to cross-examine doctor for so it's the treatment of women here and if I can tell you so many women have called my office to share their story have written to my office to share their story the fact that they were assaulted at some point in his life often not sharing it with anyone often had reverberations for years and years and years it was a gutsy thing for women who are treated often by powerful white men as if they are the problem instead of an honest presenter of information what happened well this this crew of white Republican men the r11 in the committee proceeded to treat these individuals as if they are dishonest unacceptable and even as if they're they're the criminal that needs to be prosecuted it's it's a horrific horrific conduct by my colleagues well you put it in the wider context senator which is how it's how it's impacting people across the country as we continue to reckon with how to adjudicate these issues and it doesn't mean we know where every single one of them lands but we certainly I think to your point need to afford fairness and respect throughout the process and some of that is certainly lacking right now Senator Jeff Merkley thanks for spending time with us tonight you're very welcome thank you sir we go now directly to Democratic congressman Jackie Speier who has been a leader on these issues as well as Frank Montoya he's a former FBI Special Agent in Charge with a keen understanding of whether the FBI fits into all this and also Jennifer Rubin a conservative writer for The Washington Post she says Republicans misogyny under Trump may ultimately come back to quote haunt them congresswoman I bring in with you given what you're calling in the upper house there the upper chamber senator Merkley was saying that this is bigger than dr. Ford and Cavanaugh that people around the nation are having these conversations and that we're seeing that of course in the body with so many people charging the Senate hard office building what was on your mind when you saw those protests today and do you think this is still a 4848 well I must tell you I in many respects feel like the whole process has been rigged if anyone's been on trial here it's been sexual assault victims dr. Ford gave the most incredible testimony she had the president the United States saying she was credible and yet then he mocked her within days after making that statement this is a Ram job this is clearly a McConnell effort to get the Nirvana they've been seeking for a long time having a majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court guarantees them 30 years of being in control and I guess what I'm most concerned about right now is that men and women of this country who are sickened by what they've seen will go to the polls and vote because Congress still has a voice here we still have the power to check and balance the other two branches of government and we need to stand up Jennifer what were you getting across in your piece speaking as a as a conservative fellow-traveller so to speak I just want to comment on that appearance by those senators today they are so emotional almost hysterical I I would make a joke about it that they're behaving you know as if it's their time of the month but this is very very serious is it serious Jennifer although you you have the right to call the the male Senate press conference hysterical on this show you have that right well thank you yes I think what we saw in the last week was a transformation they decided instead of going from a respectful vein where they were going to defend their guy but not attack her they decided to make women the object of their ire and their malice this is a deliberate strategy to whip up their mostly male mostly white mostly non college-educated base and they do this at the expense of women they don't care whether they're dissuading women from coming forward they don't care whether they have made a mockery of their own words assuming respect for these people this is a strategy and that's why you see the hysteria that's why you see the president viciously mocking a victim of sexual let me let me ask you to build on that you just use the word strategy and I think that's so important because we were discussing this earlier in planning the show how emotion can be used as a way to override rationality we see that in certain court defenses we certainly see it here so what you're saying is well we're seeing senator Graham freak out and we're seeing the failings of those male senators in the press conference which again unlike the Judiciary Committee they can bring anyone to the conference they chose to run it that way you're saying it's not just a freakout it's a strategy I think I think there's an element of emotion because I think these guys are unhinged they feel like they're losing something but it absolutely is a deliberate strategy when you have the president I added states come out and attack the victim when you have his senior advisor come out and say oh she's been treated like a Faberge egg that is meant to inflame well you hear the president say it's a time that men have to be afraid that's an attempt to inflame emotions to transfer the victimology to a rich white Appellate Court judge and say no you guys are the victims that aren't you all mad about it this is what he did throughout the campaign throughout his presidency he usually does it with the emphasis on the white now he's doing it with the emphasis on the white male and mrs. male part of it but it's the same strategy that he's used against immigrants that he's used again and again because that's how he is able to bond with his base through this anger and this resentment Frank as an FBI expert walk us through what we are to make of a report that of course we can't see but is being described by some as either inconclusive because they weren't there to actually do forensics on what happened and by others as Republicans saying well no it it maybe shows there isn't quote corroboration of the underlying allegation I think Jennifer is exactly right when she uses the word mockery I mean it is a mockery of any kind of a legitimate investigation I mean there's a lot of people like to say that this is not a criminal investigation it isn't but even in a background investigation you know you're looking for the truth you're you're following the facts and you and you pull on these threads until there are no more threads to pull on and in this case that that simply just hasn't been done there are a vast number of people you know if we're to believe all the reporting out there that have not been contacted to be talked about potentially derogatory information about a candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court so it wanted makes no sense into it it is clearly not an investigation in in the way that I have always understand or understood an investigation to be defined congresswoman so where do you see this going what we touched on this but as an expert there inside Congress you've got some folks predicting the outcome you've got the questions around flake and Murkowski what do you see happening here well I think that in all likelihood that he is going to be confirmed and it's going to be a very sad day for the Supreme Court because if you compare Neil Gorsuch and his very moderate balanced approach to a man like Brett Kavanaugh who was attacking who was vicious who had a short fuse and who was very political he is a political hack and should be identified as such the sad day for the judiciary in this country and I would say from the Congressional standpoint the victims deserve a fulsome investigation that's what Senator flake wanted to see when only 9 out of 40 potential persons were actually interviewed that's a sham and when you don't have dr. Ford given the opportunity to expand on her testimony to give additional information she only answered the questions that were presented to her there are many more questions that could be presented to her and yet they didn't speak to her and they didn't speak again to Cavanaugh I think it's pretty obvious what they're doing here right I think what you say makes a lot of sense there is a question about well how many people are you gonna get when you go out to that second and third ring of sort of sources and knowledge and that's a debatable thing the notion that you're looking at an alleged incident in a room that allegedly has three people in it and you don't talk to some of those original three is certainly odd congresswoman Speier Frank Montoya and Jennifer Rubin thanks to each of you coming up we are doing maybe with the FBI wall we're gonna talk to Yale classmate who says the FBI didn't call him back the feds didn't get their side of the story but you will as part of our coverage also a conservative judge who had supported Kavanagh pulls back after comments like this revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups and I have a special report for you tonight on something that merits more attention before this vote is final Cavanaugh's apparent conflicts and where he might have to recuse or disqualify himself and then later my interview with the brother of the red state Democrat in the Senate who is in the news by coming out today no on Cavanaugh rml were you watching the beat on MSNBC hey I'm aria Melba from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
