1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
“So, at the end of the year,
Nikki will be leaving,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,446
and we’ll be
in constant touch.

3
00:00:06,446 --> 00:00:08,070
I know that whenever
you have any ideas,

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,950
you’re going to call me,

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,410
because you know
all the players.”

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,900
President Trump accepted
Nikki Haley’s resignation

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,180
as ambassador
to the United Nations.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,190
He appointed Haley
just weeks after winning

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,770
the presidential
election.

10
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,510
“It has been an honor
of a lifetime.”

11
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,050
She first served under
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,240
who preferred
behind-the-scenes diplomacy,

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,920
allowing Haley to step in as

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,770
the public face of
U.S. foreign policy.

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,770
Haley became a regular on the
Sunday political talk shows.

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,200
“And Jerusalem is where
the prime minister is,

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,230
the president is, the
Parliament, the Supreme Court.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,420
It makes sense for
our embassy to be there.”

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,870
But one appearance caused a
rift with the administration.

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,780
In April, Haley announced
there would be

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,800
tougher sanctions on Russia
for supporting

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,650
This apparently caught
Trump off guard,

24
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,810
and one official said
Haley was perhaps confused.

25
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,890
“In the last half-hour,

26
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,180
I was able to get in
touch with Nikki Haley

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,910
and she said, quote,

28
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,850
‘With all due respect,
I don’t get confused.’”

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,250
Haley also championed
controversial policy decisions

30
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,810
on the world stage.

31
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,420
She slashed funds to the
Palestinian aid agency,

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,450
withdrew from the
Human Rights Council

33
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,790
and made her opposition
to Iran her signature goal.

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,610
In December, Haley staged
a presentation of missiles

35
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,100
at a military base in
Washington, accusing

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,340
Iran of providing weapons
to Houthi rebels in Yemen.

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,390
“The weapons might
as well have had

38
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,080
‘Made in Iran’ stickers
all over it.”

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,690
Her evidence fell short,
but it served as a step

40
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,310
in the Trump
administration’s effort

41
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,080
to punish Iran
for its activities

42
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,690
throughout the Middle East.

43
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,200
“I, Michael Richard Pompeo …”

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,560
When Mike Pompeo became
secretary of state

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,810
and John Bolton,
national security adviser,

46
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,590
they took a more
public approach,

47
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,930
and Haley became
less influential.

48
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,790
Bolton became more
involved with issues

49
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,190
in Haley’s portfolio,

50
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,350
like Iran and the
International Criminal Court.

51
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,330
Haley had many
successes of her own,

52
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,240
including passing sweeping
sanctions on North Korea

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,650
and imposing an arms
embargo on South Sudan.

54
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,010
“Look at what has happened
in two years with

55
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,290
the United States
on foreign policy.

56
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,139
Now, the United States
is respected.

57
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,460
Countries may not
like what we do,

58
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,490
but they respect
what we do.”

59
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,120
And Haley was widely respected
by her diplomatic colleagues,

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,740
even those from
nations who disagreed

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,770
with this administration’s
foreign policy decisions.

62
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,320
Many in the U.N. saw Haley
as a reasonable figure

63
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,350
in an otherwise
unpredictable administration —

64
00:02:28,350 --> 00:00:00,000
and are closely watching
who might succeed her.
