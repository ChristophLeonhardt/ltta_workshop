this woman don't want to let a little girl sell some water she calling police on an eight-year-old little girl this is permit Patti I will not call her by her actual name in order not the dock sir but she's a lot like barbecue Becky but instead of hating the fact that black people are having barbecues out in the open Patti is vent that an eight-year-old black girl is trying to sell water to buy tickets to Disneyland outside of Patti's office oh you hide all you want the whole world don't see you boo yeah and illegally selling water without a permit yeah on my property it's not your property and neither barbecue Becky nor permit patty or boilerplate maggot jugs I mean both of these people are most likely liberals actually I mean permit patty literally owns a friggin weed business for dogs now the problem here is that there are a lot of people like patty all over the country who call the police like they're calling in a bulk trash pickup they weaponized cops against people of color who bother them even though they're aware of the dangers this may present since cops are kind of famous for escalating incidents especially against people of color why are they shooting at home this is the execution of 17 year old Antoine Rose which happened only four days before the permit patty thing Antoine was unarmed and running away from a cops warned in only 20 hours prior to an East Pittsburgh Police Department the cop wasn't a rookie however he was a seasoned police officer with eight years on the force why was he being sworn in on the day he shot and killed a teenager because he had been fired from a previous station now luckily no such escalation occurred with patty it turns out she was merely threatening the family by fake calling the cops demonstrating that she's very aware of her privilege to weaponize the police force to harass and intimidate people but another glaring hypocrisy grew out of Patty's justification the girl and her mother were selling water without a permit which is hilarious because as it turns out patty is the owner of a marijuana business a business which sells marijuana supplements without a permit and given that there are thousands of men and women still locked behind bars for selling cannabis or even merely possessing it it is insane to me that people cannot see the very obvious double standard here so please stop calling the cops on people of color like you're calling customer service even though you've been programmed to think everyone else is here to serve you and exercise empathy also speaking of empathy stop sending death threats this idiot she's already being punished financially I'm Aslam piker please don't forget to download the TYT app for free if you want to see more videos in a timely manner and this has been the breakdown
