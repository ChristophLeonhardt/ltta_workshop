1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,875
>> Tucker: CALIFORNIA AND NEW

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:12,210
JERSEY SPENT DECADES OF BEACONS

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,946
OF OPPORTUNITY TO THE ENTIRE

4
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:15,280
WORLD.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,849
NOW PEOPLE CAN'T FLEE THEM FAST

6
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,451
ENOUGH.

7
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:24,723
IN CALIFORNIA HOUSES ARE

8
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:25,190
UNAFFORDABLE.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,392
AND THE MIDDLE-CLASS IS GONE

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,695
WITH THE IMMIGRANTS.

11
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:34,232
AND DEMOCRATIC SENATORS HARRIS

12
00:00:34,232 --> 00:00:36,501
AND COREY BOOKER HAVE

13
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,135
A SOLUTION.

14
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:38,303
SMOKE MORE WEED.

15
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:41,406
>> I AM SIGNING ON TO THE

16
00:00:41,406 --> 00:00:43,041
MARIJUANA JUSTICE ACT.

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,844
>> IT TWO OF THE LAST THREE

18
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:48,380
PRESIDENTS ADSPLITTED TO USING

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,714
DRUGS.

20
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,917
CONGRESS AND SENATORS USE

21
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:52,317
MARIJUANA.

22
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:54,486
>> OTHER COMMUNITIES IT IS

23
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:55,153
CRIMINALIZED.

24
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,422
>> IT IS TIME TO LEGALIZE

25
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,424
MARIJUANA IN OUR STATE AND

26
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:01,693
EXPUNGE THE RECORDS OF THOSE

27
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:08,867
CARRYING THE CONVICTIONS.

28
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:08,984
N

29
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:10,836
>> ALL BECAUSE OF A DRUG THAT

30
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:11,970
SHOULD BE LEGAL.

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,538
>> Tucker: GREAT TO SEE YOU.

32
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:15,574
I WANT TO PREFACE OUR

33
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,409
CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK

34
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,978
PEOPLE WHO SMOKE WEED SHOULD BE

35
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:21,313
IN JAIL.

36
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,883
THE DRUG WAR DID NOT WORK WITH.

37
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:27,119
AND ALCOHOL IS IN A LOT OF WAYS

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,488
WORSE THAN MARIJUANA, AND SO I

39
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:30,622
BELIEVE ALL THAT.

40
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:36,995
I AM JUST AMAZED THAT THE RULING

41
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:39,297
CLASS FAILING TO TAKE CARE OF

42
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:41,366
THEIR OWN PEOPLE IS TESTIFYING

43
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,268
THEM TO SMOKE MORE WEED AND BE

44
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,970
MORE PASSIVE AND LESS CONCERNED

45
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,838
BY OUR FAILURES.

46
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:47,839
I DON'T THINK THAT IS AN

47
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,040
ACCIDENT, DO YOU?

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,276
>> I DON'T THINK THEY ARE

49
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:54,179
TELLING US TO SMOKE MORE WEED.

50
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,516
PEOPLE ARE SMOKING BEAD AND 80

51
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:02,154
YEAR WAS REEFER MADNESS IS NOT

52
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:02,654
STOPPING.

53
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,090
AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS POTENTIAL

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,126
MEDICAL BENEFITS OF MARIJUANA

55
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,693
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T STUDIED.

56
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:13,298
WE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT

57
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:13,799
CLASSIFICATION.

58
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,534
AND STATES LIKE COLORADO

59
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:19,938
GENERATED A QUARTER OF BILLION

60
00:02:19,938 --> 00:02:20,972
A YEAR.

61
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:23,041
>> Tucker: NOW YOU ARE MAKING MY

62
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,476
CASE FOR ME.

63
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:27,979
I THINK WE SHOULD FULLY EXPLORE

64
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:31,349
THE POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF

65
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:31,750
CANNABIS.

66
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,451
THERE ARE PROBABLY BIG ONES.

67
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,620
I AM ALL FOR THAT.

68
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,156
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T I BE

69
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:40,125
SUSPICIOUS OVER HUNDRED THOUSAND

70
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,860
CALIFORNIANS ARE SLEEPING

71
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,227
OUTSIDE.

72
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:43,795
BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE HARRIS HAVE

73
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,764
DONE A TERRIBLE JOB TO TAKING

74
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:48,300
CARE OF THE PEOPLE AND HER

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,935
SOLUTION IS SMOKE MORE WEED SO I

76
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:53,305
CAN HAVE MORE MONEY IN THE TAX

77
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:56,374
COFFERS AND YOU WILL BE LESS

78
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:57,609
LIKELY STAGE A REVOLUTION

79
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,644
AGAINST MY LEADERSHIP.

80
00:02:59,644 --> 00:03:01,713
I AM NOT PARINOID.

81
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:05,183
>> SHE IS A NEW SENATOR, AND SO.

82
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:08,753
>> SHE WAS ELECTED STATEWIDE FOR

83
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,155
A LONG TIME.

84
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,356
>> THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

85
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:13,191
BUT WHAT WE HAVE WITH THE

86
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,392
HOMELESS POPULATION.

87
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:16,228
THERE IS A LOT OF CARE NEEDED

88
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:18,396
THERE AND IF THAT REVENUE GOES

89
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,332
TO PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ADDICTION

90
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,666
CARE THAT IS A WONDERFUL THING.

91
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,202
AND SO IF THE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY

92
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:25,971
SMOKING MARIJUANA AND CONSUMING

93
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:29,674
OR EDIBLES OR OILS, LET'S

94
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,676
LEGALIZE TAX AND GET IT OFF OF

95
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:32,744
THE SHELVES.

96
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:34,713
AND WHO IS BRINGING IT ACROSS

97
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,815
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY.

98
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:39,150
YOU WANT TO STOP THEM?

99
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,254
>> CARTELS ARE JUST A MARKET AND

100
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,155
WHEN THE PRICE OF ANYTHING GOES

101
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:44,456
UP.

102
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:46,691
IF YOU CAN UNDERCUT IT

103
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,092
ILLEGALLY.

104
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:47,993
YOU CAN DO THAT.

105
00:03:47,993 --> 00:03:50,562
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WITH

106
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,230
CIGARETTES AND THEY ARE

107
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,664
BOOTLEGGED.

108
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:55,100
IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU ARE

109
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,034
MAKING IT.

110
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:59,437
DON'T COMPARE MARIJUANA TO

111
00:03:59,437 --> 00:03:59,804
ALCOHOL.

112
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:03,174
I DON'T DRINK.

113
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:06,945
COMPARE IT TO SOBRIETY AND BEING

114
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,713
AWARE AND FULLY EXPERIENCING

115
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,383
YOUR LIFE AND FIGHTING BACK

116
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,151
AGAINST MISUSED POWER.

117
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:15,587
PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH DON'T DO

118
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:15,921
THAT.

119
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:19,024
>> IF THEY ARE DRINKING BEER, IS

120
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,257
THAT ANY DIFFERENT.

121
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:24,262
IT DIDN'T WORK WITH THE

122
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:24,863
PROHIBITION.

123
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,498
>> Tucker: WHY SHOULDN'T I BE

124
00:04:26,498 --> 00:04:26,932
SUSPICIOUS.

125
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:28,833
THEY HAVE FAILED THEIR OWN

126
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,202
PEOPLE AND THEN ENCOURAGING US

127
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:33,238
TO SMOKE MORE WEED.

128
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,374
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY IS

129
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,575
ENCOURAGING THEM UNLESS YOU HAVE

130
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,811
CANCER AND YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO

131
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,080
KEEP YOUR FOOD DOWN AND THAT IS

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,882
A SIDE BENEFITS.

133
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:45,817
I DON'T SMOKE IT EITHER, TUCKER

134
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:49,020
AND I SEE THE BENEFITS

135
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,288
MEDICINALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO

136
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,023
BENEFITS AND IF IT IS ONE OF

137
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,024
THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE

138
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,294
ARE DOING IT AND CRIMINAL

139
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,629
ELEMENTS ARE BENEFITTING AND

140
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,565
BRINGING IT OUT IN THE SUNLIGHT.

141
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:01,733
>> THE GOVERNMENT IS THIS BE

142
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,368
GETTING RICH ON IT.

143
00:05:03,368 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO BALANCE
