the federal government just loves their big-screen TVs and today I'll show you which ministries and government agencies are the biggest spenders on luxury televisions order paper questions asked in the House of Commons are a thing that compels the government to actually answer for once and provide some real data within a set amount of time it's the law and so far it's one of the laws the Liberals haven't broken yet so I don't know I guess that's good now these order paper questions when well deployed by the opposition are an incredible tool for transparency it forces the government to cut their BS and their spin and all the political doublespeak and jargon about helping the middle class now here's the latest order paper question asked by the Conservative MP for Oxford Dave Mackenzie now Mackenzie asked with regard to the purchase of televisions since February 1st 2017 broken down by Department and agency what is the total value of televisions purchased how many televisions have been purchased and what are the details of each purchase including making model size price per unit quantity was the TV 4k TV was the TV 3d TV now look I don't know what prompted this question from McKenzie but it is a pretty good one because the answers that came back are crazy we did get a breakdown of television purchases by department now I'm not gonna trouble you with all the small details of what those tvs were making model etc but I'll give you the bulk spending numbers and I'll get to some of those in a quick minute but first I want to give you a little more context so you can put this enormous spending I'm about to show you into better real-life perspective the price for a 70-inch Ultra High Definition LG Smart TV at Costco delivered directly to your door is under $2,000 now don't get me wrong 2 grand is a lot of money especially if it's actually your money that you're spending but keep that 2 grand number in mind as we go through some of these enormous it furnitures the first one the Department of National Defense spent over 1 million dollars on TV 1 TV alone cost over $8,000 this is the very same Department that is forcing Canadian soldiers to share sleeping bags amongst themselves and use three decade old rucksacks but now they're claiming they need hundreds of TV's because and I quote on military operation centers or accommodation facilities at sea on bases and wings across the country the Canadian Armed Forces rely on televisions as a tool of situational awareness and as a support for personnel morale and welfare you know what that I'm totally fine with give our soldiers that tools they need to be safe well trained and well connected to their families but this is where it gets wasteful the annex of TVs also includes large size smart board touch screens obtained for public outreach purposes which is key to improving Canadian knowledge and understanding of their military can we just pump the brakes here and get our military enough sleeping bags and maybe some f-35s before we worried about the civilian public playing with touch screens please moving right along Global Affairs spent six hundred and seventy thousand dollars on TVs too I suppose watch Krista Freeland participate in panels that call President Trump a tyrant blowing NAFTA up in your own face must look way better in high-def the Canada Revenue Agency spent 150 thousand dollars on new TVs so they can look at your tax returns on the big screen the nuclear Commission spent one hundred and forty thousand dollars on TVs immigration spent thirteen thousand indigenous services spent 23 thousand dollars on just three new TVs because who needs clean drinking waters on reserve right innovation spent two hundred and ninety one thousand and then thousands more on regional offices like another eighty six thousand for new TVs for the Quebec Regional Development Office the Space Agency spent one hundred and three thousand Statistics Canada spent three hundred and twenty four thousand justice spent twenty eight thousand which is one of those places I might agree with this spending if it is to videoconference court appearances to speed up the slower than molasses in January justice system we have here in Canada Canadian Border Services Agency spent one hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars because what's an illegal border crisis anyway the RCMP spent two hundred and thirty three thousand now I saved the very best for last Catherine McKenna's Department spent $10,000 on one new TV and seventy five hundred dollars on another now I assume those TVs are powered by McKenna's bike right plus they spend another sixteen thousand four TVs at the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and another seven thousand at Parks Canada and both agencies as you know are under Catherine McTell evasions purview good thing she cares so much about climate change could you imagine the number of TVs she'd have if she didn't the next time Canadian veterans should ask for overpriced TVs instead of better pensions and reasonable compensation for their injuries the Trudeau government was more than willing to swing open the vault for that for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read speaking of unreasonable spending and neglected veterans did you know that the Trudeau government Forks over $50,000 in cash aid to every Syrian migrant family that comes to Canada while at the same time telling our veterans that they're asking for more than the government is willing to give to sign my petition calling on the government to treat our veterans at least as well as they treat migrants and to see all the details and documents go to fifty thousand CA you
