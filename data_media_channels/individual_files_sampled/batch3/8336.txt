Tucker: TWO WEEKS FROM NOW, DNC DEPUTY CHAIRMAN KEITH ELLISON MAY BECOME THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. THIS DESPITE ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE THAT HAVE BEEN LEVELED AT HIM BY HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND, KAREN MONAHAN. KAREN MONAHAN IS A LIBERAL, SHE IS A DEMOCRAT, BUT SHE HAS ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE POOR TREATMENT SHE HAS RECEIVED FROM FELLOW DEMOCRATS SHE WAS BOLD ENOUGH TO GO PUBLIC WITH HER ALLEGATIONS. HAS ANYTHING CHANGED IN THE WEEKS SINCE SHE SAID THAT? KAREN MONAHAN AND HER ATTORNEY, ANDREW PARKER, JOIN US TONIGHT. THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING ON. THANK YOU, TUCKER. THANK YOU. Tucker: KAREN, YOU SAID PUBLICLY THAT SINCE COMING FORWARD WITH YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST KEITH ELLISON, THAT YOU WERE IN EFFECT BLACKLISTED BY FELLOW DEMOCRATS APPEARED CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEANT WHEN YOU SAID THAT? I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT SOCIAL MEDIA, IF YOU SEE SOME OF THE LETTERS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN, THAT BASICALLY SAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME. THE FOLKS WHO HAVE SIGNED ON, IT IS PRETTY APPARENT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BULLYING, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HARASSMENT. ISOLATION. BY MANY FOLKS THAT I STOOD SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH, SUPPORTING THEM IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS, WALKING WITH THEM IN VARIOUS PROTESTS, WORKED TOGETHER ON DIFFERENT ISSUES AROUND SOCIAL JUSTICE. Tucker: THAT IS NOT THE RECEPTION THAT PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY ARE SURVIVORS OF ABUSE EXPECT THEY ARE GOING TO GET FROM THE LEFT, FROM DEMOCRATS. WERE YOU SURPRISED BY IT? NO. I WATCHED THE #MeToo MOVEMENT, I'VE WATCHED BOTH SIDES, BASICALLY TAKE WOMEN'S PAIN AND USE IT AS A TOOL FOR POLITICS. AND ONCE IT CAME TO ONE SIDE OR TO THE OTHER, YOU WOULD SEE THE SAME PEOPLE START PUSHING AWAY FROM IT AND SAYING STUFF LIKE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REAL ISSUE ISSUES. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE. Tucker: AND HER PARTNER, DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION IN MINNESOTA INVESTIGATED THIS IN A LEGITIMATE WAY? THESE CLAIMS? NO, IT WASN'T LEGITIMATE AT ALL. ANY OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF IT WOULD REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION. THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE KICKED IT TO THE DFL PARTY IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, WHO HIRED THEIR LAWYER TO INVESTIGATE THEIR CANDIDATE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL. NOT JUST THEIR CANDIDATE, TUCKER, FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL, BUT ACROSS THE LEFT, FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, A LEADER OF THE PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT, NOT JUST IN MINNESOTA, BUT NATIONALLY. THE VICE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS WHO THEY WERE INVESTIGATING, AND THEY HIRED THEIR OWN LAWYER, NOT AN OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT LAWYER, THEIR OWN LAWYER, AND A LAW FIRM THAT RAISED OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN OVER $50,000 PER KEITH ELLISON HIMSELF. Tucker: THAT IS NOT LEGITIMATE. KAREN, YOU HAVE SAID, ALLEGEDLY, THERE IS A VIDEO THAT SHOWS YOU BEING DRAGGED OFF THE BED BY KEITH ELLISON, HIM SWEARING AT YOU. IT DOES THAT DO EXIST? YES. Tucker: WILL THE PUBLIC HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IT? OF THE PUBLIC WILL NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IT. THAT IS MY PAIN, AND FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, FOR EVERYONE TO LOOK AT AND BOGGLE OVER, SOMETHING THAT VERY TRAUMATIZING FOR ME, ABSOLUTELY NOT. I WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO SEE IT. IF AND WHEN I DECIDE TO SHOW IT TO SOMEBODY, IT WILL BE IN MY TIME. THIS IS A PROCESS. AND JUST TO FIND THE COURAGE TO COME OUT AND BREAK MY SILENCE, AS I SAID, KNOWING THE BACKLASH THAT I WOULD GET AN KNOWING THAT THIS IS A JOURNEY THAT I WOULD WALK PRETTY MUCH ON MY OWN, IT TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE. AND I HAVE TO FACE THE SAME FEARS THAT SO MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED FACED WHEN THEY DECIDED TO EITHER SHARE THEIR STORY OR NOT SHARE THEIR STORY. IT IS ALSO THE SAME KIND OF FEAR THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION, HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT LONG BEFORE I EVER SHARED WENT PUBLIC WITH IT WHY THEY SIT SILENT. OR THEY ARE AFRAID TO SHOW PUBLIC SUPPORT. MANY HAVE BEEN BULLIED AND INTIMIDATED, IF THEY DID COME OUT AND SHOW ANY KIND OF PUBLIC SUPPORT, AND I GRAPPLED WITH THAT SAME FEAR. THE FEAR OF ISOLATION, THE FEAR OF BEING RE-VICTIMIZED. Tucker: THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FEEL, ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING YOU FEEL THAT WAY. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING A
