00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,417
JESSE: NBC NEWS AND MSNBC HAVE

2
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,719
BEEN RUNNING THIS SOUND BITE

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,420
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP ALL

4
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:13,122
YESTERDAY AND ALL TODAY, AND

5
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,090
IT'S TOTALLY TAKEN OUT OF

6
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:15,524
CONTEXT.

7
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,894
THIS IS WHAT NBC NEWS HAS PLAYED

8
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:19,695
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP TALKING ABOUT

9
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,296
THE CIVIL WAR AND THEN I'LL

10
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:25,234
EXPLAIN WHAT THEY CUT OUT

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:25,634
AFTERWARDS.

12
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,437
PRESIDENT TRUMP: ROBERT E. LEE

13
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:31,407
WAS A GREAT GENERAL.

14
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:32,741
ABRAHAM LINCOLN DEVELOPED A

15
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,842
PHOBIA.

16
00:00:33,843 --> 00:00:36,045
HE COULDN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.

17
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:39,048
HE WAS GOING CRAZY.

18
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,884
ROBERT E. LEE WAS WINNING BATTLE

19
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:45,587
AFTER BATTLE AFTER BATTLE, AND

20
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,222
ABRAHAM LINCOLN CAME HOME AND

21
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:50,959
SAID I CAN'T BEAT ROBERT E. LEE.

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,928
HE HAD ALL OF THESE GENERALS WHO

23
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,030
LOOKED GREAT, THEY WERE TOP OF

24
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,131
THEIR CLASS AT WEST POINT.

25
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:58,300
THEY WERE THE GREATEST PEOPLE.

26
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:00,202
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

27
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,971
THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THE HELL TO

28
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:03,238
WIN.

29
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,441
JESSE: THEN HE GOES ON DURING

30
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:09,611
THE SPEECH AND SAYS YOU HIS SEES

31
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,647
GRANT THEY FOUND OUT HAD A

32
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:14,483
DRINKING PROBLEM, DIDN'T LOOK

33
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,318
GREAT, THEY PICKED HIM, HE KNEW

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,487
HOW TO WIN AND GOT THE JOB DONE.

35
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:21,724
NOW THEY ARE JUST SAYING DONALD

36
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,292
TRUMP PRAISES CONFEDERATE

37
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,728
GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE AS GREAT.

38
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,732
>> THIS IS THE NARRATIVE THE

39
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,166
MAINSTREAM MEDIA ALWAYS WANTS TO

40
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,968
DO.

41
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,170
92% OF COVERAGE OF THIS

42
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,405
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN NEGATIVE.

43
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:40,509
THAT WOULD BE FINE IF WE WERE AT

44
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,511
25% UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE WORST

45
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:43,412
CRIME IN HISTORY.

46
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,748
BUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS

47
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:46,648
BEING SELECTIVE OF THEIR

48
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:47,750
COVERAGE OF TRUMP.

49
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,818
THEY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE FULL

50
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:50,652
STORY.

51
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:51,954
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE VERY

52
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:52,287
SMART.

53
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,957
THEY ARE TIRED OF THE MAINSTREAM

54
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,158
MEDIA LYING TO THEM.

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,327
THE BEST THING WE HAVE IS DONALD

56
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,129
TRUMP DIRECTLY TO THE AMERICAN

57
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,231
PEOPLE GIG HIS MESSAGE.

58
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:05,267
HE WENT ON TO SAY, WE FOUND THIS

59
00:02:05,268 --> 00:02:11,273
GUY, HE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

60
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:15,077
ULYSSES H. GRANT WENT ON TO WIN

61
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,180
THE WAR AND HE BECAME A PRETTY

62
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,348
GOOD PRESIDENT.

63
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,817
JESSE: HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

64
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:23,886
ROBERT E. LEE MILITARILY WAS GOD

65
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:24,887
AT KILLING PEOPLE.

66
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:27,456
HE WASN'T PRAISING THE GUY FOR

67
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:29,391
WHAT HE STOOD FOR.

68
00:02:29,392 --> 00:02:32,861
DO THEY HAVE EDITORS AT NBC

69
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,665
SAYING YOU DECEPTIVELY EDITED

70
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,167
THE PRESIDENT'S SOUND BITE?

71
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:42,070
>> I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE SETTING

72
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,305
THIS STRAIGHT.

73
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:44,840
HE 10 MINUTES TODAY, THEY ARE

74
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:47,209
JUST DOING THIS OUT OF THE BLUE.

75
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,845
TRUMP JUST STARTED PRAISING

76
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:52,648
ROBERT E. LEE.

77
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:54,449
BY THE WAY, HE WAS A GREAT

78
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,754
GENERAL AND IS STUDIED THE WAY

79
00:02:58,755 --> 00:02:59,655
THAT

80
00:02:59,656 --> 00:02:59,688
WAAT

81
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,891
WAY -- THE WAY NAPOLEON IS

82
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:03,659
STUDIED.

83
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,995
HE WAS CRUSHING THE UNION A

84
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:09,131
QUARTER OF THE SIZE OF THE

85
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:09,431
FORCE.

86
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,200
HALF OF HIS SOLDIERS WERE

87
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:15,437
BAREFOOT BUT HE WAS STILL

88
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:17,673
BEATING THE UNION ARMY.

89
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:20,542
JESSE: I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY

90
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:24,146
THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

91
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,414
>> THANKFULLY BECAUSE OF THIS

92
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,782
SHOW THEY CAN'T.

93
00:03:26,783 --> 00:03:30,185
JESSE: AT CNN THIS IS WHAT

94
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,020
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THE

95
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,856
RIGHT RIGHTLY SO HAS CALLED

96
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:38,126
THESE ALMOST ANTIFA-TYPE PEOPLE,

97
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:40,295
LEFT WING ACTIVISTS A MOB.

98
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,764
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ON CNN.

99
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,767
>> WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE TED

100
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,236
CRUZ GETTING CHASED OUT OF THE

101
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:48,971
RESTAURANTS LIKE A MOB --

102
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,240
>> OH, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO USE

103
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,174
THE MOB WORD.

104
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:55,010
>> IT'S TOTALLY A MOB.

105
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,778
>> MATT, MATT, MATT.

106
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,146
A MOB?

107
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:02,651
STOP.

108
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,354
JESSE: THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE

109
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:09,892
MEANS OF THE WORD TO FIT THEIR

110
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:10,259
NARRATIVE.

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,762
>> THEY FORGOT TO BE COMPLETELY

112
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:14,363
HONEST.

113
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,064
THESE GUYS ARE SO LIBERAL THEY

114
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:17,766
LOST ALL THEIR VIEWERSHIP.

115
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,002
NOW THEY HAVE LOST ALL OF MIDDLE

116
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:20,669
AMERICA.

117
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,436
WHAT HAPPENED?

118
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:23,505
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE ON

119
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:26,875
TELEVISION TED CRUZ BEING

120
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,143
CHASTISED IN A RESTAURANT.

121
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:31,213
THEY SEE THIS FROM MULTIPLE

122
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:32,281
PEOPLE, FROM A MOB.

123
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,016
THIS WASN'T ONE PERSON.

124
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:37,619
THIS WAS A MOB OF PEOPLE.

125
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,354
WHAT'S AMAZING, IT NEVER HAPPENS

126
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,590
TO ME, I KIND OF LOOK FORWARD TO

127
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,058
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

128
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:47,029
BUT THE MOB MENTALITY IS DESTROY

129
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,463
PROPERTY AND THROW ROCKS THROUGH

130
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:51,033
WINDOWS AND LIGHT CARS ON FIRE,

131
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:53,635
DESTROY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

132
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:54,403
HEADQUARTERS.

133
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,672
NOBODY WANTS TO COVER THOSE.

134
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:59,942
THEY ARE NOT JUST ANGRY PEOPLE

135
00:04:59,943 --> 00:05:02,644
WHO WANT TO DESTROY YOUR

136
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,547
PROPERTY AND GRAFFITI.

137
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:08,650
JESSE: COREY SAYS HE WELCOMES

138
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,218
THE MOB.

139
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,821
HE'S NOT AFRAID OF THE MOB.

140
00:05:12,822 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU I HAVE A BOOK ON THE MOB YOU
