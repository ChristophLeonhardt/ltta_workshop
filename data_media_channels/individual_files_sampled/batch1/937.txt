Mike Pompeo faced protesters at his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was trying to sell himself as America's next top diplomat no senators are suggesting he may not be right for the job the current CIA director easily won the nomination for that rule but Secretary of State is a bigger job with a broader responsibility while Democrats were seeking to find common ground with Trump try to figure out some ways they could demonstrate some bipartisanship and I think that the reservoir of potential goodwill that Trump had in January of 2017 with Senate Democrats has dissipated significantly since then a former Kansas congressman a former US Army officer some senators have been unsettled by pompiers past positions he opposes the Iran nuclear deal has criticized gay marriage has claimed Muslims are a threat to America he's seen as a hawk someone who promotes an aggressive foreign policy there's no one as you just heard in what I described there's no one like someone who served in uniform who understands the value of display maseeh and the terror and tragedy that is war like someone who served in uniform it's the last resort it must always be so god bless you all Pompeyo was picked for the job of Secretary of State after Rex Tillerson was unceremoniously sacked by tweet in March compiled recently made news by holding secret talks with North Korean leader Kim jong-un paving the way for a summit in the coming weeks President Donald Trump is urging a yes on his pick the public and Senator Rand Paul has already said he will oppose the nomination and Democrats don't think you'll do enough to stand up to the president we didn't hear any evidence at the hearing for director Pompeo that he was willing to do that so now as the committee vote is crucial for Donald Trump it would be really bad for Donald Trump with a Republican Senate to fail to achieve confirmation of his chosen Secretary of State Donald Trump thinks that Mike Pompeo will be a better fit for the job as his top diplomat someone who knows someone he believes he can trust Mike Pompeo thinks like the president we'll echo his view on important issues on a global stage the senators on the Foreign Relations Committee have to decide if that's something they want Alan Fisher al Jazeera Washington
