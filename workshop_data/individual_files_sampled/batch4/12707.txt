the overweening arrogance of Barack Obama cursed his party for the last eight years and led to the rise of Donald Trump after spending nearly a decade acting as a political celebrity Obama has now been replaced by an actual political celebrity after spending a decade - crying Americans as racists and bigots Obama has been replaced by a man who tells Americans they don't need to be ashamed of disagreeing with Obama Obama more than any other single personality except for Hillary Clinton felt the wrath of the voters on November 9 but there is good news according to Obama the election was not about him he explained on a conference call with other Democrats yesterday quote let me tell you something we got more of them than any administration in the last we knows how many decades look one of the challenges that I've discovered being president is that like to be organizer entry well it's hard you got cereal you got made up you got summit meetings economic issues you have to deal with on an ongoing basis you try to get legislation done this morning Obama added there is a mismatch between frustration and anger because people seem to think I did a pretty good job this has been a running theme with Obama the only reason Americans don't bow to his superior wisdom is we have been dramatically misinformed if only the great sage of our age had the time to speak to Americans personally you know between the rounds of golf and the Kimmel appearances he would have bought Hillary would have won but it doesn't matter after all he's really really popular so clearly this had nothing to do with him now if that sounds like a switch that's because it is Obama spent most of his campaign explaining his legacy was inextricably intertwined with Hillary Clinton's election in a video he cut just weeks before the election he said quote if you want to give Michelle and me a good send-off get people registered to vote if you care about our legacy realize everything we stand for is at stake Obama even called it a personal insult to his legacy if black voters didn't show up to vote for Hillary but that's the wonderful thing about being a narcissist like President Obama if something wonderful happens it's solely due to you just remember Obama's self-glorifying announcement about the killing of bin Laden when it sounded like Obama repelled down from a helicopter and put two in bin Laden's face if something terrible happens however it's not Obama's fault it's everybody else's fault it's this sort of narcissism that lies at the root of Democrats defeat in 2016 and future defeats as they continue to do this routine they think their losses have nothing to do with them it's just because of Republican malfeasance and cruelty and so they don't bother to change their behavior well thank God for that the more they insist their impeccable the more they double down on losing strategy so for the last time thanks Obama I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show all righty so we begin today with so much to talk about today we'll get to the update from DePaul University the reason that I'm broadcasting from this hotel room as you can see this beautiful luxurious hotel room but not our normal studios would be with the western barn wall Becker is because I am a broadcaster from Chicago where Rahm Emanuel be bursting down the door at any moment to drag me away and call me an illegal immigrant but before we get to all of the content that we have for you in there's plenty first have to give a shout out to our new advertisers over at C so C so is s des Oh calm and this is a

all the time see so calm again use that's that promo code Bend and you get two three months and you can watch comedies of your choosing without commercials okay so lots to get to today so first the update from from DePaul so I'm supposed to speak at DePaul University tonight now as you may recall DePaul University bans me about what would have been about a year not even here than me six months ago was my lucky innopolis spoke here and the students went nuts and rushed the stage and so they decided that instead of punishing the students for being terrible people and for violating basic standards of Western civilization they decided instead to to ban Milo and then they also banned me for good measure just because there had been a basic riot over at Cal State LA so here is the situation right now they banned me the young America's Foundation chapter here invited me they also invited Christina Hoff Sommers is a wonderful theorist about feminism to speak tonight when they found out that I was coming they immediately threatened to cancel the entire event if I were to speak to which I said okay fine I'll just common sit in the audience and if I have a question that lasts half an hour then that'll be okay but they said no we can't even allow you to sit in the audience now so now that they are actually threatening that if I step on campus this is the latest they are threatening that if I set foot on campus they will arrest me is is my understanding of the situation although I would like clarification from the local police department that will be forced to take me to lockup if I set foot on campus don't worry we have contingency plans we will go forward as plans things will happen tonight and it'll be a lot of fun we'll be streaming all that but it does demonstrate the insanity and weakness to the left meanwhile it is amazing that the same left that will activate the cops to shut down free speech in a room that is a lecture they have nothing to say about these massive protests that are taking place across the country people being beaten up things being shut down freeways being shut down streets being shut down the left is truly an astonishing display of hypocrisy and and fascism and we will bring you that lot I mean I'm Ashley I will go to campus and we will bring that to you live stream it will have a bunch of people taping it there's supposed to be some massive protests as I say my understanding is they're not going to allow me on campus and we will see whether that is true or not meanwhile the left continues to demonstrate just why they lost and why they deserve to lose morally what's always deserves to leave morally but the real reason I think they lost in this election cycle is people just got pissed off of the life people just said you know what we are so sick of this crap you and your whiny baby attitudes you and your calling everybody racist sexist pig and homophobe it's very tiresome and we're just done we're not gonna do that anymore that's not stopping the left from from doing more of what the left likes to do for example here is a woman who was on Facebook live-streaming herself from parading an Iowa police officer for committing the graves in this Iowa police officer committed the grave sin while wearing the black band around his arm in honor of a fallen officer you're live we're building an audience okay we're streaming live in Hawaii to downtown Cedar Rapids we got the good morning but she doesn't give touch about the man who's in critical care at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics with the bulletins net wonderful vicious thugs brothers in blue whoo I don't know what to say y'all I think this WI TCH is going to seriously arrest me because some uptight Iowan a-hole thought I was impolite tell that police girl she has a cute ass and she can spend the night in my solitary bathroom my friend Dennis just put that up where am I brew he Mia stop this idiot says she livestreams this whole thing up here on the black band is around the bad you can see in the video not around the arm in any case this is what the left is the West takes glory in this this is sort of reminiscent of that woman who livestreams her her conversation with an uber driver where she lectured uber driver about cultural appropriation who's a no hula dancer honest on his dashboard the more the left exposes itself is the beautiful thing about social media is why we're gonna have lots of cameras there tonight the beautiful thing about all of this is that the more the left exposes itself the more they demonstrate just why Americans should not trust them with anything under any circumstances and I may not like the form that the backlash took and the flow McDonald Trump but the backlash itself is wildly justified and the left deserves everything they get from all of this meanwhile the left continues to Double Down most Americans are not in favor of illegal immigration most Americans are not cool with illegal immigration we may say that you know people who have illegally immigrated a long time ago and have proved that they just want to be here to work that those people maybe we should provide them a pathway to legalization but the vast majority of people believe that criminal illegal aliens particularly should immediately be imported and people who are living off the public dollar should also be deported because they didn't follow the rules because we do have rules and because any country has the right to uphold its borders and determine who's coming in and who is going out and when those people deserve to be here or not that's not stopping the left from doubling down on their full embrace of illegal immigration rahm emanuel who's the mayor of chicago again a city where i am presumably banned from speaking on campus enforced by local law enforcement under the control i guess of chicago pd or with in association with Chicago PD that's bad but ROM manual says you'll definitely make sure that we never arrest anybody who's an illegal immigrant here's Rahm Emanuel former chief of staff to President Obama and now mayor of Chicago important for families that are anxious it is important for children and adolescents that are unsure because of Tuesday to understand that the city of Chicago is your home you are always welcome in this city always to be clear about what Chicago is it always will be a sanctuary city to all those who are after Tuesday's election very nervous there's filled with anxiety has been spoken to you are safe in Chicago okay so you're safe in Chicago the local law enforcement will not cooperate with the feds and he's not the only one saying this the LAPD Chief Charlie back he said that they're not going to cooperate with the feds either with regards to deportation and immigration councilman from Boston said the same thing here's this this councilman from Boston saying the same routine Trump's hardline is causing some sanctuary cities to push back and reaffirm their status Boston is a sanctuary city city councilor Tito Jackson is worried that undocumented residents will be afraid to go to the police for help or even send their kids to school of the police department if you call them and you need help they will help you and they're not going to turn you in to the feds mayor Walsh is also staying the course saying in a statement we are a welcoming City for all these are Boston values and no policy will change them okay so they're saying that they're not gonna change policy there either and this is not a big surprise I mean Democrats are wedded to illegal immigration they hope to eventually give a lot of the illegal immigrants the right to vote and then they can change the demographic the voting population in the country that's the goal here by the way when people say pathway to legalization that does not mean pathway to voting you can give somebody legal status my wife had legal status in the United States for many many years she had a green card but she wasn't actually given citizenship until I think it's five years ago six years ago so yeah that you can have there are lots of millions people living in the United States legally we don't have the right to vote so it is worthwhile making that distinction but what what all these folks are saying is we're not going to help out the feds now I think that it is worthwhile noting that the left now is in love with federalism the left now loves federalism and so it used to be I'm old enough to remember when the state of Arizona under Jan Brewer Governor Jan Brewer they were in favor of what they called Senate bill 1070 and Senate bill 1070 said to the feds okay look when we arrest people we're going to take down their legal immigration data and then we're going to hand them over to federal law enforcement and Barack Obama sued the state of Arizona saying stop enforcing federal law it's our job not to enforce federal law that's a federalism was bad from Barack Obama's perspective federalism is constantly bad from President Obama's perspective he said this about gay marriage he said it's about abortion we have these hot spots we look terrible its hodgepodge of all well when it comes to Republicans now dominating the federal government then all of a sudden federalism is back in style and this of course is why federalism is a wonderful thing let's shake ah go try and do what Chicago's trying to do and yes the local law enforcement has no obligation to enforce federal immigration law they don't mean the federal government has the obligation to enforce federal law the federal government can attach strings to the to the city for not enforcing federal law that they can they can sit in the city we're going to cut off your subsidies if you don't enforce federal law but federalism is a wonderful thing I just find it hilarious that the left is suddenly in love with federalism again after spending an enormous amount of time saying that federalism is the end of the world and the worst thing that ever happened to anybody that I do find amusing and and kind of incredible so they will continue to push forward though with this radical left agenda I don't know if they assume that they're just gonna come back next time and sweep to victory because people were asleep during this election cycle on their side or what do they think to do demographics are moving in their favor but they're clearly doubling down on everything that they already think about how elections work there clearly are doubling down on everything they already think about politics which is a pretty amazing we'll take a quick break and say hello to our friends over birch school by the way if you're worried about what the economy is

part of your assets in precious metals ok president obama - he - is doubling down the doubling down never stops with President Obama again the nice thing about Obama being a textbook narcissist one of the wonderful things about him being a textbook narcissist is he has never done anything wrong ever so he was asked yesterday by NBC's Chris Jansing about whether he kills any responsibility at all for the election of Donald Trump and clearly he should write clearly he should I mean the fact is that Donald Trump was a direct response to Barack Obama in a thousand ways everything from political celebrity to political celebrity everything from race-baiting to anti race baiting on part of white folks the idea that Obama was saying that all the white folks in America were implicitly biased or Hillary said that and then Trump said you you don't have to feel like a racist just as you oppose Obama the fact that Obama ignored the concerns of so many members of the population by running roughshod over them and hanging with celebrities and here comes Trump who clearly doesn't give a crap about other celebrities very much in a thousand ways all of this is in response to Obama ISM Obama's asset he bears responsibility and as you can imagine his answer no not the slightest and you answered talk to me if he wins about how responsible I feel about it I wonder do you feel any responsibility for the election of Donald Trump well first of all I think it's fair to say that I was surprised by the election results and I've said something I still don't feel responsible for what the president-elect says or does but I do feel a responsibility as president United States to make sure that I facilitate a good transition and I present to him as well as the American people my best thinking my best ideas about how you move the country forward to speak out with respect to areas where I think the Republican Party is wrong but to pledged to work with them on those things that I think will advance the causes of security and prosperity in the question do you feel any responsibility for Trump 8:11 well I feel the responsibility and keep doing exactly what I'm doing I mean that was not a question of course he hasn't feel responsibility he's a pathological narcissist he's never done anything wrong that's why every time he's asked a question about why the American people don't like one or another of his policies is immediate response to all of that very clearly is I don't care what the American people have to say if only I had spoken more clearly to them if only they were wise enough to understand little me everything would have been fine Obama did try to give his explanation of what happened in this election he said people are obviously disaffected but he doesn't explain why they're disaffected in this situation we're turning over a country that has challenges has problems and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected otherwise we wouldn't have had the results that we had in the election on the other hand if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now the unemployment rate is as low as it's been in eight nine years incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two we got historically low on in short rates the financial systems are stabled the stock market is hovering around its all-time high and 401ks have been restored the housing market has recovered we have challenges internationally but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL we're seeing significant progress again they ask him remember the question here was what exactly do you think happened here and his answer was people are disaffected and then he gives an entire list of what a wonderful job he does so the answer really is according to President Obama because the people are morons the people are stupid right if they only understood how grand and glorious Obama has been if only he had let's say a compliant media to repeat 24/7 a wonderful Obama is well if only he had a bunch of Hollywood celebrities to talk about constantly what a wonderful man he is or if only he had the UN to talk about how wonderful is Ramon Lee won a Nobel Prize oh wait he had all of those things and he's still lost yeah maybe because people are disaffected for a reason it's this sort of blindness that leads to the catastrophic electoral losses again Obama's narcissism led them down the primrose path here Obama insisted at the Obama coalition which which kept alienating lower class lower lower income white voters the the the same coalition that alienated a bunch of people in the middle of the country who were sick of watching Obama hobnob with Jimmy Fallon he keeps saying those people are just dumb that's all it comes down to those people are just stupid and that sort of scoring for the voter is not going to is not going to work in any real way now he did say one thing that I thought was was true now I have to give Obama credit when it comes to the transition to trump he's actually done a good job he's actually staying out of the way for the most part he's not throwing too many I would like to see Donal I would like to see President Obama condemned the rioting and protesting that's occurring because Trump was elected but aside from that you have to acknowledge that he's doing a good job with the transition he's told a lot of lies however about why this happened in the first place but I think he did tell one truth and it's kind of an important truth and speaks to where the Republican Party goes from here is President Obama talking about what he thinks of Trump ideologically what he thinks wouldn't philosophically says the Trump isn't really a conservative he's a pragmatist I don't think he is ideological I think ultimately is he's pragmatic in that way and that can serve him well as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction okay so he says that he's a pragmatist he's not an ideologue I think that that is basically right I think that the Donald Trump considers himself a pragmatist just the guy who's gonna get stuff done now in American politics there's a really unfortunate tendency to buy into this kind of ball and it is bull when people say that they are just fragments that they just look at the facts in front of them and they make a decision about the best policy that is never true that is never true because how you see the facts is shaped by your worldview if you see man is inherently good that's gonna change how you see the fact if you see man is is capable of both good and evil that changes the fact if you see freedom as inherently dangerous that changes how you look at facts if you see freedom is the highest purpose of mankind then that change is high see the facts ideology philosophy matters what we talk about every day here on the program I don't think that that Trump really has a core philosophy or a core belief system and that tends toward bigger government it tends toward more executive power attendance weren't the idea that all policy can be decided just by the great god kings of wisdom who sit on high and rule us and I think that there is some truth to that about Trump if you look at the people historically in America I love call themselves pragmatists Woodrow Wilson was probably the first president to call himself openly a pragmatist he said I am a pragmatist I'm an expert my job is to get the experts in a position to make great decisions to help you the people and of course he ended up exponentially growing government because either the experts are capable of running your life or you are capable of running or but not both and he thinks that you know what er Wilson thought the experts were capable Barack Obama coming into office he kept describing himself as a pragmatist but it turns out that in order to be a governmental pragmatist you actually have to believe deep down the government has the power to change things for the better enormous look if you believe that that's what makes you a pragmatist with the government because if you're a pragmatist of conservative bet you say okay I think the government kind of sucks at everything like for example I think that it's pragmatic to talk about drug legalization because the government sucks at the war on drugs they're really quite terrible at it okay that's it that's a pragmatist philosophy but it's not pragmatism driving that it's a basic idea that the government is bad at things you give me pragmatist on the other side and say well the government obviously isn't doing enough on the drug war so we need to pour money into it every set of facts is going to be viewed differently based on what your worldview is your worldview is going to help dictate how you see any particular set of facts and the fact that people who call themselves a tests are rarely conservatives people who say that as a practical thing I'm going to leave the government then I'm gonna do what's good for America that never ends well and I do think that that President Obama is largely correct about Donald Trump on this he's gonna be an ad hoc policy guy I'm hoping he's surrounding himself with some of the right people we'll go through some good Trump bad Trump in a minute talk about some of disappointments some of them are quite good some of them are a little more questionable and we'll get to all of that in just a minute but to do that you have to go over to Daley wire.com because we have to end over at
