1
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:03,445
DEFEAT.

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:04,180
YOU LATER DECIDE.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,947
FIVE WEEKS FROM TONIGHT.

4
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:06,982
TRAINING IS NOW LINDSEY GRAHAM.

5
00:00:06,982 --> 00:00:08,684
YOU'VE BEEN GIVING US UPDATES

6
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:11,954
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, WHAT'S

7
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:12,388
THE LATEST?

8
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:13,856
>> THE KAVANAUGH BUMP IS REAL.

9
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:18,661
THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN THE 2018

10
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,396
MIDTERMS.

11
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,197
IN NORTH DAKOTA HE SHOULD BE

12
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:22,031
CONFIRMED.

13
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,466
EVERY -- THERE'S BEEN ASSERTED

14
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:27,603
BY REPUBLICANS, WHY?

15
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,371
WHETHER YOU ARE A TRUMP

16
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,208
REPUBLICAN, LIBERTARIAN,

17
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,542
VEGETARIAN, McCAIN REPUBLICAN,

18
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:34,143
ROMNEY REPUBLICAN, BUSH

19
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:37,246
REPUBLICAN, YOU ARE MAD AS HELL

20
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,347
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL UNITED THAT

21
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:39,115
THIS IS UNFAIR WHAT THEY ARE

22
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:45,187
DOING TO THIS GOOD DECENT MAN.

23
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,189
THE REPUBLICANS HE WILL BE A

24
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:47,857
DEMOCRAT, NOT A REPUBLICAN.

25
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,525
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING

26
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,427
THAT I COULD NEVER DO, UNITE

27
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:51,994
THIS PARTY.

28
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:53,796
>> Sean: THE ANGER IS REAL.

29
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:54,830
>> WHAT TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

30
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,198
SWAY GOOD MEN AND THE ONLY WAY

31
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:58,734
HE STAYS

32
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:59,435
DESTROYED IS IF WE BUY INTO

33
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,371
THIS TRAP.

34
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:05,107
PUTTING HIM ON THE COURT IS THE

35
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,343
ONLY ANTIDOTE.

36
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:08,945
>> Sean: YOU WERE A

37
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:09,579
PROSECUTOR.

38
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,981
WHEN YOU SEE NO CORROBORATION --

39
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:12,648
>> I DON'T PROSECUTE.

40
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,350
>> Sean: YOU DON'T PROSECUTE.

41
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,251
>> THE LAW REQUIRES YOU TO TELL

42
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,819
THE ACCUSED WHERE IT HAPPENED,

43
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:17,687
WHEN IT HAPPENED AND TO HAVE

44
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,555
CORROBORATION THAT IT DID

45
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:19,956
HAPPEN.

46
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:21,958
MY BEEF IS NOT WITH DR. FORD.

47
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:23,693
I THINK SHE'S BEEN USED AND

48
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:24,026
ABUSED.

49
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,795
MY BEEF IS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

50
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,130
PARTY WHO LAID IN WAIT, BETRAYED

51
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,864
HER TRUST, DIDN'T TELL HER WE

52
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,766
WOULD GO TO CALIFORNIA.

53
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,068
MY BEEF IS WITH THE FACT THAT

54
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,003
THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN

55
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:35,705
DO TO DESTROY HIS LIFE.

56
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:36,372
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HE'S A

57
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:41,010
GANG-RAPISTS, A PREDATOR,

58
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,979
STUMBLING DRUNK, HOW ABOUT HE

59
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,746
DOESN'T HAVE THE TEMPERAMENT?

60
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:44,547
THIS IS THE ONE THAT BOTHERS ME

61
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:45,515
THE MOST.

62
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,918
HE APOLOGIZED FOR AMY KLOBUCHAR

63
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:49,852
FOR SNAPPING AT HER.

64
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:51,587
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE

65
00:01:51,587 --> 00:01:53,222
ACCUSED OF ALL THESE THINGS, HAD

66
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,191
HER LIFE RUINED?

67
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,158
HERE'S WHAT I CAN, AMY KLOBUCHAR

68
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,627
SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO JUDGE

69
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,562
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY FOR

70
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:01,798
BEING PART OF A SMEAR CAMPAIGN I

71
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,566
HAVEN'T SEEN IN OVER 20 YEARS IN

72
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,200
POLITICS.

73
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,436
>> Sean: WHAT ABOUT THESE RED

74
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:06,936
STATE DEMOCRATS?

75
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:08,503
>> I THINK THEY ARE TOAST.

76
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,072
>> Sean: ALL OF THEM?

77
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,574
>> ALL OF THEM.

78
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,476
>> Sean: THE ONLY TWO THAT ARE

79
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:14,010
OPEN SEEMINGLY --

80
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,145
>> THEY ARE TOAST IF THEY VOTE

81
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:15,412
NO.

82
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,181
THEY SHOULD BE.

83
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,849
PRESIDENT TRUMP WON THE STATES

84
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,817
PROMISING TO NOMINATE

85
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:21,351
CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.

86
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:22,385
THIS IS A BUSH GUY.

87
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:24,320
HE WORKED FOR THE BUSH

88
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,721
WHITE HOUSE.

89
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,822
HE'S AS MAINSTREAM AS YOU CAN

90
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:26,189
GET.

91
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,390
HE'S BEEN ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT

92
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,193
COURT OF APPEALS FOR 12 YEARS.

93
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:30,994
GLOWING ASSESSMENTS OF HIS

94
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:33,329
CREDIBILITY, HIS INTEGRITY

95
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,164
BEFORE THIS HEARING.

96
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:35,031
IF YOU'RE GOING TO REWARD PEOPLE

97
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:38,168
FOR DESTROYING HIS LIFE BY

98
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,169
QUESTIONING HIS TEMPERAMENT THEN

99
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:41,404
YOU ARE SETTING IN MOTION THE

100
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,105
DESTRUCTION OF THE JUDICIARY.

101
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,640
AT TWO AND A REPUBLICAN WHO

102
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,607
WANTS TO QUESTION KAVANAUGH'S

103
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:45,375
TEMPERAMENT, WHAT YOU'RE DOING

104
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,578
IS THE PEOPLE WERE PUTTING --

105
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:49,779
>> Sean: FIVE WEEKS FROM

106
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,614
TONIGHT THE RESULTS WILL START

107
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,583
FLOWING IN.

108
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,818
IF YOU WENT PRETTY VIABLE, YOUR

109
00:02:54,818 --> 00:02:55,752
COMMENTS ON THIS PROGRAM LAST

110
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:58,922
NIGHT AND YOU SAID THAT IF YOU

111
00:02:58,922 --> 00:03:04,961
FALL ONE VOTE SHORT, THAT THIS

112
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,895
ELECTION FIVE WEEKS FROM TONIGHT

113
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,164
THAT THIS COULD BE A REFERENDUM,

114
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:08,965
THE PRESIDENT COULD RENOMINATE

115
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:09,699
KAVANAUGH WITH THE NEW SENATE

116
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:12,035
AND ENOUGH VOTES FOR TOMEI TO

117
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:12,469
CONFIRM HIM.

118
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:16,172
>> LOOKS LIKE THE PEOPLE DECIDE.

119
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,374
CORKER MADE AN OBSERVATION THAT

120
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,108
WE'VE GOT THE VOTES AND HERE'S

121
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:20,077
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO BOB.

122
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,612
WE HAVE TO WAIT ON THE FBI

123
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:23,113
REPORT.

124
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:23,847
LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS

125
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:25,782
REALLY WANT TO THE FBI TO

126
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:26,883
VALIDATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK.

127
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:28,185
THEY ARE JUST ABOUT DONE.

128
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:31,521
I'M CONFIDENT BOTH OF THEM, IF

129
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,657
THERE IS NO CHANGE, IF THE FBI

130
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,524
LEARNS NOTHING NEW ABOUT THE

131
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,426
ALLEGATION OR LEGITIMACY TO

132
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,162
RAMIREZ, THAT THEY WILL VOTE FOR

133
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:39,863
KAVANAUGH BECAUSE WE'VE DONE

134
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:40,564
EVERYTHING WITHIN REASON AND I

135
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:42,699
HOPE JEFF FLAKE WILL ALSO -- HE

136
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,700
VOTED YES IN COMMITTEE AND NOW

137
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,869
HE'S TALKING ABOUT TEMPERAMENT

138
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,705
AND YEARBOOK ENTRIES.

139
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,941
TO THOSE WHO QUESTIONED THE

140
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,477
YEARBOOK ENTRIES, JUST LISTEN TO

141
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:54,578
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

142
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,580
YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE THIS

143
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,415
MAN'S FATE BASED ON THE YEARBOOK

144
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:58,982
ENTRY.

145
00:03:58,982 --> 00:04:00,217
>> Sean: ICE-THROWING.

146
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:01,618
AT THE SENATOR FROM HAWAII.

147
00:04:01,618 --> 00:04:03,053
>> THE TRIANGLE.

148
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,388
IF YOU HAVE A DOUBT WHAT IT

149
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,889
REALLY MEANS, GO BACK AND TALK

150
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:07,925
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH HIMSELF.

151
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,794
DON'T HUMILIATE THIS MAN.

152
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:12,696
>> Sean: IF THE FBI -- THERE'S

153
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:14,531
ONE REPORT THAT THEY HAVEN'T

154
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,232
TALKED TO DR. FORD.

155
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,401
IS THERE A NEED TO TALK TO HER?

156
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,235
>> THE LAST THING DR. FORD NEEDS

157
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:21,038
IN MY VIEW IS TO GO THROUGH THE

158
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:21,605
RINGER AGAIN.

159
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:22,940
SHE CAME FORWARD TO THE

160
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,607
COMMITTEE, COULDN'T TELL US

161
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,576
ANYTHING IN PERSON.

162
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:26,877
I THINK SOMETHING REALLY DID

163
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:27,945
HAPPEN TO HER, I AM CONVINCED IT

164
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:30,113
WASN'T BRETT KAVANAUGH.

165
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:31,815
IF SHE WAS WRONG ABOUT HER BEST

166
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:33,016
FRIEND BEING AT THE PARTY, WHAT

167
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:35,152
ELSE WAS SHE WRONG ABOUT?

168
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,420
HER BEST FRIEND SAYS I'M NOT

169
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,754
HERE TO REFUTE HER CLAIM, I'M

170
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,156
JUST SAYING I'VE NEVER MET BRETT

171
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:39,590
KAVANAUGH.

172
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,191
HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAD ONE

173
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:43,126
BEER AND YOU CAN'T REMEMBER

174
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:43,927
ANYTHING ELSE?

175
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:45,963
>> Sean: SENATOR, YOU'VE BEEN

176
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:49,132
A FORCE FOR FAIRNESS IN THIS.

177
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:51,101
THIS SHOULDN'T BE REPUBLICAN OR

178
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,468
DEMOCRAT.

179
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,171
>> IT SURE IS NOW.

180
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:56,006
IF YOU DON'T GET WHAT THEY ARE

181
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:56,340
DOING --

182
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,175
>> Sean: YOU VOTED FOR BOTH OF

183
00:04:58,175 --> 00:00:00,000
OBAMA'S NOMINEES.
