1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:02,827
- Yeah, ooh, this make
my teeth look white.

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:03,892
Oh!

3
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:05,967
My teeth are not that white, girl.

4
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:07,061
Okay.

5
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:08,233
Hey YouTube world, it's me, Evelyn.

6
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,466
Just wanted to pop in, you know.

7
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:13,900
I just want to share with
you my experience recently,

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,402
speaking at a university.

9
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:19,658
I am from the internets, as you know,

10
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,892
and one of my goals in 2018,

11
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:26,700
although I haven't made
a 2018 goals video,

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,910
you know on this channel
I post my yearly goals

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,611
and I've done that for
the past couple years,

14
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,877
I didn't do that this year.

15
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:35,570
Cause my only goal was to quit
my job girl,and I did that.

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,091
In the spring, I had been
invited to, and paid,

17
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:41,091
Compensated!

18
00:00:41,934 --> 00:00:42,767
My god!

19
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:46,230
To speak on a panel
during South by Southwest,

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:48,586
and it was such a dope experience.

21
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:53,266
After that experience, I
posted on Instagram like,

22
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:56,406
"Hey I wanna get into public speaking."

23
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,705
I have things I wanna
share with the world.

24
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:00,713
I have words that I would like to say.

25
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,884
And I do think that I
am one of those people

26
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:05,717
from the internets who
is also good in person

27
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,331
because that's not always the case,

28
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,164
you know what I'm saying?

29
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:08,997
That's not always the case.

30
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:12,302
And I enjoy doing so, I
enjoy being on a stage.

31
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,668
What?

32
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:14,981
I tell people about it,

33
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:17,083
not necessarily asking for help,

34
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,451
but just letting it be
known that this is a thing

35
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:21,169
that I'm going for, you
know what I'm saying?

36
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:23,538
On some Oprah super soul
Sunday, you feel me?

37
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:27,299
You let your intentions
be known, and the universe

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,145
do its thing supposedly.

39
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,479
So shout out to Jouelz
y, she put me in touch

40
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,557
with a speaking agency and she was like

41
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:36,803
"Take it from here", you
know what I'm saying.

42
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:40,616
And she's a very good resource person?

43
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,949
I'm not very good at knowing

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,717
how, and who to ask for help.

45
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:48,528
How to connect those dots.

46
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:51,768
And Jouelzy is just a master connector.

47
00:01:51,768 --> 00:01:53,993
Of being like bleep bloop
bloop bloop bloop bloop.

48
00:01:53,993 --> 00:01:56,783
I feel like I need to say
that cause in this industry,

49
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,664
whether you consider it Hollywood,

50
00:01:58,664 --> 00:02:00,173
whether you consider it communications,

51
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:03,393
in journalism--my original background,

52
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:06,725
everything is reference based.

53
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,058
What is a resume, sis?

54
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:11,195
It's this person referring you to this ...

55
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,414
It's word of mouth.

56
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:16,024
So I really appreciate Jouelzy
putting me on in that way.

57
00:02:16,024 --> 00:02:17,336
And shout out to myself,

58
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:20,993
for not just letting that
resource die, you know?

59
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:23,246
A lot of the times
people give us something

60
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:24,105
to try and help us out

61
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:26,938
and we just let it slip
beneath our fingers

62
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,168
but I didn't, you know.

63
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,130
I contacted them, I was like listen,

64
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,319
"We finna do this?"

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,055
And they're like, "We can do this."

66
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:35,355
And I was like, "Okay!"

67
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,805
So that leads us to a couple days ago,

68
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,045
this is very recent we're
at the end of the year,

69
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,243
you know what I'm saying,
it's been a journey.

70
00:02:42,243 --> 00:02:43,076
(laughs)

71
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:46,871
But I just got back
recently from Gambier, Ohio,

72
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:49,982
where I was invited to speak to BSU,

73
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:52,920
the Black Student Union at Kenyon College.

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,497
So I'm gonna toss in a cute little vlog.

75
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,580
I vlogged it.

76
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,244
(r&b music)

77
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:08,362
(r&b music)

78
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,558
(airplane seatbelt ding)

79
00:03:16,558 --> 00:03:18,798
(r&b music)

80
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,122
So we out here,
(laughing)

81
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:22,024
She gotta keep her eyes on the road!

82
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:23,498
- [Michaela] I gotta make sure we live.

83
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:25,762
- Michaela picked me up from the airport.

84
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:30,762
We are in Columbus, Ohio, but
that's not where we're going.

85
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:31,927
- [Michaela] Nope.

86
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,177
- Where we goin?

87
00:03:33,177 --> 00:03:35,073
- Gambier, Ohio.

88
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:38,562
- Gambier, Ohio is technically a village.

89
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,547
- [Michaela] Mhm.

90
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:42,821
And, she said she gon' let me know

91
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,905
when it look like we're
driving through Klan country.

92
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,372
(laughing)

93
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,928
But you know what?

94
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,624
Anything to reach my
people, the youths, okay?

95
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,874
(laughing)

96
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,509
- [Evelyn] That was a trash shot

97
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,342
- [Michaela] Dead

98
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:58,808
- [Evelyn] But ya know, still I rise.

99
00:03:58,808 --> 00:03:59,713
- [Michaela] I was about to say,

100
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,269
you might be able to catch
somethin' else later.

101
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:02,976
- [Evelyn] So we have survived

102
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,856
the Jeepers Creepers part of the trip.

103
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,342
- Yes, we've made it through.

104
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:10,000
- [Evelyn] But you know,
have we made it to safety?

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,833
Listen.

106
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,333
- [Michaela] It is, very rural.

107
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:15,735
- We out here in the woods.

108
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:19,369
So like I have heard
people say "in the styx"

109
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:20,634
- [Michaela] This is the styx.

110
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:21,620
- Styx.

111
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,454
- [Michaela] Styx.

112
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:23,287
- Wow

113
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:25,394
- [Michaela] There used to be
leaves, now it's just sticks.

114
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:27,484
- Now it's just sticks (laughter)

115
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,806
(r&b music)

116
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:30,828
- [Evelyn] Leaves.

117
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,256
(laughter)

118
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:33,089
(crunching leaves)

119
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:36,628
- [Michaela] They not
on the trees anymore.

120
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,247
- [Evelyn] We ain't got leaves.

121
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:39,849
- [Michaela] Y'all ain't
got leaves in Austin?

122
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:41,034
- [Evelyn] We ain't got leaves like this.

123
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:41,974
- [Michaela] Wow you are

124
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:43,599
- Hold up, she say, the president,

125
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,933
- (laughing) Our president is black

126
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:46,766
- Is black?

127
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:47,930
- That's what he is
- Wow

128
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,529
We're on the set of Gilmore
Girls, as you cans see,

129
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:55,137
Kenyon College, Gambier Ohio.

130
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:57,470
(R&B music)

131
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:04,837
So I have about

132
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:06,911
an hour,

133
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:10,207
to shower, get ready.

134
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:16,498
Of course we are wearing,
magical black girl.

135
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:18,331
Let's talk toiletries,

136
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,371
castile soap,

137
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,208
to warsh my body.

138
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,811
Y'all seen them Dexter's Lab memes.

139
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:28,514
That was like "Oh my god, I
love your southern accent.

140
00:05:28,514 --> 00:05:29,710
"Say it again.

141
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,881
"Warsh rag" (laughing)

142
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,714
I got this hand cream,

143
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:39,474
that I'm going to use
as lotion, on my body.

144
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:40,474
Deodorant...

145
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:45,291
Gonna brush my teeth, y'all
know what toothpaste look like.

146
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,843
Body butter, Black Girl Beauty brand.

147
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:49,900
Ay Bay Bay!

148
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,003
And a bunch of other stuff

149
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,545
that I don't feel like
going through right now.

150
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:57,260
Because I am not a beauty guru, yet.

151
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,093
Okay?

152
00:05:58,093 --> 00:05:59,919
Let's hop in the shower.

153
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,252
(r&b music)

154
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,026
- Now tonight, on this Monday night,

155
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:09,463
I know it's cold, so I appreciate it.

156
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:12,481
But we're so excited and grateful to have

157
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,315
Evelyn from the Internets here tonight.

158
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:16,092
She came all the way from Texas,

159
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,100
where apparently they don't have leaves.

160
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,271
(laughter)

161
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,990
(r&b music)

162
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,823
- Hey!

163
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:25,409
- So I'm back,

164
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:27,884
at the hotel.

165
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,644
I did it, I spoke, I spoke.

166
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:34,789
I did the thing.

167
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,228
About my two pieces of advice that will

168
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:41,071
help you go very far in your
life, especially as a creative.

169
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:44,100
And then Q & A,

170
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,365
super cute.

171
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,933
I thought it went well,

172
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,104
it was very informal, very casual.

173
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,268
I'm going to wash,

174
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:54,827
warsh, I'm gonna warsh my face

175
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:59,827
(laugh) and pack up, I just
brought a backpack sis.

176
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,303
Then I'm going to edit,
because I have a deadline

177
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:05,136
coming up.

178
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,506
Boop.

179
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,205
I totally didn't edit last night.

180
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,622
So, there's that.

181
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,307
(sigh)

182
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,822
(laugh)

183
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,283
Good morning, I wanted to, before I left,

184
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:32,055
I wanted to step outside
and show you Kenyon College.

185
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:35,120
- [Evelyn] Leaves! (laughing)

186
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,616
This is the College Relations Center.

187
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:39,684
Wow,

188
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:40,767
it's a house,

189
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:42,943
wow.

190
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,306
These

191
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:47,977
are all school buildings.

192
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:48,810
(r&b music)

193
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,618
Ooh! Ooh! Oop!

194
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,540
So that was my little vlog,

195
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,056
my little speaking gig vlog (laugh)

196
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:05,064
Shout out to the students
at Kenyon College,

197
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,330
the Black Student Union,

198
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,431
thank you so much for inviting me out.

199
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:09,859
It's wild to see all the different

200
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:12,251
types of college experiences there are,

201
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,467
and how we still manage to
connect with each other.

202
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,104
I went to the University of Texas.

203
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:21,098
50,000 students, they have
less than 2,000 students.

204
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:25,068
My high school was bigger
than their whole college.

205
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,334
We are everywhere!

206
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,193
Amen?

207
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,770
I just wanted to come on,
and share that experience,

208
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,603
accomplishment.

209
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,150
If you would like me
to come to your school,

210
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,044
I am...

211
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,856
More than likely down.

212
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:36,365
I would like that.

213
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,883
I will put all that information
in the video description

214
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:44,094
box. I can talk about: Women
in Media, Black people in

215
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:48,021
Media. You know what I am saying?

216
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,414
Wakanda forever.

217
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:52,195
We can figure something out girl.

218
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,350
Storytelling,

219
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,407
Finding your Voice,

220
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,962
Working in Social Media.

221
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:58,101
And you know, you don't
have to be - you feel me?

222
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,123
a Magical Black Girl

223
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,665
to value this Magical Black Girl!

224
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,498
Amen?

225
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:04,428
Whoever you are,
information will be in the

226
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:07,273
video description box, and
hopefully we can connect.

227
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:08,921
Thank you for watching my videos,

228
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,965
and making it possible for anyone to

229
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:13,436
care to throw me on a panel,

230
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,872
or to give me the opportunity to speak.

231
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:18,619
Thanks so much for continuing to watch,

232
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,256
I feel hella old sometimes,

233
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:23,784
but you know, we out here

234
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:25,293
glistening.

235
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:26,126
Okay?

236
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:28,683
I will definitely see you
on the internet, somewhere.

237
00:09:28,683 --> 00:09:32,236
But, hopefully I will see
you off the internet too.

238
00:09:32,236 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye
