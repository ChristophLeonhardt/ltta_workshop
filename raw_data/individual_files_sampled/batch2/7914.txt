the New York Times did an analysis of ethnic representation in college campuses now this is a big topic because of the fact that the Justice Department is going after universities that still implement affirmative action and so with affirmative action in place on some college campuses do minorities still or ever have any type of equal representation and this analysis found out that no no they don't alright so here's what they found black students make up 9% of the freshman at Ivy League schools but 15% of college-age Americans roughly the same gap as in 1980 so for those who make these arguments that black students just get in willy-nilly simply because they're black that's not really what happens in fact even when it comes to schools that do still implement affirmative action what they do is utilize race as a final decision-maker if there are candidates that are highly competitive and it's really hard to differentiate between them right so it's not like they only look at race they look at a litany of things and then in the end if someone comes from an underprivileged background and race has something to do with that well that might give a particular applicant a little bit of an edge yeah I definitely come at this from a little different perspective not completely different but significantly different so so first of all day another way to look at this is well we've been doing it for 35 years and it still hasn't helped so it's it was if it was meant to catch up minorities to the percentage of their in their population it didn't work and so we get on the war on drugs for not working the Cuban embargo for not working and how long were you keep doing something that isn't working so and and the reason it isn't working is not because of any of the right-wing positions it's because we're not addressing the root causes but it's time they get to college if you grew up in a in a socio-economic background that's disadvantageous it's too late you already went through two bad schools that didn't let you take it there weren't enough books to take home and and the list goes on and on and so it's it's addressing the symptom rather than the cause and and and I know why it happened in the first place and I know that affirmative action was right in the first place otherwise there would have been no opportunity to break in okay now having said that it's gone on too long then the second part of it is that it creates a stigma even though you're right Anna that is one of many many factors and the courts have actually adjudicated that it can't be a sole factor or anything along those lines people assume it's the sole factor yeah I know this is the argument that you make that that convinces me the least I think it's like the weakest argument you make because I don't care what people assume I know I don't care look the people who lack on to the hatred toward black students and they say oh the only reason why they got in was because of affirmative action they're gonna hate on those students anyway so I don't want to use that or or their feelings or emotions as some sort of factor that's gonna convince me otherwise right I want to make sure that fair is fair your argument about inequality beginning at grade school is a great argument and you're right this affirmative action does try to put a bandaid on a gushing wound and that gushy wound is the inequality with the public school districts throughout the country the way that they're funded many school districts are funded through property taxes so think about that for a second if you're living in a poor neighborhood where property values are low property taxes will be low and so funding for the schools in those areas are obviously gonna be low and so you there is no equal footing that's something that absolutely needs to be addressed now let me give you a few more stats that this analysis found in Mississippi Louisiana Georgia and South Carolina blacks represent about a third or more of each state's college-age population but less than 15% of the freshman enrollment at the flagship university the number of Hispanic and black freshmen on the University of California campuses declined immediately after California's affirmative action ban took effect in 1999 so in some cases affirmative action actually did help kind of equalize things among races on college campuses California would be an example of that once they got rid of affirmative action that you saw the enrollment of black students and Hispanic students go down considerably we've got to give you really important context on that because the only group that went down more was whites so wait blacks and Latinos went down so did whites their enrollment it's because Asians went up tremendously once you took away affirmative action that's right and so in even so share white students said many of these top schools according to this findings in some cases the share of white students fell below 50% and so they give one example here Bryce University in Houston which amazingly was actually exclusively white until the mid 1960s but now the white percentage is declined over all the way down to 42 percent in 2015 from when it was 87 percent in 1980 meanwhile the share of Asian students even in the middle of Houston rose to 30 percent in 2015 from just three percent in 1980 so white folks be careful what you wish for you take away affirmative action and the share of whites go way down okay and so look I think you take away affirmative action or much better make it based on socioeconomic grounds and take away legacies yes that's the fair way to do it don't just punish the the needy and the poor and give all the advantages to the privileged that and let legacy admissions into college that's obviously fundamentally unfair help us build independent media together TYT Network comm /join
