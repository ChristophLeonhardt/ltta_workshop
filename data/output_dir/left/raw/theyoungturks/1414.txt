1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,570
THE CALIFORNIA JUDGE WHO OFFERED
OR HANDED DOWN A LENIENT

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,359
SENTENCE TO BROCK TURNER
AFTER HE WAS CONVICTED OF

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,740
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A WOMAN HAS
BEEN RECALLED.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,940
THIS IS GREAT NEWS.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,150
IT IS JUDGE AARON PERSKY.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,449
THIS CASE HAD EVERYTHING TO
DO WITH A YOUNG COLLEGE

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,980
STUDENT WHO WAS CUT SEXUALLY
ASSAULTING AN UNCONSCIOUS

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,539
WOMAN BEHIND A DUMPSTER.

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,060
HE WAS INCREDIBLY DRUNK, BUT
KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS THE

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,450
FIRST CALIFORNIA JUDGE RECALLED
IN NEARLY 90 YEARS.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:50,840
PEOPLE WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT
THIS CASE, AND THE SENTENCE.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
TO

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,150
MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE LOAD OF
WHAT THE JUDGE CITED IN THIS

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,700
RULING.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:13,710
I FEEL LIKE SOME PEOPLE STILL
DON'T GET THIS CASE.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,060
IS A DISPARITY AND TREATMENT.

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,220
HOW OFTEN ARE JUDGES GOING
AROUND GOING THIS YOUNG BLACK

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,740
KID, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW IT
COULD IMPACT HIS LIFE.

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:32,499
THAT IS A VERY POOR CHOICE OF
WORDS, BUT PUT ASIDE THE

20
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:36,319
BAD CHOICE OF WORDS AND THINK
ABOUT THE CONCEPT.

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:46,602
ANYTHING COULD BE CONSIDERED 20
MINUTES OF ACTION.

22
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:49,430
IT WASN'T 20 MINUTES OF
ACTION, IT WAS 20 MINUTES OF

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,520
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,859
JUNTA DUMPSTER.

25
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:57,500
YOU LOOK AT A YOUNG
AFRICAN-AMERICAN KID WHO MIGHT

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,650
BE DRUNK OR HIGH AND YOU SAY PUT
HIM AWAY, THAT IS HOW THEY ARE.

27
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:10,788
YOU LOOK AT A YOUNG RICH, WHITE
KID AND THEY SAY HE WAS DRUNK.

28
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,870
YOU SEE THE DISPARITY?

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,319
THAT WAS
THE CONCERN HERE.

30
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,960
I KNOW SOME FOLKS ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THIS RECALL BECAUSE THEY

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,349
ARE WORRIED THAT IT WILL LEAD
JUDGES TO BE TOUGHER ON

32
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,349
EVERYBODY.

33
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,099
AT THAT IS A LESSON THEY GET THE
NEW SHOULD RECALL ALL OF THEM.

34
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,000
IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU ARE
INSUFFICIENTLY TOUGH ON ALL

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,640
CRIMINALS, IT IS YOUR JOB TO
JUDGE AND MAKE JUDGMENT CALLS.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,439
WAS IT A SERIOUS CRIME LIKE
SEXUAL ASSAULT OR WAS IT SMOKING

37
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,049
A JOINT WHICH IS NOT SERIOUS.

38
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,430
PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT IT BASED
ON INCOME DISPARITIES.

39
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:59,489
SO A JUDGE RELATES TO A RICH KID
WHO WAS GOING TO A GOOD SCHOOL.

40
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:07,450
THESE ARE MOST OF THE TIME Ã± I
DON'T KNOW THAT THIS JUDGE IS

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,900
EVIL AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE
THOUGHT I WILL GET THE

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,490
WHITE KID OFF.

43
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,019
IT IS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.

44
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,180
HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY
CONSCIOUSLY THINK OF IT.

45
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,610
I THINK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL.

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,420
WE DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY.

47
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,680
BUT I DO FEEL THAT THERE IS A
MIX OF THOSE WHO HAVE

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,719
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND THOSE WHO
KNOW THEY HAVE THESE BIASES.

49
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,200
NOW IN THE TRUMP ERA FEEL
EMBOLDENED TO SHARE WITH THOSE

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,450
BIASES ARE.

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,480
NOW THEY ARE WORRIED THAT
JUDGES ARE GOING TO BE TOUGHER

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
BECAUSE OF THIS.

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,550
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT I HAVE
SEEN A LOT OF ARTICLES ABOUT IT.

54
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,140
THIS IS BASED OFF OF A GUY
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,579
SENTENCED MORE THAN HE WAS.

56
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,629
YOU THINK PEOPLE LIKE THIS
SHOULD NOT BE SENTENCED BECAUSE

57
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:56,749
OF WHO THEY ARE?

58
00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:03,120
THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE
JUDICIAL SYSTEM, SUPPORTING

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,430
A CORRUPT AND UNEVEN FOUNDATION
TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

60
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,499
YOU ONLY THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,280
SO THIS WILL BE TOO TOUGH ON
PEOPLE.

62
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,249
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT MATTER TO
YOU APPARENTLY ARE PEOPLE

63
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,249
LIKE THIS GUY.

64
00:04:14,249 --> 00:04:20,238
I THINK SOME GOOD PEOPLE
MIGHT BE THINKING THAT THEY WILL

65
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,340
BE EVEN TOUGHER ON CRIMINALS AND
THEN GET TOUGHER ON

66
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,360
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,190
AGAIN POOR PEOPLE THAT THEY
DON'T HAVE EMPATHY FOR.

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,300
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IF
THEY DO THAT, THEN THEY ARE

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,190
TERRIBLE JUDGES AND REALLY
SHOULD BE RECALLED.

70
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,050
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS AND THE
LESSON YOU GET FROM THIS IS I

71
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,699
NEED TO BE TOUGHER ON BLACKS

72
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,850
OR ON POOR PEOPLE THEN YOU ARE
UNFIT TO BE A JUDGE BECAUSE

73
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,050
YOU ARE VERY DENSE.

74
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,990
I THINK PEOPLE THAT BRING
UP THAT POINT HAVE THEIR

75
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,850
HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

76
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,289
WHEN IT COMES TO THE STORY, IT
WASN'T JUST ABOUT THE SENTENCE

77
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,810
HE HANDED DOWN TO BROCK TURNER,
AT THE TIME THERE WAS EXTENSIVE

78
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,960
ANALYSIS IN PREVIOUS SENTENCES
THAT HE GAVE TO PEOPLE OF COLOR.

79
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,660
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HE IS BEING
TOO LENIENT.

80
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,550
THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HIM
BEING INCREDIBLY LENIENT TO A

81
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,400
MAN THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT
SEXUALLY HARASSING AN

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,650
UNCONSCIOUS WOMAN.

83
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,050
HE ONLY SERVED THREE MONTHS
BEHIND BARS.

84
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,340
COUNTLESS PEOPLE HAVE SPENT WAY
MORE TIME BEHIND BARS FOR

85
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,030
NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES.

86
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,410
THIS HAD EVERYTHING TO DO ABOUT
THAT, NOT ABOUT BEING TOO

87
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,520
LENIENT OVERALL.

88
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,440
WHETHER HIS BIAS WAS CONSCIOUS
OR UNCONSCIOUS, IT WAS PREVALENT

89
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,690
AND CLEAR.

90
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,850
AND SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO SERVE
JUSTICE, YOU HAVE TO DO IT EVEN

91
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,199
HANDEDLY AND IF PEOPLE TAKE
AWAY, JUDGES BETTER BE CAREFUL,

92
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,129
1.3 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED A
DISPOSITION AND PEOPLE ARE

93
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:05,190
WATCHING TO SEE IF THEY ARE
GOING TO BE UNJUST, GOOD, THAT

94
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,110
IS A PRETTY GOOD LESSON TO
LEARN.

95
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,889
IT YOU ONLY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS
THAT YOU SHOULD BE REALLY

96
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,729
HARSH AT ALL CRIMINALS NO MATTER
WHAT, THAT IS THE LESSON

97
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,960
YOU WANTED TO HEAR ANYWAY
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT THE

98
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,009
LESSON THAT PEOPLE WANTED TO
GIVE, THEY WANTED TO TALK

99
00:06:20,009 --> 00:00:00,000
ABOUT JUSTICE AND THAT IS WHAT
THAT IS ABOUT.
