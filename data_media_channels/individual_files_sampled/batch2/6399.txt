a 22 year old black man by the name of Anthony wall has been charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct following prom night where he took his sister to the prom as her date and then later they ended up at a Waffle House where apparently they got into some sort of verbal altercation with some people at the restaurants and then police were called now when the cops showed up it's unclear how or why it escalated to what you're about to see but what you're about to see is difficult to watch take a look at the police officer handling the situation and actually escalating it far further than it needed to take a look so luckily this didn't end with someone dying which unfortunately oftentimes is the case with police brutality stories but Anthony wall told the press W T V D that he was pretty much trying to scream for air and trying to breathe because he was holding my throat which you could clearly see in that video and that's when I got aggressive with him because you are choking me wall said now he said he wasn't resisting arrest he had his his hands up and he was trying to get him to stop grabbing his throat look I I want to show you a photo and I believe we have this picture showing the police department now this is in North Carolina and the police department had a group photo where you can see how big this cop is and he's giant like he's towering over all the other police officials and we're talking about a pretty thin 22 year old guy who's being handled this way it's just a necessary now the police department this is the Warsaw police chief he says we're currently investigating the whole incident interviewing witnesses and gathering additional video we have also reached out to the district attorney's office to make him aware of the investigation once the investigation is complete and the district attorney has had a chance to review the case we will provide the public with an update on the findings yeah so you're at Ana he's 22 so he's wearing a tuxedo this reminds me of the story just from earlier this week of the woman who was at Yale and she's sleeping in the common area because she's working all night on a paper she's a graduate student there and she has a cops called on her what what do you have to do right because a lot of times people say well if you're wearing a nice suit I've said this in the past like like put on a nice jacket and you can go into almost anywhere if you're not black or a minority right so now I can I'm a minority I'm brown but but it's but they I don't get that discrimination I just don't so that's my privilege okay but if you're black you can go to Yale it doesn't help you you can have a tuxedo on it doesn't help you so this can you not see the frustration of minorities in this country as they say what do I need to do I mean you said do this I did it you said do that I did it and I still get choked out on a Waffle House so now this is the second Waffle House incident if you remember there was a young woman 25 year old and and but in both cases and were the cops threw her to the ground her tube top fell off so her breasts were exposed and she was manhandled etc so both instances an employee calls the cops and says they're bothering me you got to get them out what was the earlier one about she had asked for a plastic utensils and they wanted to charge her 50 cents which I've never heard of and so she was like really it's just a plastic fork a gut said cops get her out of here right so now here's the thing and in the Yale case I said it's to me the cops we did not do any of this stuff in Yale right and they were put in a little bit of a tough situation but when you're the cops and you come in whether in both of the Waffle House cases including this one when you get their key try to deescalate something for the first time in your life why everything has to end with choking up against the wall being slammed down etc can you just come in and go hey I get it you guys were having a fight right and and it's by the way it wasn't even a physical fight it's just verbal they were disagreeing hey guys let's go let's walk outside and you tell me what the employee did that you think was wrong and the employee I'll talk to you later etc and let's just straighten this out no our police are trained be vicious first be vicious second be vicious third so if Ennis and you got a minority they could be dangerous they could be dangerous and he's in a tux doesn't look dangerous looks like they went to the prom doesn't matter whatever you do show them who's boss and if they disrespect you who cares what the original incident was make sure you slam to the ground because the biggest crime in America is disrespecting a police officer and we don't even know if that happened here but that's certainly a good enough excuse for them to take action like this most of the time yeah I just wanted to also add something about how for some reason we've gotten to this point where everything needs to escalate quickly every situation every disagreement every conflict needs to escalate and it just hit me as you were talking jank I used to work at a coffee shop and when people want their coffee and they wanted a specific way and they don't get it the specific way sometimes they get angry and so when I used to be a barista this one woman after remaking her drink for her three different times was still unhappy with her drink and you know what she did with her latte she threw it at me she literally threw hot latte all over me right and so in today's world she'd get shot or something at some point right but you know what happened the manager came in and told her you need to get out right now out no cops were called it didn't escalate from there yes I was upset right but no one needs to get you know to a point where someone gets physically hurt because of someone losing their temper and that's essentially what keeps happening time and time again and all these stories and keep it real if that's a rich person in LA through a white woman throwing latte at you there ain't no cops and she's not gonna get arrested now is say this she's an african-american young man or woman and throws latte or coffee a hot coffee or someone you think the cops aren't gonna be called and you think there isn't going to be violence is that what you think you don't live in this country if that's what you think right well right I just want to say because I feel like it's the same story over and over again I just saw a video I think Shaun King posted of a elderly black woman who was being escorted out of her car by five or six cops and they grabbed her going to his pace sometimes it's just stressful because you see it over and over again what I want to say is a couple of things where are all of the the white people the activists where are you speaking up against this because what I do what I do see is I like the n-double-a-cp says this so it's just black people continuously talking about the ghosts that nobody believes that exists because that young black man if you read the comments underneath it he deserved it because he was talking back to a cop and it is a continuous thing that we continue that we we see daily so what I say is every opportunity that I get to speak I'm gonna tell people of color stop spending money in the businesses that continuously call the dogs on you and treat you like animals every single one of you you talk about Waffle House why do black people continue go to Waffle House because they're poor and that's where they can afford to go after prom it's open late the food doesn't cost a lot of money and unfortunately they go there and that this is how they're treated and it gets old it gets old because that white woman that was talking to the cops and she cursed at them and that video went viral because they have pulled her children over was not arrested was not touched Reese Witherspoon told the police officer do you know who I am and he backed up off of her but apparently that's not something that we are afforded so what do we need to do is take our dollars and start putting it into the businesses that treat us like we're subhuman and and I'm talking to Latinos and brown people alike because a lot of us like to say we're not like the black people were not like yes we are when they see they see us the same and if you don't think they're treating minorities Latinos like that those undocumented immigrants that live in Tennessee there are many of them they can't even have a run-in with the police so what I'm saying is uh we sound like broken records those cops they come with aggression they choke that boy out they grab that old lady by the by the neck we continue to see this let's take our dollars and put them elsewhere because we do not need to keep putting money in the hands of our oppressors right there there have been calls for a boycott of Waffle House and n-double-a-cp and other representatives from other organizations have called for a similar sort of training around race issues for employees at Waffle House as well but I think the issue is is something else and it's to the root of what you were talking about Ida it's the way that black people's bodies are criminalized and it's something I talked about earlier this week khalil gibran Mohammed has this book called condemnation of blackness and he goes through the very intentional policies that were put into place to criminalize black bodies that also go hand in hand with laws so what do law enforcement do they intentionally tried to either kill or arrest black people because it's been a part of their centuries long thinking and even you know Malcolm X became very famous in the 1950s for leading a whole procession of Harlemites to the police department we're a very brutalized member of the Nation of Islam who was not doing anything was detained and not sent to the hospital because of police brutality injuries so you know this has been going on for a long time and even to the point where you know listening to Darren Wilson's responses about what had happened the night or the day of Michael Brown's murder they asked him if they could see he was carrying a weapon and he said yes his body so that should tell you everything about how law enforcement looks at black people's bodies and how they respond unfortunately with extreme excessive force to the point where this kid I mean I know he's 22 but this kid is saying the very words that Eric garner said his last words in 2016 so Gerald Griggs among others is organizing both hashtag boycott Waffle House and a sit-in on May 12th which harkens back to the Civil Rights ers so that's that's a good movement you know your point about Reese Witherspoon I know really struck me because I thought my god imagine if when Reese Witherspoon said you know who I am the cop took her ass slammed her to the ground it's unimaginable right right but that happens the black people all the time it's dangerous what Mel Gibson's anti-semitic rant and what he called the female officer and the whole time he's just as courted like oh okay everything's fine they never beat the crap out of him they treat him with kid gloves and it goes on no the other part you mentioned I know about you know hey well you know he talked back to to the cop remember the Bundy ranch guys yes exactly not only did they talk back to the cops and yell at them they threatened them they threatened to murder them and then they pointed guns at the cops kid gloves so oh my god they'd let him stay in that Oregon compound for how many days how many weeks right and then finally the guy one of them finally got shot because he gets out of the car after he said he would murder cops starts walking towards the cops with a gun they're like okay fine finally right and everyone else those heads are black and it's a normal situation they shoot that whole car up they're not taking any chances those guys all said they would murder the cops right right and instead they'd shoot that one guy and that's it and everybody else and by the way you know what I'm losing money ranchers they're free to go now yep they're out of jail okay that they don't forget jail they won say it's unbelievable the difference that you see in this country so one side is allowed to threaten the murder of cops ago how dare you impinge on my American rights I have killed them too actually there was a white man that's killed two cops before and there is no story there's a story on the coverage yeah yeah and on the other hand if you say hey can you not choke me on the night of my prize no boom slam them down etc so and and for the companies and the restaurants the senators a right way to handle this in a wrong way Starbucks I think handled the right way they're shutting them they're all their stores on May 29th they're talking about implicit bias training understand hey we're not calling all of our employees racist so what we're saying is we're training you on all the implicit bias that we all have as Americans and and now they're allowing people to use the bathrooms etc etc you could say it's not enough for whatever you want to say about it but at least they're responding and they're taking action and they're doing something bold about it so far Waffle House I haven't heard a thing and so when your employees it's not it is about you right when your employees constantly call the cops on black customers who quote-unquote disagree with them and have the cops manhandle them that is your issue and if you don't fix that then itís right and the sit-ins are right to say that's on you and you know and look like that's I like waffle honestly I've talked about it on the show before I like the one I like the food but if you're gonna treat Americans like this I'm not going so so far I haven't heard anything from Waffle House to fix this situation maybe they don't think it's a thing that they need to fix well then word
