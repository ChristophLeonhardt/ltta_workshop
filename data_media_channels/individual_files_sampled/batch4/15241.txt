the Sheriff of Broward County in Florida refuses to resign and recently said in a televised interview that he has amazing leadership skills despite the fact that we now have reports that his deputies stayed outside the building as the massacre was occurring because they had been instructed not to enter without their body cameras being switched on first and that caused the delay we all find out what the truth is but if you read the recent article by sericata about the more than 40 cases being investigated of abuse kidnapping and even murder inside the Broward County Sheriff's Department we have a serious problem but what if you don't live in Broward County what if you have nothing to do with that school shooting nevertheless lessons must be drawn conclusions made why everything has changed in recent years this isn't just about the mentally unhinged in a school shooting we've seen that be Hall before in Columbine but things have changed with the terrorist threat as well look at what happened in San Bernardino with the people mowed down by their fellow co-workers at a Christmas party or look at the Poulsen nightclub Massacre with over 50 people killed by a jihadi the world has changed most police departments I have talked to several of them consulted with them have changed their protocols when they arrived on the scene of a potential active shooter situation whether it is a terrorist or whether it's somebody else they don't wait they don't set up a perimeter they don't call for the hostage negotiator they enter the building immediately because there may be nobody to negotiate with if it's a suicide attack and if it's somebody who's mentally deranged there's no time to save lives they have a long gun with them whether they have a bulletproof vest they go in to save lives what does that mean for you it means very simply that whether you carry a badge or a gun is not the issue if you're a human being alive today be aware of your surroundings when I went to the mall with my children when they were small if we sat down at a restaurant or went into one of the shops I'd play a game with them I'd say hey how many entrances to this building is there anything inside this room that could hide you or could stop bullets it's a fun game perhaps but it could save lives as one Police Department has said always have a plan if you find yourself in such a situation where your life or the lives of your loved ones are on the line you are there are three things you must do number one run flee the scene of the attack if you can't do that then hide if you can't hide from the attacker your last option the option you must take is to fight I have a license to carry a gun in the state where I live in America and I carry it in case I need it because I would much prefer to carry a gun and not need it than to need it one day and not have it on me but if you don't have the mental fortitude you don't wish to carry a gun that's okay still have a plan to fight I don't care if it's your bare hands I don't care if it's a fire extinguisher save the lives of yourselves and your loved ones never give up to quote Winston Churchill don't be a chicken little don't live your life afraid but just walk through the world not staring down at your phone as so many people do but be aware of your surroundings and if something bad happens remember have a plan thank you for watching the Gawker briefing if you like this video please check out the rebel media YouTube channel follow me on Twitter at said Gawker that's s e b g RK a and share these videos on facebook and twitter because with your help we can push back on the fake news industrial complex and finally get the truth out god bless
