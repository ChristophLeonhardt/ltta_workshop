hey guys Kayla back here with another video okay so the topic of today's video is putting yourself out there okay so like what does that mean where is there well there can be anywhere that you wouldn't usually go you know maybe because it's like weird or scary or something like that I think you're so cool I think you were so I'm gonna stop you said I can say one thing and I say one thing please pine thank you look when I was your age I was not cool like you you have always interests and your videos and just how you express yourself and then is so it's just so cool it's so great and I just I just think maybe you see to put yourself out there a little bit this is so good look there at the new movie 8th grade about a teenage girl about to enter high school navigating today is all-consuming social media age do you see the phone at the table it's just like you know looking at it joining us now the film's writer and director Bo Burnham thank you so much for being on for me why there's so many things this is like an exploration of human anxiety in the technology technology age yeah I mean that I was really just wanting to write a movie but how I was feeling at the time which was anxious and the more I looked at how I was feeling the more I realized I think I was feeling like a 13 year old girl for a reason and I feel like maybe culturally were going through a bit of an eighth grade moment feels like that yeah the worst it was the worst and it remains the worst and it feels like right now is a very crazy time to be alive and 8th grade was the craziest time of my usually the idea of being in eighth grade now feels a president who acts like he's anything yes right now in eighth grade reading is a connection I mean it's about this this is about this and kids if you're I I have a fourteen-year-old let me know daughter this is the dominant thing in their lives you and your cousin in your life were you talking about social difference we news this pure social media so it's a daily scorecard every second about how they're doing with theirs every other kid how many likes they have how many things they have and a constant reminder of what they're not doing and their self-worth is so tied up in this and your as a parent it if you talk to any parent of teenage kids it's like the number one thing you're navigating so you are in the zeitgeist plus ten minute yeah I think we're all navigating it in a way I felt like we were all acting like thirteen year olds on the internet so I wanted to tell the story about the internet about the one group of people that was acting their own age maybe but yeah I mean I the internet means something to me I grew up with it I mean a little bit it sort of became ubiquitous social media when I was seventeen eighteen and I felt like it wasn't being talked enough about honestly there's a lot of like finger wagging about the internet and not enough just sort of depiction of that's you right here right that's you okay so so you're so you're doing you're kind of downplaying a thing you just saw as a little familiar you were one of the first personally one of the first kind of like viral YouTube sensations were like sixteen right steam seventeen this is a little autobiographical in a way right yeah I mean yes I I've had a relationship the internet for a long time I mean the girl live it in the movie she makes videos but no one sees that well yes that's difference but yes yes the way people kids express themselves online to me people see them as narcissistic and a lie it isn't just that it isn't just fake trying to speak yourself into existence trying to maybe live out loud in the air in front of you before you can put into action I think is beautiful and isn't talked about every one of those girls going hey guys they host me officer Hagan how we start the show many morning here's a little more from the movie this is Kayla and her dad more can you not look like that please like what just like the way you're looking looking at the road you can look at the road dad I obviously didn't mean that just like don't be weird and quiet will you do it sorry hey how was the shadow you were being quiet which is fine just like don't be weird and quiet cuz like I look over at you and I think you're about to drive us into a tree or something and then I get really freaked out and then I can't text my friends so just like you can't drive and don't look weird and sad please okay that's worse oh my god are you now just talking about these performances because the both of the father Josh Hamilton and the and the daughter are like time with giving incredible performances how do you get these and performances out of these actors yeah the dad Josh Hamilton and and Kayla who's played by Ellis Lee Fisher yeah for me it's really just giving the actors especially young actors permission to be inarticulate I mean sometimes young kids and movies are forced to be able to like speak with an ability that is suspiciously similar to a screenwriters ability to speak you know they're always like young poet laureates and for me the experience of being a young kid is being inarticulate is struggling to say what so the script is written like yeah so the thing about being yourself is like wait right and then she can add in her own exactly and then it sort of just like makes it even better yeah it's just it's just about giving them and I have to tell you that impossible feeling on the part of the parent you feel that with them you don't see them you just in the shot and you're just like oh yeah I got to I've never seen adolescence nailed like that or a daughter or father a dinette like that was me but in eighth grade life girls and boys can be incredibly mean to each other on this is there any look at sort of interaction with others there is I mean for me that the bullying has become much more subterranean and even if it is that it's much more just withholding attention I think attention to sort of the currency that kids and measure themselves against so it's much less I think kids would love to get swirlies and be shoved in lockers again it's a much weirder stranger space to navigate impossible and also unpredictable space like your day can go from you know from wonderful to the worst day of your life with the touch of a button and you just don't get away from it you know you wake up with your social life and you go to bed with it and at the end of the day you have a choice between the back of your eyelids and all of the information in the history of the world you mean that's it that's a so how do you share let's help some kids at home were some parents you both are somebody who was kind of a on one side of it now you're you're writing and documenting and analyzing it so as a parent give me some fools or some guidelines of how do I manage my children with this I mean part of it for me is you know I don't want to speak with too much authority because I feel as in it as anybody but I think part of it is also paying attention I hope the movie takes inventory of this it's not just looking at kids as why are you on your phone all the time but like what is the world that we've made for them to look up at my may they want to ignore it and also to just you know lists of them and communicate and I think part of being an adolescent and adolescent relationship is it being fraud is about the parent being a punching bag like they're there working out some of those feelings that might be it's not meant to go perfectly but I hope the movie because I've seen I think movie may help stuck it's sympathize with the parents and vice versa it's a great review I got a hug just a little bit I mean New York Times will shrimp yeah great ransom Fry's hit
