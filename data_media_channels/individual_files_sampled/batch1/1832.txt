raising awareness of the plight of the mahindra we Nobel Peace Laureates visit a refugee camp in Bangladesh to hear of their suffering but how does the visit help the Muslim minority that is it embarrassing for Myanmar's a Nobel laureate Aung San su Chi this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Hoshi mahabhava Myanmar's leader has been widely criticized for turning a deaf ear to global condemnation of her response to the revenger crisis now uncensored she faces a new warning from three women who like her are Nobel Peace Prize winners wake up or face prosecution for genocide is a message Irish peace campaigner Mairead Maguire torkoal comin from Yemen and Iranian shanira body are in Bangladesh they are touring rohini refugee camps to assess their knees particularly women who say soldiers from Myanmar braved and torture them we'll get to our guests in a moment but first let's have a look at the plight of the Raja hundreds of raw ginger continued to pour over the Myanmar border into Bangladesh every week both countries recently signed an agreement to gradually repatriate refugees voluntarily but the UN says conditions are not yet conducive for returning home and the Muslim minority has safety concerns in Buddhist dominated Myanmar around 700,000 troja fled to neighboring Bangladesh since the military crackdown began last August they told reporters of murders rape torture and the burning of their homes the UN describes the military offensive as a textbook case example of ethnic cleansing and have appealed to Myanmar to stop but the UN Security Council fell short of imposing sanctions on Myanmar for Hinda who numbered around 1 million at the start of last year one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar but the government denies them citizenship and sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh the UN secretary-general says the revenge' are one of the most discriminated against populations in the world Antonio Guterres called for immediate assistance and long-term solutions I call on the government to ensure and further humanitarian access in Rakhine State and I appeal to the international community to support those who have fled to Bangladesh the international community needs to come together to support the safe voluntary dignified and sustainable turn of refugees to their areas of origin or choice in accordance with international standards let's get the thoughts of our guests joining us in Cox bazaar in Bangladesh Mairead Maguire a Nobel Peace Prize laureate now visiting raha refugees in Berlin turn keen his director of the Burmese Mahindra organisation UK and in Kuala Lumpur Charles Santiago chair of ASEAN parliamentarians for Human Rights welcome to you all let me start by asking miss Mairead Maguire this we this is not the first time we've heard leaders from different parts of the world saying this is one of the most persecuted communities on earth and that the rural India are the world's most friendless people but nothing has been done to alleviate their pains what do you think from your experience your recent visit should be done immediately about this particular crisis well I think immediately that the action should be taken for the the International Criminal Court to immediately set up hearings for the to the Burmese government for the Ranga genocide that is happening in this the 21st century and that should be an immediate thing immediately anxiety she as a moral leader and a person people have looked for hope should immediately go to the villages were the people have been ripped murdered killed burnt out of their villages and had escaped into another country there's a million 1 million through Hungama people sitting in this camp in Bangladesh she has a responsibility and I hope that she go and she speak out against the actions of the Burmese military this can be stopped tomorrow all it needs is a phone call to the Burmese military from those in a par to say stop killing murdering raping burn the Rehan gajja people we heard testimonies today which would break your heart and she can stop this can be stopped from the top because the orders are coming from the top I see you and they think that they are immune and nobody will do anything about it it can't be stopped and stopped now mister Khin when you hear statements from people like Mairead Maguire describing what is happening as a policy of genocide and ethnic cleansing do you have any hopes that the international community will listen to people like Mairead and stop the suffering of thousands of people in Myanmar I think I really appreciate and many thanks to Maguire Nobel laureate and two others visiting to the camps as a Rohingya myself you know I have also met these victims you know it's been going on this genocide form around for decades you know so it is important that to stop this genocide from you know policymakers normal love rates intellectual every society must come forward to stop this genocide we need everyone's support and solidarity to stop this genocide I really appreciate and thanks again visiting to the camps and meeting approving of women is given them a big and moral support to their victims who faced mass rape and mass slaughtered and other atrocities by their Burmese military I think international community we have seen is quite disappointing UN Security Council they sat down for three times and we have not seen any stronger action this is very disappointing and today we have seen also EU have some some conclusion from Council so it is not that much help that much thing to stop this genocide the Burmese military and the government we need concrete effective action from you know individual government to call for bring those responsible to justice okay others mr. Santiago I mean against the backdrop of all the international condemnation why does the government of Myanmar seem to be in denial about what is happening the government of Myanmar is not in denial they know exactly what they have done but they have this pretense that it is within their right to do so because the within their white to kill people drive thousands of people out there hell yeah scorched land exactly what they have done I was there last month yeah I was there in Cox's Bazaar last week I last month and I met the refugees I met a whole about 20 to 25 refugees who are based in in Cox's Bazar in fact I also met with some new people who had just come in from a recurrent State and this was taking place at the same time as the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh for concluding the repatriation plan what they told us was very clear they were raped the airline was to burnt the houses were burned their wives were raped the you know he was at law is just lots of horrible stories that they had told us but the point basically and the point important question now is why is the international community silent and quiet about Myanmar and the quick answer to a very difficult question is that because of investment opportunities in Myanmar I think a lot of control of companies a lot of countries see Myanmar as a investment opportunity and therefore they do not want to rock the boat at the international level or even pull up the army to be sanctioned or even to question and criticize on sang-soo Chien I think the biggest responsibility in this context goes to ASEAN ASEAN has been pussyfooting on this issue as Yin Yin mye is a member of ASEAN ASEAN has kept silent in fact actually ignoring what happened in Rakhine State and in so doing legitimizes what's happening in terms of the genocide that has been taking place totally irresponsible all right miss Mairead when you address on Sanford cheese saying that she has to act or face prosecution isn't she the most intriguing part of this particular puzzle she's someone who suffered trying to defend human rights but suddenly she is very silent denial think this is an iceberg of misinformation what's the problem here do you think that she is more concerned about protecting fragile democracy in her own country and putting the issue of the Hansa on the back burner well I think when you are a leader in a country that all the people should be your responsibility not just a section of the community and there are many ethnic groups in Burma who have never been protected I went with Bishop tutu 17 years ago up to the Burma Thailand border to the current people and we met women who had been ripped by Burmese soldiers hundreds of them and they were sitting in on a border absolutely distraught and the Burmese government this is not a new thing going on this has been going on for a long time that the Burmese government can't do what they liked now I would invite ank sang-soo just to consider this one story from a woman today 20 years of each the Burmese soldiers came into her village they they kill her husband they took her new baby idyllic they threw the six months old baby and too early and it was joined they dragged her back to her home Burmese soldiers held her dying when another soldier reactor and and then they lifted her thinking she was dead took her out and threw her in a field and left her for dead now I would say what sort of leadership have you gotten Burma whenever lies at Soldier to do this to innocent women children and that story can be multiplied over and over so this is gang rip murder torture a genocide 'el policy to destroy a whole people this is what this is a bite and I'm saying sushi as a leader in her country must speak out in defense of the defenseless I get your point Myanmar's Lida is widely criticized for her response to that crisis especially because on Tseng said she was water the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 the state Chancellor doesn't have control over the military and she hasn't condemned the use of force by troops during their crackdown on the revenger SOOC is blamed what she called a huge iceberg of misinformation for the crises in Rakhine State in a TV address last September she condemned all human rights violations in Rakhine but didn't specify who would be qualified to return and how the repatriation process would work in her first address to the United Nations General Assembly last year search she defended her government's efforts to resolve the crisis this year as she faced mounting international criticism for failing the rehén gia she cancelled her trip to the United Nations in New York mr. king what is it that which you think on thanks that she can do immediately to stop the problem can she interfere with the military how can she solve this crisis you know I have to point out here the bottom line if she has willingness to do she could do a lot of things and every time international community says she is not controlling the military but we have to look at she is defending mass atrocities what Burmese military committed genocide against Ravina recently we have to look at you know Bill Richardson who is 30 years friend of Johnson suti you know he was a member of committee Kofi Annan recommendation Implementation Committee he realized it is whitewash there is no such talk about citizenship each full citizenship issue safety security issue there so we can't see any attitude to our own English by their millet from military and onsen suji particularly she is taking side of the military she is totally complicit of this genocide if she really wants she could do a lot I'd for me as a frankly speaking as a Rohingya I am i we ruined I have supported her I campaigned for her release and last ten years ago you know but I I don't think she will do anything that's I have to as a big teams who are suffering in Bangladesh victims of genocide I met last two weeks ago we need to bottom line here the only thing international community must intervene UN must intervene to protect us because that's all in here when we talk here protector to return to protect that homeland in Mema that is what we call him for because Burmese military and government have no attitude there is no I see a point never change increase mr. Santiago in this debates mr. Santiago we we tend to put the blame most of the time on the Myanmar government and on Censorship but there are elements that need to be clarified when the Bangladeshi government signs this repatriation deal with the Myanmar's government which paves the way for people to be sent back home have those people been consulted in advance have do we know whether they want to go back home when the situation remains very delicate for them and their village is completely razed by the government we met while I was in Kinshasa our last month we had met with officials were part of the negotiating team with the Myanmar government as well as the military and we also met the refugees as I said earlier it is very clear from the point of the refugees that they do not want to return and they had put some conditions and I believe they have already communicated that decision to the UN UNHCR and other UN agencies one is the one safety depends agent program they also one peacekeeping force in Rakhine State in order to ensure that they will not be raped and killed again number two the one citizenship they want freedom of worship as well as compensation for the loss of life as well as for the loss of property and so on so forth till all of this are guaranteed there is no appetite to go back and as I said while the negotiations are going on and while the government of Bangladesh is planning to send back or the Petri some of them more people are coming into Cox's Bazar and that's because the burning the looting the raping is still going on and therefore it doesn't create a climate of confidence for the refugee a for the refugees in Cox's Bazar to return back to the speaker of that particular climate of confidence and confidence-building measures and let me go to miss Mairead I mean from your experience in campaigning for piercing plate communities shattered by ethnic religious divisions don't you think that the international community when it comes to Myanmar should address first of all the root causes of the problem why are they denied the right to be citizens why the government continues to consider them as illegal migrants and then once you solve that you talk about the repatriation well the tragedy here is that the Burmese government have denied these people their identity and they don't even use the word Ranga and when people are speaking they actually are warning them don't use the word Ranga and there's been many high-profile visitors have gone into Burma and before they went they were told don't use the word Ranga and yet we have the hang of people whose history is well documented and Burma so there they are a people they are an ethnic people and we know there 135 different ethnic groups in Burma but the Ranga people have been removed of that list so they have no rights and they are not allowed to work there held within camps inside Burma and we heard today that the this this village they were actually sealed off for six months by Burmese soldiers and not allied in the head of the village so the whole human rights and right rights question for the Ranga people has got to be dealt with they have to be given recognition and citizenship and that protected and their lands given back and restored to them because they've been stripped of everything and so that has to be undertaken so when they go back they will be protected but we here on the border and the no-man's land or 2007 in the middle of nowhere have lost everything and if they come in here to Bangladesh they will become refugees and if they go back into Burma they will become tortured persecuted and nameless people again and the international community must deal with this ok mister Khin should the international community post sections arms embargo asset freezes do you think on Myanmar's government officials do you think that would be helpful yes of course that will be helpful Mustang we have to focus on ICC referral to Burmese general me online and others of course sanctions and arms embargo on top of that we need to talk here now the bottom line is monsoons a rainy season is coming soon in 3-4 months time so there is more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees this is you know landslides and you know flooding can happen anytime after three months so these Rohingya refugees are in in a big danger so we need to look for immediate something solution what is we need is ringa when I met big teams you know jab victims of genocide they told me they want to they want to go back their homeland but it might be it must be protected so we need to look at without UN protection these people cannot be returned we need you and protection ok needed and we must as these people the the Rohingya people they want to return back so returning back and also the United Nations and that it should step in mr. Santiago this is a crisis that is most likely going to go on for quite some time many villages have been recently raised by the government people saying this is an attempt by the government to destroy evidence of mass killing and genocide Bangladesh which now hosts thousands of Roja is suffering financially what should the international community do to tackle this humanitarian crisis well I think a couple of things should be done one is immediate support for the efforts of the Bangladesh government especially financial support the UN's presence is quite humongous in providing support our day-to-day support in for the refugees but I think I want to go back to the issue that King had raised earlier that the monsoon rain monsoon rains are supposed to hit Bangladesh especially the Cox's Bazar area beginning next month and the options that we had met both the UN as well as the government fear that there's going to be lots of loss of life because they do not have the capacity to protect a million people in the entire place in Cox's Bazar now what is going to happen is this a lot of human trafficking is going to start because people will find their own solution to a very difficult complicated problem and then you'll have human trafficking syndicate operating and that is going to lead to a larger problem with in Southeast Asia so human trafficking will be a big problem I see I foresee beginning March April main this is something that they weren't a different let me go to now I think miss me rate for this is going to be my last question marade we have created international institutions to maintain peace and hold accountable anyone who commits atrocities we have the UN we have the EU we have the International Criminal Court but all these institutions have done little to try to contain this particular crisis what is the problem here are we talking about different regional agendas countries like China Russia the United States of America not agreeing on how to move forward when it comes to the law hinder well the international community must help 300 people and they can't do it we have witnessed here on the grounds Bert the Bangladeshi government has been wonderful and helping we have the NGOs you have here organizing what is a tremendous challenge to them where you have had a million people coming over a border and they have managed to feed them shelter them take care of them but they need more and more help and outside governments can help them financially and everywhere to look after the refugees who are our first and urgent concern secondly the the government of Burma Bangladesh and Burma sit down and figure out how you make it possible for the Burmese people three hundred to stay and virtue which is their home which is where they want to be and live in fear for they know it but why turn King Charles Santiago thank you very much indeed for your contribution to the program and thank you too for watching you can see the program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at AJ inside story from me Hashim Alberta the whole team here bye for now you
