after two weeks of rumbling earthquakes spewing lava and belching ash volcano Kilauea erupted explosively on Thursday wafting boiling clouds of steam ash and rock high into the atmosphere there were no reported injuries or loss of life volcano scientists say the blast is part of Kilauea zz normal pattern of activity based on our models and some reports that we got ash fall was pretty localized to volcano village area and volcano National Park trace amounts to ash in that area so a big event that got people's attention but not with widespread impacts it was the biggest blowout so far at the volcano's summit scientists say it was caused by molten lava in the crater sinking until it hit groundwater the resultant superheated steam blasted upward like a titanic tea kettle and it will likely happen again volcano it's a real dynamic situation that's like this morning that punch up and then and then dive back down really quickly the ash cloud rose up over 9,000 meters just below the cruising altitude of commercial passenger jets but aircraft flying in and out of Hawaii's Big Island were not affected tiny ash particles can be a health hazard if they become lodged in the lungs officials urged people in the Asheville area to stay inside meanwhile rifts that have been using large amounts of red-hot lava in residential areas and near a geothermal plant have quieted down at least for the moment dozens of houses have been destroyed and about 1,800 people have been forced to evacuate Kilauea could remain restless for weeks months or longer Rob Reynolds al-jazeera
