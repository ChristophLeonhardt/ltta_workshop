Raila Odinga is not
your average politician.
He’s the leading
opposition politician.
Last year, he lost a
presidential election.
But he’s been insisting
that the vote
he lost was rigged against him.
“Our country Kenya
is in big trouble.”
Kenya’s Supreme Court
even agreed with him at first,
throwing out the
first election that we had
because it was fraudulent. When
it came to the second election,
Raila said the process
was still rigged
and he dropped out of the race.
His supporters
boycotted the poll,
and the president, Uhuru Kenyatta,
easily won a second term.
But it was a pretty
uneven victory.
“The elections were
the most peaceful
in our nation’s history.”
There was tension across
the country on voting day,
and things were so
bad in some places
that the polls
never even opened.
Nearly two million
Kenyans didn’t
get to cast a ballot because
their polling stations stayed
shut.
So Uhuru Kenyatta
won the election,
but it’s clear that
the country is divided.
What happened
today in Nairobi is
something that Raila’s supporters
have been preparing for months.
They wanted to gather in
Uhuru Park in central Nairobi
and hold an alternate
inauguration.
They said they were going
to swear Raila in as
“the people’s president.”
The government
called this treason,
but they let people pass.
Thousands and
thousands of people
went to the park
for the swearing-in.
The government had
disabled the equipment
for three private television
stations that were live
broadcasting the swearing-in.
Across the country,
Kenyans experienced the first
peacetime media blackout
that many of them
could even remember.
Raila took an oath as
the people’s president,
although no one knows
exactly what that means.
He gave a short speech,
and he denounced what
he called electoral autocracy.
Then he went home.
