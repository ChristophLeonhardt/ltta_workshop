ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS INDEED A WITCH HUNT. Bret: JOHN ROBERTS, THANK YOU. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI LEADING A DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION INTO THE HEART OF THE IMMIGRATION STORM TONIGHT. THEY'RE VISITING A BORDER FACILITY WHERE CHILDREN ARE BEING HELD. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT WILL LOOM LARGE IN S IS IN SAN DIEGO. THIS IS NOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION. IT'S ABOUT HUMANITY. IT'S ABOUT FAMILY. IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. FOR DAYS, DEMOCRATS FANNED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO HAMMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ZERO-TOLERANCE IMMIGRATION POLICY. IT IS APPALLING. IT'S NOT AMERICAN. IT'S UNNECESSARY. IT IS ALSO NOT NEW. THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE ANY AND ALL WHO CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY ACTUALLY BEGAN AS A PILOT PROGRAM UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH IN 2006. THIS ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY IS INTENDED TO DETER PEOPLE FROM BREAKING THE LAW. CHIEF AGENT IN TUCSON. ADVOCATES CLAIM HELP REDUCE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKES THE SAME CASE TODAY. WE CANNOT AND WILL NOT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN OR OTHER CHILDREN TO THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY BY GIVING THEM IMMUNITY IN THE PROCESS. THE ADMINISTRATION HOPES ZERO-TOLERANCE WILL REDUCE FRAUD. WE DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF PRETENDING THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS COMING TO THIS COUNTRY AS A FAMILY UNIT ARE IN FACT A FAMILY. HOMELAND SECURITY CLAIMS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FRAUDULENTLY USING CHILDREN TO POSE AS FAMILY INCREASED 315% THIS FISCAL YEAR, EXPLOITING A LOOPHOLE TO ESCAPE DEPORTATION AND PROSECUTING THOSE CASES, THE DEPARTMENT SEPARATED SOME 1200 CHILDREN FROM AN ADULT. THE SMUGGLERS AND TRAFFICKERS KNOW THE LOOPHOLES BETTER THAN CONGRESS. CRITICS SAY TRUMPET SEPARATING CHILDREN NOT TO CHANGE THE LAW BUT AS A BARGAINING CHIP TO FUND HIS WALL. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD RESCIND THIS ZERO INHUMANITY POLICY IMMEDIATELY? MOMENTS AGO, THE ADMINISTRATION STRESSED THAT ENTERING THE U.S. WITHOUT PERMISSION IS A CRIME. BASICALLY, THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU DETAIN WOMEN AND CHILDREN, THE COURTS HAVE SAID THAT YOU HAVE TO RELEASE THEM WITHIN 20 DAYS THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS CONGRESS TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE SO FAMILIES CAN STAY TOGETHER. WHAT WE HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS TODAY IS THEY WANT TO BAN THE PRACTICE AND THEY BELIEVE FAMILIES SHOULD BE HANDLED
