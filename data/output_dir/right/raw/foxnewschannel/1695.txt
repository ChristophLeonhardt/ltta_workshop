1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:01,312
I CAN SAY I'M CERTAINLY ROOTING

2
00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:02,313
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

3
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:05,716
THANKS A LOT FOR COMING ON.

4
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:07,284
>> THANK YOU, THANKS, TUCKER.

5
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:08,786
>> Tucker: IT PROBABLY WON'T

6
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:09,153
HELP.

7
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:10,221
SOME CANDIDATES ON THE

8
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:10,921
DEMOCRATIC SIDE FLIPPING THE

9
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:13,324
BIRD TO THE NRA WHILE OTHERS

10
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:14,892
BACK FROM STYLE IMMIGRATIONS,

11
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,126
IT'S NOT QUITE CLEAR WHAT THE

12
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:18,929
DEMOCRATIC MESSAGES FOR 2018.

13
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,331
BRIT HUME IS FOX'S SENIOR

14
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,298
POLITICAL ANALYST.

15
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:21,932
HE WATCHES CAREFULLY.

16
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:22,666
HE JOINS US TONIGHT.

17
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,602
WHAT YOU THINK THE MESSAGES, OR

18
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:27,104
IS THERE A NATIONAL MESSAGE THAT

19
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:28,305
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SELLING

20
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,306
THIS MIDTERM?

21
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,141
>> I THINK IT'S PRETTY

22
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:30,875
INDISTINCT AT THIS MOMENT IF

23
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:31,709
THERE IS ONE.

24
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,811
I THINK MUCH OF THE PARTY IS SO

25
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:35,446
MESMERIZED BY DONALD TRUMP AND

26
00:00:35,446 --> 00:00:37,848
LOADS HIM SO DEEPLY THAT THAT

27
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:39,283
HAS BECOME KIND OF THE CENTRAL

28
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,451
THING AND THE CENTRAL THEME THAT

29
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:44,321
YOU CAN SEE.

30
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:45,122
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

31
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:46,590
APPEARS TO BE MOSTLY ABOUT RIGHT

32
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,091
NOW.

33
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,360
I SUSPECT AS TIME GOES ON

34
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,227
SOMETHING MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS

35
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:53,097
BORDERS WILL COME ALONG.

36
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:54,231
BUT REMEMBER, TUCKER.

37
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:56,100
THESE CANDIDATES ARE RUNNING IN

38
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,170
A PARTY WHERE 71%, ACCORDING TO

39
00:00:59,170 --> 00:00:59,770
ONE RECENT POLL, WANT

40
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,639
DONALD TRUMP IMPEACHED.

41
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:03,908
SO IT'S KIND OF UNDERSTANDABLE

42
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:04,641
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME FOCUS

43
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,911
ON HIM.

44
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,946
>> Tucker: FOR SURE.

45
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:10,848
MOST DEMOCRATS ARE, OF COURSE,

46
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:12,183
VERY ANTI-DRUM, THAT'S WHY THEY

47
00:01:12,183 --> 00:01:12,716
ARE DEMOCRATS.

48
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:14,718
BUT IS THAT A MESSAGE THAT MOVES

49
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:16,120
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS?

50
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,321
>> BASED ON THE EVIDENCE WE

51
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,589
HAVE, IT SEEMS NOT TO BE WORKING

52
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:20,257
VERY WELL, AND THE REASON I SAY

53
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:22,927
THAT IS, LOOK AT THE ADVANTAGES

54
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,161
THAT DEMOCRATS ENJOY GOING INTO

55
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:25,096
THIS MIDTERM ELECTION.

56
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,498
FIRST OF ALL, THE POLITICAL

57
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:28,732
GRAVITY AND ANY PRESIDENT'S

58
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:30,634
FIRST MIDTERM IS ALWAYS WITH THE

59
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:31,936
OTHER PARTY AND THE AVERAGE LOSS

60
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,371
IS MORE THAN WOULD BE ENOUGH IF

61
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:36,006
THEY MADE THEIR AVERAGE AGAIN,

62
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:36,740
THE DEMOCRATS WOULD GET CONTROL

63
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,109
OF THE HOUSE.

64
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:40,277
THEY HAD A HUGE GAP IN WHAT'S

65
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,512
CALLED A GENERIC BALLOT.

66
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:43,314
THAT'S THE ONE WHERE YOU ASK

67
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:44,115
PEOPLE IF THEY WOULD RATHER VOTE

68
00:01:44,115 --> 00:01:46,117
FOR A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN

69
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,118
UNNAMED IN THE UPCOMING

70
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:47,718
ELECTION.

71
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:48,419
NORMALLY DEMOCRATS DO WELL ON

72
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,688
THAT BALLOT.

73
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:53,390
THEY WERE UP, PLUS 15 OR 16 AT

74
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,325
ONE POINT NOT VERY LONG AGO AND

75
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:56,527
NOW THAT NUMBER IS DOWN TO

76
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:59,630
SINGLE DIGITS AND SAMPLES DOWN

77
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,598
BELOW SINGLE DIGITS WHICH

78
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:01,932
SUGGEST THAT WHATEVER THEY ARE

79
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,234
SELLING PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING

80
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:03,934
WITH THE ENTHUSIASM THAT THE

81
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:06,170
PARTY HAD HOPED FOR.

82
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,304
>> Tucker: WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF

83
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,874
THEY DON'T RETAKE THE HOUSE?

84
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:13,611
>> WELL, I THINK THERE WILL BE

85
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,612
AN AGONIZING REAPPRAISAL BECAUSE

86
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,714
WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS

87
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:18,716
BLUE WAVE THAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE

88
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,317
INEVITABLE AND MAY YET COME.

89
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,585
IF IT DOESN'T COME, OBVIOUSLY

90
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:24,288
THERE'S GOING TO BE A SEARCH FOR

91
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:25,489
SCAPEGOATS AND WE WILL SEE WHAT

92
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:25,923
HAPPENS.

93
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:27,057
BUT THIS PARTY I THINK, WHAT WE

94
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:30,294
ARE SEEING EMERGE NOW IS THAT

95
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:31,896
FOR ALL THE DIVISIONS IN THE

96
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,631
REPUBLICAN PARTY BETWEEN TRUMP

97
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,633
SUPPORTERS AND SO ON AND ALL THE

98
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,102
DIVISIONS WITHIN THE

99
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:39,303
CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, THE

100
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:39,970
DIVISIONS IN THE DEMOCRATIC

101
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,540
PARTY ARE AT LEAST AS DEEP, IF

102
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,775
NOT DEEPER AND AT THE HEART OF

103
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:45,442
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND

104
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:46,343
REMEMBER YOU SAYING IN A SPEECH

105
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:48,812
NOT TOO MANY YEARS AGO, WAS NOT

106
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,714
WITH HILLARY CLINTON BUT SHE WON

107
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:51,081
ANYWAY.

108
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:51,749
A CANDIDATE OF HER STRIPE I

109
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:55,119
DON'T THINK WIN THIS TIME.

110
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,721
I DON'T KNOW THAT A WHITE MALE

111
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,289
CANDIDATE COULD WIN.

112
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:02,493
HERE WE ARE IN THE DEMOCRATS,

113
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:03,694
THE DEMOCRATS REALLY HAVE SOME

114
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:04,962
SERIOUS DIVISIONS TO WORRY ABOUT

115
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,797
AND WHETHER WHATEVER THEY COME

116
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:08,699
UP WITH WILL BE APPEALING TO A

117
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,701
BROAD CROSS SECTION OF VOTERS IS

118
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:11,702
OBVIOUSLY WHAT REMAINS TO BE

119
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:12,970
SEEN.

120
00:03:13,103 --> 00:03:13,737
CANDIDATE COULD NOT WIN.

121
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,706
I DON'T THINK A LOT OF THE WHITE

122
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:16,440
MALE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE

123
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,174
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION KNOW THAT

124
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:19,076
YET BUT I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

125
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:19,376
LEARN.

126
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,679
DO YOU THINK THAT IT MOVES IN

127
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,914
THE DIRECTION OF POPULIST

128
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,049
ECONOMICS, THE ELIZABETH WARREN,

129
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,117
THE BERNIE SANDERS PARTY?

130
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:28,319
>> I THINK THAT'S THE DRIFT AND

131
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,487
I THINK THAT EXCITES A LOT OF

132
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:30,921
PEOPLE.

133
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:31,789
YOU LOOK AT THE ATTITUDES OF

134
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:36,493
YOUNG VOTERS NOW.

135
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:39,129
WHO DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE GRASPED

136
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,130
THE BENEFIT OF A MARKET

137
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,831
CAPITALIST ECONOMY AND DON'T

138
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,100
SEEM TO BE PUT OFF AT ALL ABOUT

139
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,902
THE IDEA OF SOCIALISM DESPITE

140
00:03:44,902 --> 00:03:45,636
ITS ABYSMAL HISTORY, WHICH IS

141
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,137
PLAYING OUT EVEN TODAY IN

142
00:03:47,137 --> 00:03:48,939
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD,

143
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,573
VENEZUELA BEING THE MOST

144
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,375
CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE.

145
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,811
BUT I THINK THAT THE PARTY, IT'S

146
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:56,080
GOTTEN PRETTY FAR LEFT NOW AND A

147
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,716
LOT OF OLD IDEAS THAT ARE BEING

148
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,317
PASSED OFF AS KIND OF NEW IDEAS

149
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,620
ARE IN THE AIR.

150
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,921
IN THE PARTY WILL HAVE TO RECKON

151
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:04,655
WITH THAT BECAUSE IF THEY COME

152
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:07,524
UP WITH SOMEBODY WHO WAS A

153
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:08,492
SOCIALIST FOR PRESIDENT I DON'T

154
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:09,226
THINK THEY COULD POSSIBLY WIN.

155
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,728
I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OF THEM WE

156
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,330
WILL SEE BUT THERE WILL BE AWFUL

157
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,864
BATTLES OVER THIS.

158
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:14,898
>> Tucker: THEIR CORPORATE

159
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:18,736
DONORS BECAUSE THE PARTY IS

160
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:19,903
ENTIRELY SUPPORTED BY CORPORATE

161
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:20,870
AMERICA WILL BE PRETTY SURPRISED

162
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,971
WHEN IT TURNS OUT THERE AND

163
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,508
SENDING MONEY TO HUGO CHAVEZ.

164
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:25,376
THANK YOU.

165
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:26,877
>> YOU BATTEN, TUCKER.

166
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:30,714
>> Tucker: GO AHEAD.

167
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,916
>> DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE

168
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,251
ABILITY TO RAISE MONEY FOR A

169
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,085
SMALL DONATION AND MAKE A

170
00:04:35,085 --> 00:00:00,000
SERIOUS RUN FOR IT.
