STEVE: WELCOME BACK, EVERYONE. MY NEXT GUEST MADE THE DECISION AN APARTMENT WITH A BUS CARD AND MONEY TRUSTING HE WOULD FIND HIS OWN WAY HOME. AFTER PUBLISHING HER STORY SHE WAS HAILED AS A MOM THAT GAVE HER KID INDEPENDENCE. SHE WAS LABELED AS AMERICAS WORSE MOM. NOW THIS IS THE BASES OF A UTAH LAW. THIS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO WALK, RUN, BIKE TO AND FROM SCHOOL, PLAY OUTSIDE AND STAY HOME UNATTENDED. STATE WELFARE OFFICERS CAN NO LONGER TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS IF THEY ARE CAUGHT DOING SUCH ACTIVITIES AS LONG AS THEY ARE CLOTHED, FED, AND CARED FOR. THIS IS THE FOUNDER OF FREE RANGE KIDS. I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING AGAINST. FROM WHAT THAT SEE, EAT AND DO. SOMEHOW WE HAVE COME TO BELIEVE IF A KID IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET IT'S ENSLAVING THE KID AND MOM. YOU KISSCRIBE A BIG CHANGE IN THE CULTURE. HAVE THERE BEEN THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OR LAW LIKE OFFICIAL WAYS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN MADE WORSE. YES, IF THE ASSUMPTION THAT A CHILD ISN'T WITH AN ADULT THEY ARE IN DANGER THAT MEANS ANYONE THAT ALLOWS THE CHILD TO WALK HOME. I WALKED HOME AT AGE 5 AND MY MOM WASN'T ARRESTED. YOU GO AND ARREST THE MOM A MOTHER LET HER KID STAY IN THE CAR FOR A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE SHE WENT IN THE GROCERY STORE. WHEN THEY BELIEVE A CHILD IS ENDAMAGERRED THEY ARE ALLOWED TO INVESTIGATE THE PARENTS AND ARREST THE PARENTS WE HEARD ABOUT THE 10-YEAR-OLD AND 6-YEAR-OLD, 10 YEARS OLD WAS THE AGE OF MY CROSSING GUARD. THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO WALK HOME FROM THE LOCAL PARK IN SILVER SPRING. THERE IS THE CASE OF A WORKING SINGLE MOM. STEVE: OH, YES. TERRIBLE STORY. YEAH, IT WAS A TERRIBLE STORY. HER DAUGHTER WAS WITH HER EVERYDAY. SHE WORKED ALL OF THE TIME. THE KID WAS OFF DURING THE SUMMER. SHE WOULD SIT AT MCDONALD'S WHILE HER MOM WORKED A SHIFT. HER COMPUTER WAS STOLEN AND ASKED HER MOM HOW ABOUT I GO TO THE SPINKLER PARK. IT'S BOILING HOT, IT'S SOUTH CAROLINA. HER MOM SAID TAKE A PHONE. IF YOU NEED ME, CALL. THE THIRD DAY IN A ROW A WOMAN SAID WHERE'S YOUR MOM. SHE SAID MY MOM IS WORKING. NOT ONLY WAS SHE ARRESTED AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL. HER CHILD WAS TAKEN AWAY FOR 17 DAYS FOR ENDANGERMENT. IT'S NOT ENDANGERMENT TO SAY MY KID IS OKAY TO PLAY IN THE PARK. YOU CAN'T ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW PARENTS TO MAKE SAFE DECISIONS. STEVE: ABSOLUTELY, RIGHT. I PUT MY CARDS ON THE TABLE. I THINK YOU MIGHT JUST AGREE WITH THIS. TELL US WHAT YOU THINK? I AGREE WITH EVERY BIT OF IT. IF I WERE TO LIST THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN SOCIETY TODAY IT'S A LACK OF INDEPENDENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY. NOT JUST CHILDREN BUT WHEN YOU GET TO COLLEGE AGE KIDS. YOU DON'T GET THERE UNTIL YOU GIVE KIDS INDEPENDENCE. IS IT A RISK. YOU WILL NEVER GROW UP THAT WAY. ONE THING BEYOND JUST CHILDREN. I'M AMAZED AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL, THE DEGREE YOU SEE KIDS. I READ A STORY A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT THE PENN STATE OUTING CLUB THAT'S BEEN SPONSORING OUTDOOR EVENTS. THEY SHUT IT DOWN BECAUSE GOING OUTSIDE IS TOO DANGEROUS. STEVE: I KNOW. AN AMAZINGS STORY. I WANT TO GET TEZLYN. I'M THE MOTHER OF A 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RAISE CHILDREN THE WAY THEY WANT TO. LIKE THE SPANKING ISSUE. I WAS A LATCHKEY KID. MY MOTHER WASN'T ON WELFARE. WHEN I CAME HOME I WASN'T BY MYSELF. I LOCKED IF DOOR AND STAYED IN THE HOUSE. I'M NOT A FAN OF HAVING MY CHILD IN PUBLIC PLACES BY MYSELF. I'VE HAD THINGS HAPPEN TO ME AS A CHILD AT 10 YEARS OLD. I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT AN ABDUCTION. WHEN I LOOK AT PEDOPHILES AND INAPPROPRIATE SITUATIONS THAT HAPPENED WITH ME AS A CHILD THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT WHEN I SEND MY LITTLE GIRL INTO THE WORLD AND PUBLIC PLACE. I BELIEVE EACH PARENTS HAS THE RIGHT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DECIDE WHAT'S ENDANGERMENT LIKE CLOTHING OR STRUCTURE. I WOULDN'T SEND MY CHILD ON THE SUBWAY AND SEE IF YOU COULD GET BACK AND HAVE TWO QUARTERS FOR A NONEXISTENT PAY PHONE. I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE PARENT. LENORE, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE LAW PASSED IN UTAH. TELL US THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT? IT'S THE FREE PARENTING LAW. THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO GET INVOLVED IF A CHILD IF THE PARENTS ARE NOT DISREGARDING THEIR CHILD'S SAFETY AND WELFARE. IF THE KID IS WALKING TO SCHOOL AND PLAYING OUTSIDE AND THEY GET A 911 CALL WHETHER IT'S CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES THEY WILL SAY IF THE CHILD OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY DON'T HAVE TO PROCEED. THAT'S GREAT, I'M HAPPY CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES EXIST AND THE COPS ARE OUT THERE. I WANT THEM TO INVESTIGATE CASES THEY ARE LEFT IN A HOUSE WITH DRUGS OR PIMPING OUT THE CHILD. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO CALL THE CHILD AND SAY I'LL BE LATE AND DON'T SET THE PLACE ON FIRE. WE DON'T ARREST PARENTS FOR PUTTING THEM IN DANGER WHEN WE DRIVE THEM. CHILDREN DIE AS CAR PASSENGERS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. WE CAN'T SAY IT'S SO SCARY OUT THERE AND I'LL ARREST ANY PARENT THAT ALLOWS THEIR CHILD TO PLAY OUTSIDE. THANK YOU. STEVE: QUICK COMMENT FROM BOTH OF YOU. I LIKE THAT WE CAN TURN THE CULTURE AROUND. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. LENORE IS RIGHT THE COPS SHOULD PUT THE PEDOPHILES AWAY. IF YOU BELIEVE IN SELF-GOVERNANCE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT THINKING ADULTS GROWING UP. AS A MOTHER, I TRUST MY 10-YEAR-OLD. SHE DOES WHAT I TELL HER TO DO. THERE ARE SOME SITUATIONS I DON'T WANT TO CHANCE. I DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT TELLING ME WHAT THE SITUATION SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BE. LENORE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I'M HAPPY THE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON
