here's more of Donny Deutsch talking about his friend Michael Cohen the man who he expects is going to take a very important place in US history always my advice to him is the same as if he'd been working for any president that at the end of the day Michaels gonna have to do what's best for his family because certainly he does not have a loyalist on the other side of the equation do you think today he understands that more than previously I think every day he's understood it more and more during our discussion now Meyer Wylie a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York and a former counsel to the mayor of New York City and back with us Ron Klain and Maya the the the the expectation now of Michael Cohen cooperating with federal prosecutors gets higher and higher and Donny Deutsch who knows him knows him well is fueling it well it's hard to imagine I wasn't born today but it is hard to imagine him not cooperating quite frankly remember that Michael Cohen is someone it was already very unusual for there to be the kind of search warrants that we saw on his residence his offices in this hotel because he's an attorney and because he had been an attorney for a sitting president nonetheless those searches happened they happened because there was a lot of indication that he may have been obviously that he may have been involved in criminal activity he's looking at bank fraud wire fraud obviously there are questions about election criminal election violations if he's not doing something to protect himself then essentially all he's doing is falling on his sword why would he do that Ron Klain John Dean has a large role in US history if you zoom in in the early 1970s in the Watergate scandal it sounds like that Donny Deutsch is saying that Michael Cohen could be the John Dean of this era well I do think he will be the answer to a question in American history test but I think the questions going to be named the only Trump lawyer more incompetent than Giuliani and I think Michael Cohen's gonna be the answer that question look what you're seeing play out Lawrence is an incredible public negotiation between two people who don't know what they're doing Donald Trump and Michael Cohen today Michael Cohen both hired a new lawyer signalling a desire to cooperate with the prosecutors and kind of publicly put out a call for Donald Trump to pay his legal fees well both those things can't happen and and you add to that this ridiculous spectacle of Michael Cullen speaking out against the internment of children at the border as he resigns his seat from the RNC a seat that previously was held by Eliot Brody who'd paid off and someone heats up with and then Steve Wynn was guilty of sexual harassment before that the more great moral authority of that position seeing Michael Cohen speak out I mean this is an effort from the bargain with Trump and Trump really I think just got all he can say back is like at 2:00 goofball I don't know really know where this is headed and Maya Rudy Giuliani Trump's TV lawyer is now admitting that he was interviewed by FBI agency says they interviewed him in his hotel room at the Trump Hotel in Washington DC asking about his comments during the presidential campaign indicating that a big surprise was coming and that was right before the Russian the hack of the dancing well that's right and remember Rudy Giuliani can't hold himself out as an attorney and asked for attorney-client privilege during that time because he was simply a campaign supporter not acting as an attorney representing Donald Trump so that makes sense I actually think Ron is actually completely right and Giuliani falls in this category of someone who has not shockingly given his history not behaved as someone with a strong understanding of the law which is rather surprising and it wasn't specified whether Rudy Giuliani was interviewed for the Inspector General's report and he's not mentioned in the inspector general's report as someone they interviewed and they seem to mention everyone they interviewed or whether he was being questioned in the robert muller investigation right and acts whichever one he was questioned in Robert Muller can still use it even if he didn't question him so it does it will it is interesting what he may have said we don't have any indication that Rudy Giuliani had any direct information about what was transpiring during the campaign on that front we know that Roger stone was already making those statements publicly right about what would be forthcoming so I think the real question here is there is a lot of Keystone Cops here and that we know that Michael Cohen has always been a big question mark in terms of whether he would flip and if he flips how he connects Donald Trump potentially to a whole range of potential crimes my Wylie and Ron Klain thank you both for joining us tonight really appreciate it thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by
