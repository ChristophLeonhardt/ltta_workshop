control walkout continues and I'm getting tons of the emails from kids who feel like they were essentially discriminated against at these walk outs I just got one from a kid who wrote to me and said that he wanted that he wasn't intending on being political at this walkout he waited until people brought out the gun control signs then he brought up the Gadsden flag and he was immediately shut down by his school he's immediately told he had to put it away and this is not rare I'm getting again tons of these emails on a minute-by-minute basis at this point it's it's pretty it's pretty astonishing and pretty shocking and demonstrates once again that there are too many teachers across the country who think that they get to propagandize and use their students as these propaganda outlets now not every teacher is in favor of this in fact there many teachers who are not in favor of this and there are lots of states like California where you have to be a member of a teacher's union in order to teach and if you are a member of a teacher's union you are expected to toe the party line and one of the close family friends of ours growing up was a guy who is a member of the teachers unions because he had to be and he would constantly get the updates from the teachers unions and they were all left-wing updates this is a coordinated effort from the top and it really is quite awful one teacher has actually been suspended for questioning the gun control walkout her name is Julian julienne Ben Zell and she says that she opened up the discussion in her classroom about the politics of the protest and she was subsequently told to stay home on Wednesday because the administration didn't like it here's what she had to say on CBS 13 local others in Northern California boolean benzoyl says she never discouraged her students for participating in national school walkout but she did question whether it's appropriate for a school to support a protest against gun violence if it's not willing to support all protests it's the best example I thought of at the time if a group of students nationwide or even locally decided I want to walk out of school for 17 minutes and go in the quad area and protest abortion okay and she's of course exactly right if the students decided to walk out and protest abortion they would have no capacity to and none of the teachers would sponsor it right but because this is a national gun anti-gun walkout all the students were expected to walk out I've gotten notes from students who say that they wanted to stay in class because they didn't feel like creating a hubbub they were just gonna stay inside the school and they've actually been getting notes from teachers you know threats of suspension for staying in the school during the walkout so it's it's really astonishing stuff and it demonstrates once and for all that something really nefarious has happened in a lot of our public schools and that is our public schools have become a tool for the left-wing propaganda okay they really have especially in in classes like social science I know what what they used to call history but now they call social science you know those classes our social studies rather those classes I've been taking over by the left and this is why so many parents are pulling their kids out of public school and putting their kids in private school they're saying you're not even doing a good job of insuring that my kids are getting an education but you can certainly ensure that my kids get to walk out a class and miss class in order to make a political statement that has nothing to do with their education because of course these kids can't vote their parents can if their parents want to do something they are free to lobby why these kids should be leaving school in order to do what they're doing that is beyond me it doesn't seem like it makes any sense at all but again these teachers are political actors and teachers unions are political activists schools of thought that's what they do if you look at just how teachers unions work the way they bargain with the state is they are basically democratic tools and that was predicted long ago by Olivia von mises in his book bureaucracy talking about how any employee of the state ends up being a propaganda outlet for the state and this is certainly true with regard to teachers unions because the way it works with teachers unions is you want to support Democrats because if you elect Democrats Democrats will then give you a cozy union payout and that's the way that it works in the state of California or the CalPERS system for example is bankrupting the state where teachers have signed union contracts with the state they give them these very very rich pensions and these pensions are trillions of dollars unpaid trillions of dollars at least hundreds of billions of dollars and the state lies about it and the state says well don't worry we're gonna pay out we'll never have to tax people additionally because we're just gonna have certain growth rate in the CalPERS fund none of that's ever going to happen but again if you're a teachers union then this is all great for you all you have to do support Democratic policies and get Democratic politicians elected with all of the union dues that the teachers pay in and the state mandates that you pay your union dues in order to work save this guild and this guild is mandated by the state you have to work for the guild in order to work for the schools and then the guild take some of your money and pays those politicians to keep that that system going keep that rig system going and those politicians get to push legislation and all they ask in return is that the teachers unions push all of their ancillary causes and that's what a lot of these teachers unions are doing it's really shocking and appalling and again most of these students who are walking out have no political bent one way or another it's not like most of these students who are walking out are passionate about gun control the vast majority of students who walked out probably have no idea anything about gun control they probably don't know any facts about gun control in fact there are some students who are walking out just because they want to walk out and go do stupid things like this is film from Chicago students walked out and they proceeded to trash a Walmart for no reason so these students charged into a Walmart and they upturned all the stalls I like the security guards laughing about it well done security guards but it's just a monster who the fact that young people sometimes are stupid this does not mean that all young people who walked out don't have any political knowledge some of them do some of them are politically active some who oppose my position some who support my position some who are in favor of Second Amendment rights some who are in favor of gun control but to pretend that all of these students are the wisest and fairest of all beings they're the elves in our little morality play of middle-earth it's just it's foolish and it's not true at all especially when you look at what actually happened in Broward County so this video came out yesterday and it really is shocking it's video from Broward County of the sheriff's deputy right this is the on school site deputy and he obviously first of all does not look like he should be on school site security one of the big problems that you see when you talk about in school security is very often these are rented cops very often these are people who could not pass a physical these are people who could not run a block without losing their breath is not everybody who's a school deputy obviously but it is true for a certain number of them and it is important that you have some people who actually are in good shape know what they're doing this guy I don't feel bad ripping on because you'll see in the video that they hear the gunshots he takes off on his little golf cart to go over to the area where the shooting is happening and then you'll see in the video he stands around and does nothing for 20 minutes here's what it looked like when the when the Broward County Sheriff's Office released the tape so you can see him it's a silent video so I'll narrate it you can see him and Scott Peterson the BSO school resource officer who looks like he's maybe in his 50s and he drives it over to the area where the shooting is happening and then he proceeds to legitimately just standing outside the building he's just standing around outside the building doing nothing I mean it's an amazing thing right and he there's there's part of this video that we cut out where he can actually see students fleeing the building through another one of these doors does he charge in does he do anything no and according to the Broward County Sheriff's Office the orders that are given to their officers are that if there is an act of school shooting you are supposed to engage we're not supposed to stand outside so to talk about how these guys were told that they were supposed to stand outside how that was the policy of the department that was not true so there's there's one problem with the department with regard to policy and that is this policy that says we're not going to arrest anyone because we don't want to increase the arrest statistics on students we want to show that our students are doing really well and so we'll just pretend that no crime is going on but this one looks like it was on Scott Peterson and not on the Broward County Sheriff's Office per se nonetheless this is not stopping the agenda from rolling forward mika brzezinski over at MSNBC she says the NRA should be sued and things have changed at least in the state of Florida the NRA with their inflammatory ads and threatening ads should be sued okay well on what grounds do the NRA be sued in order for you to sue somebody you actually have to have legal grounds there actually has to be a legal purpose for the suit otherwise we'll be thrown out but according to so many people on the Left lawsuits happen when you're angry at something so you don't like the NRA says you get to throw it out can the NRA was not responsible for the shooting one of the most astonishing things I saw yesterday was Code Pink calling for an end to funding for JROTC on campus they're saying well we don't want campuses militarized we need to stop funding JROTC there are three kids who were killed were members of JROTC and one of those kids actually threw himself in front of bullets to save other kids well this idiot cop was standing around outside doing nothing one of these students a fifteen year old he ran out there and he tried to stop the shooter already got in the way of the bullets he saved his students he died in the process and code pink is saying she got rid of JROTC again the big problem with evil is that evil cannot be prevented simply by legal mechanisms usually evil can only be prevented by good people it can only be prevented by good people doing the right things and unfortunately the left is not ones who recognize the real possibility of human evil they're just not interested in recognizing that possibility it's pretty it's pretty horrible so meanwhile president Trump is is embracing this new bill the school safety bill and the school safety bill really does not have much gun control attached so everybody on the Left is of course very upset about that they thought that President Trump was going to break the impasse on on school on gun control that of course was never really going to happen so in just a few minutes I'm gonna talk about what exactly is in the school safety bill and we'll talk about that but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Dollar Shave Club so and get up in the morning you look you look at yourself in the mirror and you see that you need to shave but

of Senators and it doesn't do anything about gun control per se but it does do some things about school security so there is no parallel measure pending in the Senate right now they're trying to push gun control in the Senate of course but that's not going to happen this bill is instead a bill that doesn't allow that that is seeking to increase security schools so the the it does not allow any of the funding to any of the funding that's going to be given for school security be used for arming teacher or other school personnel the the White House wants that restriction lifted but the bill itself is filled with some measures that are designed to ensure that that this stuff doesn't happen again or at least that there's better security on campus is funded by the federal government so the school safety bill let me bring up the actual provisions of the bill right here so the school safety bill is let's see it passed by an overwhelming margin by the way in the House of Representatives it is not yet been brought brought up as I say before the Senate again all the people I'm left a very upset because they think the only measure that can be taken here is going to be gun control but it steers clear of the demands of gun control advocates it is the stop school violence Act it provides 50 million dollars a year for a new federal grant program to train students teachers and law enforcement how to spot and report signs of gun violence it also develops anonymous telephone and online systems where people could report threats of violence and authorizes 25 million dollars for schools to beef up security in ways such as installing new locks metal detectors and panic buttons okay so this is a good start ok White House Democrats overwhelmingly supported the school safety sorry the House Democrats overwhelmingly supported the school safety measure according to the hill but they say this doesn't do enough Republicans say this is only beginning this is the first steps and ok these should be the first steps obviously I think that the states should actually take precedence here I'm not sure that the federal government should be leading the way on any of this stuff in the first place but I think that it is it is pretty clear that these that the school the school safety bill should pass with flying colors through the Senate ok meanwhile this is another story that that I think is worth talking about Huffington Post has done something pretty amazing so Huffington Post is the is obviously a very left-wing outlet and the deputy opinion editor of The Huffington Post is a person named Chloe angle okay Chloe angle triumphantly tweeted out the demographics of people they have published this year it just shows how crazy the left has become with regard to their politics of intersectionality here's what they say month two of HuffPost opinion is almost done this month we published 63 percent women including trans women 53% writers of color our goals for this month war less than 50% white authors Asian representation that matches or exceeds the u.s. population more trans and non-binary authors and then say we also wanted to raise latinx representation to mattre exceed the u.s. population we didn't achieve that goal but we're moving firmly in the right direction making the improvements we made took work no doubt about it we all tapped our networks and made moves to expand our collective rolodex I check our numbers at the end of the week because it's easy to lose track or imagine you're doing better than you really are and the numbers don't lie the numbers also don't tell the whole story about disability geography socio economics and more but the work is not owner Asst and it's definitely not impossible if we can do it every other opinion page can do it too and if you have an op-ed to pitch here's how you can do that so what I love about this is the deputy opinion page editor over at The Huffington Post doesn't make any case with regard to the quality of the submissions over at Huffington Post there's nothing to be said here about how great Huffington Post quality is instead all they care about is the racial breakdown of the people writing which used to be called racial quotas and we're obviously Latin X sorry not latinx okay this is all supposed to be a guarantor not of quality on the page but instead a guarantee a guarantor of of demographic equality but what's really funny about this is that if you're actually gonna be demographically equal on the Huffington Post page maybe about 70 percent whites it would be 50 percent males it would be 90 percent straight it would be almost 0% transgender it's this point three point three percent of the US population is transgender but they're not trying to do that diversity only exists for those who are marginalized groups and those marginalized groups must now become a majority according to the left all of this is incredibly stupid and has nothing to do with the quality of the work on these pages so pretty astonishing stuff okay meanwhile President Trump continues to forge forth on his anti free trade program and this is obviously not good policy Tucker Carlson made the best case on this last night there there are a bunch of folks who are on the who are on the Trump side of the aisle who are trying to make the case for tariffs who are trying to make the case for protectionism my problem with tariffs and protectionism obviously is that they believe in the power of centralized government here's Tucker trying to make his strongest case for technology and and trade being the downfall of American civilization it's not a horrible case but I don't think it's a convincing one either lawmakers in both parties for example have heartily embraced self-driving vehicles and drone delivery of packages it's all impressive technology but what would be the effect on employment has anyone asked that there are more than 3 million professional truck drivers in this country it is the most common job in the majority of American States more than 90 percent of drivers are men thanks technology many of these men are about to lose their jobs it's a lot of unemployed Americans that's a lot of broken families Washington is not worried at all about this lawmakers and business leaders assure us that those truck drivers will be just fine they'll find something else to do something better in fact with higher pay and maybe they will but keep in mind our leaders said the very same thing about manufacturing jobs 30 years ago ok so this is a what Tucker points out here is I think a generalized argument can always be made in favor of centralized government what he's saying is there's a group of people in the United States they are uh no lower educated white men basically these are these are people who are living in the middle of the country and people who are working in non technology jobs these are people who are working on lines these are people who are truck drivers and these people are going to be hurt by technology and trade and we have to do something for these people but the implication is and throughout this monologue was that these people if they're not taking care of number one that they are going to not get married they're not going to stick around for their wives and children that they are going to start acting in worse ways there are a couple of assumptions embedded in Tucker's in Tucker's the notion here that I think are problematic so what problem number one is he seems to suggest that poverty and lack of job opportunity cause immorality I don't actually think that's the case I think that moral people tend to act morally whether they are poor or whether they are rich there are lots of terrible rich people there are lots of wonderful poor people there are lots of people who make a lot of money in their jobs and there are lots of money and they lots people make very little money and all of them go to the same church so when Tucker suggests that you know people who are earning a lower wage you're suddenly going to not stick around for their kids I'm not sure I see the correlation there or at least I'm going to resist the correlation the other thing is that this is not really a case for tariffs it's not really a case for shutting down traders shutting down technology so I'm not sure what Tucker is actually arguing for I agree that a lot of this stuff is a problem I agree that we have a problem with people who are not law lawyers or doctors people who don't have higher education degrees and what do we do with them as the does the technology develops and they lose their jobs what do we do with those folks but the answer is not to cyfle the technology tucker seems to be making the case against self-driving trucks okay but you could have made that exact same case against cars back in 1910 you could have said they're a bunch of wheelwright so we're going to lose their jobs this is true with every technological change every single one they're a bunch of people who lost their jobs over at 80 when people stopped using landlines there are a bunch of folks who lost their jobs when when dial-up internet went away there are a bunch of people who lose their jobs when you when any new technology is developed they're a bunch of people who lose their jobs the question is are a consummate number of jobs created on the other end are there more jobs that are created on the other end or just as many jobs created and by the way that isn't even really the question the question is does quality of life go up for the vast majority of Americans every time there's a technological change because the goal of an economy is not to create jobs the goal of jobs is to create an economy meaning the purpose of a job is to create a product or service someone else wants to buy it is not the job of the economy per se or the government per se to ensure that anyone has a job if you get that polarity backwards you end up the communism where everybody has a job but they're not producing anything anybody wants centralized government is not the answer here now there was a piece that I referenced a little bit yesterday I want to go through in a little more detail here regarding tariffs there's a piece over at the Journal of American greatness the Journal of American greatness was an outlet devoted to president Trump's purported philosophy and it's kind of lost some of its luster because President Trump doesn't have really a coherent philosophy but there was a piece there that was taking on something I said on the show about free trade and this piece is by a guy named Spencer Morrison who's a law student and editor-in-chief of the national economics editorial which I've never heard of and here's what he says he says McKee's titled why Ben Shapiro is wrong on free trade now let's just make something clear my perspective on free trade is backed by essentially 100% of economists there very few economists who believe in tariffs when I say very few I mean that if you if you polled actual economists the number of economists who would dismiss free trade in favor of tariffs that number is very close to zero so here is what this article says I think it's worth discussing in detail so Morrison argues in favor of tariffs and it begins with analysis of a three-minute segment of video from this podcast in which I talked about the flaws in tariff based economics I specifically talked in that segment about the fact that trade deficits don't matter about the fact that if you have a trade deficit with your grocery store your grocery store is not screwing you nor are you being screwed by your grocery store and if we buy more product from China than China buys from us that does not mean that we are losing to China China just has a bunch of dollars it has to spend which then has to invest back in American bonds or back in American businesses or an American real estate now obviously I've done a lot of work on tariffs on the show but there's a new argument that Morrison presents that I think that you should know about just so that you know what you're talking about when you talk about free trade so first Morrison sort of misrepresents my argument he suggests that I think trade deficits are an act of good I've never said trade deficits hard act of good they're not an act of good they're not an act of bad they're just a thing right you sometimes have a trade deficit with your grocery store sometimes you're a contractor to your grocery store and you have a trade surplus none of that means that anything inherently bad or good is going on as I've quoted before Thomas Hall says this in general international deficits and surpluses have had virtually no correlation with the performance of most nations economies Germany and France have had international trade surpluses while there unemployment rates were in double digits Japan's post-war rise to economic prominence on the world stage included years when it ran deficits as well as years when it ran surpluses the US was the biggest debtor nation in the world during its rise to industrial supremacy became a creditor as a result of lending money to its European allies during the First World War and has been both a debtor and a creditor at various times since through it all the American standard of living has remained the highest in the world unaffected by whether it was a creditor or a debtor nation now Morrison is this author who claims that I have called Trump a flip-flopper on fair trade which I never have he's been very clear that he's anti free trade but here's the central argument that's made and this is the one that I think we should spend some time talking about just so that you know the arguments that are being made against free trade and why they are wrong so here's what Morrison says he talks about comparative advantage comparative advantages this idea let's say that I Ben Shapiro I am great at making this podcast but I also happen to be very good at growing oranges I'm pretty good at it not like the best but pretty good right and let's see that I can even make I can even grow origins better than my local grocery store but I am the very best at making this podcast so every minute that I spend not growing oranges is a minute that I spend on the podcast and every minute that I spend on the podcast is a minute I spend not growing oranges should I spend my time doing Kaster should I spend my time growing oranges the answer of course is that I should take all the money I'm earning from the podcast and go buy some oranges at a cheaper price the time value right the money the monetary value of my time is higher doing the thing that I am best at even if it means that I'm buying from somebody else who's specializing in an area where I'm still the best but it's just not the best thing I do and I'm better at the podcast and I'm a growing oranges therefore I should spend more of my time doing the podcast than growing oranges even if the second-best guy growing oranges is not as good as I am at it right he should specialize in growing oranges I should specialize in podcasting and then we should trade services for one another I should give him a subscription for $9.99 a month and he should give me a bag of oranges right this is the idea of comparative advantage so here's what Morrison says his comparative advantage is an elegant theory but too often is domain-specific it only works when certain preconditions are met for example capital must be immobile for the theory to apply okay meaning that Mike I can't just take my capital and go buy a an orange farm in Brazil now Shapiro ignores this crucial limiting factor and applies comparative advantage to just about everything this is his root error for example comparative advantage suggests the key to getting rich is to specialize production regardless of what you produce that is a country with comparative advantage in growing soybeans should focus on growing more soybeans while a country with comparative advantage and manufacturing semiconductors should focus on manufacturing more semiconductors in either case this supposes the relative wealth will correlate with the degree of specialization as opposed to the complexity of their production this is objectively wrong so what he says is that if you're a country the producer semiconductors are gonna be richer than a country the producer soybeans there's only a there are a bunch of problems with this so first of all it is important to note that countries don't just make soybeans or semiconductors right they make lots of products countries are not individuals countries are broad amalgams of individuals all of whom are in different industries right so this guy says well you know this guy makes the the obvious point that if you grow on bananas you're gonna make less money than if you make computers this is obviously true ok but of course countries that develop higher profit sectors are gonna have higher growth rates and of course the decisions that you make now are gonna have impact on the future development of industry so this is his second argument he says ok so granted that a country that grows bananas makes less money than a country that makes semiconductors so if you are a banana growing country comparative advantage would suggest you keep bananas but that means that you're never going to become in the semiconductor making country therefore what you should really do is you should tariffs semiconductors you should put a tariff on floor and semiconductors and then you should grow your business and semiconductors from the inside ok this neglects a few points has neglects a few points first of all you cannot tell which sectors of an economy are likely to be the most profitable right this is something called the what he's talking about here is a term called path dependency path dependency is you made a mistake you decide to grow bananas and now you're sucker own bananas forever even if it would be more profitable for you to move in to move into making semiconductors but this assumes that you can't just stop making bananas and start making semiconductors it assumes there's no bank that will lend you money if you get a computer education degree to go make semiconductors right this assumes there's no mobility in the economy which of course is not true and if the government were to say listen we're going to tariffs semiconductors we're gonna tax all the banana growers and take all their money and we're gonna use it to subsidize semiconductors who's to say the government knows which industry is going to grow fastest when government introduces subsidies into an industry it usually makes that industry little more profitable but it doesn't end up picking the industry that always works it is a very important point ok let's say let's take Trump steel tariffs Trump thinks the steel industry is very very important so he's going to tax all of us that's what a tariff is and then he's gonna take that money and he's gonna give it to the steel industry it's the same thing as a tax in a subsidy that's all the tariff is the tariff is I'm gonna pay more for my car so that my money will go to the steel industry that's Trump saying he thinks the steel industry is particularly important but how does Trump know the steel industry is particularly important how does he know the future of what technological development is going to look like now there's a notion that you have to protect the steel industry from foreign predation but why why I mean for security reasons you could but there's no indication that security is the problem here what's happening here is that Trump likes steel in a way he doesn't like other industry so heat things steel ought to be protected but what does Trump know that the economy doesn't this is the whole reason centralized government fails one guy at the top does not know as much about how products and services should move as the entire economy as this diffuse hands of the market you and I choosing on our own what we want to buy and what we want to sell right you can't tell which sectors are going to be the most profitable and the government is actually far more likely to lock in particular path dependency right now your path dependent on steel in the United States or dependent on semiconductors then to spur future economic growth and also most market Lakhan is self-correcting we develop new products on a routine basis that are different in kind from the products that preceded them so the argument for path dependency that you pick a winner and now you're stuck or you pick up an industry now you're stuck it doesn't really hold the in the sort of example that people use when they talk about path dependency and trade there's the example of your QWERTY keyboard right there's this myth that there are two types of keyboard there's the QWERTY keyboard that everybody has on their on their laptop and then there is the Dvorak keyboard that was invented at the same time as supposedly as faster hey number one there's no evidence that it's faster number two the cost of moving away from the QWERTY keyboard and towards something else have to be taken into account when we say why don't we switch to a more efficient keyboard in other words there are costs a you could say we should have picked the Dvorak keyboard that would have been better but now they're cost attached to switching so the argument is well then maybe government should have subsidized the Dvorak keyboard for example but that doesn't make sense because the government didn't know the Dvorak keyboard was better and if the market had known that Dvorak keyboard was better than it would have picked the Dvorak keyboard but that's not what happened right so if we could see the future at the bottom line is that people who are in favor of tariffs think that certain industries are more important than others and that government can see the future and has to protect those industries but that makes no sense in 1947 the smart money in the United States would have been unsubsidized anon subsidizing manufacturing taxing all other industries in the United States to subsidize manufacturing and that would've been totally wrong in 1947 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis Manufacturing represents a quarter of all GDP production in the United States finance represented 10.3% agriculture represented 8 percent those would have been the three industries to dump money into but if we attacks agriculture and Finance to finance manufacturing that would've been stupid by 2016 Manufacturing had fallen to eleven point seven percent of GDP and Finance represents in 21 percent agriculture represented 1 percent so if we had had the government picking and choosing winners and losers we would have put our money in the wrong place this is why central planning usually fails Paul David of Stanford University writes from the foregoing and maybe seeing that a proper understanding of path dependence and of possibilities of externalities leading to market failure is not without interesting implications for economic policy but those are not all the sorts and glib conclusions that some critics have alleged must follow if one believes that history really matters namely the government should try to pick winners rather than let markets make mistakes quite the contrary public policy could try to delay the market from committing to the future inextricably before enough information has been obtained about the likely technical or organizational legal implications of an early precedent-setting decision in other words government picking and choosing winners actually ensures past dependency it ensures market lock-in impoverishing private sectors through tariffs in order to dump money into non competitive industries actually impoverishes your country as a whole economic flexibility requires that the government should not impede the free flow of capital within industries and what about the idea that if your banana in producing economy you'll never become a software producing economy there's no proof of that private lenders will pay the freight for new industries right the United States again used to be a manufacturing economy and then it became a service economy this happens it happens all the time so the central argument here just doesn't work in favor of tariffs and I think that that is worth noting ok so I have a lot more to talk about including an insane retraction that was pushed out by Pro Publica about a trump nominee in just a second first you're gonna have to go over to Daley

YouTube please subscribe please leave us a review we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so moving on from trade policy the Trump administration is still having high turnover there was a tweet earlier today from reporter talking about somebody inside the the Trump administration who said they were expecting large moves inside the administration something is coming we don't know what it is which is not a helpful report from the reporters but the turnover is very high well one of the people who's been elevated by the turnover is the new CIA nominee the new CIA director nominee whose name is Gina Haslam we talked about this yesterday about how Senator Rand Paul tore into Haspel suggesting that she had overseen torture in foreign lands and it turns out that is not true okay he was basing that off of a ProPublica article that was printed yesterday they had to issue this retraction the story said that Haspel a career CIA officer who president Trump has nominated to be the next director of Central Intelligence oversaw the clandestine base while our Abu Zubaydah terrorist was subjected to waterboarding and other coercive interrogation methods that are widely seen as torture the story also said she mocked the prisoners suffering in a private conversation neither of these assertions is correct and we were tracked them it is now clear that Haspel did not check take charge of the base until after the interrogation of Zubaydah ended so this is obviously a pretty egregious error but it shows that people on the left are really invested in trying to suggest that trumps nominees are awful awful people also they're very invested in the narrative that there's a lot of chaos at the White House now there is some cast at the White House there's no question there are a lot of people in the White House who are wondering what in the world is going on there are a series of competing rumors yesterday they were pretty amazing there was one that chief of staff John Kelly was going to be leaving there was one that NSA the the NSA general McMaster was going to be leaving there was one that the VA secretary was going to be leaving the administration keeps trying to tamp down these rumors but it's hard to tamp them down when the President of the United States is constantly ripping his own cabinet members on Twitter and also when he says things publicly about how he likes to watch them fight like like that guy from Godzilla let them fight he likes to watch his cabinet officers jockey for position there was rumor that Scott Pruett over the EPA was on the hot seat there's where the Ben Carson is on the hot seat there's a rumor that that Bryan's inky is on the hot seat so they're a bunch of rumors they're like half his cabinets gonna be gone but Sarah Huckabee Sanders yesterday was saying don't worry McMaster is not going anywhere of course they were saying the same thing about Gary Cohn five seconds ago here is Sarah Sanders when she tweeted out she said just spoke to POTUS and general HR McMaster contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC okay that's not convincing considering again that they've said this about every person who has ever left the administration Kellyanne Conway came out said they keep recycling rumors but the rumors have no Verity to them here's what she had to say they won't cover policy they cover personnel they won't cover principal they cover palace intrigue and they keep on recycling rumors and stories constantly that have no basis in fact they think they figure hey if a stop clock is at least Right twice a day eventually I'll get this right so if I predict a whole year in advance so once I was on thin ice silence I was going to go and they do a year later I could just recycle those clips where people said the president has full confidence in X and six months a year later it changes this president has every right to put the team around him that he thinks aligns with his vision his values but he is the one who controls the tiny the cone tone and content of all substantive and personnel decisions so obviously the president has the right to do whatever he wants on personnel that's really not the question the question is is it good that there's this much turnover well some of the turnover is good like Rex Tillerson leaving the Secretary of State is good and there's so much turmoil at the administration though that that was like the sixth biggest story of the week that the Secretary of State was booted out of office by the president normally there'd be a pretty big story instead that is downgraded to to the lower end of the spectrum listen if Trump wants to make some moves he should rip off the mandate he should make his moves you should be done the prolonged feeling of chaos is not good for the administration they have some things to do and it's not worthwhile to have them dragging this process out over long periods of time I recommend to the administration that they just get on what they need to get done because it's otherwise it's it's putting too much pressure on the American public to go along with the daily reality show that's happening at the White House I know a lot of president Trump supporters don't seem to care that's fine but the American people do care not because they're sitting around waiting for the next tweet to fire somebody but because they do want a feeling of steady leadership at the White House now Obama was not a steady leader but the media ensured that he felt like a steady leader even though he was not right there they would continue to put out this vision of Obama as cool as a cucumber guy which I don't think the evidence is quite there for but there not therefore Trump right they're going to up the amount of cancer Trump has to be twice as cool as anybody else has been in the office and I don't know that that's actually going to happen okay so you know what let's take some actual time with the mailbag today we'll go back to things I like and things I hate at the very end of the show but let's go straight to the mailbag today so get in your questions right now we'll just jump right in all right we begin today with Hendrix so Hendrix says if you just has to rock music why does your show start with an electric guitar so I don't detest all rock music Hendrick number one number two my show starts with an electric guitar because that is the the electric guitar is being played by the brother of the founder of the company one of the founders of the company and we didn't want to pay rights to to actually buy musical cuts to use here so instead we just had a guy play two notes pretty awesome right okay so Jay James says hi Ben I don't know if you've ever been asked about these particular questions but I'm sure it's highly likely your background in debate and evidence-based arguments as well established when it comes to the evidence concerning the existence of God is the citation of an accepted religious tome of Authority enough or is a considered conjecture and/or not substantial enough could a rational argument based on biblical evidence hold up in a rational legal court of law if the idea of God were put on trial quota or rather would ardent atheists like Sam Harris or Richard Harrow Dawkins find any substantive reason to find your arguments compelling enough to consider the religious position as tenable or the minds of such intellectuals closed off to the possibility of God to the point that any argument made by a believer would be seen as reaching and circular such as the arguments for the existence of God made by Descartes and his meditations treatise in short is there any actual evidence in your mind that would hold water and a legal proceeding or can faith in law and out reasonably coexist without one co-opting the other in one way or another Jim okay so Jim I will say that I think that logical proofs of God tend to whack yeah I think you can make a logical argument for God but that's not the same as a logical proof of God because God hides himself in the universe right this is the basic religious tenet God is a incorporeal he doesn't manifest himself at least in Judaism right there's no idea of God actually taking corporeal form in the form of Jesus for example so in Judaism and in this true in Islam as well and even in Christianity where God has not taken human form for the last two thousand years there is a feeling that God hides himself in the universe that God is something you have to discover making an argument for the existence of God is possible in fact I've recommend in a book by Edward fazer philosophy professor / Grove City College in Pasadena who who has written a very good I think it's a Grove he may be a Pasadena City College night guys he's written a very good book up five proofs of the existence of God and he has an Aquinas proof and he has and he has a he has a proof from Pascal and he has a bunch of different proofs and some of them I find pretty compelling but at best you can make a probabilistic case for God it's very difficult to make an onion evidentiary case for God because any piece of evidence in favor of God can also be interpreted against God so if you say look at the beauty of the universe the Atheist will say right that beauty of the universe was created through sheer accident or there are multiple universes if you say God made this universe in a particular way and the chances of the universe being made in this particular way to sustain human life are really really really unlikely then folks on the other side a theist will say well what if there are multiple universes what if there are parallel universes or what if God ruled that what if time is endless and gods rule and and the dice have been rolled of a bajillion times right you know in other words these arguments come to a standstill the best argument for God that I believe exists there there are two arguments for God that I think are compelling and again I don't think they are provable but I think that are compelling one is that there is a system of logic that undergirds the universe that is the basis for all human thought in science right science is the idea that you are discovering under the you are discovering consistent rules in the universe that pre-exists your being and there's an objective truth that would exist regardless of your presence on earth and so the religious person says that's proof of a designer that these rules exist and the more you study the rules of the universe the more you are shocked by the by the genius that created them now atheists will say there was no genius that created them right this is all accident you're just a speck of dust moving through the universe on the meaningless rock you're a ball of meat moving without sentience through through life right you have a basic idea that you're here but you don't really have control right which brings us to the second argument in favor of God and that is the argument of free will the argument that you have something that allows you to supersede your own biological necessity and make choices every single day and that all of civilization is based on this premise and then in fact all of a co6 thought - is based on this premise because until very recently both most atheists believed in the concept of free will if you go back to the French Revolution and and Enlightenment thinkers even people like Laplace are then a bunch of folks who are who are Enlightenment thinkers were atheists who believed in at least a very contains notion of free well now folks like Sam Harris I think are really consistent on this right Sam says there is no such thing as free well and he doesn't try to make the compatibilist argument that is made by some advocates of non free well where they say well you know everything is biologically determined but at the same time there is a sense of free will because there is chaos built into the system that's not free will it's just chaos built into the system actually agree with Sam on this I agree there are only two real positions on freewill right there's the hard freewill position there's a bility to choose otherwise and then there's the and then there is the deterministic position which is that you in this situation right now have no choice but to behave as you are behaving if you believe in free will which is an experiential thing if you believe like Samuel Johnson right that it's it's tana logical that let's not argue about freewill it's here if you believe that it's very difficult not to believe that there is at least some force in the universe that you just do not understand and that cannot be explained by all it cannot be explained away by physical laws and that at least gets you to a place where there's a supernatural element to life that we just don't connect with or understand and then you can move beyond there - is there a logic to that supernatural presence that unites creation right so those are the arguments in favor of God again their arguments I don't think that they are completely provable and I don't I'm not gonna pretend that I can prove to Sam Harris or mantle hunty or anybody else on the on the Atheist left that that God exists I just don't think that it's possible to prove God exists and I think that that's one of God's points right as a believer in God I think God does not want you to be able to prove God exists if I could provide you proof right now here and now that God existed then obeying God's law would be the easiest thing in the world because you wouldn't have a choice maybe the argument would be God exists and then if I could prove to you just through sheer evidence that the Bible was given by God it's the is the unadulterated Word of God then you would not have a choice the creator of the universe has in order to do things you must do these things or the punishments that God provides engine in the in the Bible will come true but I don't think God wants us to behave that way I think God's whole purpose and creating the world was to create beings in His image meaning they have free will and the capacity to create and choose people who believe by the way they have free will and the capacity to create and choose as my friend Jordan Peterson likes to say people who are trying to generate order from chaos these are people who find fulfillment and purpose in life it's very difficult to build either an individual or collective system of meaning on the basis of your meatball floating through space Kyle says what do you think the world would be like if there was a second she's on earth as intelligence as humans well you know I think that we'd have conversations with them and I think we'd have to take into account common interests frankly I do think that there are such differences between people that we are not separate species but there's enough for us to talk about to get past our differences men and women are different enough that having conversations that way is hard enough as it is adding a second species would would make things even more difficult Jewell says how can we innovate music only one and genre is correct in your case classical you can innovate within classical music right Stravinsky is very different from Beethoven Bartok Bartok is incredibly different from Brahms there are certain rules that you can imagine abiding by and still work within those rules in fact I think most great art is created within the confines of particular rules I think most great novels are written in complete sentences I think most great novels are written using typical rules of human English in fact I think that they're they're a few that break the rules but most of the anomalies that break those rules at least know where the rules are right if you read ken kesey right who's a fan of breaking grammatical rules or if you read or if you read a Clockwork Orange in which an entire new language is developed all of that is based on knowledge of the rules and then specific breaking of the rules to a particular end a feeling of chaos a feeling of newness a feeling of generating language beyond our typical language all of that can be broken but that's not what rock does rock is not people who learn the rules and then decided in order fashion to bend or break them it's a bunch of people who don't know the rules who play who hit the who hit they drum on two and four and who play three chords and that's not breaking the rules that is not only not breaking the rules it's not even it doesn't even acknowledge that the rules exist and so you actually ends up with a much more primitive form of music than anything that was developed in the Classical era Daniel says what are your thoughts on elderly firearm ownership should the restricter rules for people over a certain age to purchase firearms no but I think that you should be able to apply if people are have dementia to have those guns removed from people's homes I'm not sure that age is a good argument that our 80 year olds capable of having a weapon if you're a law-abiding citizen and you need to defend yourself I don't see the problem with you owning a shotgun you know that said if you are senile then I do see the problem with you owning a shotgun Jim says I've heard you use the phrase the proof is in the pudding and shortly after I heard Michael Mills point out that the original saying is the proof of the pudding is in the eating do you think this is a targeted correction and how does it feel to be corrected by best-selling author Michael Knowles thanks love the show well James I can't believe that put you in the mailbag but I will say that just because the original saying was the proof of the pudding is in the eating does not mean that the proof is in the pudding is not the modern saying or at least the bastardization of that saying so it's less a correction than I think in the day and an addendum by Michael Mills and Michael has corrected me on occasion about things like writing words and books that apparently was a complete waste of time but it does not feel good to be corrected by Michael Knowles listen I've had to pay him more money than I thought humanly possible right he works for me means I pay my salary I lost a bet to him our relationship is not going well Veronica's his Haven I had an idea for a youtube series when I talked about struggling with depression anxiety I hope to use my experiences to help others realize they can reach out to their families and communities with their struggles and get the help they need my only worry is that if I admit to some of the darker problems I faced I could lose my second Amendment rights I haven't ever attempted suicide and has been years since the worst of my depression but I live in New Jersey and gun laws are tough to begin with my fiancee also worries that this may affect his ownership rights when we lived together am i worrying over nothing or am i right to be hesitating well I don't know what the current status in law is in New Jersey but typically you have to prove that someone is a current danger to themselves or others not that they once had issues with depression ten years ago five years ago two years ago you actually have to have hard proof that somebody is a threat to themselves or others you don't sound like that's the threat I think that your series sounds like a wonderful thing I think there are a lot of people out there who are suffering with depression and anxiety who don't even know what it is they are suffering with and a little solidarity along those lines would be a perfectly wonderful thing jordan says Haven the Libertarian Party today posted on Twitter that they support the students and their political works from the walkout yesterday why would the libertarian party support gun control so I haven't seen the post so I'm gonna hesitate - a tribute to I'll take you out your word okay if what you are saying is correct assuming what you're saying is correct that's because the libertarian party is ridiculous in the ran Gary Johnson for presidents of the United States twice hey this party's in disarray it's really frustrating because as a conservative / libertarian I would love to see a vital and working libertarian party but this is the party that trots out John McAfee at their at their events and then also trots out a naked guy wearing an Iron Cross tattoos so I'm gonna go with their crazy at least the party Pete says hi Ben I'm with you on the immigration question let's keep those that are behaving in accordance with American values and customs playing the tape before it concerns me however say the wall does get built what happens then does the black labor market disappear how our labor law is going to change what benefits our guest worker is going to be entitled to it unreasonable for me to have doubts as to the ability of the US government to administer such a program effectively really you're never wrong in doubting the ability of the US government to administer any program effectively but the idea here would be that there probably be guest worker programs that are h-1b visas but this is why I don't think the wall is the be-all end-all I mean the whole point here is that half illegal immigrants in the United States are people who overstayed their legal visas so that means that we really should be focusing on ensuring that we are enforcing the laws that are already on the books I'm fine with a wall I'm in favorable law but I don't think the wall is gonna solve the problem Levi says hey Ben I've been particularly been following your show for the last few years but just recently subscribed though he's part of my tax refund because what's more American than that my question is regarding taxes in the latest tax reform my sister and brother-in-law are big liberals and at that last family get-together we're saying that without the inheritance tax the rich could and would put all their money in a trust fund and then claim a lower tax bracket I wasn't sure of logistics so I had to debate them using all of their premises is this true are there loopholes that are now possible without the inheritance tax thanks for all use okay so the inheritance tax is ridiculous when the inheritance tax is is disgusting I already paid tax on that money so when you get income you pay tax on your income then the money goes into your estate right if the estate accrues money right if it accrues capital gains then you pay capital gains tax you don't pay income tax the rate on capital gains in income is not the same now there's a case to be made that you should pay the same tax on capital gains as you pay on income that's actually not a terrible case but the solution to this is not to clawback half the money that you already paid taxes on I mean every year I'm paying an enormous sum of taxes and then I'm taking the leftover and I'm putting it into savings for my kids and by the way when I put that money into a trust fund for my kids the bank is taking that money and borrowing against that money the bank doesn't just leave the money sitting in a lockbox somewhere the bank actually takes that money and lends it out at interest to other people who are starting businesses so all of this is economic ignorance on the part of these folks yeah the whole point of working hard one of the reasons that you work to make a profit is that you can take that money and pass it on to your children I would be supremely pissed if I did not have the ability to dispose of my money as I saw fit at the end of my life Samuels has been I will be in DC for vacation soon what in the historic city meets the opinion means the standard of can't-miss in your opinion want to make the trip worthwhile and would love your input so I think that the National Archive is fantastic you actually go see the actual original Constitution of the United States and Declaration of Independence which is super cool I think that the Supreme Court is really fun to visit the Smithsonian museums are of course really neat you should walk through the Capitol and check that out because it's kind of neat to see that this isn't some sort of you know faraway place that these are actual people working on the ground who are just normal human beings it's cool to visit the White House you know I've honestly I visited the the kind of private part of the White House more than I visited the public part of the White House but there's there you know the White House is a really neat place to visit all the typical sights that you see I really need the Washington Monument is great the Jefferson Memorial is great the Lincoln Memorial is great there are so many sites in DC it's it's really a tremendous place to visit I just wish that they would decentralize it and destroy it I think one of my big problems with DC is that I think you can tell whether a country is run well or not by whether the buildings that are government buildings are nicer than the private buildings in DC they are and that's a problem I like countries where I like areas what like state buildings are usually worse than the the private buildings in the same city I think that's the way it should be I think we should decentralized in Washington DC and make people live in their home districts and then vote from their home districts and this is what the internet was created for my Chelsea says Haven Trump is nominated unit Haspel to replace Mike Pompeo the biggest criticism of hers from working a secret prison in Thailand where at least one terrorist was waterboarded and then she subsequently ordered evidence of the waterboarding destroyed so again this was retracted today by Pro Publica what is the justification for using torture on terrorist suspects does it violate their human rights so the justification for using torture on terrorist suspects is twofold one terror suspects are not accorded protection under the Geneva Convention as I explained yesterday the Geneva Convention was designed to ensure that money - not money that was designed to ensure that soldiers stayed in uniform right if they got out of uniform they're no longer protected by the Geneva Conventions you go back and watch the Great Escape and you'll see this is a major issue right as soon as people try to escape the prison and dress up the civilians to escape they're no longer protected by the Geneva Conventions and this is a major risk for them this is for a reason you don't want people dressing up as civilians going into civilian areas and using those civilians for cover it gets more civilians killed one of the purposes of the Geneva Conventions is to prevent that from happening so terrorists should not be treated as members of an enemy army they should be treated as terrorists second of all is torture useful well was for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed right we waterboarded him a bejeweled times and we got some good information from him about the about al-qaeda and its leadership structure and all the rest so there's a really strong open debate going on about whether torture works or whether it does not I'm not gonna I'm not going to pretend that I think that waterboarding isn't a form of torture it's not the form of torture that does permanent damage but it's certainly torturing the person psychologically do I think that it's called for in certain circumstances I think probably but I think there's a good argument to be made on the other side I mean there's some people who say the torture doesn't work at all I find that dubious that's the argument anyway Jade says do you use an e-reader like a Kindle or you do prefer physical book so I tried a Kindle I tried it I tried it I tried it I prefer physical books I strongly prefer physical books one of the reasons for that is number one I just like the feel of a book in my hand I like the that I like to be able to turn the pages I feel like I'm making progress in a book one of the things that drives me nuts about Kindle is that it tells you percentage of the book that you've completed not page numbers which is annoying to me and then beyond that I have another problem which is I can't use a Kindle on Sabbath and I get a lot of reading done on Shabbat so if I'm in the middle of reading a book on Kindle I can't read it on Sabbath so I have to buy the physical copy anyway josh says I'm a senior at Stoneman Douglas my government teacher recently asked for a conservative and the liberal student to go on Trevor Noah I offered to be the conservative any tips for if I go on well number one just research the facts all the way up and down and make sure that you know Trevor Noah may try to suggest that you care less than you're a liberal friend and if he does then what you should say to him is listen Trevor I'm one of the people who is at the school you don't say you don't get to call into question my sincerity on these issues right you need to we need to have an open debate about these things and that has to start with people stopping questioning other people's sincerity and it's not just me right I think you should say to Trevor no you've been here ripping on the NRA ripping on Dana lash suggesting that she doesn't care about dead kids and all the rest of it I am one of the kids who's victimized I believe a lot of the same things that Dana lash believes and I don't think that makes her uncaring and I think that you need to stop that if you want to have a valuable conversation like this is a good valuable conversation we're having conservative liberal Trevor Noah right we're all having conversation together not doubting each other's motives if you can't grant that same capacity to so many other people in the political sphere we're never gonna get anywhere I would start with that point first of all I should do it second of all go totally viral so you should totally do that if you're on Trevor Noah show car says hey Ben if you had a Carl if you had an opportunity to overhaul the public education system what would you do well curriculum changes would you make and would you remove or include any courses of study do you there should be an early separation of students in two different tracks likes for students that plan to go to college versus to trade schools straight to the workforce big fan of York so yes I do think tracking should start earlier I don't think it should start you know one sir now you don't even started until you're in grad school so certainly by the time you're in college you should be tracked now the way it works in Israel is that you start getting tracked at age 17 which makes some sense to me curriculum changes you need a strong course in Western Civ I don't just mean you read about the history of Western Civ I mean you actually have to study the philosophy of westerns have you have to take the Bible seriously and Plato and Aristotle seriously and Aquinas seriously and you have to take the the Phyllis LC riously and you have to take the English enlightenment seriously I think a good course of Western civilization be useful in fact the book I'm writing is essentially that it's basically a primer on Western civilization so I hope that that will be helpful ok time for a quick thing I like and a quick thing I hate and then we will break for the weekend so thing that I like today how we've been doing books on socialism there's a book called the God that failed which is really a compilation of various essays from great thinkers people who many of whom used to be socialists and then decided that was stupid the best one in the in the collection is by Arthur Kessler who's also the author of a fantastic book called darkness at noon it's a novel it's about 100 pages maybe and it's it's an amazing book it's basically about a Trotsky figure who's captured by his own Revolution and thrown in jail and his experience before he's executed so it's you know light reading but the book to God that failed is is definitely worth reading check that out ok time for a quick thing that I hate all righty so the quick thing that I hate today is the Vanessa and Donald Trump Donald John Trump jr. are divorcing and the media are making a huge deal out of this right this is a big deal because of course he is a public figure they've released a joint statement apparently Vanessa didn't like being in the public eye they have five children so it really is tragic here's what they said after 12 years of marriage we have decided to go our separate ways we will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families we have five beautiful children together they remain our top priority we ask for your privacy during this time that's the way you should handle this although you know obviously I wish that they would work to put it back together I'm not in their situation but it's just you know obviously divorce is a terrible terrible thing what's what's really gross there's so many people on the Left who are celebrating this Oh John June you're getting what he deserves yeah this is a family I wouldn't be excited if the Obamas divorced right I that'd be terrible they have children I don't like it when people when bad things happen to people even if you don't like them politically and it's just their and their children involved particularly there's nothing to laugh about when it's Hollywood celebrities who are married for three months then they get to force then you can laugh at them but if they have children then it becomes a tragic situation already so we will be back here on Monday with all the latest I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Joshua Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing
