the leader of the Lebanese political party and militant group Hezbollah has revealed Washington offered to remove it from the terror watch list and give it financial aid if it dropped its resistance to Israel RTS Phoenicia Sethi picks up the story the u.s. terror list arguably the most dangerous list in the world and if you're on the database you'd assume there's no way outs of being branded an international threat right wrong if you want your name scratched off for good here your options you could become a friend of a friend the chief of Hezbollah the Lebanese sheer political and military movement with links to Iran says the United States offered the group the chance to be removed from the international terror watch lists but there was a catch Jerry Salomon Ditka Cheney I got a message from the US vice president saying that the u.s. is ready and that will be a part of the Lebanese government's get billions of dollars and be removed from the terror lists but under two conditions first one is that will work for the Americans and the second is that we'll stop resisting the Israeli occupation Israel's are very firm and strong out I say basically as long as you're nice to Washington's friends and for further proof that many talks look no further than the people's Masha had been organization of Iran doesn't matter that you killed American personnel and civilians hiring top-notch lobbyists will do the job politicians will back you at rallies before Islamic and secular TV ads will proclaim your innocence from TV screens tonight 9:00 Eastern M ek is Iran's Democratic opposition working for a nuclear-free Iran founded on human rights unjustly listed a terrorist group m EK is the victim of violence by the radical regime in Iran and their Iraqi allies this next option is simple just sits and waits until the tags removed Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela waited till days before his 90th birthday what a nice present from Washington and five years later at his funeral all was forgiven and forgotten his struggle was yours say Mandela now widely seen as an international hero it was branded as an international threat for decades whilst Syrian militants Jerusalem accused of including civilians using them as human shields just like a red line for you that you will not designate approach dishonest and you know on the battlefield there are groups that mesh together or individual fighters or groups of Fighters it's not a clean situation all the time so it appears that being on the US terror list may have little to do with actually being a terrorist however it is using what you might call the carrot and stick approach and a rather handy way for a government to achieve its strategic goals if you look and see who's been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States they are always the governments that seek to be independent from the United States or have challenged us hegemony in their area or in their country thus the label is purely political it doesn't really say anything about terrorism or about the people who are sanctioned under the FTO foreign terrorist organization label it's a form of bullying on a grand scale
