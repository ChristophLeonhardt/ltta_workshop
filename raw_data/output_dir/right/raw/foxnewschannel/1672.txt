1
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:03,596
MEETING WITH DONALD TRUMP JR.,

2
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:05,197
JARED KUSHNER AND SOME RUSSIANS.

3
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:06,899
RELEASING NEARLY 2,000 PAGES OF

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,400
THE INTERVIEW ABOUT THAT

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,702
TONIGHT.

6
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:11,370
THAT COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS ME

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,371
NOW.

8
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,606
GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

9
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:14,340
THERE IS QUITE A BIT TO DISCUSS

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,775
WITH YOU.

11
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:17,776
WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

12
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:19,278
LET ME TALK TO FIRST ABOUT THE

13
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:19,612
SUMMIT.

14
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,213
AT WHAT YOU MAKE OF WHAT

15
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,616
KIM JONG UN SAID IN TERMS OF THE

16
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:24,250
POSSIBILITY OF CANCELING?

17
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,217
SPEAK OF THE KIND OF PLAYED THIS

18
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,653
GAME IN THE PAST.

19
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,722
THE ONLY ADVICE I CAN GIVE

20
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,023
NORTH KOREA'S AND I HONESTLY

21
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:31,824
MEAN THIS, IF YOU ARE NOT

22
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,993
SERIOUS ABOUT DOING A DEAL WITH

23
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,027
THE PRESIDENT, IF YOU ARE NOT

24
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:37,096
WILLING TO GIVE UP YOUR NUKES

25
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:38,063
FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR

26
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:39,632
NORTH KOREA, DON'T MEET WITH THE

27
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:40,032
PRESIDENT.

28
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,333
THE WORST THING YOU COULD DO IS

29
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,202
SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH

30
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:44,303
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THEN TRY TO

31
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:45,571
PLAY HIM BECAUSE IF YOU DO THAT

32
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,072
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A WAR AND

33
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,774
YOU WERE GOING TO LOSE IT.

34
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,609
SO IF YOU ARE NOT SERIOUS,

35
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:51,410
PLEASE DON'T MEET WITH THE

36
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,144
PRESIDENT.

37
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:52,912
>> Martha: THERE WAS SOME

38
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,047
SUGGESTION THAT JOHN BOLTON

39
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,917
MENTIONED THE LIBYA MODEL AND

40
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:58,817
THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR

41
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:00,953
BECAUSE KIM JONG UN DOES NOT

42
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:03,522
WANT TO END UP LIKE

43
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,991
MUAMMAR QADDAFI.

44
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:07,126
MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY OF

45
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,595
STATE, WAS ASKED A LITTLE BIT

46
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:10,429
ABOUT WHAT ASSURANCES WE MIGHT

47
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:11,997
BE WILLING TO GIVE KIM JONG UN

48
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:13,232
ON SECURITY BY CHRIS WALLACE.

49
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:13,832
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

50
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:17,202
>> AS PART OF THAT, ARE WE IN

51
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,237
EFFECT SAYING TO KIM, IF YOU

52
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,772
GIVE US WHAT WE WANT, YOU CAN

53
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,375
STAY ON AND POWER?

54
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,209
>> WE WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE

55
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,978
SECURITY ASSURANCES TO BE SURE.

56
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:27,446
THIS HAS BEEN THE TRADE-OFF THAT

57
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,814
HAS BEEN PENDING FOR 25 YEARS.

58
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,082
>> Martha: WHAT DO YOU THINK

59
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:32,017
THAT MEANS?

60
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,018
>> I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

61
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:34,420
HERE'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

62
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,322
IF WE END THE KOREAN WAR, WHICH

63
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:37,056
HAS NEVER ENDED.

64
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,424
WE SIGNED A PEACE TREATY WITH

65
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:42,027
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA,

66
00:01:42,027 --> 00:01:42,861
CHINA AND UNITED STATES.

67
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,029
WE RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA AS A

68
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:44,830
SOVEREIGN COUNTRY.

69
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,333
WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO INVADE

70
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:47,733
NORTH KOREA.

71
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,201
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO UNIFY

72
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,636
SOUTH KOREA AND NORTH KOREA.

73
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:51,403
WE JUST WANT NORTH KOREA TO GIVE

74
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,605
UP THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

75
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:54,807
WHICH HAS THREATENED US AND THE

76
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:55,107
WORLD.

77
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:57,142
FOR THAT THEY WILL GET A

78
00:01:57,142 --> 00:01:57,776
GUARANTEE OF SECURITY AND

79
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:59,812
HOPEFULLY A BETTER ECONOMY

80
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:00,980
BECAUSE THE SANCTIONS WILL BE

81
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,347
RELIEVED.

82
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:03,983
HERE'S THE OTHER CHOICE, KEEP

83
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:04,717
THREATENING AMERICA, KEEP

84
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,686
BUILDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND

85
00:02:07,686 --> 00:02:08,020
ICBMs.

86
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,221
GET IN A WAR WITH DONALD TRUMP

87
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:09,888
AND LOSE IT.

88
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:12,624
THOSE ARE YOUR TWO CHOICES.

89
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:13,492
THE ONE KIM JONG UN CLEARLY HAS

90
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:14,493
PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHO SAY THAT

91
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:16,729
IT WOULD BE CRAZY FOR HIM TO

92
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:17,463
GIVE UP THE BIGGEST WEAPON THAT

93
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:19,531
HE HAS IN THE BIGGEST WEAPON

94
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,636
THAT HE CAN HOLD OVER.

95
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:26,105
WE MAY BE SEEING HIM HAVING SOME

96
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,206
SECOND THOUGHTS HERE ON THAT

97
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:28,207
FRONT.

98
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,641
ALSO, WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF

99
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,110
NORTH KOREA WILL HAVE LIVED ON

100
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,444
THE DARK CONTINENT FOR ALL THESE

101
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,013
DECADES, AND WHAT'S TO STOP THEM

102
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:35,748
ONCE THEY HAVE NO NUKES AND THEY

103
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,384
HAVE A LOT OF LIGHT SHED INTO

104
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,785
THEIR COUNTRY FROM REBELLING

105
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,787
AGAINST THIS REGIME THAT HAS PUT

106
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,521
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

107
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,324
IN LABOR CAMPS?

108
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:46,025
>> YOU ARE THINKING TOO HARD

109
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:46,325
HERE.

110
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:50,095
HERE'S WHAT'S CRAZY.

111
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:53,599
THEY KEEP BUILDING ICBMS AND

112
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,335
BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON'T

113
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,603
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

114
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:58,504
THAT PROBABLY WORK WITH OBAMA

115
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,304
BUT I'M HERE TO TELL NORTH KOREA

116
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,907
THAT OUR PRESIDENT HAS DRAWN A

117
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:02,241
REDLINE.

118
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:03,642
IF YOU KEEP THREATENING THE

119
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,411
AMERICAN HOMELAND WITH A NUCLEAR

120
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,812
WEAPON WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY

121
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,814
YOUR REGIME, IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

122
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,150
SO IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE,

123
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,451
KIM JONG UN, YOU NEED TO SIT

124
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,519
DOWN WITH THE PRESIDENT AND DO A

125
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,522
DEAL GIVING UP YOUR NUKES.

126
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:18,257
IN RETURN WE WILL GUARANTEE YOUR

127
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:19,024
SECURITY END AND THE KOREAN WAR.

128
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,927
IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE

129
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,862
DOING, YOU ARE MISCALCULATING

130
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:24,296
DONALD TRUMP.

131
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:26,799
HE'S NOT OBAMA.

132
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,967
YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

133
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,235
TO THOSE WHO ARE ADVISING

134
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,136
KIM JONG UN TO CONTINUE DOWN THE

135
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:33,405
PATH THAT YOU ARE GOING, BAD

136
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,039
ADVICE.

137
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,007
>> Martha: WE WILL SEE.

138
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,508
QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU ABOUT THE

139
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,209
PEACE IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

140
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,078
ABOUT MIKE PENCE AND THE

141
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:42,414
OPERATION THAT HE'S BUILDING TO

142
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:43,215
GIVE SUPPORT TO THE REPUBLICAN

143
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:45,184
PARTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS THEY

144
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,385
HEAD INTO NOVEMBER.

145
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,020
THERE WAS SOME SUGGESTION IN THE

146
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,787
HEADLINE OF THAT PEACE WHICH WAS

147
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:51,457
PENCE IS TRYING TO CONTROL

148
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,458
PUBLIC AND POLITICS.

149
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,792
TRUMP AIDS AREN'T HAPPY AND THEY

150
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,594
QUOTED U.S. SAYING THIS.

151
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:56,462
THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING FOR

152
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,130
PEOPLE TO STAY ON THE TEAM, NOT

153
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,031
BREAK AWAY FROM THE TEAM.

154
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,365
YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THE?

155
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,603
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS MIKE PENCE

156
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:05,471
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS MIKE PENC

157
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,872
MIKE PENCE, IT'S MUSIC TO MY

158
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,172
EARS.

159
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:12,811
AN ORGANIZED EFFORT TO SAVE THE

160
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,445
REPUBLICAN MAJORITY MAKES

161
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,246
PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

162
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:17,983
THERE'S NO MORE LOYAL PERSON TO

163
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:18,983
DONALD TRUMP THAN MIKE PENCE.

164
00:04:18,983 --> 00:00:00,000
I'M GLAD THEY ARE DOING THIS.
