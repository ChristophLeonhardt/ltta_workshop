another Trump cabinet member has been confronted at a restaurant this time a mother carrying her toddler called out embattled EPA's chief Scott Pruett during lunch yesterday calling on him to step down take a look actually doesn't affect our environment Louise and climate change in keeping our children schoolteacher Kristen mink says Pruitt did not respond and left the restaurant the incident comes as the Washington Post reports two of Pruitt's top aides provided new details to congressional investigators on some of his most controversial spending and management decisions a reminder here for those of you who have not been keeping track at home there are now at least 15 ongoing investigations into the EPA heads questionable behavior those 15 by the way some internal some external but 15 total Mack McLarty former White House chief of staff for President Clinton currently he is chairman of McLarty associates Mac always good to have you sir Greg my pleasure so this article includes revelations of Pruitt asking aides to seek a job with a $200,000 salary for his wife and help in the job search as well also apparently at one point asking staffers to put hotel reservations on their personal credit cards there are also reports that Pruitt and his aides maintained secret calendars in order to prevent controversial meetings or calls from getting out to the public with with the testimony now on the record from these former aides Mac are the walls starting to close in on Scott Pruett well they may be Craig I mean it's the old adage where there's smoke there may be fire and allegations or allegations they need to be proven facts but you went through the litany and the introduction we've had this ongoing in terms of administrator Pruitt's conduct and I must say I'm surprised because he's been in public life he's been Attorney General of Oklahoma he was head of the Republican Attorney General's Association so he should well understand that there is a clear line a clear line between public responsibility and duty and private business and you just have to honor that and of course President Trump came to office with drain the swamp and so forth and people can understand cronyism and they don't like it and that's what some of this may be again I don't want to prejudge but there's just been too much too much controversy three million dollars spent on a security detail purchase of a 43,000 soundproof office phone booth tasking aids to purchase a used mattress for Matt a Trump Hotel no one has provided any explanation about why anyone forget the EPA chief but would want to use mattress from his boss's hotel but that's that's just part of the list this is what the president said about his epa chief last month well Scott fruit is doing a great job within the walls of the EPA if it was setting records outside he's being attacked very viciously by the press saying that he's blameless I mean a bit of a contradiction there I'm not saying that he's blameless but you know the press is so so vicious well I think Craig what it shows is these kind of episode situations take away from what the president is trying to do in terms of his policies now in terms of the deregulation he ran on that I think we we may overdo it one way or the other on some of these matters but that's the real point it takes away from what the president's trying to accomplish and he indicated that in those comments hey Matt shifting gears here really quickly chief of staff to the president John Kelly there are reports now that he is on his way out reported that he's leaving his post although the White House has called rumors of of Kelly's departure fake news light-minded aides Mick Mulvaney VP chief of staff Nick Ayers they've been considered also worried that he's adding bill shine as deputy chief of staff what does all of this mean moving forward more chaos less chaos perhaps this president this White House have had just an unprecedented amount of change and turnover at the cabinet the White House level it's hard to get stability and really move your agenda forward general Kelly I think has gotten frustrated at times he's expressed that we'll see how all of this plays out the truth is President Trump in many ways operates Craig without a chief of staff that's the way he did in the private sector but being president United States being in government is just very very different landscape so you know he's already had so many changes in the white house you have to get stability we had our challenges getting started but we did achieve that stability in President Clinton got his legislation passed that first year and his approval rating reflected that and remember this presidents going right into these midterms with the Republicans on the bubble both in the House and the Senate Mack McLarty former White House chief of staff mech-tech surgeons with a holiday you too Craig hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching
