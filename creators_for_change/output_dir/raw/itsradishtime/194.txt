00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
hey guys I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of a</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,350
new set up today so i can stand by the

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,060
window and get some natural light but

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that also means i am standing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up so</font>

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,639
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> and welcome to my apartment and</font>

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,849
let's blog if you watched<font color="#E5E5E5"> my letter from</font>

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,800
the past video you may have gathered

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,500
that it was not the hugest fan of high

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,240
school I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody is really</font>

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">so today I'm going to tell you about</font>

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I think the coolest parts of being</font>

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,080
in college now that I'm out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and if</font>

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,599
you are in college or university right

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,540
now pay attention and take notes take

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,130
advantage of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things because you</font>

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,020
will miss them once you are you graduate

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,510
so what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the coolest part</font>

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,790
about being in college or university is

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,770
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have the chance to</font>

20
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,710
foster absolutely any passion you want

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,600
to anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you care a lot about</font>

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,449
and want to know more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the</font>

23
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity to do whether that's through</font>

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,649
your classes you know you can major in

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,190
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excites you by the</font>

26
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,980
way I was an English major and a Spanish

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,780
major if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are either of those things</font>

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,060
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let anybody tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font>

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,549
never find a job because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can any</font>

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,080
will and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be so much happier</font>

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,720
that you spent those four years studying

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,610
something that you liked but it also

33
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,530
doesn't have to be your major I think

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,810
some of the coolest classes I took had

35
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,580
nothing to do with my Chris of study it

36
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,860
took a psychology class on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we try to</font>

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,740
understand and categorize human

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,259
personality it took a physics class

39
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,390
focused on environmental issues

40
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,840
especially clean energy I took a class

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,479
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the philosophy of art about how we</font>

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,820
understand art how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what is</font>

43
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,850
art and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what isn't and how art is</font>

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,610
affected by

45
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,820
art buyers and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> art world and i wrote</font>

46
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,850
my term paper on graffiti and street art

47
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it was the coolest but it was also</font>

48
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,620
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardest class I took in</font>

49
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,830
school so study broadly take things that

50
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,110
challenge you and study what you love

51
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,940
another cool thing about college is you

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,640
are not at all limited to what you learn

53
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,180
in the classroom there is nowhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

54
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">you will find such a wealth of clubs and</font>

55
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,100
student organizations and internships

56
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,260
and volunteer opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that give</font>

57
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chance to devote time to</font>

58
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,700
literally anything that you like in

59
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">college I was in a dance group and an</font>

60
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,030
environmentalist club and a society for

61
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,730
spanish speakers but you can also be in

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,590
clubs for things like political<font color="#E5E5E5"> causes</font>

63
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,650
or sports or books or movies or

64
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,200
unicycling and if it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,180
chances are you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably start that</font>

66
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,890
group and find other people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

67
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,989
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing and there</font>

68
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,739
is nothing cooler than being part of a

69
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,959
group of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are passionate about</font>

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,880
the same things you are passionate about

71
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,190
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn so much you can accomplish</font>

72
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,540
amazing things now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am officially</font>

73
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,239
an adult I missed these things I miss

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">them for real in college it feels like</font>

75
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,660
you can't swing a dead cat without

76
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,330
finding new bestie as an adult it feels

77
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of isolating it's hard to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

78
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,989
people that you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hang</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out with at</font>

79
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:10,420
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> much less people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share your</font>

80
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,330
interests so deeply if you're like me

81
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,650
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hard time making friends</font>

82
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,739
all those groups aren't easy in you

83
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,420
immediately have a reason to connect and

84
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,489
you don't have to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make small</font>

85
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:23,290
talk and build a relationship slowly

86
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,840
that way oh and by the way if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,209
still having a hard time don't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid</font>

88
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,489
to seek<font color="#E5E5E5"> help I actually met some of my</font>

89
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,560
best friends in college in a group

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
therapy session and now that I'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

91
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,540
big old real world

92
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,000
so wish that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had assembled a group of</font>

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,549
like-minded YouTube fans and aspiring

94
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,829
cinematographers when I have the ability

95
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,230
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it like that so if you are in</font>

96
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">school or you are going to be in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> school</font>

97
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,299
don't take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for granted it is one of</font>

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> coolest times in your life so go</font>
