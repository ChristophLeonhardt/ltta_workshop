said to Syrian out where militants and rebels are refusing to surrender despite in advance by government forces towards the northwestern Italy province locals meanwhile have been leaving the area via Russia sponsored humanitarian corridors the militants weren't good to us they demanded six million liras they took our two sons when we reached the checkpoint they threatened us and had to turn back now we are going home where from up world whore the device helps to detect explosives and weapons we press the button and scan the object it has a special indicator this car is 100% clean but we've seen cause in weaponry before mama Papa George if people come with skin and breathing problems all children and the mothers have been checked over they were given recommendations and medicine to start treat I speak Nancy professor of international relations dr. Bassam Abu Abdullah good evening teas how would you assess the role that Russia is playing here with these humanitarian corridors it's sponsoring across Syria thank you very much for having me in your program it's absolutely I think the this is not first experience if you will take the story of the Syrian crisis we should remember that the same corridors was used by Russians by help of Russians in the east part of Aleppo a view of we remember 2016 after that the same the same way we used in the east part of gouta we remember and now I think in the south now it's as a preparation for the in deep battle but without this kind of humanitarian aid it's difficult to for the people to go back to their homes and villages especially after the terrorist organization control of this area so because of that I think this campaign it's not only concerning what we are seeing today but either there are other efforts we can see and notice through the diplomatic efforts with Jordan with the Lebanon and I think the future with turkey for the returning of the Syrian people and refugees and this is very important because some regional and international actors wanted to use these the these people or the Syrian refugees as a political car to the future of Syria which now is and this model or this plan studying the way for them the other factor which we should mention that some original states benefits from MSE and religious though taking a huge amount of money from international organization while now there is a shortage of this financial support for the Syrian refugees after seven years of the war the other factor which I should mention that this that the refugees inside or outside it became as a factor of pressure on the local societies we could see that in Lebanon Jordan and either in in Turkey so I think they the Russian campaign the Russian efforts generally either it helps the regional set which now in a very difficult situation so it's not only for Syria and for the stability see either I think the Lebanon were responding very positively with these reports Jordan in and their interest to do that and inside Syria is very important factor to return the label step-by-step because if we are speaking about the political future of Syria without stability security and combating terrorism there is no future so because of that I assess that it's very very important and it's at the end of the day helping the Syrian people to return to work to make economy and to to have stability after the seven years of this fascist war against the Syrian people and if you could we've got about 30 seconds left I just want to ask you that during the Helsinki summit Donald Trump implied Amir Putin agreed to have joint humanitarian efforts in Syria has there been any sign of an effort from the US as yet as we have heard the neither I have heard the minister Bombay Oh in the Congress is doing his the during his meeting with the Congress I think there are some Understanding between Russia and United and I think this is a results of the efforts of President Putin with President Trump in the Helsinki summit at the end of the day I think the American they could see that the situation's changing dramatically not in their interests in Syria especially in the military for the second that president brow Trump is the thinking in other way he don't want to benefit from the situation in Syria there is no money there and at the same time this - they're the instruments which the United States used during seven years I mean terrorist organization is already collapse in Syria by supporting the Russian army the Russian government - this year in government that I think they apologize I'm afraid we're just running over now on our allotted time for this segment we're gonna have to wrap things up there my apologies dr. Bassam Abu Abdullah professor of international relations thank you you
